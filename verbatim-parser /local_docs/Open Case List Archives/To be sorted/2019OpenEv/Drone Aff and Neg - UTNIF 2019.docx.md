#### President Trump's recent loosening of restrictions on drone exports have placed arms sales at the heart of US foreign policy

Donald Trump is turning out to be the best thing to happen to the
defense industry since Ronald Reagan left town. **[On Thursday of this
week, the White House released a presidential memorandum loosening the
restrictions on overseas sales of unmanned aerial vehicles, colloquially
known as \"drones.\" Defense companies have been arguing for years that
regulations concerning the export of drones were too burdensome, and
enabled competitors to capture foreign markets.\]{.underline}**
Clearly, the White House has heard these complaints.\
**[But the implications of the April 19 memorandum are far more
momentous, because it commits the federal government to actively
facilitating arms sales to overseas allies and partners. The government
has always been a participant in decisions to export weapons, but now it
looks poised to become a promoter.]{.underline}** The memorandum cites
several reasons why this is desirable: it creates jobs, it reduces the
trade deficit, it spurs innovation, it maintains our military\'s
warfighting edge, and it reduces the need for other countries to seek
U.S. \"boots on the ground.\"

##  Yemen

#### Scenario 1: Civil War

#### 100 civilians are dying every week in the war in Yemen -- the atrocities are unacceptable

**UNHCR 3/7** (United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, 2019,
"Almost 100 civilian casualties each week in Yemen in 2018",
<https://www.unhcr.org/en-us/news/press/2019/3/5c8121734/100-civilian-casualties-week-yemen-2018.html>,

**[Civilians continue to pay a high price in the conflict in Yemen,
according to the latest data released today by the UNHCR, UN Refugee
Agency, led Protection Cluster. On average, almost 100 civilian deaths
or injuries were recorded each week in 2018.\
According to the Civilian Impact Monitoring Report for 2018, more than
4,800 civilian deaths and injuries were reported over the course of the
year resulting in an average of 93 civilian casualties per
week.\]{.underline}**
These casualty figures are based on open source data. It is collected,
analyzed and disseminated as part of the Civilian Impact Monitoring
Project (CIMP) which publishes this information in support of
humanitarian protection programs in Yemen. UNHCR leads the Protection
Cluster within the UN's humanitarian response in Yemen, with the support
of the Danish Refugee Council (DRC) as co-coordinator.\
According to this latest report, the largest number of casualties in
2018 were reported in Yemen's volatile west coast, which includes Al
Hudaydah governorate, one of the epicenters of the conflict since June
2018. Almost half (48 per cent) of all reported casualties were recorded
in this region, followed by Sa'ada and Al Jawf (22 per cent) which also
remain a flashpoint of the conflict.\
**["The report illustrates the staggering human cost of the conflict.
Civilians in Yemen continue to face serious risks to their safety,
well-being and basic rights. Exposed to daily violence, many live under
constant fear and suffer in deteriorating conditions, turning in
desperation to harmful coping mechanisms in order to survive," said
Volker Türk, UNHCR's Assistant High Commissioner for
Refugees.]{.underline}**\
Thirty percent of civilians were reported to have been killed and
injured inside their homes. Civilians were also killed while travelling
on the roads, while working on farms and at local business, markets and
other civilian sites.\
**[A fifth of all civilian casualties recorded were inflicted on
children (410 deaths and 542 injuries).\
In addition to direct civilian casualties, the report also highlights
the impact of armed conflict for civilians in accessing critical
infrastructure and essential services. Partners on the ground estimate
that attacks on civilian infrastructure restricted access to food,
water, aid and health care for more than half a million civilian
families.\]{.underline}**
"UNHCR reiterates its call to all parties to the conflict to do their
utmost to protect civilians and civilian infrastructure in accordance
with international humanitarian law. Only a peaceful resolution of the
conflict will halt further suffering and stem humanitarian needs," said
Türk.\
**[Four years of conflict in Yemen has created the world's largest
humanitarian crisis. It has left more than 14 million people in need of
protection and forced nearly 15 per cent of the entire population, some
4.3 million people, to flee their homes. This includes 3.3 million
people who are still displaced across the country, while one million
have attempted to return home.]{.underline}**

#### US drones have assisted the Saudi coalition in targeting air strikes in the ongoing conflict in Yemen

**Emmons 4/14** (Alex, a reporter covering national security, foreign
affairs, human rights, and politics for the Intercept, 2019, "SECRET
REPORT REVEALS SAUDI INCOMPETENCE AND WIDESPREAD USE OF U.S. WEAPONS IN
YEMEN",
<https://theintercept.com/2019/04/15/saudi-weapons-yemen-us-france/>,
Aly M)

Since the beginning of the war, the U.S. has backed the coalition
bombing campaign with weapons sales and, until recently, midair
refueling support for aircraft. **[But the French report suggests that
U.S. drones may also be helping with Saudi munitions targeting.\
"If the RSAF benefits from American support, in the form of advice in
the field of targeting, the practice of Close Air Support (CAS) is
recent and appears poorly understood by these crews," the document says.
A footnote after the word "targeting" specifies that the possible U.S.
"advice" refers to "targeting effectuated by American drones."\
Though the U.S. has denied engaging directly in hostilities against the
Houthis, American MQ-9 Reaper drones -- a reconnaissance drone with
hunt-and-kill capabilities -- have flown over Houthi occupied territory.
After the Houthis shot down one of the drones in October 2017, it led to
speculation that the U.S. could be using them to collect intelligence
for the Saudis. Targeting being effectuated by American drones could
mean that U.S. drones play a more active role in coalition targeting,
like laser-sighting precision-guided munitions drops, for
example.]{.underline}**

#### US-Saudi air targeting leads to mass civilian causalities -- millions are dying from starvation and disease 

**Bazzi 19** (Bazzi, Mohamad. "Both Saudi Arabia and the United States
Are Probably Guilty of War Crimes in Yemen." The Nation, 17 May 2019,
www.thenation.com/article/war-crimes-united-states-saudi-arabia-yemen/.)

**[On August 9 of last year, warplanes from a Saudi-led coalition bombed
a school bus near a market in the northern Yemeni town of Dahyan,
killing 54 people, 44 of them children]{.underline}**. After
interviewing more than a dozen witnesses and survivors, **[Human Rights
Watch called the attack an "apparent war crime" because "there was no
evident military target in the market at the time]{.underline}**."
**[The munition used by the Saudis was supplied by the United
States]{.underline}**---a **[500-pound laser-guided bomb made by
Lockheed Martin]{.underline}**. **[As it has done repeatedly when its
air strikes kill cxivilians, the Saudi coalition at first insisted that
it had attacked a legitimate military target]{.underline}**. On August
11, Saudi Arabia's mission to the United Nations claimed that the strike
had "targeted Houthi leaders who were responsible for recruiting and
training young children, and then sending them to battlefields." **[It
did not provide evidence to support these claims.]{.underline}**
Finally, after growing international condemnation, on September 1, the
Saudis acknowledged that the attack was unjustified and vowed to "hold
those who committed mistakes" accountable. In an interview with Axios in
**[November, President Donald Trump said the Saudis and their allies did
not know how to use American weapons properly]{.underline}**. Asked if
he was bothered that the Saudis had blown up a school bus with a US-made
bomb, Trump responded, "Bother's not strong enough. That was basically
people that didn't know how to use the weapon, which is horrible." He
called the bus attack a "horror show" and promised to take up the matter
with Saudi leaders. "I'll be talking about a lot of things with the
Saudis," Trump added, "but certainly I wouldn't be having people that
don't know how to use the weapons shooting at buses with children."
**[Trump's muddled answer reflected a narrative that has been gaining
traction for years among US officials and in sectors of the Western
media: that the Saudis and their allies in the Yemen war, especially the
United Arab Emirates, are killing civilians and destroying
infrastructure by mistake. But this is not true]{.underline}**. **[The
Saudi coalition has targeted civilians and the country's infrastructure
by design since it intervened in Yemen's civil war in March
2015.]{.underline}** It's not that the Saudis and their allies don't
know how to use American-made weapons or need help in choosing
targets---**[they're using them as intended.]{.underline}** **[And
American officials have known this for years.]{.underline}** On April 4,
**[the House voted to end US military support for the Saudi-led war in
Yemen, finally approving a bill to restrain presidential war
powers]{.underline}** **[that has taken years to pass both chambers of
Congress]{.underline}**. The measure, which invoked the 1973 War Powers
Act and argued that Congress never authorized support for the Saudi
coalition, underscored growing anger over American involvement in a war
that has created the world's worst humanitarian crisis. **[The vote was
also a rebuke to Trump for doubling down on his support for Saudi
Arabia's ruthless crown prince, Mohammed bin Salman, after Saudi agents
murdered journalist Jamal Khashoggi]{.underline}** at the Saudi
Consulate in Istanbul. On April 16, Trump vetoed the bill, and
supporters in Congress did not have enough votes to override that veto.
**[One of the most persistent false arguments advanced by Pentagon and
Trump administration officials against the congressional bill is that
American support is necessary to keep the Saudi coalition from killing
even more civilians]{.underline}**. On April 29, **[Michael Mulroy,
deputy assistant defense secretary for the Middle East, told a
Washington think tank that US support is now limited to "side-by-side
coaching to help mitigate civilian casualties.]{.underline}**" He argued
that if Congress was to override Trump's veto of the War Powers Act
resolution, this US assistance would end. "If that happens, that's
obviously not helping the situation," Mulroy said at the Center for a
New American Security. **[The Trump administration continues to insist
that Saudi Arabia and the UAE have tried to reduce civilian deaths and
to enable humanitarian-aid deliveries in Yemen]{.underline}**,
**[despite contradictory evidence documented by the United Nations,
human-rights groups, and, most recently, former US officials who served
in President Barack Obama's administration]{.underline}**. In September,
Secretary of State Mike Pompeo formally assured Congress that the two US
allies were trying to reduce civilian deaths. Congress required the
administration to make this certification a condition for the Pentagon
to continue providing military assistance. But Pompeo's claim
contradicted most other independent reviews of the war, including a
report issued in August by a group of UN experts. The report found both
the Saudi-led coalition and rebel Houthi militia responsible for likely
war crimes, but it blamed the Saudis and their allies for killing far
more civilians. "**[Coalition air strikes have caused most of the
documented civilian casualties]{.underline}**," the report said. "[**In
the past three years, such air strikes have hit residential areas,
markets, funerals, weddings, detention facilities, civilian boats, and
even medical facilities."** **Saudi leaders and their allies have
ignored American entreaties to minimize civilian casualties since the
war's early days**]{.underline}. **[And, according to recent testimony
in Congress by two members of the Obama administratio]{.underline}**n,
**[US officials recognized as early as 2016 that top Saudi and UAE
leaders were not interested in reducing civilian
casualties]{.underline}**. In little-noticed testimony to the House
Subcommittee on the Middle East, North Africa, and International
Terrorism in early March**[, the two former State Department officials
explained how deeply involved the United States has been in helping the
Saudis choose their targets in Yemen, creating "no-strike" lists, and
sending trainers to help avoid civilian casualties]{.underline}**. The
officials were Dafna Rand, a former deputy assistant secretary of state,
who is now a vice president at Mercy Corps; and Jeremy Konyndyk, former
director of the USAID Office of US Foreign Disaster Assistance. **[Rand
testified that soon after the Saudis launched the war in 2015, and
civilian casualties started to mount, the State Department sent a
trainer]{.underline}** to Riyadh to work with Saudi Defense Ministry
officials. She said the trainer had worked with the US military's
Central Command to reduce civilian casualties in Afghanistan, and US
officials had thought the Saudis could use similar techniques to reduce
casualties in Yemen. "We approached this very technically behind closed
doors, very quietly, sent our trainer in," Rand said, adding that, after
a cease-fire in 2016, US officials were hopeful that their efforts were
paying off. But once the cease-fire collapsed in August 2016, the Saudi
coalition attacked a series of civilian targets that caused mass
casualties. At that point, Rand said, "it gave us pause to recalibrate
the strategy, and wonder what had happened to our training." The State
Department continued to quietly send the trainer to Riyadh. **[But Rand
and other officials soon realized that top Saudi leaders were not
interested in limiting civilian casualties, despite American appeals.
She said Saudi leaders only cared if the president---first Obama and
later Trump---applied pressure or threatened to suspend weapons
sales]{.underline}**. Rand did not mention Mohammed bin Salman, who was
then the deputy crown prince and Saudi defense minister and a major
architect of the Yemen war. **["We came to the conclusion by late 2016
that although there were very many well-meaning and professional
generals in the Saudi Ministry of Defense, there was a lack of political
will at the top senior levels to reduce the number of civilian
casualties,"]{.underline}** she said. Representative Tom Malinowski, a
Democrat from New Jersey who had served as assistant secretary of state
for democracy, human rights, and labor during the Obama administration,
asked Rand if the problem was "imprecise targeting, or were they
targeting the wrong things?" Rand responded, "It was very clear that
precision was not the issue, and that guiding was not the issue. It was
the type of target selection that became the clear issue, and even when
the US government told them which targets not to hit, we saw instances
where the coalition was targeting the wrong thing." "So they
deliberately struck targets like water treatment facilities and food
distribution centers that were on a no-strike list that was handed to
them?" Malinowski asked at the sparsely attended hearing. Konyndyk, who
in his role at USAID helped compile a no-strike list of civilian
targets, responded that US officials initially assumed that the Saudis
and their allies would know not to attack schools and hospitals, which
are visible from the air. The initial list of humanitarian sites
included the offices of nongovernmental organizations and
warehouses---"things that if you looked at them from the air, you would
not be aware it's a humanitarian facility." American officials soon
realized that "the Saudis tended to treat anything not on the no-strike
list that we gave them as fair game, so then we expanded the list,"
Konyndyk said. "And we began naming categories of sites, including
specific road routes that were critical to the humanitarian effort."
**[But the Saudis and their allies attacked sites that were on various
no-strike lists, which has grown to include thousands of locations
compiled by the UN and humanitarian groups]{.underline}**. In August
2016, for example, the Saudi coalition bombed the main bridge on the
155-mile road from Hodeidah port, along the Red Sea coast, to the
capital, Sanaa. That road was the main artery for humanitarian groups to
bring aid into Yemen, especially territory controlled by the Houthi
militia. **["They struck that \[bridge\] despite us having specifically
told them through that process not to," Konyndyk said.]{.underline}**
Radhya al-Mutawakel, co-founder and leader of Mwatana for Human Rights,
a Yemen-based organization, told the House subcommittee that the Saudis
and their allies simply don't care about protecting Yemeni civilians.
"It's not a matter of training. It's a matter of accountability. They
don't care," she said. "If they cared, they can make it much better, at
least not to embarrass their allies." According to the Yemen Data
Project, **[Saudi and UAE warplanes have conducted more than 19,500 air
strikes on Yemen since the war began, an average of nearly 13 attacks
per day. (About a third of these attacks are on military targets, while
the rest are classified as nonmilitary targets or
"unknown]{.underline}**.") **[The coalition has bombed schools,
hospitals, markets, mosques, farms, factories, roads, bridges, power
plants, water-treatment facilities, even a potato-chip
factory.]{.underline}** Rand and Konyndyk did not accuse the coalition
of war crimes, but international humanitarian law forbids the
intentional targeting of civilians during war. Representative Ted Lieu,
a Democrat from California and a former military lawyer who has been one
of the most vocal critics in Congress of the US role in Yemen, was more
blunt at the subcommittee hearing: Saudi Arabia and the UAE "are
deliberately targeting civilians," he said. "I think these are war
crimes." Despite thousands of air strikes over the past four years, the
Saudi-led alliance has failed to dislodge the Houthis from Yemen's
capital. That stalemate has embarrassed the war's two main architects:
Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, who has overseen the Yemen
campaign from its start, and his mentor, Abu Dhabi's crown prince and
the UAE's de facto ruler, Mohammed bin Zayed. And as the war dragged on,
the two leaders have become more brutal, with little restraint from the
United States or other Western allies. **[Beyond the intentional bombing
of civilians in violation of international law, the Saudi and Emirati
militaries have also destroyed civilian infrastructure and imposed air
and naval blockades that have led to the deaths of tens of thousands of
Yemenis from starvation and preventable diseases like
cholera]{.underline}**. In their report last August, a group of
independent UN experts noted that, **[before the Saudi-led war, Yemen
imported nearly 90 percent of its food, fuel, and medical
supplies.]{.underline}** The report concluded that the Saudi-UAE
blockades "have had widespread and devastating effects on the civilian
population." **[The war triggered a humanitarian catastrophe, which has
been partly obscured because the UN stopped updating civilian deaths in
January 2017, when the toll reached 10,000]{.underline}**. Many news
reports still rely on that outdated figure, even though the actual death
toll is far higher. An independent estimate by the **[Armed Conflict
Location & Event Data Project has recorded more than 70,000 fatalities
between January 2016 and April 2019]{.underline}**. (That figure
includes both civilian and military casualties, **[but it does not cover
the first seven months of the war, when the death toll was
highest]{.underline}**.) [**And even that estimate fails to capture the
full scope of human suffering in Yemen.**]{.underline} In November,
**[the aid agency Save the Children released an analysis estimating that
85,000 children have likely died of hunger since Saudi Arabia and its
allies began their bombing campaign]{.underline}**. **["For every child
killed by bombs and bullets, dozens are starving to death and it's
entirely preventable," T]{.underline}**amer Kirolos, the group's country
director, said in the report. "Children who die in this way suffer
immensely as their vital organ functions slow down and eventually stop."
Last month, the United Nations Development Programme issued a report,
produced primarily by researchers at the University of Denver, with a
dramatically higher estimate: **[It warned that the death toll in Yemen
could rise to 233,000 by the end of 2019]{.underline}**. **[That
projected count includes 102,000 deaths from combat and 131,000 indirect
deaths due to the lack of food, health crises like the cholera epidemic,
and damage to Yemen's infrastructure.]{.underline}** **[The conflict has
turned into a "war on children," with one Yemeni child dying every 12
minutes]{.underline}**; t**[he report estimates that 140,000 of those
killed by the end of 2019 would be children under the age of
5.]{.underline}** **[The Saudi-UAE alliance is also using starvation as
a weapon of war by deliberately targeting the infrastructure of Yemen's
food production and distribution]{.underline}**, **[including the
agricultural sector and fishing industry]{.underline}**. As a result,
**[the war has also left more than 22 million people---75 percent of
Yemen's population---in need of humanitarian aid, and 1.4 million
infected with cholera]{.underline}**. [**The UN estimates that 8.4
million Yemenis are on the brink of starvation and need assistance to
stay alive.**]{.underline} The destruction of Yemen's food supply is
another war crime, which has been documented by human-rights groups that
have investigated Saudi and UAE conduct in the war, including a report
issued in October by Tufts University and the World Peace Foundation.
The report, written by Martha Mundy, an emeritus professor of
anthropology at the London School of Economics, shows that the Saudi
coalition has deliberately targeted food supplies and distribution
systems in an attempt to starve the Houthi-controlled parts of Yemen
into submission. **[Mundy found that, after August 2015, when it became
clear to the Saudi coalition that it would not achieve a quick military
victory---the kind of triumph promised by bin Salman and bin
Zayed---"there appears a shift from military and governmental to
civilian and economic targets,]{.underline}** including water and
transport infrastructure, food production and distribution, roads and
transport, schools, cultural monuments, clinics and hospitals, and
houses, fields, and flocks." The report makes clear that the coalition
is targeting food supplies by destroying agricultural land and fishing
vessels---a war crime under international humanitarian law. For example,
the report notes that, from the start of the war through December 2017,
the coalition destroyed at least 220 fishing boats along Yemen's Red Sea
coast, killed 146 fishermen, and reduced fish catches by at least half
from pre-war levels. Saudi Arabia and the UAE are not the only states
potentially implicated in war crimes. By the summer of 2015, some US
officials were worried that American support to the Saudis---including
weapons sales, intelligence support, assistance in identifying targets,
and the mid-air refueling of Saudi and allied warplanes---would make the
United States a co-belligerent in the war under international law. That
means US personnel could be implicated in war crimes and, in theory,
could be exposed to international prosecution**[. By late 2015, Reuters
reported, Obama administration officials had debated for
months]{.underline}** **[whether to proceed with arms sales to Saudi
Arabia, which was becoming Washington's largest weapons
customer]{.underline}**. American officials were particularly worried
about a 2012 ruling from an international tribunal that convicted
Charles Taylor, Liberia's former president, for "aiding and abetting"
war crimes committed by rebels in neighboring Sierra Leone in the 1990s.
The tribunal ruled that an individual could be guilty of "aiding and
abetting" if he provided "practical assistance, encouragement, or moral
support which had a substantial effect on the perpetration of a crime."
Yet, despite those concerns, [**in November 2015, State Department
officials approved the sale of nearly \$1.3 billion in bombs and
missiles to replenish Saudi munitions dropped in Yemen.**]{.underline}
In October 2016, the Saudi coalition bombed a community hall in Sanaa,
where mourners had gathered for a funeral, killing at least 140 people
and wounding hundreds---the deadliest attack of the war. **[As
international condemnation mounted, the Obama administration promised to
review its military support for Saudi Arabia and its allies in Yemen.
Human]{.underline}** Rights Watch found that the Saudi coalition used an
American-made 500-pound laser-guided bomb in the attack, which it called
"an apparent war crime." In a follow-up letter, the group urged Obama to
halt all weapons sales to Saudi Arabia and warned, "The repeated use of
US-manufactured munitions in unlawful attacks in Yemen could make the US
complicit for future transfers of arms to Saudi forces." Representative
Ted Lieu, the former military lawyer who has been a leading critic in
Congress of American involvement in Yemen, wrote to then--Secretary of
State John Kerry warning of potential US complicity in war crimes. "The
Charles Taylor case precedent puts US officials at risk of being
implicated in aiding and abetting war crimes in Yemen," Lieu wrote in
October 2016. "In addition, under both international law and U.S. law,
American officials can be prosecuted for conspiring to commit war
crimes." **[Despite these warnings, Obama essentially gave the Saudis a
slap on the wrist: He suspended the sale of about \$350 million in
munitions and directed the Pentagon to stop sharing some
intelligence]{.underline}**. O**[nce Trump took office in 2017, he
reversed Obama's decision on the weapons sale and escalated US military
involvement in Yemen. And the Trump administration dismissed worries
about US exposure to war crimes.]{.underline}** Instead, **[Trump and
some of his top administration officials, especially Pompeo and
national-security adviser John Bolton, accepted the Saudi and Emirati
line that Yemen is an extension of the campaign to contain Iran's
regional influence]{.underline}**. (While the Saudis were quick to label
the Shiite Houthis as agents of Iran, the group did not receive
significant help from Tehran before the Saudi intervention.) As
criticism of Saudi Arabia increased in Congress after Saudi agents
murdered Jamal Khashoggi last October, the Trump administration took a
step to appease members of Congress critical of the US role in Yemen. In
November, the administration announced it was ending one element of US
military assistance: the refueling of Saudi and UAE warplanes bombing
Yemen. But that's not enough to end the war. In addition to refueling
warplanes and providing intelligence assistance, **[Washington has
rushed billions of dollars' worth of missiles, bombs, and spare parts to
help the Saudi and UAE militaries continue their bombing
campaign.]{.underline}** [**But neither the Obama nor Trump
administrations put enough pressure on the Saudis or Emiratis to
negotiate a political settlement with the Houthis to end the
war.**]{.underline} Two days after Trump announced his decision to end
the mid-air refueling, a group of 30 former senior officials in the
Obama administration---including former national-security adviser Susan
Rice and former CIA director John Brennan---released a letter
acknowledging some responsibility for initiating American support for
the Saudi coalition. "We did not intend US support to the coalition to
become a blank check. But today, as civilian casualties have continued
to rise and there is no end to the conflict in sight, it is clear that
is precisely what happened," the former officials wrote, adding,
"However, rather than learning from that failure, [**the Trump
administration has doubled down on support for the Saudi leadership's
prosecution of the war, while removing restrictions we had put in
place.... It is past time for America's role in this disastrous war in
Yemen to end."**]{.underline} The former Obama administration officials
exaggerated how many constraints they had put on the Saudis and avoided
responsibility for not acting far more forcefully sooner. The Obama
administration could have ended weapons sales and other military
assistance long before the tentative steps it took in late 2016. But
these former officials are right about one thing: **[Trump has given
Saudi Arabia and the UAE an even bigger blank check in Yemen---and he's
made the United States more deeply complicit in war
crimes.]{.underline}**

#### Yemen war escalates to destabilize the Middle East instability -- major powers get drawn in as oil shipments get cut off

**Dorsey 18** (Dorsey, James. "US Spurring Instability in the Middle
East." The Globalist, 3 Aug. 2018,
www.theglobalist.com/middle-east-conflict-oil-united-states/.)

**[Multiple Middle Eastern disputes are threatening to spill out of
control. This is largely due to the changed role of the United
States.]{.underline}** Perceptions of U.S. unreliability were initially
sparked by former U.S. president Barack Obama's Middle East policies.
This included his declared pivot to Asia, support of the 2011 Arab
popular revolts, criticism of Israel as well as willingness to engage
with Iran. Trump's partisan approach [**Donald Trump has proven to be
more partisan than Mr. Obama in his backing of the UAE, Saudi Arabia and
Israel and his confrontational approach of Iran.**]{.underline} Although
Trump appears to have granted Middle Eastern partners near
carte-**[blanche, his mercurial unpredictability has made him no less
unreliable even in the perception of the foremost U.S. allies in the
region. Mr. Trump's partisan approach as well as his refusal to reign in
U.S. allies has led to potential escalation of multiple conflicts. This
includes the war in Yemen]{.underline}**, mounting tension in Gaza
between Israel and Hamas, a race for control of ports and military
facilities in the Horn of Africa, Israeli challenging of Iran's presence
in Syria as well as confrontation with Iran. At the same time, the fact
that nations in the region need to fend more for themselves has had some
real consequences. For example, the UAE, driven by a quest to control
ports in the Horn of Africa and create a string of military bases,
together with Saudi Arabia, played a key role in reconciling Ethiopia
and Eritrea after more than two decades of cold war. Looming threat of
conflict [**More often however, U.S. allies appear to be increasingly
locked into pathways that threaten mounting violence, if not outright
military confrontation.** **The recent escalation of the Yemen war that
threatens the free flow of oil with Saudi Arabia halting oil shipments
through the Bab el Mandeb strait and an unverified claim by Houthi
rebels to have targeted Abu Dhabi's international airport constitutes
the latest fallout of U.S. failure.** **Analysts see the halt in oil
shipments as an effort to get major military powers, including the
United States, Europe and Muslim allies like Pakistan and Egypt who have
shied away from sending troops to Yemen, to intervene to defeat the
Houthis. Many of those powers depend on oil shipments through Bab el
Mandeb. The bid to suck them into the Yemen war is an effort to secure a
victory that neither Saudi Arabia or the UAE have been able to achieve
in more than three years of fighting that has devastated
Yemen.**]{.underline} Little wonder that external powers responded
cautiously to the Saudi halt of oil shipments. U.S. and EU spokespeople
said they were aware of the Saudi move.

Portuguese prime minister's turn once again to raise the alarm at the
latest of a series of deadlocked security council sessions on Syria.
"The cold war is back with a vengeance and a difference," Guterres said.
The difference is that it is no longer cold. [American troops are
already a grenade's toss away from Russians and Iranians]{.underline} in
Syria, and this weekend, missiles and planes from the US, UK and France
flew at the Syrian regime. "[**The** mechanisms and **safeguards that
existed to prevent escalation in the past no longer seem**]{.underline}
to be **[present]{.underline}**," the secretary general said. It is
debatable exactly when the world last found itself in such a perilous
situation. Perhaps the 1983 missile standoff in Europe, when a Nato
exercise, Able Archer, almost triggered a panicked nuclear launch by the
Soviet Union. The level of paranoia has not yet reached that pitch, but
other [aspects of the current crisis are arguably more
dangerous.]{.underline} [There is less communication between Washington
and Moscow and there are no longer just two players in the game, but a
jostling scrum of **major powers** in decline and middling powers on the
rise. Pursuing national agendas on such a crowded battlefield without
colliding with others is increasingly hard.]{.underline} The precise
targeting of the Friday night airstrikes was all about avoiding such a
potentially catastrophic collision. But US defence secretary James
Mattis and his generals were reportedly under pressure from the White
House to use the strikes as an opportunity to take a swipe at Iran.
Those temptations are not going to go away, particularly after the
arrival in the White House of John Bolton, a radical hawk on Iran, whose
new position as national security adviser at Trump's ear will echo what
the president is hearing from Israel, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab
Emirates. [In the gravitational pull of these agendas and allies, there
are disturbing echoes of the eve of the first **world
war**]{.underline}. [It has more than a whiff of Sarajevo 1914 -- with
**nuclear weapons** looming not far off stage]{.underline}.

#### Scenario 2: International Law

#### US alignment with Saudi Araba in Yemen bombings violates International Humanitarian Law

**Hathaway et al. 2018** ((Oona A. Hathaway, Aaron Haviland, Srinath
Reddy Kethireddy, and Alyssa T. Yamamoto), Professors of International
Law at Yale Law School \["Yemen: Is the US Breaking the Law?", Harvard
National Security Journal,
<https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3272263>\]) //em\
ILC Article 16, which is understood to reflect customary international
law,^297^ provides that: "A State which aids or assists another State in
the commission of an internationally wrongful act by the latter is
internationally responsible for doing so if: (a) that State does so with
knowledge of the circumstances of the internationally wrongful act; and
(b) the act would be internationally wrongful if committed by that
State."^298^ There is a strong case that U.S. support for the Saudi-led
coalition meets this test. Subsection (b)^299^ is clearly met by U.S.
support for the Saudi-led coalition**[. Any bombings that
indiscriminately violate international humanitarian law would be illegal
if they were conducted by the United States itself,]{.underline}**
rather than by the Saudi-led coalition. It is true that the United
States is not a party to Protocol II of the 1949 Geneva Conventions
governing non- international armed conflicts. However, **[as a matter of
treaty and customary international law, the United States is legally
obligated to follow the full range of international humanitarian law
obligations that apply to parties to a non-international armed conflict.
Notably, these obligations are much broader than those that are subject
to prosecution under the U.S. War Crimes Act.]{.underline}** Subsection
(a) presents more difficulty and requires careful analysis of the
assisting state's (here the U.S.'s) requisite intent. The ILC Commentary
on the Draft Articles, which is meant to provide clarity, unfortunately
does not entirely succeed on this point. In its commentary to Article
16(a), the **[ILC stipulates two related requirements: first, "the
relevant State organ or agency providing aid or assistance must be aware
of the circumstances making the conduct of the assisted State
internationally wrongful;"300 and second, "the aid or assistance must be
given with a view to facilitating the commission of the act, and must
actually do so."301 At first glance, these two requirements may appear
inconsistent.]{.underline}**^302^ They can be reconciled, however, if
the first element is understood to require *knowledge* that the aid or
assistance facilitated an *internationally wrongful act*---that is,
knowledge of the wrongfulness of the action to be taken by the assisted
state. The second condition then would be understood to require *intent*
to facilitate the action taken by the state, even if the state did not
specifically intend that act's wrongfulness. Understood in this way, the
ILC Commentary corresponds relatively closely to the text of Article 16
itself. **[Applying this reading to the Saudi-led campaign, the second
condition outlined above is clearly met: the United States has provided
support to the Saudi-led coalition---including munitions, intelligence,
and mid-air refueling---with a view to facilitating the coalition's
military campaign. As described in earlier sections, this support has,
in fact, facilitated that bombing campaign. This type of aid need not
have been essential to the wrongful act to fall within Article 16; "it
is sufficient if it contributed significantly to that
act.]{.underline}**"^303^ Significance turns on "how the assistance
rendered relates to the wrongful act."^304^ Harriet Moynihan of Chatham
House explains that this "nexus element" has two dimensions: scale and
remoteness.^305^ ILC member Nikolai Ushakov noted during the
Commission's 1978 session: "\[P\]articipation must be active and direct.
It must not be too direct, however, for the participant then becomes a
co-author of the offence, and that \[goes\] beyond complicity. If, on
the other hand, participation \[is\] too indirect, there might be no
real complicity."^306^ **[Regardless of the metric,307 arming and
mid-air refueling undoubtedly qualify as a significant contribution to
the bombing campaign.]{.underline}** **[The harder question is whether
the United States' assistance meets the first requirement--- that the
United States knew that the aid or assistance it provided facilitated an
internationally wrongful act.]{.underline}** As the ILC Commentary puts
it, "\[i\]f the assisting or aiding State is unaware of the
circumstances in which its aid or assistance is intended to be used by
the other State, it bears no international responsibility."^308^ As
noted above, there is some ambiguity in the Commentary as to whether the
assisting state must intend to facilitate the *wrongful* act---that is,
that it not only intends the act to occur but intends for it to occur in
an internationally wrongful manner. A number of commentators have
concluded that "knowledge" is the correct measure.^309^ But there is
disagreement about what knowledge requires. Harriet Moynihan states that
knowledge "means actual or near certain knowledge of specific illegality
on the part of the recipient state."^310^ Intent in this view is
satisfied by "knowledge or virtual certainty that the recipient state
will use the assistance unlawfully."^311^ Ryan Goodman and Miles
Jackson, however, adopt a less stringent test in which mere knowledge of
the circumstances is sufficient: "**[The assisting State has intention
to facilitate and/or knowledge of the circumstances of the
internationally wrongful act]{.underline}**."^312^ **[The United States
is undoubtedly aware that there have been numerous credible allegations
of violations of international humanitarian law (IHL). Therefore, its
support for the Saudi-led coalition almost certainly meets the less
stringent knowledge test; it may also satisfy the more stringent "actual
or near certain knowledge of specific illegality," though that is a
higher bar to clear.]{.underline}**

**[It is now well trodden discourse that the election of Donald
Trump]{.underline}**, like the rise in nationalist movements in Europe,
**[is both creating and reflecting paradigmatic shifts in the way we
view global institutions. These shifts point to pressing concerns for
the international human rights project.]{.underline}** **[The
xenophobic, rights-abusive platform of the Trump campaign put the human
rights community on notice,]{.underline}** and we have assumed a
defensive stance to protect the potential roll-back of hard-won
progress. In the era of Trump, **[we believe the U.S. human rights
community must continue to draw on international human rights law as an
advocacy and accountability tool, partnering with international
movements and actors to stop rhetoric from becoming
reality.]{.underline}** For U.S. scholars, lawyers, policymakers and
activists committed to the defense of human rights, **[the rhetoric and
fledgling policies of the incoming administration have raised strategic
and existential questions]{.underline}**. In this new era, we are
examining and debating critical concerns about the state and utility of
international human rights law, and questioning where to place our
resources. For those of us working within law schools, we face added
questions from students, some of whom feel a crisis of conscience about
where best to stake their social justice careers. **[From our
perspective we must continue to invest in international human
rights.]{.underline}** To begin with, **[we must dispel with the false
dichotomy that pits domestic rights against the international human
rights regime]{.underline}**. **[International human rights norms are
implemented by domestic actors and often embedded in national
constitutions]{.underline}**. And **[human rights abuses are not a
phenomenon that 'happens' abroad, violating the rights of 'others' who
are unconnected to us]{.underline}**. **[The systemic interlinkages in
our globalized world make us common rights-holders]{.underline}**, in
issues spanning trade and the environment, to counter terrorism. **[The
international system exists as a failsafe for local and domestic
efforts. No domestic space is a paradigm of human rights virtue and we
all benefit from the scrutiny of global institutions.]{.underline}**
Granted, **[international human rights law has limited power in U.S.
courts, but it is not impotent. We have seen its persuasive function in
important Supreme Court Cases such as Lawrence v Texas, which struck
down the sodomy law in Texas, and Roper v Simmons, which abolished
capital punishment for people under 18]{.underline}**. **[There is
further work to do in pushing back against American exceptionalism by
both diffusing international norms, and keeping human rights language
and knowledge alive, in the U.S. legal community and
judiciary]{.underline}** -- if anything, **[U.S. human rights activists
have perhaps prematurely given up on the project of making international
human rights law enforceable in U.S. courts.]{.underline}** History
shows that **[human rights violations carry reputational risks, and have
tangible costs for national security and the U.S.'s geopolitical
position.]{.underline}** For instance, **[the Bush-era war on terror and
the torture memos made the U.S. an outlier to established international
law, damaged its moral authority, and fanned the flames of
conflict.]{.underline}** During this period of what may be a redux in
U.S. human rights 'deviance', **[we must fight to limit damage to the
integrity of human rights norms. This requires our continued engagement
with global institutions mandated with international human rights law
protection, to prevent and seek accountability for any new violations,
and to protect against the dismantling of important
gains]{.underline}**. This could include backslides in progress under
international U.S. leadership in the areas of LGBTQI rights, women's
health and reproductive rights, and a strengthened UN Human Rights
Council. Protecting gains also means safeguarding against cuts in U.S.
government support for human rights defenders around the world who are
working with vulnerable people in hostile environments. Finally, we must
demonstrate heterogeneity and dissent in U.S. voices in international
settings, and avoid brain drain and the deskilling of the U.S. human
rights community. For humanistic and principled reasons, concern for
human rights should not follow national borders or be driven by
nationalist impulses. This cuts to the core of our group identity as a
human rights constituency, committed to the foundational principles of
universal application of human rights for all. **[Today's shifting
ground and the risks of a regressive trajectory present an opportunity
to re-double efforts and promote the resonance of international norms
domestically]{.underline}**. **[Now, more than ever, work needs to be
done to bring the U.S. into a larger comparative
framework]{.underline}**. **[Human rights actors are needed in both
domestic and international institutions to serve as critical,
reinforcing bridges between these two arenas.]{.underline}**

#### US human rights credibility key to democracy worldwide

**Griffey 11** (Brian, human rights consultant who has worked for the
United Nations, Human Rights Watch, Amnesty International USA. \["U.S.
leadership on human rights essential to strengthen democracy abroad" The
Hill March 18^th^, 2011 Congress Blog URL:
http://thehill.com/blogs/congress-blog/foreign-policy/150667-us-leadership-on-human-rights-essential-to-strengthen-democracy-abroad)

In the midst of what many are calling the Arab world's 1989, the
**[United States has a chance to revisit]{.underline}** that effort,
**[and reaffirm President Carter's declaration: "Human rights is the
soul of our foreign policy, because human rights is the soul of our
sense of nationhood]{.underline}**." Since helping to establish the
United Nations, **[U.S. participation in international human rights
treaties and mechanisms has been fraught with debate over the merits of
involvement and perceived threats to U.S. policymaking
prerogative]{.underline}**, topics still contentious on Capitol Hill.
Nonetheless, **[U.S. leadership on human rights offers clear
opportunities to advance not only international peace and security -- a
fundamental purpose of the U.N. -- but also conjoined US political and
economic interests at home and abroad]{.underline}**. The U.S. is
presently demonstrating exactly how crucial such involvement is as an
elected member of the Human Rights Council, participating in vital
negotiations on how best to mitigate widespread abuses responding to
ongoing unrest in the Middle East and North Africa, including by
strategic US allies in global security and trade. As Secretary Clinton
expressed en route to Geneva to participate in recent talks on human
rights violations in Libya, **[joining the Council has "proven to be a
good decision, because we've been able to influence a number of actions
that we otherwise would have been on the outside looking in." In its
first submission to the body, the U.S. likewise recognized that
participation in the Council's peer-review system allows the U.S. not
only to lead by example and "encourage others to strengthen their
commitments to human rights," but also to address domestic human rights
shortcomings]{.underline}**. By leading international discourse on human
rights, **[the U.S. will be in a better position both to advance
observation of human rights abroad, and to take on new treaty
commitments that demonstrate adherence of our own system to the vaulting
principles we identify with our democracy]{.underline}**. While the U.S.
is party to more than 12,000 treaties, it has dodged most human rights
treaties drafted since World War II through the U.N., and has ratified
only a dozen. Upon transmission of four core human rights treaties to
the Senate in 1978, President Carter observed: "Our failure to become a
party increasingly reflects upon our attainments, and prejudices United
States participation in the development of the international law of
human rights." The Senate ratified two of those treaties 15 years later.
The others continue to languish in the Senate Foreign Relations
Committee, still awaiting ratification after 32 years. It likewise took
the Senate almost 40 years to approve a treaty punishing genocide, after
signing it in 1948 following the Holocaust. **[Other human rights
treaties U.S. presidents have signed -- but the Senate has yet to agree
to -- include U.N. conventions protecting the rights of women, children,
and persons with disabilities. The U.S. is the only nation in the world
that hasn't ratified the Convention on the Rights of the Child, with the
exception of war-torn Somalia, which lacks a functioning government and
control over much of its territory.]{.underline}** As we watch the
contours and nature of power being reshaped in the Middle East and North
Africa, the U.S. must have a singular message on human rights -- both at
home and abroad**[: Human rights go hand-in-hand with a healthy
democracy, and demand a concerted and collective effort to be upheld,
especially in times of crisis. Greater U.S. participation in U.N. human
rights treaties would ensure that the country has not only a seat at the
table, but also an authoritative voice on matters vital to advancing
democracy abroad, and our national security. A welcome consequence would
be a more prominent place for the human rights lens in our vision of
U.S. democracy -- and perhaps a stronger resolve to ameliorate the
plights of those least well off in our own society.]{.underline}**

#### US democracy credibility prevents global democratic backsliding

**Kagan 15** (Robert, Senior Fellow, Foreign Policy, Project on
International Order and Security, Jan, \"Is Democracy in Decline? The
Weight of Geopolitics\" Brookings Institution,
[www.brookings.edu/research/articles/2015/01/democracy-in-decline-weight-of-geopolitics-kagan](http://www.brookings.edu/research/articles/2015/01/democracy-in-decline-weight-of-geopolitics-kagan))

These are relevant questions again. **[We live in a time
when]{.underline}** democratic nations are in retreat in the realm of
geopolitics, and when **[democracy]{.underline}** itself
**[is]{.underline}** also **[in retreat.]{.underline}**
**[The]{.underline}** latter **[phenomenon has been well documented by
Freedom House]{.underline}**, which has recorded declines in freedom in
the world for nine straight years. At the level of geopolitics, the
shifting tectonic plates have yet to produce a seismic rearrangement of
power, but rumblings are audible. The United States has been in a state
of retrenchment since President Barack Obama took office in 2009. The
democratic nations of Europe, which some might have expected to pick up
the slack, have instead turned inward and all but abandoned earlier
dreams of reshaping the international system in their image. **[As for
such rising democracies as Brazil, India, Turkey, and South Africa, they
are neither rising as fast as once anticipated nor yet behaving as
democracies in world affairs.]{.underline}** Their focus remains narrow
and regional. Their national identities remain shaped by postcolonial
and nonaligned sensibilities---by old but carefully nursed
resentments---which lead them, for instance, to shield rather than
condemn autocratic Russia's invasion of democratic Ukraine, or, in the
case of Brazil, to prefer the company of Venezuelan dictators to that of
North American democratic presidents. Meanwhile, insofar as there is
**[energy in the international system]{.underline}**, it **[comes from
the great-power autocracies]{.underline}**, **[China and
Russia]{.underline}**, **[and]{.underline}** from **[would-be
theocrats]{.underline}** pursuing their dream of a new caliphate in the
Middle East. For all their many problems and weaknesses, **[it
is]{.underline}** still **[these autocracies and]{.underline}** these
aspiring **[religious totalitarians that push forward while the
democracies draw back]{.underline}**, that act while the democracies
react, and that seem increasingly unleashed while the democracies feel
increasingly constrained. It should not be surprising that **[one of
the]{.underline}** side **[effects of these circumstances has been the
weakening and]{.underline}** in some cases **[collapse of democracy in
those places where it was newest and weakest.]{.underline}**
Geopolitical shifts among the reigning great powers, often but not
always the result of wars, can have significant effects on the domestic
politics of the smaller and weaker nations of the world. **[Global
democratizing trends have been stopped and reversed before. Consider the
interwar years. In 1920, when the number of democracies in the world had
doubled in the aftermath of the First World War,
contemporaries]{.underline}** such as the British historian James Bryce
**[believed that they were witnessing "a natural trend, due to a general
law of social progress."]{.underline}**\[1\] **[Yet almost immediately
the new democracies in Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, and Poland began to
fall.]{.underline}** Europe's democratic great powers, France and
Britain, were suffering the effects of the recent devastating war, while
the one rich and healthy democratic power, the United States, had
retreated to the safety of its distant shores. In the vacuum came
Mussolini's rise to power in Italy in 1922, the crumbling of Germany's
Weimar Republic, and the broader triumph of European fascism. Greek
democracy fell in 1936. Spanish democracy fell to Franco that same year.
Military coups overthrew democratic governments in Portugal, Brazil,
Uruguay, and Argentina. Japan's shaky democracy succumbed to military
rule and then to a form of fascism. Across three continents, fragile
democracies gave way to authoritarian forces exploiting the
vulnerabilities of the democratic system, while other democracies fell
prey to the worldwide economic depression. There was a ripple effect,
too---the success of fascism in one country strengthened similar
movements elsewhere, sometimes directly. Spanish fascists received
military assistance from the fascist regimes in Germany and Italy. The
result was that by 1939 the democratic gains of the previous forty years
had been wiped out. The period after the First World War showed not only
that democratic gains could be reversed, but that democracy need not
always triumph even in the competition of ideas. For **[it was not just
that democracies had been overthrown]{.underline}**. **[The very idea of
democracy had been "discredited,"]{.underline}** as John A. Hobson
observed.\[2\] Democracy's aura of inevitability vanished as great
numbers of people rejected the idea that it was a better form of
government. Human beings, after all, do not yearn only for freedom,
autonomy, individuality, and recognition. Especially in times of
difficulty, they yearn also for comfort, security, order, and,
importantly, a sense of belonging to something larger than themselves,
something that submerges autonomy and individuality---all of which
autocracies can sometimes provide, or at least appear to provide, better
than democracies. In the 1920s and 1930s, the fascist governments looked
stronger, more energetic and efficient, and more capable of providing
reassurance in troubled times. They appealed effectively to nationalist,
ethnic, and tribal sentiments. The many weaknesses of Germany's Weimar
democracy, inadequately supported by the democratic great powers, and of
the fragile and short-lived democracies of Italy and Spain made their
people susceptible to the appeals of the Nazis, Mussolini, and Franco,
just as the weaknesses of Russian democracy in the 1990s made a more
authoritarian government under Vladimir Putin attractive to many
Russians. People tend to follow winners, and between the wars the
democratic-capitalist countries looked weak and in retreat compared with
the apparently vigorous fascist regimes and with Stalin's Soviet Union.
**[It took a second world war and]{.underline}** another **[military
victory by the Allied democracies]{.underline}** (plus the Soviet Union)
**[to reverse the trend]{.underline}** again. The United States imposed
democracy by force and through prolonged occupations in West Germany,
Italy, Japan, Austria, and South Korea. With the victory of the
democracies and the discrediting of fascism---chiefly on the
battlefield---many other countries followed suit. Greece and Turkey both
moved in a democratic direction, as did Brazil, Argentina, Peru,
Ecuador, Venezuela, and Colombia. Some of the new nations born as Europe
shed its colonies also experimented with democratic government, the most
prominent example being India. By 1950, the number of democracies had
grown to between twenty and thirty, and they governed close to 40
percent of the world's population. Was this the victory of an idea or
the victory of arms? Was it the product of an inevitable human evolution
or, as Samuel P. Huntington later observed, of "historically discrete
events"?\[3\] We would prefer to believe the former, but evidence
suggests the latter, for **[it turned out that even the great wave of
democracy following World War II was not irreversible. Another "reverse
wave" hit from the late 1950s through the early 1970s.]{.underline}**
Peru, Brazil, Argentina, Bolivia, Chile, Uruguay, Ecuador, South Korea,
the Philippines, Pakistan, Indonesia, and Greece all fell back under
authoritarian rule. In Africa, Nigeria was the most prominent of the
newly decolonized nations where democracy failed. By 1975, more than
three-dozen governments around the world had been installed by military
coups.\[4\] Few spoke of democracy's inevitability in the 1970s or even
in the early 1980s. As late as 1984, Huntington himself believed that
"the limits of democratic development in the world" had been reached,
noting the "unreceptivity to democracy of several major cultural
traditions," as well as "the substantial power of antidemocratic
governments (particularly the Soviet Union)."\[5\] **[But
then]{.underline}**, unexpectedly, **[came the "third wave." From the
mid-1970s through the early 1990s, the number of democracies in the
world rose to an astonishing 120, representing well over half the
world's population. What explained the prolonged success of
democratization over the last quarter of the twentieth
century?]{.underline}** It could not have been merely the steady rise of
the global economy and the general yearning for freedom, autonomy, and
recognition. Neither economic growth nor human yearnings had prevented
the democratic reversals of the 1960s and early 1970s. Until the third
wave, many nations around the world careened back and forth between
democracy and authoritarianism in a cyclical, almost predictable manner.
What was most notable about the third wave was that this cyclical
alternation between democracy and autocracy was interrupted. Nations
moved into a democratic phase and stayed there. But why? The
International Climate Improves The answer is related to the
configuration of power and ideas in the world. The international climate
from the mid-1970s onward was simply more hospitable to democracies and
more challenging to autocratic governments than had been the case in
past eras. In his study, Huntington emphasized the change, following the
Second Vatican Council, in the Catholic Church's doctrine regarding
order and revolution, which tended to weaken the legitimacy of
authoritarian governments in Catholic countries. The growing success and
attractiveness of the European Community (EC), meanwhile, had an impact
on the internal policies of nations such as Portugal, Greece, and Spain,
which sought the economic benefits of membership in the EC and therefore
felt pressure to conform to its democratic norms. These norms
increasingly became international norms. But they did not appear out of
nowhere or as the result of some natural evolution of the human species.
As Huntington noted, "**[The pervasiveness of democratic norms rested in
large part on the commitment to those norms of the most powerful country
in the world]{.underline}**.\[6\] **[The U]{.underline}**nited
**[S]{.underline}**tates, in fact, **[played a critical role in making
the explosion of democracy possible]{.underline}**. This was not because
U.S. policy makers consistently promoted democracy around the world.
They did not. At various times throughout the Cold War, U.S. policy
often supported dictatorships as part of the battle against communism or
simply out of indifference. It even permitted or was complicit in the
overthrow of democratic regimes deemed unreliable---those of Mohammad
Mossadegh in Iran in 1953, Jacobo Arbenz in Guatemala in 1954, and
Salvador Allende in Chile in 1973. At times, U.S. foreign policy was
almost hostile to democracy. President Richard Nixon regarded it as "not
necessarily the best form of government for people in Asia, Africa, and
Latin America."\[7\] Nor, when the United States did support democracy,
was it purely out of fealty to principle. Often it was for strategic
reasons. Officials in President Ronald Reagan's administration came to
believe that democratic governments might actually be better than
autocracies at fending off communist insurgencies, for instance. And
often it was popular local demands that compelled the United States to
make a choice that it would otherwise have preferred to avoid, between
supporting an unpopular and possibly faltering dictatorship and "getting
on the side of the people." Reagan would have preferred to support the
dictatorship of Ferdinand Marcos in the 1980s had he not been confronted
by the moral challenge of Filipino "people power." Rarely if ever did
the United States seek a change of regime primarily out of devotion to
democratic principles. Beginning in the mid-1970s, however, the general
inclination of the United States did begin to shift toward a more
critical view of dictatorship. The U.S. Congress, led by human-rights
advocates, began to condition or cut off U.S. aid to authoritarian
allies, which weakened their hold on power. In the Helsinki Accords of
1975, a reference to human-rights issues drew greater attention to the
cause of dissidents and other opponents of dictatorship in the Eastern
bloc. President Jimmy Carter focused attention on the human-rights
abuses of the Soviet Union as well as of right-wing governments in Latin
America and elsewhere. The U.S. government's international information
services, including the Voice of America and Radio Free Europe/Radio
Liberty, put greater emphasis on democracy and human rights in their
programming. The Reagan administration, after first trying to roll back
Carter's human-rights agenda, eventually embraced it and made the
promotion of democracy part of its stated (if not always its actual)
policy. Even during this period, U.S. policy was far from consistent.
Many allied dictatorships, especially in the Middle East, were not only
tolerated but actively supported with U.S. economic and military aid.
But the net effect of the shift in U.S. policy, joined with the efforts
of Europe, was significant. The third wave began in 1974 in Portugal,
where the Carnation Revolution put an end to a half-century of
dictatorship. As Larry Diamond notes, this revolution did not just
happen. The United States and the European democracies played a key
role, making a "heavy investment . . . in support of the democratic
parties."\[8\] Over the next decade and a half, the United States used a
variety of tools, including direct military intervention, to aid
democratic transitions and prevent the undermining of existing fragile
democracies all across the globe. In 1978, Carter threatened military
action in the Dominican Republic when long-serving president Joaquín
Balaguer refused to give up power after losing an election. In 1983,
Reagan's invasion of Grenada restored a democratic government after a
military coup. In 1986, the United States threatened military action to
prevent Marcos from forcibly annulling an election that he had lost. In
1989, President George H.W. Bush invaded Panama to help install
democracy after military strongman Manuel Noriega had annulled his
nation's elections. Throughout this period, too, the United States used
its influence to block military coups in Honduras, Bolivia, El Salvador,
Peru, and South Korea. Elsewhere it urged presidents not to try staying
in office beyond constitutional limits. Huntington estimated that over
the course of about a decade and a half, U.S. support had been "critical
to democratization in the Dominican Republic, Grenada, El Salvador,
Guatemala, Honduras, Uruguay, Peru, Ecuador, Panama, and the
Philippines" and was "a contributing factor to democratization in
Portugal, Chile, Poland, Korea, Bolivia, and Taiwan."\[9\] Many
developments both global and local helped to produce the democratizing
trend of the late 1970s and the 1980s, and there might have been a
democratic wave even if the United States had not been so influential.
The question is whether the wave would have been as large and as
lasting. The stable zones of democracy in Europe and Japan proved to be
powerful magnets. The liberal free-market and free-trade system
increasingly outperformed the stagnating economies of the socialist
bloc, especially at the dawn of the information revolution. The greater
activism of the United States, together with that of other successful
democracies, helped to build a broad, if not universal, consensus that
was more sympathetic to democratic forms of government and less
sympathetic to authoritarian forms. **[Diamond and others have noted how
important it was that these "global democratic norms" came to be
"reflected in regional and international institutions and agreements as
never before."\[]{.underline}**10\] **[Those norms had an impact on the
internal political processes of countries, making it harder for
authoritarians to weather political and economic storms and easier for
democratic movements to gain legitimacy.]{.underline}** But "norms" are
transient as well. **[In the 1930s, the trendsetting nations were
fascist dictatorships. In the 1950s and 1960s, variants of socialism
were in vogue. But from the 1970s until recently, the
U]{.underline}**nited **[S]{.underline}**tates and a handful of other
democratic powers **[set the fashion trend]{.underline}**. They
pushed---some might even say imposed---democratic principles and
embedded them in international institutions and agreements. Equally
important was the role that the United States played in preventing
backsliding away from democracy where it had barely taken root.
**[Perhaps the most significant U.S. contribution was simply to prevent
military coups against fledgling democratic governments.]{.underline}**
In a sense, the United States was interfering in what might have been a
natural cycle, preventing nations that ordinarily would have been "due"
for an authoritarian phase from following the usual pattern. **[It was
not that the U]{.underline}**nited **[S]{.underline}**tates **[was
exporting democracy everywhere. More often, it played the role of
"catcher in the rye"---preventing young democracies from falling off the
cliff]{.underline}**---in places such as the Philippines, Colombia, and
Panama. This helped to give the third wave unprecedented breadth and
durability. Finally, there was the collapse of the Soviet Union and with
it the fall of Central and Eastern Europe's communist regimes and their
replacement by democracies. What role the United States played in
hastening the Soviet downfall may be in dispute, but surely it played
some part, both by containing the Soviet empire militarily and by
outperforming it economically and technologically. And at the heart of
the struggle were the peoples of the former Warsaw Pact countries
themselves. They had long yearned to achieve the liberation of their
respective nations from the Soviet Union, which also meant liberation
from communism. These peoples wanted to join the rest of Europe, which
offered an economic and social model that was even more attractive than
that of the United States. That Central and East Europeans uniformly
chose democratic forms of government, however, was not simply the fruit
of aspirations for freedom or comfort. It also reflected the desires of
these peoples to place themselves under the U.S. security umbrella. The
strategic, the economic, the political, and the ideological were thus
inseparable. Those nations that wanted to be part of NATO, and later of
the European Union, knew that they would stand no chance of admission
without democratic credentials. These democratic transitions, which
turned the third wave into a democratic tsunami, need not have occurred
had the world been configured differently. That a democratic, united,
and prosperous Western Europe was even there to exert a powerful
magnetic pull on its eastern neighbors was due to U.S. actions after
World War II. The Lost Future of 1848 Contrast the fate of democratic
movements in the late twentieth century with that of the liberal
revolutions that swept Europe in 1848. Beginning in France, the
"Springtime of the Peoples," as it was known, included liberal reformers
and constitutionalists, nationalists, and representatives of the rising
middle class as well as radical workers and socialists. In a matter of
weeks, they toppled kings and princes and shook thrones in France,
Poland, Austria, and Romania, as well as the Italian peninsula and the
German principalities. In the end, however, the liberal movements
failed, partly because they lacked cohesion, but also because the
autocratic powers forcibly crushed them. The Prussian army helped to
defeat liberal movements in the German lands, while the Russian czar
sent his troops into Romania and Hungary. Tens of thousands of
protesters were killed in the streets of Europe. The sword proved
mightier than the pen. It mattered that the more liberal powers, Britain
and France, adopted a neutral posture throughout the liberal ferment,
even though France's own revolution had sparked and inspired the
pan-European movement. The British monarchy and aristocracy were afraid
of radicalism at home. Both France and Britain were more concerned with
preserving peace among the great powers than with providing assistance
to fellow liberals. The preservation of the European balance among the
five great powers benefited the forces of counterrevolution everywhere,
and the Springtime of the Peoples was suppressed.\[11\] As a result, for
several decades the forces of reaction in Europe were strengthened
against the forces of liberalism. Scholars have speculated about how
differently Europe and the world might have evolved had the liberal
revolutions of 1848 succeeded: How might German history have unfolded
had national unification been achieved under a liberal parliamentary
system rather than under the leadership of Otto von Bismarck? The "Iron
Chancellor" unified the nation not through elections and debates, but
through military victories won by the great power of the conservative
Prussian army under the Hohenzollern dynasty. As the historian A.J.P.
Taylor observed, history reached a turning point in 1848, but Germany
"failed to turn."\[12\] Might Germans have learned a different lesson
from the one that Bismarck taught---namely, that "the great questions of
the age are not decided by speeches and majority decisions . . . but by
blood and iron"?\[13\] Yet the international system of the day was not
configured in such a way as to encourage liberal and democratic change.
The European balance of power in the mid-nineteenth century did not
favor democracy, and so it is not surprising that democracy failed to
triumph anywhere.\[14\] We can also speculate about how differently
today's world might have evolved without the U.S. role in shaping an
international environment favorable to democracy, and how it might
evolve should the United States find itself no longer strong enough to
play that role. Democratic transitions are not inevitable, even where
the conditions may be ripe. Nations may enter a transition
zone---economically, socially, and politically---where the probability
of moving in a democratic direction increases or decreases. But foreign
influences, usually exerted by the reigning great powers, often
determine which direction change takes. Strong authoritarian powers
willing to support conservative forces against liberal movements can
undo what might otherwise have been a "natural" evolution to democracy,
just as powerful democratic nations can help liberal forces that, left
to their own devices, might otherwise fail. In the 1980s as in the
1840s, liberal movements arose for their own reasons in different
countries, but their success or failure was influenced by the balance of
power at the international level. In the era of U.S. predominance, the
balance was generally favorable to democracy, which helps to explain why
the liberal revolutions of that later era succeeded. Had the United
States not been so powerful, there would have been fewer transitions to
democracy, and those that occurred might have been short-lived. It might
have meant a shallower and more easily reversed third wave.\[15\]
Democracy, Autocracy, and Power What about today? With the democratic
superpower curtailing its global influence, regional powers are setting
the tone in their respective regions. Not surprisingly, dictatorships
are more common in the environs of Russia, along the borders of China
(North Korea, Burma, and Thailand), and in the Middle East, where long
dictatorial traditions have so far mostly withstood the challenge of
popular uprisings. But even in regions where democracies remain strong,
authoritarians have been able to make a determined stand while their
democratic neighbors passively stand by. Thus Hungary's leaders, in the
heart of an indifferent Europe, proclaim their love of illiberalism and
crack down on press and political freedoms while the rest of the
European Union, supposedly a club for democracies only, looks away. In
South America, democracy is engaged in a contest with dictatorship, but
an indifferent Brazil looks on, thinking only of trade and of North
American imperialism. Meanwhile in Central America, next door to an
indifferent Mexico, democracy collapses under the weight of drugs and
crime and the resurgence of the caudillos. Yet it may be unfair to blame
regional powers for not doing what they have never done. Insofar as the
shift in the geopolitical equation has affected the fate of democracies
worldwide, it is probably the change in the democratic superpower's
behavior that bears most of the responsibility. **[If that superpower
does not change its course,]{.underline}** **[we are likely to see
democracy around the world rolled back further.]{.underline}** **[There
is nothing inevitable about democracy]{.underline}**. The liberal world
order we have been living in these past decades was not bequeathed by
"the Laws of Nature and of Nature's God." It is not the endpoint of
human progress. There are those who would prefer a world order different
from the liberal one. Until now, however, they have not been able to
have their way, but not because their ideas of governance are impossible
to enact. Who is to say that Putinism in Russia or China's particular
brand of authoritarianism will not survive as far into the future as
European democracy, which, after all, is less than a century old on most
of the continent? Autocracy in Russia and China has certainly been
around longer than any Western democracy. Indeed, it is autocracy, not
democracy, that has been the norm in human history---only in recent
decades have the democracies, led by the United States, had the power to
shape the world. Skeptics of U.S. "democracy promotion" have long argued
that many of the places where the democratic experiment has been tried
over the past few decades are not a natural fit for that form of
government, and that the United States has tried to plant democracy in
some very infertile soils. Given that democratic governments have taken
deep root in widely varying circumstances, from impoverished India to
"Confucian" East Asia to Islamic Indonesia, we ought to have some
modesty about asserting where the soil is right or not right for
democracy. Yet it should be clear that the prospects for democracy have
been much better under the protection of a liberal world order,
supported and defended by a democratic superpower or by a collection of
democratic great powers. Today, as always, democracy is a fragile
flower. It requires constant support, constant tending, and the plucking
of weeds and fencing-off of the jungle that threaten it both from within
and without. In the absence of such efforts, the jungle and the weeds
may sooner or later come back to reclaim the land.

#### Democracy solves nuclear war

**Muravchick 1** (Resident Scholar -- American Enterprise Institute
\[Joshua, "Democracy and Nuclear Peace," 7-11-01, Presented before the
NPEC/IGCC Summer Faculty Seminar, UC-San Diego,
[www.npec-web.org/syllabi/muravchik.htm](http://www.npec-web.org/syllabi/muravchik.htm))

**[The greatest impetus for world peace \-- and perforce of nuclear
peace \-- is the spread of democracy]{.underline}**. In a famous
article, and subsequent book, Francis Fukuyama argued that democracy\'s
extension was leading to \"the end of history.\" By this he meant the
conclusion of man\'s quest for the right social order, but he also meant
the \"diminution of the likelihood of large-scale conflict between
states.\"1Fukuyama\'s phrase was intentionally provocative, even
tongue-in-cheek, but he was pointing to two down-to-earth historical
observations: that [democracies are more peaceful than other kinds of
government]{.underline} and that the world is growing more democratic.
Neither point has gone unchallenged. Only a few decades ago, as
distinguished an observer of international relations as George Kennan
made a claim quite contrary to the first of these assertions.
Democracies, he said, were slow to anger, but once aroused \"a democracy
\... fights in anger \... to the bitter end.\"2 Kennan\'s view was
strongly influenced by the policy of \"unconditional surrender\" pursued
in World War II. But subsequent experience, such as the negotiated
settlements America sought in Korea and Vietnam proved him wrong.
**[Democracies are not only slow to anger but also quick to
compromise]{.underline}**. And to forgive. Notwithstanding the
insistence on unconditional surrender, America treated Japan and that
part of Germany that it occupied with extraordinary generosity. In
recent years a burgeoning literature has discussed the peacefulness of
democracies. Indeed **[the proposition that democracies do not go to war
with one another has been described by one political scientist as being
\"as close as anything we have to an empirical law in international
relations]{.underline}**.\"[3Some of those who find enthusiasm for
democracy off- putting have challenged this proposition, but their
challenges have only served as empirical tests that have confirmed its
robustness**.**]{.underline} For example, the academic Paul Gottfried
and the columnist-turned-politician Patrick J. Buchanan have both
instanced democratic England\'s declaration of war against democratic
Finland during World War II.4 In fact, after much procrastination,
England did accede to the pressure of its Soviet ally to declare war
against Finland which was allied with Germany. But the declaration was
purely formal: no fighting ensued between England and Finland. Surely
this is an exception that proves the rule. The strongest exception I can
think of is the war between the nascent state of Israel and the Arabs in
1948. Israel was an embryonic democracy and Lebanon, one of the Arab
belligerents, was also democratic within the confines of its peculiar
confessional division of power. Lebanon, however, was a reluctant party
to the fight. Within the councils of the Arab League, it opposed the war
but went along with its larger confreres when they opted to attack. Even
so, Lebanon did little fighting and soon sued for peace. Thus, in the
case of Lebanon against Israel, as in the case of England against
Finland, democracies nominally went to war against democracies when they
were dragged into conflicts by authoritarian allies. The political
scientist Bruce Russett offers a different challenge to the notion that
democracies are more peaceful. \"That democracies are in general, in
dealing with all kinds of states, more peaceful than are authoritarian
or other non- democratically constituted states \... is a much more
controversial proposition than \'merely\' that democracies are peaceful
in their dealings with each other, and one for which there is little
systematic evidence,\" he says.5Russett cites his own and other
statistical explorations which show that while democracies rarely fight
one another they often fight against others. The trouble with such
studies, however, is that they rarely examine the question of who
started or caused a war. To reduce the data to a form that is
quantitatively measurable, it is easier to determine whether a conflict
has occurred between two states than whose fault it was. But the latter
question is all important. Democracies may often go to war against
dictatorships because the dictators see them as prey or underestimate
their resolve. Indeed, such examples abound. Germany might have behaved
more cautiously in the summer of 1914 had it realized that England would
fight to vindicate Belgian neutrality and to support France. Later,
Hitler was emboldened by his notorious contempt for the flabbiness of
the democracies. North Korea almost surely discounted the likelihood of
an American military response to its invasion of the South after
Secretary of State Dean Acheson publicly defined America\'s defense
perimeter to exclude the Korean peninsula (a declaration which merely
confirmed existing U.S. policy). In 1990, Saddam Hussein\'s decision to
swallow Kuwait was probably encouraged by the inference he must have
taken from the statements and actions of American officials that
Washington would offer no forceful resistance. Russett says that those
who claim democracies are in general more peaceful \"would have us
believe that the United States was regularly on the defensive, rarely on
the offensive, during the Cold War.\"6 But that is not quite right: the
word \"regularly\" distorts the issue. A victim can sometimes turn the
tables on an aggressor, but that does not make the victim equally
bellicose. None would dispute that Napoleon was responsible for the
Napoleonic wars or Hitler for World War II in Europe, but after a time
their victims seized the offensive. So in the Cold War, the United
States may have initiated some skirmishes (although in fact it rarely
did), but the struggle as a whole was driven one-sidedly. The Soviet
policy was \"class warfare\"; the American policy was \"containment.\"
The so-called revisionist historians argued that America bore an equal
or larger share of responsibility for the conflict. But Mikhail
Gorbachev made nonsense of their theories when, in the name of glasnost
and perestroika, he turned the Soviet Union away from its historic
course. The Cold War ended almost instantly\--as he no doubt knew it
would. \"We would have been able to avoid many \... difficulties if the
democratic process had developed normally in our country,\" he wrote.7
To render judgment about the relative peacefulness of states or systems,
we must ask not only who started a war but why. In particular we should
consider what in Catholic Just War doctrine is called \"right
intention,\" which means roughly: what did they hope to get out of it?
In the few cases in recent times in which wars were initiated by
democracies, there were often motives other than aggrandizement, for
example, when America invaded Grenada. To be sure, Washington was
impelled by self-interest more than altruism, primarily its concern for
the well-being of American nationals and its desire to remove a chip,
however tiny, from the Soviet game board. But America had no designs
upon Grenada, and the invaders were greeted with joy by the Grenadan
citizenry. After organizing an election, America pulled out. In other
cases, democracies have turned to war in the face of provocation, such
as Israel\'s invasion of Lebanon in 1982 to root out an enemy sworn to
its destruction or Turkey\'s invasion of Cyprus to rebuff a power-grab
by Greek nationalists. In contrast, the wars launched by dictators, such
as Iraq\'s invasion of Kuwait, North Korea\'s of South Korea, the Soviet
Union\'s of Hungary and Afghanistan, often have aimed at conquest or
subjugation. The big exception to this rule is colonialism. The European
powers conquered most of Africa and Asia, and continued to hold their
prizes as Europe democratized. No doubt many of the instances of
democracies at war that enter into the statistical calculations of
researchers like Russett stem from the colonial era. But colonialism was
a legacy of Europe\'s pre-democratic times, and it was abandoned after
World War II. Since then, I know of no case where a democracy has
initiated warfare without significant provocation or for reasons of
sheer aggrandizement, but there are several cases where dictators have
done so. One interesting piece of Russett\'s research should help to
point him away from his doubts that democracies are more peaceful in
general. He aimed to explain why democracies are more peaceful toward
each other. Immanuel Kant was the first to observe, or rather to
forecast, the pacific inclination of democracies. He reasoned that
\"citizens \... will have a great hesitation in \...calling down on
themselves all the miseries of war.\"8But this valid insight is
incomplete. There is a deeper explanation. [Democracy is not just a
mechanism; it entails a spirit of compromise and self-restraint. At
bottom, democracy is the willingness to resolve civil disputes without
recourse to violence**. Nations that embrace this ethos in the conduct
of their domestic affairs are naturally more predisposed to embrace it
in their dealings with other nations**]{.underline}. Russett aimed to
explain why democracies are more peaceful toward one another. To do
this, he constructed two models. One hypothesized that the cause lay in
the mechanics of democratic decision-making (the
\"structural/institutional model\"), the other that it lay in the
democratic ethos (the \"cultural/normative model\"). His statistical
assessments led him to conclude that: \"almost always the
cultural/normative model shows a consistent effect on conflict
occurrence and war. The structural/institutional model sometimes
provides a significant relationship but often does not.\"9 If it is the
ethos that makes democratic states more peaceful toward each other,
would not that ethos also make them more peaceful in general? Russett
implies that the answer is no, because to his mind a critical element in
the peaceful behavior of democracies toward other democracies is their
anticipation of a conciliatory attitude by their counterpart. But this
is too pat. The attitude of live-and-let-live cannot be turned on and
off like a spigot. The citizens and officials of democracies recognize
that other states, however governed, have legitimate interests, and they
are disposed to try to accommodate those interests except when the other
party\'s behavior seems threatening or outrageous. A different kind of
challenge to the thesis that democracies are more peaceful has been
posed by the political scientists Edward G. Mansfield and Jack Snyder.
They claim statistical support for the proposition that while fully
fledged democracies may be pacific, in th\[e\] transitional phase of
democratization, countries become more aggressive and war- prone, not
less.\"10However, like others, they measure a state\'s likelihood of
becoming involved in a war but do not report attempting to determine the
cause or fault. Moreover, they acknowledge that their research revealed
not only an increased likelihood for a state to become involved in a war
when it was growing more democratic, but an almost equal increase for
states growing less democratic. This raises the possibility that the
effects they were observing were caused simply by political change per
se, rather than by democratization. Finally, they implicitly acknowledge
that the relationship of democratization and peacefulness may change
over historical periods. There is no reason to suppose that any such
relationship is governed by an immutable law. Since their empirical base
reaches back to 1811, any effect they report, even if accurately
interpreted, may not hold in the contemporary world. They note that \"in
\[some\] recent cases, in contrast to some of our historical results,
the rule seems to be: go fully democratic, or don\'t go at all.\" But
according to Freedom House, some 62.5 percent of extant governments were
chosen in legitimate elections.11 (This is a much larger proportion than
are adjudged by Freedom House to be \"free states,\" a more demanding
criterion, and it includes many weakly democratic states.) Of the
remaining 37.5 percent, a large number are experiencing some degree of
democratization or heavy pressure in that direction. So the choice
\"don\'t go at all\"12 is rarely realistic in the contemporary world.
These statistics also contain the answer to those who doubt the second
proposition behind Fukuyama\'s forecast, namely, that the world is
growing more democratic. Skeptics have drawn upon Samuel Huntington\'s
fine book, The Third Wave: Democratization in the Late Twentieth
Century. Huntington says that the democratization trend that began in
the mid- 1970s in Portugal, Greece and Spain is the third such episode.
The first \"wave\" of democratization began with the American Revolution
and lasted through the aftermath of World War I, coming to an end in the
interwar years when much of Europe regressed back to fascist or military
dictatorship. The second wave, in this telling, followed World War II
when wholesale decolonization gave rise to a raft of new democracies.
Most of these, notably in Africa, collapsed into dictatorship by the
1960s, bringing the second wave to its end. Those who follow
Huntington\'s argument may take the failure of democracy in several of
the former Soviet republics and some other instances of backsliding
since 1989 to signal the end of the third wave. Such an impression,
however, would be misleading. One unsatisfying thing about Huntington\'s
\"waves\" is their unevenness. The first lasted about 150 years, the
second about 20. How long should we expect the third to endure? If it is
like the second, it will ebb any day now, but if it is like the first,
it will run until the around the year 2125. And by then\--who
knows?\--perhaps mankind will have incinerated itself, moved to another
planet, or even devised a better political system. Further,
Huntington\'s metaphor implies a lack of overall progress or direction.
Waves rise and fall. But each of the reverses that followed
Huntington\'s two waves was brief, and each new wave raised the number
of democracies higher than before. Huntington does, however, present a
statistic that seems to weigh heavily against any unidirectional
interpretation of democratic progress. The proportion of states that
were democratic in 1990 (45%), he says, was identical to the proportion
in 1922.13 But there are two answers to this. In 1922 there were only 64
states; in 1990 there were 165. But the number of peoples had not grown
appreciably. The difference was that in 1922 most peoples lived in
colonies, and they were not counted as states. The 64 states of that
time were mostly the advanced countries. Of those, two thirds had become
democratic by 1990, which was a significant gain. The additional 101
states counted in 1990 were mostly former colonies. Only a minority,
albeit a substantial one, were democratic in 1990, but since virtually
none of those were democratic in 1922, that was also a significant gain.
In short, there was progress all around, but this was obscured by asking
what percentage of states were democratic. Asking the question this way
means that a people who were subjected to a domestic dictator counted as
a non-democracy, but a people who were subjected to a foreign dictator
did not count at all. Moreover, while the criteria for judging a state
democratic vary, the statistic that 45 percent of states were democratic
in 1990 corresponds with Freedom House\'s count of \"democratic\"
polities (as opposed to its smaller count of \"free\" countries, a more
demanding criterion). But by this same count, Freedom House now says
that the proportion of democracies has grown to 62.5 percent. In other
words, the \"third wave\" has not abated. The fall of Communism not only
ended the Cold War; it also ended the only universalist ideological
challenge to democracy. Radical Islam may still offer an alternative to
democracy in parts of the world, but it appeals by definition only to
Moslems and has not even won the assent of a majority of these. And
Iranian President Khatami\'s second landslide election victory in 2001
suggests that even in the cradle of radical Islam the yearning for
democracy is waxing. That Freedom House could count 120 freely elected
governments by early 2001 (out of a total of 192 independent states)
bespeaks a vast transformation in human governance within the span of
225 years. In 1775, the number of democracies was zero. In 1776, the
birth of the United States of America brought the total up to one. Since
then, democracy has spread at an accelerating pace, most of the growth
having occurred within the twentieth century, with greatest momentum
since 1974. That this momentum has slackened somewhat since its pinnacle
in 1989, destined to be remembered as one of the most revolutionary
years in all history, was inevitable. So many peoples were swept up in
the democratic tide that there was certain to be some backsliding. Most
countries\' democratic evolution has included some fits and starts
rather than a smooth progression. So it must be for the world as a
whole. Nonetheless, the overall trend remains powerful and clear.
Despite the backsliding, the number and proportion of democracies stands
higher today than ever before. **[This progress offers a source of hope
for enduring nuclear peace. The danger of nuclear war was radically
reduced almost overnight when Russia abandoned Communism and turned to
democracy.]{.underline}** For other ominous corners of the world, **[we
may be in a kind of race between the emergence or growth of nuclear
arsenals and the advent of democratization.]{.underline}**

But **[where the U.S. is indeed seeing a steep rise in competition is in
the unmanned vehicle sector, particular from China, which has made
inroads into the traditionally U.S.-dominated Middle East with its
cheaper UAVs.]{.underline}** According to analytics firm Avascent,
between 2013 and 2018 there were 56 countries that invested in a
non-U.S.-made unmanned system, with the majority of the systems coming
from Israel, China, the United Kingdom or indigenous suppliers.
Investment in non-American military UAS amounted to \$1.9 billion in
2013 and grew to \$3.5 billion in 2018 ― an estimate that may be low due
to a lack of transparency from Israeli and Chinese firms. Overall demand
for non-Russian, Chinese or U.S. unmanned systems is expected to reach
\$4.1 billion in 2025, \$1.6 billion of which is not yet under contract,
said Avascent's Doug Berenson, who added "the majority of the value in
the opportunity space lies in MALE/HALE systems, Combat UAS, and
Tactical UAS. **[The new regulations should let U.S. firms access
\[the\]]{.underline}** first two **[markets more easily]{.underline}**."
Tina Kaidanow, principal deputy assistant secretary for
political-military affairs at the U.S. State Department, **[said the
drone rule change represents "efforts to do things a little bit more
strategically. We need to do, the U.S. government, a better job of
strategic advocacy for some of our companies. We need to think about
those areas where we can really enable sales overseas." The drone policy
change included two important changes. The first is opening up the
opportunity for companies to sell systems via the Direct Commercial
Sales process, under which a company and another nation can directly
negotiate, rather than requiring a more formal Foreign Military Sales
process, where the U.S. government acts as a go-between. DCS sales are
seen as faster than FMS sales.]{.underline}** Secondly, the government
is eliminating rules that marked unarmed systems with laser-designator
technology as "strike enabling," which put them in the same category as
armed drones, and hence received higher scrutiny. Kaidanow said the goal
was to make sure **["U.S. industry faces fewer barriers and less
confusion when they are attempting to compete against other countries
and marketing and selling those similar systems to our partners.
"]{.underline}** While those changes will be welcomed by the UAV
industry, they fall short of what was expected and hoped for by major
producers of military drones. Industry was looking for the
administration to reinterpret the "strong presumption of denial" clause
in the Missile Technology Control Regime, an international arms control
agreement among 35 nations that governs the export of missiles and
drones. The current clause makes it difficult to approve the sale of
category-1 drones capable of carrying 500-kilogram payloads for more
than 300 kilometers. The Obama administration had set a standard of how
it interprets the MTCR language that some in industry have complained is
too strict, and had expected to see changed with this policy a
"presumption of approval" for a specific set of allies and partners in
Europe, the Middle East and the Asia-Pacific region. "U.S. drone export
policy had gotten out of sync with both the technology and the realities
of Chinese and Israeli exports," said Michael Horowitz, a former
Pentagon official now with the University of Pennsylvania who has
studied drone issues. **[He added that the new drone policy seeks to
balance the realities of ongoing drone proliferation and the growing
international market with U.S. responsibilities under the
MTCR]{.underline}**," but warned that future opening up of drone sales
will likely require dealing with the MTCR directly." Kaidanow
acknowledged an intent to try and reform MTCR, without details. But
American officials in October floated a whitepaper to allies proposing
that any air vehicle that flies under 650 kilometers per hour would drop
to "category-2" and thus be subject to approval on a case-by-case basis,
as opposed to having to follow the more strict "category-1" policies.
**[Human rights groups had also been bracing for a major shift in how
drone sales were handled, with an expected de-emphasis on monitoring how
systems were used by foreign customers. Instead, the language largely
remains, although Stohl notes it has been deemphasized in favor of
economic priorities. "Human rights are clearly not at the forefront of
this policy. This is a policy about the economy. It is a policy about
America first,"]{.underline}** Stohl said.

The status quo has not just failed to control the spread of armed
drones, but also undermined the credibility of the MTCR as a whole.
Reform is necessary. From an American perspective, **[if the United
States could export UAVs under rules more like those governing exports
of fighter aircraft, it could ensure that countries use their drones
more responsibly than if they acquire drones from other
sources.]{.underline}** US drone exports could also build the capacity
of US allies and partners, who would generally prefer to buy American
anyway. The [Arms Export Control
Act](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/22/chapter-39) requires
governments receiving weapons from the United States to use any
armaments only for legitimate self-defense and in accordance with
international law. Moreover, **[diminishing the market share of
non-members of the MTCR would reduce their ability to use drone revenues
for future technology development]{.underline}**. Additionally,
**[allied forces using American UAVs, instead of Chinese or Israeli
platforms, would have greater interoperability with the US military.
Interoperability enables coalition building, can reduce alliance-wide
military expenditures, and increases the overall efficacy of military
capabilities.]{.underline}** To help achieve these goals, members need
to rethink the MTCR, though there are no clear fixes for how to move
forward. The regime operates by consensus, making substantive change
difficult to achieve. Russia, for example, is well aware of the way the
MTCR constrains American UAV exports, and might seek to block any
changes, or threaten to violate the regime by exporting more Category I
missiles in response. Such challenges notwithstanding, it would be
worthwhile to continue discussing changes to regime rules. One option
would be altering the MTCR to put drones in the same category as
inhabited aircraft, which are not regulated by the regime. This would be
a common-sense solution, as UAVs are more like aircraft than they are
like cruise or ballistic missiles. A second option might involve a
broader shift away from exclusive reliance on the 300 km and 500 kg
restrictions. For example, adding a speed constraint to the definition
of a Category I system could distinguish missiles from UAVs, since
missiles travel so much faster. This kind of shift might be more
palatable to other members than the first option. But UAVs will evolve
over time, and could become significantly faster. Creating restrictions
based on a snapshot of the technological present runs the risk that
regulations will become obsolete sooner rather than later. If changes to
the MTCR itself are not possible, states have other options. For
example, the United States could remain a member of the MTCR, but simply
ignore the regime's guidelines on UAVs and choose to treat drones more
like inhabited aircraft**[. In 2016, the United States and 53 other
countries already signed a [Joint
Declaration](https://2009-2017.state.gov/r/pa/prs/ps/2016/10/262811.htm)
on the responsible export and use of UAVs; Washington could observe
those guidelines instead. If it also reaffirmed its commitment to
preventing long-range missile proliferation, this move could, in theory,
allow the MTCR to retain credibility for preventing the spread of
ballistic and cruise missiles.]{.underline}** Yet such a unilateral move
by the United States might encourage MTCR members like Russia and others
to increase missile exports. The regime has successfully slowed
proliferation of long-range ballistic missiles, and to a lesser degree
cruise missiles. This effect would likely diminish. Finally, **[current
MTCR members and other interested states could create a new arms control
agreement focused specifically on drone proliferation, while exempting
drones from the MTCR.]{.underline}** But it would be hard to conclude a
new agreement in the current international political climate. Moreover,
it is not clear what the basis of such an agreement would be. There
appears to be little appetite for a more formal international agreement
beyond the Obama-era Joint Declaration. There is no easy answer, but
MTCR members---as well as other governments---have to consider the
options. Turning back the clock to a time when few countries had
military drones is not going to be possible. However, **[governments can
manage their spread in a way that is less destabilizing, with fewer
violations of international law.]{.underline}** A more common-sense
approach, treating drones more like aircraft than missiles, is likely a
key part of the answer.

#### The rapid proliferation of drones risks artificial intelligence making lethal decisions -- puts humanity at risk

**Perrigo 18** (Billy, Reporter for TIME magazine, 4/9, "A Global Arms
Race for Killer Robots Is Transforming the Battlefield",
<https://time.com/5230567/killer-robots/>, Aly M)

Over the weekend, experts on military artificial intelligence from more
than 80 world governments converged on the U.N. offices in Geneva for
the start of a week's talks on autonomous weapons systems. **[Many of
them fear that after gunpowder and nuclear weapons, we are now on the
brink of a "third revolution in warfare," heralded by killer robots ---
the fully autonomous weapons that could decide who to target and kill
without human input.]{.underline}** With autonomous technology already
in development in several countries, the talks mark a crucial point for
governments and activists who believe the U.N. should play a key role in
regulating the technology.\
The meeting comes at a critical juncture. In July, Kalashnikov, the main
defense contractor of the Russian government, announced it was
developing a weapon that uses neural networks to make "shoot-no shoot"
decisions. **[In January 2017, the U.S. Department of Defense released a
video showing an autonomous drone swarm of 103 individual robots
successfully flying over California. Nobody was in control of the
drones; their flight paths were choreographed in real-time by an
advanced algorithm. The drones "are a collective organism, sharing one
distributed brain for decision-making and adapting to each other like
swarms in nature," a spokesman said.]{.underline}** The drones in the
video were not weaponized --- but the technology to do so is rapidly
evolving.\
**[This April also marks five years since the launch of the
International Campaign to Stop Killer Robots, which called for "urgent
action to preemptively ban the lethal robot weapons that would be able
to select and attack targets without any human intervention." The 2013
launch letter --- signed by a Nobel Peace Laureate and the directors of
several NGOs --- noted that they could be deployed within the next 20
years and would "give machines the power to decide who lives or dies on
the battlefield."\
Five years on, armed drones and other weapons with varying degrees of
autonomy have become far more commonly used by high-tech militaries,
including the U.S., Russia, the U.K., Israel, South Korea and
China.]{.underline}** By 2016, China had tested autonomous technologies
in each domain: land, air and sea. South Korea announced in December it
was planning to develop a drone swarm that could descend upon the North
in the event of war. Israel already has a fully autonomous loitering
munition called the Harop, which can dive-bomb radar signals without
human direction and has reportedly already been used with lethal results
on the battlefield. **[The world's most powerful nations are already at
the starting blocks of a secretive and potentially deadly arms race,
while regulators lag behind.]{.underline}**

#### Artificial intelligence throws MAD theory out the window -- outweighs nuclear war

**Perrigo 18** (Billy, Reporter for TIME magazine, 4/9, "A Global Arms
Race for Killer Robots Is Transforming the Battlefield",
<https://time.com/5230567/killer-robots/>, Aly M)

**[The implication of this approach is a return to the cold war tenet of
mutually assured destruction. But campaigners say the risks could be
even higher than those of nuclear weapons, as artificial intelligence
brings with it a level of unpredictable complexity. Many in the tech
community are concerned that autonomous weapons might carry invisible
biases into their actions.]{.underline}** Neural network technology,
where machines crunch vast amounts of data and modify their own
algorithms in response to results, comprises the backbone of much AI
that exists nowadays. **[One of the risks that brings is that not even
the technology's creators know exactly how the final algorithm works.
"The assumption that once it's in the technology it becomes neutral and
sanitized, that's a bit of a problem," says Schwarz, who specializes in
the ethics of violent technologies. "You risk outsourcing the decision
of what constitutes good and bad to the technology. And once that is in
the technology, we don't typically know what goes on
there."]{.underline}**

#### Despite treaties, conditions of war will push countries to use drones against civilians

**Perrigo 18** (Billy, Reporter for TIME magazine, 4/9, "A Global Arms
Race for Killer Robots Is Transforming the Battlefield",
<https://time.com/5230567/killer-robots/>, Aly M)

**[Even though attacking civilians goes against international
humanitarian law, Sharkey argues the lack of a specific treaty means it
can happen anyway.]{.underline}** He fears the same might be the case
with killer robots in the future. "What we're trying to do is stigmatize
the technology, and set up international norms," he says."\
But Scharre argues the opposite. **["When push comes to shove and
there's an incredible military technology in a major conflict, history
shows that countries are willing to break a treaty and use it if it will
help them win the war," he says.]{.underline}** "What restrains
countries is reciprocity. It's the concern that if I use this weapon,
you will use it against me. The consequences of you doing something
against me are so severe that I won't do it." It's that thinking that
drives current U.S. policy on autonomy.

##  Plan

#### Plan: The United States federal government should substantially reduce direct commercial sales and foreign military sales of drones from the United States by increasing end-use restrictions and ongoing conflict restrictions on drones.

##  Solvency

#### The plan prevents escalating global drones arms races and sales to countries who are engaged in the ongoing conflict in Yemen

**Boyle 2/11** (Michael, Associate Professor of Political Science at La
Salle University, 2019, "HOW TO PREVENT AN ESCALATING DRONE ARMS RACE",
<https://scholars.org/contribution/how-prevent-escalating-drone-arms-race>,
Aly M)

**[In 2018, limits were further relaxed by the Trump administration,
which eliminated some of the bureaucratic barriers on direct commercial
sales to foreign governments and reclassified drones with strike-enabled
technology as unarmed, thus making them easier to sell. More
importantly, the Trump administration signaled a willingness to
renegotiate the Missile Technology Control Regime to exclude drones.
These steps will increase U.S. drone exports and spur the drone arms
race.]{.underline}**\
Recommendations\
Although the Trump administration is unlikely to limit U.S. drone sales
or cede more of the market to Israel and China, it can still take three
steps to limit escalation of a drones arms race:\
Restore stronger end-use agreements: The Trump administration's policy
weakens the requirement for end-use monitoring for drones sold under
direct commercial licenses. **[Restoring restrictive end-use
restrictions on commercial sales of U.S.-made drones and insisting on
accountability for violations, including revoking foreign purchase
rights if necessary, would restrain states from taking risky actions
with the technology.\]{.underline}**
Limit sales of armed drones to countries not involved in ongoing
interstate conflicts. The Obama administration allowed sales only to
NATO countries and close allies, but the Trump administration wants a
wider pool of buyers. **[One way to ensure that drones are not misused
is to demand a State Department certification that the foreign buyer is
not involved in ongoing territorial disputes or active conflicts with
its neighbors.]{.underline}**

##  Drones Harm Civilians

#### Drones are more likely to harm civilians

**Maguire 15**, (Laura, Director of Research and Editor in Chief of
Philosophers\' Corner, 9-9-2015, \"The Ethics of Drone Warfare,\"
Philosophy Talk,
https://www.philosophytalk.org/blog/ethics-drone-warfare) accessed
7-3-2019

First, to say that drones reduce unintended casualties is misleading, at
best. **[While US soldiers may not be in direct danger when we drone
attack Pakistan, Afghanistan, or wherever it is we're terrorizing these
days, hundreds upon hundreds of civilians have been killed by drones
since Obama took office.]{.underline}** It's hard to see how that's
"morally preferable." Sure, if we used less precise technology to bomb
those places, there would probably be even more civilians deaths. But
that's assuming we'd bomb these targets at all, which brings me to the
second point. A big part of the moral problem **[with drones is that
they make it too easy for the powers-that-be to bomb whomever they want
without much political fallout]{.underline}**. Sending troops in on the
ground and putting them in direct danger comes with political
consequences, but if we attack our so-called "enemies" remotely, and
don't have soldiers coming back in body bags, then there's not going to
be nearly as much backlash. And so, politically speaking, **[it's easy
for commanders to order strikes, which then leads to a lot of civilian
casualties on the other side.]{.underline}** Of course, the number of
civilian casualties from drone attacks has more to do with foreign
policy and intelligence gathering practices than the technology of
drones per se. If avoiding civilian casualties is not a priority for the
commander in charge of a strike, we're going to see lots of civilian
casualties, regardless of the kind of weapons used. **[We're told that
drone attacks target high value terrorists, when, in reality, it's also
farmers, low level drug dealers, and men exercising in "suspicious
looking" compounds who are targeted.\[2\]]{.underline}**

##  Cartels Add-On

#### Drone Proliferation will lead to military drones spreading to civilian spaces such as cartels 

**Bergen and Rowland 12**, (Peter Bergen, Cnn National Security Analyst,
and Jennifer Rowland, Special To Cnn, 10-8-2012, \"A dangerous new world
of drones,\" CNN,
https://www.cnn.com/2012/10/01/opinion/bergen-world-of-drones/index.html)
accessed 7-3-2019

A decade ago, the United States had a virtual monopoly on drones. Not
anymore**[. According to data compiled by the New America Foundation,
more than 70 countries now own some type of drone, though just a small
number of those nations possess armed drone aircraft.]{.underline}** The
explosion in drone technology promises to change the way nations conduct
war and threatens to begin a new arms race as governments scramble to
counterbalance their adversaries. Late last month, China announced that
it would use surveillance drones to monitor a group of uninhabited
islands in the South China Sea that are controlled by Japan but claimed
by China and Taiwan. In August 2010, Iran unveiled what it claimed was
its first armed drone. And on Tuesday, the country\'s military chief,
Gen. Amir Ali Hajizadeh, disclosed details of a new long-range drone
that he said can fly 2,000 kilometers (1,250 miles), which puts Tel Aviv
easily in range. Israel looks to Lebanon after drone shot down But
without an international framework governing the use of drone attacks,
the United States is setting a dangerous precedent for other nations
with its aggressive and secretive drone programs in Pakistan and Yemen,
which are aimed at suspected members of al Qaeda and their allies. Just
as the U.S. government justifies its drone strikes with the argument
that it is at war with al Qaeda and its affiliates, one could imagine
that India in the not too distant future might launch such attacks
against suspected terrorists in Kashmir, or China might strike Uighur
separatists in western China, or Iran might attack Baluchi nationalists
along its border with Pakistan. This moment may almost be here. China
took the United States by surprise in November 2010 at the Zhuhai Air
Show, where it unveiled 25 drone models, some of which were outfitted
with the capability to fire missiles. It remains unclear just how many
of China\'s drones are operational and how many of them are still in
development, but China is intent on catching up with the United States\'
rapidly expanding drone arsenal. When President George W. Bush declared
a \"War on Terror\" 11 years ago, the Pentagon had fewer than 50 drones.
Now, it has around 7,500. **[Study: Drone strikes kill, maim and
traumatize too many civilians]{.underline}** As Bush embarked on that
war, the United States had never used armed drones in combat. The first
U.S. armed drone attack, which appears to be the first such strike ever,
took place in mid-November 2001 and killed the military commander of al
Qaeda, Mohammed Atef, in Afghanistan. **[Since then, the CIA has used
drones equipped with bombs and missiles hundreds of times to target
suspected militants in Pakistan and Yemen.]{.underline}** CNN Radio:
Drone debate \-- who can you trust? Only the United States, United
Kingdom and Israel are known to have launched drone strikes against
their adversaries, although other members of the International Security
Assistance Force in Afghanistan, such as Australia, have \"borrowed\"
drones from Israel for use in the war there. **[Drone technology is
proliferating rapidly. A 2011 study estimated that there were around 680
active drone development programs run by governments, companies and
research institutes around the world, compared with just 195 in
2005]{.underline}**. In 2010, U.S.-based General Atomics received export
licenses to sell unarmed versions of the Predator drone to Saudi Arabia,
Egypt, Morocco and the United Arab Emirates. And in March, the U.S.
government agreed to arm Italy\'s six Reaper drones but rejected a
request from Turkey to purchase armed Predator drones. An official in
Turkey\'s Defense Ministry said in July that Turkey planned to arm its
own domestically produced drone, the Anka. Israel is the world\'s
largest exporter of drones and drone technology, and the state-owned
Israeli Aerospace Industries has sold to countries as varied as Nigeria,
Russia and Mexico. **[Building drones, particularly armed drones, takes
sophisticated technology and specific weaponry, but governments are
increasingly willing to invest the necessary time and money to either
buy or develop them, as armed drones are increasingly seen as an
integral part of modern warfare.]{.underline}** Sweden, Greece,
Switzerland, Spain, Italy and France are working on a joint project
through state-owned aeronautical companies and are in the final stages
of developing an advanced armed drone prototype called the Dassault
nEURon, from which the France plans to derive armed drones for its air
force. And Pakistani authorities have long tried to persuade the United
States to give them armed Predator drones, while India owns an armed
Israeli drone designed to detect and destroy enemy radar, though it does
not yet have drones capable of striking other targets. The Teal Group, a
defense consulting firm in Virginia, estimated in June that the global
market for the research, development and procurement of armed drones
will just about double in the next decade, from \$6.6 billion to \$11.4
billion. News: Drones expected to hunt for suspects in Libya attack
States are not alone in their quest for drones. Insurgent groups, too,
are moving to acquire this technology. Last year, Libyan opposition
forces trying to overthrow the dictator Moammar Gadhafi bought a
sophisticated surveillance drone from a Canadian company for which they
paid in the low six figures. You can even buy your own tiny drone on
Amazon for \$250. (And for an extra \$3.99, you can get next-day
shipping.) **[As drone technology becomes more widely accessible, it is
only a matter of time before well-financed drug cartels acquire them.
And you can imagine a day in the not too distant future where armed
drones are used to settle personal vendettas. Given the relatively low
costs of drones \-- already far cheaper than the costs of a fighter jet
and of training a fighter jet pilot \-- armed drones will play a key
role in future conflicts.]{.underline}** Opinion: When are drone
killings illegal? **[While the drone industry thrives and more
companies, research institutes and nations jump on board the drone
bandwagon, the United States is setting a powerful international norm
about the use of armed drones, which it uses for pre-emptive attacks
against presumed terrorists in Pakistan and Yemen. It is these kinds of
drone strikes that are controversial; the use of drones in a
conventional war is not much different than a manned aircraft that drops
bombs or fires missiles.]{.underline}** According to figures compiled by
the New America Foundation, **[drone attacks aimed at suspected
militants are estimated to have killed between 1,900 and 3,200 people in
Pakistan over the past eight years.]{.underline}**

**[The world order built upon the Peace of Westphalia is
faltering]{.underline}**. **[State fragility]{.underline}** or failure
are **[endemic, with no fewer than one-third of the states in the
U]{.underline}**nited **[N]{.underline}**ations **[earning a "high
warning"---or worse---in the Fragile States Index, and an equal number
suffering a decline in sustainability]{.underline}** over the past
decade.1 State weakness invites a range of illicit actors, including
international terrorists, globally networked insurgents, and
transnational criminal organizations (TCOs). The presence and operations
of these entities keep states weak and incapable of effective
governance, and limit the possibility of fruitful partnerships with the
United States and its allies. **[Illicit organizations and their
networks fuel corruption, eroding state legitimacy among the governed,
and sowing doubt that the state is a genuine guardian of the public
interest. These networks can penetrate the state, leading to state
capture, and even criminal sovereignty]{.underline}**.2 **[A growing
number of weak and corrupt states is creating gaping holes in the global
rule-based system of states that we depend on for our security and
prosperity]{.underline}**. Indeed, the chapters of this book **[suggest
the emergence of a highly adaptive and parasitic alternative ecosystem,
based on criminal commerce and extreme violence]{.underline}**, with
little regard for what we commonly conceive of as the public interest or
the public good. **[The last 10 years have seen unprecedented growth in
interactivity between and among a wide range of illicit
networks]{.underline}**, as well as the emergence of hybrid
organizations that use methods characteristic of both terrorist and
criminal groups. **[In a convergence of interests, terrorist
organizations collaborate with cartels, and trafficking organizations
collude with insurgents]{.underline}**. International terrorist
organizations, such as al-Qaeda and Hezbollah, engage energetically in
transnational crime to raise funds for their operations. Prominent
criminal organizations like Los Zetas in Mexico and D-Company in
Pakistan have adopted the symbolic violence of terrorists---the
propaganda of the deed---to secure their "turf." And networked
insurgents, such as the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL), the
Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC), and the Liberation Tigers
of Tamil Eelam (LTTE), have adopted the techniques of both crime and
terror.3 An Emerging Criminal Ecosystem **[The unimpeded trajectory of
these trends---convergence, hybridization, and state capture--- poses
substantial risks to]{.underline}** the national security interests of
the United States, and threatens **[international
security]{.underline}**. **[Illicit networked organizations are
challenging the fundamental principles of sovereignty that undergird the
international system]{.underline}**. Fragile and failing states are both
prey to such organizations, which feed on them like parasites, and Petri
dishes for them, incapable of supporting effective security
partnerships. **[The Westphalian, rule-based system of sovereign
polities itself is at risk of fraying, as fewer and fewer capable states
survive to meet these challenges, and populations around the world lose
faith in the Westphalian paradigm. The emergence of an alternative
ecosystem of crime and violence threatens us all and much of the
progress we have seen in recent centuries]{.underline}**. This dark
underworld weakens national sovereignty and erodes international
partnerships. **[We should not take for granted the long-term durability
of the Westphalian system. It was preceded by millennia of much less
benign forms of governance, and alternative futures are
imaginable]{.underline}**. This book describes "convergence" (the
interactivity and hybridization of diverse illicit networks), the
emergence of new networks and new domains or "battlespaces," and the
threat illicit networks pose to national and international security. It
examines dystopian visions of a world in which these trajectories go
indefinitely unimpeded, and concludes by discussing possible
countermeasures to be explored. **[While some recognize the growing
threat to the global system of governance that these new phenomena
impose, others are skeptical]{.underline}**. According to the
conventional wisdom, TCOs and international terrorist organizations are
unlikely candidates for partnership. Such analysis suggests that
criminals are motivated by the pursuit of wealth in defiance of law,
morality, or ideology. They typically prefer to remain undetected, and
have little interest in the violence committed by, or risks taken by,
international terrorists. Already pursued by law enforcement, criminals
are not keen to receive the attention of the Central Intelligence Agency
or SEAL Team Six. International terrorists and insurgents, on the other
hand, are politically motivated; driven by ideological, religious, or
nationalistic motives; and repelled by the vulgar materialism and greed
of criminals. They have no desire to get on the radar of the Drug
Enforcement Administration (DEA), or other national or international law
enforcement agencies. **[This logic is understandable, and may have
prevailed in previous times, but the evidence of extensive
interconnectivity---if not explicit partnership---between TCOs,
international terrorists, and globally networked insurgents is
compelling]{.underline}**. **[Recent research]{.underline}** undertaken
by the Combating Terrorism Center at West Point **[reveals that,
"criminals and terrorists are largely subsumed (98 percent) in a single
network as opposed to operating in numerous smaller
networks]{.underline}**."4 In its Performance Budget Congressional
Submission for FY 2014, the DEA stated that by "the end of the first
quarter of FY 2013, 25 of the 67 organizations on the Attorney General's
Consolidated Priority Organization Target (CPOT) List are associated
with terrorist organizations."5 According to a more recent DEA
statement, roughly half of the Department of State's 59 officially
designated foreign terrorist organizations have been linked to the
global drug trade.6 The six degrees of separation that may have once
divided people is a relic of the past---today, international terrorists,
insurgents, and criminals are merely a click away from each other. It
**[might be argued that terrorism, insurgency, and organized crime have
existed since time immemorial, and that their modern iterations
represent nothing new. Such an argument naively discounts modern
enablers such as information and communication technology,
transportation advances, and the unprecedented volumes of money
generated in illicit markets. These are game changers. They permit
illicit actors to avail themselves of lethal technology, military-grade
weaponry, real-time information, and professional services of the
highest quality, including legal, accounting, technological, security,
and paramilitary services. Cartels and gangs, as well as terrorists and
some insurgents, can now outman, outspend, and outgun the governments of
the countries where they reside]{.underline}**. They can communicate
across the globe in real time, using widely available and inexpensive
technology. The November 2008 Mumbai terrorist attackers used satellite
phones, internet communications, and global positioning systems, under
the direction of Pakistanbased handlers to carry out an atrocious binge
of murder and terror.7 **[The string of ISIL attacks across Europe in
2015 and 2016 further illustrates the global consequences]{.underline}**
of this technological acceleration. International travel has never been
easier or cheaper than it is today, and would-be terrorists,
traffickers, launderers, and even assassins can fly nearly undetected
from continent to continent, in the sea of traveling humanity. Though it
is clear that this connectivity is widespread and threatens global
security, the details of the agreements or arrangements between
terrorist, insurgent, and transnational criminal organizations remain
murky. A partial exception to this is in instances where both
organizations wish for new relationships to be known, such as the 1998
merger of Ayman al-Zawahiri's Egyptian Islamic Jihad organization with
Osama bin Laden's al-Qaeda.8 Other relationships, such as between the
FARC and al-Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb (AQIM), are opaque as neither
organization has an interest in revealing the relationship. It is
unclear in the majority of cases what kinds of partnerships these are,
and we are often unable to discern whether such instances of cooperation
are one-time affairs or longer-term arrangements. This lack of
information handicaps our response and threatens global security. The
purposeful opacity of illicit organizations presents a vexing challenge
to mapping and understanding these actors. Operating by intention
outside the vision of regulators or researchers, their activities and
revenues are hidden. So how do we determine the magnitude of their
operations, or the harm they inflict? How do we know the value of their
transactions? We extrapolate from extremely inexact evidence, such as
seizures, arrests, convictions, and the associated testimony of
witnesses, often themselves members of such organizations and motivated
to dissemble. Analysts still rely on the nearly 20-year-old
"International Monetary Fund (IMF) consensus range," of "\$1 to \$3
trillion" or "two to five percent" of global product. In 1998, Michel
Camdessus, then managing director of the IMF, provided that estimate of
the amount of money laundered annually across the globe. Given what we
know about global trafficking in drugs, persons, weapons, counterfeits,
and other contraband it seems unlikely that the value of illicit trade
has decreased over the past 20 years. Even at a "mere" two to five
percent of global product, Camdessus described the magnitude of the
problem as "almost beyond imagination...."9 Less difficult, but still
challenging and far more visceral to calculate, is the cost of global
terrorism in human lives. At publication, the most recent estimates
suggest that 2014 saw an increase of 35 percent in the number of
terrorist attacks globally, with total fatalities rising to nearly
33,000 by some counts; 2015 is likely to mark another increase, as ISIL
continues its brutal global campaign, and Boko Haram terrorizes the Lake
Chad Basin.10 This does not take into account nonfatal injuries, the
destruction of families and communities, and the economic costs. These
cannot be monetized, but few would deny that the opportunity cost of the
"global war on terror" (GWOT) has been huge. A 2008 estimate by Nobel
Laureate Joseph Stiglitz and Linda J. Bilmes put the long-term costs of
the Iraq War at \$3 trillion.11 The Cost of War Project puts the total
economic cost of America's post-9/11 campaigns at \$4.4 trillion through
FY 2014.12 **[These two sets of costs---the global illicit market plus
the costs associated with the GWOT---comprise a staggering portion of
global product]{.underline}**, and give a plausible indication of the
magnitude of the emerging alternative ecosystem. **[Consider the drag on
global productivity and development if so much of human activity is
dedicated to transnational crime and terrorism]{.underline}**. Adding to
this, the cost of networked insurgencies in countries such as
Afghanistan, Colombia, Sri Lanka, and South Sudan, suggests that an
unconscionable proportion of global resources is being expended by
efforts to undermine the well-being of citizens worldwide. Imagine what
might be accomplished for all mankind if those resources were available
for more constructive investment. Net Systemic Costs **[Not only do
these networks divert economic resources globally]{.underline}**, but
**[they also reduce the capacity of states to govern, rendering them
incapable of]{.underline}** effectively governing their territory or
borders, let alone **[exercising a monopoly of the legitimate use of
force, or providing other vital public services]{.underline}**. The net
systemic harm is imposed at four levels: • the
**[inability]{.underline}** of states **[to govern]{.underline}** their
**[populations and territories]{.underline}**, which **[creates seedbeds
for international terrorism, networked insurgency, and transnational
crime, causing immense human suffering]{.underline}**; • the regional
spillover effect from state fragility and instability, that sometimes
penetrates key U.S. allies and partners; • the growing feral regions
that **[serve as launch pads for attacks]{.underline}** against U.S.
national security interests worldwide, **[as well as]{.underline}**
potentially direct attacks on the homeland, as occurred on September 11,
2001; and • the cost associated with **[the decline of the global,
rule-based system and the shrinking Westphalian domain]{.underline}**. A
cursory examination of a few key states shows the toll illicit networks
take on our national security interests. Though Mexico's death rate has
subsided somewhat over the past two years, the wars between the
narcotics cartels and state authorities, and between the cartels
themselves, are thought to have caused as many as 130,000 deaths between
2007 and 2013, or over 20,000 per year.13 Mexican cartels today work
hand-in-hand with the criminal gangs of Central America's Northern
Triangle---comprised of El Salvador, Honduras, and Guatemala---resulting
in some of the highest homicide rates in the world. El Salvador's
official forensic unit estimated the homicide rate in 2014 at nearly 70
per 100,000.14 Despite their collaborative intentions, these countries
are under such duress that their security partnership contributions
cannot yet inspire confidence. Indeed, in 2014, nearly 70,000
unaccompanied children from Central America and Mexico made their way
through Mexico to the United States to escape the tormented lands of
their births.15 Another key security partner, Nigeria is the most
populous African state with the largest economy, and a major oil
producer. Nigeria could and should play a stabilizing role throughout
the continent. In fact, Nigerian forces were critical in staunching the
civil wars that hemorrhaged West Africa in the 1990s through the 2000s.
Yet today, Nigeria is hobbled by the burgeoning Boko Haram insurgency in
the north, and resurgent gang insurgency in the Niger Delta. Moreover,
the Boko Haram scourge has bled into the neighboring countries of the
Lake Chad Basin. The once-hopeful suppositions that Iraq and Afghanistan
could act as U.S. security partners now seem to be wishful thinking.
Despite the investment of hundreds of billions of dollars to bolster the
capacity of these two potential partners, effective collaboration seems
extremely unlikely for the foreseeable future. Afghanistan today
struggles to survive the attacks of al-Qaeda, the Taliban and Haqqani
networks, and more recently ISIL. Though the Government of Afghanistan
welcomes U.S. engagement, its effectiveness as a security partner
remains questionable. Similarly, Iraq struggles to survive as an
autonomous state, depending on Kurdish and Shia nonstate militias in its
fight with ISIL. Afghanistan and Iraq may continue to act as incubators
for terrorist groups planning attacks against the United States well
into the future. Though the nature or extent of the connections between
these terrorist and criminal organizations is not transparent, what is
clear is that when they desire to interact, they are able to do so.
Joint training, learning, and sharing of experience are certainly
likely, if not yet joint operations. While states unwillingly and
unwittingly act as safe havens for destabilizing global actors, even
more troubling are instances in which there is clear collusion between
such groups and elements of sovereign states. For example, Iran's Quds
Force, a special forces unit of the Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps,
has been both directly engaged in terrorist acts around the world, and
is supportive of other terrorist organizations. Ominously, in 2011, an
attempt by the Quds Force to collaborate with the Los Zetas cartel to
assassinate the Saudi Arabian ambassador to the United States was
intercepted.16 That this effort was interdicted by the vigilant DEA is
extremely fortunate--- at that particular moment in time, with the
combustible tension between Iran and Saudi Arabia, and between Sunni and
Shia throughout the Islamic world, the consequences of the intended
assassination are difficult to imagine. One need only consider the
consequences of the assassination of Archduke Ferdinand in Sarajevo just
a century ago to put this into perspective. This effort by the Quds
Force to conspire with Los Zetas, now fully documented in U.S. case law,
demonstrates beyond a reasonable doubt the potential collusion of
sovereign states and terrorist organizations with criminal
organizations. This type of collusion is not limited to the Middle East.
As Douglas Farah has written, Venezuela has utilized the state's
diplomatic tools to support criminal and terrorist activity.17 North
Korea has long been known as a hub of illicit activity, allegedly
including smuggling, counterfeit trade, production of controlled
substances, illegal weapons trafficking, and money laundering.
Pyongyang's infamous Bureau 39 is thought to generate between \$500
million and \$1 billion per year from such illicit activities.18 The
Stakes Are High **[To succeed in meeting]{.underline}** the
**[international security challenges]{.underline}** of the 21st century,
**[the U]{.underline}**nited **[S]{.underline}**tates **[and its allies
need capable and legitimate partners]{.underline}**. Today, ISIL's
assault on Syria and Iraq is being vigorously resisted by a coalition
that includes many American partner countries, including Saudi Arabia,
the United Arab Emirates, Jordan, Qatar, and Bahrain, among others.
Imagine a world in which the United States had no partners. **[No
partners in the Middle East or Africa would leave only U.S. boots on the
ground to combat ISIL, al-Qaeda, al-Shabaab, and Boko Haram. But capable
and legitimate partners are hard to find, and getting
harder]{.underline}**. The global community of democracies from which
America prefers to choose its partners has shrunk, as the domain of
freedom is much diminished in recent years.19 Many potential partners
have shown deep fault lines leading to instability. Consider for example
Egypt, Mali, and Thailand; each so consumed with internal fissures that
effective partnership is beyond their current capability. Though some
argue the world has actually become gradually safer over time, many
countries once thought to be stable and safe have recently experienced
the trauma of indiscriminate terrorism.20 The Global Peace Index reports
that, "The world has become less peaceful every year since 2008."21
Attacks in countries as diverse as Kenya, India, France, Belgium, and
the United States show that there is no nationality, religion, or
terrain immune from this onslaught. **[The Westphalian system of global
governance has always been]{.underline}** an
**[aspirational]{.underline}** model---and a geographically limited one
at that. **[Despite its limitations, however, it is unclear if a better
model of governance exists. Under the Westphalian system]{.underline}**,
economic growth has surged and **[the quality of life has
flourished]{.underline}**. In the 368 years since the Peace of
Westphalia established this rule-based system based on sovereign
equality, the world has experienced **[an unprecedented surge across a
range of quality of life indicators: life expectancy has surged from
below 40 to over 70 years]{.underline}**, per capita gross domestic
product increased from around \$600 to over \$10,000 per year, and
literacy has increased from less than 10 percent to over 80 percent of
the global population. **[Rather than abandoning the Westphalian system
in favor of an untested, and likely less capable, system, we must
cultivate global partnerships to reform and strengthen the
system]{.underline}**. **[A chain is only as strong as its weakest link,
and a growing number of weak and corrupt states leaves alarming gaps in
the global rule-based system of states]{.underline}**. This book aspires
to act as a roadmap for those seeking to understand the forces---both
the external pressures and the internal failings---that have led us to
the current global crisis of governance. The text is organized in four
sections. The first section, "Slouching Toward Dystopia," offers a
vision of a world unmoored from the organizational principles of the
Westphalian order. This part **[imagines the worst-case scenarios if
current assaults on the international system go
unchecked]{.underline}**. It includes Phil Williams' discussion of the
crisis of the international order, arguing that **[global governance has
failed because of the inability of states to govern
themselves]{.underline}**. Nils Gilman describes the state under
pressure from "twin insurgencies," **[plutocrats and criminal networks,
both detached from any loyalty to the state, and both limiting the
capacity of the state]{.underline}**. Scott Atran reveals the profound
and widespread alienation from the global status quo that leads to
violent extremism as a redeeming virtue. Francis Fukuyama and Hilary
Matfess examine emerging alternative forms of governance, emulating
antidemocratic norms, that are cropping up globally, complicating the
American search for willing partners abroad. Jay Chittooran and Scott
Helfstein explain how criminality has affected equity market returns,
illustrating the tangible economic effects that new criminal actors have
had on economic stability and development. Section II, "One Network,"
examines the expansion of existing criminal networks and explores their
operational characteristics and policy implications. Christopher Dishman
describes the extent and interconnectivity of criminal networks,
terrorist groups, and other violent actors that enable the external
corrosion of the state. Matthew Levitt explores the global reach of
Hezbollah, detailing how the group's global networks have allowed it to
exploit "Useful Idiots, Henchmen, and Organized Criminal Facilitators."
Douglas Farah discusses the spread of criminality and anti-system norms
in Latin America, suggesting that an anti-American coalition is on the
rise south of the border. Jessica Stern describes the rise of ISIL as a
global threat---highlighting the group's mixture of ideological and
material interests that has propelled it to the forefront of national
and international security discussions. Section III, "Pandora,"
describes recent innovations that complicate the global threat
landscape. Tuesday Reitano and Andrew Trabulsi discuss the role of
social media in bolstering the appeal of antistate actors, allowing them
to establish "cult-like" followings and to facilitate "intimate
connections to an individual which can be used to raise funds, identify
and cultivate associates and victims."22 Mark Shaw describes the rise of
"protection economies," particularly in West Africa, where jihadist
networks are increasingly a part of the drug smuggling business in the
region. Describing a massive and nefarious parallel economy, Karl
Lallerstedt adds to this discussion through an exploration of global
counterfeit and smuggling networks, and the growing gray space between
licit and illicit commerce. Weak state capacity hampers efforts to
counter this trend, threatening to allow the region to descend into
alternatively governed spaces. Raj Samani shows how the technological
innovations that have made our lives and work so much easier have
produced disconcerting vulnerabilities in the cyber domain that are
increasingly being exploited by criminal groups, terrorists, and hostile
states alike. Section IV, "A Toolbox for the 21st Century," offers
responses to these challenges; the authors offer tangible policy options
to mitigate the threats. Clare Lockhart and Michael Miklaucic discuss
the critical role of state-building as a remedy to the rise of illicit
actors and tempting but toxic ideologies. Celina Realuyo explains how
public-private partnerships (P3 ) can be leveraged to form effective
alliances against antistate forces. Sebastian Gorka details the
remarkable appeal of ISIL's destructive ideology, the ways in which this
affects the nature of the fight to counter violent extremism worldwide,
and how armed forces can adapt. Christopher Fussell and D.W. Lee build
upon General (Ret.) Stanley McChrystal's "Team of Teams" approach to
offer an organizational solution to the rigidity of governmental
bureaucracy, rendering it nimbler and more effective in the face of a
metastasizing threat. Throughout the book, a number of common threads
emerge, which should be considered by leaders seeking **[to preserve and
strengthen the liberal world order]{.underline}**. The first is that
American confidence that the end of the Cold War also denoted the end of
the global ideological struggle was premature. As this collection shows,
across the globe, the contemporary paradigm of governance consisting of
democracy and liberalization is being challenged. This challenge
emanates not only from China, despite the media attention focused on
this purported rivalry, but also from gangs and cartels in Latin America
and nonstate actors in Africa, the Middle East, and elsewhere. **[The
"new brand" of global jihadist terrorism traffics not just in weapons,
oil, and people, but also in a profound sense of communal
marginalization. And it has global reach---the arc of connectivity spans
from the cartels in Mexico to the insurgents in Mindanao, and
encompasses the gangs of Central America, the cartels of Colombia,
al-Qaeda affiliates in the Maghreb, Boko Haram in Nigeria, al-Shabaab in
Somalia, al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula, the Taliban in Afghanistan,
Lashkar-e-Taiba in Pakistan, the LTTE in Sri Lanka, and the Jemaah
Islamiyah in Indonesia]{.underline}**. Hovering over many of these is
the specter of a new caliphate, **[ISIL]{.underline}**. The second is
that **[new technology not only reduces the "capacity gap" between
conventional and unconventional forces, but also introduces new
vulnerabilities]{.underline}** to America's security and that of its
allies. Communications technology, which has been a force for democratic
change, has also proven to be a powerful enabler for recruitment to
groups like ISIL, and facilitated its ability to coordinate attacks in
Paris, Brussels, Istanbul, and across the Levant. The rise of social
media has allowed remote groups to have a global presence; consider, in
an age before propaganda videos could "go viral," would Abubakar Shekau,
the leader of Boko Haram, have a presence outside of the Lake Chad
Basin? Further, the innovations that have made life easier for affluent
Westerners, including personal computers and web- or cloud-based
technologies, are increasingly being exploited by criminal groups to
gather funds and collect valuable personal information. Even more
troubling than the rise of internet scams, however, is the looming
possibility of major hacks and cyber warfare. The "Sony Hack" in the
fall of 2014 was quickly relegated to a late-night punch line,
overlooking the significance of North Korean operatives having the
capacity to hack into a multibillion dollar company. The following
summer, news broke that the U.S. Office of Personnel Management had been
hacked. The records of an estimated 21.5 million people who had worked
for, or had applied for positions within the U.S. federal government
were compromised in the breach, which was traced to China. Third,
**[many]{.underline}** of the **[states within the international
community are at a severe handicap in their efforts to mitigate the
unprecedented threats to their sovereignty]{.underline}**. Their
**[weakness is exacerbated by networked adversaries, of either the
terrorist]{.underline}**, insurgent, **[or criminal types, which eat
away at state institutions]{.underline}**---and more importantly, erode
the social contract between governments and the governed. **[The
proliferation of weak, fragile, and failed states leaves big holes in
the rule-based system of sovereign states, thus weakening the system,
and rendering vulnerable all the gains that flow from that system. An
alternative model of global disorder is emerging in which the public
good or public interest is a constant casualty. In this alternate global
disorder, pure self-interest, violence, and deceit are the major
currencies, and the vulnerable of the earth are the constant
victims]{.underline}**. Finally, **[strong states, led by trusted,
capable governments that are accountable to their populations, are the
most effective line of defense against these threats]{.underline}**.
While "state-building" has become anathema in some circles, it is clear
that **[improving state governance is a necessary corrective measure in
the fight against endemic insecurity]{.underline}**. Learning from our
previous endeavors and identifying effective means of building partner
capacity is necessary if the United States is to remain a global leader.
Exporting democracy, defined merely by elections, without corresponding
rule of law and economic development, will likely exacerbate the
disruptive dynamics already at play. Though these themes are addressed
by all of the authors, the correct "solution" to the problems described
is elusive, and remains a source of disagreement even among the most
reasonable people. What role should America play in global ideological
conflicts, how legal and regulatory systems should adapt to technology,
and how best to promote state-building globally are all thorny questions
with no obvious answers. Undeniable, though, is that the **[discussions
surrounding how America]{.underline}** and its allies **[must respond to
these challenges should be well-informed, nuanced, and
timely]{.underline}**. Ultimately, our purpose is not to offer a
comprehensive review of every threat facing the United States and its
allies or to prescribe solutions. Rather, it is to provide insight for
understanding the contemporary threat environment, and offer strategies
to mitigate the accelerating trends and forces that threaten us. If this
book contributes to a reorientation away from our siloed, traditional
approach to analyzing national security, to **[a more holistic
understanding of the threat landscape]{.underline}** we face in the 21st
century, we will count ourselves successful. Most importantly, we hope
that **[this]{.underline}** book **[will generate discussions
recognizing the gravity of these threats among those with the power to
affect change in our current policies for addressing]{.underline}** the
**[challenges]{.underline}** on the horizon, in our backyards, **[in our
bureaucracies, and in our future]{.underline}**. Notes 1 The Fund for

\[WILLIAMS\]

I. Slouching Toward Dystopia 1 The Global Crisis of Governance Phil
Williams **[The world has entered a period of kaleidoscopic, irregular
conflicts in which the reassertion of traditional geopolitical rivalries
is inextricably linked with the activities of a bewildering assortment
of violent nonstate actors (VNSAs)]{.underline}**. States in the Middle
East, for example, increasingly define national interests in terms of
sectarianism; however, the civil war in Islam is being played out not
only in the direct, competitive dynamic of Saudi Arabia and Iran, but
also through the proxies these two states use, **[including sectarian
factions, tribes, warlords, insurgents, and transnational criminal
organizations (TCOs). These VNSAs pursue their own agendas, yet interact
and ally with states when it is convenient and advantageous to do so.
They might, on occasion, act as state proxies; but, they are not pawns.
On the contrary, they generate their own conflict dynamics and follow
strategic imperatives that sometimes complement the actions of their
state allies, but, on other occasions, can equally well confound
them]{.underline}**. In South Asia, D-Company, the criminal organization
led by Dawood Ibrahim, is closely allied with Pakistan's intelligence
agency, Inter-Service Intelligence (ISI). Indeed, D-Company is used by
ISI to provide money and logistic support for terrorist actions against
India, and for assistance in introducing counterfeit currency into
India. The organization also provides plausible deniability for ISI and
for Pakistan, in return for which Pakistan provides sanctuary and
protection.1 The relationship is symbiotic and D-Company enjoys a high
degree of impunity, while continuing to profit from its extensive
portfolio of transnational criminal activities. Moreover, at times, its
close relationship with Pakistani intelligence and military services has
hindered efforts to improve relations between India and Pakistan. In
other words, **[traditional geopolitics is alive and well, but is
sharing the stage with a variety of new players that are useful to
states but are not necessarily or not fully under state control. This is
a complex picture in which states]{.underline}**, at the very least,
**[remain the major players, and often set the frameworks within which
VNSAs operate. At the same time, VNSAs add elements of fluidity and
unpredictability, complicating state calculations and rendering desired
outcomes uncertain]{.underline}**. Both Iraq and Afghanistan have
revealed that favorable power asymmetries do not guarantee victory, that
military power often matters less than political resilience, and that
even political success can prove impossible to sustain. **[Such
complexities and uncertainties are increasingly reflected in current
U.S. military planning with its focus on gray zones, irregular
operations, and hybrid enemies, as well as its reliance on technological
superiority to provide what has been characterized as the "third
offset."]{.underline}**2 **[Underlying this panorama of actors, and
somewhat obscured by the current crises and tensions, is a fundamental
global trend in which the nature of governance provided by many states
is inadequate and unable to meet the needs, demands, and expectations of
their citizens. In other words, the Westphalian order is undergoing a
long-term secular decline that is bringing with it]{.underline}** a
series of convulsions along with what Nathan Freier terms, "**[prolific
insecurity]{.underline}**."3 **[This does not mean that the state is
going away anytime soon; the state remains critical in defining
political order, and will continue to play much of that role for the
foreseeable future]{.underline}**. **[Yet there is an important, albeit
often unrecognized, distinction between failed states and failed
governance. Governance can fail dismally even while the formal state
remains intact. In many cases around the world, state governance is
failing to meet the needs of citizens even as states continue to meet
all the formalities of statehood and are recognized by their peers as
part of the international community]{.underline}**. Sovereignty as a
formal legal status in which the state recognizes no higher authority
than itself and mandates nonintervention in its domestic affairs is
alive and thriving; sovereignty as exclusive and full territorial
control and protection of citizens within the area of the state's
jurisdiction, however, is increasingly illusionary. **[As a result,
other actors are stepping in, both to challenge the state directly and
to provide governance where the state has limited presence or is simply
absent. In many countries, especially in the developing world, the
traditional equation between the state and governance has broken down.
This has four major consequences: high levels of violence in many
societies]{.underline}**, the rise of alternative loyalties that
supersede loyalty to the state, **[the emergence of alternative
governance mechanisms, and large numbers of refugees and migrant flows
from countries where governance---but not the state---has effectively
failed]{.underline}**. These consequences are discussed more fully
below. Although there is considerable hand-wringing over what is often
seen as the failure of global governance, it should be emphasized that
this is not what is being discussed here. **[This]{.underline}** chapter
**[is not about global governance; it is concerned with governance at
the state level, which is becoming a problem of truly global proportions
and one that can only exacerbate the shortcomings of global institutions
and thereby underline the paucity of effective global
governance]{.underline}**. **[If the constituent units that make up the
global community of states cannot effectively govern the territory and
populations they nominally control, then developing common solutions to
global challenges such as climate change will likely prove
impossible]{.underline}**.

##  Drone Leadership Scenario

#### US is losing drone leadership

**Boyle 15** Michael J. Boyle, 2015, \"The Race for Drones,\" Michael J.
Boyle is an Associate Professor of Political Science at La Salle
University and a Senior Fellow at the
ForeignPolicyResearchInstitute.,<https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0030438714000763>
date accessed 7/2/19)

Such [complacency about the consequences of a global race for drones is
not warranted]{.underline}. Today[, America's comparative advantage in
drones is being eroded as drone technology is spreading across the
international system]{.underline}. While their current technology lags,
and in some cases merely imitates, U.S. drone models, [global
competitors such as China and Russia are now spending billions to catch
up to the United States in research and development for drone
technology]{.underline}. The U.S. lead will remain for the next decade
or more, but [the substantial Chinese, Russian and European investments
in drone research and production will gradually match the technological
advantage currently held by U.S. companies]{.underline}. Moreover, [the
United States is not the dominant player in the current export market
for drones.]{.underline} Israel has become the world's supplier of first
resort, selling drone technology to a large number of other states for
domestic and military uses[. Due to U.S. and Israeli exports, and the
efforts of other states to develop drone export markets, drones have now
spread to most established militaries in the developed world. Between
2004 and 2011, the number of states with active UAV programs doubled,
from 40 to over 80.5]{.underline} More than one third of the states in
the world have developed their own drones programs, ranging from
relatively small boutique programs to growing multi-purpose drone
programs used for combat, surveillance and civilian uses. According to a
RAND study, 23 countries are developing their own technology for
different types of armed drones.6 [Even in an era of austerity and steep
cuts in defense spending, the demand for drones is increasing, leading a
growing number of states to consider joining the export market. The
American and Israeli companies that traditionally have dominated the
drones market are now facing increasingly stiff competition from Chinese
companies who are developing dozens of drone models for the
export]{.underline} market. The competition will only become more
intense as new arms manufacturers from Europe, Russia, and the Middle
East begin to catch up. Moreover, [many of these states, such as Russia
and China, face fewer export restrictions and will be able to sell
sophisticated drones to governments not authorized by the U.S. Congress
to receive comparable American models.]{.underline} The result is that
drones of increasing quality will soon be in the hands of states such as
Iran, Syria, and North Korea.7 Similarly[, non-state actors will get
into the race for drones, as the United States recently discovered when
Jabhat al-Nusra and ISIS deployed drones to coordinate attacks against
targets in Syria. 8]{.underline} The long-term strategic consequences of
this new arms race in drones around the world will not be known for
decades. At this point, drones are not an immediate strategic game
changer in the way that nuclear weapons once were[. A better analogy is
the diffusion of military aircraft]{.underline}: after the pioneering
use of heavierthan-air aircraft by the U.S. in 1910, all of the major
powers at the time---Britain, France, Austria, Germany and
Italy---rapidly followed suit with their own military aviation programs,
while many other states became purchasers of aviation from dominant
American, British and other European suppliers. The diffusion of
military aircraft (of varying quality) continued throughout the
1930-1940s to the point [where almost every major military in the world
boasted at least a token military aviation capability]{.underline}. Over
time, it became a mark of prestige for a state to have an air force even
if it conveyed little more than symbolic value. [By the late 1940s, it
was clear that the diffusion of military aviation was creating dramatic
strategic consequences, either by resetting the terms of competition for
existing rivalries or by introducing a degree of uncertainty into
regional balances of power.]{.underline}

The world is now approaching a similar point with [drones as the race
for this technology is resetting the terms of global competition
and]{.underline} quietly [altering the rules]{.underline} of the game
[for many long-simmering conflicts and rivalries]{.underline}. This is
happening in part because few, if any, [states will use drones in the
way that the United States currently does, as a way to ruthlessly target
militant networks in ungoverned territories.]{.underline} Rather, the
proliferation of drones will also be accompanied by rapid adaption of
drones to new, and perhaps unforeseen, civilian and military uses, which
will have three consequences for the international system. [First, the
proliferation of drones will reset the rules and norms governing
surveillance]{.underline} and reconnaissance [and invite new
counter-measures that may]{.underline} paradoxically [increase
uncertainty between regional rivals]{.underline} over the long run[.
Second]{.underline}, as a low-cost, apparently low-risk form of
technology[, drones will become increasingly useful to governments in
testing the strategic commitments and the nerves of their rivals. Even
today, a number of governments and rebel groups facing regional
rivalries have started to use drones in ways that chip away at the
foundations of previously stable deterrent relationships. Third, the
worldwide proliferation of drones in contested airspace]{.underline},
and the increasing risk that a drone will have an accident with a
civilian aircraft, [multiplies the chances of a conflict spiral stemming
from an accident or drone misuse. Given these risks, it is in
Washington's interest to take a leading role in slowing the race for
drones and developing new legal, institutional and normative mechanisms
to govern drone usage and sale in the future.]{.underline}

#### China currently 'selling the hell' out of drones, US market entrance likely to backfire 

**Turak 19** (Natasha Turak, CNBC Correspondent \["Pentagon is
scrambling as China 'sells the hell out of' armed drones to US allies",
CNBC Defense\]

//em\
**As one U.S. official at Abu Dhabi's international defense expo, IDEX,
put it this week[, "China has been selling the hell out of its drones"
to Gulf militaries like those of the United Arab Emirates (UAE) and
Saudi Arabia.]{.underline} The U.S., while a top security partner to
these states, currently does not supply them with its armed drone
technology due to strict export regulations. But in the face of record
Middle East defense spending and encroaching foreign competition, it's
under renewed pressure to do just that. Lt. Gen. Charles Hooper,
director of the Pentagon's Defense Security Cooperation Agency (DSCA),
emphasized changes underway to [the Conventional Arms Transfer (CAT)
policy, which has thus far prevented the sale of armed drones to
Washington's Arab allies.]{.underline} "[As an element of the changes to
the CAT policy, we've reviewed and are in the process of implementing
changes to our policy with respect to unmanned aerial
systems,"]{.underline} Hooper told media at the conference Sunday. "We
want to make many of our unmanned aerial systems available to our
partners. Many of them have been asking for some time, we're going to
move forward as quickly as possible." Those systems that Gulf allies
have wanted include the lethal MQ-9 Reaper, produced by General Atomics,
a hunter-killer drone that can carry up to four hellfire missiles as
well as laser-guided bombs and joint direct attack munitions (JDAMs).
What's been stopping the sales include concerns over proliferation, or
risks that it could end up in the wrong hands.** **"We will still
continue to vet those cases, look at each of those on a case-by-case
basis," Hooper said. "But [we do understand that it's a very competitive
world out there and we want to ensure that we are doing everything in
our power to provide U.S. systems, the best in the world, to our
partners."]{.underline} Why the Gulf is buying Chinese drones in the
first place [Simply put, China's weaponized drones are on the market
when others aren't. The UAE has had Chinese Wing Loong I drones since
2016, and started receiving its purchases of the upgraded and deadlier
Wing Loong II in early 2018. The UAVs, intended for surveillance and
reconnaissance, can carry a range of weapons including missiles and
laser-guided bombs to blow up targets on land or in the air. The Saudis
have bought China's CH-4 and the Wing Loong II, and both countries have
deployed their drones in Yemen. Last summer, Riyadh confirmed that the
Chinese were building a CH-4 production facility --- the first drone
factory in the region --- in Saudi Arabia. The CH-4, an ISR
(intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance) and attack drone with
similarities to the Reaper, is also used by the UAE, Iraq and Egypt. In
addition to being able to sell to any willing buyer, the Chinese also
offer the lowest prices on the market.]{.underline} According to Jack
Watling, a land warfare expert at the Royal United Services Institute
(RUSI) in London, [the UAE's Chinese drone purchases began after the the
U.S. refused to sell them American armed UAVs. Now, he says, "the
(President Donald) Trump administration has reduced its threshold for
sale, which partly happened after the UAE started its Chinese drone
purchases." Gulf militaries do have American drones, but not ones
capable of destroying targets]{.underline}. These include the U.S.-made
Predator XP, which can carry ISR camera packages, but it's downgraded so
that it can't carry weapons systems. Still, Watling says, U.S platforms
are better than their Chinese counterparts --- and if given the
opportunity, buyers would likely choose those. "Chinese UAS (unmanned
aerial systems) are not as stable as American systems," he explained.
"They therefore have to fly lower, though they are improving. This has
resulted in several Chinese platforms being shot down." 'Definitely a
threat' ["The Chinese are definitely a threat," Gerard Robottom,
international market area director at California-based UAV manufacturer
AeroVironment, told CNBC at the conference. But he stressed that
reliability is key, adding, "you can find a lot of our customers out
here, and they'll tell you the importance of a good ISR from a reputable
company." Robottom's colleagues attested to the lengthy U.S. government
process for approving even non-lethal drone exports, which they
described as a hindrance to international business]{.underline}. "This
is something the administration takes very seriously," Michael Bedke,
senior regional policy advisor at the Pentagon's Defense Technology
Security Administration, told CNBC at the event. "As part of the CAT
implementation policy \... there were lines of effort that looked at how
we could provide more systems and more advanced systems to the region,
and how we can speed up the process to allow us to transfer those
systems as well." In November, as part of the Trump administration's
push to sell more weapons abroad, the State Department released updates
to the CAT policy featuring measures to speed up arms transfers and
reduce previous restrictions. The first task listed in the State
Department's policy update read: "Effectively compete with strategic
competitors by providing allies and partners with alternatives to
foreign defense articles in order to maintain U.S. influence in key
regions." \... But it could backfire But [supplying the technology to
the Gulf could backfire on the U.S., Watling says. The U.S. provides its
allies ISR in exchange for access and leverage; "if they sell the
platforms, and the UAE and Saudis get good at using them, then they will
be less dependent on the U.S." And in the current political climate,
where international criticism of Saudi Arabia and its role, along with
the UAE's, in Yemen's bloody conflict is at a high, the optics may not
be particularly welcomed. "If the U.S. provides Predators or Reapers,
and the UAE and Saudis start striking more targets --- some of which may
not match with U.S. priorities --- then there could be backlash against
the U.S.]{.underline}," Watling said. Because of concerns like this, the
Pentagon's Bedke stressed that the transfer process would remain on a
case-by-case basis. "But the new policies in place will give us more
flexibility," he said, "and I would continue to watch this space in the
next couple of months to see what happens."**

#### China consistently dominates UCAV market

**Peck 19** (Michael Peck, contributing writer for the National Interest
\["A Really Big Deal: China is a Drone Superpower.", The National
Interest\]
<https://nationalinterest.org/blog/buzz/really-big-deal-china-drone-superpower-47692)//em>\
**For years, drone warfare has been an essentially American pursuit. The
new age of armed robots has been symbolized by Predators and Reapers
spewing Hellfire missiles. But guess who's the biggest exporter of
combat drones? China. "[In 2014--18 China became the largest exporter in
the niche market of unmanned combat aerial vehicles (UCAVs), with states
in the Middle East among the main recipients]{.underline}," according to
the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute, which compiles
estimates of global military strength and arms spending. Indeed, combat
drones are spreading across the globe. "The number of countries that
import and use unmanned combat aerial vehicles (UCAVs)---which are
remotely controlled armed aircraft often referred to as armed
drones---continued to increase in 2014-18," SIPRI said. "There is
widespread discussion about the impact of UCAV proliferation on peace
and security. [China has become the primary exporter of UCAVs. Whereas
China exported 10 UCAVs to 2 countries in 2009-13, in 2014-18 it
exported 153 to 13 countries---5 of which are in the Middle East: Egypt,
Iraq, Jordan, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates (UAE). In
contrast, the United States delivered three UCAVs in 2009-13 and five in
2014-18. In both periods all the deliveries were to the United Kingdom.
Iran delivered 10 UCAVs to Syria in 2014-18, while the UAE delivered 2
to Algeria."]{.underline} This explains why the U.S. Army, which has
been lackadaisical about air defense for years, is now suddenly
interested. Nations such as Iran are far inferior to the United States
in conventional combat weapons such as tanks and jet fighters, but it
doesn't take much money or advanced technology to strap a bomb onto a
small drone that's hard to detect or shoot down. China's arms exports
are slowing after a massive surge over the last few years. After nearly
tripling between 2004 and 2013, they increased by only 2.7 percent over
the 2014 to 2018. Interestingly, China's more aggressive foreign policy
in Asia has hampered its arms exports. "China's arms exports are limited
by the fact that many countries---including 4 of the top 10 arms
importers in 2014-18 (India, Australia, South Korea and Vietnam)---will
not procure Chinese arms for political reasons," SIPRI noted. During the
Cold War and after, China was notorious as an exporter of cheap
knockoffs of old Soviet hardware such as tanks and jet fighters. Yet
[China's push to develop Western-style smart weapons, from aircraft
carriers to stealth fighters, appears to be paying economic dividends.
"Improvements in Chinese military technology have opened up
opportunities for arms export growth, including exports to new
custom­ers," said SIPRI.]{.underline} "[The number of countries to which
China delivers major arms has grown significantly over the past few
years.]{.underline} In 2014-18 China delivered major arms to 53
countries, compared with 41 in 2009-13 and 32 in 2004-2008. Pakistan was
the main recipient (37 per cent) in 2014-18, as it has been for all
five-year periods since 1991. China supplied relatively small volumes of
major arms to a wide variety of countries: 39 of the 53 recipients in
2014-18 each accounted for less than 1 per cent of total Chinese arms
exports." However, China's arms exports haven't totally dampened
Beijing's appetite for imported---mostly Russian---arms. China was the
world's sixth-largest importer of weapons between 2014 and 2018, down 7
percent from the 2009 to 2013 time period. "Russia accounted for 70 per
cent of Chinese arms imports in 2014-18," SIPRI estimated. "China
remains reliant on imports for certain arms technologies such as engines
for combat aircraft and large ships as well as long-range air and
missile defense systems. Its own arms industry has yet to develop the
technological capability to match Rus­sian suppliers in these fields."**

#### China's market for UAVs continues to grow 

**Waldron 19** (Greg Waldron, Asia Managing Editor, FlightGlobal
\["China finds its UAV export sweet spot", FlightGlobal\]
<https://www.flightglobal.com/news/articles/china-finds-its-uav-export-sweet-spot-457947/)//em>\
**[The export of medium altitude, long endurance (MALE) UAVs has been a
distinct bright spot in China\'s efforts to join the ranks of the
world\'s leading defense aerospace exporters.]{.underline}** According
to figures from the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute
(SIPRI), which tracks global arms flows, China exported 163 large,
weapons-capable UAVs to 13 countries from 2008 to 2018. By comparison,
SIPRI data suggests that USA manufacturer General Atomics delivered just
15 MQ-9 Reaper systems to international customers in the past 10 years,
with outstanding international orders for 28 additional examples. UAV
giant Israel has exported about 167 MALE UAVs of the Hermes and Heron
series during the same period, with these assets serving in the
intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance (ISR) missions -- not
attack roles). In recent years, China National Aero-Technology Import &
Export Corporation (CATIC) has had a prominent presence at major
international air shows, including static displays of mock-ups of the
AVIC Wing Loong I and Wing Loong II UAVs. The Wing Loong family has long
been a staple at the biennial Air Show China in Zhuhai. The type
regularly appears surrounded by an array of bombs and guided missiles.
In addition, China has enjoyed success selling the China Aerospace
Science and Technology Corporation (CASC) Cai Hong (\"Rainbow\") series
of UAVs, which includes the Cai Hong 3 (CH-3) and larger CH-4. Siemon
Wezeman, senior researcher at SIPRI, says **[China has enjoyed
\"amazing\" progress in the Middle East and African UAV markets in
recent years. \"Over the years they\'ve gotten to know the market
better, and are much slicker now.\" In addition to provoking the ire of
western UAV manufacturers, Beijing\'s efforts in the export space have
attracted the attention of the Pentagon. It mentioned the UAV exports in
its recent annual report to congress about Chinese military
developments. \"China\'s market for armed UAVs continues to grow; China
now sells Caihong series UAVs to at least Burma, Iraq, Pakistan, Saudi
Arabia, and the United Arab Emirates,\" says the report. \"China faces
little competition for these sales; most armed UAV exporters have signed
the Missile Technology Control Regime (MTCR) and/or the Wassenaar
Arrangement on export controls for conventional arms and dual-use goods
and technologies and face sales restrictions.\"]{.underline}** SIPRI
data indicates that **[the most prolific Chinese MALE UAV export is the
type apparently shot down in Yemen, the Wing Loong I, with 62 examples.
Major customers include the United Arab Emirates, Saudi Arabia, and
Egypt.]{.underline}** An AVIC flyer distributed at Zhuhai in 2018
indicates that the system has an endurance of 20h and a maximum payload
capacity of 200kg (440lb), sufficient for a single missile under each
wing. The system only needs 1,000m (3,280ft) to take off and 600m for
landing. Take-off and landing are both conducted automatically, and the
aircraft boasts an encrypted data link. In addition, it is capable of
electronic intelligence and jamming. The Wing Loong II, of which Beijing
has sold 15 to Saudi Arabia, 15 to Turkmenistan, and an unspecified
number to Egypt, is far more capable. Whereas the Wing Loong I has a
maximum take-off weight (MTOW) of 1,200kg, the Wing Loong II\'s MTOW is
4,200kg. As with its smaller sibling, it includes a ground control
station and integrated logistics system. It has three hardpoints on each
wing. An AVIC flyer for the type shows it carrying 10 air-to-ground
munitions, with four mounted on dual racks. Sensor payloads include an
electro-optical (EO) surveillance/targeting system and a synthetic
aperture radar. **[AVIC states that users can customise the system for
\"electronic intelligence, radar jamming, communications intelligence,
intelligence collection, photo reconnaissance, communications relay,
search and rescue, as well as other advanced payloads, data link
equipment, and airborne weapons\".]{.underline}** AVIC has also
developed another variant of the family, the Wing Loong ID, an upgraded
version of the Wing Loong I that is specifically designed for the export
market. The system had its maiden flight on 23 December 2018. The
aircraft is entirely made of composites and its basic payload is an EO
pod and a synthetic aperture radar. It has four hardpoints that can
accommodate 10 types of missiles or bombs. It has a more powerful engine
than the Wing Loong I, its MTOW is 300kg higher, at 1,500kg, and it can
carry an external payload of 400kg. In addition, SIPRI shows that 44
CH-3s have been sold to users such as Algeria, Myanmar, Nigeria,
Pakistan and Turkmenistan. Twenty CH-4s have been delivered to Algeria,
Iraq, Jordan and Saudi Arabia. In addition, in 2017, Riyadh entered an
agreement to produce CH-4s locally as it seeks to develop its aerospace
sector. The MALE UAV segment represents a notable area where China has
made inroads with defence buyers that are typically strong customers of
US and European defence equipment. Owing to the vagaries of the MTCR,
selling assets such as the MQ-9 Reaper to countries such as Egypt, Saudi
Arabia and the United Arab Emirates has been off limits. This is despite
the large numbers of advanced US combat jets, attack helicopters and
smart weapons found in the air forces of these countries. This has
allowed Chinese UAV manufacturers to seize significant market share in
one of the defence industry\'s frontier market segments. **[\"Chinese
manufacturers appear to have spotted a gap in the market as a result of
US restrictions on the sale of armed UAVs and have used this as a route
to market,\"]{.underline}** says Douglas Barrie, senior fellow for
Military Aerospace with International Institute for Strategic Studies in
London. **[\"Beijing has made sales in the Middle East to countries that
have traditionally more often bought US systems. In terms of advantages
the most obvious is the ability to acquire an armed UAV, with China
offering a range of air-to-surface munitions and missiles either already
integrated or capable of being integrated. The systems are also likely
price competitive. Disadvantages likely cover a less capable overall
performance, and possible training and support
deficiencies.\"]{.underline}** Another advantage that Chinese systems
offer as opposed to western systems is that Beijing is less selective
with its clientele. \"The Chinese will sell without asking questions,\"
says Wezeman. \"The Chinese will just take one look at you and sell to
you. Western suppliers will look at you and give you a list of
conditions.\" Despite strong sales, however, there are questions about
the quality of Chinese systems. One area of weakness lies in turboprop
engines -- engines are a persistent problem with Chinese-produced
aircraft. This shows up in performance. The MQ-9B Reaper, for example,
has published service ceiling of 49,000ft, while that for the Wing Loong
II is 29,500ft. The Reaper is also faster, with a top speed of 260kt
(480km/h), compared with 199kt for the Chinese aircraft. Of course, a
Wing Loong II likely costs a fraction of an MQ-9B. A ChinaPower report
on Chinese UAV technologies indicates that a Wing Loong II likely costs
\$1-2 million, compared with \$16 million for the Reaper. Experts also
question the datalinks of Chinese systems, suggesting that they are not
as robust as those available for similar western platforms. China is
also working its way up the technology ladder. AVIC promoted its
turbojet-powered Cloud Shadow strike/reconnaissance UAV at the 2017
Dubai air show, where it displayed a mock-up of the type. In the armed
role, the Cloud Shadow can carry up to 400kg of munitions on four or six
hardpoints, while it can also be configured with a range of EO sensors
and used in search and rescue. Its endurance is up to 4h and it has an
operating altitude of 41,000ft. \"China, in particular, has become an
increasingly influential player, taking advantage of that hole in the
market,\" says a Royal United Services Institute paper on UAV exports to
the Middle East. **[\"Some within China believe that by implementing a
selective export policy on drones, the US was trying to maintain its
dominant and exclusive role in the field. Instead, by capitalising on
the gap created in the market, over the past few years, Beijing has
supplied armed drones to several countries that are not authorised to
purchase them from the US, and at a dramatically cheaper
price.\"]{.underline}**

###  AT: US-China War

#### No War -- arms sales are priced in -- Trump and Xi don't want political consequences of war

**Hu** 20**18** -- Weixing Hu is a Professor and Head of the Department
of Politics and Public Administration, University of Hong Kong
("Trump\'s China Policy and Its Implications for the \"Cold Peace\"
across the Taiwan Strait," *China Review*, Volume 18, Number 3) bhb

U.S. arms sales to Taiwan are an important issue that may affect future
cross-Strait relations during the Trump administration. Through the 1979
Taiwan Relations Act, Washington considers itself obliged to continue
providing arms to Taiwan to defend itself. For a long time, U.S. arms
sales have also been considered an important source of leverage for
Washington to interfere in cross-Strait relations. For decades after the
establishment of formal diplomatic relations between the United States
and PRC, Washington has maintained its influence in cross-Strait
relations by its arms sales to Taiwan. Beijing has tried very hard to
deprive Washington of this leverage but not successfully. Beijing\'s
strong reactions to the U.S. arms sales did not stop Washington\'s arms
sales. For Washington, Beijing\'s strong reaction indicates that with
growing economic and military strength, China has become less tolerant
of swallowing \"the bitter fruit\" of arms sales to Taiwan and has
attempted to change the rules of game on that issue. **[For Beijing,
Washington\'s consistent policy in arms sales to Taiwan also tells the
Chinese that it is still unrealistic to ask Washington to completely
stop selling arms to Taiwan, and it has to live with it for the
foreseeable future]{.underline}**. Under Trump, U.S. arms sales are very
likely to continue because the administration\'s policy in probusiness
and in favor of creating jobs for American workers. Actually, after just
a few months in office, the Trump administration announced a new arms
sales package to Taiwan. The issue could lead to a new round of
competition between Washington and Beijing. Despite the lack of a clear
Taiwan policy in the Trump administration, conservative members of the
U.S. Congress could take the initiative to drive the relationship and
become a source of conflict. These members have already introduced new
bills similar to the Taiwan Security Enhancement Act introduced a few
years ago in Congress to force the administration to upgrade U.S.-Taiwan
relations.36 Although the prospects of these bills becoming law are
weak, it could affect Trump\'s conduct in his China policy and policy
toward cross-Strait relations. 5. Conclusion **[The United States and
China have different views on the current \"cold peace\"]{.underline}**

overlapped interests in avoiding conflict and maintaining peace and
stability across the Taiwan Strait. Neither]{.underline}** President

84\] **[agenda.]{.underline}** The Trump administration, unlike the
Obama administration, does not have a clear regional strategy of hedging
and balancing against China in the Asia Pacific. It has no interest in
pushing Taipei and Beijing to the negotiation table either. It is
unlikely that the two sides of the Taiwan Strait will come up with a new
formulation that is equivalent to the 1992 Consensus or any other form
of reassurance toward each other. It is also unlikely the Tsai Ing-wen
government will rock the boat and move toward de jure Taiwan
independence. Therefore**[, if there are no new provocative actions from
the Tsai government, Beijing will withhold significant punitive actions
that may hurt the people in Taiwan. Beijing is preoccupied with its
domestic agenda.]{.underline}** As long as the Tsai government is not
pushing the envelope, Beijing will remain patient and let the status quo
continue. So **[cross-Strait and trilateral relations will remain in a

But beyond China's relationships with its customers, I think there is a
strategic agenda. **[China wants be a world power, and this ambition is
being advanced largely through technological means]{.underline}**. China
clearly wants to compete with Boeing and Airbus as a maker of civilian
airliners, and it has an equally ambitious space program. **[It is also
focused on leading the way in artificial intelligence and computer
technology.]{.underline}** China wants to be a world-class manufacturer
of weapons, too, and if it is going to make these weapons for its own
armed forces, it might as well export them. WPR: What are the
implications of Chinese arms sales in its immediate spheres of
influence? Roggeveen: In strategic terms, the most significant arms
export to Asia that China has ever conducted is still its transfer of
nuclear weapons technology to Pakistan. Next to that, everything else
pales for two reasons. First, **[the scale of Chinese conventional
weapons exports to the rest of Asia remains relatively
modest]{.underline}**---though, as the SIPRI figures show, it is clearly
growing. But second, **[if China were not exporting weapons to Asia,
countries would simply be purchasing them from elsewhere]{.underline}**.
Granted, China's presence in the market creates competition, presumably
driving down prices and improving overall quality. **[But the
conventional weapons Beijing is offering to the market are in ready
supply]{.underline}**, whereas nuclear weapons technology is much harder
to come by. For those reasons, **[I doubt Chinese arms sales make a huge
contribution to Beijing's ambitions for greater regional influence,
particularly in contrast to]{.underline}** its signature initiative,
known **[as One Belt, One Road.]{.underline}** China is offering fast,
large-scale infrastructure support, which other players such as the
World Bank, Asian Development Bank and bilateral donors do not provide.

Nor does the threat of transnational terrorism justify most arms sales.
Most fundamentally, the actual threat from Islamist-inspired terrorism
to Americans is extraordinarily low. Since 9/11, neither al Qaeda nor
the Islamic State has managed an attack on the American homeland. Lone
wolf terrorists inspired by those groups have done so, but since 9/11
those attacks have killed fewer than 100 Americans, an average of about
6 people per year. There is simply very little risk reduction to be
gained from any strategy. **[The idea that the United States should be
willing to accept the significant negative effects of arms sales for
minimal counterterrorism gains is seriously misguided]{.underline}**.49
Moreover, even if one believed that the benefits would outweigh the
potential costs, **[arms sales still have almost no value as a tool in
the war on terror for several reasons]{.underline}**. First, **[the bulk
of arms sales]{.underline}** (and those we considered in our risk
assessment) **[involve major conventional weapons, which are ill suited
to combatting terrorism]{.underline}**. **[Many U.S. arms deals since
9/11 have involved major conventional weapons systems such as fighter
jets, missiles, and artillery, useful for traditional military
operations, but of little use in fighting terrorists. Insurgencies that
hold territory]{.underline}**, like the Islamic State, are one thing,
but most terrorist groups do not advertise their location, nor do they
assemble in large groups. Second**[, there is little evidence from the
past 16 years that direct military intervention is the right way to
combat terrorism.]{.underline}** Research reveals that military force
alone "seldom ends terrorism."50 This comports with the American
experience in Afghanistan, Iraq, and elsewhere in the war on terror to
date. Despite regime change, thousands of air strikes, and efforts to
upgrade the military capabilities of friendly governments, the United
States has not only failed to destroy the threat of Islamist-inspired
terrorism, it has also spawned chaos, greater resentment, and a sharp
increase in the level of terrorism afflicting the nations involved.51
Given the experience of the United States since 2001, there is little
reason to expect that additional arms sales to countries like Saudi
Arabia, Pakistan, Qatar, or the United Arab Emirates will reduce
terrorism, much less anti-American terrorism specifically. Relatedly,
**[many arms deals since 9/11, made in the name of counterterrorism,
were irrelevant to U.S. goals in the global war on terror because they
provided weapons to governments fighting terrorist groups only
vaguely]{.underline}** (if at all) **[linked to al Qaeda or
ISI]{.underline}**S. Although selling weapons to the governments of
Nigeria or Morocco or Tunisia might help them combat violent resistance
in their countries, terrorist groups in those countries have never
targeted the United States. As a result, such arms deals cannot be
justified by arguing that they advance the goals of the United States in
its own war on terror in any serious way. Finally, **[arms sales are
completely useless to combat the largest terrorist threat to the U.S.
homeland]{.underline}** **[--- lone wolf attackers]{.underline}**
already living in the United States. As noted, none of the successful
attacks in the United States since 9/11 resulted from operations
directed by al Qaeda or ISIS. And in fact only two foiled attempts since
then --- the underwear bomber and the printer-bomb plot --- can be
ascribed to al Qaeda.52 Instead, in almost all cases, persons already
living in the United States, inspired by Islamist groups, decided to
carry out attacks on their own. Clearly, arms sales to foreign nations
won't help with that problem; rather, as many analysts have suggested,
amplifying conflicts abroad may well make the problem worse.53

**[Chinese manufacturer SZ DJI Technology Co Ltd, the world's largest
producer of consumer drones, said on Monday it plans to use a company
warehouse in California to assemble them, a move that follows security
concerns raised by some U.S. lawmakers. DJI said it will assemble its
Mavic 2 Enterprise Dual drones in Cerritos, California, after the U.S.
Customs and Border Protection determines that the U.S. produced value of
its drones will qualify under the U.S. Trade Agreements
Act.]{.underline}** That designation should make it easier for some U.S.
government agencies to buy the drones, the company said "This new
investment will expand DJI's footprint in the U.S. so we can better
serve our customers, create U.S. jobs, and strengthen the U.S. drone
economy," the company said in a statement. DJI has come under fire from
some lawmakers and security experts in the United States and was
criticized last week at a U.S. Senate Commerce subcommittee hearing by
security researchers. Senator Rick Scott, a Republican, asked at the
hearing if Congress should outlaw the U.S. sale of Chinese-made drones.
**["I think we're crazy to do business with the Chinese," Scott said
during the hearing. "We ought to be buying American products in every
way we can\.... They are not our friend."]{.underline}** Senator Ed
Markey, a Democrat, said at the hearing **[that Americans who own
Chinese-made drones are worried about individual privacy and security
concerns. "Chinese animate (drones) with their values, which are
inconsistent with ours]{.underline}**," Markey said. On June 10, U.S.
President Donald Trump said in a memo "the domestic production
capability for small unmanned aerial systems is essential to the
national defense." Harry Wingo, a faculty member at the National Defense
University, told the Senate panel **["the U.S. is over-reliant" on DJI,
saying its market share may exceed 70% globally.]{.underline}** **["The
glaring gap between U.S. and Chinese companies like DJI in the (drone)
platform market should be a wake up call," Wingo said. He suggested the
issue "presents a national risk, similar to that highlighted by
President Trump in calling out the risk of using 5G equipment from
Huawei in U.S. telecommunications networks."]{.underline}** Last month,
the U.S. Homeland Security Department (DHS) warned U.S. firms of the
risks to company data from Chinese-made drones. On June 13, three House
Republicans wrote DHS seeking more information about that alert. DJI
said in May it gives "customers full and complete control over how their
data is collected, stored, and transmitted."

out a new set of policies governing its exports of military equipment
abroad, with a focus on the idea that "economic security is national
security."]{.underline}** But the changes may fall short of what the
defense industry was hoping for, particularly when it comes to the
export of military drones. **[The new rules, rolled out April 19, create
broad new language emphasizing the need to consider economic benefits
when looking at potential weapon exports to partner nations. Peter
Navarro,]{.underline}** White House National Trade Council head, **[said
this change will allow allies and partners "to more easily obtain"
American security goods, which in turn improves the security of the
United States while "reducing" the need for them to buy Chinese and
Russian systems.]{.underline}** "For too long we have hamstrung
ourselves and limited our ability to provide our allies and partners
with the defensive capabilities they require, even when in the U.S.
interests," Navarro said. **[Tina Kaidanow,]{.underline}** principal
deputy assistant secretary for political-military affairs,
**[said]{.underline}** the change represents "efforts to do things a
little bit more strategically. **[We need to do, the U.S. government, a
better job of strategic advocacy for some of our companies. We need to
think about those areas where we can really enable sales
oversea."]{.underline}** Talking to reporters ahead of the announcement,
both noted that there will now be a 60-day period for feedback from
industry, which will help shape potential changes in the future.
**[However, the two offered few hard details about what would change for
conventional arms transfers, and Navarro declined to say what economic
impact could potentially be in terms of jobs or dollar figures. But
industry is excited about the possible impact.]{.underline}** "This is a
really big deal. These are issues that had typically been relegated to
the second tier," said Remy Nathan, vice president of the Aerospace
Industries Association. "Credit this administration, credit \[Secretary
of Defense Jim Mattis\] for putting partnerships in his top three
priorities." **[The U.S. defense industry continues to dominate on a
global scale. According to numbers from the Stockholm International
Peace Research Institute, American accounted for 34 percent of total
arms exports from 2013--17, with 98 countries buying American
goods.]{.underline}** The second largest exporter in the world, Russia,
accounted for 22 percent of weapon exports during that same period, with
47 countries as clients; [**China, the fifth-ranked exporter,
represented only 5.7 percent of global exports, with 48 countries.** But
where the U.S. is seeing a steep rise in competition is in the unmanned
vehicle sector, particularly from China, who has made inroads into the
traditionally U.S. dominated Middle East with their cheaper UAVs. **With
today's announcement, the U.S. has made two tweaks to how it handles
drone exports. The first is opening up the opportunity for companies to
sell systems via Direct Commercial Sales process, under which a company
and another nation can directly negotiate, rather than requiring a more
formal Foreign Military Sales process, where the U.S. government acts as
a go-between.** DCS sales are seen as faster than FMS sales. **Secondly,
the government is eliminating rules that marked unarmed systems with
laser-designator technology as "strike enabling," which put them in the
same category as armed drones, and hence received higher scrutiny.**
Kaidanow said the goal was to make sure "U.S. industry faces fewer
barriers and less confusion when they are attempting to compete against
other countries and marketing and selling those similar systems to our
partners. " **A new policy could make it easier to sell
\"strike-enabled\" unmanned systems abroad**. (Airman 1st Class Emily A.
Kenney/U.S. Air Force) While those changes will be welcomed by the UAV
industry, it falls short of what was expected and hoped for by major
producers of military drones**. It had been expected that the new policy
would reinterpret the "strong presumption of denial" clause in the
Missile Technology Control Regime, an international arms control
agreement among 35 nations that governs the export of missiles and
drones, a second source explained. The current clause makes it difficult
to approve the sale of category-1 drones capable of carrying
500-kilogram payloads for more than 300 kilometers.** The Obama
administration had set a standard of how it interprets the MTCR language
that some in industry have complained is too strict, and had expected to
see changed with this policy a "presumption of approval" for a specific
set of allies and partners in Europe, the Middle East and the
Asia-Pacific region. However, changes to the MTCR remain on the table
for the long term, with Kaidanow saying: "We are looking to ensure that
the MTCR keeps pace with the dynamic quality." While she did not explain
what changes to the MTCR may come**, American officials in October
floated a whitepaper to allies proposing that any air vehicle that flies
under 650 kilometers per hour would drop to "category-2" and thus be
subject to approval on a case-by-case basis, as opposed to having to
follow the more strict "category-1" policies.** Despite fears from
nongovernmental organizations that human rights concerns would be
weakened under the new policy, both Navarro and Kaidanow pushed back at
the idea human rights were being weakened under the new policy, with
Kaidanow saying "nothing" had changed from that regard. **Navarro added
that the policy continues to "require enhanced end use monitoring,
directing the federal government to work with partners to reduce
civilian casualties in conflict and championing principals of human
rights in international law, including the law of armed
conflict."**]{.underline}

#### Link - When US drone sales are restricted, China fills in

**Dudley 18** (Dominic Dudley is a writer concerning business and
politics in the Middle East; 12/17/18; "How China Is Fueling The Arms
Race In Drones In The Middle East";

accessed 7/2/19)

Armed drones have become an increasingly common sight in the skies
around the Middle East in recent years, notably in the war zones of
Iraq, Libya, Syria and Yemen. But rather than the most advanced Western
technology being used, it is a combination of Chinese imports and
home-grown alternatives that are being deployed by local armed forces.
**[The U.S. is the global leader in terms of military drone technology
but it has tough rules about which countries can buy
them.]{.underline}** **[That has forced Middle East governments to
either develop their own or look for other potential sources -- and it
is China that has taken advantage.]{.underline}** **[That is partly due
to the relatively low price of its drones, but also its willingness to
sell to any government that comes calling. Beijing's approach to drone
sales was characterized as one of "no questions asked"]{.underline}** in
a [paper](https://drones.rusi.org/) released by the Royal United
Services Institute (RUSI), a defence think-tank, in London on December
17. [**Even countries that have traditionally favored Western military
equipment have been turning to Beijing, after being rebuffed by
Washington.** For example, when Jordan's request to buy unarmed Predator
XP drones from the U.S. was turned down in 2015 it looked east, buying
two CH-4Bs drones from China Aerospace Science & Technology Corporation
(CASC) the following year.]{.underline} Similar episodes have played out
in Iraq, Saudi Arabia, the UAE and Turkey. When Iraq was refused
permission to buy MQ-1 or MQ-9 drones from the U.S. it invested in at
least three CH-4Bs from China. It has since used them on several hundred
missions against Islamic State forces. Saudi Arabia and the UAE have
also both bought Chinese drones. According to RUSI, in 2014 Saudi Arabia
bought two CH-4s from CASC and five larger and deadlier Wing Loong IIs
manufactured by Chengdu Aircraft Industry Group (CAIG). Riyadh has used
its drones in Yemen, with some of them stationed at the Sharurah and
Jizan airbases near the border. However, most drone strikes in Yemen are
thought to have been carried out by the U.S. or the UAE. Some of these
drones have been lost in the conflict. A CH-4 crashed in Yemen in August
2018 and another drone was lost the following month -- although it is
not clear if they were Saudi or UAE aircraft. The UAE's drone fleet
includes Wing Loongs and Wing Loong IIs from CAIG, which Abu Dhabi
started to buy after the U.S. refused to supply American-made armed
drones. As well as Yemen, the UAE appears to have [deployed its armed
drones in
Libya](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-libya-security/covert-emirati-support-gave-east-libyan-air-power-key-boost-u-n-report-idUSKBN1902K0)
in support for Khalifa Haftar's forces and in breach of the
international arms embargo on the country, according to a UN Panel of
Experts report. When Turkey was denied access to armed MQ-1 Predator
drones from the U.S. in 2008, they first turned to Israel and bought
unarmed Heron TPs. But in more recent years, Ankara has been pushing the
development of a domestic drone industry. So far Turkey has developed
two armed drones: the Anka-S from Turkish Aerospace Industries and the
Bayraktar TB2 made by Kale-Bayker. A third model, the Karayel, developed
by Vestel Defence Industry is thought to be in the testing phase. The
Bayraktar TB2 has been used for strikes against the Kurdistan Workers'
Party (PKK) in Turkey as well as in Kurdish areas of neighboring Syria.
**[A number of other countries have been developing their own drone
manufacturing capability and here too China is at times playing a
role.]{.underline}** In 2017, Saudi Arabia signed a [licensing
deal](https://www.ainonline.com/aviation-news/defense/2017-04-12/saudi-arabia-buying-and-building-chinese-armed-drones)
with CASC to manufacture its drones in the kingdom. The largest regional
operator of drones is Israel. Most of the time it uses the unmanned
aircraft for intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance. However, it
has at least three types of armed drone which have been used to conduct
strikes in Gaza and possibly in Egypt, Lebanon, Sudan and Syria too.
They are the Heron TP made by Israel Aerospace Industries, and the
Hermes 450 and the Hermes 900, both made by Elbit Systems. Israel is
also the most active exporter from the region, having delivered 165
drones to customers over the past three decades, according to RUSI.
However, with the exception of those sales to Turkey, all have gone
outside the region. Another country which has developed significant
capabilities in drone manufacturing is Iran, which has had to do so
while being largely cut off from international suppliers. As well as a
number of unarmed drones, there are two Iranian-made armed UAVs: the
Shahed-129, built by Shahed Aviation Industries, and the more recently
unveiled Mohajer 6, produced by Ghods UAV Industries. The design of the
Shahed-129 closely resembles Israel's Hermes 450, which suggests Iran
may have had access to that aircraft, possibly reverse engineering one
that was lost on a covert mission. For Iran, drones fit in well with its
doctrine of asymmetric warfare, which it has developed to compensate for
the limited abilities of its conventional forces compared to those of
its opponents. **[In terms of overall numbers, drones still make up only
a small element of the Middle East countries' arsenals.]{.underline}**
According to RUSI, the seven countries covered by its report have built
between 128 and 174 drones and have imported an estimated 23 drones from
China. **[However, in the future they are likely to become a more
significant tool for both surveillance and conducting
strikes.]{.underline}** One indication of the potential scale of
operations in the future is the fact that Saudi Arabia has a deal to buy
300 Wing Loong drones from CAIG. "**[The proliferation is likely to
continue]{.underline}**," said Aniseh Bassiri Tabrizi, a research fellow
at RUSI and co-author of its report. As drones become more common,
developing defenses to tackle them will also become more important. A
delegation of UAE officials visited French and Finnish companies that
manufacture anti-drone systems during the summer. [Ukrainian
companies](https://archive.crossborderinformation.com/Article/UAE%2fRegion+Ukraine+taps+new+Gulf+markets.aspx?date=20170908&docNo=16&qid=2&page=2)
have also been eyeing up the potential to sell anti-drone technology to
the region. And in June, Australia's DroneShield reported that an
unnamed Middle East country had placed a \$3.2m order for 70 of its
droneguns, which are designed to disable hostile drones, with further
orders "in the pipeline." With the market shifting away from it, the
U.S. has shown signs of changing its approach and relaxing its rules. In
April, the State Department unveiled a [new
policy](https://www.state.gov/r/pa/prs/ps/2018/04/280619.htm) on the
export of unmanned aerial systems which it said would remove barriers to
the global market "and avoid ceding export opportunities to competitors
where such self-imposed restrictions are unwarranted." To date, however,
that hasn't led to any reported sales to the Middle East. If they are
able to switch suppliers and buy American in the future, it is likely
that many Middle East governments will do so. At the moment, Western
countries including the U.S. and U.K. do not allow their systems to be
integrated with Chinese technology, including its drones. That
undermines the Chinese drones' utility to the likes of the UAE and Saudi
Arabia which have air forces based around Western aircraft. While
governments continue to build up their capabilities, the greatest use of
drones in and around the region to date has been by outside forces. In
particular, the U.S. has used them widely in Pakistan, Yemen and Somalia
for many years. According to one [recent
report](https://www.thedailybeast.com/trump-ramped-up-drone-strikes-in-americas-shadow-wars),
President Donald Trump's administration launched 238 drone strikes in
these three countries in 2017 and 2018.

later, the SUV exploded in flames, killing Saleh al-Samad, a top

**[Still, a shift away from a US-dominated world of structured
relationships and standing institutions and toward something else is
under way. What this alternative will be, however, remains largely
unknowable]{.underline}**. What we do know is that there is no
alternative great power willing and able to step in and assume what had
been the US role. China is a frequently mentioned candidate, but its
leadership is focused mostly on consolidating domestic order and
maintaining artificially high economic-growth rates to stave off popular
unrest. **[China's interest in regional and global institutions seems
designed mostly to bolster its economy and geopolitical influence,
rather than to help set rules and create broadly beneficial
arrangements.]{.underline}** Likewise, Russia is a country with a
narrowly-based economy led by a government focused on retaining power at
home and re-establishing Russian influence in the Middle East and
Europe. India is preoccupied with the challenge of economic development
and is tied down by its problematic relationship with Pakistan. Japan is
held back by its declining population, domestic political and economic
constraints, and its neighbors' suspicions. Europe, for its part, is
distracted by questions surrounding the relationship between member
states and the European Union. As a result, the whole of the continent
is less than the sum of its parts -- none of which is large enough to
succeed America on the world stage. But the absence of a single
successor to the US does not mean that what awaits is chaos. At least in
principle, the world's most powerful countries could come together to
fill America's shoes. In practice, though, this will not happen, as
these countries lack the capabilities, experience, and, above all, a
consensus on what needs doing and who needs to do it. A more likely
development is the emergence of a mix of order and disorder at both the
regional and global level. **[China will promote various trade,
infrastructure, and security mechanisms in Asia]{.underline}**. The 11
remaining members of the Trans-Pacific Partnership may launch their
trade pact without the US. **[Less clear is whether China is prepared to
use its influence to restrain North Korea, how India and Pakistan will
avoid conflict, and the resolution of Asia's many territorial disputes.
It is all too easy to imagine an Asian and Pacific future characterized
by higher spending on arms of all types -- and thus more susceptible to
violent conflict. The Middle East is already suffering unprecedented
instability]{.underline}**, the result of local rivalries and realities,
and of 15 years during which the US arguably first did too much and then
too little to shape the region's future. The immediate danger is not
just further deterioration in failed states such as Yemen, Syria, and
Libya, but also direct conflict between Saudi Arabia and Iran.

that the Jordanian air force displayed a CH-4 in public. "Marketed by
Aerospace Long-March International Trade, the CH-4B has found a good
market here in the Middle East, in part due to the reluctance of U.S.
authorities to sell armed UAVs to their allies in the region,"
Al-Monitor reported. "Egypt, Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates and

**[The Jordanian air force has put up for sale six Chinese-made CH-4B

its CH-4s **[just three years after acquiring them.]{.underline}** But
it's possible **[the divestment is related to Jordan's ongoing efforts
to source Predator-style drones from the United States.]{.underline}**
"The general command of the Jordanian armed forces \... announces its
desire to sell the following aircraft," the defense ministry in Amman
stated on June 3, 2019. The for-sale list includes four CASA transports,
an old C-130B cargo plane, 12 Hawk 63 training jets, six MD530
helicopters and six CH-4s**[. Jordan bought the missile-armed CH-4s,
which are broadly similar to General Atomics' early-model Predators
around 2016 after the administration of U.S. president Barack Obama
rejected Amman's request for MQ-1 Predators.]{.underline}** General
Atomics also makes the larger MQ-9 Reaper drone. The Jordanian air
force's No. 9 Squadron operated the Chinese-made drones. The same unit
operates the air force's other unmanned aerial vehicle, including
Schiebel S-100 Camcopters and Leonardo Falcos. It wasn't until May 2018
that the Jordanian air force displayed a CH-4 in public. "Marketed by
Aerospace Long-March International Trade, the CH-4B has found a good
market here in the Middle East, in part due to the reluctance of U.S.
authorities to sell armed UAVs to their allies in the region,"
Al-Monitor reported. "Egypt, Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates and
Iraq have all acquired the CH-4B armed version, and the type has been
employed widely on operations in Yemen and against Daesh targets in
Iraq." But **[Jordan never gave up trying to get permission to buy
American drones, which are widely considered as having better sensors,
weapons and communications links than the Chinese drones do. Amman
perhaps believes Pres. Donald Trump is more open to approving drone
sales to Middle East customers, not only for the military benefit but
also as a way of commercially competing with China.]{.underline}**

accessed 7/2/19)

**[China is cashing in on the demand for armed drones]{.underline}**,
according to a new Department of Defense report. China was the fifth
largest arms supplier in the world between 2012 and 2016, the report,
titled "Assessment on U.S. Defense Implications of China's Expanding
Global Access," said. The Chinese completed more than \$20 million in
sales with the country's second largest arms sales going to the Middle
East and North Africa "likely due to the demand for armed" unmanned
aerial vehicles. The
[report](https://media.defense.gov/2019/Jan/14/2002079292/-1/-1/1/EXPANDING-GLOBAL-ACCESS-REPORT-FINAL.PDF),
dated December 2018 but made available Jan. 14, is mandated by law.
**[The report notes that the drone and armed drone market is a niche
market but China is one of the world's few suppliers. In large part to
China's apparent willingness to export such technology to other nations,
the number of nations across the globe with armed drones has grown
significantly in recent years.]{.underline}** The United States was the
first nation to use this technology in combat zones. However**[, the
United States has historically been limited in sharing its technology
with other nations and partners due to export rules]{.underline}**, much
to the frustration of friendly nations, though the Trump administration
[has sought to change
that](https://www.defensenews.com/news/pentagon-congress/2018/04/19/trump-admin-rolls-out-new-rules-for-weapon-drone-sales-abroad/).
The United States has allies and partners who want to buy MQ-1 Predator
and MQ-9 Reaper drones, so they go to the Russians, the Chinese, the
Israelis, the French --- all whom are more than willing to sell their
technology to others, he said. So the United States ends up with an ally
that has systems that are not interoperable with U.S. systems, noting
"that's a problem." **[As a result]{.underline}**, **[China faces little
competition to sell these systems]{.underline}** given most nations that
produce armed drones are restricted from selling the technology as
signatories of the Missile Technology Control Regime and/or the
Wassenaar Arrangement on Export Controls for Conventional Arms and
Dual-Use Goods and Technologies, the DoD report notes. DoD's report
notes, however, that Chinese arms are lower quality and less reliable
than those offered by top international arms suppliers. "**[Most of
China's customers are developing countries that prefer less expensive
Chinese arms]{.underline}**," the report states. "**[These arms
generally come with few end-use restrictions]{.underline}**, which is
attractive to customers who may not have access to other arms sources
for political or economic reasons." For example, China's ability to
remain one of the top five nations in global arms sales hinges on
continued strong sales to Pakistan and demand for their armed drones,
the report says. The report points out key developments for China
recently include sales of armed drones to Iraq, Saudi Arabia, Egypt and
the United Arab Emirates.

**Zhao 18** (Liu Zhen, reporter on China for the South China Morning
Post, 12/18/18, "China fills gap left by US in Middle East military
drone market, British think tank says,"
<https://www.scmp.com/news/china/military/article/2178584/china-fills-gap-left-us-middle-east-military-drone-market>,
accessed 7/2/19)

**[China plays a significant role in the supply of military drones to
Middle East countries, especially those that are barred from importing
them from the United States]{.underline}**, a British think tank has
said. The Royal United Services Institute said in a report that **[China
has filled a void left by the US, which has become more selective about
exporting armed drones and related technologies to the region. "China
has often been described as a no-questions-asked exporter of drones, has
played and is likely to continue playing a key role as a supplier of
armed UAVs to the Middle East,"]{.underline}** the report said. The only
two rules Beijing follows are dealing only with state actors and
prioritising usage for counterterrorism purposes, it said. **[China has
sold advanced armed drones to several Middle Eastern countries,
including Jordan, Iraq, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates, on
the grounds they will be used to combat terrorism]{.underline}**, the
report said. Beijing has stated on more than one occasion that it does
not take sides on conflicts in the region. All countries are therefore
potential clients. China is not a signatory to the Missile Technology
Control Regime, an international treaty signed in 1987 that seeks to
control the sale of weapons such as missiles and armed unmanned aerial
vehicles. For example, it restricts the sale of missiles and related
technologies that are capable of carrying a 500kg (1,100lb) payload for
300km (186 miles) or more. China applied to join the treaty in 2004 but
was rejected. It has since pledged to voluntarily abide by its rules.
But military experts have said that some armed drones fall into a grey
area under the agreement. For example, the CH-4B Rainbow, a UAV
manufactured by China Aerospace Science and Technology Corp, has a range
of just 150km if controlled from the ground but more than 1,000km if
fitted with a satellite guidance function. It is not known if the
company has ever sold Rainbow drones with the enhanced capability to any
of its clients. **[While US drones are generally regarded as
technologically superior to their Chinese counterparts, buyers in the
Middle East often do not have the option to buy the former and the
latter are significantly cheaper]{.underline}**. **[Iraq, for instance,
bought at least four Rainbow drones from China in 2015 after failing to
complete a deal on US-made MQ-1 Predator models.]{.underline}**
According to reports by the Iraqi air force, as of the second half of
this year the drones had been used to carry out more than 260 strikes
against Islamic State. Similarly, **[the UAE bought two different models
of the Wing Loong drone manufactured by China's Chengdu Aircraft
Industry Group after it too failed to finalise a deal on
Predators.]{.underline}** The think tank's report said China has also
offered to help countries, including Saudi Arabia, to manufacture their
own drones. **["Proliferation in armed UAVs in the Middle East is
unlikely to stop and could even accelerate, either through domestic
production or reliance on external suppliers, such as
Beijing,"]{.underline}** the report said.

**[China has seen a dramatic increase in the amount of drones it has
sold to foreign countries in recent years, and that could be a troubling
development for the United States.]{.underline}** **[The global military
drone market has been dominated by the US. American-made models like the
MQ-1 Predator, the MQ-9 Reaper, and the RQ-4 Global Hawk]{.underline}**
have been deployed around the world in a number of countries. In large
part, **[China poses a threat to America\'s dominance in the drone
industry for its ability to make more products that are, at the very
least, just as good if not better than the competition, but at a lower
price.]{.underline}** China is building impressive and inexpensive
drones The most well-known and used Chinese drones are the CH-3, CH-4,
CH-5, and the Wing Loong. The CH-3 and CH-4 propeller-driven drones are
essentially Chinese versions of the Predator and Reaper, respectively,
and have similar capabilities. The CH-5 has a current range of 4400
miles over 60 hours, and a planned upgrade that will bring it up to
12,000 miles over 120 hours. The CH-5 also has a 2,000 pound payload,
and the capability to house electronic warfare systems inside it. The
CH-3 and CH-4 have price tags around \$4 million, whereas the Predator
and Reaper can cost \$4 million and \$20 million respectively. The Wing
Loong, another Chinese counterpart to the Predator, is priced even
lower, at just \$1 million. Even the CH-5, which is currently China\'s
deadliest drone in service, costs \" less than half the price\" of a
Predator. The prices are so low in part because the Chinese drones are
not as sophisticated as their American counterparts. The Chinese drones
are not satellite-linked, for example, meaning they cannot conduct
operations across the globe the way Predators and Reapers can. **[The
Chinese drones are still very capable --- all are sold with the ability
to carry large amounts of ordinance, and many nations have decided to
turn to them in order to fill in the gap left by the US]{.underline}**.
The US has restrictive regulations and policies Lower prices, however,
may not the only reason behind China\'s increased drone sales. **[A
large part of China\'s increased market share looks is linked to
regulations and policies that have been in place in the Unites States
for years.]{.underline}** **[In 1987, the US signed the]{.underline}**
**[M]{.underline}**issile **[T]{.underline}**echnology
**[C]{.underline}**ontrol **[R]{.underline}**egime, a voluntary pact of
35 nations aimed at preventing the mass proliferation of missiles and
unmanned aerial vehicles by requiring them to have heavy regulations and
tight export controls. Currently, under the agreement, drones that can
fly over 185 miles and carry a payload above 1,100 pounds are defined as
cruise missiles. The Predator and the Reaper, both of which can carry
payloads of 3,000 pounds or more, are thus subject to these regulations
and controls. **[The US has been hesitant to sell drones with lethal
capabilities to other countries]{.underline}** --- especially **[in the
Middle East, because of a fear that they could potentially end up in the
wrong hands, and challenge Israel\'s dominance in the
region]{.underline}**. In fact, the only nation apart from the US that
uses armed American-made drones is the United Kingdom.
**[China]{.underline}**, on the other hand, **[is not constrained by
the]{.underline}** **[M]{.underline}**issile
**[T]{.underline}**echnology **[C]{.underline}**ontrol
**[R]{.underline}**egime because it never signed it. **[This means that
its products are not under the intense regulation and controls that
American drones are.]{.underline}** Additionally, **[China has
traditionally not been as cautious as the the US about selling weaponry
and equipment to countries known for human rights violations or in
volatile regions and has sold drones to many nations]{.underline}**. In
Central Asia, Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan have purchased a number of Wing
Loongs, and Turkmenistan operates the CH-3. In Africa, Nigeria has used
CH-3 drones against Boko Haram. Pakistan and Myanmar both operate
CH-3\'s as well. **[By far though, the biggest market is the Middle
East]{.underline}**. In 2015, desperate in its fight to counter ISIS
gains, **[Iraq bought a number of CH-4s. After giving up on buying
drones from the US, Saudi Arabia and the UAE turned to China and are
using CH-4s and Wing Loongs in their campaign against Houthi rebels in
Yemen]{.underline}**. Jordan and Egypt have purchased Chinese drones as
well. **[China is even willing to set up factories overseas, which could
bypass export restrictions entirely.]{.underline}** China\'s future
drone projects are even more impressive Last year, at the Zhuhai 2016
Airshow, the public was able to get a glance at some of the newest
drones China plans to build and export. Among those was the Cloud
Shadow, a semi-stealth drone with six hardpoints capable of carrying up
to 800 pounds of ordinance. There was also the CH-805, and concept CK-20
stealth target drones, which are designed to help train pilots and test
air defenses. Finally, there was the SW-6, a small \"marsupial\" drone
with folding wings capable of being dropped from larger aircraft. Its
intended mission is to conduct reconnaissance, but it is considered a
prime candidate for China\'s drone \"swarm\" project; dozens,
potentially hundreds of small drones linked together in a hive mind and
capable of swarming and overwhelming targets. China has also just
successfully shattered the record for the highest flying drone.
Previously held by the US RQ-4 Global Hawk, the bat-sized drone was able
to fly at a staggering 82,000 feet- 22,000 feet higher than the Global
Hawk. Though the drone did not have a camera or any weapons, it did
carry a terrain mapping device and a detector that would allow it to
locate and mark ground troops, and was virtually undetectable. In
addition to all this, China is also looking to increase its satellite
capabilities, something that could make China\'s drones just as advanced
as their US counterparts. In an attempt to combat the loss in sales, the
Trump administration, which has not been subtle in its hopes to get
foreign countries to buy more American-made defense products, is trying
to ease restrictions on the sale of American-made drones. This includes
things like renegotiating the Missile Technology Control Regime, and
allowing a number of countries that are not deemed risky to be able to
get fast tracked orders. Though probably interpreted as a way to help
the defense industry make more profits, there is actually some logic
behind the push. **[The more China sells drones to countries that are US
partners, the more they will become reliant and closer on China. \"It
damages the US relationship with a close partner,]{.underline}**\" Paul
Scharre, a Senior Fellow and Director at the nonpartisan Center for a
New American Security told the Wall Street Journal. \"**[It increases
that partner\'s relationship with a competitor nation, China. It hurts
US companies trying to compete]{.underline}**.\" For now, Israel
dominates the military drone market, with 60% of international drone
transfers in the past three decades coming from the small nation.
However, **[China sells far more armed drones, and is gaining momentum
on overall drone sales as well. If current trends continue, China could
profit immensely in a market that could be worth \$22 billion by
2022.]{.underline}**

**[China's overt offshore military presence has grown in recent
years.]{.underline}** These activities vary, ranging from operating the
first Chinese overseas military facility in Djibouti to conducting
patrols in the Indian Ocean. However, **[China has long used its
extensive arms industry as a way to gain footholds -- even if just
through minor links. Their sales of drones are a clear example of
this.]{.underline}** Most armed drones today are built by the United
States, China, and Israel. The United States mostly sells to NATO
allies, increasing the interoperability and common supply chains within
the alliance. U.S. sales to India are an attempt at supplanting Russia's
influence -- part of the larger U.S. focus on Asia, including countering
China. Israeli provision of drones to India are part of a larger defense
cooperation between the two, while their exports to Azerbaijan provides
a presence just north of the largest regional rival, Iran. **[Chinese
armed drones have been operated or ordered by 17 countries. While
visually similar to the U.S. and Israeli drones,]{.underline}**
**[China's are cheaper and less advanced -- all the while quite
operational.]{.underline}** What is curious is to whom the Chinese are
selling to, and their relation to wider policies and strategic choices.
The buyers are widely dispersed; **[China has an interest in building
links with these countries because of geographic position, economic
conditions, or political situation. Most already have Chinese
investments, loans, and other weaponry.]{.underline}** Many of the
countries importing Chinese drones lie along the path of China's Belt
and Road Initiative (BRI). Pakistan and Myanmar have long-standing ties
with China, and both are now flying Chinese armed drones, with Pakistan
even producing a licensed version of the Wing Loong II model. Further
inland, Kazakhstan, Turkmenistan, and Uzbekistan have all received armed
drones from China. All five of these countries are critical for the BRI
to function and have seen increasing Chinese investments and connections
over recent years -- including significant military investments in
addition to the drones. Chinese interests extend also into Africa.
Egypt, Algeria, and the Ethiopian involvement in Somalia all have roles
to play in the continued viability of maritime trade from China to
Europe. Zambia has large Chinese investments in their mining regions,
while Nigeria has oil and importantly lies on the Gulf of Guinea. These
African and the above mentioned Asian states are positioned along vital
trade routes, giving China a distinct interest in building relationships
and providing tools to help secure trade. **[The combination of both
trade and investments provides ample excuse to provide drones in
addition to other weaponry -- all with increased ties to the Chinese
military and defense industry.]{.underline}** In the Middle East, China
is more opportunistic in selling their armed drones, supplying them to
countries that cannot get drones from Israel or the United States for
economic or political reasons. While the Israeli constraint is obvious,
Iraq and Jordan are both hindered by the high cost of U.S. drones --
instead opting for Chinese versions for their fight against the Islamic
State. Politically, the Saudi- and Emirati-led campaign in Yemen is more
problematic, where they are accused of war crimes utilizing Chinese
drones. The lessening influence of the United States in the Persian Gulf
also provides inroads for China to replace Washington, with their drones
being a useful tool in this endeavor. **[No matter the location, all of
the operators get pulled toward China.]{.underline}** **[The sale of
drones causes an increasing dependence on Chinese
materiel]{.underline}** -- such as spare parts and missiles -- to
operate in the first place. **[The drones also create a necessity to
maintain defense ties with China for training and
operations.]{.underline}** These are, after all, quite advanced and
complicated machines. In their armed drones, **[China has found a way to
increase their influence and expand their presence with any country that
that the United States and Israel will not -- or cannot -- sell
to.]{.underline}** Fully aware that the drones are pulling them toward
China, why would other states choose to receive them? Simply put, most
of the countries discussed above either need or want the capability that
operating drones can bring. This stretches from the more basic, like
conducting long-range surveillance patrols, to the more infamous, in the
form of armed strike missions. Many of these countries are also engaged
in murky conflicts and accused of abuses. **[China's willingness to
supply armed drones and countries' demand for them provides a win-win
situation: China gets a foothold, while the receiving end gets their
weaponry.]{.underline}** **[Especially when the United States and Israel
are unable to supply their drones, why would a country in a conflict
willingly abstain from improving their capability?]{.underline}** Most
modern manned aircraft have significant costs involved in procurement,
maintenance, and use. Training a pilot can cost millions of dollars ---
an investment that does not necessarily disappear with unmanned
aircraft. It does, however, lower the risk of losing the aviator. For
countries with poor maintenance standards and a history of unfortunate
mishaps, this is a salient point. Combined with the advanced age of
their existing air forces, the cost of operating traditional planes in
the first place can be insurmountable. Chinese drones offer a similar,
albeit lower, capability to manned aircraft and at a cheaper price.
**[China's proliferation of armed drones benefits their strategic
vision, protecting their investments and interests, and provides a
foothold.]{.underline}** **[Meanwhile countries are willing to accept
increased links with China in exchange for a new capability and tool for
combating threats.]{.underline}** This willingness is only magnified by
economic and political isolation from other options. **[The capability
gap exists and will not disappear -- and China will be there to fill it
with their armed drones.]{.underline}**

**[U.S. forces are at increasing risk as China and other nations sell
more armed drones to anyone with the money to pay for them, and
restrictive U.S. export policies may be making the situation
worse]{.underline}**, says a new report delivered to the Chairman of the
Joint Chiefs. The RAND Corp. report says that **[drones produced by
unfriendly nations will pose a "growing threat to U.S. and allied
military operations," in the near future, as China, Russia, and Iran
recognize the power of unmanned platforms, making it certain that in
future conflicts, "U.S. forces will have to cope with adversaries
equipped with different types and sizes of UAVs, both armed and
unarmed]{.underline}**." In some ways, the future is now. In 2017,
Iranian-made drones dropped small munitions near U.S. forces in Syria,
forcing American aircraft to knock them out of the sky. Iranian drones
have also buzzed American warships in the Persian Gulf, and Iranian-made
unmanned suicide boats have targeted Saudi warships off the coast of
Yemen. American export restrictions on the sale of large long-range
drones have allowed China and Iran to step in and fill the gap left open
by US policies. **[Beijing has really stepped up its efforts to capture
the market in ISR and strike drones, making plans to build a drone
production facility in Saudi Arabia, and actively courting countries
spurned by the American restrictions.]{.underline}** Exports of
American-made drones have primarily been restricted to the handful of
allies who have signed the Missile Technology Control Regime, a
consortium of 35 nations that sets limits based on range and payload. At
issue are Category I drones, which can carry a payload of 500 kilograms
for more than 300 kilometers. Under the MTCR, these systems are subject
to a "strong presumption of denial" for transfer. But changes being
proposed by Washington seek to open new categories of drones available
for sale in part by focusing on speed instead of range--- allowing
drones that can fly less than 650 kilometers per hour to be capable of
being shipped to international partners. **[U.S. partners such as
Jordan, the UAE, Egypt, and Saudi Arabia --- all denied requests to
purchase drones from the United States --- have turned to China, which
is not an MTCR member]{.underline}**. **[Chinese CH-4 medium range
drones are already stationed at the Saudi's Jirzan Regional
airport]{.underline}**, not far from where UAE-operated Predator drones
operate from the same air base. Egypt has also purchased the system,
along with the Medium-Altitude Long Endurance (MALE) Wing Loong drone.
The UAE has also taken to selling drones to Russia and offering them to
other countries. Overall, China has sold advanced drones to at least
nine nations. China has signed an agreement to establish a UAV
manufacturing plant in Saudi Arabia to produce up to 300 new drones ---
some of them Category I. China and the UAE are not only marketing their
own drones, but also offering to build factories for co-production. Even
MTCR member states appear to be edging away from the protocol, with
Germany codeveloping a unmanned system with Qatar, and Italy making
plans to export a long-range system to the UAE. The Trump administration
has been loosening controls on U.S. exports of advanced drones, allowing
General Atomics sell some advanced drones to India, and lifting some
other restrictions on arms transfers overall this spring. The White
House has for months been circulating what it calls its Arms Transfer
Initiative, which would further slash red tape in military sales to
allies, speeding up the process and making more weapons more readily
available for export. The Rand report concluded that while the MTCR has
been effective in limiting the proliferation of large drones, "the
availability of these vehicles from non-MTCR nations has significantly
eroded the MTCR's efficacy to limit the proliferation of large UAVs,"
while also hurting U.S. drone makers who are restricted in who they can
sell to. Ellen Lord, head of Pentagon acquisition, told reporters at a
special operations conference in Florida last month that she wants to
"promote allied readiness by enhancing military capacity through
targeting improvements in foreign military sales." The glacial pace of
the U.S. government in approving sales means that some allies look
elsewhere, telling American officials that "we're going to go with the
Russian alternative, we're going to go with the Chinese alternative
because we know we can get it quickly," Lord said. "We know that it
might fail 80 to 90 percent of the time, but we will have something.
That's a missed opportunity for the U.S. and we're going to make sure we
do everything possible to improve upon that."

China's overall strategy to increase its role in world affairs indicates
further engagement in its global investments in Asia, Africa, and
beyond. It holds the most foreign reserve assets in Asia and is the
largest trading partner in Africa. However, **[China is also continuing
to diversify its portfolio by adding investments in the Middle East and

smaller, Chinese foreign direct investment (FDI) in the MENA region is
growing rapidly]{.underline}**. Since 2010, China invested billions of
dollars in nearly every MENA country and in 2016 eclipsed the United
Arab Emirates to become the leading investor in the region. China's
surge in investment is underpinned by the China-Arab States Cooperation

oil pipelines, and motorways---to promote and facilitate global trade.
It includes several proposals to stimulate cooperation between China and
MENA countries. Within the BRI, the China-Central-West Asia Economic
Corridor (CCAWAEC) and the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC) offer
the most direct routes for China-MENA trade. In many ways, **[China's
interest in the MENA region is purely economic in nature: the region
plays an important role in the BRI, and China relies on energy resources
from the Middle East. As the world's most populous country with the
second largest economy, China has enormous energy
demands]{.underline}**; China\'s National Bureau of Statistics reported
that China's energy consumption totaled 4.48 billion metric tons in
2017, more than every European Union country combined. China is the
world's top crude oil importer, and much of its crude oil comes from the
Middle East. **[In 2018, Saudi Arabia was the second largest supplier of
crude oil to China, and Iraq was the third largest supplier. China's
interest in the MENA region is also driven by the belief that economic
development can contribute to mitigating certain security
problems]{.underline}**. The region's economic performance is severely
impacted by terrorist attacks carried out by al-Qaeda and the Islamic
State (ISIS) in countries like Libya, Iraq, and Syria, as well as long
and violent wars like the ongoing Syrian and Yemeni conflicts. The
region is also plagued by the misuse of government wealth by corrupt and
ineffective leaders. For example, Iraq has experienced widespread unrest
over poor public services and job prospects, exacerbated by graft. China
sees similar security problems within its own borders. Terrorist groups
like the East Turkestan Islamic Movement (ETIM) continue to grow in
size, and there is a persistent widening of socioeconomic rifts along
ethnic lines. In response, China not only increased security personnel
in the province, but also enacted economic practices meant to bolster
lower-income regions and stimulate economic growth. These efforts are
meant to mitigate violent uprisings from aggrieved populations. China's
foreign investment strategies reflect its domestic policies. **[When
Western powers lifted sanctions on Iran in 2016 after the implementation
of the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), President Xi
strengthened diplomatic ties with Iran's leaders and promised to
increase bilateral trade to \$600 billion over the next ten
years]{.underline}**. It is unclear how the US withdrawal from the JCPOA
in May and reinstatement of sanctions on Iran on August 6 will affect
this investment. Additionally, despite the ongoing Syrian civil war,
China is maintaining its investments in Syria, but at a fraction of its
investment across the region. China became a 35 percent stakeholder in
Syria Shell Petroleum Development (SSPD) in 2010; which is a subsidiary
run in Syria and operated by Shell. SSPD held a 31 percent stake in
al-Furat Petroleum Company, and operated three production licenses in
one of Syria's biggest oil conglomerates; until it was sanctioned by the
European Union in December 2011. It is set to potentially invest in
Syria's reconstruction, renewable energy, and healthcare. According to
Qin Yong, the Vice President of the China-Arab Exchange Association,
Chinese companies are eyeing projects to rebuild Syrian infrastructure
and industry across the country. More recently, China opened a new
chapter in Sino-Arab relations by pledging \$23 billion in loans and
financial aid to MENA countries. Loans totaling \$20 billion aim to
facilitate economic and industrial reconstruction in the Middle East, as
well as cooperation on oil, gas, and nuclear energy. China will set up a
consortium of Chinese and Arab banks, with a dedicated fund of \$3
billion. Finally, China is expected to give an additional \$15 million
to Palestinians for economic development and \$90 million in aid to
Syria, Yemen, Jordan, and Lebanon. China has not provided details on
when or how the money will be dispersed, and the overall relationship
between the consortium, loan package, and financial aid is also unclear.
**[By 2020, China aims to reach a \$600 billion trade aggregate with the
Middle East. Undoubtedly, this will be a boon to some countries. Other
countries, however, have expressed concern about China's expansionist
ambitions. The United States potentially has the most to lose. Projects
like the BRI suggest that Beijing has the desire to augment its growing
economic and strategic influence with a \"soft power\" narrative that
presents China as an alternative leader to the global hegemony of the
United States. Essentially, China is continuing to use financial
mechanisms to become an international player deeply embedded in the MENA
region's geopolitical landscape. As China moves forward with its own
agenda, its MENA investments should be closely monitored.]{.underline}**

#### Despite "soft power" approach -- there is no peaceful China rise 

**Mulgan 2016**- prof of Japanese politics, U of New South Wales\
Aurelia George, \"China's Rise as a Predator State,\"
thediplomat.com/2016/03/chinas-rise-as-a-predator-state/

**[China's land grab and]{.underline}** subsequent **[militarization of
"islands]{.underline}**" in the South China Sea **[have]{.underline}**
finally **[dispelled the myth that its rise will be
peaceful.]{.underline}** Indeed, these developments point to an
unwelcome fact -- that **[China has become a predator
state.]{.underline}** Rand's Michael Mazarr wrote about predator states
in the late 1990s. He argues that what distinguishes a predator state
above all is "territorial aggression" -- the predisposition to grab
territory and resources. China is one of two contemporary examples; the
other is Russia in Europe. The best historical examples are Napoleonic
France, Nazi Germany and Imperial Japan, and more recently Iraq under
Saddam Hussein. These examples teach us that predator states cause wars.
Predator states are buoyed by an expansionist ideology -- the active
promotion of the idea that neighbouring territories (both land and
maritime) belong by rights to the predator. Such states often possess a
sense of historical grievance or victimization that can only be
"righted" by territorial grabs. Indeed, a Mazarr contends, the "politics
of memory operates powerfully...causing \[predator states\] to react by
forming aggressive, predatory instincts." Besides territorial
aggression, predator states exhibit several other distinguishing
features. First, **[national policy demonstrates very high levels of
militarization. Predator states divert large quantities of national
resources into military expansion for purposes of power
projection]{.underline}**. The emphasis in military planning and weapons
acquisitions is inherently offensive rather than defensive and is geared
to intimidating potential adversaries and winning offensive wars. The
flipside domestically is, as Mazarr writes, that "military,
nationalistic, and territorial issues continue to play a large role in
domestic politics and in the states' approach to the world." In China's
case, nationalism has overtaken Marxism and more recently
developmentalism as state ideology. Second, **[predator states adopt a
strongly strategic perspective on national advancement and display an
associated willingness to use all the institutions and instruments of
the state over which they maintain control]{.underline}** -- economic,
cultural, military, technological, resource, trade, legal, media -- in
the pursuit of this overwhelming important strategic objective. China,
for example, deployed a broad range of retaliatory instruments against
Japan over the Senkaku Islands affair in 2010, including restricting the
export of rare earth metals. The use of such "strategic" instruments
extends beyond such punitive acts of state retaliation to a whole range
of long-term, so-called "market-based" investments. These include
foreign acquisitions in strategically important and sensitive areas such
as land, resource and water assets and critical infrastructure as well
as in private-sector developments and industries. The "strategic"
element cannot be discounted in these acquisitions because the line
between private enterprise and state-owned enterprises in the Chinese
case is imprecise given the complex interweaving of business and state
actors. In the end, everything becomes "strategic" in the sense of
supporting national advancement and security. Third, predator states are
not democracies where there exist checks and balances and other
moderating influences that negate the potential for predation against
other states. Predator states have authoritarian governments with low
levels of accountability. Political leaders are only answerable to other
power cliques and display a willingness to engage in political
repression, including imprisonment and even murder of their opponents.
In such states, there is no real separation of the executive from the
judiciary and, in that sense, no rule of law. Levels of domestic
lawlessness are matched by international lawlessness. Predator states do
not respond to appeals to international laws or norms because they are
inherently lawless themselves -- they understand and respect only power
in international affairs. **[China's actions in the South China Sea
clearly demonstrate that it does not support a rules-based regional or
global order; nor does it believe that you can fight power with rules as
other states are attempting to do in dealing with this
issue.]{.underline}** Finally, **[predator states show a predisposition
to act unilaterally rather than multilaterally. Multilateral cooperation
is entertained only where it fits with the long-term strategic interests
of the state.]{.underline}** Moreover, there is little willingness to
trade off state interests for larger collective interests in the
international community. In that sense, predator states are not
interested in providing international public goods and should not be
considered as potentially benign hegemons.

###  2NC Impact -- US-China War

#### China's aspirations will spark a war with the US

**Pickrell 2015** - Master's in IR, currently pursuing a PhD in IR and
Diplomacy at Central China Normal University\
Ryan, \"The Tipping Point: Has the U.S.-China Relationship Passed the
Point of No Return?,\" Oct 26,
nationalinterest.org/feature/the-tipping-point-has-the-us-china-relationship-passed-the-14168?page=3

Conflict between a rising power and an established power is not
inevitable as most realist scholars suggest. However, in every
relationship, **[there is a tipping point]{.underline}** or a point of
no return, **[and China and the U]{.underline}**nited
**[S]{.underline}**tates **[are rapidly approaching this]{.underline}**
point. As traditional diplomatic outlets have done little to resolve the
more challenging issues presently affecting the Sino-American
relationship, these two great powers have been increasingly relying on
their military capabilities and hard power tactics. That's especially
true **[in the S]{.underline}**outh **[C]{.underline}**hina
**[S]{.underline}**ea, which **[is]{.underline}** one of **[the single
greatest points of contention]{.underline}** between China and the
United States. While there is a realization on both sides of the Pacific
that a kind of strategic stability is necessary to prevent great power
conflict, **[both China and the U]{.underline}**nited
**[S]{.underline}**tates **[remain unwilling to
compromise]{.underline}** **[and make the kind of meaningful concessions
required to move the relationship further from
confrontation]{.underline}** and conflict and closer to cooperation and
rapprochement. Instead, these two countries are drawing lines in the
sand and preparing for the worst. Failed pursuit of strategic stability
China's proposed solution to the Sino-American strategic stability issue
is the "new model of major-country relations," which encourages the
United States and China to avoid confrontation and conflict, respect one
another's political systems and national interests---specifically
China's core interests---and pursue win-win cooperation. China is
exceptionally enthusiastic about this proposal and brings it up at every
high-level Sino-American meeting. Chinese enthusiasm for the "new model
of major-country relations" can be explained in a number of different
ways. **[American acceptance of China's proposal would facilitate
Beijing's rise, legitimize the]{.underline}** Chinese Communist Party
(**[CCP) as a leader for national strength and revival and reduce the
likelihood of American containment]{.underline}**. As acceptance of the
"new model of major-country relations" would create an international
environment conducive to China's rise, it would essentially allow China
to become the preeminent power in Asia without great power competition
or conflict. This proposal also has the potential to put China on par
with the United States, to elevate it to an equal status, one
acknowledged by the United States. **[Not only would American
recognition of China's strength and power have effects abroad, but it
would also stoke Chinese nationalism and strengthen CCP leadership at
home]{.underline}**. Furthermore, this new model is a means of
establishing a new code of conduct for the Sino-American relationship
that is more in line with Chinese national interests, opening the door
for the creation of a Chinese sphere of influence in Asia and,
potentially, a Sino-centric regional order. Prior to the recent meeting
between Xi Jinping and Barack Obama, Xi announced that China's proposed
"new model of major-country-relations" would be an important discussion
point for the meeting, but, while this proposal was brought up during
the meeting, no clear progress was made. Because U.S. leaders believe
that the "new model of major-country relations" is not in America's best
interests, the United States has repeatedly dismissed China's proposal.
As the hegemonic power, the United States maintains its power by
dominating global politics; to accept a geopolitical framework
alternative proposed by a strategic rival requires sacrificing a certain
amount of power and influence. Along those same lines, **[acceptance of
China's proposal might give other states in the international system the
impression that the U]{.underline}**nited **[S]{.underline}**tates **[is
in decline and on the losing end of the classic "Thucydides
trap."]{.underline}** Outside of traditional power politics, the call
for the United States to respect China's "core interests"--- as many
Chinese and foreign scholars have noted---is a loaded statement. While
the United States is not opposed to respecting a state's national
interests, it tends to be unwilling to respect national interests which
are highly contested, which is the situation for the majority of China's
"core interests**[." In addition to]{.underline}** **[traditional
Chinese national interests, such as Taiwan]{.underline}**, Tibet, and
Xinjiang, **[China's "core interests" also cover most of its territorial
claims in Asia.]{.underline}** The United States is concerned that
**[China's "new model of major-country relations" is a ploy designed to
trick the U]{.underline}**nited **[S]{.underline}**tates **[into
acknowledging China's extensive territorial claims and undercutting the
interests of]{.underline}** American a**[llies]{.underline}** and
long-time strategic partners in the Asia-Pacific region, which would
likely result in the **[weakening of the American-led "hub-and-spoke"
security structure]{.underline}**, a security framework China hopes to
replace with its New Asian Security Concept. There are also suspicions
in the United States that China's proposal is a call for the creation of
spheres of influence, a concept to which the Obama administration has
been consistently opposed. America's approach to Sino-American strategic
stability is to have China and the United States focus on cooperation
and agree to avoid letting competition in one area affect cooperation
and collaboration in others. In many ways, this resembles China's old
"shelving disputes and pursuing joint development" strategy for Asia. As
this kind of strategy is the geopolitical equivalent of sweeping dirt
under the rug, it is only effective to a point. Eventually, the dirt
spills out. Sooner or later, unaddressed problems surface. At best, this
approach is only a temporary stop on the road to functional strategic
stability. At worst, this approach has already outlived its usefulness.
China views this strategy as an attempt by the United States to avoid
addressing China's demands that the United States acknowledge China's
rise to great power status and redefine the relationship accordingly,
which only encourages the already strong Chinese desire to push forward
the "new model of major-country relations." China and the United States
are at an impasse regarding strategic stability. **[While both states
have made commitments and promises to prevent great power conflict,
neither China nor the U]{.underline}**nited **[S]{.underline}**tates
**[has developed a reasonable or implementable solution for
Sino-American strategic stability.]{.underline}** Thus, competition
continues unmanaged, unchecked and confrontation is steadily evolving
into conflict. Drawing Lines in the "Sea" The problems pushing the
Sino-American relationship towards conflict are numerous and diverse,
but if you are looking for the issue most likely to cause conflict, you
need look no further than the South China Sea. China perceives the
territorial disputes in this area as issues in which aggressive foreign
state actors led by the United States are threatening China's
territorial sovereignty. For China, because of its history, territorial
sovereignty issues implicate regime survival in a way that transcends
all other quarrels and disagreements. **[The U]{.underline}**nited
**[S]{.underline}**tates, on the other hand, **[views China's
territorial claims and actions to bolster those claims as Chinese
expansionism, aggression against American allies and strategic
partners]{.underline}**, and a threat to the guiding principles of the
liberal world order---which the United States views as crucial for the
preservation of America's global hegemonic power. The situation in the
South China Sea has been steadily escalating for several years now. In
April, 2014, American defense secretary Chuck Hagel met with Chinese
defense minister Chang Wanquan. During the meeting, Hagel said, "All
parties should refrain from provocative actions and the use of
intimidation, coercion, or aggression to advance their claims. Such
disputes must be resolved peacefully and in accordance with
international law." Chang replied, "I'd like to reiterate that the
territorial sovereignty issue is a Chinese core interest. On this issue,
we will make no compromises, no concessions. Not even a tiny bit of
violation will be allowed." The inability to discuss openly or
compromise on this issue has made it impossible to resolve and has led
to escalation and increased tension. In the aftermath of this meeting,
China began investing heavily in island construction and land
reclamation activities in disputed waters. As these activities have
stirred up a lot of dust in the region, the United States has demanded
that China abandon its present course of action, insisting that it is
provocative and negatively impacting regional peace and stability.
**[Not only has China dismissed America's demands, it has also increased
its military presence in contested areas in order to establish
anti-access zones]{.underline}**. While China claims that its actions
are within the scope of international law, the United States asserts
that Chinese actions are in violation of the law of the sea and laws for
the regulation of the international commons. China argues that the South
China Sea issue is a territorial sovereignty issue, yet the United
States regards this issue as a freedom of navigation dispute, as well as
a fight for the preservation of the international legal system---a
cornerstone for the American-led liberal world order. In August of this
year, the United States launched its new Asia-Pacific Maritime Security
Strategy, which aims "to safeguard the freedom of the seas, deter
conflict and escalation, and promote adherence to international law and
standards." The Asia-Pacific region is now at the heart of the American
naval security agenda. In response, Chinese foreign ministry
spokesperson Hong Lei said that China "opposes any country's attempt to
challenge China's territorial sovereignty and security under the pretext
of safeguarding navigation freedom." Responding to Chinese criticisms of
America's new regional maritime security strategy, American Defense
Secretary Ashton Carter stated, "Make no mistake, we will fly, sail, and
operate wherever international law permits...We will do that at times
and places of our choosing." In 2014, the United States carried out
"freedom of navigation" exercises in various parts of the world and
challenged the territorial claims of 18 different countries; however,
the United States has yet to officially challenge China's claims in the
South China Sea. But, that may soon change, as the United States is
currently considering sending American naval vessels within 12 nautical
miles of China's artificial islands in order to force China to end its
land reclamation activities. Such plans are considered aggressive,
dangerous and extremely provocative by the Chinese. A recent Global
Times editorial read, "China mustn't tolerate rampant US violations of
China's adjacent waters and the skies over these expanding islands. The
Chinese military should be ready to launch countermeasures according to
Washington's level of provocation." The article further stated, "If the
US encroaches on China's core interests, the Chinese military will stand
up and use force to stop it." The article stated plainly, "If the US
adopts an aggressive approach, it will breach China's bottom line, and
China will not sit idly by." Other reports from this newspaper, a
state-sponsored Chinese media outlet, have made it clear that **[if the
bottom line for the United States is that China must end all of its land
reclamation activities in the South China Sea, then war is inevitable,
which suggests that this issue may be the tipping point for the
Sino-American relationship]{.underline}**. How the United States and
China choose to move forward on this issue will permanently redefine the
relationship between these two great powers. Granted, this may just be
saber rattling, but even if that is the case, **[this issue is still
decidedly zero-sum]{.underline}**---**[which increases the likelihood of
conflict.]{.underline}** **[For China, political preservation and a
potential Chinese sphere of influence are on the line, and for the
U]{.underline}**nited **[S]{.underline}**tates, **[the liberal world
order and American hegemony are at stake.]{.underline}** Sooner or
later, this trying issue will need to be resolved, and regardless of
whether it is resolved through diplomacy or military force, it will take
a toll on the geopolitical influence of either one or both countries.
Were the international institutions for collective security strong
enough to handle situations like this when they arise---and if China and
the United States were willing to establish a new relationship model
which addresses each country's respective security concerns and
encourages effective collaboration---it might actually be possible to
resolve this issue peacefully. But given current circumstances, this is
little more than idealism and wishful thinking. As **[there is currently
no clear solution to this problem that would allow both countries to
walk out of this situation with their heads held high, these two states
are pondering the unthinkable]{.underline}**. Depending on each
country's level of commitment and resolve, this situation may have
already passed the tipping point. **[The outcome of the geopolitical
power struggle between China and the United States will almost certainly
be decided in the South China Sea]{.underline}**. Some have suggested
that the South China Sea issue is not a Sino-American issue. On the
contrary, it is the most pressing Sino-American issue. **[One side will
either choose to back down or be forced to back down. No matter how
everything plays out in the South China Sea, geopolitics in the
Asia-Pacific region will never be the same again.]{.underline}**

Whether a Sinocentric structure in Asia is a subconscious Chinese goal
or not, there are enough lingering fears elsewhere in the region about
this prospect to create active resistance to the concept. Simply put,
**[we should expect Japan, India, Vietnam, the Philippines,
and]{.underline}** many ot**[hers to resist the establishment of a new
Middle Kingdom]{.underline}**. **[Should the United States scale back
its security role in the region, that resistance would also
occur]{.underline}**, only in more unstable and dangerous forms. It is
important to discuss why **[China\'s neighbors]{.underline}**
tolerate-indeed, even **[welcome-U.S. security hegemony in the
region]{.underline}** and why, by contrast, **[these same countries
would strongly resist Chinese hegemony.]{.underline}** There is a
structural reason why this is so, and it relates to geography and is
therefore enduring: **[China is a large neighbor in the region and the
U]{.underline}**nited **[S]{.underline}**tates **[is not.]{.underline}**
**[Because the U]{.underline}**nited **[S]{.underline}**tates **[has to
project its presence across a vast ocean, it requires the permission of
most countries in the region to continue its role as the security
hegemon.]{.underline}** The United States requires bases, access rights,
and negotiated agreements with local governments to fulfill its security
guarantees. **[If these governments withdrew their permission
due,]{.underline}** say, to **[bad American behavior, the
U]{.underline}**nited **[S]{.underline}**tates **[would find it
difficult and costly to sustain its presence]{.underline}** across the
ocean in the face of broad resistance. **[China,]{.underline}** by
contrast, **[is a permanent presence in the region that the neighbors
can never dislodge]{.underline}**. **[Should China engage in the same
bad behavior, these countries cannot make China go away. They can only
fight or accept China\'s treatment.]{.underline}** It is therefore
easier for the countries in the region to enter into a security contract
with an outside power, knowing they have some bargaining leverage and an
escape clause. **[When dealing with a powerful neighbor like China that
isn\'t going anywhere, the only way to achieve the same bargaining
leverage is to match that neighbor\'s power]{.underline}**, especially
its military power. And **[that implies arms races and spiraling
security dilemmas]{.underline}**.10 Thus, **[hegemons are not all
created equal]{.underline}**. **[It is easier to strike a bargain with
an outside hegemon than with a local one]{.underline}**-an immutable
reason why the U.S. security presence will be welcome in the region.
Even more crucially, **[U]{.underline}**.**[S. service as the region\'s
security hegemon is much more likely to result in stability than if the
region were left alone to find its own stable structure]{.underline}**
(more on this below}. Adding to America\'s attractiveness as an outsider
are **[the U]{.underline}**nited **[S]{.underline}**tates\' seven-decade
**[record of keeping the region\'s commons open for all and its not
having territorial disputes with countries in the region.]{.underline}**
**[The logic behind why most countries in the region welcome the
U]{.underline}**nited **[S]{.underline}**tates **[as the security
hegemon, and why most would resist China attempting to play the same
role, is a strong argument for maintaining this
arrangement.]{.underline}** Which brings us to Global Trends\' second
pathway, the Hobbesian scramble for security, as the most likely outcome
should the United States opt to reduce its costs by withdrawing from the
region. As this chapter will later explore, **[this outcome would very
likely trigger multisided missile and nuclear arms races across the
region, with unpredictable and unstable consequences]{.underline}**. The
risk of military disaster inside the most important economic region in
the world would rise abruptly. **[The U.S. economy and standard of
living would not escape the risks and costs of these developments. It is
easy to see how the absence of the United States as an outside security
provider could result in a dangerously unstable security competition in
East Asia.]{.underline}** **[The rapid rise of China\'s military power
would create the logic for an offsetting alliance by most of its
neighbors]{.underline}**. Some however (perhaps, e.g., a future unified
Korea) may choose to bandwagon with China instead, especially if
historical grievances make allying with some of China\'s adversaries
politically unacceptable. **[Bandwagoning by some would increase the
security anxiety of the remainder that don\'t.]{.underline}** Finally,
some significant powers (e.g., Russia) might choose to remain unaligned,
which would compound the region\'s uncertainty because the players would
have to ponder how these neutrals would eventually act during a regional
crisis**[. Should one or more countries conclude that stability was
unachievable and conflict inevitable, the calculation would then turn to
the logic of security trends and time pressure and the possible
advantage gained by striking first rather than waiting for adversaries
to grow even stronger in the future.]{.underline}**

###  2NC Impact -- Terrorism

#### Chinese drones will get in the hands of terrorists, makes them uniquely worse than the US

Jakob, \"China is Flooding the Middle East With Cheap Drones,\" Feb 18,
https://fpif.org/china-is-flooding-the-middle-east-with-cheap-drones/

Pandora's box is open **[Of particular concern is China's drone policy
in Saudi Arabia]{.underline}**. **[A \$ 65 billion economic program
clinched between the two countries in spring 2017 includes the
construction of a Chinese drone factory in Saudi Arabi]{.underline}**a
--- the first of its kind in the region. Initially, the license
production of 300 drones was agreed, which represents a massive figure
given the 88 drones that China has exported in the last decade
altogether. However, the license drones are not exclusively intended for
the Saudi Royal Air Force --- **[Riyadh can explicitly market them to
other countries in the region.]{.underline}** End-user certificates do
not exist for deals with Beijing. In view of the fact that Saudi Arabia,
along with supporting various jihadist groups in the region, is a close
ally of Al Qaeda in Yemen, it is within the realm of possibility to
envision some of these drones end up in terrorist's hands. **[Fueled by
Beijing's export policy,]{.underline}** **[the threat scenario of
drone-armed jihadists has moved significantly closer.]{.underline}**
Research by the Jamestown Foundation shows that we have already entered
the era of "unmanned terrorism." **[Groups commonly labelled as
"terrorists]{.underline}**" from Syria, Iraq, and Afghanistan to Gaza,
Lebanon, and Yemen **[are already using mini-drones to drop bombs,
grenades, and incendiary devices onto enemy positions or civilian
facilities]{.underline}**. Further flooding the region with cheap combat
drones from China will certainly heave these tactics to the next level
in the future. Since 2001, thousands of people, most of them civilians,
have been killed by drone in the so-called "War on Terror," changing the
nature of war in its entirety and exposing civilians in all these
undeclared war zones to a permanent threat on their lives. Nobel Peace
Prize laureate Barack Obama proved he could always escape punishment and
international condemnation even after using drones to turn weddings and
funerals into blood baths and mass graves. And so, the desires of local
actors to acquire these practical killing tools were aroused, too.
**[The Chinese leadership is exploiting these developments without
compromise and flooding the Middle East with cheap drones. The
consequences of this expansionary policy cannot be foreseen. Pandora's
box is already open.]{.underline}**

President]{.mark} Hassan [Rouhani to leave]{.mark} the JCPOA [and resume
its]{.mark} suspended [nuclear activities]{.mark}.]{.underline}** In
fact, rumors have spread that **[Iran\'s exit from the
JCPOA]{.underline}** and Foreign Minister Javad Zarifs resignation
**[are imminent]{.underline}**. The government has since denied these
rumors. Because **[Iran has not received any real benefit from the
agreement, the hard-liners\' arguments may be making headway with the
Iranian people. The lack of faith shown by the United States and now
Europe in carrying out their side of the nuclear bargain would seem to
vindicate those Iranians who argue that only nuclear weapons can provide
for Iran\'s security and shield it from potential attacks by the United
States, Israel, or both.]{.underline}** Should the government of
President Rouhani succumb to such pressures, **[[Iran hawks in the
U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates [and]{.mark} some [Iranian]{.mark}
[opposition groups]{.mark}-along with Israel, Saudi Arabia and the
UAE-[would lobby]{.mark} President [Trump to take military action
against Iran]{.mark}. Such pressures could reach irresistible
levels.]{.underline}** Within the Trump administration, National
Security Adviser **[[John Bolton, in particular, would champion such a
move]{.mark}, while Secretary of State Mike Pompeo is unlikely to put up
any opposition. [Bolton]{.mark} and other Iran hawks [would argue that,
as long as Iran is standing, the U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates [cannot
reduce the level of its military engagement in the Middle
East]{.mark}]{.underline}** and Southwest Asia war zones **[[because
Iran would]{.mark} otherwise [fill the vacuum]{.mark}]{.underline}**.
According to this logic, before reducing its overseas military
engagements in Syria or Afghanistan, the United States must effectively
disable Iran economically and militarily. **[The United States might
feel pressured to attack Iran for other reasons. Iran is the last
country on the list of regime change in the post-9/11 period that has
thus far escaped American military intervention, directly or through
proxies.]{.underline}** Iraq was invaded in 2003, Libya was attacked in
2010, and Syria has been devastated by civil war. For the foreseeable
future, none of these states will be able to influence Middle East
dynamics significantly, nor do they pose any military threat to
America\'s regional allies, notably Israel. In short, **[Iran is the
last remaining link in this chain of dismantling state systems in the
region.]{.underline}** Moreover, **[at the time of the U.S. invasion of
Iraq, some in the United States and in the region would have preferred
that America attacked Iran first and then Iraq. These people will not
feel safe until Iran is attacked. A main goal of security hawks in the
United States, as described in the 1992 U.S. Defense Planning Guidance
(which has never been superseded), has been \"to prevent any hostile
power from dominating a region whose resources would, under consolidated
control, be sufficient to generate global power.\" The document lists
Southwest Asia as one such region. In this region, Iran is the country
best suited to become the hub of regional power]{.underline}**. This
concern about Iran\'s potential did not start with the Islamic
revolution. America\'s change of heart regarding the shah was partly
because of his ambitions to turn Iran into a viable economic and
military power. Any other viable regime in post-Islamist Iran, including
a nationalist regime, would also want to develop the country\'s
resources. This might be one reason why the current American
administration favors the Mujahedin e-Khalq (MEK), rather than any other
opposition group, as the successor to the Islamist government. Reports
are circulating that the United States has moved back some MEK fighters
to Iraq, perhaps in anticipation of moving them into Iran. The MEK was
willing to support Saddam Hussain and cede Iran\'s Khuzestan province to
Iraq. There is no reason to think that it won\'t similarly follow U.S.
bidding. **[[The hawks\' ideal scenario involves Iran\'s]{.mark}
[disintegration along ethnic and linguistic lines]{.mark}, or at least
its transformation into a loose federation with a weak central power.
[Such goals]{.mark}, which [can\'t be achieved through sanctions and
destabilization efforts, would require military
operations]{.mark},]{.underline}** though short of a full-scale land
invasion. **[[A massive air strike]{.mark} [targeting Iran\'s vital
infrastructure]{.mark} would suffice. For some years now, many
[analysts]{.mark} have recommended such an option.]{.underline}**
**[Amitai Etzioni, for instance, once [said]{.mark} that [the
U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates [should confront Iran by bombing its
civilian infrastructure]{.mark} or risk losing the Middle East. Key U.S.
policymakers in the Trump administration share such views, as do key
U.S. regional allies.]{.underline}** There is one last reason why the
U.S. might attack Iran. **[Many in America have not forgiven Iran for
its 1979 revolution, the hostage crisis, and the defiant behavior it
adopted. They believe that allowing Iran to get away with this behavior
sends the wrong message to other potential challengers. In short, Iran
is a rebellious satrapy that must be subdued.]{.underline}** Of course,
the current Iranian regime could seif-dissolve and accept all the 12
conditions laid out by Secretary of State Pompeo. But Iran is unlikely
to do so. Instead, **[[Tehran would try to make potential military
operations as costly as]{.mark} [possible for the U]{.mark}nited
[S]{.mark}tates]{.underline}**. Therefore, **[those in the United
States-as well as in Europe and elsewhere-who do not want another
devastating war in the Middle East should do all they can to end the
current U.S.-lran standoff. One possible way of avoiding disaster would
be for the United States to suspend sanctions on Iran for a year in
exchange for Iran agreeing to new and wide-ranging talks on all
outstanding issues between the two states.]{.underline}** Key European
states could try to broker such a deal. Of course, for this suggestion
even to be considered, Iran must indicate willingness to engage in broad
and comprehensive talks with the United States, and be prepared to
reconsider the most controversial aspects of its foreign policy.

#### War with Iran is imminent and inevitable---sanctions are escalating tensions and the administration has legal justification for starting a war with Iran after designating the IRGC a "Foreign Terrorist Organization"

**[The [Trump]{.mark} administration [is laying siege to Iran. Taking
pages from the Iraq War playbook]{.mark}, senior officials paint a
picture of a rogue, outlaw, terrorist regime bent on acquiring nuclear
weapons and whose \"malign activities\" are the cause of all the chaos
in the Middle East.]{.underline}** They know what they are doing. They
have done it before. **[They are building a case for war.]{.underline}**
**[[The \"maximum pressure\" campaign]{.mark} by the White
House]{.underline}**, Treasury Department and State Department
**[[accelerated this week with the announcement that the U]{.mark}nited
[S]{.mark}tates [would force China, India, Japan, South Korea and Turkey
to cease all imports of Iranian oil or face]{.mark} severe U.S.
[sanctions. The goal is to cut to zero all of Iran\'s oil exports, which
account for some 40 percent of its national income]{.mark}. This
strategy is unlikely to force the capitulation or collapse of the
regime, but [it very likely could lead to war.]{.mark} [The
U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates has [already reimposed all the]{.mark}
nuclear-related [sanctions lifted by the]{.mark}]{.underline}** Joint
Comprehensive Plan of Action (**[[JCPOA) that]{.mark} successfully
[rolled back and]{.mark} effectively [froze Iran\'s nuclear
program]{.mark} and put it under the most stringent inspections ever
negotiated. [The]{.mark} goals of the [sanctions]{.mark}]{.underline}**
announced April 22, however, **[[go way beyond nuclear
issues]{.underline}]{.mark}**. \"We have made our demands very clear to
the ayatollah and his cronies,\" Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said in
remarks to the press Monday morning.\"End your pursuit of nuclear
weapons. Stop testing and proliferating ballistic missiles. Stop
sponsoring and committing terrorism. Halt the arbitrary detention of
U.S. citizens.\" All are worthy policy goals. The first, of course, has
been met. The National Intelligence Estimate on Iran concluded that Iran
ended its nuclear weapons program in 2003. There is no evidence that the
program has restarted. Instead, in true Trumpian fashion, the
administration simply asserts the counterfactual. It claims that the
program has restarted, with slippery phrases about seeking weapons or
references to long-ended activities. The media, overloaded with the
Mueller report and a daily cascade of lies, does not challenge these
claims. THE ROLE OF BOLTON **[It is no accident that National Security
Adviser John [Bolton]{.mark}, the man who [declared]{.mark}
[unequivocally]{.mark} in November 2002, \"[We are confident that Saddam
Hussain has hidden weapons of mass destruction and production facilities
in Iraq]{.mark},\" is now the chief strategist behind the drive toward
war-with Mike Pompeo happily riding shotgun. [Both are manipulating a
distracted and]{.mark} largely [uninformed president into a
confrontation]{.mark} he may not actually want. Although [Trump]{.mark}
came into office promising to cancel the JCPOA painstakingly negotiated
by the Obama administration and our allies, he [was initially held in
check]{.mark} by the united front of his military, intelligence and
diplomatic advisers.]{.underline}** Then, Trump ousted Rex Tillerson and
replaced him with Mike Pompeo. He fired H.R. McMaster and appointed John
Bolton. He accepted the resignation of Jim Mattis as secretary of
defense and replaced him with a former Boeing executive more interested
in contracts than policy. Bolton has had a clear field ever since. With
minimal or no inter-agency discussion, **[Bolton quickly dispensed with
the Iran accord, but he did not stop there.]{.underline}** By Christmas
2018, **[[Bolton]{.mark} had [dismantled what remained of U.S.-Iran
relations]{.mark}. The United States reinstated all sanctions on Iran
that were previously lifted by the Iran accord, and the State Department
pulled out of the 1955 Treaty of Amity between the United States and
Iran, which provided a \"legal framework for bilateral
relations.\"]{.underline}** As a result, Iran\'s currency hit a historic
low and the country witnessed waves of economic protests. **[Bolton used
his national platform to publicly send bellicose warnings to the regime
with statements like, \"If you cross us, our allies, or our partners. .
. there will indeed be hell to pay.\"]{.underline}** THE TERRORISM
\'CONNECTION\' **[[The \"maximum pressure\" campaign escalated]{.mark}
in 2019. When terrorists attacked the]{.underline}** Iranian
Revolutionary Guard Corps **[(IRGC)]{.underline}**-an official branch of
Iran\'s military-killing 27 and wounding 13, the State Department
offered no condolences. **[When widespread flooding devastated Iranian
cities and infrastructure, claiming 60 lives in one week, the United
States faulted the regime for the \"mismanagement that has led to this
disaster.\" The campaign hit a crescendo]{.underline}** on April 8,
2019-exactly one year to the day after Bolton\'s appointment-**[[with
the unprecedented move of designating the IRGC a \"Foreign Terrorist
Organization]{.mark}.\"]{.underline}** It now appears alongside the
Islamic State, al-Qaeda and Boko Haram on this list. That day Pompeo
delivered a statement to the press and public in which the words
\"terror,\" \"terrorism\" and \"terrorist\" appeared 21 times. **[[This
designation brings at least the IRGC and perhaps the entire nation
within arm\'s reach of the]{.mark} 2001 [Authorization for Use of
Military Force,]{.mark}]{.underline}** legislation originally written to
provide a legal basis for the invasion of Afghanistan in the wake of
9/11. The 2001 AUMF gives the president wide scope for the unilateral
use of force against any parties or individuals associated with the 9/11
attacks, a point not lost on Pompeo. For over a year, **[the
[Trump]{.mark} administration, and Pompeo in particular, [has been
exaggerating the connection between Iran and al-Qaeda to claim legal
justification for military action against Iran]{.mark}]{.underline}**
under the 2001 AUMF. In 2017, the CIA released additional records from
the bin Laden files, ostensibly \"to enhance public understanding of
al-Qaeda.\" Wrote former CIA analyst Ned Price: But this release by
Pompeo wasn\'t about transparency. **[Pompeo is playing politics with
intelligence, using these files in a ploy to bolster the case against
Iran by reinvigorating the debate on its terrorist ties.]{.underline}**
While the politicization of intelligence is more than sufficient cause
for concern, **[the fact that he appears to be returning to the Bush
administration\'s pre-Iraq war playbook underscores the danger. This
effort reeks of former vice president Dick Cheney\'s consistent false
allegations of links between Saddam Hussain\'s Iraq and the 9/11
attacks, a nexus the Bush administration debunked only after we had lost
too much in blood and treasure. Bolton, Pompeo and their allies in and
out of government continued to hype the Iran-al-Qaeda
link]{.underline}**. In May 2018, announcing the U.S. abrogation of the
nuclear agreement, **[Trump made a point of saying that \"Iran supports
terrorist proxies and militias such as. . . al-Qaeda]{.underline}**.\"
In a speech at the Heritage Foundation later that month, Pompeo said:
\"Today we ask the Iranian people: Is this what you want your country to
be known for, for being a co-conspirator with Hezbollah, Hamas, the
Taliban, and al-Qaeda?\" Experts have disparaged the administration\'s
claims, noting the longstanding hostility between Iran, a Shi\'i-
majority nation, and the radical Sunni group. A definitive New America
study published in late 2018 found no evidence that Iran and al-Qaeda
collaborated in carrying out terrorist attacks. That hasn\'t stopped the
administration from continuing the insinuations. In testimony before the
Senate Foreign Relations Committee, **[Pompeo went out of his way to
construct explicit connections between al-Qaeda and the
IRGC]{.underline}** with multiple statements like: \"there is no doubt
there is a connection between the Islamic Republic of Iran and al-Qaeda.
Period, full stop.\" INVOKING THE AUMF Sen. Rand Paul (R-KY) zeroed in
to the subtext of Pompeo\'s repetitive al-Qaeda-Iran connections. **[[If
the administration determines a valid link between al-Qaeda and]{.mark}
the [Iran]{.mark}ian [government, it may be able to declare war on
Ira]{.mark}n by using the 2001 AUMF, [bypassing Congress
entirely]{.mark}]{.underline}**. So, Senator Paul pressed Pompeo on that
point, asking him if he believes that the 2001 AUMF applies to Iran or
Iran\'s Revolutionary Guard. Pompeo dodged the question: \"I would
prefer to leave that to the lawyers, Senator.\" Neither Bolton nor
Pompeo has yet provided a clear answer. T**[[he administration\'s plan
is clear: keep beating the]{.mark} twin dr[ums of terrorism and nuclear
threat. Bolton and Pompeo will use both to justify more]{.mark}
sanctions and more [provocations]{.mark}.]{.underline}** They have a
highly disciplined, coordinated messaging strategy. **[They establish
the following false claim, as Bolton did this January]{.underline}** in
a conversation with Prime Minister Netanyahu of Israel: \"**[Despite
getting out of the Iran nuclear deal, despite the sanctions, we have
little doubt that Iran\'s leadership is still strategically committed to
achieving deliverable nuclear weapons]{.underline}**.\" The claims are
then echoed, as this one was in a Twitter video a few weeks later. And
again by U.S. Special Representative for Iran Brian Hook, in a New York
Times op-ed, demanding that Iran \"behave like a normal, peaceful
nation: end the pursuit of nuclear weapons, stop testing ballistic
missiles, stop sponsoring terrorist proxies.\" And again this week by
Pompeo, in announcing the oil sanctions, when he demanded that Iran
\"end \[its\] pursuit of nuclear weapons.\" It does not matter that U.S.
intelligence assessments-as well as Israeli intelligence and the
International Atomic Energy Agency-confirm that Iran is complying with
the JCPOA. Or that Saudi Arabia has likely funded al-Qaeda and other
Sunni terrorist groups. Or that the U.S. invasion of Iraq is the
principle cause of Middle East chaos today. **[Trump officials will
cherry-pick information, package it, and amplify it across a willing
echo chamber- exactly as the Bush administration did in the lead up to
the Iraq war. The real question is whether America will fall for it
again.]{.underline}**

#### Drones decrease civilian casualty risks in conflicts like Yemen

**Saletan 15**, (William, 4-23-2015, \"Civilian Deaths Would Be Much
Higher Without Drones,\" Slate Magazine,
https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2015/04/u-s-drone-strikes-civilian-casualties-would-be-much-higher-without-them.html)
accessed 7-2-2019

**[The New America Foundation keeps a different tally. Its figures imply
a civilian casualty rate of 8 percent to 12 percent in Pakistan and 8
percent to 9 percent in Yemen.]{.underline}** A third count, maintained
by the Long War Journal, indicates a 5 percent civilian casualty rate in
Pakistan (once Weinstein and Lo Porto are added to the tally) and 16
percent in Yemen. **[Compare those numbers with any other method of
warfare.]{.underline}** Start with an apples-to-apples comparison: the
Bureau of Investigative Journalism's analysis of "other covert
operations" in Yemen. According to BIJ's methodology, this category
consists of nondrone attacks by U.S. forces, "including airstrikes,
missile attacks and ground operations." **[BIJ counts 68 to 99 civilian
deaths in these operations, among 156 to 365 total casualties. That's a
civilian casualty rate of 27 percent to 44 percent: three times worse
than drone strikes in the same country]{.underline}**. Or look at the
bureau's data from Somalia. For drones, the BIJ counts 23 to 105
casualties, of whom zero to five were civilian. For other covert
operations, the BIJ counts 40 to 141 casualties, of whom seven to 47
were civilian. If you go with the low-end numbers, drones have a perfect
record in Somalia. **[If you go with the high-end numbers, drones are
seven times safer than the alternatives. In the past month, hundreds of
civilians have died in Yemen. But the culprit isn't drones. It's
old-fashioned airstrikes and artillery fire, courtesy of Saudi Arabia
and its Arab partners.]{.underline}** The campaign got off to a roaring
start, with attacks on schools, hospitals, houses, mosques, a market, a
dairy factory, and a refugee camp. As of April 14, the U.N. reported at
least 364 civilian deaths. During this time, **[the BIJ counted four
drone strikes in Yemen, resulting in 13 to 22 fatalities. None of them
were civilian]{.underline}**. Before the emergence of drones and other
precise weapons, war was far more dangerous for ordinary people. **[In
World War II, an estimated 40 to 67 percent of the dead were civilians.
In Korea, the estimate was 70 percent. In Vietnam, it was about one
civilian for every two enemy combatants.]{.underline}** In the Persian
Gulf War, it may have been no better. In Kosovo, it seems to have been
worse. In Afghanistan, civilian deaths have been estimated at 60 to 150
percent of Taliban deaths. In Iraq, civilians account for more than 80
percent of the casualties. To be fair, these were full-blown wars. You
can argue that the better alternative to drone strikes is diplomacy, not
invasion**[. But you ought to credit drones, conversely, for providing a
military alternative to all-out war.]{.underline}** Last summer, Israel
took extraordinary measures to avoid killing innocent people in Gaza.
But the results were still horrific. According to a postwar
investigation by the Associated Press, **[Israel's 247 airstrikes on
residential buildings killed 844 people. Of these, 508 were women,
children, or men aged 60 or older, "all presumed to be
civilians."]{.underline}**

#### Drones stabilize conflicts such as Yemen - Sustainability, Precision, and Cost Prove 

**Parker 18**, (Clifton 3-6-2018, the Social Sciences Writer at Stanford
News, \"Next-gen drones will enable cheap, credible threats,\" Futurity,
https://www.futurity.org/armed-drones-coercion-threats-1696282-2/)
accessed 7-2-2019

"Armed drones are likely to offer coercion 'windows of opportunity' in
at least one important circumstance: states that have armed drones
confronting states that do not," says Amy Zegart, political scientist at
Stanford University. "**[As wars grow longer and less conclusive, armed
drones enable states to sustain combat operations, making threats to
'stay the course' more believable]{.underline}**." Zegart believes that
drone technology is becoming a more effective instrument to change a
state's behavior than yesteryear's more costly option of using ground
troops or large-scale military movements in war or conflict. "**[Drones
may be turning deterrence theory on its head," says Zegart, referring to
the cost-benefit calculation a potential aggressor makes when assessing
an attack.]{.underline}** Zegart's focus is on next-generation drones,
which are essentially unpiloted fighter jets and are currently in
development. She is not examining the use of existing drones like
quadcopters and Reaper and Predator unmanned aerial vehicles. Three
coercion advantages Zegart's research, published in the Journal of
Strategic Studies, is based on surveys of 259 foreign military officers
that took place between 2015 and 2017. Participants were highly
experienced foreign military officers who were attending classes at the
National Defense University and Naval War College. A drone is an
unmanned aircraft that can be piloted remotely to deliver a lethal
payload to a specific target. Today, Zegart says, many scholars are
studying whether drone proliferation across the world could change the
future of warfare. "But even here the focus has been the implications
for the use of force, not the threat of force," says Zegart, director of
Stanford's Center for International Security and Cooperation, and senior
fellow at the Hoover Institution. New weapons often evolve
technologically before "game-changing ideas" occur about how to use
them. **[New drones are more lethal than ever, offering greater speeds,
ranges, stealth, and agility, according to Zegart. The US is ahead, but
not alone, in using drones. Nine countries have already used armed
drones in combat, and at least 20 more are developing lethal drone
programs---including Russia and China.]{.underline}** "It is time for a
rethink" about drones, Zegart says. Technological advances will soon
enable drones to function in hostile environments better than ever
before. "**[Drones offer three unique coercion advantages that theorists
did not foresee: sustainability in long duration conflicts; certainty of
precision punishment, which can change the psychology of adversaries;
and changes in the relative costs of war," she says]{.underline}**.
Threats involving a high cost may be actually less credible than
assumed, says Zegart. Her findings challenge the belief of "cost
signals," a military strategy where a country threatens another with a
high-cost option, such as ground troops, which is intended to show
resolve. Why big data can't predict the next armed conflict **[Drones
may actually signal a nation's resolve more effectively because---as a
low-cost option---they can be part of an enduring offensive campaign
against an enemy.]{.underline}** "The advent of armed drones suggests
that costly signals may no longer be the best or only path to threat
credibility," she says. "In situations where a coercing state has armed
drones but a target state does not, drones make it possible to implement
threats in ways that impose vanishingly low costs on the coercer but
disproportionately high costs on the target," Zegart says. It's happened
before Zegart says that throughout history, whenever a new military
technology emerges, adversaries have basically faced two
choices---either concede or innovate to overcome the other side's
advantage. "There is no reason to expect drones will be any different.
**[The more that drones are used for combat and coercion, the more
likely it will be that others will develop drone
countermeasures,"]{.underline}** she says.

#### Military drones cause less casualties, are effective, and minimalize threats to citizens

**Simkovits 17**, (Mathew, undergraduate studying political science and
economics at Washington University in St. Louis., 6-16-2017, \"Drone
Strikes, Pro,\" Common Reader,
https://commonreader.wustl.edu/drone-strikes-pro/) accessed 7-3-2019

In fact, **[proponents of drone strikes argue that in comparison to the
military operations that would be required to perform similar functions,
drone strikes actually minimalize collateral damage.]{.underline}** For
example**[, boots-on-the-ground assaults and large-scale air strikes
tend to have much greater casualties (about seven times as
many).]{.underline}** Additionally, drone strikes typically occur after
large intelligence gathering operations, and they have the ability to
hover over an area until the optimal time to strike. In terms of
effectiveness against terrorism, proponents argue that **[drone strikes
effectively remove terrorist leadership, disrupt terrorist organizations
and deny terrorist sanctuaries]{.underline}**. **[Some examples are this
strike, which killed Osama bin Laden's chief aide, Atiyah Abd al-Rahman
in 2011]{.underline}**, and this one, which recently killed Abu al-Khayr
al-Masribi, Osama's son-in-law and al-Qaeda ideological leader. There
has also been some **[quantitative evidence in favor of the
effectiveness of drone strikes as well]{.underline}**. One study found
**[that drone strikes lead to a decrease in both the incidence and
lethality of terror attacks, at least in the short-run.]{.underline}**
Finally, proponents argue that **[drones' ability to remotely target
terrorists reduces the direct risk counterterrorism operations place on
American soldiers]{.underline}**. This argument has long been one of the
most convincing in favor of drone strikes. **[A country has an
obligation to minimalize threats posed to its citizens, and since drone
strikes certainly do so in the case of American soldiers, this is a
strong point in their favor.]{.underline}**

#  AT: International Law Advantage

##  Defense

#### International law doesnt succeed- no one pays attention to it. All countries act in their own self interest

**Goldsmith and Posner 05** (Jack L. Goldsmith and Eric A. Posner,
lawyer and Harvard Professor, [a professor of international law,
contract law, and bankruptcy, among other areas attended Yale and
Harvard, April 2005, "The Limits of International
Law",https://www.studocu.com/en-gb/document/the-university-of-edinburgh/international-law/summaries/the-limits-of-international-law/4470976/view,
07/ 07/19)]{.mark}

**[[The UN played a relatively minor role in bringing the conflicts in
the Balkans to the end. Members of the Security Council could not agree
on the use of force in Kosovo, and the NATO intervention was thus a
violation of international law. The various inter- national criminal
tribunals turned out to be cum- bersome and expensive institutions, they
brought relatively few people to justice, and they stirred up the ethnic
tensions they were meant to quell. Aggressive international trade
integration pro- duced a violent backlash in many countries. Treaty
mechanisms seemed too weak to solve the most serious global problems,
including environ- mental degradation and human rights
abuses.]{.underline}]{.mark}** American Reluctance on Treaties The
biggest problem, from the perspective of international law advocates,
has been the United States. Long the champion of international legal-
ization and the richest and most powerful country, the United States was
a laggard in the 1990s. [[During treaty negotiations, the United States
consistently worked to weaken treaty language and create
exceptions.]{.underline}]{.mark} It ended up opposing the International
Criminal Court and has cajoled dozens of countries into entering
bilateral immunity agreements, which require them not to turn over
Americans on their territory to the ICC. It refused to enter the Kyoto
Global Climate Change Treaty. It refused to enter a treaty that banned
landmines. It has refused to enter several human rights treaties, and it
has entered others only subject to reservations that ensure that they do
not change Ameri- can policy. It led the illegal intervention in Kosovo.
Although many other states have been recalcitrant about these and
similar international institutions--- including Russia, China, India,
and other major powers---it has come as a shock to many American
internationalists that the United States acts more like these countries
than like western European countries. From their perspective, matters
only became worse after 9/11. The American military response to the al
Qaeda threat has raised grave questions of international law. So has
both the invasion of Iraq---arguably, in viola- tion of the UN
Charter---and the conduct of the war there. The Bush administration also
has forcefully reiter- ated American opposition to the ICC and to Kyoto,
and withdrawn from the ABM treaty with Russia; and many of its officials
have shown skepticism about the value of international law for American
foreign policy. International law advocates now regard the United States
as a rogue state but have no ideas about how to change American
behavior. Defenders of American for- eign policy sometimes argue that
**[[nobody pays attention to international law,]{.underline}]{.mark}**
and so therefore the United States should not; and, at other times, they
argue that **[[weak states are using international law to prevent the
United States from acting in its national
interest.]{.underline}]{.mark}** The partisan debate is hampered by lack
of understanding about how international law really operates. Relations
between Self-Interested States The Limits of International Law intends
to fill that gap. The book begins with the premise that all states,
nearly all the time, make foreign policy decisions, including the
decisions whether to enter treaties and comply with international law,
based on an assessment of their national interest. Using a simple
game-theoretical framework, Goldsmith and Posner argue that **[[interna-
tional law is intrinsically weak and unstable, because states will
comply with international law only when they fear that noncompliance
will result in retaliation or other reputational
injuries.]{.underline}]{.mark}** This framework helps us understand the
errors of the international law advocates and their critics. On the one
hand, **[large multilateral treaties that treat all states as equal are
unattractive to powerful states, which either refuse to enter the
treaties, enter them subject to numerous reservations that undermine the
treaties' obligations, or refuse to comply with them. The problem with
these treaties is that they treat states as equals when in fact they are
not, and they implicitly rely on collective sanctions when states prefer
to free ride. Thus, [many human rights treaties are generally not
enforced, and so they have little effect on states' behav- ior. And the
international trade system is mainly a framework in which bilateral
enforcement occurs, so powerful states may cooperate with other powerful
states but not with weaker states, whose remedies for trade vio- lations

asylum officers filed a federal court brief demanding an end to
President Donald Trump\'s so-called \"Remain in Mexico\" policy under
which asylum seekers have been turned away at the U.S.-Mexico border.
Ordering people who are exercising their legal right to seek asylum to
turn back and endure a months-long or years-long wait for their
applications to be processed is \"fundamentally contrary to the moral
fabric of our nation and our international and domestic legal
obligations,]{.underline}**\" wrote the American Federation of

officers. **[\"By forcing a vulnerable population to return to a hostile
territory where they are likely to face persecution, the MPP abandons

Federation of]{.underline}** Government Employees Local 1924 The amicus
brief was filed by the union in support of the ACLU, which is
challenging the Remain in Mexico policy, officially known as Trump\'s
Migrant Protection Protocols (MPP) program. Since Trump enacted the
program in January, the Mexican government says about 15,000 people have
been sent to Mexico while their applications are processed. Human rights
advocates have decried the policy, warning that asylum seekers may face
violence in Mexico as many did in their home countries. \"By forcing a
vulnerable population to return to a hostile territory where they are
likely to face persecution, the MPP abandons our tradition of providing
a safe haven to the persecuted and violates our international and
domestic legal obligations,\" reads the brief. Earlier this month, the
president also reached a deal with Mexican President Andrés Manuel López
Obrado, under which Mexico agreed to step up immigration enforcement in
exchange for the cancellation of tariffs. **[Weeks later, police in
Veracruz reportedly opened fire on a truck carrying Central American
immigrants, killing a young woman. When Trump enacted the MPP program,
his administration claimed that if asylum seekers are allowed to wait in
the U.S. while their applications are processed, they would \"disappear
into the United States.\" In fact, the union noted, there is \"no
evidence\" that asylum seekers pose any security risk.]{.underline}**
Justice Department statistics indicate that 90 percent of people fulfill
their legal obligations while awaiting asylum rulings in the United
States. \"The MPP is entirely unnecessary,\" wrote the union. \"The
system has been tested time and again, and it is fully capable---with
additional resources where appropriate---of efficiently processing
asylum claims by those with valid claims while removing those that are
not entitled to protection after they undergo the process designed to
ensure that they will not be returned to a place where they will be
persecuted.\" **[By failing to adhere to the 1967 Protocol, the U.N.
accord stating that participating countries including the U.S. would not
\"expel or return a refugee in any manner,\" wrote the officers, the
Trump administration is compelling government employees to break
international law.]{.underline}** \"The MPP places \[asylum officers\]
at risk of participation in the widespread violation of international
treaty and domestic legal obligations,\" wrote the union, \"something
that they did not sign up to do when they decided to become asylum and
refugee officers for the United States government.\"

Second, as a practical matter, the new [international law has the
potential to undermine American leadership]{.underline} in the post-Cold
War global system. Even more fundamentally, [international
law]{.underline} may well make the world safe for aggression, by
[imposing]{.underline} undue [constraints on]{.underline} those
[countries that are willing to use force]{.underline} to deter and
punish it. Although, as noted above, the new international law has a
number of manifestations, those elements dealing with the use of
military force, and the potential consequences for individual American
officials who order or implement its use, are the most advanced and
pernicious. As the world\'s pre-eminent military power, with global
interests and responsibilities, [the U]{.underline}nited
[S]{.underline}tates [should be]{.underline} very
[concerned]{.underline} [about]{.underline} any [effort to
create]{.underline} international judicial [institutions capable of
prosecuting]{.underline} individual [soldiers]{.underline}, officers and
elected officials in the chain of command. [The]{.underline}
international criminal [\"norms]{.underline}\" [applied in these
courts]{.underline}, both in the ad hoc criminal courts for the former
Yugoslavia and Rwanda and in the International Criminal Court, [are
ambiguous]{.underline} in their meaning [and]{.underline} remarkably
fluid in their application. For example, one of the \"[war crimes
prosecutable]{.underline} in the ICC is [defined as]{.underline}
\[i\]ntentionally [launching an attack]{.underline} [in the knowledge
that]{.underline} such [attack will cause]{.underline} incidental loss
of life or injury to civilians or damage to civilian objects or
widespread, long-term and severe [damage to the]{.underline} natural
[environment]{.underline} which would be clearly excessive in relation
to the concrete and direct overall military advantage anticipated.
Whether any particular attack causes \"excessive\" civilian injuries or
environmental damage is very much a matter of opinion.
[This]{.underline} is, in fact, a [crime]{.underline} that [can be
tailored to fit almost any circumstances]{.underline}, as was all but
openly acknowledged by the prosecutor\'s office of the Yugoslav tribunal
during its investigation of alleged NATO war crimes. This investigation
was undertaken after a number of NGOs complained that NATO\'s 1999 air
campaign against Serbia resulted in too many civilian deaths. As
candidly noted in \[t\]he answers to these questions \[regarding
allegedly excessive civilian casualties\] are not simple. It may be
necessary to resolve them on a case by case basis, and the answers may
differ depending on the background and values of the decision-maker. It
is unlikely that a human rights lawyer and an experienced combat
commander would assign the same relative values to military advantage
and to injury to noncombatants. Further, it is unlikely that military
commanders with different doctrinal backgrounds and differing degrees of
combat experience or national military histories would always agree in
close cases. \[4\] The key underlying problem here is that injuries to
noncombatants and their property\--so-called \"collateral damage\"\--are
an endemic consequence of combat. As a result, the traditional law of
war, jus in hello, although proscribing certain hostile actions toward
civilians, eschewed overly rigid rules on collateral damage.
Unfortunately, instead of continuing to rely on the broad, traditional
jus in hello principles of proportionality and discrimination, the new
norms have come to resemble American domestic regulatory law. These
rules are overly prescriptive and proscriptive, to such an extent that
ensuring full compliance has become almost impossible. This is
particularly the case because the new international law seems to suggest
that zero civilian casualties and no collateral damage are not only
attainable outcomes in modern combat, but that these should be the norm.
The combination of the unrealistic norms and unaccountable judicial
bodies that would apply them is particularly problematic. [The American
military is]{.underline} particularly [vulnerable here]{.underline}.
This is because [U.S. military doctrine has always been]{.underline}
attrition-oriented, [emphasizing]{.underline} the intensive [application
of firepower]{.underline} and the use of \"decisive force.\" [It is
inevitable]{.underline} [that damage to civilian sites]{.underline}, and
civilian casualties, [will result]{.underline}. This is all the more
likely given the growing American aversion to combat casualties, which
forces our military commanders to rely more and more on air strikes and
missile attacks. This raises the real possibility that American soldiers
and [officials will be]{.underline} considered [subject to
prosecution]{.underline}, [even]{.underline} in situations [where the
intervention has been \"humanitarian]{.underline}\" in character, as
with the air campaign against Serbia. Significantly, while no
prosecutions against NATO officials are currently planned, even the
relatively tame Yugoslav tribunal did not give the alliance a clean bill
of health. Indeed, the prosecutor\'s office declined to bring
indictments, not because it concluded that no crimes were committed by
NATO, but because \"\[i\]n all cases, either the law is not sufficiently
clear or investigations are unlikely to result in the acquisition of
sufficient evidence to substantiate charges against high level accused
or against lower accused for particularly heinous offenses.\" Future
outcomes in the permanent ICC, a court that will be less dependent upon
U.S. and NATO largesse than is the Yugoslav tribunal, may be very
different. And the fact that the United States has not signed, and would
not ratify, the ICC treaty will not prevent the ICC from pursuing
Americans. The court claims to exercise a form of \"universal
jurisdiction\" that will allow it to prosecute American citizens when
their actions, or the effects of their ac tions, take place on the
territory of a state that has signed the ICC treaty. Moreover, the
danger here is not limited to the potential actions of the ICC. Based on
the \"universal jurisdiction\" theory\--which suggests that any state
can prosecute international humanitarian violations wherever they occur,
whether or not that state\'s own citizens are involved\--any state, or
even a low-level foreign magistrate, can begin a prosecution against
American military or civilian officials. This was, of course, the case
with the former Chilean dictator, Augusto Pinochet, who traveled to
England for medical treatment in 1998, and was very nearly extradited to
Spain to stand trial for his actions during his rule in Chile. Overall,
there is no doubt that, insofar as they can successfully claim the right
to prosecute military and civilian leaders for violations of the laws of
war and international humanitarian norms, international [judicial
bodies]{.underline} [and]{.underline} interested [states
will]{.underline} be able [effectively to shape American
policy.]{.underline} An [American president would be far less likely to
use force if there were a genuine possibility that]{.underline} U.S.
soldiers or [officials]{.underline}, [including himself]{.underline},
[would face]{.underline} future [prosecution]{.underline} in a foreign
court. Both our [allies and our adversaries]{.underline} fully
[understand]{.underline} [the importance of]{.underline}
[molding]{.underline} the new [international law]{.underline}
[to]{.underline} fit their needs, and its power as [an]{.underline}
[effective weapon against the U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates[.
Examples]{.underline} of this phenomenon [are not difficult to
find.]{.underline} Human [rights activists]{.underline}, of course, have
frequently made [exaggerated]{.underline} [claims that]{.underline}
pre-existing international humanitarian [norms require]{.underline}
fundamental [changes in]{.underline} U.S. [foreign]{.underline} and
domestic [policy]{.underline}. [States are]{.underline} also
increasingly [using]{.underline} the language of [law as a means of
shaping U.S. policy]{.underline}. In one of the most boldly cynical
examples of this phenomenon, the People\'s Republic of
[China]{.underline}\--[desperate to prevent American deployment
of]{.underline} even a limited anti-ballistic [missile
defense]{.underline}\--has [asserted]{.underline} that [the]{.underline}
1972 Anti-Ballistic Missile [Treaty between the U]{.underline}nited
[S]{.underline}tates [and the Soviet]{.underline} [Union]{.underline}
[remains in force (even though the Soviet Union disappeared]{.underline}
a decade ago), and that it cannot be terminated by the United States
because that treaty has assumed the status of \"customary\"
international law.

#### Drone prolif good for national security and strengthens US hegemony

**Lin-Greenberg 18**, (Erik, Post Doctoral fellow expert in
international relations. Focuses on the impact of unmanned weapons
systems on military escalation. 4-24-2018, \"Why Washington's New Drone
Export Policy Is Good For National Security,\" War on the Rocks,

accessed 7-2-2019

**[When allies turn to other states for advanced military technology,
U.S. national security suffers]{.underline}** in three critical ways.
**[First, withholding military technology from close allies and partners
can strain security relationships. Since these partnerships are grounded
in trust, shared interests, and common threats, partners may equate a
state's unwillingness to export drones with waning loyalty and
commitment to other security agreements.]{.underline}** **[For instance,
the former top Italian Air Force general questioned Washington's initial
denial of Italy's request for armed drones, arguing that "it seemed
impossible that a loyal ally could be ruled out" from receiving armed
drones.]{.underline}** He noted that "in Afghanistan, we would have
saved Italian lives if we had had armed drones." By streamlining the
process for foreign states to acquire U.S. drones, the new policy helps
reduce this sort of tension that can engender mistrust and muddy
interactions between Washington and its partners. **[Second, denying
exports can degrade effectiveness and interoperability during coalition
operations. By not exporting weapons to allies, supplier states
potentially limit the ability of allies to share operational
burdens]{.underline}**. For instance, export controls and international
agreements that blocked the transfer of armed drones to many NATO allies
left Washington responsible for operating the bulk of armed drones in
Afghanistan. **[This demand placed additional strain on the already
under-manned and overstretched American capacity. Additionally, if
states turn to alternate suppliers, their ability to easily operate with
American forces may be reduced.]{.underline}** Common systems and
similar technical infrastructure helps streamline information sharing,
planning, maintenance, and operations. **[Given the frequency of
coalition operations in the current security environment,
interoperability is key to increasing operational effectiveness and
reducing the likelihood of mishaps and confusion during future crises
and contingencies. Third, and perhaps most strategically important,
Washington loses political and military influence when states turn to
other suppliers. When a state transfers arms, it hopes to establish
influence in the recipient state throughout and beyond the lifecycle of
the weapon system. In the short term, influence is established via
agreements to train personnel or maintain equipment.]{.underline}**
Producer states design training curricula and can withhold future
deliveries, parts, or maintenance if a recipient takes actions that run
counter to their interests. **[Over time, these relationships often
deepen into wider security partnerships]{.underline}**. For instance,
personnel who operate U.S.-produced equipment frequently attend training
or exercises in the United States**[. There, they gain exposure to U.S.
military principles, culture, and values. Because of these experiences,
these personnel may be selected for professional military education
programs like the U.S.]{.underline}** Air Force's Air War College later
in their careers. **[These relationships can strengthen bonds between
personnel from the United States and states that receive U.S.-built
equipment, ensuring long-term American influence.]{.underline}** **[The
new policy makes it easier for the United States to provide drones to
foreign states, helping to prevent Washington from losing influence to
China and other supplier states who are eager to increase their global
sway.]{.underline}** While the export of U.S.-produced drones enhances
national security, what effect will increased drone sales have on
international security? **[Drone proliferation pessimists often lament
that weakening drone export controls will make it easier for states to
launch military operations and destabilize security by triggering arms
racing between states eager to one-up their rival's drone capabilities.
These concerns are likely overstated for two reasons. First, the
transfer of drones is unlikely to be inherently destabilizing. To be
sure, the reduced risk associated with operating remotely piloted
aircraft may lead risk-averse decision-makers to more frequently launch
drones on intelligence gathering and strike missions. However, limited
transfers of drone technology have had a minimal effect on regional
stability.]{.underline}** For instance, Iraq and Nigeria have used
recently acquired drones to launch missile strikes on suspected
terrorists, but these operations have been limited in scale and
geographic scope. Carrying out worldwide drone operations like those
conducted by the United States requires a massive technological and
logistical infrastructure, and as I describe in a forthcoming book
chapter, a complex backbone of intelligence personnel and organizations
that costs billions and takes decades to develop**[. Even if countries
acquire drone aircraft, it takes time to develop the required network of
bases, satellites, computer systems, and personnel before a state can
conduct sustained, large-scale drone operations. Second, even if the
sale of drones under the new policy triggers drone arms racing, remotely
piloted aircraft often have a stabilizing effect on crisis
situations.]{.underline}** As I have argued elsewhere, **[drones allow
states to carry out military operations without risking significant
escalation. Drones can help stabilize crises by collecting intelligence
that can make subsequent operations more precise or limited, or can be
deployed in lieu of more escalatory means, like ground forces or manned
aircraft.]{.underline}** While states may be more prone to launch drones
on risky missions, **[states are unlikely to take escalatory military or
diplomatic responses after a drone is lost to enemy
action]{.underline}**. In other words, drones provide a de-escalatory
off-ramp that typically is not an option when inhabited assets are
involved. For instance, the Pentagon largely ignored Syria's downing of
a remotely piloted Predator reconnaissance drone in 2015. In contrast,
Syria's recent shoot down of an inhabited Israel Air Force F-16 fighter
in February triggered a massive Israeli retaliation that reportedly
destroyed half of Syrian air defenses. **[As drones become an
increasingly common fixture on the modern battlefield, the new export
policy marks an important step in managing their proliferation and
promoting Washington's national security interests. Streamlining the
drone export process helps Washington strengthen ties with allies and
partners, enhances interoperability during coalition operations, and
limits the ability of competitors to jeopardize U.S.
influence.]{.underline}** But more can be done to ensure allies can
acquire U.S. drones. For instance, one retired Air Force general just
called for changes to the Missile Technology Control Regime that would
reclassify drones like the Reaper and ease their export. Until then,
China and other drone producer states may attempt to woo customers by
undercutting U.S. prices. Or, they might impose fewer political
conditions to sales, allowing exports to states with shadier human
rights records.

Second, [some analysts **exaggerate the capabilities of
current-generation drones**. With limited weapons capabilities, the
ability to operate only at relatively slow speeds, and no ability to
defend themselves against ground-based or airborne threats, there are
significant limits on the types of operations where drones are useful.
Current-generation drones are unlikely to be useful in contested
environments. As a result, the utility of drones for interstate
operations or coercive diplomacy is quite limited when an adversary has
sophisticated air defenses.]{.underline} Third, existing views on drone
proliferation gloss over a key point: [drones]{.underline} may [have
stabilizing effects on the international security environment in some
cases. Our analysis suggests that by enhancing the ability of states to
monitor disputed territories and borders, drones can potentially reduce
uncertainty about an adversary\'s behavior, which could promote peace if
the enemy\'s intentions are benign. If the adversary is making
preparations for an attack, drones could increase the likelihood of
early detection.]{.underline} Particularly given the fledgling, albeit
shaky, norm that shooting down drones does not constitute grounds for
escalating a conflict, [this is a significant aspect of drone
proliferation that existing studies ignore.]{.underline} But, because
they make countries more likely to use force in certain circumstances
and are easier to deploy, there is always a risk that drones could
encourage crisis escalation in a case where an actor views the shooting
down of its drones as especially provocative, or where the deployment of
a drone leads to a diplomatic incident that might not otherwise occur.
Fourth, [current-generation drones could have significant consequences
for domestic politics. Democracies likely value drones in part because
they reduce the risk of casualties, making the use of force more
acceptable to the public.]{.underline} On the other hand, authoritarian
leaders may find drones attractive for monitoring and repressing
domestic opponents. [Drones may also allow leaders to exert greater
control over the military and become less dependent on large number of
soldiers on the battlefield. In this context, the technical constraints
of drones are minimized because governments generally control their
airspace, reducing the risk that a drone would be shot
down.]{.underline} To date, there have been relatively few uses of
drones domestically, but this may change in the future. Leaders in
Nigeria and Pakistan have used already drones to address regime threats,
and it is not inconceivable that other states, such as Saudi Arabia, may
employ armed drones to deal with similar threats in the future. Fifth,
[even small drones could prove useful for militant groups that deploy
drones attached with inexpensive and rudimentary explosives as weapons.
Countries such as the United States tend to have sophisticated air
defenses that are focused on larger aerial objects, or advanced ground
defenses geared toward stopping a truck full of explosives, but nonstate
groups seeking to wreak havoc could do so with drones that become the
equivalent of suicide bombs.]{.underline} Future Developments One
[challenge in assessing the consequences of drone proliferation is the
speed of technological change.]{.underline} This article focuses on
current-generation drones, but [next-generation systems already in
development could improve the capabilities of drones to perform the
types of surveillance and strike missions they do now, as well as gain
the ability to conduct new missions currently limited to manned
aircraft. For example, China is currently pursuing the development of a
stealth drone, reportedly named the Sharp Sword, which has already
undergone initial flight testing.]{.underline} The Sharp Sword would not
only have a larger weapons bay than China\'s CH-4 or Wing Loong; it
would also have low observability characteristics that could make it
harder for Western radars to detect. Until early 2016, the U.S. Navy was
considering acquiring a next-generation armed drone (UCLASS, as
mentioned above) as the follow-on to the X-47B, an experimental
platform. The X-47B has an air-to-air refueling capability, allowing it
to extend its range. Also, it is reportedly designed to support stealth
technology, and it uses a piloting algorithm to take off from and land
on an aircraft carrier. Some plans for follow-on programs included a
large weapons bay capable of launching a wide variety of munitions, not
just the Hellfire used by the Reaper and the Predator.133 The United
States decided, however, to turn the UCLASS program into an unmanned,
carrier-based, air-to-air refueling program---the MQ-25
Stingray/Carrier-Based Aerial Refueling System (CBARS)---and delay
acquisition of a next-generation armed platform.134 The capabilities
demonstrated by the X47-B show, however, that if bureaucratic political
support exists, the United States could build a drone with the ability
to do what current-generation drones cannot do (i.e., operate in
environments with adversary air defenses and complete strike missions
more like those conducted by manned aircraft now). Similarly, one
version of plans for the U.S. Air Force\'s Long Range Strike Bomber
includes an "optional manning" feature that would allow the aircraft to
go from a manned to an unmanned platform, "meant to give the bomber the
best attributes of a killer drone (long endurance, no risk to aircrews)
and a manned warplane (greater flexibility and the ability to respond to
a fast-acting enemy)."135 [These advances would make drones more useful
in conventional, interstate settings given that they would be less
vulnerable to air defenses. As a result, armed drones might assume a
larger role in the context of wars such as the conflict in Syria or in a
potential U.S.-China or NATO-Russia conflict. Although more
operationally capable drones could translate into more capabilities for
striking in contested environments, it is unlikely that they would make
interstate conflict---which is rare for a number of
reasons136---significantly more likely.]{.underline} In addition[,
ongoing trends in the development of commercial drones could reduce the
cost of drones and make them financially advantageous for militaries to
acquire. Military technologies based on underlying commercial
capabilities generally experience faster relative price declines than
military technologies such as stealth, which have only military
markets.137 As the commercial drone market continues growing around the
world, price competition in the high-end commercial market is likely to
make more capabilities]{.underline} (excluding the military aspects of
those capabilities, such as the most advanced surveillance packages and
launching weapons) [available at a lower price point. Trends in the
development of military robotics suggest that drones are merely the
beginning with regard to the integration of robotics in militaries
around the world. For example, Israel already deploys an armed, remotely
piloted, naval surface ship to patrol its sea borders]{.underline}.138
The U.S. Navy is developing the Knifefish, an unmanned underwater
vehicle that will help protect its ships from sea mines.139 Russia is
reportedly developing ground-based drones to help guard the perimeters
of its ballistic missile bases.140 These systems are likely to be among
the first of many developed and deployed by militaries around the world.
From European countries facing labor shortages and budget crunches to
autocracies concerned with regime stability above all, drones and
related military robotic systems are likely to appear increasingly
attractive over the next decade. As drones move from a niche capability
to part and parcel of how militaries generate and deploy military power,
their effects will undoubtedly change. Over the longer term, as
technological uncertainty increases, the effects of military robotics
could further shift the development and use of military power. For
example, a shift to smaller, cheaper swarming platforms---which involve
many drones flying together in formation---as opposed to large platforms
could drive changes in how military operate. Given the significant
uncertainty about technological trends in these areas, however, such
outcomes remain speculative. Conclusion To whatever extent a U.S.
monopoly on cutting-edge drones existed, it is over. Given ongoing
proliferation trends and the technological advancements made by
countries such as China, drones (and military robotics more generally)
appear to be a critical area of military investment for many states over
the next generation. How should the United States respond to this trend?
Washington has placed significant restrictions on UAV exports, but if
widespread proliferation is likely anyway, especially as countries such
as China and Israel seem to be less discriminate in the marketplace, the
United States could increase its level of drone exports. Which policy
would best advance U.S. strategic interests in the coming years and
decades? There is no easy answer, as there are costs and benefits
associated with each approach. One contribution of our study is to
underscore the trade-offs that the United States must consider as it
responds to the proliferation of drones. The global spread of militarily
useful UAVs could affect U.S. national security, but in more limited
ways than the alarmist view suggests---namely, by lowering barriers to
the use of force domestically or in uncontested airspace. That drones
are unlikely to prompt new interstate conflicts or transform
international relations, however, suggests that the United States could
reap the benefits of exporting UAVs in some cases while avoiding the
most significant costs. Moreover, given the potential for drones to
provide useful information about an adversary\'s maneuvers and possibly
ease tension in some circumstances, U.S. exports could help provide
reassurance to Washington and its allies. Nevertheless, there are
several potential concerns for the United States regarding drone
proliferation. As described above, technological advancements will
likely make some drones more suitable for use in contested airspace,
potentially increasing their military and political effects. Indeed, as
drones continue proliferating and are used for a much broader array of
missions than counterterrorism strikes, the U.S. military will have to
consider how to deal with the use of drones by potential adversaries in
areas where its forces are present. The use of armed drones also raises
important ethical dilemmas that may become more acute as the technology
spreads globally. The United States has a potential role to play in
shaping global norms for drone use. More transparency by the United
States concerning its decisionmaking process for drone strikes could
give it more credibility in seeking to convince other countries to use
their newly acquired drone capabilities in ways that comply with
international law.141 Finally, one long-term risk for the United States
is that its edge in more traditional, manned systems causes it to
underestimate the potential uses of drones and other military robotic
systems as the technology continues to advance. Leading militaries often
struggle in the face of innovation, as it can be difficult to combine
new technologies with human capital and organizational processes to
effectively field them.142 That the U.S. Air Force has no program of
record for the development of a next-generation armed drone and the U.S.
Navy canceled the UCLASS program suggests that the bureaucratic politics
of drones remain an important obstacle. In any case, it seems likely
that drones are here to stay.[143 It would therefore behoove the
international community to anticipate the regional and international
consequences of further drone proliferation. Our analysis shows that
understanding these consequences first requires identifying the contexts
in which drones may be used. Based on that perspective, **it is clear
that current-generation drones are not uniformly
transformative**.]{.underline} When it comes to future developments,
however, it may be a different story.

**[Problems in the IR Literature The mainstream view among IR scholars
suffers from several problems. First, the assumption that military
technology diffuses quickly and easily lacks empirical and theoretical
support. The existing literature does not provide concluding evidence
that military technology is easy to produce or that it diffuses easily;
moreover, this claim contradicts the literature in economics, economic
history, management, and sociology]{.underline}**.**[21
As]{.underline}** **[the gap in military capabilities between the United
States and Europe illustrates, the number of exceptions is such that
they cannot be discounted as simple anomalies.22 Part of this failure
can be attributed to the fact that IR scholars have largely
underestimated the technological challenges of designing, developing,
and manufacturing combat-effective military platforms.]{.underline}**23
Some scholars like Jonathan D. Caverley, Eugene Gholz, and Stephanie G.
Neuman have discussed these aspects.24 However, their contribution has
not been integrated in the literature on the diffusion of military
innovations as of yet. Second, while the IR scholarship has correctly
discussed the cultural, economic, institutional, and organizational
constraints to the adoption of military innovations, it has neglected
the material support they require.25 For example, British naval mastery
in the late nineteenth century depended on coaling bases around the
world.26 In fact, as Alfred Thayer Mahan noted, steam-powered warships
were like "land birds, unable to fly from their own shores" without
these bases.27 Similar considerations also apply to contemporary
military platforms: **[without air-to-air refuel tankers, satellite
communications, air- and sea-lift capabilities, regional commands,
operating bases, and support facilities, many military technologies are
of little or very limited utility.]{.underline}**28 THE ECOSYSTEM
CHALLENGE AND THE DIFFUSION OF MILITARY INNOVATIONS In light of the
problems of the existing IR literature, in this section we develop a
theoretical framework aimed at explaining why and when military
technology spreads easily and widely or not. Building on the ecosystem
literature in management and in particular Ron Adner's scholarship about
the innovations' ecosystem challenge, **[we argue that the successful
adoption and employment of military innovations depends on meeting the
ecosystem challenge.29 First, a country must be able to design, develop,
and manufacture a combat-effective weapon system (platform challenge).
Second, a country must also be able to provide or to ensure access to
the required infrastructural and organizational support (adoption
challenge).]{.underline}**30 We discuss these two aspects more in depth
in the following subsections. **[Platform Challenge In contrast to the
dominant consensus in IR theory, designing, developing, and
manufacturing military technology is far from easy and may actually
entail significant technological and industrial
challenges.]{.underline}** Such challenges are not constant: they are a
function, on the one hand, of the weapon systems' capabilities
(technology) and, on the other hand, of the manufacturer's knowhow and
experience (technological capacity). Technology. The challenge of
developing a weapon system depends on its specific features: **[the
higher the number of tasks it can fulfill, the wider the number of
missions it can conduct, the more severe the environmental conditions in
which it is expected to operate, and the more advanced the performance
it can achieve across a wide range of parameters (such as speed,
accuracy, or radar cross-section, just to name a few), the more
complicated its design, development, and production will be.31 First, as
the capabilities of a military platform increase, it will require a
higher number of more advanced systems, subsystems, and components.
Integrating them together and ensuring reciprocal compatibility and
systemic reliability, while maximizing the platform overall performance,
is extremely daunting. On the one hand, cutting-edge technologies
inevitably give rise to compatibility problems that are difficult to
anticipate, to understand, and to address because of a lack of
sufficient knowledge and experience.32 On the other hand, as the number
of systems, subsystems, and components grows, the integration process
becomes more complex:]{.underline}** the Lockheed Martin F-35 Lightning
II Joint Strike Fighter, for instance, features seventeen miles of
copper wiring while its software contains eight million lines of code.33
**[Minor variations from the expected ideal specification for even
marginal components (such as the weight of fasteners) can result in
severe malfunctions and possibly even in systemic
failure.]{.underline}**34 Second, anticipating, understanding, and
addressing the problems emerging from operating in demanding
environmental conditions (solar activity, temperature excursion, or
wind), as well as designing, developing, and integrating systems and
subsystems aimed at neutralizing enemy countermeasures, adds a further
layer of complexity that, inevitably, renders production more
challenging.35 Technological Capacity**[. The intensity of these
technological challenges is not constant across countries: it is a
product of a country's technological capacity to produce a given weapon
system. Such capacity depends on whether a country possesses the
necessary qualified workforce as well as an advanced technological and
industrial base (laboratories, testing and production facilities, and
accumulated experience and know-how). The degree to which such capacity
can be met, in turn, is a product of the very military technology being
developed.]{.underline}** **[The more demanding the technology is, the
more specific (that is, unique) will the required capacity be and hence
difficult to meet.]{.underline}** When the technology being developed is
relatively unsophisticated (in terms of functions, performances, and
capabilities), manufacturers can easily.

#### Drone prolif won't happen- current generation drones are open to attacks, and have significantly less capabilities then current military technology, a policy in efforts to limit drone prolif would damage possible ally relationships

What are the consequences of drone proliferation for international
security? [Despite extensive discussions in the policy world concerning
drone strikes for counterterrorism purposes, myths about the
capabilities and implications of current-generation drones often
outstrip reality. Understanding the impact of drones requires separating
fact from fiction by examining their effects in six different
contexts---counterterrorism, interstate conflict, crisis onset and
deterrence, coercive diplomacy, domestic control and repression, and use
by nonstate actors for the purposes of terrorism. Although
current-generation drones introduce some unique capabilities into
conflicts, they are unlikely to produce the dire consequences that some
analysts fear.]{.underline} In particular, drone proliferation carries
potentially significant consequences for counterterrorism operations and
domestic control in authoritarian regimes. Drones could also enhance
monitoring in disputed territories, potentially leading to greater
stability. Given their technical limitations, however,
[current-generation drones are unlikely to have a large impact on
interstate warfare. Assessing the consequences of drone proliferation
has important implications for a range of policy issues, including the
management of regional disputes, the regulation of drone exports, and
defense against potential terrorist attacks on the
homeland.]{.underline} Introduction In the last decade and a half, the
use of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), "drones," has become
commonplace.1 In response to the terrorist attacks of September 11,
2001, the United States launched its first armed drone strike in
Afghanistan in November of that year. The strike missed its intended
target---Mullah Akhund, the Taliban\'s number three in command---but
killed several others. A year later, the United States used an armed
drone to strike suspected al-Qaida members in Yemen, including Qa\'id
Salim Sinan al Harithi, who was thought to have plotted the attack
against the USS Cole in 2000, which had killed seventeen U.S. sailors.
Since then, U.S. drone strikes have grown in both geographic scope and
number, extending to Pakistan in 2004 and Somalia in 2007, and
increasing from about 50 total counterterrorism strikes from 2001 to
2008 to about 450 from 2009 to 2014.2 U.S. Secretary of Defense Leon
Panetta once understandably referred to drones as "the only game in
town" in terms of stopping al-Qaida.3 Although the United States has
been the most prolific user of combat drones, several other countries
have employed them as well, including Iraq, Israel, Nigeria, Pakistan,
and the United Kingdom. Almost a dozen states, including China, Iran,
and Saudi Arabia, reportedly now possess armed drones, and many
others---including India---are racing to acquire them. The spread of
armed drones has ignited considerable debate among scholars and
policymakers about the consequences of armed and unarmed drone
proliferation for international and regional security. One camp views
drones as an important, even transformative, military technology. Many
within this camp caution that drones lower the costs of using force to
the point of making war too easy and therefore more likely.4
Additionally, because drones have a variety of commercial applications
and because drone exports are increasing, those in this camp generally
believe that militarily-relevant drones will spread very quickly.5 Drone
proliferation, therefore, is both inevitable and highly consequential
for the international security environment. In contrast, a second camp
views drones as a nontransformative technology that replicates
capabilities that many modern militaries already possess.6 In addition,
analysts in this camp contend that the technological requirements of
sophisticated drones are beyond the reach of many countries.7
Consequently, drone proliferation is relatively insignificant for
regional and international security. This article assesses the
consequences of current-generation drone proliferation, concluding that
both of the above perspectives are misguided. Examining the effects of
UAVs in six different contexts---counterterrorism, interstate conflict,
crisis onset and deterrence, coercive diplomacy, domestic control and
repression, and use by nonstate actors for the purposes of
terrorism---we show that, although current-generation drones will
introduce some unique capabilities into conflicts around the world, they
are unlikely to produce the dire consequences that some analysts fear.
In particular, drone proliferation carries potentially significant
consequences for counterterrorism operations and domestic control in
authoritarian regimes. Drones lower the costs of using force by
eliminating the risk that pilots will be killed, making some
states---especially democracies, which may be especially casualty
sensitive---more likely to carry out targeted attacks against suspected
militants. In addition, using drones could provide autocratic leaders
with a new tool to bolster their domestic regime security.8 Yet, in
general, [current-generation drones are likely to have a minimal impact
on interstate relations. Armed or advanced unarmed drones are unlikely
to provoke international crises or incite regional
instability]{.underline}. In addition, [current-generation drones offer
little utility for coercion against other governments.]{.underline}
Contrary to the conventional wisdom, moreover, [drones might enhance
security in disputed border regions by providing states with a greater
ability to monitor contested regions persistently at lower cost.
Monitoring can help to reassure states that potential adversaries are
not attempting to change the status quo through force]{.underline}. The
limited significance of current-generation drones in interstate contexts
beyond monitoring stems from a key technological limitation: drones
currently in operation are vulnerable to air defense systems, so they
are much less likely to be effective when operating in hostile
airspace.9 The stakes in the debate about drone proliferation are
significant. For example, if drone proliferation is inherently
dangerous, the United States should be leery of other states acquiring
drones, especially armed drones. [The United States should therefore
attempt to limit drone proliferation, including through its own exports.
Such a policy might reduce drone proliferation, but it could have
**adverse consequences for the U.S. industrial base, while causing
Washington to miss opportunities to build capacity among allies.**
Alternatively, if current-generation drones are no different from, and
less capable than, other comparable conventional military technologies,
the United States should be less concerned with the effect of drone
proliferation on the regional and international security
environment.]{.underline} The article proceeds as follows. First, we
contextualize the drone debate by discussing ongoing trends in drone
proliferation. Second, we describe in more detail the core arguments
made by the two camps concerning the military and political effects of
drones. Third, we lay out our main claim that the reality is more
complicated than either of these two perspectives suggests.
Fundamentally, current-generation drone proliferation will likely have
heterogeneous consequences, being more influential in the context of
counterterrorism and intrastate conflict than interstate conflict. In
the fourth section, we argue that the consequences of drone
proliferation could change dramatically with technological advancements
over time. We conclude by identifying some of the national security
implications for the United States. Trends in Drone Proliferation
Unmanned aircraft have a rich history in world politics.10 The 1849
Italian War of Independence and the American Civil War, for example,
featured the use of unmanned balloons. In World War I, the United States
tested the Kettering Bug, a "self-flying aerial torpedo" that, driven by
wind, released its bomb onto the target. The war ended, however, before
the aircraft became operational.11 During World War II, the United
Kingdom and the United States developed target drones, and Germany
commissioned a project to develop an unmanned vehicle for combat, which
resulted in the V-1. The V-1, however, was more of an early cruise
missile than a drone.12 The 1960 U-2 incident, in which American pilot
Francis Gary Powers was shot down over the Soviet Union, catalyzed
further work on drones to try to reduce the vulnerability of pilots.13
The United States used Firebee UAVs to conduct frequent surveillance
missions during the Vietnam War, and Israel used drones in the 1982
Lebanon War to locate targets that piloted aircraft later destroyed.14
The United States deployed the unarmed Predator for surveillance in the
1990s Balkans war, but moved to arm the aircraft only after the
September 11 attacks, when it deployed Predators with Hellfire missiles
in Afghanistan.15 Although the Predator and its successor, the Reaper,
are armed and can travel long distances at medium altitude to strike
targets, most drones fielded by militaries around the world are tactical
and unarmed; they can fly for only a few hours at a time and are
designed exclusively to provide local surveillance data.16 Of the nearly
ninety countries that now have military drones of some kind, the
majority do not yet possess armed and advanced drones. Still, the number
of states with those capabilities is growing. According to Matthew
Fuhrmann and Michael Horowitz, by the end of 2014, twenty-seven
countries possessed "advanced" drones, defined as UAVs that can stay in
the air for at least twenty hours, operate at an altitude of at least
16,000 feet, and have a maximum takeoff weight of at least 1,320
pounds.17 In addition, seven countries possessed armed drones, and
nearly two dozen others had programs in place to acquire a lethal UAV
capability. Advanced unarmed and armed drones continued to spread
internationally in 2015 and 2016. The United States agreed to arm
Italy\'s previously unarmed Reapers; it also agreed to sell unarmed
Reapers to Spain and the Netherlands; and several European states began
a new joint armed drone program that seems more likely to succeed than
prior joint efforts.18 In 2015, Iraq, Nigeria, and Pakistan used armed
drones in combat for the first time---against domestic insurgents.19 All
three of these states acquired their armed drones from China, a country
that has solidified its role as a global provider of armed drones.20 In
addition, after using unarmed surveillance drones in Kashmir and
witnessing Pakistan\'s use of armed drones, India sought armed UAVs from
the United States.21 It also reached a deal with Israel to acquire the
Heron, a drone capable of conducting air strikes.22 The capabilities of
current-generation armed drones vary considerably. Most armed UAVs lack
the capabilities of the U.S. Predator or Reaper, which, combined with
data processing and logistical capacity, give the United States the
ability to conduct drone strikes around the world. Other armed drones,
such as variants of the Chinese CH-3 or Wing Loong, may lack global
positioning system (GPS) integration or over-the-horizon strike
capabilities, and thus have limited reach. In addition, an armed CH-3
can reportedly remain in the air for about six hours, or less than half
as long as the U.S. Reaper can, and its range is just 250 kilometers.
Moreover, it can carry only two missiles, or half of the payload of the
Reaper.23 Even less capable armed drones have military relevance,
however. [Consider the Pakistani Buraaq, which many analysts believe is
a variant of China\'s CH-3, the same system used by Nigeria. The
Pakistan government\'s intended use for this platform is either within
Pakistan or against India, so the platform\'s relatively short endurance
and range are less limiting than they might be for the United States,
whose stated operational demands are more expansive.]{.underline}
Additionally, in combination with other military assets, including
manned aircraft, [a country can extend the "reach" of its drones even
without GPS integration]{.underline}. [Unarmed, short-range
drones]{.underline} may [have military relevance as well]{.underline};
[they can increase a state\'s monitoring abilities and provide greater
situational awareness.]{.underline} Because most interstate disputes
occur between neighbors, [states\' primary security concerns often
involve surveillance or limited military actions across relatively
shorter distances. Armed and unarmed drones **without global reach** are
thus sufficient for most national military requirements.]{.underline} In
sum, militarily relevant drones are spreading widely, though the most
advanced drones remain beyond the reach of many countries, a trend that
likely will continue in the short term. The logistical challenges for
longer-range drone operations are daunting even for a country such as
the United States. Given these challenges, it is unlikely that many
states will use drones the way the United States sometimes does for
global strike operations. Two Narratives on Drone Proliferation What are
the implications, if any, of drones and drone proliferation for the
international security environment? Two competing narratives dominate
debates about drone proliferation, with cleavages emerging based on
divergent assumptions about the inherent nature of the technology. We
sketch the core arguments here to illustrate the competing claims. Our
discussion reflects the broad contours of the debate, but it is
important to note that arguments lumped in the same camp may be
analytically distinct. A TRANSFORMATIVE TECHNOLOGY Many analysts and
policymakers argue that drones will transform warfare in the
twenty-first century. Scholars and journalists in this camp routinely
describe drones as a revolutionary military technology. As Adam Stulberg
wrote in 2007, "It is now conventional wisdom that we stand at the
dawning of the unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) revolution in military
affairs."24 More recently, Amy Zegart stated: "Drones are going to
revolutionize how nations and nonstate actors threaten the use of
violence."25 From the above perspective, drones are revolutionary
because they lower the costs of using military force. In his annual
report on extrajudicial, summary, or arbitrary executions, United
Nations special rapporteur Christof Heyns noted that "drones make it not
only physically easier to dispatch long-distance and targeted armed
force, but the proliferation of drones may lower social barriers in
society against the deployment of lethal force and result in attempts to
weaken the relevant legal standards."26 Drones change decisionmaking
because they do not inherently risk the life and limb of the user.27
States with armed drones can conduct strikes without risking the lives
of their pilots. This capability is particularly useful when governments
fear the domestic political or diplomatic consequences of taking
military action that could result in casualties. Moreover, drone strikes
often involve secrecy and therefore shield leaders from domestic
blowback. As U.S. President Barack Obama said in May 2013, the typical
decisionmaking barriers to the use of force become eroded when using
drones because they do not attract "the public scrutiny that a troop
deployment invites."28 By lowering the political threshold for using
force, this argument suggests, drones make states more willing to deploy
their military assets. Military deployments, in turn, make the use of
lethal force more likely. Proponents of this view (though not
necessarily of the uses of force themselves) cite the prevalence of U.S.
drone strikes in countries such as Pakistan, Somalia, and Yemen, arguing
that the United States would have used military force less frequently in
these countries if it did not have drones at its disposal.29 Lowering
the threshold for military deployments also includes the use of unarmed
drones such as surveillance aircraft that may be more likely to
transgress an adversary\'s airspace because they can do so at a lower
cost. The second-order effect of deploying even unarmed surveillance
drones is that other countries may be more willing to shoot down drones
than manned aircraft, which some analysts worry could cause tense
situations to escalate.30 Some analysts therefore conclude that drones
will be destabilizing for the security environment. As Michael Boyle
argues, "\[T\]he race for this technology is resetting the terms of
global competition and quietly altering the rules of the game for many
long-simmering conflicts and rivalries."31 In this view, drone
proliferation has mostly undesirable consequences for international
security, and the rapid diffusion of armed and advanced drones around
the globe may exacerbate this destabilizing tendency.32 Drones are the
tip of the spear for the spread of robotics writ large, a commercially
driven enterprise that renders many key components of drones as
fundamentally dual-use technologies.33 Although many countries may find
state-of-the-art armed drones hard to operate, continuing technological
advances eventually will make it easier for them to do so, just as they
have with other military technologies, such as combat aircraft. For all
of these reasons, armed drone proliferation is an important
international security issue from this perspective. JUST ANOTHER
PLATFORM A second camp questions whether current-generation drones will
transform how states conduct military operations, and whether UAVs will
fundamentally increase the mobility or destructive power of armed
forces.34 Drones can be used to carry out targeted strikes, but states
may also carry out targeted killings through other means, such as manned
F-16 strikes or, in the case of the raid that ended with the death of
Osama bin Laden, Special Operations forces. In this view, UAVs are just
another platform that militaries may employ to achieve an objective.35
As Canada\'s chief of staff, Gen. Thomas Lawson, said in 2013: "If a
kinetic round is propelled toward a confirmed enemy for strategic
purposes by a rifle, by an artillery piece, by an aircraft manned, or an
aircraft unmanned, any of those that end up with a desired effect is a
supportable point of view."36 Scholars and policymakers in this camp
suggest that the policy of targeted killing is more important than the
technology used to carry out strikes. Charli Carpenter, for example,
argues that, to the extent that one is concerned about drone strikes
violating international law, the problem is U.S. policy.37 Drones are
merely the delivery system, which could just as easily be a soldier or
manned aircraft. Some current and former policymakers have expressed a
similar view. In his memoirs, former U.S. Secretary of Defense Panetta
states: "\[T\]o call our campaign against Al Qaeda a 'drone program' is
a little like calling World War I a 'machine gun program.' Technology
has always been an aspect of war ... what is most crucial is not the
size of the missile or the ability to deploy it from thousands of miles
away" but how the munitions are used.38 In 2012 Gen. Norton Schwartz,
chief of staff of the U.S. Air Force, stated that "if it is a legitimate
target, then I would argue that the manner in which you engage that
target, whether it be close combat or remotely, is not a terribly
relevant question."39 What militaries do, in this view, is more
significant than how they do it. Drones themselves are not especially
unique, even if the way in which the United States has employed this
technology after the September 11 attacks is novel. Proponents of this
perspective point out that current-generation drones have significant
technological limitations, which we discuss in greater detail below.
Because they fly at low altitudes and slow speeds, for instance, drones
are highly vulnerable to enemy air defenses. In light of these
limitations, drones have little utility in interstate
disputes---especially compared to technologies such as nuclear weapons.
As the authors of a 2014 RAND report put it, "By themselves, armed UAVs
do not win wars, and wars can be won without them."40 Drones may have
aided U.S. operations against the Taliban, for instance, but they have
not helped the United States achieve a decisive victory. According to
those in this camp, given the technological limitations discussed above,
the effects of drone diffusion on the international security environment
are likely to be modest. In addition, some scholars question the notion
that armed drones will spread at a rapid rate. Andrea Gilli and Mauro
Gilli, for instance, argue that armed drones are expensive and difficult
to buy, build, and operate.41 Referencing the massive logistical support
that the United States requires to conduct drone strikes---including
forward operating bases in far-flung places in Central Asia and the Horn
of Africa42---they argue that few other countries will be able to
acquire and use armed drones as expansively.43 This is yet another
reason that concerns about the consequences of drone proliferation are
overblown, these scholars contend. The Advantages and Limitations of
Drones Neither of the above perspectives is complete. Those who argue
that drones are transformative overlook important operational limits.
The more dismissive view, by contrast, fails to appreciate how [removing
pilots from aircraft changes the decisionmaking calculus of using drones
versus manned alternatives. Missing from the current debate about the
consequences of drone proliferation is a realistic understanding of what
today\'s drones can and cannot do. Accurately capturing the capabilities
of current-generation drones is critical to understanding how drones may
(or may not) change military affairs or world politics more
generally.]{.underline} We take up this task in the following sections.
WHY DRONES ARE NOT A SILVER BULLET Some observers may view drones as a
panacea for many national security challenges that could involve the use
of force. Current-generation drones have at least five serious
limitations, however. First, as noted previously, [drones fly
significantly slower than manned aircraft]{.underline} (the cruise speed
of an F-16 is about six times that of a Reaper). One U.S. Air Force
general therefore described even the [most advanced current-generation
drones as "useless in a contested environment"]{.underline}44 (i.e., in
a scenario where the United States is fighting an adversary with air
defenses). Countries with anti-air defense systems are well positioned
to shoot down the slow-moving drones. [Hamas discovered this in 2014
when it flew what it referred to as an armed drone---though it was very
rudimentary---into Israel, only to have the drone shot
down.]{.underline}45 Second[, the data link that connects drones to
remote pilots creates a potential vulnerability, because it introduces
the risk of jamming, hacking, and spoofing.]{.underline}46 [Smaller
drones must be linked by radio to their controllers, and the data links
can be easily jammed and disabled. One study showed how hackers could
mimic GPS signals and fool the navigation systems.47 **Cyber attacks**
could cause a drone, at the least, to be unable to calculate its
position, allowing it to be brought down fairly easily. Responding to
these vulnerabilities, the U.S. Defense Department has developed a
software program designed to prevent the hacking of drone control and
navigation systems.48]{.underline} Third, [current-generation drones do
not possess air-to-air capabilities or countermeasures]{.underline}. The
U-2, a manned reconnaissance platform, has sophisticated countermeasures
to defend against Russian-made air defense systems such as the S-300.
The Global Hawk, the unmanned equivalent, lacks these countermeasures.49
Upgrades that would bring the Global Hawk\'s air defense system to a
level of rough parity with the U-2s would cost \$1.9 billion over ten
years, reducing the hourly-usage-cost advantage of the Global Hawk over
the U-2.50 Fourth, [UAVs duplicate many of the features of other systems
that advanced militaries already possess, including fighters,
helicopters, and other related systems. Thus, in only a limited number
of operational circumstances do drones provide unique operational
capacity. For example, even though the use of Hellfire missiles by the
Reaper receives considerable media attention, the manned Apache
helicopter fires more Hellfire missiles per year than any other platform
in the U.S. military.]{.underline} In general, helicopters, ballistic
missiles, and manned aircraft can perform many of the same functions as
current-generation armed drones, and they are less vulnerable to
anti-air defense systems. China\'s manned JH-7, for example, is more
maneuverable and able to defend itself than the CH-4 armed drone.
Additionally, compared to the CH-4, the JH-7 has a much larger payload
and holds heavier bombs. The U.S. manned A-10 is more effective for
close air support---eliminating ground troops at close range---than the
MQ-9 Reaper, because it flies low and is reinforced with titanium to
protect it from ground fire.51 Fifth[, the ubiquitous deployment of
drones in a conventional conflict is potentially limited by the
difficulty of retaining pilots to guide them]{.underline}.52 Operators
sit behind consoles for long shifts, putting in thirteen to fourteen
hour days and logging about three to four times as many flight hours as
pilots of manned aircraft, about 900--1,100 compared to 200--300 flight
hours per year.53 The long hours in front of a console create a "mix of
boredom, loneliness, and stress,"54 sometimes resulting in high levels
of post-traumatic stress as operators develop a sense of familiarity
with the targets whom they may be responsible for killing. Thus,
[despite having been trained at rates far higher than fighter and bomber
pilots combined, drone pilots have left the service at three times the
rate of those operating manned aircraft. As a result, the U.S.
Government Accountability Office reported in 2014 that the Air Force had
only 85 percent of the drone pilots needed to carry out its missions.55
In 2015, the figure dropped to 65 percent,56 with about 1,000
active-duty pilots]{.underline}. One source suggests that although the
U.S. Air Force trains 180 drone pilots a year, it loses another 240 to
attrition.[57 If these challenges exist for the United
States,]{.underline} the country with the most extensive pilot training
system in the world[, they very likely exist for others as
well.]{.underline} THE UNIQUE FEATURES OF DRONES Despite their
limitations, drones can still have important battlefield consequences.
Indeed, the perspective that suggests that drones are just another
platform, substitutable with manned airborne or ground equivalents,
glosses over some key advantages of drones. As discussed earlier, one
obvious benefit is that drones operate without a pilot in the cockpit.
States with armed drones can conduct strikes without risking the lives
of their forces, thus minimizing casualties. At the same time,
current-generation drones---manned and unmanned---operate most
effectively in permissive airspace, where there is a relatively low risk
of being shot down. The reduction in casualty risk afforded by UAVs
nonetheless has implications for the way in which many
actors---especially in democracies---think about the use of military
force. Precisely because drones reduce the cost of war in terms of
casualties, they risk creating a sense of distance from the conflict,
which the philosopher Immanuel Kant warned could remove important checks
on the use of force.58 As Kant put it, "\[I\]f the consent of the
citizens is required in order to decide that war should be declared ...
nothing is more natural than that they would be very cautious in
commencing such a poor game, decreeing for themselves all the calamities
of war. Among the latter would be: having to fight, having to pay the
costs of war from their own resources."59 As scholars who study the
constraints faced by democracies in war observe, when citizens bear the
direct burdens of war, in part through incurring casualties, they
pressure leaders to be more selective about the wars that they fight.60
The use of drones remains popular among the U.S. public, allowing it to
conduct counterterrorism strikes without producing U.S. military
casualties. Levels of support in the United States for U.S. use of UAVs
from 2011 to 2014 hovered around 65 percent.61 Given the responsiveness
of democratic legislatures to public attitudes,62 reducing the risk to
soldiers may also loosen legislative constraints on the use of force.
With foreign interventions, in general, Congress has incentives to grant
the executive latitude in deciding when to use force. The reason is
simple: legislators receive little credit for foreign policy actions
that go well and get the blame for those that do not.63 Congressional
opposition has therefore been limited to isolated cases of members who
are concerned not with the overall policy but rather with the prospect
of the United States using drones to target its own citizens. Senator
Rand Paul cited the potential of drones to target U.S. citizens in
attempting to delay the confirmation of John Brennan as director of
central intelligence in 2013 with a parliamentary procedure known as the
filibuster, arguing that Americans should first be found guilty of a
crime before being executed.64 Second, and perhaps more significantly,
drones have operational advantages, because they allow for sustained and
persistent flights over potential targets. The existing U.S. arsenal of
armed drones---primarily the Predator and Reaper---can remain aloft,
fully loaded with munitions, for more than fourteen hours, compared with
four hours or fewer for F-16 fighter jets and A-10 ground attack
aircraft.65 Naval air platforms such as the F-18 E/F have an effective
mission time of slightly more than two hours.66 These systems can be
refueled in the air, but that requires more resources and does not
address the fundamental constraint arising from the limits of human
endurance. These advantages could be magnified in some next-generation
systems. For example, the efficient electronic motors and long wingspan
of the SolarEagle, a solar-powered drone that Boeing and the Defense
Advanced Research Projects Agency are developing, will allow the
aircraft to remain in the air for five years, making it a possible
replacement for satellites that are costly to both develop and
maintain.67 Next-generation armed UAVs at the high end, such as the U.S.
Navy\'s recently scrapped Unmanned Carrier-Launched Airborne
Surveillance and Strike (UCLASS) program, could have flight times
ranging from six to twelve hours, though they could have air-to-air
refueling capabilities and be able to carry a weapons load similar to
that of an F-18.68 The ability of UAVs to "loiter," to fly slowly over a
small area, offers clear advantages in terms of identifying and engaging
targets. Greater endurance enhances situational awareness, such that UAV
pilots can more carefully verify targets than an attack aircraft pilot
with mere seconds to accomplish the same objective.69 The ability to
divert missiles launched from a UAV in response to changes on the
ground, combined with the UAV\'s greater overall situational awareness,
makes UAV strikes more likely to be accurate than strikes by alternative
platforms at the same targets.70 Lastly, drones might reduce the
diplomatic fallout associated with the use of force. In particular,
drones allow the country flying them to maintain some semblance of
diplomatic cover given that the pilots are thousands of miles away
rather than directly flying overhead. Although countries such as
Pakistan sometimes publicly protest about drones operating above their
territory, such complaints are most likely displays of domestic
political theater.71 As a number of sources suggest, Pakistan has
approved foreign drone strikes on its territory; indeed, the high
frequency of such strikes suggests that at least tacit approval would
have been essential.72 Yet drones give the government conducting the
strikes greater plausible deniability than alternatives such as ground
forces, which require a considerable logistical footprint, or manned
aircraft. The amount of diplomatic cover that drones provide obviously
has limits---a CH-4 with a Chinese flag painted on its side is still a
Chinese military platform---but the belief that drones provide some
degree of diplomatic cover could make countries more likely to use them.
In sum, [current-generation drones have unique political, operational,
and diplomatic advantages, all else equal, and those advantages could
make it easier for states to use force in some settings. These
advantages point to an important corrective of the perspective that
maintains that drones are just another platform and therefore do not in
and of themselves shape how states are likely to consider using
force.]{.underline} The Strategic Consequences of Drone Proliferation
Given the preceding discussion, what are the strategic consequences of
drone proliferation? It depends. Drones may be transformative in some
contexts but not others. In this section, we assess [the impact of drone
proliferation in six contexts: (1) counterterrorism; (2) interstate
conflict; (3) crisis onset and deterrence; (4) coercive diplomacy; (5)
civil war and domestic conflict; and (6) operations by nonstate actors.
Research on the strategic effects of military technology identifies
these particular contexts as potentially salient.73 We therefore focus
our attention on them here, recognizing that they are by no means the
only areas in which drones might matter.]{.underline}74 As the following
analysis shows, the [effects of drone proliferation are heterogeneous.
Current-generation drones are likely to be consequential for
counterterrorism and domestic conflict, but less transformative in most
other settings.]{.underline}

#### Policies to stop selling drones are ineffective and fail to consider the dual use problem

[The controversy surrounding military drones has generated many
proposals for restricting or prohibiting existing drones, additional
autonomous variants that may be created in the future, and the sale of
drones to certain markets. Moreover, there is broad interest in
regulating military drones, with proposals coming not only from
academics but also from NGOs and policymakers. I argue that these
proposals generally **fail to consider the dual-use character of
drones** and that they therefore provide inadequate regulatory guidance.
Drones are not confined to the military but rather spread across
international and domestic security roles, humanitarian re- lief
efforts, and dozens of civilian applications. Drones, their component
technologies, the control infrastructure, and the relevant technical
exper- tise would continue to develop under a military-focused
regulatory regime as civilian technologies that have the potential to be
militarized]{.underline}. I evaluate the prospects of drone regulation
with the help of research on other dual- use technologies, while also
showing what the study of drones can con- tribute to that literature.
Drones' ubiquity in nonmilitary roles presents special regulatory
challenges beyond those associated with WMDs and mis- siles, which
indicates that strict regulatory controls or international gover- nance
frameworks are unlikely to succeed. With this in mind, I further argue
that future research should acknowledge that drone proliferation across
military and civilian spheres is unavoidable and shift focus to con-
sidering how drone warfare may be moderated by countermeasures and
institutional pressures. Keywords: Drones, security, weapons
Introduction [The dual-use problem]{.underline}, which arises when the
same commodities can be used in weapons or in peaceful civilian
applications[, is a challenge for research on inter- national security
and international trade that brings these fields into dialogue with each
other and forces us to make tradeoffs between economic, humanitarian,
and security goal]{.underline}s (Fuhrmann 2008). "Most of the components
of major weapons sys- tems are dual use in nature" (Fuhrmann 2012, xi),
making it difficult to prevent the spread of weapons technologies
without also impinging on legitimate trade or even interfering with the
acquisition of goods that have vital peacetime bene- fits. Further
complicating the dual-use problem is that the knowledge and material 2
Drone Proliferation [infrastructure acquired from civilian programs can
provide the foundation for later efforts to build weapons. Most of the
research on dual-use technologies focuses on weapons of mass destruction
(WMDs) and ballistic missiles]{.underline} (Mistry 2003; Busch and
Joyner 2009; Stinnett et al. 2011; Fuhrmann 2012; Tucker 2012b), [but
the prolifer- ation of drones over the past decade presents a new
regulatory puzzle with distinct challenges that must be considered to
advance the study of dual-use technologies and, in particular, research
on drones. Drones have the potential to alter how and when wars are
fought, especially when it comes to asymmetric conflicts]{.underline}
(Horowitz, Kreps, and Fuhrmann 2016). [By allow- ing their users to
strike from a distance and avoid the risks associated with deploy- ing
human combatants on the battlefield, drones arguably lower the threshold
for using lethal force and make it easier to escape accountability for
use-of-force deci- sions]{.underline} (Kreps and Kaag 2012; Sauer and
Schörnig 2012; Enemark 2013; Kaag and Kreps 2014; Chamayou 2015). Drone
variants operating in other roles or those with higher degrees of
autonomy raise still more worries, including the prospect that
autonomous machines may one day be able to kill independently (Sparrow
2007; Krishnan 2009; Tonkens 2013; Schulzke 2013). Concerned academics,
policymak- ers, and activists have proposed a range of regulatory
mechanisms to curtail the use of UAVs and the development of new drone
models (Altman 2013; Zenko and Kreps 2014; Boyle 2013; Buchanan and
Keohane 2015; Sparrow 2016). However, these ef- forts suffer from a
serious defect: they assume a sharp division between military and
civilian technologies. [Research on the dual-use problem must address a
larger range of innovations, take a broader conception of dual-use that
includes software and finished products in addition to the component
parts that are typically the object of study, and recog- nize the
importance of cultural and normative shifts that may alter attitudes
toward dual-use goods. At the same time, the study of drone regulation
should be situated within the research on dual-use technologies and
weapons regulation. Research on military drones is usually limited to
machines that are designed with explicit mili- tary functions, and even
here the focus is on machines that are armed, rather than on the many
types of unarmed military drones.]{.underline} Conversely, research on
drones and autonomous systems in civilian roles, such as in cars,
proceeds without much com- ment on how these could impact the future of
international security (Meier 2015). [Looking at the dual-use character
of drones exposes the unrecognized challenges inherent in existing
regulatory proposals, while also offering opportunities for re- thinking
how future research could be more profitably framed.]{.underline} Drones
pose several regulatory challenges that go beyond those coming from the
dual-use goods associated with WMDs and ballistic missiles or even those
re- lated to more conventional military hardware[. First, drones are
dual-use in a more expansive sense than how this term is generally used.
Most efforts to restrict dual- use technologies focus on the component
parts of weapons, while treating final products as being military or
civilian in their function. Drones are dual-use, both when it comes to
their constitutive parts and when it comes to the final products,
because machines produced for nonmilitary security roles or the
commercial mar- ket can be transformed into weapons or vice versa, often
with little modification. Second, the market for drones is so vast,
heterogeneous, and conducive to civil- military technology sharing that
it is open to a more diverse array of actors than other dual-use
markets. This increases the possible routes of technology sharing,
thereby raising additional regulatory challenges. The diversity of drone
models also introduces formidable difficulties when it comes to defining
the scope of regula- tions. Broadening restrictions in response to this
challenge would improve the like- lihood of successfully curtailing the
proliferation of military drones but would come at the expense of
increasing the costs of restrictions and the incentives for defec- tion.
Third, the pervasiveness of drones and related technologies in civilian
life, as well as their usefulness in humanitarian roles, could cause
cultural shifts beyond those associated with dual-use goods that are
less visible in civilian life. Finally, one of the central problems for
proponents of drone restrictions is the effort to pre- vent the
development of autonomous drones that could select and engage targets by
themselves or with limited human oversight. Regulatory efforts might
therefore have to focus on software in addition to
hardware.]{.underline} I argue that [ambitious projects to]{.underline}
severely [constrain or even prevent military drone proliferation are
**untenable** because they cannot cope with the dual-use prob-
lem.]{.underline} [Future research would benefit from exploring more
modest efforts to slow the pace of technological diffusion. Although
drones are potentially revolutionary weapons platforms, the impact of
current generation drones has been limited be- cause they are fairly
unsophisticated compared to manned vehicles and because they are
vulnerable to countermeasures]{.underline} (Horowitz, Kreps, and
Fuhrmann 2016). This suggests that [drones present a security risk that
can be managed so long as the machines do not advance too
quickly.]{.underline} [Restrictions that are designed to moderate the
pace of development,]{.underline} rather than stopping it entirely or
creating elaborate over- [sight mechanisms that states would have little
incentive to support, could make it possible to realize the benefits of
drones while still affording the time needed to de- velop effective
countermeasures for those that are directed into military purposes. Such
restrained diffusion would not prevent drone proliferation, but it would
have the advantage of being an easier point of compromise between the
many private and public actors that would need to coordinate to limit
the industry. Subsequent research on drone regulation would be best
served by looking for ways of managing drone proliferation across
military and civilian roles so that it does not dramati- cally upset the
balance of military forces. It is particularly important to give more
thought to the role of antidrone countermeasures and to institutional
pressures that may slow the adoption of drones in military
roles.]{.underline}
