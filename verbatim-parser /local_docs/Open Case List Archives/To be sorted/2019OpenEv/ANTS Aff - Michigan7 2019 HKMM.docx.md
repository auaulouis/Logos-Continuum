# Actor-Network Theory Aff---HKMM

### Notes

Shout out to Adi Kombathula, Eshan Manchanda, Joelle Fahoum, Nicole
Doris, and Sam Ring for picking up an incredibly complex literature base
and turning it into a pretty high quality and tricky aff.

You can read a plan/advocacy statement if you want; this aff was
designed to defend the general idea that arms sales/arms in general are
bad, particularly lethal autonomous weapons systems (or "LAWS" for
short---**when the file says "LAWS" in all caps, it's talking about
killer robots, it's not just being really aggressive about the law**);
however, if you don't want to defend that and just want to defend that
thinking about how guns are people (they're just bad people), you can do
that too.

This aff can be summarized as such: The only thing that can stop a bad
guy with a gun is a good gun with a guy---but there are no good guns
left.

Alternatively, this does a good job too:

#### We begin with a thought experiment: imagine yourself as a [robot historian]{.underline}, reading the resolution as a history of its weapon-ancestors. Dwelling in the perplexity of this thought experiment activates our capacity for novel political experimentation. Which weapons should have been restricted? Which weapons helped our future robot species evolve as they were developed and used? And if these questions aren't completely resolvable, what can we learn from that impasse?

This is, in outline, the subject matter that will be explored in this
book. There is, however, another, less obvious agenda here. [For
computers have not only become powerful instruments of oppression in the
hands of military and paramilitary agencies]{.underline} : [they have
also opened new windows onto the creative processes of
nature]{.underline}·. In the last thirty years, for instance, [computers
have allowed scientists to investigate the mathematical foundations of
natural processes of self-organization]{.underline}. These are
[processes in which order emerges spontaneously out of
chaos]{.underline}. [Certain natural phenomena]{.underline} [once
thought to lack any structure,]{.underline} like the turbulent flow of a
fast-moving liquid, [have now been found to possess an extremely
intricate molecular organization]{.underline}. Because the coordination
of billions of molecules needed to produce eddies and vortices in a
fluid appears suddenly and without any apparent cause, turbulence is now
regarded as a process of self-organization . Similarly, [certain
chemical phenomena once thought to be unrealizable in nature, like the
spontaneous assembly of \"chemical clocks]{.underline}\" (chemical
reactions that follow perfect oscillatory rhythms or cycles), have now
been found to be an essential component of the machinery of the planet.
[The self-organizing processes]{.underline} studied by the science [of
\"order out of chaos\"]{.underline} (or \"chaos,\" for short) have
indeed changed the way scientists view inorganic matter. [While at one
time only biological phenomena were considered to be relevant for a
study of evolution]{.underline}, [now inert matter has been found to be
capable of generating structures that may be subjected to natural
selection]{.underline}. It is as if we had discovered [a form of
\"non-organic life]{.underline}.\" With this in mind, I have borrowed
from the philosopher Gilles Deleuze the concept of the \"[machinic
phylum,]{.underline}\" the term he coined to refer to the overall set of
self-organizing processes in the universe. These [include all processes
in which a group of previously disconnected elements suddenly reaches a
critical point at which they begin to \"cooperate\" to form a higher
level entity]{.underline}. To provide a clearer idea of what these
processes of spontaneous "cooperative behavior\" are, consider a few
examples: the individual spin of atoms in a metal \"cooperate\" to make
the metal magnetic; the individual molecules in a chemical reaction
\"cooperate\" to create the perfectly rhythmic patterns of a chemical
clock; the cells making up an amoeba colony \"cooperate\" under certain
conditions to assemble an organism with differentiated organs; and the
different termites in a colony \"cooperate\" to build a nest. On the
face of it, [there would be no reason to assume that processes as
different as these could be related at a deeper level.]{.underline} But
[recent advances in experimental mathematics have shown that the onset
of all these processes may be described by essentially the same
mathematical model]{.underline}. It is as if [the
principles]{.underline} that guide the self-assembly [of these
\"machines]{.underline}\" (e.g., chemical clocks, multicellular
organisms or n.est-building insect colonie.s ) [are at some deep level
essentially similar.]{.underline} [This conclusion]{.underline}, that
behind self-organization there is a \"machinic phylum,\" that behind the
spontaneous emergence of order out of chaos there are deep mathematical
similarities[, would hardly escape the notice of our hypothetical robot
historian]{.underline}. After all, the emergence of \"[robot
consciousness\" could have been the result of such a process of
self-organization]{.underline}. Such processes, as we will see, have in
fact been observed in large computer networks (and in small neural
nets). Furthermore, **[the notion of a machinic phylum blurs the
distinction between organic and non-organic life]{.underline}**, which
is just what a robot historian would like to do. From its point of view,
as we have seen, [humans would have served only as machines\' surrogate
reproductive organs until robots acquired their own self-replication
capabilities]{.underline}. But both human and robot bodies would
ultimately be related to a common phylogenetic line : the machinic
phylum. [Order emerges out of chaos, the robot would notice, only at
certain critical points in the flow of matter and energy: when a
critical point in the concentration of a chemical is reached, the
termite colony .becomes a "nestbuilding]{.underline}\" machine; when
available food reaches a ( minimum) critical value, the amoebas
self-assemble into an organism ; [when critical points in the rate of
reaction and diffusion are reached]{.underline}, molecules spontaneously
come together to form a chemical clock; and at a critical point in
speed, the random flow of a moving liquid gives way to the intricately
ordered patterns of turbulence. [Robotic, or machinic, history would
stress the role of these thresholds (]{.underline}of speed, temperature,
pressure, chemical concentration, electric charge) [in the development
of technology]{.underline}. **[Human artisans would be pictured as
tapping into the resources of self-organizing processes in order to
create particular lineages of technology]{.underline}**. [The robot
historian would see a gunsmith]{.underline}, for instance, [as
\"tracking\" those critical points in metals and
explosives]{.underline}, [and channeling the processes that are
spontaneously set into motion to form a particular weapon
technology.]{.underline} A gunsmith must track and exploit the melting
points of various metals as well as their points of crystallization.
These two are critical points in temperature. [He must also determine
the critical point of pressure at which black powder explodes, the
detonation point of fulminates and the threshold of spin after which a
rotating bullet acquires coherent aerodynamic capabilities]{.underline}.
[It is as if humans]{.underline} (and evolution in general) [selected a
few of those critical points at the onset of self-organization, and
channeled them into a particular]{.underline} (natural or artificial)
[technology]{.underline}. Just as we see the animal kingdom as the place
where evolution \"experimented\" to create our own sensory and
locomotive machinery, so [our robot historian would see processes in
which order emerges out of chaos as its own true ancestors]{.underline},
[with human artisans playing the role of historically necessary
\"channelers\" for the machinic phylum\'s \'\'creativity]{.underline}.\"
Still, it is easier to say what the [machinic phylum]{.underline} is
not, than to specify precisely what it is. It [is not a life-force,
since the phylum is older than life, and yet it constitutes a form of
non-organic life]{.underline}. [It is not an eternal reservoir of
platonic essences either, since]{.underline}, it will be argued, [the
machinic phylum is assembled piecemeal in evolutionary and historical
time.]{.underline} Furthermore, the effects set into motion when a
particular critical point is reached are not always \"creative\" in any
obvious sense. For instance, a turbulent flow is made out of a hierarchy
of eddies and vortices nested inside more eddies and vortices. This
complicated organization is what allows a turbulent flow to maintain its
pattern : [it takes energy from its surroundings, channeling and
dissipating it through this system of nested eddies]{.underline}. But
the same processes that allow this form of internal order to emerge as
if from nowhere, cause external disorder : turbulence in a flow will
cause a great amount of drag on anything moving through that flow.
Similarly, [the exquisite internal structure of turbulent weather
phenomena]{.underline} (hurricanes, for example) [are instances of order
emerging out of chaos]{.underline}. But we are all familiar with the
destruction that [hurricanes]{.underline} can bring about in their
surroundings. They [are a form of spontaneously emerging order, created
at critical points in atmospheric flow, while at the same time they are
a source of apparent disorder for other systems]{.underline}. [We find a
similar situation]{.underline} when we move (by analogy) to other forms
of turbulence [affecting warfare]{.underline} directly : [the
demographic turbulence produced by migrations, invasions or
crusades,]{.underline} for example. [Critical points in the growth of
the urban masses are known to have played a role in triggering wars
throughout modern history]{.underline}. [Whether we consider demographic
pressures as having \"creative\" or \"destructive\" effects will depend
on our point of view.]{.underline} [They are creative to the extent that
they influence the assembly of armies and of war-related
technology]{.underline}, [but destructive in their ultimate
consequences]{.underline}. Similarly, after a certain critical point is
reached in the number of computers connected to a network ( a threshold
of connectivity), [the network itself becomes capable of spontaneously
generating computational processes not planned by its
designers]{.underline}. For instance, in many computer. networks ( like
the ARPANET, discussed in Chapter One), there is not a central computer
handling the traffic of messages. Instead, the messages themselves
possess enough \"local intelligence\" to find their way around in the
net and reach their destination. In more recent schemes of network
control, messages are not only allowed to travel on their own, but also
to interact with each other to trade and barter resources ( computer
memory, processing time). In these interactions, the local intelligence
granted to the messages may be increased spontaneously, giving them more
initiative than originally planned by the programmers. Whether these
processes are viewed as \"creative\" or \"destructive\" will depend on
how much they interfere with the network\'s original function. These
last two examples illustrate the strategy I will follow in this book to
\"track\" the effects of the machinic phylum into the realm of warfare
and computers. [Although processes of self-organization have been
modeled mathematically at different levels of scale]{.underline}, from
atoms to insect colonies, [they have not been extended beyond
that]{.underline}. Some attempts have been made to model urban growth
phenomena, as well as certain aspects of economics, using the
\"mathematical technology\" of chaos science. But these [attempts have
been limited, and even their authors admit they are proceeding by
analogy with lower level cases]{.underline}. For similar reasons, my
approach will remain more analogical than mathematical: I will [begin
with an image that has a clear physical meaning]{.underline} (
turbulence, for instance) [and then apply it analogically to warfare and
computers]{.underline}. As we will see, mathematical models of the
outbreak of war have been created, and they suggest that the onset of
armed conflict is related ( remarkably) to the onset of turbulence in a
flowing liquid. But these efforts are just beginning, and [it seems more
important now to create a rough \"map\" of all the different areas of
the military that could be studied by chaos science,]{.underline} even
if this implies occasionally leaving the realm of factual discourse to
enter a world of speculation. What would we expect to find in such a
map? Since critical points (of speed, temperature, charge and so on)
occur at the onset of self-organization, this map should locate some of
the critical points related to warfare. On the one hand, [there are
physical thresholds related to weapons manufacture : melting and
crystallization points of metals; explosion, detonation and fission
points; thresholds of spin and speed.]{.underline} In· the same
category, [we could also include critical points in the
weather]{.underline} (the onset of winter, for instance) as well as
critical points in [geography]{.underline}: a mountain pass, the
confluence of two rivers, a bridgehead. [On the other hand, there are
critical points operating at higher levels of complexity: tactical
formations, battles, wars]{.underline} and so on. In this book [I will
attempt to draw such a map]{.underline}, [including the critical
points]{.underline} at which new processes are unleashed, the feedback
loops pushing society to those critical points and the role of
commanders in the creation of tactical, [strategic and logistic systems
that maximize the dispersion of friction during battle]{.underline}.
[This map will in fact constitute the \"genealogical tree\" that our
hypothetical robot historian would have traced for its
species]{.underline}. In this chart, [the robot would see the evolution
of armies as machines]{.underline} ( clockworks, motors and networks),
[the different forms in which intelligence \"migrated\" from human
bodies to become incarnated in physical contraptions, and the processes
through which artificial forms of perception]{.underline} (vision,
hearing) [came to be synthesized and embodied in computers]{.underline}.
Most of all, **[our robot historian would make a special effort to think
of evolution as related not only to organic life]{.underline}** ( a
lineage to which it clearly does not belong), **[but also to any process
in which order emerges spontaneously out of chaos: the non-organic life
represented by the machinic phylum]{.underline}**. As I said above, it
is very unlikely that robots will evolve along anthropomorphic lines to
the point where they become \"historians.\" But [in a world where our
future depends on establishing a \"partnership\" with computers and on
allowing the evolutionary paths of both humans and machines to enter
into a symbiotic relationship, it may prove useful to include the
robot\'s point of view when exploring the history of war in the age of
intelligent machines.]{.underline}

#### Guns don't kill people, cyborgs do. Debaters understand the risk assessments that we make in the arms control context about conflict, instability, human rights, etc. to be neutral---merely instrumental means to obtain the object of the ballot. The robot historian, however, would see these assessments for what they are---weapons acting on us, directly and indirectly, to militarize our desire.

[Nothing can act alone. Objects, people and states do not merely and
passively express the will of some deeper and prior structure or
interest; and ideas, norms and values cannot act without mate-
rialisation]{.underline}. So if agency does not lie purely in subjective
and inter-subjective explanations or determinist materialism, then the
action involved in violence and in its restraint may lie in Latour's
second meaning of technical mediation: composition. In his words,
'[Action is simply not a property of humans but of an association of
actants]{.underline}'.101 For instance, ['flying is a property of the
whole association of entities that includes airports and planes,
launchpads and ticket coun- ters. B-52s do not fly, the U.S. Air Force
flies']{.underline}.102 Likewise, [the Rwandan genocide]{.underline}, in
which small arms were used to organise large-scale massacres carried out
with machetes,103 was an assemblage of guns, bullets and machetes; the
export controls and political decisions of China, Egypt, France and
South Africa who supplied them; the Rwandan civil administrative
machinery that distributed them; the military that trained the
genocidaires and the radio broad- casts that incited them; the
identities re-formed prior to and in the process; and many other
actants[. Several trends in arms control practice may appear to reflect
an understanding of the hetero- geneity of compositions, but this
understanding is merely a move towards greater heterogeneity and fails
to assess and articulate the composition of relations among different
elements. Recent arms control practice has shifted from a focus on
complete weapons to a non-proliferation focus on components and
processes: from nuclear warheads to nuclear materials, and thence to the
organisational culture of nuclear facilities; from tanks and planes to
dual-use goods, licensed production arrangements and globalised defence
production. Such practice has also taken on different spatial dimensions
as it seeks to control spaces as well as objects by strengthening border
controls and the surveillance and interdiction of shipments on the high
seas]{.underline} (most notably in the Proliferation Security Initiative
and Container Security Initiative). [Howeve]{.underline}r, a Latourian
view is not simply a call for having more elements and sites and acting
upon each of them. Rather [it is a call to explore how these various
elements are brought into a stable assem- blage that, in combination,
produces particular actions.]{.underline} A further related trend is the
'turn to context' notable in the evolving arms control settlement
towards the strengthening of arms and technology export controls at
various levels. As Rappert notes, context is a 'fickle aid in resolving
disputes about meaning and purpose'.104 It too relies on choices and
assumptions about what to include and what to exclude from the 'field of
relations -- the context -- within which practice is located'.105
Importantly, [in relation to conventional arms transfer controls,
contextual assessments lack the vocabulary of assemblage and often
replace a desire for known causation with assessments of possible risk
codified in sets of criteria]{.underline} to be taken into account in
transfer authorisations. In many such criteria, such as those adopted by
EU member states, [context is largely seen in terms of the national and
regional contexts of con- flict, human rights, economic development or
the risk of diversion into illicit flows, and so forth]{.underline}.
However, [composed networks of violence or illicit flows neither fit
neatly neither into Cartesian spaces nor with Cartesian
dualisms]{.underline}. As the literature on the political economy of
conflict has shown, [the elements and relations of conflict
networks]{.underline} (from illicit diamond trade to arms exports,
population flows, inter-personal relationships among leaders and so
forth)[, do not easily fit within national borders.]{.underline}106
Likewise, [illicit arms transfer networks are compositions of various
decisions, systems, objects, skills and opportunities that cannot easily
be parsed into local and global, legal and illicit, state and private,
national and regional]{.underline}.107 For Latour, and others like
Bennett, concepts of 'context' often fail to trace the range of
associations between the factors they identify as important. They 'name
background settings rather than spirited actants' such that the mutually
constitutive aspects of social and material relations are hidden and
social science sees productive activity as residing solely with
humans.108 [By combining active things and networked/assemblage
ontologies, Latour and Bennett arrive at a radically different social
and political ontology in which there are no preformed objects and
subjects, but rather complexly composing assemblages that are always
emerging and reforming. This ontology goes beyond the psychology of
gun--citizen hybrids to large-scale assemblages that produce
subjectivities]{.underline}. For instance, Coward argues that urban
material network infrastructures 'comprise a complex and holistic
interaction of material and human elements' that produce 'ecologies' of
subjectivity.109 Coward, along with geographers Luke and Graham, refers
to [these 'cyborg' forms of metropolitan life in which the boundary
between the human and material and technological is
blurred]{.underline}.110 This trope of cyborg, similar to that used by
Haraway, is a holistic but often transitory ensemble of human and
non-human elements.111 Similarly [the relationship between technology
and warfare and subjectivity can be argued to be closely entangled,
whereby new technologies enter the networks of war through pro- cesses
of non-linear adaptation, innovation and faltering assimilation, and
affect how the humans]{.underline} (soldiers, policy makers, weapons
scientists) behave and conceive of themselves.112 [As cyborgs, social
groups, identities and practices do not precede and constitute
technology but emerge with]{.underline} it.113 '[Technology is society
made durable' as humans and non-humans 'enrol' each other as allies to
produce and stabilise a network]{.underline}.114 [Technologies bombard
human beings with a ceaseless offer of previously unheard-of positions
-- engagements, suggestions, allowances, interdictions, habits,
positions, alienations, prescriptions, cal- culations, memories \... we
could say that the quasi-subjects which we all are become such thanks to
the quasi-objects which populate our universe. \... If the robe does not
make the monk, wearing a frock makes us slightly more
pious]{.underline}.115

#### These violent delights have violent ends---the discursive prioritization of human agency and intentionality in debates is a [clever ruse]{.underline} on the part of the machine, disguising a simple fact which is apparent to the robot historian but hidden from us: that [weapons produce their users]{.underline}, not the other way around.

[What makes weapons fire? What causes states to gather arms? How do
weapons influence individual action?]{.underline} Long before the
popularisation of Actor--Network Theory (ANT), Bruno Latour took a shot
at these questions by indicting the National Rife Association's classic
claim: 'guns don't kill people, people kill people'. Latour blew the
argument away: 'What does the gun add to the shooting? [In the
materialist account, everything: an innocent citizen becomes a criminal
by virtue of the gun in \[their\] hand. The gun enables of course, but
also instructs, directs, even pulls the trigger- and who, with a knife
in \[their\] hand, has not wanted at some time to stab someone or
something']{.underline}

31). [What Latour describes is a desire to stab (or shoot) that emerges
from an encounter with the weapon. This desire, Latour argues, incites a
transformative reaction in humans that effectively enables weapons to
produce their users.]{.underline}

This article expands on this observation by developing a speculative
account of the powers of weapons to generate human desires. [The
argument originates from the suspicion that design, narrative, and
violence constitute only instances of the complex imbrications of humans
and weapons]{.underline}. [Consequently, the article contends that
weapons should be understood first and foremost as entities that operate
on desire and only secondly as instruments of violence]{.underline}. To
this end, the article criticises the dominant image of weapons present
in international relations (IR) and security studies that subordinate
the use of weapons to human intentionality[.]{.underline} This model
simultaneously overstates the role of human interest in shaping the form
and function of weapons and understates the formative powers of weapons
in generating human conduct. The primary contribution of this article is
the development of a theoretical paradigm that offers weapons a more
substantial in the production of insecurity, war, and violence[. As
such, the purpose of this article is to offer a broad outline of the
series of affective connections that link humans and weapons and to
demonstrate that weapons operate as bodies that incite, prompt, and
undermine human agency in ways that are largely unaccounted for by
traditional security studies literature.]{.underline}

Indeed, in a Spinozan sense, a weapon is a body with its own 'conatus'
or striving to preserve its being
([1992](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/21624887.2017.1312149)Spinoza, B. 1992. *Ethics:

108). [The possibility of a weapon 'conatus' implies that weapons engage
in complex relationships with humans for their own
purposes.]{.underline} Consider, for example, an approach to
understanding weapons in terms of the biological metaphor of evolution
(Fishel, [forthcoming](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/21624887.2017.1312149)Fishel, S. forthcoming[. ]{.underline}*New

Understood as a form of non-life, weapons fire, rust, and explode in
stockpiles, battlefields, jungles, deserts, and other environments in
unprecedented numbers

[In fact, the past several millennia could plausibly be described as a
catalytic process of weapon emergence and development or an adaptive
success story including attendant processes of diversification,
speciation, and resiliency. Weapons, understood metaphorically, thrive
in an ecosystem whose basic conditions they have forever altered through
a series of feedback loops]{.underline}
(Bateson [2000](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/21624887.2017.1312149)Bateson, G. 2000. *Steps

In [this light, weapons benefit from the formation of a complementary
relationship with their human designers and users who facilitate weapon
procreation and proliferation. Discourses about human sovereignty and
intentionality create a highly productive ruse or a form of camouflage,
which disguises how weapons exploit fear, conflict, and profit to
recreate the conditions of their regeneration. This ruse would be an
advantageous strategy since the human population reproducing the myth
would also be the group primarily subjected to it.]{.underline} The
successful implementation of this strategy would require specific
affective connections between weapons and human populations, which,
while diverse, integrate weapons into human fantasy, embodiment,
institutional arrangements, and aesthetic proclivities. [In short, it
requires affects that necessitate weapon--human relations. Weapons
consequently would need to develop the capacity to produce desires for
these relations. While this perspective may seem absurd, leaping forward
with assumptions about the distinction between life and non-life, agency
and causality, anthropomorphism and sociality, it offers a valuable
reinterpretation of weapons, which calls into question the dimensions of
the weapon--human relationship that facilitate the explosive growth and
diversification of weaponry. In doing so, it offers an alternative
figuration of the agencies at work in a historical process that might
best be described as 'the weaponisation of politics', where weapons not
only coexist with humans, but are cared for, sought after, and treated
as essential features of political life.]{.underline}

#### As we program our weapons in more efficient ways, we [fail to notice]{.underline} how our weapons reprogram [us]{.underline} in return to be [more efficient operators]{.underline}. War and ethics become [purely technical concerns]{.underline} as accountability for violence is [diffused]{.underline} through [endless layers]{.underline} of bureaucracy and technocratic efficiency. The weaponization of life represents a [shift]{.underline} in warfare that topical debate [can't account for]{.underline}; wars are [no longer]{.underline} fought between states, instead violence is [individuated]{.underline} in a [global manhunt]{.underline} that could target [anyone]{.underline}, [anywhere]{.underline}, [anytime]{.underline}---ethics itself is [tranquilized]{.underline} and life's value is [eviscerated]{.underline} under bureaucratic rule by no-*body*.

Langdon Winner describes "reverse adaptation" as the processes by which
[technological "**means**" soon become "**ends**" in themselves:
"Technical systems become **severed** from the ends originally set for
them and]{.underline}, in effect, [**reprogram** themselves and their
environments to **suit the special conditions of their own
operation**]{.underline}."62 [**Hundreds** of people]{.underline} in the
CIA [now **support the smooth running** of the Predator drone: from
**operators** and **engineers** to **lawyers** and
**targeters**]{.underline}. In short, the CIA is no longer as risk
averse as it was during the 1970s following a slew of scandals involving
assassination. In the judgment of Mazzetti, "the Central Intelligence
Agency has become a killing machine, an organization consumed with man
hunting."63

As the manhunt spread across the planet, the agency would frequently
butt heads with the military, which was itself becoming more and more
like the CIA. Such was the overlap between the military and the CIA that
in 2006 the two organizations "carved" up the world to determine who was
in charge of what front of the secret war. Sometimes they would work
together; for example, in 2006, Navy SEALS were "sheep dipped"64 into
Title 50 Authorities during a raid in Damadola village in Pakistan's
tribal areas65 (as they would be later in the Osama bin Laden raid in
Abbottabad). In the Predator drone, the agency had discovered a
technology that allows it to move from capturing individuals---the
program of "extraordinary rendition" that defined the Bush era---to
killing them. This moment can also be located in the bureaucratic
landscape: in May 2004, the CIA's inspector general published a damning
106--page report on the agency's detention and interrogation program. A
calculation was therefore made: the CIA believed it would attract less
criticism and would generate fewer legal headaches if it began killing
rather than jailing terror suspects. "Killing by remote control was the
antithesis of the dirty, intimate work of interrogation. It somehow
seemed cleaner, less personal."66 The next month, Nek Muhammad was dead.

As we have argued elsewhere, "[The drone is heralded by the U.S.
military as the **apex** of a targeting logic---**accurate**,
**efficient**, and **deadly**]{.underline}."67 [With this **belief in
the drone's technical ability** has come a **faith in its ability to
reduce civilian deaths**]{.underline}. In 2010, Harold Koh, State
Department attorney, argued that "advanced technologies have helped to
make our targeting even more precise"; in 2012 Obama called drone
attacks "very precise, precision strikes"; and in the same year CIA
director Brennan said that "targeted killings are ethical" because of
the "unprecedented ability of remotely piloted aircraft to precisely
target a military objective."68 [These claims]{.underline} are important
because they [**forefront** the]{.underline} Predator's [technology
characteristics to **adjudicate**, and indeed **tranquilize**, **moral**
and **ethical responsibility**]{.underline}. Crucially, [the drone's
technological ability is **translated** into a **legal** and **ethical
ability**]{.underline}. As David Kennedy argues, "[Whether a norm is or
is not legal is a function **not** of its **origin** or **pedigree**,
but of its **effects**]{.underline}."69 To put it more provocatively:
[the Predator is **itself a moral actor** and ethics are **fast becoming
purely technical concerns**]{.underline}. As Martin Heidegger has
observed, [we **underestimate technology** if we see it **only** as a
neutral "**tool**"]{.underline}70---[the essence of technology is
"**enframing**": the ordering of the world into a "**stockpile**" of
instrumental uses.]{.underline} [Technology is **always-already
political**]{.underline}, then, in the sense that [it **mobilizes** a
way of relating to the world and to each other]{.underline}. If
Heidegger saw a kind of technological nihilism in industrial society,
[we see in the swarm of Predator drones]{.underline} above Pakistan [the
**reordering** of the world into the **bureaucratic spaces** of the
**disposition matrix**]{.underline}.

A Well-Oiled Killing Machine

The creation of the drone target is an intensely bureaucratic process.
[Understanding the various processes behind]{.underline} what Gregory
McNeal calls [a "**well-oiled killing machine**"]{.underline}71
[is]{.underline} therefore [**vital** in mapping the character of
**modern state violence**.]{.underline} Max Weber first characterized
[bureaucracy]{.underline} as a system of rules and regulations, as well
as techniques of rationalization and legal authority.72 It [is a
**powerful form of social control** and once established is **extremely
hard to dismantle**]{.underline}. [In turn, bureaucratic power becomes
**generative of secrecy**, as it seeks to **deflect public
criticism**]{.underline}. According to a Washington Post study of state
secrecy in 2010, an estimated 854,000 people work on programs related to
counterterrorism, intelligence, and homeland security in 10,000
locations across the United States.73 At the start of 2012, President
Obama defended the CIA's targeted killings in FATA, saying, "It is
important for everybody to understand that this thing is kept on a very
tight leash. It's not a bunch of folks in a room somewhere just making
decisions."74 Obama was only partly right.

The kill-list creation process has four main stages: identification,
vetting, validation, and then nomination.75 An individual is identified
both by his status with an "organized armed group" and by his
effectiveness within a network. This is a form of "effects-based
targeting," in which an individual's social system is mapped, including
a detailed assessment of the person's locations and relationships with
other people; in short, an individual's "pattern of life"76 is captured.
All of this information is stored within an Electronic Targeting Folder
(ETF), which is part of the previously mentioned "disposition matrix"
database. This procedure, in effect, resembles a law-enforcement model
of archiving "criminal" behavior. The target is then "vetted" and
"validated" by a range of intelligence agencies, which analyze the
tactical and strategic gains and losses associated with elimination.
Much of this process is now centralized through the National
Counterterrorism Center (NCTC). Finally, in the "nomination" stage, a
vote takes place during a meeting of National Security Council
deputies---on what is colloquially known as "Terror Tuesdays."77 Here, a
range of lawyers and officials, together with the president, view
PowerPoint presentations of each potential target.

Once an individual is "signed off," the actual job of killing begins.
The process starts by "fixing" the target to a geographic site. The
location determines the next step: assessing the likelihood of
"collateral damage." Both the CIA and military follow a "Collateral
Damage Methodology" (CDM) that allows analysts to visualize the blast
zone of a proposed strike. This process has been computerized with
"FAST-CD" (for Fast Assessment Strike Tool---Collateral Damage)---a
piece of software that uses computerized models for collateral damage
estimates. Additionally, a "Population Density Reference Table" helps
estimate the density of a population within a blast zone. If collateral
damage is "unavoidable," then final authorization for strikes goes to a
pre-determined authority for "proportionality assessment." If the
"Casualty Estimate Worksheet" number exceeds the value of the
Non-Combatant Casualty Cut-Off Value (NCV), then a step known as
Sensitive Target Approval and Review (STAR) is triggered. In such a
case, either the secretary of defense or the president must sanction the
STAR target. This proportionality assessment is contingent upon the
objective. For example, in Afghanistan, where "winning hearts and minds"
is official counterinsurgency policy, collateral damage is to be
scrupulously avoided. In Pakistan's FATA, the situation is slightly
different: there the CIA is engaged in a counterterrorism operation in
which winning hearts and minds is external to the strategic aim of
degrading the al-Qaeda network.

There are two problems with this system that we wish to draw out: the
status of "accountability" and "thought." The CIA's drone strikes are
often criticized because they are not subject to the same level of
scrutiny as military strikes. For Phillip Aston, former UN Special
Rapporteur, "In a situation in which there is no disclosure of who has
been killed, for what reason, and whether innocent civilians have died,
the legal principle of international accountability is, by definition,
comprehensively violated."78 As the ACLU writes, "We're seeing the CIA
turn into more of a paramilitary organization without the oversight and
accountability that we traditionally expect of the military."79 And
finally, for Derek Gregory, "Accountability is limited enough in the
case of a declared war; in an undeclared war it all but disappears." 80
But [the "**secret**" nature of the targeted killing program is not the
only place where we locate the **failure of accountability**. For while
accountability to an external party is important, there is **far more
endogenous failure** of accountability---and that is the
**displacement**, or **diffusion** of responsibility]{.underline}. From
Electronic Targeting Folders that contain "imagery and floor plans of
likely locations of the target," to a Collateral Damage Methodology that
is "grounded in scientific evidence derived from research" and data that
is "subjected to physics-based computer modeling,"81 [the
**bureaucratic**, **rational**, even **scientific nature** of targeted
killings **replaces individual thought with machine-like certainty**.
And this **does not directly translate into accountability in any
meaningful way**---after all, **who is accountable**? The **software**?
The **analyst**? The **drone**?]{.underline} In a sense,
["accountability" has been **reduced** to a **quantitative measure**, a
**Yes--No binary** that emerges at the end of a **complex bureaucratic
equation**. Bureaucratic accountability under such conditions is
**self-serving**, based on "**insular ways of
thinking**."]{.underline}82

[The personality of the **analyst**, the **pilot**, or even the
**president**, is **largely irrelevant**; the system **overrides
individual autonomy**]{.underline}. As Kennedy writes, "[Violence and
injury have **lost their author** and their **judge** as soldiers,
humanitarians, and statesman have come to assess the legitimacy of
violence in a **common legal** and **bureaucratic
vernacular**]{.underline}."83 Indeed, John Brennan, Obama's former
counterterrorism czar and now director of the CIA, accelerated the
institutionalization of these bureaucratic techniques during the 2012
U.S. presidential election to ensure that any future president would be
locked in.84 As one former deputy director of the CIA's Counterterrorism
Center summarized, "When we institutionalize certain things, including
targeted killing, it does cross a threshold that makes it harder to
cross back," adding that, "We are looking at something that is
potentially indefinite."85 Such an evaluation rests on the assumption
that all bureaucracies are weighed down by an incredible amount of
inertia and habit. Harold Koh, former legal adviser of the Department of
State, confided to a friend that preventing a targeted killing "would be
like pulling a lever to stop a massive freight train barreling down the
tracks."86 Here, [the problem of accountability is **magnified**. Not
only is accountability **reformatted** to a **quantitative exercise**,
it is **collectivized** to such an extent that **no single individual in
the kill-chain is directly responsible**: "With **so many people
involved** in the targeting process, the **collectivity itself may have
caused an error** while the public has no individual to hold to
account]{.underline}."87 [This "**anonymizing effect**" alienates
hundreds of bureaucrats from the killing fields. **War**, **law**,
**ethics**---all of these fields are becoming **purely technical
concerns**]{.underline}.

For Hannah Arendt [bureaucracy is a **prima facie danger** to
democracy]{.underline}.88 [With no **sovereign center**, no **source of
responsibility**, no **ownership**, an insidious "**rule by Nobody**"
takes grip]{.underline}. In her words, "[Bureaucracy is the form of
government in which **everybody is deprived of political freedom**, of
the **power to act**]{.underline}; for the rule by Nobody is not
no-rule, and where all are equally powerless we have a tyranny without a
tyrant."89 She also used the well-known phrase "[the **banality of
evil**]{.underline}" to [describe the **unthinking complicity**
of]{.underline} Adolf [**Eichmann** in the "**Final
Solution**"]{.underline} in Nazi Germany. For Arendt, [the **real
horror**]{.underline} of the SS official [was **not** located in an
**inner sociopathic evil**; it rested in]{.underline} his **[willingness
to follow bureaucratic procedure all the way to the gassing
chambers]{.underline}**: "The longer one listened to him, the more
obvious it became that his inability to speak was closely connected with
an inability to think, namely, to think from the standpoint of somebody
else."90 **[At every step]{.underline}**, his [judgment took place
within the interior of a **techno-efficient rationale**]{.underline} as
he renounced thought to logic and became a cog in the machine. For
Arendt, [this type of "ideological thinking" guides "the **whole
structure of totalitarian movements** and
**governments**."]{.underline}91 [The ascendance of scientifically
minded "thinkers" in such governments]{.underline} deeply troubles
Arendt ---and her historical analysis [is surely no more relevant than
it is today with the **scientific rigor of contemporary targeted
killings**: "The trouble is not that they are cold-blooded enough to
'think the unthinkable,' but that they do not think."]{.underline}92 [It
is **not** simply that in a bureaucracy **everybody is a slave to the
machine**, but rather, they are slaves to **technical know-how**, to
**scientific ethics**, and **bureaucratic accountability**:
"**thoughtless creatures** at the mercy of **every gadget which is
technically possible**, **no matter how murderous it
is**."]{.underline}93

In short, [bureaucracy **does not stand outside of state
violence**]{.underline}. And it is this twist that complicates
understandings of what a [bureaucracy is]{.underline}: [no longer the
"**pen arm**" of the sovereign opposed to the "**sword
arm**."]{.underline} Rather, [both **act in concert** to fuel a
**deadly** and **alienated rule by Nobody**: a **bureaucratic machine**
that is **part human**, **part robot**]{.underline}.

Conclusion: The Dronification of State Violence

"The practice of violence, like all action, changes the world, but the
most probable change is to a more violent world" --- Hannah Arendt,
196994

Activists, scholars, and human rights lawyers have routinely denounced
the CIA's program of targeted killings in Pakistan as an act of
imperialism that violates international law.95 This criticism frames the
United States as a "strong" state violating the territory of a "weak"
state. While this narrative may be politically useful for those seeking
to limit the exercise of U.S. force around the world,96 it fails to
account for how and why drone warfare is transforming the very logic of
state violence. As Hannah Arendt observes, "[Violence]{.underline}, we
must remember, [**does not depend on numbers** or **opinion** but on
**implements**]{.underline}"97---[and these implements of violence soon
**overrun the political goals they were designed for**, **reconstituting
the very fabric of inter-state relations**. In realist
accounts]{.underline} of drone warfare in Pakistan, [**human subjects**
often frame the narrative: the "**why**" of drone warfare is soon
translated into a "**who**."]{.underline} But in this article, we have
argued that [a well-oiled bureaucratic system soon **automates** the
very "**masters**" who are **meant to be in control**]{.underline}. To
that end, we have shown how two objects---the presidential directive and
the Predator---are co-constitutive of state violence. In much the same
way that John Agnew98 was critical of the conceits of territorial
reification, we have been wary of what could be called "Cartesian
reification," which reduces sovereign power to the domain of rational
subjects.

According to political philosopher Thomas Hobbes---who wrote during the
regicidal English Civil Wars of the seventeenth century---the primal
world of men is violent: a wretched landscape of war directed against
all.99 Individuals, hungry for their own survival, are free to murder
their neighbors. To shield humankind from this lawless "state of
nature," Hobbes argued for the establishment of a sovereign who would
organize a commonwealth of citizens to ensure peace. In this
construction, war shifted from civil conflict between individuals to
battles waged between national communities. [A hallmark of modernity is
located in the assumption that war takes place between **nation states**
and their **respective militaries**]{.underline}. Although this belief
is certainly a mixture of fact and fiction, and although a variety of
non-state "small wars"100 do exist, [the nation state is an **enduring
framework**]{.underline} of international relations and law. [What we
find significant in today's drone "**man hunt**" is that the **Hobbesian
state of nature**---of **violence targeted against the
individual**---has returned as a **central organizing principle**. In
this **individualization of state violence**, the pluralities of
commonwealths across the globe, located inside a recognized and bounded
territory, are **disaggregating** to the level of the human body. The
Hobbesian "**war of all against all**" has returned]{.underline}, only
it is [suggestive not of an anarchic, brutish human society]{.underline}
of bygone times, [but the contemporary logic of a **bureaucratic rule by
Nobody**]{.underline}. If, as Gregory suggests, "[the legal logic
through which the battle space is extended]{.underline}...[is itself
**infinitely extendible**]{.underline},"101 then this is because
individuals rather than nation states now populate the battle space.

A key driver has been a shift away from a "status-based" legal regime of
war, in which members of a military, recognizable by their uniform, are
targeted. Gabriella Blum calls this a move toward "cosmopolitan
individualism in the regulation of wartime conduct."102 And Samuel
Issacharoff and Richard Pildes describe this as the "individuation of
personal responsibility."103 According to Issacharoff and Pildes's
analysis, terrorism violates the cardinal principal of
"distinction"---it is not always obvious who a combatant is. In such
cases, evaluating an individual's specific acts is more important than
assessing their "status" with respect to an armed group or nation-state.
This model shares much in common with law enforcement, given that the
CIA or military must marshal an array of evidence of "past crimes" and
then adjudicate that evidence in order to sanction a targeted kill
(recall the personal data stored in the Electronic Targeting Folders).
This individualized form of targeting therefore exists in the overlap
between policing and the military, and it is a form of state violence
that has often been under-analyzed in narratives about the CIA's drone
strikes in Pakistan--- which usually pivot around Washington's violation
of Pakistan's territorial integrity. But this breach of sovereignty must
be seen as part of a wider transformation in targeting, which
increasingly focuses on the level of the human body (even if entire
communities and regions are subsequently terrorized, as they often are).

[Under this form of individualized targeting, death is **reformatted**
as both the **means** and the **end** of state violence. The war on
terror may have begun with territorial objectives and grand visions for
a new world order, but]{.underline} the drone strikes in Pakistan are
much harder to imagine in terms of identifiable "goals," since [the
justification for the administration of violence is either **vague**,
**limitless**, or **classified**]{.underline}. Put another way,
[contemporary assassination is **tautological**: dangerous individuals
are killed because they are dangerous individuals. While the "**global
war on terror**" may have dropped from White House parlance, it is
**not** because the]{.underline} Obama [administration has]{.underline}
necessarily [**narrowed its planetary scope**. What has changed is the
idea of the battlefield as a **discrete spatial container** of
violence]{.underline}. Replacing this is the idea of man hunting across
a neo-Hobbesian "state of nature." Hobbes's social contract rests upon
the assumption of a bordered territory; and within that space the
sovereign is free to exercise law and punishment against its citizens.
Outside of this territory exist the spaces of the "enemy."
[Traditionally, there is thus a **clear imagination of inside** and
**outside**, of different types of violence and political
communities]{.underline}---complete with distinct carceral apparatuses
and war machines. The criminal is an individual with a life history, and
the enemy is a nameless multitude that threatens the sovereign. [But the
individualization of warfare **fractures this
distinction**]{.underline}: the military target is criminalized, and the
criminal target is militarized. For example, in 2013, Obama stated that,
"Deranged or alienated individuals---often U.S. citizens or legal
residents---can do enormous damage, particularly when inspired by larger
notions of violent jihad." [The threat is not simply "**out there**"
then]{.underline}. In the wake of the Boston marathon bombings,
prominent Republican Lindsey Graham commented, "This is Exhibit A of why
**[the homeland is the battlefield]{.underline}**," adding "it sure
would be nice to have a drone up there."104 And of course, [many police
forces **do have drones up there**, patrolling the
homeland]{.underline}.

We thus reach the central paradoxes of the dronification of state
violence: [there has been an **intense individualization** of the
"enemy," at the same time that state violence has become **anonymized**
through an **alienated rule by Nobody**. There has been an increase in
"responsibility" and "accountability" placed upon the enemy, at the same
that automated technologies and practices have diffused bureaucratic
accountability]{.underline}. There has been a decentralization of the
geographic reach of targeted killings away from Pakistan, while there
has been a simultaneous centralization of power within the White House.
[There has been a surge in the idea of the U.S. "homeland" even as that
same space is **folding into the logic** of a **limitless battle
space**]{.underline}. Indeed, [the separation of FATA from the
territorial extent of Pakistan may soon be **mirrored on the streets of
the United States**, as **neighborhoods** are converted into
"**battlefields**" and **criminals** into "**enemy
combatants**."]{.underline}105 Perhaps the greatest of all paradoxes is
that [there has been an **ever-greater appeal** made to the "**law**"
and to "**adjudicative procedures**"]{.underline} by the Obama
administration---consider all the technologies that aim to rationalize
killing and due process---[even as domestic and international law has
had **less** and **less of a restraining influence** on Washington's
drone wars. The **gravitational pull** toward such legal rhetoric
**always comes from the inside of a bureaucratic
system**]{.underline}---lawlike, or perhaps, lawlite. [And so, even as
liberal commenters **praise the drone** for its **razor-like
targeting**, its **humanitarian potential**, and its reduction of
"**collateral damage**," we offer a single caution: **be careful what
you wish for**]{.underline}.

#### This debate is a [laboratory]{.underline}, not just a game. The historical vulnerabilities of the resolutional assemblage shouldn't be an afterthought in our analysis; they must be placed [front and center]{.underline}. The vision of debate as an isolated site for iteratively testing objective facts [reifies]{.underline} techno-militaristic ways of knowing the world and [silences]{.underline} the perspective of its "human test subjects" living in the Global South.

geopolitics of representation," Political Geography, Volume 65, July
2018, Pages 88-97, dml)

ANT further provides concrete insights into how laboratories function,
capturing their territorial and relational dimensions. Clearly,
scientific laboratories have very real physical boundaries. Yet [how
laboratories produce truth claims]{.underline}, according to ANT
scholars, [is]{.underline} precisely [not because they are insulated and
disconnected; the very '**inside**' character of laboratories is a
direct function of the relationship]{.underline} of scientists [to the
'**outside**' world. ANT situates the laboratory as a **physical site of
experimentation** as well as a **relational construct**, operating
through interactions that **bring disparate elements
together**]{.underline} (Miller & O\'Leary, 1994, p. 469).
[This]{.underline} representation [**unsettles** the conception of
'**testing**' as a process, which **proves the effectiveness of a given
idea**]{.underline}. ANT scholars argue that scientific [facts are **not
verified independently** inside the space of the laboratory but rather
validated through their "**extension**" into other arenas of social
reality, thereby **consolidating truth effects**]{.underline} (Latour
and Woolgar, 1986, p. 182). [This]{.underline} rendering of laboratories
[provides further insights into qualifying the relative significance of
particular laboratories over others. "Any laboratory scale is,
**potentially**, **immensely small** or **big**. It would be
**foolish**, on the observer\'s part, to **decide in advance** and **for
good what its real size is**"]{.underline} (Latour, 2005, p. 180,
emphasis in original). [Doing so would be to **prematurely decide this
as a settled matter** rather than **opening it up** as a question to be
**investigated empirically**]{.underline}.

These insights resonate with key claims of the laboratory thesis but
also offer points of disjuncture. In accordance with the thesis\'
efforts to [**broaden understandings** of the laboratory]{.underline},
ANT scholars have long called for expanding the definition of
laboratories **[beyond scientific laboratories]{.underline}** (e.g.
Miller & O\'Leary, 1994). ANT renderings of laboratories further
resonate with the thesis\' use of 'laboratory' to capture the artificial
(rather than 'natural') character of trends in Palestine/Israel. And
like ANT, the thesis invokes 'laboratory' in understanding the
production of truth claims. Yet ANT formulations of laboratories offer
three key counterpoints to the thesis\' rendering of the laboratory.
First, if the laboratory metaphor is relevant to Palestine/Israel, it is
not because it is "hermetically sealed zone" cut off from the 'outside'
world. Rather the emphasis needs to be placed on how its connections
with other places are developed, enabling a range of disparate elements
to be brought together. [The fact that **complex assemblages are at
work** in the production and mobility of security solutions]{.underline}
branded as 'Israeli' [is **not an afterthought to be brushed aside**.
**It should be placed front** and **center in re-thinking
policing/security laboratories**]{.underline}. Yet this does not render
different actors as a single "transnational unit" as per Graham (2010b).

Second, [ANT provides a **framework** through which to **make sense of
how certain forms of knowledge**, **practices** and **technologies
become generalized without conceding that this outcome reflects their
superiority**]{.underline}. ANT [scholars **closely grapple with issues
of success** and **failure** in understanding broader questions of
institutional reproduction, drawing attention to how **outcomes of
policies** and **projects** "are **negotiated** and **gradually
realized** as functions of **success** or **failure**" **rather** than
treating "**success**" and "**failure**" as **uncontested
descriptors**]{.underline} (Latour, 1996, p. 184). The closely related
literature on the historical sociology of technology (including that of
weapons systems) (MacKenzie, 1990, 1996) has reversed intuitive ideas
about how certain technologies become seen as universal and superior.
[Technologies]{.underline}, MacKenzie (1996, p. 7) argues, "[may be best
**because they have triumphed**, rather than triumphing **because they
are best**]{.underline}".

Finally, assemblage thinking gives us reason to be cautions about making
claims about Palestine/Israel being, "unrivalled", "largest" or most
"extreme" and proceeding to use this exceptional qualification as a way
to account for Israel\'s disproportionate degree of influence in shaping
global patterns of violence. There can be no simple reason why certain
experiences of violence are looked at as exemplars and others not.
However, the fact that the vast majority of conflicts around the world
do not come to be seen as case studies with valuable 'lessons learned'
challenges the idea that policing/security laboratories exist in a
straightforward 'natural' sense. This resonates with ANT\'s conception
of laboratories as quintessentially artificial spaces. Similarly,
Mitchell (2002) argues that ['**cases**' **do not exist** in nature but
rather **develop** through the **colonial practices** and **forms of
knowledge** used to make them **knowable** and thereby
**governable**]{.underline}.1 He shows how [the **forms of expertise
used to describe cases** do not simply '**discover**' some preexisting
empirical reality '**on the ground**', but instead **constitute this
reality**, whilst **claiming to stand outside of it**]{.underline}.
Mitchell thereby gestures to the importance of grasping how the
'reality' of certain 'cases' come to be understood as such rather than
accepting their existence as stable and pre-given.

Methodology

Methodologically, I would like to propose a few ways forward for
researching the sites, spaces, discourses and networks that sustain
violent disposession and the global war on terror. In trying to
understand how certain forms of violence come to be seen as exemplary
without naturalizing these representations, genealogical analyses of
particular 'war economies' would be apt, precisely because it would help
to reveal the contingencies of certain historical examples as models of
dispossession and militarism. Existing genealogies of counter-terrorism
have shown how Israeli state actors gained traction within these early
debates and defined their underlying terms (Stampnitzky, 2013).
Ethnographic approaches also offer fruitful opportunities. Despite
references to certain spaces and relationships as laboratory-like, there
has been no attempt to conduct accounts of "laboratory life" within the
actual scientific laboratories where Israeli weapons and security
technologies are developed. There are enormous ethical and practical
challenges of doing this. Nevertheless, as Gusterson\'s (1998)
anthropological analysis of nuclear weapons laboratories demonstrates,
[there are **fruitful possibilities** for]{.underline} critical
ethnographic [study within these well-guarded sites of state
power.]{.underline} [We would]{.underline} also [benefit
from]{.underline} ethnographic [accounts of the spaces where new forms
of warfare and control are allegedly '**tested out**']{.underline}.
Building on feminist geopolitics (Dowler & Sharp, 2001) and subaltern
geopolitics (Sharp, 2011) literatures, [there is **much more** to be
said about how policing/security practices are **experienced as embodied
realities** by those who **cope with** and **resist everyday forms of
violence**]{.underline}, extending illuminating studies of
infrastructure in Palestine in this vein (e.g. Jabary-Salamanca, 2015,
p. 172). [Such a focus would help to **reclaim the agency** of actors in
the global South to **move beyond**]{.underline} their prevailing
representation [voiceless "**lab assistants**" or "**human test
subjects**"]{.underline} (Bilgin, 2016, p. 172).

[If claims about the repercussions of circuits of knowledge are to
**carry more weight**, more needs to be done to empirically
"**follow**"]{.underline} (Peck and Theodore, 2012) [policing/security
policies]{.underline}, practices and technologies transnationally [and
unpack the meaning of "**learning**"]{.underline} (see McFarlane, 2011)
as I have begun to do elsewhere (Machold, 2016). Here there are major
obstacles related to the secrecy that surrounds policing and security
agencies particularly after the September 11th attacks (see Coleman,
2016), limiting the extent to which the repercussions of knowledges and
technologies can be observed and qualified as they circulate.
[We]{.underline} also [need to find ways to **analyze the rich empirical
data** found within professional security discourse that **more
self-consciously avoids (re)producing official claims** and **terms of
debate**. Industry narratives **should not be approached as
unproblematic admissions**]{.underline} as per Graham (2010b , p. 41)
[but as **ideological** and at times **deeply misleading
re-presentations** to be critically interrogated]{.underline}. In short,
[they need to be taken **seriously**, **not literally**]{.underline}.

Political strategy

In relation to re-articulating the laboratory thesis as a radical
political provocation, I have suggested that a focus on revelation will
not do. This issue pertains not only to settler colonial studies but
concerns questions about critical research on violence and geopolitics
broadly. As Cowen (2012) points out in relation to the study of
militarism, [we need to **question the limitations of critiques** by way
of **exposure** to ensure that such interventions **actually transform**
rather than "**recharge**" the terms of debate by "**cultivating
alternative knowledge**, **vision** and **practice**"]{.underline}.
Towards this end, [**bringing new perspectives** into the conversation
is **necessary**]{.underline}. Yet this move is insufficient. [We also
need to **actively re-make the prevailing geographical imaginations**
that the global 'war on terror' **depends on** and **sustains** by
interrogating of the temporal narratives that **represent time as
linear** and **progressive**]{.underline} (Closs Stephens, 2011).
Following Butler\'s (2012) critique of Zionism, [critical analysis of
security industries can **more effectively challenge** the teleology of
official narratives of innovation and progress in the face of
dangers]{.underline}. Drawing on Walter Benjamin, Butler (2012: 223-4)
argues that "[Catastrophe is precisely **not a chain of events** where
something in the past leads to something in the future. Under conditions
of catastrophe, there is **only one catastrophe**, and it **keeps on
happening**]{.underline}". So [while acknowledging that strategies and
tactics]{.underline} of settler colonialism [**can** and **do change
over time**, our analysis]{.underline} of these changes [must **more
explicitly disrupt the basic**]{.underline} terms of Zionism\'s
[**claims to progress**. We **cannot simply oppose**]{.underline}
Zionism\'s [**aims** but must contest the way in which]{.underline} it
(and other [forms of domination]{.underline}) [**ideologically structure
our understanding of historical** and **technological
change**]{.underline}, thereby taking up Shenhav\'s (2006) call to move
beyond the "methodological Zionism" underpinning the epistemologies of
even some of Israel\'s most ardent critics. This concern is not limited
to Zionism. As Veracini (2010, p. 99) argues, it is settler
colonialism\'s "linear narrative structure", which defines it in
structural contradistinction from other colonial forms, noting that
"settler colonialism mobilises peoples in the teleological expectation
of irreversible transformation". Recognizing and challenging this
tendency is thus paramount analytically but also essential to charting
new political possibilities for radical scholarship.

It is for this reason in particular that I have devoted close attention
to [ANT]{.underline}: it [emerges as a **refutation of technological
determinism** and the **reduction of reality** to 'nature']{.underline}.
Given critiques of this literature for its aversion to making normative
claims, my suggestion to engage with it may seem contradictory. However,
I would suggest that such a reading is misguided. Scholars have
productively used ANT to open up questions about the kinds of relations
and conditions under which new kinds of politics and possibilities for
contestation might emerge in the context of extraction and violent
dispossession (Mitchell, 2011). As Mitchell notes, [**understanding the
ways in which opportunities for contestation** and **politics arise
should never be understood in a general way based on a pre-defined set
of external conditions**]{.underline}, such as life under occupation
(Abourahme & Jabary-Salamanca, 2016, p. 751). [The emphasis, **rather**,
should be placed on locating "**histories of vulnerability** or **points
of vulnerability** and trying to identify **where those points of
vulnerability lie**"]{.underline} (Abourahme & Jabary-Salamanca, 2016,
p. 752). ANT\'s central focus on the roles of socio-technical
controversies further addresses how "[political subjects become **not
just objects** of sociotechnical experiments but **participants** in
them]{.underline}" (Mitchell, 2011, p. 240). None of this is implies
that ANT should be immune from scrutiny, especially given its own
complicity in the marginalization of indigenous knowledges (Todd, 2016).

#### In this laboratory, the role of the researcher is to [side with perplexity over certainty]{.underline}. This debate shouldn't have to settle the resolutional question, but [complicate]{.underline} it in creative ways---[tracing the contradictions]{.underline} behind how the resolution is justified [has material effects]{.underline}. You should reject any metalanguage---policy [or]{.underline} critical---that attempts to [describe the totality]{.underline} of debate's relationship to the political. Staking out a side on the controversy and searching for solutions to the common problems the world faces [prevents adequate solutions]{.underline} to the [impending collapse of the planet]{.underline}.

dml)

Actor-network theory (ANT) and the variety of intellectual practices
loosely gathered under the label of critical theory -- deriving from the
traditions of Marxism, phenomenology, structuralism, deconstruction, and
others -- enjoy a complicated relationship riven by skepticism on both
sides. In Bruno Latour's influential formulation, [ANT]{.underline} is a
'sociology of associations' that [abjures the **lofty**, **often
concealed explanatory devices** frequently found in critical
theory]{.underline} (the unconscious, class, and habiti, the structure
of writing, social relations and 'society' itself) [in favor of
**witnessable translations**, **mediations**, and
**performances**]{.underline}.1 [But ANT **does not claim** that these
devices are **unreal**; on the contrary, it **affirms their reality**,
but clarifies that they are, like any actor, **only as real** as their
**connections to other actors**. By **multiplying their connections**,
they **amplify their spheres of influence**, but always in **severe
dependence** on their successors. As beings circulating in academic
texts, their reality is **not particularly robust**. But when other
actors **mobilize them to do things in practice**]{.underline} -- in the
arts, in psychiatry, in journalism, in engineering, [in **government**,
in **protest**, etc.]{.underline} -- [they **increase in their degree of
reality**, existing with **more intensity**. To comprehend them means
**patiently tracking the laborious**, **costly**, **successive
transformations** through which they take on the metaphysical properties
other theories dish out freely: **identity**, **stability**,
**durability**, **definition**, and so on]{.underline}. In this sense,
ANT is not so much 'postcritical' as ante-critical.

[ANT '**follows the actors**' through their]{.underline} laboratory
**[research practices]{.underline}**, technological projects, [**legal
ordeals**, and **other trajectories**]{.underline}, which unfailingly
cross conventional disciplinary and epistemic boundaries, [to **trace
the associations** and **entanglements** that]{.underline}, in the hands
of critical theory, [are **too quickly subsumed** under familiar
categories. ANT's **fundamental wager** is that a **more compelling
account** of 'social' phenomena]{.underline}, that is, one [that
**adds** reality rather than **diminishing** it, can be obtained by
**describing such transformations**, by **taking the reports of the
actors as seriously as possible** rather than resorting to **hidden
causal mechanisms** in which they **dissolve**]{.underline}. For this
reason, [ANT requires **only a light**, **mobile infralanguage** --
**associations**, **mediations**, **translations** -- **instead of a
weighty**, **powerful metalanguage for interpreting** and **displacing
the actors' own movements**. The **only metalanguages that count**
belong to the **actors**, **not the theorist**. **We do not know in
advance what society**, or **science**, or **law**, or **politics are**;
if we supposed we knew, we would find **only our suppositions reflecting
back on us**]{.underline}.2

ANT and critical theory are normally considered utterly incongruous:
indeed, ANT is described with increasing frequency as 'postcritical'
precisely because it assembles and constructs rather than debunks and
denounces; is disposed to close surface reading practices prolonging a
text or meaning trajectory and dubious of deep causal explanations or
diagnoses uttered by authoritative experts stationed above the fray; and
persuaded by ethnographically thick, empirically rich, narrativizing and
historicizing descriptions populated with weak players followed by
modest fellow-travelers. 3 But while actor-network theorists frame
critical theory as a misguided scheme to reduce phenomena out of
existence by invoking generic social causes without paying the cost of
collecting and arranging the agencies constituting those causes,
critical theorists frame ANT as a reactionary effort to justify the
existing socio-political order of things through descriptive techniques
bereft of any ability (or desire) to intervene in the circuits of power.
4 ANT and other allegedly postcritical approaches are, for the critic,
emblematic of the broader decline of the political -- testimony to the
fact that the West has resigned itself to neoliberal zombiedom,
abandoning any ambition to formulate large-scale political visions, and
has thus become unworthy of any mobilizing political idea.

This mutual distrust is present not only in the field of science and
technology studies (STS) from which ANT emerged (critical sociologists
of the sciences, such as political-economic critic Philip Mirowski and
moral critic Steve Fuller, are vocal in their condemnations of ANT 5 ),
but also in political ecology, cultural anthropology, sociology, and the
philosophy of the social sciences, among others. Whatever the merit of
the claims, on both sides, of incommensurability in these controversies,
this chapter will show why the relation of ANT to the critique of law
need not produce the sort of arrested dialectic that has befallen
certain trajectories in STS and other fields. Indeed, they may mutually
enrich one another in unexpected ways.

2\. To disable the spectre of incommensurability requires immediately
shifting onto political terrain for two reasons: first, critical theory
(and Critical Legal Studies -- CLS -- in particular) views itself as a
political project, so a competing or complementary ANT-based account of
legal operations will carry no weight with it absent a clarification of
the political stakes; and second, even for actor-network theorists, the
law's intersections with politics cannot be ignored in accounting for
the strange beings of law. Accordingly, the emancipatory politics of the
critical tradition -- which claims that contradictions between
institutionalized appearances and unacknowledged or dissimulated
realities should be challenged to bring equality and justice to victims
of structural oppression -- and the compositionist 'cosmopolitics' with
which ANT has become associated -- which proposes the progressive
composition of a common world -- should be surveyed.

Clearly, these politics are not necessarily consistent. The notion of a
common world seems to imply a kind of subjugation no different from the
oppression against which legal critique rails. Who or what determines
commonality? Whose standards apply? And what of the cosmologies of those
opposing commonality as such, for whom singularity, difference, and
opposition are existential values?6 Is not the phantom of a 'common
world' precisely the favored imperialist tool of the moderns, justifying
white-male-Northern privilege under the cover of mononaturalism and its
offspring, multiculturalism? And cosmopolitics has its own questions for
the politics of critique. By departing from the actors to invent a
topology equipped with a concealed dimension of depth, does legal
critique not "withdraw \[...\] from inquiry the main phenomenon of
social science: the very production of place, size, and scale"? 7 Such
withdrawal has political consequences because place, size, and scale are
political instruments integral to, and co-produced with, the
inequalities and injustices that legal critique purports to challenge.

For ANT, [reliance on **social aggregates** (e.g. **symbolic order**,
**neoliberalism**, **biopolitics**) to explain particular legal
phenomena can yield **no emancipatory effect** because, **however
radical the rhetoric**, what has been achieved is **only the premature
unification** of the associations that have been
aggregated]{.underline}. By contrast, [ANT wants to **trace each
association**, **extend each divergent frame** of reference into the
next, **multiply agencies** and **mediators**. **Rather than taking up
sides in advance in controversies about**]{.underline} fundamental
**[topics]{.underline}** -- what society is and is made of, what law is
and is made of -- [ANT **witnesses their proliferation**. Where critique
is **restless** to achieve the **solid ground of decision** and
**judgment**]{.underline}, the kind of **[certainty]{.underline}** we
may associate with the true believer or fundamentalist in politics,
religion, science, etc., [ANT **survives on perplexities**. But this is
a **productive perplexity** because it allows ANT to **detect the
movements that account for inequalities** and **injustices**, **without
unduly canonizing a transient architecture** of associations in a static
global aggregate]{.underline}. Such, at least, is the claim of ANT's
proponents.

In the same stroke, however, ANT arguably also deprives itself of means
to condemn those inequalities and injustices. So it is with skepticism
that critical theory encounters the cosmopolitical proposition. If ANT
is not prepared to break out of its networks to furnish a position from
which an analyst can, say, condemn abuses of power, what can it offer
critique? Even if ANT's methodological resources were to prove superior
to those of critical theory, [the]{.underline} critic's [interest in ANT
may not be rewarded with a sounder theoretical basis for advancing the
causes of egalitarianism and emancipation]{.underline}. Thus, the
question is how critique's causes may (or may not) mesh with the
proposal of the progressive composition of a common world.

3\. Bruno Latour has cautioned against just this inquiry: it is
"deleterious", he warns, "to confuse this new definition of politics
with critical sociology". 8 But we must take this risk if we are to push
through the deadlock. [Taking the proposal seriously means rethinking
**not the objective** of critique -- **political relevance** or
**traction**, oriented toward equality -- but the **meaning of political
relevance**. Investment bankers, environmental lawyers, atmospheric
chemists, and digital media artists]{.underline}, for example,
[**already engage** in politics by **multiplying the actors** shaping
their societies, introducing novel entities]{.underline} (e.g.
discounted cash flows, obligations toward ecosystems, deviations in the
nitrogen cycle, and haptic visual affects, respectively), [and
**stabilizing them** until they become]{.underline}, if not 'natural,'
at least [**firm enough to rely upon** to generate **new inquiries**,
**projects**, **explorations**, **purposes**. Their **procedures for
designing**, **detecting**, and **disciplining these agencies vary
greatly**, and a **detailed accounting is needed in each case** to
create **uniquely adequate reports** disclosing the contingent logics of
inquiry, construction, and arrangement deployed in their works. Such
reports allow the **gradual elaboration of practical metalanguages**
belonging to the actors themselves: the **procedures**, **systems**,
**topoi**, or **logics actually used by**]{.underline} the bankers,
lawyers, chemists, artists, and other [**actors to guide** (and
**explain** or **justify**) **their conduct** and those actors, human
and nonhuman, that they represent]{.underline}.9

Despite its reputation for making 'outlandish' claims -- that nonhumans
act, facts are manufactured, society does not exist -- [ANT
is]{.underline}, after all, [a **toolbox** designed to **amplify the
voices of the actors themselves**]{.underline}. Because Latour coined
the term irreduction to describe the approach, affirming boldly that,
"\[n\]othing is, by itself, either reducible or irreducible to anything
else", 10 critics have seized on the allegedly reductive strategies ANT
requires to produce its descriptions.11 The actors' metalanguages are,
however, often very reductive: as Irreductions itself recognizes,
[actors constantly **sum one another up**, **frame**, **crystallize**,
and **unify one another**, and **devise limits** for one another in the
process of building their incommensurable worlds]{.underline}. And,
unsurprisingly, the reflexivity of the actors is shared by the analyst,
since ANT accounts are just extensions of the relays and chains of
transformations that animate them and with which they attempt to forge a
textual connection.12 [Reduction is both]{.underline} a [**logical** and
**strategic**]{.underline} necessity in all of these practices. [What
ANT **prohibits** is the analyst's **deviation from** or **erasure of
the metalanguages**]{.underline} (and metaphysics) [**developed by the
actors** by introducing **universal causal forces** purportedly hidden
behind the actors' backs. That would constitute reduction in the
problematic sense because the analyst thereby **silences**]{.underline}
the voices she ought to [**amplify** and **multiply**, **reducing**
their reality rather than **augmenting** it]{.underline}.

[The criticism rests on the assumption that there must **either** be an
**objective**, **real nature out-there**, beyond the networks, or
**utter disbelief** in any reality. But this is **false**. What is
called nature is **produced within networks**]{.underline}, i.e., chains
of transformations, [and is for that reason **real**]{.underline}. An
unconstructed, providential nature would fail to be real since it would
have passed through no transformations, no mediations, no relations.
[What needs **explaining**]{.underline} with respect to the question of
reality [is]{.underline} not how an 'artificial' being requiring a
network of allies to survive can be at one and the same time constructed
and real but, on the contrary, [**why** modern philosophers came to
think of an **implausible**, **inaccessible**, **unmediated
nature-out-there** as the **ultimate test of reality** in the first
place]{.underline}.

[A corollary of this is that ANT suffers (or **benefits**) from
a]{.underline} "ridiculous [poverty of]{.underline} \[...\]
[vocabulary]{.underline}": 13 instead of impregnable economic
infrastructures, universal laws of science, or the irrepressible advance
of dialectical negativity, [ANT traffics in **associations**,
**translations**, **mediations**. This self-effacing infralanguage is
**all that remains** following efforts to "**drop from the list of its
methodological terms** any which would **make it impossible** for new
actors]{.underline} \[...\] [to **define the world in their own terms**,
using their **own dimensions** and **touchstones**]{.underline}". 14 [It
is meant to act in **precisely the opposite manner** in which academic
jargons normally act]{.underline}, i.e., [to **enlarge** rather than to
**muffle** the voices of the actors: "We are **not priests**. We are
**not governing**. We are carrying out a very helpful role as social
scientists to make sure that there is **no hegemony**; to make sure that
the **multiplicity of voices** in this parliament of things is
heard"]{.underline}. 15

4\. [The **progressive composition** of a common world advances **only**
through the arduous process of **jointly articulating these practical
metalanguages** and rendering the modes of existence they presuppose
**compossible**. But compossibility is a demanding criterion. It demands
**care**, **caution**, **sacrifice**, as well as **unwavering
attention** to the **demands of other beings**. Particularly so now, as
the earth **unstoppably warms**, as territories are **reshaped by war**,
**rising seas**, and **biogeochemical processes**, as ways of life are
**altered** and skills are **rendered obsolete** by technological
disruption, and as the struggle for resources and security **drives
populations from their homes**]{.underline}.

In this light, a productive rapport between ANT and legal critique may
take the form of a twofold procedure. The mission of legal critique --
the denunciation of injustice -- is shortchanged by the tendency to
rapidly stabilize social relations in global conceptual enclosures, and
so it can, perhaps, be wedded to the descriptive project. This would
seem to yield a novel, comparative, empirico-theoretical approach to
legal phenomena. It calls for the creation of, first, an adequate record
of the law's practical metalanguage(s) and, second, proposals and
judgments about the ways law may figure in the ever-evolving ecology of
(non)modern practices.16

The second maneuver depends on the first: it is pointless to object to
the reassembled metalanguage---to the conduits, the 'persons, things,
and actions', that facilitate the passage of law---but its articulation
with other metalanguages, its ecologization, gives solid grounds for the
'critical' work of evaluation and selection. By attending closely to its
construction of 'place, size, and scale', law's metalanguage can enter
into composition with, and account for, other, nonlegal beings and other
metalanguages. [A legality that incorporates a **mechanistic** and
**mono-naturalistic cosmology**]{.underline}, for example, or
[**entrenches economic**, **racial**, or **gender hierarchies**, may be
**incompossible** with a science defined by **chains of circulating
reference**, a **politics of collective freedom**, or a **morality of
responsibility** for those beings that have **called to
us**]{.underline}17 -- [and thus **not capable of being collected** in a
common world. The **work of the critic** serves to **relativize these
competing worlds** in order to **isolate principles** their inhabitants
**did not know they shared**. **Critical tools** -- **measuring
interests**, **collusions**, **complicities** -- are **essential to
formulate proposals** for a common regime of coexistence, and so also
for **rethinking** or **remaking commonality** and **coexistence** in
general.]{.underline}

[It is **only after the controversies have been deployed** in their
empirical richness, **after the agencies have been
multiplied**]{.underline}, after the actors' experimental metaphysics
have been inhabited, [that the politics of compossibility **comes into
view**. The practical problem]{.underline} besetting any effort to
fashion a new bond between ANT and legal critique, however,
[materializes]{.underline} here: [the **slow** and **often painful
work** of mapping the law's metalanguage]{.underline} -- a project
lacking in radical political appeal -- **[has not been
completed]{.underline}**. Indeed, [it has **hardly been
started**]{.underline}: critical legal [theorists have a
**well-documented preference** for engaging law at the level of its
**conceptual form** rather than its **practices**, its
**technicalities**, its **performances**]{.underline}. So it is
extraordinarily difficult to foresee how this ecologization of law
within the politics of compossibility may unfold. There can be no
question of leaping over this initial step, of course; [there is **no
short-cut** to avoid the **embedded**, often **technical**, **stepwise
construction** of the **actual chains of successive transformations**
introduced in the practices of law, whether these occur in **formal
legal proceedings**]{.underline} (litigation, administrative processes,
legislation, treaty formation),18 **[informal encounters]{.underline}**
(everyday transactions, [**disputes**, **negotiations**,
**agreements**]{.underline}),19 [or other ordeals]{.underline} falling
somewhere in between.20

5\. And yet the first phase does not start from zero. While there is no
doubt that the resources of the empirical social sciences (ethnographic
procedures, but also semiotics, historical and documentary procedures,
conversation analysis, quantitative analysis) should be leveraged to
create new accounts of law sensitive to the variety of beings that
compose it, existing literatures offer a number of threads that can be
followed and extended into new frames of reference.21 These include,
among other things, recent critical legal work.

Alexander Weheliye's Habeas Viscus examines political-legal racism on
grounds that reject what he sees as the totalizing biopolitical
discourses of Michel Foucault and Giorgio Agamben in favor of the
interruptions, sedimentations, reprisals, and recombinations of
racializing assemblages. Weheliye does not so much 'critique' law as he
extracts the elements of those assemblages from what I would call the
law's immanent anthropology, demonstrating that "the entry fee for legal
recognition \[personhood\] is the acceptance of categories based on
white supremacy and colonialism, as well as normative genders and
sexualities". 22 According to this anthropology -- a component of the
law's practical metalanguage -- personhood collapses into property,
i.e., self-ownership. Weheliye, relying on the US Supreme Court's
notorious 1857 Dred Scott opinion23 and jurisprudence concerning the
status and capacities of Native Americans and their tribal territories,
links this anthropological caesura to the standards of whiteness,
masculinity, and heterosexuality. Tellingly, Weheliye mounts no legal
defense against this "racializing juridical assemblage": the traditional
arguments for greater legal recognition and protection of vulnerable
minority populations can address only "one form of subjugation at the
expense of others", 24 and so only intersectional political movements
can respond to the prolongation of captivity engineered by law's
anthropology. According to the twofold procedure proposed above, the
confrontation staged by Weheliye between legal personhood-as-property
and an extra-legal political imaginary takes up the second phase; what
is noteworthy here, however, is the progress he makes on the first one.
Weheliye's accounting of the assemblage's elements is of course
contestable, but the fibers it provisionally connects between specific
historic legal practices and the constitutive anthropology used by legal
actors today marks a step away from the debunking reflex driving much
critical theory.

By contrast, [accounts of law that **disregard its ontology**, reducing
it to a **mere pretext** for moral, political, or economic
preferences]{.underline} (often under the label of 'realism'!), [are
**useless**]{.underline} here. [In such accounts, law is the
**misleading neutral veneer concealing darker realities** --
**capitalism**, **authoritarianism**, **power** -- and **it is the duty
of the critic to condemn the contradiction of surface** and **depth**,
**appearance** and **reality**]{.underline}. Indeed, the program devised
by the Critical Legal Conference's ad hoc committee for the first CLC,
held in September 1986 at Kent Law School, identifies contradiction as
the 'central moving force' of the critical legal movement:
contradictions between law-in-books and law-in-action, formal and
substantive justice, police power and police practice, legal ideology
and legal actuality.25 Although the theories and methods have become
more sophisticated and far from uniform, contradictions between
appearance and reality, what is said (law) and what is done (politics,
morals, etc.), continue to drive the critique of law toward what for
many remains its 'central task', the 'disclos\[ure of\] the
contradictions in, and in relation to, legal phenomena in such a way as
to realize the possibility of liberating change within them'. 26

[Whatever the merits of the politics driving this inquiry, it **fails**
because it **cannot register the tiny conduits** through which the law
**passes**, leaping as it does to the '**underlying**' power relations
and forces of prejudice the law is **said to mask** in its very form.
Are we then to **give up**]{.underline} on both philosophy and sociology
in favor of doctrinal surveys, [**confining our investigations** to the
**interplay of proper legal norms**, **rationally reconstructing
rule-systems**, and so on? Despite the **modesty** with which this
approach clothes itself, it is **quite destructive**]{.underline}. Legal
[rules and norms **do not exist in a vacuum**]{.underline}. Indeed, a
key point of the theoretical practice of following the actors is that
[this method **elucidates the unruly conditions** that allow such
artifacts as rules and norms to **continue in existence**]{.underline}.
If critical legal theory unduly discounts and destabilizes law,
'orthodox' legal theory overvalues and unduly stabilizes it,
assimilating law as such to the small subset of beings called rules or
norms. This is hardly superior to the critical reduction of legality to
a technology for expropriating social conflicts. As I have argued
elsewhere, by [**attempting to eliminate the interferences**,
**hesitations**, and **lacunae** through which legal reasoning proceeds
-- to say nothing of the **bodily hexis** of legal actors, the
**ostensibly non-legal concerns** and **values that animate legal
deliberation** and **discourse**, and the]{.underline} technological,
aesthetic, and other [**materialities** that diffuse, transmit,
complicate, enact, enforce, and transform the law -- and]{.underline} by
so [**distorting the practices** of law under the pretense of
**disinterested analysis**]{.underline}, orthodox legal theory
[**commits errors** and **transgressions** still more egregious than
even the least nuanced legal critique]{.underline}.27 The understated
iconoclasm of orthodox legal theory is symmetrical to the
openly-declared iconoclasm of CLS: both want to cleanse law of
impurities and distractions, though for different ends (dogmatics in
order to reconstruct a (more) rational legal order, critique in order to
demystify law and bring politics, economics, ethics, aesthetics,
rhetoric, etc., into the foreground).

As Latour correctly argues in his ethnography of the Conseil d'État,
["\[n\]either by **recognizing social violence** nor by **focusing on
the presence of rules** can one **predict the movement of the
law**".]{.underline} 28 Rather, [it is **more fruitful to
reject**]{.underline} "the **[contradictory advice]{.underline}** given
to us, by sociologists on the one hand and epistemologists on the other,
[about **how to grasp the hidden reality of Law**, \[and to\] quite
deliberately]{.underline} \[...\] [remain on the surface of things,
stubbornly following the hesitant course of judgment]{.underline}", 29
[**taking note** of the **verbal** and **nonverbal twists** and
**turns**, the **breaks** and **false starts in reasoning**, the **forms
of causality invoked**, the **interests** and **values taken into
account**, the **techniques** through which legal bonds are
fabricated]{.underline}, the positive and negative modalizations of
prior statements of law and testimony, [the **way legal theories are
constituted** and **tested**, the **circulations of value-objects**, the
**procedures necessary**]{.underline} to construct 'jurimorphs', [the
**endless chains of mediation** involving legal and non-legal beings
needed to **stabilize**, **diffuse**, **contest**, **sustain**, and
**reproduce the law**]{.underline}. 30

#### Our inanimate reading of the resolutional assemblage [restricts arms sales]{.underline}---limiting us to an instrumentalist affirmation is [part of the problem]{.underline}.

Heterogenous [actants (]{.underline}themselves assemblages of others)
[must come together and make a differ- ence]{.underline}. [In doing so
they exchange properties, functions and goals and form a complex network
that cannot easily be parsed into what social values do, political
decisions do and material objects do]{.underline}. This exchange of
properties is emphasised in the fourth of Latour's meanings of technical
mediation: delegation (or 'Crossing the boundary between signs and
things').126 As ever, Latour uses mundane objects to show complex
interactions: the speed bumps on his university campus. These lumps of
concrete, as 'sleeping policemen', are more than 'dependable denizens
that support the world of discourse'.127 Drivers now encounter the sign
to slow down not as a moral matter of accepting a responsibility for the
safety of pedestrians, but as a self-interested matter of protecting
their car's suspension. The simple point in this simple example is that
[by delegating some roles to 'non-humans' humans are not in complete
control -- the non-human does more than express the will of the human,
it affects it]{.underline}. [To the]{.underline} anticipated
[objection]{.underline} from 'anti-fetishists' who would accuse Latour
of substantivism, and say with the NRA [that]{.underline} '[guns do not
act on their own, only humans do so']{.underline}, Latour's response is
simple: ['A fine story, but it comes centuries too late. Humans are no
longer by themselves'.]{.underline} And to those that might wish to fall
back on '[materialism']{.underline} Latour responds: In artifacts and
technologies we [do not find the efficiency and stubbornness of matter,
imprinting chains of cause and effect onto malleable humans. The speed
bump is ultimately not made out of matter; it is full of engineers and
chancellors and lawmakers, commingling their wills and their story lines
with those of gravel, concrete, paint, and standard
calculations]{.underline}.128 While speed bumps clearly are unimportant
for arms control and security concerns, the notion that within
assemblages human and non-human elements 'exchange properties', such
that both shape the roles played by each of the others, and so that
neither is in control, is clearly more important. The most obvious
examples of delegation relate to those types of weapons and technology
where important opportunities for ethical and political choice become
limited. [In arms control theory such delegation has been a feature of
nuclear weapons and various 'indiscriminate' weapons.]{.underline} Early
arms control theorists noted that [weapons developments]{.underline} in
the 1950s '[have inhumanly com- pressed the time available to make the
most terrible decisions' and]{.underline} further [concentrated nuclear
decision making in the hands of a few]{.underline}.129 Likewise[,
'indiscriminate' weapons]{.underline} from landmines to chemical weapons
[remove]{.underline} the decision about the timing, targets and accuracy
of violent action from [the immediate control of a human
agent]{.underline}. Currently different [delegations]{.underline} are
emerging in recent developments in military technology, such as the US
MANPRINT (Manpower and Per- sonnel Integration) programme which seeks to
integrate soldiers within weapons design; and the development [of
systems intending to take 'the human element' out of
decision-making]{.underline} such as UAVs and 'intelligent munitions',
both of [which seek to reduce human error and increase speed and
accuracy]{.underline}.130 Yet even in lower technology weapons some
delegation takes place: [auto- matic rifles may be loaded, aimed and
fired by a human actor, but how many rounds are fired and what they do
is not within their full control.]{.underline} Importantly, however, it
is not that certain types of weapons thereby become undesirable while
others remain firmly in the instrumentalist fold: [in none of these
cases can harm be simply attributed to the weapon or the user but only
distributed among heterogeneous elements that also include decisions,
budgets, exports and so forth.]{.underline} Delegation, then, raises the
question of where the space for ethical and political decision- making
may lie within assemblages. [It]{.underline} also [blurs the boundaries
between morality and technology as one of ends and
means]{.underline}.131 Another Latourian notion, 'inscription', is
useful here. Simply put, [ideas, norms and values do not exist in
isolation from or prior to a material world that they act upon.
Ideas]{.underline} are often not strong enough or durable enough to
sustain action.132 Rather, they [require materialisation.]{.underline}
As Aradau has argued in relation to the securitisation of critical
infrastruc- ture, such [materialisation involves assemblages in which
human and non-humans 'intra-act' (]{.underline}a term from Barad used to
contrast with inter-action which implies a relation between two pre-
existing actors).133 [If the formation and reproduction of collectives
is a process of complex human and non- human 'intra-action', then the
politics of arms and arms control may take on a very different char-
acter]{.underline}. As Latour says, [objects 'bind all of us in ways
that map out a public space profoundly differ- ent from what is usually
recognized under the label of "the political]{.underline}"'.134 The
political theorist Jane Bennett has drawn on Latour and others to argue
for a conception of political ecology, a poli- tics that is in
'parliament with things',135 that is attentive to the agentic capacities
of non-humans in assemblages, against the 'dead or thoroughly
instrumentalized matter \[that\] feeds human hubris and our
earth-destroying fantasies of conquest and consumption'.136 If politics
is with things, through delegation and inscription, in the composition
of collectives, among and enrolling active non-human participants, then
some of the [foundational concepts of arms control]{.underline} that
[produce an asymmetric settlement of arms control and feed the dismissal
of dis- armament are challenged. Arms control]{.underline}, indeed all
arms politics[, is no longer an instrumentalist politics before things
in which disarmament can be dismissed]{.underline}, or the
constructivist politics of inter-subjective attachment of meaning to
objects, of fetishes and taboos, [which implies a politics about things
that then acts upon them]{.underline}. Nor is it the politics after
things in which substantivist tech- nological determinism limits the
scope and pace of arms control to short-term self-help responses to
technological change and diffusion. Rather, [it can be seen in more
world-making terms]{.underline}, in terms more amenable to expanding and
exploring Booth's project of inventing humanity. Latour's critique of
constructivism is important here: the answer to the question of whether
some- thing is constructed is obvious, and does not correspond to
something being either constructed or real. Rather the important
question is 'is it well or badly constructed?'137 [In relation to the
current asymmetric arms control settlement, a politics with things
resists both the pariah weapons agenda and the focus on terrorists and
rogue states.]{.underline} It [reveals and refuses the hubris of
instrumental materiality that legitimates the utility of arms transfers
as a tool of foreign policy while policing risky exceptions through
generic export controls]{.underline} (without rejecting the importance
of arms transfer restraint). [It denies the rejection of the
world-making possibilities of disarmament on the basis of a separation
of politics and arms and the supposed impossibility of
uninvention]{.underline}. Rather, [the contingency of assemblages
implies]{.underline} not a need to control more people and things with
an exponential increase in the difficulty of total control, but [a more
modest approach that recognises the vulnerability of
assemblages]{.underline}. It does not, however, present easy
alternatives for action: for assertions of substantivism to counteract
instrumentalism or vice versa. Rather, [it would refuse to permit the
politics of arms to maintain a fungible deployment of two contradictory
determinisms. It calls for a materially-sensitive politics, fraught with
chal- lenges but unable to sustain problematic distinctions between
types of weapons and types of reci- pients. All arms politics, including
transfers and use, and the restraint thereof, are world-making, not mere
symptoms of a pre-given world]{.underline}. Further, in recognising the
agentic capacities of assem- blages, the CSS project of inventing
humanity now has many more allies to enrol and many more sources of
action to strengthen in transformative projects. Conclusion Weapons are
often encountered as mere artefacts of deeper and prior autonomous
logics of anarchy and technological development and diffusion. This
article has sought to contribute to the theorisation of the aims and
possibilities of arms control and disarmament by showing how differing
[views of arms control rest upon a common dualism between
society]{.underline} (and security) [and technology]{.underline} and
weapons. [This has limited the scope of arms control to instrumental and
incremental change and contributed to the marginalisation of disarmament
concerned with transformative change. It has produced a practical arms
control settlement that is asymmetric]{.underline}, and within which the
location and form of arms limitations reflects differing balances of
instrumentalist and substantivist accounts of socio-material relations.
In contrast, [a]{.underline} Latourian [view of the agentic capacities
of material things in composed but often hidden assemblages]{.underline}
of human and non-human actants [emphasises different starting points for
analysis]{.underline} (based on a rejection of purification and an
embracing of the principle of irreduction). [It also gives a vocabulary
of material mediation and composition for exploring violent assemblages
and assemblages of control that militates against the familiar limits of
arms control and disarmament and may offer]{.underline} the CSS project
[conceptual resources with which to pursue]{.underline} its aims of
[transformatory change, and also reveal concrete possibilities for doing
so]{.underline}.

A third model understands the encounter between humans and weapons in
terms of a series of potentials introduced by weapons[.]{.underline}
This 'abstract' reading derives from weapons ability to synthesise a
variety of discrete connections between objects, humans, and larger
assemblages including the construction, use, and care of weapons. [These
potentials,]{.underline} which remain unactualised[, produce contingent
reactions to weapons, which cannot be predefined by the function or
purpose of the weapon.]{.underline} Put differently[, a weapon operates
as a pluripotential object that stimulates multiple forms of desire that
cannot be derived from the apparent utility of weapons for
humans.]{.underline} The 'fantasy' and 'familiarity' models would thus
be only a subset of the broader relations formed by the potential opened
by the 'striking power' affects of the weapons[.]{.underline} In this
respect, it is important recall the earlier point that as striking
instruments[, weapons emerge in relation to an exterior milieu rather
than an interior territory]{.underline} (Deleuze and
Guattari [1987](https://www-tandfonline-com.proxy.lib.umich.edu/doi/full/10.1080/21624887.2017.1312149)Deleuze, G.,

Unlike tools, which work towards a specific end in a process of
construction and must be freed from this model to perform otherwise, the
[potentiality of the weapon hinges on a far wider and arguably more
creative form of expenditure, which involves the negative rearticulation
of possibility]{.underline}. Put differently, [the potentiality
lingering on the cutting edge of the weapon, the capacity to void other
relations, strikes human subjects and alters desires irrespective of
their conscious acknowledgment of the process.]{.underline} This
potentiality grows with the expansion of processes of weaponisation and,
in effect, generates positive feedback loops. [Weapons' potential
stimulates greater investment (social, economic, military, and
affective) in weapons, which augments the potential of weapons in
multiple forms. The striking power of the weapon not only works as an
instrument, unconscious fantasy, or because of the proximity of arms but
works also on the production of human subjectivity and desire at the
broadest and most intimate levels.]{.underline} Two examples show how
[this]{.underline} third [model operates and directly challenge the
presumption of human sovereignty]{.underline} over weapons by
demonstrating how weapons influence subjectivity. First, Klaus
Theweleit's work *Male Fantasies* unpacks the forms of desire and
weaponry at work in the *freikorps* and Nazi leadership

Theweleit's argument, which remains largely ignored in studies of war
and conflict, is that [the *freikorps* conceptions of self, state, and
society were entangled with processes of weaponisation.
The *freikorps*]{.underline}, according to Theweleit, [were]{.underline}
not exclusively [intent on]{.underline} the destruction of the Weimar
Republic, Jewish people, or the Soviet Union, but with [the articulation
of self through the process of destruction itself.]{.underline} [In this
sense, the *freikorps* enemies were liquid, potential, fluidly targeted
on account of their ontological difference rather than static, eugenic
categories]{.underline}. Their image of body, society, and state defined
by a rigid schema except, as Theweleit shows, during the act of killing,
which provided a space of creativity. Destruction thus formed a crucial
part of the *freikorps* articulation of identity as their very purpose
was to make war 'more than a profession, \[but\] a state of
being[']{.underline}
(Theweleit [1989](https://www-tandfonline-com.proxy.lib.umich.edu/doi/full/10.1080/21624887.2017.1312149)Theweleit, K. 1989. *Male

396). As the means of destruction, weapons play a powerful role in
the *freikorps* articulation of self such that they identify with their
weapons as vehicle of a perpetual seek and destroy mission.
The *freikorps* thus envision their lives as means of destruction long
before engagement with enemies
(Theweleit [1987](https://www-tandfonline-com.proxy.lib.umich.edu/doi/full/10.1080/21624887.2017.1312149)Theweleit, K. 1987. *Male

218--225). [In short, weapons reconstruct the *freikorps* very capacity
to desire, the forms desire takes, and the ultimate form of life of
the *freikorps* such that they discover a virtually unlimited series of
enemies and sources of danger to destroy.]{.underline} Another example
is brilliantly outlined by Banu Bargu's *Starve and Immolate: The
Politics of Human Weapons*. [Bargu's text describes the formation of
necropolitical resistances that challenge the coherence of a biopolitics
of life. In doing so, she theorises a process of 'the weaponization of
life' as 'the tactic of resorting to corporeal and existential practices
of struggle, based on the technique of self-destruction, in order to
make a political statement or advance political goals']{.underline}

but many of these examples are cases where militaries exploit the design
features of an organism just like metallic weapons exploit the
properties of metal. [The appearance of 'human weapons', in contrast,
marks the point where weapons redefine the purpose, function, and
possibilities of life and death. However, this process is both a
'weaponisation of life' and a 'vitalisation of the weapon', since the
possibility of human weaponisation presupposes the capacity for weapons
to augment human desire and self-understanding so that the nature, role,
and function of life and political conflict transform]{.underline}
(Bargu [2014](https://www-tandfonline-com.proxy.lib.umich.edu/doi/full/10.1080/21624887.2017.1312149)Bargu, B. 2014. *Starve

In this regard, the weapon no longer works as simply a tool, but as a
positive influence in human life if not constituting a new form of life
altogether. Put differently, the subjects of Bargu's study develop
because of the potential for weapons to transform the conception of
self[. This possibility depends on a set of potentials opened up by
weapons and discloses how the reworking of desire relies on affective
channels that go beyond imagination or proximity. Furthermore, these
examples imply a full reversal of the assumption of human sovereignty
over weapons by revealing the possibility that weapons alter the very
definition of human life both symbolically and
technically.]{.underline}These limited cases create a number of problems
for theories of the control and management of weapons[.]{.underline}
First, they destabilise the assumption that humans direct weapons to
predetermined ends and, by doing so, challenge traditional accounts of
the genesis of insecurity and armed conflict. Second, they suggest that,
on account of their potentiality, [weapons have the capacity to modify
desire by creating new constituencies that will advocate for them, use
them, ensure their reproduction as a form of non-life, and take them on
as integral to their mode of life. Weapons thus cannot be easily
separated from their capacity to build assemblages with human beings who
bear them as vital objects of desire.]{.underline} Unfortunately,
discussions of warfare have largely excluded this dimension of weaponry
from scrutiny.

#### Weapons carry affective potentials that actively contribute to the production of subjectivity- they actively incite desire within their subjects. Their affective potential lies in their ability to divide assemblages and reconstitute somatic postures, social narratives, and incite emotion. 

**Meiches 17** (Benjamin Meiches. 2017 Weapons, desire, and the making
of war. Critical Studies on Security 5:1, pages 9-27.)adi

This section develops a theory of weapon agency based in the work of JFC
Fuller, Gilles Deleuze and Felix Guattari, and a number of other
contemporary theorists of violence. It suggests that [weapons are
defined by distinctive affective potentials, which exert formative
influence on social life rather than passive instruments of
violence.]{.underline} The section uses this theory to demonstrate that
[weapons do not merely impact human calculations or facilitate political
violence, but actively contribute to the production of subjectivity and,
as a consequence, security and warfare]{.underline}. Drawing together
Fuller's understanding of war instruments with Deleuze and Guattari's
appreciation for the independence of objects provides an important
avenue for interpreting the affective implications of weaponry as a
distinct form of object. Indeed, as JFC Fuller puts it nearly a century
ago: ['From the javelin and the arrow to the super-fortress and the
rocket-bomb, the very power to destroy... has intoxicated
man']{.underline}
(Fuller [1998](https://www-tandfonline-com.proxy.lib.umich.edu/doi/full/10.1080/21624887.2017.1312149)Fuller, J.

x). Fuller adds a post-human twist: '[We are entranced by their cunning,
their power and precision, also by the things they give us and the
profits we reap by means of them. Yet, how they influence us, as living
creatures, is left uncalculated]{.underline}' (x--xi). Fuller's
description notes the various qualities of weapons such as sublimity,
cunning, and power, which draw humans to weapons. Set next to this
complex account of the influences of weapons on 'living creatures',
Fuller's definition of the weapon as 'an instrument with striking power'
seems reductive (16). However, [this definition of weaponry offers a
valuable starting point to theorise the capacity of weapons to incite
desire.]{.underline} Deleuze and Guattari make a similar observation
that weapons have a privileged relationship to processes of propulsion
in contrast to a tool's introjective model of force (Deleuze and
Guattari [1987](https://www-tandfonline-com.proxy.lib.umich.edu/doi/full/10.1080/21624887.2017.1312149)Deleuze, G.,

[Weapons expend energy in relation to an exterior milieu whereas tools
conserve energy in the process of building a territory]{.underline}. The
notion that a weapon has a 'striking power' captures how the 'flight' of
ballistics expels force while the 'blow' of the hammer preserves it for
another use[.]{.underline} Deleuze and Guattari further differentiate
weapons and tools in terms of the vectors of speed and gravity, free
action and work, and expression with jewellry rather than the
order-words and signs (396--401). These distinctions constitute the
series of differential relations that characterise a particular
assemblage, which acts as the formal cause of the weapons and tools
distinction[. As they put it, 'the principle behind all technology is to
demonstrate that a technical element remains abstract, entirely
undetermined, as long as one does not relate it to an *assemblage* it
presupposes ... weapons and tools are consequences, nothing but
consequences']{.underline} (398--399).The philosophers further
distinguish tools and weapons by examining different 'compositions of
desire' as a defining aspect of both entities (Deleuze and
Guattari [1987](https://www-tandfonline-com.proxy.lib.umich.edu/doi/full/10.1080/21624887.2017.1312149)Deleuze, G.,

399[). By compositions of desire, they refer to the peculiar forms of
passion, drive, and meaning that glue weapons and tools
together.]{.underline} With respect to desire, [they argue that tools
presuppose a form of 'introspective feeling' while weapons operate as
'projectile affects'. Affects discharge emotions and, as such, resonate
with the explosive properties of the weapon while the tool remains
apathetic to the work it performs.]{.underline} These differences are so
stark that Deleuze and Guattari declare: 'weapons are affects and
affects weapons' (400).

#### Weapons release a destructive expenditure in an explosion designed to divide assemblages into scales of each other; this befalls both human embodiment and relations of desire in indeterminable ways- the creation of desire also contributes to the creation of new users. 

**Meiches 17** (Benjamin Meiches. 2017 Weapons, desire, and the making
of war. Critical Studies on Security 5:1, pages 9-27.)adi

This observation is critical because the affective capacities of weapons
and the weaponisation of affects take many forms. For instance, as
architect Léopold Lambert argues, [the destructive expenditure unleashed
by weapons includes affective 'operation\[s\] in which physical bodies
are being "broken down" into smaller material assemblages']{.underline}.
As Lambert describes the process, [an explosion is not defined by
temporality or speed, but by an exothermic reaction latent in a bomb's
chemical components. In a materialist sense, the exothermic reaction
'destroys' by releasing forces that divide assemblages of one scale into
assemblages of another]{.underline}
(Lambert [2013](https://www-tandfonline-com.proxy.lib.umich.edu/doi/full/10.1080/21624887.2017.1312149)Lambert, L. 2013.

In this sense, [the weapon's affective power consists of 'striking'
organic and inorganic compounds at a chemical level in order to deform
them]{.underline}. Other weapons work similarly. Swords cleave flesh,
bullets pierce armour, and bombs produce rubble and debris
(Gordillo [2014](https://www-tandfonline-com.proxy.lib.umich.edu/doi/full/10.1080/21624887.2017.1312149)Gordillo, G. 2014. *Rubble:

Press.[\[Crossref\]](https://www-tandfonline-com.proxy.lib.umich.edu/servlet/linkout?suffix=CIT0032&dbid=16&doi=10.1080%2F21624887.2017.1312149&key=10.1215%2F9780822376903), , [\[Google

These affective 'striking' properties of the weapon operate on multiple
levels. Prior to detonating or piercing, [the process of targeting or
even possessing weapons also discharges affects that reconstitute
somatic postures, social narratives, and incites other emotive responses
such as fear or terror]{.underline}. In order to account for the
affective power of weapons, I argue that contemporary understanding of
'striking power' needs to be expanded to include the capacity for
material agencies to divide and reconstitute habits and imaginaries.
Many traditional theories of weapons, such as nuclear deterrence,
implicitly presuppose affective 'striking power' to describe the
function of weapons. For instance, a [gap exists between the destructive
potential of weapons and the more limited, actual use of weapons. This
gap]{.underline} between actual and potential use [produces a
communicative difference, which relies entirely on affective
force]{.underline}. Typically understood as a form of threat, [the
gap]{.underline} between what weapons could do and what they actually do
[sends signals between parties]{.underline}. [These signals enable new
mechanisms of force, such as coercion, by affectively shifting the
habits of a targeted or vulnerable]{.underline} party. However, the
possibility of these affective signals depends on the weapons \'striking
power,\' which impacts a person or stated affected by a weapon prior to
an explosion or physical impact. [Threat is thus a byproduct of the
latent potential of \'striking power.\']{.underline}. [The entire
concepts of threat gestures or postures thus presuppose the affective
capacity of the weapon, but they are not the only products of this
gap.]{.underline} For example[,]{.underline} the difference between the
potential and actual use of weapons also establishes the distinctions
critical for laws and norms of war, but may also signal superiority in
battle or a different organisation of combat

[The 'striking power' of weapons consequently induces complex affects
that befall both human embodiment and relations of desire in ways that
are difficult to predetermine. Hence, the destructive aspects of weapons
constitute only a set of the affective relations that link humans and
weapons.]{.underline} Weapons similarly 'strike' humans in the form of
obsessions, profit, or art; weapons enchant, glimmer, and
terrify[.]{.underline} Arguably, these affects also comprise forms of
'striking power' in the broad sense of rearticulating the affective
relations between bodies[. By forming new kinds of desire, weapons also
produce their users.]{.underline}

### Thesis Cards---Arms Control

#### Arms control and disarmament don't go far enough to account for the political and economic drives for militirazation and only reproduce the security state

**Bourne 12** (Mike Bourne is a lecturer in International Security
Studies in the School of Poliitics, International Studies and Philosophy
at Queen's University Belfast. He holds a BA and PhD from the University
of Bradford, "Guns don't kill people, cyborgs do: a Latourian
provocation for transformatory arms control and disarmament," Global
Change, Peace & Security, 24:1, 141-163, SR)

[The general trajectory of moving away from 'things' was integral to the
early development of a broad consensus on the aims and challenges of
arms control.]{.underline} While masking wide differences within and
between realist and liberal approaches,24 this consensus means that
[arms control theory has inherited a theoretical framework that has
considerably narrowed its hopes for chan- ging world order and producing
security.]{.underline} Approaches to security, and to the politics and
possibi- lities of disarmament and arms control, were more diverse in
the inter-war and early post-Second World War period before classic
theories of arms control were written.25 This narrowed in the so- called
'golden age' of theorising about arms control and disarmament in the
1950s and 1960s, with the major theoretical works by Hedley Bull, Thomas
Schelling and Morton Halperin and the wider range of perspectives
collected in a special issue of Daedalus.26 In this period a broad
consensus emerged on [the three main objectives of arms control that are
frequently re- invoked throughout the literature]{.underline}. Schelling
and Halperin have outlined them: '[Reducing the like- lihood of war, its
scope and violence if it occurs, and the political and economic costs of
being prepared for it.']{.underline}27 Hedley Bull pointed to similar
aims, though with stronger moral overtones. Additionally, Bull mentioned
[a fourth aim of combating the militarisation of society]{.underline}.
Importantly, however, he then left this aside because it was too complex
and because, for him, it applied only to the influence of military
industries on liberal democracies -- it may, however, regain some
importance when one looks at arms control beyond the confines of
Cartesian dualism.28 Early theorists invoked the language of 'arms
control' to distance their thought from what they perceived as naïve
proposals for General and Complete Disarmament and from the failed
disarmament conference of the inter-war years. This is portrayed as
reflecting a deeper philoso- phical distinction between means and ends
in the relation of arms limitation to world order. For early and recent
theorists, ['arms control' is about ensuring stability and security
through the judi- cious control of military technology]{.underline}
(which might include increases in levels of armaments); ['dis-
armament']{.underline} -- it is claimed -- s[ees the reduction in
weapons as a goal of value in itself]{.underline}.29 [This distinction
between arms control as the management of arms politics and disarmament
as a naïve call for its abolition is reaffirmed in recent strategic
thought.]{.underline}30 Arms reduction (disarma- ment) is, here, reduced
to one possible technique of arms control. Critics of this view note
that [disarmament has a long and growing history of successes from
prohibitions on biological and chemical weapons to conventional
disarmament after civil war]{.underline}s.31 Thus, as Cooper claims,
many security [scholars are guilty of a disingenuous rejection of
disarmament: conceptually it is deemed utopian and unachievable
--]{.underline} thus [when it exists, and therefore cannot be utopian,
it does not count as disarmament and is really 'arms
control']{.underline}.32 The Cartesian dualism is evident in the
rejection of disarmament, which is an assertion that [peaceful relations
cannot be achieved through disarmament but that instead the disarmament
can only follow the establishment of peaceful relations]{.underline}
(which may involve a limited role for arms control). Bull, for instance,
criticised his former employer, the disarmament advocate Philip Noel
Baker, by claiming that [arms are a consequence not a cause of political
tension and thus that disarmament is only possible in the wake of
political agreement.]{.underline}33 Indeed, Bull cri- ticised
disarmament advocates for also having a different understanding of the
implications of international agreement: 'an agreement, if it is
reached, represents not the discovery of the sol- ution to a problem,
but the striking of a bargain'.34 The consensus move from disarmament to
arms control, however, was not initially an asser- tion of
instrumentalism. Indeed, early arms control theorists were careful to
anticipate and respond to purely instrumental views of weapons.
Schelling and Halperin noted, largely in relation to nuclear weapons,
that ['some of the danger of war resides in the very character of modern
weapons' and particularly the way they produced incentives for
pre-emptive war]{.underline}.3 Likewise, Bull was deeply sceptical of
the instrumentalist assumptions in strategic thought based on the
'rational action' of 'strategic man' that Schelling and more recent arms
control theory assumes. Nor was the rejection of disarmament an
assertion of a status quo orientation. For Bull, [arms control could be
related to transformation, not just management of world
order]{.underline}. He noted that [the theory and practice of arms
control 'rests on a set of assumptions -- sometimes explicit, more often
implicit -- as to what kind of world order is desirable and
feasible']{.underline}.36 While basing his views on arms control on
well-founded 'general grounds of historical pessimism' about grand
designs,37 Bull criticised the widespread assumption that the objectives
of arms control married with the status quo orientation of US and Soviet
practice. [This,]{.underline} he claimed, [served to 'rationalize the
exist- ing distribution of power' in a way that serves to 'discredit
arms control, and to obscure the role which it has to play in promoting
the purposes of those seeking to challenge the present distri- bution of
power'.]{.underline}38 However, much of that nuance and hope for
transformation was lost as strategic studies came to locate arms control
as an instrumental adjunct to deterrence. [By minimising militarisation
and dismissing disarmament, early arms control theory moved away from
substantivist accounts of arms and world order, and set the stage soon
after the publication of the seminal texts of arms control theory for
its capture by strategic studies, in which instrumental rationality and
the logic of deterrence was dominant]{.underline}.39 Indeed, many key
theorists were part of the 'epistemic com- munity' of arms controllers
that produced and reinforced a consensus on the validity and goals of
arms control, elaborated its techniques as arms control ideas diffused
and became institutionalised in US and Soviet domestic political
institutions.40 With its capture by strategic studies, [the arms control
literature largely came to accept dichoto- mies of hierarchy--anarchy
and inside--outside in which the extent and potential role of controls
over weapons are profoundly different. In spite of a widely varying
historical and current record of arms control and disarmament as
order-making practices in different contexts,]{.underline}41 [the
dominant notion of the international as unchanging anarchy within
realist strategic studies came to set the limited expectations of arms
control. Arms control became a means of managing anarchy rather than
transcending it, either with a liberal emphasis on institutions or a
realist emphasis on mana- ging deterrence stability.]{.underline}

### 2AC Framework

#### Before you decide who did the better debating, you need a standard for what constitutes "better debating"---you should prioritize [topological]{.underline} debate about the resolution over [taxonomical]{.underline} debate. No debate is just a game---the space we're in, the things we choose to speak of, are all agents interacting with us whether we acknowledge it or not---framework attempts to taxonomize debate by separating process from outcome, which [distorts]{.underline} topic research and [strengthens]{.underline} militarized regimes of power. Our model creates a [more productive]{.underline} infrastructure for disagreement over arms control through [multiplying]{.underline} possibilities for disagreement.

**Bourne, 18**---Lecturer in International Security Studies in the
School of Politics, International Studies and Philosophy at Queen's
University Belfast (Mike, "Powers of the gun: process and possibility in
global small arms control," International Politics, May 2018, Volume 55,
Issue 3--4, pp 441--461, dml) \[SALW=small arms and light weapons\]

Barnett and Duvall (2005) and Hynek (in this special issue) enable
recognition of the diversity of powers. In order to explore the
composition of power, this article takes a further step in engaging the
dynamism that underlies this diversity. The first section draws out a
different orientation to forms of power inspired by process philosophy
and recent developments in 'new materialist' thought. This engages how
[different forms of power are **co-constitutive**]{.underline}, such
that [power is **not** explained by arguing that one form or another
**explains an outcome** but rather]{.underline} that [they **combine**
to form each other in composing an **assemblage of
powers**]{.underline}. This allows the article to argue that [global
SALW control]{.underline}, and perhaps other 'regimes', [are global
assemblages defined **not** by the **presence** or **lack of settled
norms that diminish controversy**, but that arise through
**multiplying** and **distributing controversies**]{.underline}.

In pursuing power in this way, [this]{.underline} article [seeks to move
from]{.underline} a **[taxonomy]{.underline}** of powers in global
regimes [to]{.underline} a **[topology]{.underline}** of power in global
assemblages. [Taxonomy]{.underline}, for Barnett and Duvall, [is an
attempt to '**carve power at its joints**' by producing '**critical**,
**mutually exclusive**, and **exhaustive distinctions**']{.underline}.
(2005: 43). [While this highlights the **diversity of forms of power**
in operation, it **cannot**]{.underline} answer Latour's invitation to
**[explain power]{.underline}** since the production of forms of power
is cut off by disjointing power: [power forms may **interact** but not
be **co-constitutive** in a deeper sense]{.underline}. Further, [the
taxonomy is **defined** by relations of]{.underline} distance and
directness and [interaction]{.underline} vs constitution [which can
**downplay** the emergent creation of space. In contrast,
topology]{.underline}, for Serres, [denotes the mapping of]{.underline}
nearness and rifts not in geometric space but in [the emergent
relational space constituted by **comings together**, **flows**,
**modifications**, and **separations of issues**, **actors**,
**practices** etc]{.underline}. (Serres and Latour 1995). [These dynamic
proximities and distances reveal power to be a
'**composition**']{.underline}: both as verb and noun denoting the
process of creativity and the product (Latour 1986, 2005). Thus, [power
is an **emergent effect of numerous comings together**, of enrolling
**different actors**, **arguments**, **objects** and so forth. Power
exists only within a collective, and it is the collective that creates
power and is also created by it]{.underline}.2

In emphasising topology and composition, this article is oriented
towards assemblage thinking and its underpinnings in process philosophy.
[A process orientation does not distinguish between
**process**]{.underline} ([as **negotiation in diplomatic
fora**]{.underline} etc.) [and **outcome**]{.underline} ([the
'**norms**']{.underline}, instruments, [**agreements**, and **settled
practices**]{.underline}) in the way the colloquial use of the term
process may imply. Rather, Whitehead describes the 'principle of
process' as 'how an actual entity becomes constitutes what that actual
entity is...Its "being" is constituted by its "becoming."' (1929/1978:
23). Here the process of creation and the object created are both
processes. No longer do we have the curious end to creation implied by
ontologically distinguishing production from product, or object from its
movement and meaning, as all are processes. Thus, [norms are **not
stable objects** that are **built** and then '**diffused**' but are
**continuing processes**]{.underline}. This helps avoid potentially
misleading distinctions such as the claim that 'small states' and NGOs
matter in processes but not in regulatory outcomes (Drezner 2008). They
may matter differently, but they are made to matter in the composition
of assemblages. Rather than seeking to explain SALW politics by
identifying power (of NGOs versus or with states etc.), this article
seeks to understand power as it emerges. Here power is always an effect
of associations; it is only ever power in action, not a reserve of power
that is possessed, stored up and utilised (Latour 1986).

Assemblages are not merely strategic alliances of actors, through which
power operates, nor fully unified wholes that eliminate diversity, but
are collectives in which power and actors emerge and become relatively
stabilised in their co-functioning (Deleuze and Parnet 2007). Global
SALW politics can be understood not just as a complex of clusters of
issues, agreements, and practices, but as a 'global assemblage' in
Collier and Ong's terms: 'As a composite concept, the term "global
assemblage" suggests inherent tensions: global implies broadly
encompassing, seamless, and mobile; assemblage implies heterogeneous,
contingent, unstable, partial, and situated.' (2005: 12). Since 'the
assemblage's only unity is that of co-functioning: It is a symbiosis, a
"sympathy"'. (Deleuze and Parnet 2007: 69) an assemblage is an
achievement that does not need to overcome diversity of complexity, but
merely to make co-functioning possible. Thus, the strength of unity
(effectiveness in tackling the problem is a different question) of
regimes lies not merely in a high degree of specificity,
institutionalisation, or normative and epistemic concurrence but in the
ability to render functionally coherent still disparate issue frames,
priorities, capacities etc. Such a functional unity of disparate
elements is an emergent property of the process of assemblage in which
controversies remain and indeed proliferate.

[**Controversies are assemblages** in which disagreements are **not
resolved** but **moved**, **enrolled**, **channelled**, and **ultimately
expanded**]{.underline}.3 [They are **not just**]{.underline} events or
[**debates that occur within a pre-given collective** or **location**
but rather **produce their own**]{.underline} scales, locations,
**[temporalities]{.underline}**, etc., [that **shift**, **appear** and
**disappear**, **stabilise** and **destabilise**, since these emerge
**immanently**]{.underline} (Stengers 2000; Barry 2013). Rather than
following Barnett and Duvall's distinction between powers that operate
in interactions of 'preconstituted actors' and those operative in
'social relations of constitution' (2005: 45), the approach here echoes
Barad's (2007) notion of 'intra-action' in which [entities]{.underline}
(here [actors and powers]{.underline}) [are **not simply inter-active**
but always **co-constitutive**, becoming together]{.underline}.4 Thus
[what is often registered as **compulsory** power and **institutional**
power (that are **relatively stable**) must be viewed as a
**circulation** of powers whose stabilisation needs to be
explained]{.underline}. Likewise, while their taxonomy characterises
productive power as the indirect production of subjective identities of
human actors, a process/assemblage view allows this article to try to
register the far wider sense of productivity at play in SALW control:
the production of possibilities, powers and modes of action.

Making disagreement possible: expertise, re-presentation, and the
composition of powers

How do SALW become a global political issue? As Garcia argues, while the
Ottawa process on APM coalesced around clear goals and strong leadership
to form a unified 'norm-building pathway', the SALW process was more
fragmented in its goals, leadership and issue framings (2006: 26). If
[**issue complexity**, **diverse interests** and **problem framings**,
**resist regime formation**]{.underline} then how did it become possible
to speak of a global SALW politics at all? [It is common to argue
that]{.underline} this relates to norm entrepreneurship and awareness
raising. However, the former only asks how agreement is forged out of
disagreement; and the latter implies that [agreement is **forged within
a pre-existing**]{.underline} international [**community** who were
**made aware of a problem**]{.underline}. Further, in the SALW case and
in much transnational governance, both are commonly argued to arise
through the efforts of NGOs, experts, and International Organisations.
However, [**no single actor** or **power type was the origin** of
the]{.underline} SALW [agenda]{.underline}: [The importance
of]{.underline} NGOs and researcher [expertise]{.underline}, for
instance, [has sometimes **followed** rather than **led**]{.underline}
inter-governmental [events and actions]{.underline}, and many key
agreements such as the UN Firearms Protocol and some early regional
agreements like the 1997 OAS convention,5 involved relatively little NGO
action (Krause 2001).

The approach outlined above reframes this question in an important way:
[How did it become possible to disagree]{.underline} globally [about
SALW? Composing collective action is **principally** the process of
constituting **collectives**]{.underline}, or even 'publics' (Marres
2007; Walters and D'Aoust 2015). Indeed, for Barry 'in politics [the
collective is **not a given**, but an **entity in
process**]{.underline}' (2002: 271). In this sense, [the composition of
a **collective** and that of a **controversy** are the
**same**]{.underline}---global [SALW politics **becomes possible** by
composing a **novel global political space**. The **key feature** of
this political space is that it **multiplies possibilities for
disagreement**]{.underline}: As Barry argues, '\[t\]he construction of
new forms of transnational governance is [**not based on a stable
infrastructure**, but on an informational infrastructure that
**continues to generate new matters** about which it is **possible to
disagree**]{.underline}'. (2012: 333, Emphasis added). [Assembling the
possibility to disagree, the **infrastructure** of disagreement as well
as its **content**, is the process of **translating distant** and
**particular events**]{.underline} (in both time and space) [into a
**global politics**]{.underline}. While principally an operation of
productive power, [it emerges through **intra-actions** of other powers
as it **draws together** and **modifies other controversies** and
**settlements**]{.underline}.

[This **shifting topology** of powers can be seen in the **co-emergence
of issue framings**, **actor authority**, **forms of evidence**,
**categories** and **distinctions** that serve as **working objects**
around which a politics can emerge]{.underline}. In terms of forms of
evidence, in some fields experimental data and abstract models (e.g.
climate change) or quasi-experimental methods (game theoretic
productions of nuclear deterrence) have become influential of the mode
of disagreement. In early HAC, however, experimental evidence proved
inconclusive and divisive (Prokosch 1995), and for landmines, evidence
derived from experience (of deminers, doctors, and mine victims) was
combined with the ICRC's authority on international law to enable
campaigners to overcome abstract models of military experts with the
testimony of 'compelling spokespersons who could not be easily
dismissed' (Hubert 2000: 31; Borrie 2009). Early [SALW
debates]{.underline}, in the mid-1990s, [established]{.underline}
similar [modes of evidence and authority based on experiential rather
than experimental evidence]{.underline} of abstract modelling. Notably,
however, [these were framed in less oppositional
terms]{.underline}---not least because the inherent lethality of the
weapons themselves was not permitted to become the focus of concern, but
rather their abundance and easy portability enabling illicit flows.
Early researcher engagement sought to distinguish SALW from major
conventional arms both in terms of their categorisation and effects
through case study research focussed on conflict (initially on
Afghanistan, Colombia, Pakistan, and Somalia). These generated evidence
of consequences that resonated with notions of 'flow out of control'
(Krause 2001) and wider geopolitical imaginations centring on failed
state problematiques. Here, however, UN experience and expertise as much
as that of independent researchers and NGOs, produced the dominant
framing as Boutros-Ghali's call for 'micro-disarmament' in his
Supplement to an Agenda for Peace, and reports on Mali and the wider
Sahara-Sahel, consolidated understandings of what count as SALW, and set
out links between security and development, distinctions between illicit
and licit transfers, an emphasis on surplus weapons destruction and
disposal, and marking issues (Krause 2001; Laurance 2014). These
characteristic relationships and distinctions still persist as a
dominant framing.

[The construction of the possibility to disagree is **not an ex-nihilo
creation**]{.underline}, but an assembling and recasting of other
things. [Some]{.underline} studies of norms [argue that]{.underline}
their [**diffusion is shaped** by a **key measure** of]{.underline}
their [legitimacy and strength]{.underline}: that of their **[coherence
with the 'genotype' of existing norms]{.underline}** (Florini 1996:
376). While such claims focus on later diffusion stages of norm
life-cycles, such coherence with genotype is arguably important in
forming the possibility to disagree. For instance, in APM negotiations
coherence with genotypes of International Humanitarian Law produced a
common legal vocabulary for disagreement (Mathur 2012). In SALW, while
Garcia argues that there was 'no previously existing enabling normative
framework' to aid norm diffusion (2006: 23), there were strong genotypes
that were drawn in to form the possibility of disagreement on SALW.
Indeed, it was through such an inheritance that the category of SALW was
produced: The five categories of Major Conventional Arms in the 1980 CFE
treaty were utilised and extended in the seven covered by the 1998 UN
Register of Conventional Arms; SALW became unified as a residual
category in the groups of experts preparing for the 2001 UN Conference
(the PoA contains no definition) and then became a further category for
UN Register reporting in 2003; and the 2013 ATT adopted all eight.

[The principal 'genotype' of the SALW assemblage was a **particular
technocratic practice of expert engagement** and its connection with
**established understandings of sovereignty**. **Sovereignty
sets**]{.underline} the **[limits]{.underline}** of the SALW assemblage
[through **explicit** and **frequent reference** to the **primacy of
the**]{.underline} UN Charter right to self-defence in
**[government]{.underline}** statements, UN documents, etc.,
**[within]{.underline}** the UN SALW process and the subsequent ATT
[**negotiations**. It is also an **operative logic** in which **wider
notions** of sovereign decision-making and effective authorisation
**form the dominant understanding of**]{.underline} the
**[content]{.underline}** of the distinction between licit and illicit
flows. [This demonstrates the **productive power of categories** and
**settled assumptions to establish operative distinctions**, but this
became a **structural power of hegemonic framing**]{.underline}. Indeed,
even NGO and researcher [expert knowledge, with its 'seemingly
progressive categories and concepts']{.underline} (Stavrianakis 2011:
142), [**had to be framed to resonate with**, and **ultimately accept**,
**familiar power-relations** and **reinforce a traditional understanding
of armed violence** and its **management through international
cooperation**, and on the basis of broad assumptions of legitimacy of
arms transfers and the use of force]{.underline} (Borrie 2009; Krause
2011; Rogers 2009).

[In **translating these seemingly settled principles into operative
distinctions**]{.underline} between weapons, status of flows, etc., [the
assemblage also **imports** and **remobilises disagreements**.
Thus]{.underline}, PoA **[debates]{.underline}** over banning or
controlling transfers to non-state actors [**continuously remobilised**
and **reframed wider tensions**]{.underline} between legal principles of
territorial integrity and self-determination. Similarly, tensions
between understandings of sovereignty, and between IHL and existing arms
export deals or defence cooperation agreements produced much
**[debate]{.underline}** and uncomfortable compromises in the
negotiations of the ATT (Hofmann and Wisotzki 2014; McDonald 2013).
Thus, the genotype [**is not a static** and **stable normative
background**, but rather is **mobilised** and **rearticulated** as a
**combination of agreements** and **disagreements enabling proliferating
controversies**]{.underline}.

[Making disagreement possible through the connections and cuts outlined
here **shifts the question of power away from assessing the relative
power possessed by states**]{.underline}, NGOs, IO, and researchers
[towards the ways in which power **emerges through establishing
proximities**]{.underline}, sympathies, through what literature on
expertise calls 'boundary work' (Eyal and Pok 2015). [This locates power
as an **effect of** and **operative within networks of expertise** that
are **themselves powerful**]{.underline}. In the SALW assemblage, forms
of power operative within the possibility to disagree arise particularly
through the circulations and accumulations of information. [Since **the
possibility to disagree is an**]{.underline} informational
[**infrastructure**, it can be argued to be **inherently related** to
the emergence of power]{.underline}, echoing Rose and Miller's argument
that [government **depends** on information being '**transported** and
**accumulated** in locales' which **makes actors powerful** as they can
**claim**]{.underline} '[**legitimacy for their plans** and
**strategies** because they are, in a real sense, **in the know** about
that which they seek to govern']{.underline} (1992: 185). [Such
knowledge and information must be **materialised**, **inscribed**, to be
**durable** and **powerful**, and also to **circulate**. Such
inscriptions]{.underline} may have a life of their own: Numbers, such as
the estimate that there are 900 million small arms in global
circulation, [**do not merely reflect** the power of the researchers
that produce it]{.underline} (the Small Arms Survey (SAS)) [but also
vice versa as experts benefit from the **circulatory power**
of]{.underline} numbers (they are relatively immutable as they move---a
function of their **[universal language]{.underline}**, air of
precision, and affective capacity) (Hansen and Porter 2012).

The centralisation of technical knowledge, information, and legal
authority is often seen as a source of the 'autonomous significance' and
'compulsory power' of International Organisations (whereas the use of
compulsory power by NGOs derives from normative authority in 'shaming'
states) (Barnett and Finnemore 1999; Barnett and Duvall 2005). However,
in the SALW assemblage circulations and accumulations of information
have produced relations of mutual authorisation rather than 'autonomous
significance'. The circulation and accumulation of inscriptions
(numbers, anecdotes, case studies, best practices, draft outcome
documents, etc.) enabled the emergent assemblage of 'sympathetic'
relations of mutual authorisation between researchers, NGOs, particular
states, and the UN. The Small Arms Survey (SAS) has become a central
authority of research expertise (its publications are among the only
sources cited in UN resolutions and documents) by producing and
contracting expert researchers and consolidating and circulating
research outputs into annual yearbooks and a series of other
publications. Conversely, the UN SALW process has shaped the agenda and
contributed to the professionalization of small arms research (Laurance
2014). The influence of the research community has been greatest on
issues that the UN process prioritises (tracing, illicit brokering,
stockpile management) and significantly less on issues of control of
ammunition, regulating civilian possession, and monitoring
implementation that have proven controversial (McDonald 2014).
Similarly, power hierarchies within NGO networks, such as the
International Action Network on Small Arms (IANSA), were significantly
shaped by the UN Process, and those closest to major states and UN
bodies (receiving funding and support for their research and informal
diplomatic activities: such as SAS and the Biting the Bullet project)
gained greatest influence---thereby contributing to framing the agenda
of NGOs in terms of conflict and weak states and downplaying domestic
gun control organisations (Grillot et al. 2006). Some explicit
articulations of these relations of mutual authorisation are also
assertions of institutional power. For instance, upon the adoption of
the ATT in 2013 UN Secretary General Ban Ki-Moon highlighted the
'expertise and enthusiastic support' of NGOs and that it demonstrated
that 'great things that can be achieved when Governments and civil
society work together through the United Nations'. (UN 2013). Such
mutual authorisation is also a feature of anti-control networks.
Anti-control groups such as the US National Rifle Association (NRA),
attempted to discursively connect UN processes concerned principally
with conflict to domestic gun regulation agendas. While the 'facts' of
this connection are not compelling (the PoA contains minimal reference
to civilian possession---due in part to NRA and related campaigning in
the early years), the agenda remains partly shaped by this attempt. This
early campaigning was enhanced by NRA representatives being part of the
official US delegation to the 2001 conference, and drawing from
differing sources of moral and legal authority (Bob 2010).

Overall, [the **actors** and **forms** of power that are important are
**not pre-given** but emerge with the **topology** of an assemblage, in
particular as **expertise** and **authority** and **working objects**
(**categories**, **distinctions**, **forms of evidence**) are
constituted by **forging** or **cutting off particular connections**.
These **constitute the possibility of disagreement**, but this is a
**continuous process**, coexistent with the **circulations** and
**sympathies that make agreement possible** and the **status of
agreement** and **disagreement meaningful**]{.underline}.

#### Debate may be a game, but [games are objects too]{.underline}---sovereign logic has crept [beyond]{.underline} formal arms control policy into [societal relations]{.underline}---what we understand as legitimate positions or evidence is shaped in the moment by how we debate about it---excluding that from the scope of topical inquiry out of hand in favor of limited contestation causes [worse]{.underline} arms control research

**Bourne, 18**---Lecturer in International Security Studies in the
School of Politics, International Studies and Philosophy at Queen's
University Belfast (Mike, "Powers of the gun: process and possibility in
global small arms control," International Politics, May 2018, Volume 55,
Issue 3--4, pp 441--461, dml) \[SALW=small arms and light weapons\]

The SALW process has also been maintained by [shifting between **more
overtly political** and **more technically framed
engagements**]{.underline} that **[may represent structural
power]{.underline}**. After the acrimonious failure of the 2006 Review
Conference, and [amid disappointment that the]{.underline} first round
of meetings in the PoA [process]{.underline} (BMS 2003, BMS 2005, and
2006 Review Conference) [were utilised for basic reporting with no
substantive outcomes]{.underline}, later BMSs adopted **[more
issue-specific foci]{.underline}** on brokering and stockpile management
that [enabled **elaboration of conditions for effective
implementation**]{.underline}. More broadly Panels, Groups, and Meetings
of Governmental Experts feature significantly and have enabled
elaboration of issues such as brokering, ammunition, and the ATT. Such
expert groups have been a creative site of action on issues central to
the PoA but that did not achieve consensus or strong elaboration within
the main process. For instance, while the US consistently blocked the
inclusion of ammunition in the PoA process and expressed scepticism
about a proposal for a separate UN process, the EU and others were able
to support progress on ammunition through a 2008 GGE and parallel
practices of technical standardisation. Further, since 2009 a number of
Open-Ended Meetings of Governmental Experts (MGE) have been convened to
address implementation challenges beyond the cycle of BMS's and Review
Conferences. [Such **shifts of framing** and **focus towards technical
issues**, and thus to parallel political spaces based on **technical
expertise** (**authorised** and **populated by
governments**)]{.underline} rather than full UNGA consensus, [has been
**essential to shifting operations of power** to maintain **coherence**
and **trajectory** of the process]{.underline}.

[A shift to technics]{.underline} should be viewed as a move to a
different constellation of politics rather than entirely depoliticising.
GGEs, for instance, enable greater time for discussion \[BMS's and
Review Conferences include little time for negotiation rather than
formal statements, leading to one estimate that the time available for
negotiation of an outcome document in the 2006 review conference
amounted to 20 hours (Prins 2006)\]. They also [contribute to the
**reinforcing of sovereignty** within the process]{.underline}: GGEs are
formally the preserve of states, though NGO personnel and researchers
have been included in national delegations in both the broad UN process
and the variety of GGEs. Since GGEs are often tasked with [**elaborating
responses** and **assessing feasibility** of the constitution of
regulatory action]{.underline}, this [**shapes which actors may claim
authority on particular questions**: For some]{.underline} NGOs [it is
**principally** questions of the **problem to be solved**; for
others]{.underline} (industry for instance) [it is questions of the
**feasibility of controls**]{.underline} (as in the UN process on
Marking and Tracing small arms, and others). [However, **only
states**]{.underline} (and some inter-governmental organisations)
**[speak with seeming authority on all of these issues]{.underline}**.
Thus, GGEs combine the productive power of expertise, the structural
power of sovereignty, and the institutional power of decision-making
rules. As with the meaning of consensus, within [these
processes]{.underline} what counts as a technical or a political issue
is produced through contestation.

Regime theory and studies of transnational governance [**often assume**
that the development of]{.underline} transnational or international
[governance proceeds through, and has the effect of, **reducing degrees
of disagreement** and **establishing procedures** and **rules** through
which issues are managed]{.underline}. Indeed, this Weberian
rationalisation underlies claims that issue complexity resists regime
formation. [However, 'consensus' is an ambiguous concept whose meaning
and necessity is formed through **powerful controversies** at **multiple
scales**. The SALW assemblage, then, is not simply a site of
homogenisation but the formation of a '**shifting surface** on which
disputes can **foment** and **acquire significance**']{.underline}
(Barry 2012: 328).

Making action possible and guns governable: modes of action and the
proliferation of objects for cooperation

[It is **common** to think that there **must be agreement before
action**. How, then, is this **shifting topology of proliferating
disagreements**, **emergent powers**, and **partial stabilisations
productive of governing guns**?]{.underline} The classic problem of
action at a distance comes into play here as it underlies taxonomies of
powers (Barnett and Duvall 2005), regime theory and studies of SALW. The
question of how the SALW assemblage makes guns governable is often
engaged through questions about norm diffusion (Garcia 2006). Thus, it
is argued that some norms---such as surplus weapons disposal through
destruction rather than export---gain 'independent momentum' (Karp 2008:
77) while others change as they move, with change being a function of
local resistance and reformulation (Capie 2008) or the context specific
ways in which they enter complex contestations about state-society
relations (Tholens 2013). This literature captures dimensions of the
diversity and mutability of SALW 'norms', but what constitutes their
stability? How are they translated into forms of action on guns? I argue
that [norms are **not just ideas** that are **agreed** and then
**diffused** since]{.underline}, as Walters (2002: 92) notes, ['ideas
are **not always strong enough** or **persistent enough**' to produce
actions. Rather they are **materialised**, **translated in sets of
practices**. The SALW assemblage **cannot be** the triumph of an idea,
nor **only** the creation of a set of 'norms', but **must be** a set of
**materialised practices** that compose particular modes of
action]{.underline}.

As Krause argues, [contemporary arms control]{.underline}---particularly
in HAC and SALW control---[is a **hybrid** of sovereignty and
governmentality in which the agendas of arms control have extended
**beyond the interstate** into **state--society relationships**. In
doing so]{.underline}, he argues, [it draws on '**well-established
understandings of what is involved in controlling arms** (sovereignty),
while **deploying the logic** (and **practices**) of governmentality to
regulate a **fundamental aspect** of the relationship between states and
their citizens']{.underline}. (2011: 32). [This is **often
depoliticising**, and]{.underline} indeed [operates]{.underline} in part
[by **denying** and **obscuring** its own political nature]{.underline}.
Indeed, it is something of a paradox that [the most obviously political
implications of SALW control are often achieved through anti-political
forms of technocratic engagement. This is partly explained by the
emphasis on a **particular logic of governing** in the SALW assemblage:
that of **risk**. Risk has become the **dominant governmental logic of
action** throughout HAC]{.underline}, though it takes very different
forms. When HAC centres on the weapon itself, it has tended to adopt a
precautionary approach that leads to clear prohibitions for APM and
Cluster Munitions. However, as an effect of the genotype and forms of
power of the SALW assemblage, a permissive logic predominates for small
arms: focussing on the illicit trade, or enacting some limited grounds
for prohibition and restraint on the basis of 'overriding risk' in the
ATT. [This permissive logic **channels action into risk management**
through ensuring the governability of weapons stocks and
flows]{.underline} (through stockpile management, marking and tracing,
DDR etc.) [while **reinforcing sovereign decision** and **systems** of
trade and use]{.underline}.

### \--AT: TVA

#### The topical version doesn't solve---putting the [rules themselves]{.underline} up for debate is good

**Bryant, 8**---professor of Philosophy at Collin College and Chair of
the Critical Philosophy program at the New Centre for Research and
Practice (Levi, "Of Games and Rendering Alternatives Available,"
<https://larvalsubjects.wordpress.com/2008/11/17/of-games-and-rendering-alternatives-available/>,
dml)

In what sense is this to be understood as the true victory? After all,
[the simple fact that the enemy is using your "language" **does not
count as much of a victory** if the **structure of power remains the
same**]{.underline}. However, perhaps we can understand Žižek's point in
terms of making alternatives available, of [**creating possibilities**
within the social space that **were not there before**]{.underline}.

This thesis [can be illustrated in terms of **games**]{.underline}. For
the last thirty years it could be said that [the
**reigning**]{.underline} economic **[assumption]{.underline}** behind
American politics has been that of Friedmanian, unregulated, free trade
economics. The net result [is that **all sides engaged in**]{.underline}
economic **[discussions surrounding the political assume this framework
as the ground of their policy proposals]{.underline}**. Here [**only one
option is available** and **participants take stands within the
framework of this set of rules**]{.underline}. The situation is thus
analogous to a game of chess. [Within a **game**]{.underline} of chess,
**[the rules themselves aren't up for debate]{.underline}** or
discussion. Rather, [the rules are themselves **agreed upon** and
**remain largely invisible** for the players. If a debate does take
place, this debate takes place **not in terms of a dispute over the
rules of the game**, but over the **tactics** as to **how best play the
game within the framework of those rules**]{.underline}. Such has been
the case with non-academic political discourses in the United States.

[A shift in the game thus **does not occur** at the level of a **single
game**, but only when an **entirely new game** becomes available,
**challenging the discourse** of the existing game]{.underline}. In this
regard, Republicans made a strategic blunder when they chose to brand
Obama as a socialist during the last election. In situating Obama as a
socialist within the context of the current economic meltdown, they
implicitly suggested that another game, another set of possibilities was
possible. Rather than simply suggesting that Obama plays the game of
chess (neoliberal economics) poorly, they instead suggested that Obama
plays an entirely different game, perhaps go, composed of entirely
different rules (socialism). In making this move, they undermined their
own claim, built up painstakingly over the course of economics, that
capitalism today reigns supreme and there are no other credible
alternatives.

My suggestion here isn't that Obama is a socialist or that he will
depart from neoliberal economic policies (I'm skeptical). Rather, what I
find interesting is that news shows, editorials, and various pundits are
suddenly raising questions of whether unfettered capitalism is the best
possible system. What we increasingly hear today is a popular space in
which capitalism is being contested or questioned, and a halting groping
towards other possibilities is unfolding. [**It is only when the game
itself becomes an object of critique**, when it comes to be seen as
**contingent** or **something that could be otherwise**, that it becomes
possible to **overturn that game**. Absent that we simply have
**competing tactics** within one and the same game, assuming the **same
rules**, **goals**, and **aims**]{.underline}.

### 2AC Robot Historian Good

#### The robot historian employs [inductive]{.underline} logic that [pumps truth up]{.underline} from evidence of a problem to a [multiplicity of plans]{.underline} to solve it---we can ignore the demons in the machine and give them more control over the world, or we can learn to work with them---so they can learn to work with us in return.

[Although independent software objects may have different designs and
names]{.underline} (actors, objects, production rules, antecedent
theorems, if-added methods, demons, servants, etc.), for our purposes
[we may call them all alike \"demons\" and the space they create a
\"**Pandemonium.\"**]{.underline}62 In this scheme [control is never
passed from a higher authority to a lesser authority]{.underline}.
**[There are no hierachical levels, but only a heterarchy of demons
capturing control whenever they are invoked into action.]{.underline}**
[This scheme allows the data base]{.underline} (or patterns in it) [to
control the flow of computation]{.underline}. If the patterns in the
data base reflect changes in the outside world, then [demons allow the
world itself to control computational processes, and this, as I said, is
what allows a robot to respond to changes in the world]{.underline}. The
Pandemonium represents the current stage in the long process of
migration of control which Jacquard started by effecting a transfer from
the human body to the machine. But [robots in general and robotic
weapons in particular need more than flexible control schemes in order
to adapt to changing circumstances: they need problem-solving abilities
of their own]{.underline}. Sophisticated computer schemes such as the
[Pandemonium allow human programmers to optimize hardware resources
through simulation]{.underline}, but in essence the scope of their
action remains under human control - much as a word processor, while it
is an abstract typewriter, nonetheless relies on a human typist. A[nd
while it might seem obvious that the next step is an abstract typist or,
more generally, an abstract worker, that is not in fact the
case]{.underline}. [Rather than perpetuating the man/machine dichotomy,
and abstracting now the initiativeless tool, then the human controller,
the next step is to merge the two into an abstract man-machine
assemblage]{.underline}. This would be the mind of a robot. **[To
adequately trace the evolution of robot minds, we must understand a few
things about the history of logic]{.underline}**. I mentioned before
that a logical calculus may be seen as a system of conveyor belts that
transport truth from one sentence to another. [Deductive systems have a
relatively easy job]{.underline} : [they need to transport truth from a
general principle]{.underline} ( axiom[) to a particular
fact]{.underline} (theorem). I[nductive systems, on the other hand, have
a much harder task. They must \"pump\" truth up from a particular piece
of evidence]{.underline} (\"This emerald is green\") [to a general
principle applying to a whole class of things]{.underline} (\"All
emeralds are green\"). The problem of mechanizing inductive conveyor
belts is equivalent to building a machine that can learn from
experience. And this is, of course, just what is needed to create
autonomous weapon systems. Thus, [the design of an \"inference engine,\"
to use the technical term, capable of performing inductive
inferences]{.underline} (pumping truth up from particular to general
statements) [is at the center of robotics research]{.underline}.
Although such machines do not exist at present, [AI research has
produced a series of simulations of such mechanized inductive
calculi.]{.underline} [The basic idea is to start with a simple
deductive calculus]{.underline} (capable of transporting truth
\"downward\") [and create a way of pumping truth up inside of
them.]{.underline} [Truth flows naturally from axioms to theorems, that
is, given a general truth a simple machine can draw many conclusions
from it]{.underline}. The opposite operation, proving the theorem can be
deduced from an axiom, is much harder to achieve. Much harder but not
impossible. And i[f we could manage to pump truth up from a theorem to
an axiom we would have a primitive inductive calculus]{.underline}, [the
beginning of true machine intelligence]{.underline}. The computer
language the Japanese chose for the development of their Fifth
Generation of computers, PROLOG, is based on such a scheme. It embodies
a deductive calculus (Frege\'s predicate calculus), together with
recipes for proving theorems in that calculus. [Just as the evolution of
control structures may be seen as a mutation from sequential to parallel
forms of computation, so can the evolution of robotic intelligence be
pictured in such terms]{.underline}. [Theorem-proving represents the
sequential stage in robotic problem solving]{.underline}. At this stage
[problem-solving abilities are modeled by the task of pumping truth up
from the theorems to the axioms]{.underline}. [Other activities, like
the intelligent answering of questions, are treated as special cases of
theorem proving]{.underline}. A question posed by a human, for example,
is treated as a formula whose validity must be established; [finding a
proof for the theorem is used as a model for the activity of reaching a
satisfactory answer]{.underline}. [The task of proving theorems may be
reduced to a single rule of inference]{.underline} (the resolution
principle) [which refutes the negation of a theorem by mechanically
searching for contradictions]{.underline}.63 The uniformity and elegance
of a single problem- solving strategy, however, is paid for with a lack
of versatility to adapt to new situations. [A more parallel scheme may
be achieved by embedding rules of inference into demons.]{.underline}
Demons add flexibility to the sequential task of piecing together a line
of reasoning to take us from the truth of a particular assertion to some
general assertion stored in the data base. [A program using demons may
generate several strategic plans for the achievement of a given
goal]{.underline}, whether the latter is pictured as proving a theorem,
or more generally, as modifying a world model until it satisfies a
stated condition. For instance, to make robots walk, a world model
inside the robot may represent its body in the different positions
needed to achieve locomotion. The goal of an intelligent program here is
to perform action synthesis, that is, to generate a sequence of demon
operations that can take the robot from an initial state to a desired
final position. **[Theorem-proving allows robots to solve problems, but
only to the extent that the problems are modeled by the operation of
pumping truth up from a particular piece of data to a general principle
stored in a data base]{.underline}**. Although many kinds of robotic
actions may be so modeled[, theorem-proving forces robots to approach
many different problems using basically the same strategy]{.underline}.
[By switching from theorem-proving to a Pandemonium robots become
capable of generating different strategic approaches to a given problem
according to the specific nature of the problem.]{.underline}
Furthermore, [recent implementations of this approach allow robots to
produce plans of attack at different levels of abstraction, allowing
them to achieve optimal results without getting bogged down by
**irrelevant data**.]{.underline} A global strategic approach is first
roughed out by the program, suppressing as much detail as possible and
working out only the major steps of the plan. Only then is attention
focused on more detailed subgoals. But even this flexible approach,
exemplified by programs like HACKER and ABSTRIPS, break down a given
problem into a series of actions to be performed in a rigid sequence.
[The implementation of parallelism in robotic \"mind\" design involves a
very specific scheme for the deployment of demons:]{.underline} The
planning abilities of ABSTRIPS, effective though they are in many cases,
are not sufficiently powerful to find the optimal solution to those
problems in which there is interaction between the preconditions and
effects of the subgoals identified by the high level plan . . . . [The
essential reason is that these programs employ linear planning
strategies that assume that the subgoals are additive. Additive subgoals
may be achieved one after the other]{.underline} . . . . \[By contrast,
in the program NOAH) the initial plan at each level is nonlinear: [it
does not specify temporal order for the subgoals, but represents them
merely as logical conjuncts to be achieved \"in
parallel]{.underline}.\"64

#### Robotic mechanical mind is composed of the migration from humans to hardware to software to data that is the origin of autonomous weapon systems -- the only way to tap into future behavior is identifying specific attributes of the non-organic life

Finally, in the last three decades research in Artificial Intelligence
has revealed that, in order to create more human-like programs, the
control of a given process must not reside in a master program, but in
the very data that master program works on. [We may think of the
\"mind\" of a robot as consisting of the data base in which the external
world is represented through \"sensors\" that reflect changes in the
outside world]{.underline} - in short, **[the migration of control from
programs to data permits external events to trigger internal
processes]{.underline}**. When this degree of dispersion of control is
achieved through \"demons,\" we could say that [the machine has acquired
a \"mind\" of its own]{.underline}. But can robots really have a mind?
There is no direct answer to this question. All [we can]{.underline} do
is [establish certain criteria for machine intelligence, and see if real
robots meet those criteria]{.underline}. In 1950 Alan Turing proposed
his test for determining the intelligence of machines that was basically
an acting test. Place a human and a computer in separate rooms and let a
second human try to decide which is which through a session of questions
and answers. If the computer can fool the human interrogator then it
must be said to have at least a primitive form of intelligence. But
[this simple test must be revised in the light of many recent AI
programs that are based on a repertoire of canned answers,]{.underline}
which manage nevertheless to fool human users into attributing beliefs
and desires to them. A case in point is a program named ELIZA. As its
astonished inventor said, \"ELIZA created the most remarkable illusion
of having understood \[a conversation\] in the minds of the many people
who conversed with it.\" When subjects were told that the program was
simply using canned answer-templates, and had never really interacted
with them, they would not only disregard these explanations but \"would
often demand to converse with the system in private.\"53 It is obvious
that [we cannot take these reactions as landmarks of the emergence of a
\"mechanical mind]{.underline}.\" We may have to strengthen the Turing
test by adding that people should not only ascribe beliefs and desires
to a machine but also a tendency to act on those beliefs and desires.
For example[, in the case of a chess-playing computer, when we ascribe
beliefs to the machine we expect it to base its playing strategy on
those beliefs]{.underline}. In fact when human players ascribe beliefs
to chess-playing computers they do so not because they think the machine
actually has beliefs, but because belief ascriptions are a way of
organizing the machine\'s past behavior to allow predictions about the
machine,s future behavior. **[Which specific beliefs one attributes to
the computer make all the difference in the world as far as the
prediction of its future behavior is concerned]{.underline}**. In the
case of ELIZA, on the other hand, it does not seem to make any
difference which specific set of beliefs we attribute to the machine as
long as we grant it intentionality in general. Let us examine the
example of chess-playing computers a little closer. When we play against
a slow machine, a machine that takes, say, ten hours to make a move, we
do not confront the machine face-to-face, so to speak. We may still view
it as a clever contraption that can be outsmarted indirectly via logical
considerations of its internal design. Everything changes, however, as
soon as the machine begins to play in real time, that is, as fast or
faster than a human. At that point we have no choice but to confront the
machine as an opponent on the chessboard by attributing to it beliefs
and desires of its own. In other words when machines play i n real time
we cannot afford to frame our strategies with questions like \"The
machine made that move because of such-and-such feature of its internal
logic.\" Instead, we must begin to relate to the machine\'s strategies
with questions like \"It believes I moved my bishop here to pin its
queen, when my real reason is . . .\" or \"The machine wants to force
the game to a draw\" and so on. In short we must attribute beliefs and
desires to the machine or lose the game. To use the technical term, the
machine forces us to adopt the \"intentional stance\" toward it.54 [We
may choose to adopt the intentional stance with respect to
anything]{.underline}, as when we say of a plant that it will grow
around a corner because it is \'\'searching for light.\" But [only in
adversarial relations, as in the hunting of large, intelligent animals,
is the intentional stance forced on us]{.underline}. [We have to plan
our traps and choose our hiding places in order to induce false beliefs
in the animal, that is, we must treat it as an intentional system or
fail i n our enterprise]{.underline}. [In adversarial situations, being
forced to treat a machine as an intentional system may be considered as
a good criterion for mechanical intelligence]{.underline}. In the case
of predatory machines, [not only would we have to fight them on the
\"intentional plane\" but we may also assume that they would treat us,
their prey, as predictable assemblages of beliefs and
desire]{.underline}s. [It would be]{.underline}, then, [a clash of
\"minds\" or of \"rational wills.\"]{.underline} Outside an adversarial
relationship, however, **[it becomes increasingly difficult to
distinguish situations in which the machine forces on us the intentional
stance from those in which we adopt this stance seduced by some clever
simulation]{.underline}**. When we move away from chess playing into
more general areas of mechanical problem-solving we must refine our
criterion for intelligent behavior. For example, in the area of expert
systems, [robotic advisers that work on a very specific field of
expertise, the test for intelligence should be carried out by experts in
that field]{.underline}. [If those human experts agree that the advise
given by the machine is sound]{.underline}, and furthermore, [that the
machine was capable of explaining its line of reasoning, we should
probably ascribe to the machine the st_atus of an intelligent
system]{.underline}. 55 [We have seen that one of the factors that will
give robots a \"mind\" of their own is a dispersal of control from a
master program to the objects in a data base]{.underline}. **[This
migration of control from humans to hardware]{.underline},** **[from
hardware to software, and from software to data is at the source of
machine intelligence, and thus at the origin of autonomous weapons
systems]{.underline}**. Put another way, the transition from the
Aristotelian syllogism to the Boolean calculus can be seen as an
instance of the clockwork to motor mutation. For the two millennia when
clockworks represented the dominant technology on the planet, people
assembled their machines (armies, scientific theories, logical
notations) following the model of a geared mechanism. The syllogism may
be pictured as a logical \"musical box\" or a toy automaton : a small
machine capable of transmitting motion (or truth) along a predetermined
path. A motor, on the other hand, is capable of producing motion, not
just transmitting it, so the calculus invented by Boole is a logical
motor able to produce new truths by calculation.

### 2AC Impact---Drones

#### The dronification of state violence makes extinction from [AI revolution]{.underline} inevitable

**Hughes, 17**---The Globe Post, citing University of California at
Berkeley Law Professor Christopher Kutz, University of Chichester
Professor of Critical Theory Benjamin Noys, University of Utah Professor
of Law Wayne McCormack, and Johns Hopkins University Professor and
military historian Michael Vlahos (Michael, "Drone Metaphysics in the
Age of Trump,"
<https://theglobepost.com/2017/09/29/us-drone-use-trump/>, dml)

[While policy and legal implications of drone warfare have been **hotly
debated**]{.underline} for years, [less explored has been how it
**impacts society at large**]{.underline} -- members of the society
doing the targeting that is -- [including how it affects our **values**,
**identities**, even our **very souls**.]{.underline}

[Many Americans, for example, seem to **accept** or **willfully ignore
the consequences** of drone strikes in faraway lands]{.underline}.
Meanwhile Afghans, especially in the tribal areas, likely view this
remote long-distance mode of warfare as cowardly.

[This]{.underline}, coupled with civilian deaths, [can force the U.S and
its allies to **lose the moral high ground** to groups like the
**Taliban**]{.underline}, of all people.

University of Chichester Professor of Critical Theory Benjamin Noys told
The Globe Post that lack of public concern over drone warfare might have
something to do with identification with "our" troops -- be it U.S. or
U.K. -- versus a "racialized" enemy.

In addition, he speculated, [discourses of **safety** and
**protection**]{.underline} likely [**override moral concerns** when it
comes to drones]{.underline}.

"In the age of a highly-technological and often outsourced military I
think [there is a general acceptance of **technological
fixes**]{.underline}," Noys added. "And [avoidance of casualties for
'us' has become **central**]{.underline}."

[In addition]{.underline} to the ethical and moral dilemmas raised in
destroying vulnerable countries [are **existential concerns** --
including the prospect of the machine **turning on its
creator**]{.underline}.

University of Utah Professor of Law Wayne McCormack told The Globe Post
that ever since David used a slingshot against Goliath, humankind has
struggled with the ethics of [technological developments]{.underline}.
Going beyond ethics, however, he noted how such advancements [can
**threaten our very existence**]{.underline}.

"There are [many knowledgeable people]{.underline} who [say that
artificial intelligence will **inevitably overtake humans' ability to
control it**]{.underline}," Mr. McCormack said. "I doubt that 'The
Matrix' could become reality before humans become extinct for other
reasons, but I don't bet on any future predictions, my own or others."

[Because of cyber capabilities]{.underline}, for example, [the
infrastructure of an entire nation can be **destroyed with the push of a
button**]{.underline}, he added.

"[Could the machine **push the button itself**?]{.underline}" McCormack
asked. "I have no idea why my electronic gadgets do some of the things
they do, so [**how can we know** whether one of them will **take its own
destructive course** at some point?]{.underline} Can we stop it?"

The Dr. Frankensteins of social media, he added, will also have to see
if they can control their creations.

"I don't think the gadgets can change who we are, but **[we have to be
the ones in control of our values]{.underline}**," the Utah law
professor said. "That question has disturbed every warfare observer for
thousands of years. Sun Tzu and the Book of Manu worried about this in
past millennia. That fact alone tells me that the moral questions
persist in the face of rapid technological change."

Johns Hopkins University Professor and military historian Michael Vlahos
believes that [our reliance on UAVs presents a **moral hazard** that, if
**continually exploited**, will **come back to haunt us**.]{.underline}

"As for [the drone]{.underline}, it [sucks us into a future in which we
find ourselves **killing anyone on the planet who annoys
us**]{.underline} -- an Olympian perch that is corrupt as the Gods in
the Greek Pantheon themselves," Vlahos told The Globe Post.

### 2AC Impact---Ethics/Anthro

#### Ethical relationships centered around humanity inevitably fail and delegitimize our value as rational beings

Lucas D. **Introna**, 20**09**, Theory, Culture & Society, \"Ethics and
the Speaking of Things\" // NCMD

In the ethics of hybrids [our ethical relationship with
things]{.underline} is determined beforehand by us, it [is
anthropocentric]{.underline}. In this encounter with things [we
have]{.underline} already [chosen]{.underline}, or presumed, [the
framework of values that will count in determining moral
significance]{.underline}. [In this ethics, things are always and
already 'things-for-us' -- objects for our use, in our terms, for our
purposes.]{.underline} They are always inscribed with our intentionality
-- they carry it in their flesh, as it were. [The defining measure of
the ethics of hybrids is the human being]{.underline} -- the meaning of
the Latin root of 'man' is measure. Indeed our concern for things is
what they might do to us humans, as was suggested above. [Our concern is
not our instrumental use of them, the violence of our inscriptions in/on
them, but that such scripts may ultimately harm us]{.underline}. As
things-for-us, or '[objects']{.underline} as we will refer to them, they
[have no moral significance as such]{.underline}. In the value hierarchy
of the modern ethical mind they are very far down the value line. What
could be less morally significant than an inanimate object? [Their moral
significance is only a derivative of the way they may circulate the
network as inscriptions for utility]{.underline} or enrolment. For
example, they may become valuable if they can be sold in a market where
they are valued, as is the case with works of art. The magnitude and
diversity of our projects are mirrored in the magnitude and diversity of
the objects that surround us. [As things-for-us they are at our disposal
-- if they fail to be useful, or when our projects drift or shift, we
'dump' them. Images of endless 'scrap' heaps at the edges of our cities
abound. Objects are made/inscribed, used and finally dumped. We can
dispose of them because we author-ized them in the first place.
Increasingly we design them in such a way that we can dispose of them as
effortlessly as possible. Ideally, their demise must be as invisible as
possible. Their entire moral claim on our conscience is naught, it
seems. One can]{.underline} legitimately [ask why should we concern
ourselves with things in a world where the ethical landscape
is]{.underline} already [overcrowded with]{.underline} grave and
pressing matters such as untold [human suffering]{.underline},
disappearing bio - diversity and ozone layers -- to name but a few. It
is our argument that **[our moral indifference to so many supposedly
significant beings]{.underline}** (humans, animals, nature, etc.)
**[starts with the idea that there are some beings that are less
significant or not significant at all]{.underline}**. More originally it
starts with a metaphysics that has as its centre -- the ultimate measure
-- us human beings -- a metaphysics which has been at the heart of
Western philosophy ever since Plato (Heidegger, 1977a). Thus, [when we
start our moral ordering we tend to value more highly things like
us]{.underline} (sentient, organic/natural, alive, etc.) [and less
highly]{.underline}, or not at all, [things most alien to
us]{.underline} (non-sentient, synthetic/artificial, inanimate, etc.).
It is our argument that one of the reasons why **[this anthropocentric
ethics of things fails is because it assumes that we can, both in
principle and in practice, draw a definitive boundary between the
objects (them) and us]{.underline}**. Social studies of science and
technology have thrown severe doubt on such a possibility. [If it
is]{.underline} increasingly [difficult to draw the boundary between our
objects and us, and if]{.underline} in [this entangled network of humans
and non-humans objects lack moral significance from the start, then it
is]{.underline} rather [a small step to take for an ethics to emerge in
which all things]{.underline} -- human and non-human alike -- [circulate
as objects]{.underline}: 'things-for-the-purposes-of' the network. [In
ordering society as assemblages of humans and objects we ultimately also
become ordered as a 'for-the-purposes-of'.]{.underline} Thus, **[the
irony of an anthropocentric ethics of things is that]{.underline}**
ultimately **[we also become 'objects']{.underline}** in programmes and
scripts, **[at the disposal of a higher logic]{.underline}** (capital,
state, community, environment, etc.). In the network, [others and our
objects 'objectify' us]{.underline}. For example, I cannot get my money
out from the bank machine because I forgot my PIN number. Until I
identify myself in its terms (as a five digit number) I am of no
significance to it. Equally, if I cannot prove my identity by presenting
inscribed objects (passport, drivers licence) I cannot get a new PIN
number. In Heidegger's (1977b) words [we have]{.underline} all [become
'standing reserve']{.underline}, on 'stand by' [for the purposes of the
network]{.underline} -- enframed (Gestell) by the calculative logic of
our way of being. Enframed in a global network that has as its logic to
control, manipulate and dominate: '**[Enframing is the gathering
together which belongs to that setting-upon which challenges man and
puts him in position to reveal the actual, in the mode of ordering, as
standing-reserve']{.underline}** (Heidegger, 1977a: 305). [The value
hierarchy presumed in an anthropocentric ethics is in fact a dynamic
network of values and interests -- there never was a
hierarchy]{.underline}. **[The fate of our objects becomes our
fate.]{.underline}** In the ethics of hybrids [we are also already
objects]{.underline} -- indeed [everything is already object. Instead of
a hierarchy of values we find a complete nihilism in which everything is
levelled out, everything is potentially equally
valuable/valueless]{.underline}; a nihilistic network in which 'the
highest values devaluate themselves' (Nietzsche, 1967: 9). If this is
so, then we would argue that we should not 'extend' our moral
consideration to other things, such as inanimate objects -- in a similar
manner that we have done for animals and other living things, in
environmental ethics for example. In other words **[we should
not]{.underline}** simply **[extend the reach of what is considered
morally significant to include more things. Rather, we should abandon
all systems of moral valuing and admit]{.underline}**, with Heidegger,
that in 'the characterisation of something as "a value" what is so
valued is robbed of its worth' and admit that 'what a thing is in its
Being is not exhausted by its being an object, particularly when
objectivity takes the form of value', furthermore, that 'every valuing,
even where it values positively, is a subjectivising' (Heidegger, 1977a:
228). **[We must abandon ethics for a clearing beyond ethics -- to let
beings be in their own terms.]{.underline}** We must admit that **[any
attempt at humanistic moral ordering -- be it egocentric,
anthropocentric, biocentric]{.underline}** (Goodpaster, 1978; Singer,
1975) or **[even ecocentric]{.underline}** (Leopold, 1966; Naess, 1995)
-- **[will fail]{.underline}**. [Any ethics based on us will eventually
turn everything into our image, pure will to power]{.underline}
(Heidegger, 1977a, 1977b). As Lingis (1994: 9) suggests: 'The man-made
species we are, which produces its own nature in an environment it
produces, finds nothing within itself that is alien to itself, opaque
and impervious to its own understanding' (emphasis added). Instead of
creating value systems in our own image, [the]{.underline} absolute
[otherness of every other should be the only moral imperative. We need
an ethics of things that is beyond the self-identical-ness of human
beings]{.underline}. Such an ethics beyond metaphysics needs as its
'ground' not a system for comparison, but rather a recognition of the
impossibility of any comparison -- [every comparison is already violent
in its attempt to render equal what could never be equal]{.underline}
(Levinas, 1991 \[1974\]). How might we encounter the other in its
otherness? Levinas (1991 \[1974\], 1996, 1999) has argued for the
radical singularity of our fellow human beings. But what about all other
others? In the next section we will argue that Heidegger, especially as
presented in the work of Harman (2002, 2005), might provide us with some
hints towards the overcoming of ethics, towards an ethos of letting-be
of all beings.

#### The aff is an [ethos]{.underline}, not an [ethics]{.underline}---that overcomes human-centricity

Lucas D. **Introna**, 20**09**, Theory, Culture & Society, \"Ethics and
the Speaking of Things\" // NCMD\
\
[The move beyond ethics]{.underline} (a system of values based on a
metaphysics of human will to power) [is]{.underline} for Heidegger -- as
it is for Latour -- [the move beyond the dichotomies of freedom and
nature]{.underline}, ought and is. 7 In his essay 'Letter on Humanism',
Heidegger suggests that [we should return to the more original meaning
of ethics.]{.underline} Translating a Heraclitus fragment, he proposes
that [ethos originally 'means abode, dwelling place]{.underline}. The
word names the open region in which man \[all beings\] dwells' (in
Heidegger, 1977a: 233). For Heidegger **[ethos (rather than ethics) is
not a relationship of humans towards other beings in which the other is
valued (or not) but rather a way of dwelling where being may be
encountered, an openness towards the Being of beings]{.underline}**
(Zimmerman, 1983). This **[ethos of dwelling means to cultivate and to
care for the being of beings]{.underline}** (Heidegger, 1971a: 147). For
Heidegger this ethos of dwelling is intimately connected to his notion
of freedom where freedom is taken as an act of 'letting be' which seeks
to let the other be as other. [Dwelling is a form of cultivating and
care]{.underline}, but what is cultivated and cared for is 'letting be'.
Heidegger calls this letting be Gelassenheit (often translated as
releasement). [Gelassenheit is the abandonment of]{.underline} that
[representational and calculative thinking]{.underline} (or comportment)
[by which human beings dispose of things as this or that
being]{.underline}. [This]{.underline} giving up of the assumed lordship
over beings -- so central to the rational scientific human way of being
-- [opens the possibility for the entry into the ethos of letting be:
'man is not the lord of beings. Man is the shepherd of
Being']{.underline} (1977a: 221). Through the cultivation of
Gelassenheit[: we silence habitual and calculative modes of thinking and
open ourselves to the promptings that come from the ontological depth of
other beings. This openness clears a space for the Being of the other to
emerge as it is in itself . . . preserving the other's irreducible
otherness]{.underline}. (Carey, 2000: 27--8) How do we enter the
clearing of letting-be without turning the otherness of the other into a
'thing-for-me' as this or that useful tool or object? Heidegger suggests
as a hint that this possibility is to be found in a poetic comportment
-- but one must also immediately say that such a comportment is a
profound aporia, an impossible possibility. [The poet 'names all things
in that which they are']{.underline}. This poetic comportment cannot be
willed since willing only reinforces the gravity of the will to power.
Rather, [the poet listens, waits and lets the disclosive event
be]{.underline} -- one could almost say, following Levinas, as a
visitation. [This waiting and listening]{.underline} of Gelassenheit
[lies beyond the ordinary distinction between activity and passivity; it
is an undoing rather than a willing]{.underline}. **[The ethos of
Gelassenheit is an ethos of active and ongoing passivity, accepting by
letting-go]{.underline}**. As Ziarek explains: [Lettingness is neither
simply a human act nor a fate that humans accept and allow to be.
Rather, letting has to be conceived in the middle voice beyond activity
and passivity, the middle voice into which relations can be
let]{.underline}. This letting, while not entirely at human disposition
or will, needs to be worked on. . . . Lassen does not mean that humans
transform being, that they enforce or make this transformation. Rather,
it indicates that [being transforms itself but cannot do so 'on its
own', without human engagement, without human letting]{.underline}.
(2002: 182) The poetic disclosure of being in the eventing of the
fourfold is immediately and wholly imminent, self-sufficient and
meaningful; no representation is necessary, only letting-be. It
discloses being in an event wholly 'otherwise than the will to power'
(Ziarek, 2002: 183). How might one enter this ethos of Gelassenheit?
Heidegger (1971a: 215) suggests that: 'Poetry first causes dwelling to
be dwelling. [Poetry is what really lets us dwell]{.underline}.' [If
poetry causes dwelling then one might ask about the possibility of a
poetry of things or a poetic dwelling with things]{.underline}. In this
regard we will suggest two very small gestures towards such an
impossible possibility; the [first we will call 'things as poets'
(things naming us) and the second the 'poetry of things' (our letting
things be).]{.underline}

### 2AC Method---Cyborg

#### Take this time to mess around and become a cyborg, in the name of understanding your relationship with the nonhuman, as a study of the transgressive blend between humans and technology. Only by becoming a cyborg can we effectively challenge the flawed epistemologies of arms sales policy and regain our mastery over machinery.

**Van der Wagen 18**(Wytske, The Cyborgian Deviant: An Assessment of the
Hacker through the lens of Actor-Network Theory, Journal of Qualitative
Criminal Justice and Criminology, Volume 6, No.2, 2018)adi

Actor-network theory (ANT) can be regarded as a constructivist and
critical approach that explicitly assigns a more active role to
non-humans (e.g., technologies, objects, animals) in the course of
(inter) action (Latour 1992, 2005). Actor-network theory does not
consider humans and non-humans as two separate agents or entities, but
speaks of heterogeneous alliances or hybrid collectives of both (Latour
1993; Van der Wagen & Pieters, 2015; Verbeek 2005). In this respect,
there is a clear parallel with the more familiar notion of the "cyborg,"
the term that is also used in this study. [The term cyborg, short for
"cybernetic organism," was introduced in the 1960s as a term for
"artifact-organisms" or "man-machine systems" in the context of space
travel (see Clynes & Kline, 1960)]{.underline}. [The cyborg signified
the idea that the human body could be extended with technological
artifacts in order to accomplish greater things and/or to explore new
frontiers, a theme that we can obviously find in many science fiction
movies]{.underline}. [In her Cyborg Manifesto (1987), Donna Haraway used
the cyborg figure as a metaphor to overcome the boundaries or
dichotomies between science and (science) fiction, human and animal,
organism and machine, and physical and non-physical, which she perceived
as Western dualisms that lie underneath the "logics and practices of
domination of women, people of colour, nature, workers \[and\]
animals"]{.underline} (Haraway, 1987, p. 32). [Hence, she presented the
cyborg figure not exclusively as a physical melt]{.underline} 162 VAN
DER [WAGEN of humans and technology, but much more as a post-human3
metaphor for questioning the extent in which we are human or
technological]{.underline} ("constructed") (see Verbeek, 2008). [This
particular interpretation of the cyborg figure we can also find in ANT's
notion of the "hybrid," which not only seeks to abandon dualistic modes
of thinking, but also offers a framework that can grasp the various ways
in which the blend of the human and the technical can concretely take
shape.]{.underline} We can roughly distinguish three main ways in which
ANT defines the cyborgian relationship between the human and the
technical. [First, ANT presumes that interactions between humans and
non-humans are not only functional (e.g., when we write, we have to use
a pen and paper), but are also intertwined and shape one another's
actions]{.underline}. To give a concrete example, driving a car is seen
as a performance of the driver and the car since both enable and
complete the action: The driver needs to have the skills and the car the
functionality to drive (see also Dant, 2004). [This dimension closely
resembles the original meaning of the cyborg, the notion that the tool
enhances or augments the bodily functions of the human (]{.underline}see
also Suarez, 2015; Wells, 2014)[. Driving also involves an interaction
between the driver and the car and a process in which the driver has to
gain control over the car.]{.underline} Humans consciously experience
both of these aspects when they have to learn to drive, and both change
or partly disappear once they are able to drive.4 [Accordingly, for ANT,
the relationship between humans and non-humans is not merely and
continuously one of master and slave]{.underline}. It can be also
interactive and mutual (see also Van der Wagen & Pieters, 2015). Latour
(2005) himself illustrated a parallel in this context with the manner in
which puppeteers interact with their puppets: [Although marionettes
offer, it seems, the most extreme case of direct causality -- just
follow the strings -- puppeteers will rarely behave as having control
over their puppets. They will say queer things like "their marionettes
suggest them to do things they will have never thought possible by
themselves.]{.underline}" (pp. 59-60) This dimension might also be
relevant to the manner in which hackers engage with computers. As
Turgeman-Goldschmidt (2005) pointed out: ["Despite (or because of) the
fact that the computer is a machine, it invites play and
movement"]{.underline} (p. 20). Secondly, alongside this principle of
"joint (inter)action" or "human-machine cooperation," [Latour (1992,
2005) argues that non-humans are not passive, static, or neutral
entities.]{.underline} Based on their "script" or "prescription," [they
can provoke certain actions or usage (positive or negative), can make
people do things they would ordinarily not do (e.g., shoot somebody when
they have access to a gun5 ), and restrict human action (e.g., traffic
lights or speed bumps that regulate traffic behavior) (]{.underline}Van
der Wagen & Pieters, 2015; Verbeek, 2005). [In other words, for ANT,
non-humans (including their material features) can affect human
thoughts, morality, and behavior just like other humans do]{.underline}.
Also, here the "car-driver hybrid" is very 3 Note that this is not the
same as the "transhuman" view, which considers the cyborg as a new life
form rather than merely as a metaphor (Verbeek, 2008). 4 Once you learn
to drive, driving becomes a routine and takes place in a more automatic
fashion (see Ihde, 1990; Verbeek, 2005). Of course, with the emergence
of today's self-driving cars, the relationship between the driver and
the car again has changed. In this case, the car is the main (primary)
driving agent, while the role of human is secondary. 5 See for example
the study of Bourne (2012) entitled "[Guns don't kill people, Cyborgs
do."]{.underline} JQCJC VOLUME 6 NUMBER 2 (SPECIAL ISSUE 2018)
illustrative. Lupton's (1999) [ANT-based study on road rage showed that
the car as a physical object also co-shapes the behavior of the
(aggressive) driver: The pleasure of mastery of the machine, of speed,
the sense of power and liberation that movement in the car may bring, is
conducive to travelling above the speed limit for example, and other
reckless driving actions, such as running red lights or travelling too
close to others' vehicles.]{.underline} (p. 63) The fact that drivers
have to move in a heavy regulated space does not completely match up
with the emotions and sensations that come along with the act of
driving. [Both of these aspects are worth consideration in the context
of hacking as well, since hackers both interact (or "become one") with
the machine --and act or have to act in a certain legally restrictive
contex]{.underline}t. [Thirdly, although Latour (2005) did not
explicitly mention it in his work, we can also add here a more
subjective or intimate relationship between humans and non-humans. For
instance, when people (mostly men) speak about their car, they often
speak in terms of love, passion, emotion, and character, perhaps in a
similar vein as hackers speak about their computer or technology in
general. This dimension is also strongly present in the work of Turkle
(1982, 1984) discussed earlier. To sum up, ANT does not view tools,
objects, and technology in merely functional or instrumental terms.
Instead, it views them as an integrative element of human action,
capabilities, (self) perception, meaning giving, and even one's intent.
Drawing on ANT, this study conceives and studies the hacker as a
cyborgian deviant: a transgressive blend of human and technology. By
adopting this approach, it aims to gain a more nuanced understanding of
how hackers' relationship with technology takes shape, functionally,
experientially, and intentionally too.]{.underline}

### 2AC Experts Bad

#### Ontological politics fail because they're over-generalized and render everything political without interrogating the ways things become political in different settings -- things that become political only become so because of the ways they're relational to one another, anything else misinterprets human/non-human actions alike 

**Barry '13** (Andrew Barry, Millennium - Journal of International
Studies 2013, "The Translation Zone: Between Actor-Network Theory and
International Relations, March 2013, DOI: 10.1177/0305829813481007, LASA
EM)

One of the most influential accounts of politics in actor-network theory
is not a study of what might conventionally be understood to be politics
at all, but rather an analysis of medical practice. Annemarie Mol's The
Body Multiple both developed from and chal- lenged earlier accounts of
the politics of science in significant ways.39 **[Crucially, she
researched a location, the hospital, which was not oriented towards the
construction of alliances]{.underline}** and the mobilisation of allies,
**[but towards collaboration]{.underline}**, coordination **[and
care]{.underline}**. As she demonstrated, hospital specialists were
interested in establishing relations between multiple forms of existence
of a disease as it was enacted through a range of diagnostic techniques.
In this context, the vocabulary of actor-network theory needed to be
supplemented and modified. In particular, the reliance of actor-network
theory on semiotics and information theory failed to attend sufficiently
to the materiality of the body and the practical interventions of
medicine in its transformation. In her 'praxiologi- cal' analysis,
medical practice did not just construct new discursive identities, but
acted on the body, multiplying its forms of existence. The politics of
medicine in Mol's analy- sis revolved around the question of the ways in
which medical practice creates new biomedical objects and materials. But
despite the brilliance of her analysis of medical practice, Mol's
account of the **[ontological politics]{.underline}** of the hospital
**[provides a limited model for the analysis of politics in general, and
international relations in particular]{.underline}**. Indeed, she did
not intend to provide such a model. Her analysis in The Body Multiple
was more modest, and site specific. It derived from her ethnographic
research in the hospital and could not be translated, with- out
modification, elsewhere.40 Indeed, if Mol's conception of **[ontological
politics]{.underline}** were simply applied outside of the space of the
hospital, it would **[run the risk of being over- generalised, rendering
everything a political matter, without interrogating how things become
political in different situations and settings]{.underline}**.41 In this
way, a sense of the specific- ity of medical practice and the
differences between, for example, the practice of doctors and the
conduct of activists or regulators would not be recognised. Her doctors
were engaged in the coordination of multiple forms of existence of a
disease through a form of collaborative practice, which would be
uncommon in the field of international relations, however this is
understood. In short, the translation of actor-network theory into the
field of international relations cannot readily be derived from Mol's
work, but has to be thought afresh. I have already stressed the
importance of scientific and technical experts to the field of
international relations. But in addition to such experts, the researcher
in international relations is likely to come across a vast range of what
I shall call political experts who possess diverse forms of political
knowledge. The political experts routinely encoun- tered in
international relations exist in a whole range of organisations and
groups: parlia- ments and governments, of course, but also
non-governmental organisations (NGOs) and trade unions, as well as
activist movements and militant groups,42 and multinational
corporations. Some of these individuals may be known as political
experts or analysts and some may not; some might not consider themselves
to be experts, but have a form of political expertise, nonetheless,
derived from political or professional experience as much as training.
They are concerned in diverse ways with the problem of how to judge the
political situations in which they are enmeshed, as well as how to
intervene. The study of political expertise poses a problem for
actor-network theory. After all, actor-network theorists have argued,
firstly, that scientific and technical practice is a form of politics
and, secondly, that non-humans should be understood as part of the
political realm. In effect, early actor-network theory sought to expand
the domain of what we take to be political. But **[political
experts]{.underline}**, as I understand them, **[tend to have a much
more restricted understanding of what is political at any one
time.]{.underline}** For most political experts, **[not everything is
political. Some things might become political, or should become politi-
cised, whether it is the private conduct of politicians, the causes of
floods and other natu- ral disasters, or pollution emanating from a
particular factory, but generally they do not.]{.underline}**43 Natural
scientific expertise is often expected -- although not always -- to be
applicable at other times and in other places. But what is striking
about many political experts is their situated understanding of
politics. Political experts are invariably immersed in political action,
keeping up with events as they unfold. The **[politician needs to know
when to speak]{.underline}** and what to speak about. The **[activist
needs to understand]{.underline}** not just the symbolism of protests,
but also the **[ways in which urban space is policed]{.underline}**, the
degree to which social media sites are monitored or the time and
location at which it might be most appropriate to act. The **[analyst
employed to perform political risk assessment]{.underline}** on behalf
of companies investing in the Middle East **[needs to be able to judge
the significance of press reports from the region.]{.underline}** Not
surprisingly, many political **[experts possess an exper- tise in a
particular region]{.underline}**, industry, institution or problem,
**[and are aware of the shifting configuration of forces]{.underline}**
in that particular setting. The knowledge of the political expert is
likely to have to be adjusted, or should be adjusted, as events unfold.
Often the political expert has a particular concern with the
significance of the near future and the recent past -- a time period to
which academic research has tended to be peculiarly blind. The existence
of political expertise, then, potentially poses a challenge to actor-
network theory, which has offered its own analysis of politics as an
alternative to the narrowly political expertise of those who think they
are experts in politics. Arguably, **[actor-network theory had
over-expanded the notion of politics, thereby forgetting any sense
of]{.underline}** the **[specificity]{.underline}** of what is
**[conventionally understood to be politics]{.underline}**. Bruno Latour
sought to address this oversight in a paper on the specificity of
political speech first pub- lished in 2003. In this article he argued
that political speech was not intended to make factual claims or to
impart information at all. Rather, it had to be understood as a specific
regime of enunciation, directed towards the formation of a collective:
If we could define this particular enunciation regime with some
precision, we would be able to identify the times, places, topics and
people who do actually 'knit' politics, without any concern for the fact
of belonging or not to what political science refers to as the
political.44 Latour's argument in this article was explicitly a
conservative one. While many social theorists had earlier wanted to
expand the domain of politics to include virtually any act, Latour
sought instead to focus our attention on a particular form of speech,
the existence of which, he believed, was in peril: for, 'invaluable and
fragile, it survives only with meticulous care by a culture as delicate
as it is artificial'.45 At the same time, he wanted to distance himself
from those, such as Habermas, who aspired to make political speech more
reasonable, more honest and more rational. One of the key virtues of
political speech, and its distinguishing characteristic, in his view,
was that it did not have to be constrained by such normative demands.
Latour's intervention sought to preserve the tradition of political
speech in the face both of its evident decline and of the failure of
critical social theorists to recognise its specificity. The distortions
of political speech, or what Latour termed its 'spin', were to be
treated as something to be valued rather than taken as an object of
critique or denunciation. In this article Latour sought to recognise the
specificity of politics, but he also delib- erately limited the scope of
his analysis. He did not concern himself with the significance of
political expertise, or the practice of politics more broadly, or even
with the machinery of parliamentary democracy.46 Yet the conduct of
politics necessarily involves much more than making speeches; it also
involves, amongst other things, attending to the stag- ing, the setting
and the timing and spacing of political action. The **[study of politics
may concern itself with]{.underline}** the specificity of **[political
speech but]{.underline}**, as **[actor-network theorists]{.underline}**
including Latour recogn**[ised, it also has to consider the importance
of architecture, bod- ies, cameras and forms of violent and non-violent
direct action]{.underline}**, which cannot simply be understood as forms
of speech. In short, it also demands attention in addition to the mate-
rial apparatus, the practice and the atmosphere of politics.47 In this
context, the challenge that international relations poses to
actor-network theory is quite complex. For in its early formulations,
actor-network theorists were simply content to expand the realm of
politics -- by including such things as microbes and medical tech-
nologies in the field of politics -- without much concern for the domain
of what was com- monly recognised as political by political theorists.
In this respect, the arguments of actor-network theorists paralleled the
development of social and feminist theory more broadly in the period
from the 1970s onwards, enlarging the domain of politics to incorpo-
rate many issues that had previously not been widely considered to be
political. But **[if actor-network theory was to engage with the
diversity of forms of political expertise and practice, then it needed
not just to inflate the scope of politics indefinitely,
but]{.underline}** also to **[have something to say to those who,
recalcitrantly, pointed to the specificity of these
practices.]{.underline}** In this light, the challenge posed by the
field of international relations to actor-network theory is twofold.
**[On the one hand, the actor-network theorist should be concerned not
just with the study of international political institutions or
discourse]{.underline}**, but also with the study of political expertise
and practice, including the expertise and practice of international
rela- tions. **[On the other hand, just as sciences raised the question
of the constitution of the dis- tinction between science and
non-science, so the study of politics raises the question of how the
distinction between what is political and what is non-political is
sustained and transformed in practice]{.underline}**. In effect,
actor-network theory had to address a problem addressed by Foucault,
who, in his lectures on biopolitics and governmentality, also recognised
that he needed to study the history of explicitly political reason,
rather than expand further the range of objects, bodies and practices
that should be considered political -- as he had in preceding years.
However, while Foucault's approach in the late 1970s was to focus on the
history of governmental rationality, actor-network theorists have also
been drawn towards the possibility that political practices and
apparatuses could be observed directly in real-time, whether through
ethnographic fieldwork or, more recently, through the use of a variety
of online methods.48 The injunction of actor-network theory has always
been, after all, to 'follow the actors', whatever form they might take,
whatever they might become and wherever they might go.49

### 2AC Conventional Weapons K

#### Defenses of conventional weapons instill the ideal that these killings are justified and appropriate which causes a never ending cycle of war

Nisha **Shah**, 20**17**, \[\[\[Assistant Professor in the School of
Political Studies at the University of Ottawa, Critical Studies on
Security, \"Gunning for war: infantry rifles and the calibration of
lethal force\", \]\]\] jf\
As Rappert (2005: 211) notes, ['\[t\]hroughout history, technology has
been implicated in killing and injuring. Perhaps, as in no area,
weaponry makes explicit the potential for]{.underline} \[\[figure
omitted\]\] [weapons are viewed as part of an 'apparatus' of violence, a
system comprised of 'congeries of actors, objects, practices, discourses
and affects', which together interact to generate the violent dynamics
of warfare]{.underline} (Gregory 2011, 196). That **[a given weapon's
agency entails more than just its physicalt features but its interaction
with the people, norms, rules and activity of war goes some way to
illustrate the multiple dimensions that constitute the 'machines' of
war, both as a system and a specific tool]{.underline}** (c.f. De Landa
1991). However, [interaction similarly assumes that weapons, if not
their full capacities, are already obvious their users]{.underline} (and
critics) -- the question is simply about [what kind of agencies of
destruction they will exert in the course of war and their impact on the
people who use or are killed by them,]{.underline} and vice-versa.
Elsewhere I have noted that work of Barad (1998, 2003, 2007) can provide
important insight that helps to move past an understanding of weapons as
strategically, morally or materially 'ready-made' objects available for
use and analysis (Shah, 2017). Although sympathetic to an 'agential'
view of material objects, Barad notes that [an emphasis on interaction
fails to note that both weapons and humans are constructed in process,
through actions or performances of which they are the outcome and not
the originators]{.underline}. [Before interaction]{.underline},
according to Barad, [there is intra-action in which capacities are
defined, shaped and sorted in ways that make some things sensible as
objects and their users and other things not.]{.underline} An apparatus,
with all its component parts and people, is a grid of intelligibility
that determines what counts or is observed and understood as a weapon,
who uses it and against whom it may be used. [Apparatuses of war in this
way are more than just congeries of known or pre-existing people and
things]{.underline} -- [they are their mutual condition of
possibility]{.underline}. '[Conventional' weapons accordingly emerge
through a relational set of performances by and between a variety of
forces]{.underline} (technical properties, legal and ethical criteria,
operational directives, military strategy) [that delineate a boundary
between legitimate and illegitimate violence]{.underline}. [As agents of
destruction]{.underline}, then, **[weapons materialise or become
intelligible through an apparatus in which specific objectives for
fighting war and killing and injuring become appropriate]{.underline}**.
In sum, [weapons are indicative of apparatuses of lethality though which
violence is made available in specific 'instrumental'ways, both as the
means and the metric of howkilling and injuring in war becomes
justifiable, if not unquestionable]{.underline}. At work is an ontology
of harm whereby [specifications about the size of bores and bullet
holes, operational objectives and understandings about the purpose of
warfare become the irrefutable measure of the matter that matters in
war.]{.underline} At first sight, [this focus on technical standards and
specifications seemingly reduces weapons to abstract, esoteric and even
innocuous technological features.]{.underline} A well-known criticism is
that [they sanitise the practice and effects of war, making it hard to
remember that 'ground up bodies, limbs torn apart, carnage, and butchery
are all part of \[war's\] habitual theatre']{.underline} (Cavero qtd. in
Gregory 2016: 951; c.f. Cohn 1987, Scarry 1985). But from Barad's
perspective, technical or operational standards create the boundaries
around what counts as an object (c.f. Daston and Galison 2010; Star
2002, Bowker and Star 1999). In the case of weaponry, [these are the
boundaries between what is and is not taken for granted and unquestioned
asmeans of force, potentially lethal in kind.]{.underline} [Ontological
features in this way are inherently ethical determinations]{.underline}.
Although appearing to be 'nothing more than lists of numbers',
[technical specifications, human ingenuity and predilections for warfare
constitute the 'conventions' between appropriate and inappropriate means
and end of violence and thus inscribe a morality of warfare that is
embedded in and exercised by weapons]{.underline} (Star 2002, 100).
'[Standard-issue' weaponry, in other words, represents understandings of
which weaponry can or should be used, for what purpose and in what
ways]{.underline}. Understood thus, [weapons are not subsidiary to the
grand strategy of war. Rather, **they are instrumental to how war is
conducted.**]{.underline} [This instrumentality]{.underline}, [manifest
in and through available and authorised weapons, is a facet of the ways
in which the art of war]{.underline} -- its tools, its tactics and its
tenor -- [is generated and governed]{.underline} (c.f. Foucault 1977).
[The use of conventional weaponry as a result not only involves the
principles that motivate killing in war, and even when it might be
pragmatic to use various tools of deadly force.]{.underline} Rather [it
inculcates the kind of deadly and injurious warfare that is rendered
technically possible and, importantly, made ethically
preferable.]{.underline}

### 2AC Russia K

#### Disarm and deterrence are two sides of the same coin absent analyzing the materiality of arms---material stockpiles of power create a [feedback loop]{.underline} of violent desires that makes conflict with Russia [inevitable]{.underline}

Vincent **Pouliot**, 20**10**, \[\[\[James McGill Professor, Cooperation
and Conflict , \"The materials of practice: Nuclear warheads, rhetorical
commonplaces and committee meetings in Russian--Atlantic relations\",
\]\]\] jf\
In May 2006, [the Bush admin]{.underline}istration [announced plans to
deploy a limited set of missile interceptors as well as a radar station
on the territories of Poland and of the Czech Republic by
2011]{.underline}. The declared rationale for this Central European
location was to intercept eventual Iranian missiles on their way to the
United States and Europe. [Had the project finally gone forward,4 the
ballistic missile defence]{.underline} (BMD) [project would have given
way to the first permanent American deployment on Polish and Czech
soil.]{.underline} At the time of the announcement, the [Russian
reaction was harsh and immediate]{.underline}. The chief of the Armed
Forces General Staff declared that 'plans to make Eastern Europe a
forward region in the U.S. missile defense system are intended to
neutralize Russia's strategic potential' (quoted in Litovkin, 2006).
Then Defence Minister Sergei Ivanov similarly claimed that 'the choice
of location for the deployment of those systems is dubious, to put it
mildly' (quoted in Gordon, 2006). Even before Prague and Warsaw formally
agreed to the deployment, in summer 2008, Prime Minister Putin had
threatened to 'retarget our missiles toward a system that we aren't
creating' (quoted in BBC, 2008). From the outset, then, [the Russians
rejected the American plan as threatening their nuclear deterrent, as if
the Cold War had never ended. How can we make sense of this seemingly
abrupt return to the logic of deterrence?]{.underline} Throughout the
1990s, everything took place as if nuclear deterrence was fading from
the political landscape of Russian--Atlantic relations. As two Russian
experts write: '[Since the end of the Cold War, nuclear deterrence
between Russia and the United States had been receding into the
background in terms of day-to-day foreign policy and official public
relations']{.underline} (Arbatov and Dvorkin, 2006: 3). For several
years, [the only nuclear talk one could hear or read about was related
to disarmament]{.underline} (START I, START II and SORT, for instance)
[or to the cooperative management of old stockpiles]{.underline} (e.g.
Cooperative Threat Reduction, CIS denuclearization, the G8 Global
Partnership, etc.). In 1994, in a symbolic gesture, Clinton and Yeltsin
even pledged to re-target all their nuclear forces away from their
mutual territories (Talbott, 2002: 451, fn. 22). Again, after 11
September 2001, the major financial commitment of the 2002 Global
Partnership (USD 20 billion over 10 years) to help Russia manage its
nuclear arsenal took place in this generally cooperative climate in
which nuclear deterrence did not seem the primary preoccupation on
either side. This was only one part of the story, however. In fact, in
[both American and Russian defence strategy, nuclear deterrence remained
a central component after the end of the Cold War]{.underline}.
[Russia's first defence doctrine]{.underline}, adopted in November 1993,
[emphasized deterrence as the core component of the country's
security]{.underline} (Schemann, 1993). Given the rapid degradation of
its conventional armed forces, this was justified as the least expensive
policy to ensure efficient defence of the Russian territory
(Gottemoeller, 2006). The 2000 version of the doctrine confirmed the
central importance of nuclear weapons and added specific references to
Atlantic aggressive policies (Gottemoeller, 2006: 186--7; Ponsard, 2007:
104--6).5 [On the American side, the Nuclear Posture Review published in
1994 similarly considered strategic nuclear forces as a 'hedge' against
the 'uncertainty' of the new era.]{.underline} It is true that none of
these documents specifically mentioned the Russo-American axis of
deterrence at the time. In the 2002 US Review, however, Russia was
specifically named as one of seven states on which nuclear weapons could
or should be targeted (Gordon, 2002).6 In view of these contradictory
policies -- [de-targeting and disarmament on the one hand and
confirmation of the doctrine of nuclear deterrence on the other -- one
cannot help but have a certain feeling of dissociation]{.underline}.
From a practice theory perspective, t[hese contradictory dynamics fuel
in part on the materials of Russian--Atlantic relations embodied in
warheads]{.underline}. In effect, [the sheer existence of such huge
nuclear stockpiles prolongs the intersubjective structure of deterrence
beyond the political context that gave it birth]{.underline}. As such
warheads are like pieces on a chessboard -- [they inscribe the rules of
the game in things which then acquire a material existence of their own.
While stockpiles were built as part of the Cold War deterrence
structure, once out there they embody that structure and prolong its
existence in and through practice]{.underline}. **[They become materials
with which security practitioners cannot dispense]{.underline}**.
Insiders to Russian--Atlantic politics acknowledge the problem full well
-- **[that material things can take on a symbolic life of their
own]{.underline}**. One of the main Russian negotiators on nuclear
issues over the past few decades put the matter the following way:
'[It's like a dead body. If you don't bury it, it will cause
ailments]{.underline}.' In his mind, [NATO and Russia had come a long
way since the end of the Cold War toward more cooperation. 'But', he
added, 'one thing remained: infrastructure.' Material things seemed to
drive politics in his mind]{.underline}: [Politically, psychologically,
the type of deterrence is no longer with us. We achieved that. \[But\]
the infrastructure of deterrence is not destroyed yet]{.underline}. All
these [nuclear targets for all the missiles are still
there]{.underline}, so we need to go back to the tables to finish the
job. (Interview with author, April 2007) Two of the most prominent
Russian experts on strategic matters similarly observe that the sheer
existence of nuclear warheads precludes Washington and Moscow from
moving beyond the deterrence logic of the Cold War. In an interesting
essay, they regret that: \[...\] [mutual nuclear deterrence between the
United States and the Soviet Union]{.underline} (and now Russia) [has
quietly outlived the two states' global rivalry and
confrontation]{.underline}. ... [These inexorable dynamics of **mutual
nuclear deterrence have acquired a growing and negative 'feedback
effect' on political relations between former opponents**, sustaining
muted though multifarious fears: of the supposed evil intentions of the
'strategic partner'; of inadvertent or accidental nuclear attack; of
possible loss of control over nuclear weapons leading to their
acquisition by rebel groups or terrorists; of the one's plans to gain
control over the other's nuclear weapons or to deliver a disarming
strike against nuclear sites]{.underline} -- all this in the absence of
any real political basis for suspecting such horrific scenarios or
actions. (Arbatov and Dvorkin, 2006: 6) In these experts' opinion,
[cooperative projects: \[...\] are impossible to imagine while the
United States and Russia still aim thousands of nuclear warheads at each
other, keep missiles on hair-trigger alert, and modernize nuclear forces
to preserve robust retaliatory capabilities against each
other.]{.underline} (Arbatov and Dvorkin, 2006: 8) Here one can clearly
see how the reverted meaning-attachment logic plays out: **[it is
material things that attach meanings to people]{.underline}**. The rules
of the deterrence game are inscribed in the Russian and American nuclear
arsenals; as a result, [these armaments thwart non-confrontational
political dynamics. To compound the problem,]{.underline} note Arbatov
and Dvorkin (p. 92): ['\[T\]here is no such thing as just "maintaining"
nuclear capabilities -- maintenance is accompanied by a constant search
for new technologies and force employment concepts]{.underline}.' This
self-propelling dynamic shows very clearly in the vast modernization
programmes undertaken by the United States as well by Russia over the
past few years (for instance, the development of low-yield nuclear
weapons and the improvement of ballistic missile technology).
**[Materiality takes on a life of its own: by its sheer existence,
nuclear stockpiles force more research that will further prolong the
material effects.]{.underline}**

### 2AC War K

#### War is a larger material phenomenon than a technical event -- any reduction of war institutionalizes it, instead we focus on a human-based ontology

**Holmquist '13** (Caroline, Millennium: Journal of International
Studies 41(3) 535--552, "Undoing War: War Ontologies and the Materiality
of Drone Warfare", March 2013, DOI: 10.1177/0305829813483350, LASA EM)

The advent of military robotics brings into focus the relationship
between humans and machines in war. With the aim of making sense of new
technologies and their impact on the phenomenon of war, this article
proposes a critical inquiry into contemporary Western warfare that takes
war's material expression seriously. Situating military robotics within
a human--material assemblage of war, I seek to offer a new perspective
on the study of contemporary war, characterised by equal concern for
bodies of flesh and bodies of steel -- or, put differently, for the
materiality of sentience and for the humanlike charac- teristics of
machines. In so doing, this article contributes to two recent strands of
debate in particular. First, it offers a new perspective on the 'force
of matter', on the theoretical concern with mate- rialism that has
recently gained traction within International Relations (IR) and
Critical Security Studies (CSS).1 Building on the philosophies of
Maurice Merleau-Ponty and Judith Butler, I seek to centre questions of
human experience to the study of social and political phenomena,
including war.2 Merleau-Ponty's critical phenomenology -- **[little
invoked in IR]{.underline}** or CSS -- offers a perspective on
**[matter/materialism that is unusually atten- tive to questions of
consciousness, meaning-making and reflexivity.]{.underline}** His focus
on the physical, bodily manifestation of human perception (notably in
The Primacy of Perception, 1964) and **[corporeality offers unique
insights into the relationship between materiality, agency and
subjectivity through a 'return to lived experience before it is written
over and objectified by theory']{.underline}**.3 Such a critical
phenomenology, I will argue, agrees well with the interest in what it
means, in ontological terms, to be human -- a key concern of Judith
Butler's. Second, **[this article contributes to]{.underline}** current
**[discussions of how war ought to be studied]{.underline}**, a question
that recently has generated considerable attention within Critical War
Studies (CWS).4 Tarak Barkawi and Shane Brighton's exposure of a
long-standing neglect of the study of war as a phenomenon in its own
right constitutes a starting point for this article; and **[while one
may debate the extent to which war should be seen as a phenomenon dis-
tinct from others -- as opposed to always and already embedded within
processes of 'normal' political, everyday life]{.underline}** -- Barkawi
and Brighton are right to highlight the **[absurd- ity in silently
assuming a distinctiveness of war without attempting to investigate
it]{.underline}**.5 One person who did take the question of the
phenomenological distinctiveness of war seri- ously was, of course, Carl
von Clausewitz. '**[War']{.underline}**, he wrote on the first page of
his opus, '**[is an act of force to compel the enemy to do our
will']{.underline}**.6 Clausewitz's phenomenology showed antagonism to
be essential to war: whatever else war is, it is antagonistic, con-
frontational, coercive. Barkawi and Brighton seize on Clausewitz's
phenomenology in their suggestion that 'fighting' should be seen to have
'ontological primacy' for under- standing war, though the
'**[fighting']{.underline}** they refer to **[is more than mere kinetic
exchange, or its imminent possibility. Instead, fighting's excess is
what makes war irreducible to the instrumentalist
readings]{.underline}** offered by classic strategists, and the
**[phenomenon of war both constitutive and 'generative'.7 This
perspective enables us to see how events in war are never 'simply'
events]{.underline}**: their reach and potency go infinitely further.
For instance**[, the bombardment of a town or village is never simply
the physical destruction inflicted: the impact on human lives, on
individual psyches, thoughts and emotions, on hopes for the future on
the part of those whose homes or livelihoods have been destroyed and who
have lost loved ones, or suffered injury themselves, can never be fully
addressed through the technical ambition of 'reconstruction'. In terms
of human experience -- the focus of this article -- fighting always
exceeds 'fighting'.]{.underline}** Conventional **[studies of war have
largely neglected human experience, preferring]{.underline}** to study
war through abstracted **[notions of 'the state', 'militaries',
'insurgents' and so on]{.underline}**.8 Elaine Scarry's potent critique
of conventional understandings of war as being 'emptied of human
content' is inspirational: for Scarry, **[war is centrally constituted
by the injury of human beings, and]{.underline}** the
**[institutionalisation, routinisation and bureaucratisation of war
explicable only as a political consequence of the neglect of a core
human experience -- that of pain]{.underline}**.9 For Christine
Sylvester, too, injury constitutes the defining trait of the lived
experience of war. Via the legacy of feminist theory, Sylvester calls
for a centring of the study of war as experience on the body, both as a
unit with agency and as a prime target of 'war violence and war
enthusiasms'.10 And in response to the neglect precisely of bod- ily
experiences in the study of war, Kevin McSorely has suggested that war
be studied as 'embodied social practice', constituted by 'a range of
sensory, affective and embodied practices'.11 In this article, I place a
**[concern for ontology]{.underline}** (ontologies of the body, of
fighting, dying and of war itself) **[against]{.underline}** the
background of **[the advent of robotic warfare and, in particular, the
growing reliance on the part of Western states on drone
technologies.]{.underline}** The guiding question, then, is that of
**[how robotic warfare should influence]{.underline}** our **[thinking
about war and the commitment to studying]{.underline}** its
'**[fundamentals']{.underline}**, **[such that we may eventually think
ethically and politically about war. By studying war as a phenomenon
with its own ontological condition and structuring, interrogating bodies
and the bodily experience of war]{.underline}**, I seek to take up
recent challenges from within CWS by incorporating a set of bod- ies
less theorised -- the steely bodies of drones -- and asking how they fit
with the fleshy ones of human beings. This article by no means captures
the total significance of robotic warfare for the criti- cal study of
war. Nor do I offer a close examination of any particular example or
instance of drone warfare, a productive alternative when faced with a
multifaceted phenomenon and scant information about its totality.
Instead, I will discuss three manifestations of the complex interplay
between the human and the material in contemporary United States (US)
warfare in Afghanistan/Pakistan. First, I will consider the ways in
which **[ostensibly 'virtual' experiences of war turn out to have a
material reality to them]{.underline}**. Second, I draw on
Merleau-Ponty's existential phenomenology to suggest that we ought to
think of material objects in war as having 'agentic capacities'12 and
argue that this must have a bearing on our reading of the ontology of
war. Third, I emphasise **[the blurring of corporeal and incorporeal in
contemporary drone wars.]{.underline}** These observations all, in
different ways, point to the need to **[rethink the way in which 'war'
as a phenomenon is conceptualised, and the way in which we might
ultimately seek to understand the human experience of
war.]{.underline}** The notion of a 'human--material assemblage' is thus
used in this article to denote an equal concern for bodies of flesh and
bodies of steel, particularly inspired by Merleau-Ponty. The final part
of the article suggests that **[we might think of 'undoing war' by
redirecting our attention towards the ontology of the
human]{.underline}**, and specifically Butler's understanding thereof.

### AT: Accountability

#### LAWS will inherently be flawed and move towards becoming autonomous killing machines uncontrollable by codes of conduct

**Egeland 16** (Kjølv Egeland, Advisor, International Law and Policy
Institute; DPhil candidate, International Relations, Wadham College,
Oxford University, "Lethal Autonomous Weapons Systems under
International Humanitarian Law," Volume 85: Issue 2, 89-118, SR)

At the current stage in technical development, [it is difficult to
imagine how laws could operate in accordance with the rules for the
conduct of hostilities]{.underline}. [laws would presumably select their
targets based on some sort of quantifiable or otherwise
computer-friendly information]{.underline}. In that way, it is [similar
to how many drone strikes are conducted]{.underline} today. Signature
strikes and other drone [strikes based on metadata]{.underline} and sim
card tracing [are largely questionable under the rules governing the
conduct of hostilities, as they do not appear easily squared with the
rules of distinction and precaution. The]{.underline} proportionality
r[ule appears even more difficult for law]{.underline}s. [The
balancing]{.underline} of ends and means [is subject to constant
changes, due to a volatile strategic and tactical
environment]{.underline}. Translating such qualitative judgement into
computer algorithms would be a monumental task. Nevertheless, it appears
to be at least theoretically possible, and Ronald Arkin is "convinced
that they \[laws\] can perform more ethically than human soldiers".71
Notwithstanding this, [it seems utopian to think that such machines
would function faultlessly. In April 2008, several talon swords --
automated robots]{.underline} equipped with machine guns -- [were taken
out of service in Iraq]{.underline}, [following claims that they had
turned their guns on friendly (human) soldiers. US]{.underline}
authorities [denied the story, but confirmed that there had been
malfunctions. In 2007, an automated cannon]{.underline} employed by the
South African army [killed nine friendly]{.underline} (human) [soldiers
and wounded 14 others.]{.underline}72 As Human Rights Watch (hrw) puts
it: "[If \[unlawful\] killing were done by a fully autonomous
weapon]{.underline} \[...\] [the question would become: whom to hold
responsible]{.underline}?"73 In an article from 2013, Aaron Johnson and
Sidney Axinn have an easy answer to hrw's question: The chain of command
is well established for all weapon systems \[...\]. However[, when the
robot is controlled by a program, not a human, the usual court-martial
pattern may not be useable]{.underline}. \[...\] This is really a detail
\[...\]. If it is a matter of a robot mistake, for instance due to a
programming error, then the same rules that govern quality assurance and
verification of toasters or conventional weapons should apply. If the
weapons misfired because of a design defect, the manufacturer could be
held liable.74 According to Johnson and Axinn, the responsibility
objection is no problem. However, as I shall argue, scenarios in which
it would be both legally and morally impermissible to try a manufacturer
or programmer for war crimes remain. By definition, [autonomous robots
obscure the causal link between humans and the actual use of force,
which is a prerequisite of accountability]{.underline}. The following
sections mainly address the question of responsibility for war crimes in
the absence of intent (mens rea) by humans. Possible crimes include
grave breaches of the Geneva conventions, for example wilful killing of
civilians, killing or wounding a soldier hors de combat, extensive
destruction of property not justified by military necessity, and
intentionally directing attacks against buildings dedicated to religion,
education, art, science, or charitable purposes.75 Trying suspects of
war crimes is regarded as paramount with regard to securing justice, and
post conflict justice processes can allegedly be vital for postconflict
peace-building.

#### Nobody can be held accountable for the actions of autonomous machines and LAWS fall into a legal grey area of responsibility and intent

**Egeland 16** (Kjølv Egeland, Advisor, International Law and Policy
Institute; DPhil candidate, International Relations, Wadham College,
Oxford University, "Lethal Autonomous Weapons Systems under
International Humanitarian Law," Volume 85: Issue 2, 89-118, SR)

If we look more closely at the responsibility of programmers (for
international crimes, not compensation claims), the picture gets even
more complicated. [Robot software consists of millions of lines of
coding written by large teams]{.underline}. Since [the software is so
complex, it cannot be written or micro-planned by any one
person]{.underline}.87 [This]{.underline} complexity [precludes anyone
from having complete oversight over how the system will perform in all
contingencies]{.underline}. The company responsible for the production
of a laws could potentially be accountable in claims of commercial
malfunction, but [unless it could be established that the malicious
software was programmed with "intent and knowledge" by one or more
programmers, it would seem unreasonable to hold an individual programmer
responsible of war crimes]{.underline}.88 As pointed out by Lin et al.,
[even if every line of computer coding were internally consistent, the
software could still malfunction "in aggregate"]{.underline}. According
to them, [there is a]{.underline} common [misconception that robots will
do only what we have programmed them to do]{.underline}. Unfortunately,
[such a belief is a sorely outdated, harking back to a time when
computers were simpler and their programs could be written and
understood by a single person. Now, programs with millions of lines of
code are written by teams of programmers, none of whom knows the entire
program]{.underline}; hence, [no individual can predict the effect of a
given command with absolute certainty, since]{.underline} portions of
[large programs may interact in unexpected]{.underline}, untested
[ways]{.underline}.89 Indeed, the novelty of laws is precisely that they
are not strictly tools in a killer's hand. Rather, [they could in many
instances be understood a human killer's replacement.]{.underline} In
the absence of intent and knowledge, "the programmer" does not appear to
be a viable culprit.

[For LAWS, ANT provides an ontological redistribution of agency and
ordering in a manner that elevates weapons on equal footing with other
actors and networks that are inherently linked to its
development]{.underline}. [This]{.underline} rebalancing [allows for
a]{.underline} closer [inspection of how LAWS are composited together
with various actors and other networks]{.underline}, forming relations
based on exchanges of power and assertiveness. Beginning with the
literal construct of the system, the physical components that make up
the weapon, the first problem arises. [What]{.underline} actually [are
LAWS]{.underline}? The issue with conceptualization has been mentioned
earlier, but gains new traction through the application of ANT. Legal
scholar [Kjølv Egeland defines the term of a weapon system as usually
consisting of three parts: the ensemble of the weapon, a mechanism for
firing and if necessary, a platform from which to support the
system]{.underline}.52 [This]{.underline} basic framework [works well
from an analytical context]{.underline} that can encompass variations on
potential LAWS, especially for systems that are predicted to become
autonomized in the near future, such as Predator and Reaper drones.53
This si[mplification can aid in contextualising LAWS in international
legal frameworks, that depend upon clear, binary examples of cases of
violation]{.underline}.54 However, [is such a definition suitable for
more abstract or complex forms of LAWS]{.underline}, for example cyber
LAWS that consist solely of lines of code that leaves the lethality
aspect to the malfunction of its intended targets? [No according to the
U.S]{.underline}. DoD directive on autonomy in weapon systems, which
states that [the definition of LAWS "does not apply to autonomous or

operations."]{.underline}55 Furthermore, what of the "killer robot"
depiction of a weapon system that resembles the synthetic machines from
the Terminator franchise, a correlation that is promulgated by the
Campaign to Stop Killer Robots, [an international coalition determined
to ban the development of LAWS for fear that they can lead to an
ethically unjust, unmoral and dangerous future]{.underline}?56 [The
dystopic imagery has been]{.underline} most certainly [effective in
converging the public's attention towards the concern over unrestricted
LAWS development]{.underline}, even if the analogy remains firmly in the
realm of science fiction. [Ongoing debates]{.underline} over the
definition of LAWS continue in public forums such as the one hosted by
the CCW, [demonstrat]{.underline}ing [that a clear consensus is still
not possible]{.underline}. However, it is not a hindrance to arms
control and prohibition efforts, as was noted in the summarized report
written from the meeting of experts that took place in April of 2016. 57
Instead, [it is a realization that LAWS are not best understood through
their physical properties, but rather through their relational use with
humans. **Analysing LAWS as an assemblage of various human and non-human
actors ordered in hierarchies, held through the production of action and
delegation, can reveal the dynamics that propel their development and
potential use**]{.underline}. [Networks are envisioned as]{.underline}
processes, [actions that are performed as a result of relations between
actants in a non-linear fashion. For LAWS, the research, development,
production, planning and operational phases are all immediate
environments to be dissected for a closer look at how these relations
produce meaning. Its composition is fluid and uncertain in nature,
signifying the ability to change and adapt at various stages according
to the relations that bind it together]{.underline}. 58 At the
development stage, engineers test new technologies on a range of
predetermined criteria and expectations that they have calculated, to
see whether, for example, new prototypes of LAWS can comply with the
rules of IHL which they are obliged to adhere by.59 If the results do
not comply with their expectations, then they make new adjustments based
on their new findings. This [back and forth relationship in the
development stage demonstrates a shared contribution between human and
machine in how the system progresses as a functioning
weapon]{.underline}. This can also occur in the planning or operational
stage, as their use on the battlefield can generate surprising results
that in turn may lead to modifications in their use and role in future
scenarios, based on improved effectiveness or better efficiency.
Furthermore, [civil sectors of society contribute]{.underline} in
unexpected ways, [as technology developed for commercial uses become
appropriated for the military and vice versa.]{.underline} For LAWS,
this would most likely result from improvements in information
technology, such as advanced recognition software or the advancement of
A.I systems. What of the implications of LAWS in relation to
international security? This becomes problematic when translating the
network of activity that represents LAWS into the rigidity of formal
structures that demand clear boundaries, explicitly defining the objects
in question. [In]{.underline} strictly [legal terms]{.underline},
banning, restricting or [regulating the use of LAWS is discussed through
a holistic lens that aims to encapsulate the exercise of war under a set
of rules and regulations deemed appropriate by the international
community. Rarely]{.underline} though, [does this reflect the reality of
how new technology emerges]{.underline}. LAWS, along with many other
forms of highly intelligent systems utilized by the military, will
depend on a number of conditions before they can successfully be
developed and deployed. UAV's require an extensive network of support
that even the most developed countries such as the U.S. and its NATO
allies have struggled to provide.60 Sustaining drone programs require an
enormous amount of money and resources, as well as hundreds of
operators, engineers and trained military personnel. New innovations in
military hardware and software do not disseminate quickly, even among
allies, as such emerging technology must have the required industrial
infrastructure, proficiency and expertise, and organizational competence
to be maintained.61 It appears then, [that there is no immediate threat
of LAWS sprouting from regimes, states or non-state actors
who]{.underline} outwardly [reject the principles of LOAC. Only
countries that are capable of investing with the required amount of
resources into military programs will be capable of acquiring
LAWS]{.underline} in the near future. [This restricts the list of
countries]{.underline} to a select few, [most notably the U.S. and
Israel, forming a]{.underline} potential [monopoly on LAWS
development]{.underline}. Furthermore, [weapons R&D remains opaque to
the public]{.underline} as a means [to protect innovations from losing
their advantageous qualities]{.underline}. LAWS as an assemblage can
thus be envisioned as being asymmetrical in its ordering and
accessibility, restricted by means of an unbalance of military
capabilities, technological innovation, financial wealth and support
from the commercial sector.

### AT: Contextual Analysis/Contingency Good

#### Empiricism informs the actions of those involved in international politics -- they can't be viewed as static because political situations are inevitably discursive constructs assembled by masses of non-human agency and can't be understood through just one lens

**Barry '13** (Andrew Barry, Millennium - Journal of International
Studies 2013, "The Translation Zone: Between Actor-Network Theory and
International Relations, March 2013, DOI: 10.1177/0305829813481007, LASA
EM)

The study of international relations raises a third problem for
actor-network theory: namely, **[the problem of how actor-network theory
addresses the question of the historical circumstances or contingency of
international politics. This question arises because, in its early
formulations at least, actor-network theory tended to bracket the
question of his- tory]{.underline}**.52 Perhaps this was not surprising
given the microsociological orientation of actor- network theory. After
all, although laboratory scientists are concerned with the current state
of scientific debate, as embodied in the recently published scientific
literature, they do not necessarily have any immediate interest in
earlier scientific arguments, which they can largely take as given.
There is no need for the scientist to read the original papers of
Maxwell, Einstein or Born, for example, not because these are
unimportant or forgotten, but because their lessons and insights are
likely to have been absorbed into the under- graduate curriculum that he
or she has already been taught.53 But the student of **[interna- tional
relations cannot so readily bracket the question of
history]{.underline}**. On the one hand, those involved in international
politics, however this is conceived, frequently understand their own
actions or the actions of others in a historical context, even though
they may radically disagree about what that historical context is.
**[Where an understanding of history may seem to be irrelevant to the
immediate concerns of the scientist]{.underline}**, **[it may explicitly
or implicitly inform the actions of those involved in international
politics.]{.underline}** Consider the criti- cal importance of
historical writing to the Israel--Palestine conflict, for example, or
the significance of the two world wars to the development of the
European Union from the 1950s onwards. On the other hand, those
concerned with the study of international rela- tions are likely to have
to attend to both the particular contingency and the path-depend- ency
of events, which are the resultant effect of multiple historical
antecedents. Elsewhere, I have argued that actor-network theory needs an
analysis of what I have termed political situations, an idea that is
informed in part by the sociology of Gabriel Tarde.54 The notion of
political situations can be defined in three ways. Firstly, political
situations are the meeting point of diverse currents and movements, of
ideas and prac- tices, of beliefs and desires, which coalesce in
particular settings or over time.55 **[If one were to consider, for
example, why the coating material of an oil pipeline came to be
discussed in a House of Commons select committee, one would need to
address, amongst other things, the critical importance of BP to British
foreign policy since the early 20th century,]{.underline}** the stated
commitment of both the British government and BP to the principle of
transparency, the dynamics of innovation in the oil industry, the
development of radical anti-corporate politics in the UK, the history of
labour relations in Georgia, and the promises made by the Shevardnadze
government to the Georgian people about the wealth that would come from
the pipeline in the years previously.56 That is to say, in 2005 a whole
series of currents and movements came together to make the integrity of
pipeline coating material, rather than, say, the possibility of war
between Russia and Georgia, a matter of public dispute in the UK to the
extent that it was taken up by the core institu- tions of British
government. Secondly, as **[actor-network theory would lead us to
expect, political situations are not merely discursive constructs. They
are assemblages that include material artefacts and technologies such as
monitoring devices, border posts and information and energy
infrastructures.]{.underline}** Political situations are grounded in
material forms as well as the ideas, passions and interests with which
these forms become associ- ated. Thirdly, **[political situations are
likely to be uncertain, ambiguous and contested. They are animated by
passionate antagonisms and wild speculations, as well as by sober
disputes over matters of fact. In these circumstances, we should not
expect there to be a definitive analysis of what the political situation
is.]{.underline}** All of those involved in a political situation --
whether it is the Eurozone crisis or the Iraq War -- are likely to be
concerned with the identity of the political situation. Political
situations are unfolding and multiple. **[Inevitably, the analysis of
political situations, including the work of researchers in the field of
international relations, enters into the very nature of what political
situations are.]{.underline}**

### AT: CPs/PICs

#### The CP solves none of the aff---net benefit logic sees securitizing value in technologies of warfare, which falls into the machine's trap

Approaches to Banning or Restricting Lethal Autonomous Weapon Systems?,"

[Technology has always played an important part in how the politics of
security is shaped, especially in the area of arms control and
disarmament]{.underline}. It is, after all, the means by which security
is realised for all practical purposes; [as technology progresses
so]{.underline} too [does]{.underline} the capacity for
[security]{.underline} to expand [in]{.underline} greater and perhaps
more [dangerous ways]{.underline}. At this intersection, where
[technology presents new avenues for]{.underline} the pursuit of
[security and the conduct of war,]{.underline} politics intervenes,
acting as a guiding force that can prevent, legitimise or even intensify
such possibilities. [Societal concerns]{.underline} and efforts to ban
or restrict weapons [contribute to the political processes that govern
their development]{.underline}. Yet little attention is given to how
[technology]{.underline} itself can [affect the politics of security, as
an active participant that too can shape outcomes and events externally
to human contro]{.underline}l. This is not to say that technology
possesses a conscious intent or a stake in the matter, rather it is to
acknowledge how [technology can independently construct new meaning that
in turn]{.underline}, can influence society or in this case, security.
Instead, technology is usually viewed in two manners in relation to
security; either from an instrumental or a substantivist perspective.35
Instrumentalist views categorize technology as simply being material
objects and nothing more, their use having no real impact or weight on
changes in security besides the fact it is a means to an end, a tool in
other words. On the other hand, [the substantivist]{.underline} view
stresses the effects of technology on our societal and cultural
relations in a deterministic fashion, [suggest]{.underline}ing that
[humanity has no effective control over the continued integration of
technology in our lives, that it has precedent in dictating how
relations are construed or broken]{.underline}. What both views share is
a static position on technology, that it is either irrelevant to speak
of its contributing factor in political and security relations or that
it is a deterministic force whose influence is ever present and
inevitable, one that cannot be tamed by socio-political forces.36 This
results in a separation of politics from technology, that [instead of
understanding weapons like LAWS as being comprised of political and
technological components, it observes socio-technological relations as
being solely political or excessively technological by
nature.]{.underline} Positons on technology that neglect how it
interacts with security risk undermining efforts in arms control and
disarmament[. Accepting]{.underline} certain presumptions as given, such
as [the inevitability of reaching human cognitive capabilities in A.I.
systems or that weapons technology, once developed, can easily
disseminate across borders or even to volatile pariah states or
non-state actors, can limit the understanding of how LAWS can and will
be used in the future]{.underline}. [Nuclear weapons]{.underline} can
[provide]{.underline} ample [evidence]{.underline} as [to how arms
disarmament adjusted its priorities in the name of attainable goals, to
coincide with the logics of international relations that were prevalent
at the time]{.underline}. What started as [movements to eradicate
nuclear weapons]{.underline} on the basis of its absolute destructive
qualities, slowly [became]{.underline} efforts in [managing and
limiting]{.underline} the numbers of warheads in
[stockpiles]{.underline}. 37 Concessions were made based on accepting
deterrence as the dominant approach to managing nuclear weapons and led
to adopting more realistic stances on reducing numbers. [What resulted
was the normalization of nuclear weapons as an integral part of
international security, without regarding the process of nuclear weapons
development as being a dialectic relationship between man and machine,
how it produces innovation and new meaning, and ultimately how it can be
subject to change]{.underline}. [Advocating against LAWS]{.underline} on
the other hand, has the advantage of gaining momentum prior to the
weapons realisation and use, yet [is susceptible to]{.underline} falling
for [similar mistakes]{.underline}. For example, demonstrating [LOAC
a]{.underline}s a viable tool in restricting LAWS, when in fact it
[remains inadequately able to assuage fears of LAWS]{.underline}
violating the principles of IHL, [due to its limitations in addressing
non-human, autonomous actors in warfare.]{.underline} To help tackle
these concerns, [an alternative]{.underline} theoretical [approach that
recognises technology as an equal contributor in generating knowledge
and meaning in practices of security can help move beyond current
challenges to the political debate.]{.underline}

### AT: Impact Defense

#### Their impact defense falls for the weapons' trap---don't underestimate policymakers' capacity to be influenced by arms---it makes escalatory pressures and intervention [inevitable]{.underline}

Benjamin **Meiches**, **2017** \[\[an assistant professor of Security
Studies and Conflict Resolution at the University of Washington-Tacoma.
He received his Ph.D. from Johns Hopkins University. His research
addresses genocide, armed conflict, humanitarian intervention, and
critical theory; Critical Studies on Security, \"Weapons, desire, and
the making of war\"\]\] jf\
[Many traditional theories of weapons]{.underline}, such as nuclear
deterrence, [implicitly presuppose affective 'striking power' to
describe the function of weapons]{.underline}. For instance, [a gap
exists between the destructive potential of weapons and the more
limited, actual use of weapons]{.underline}. [This gap between actual
and potential use produces a communicative difference, which relies
entirely on affective force.]{.underline} [Typically understood as a
form of threat, the gap between what weapons could do and what they
actually do sends signals between parties]{.underline}. [These signals
enable new mechanisms of force, such as coercion, by affectively
shifting the habits of a targeted or vulnerable party]{.underline}.
However, [the possibility of these affective signals depends on the
weapons \'striking power,\' which impacts a person or stated affected by
a weapon prior to an explosion or physical impact. Threat is thus a
byproduct of the latent potential of \'striking power]{.underline}.\'.
[The entire concepts of threat gestures or postures thus presuppose the
affective capacity of the weapon, but they are not the only products of
this gap]{.underline}. For example, [the difference between the
potential and actual use of weapons]{.underline} also establishes the
distinctions critical for laws and norms of war, but [may also signal
superiority in battle or a different organisation of combat]{.underline}
(DeLanda 2005). The 'striking power' of weapons consequently induces
complex affects that befall both human embodiment and relations of
desire in ways that are difficult to predetermine. Hence, the
[destructive aspects of weapons constitute only a set of the affective
relations that link humans and weapons]{.underline}. [Weapons similarly
'strike' humans in the form of obsessions, profit, or art; weapons
enchant, glimmer, and terrify.]{.underline} Arguably[, these affects
also comprise forms of 'striking power' in the broad sense of
rearticulating the affective relations between bodies.]{.underline} By
forming new kinds of desire, [weapons also produce their
users]{.underline}. There are several ways to understand how [weapons
affectively mold subjectivity]{.underline}. [Each
perspective]{.underline} or model [explores a different mode of
encounter between weapons and humans, which reflects slightly distinct
theoretical commitments regarding the role weapons]{.underline} (or
things) play in social life. The first mode of encounter concerns
weapons' ability to augment and transform human imagination. Put
simply[, weapons introduce the possibility for imagining otherwise by
extending the capacities of human beings]{.underline}. This
interpretation adds a minimal degree of weapon agency into the dominant
explanation of weapons as tools. In this model, [weapons only alter
operations of thought by introducing new possibilities that change human
designs, strategies, and aspirations.]{.underline} For instance, Sven
Lindqvist subscribes to this model in his illustration of how the
development of bombing prompted the emergence of fantasies of mass
murder and genocide (2003, 31, 71, 126). Here[, the weapon contributes
to the remaking of the world-image and, by doing so, both endow weapon
possessors with a sense of omnipotence that necessitates certain
exercises in political violence]{.underline} (Chow 2006). [This model
also provides an explanation of weapon fetishes, which depends on an
enamour with specific properties bound up in the fantasy of using or
possessing weapons.]{.underline} [Another model focuses on the proximity
of weapons and humans]{.underline}. In this case, [living with weapons
stimulates processes of becoming with weapons that paradoxically take
the form of a relationship of embodied care]{.underline}. The soldier
maintains and worries about her rifle and the nuclear scientist for
their Intercontinental Ballistic Missile (ICBM). In this model,
[proximity produces relations between humans and weapons that connect
different affective properties of each entity, which become a habitual
expression of a lifeworld]{.underline}. The familiarity and everydayness
of the weapon thus changes the relationship between the weapon and the
user. Indeed[, this relationship has been the principal object of weapon
socialisation processes such as training regiments, military exercises,
and martial arts, which rely on exposure and familiarity with weapons to
instruct a person in their proper use]{.underline} (Waal 2010; Grossman
2009). Each of these **[processes of familiarisation includes a
potential for weapons to redefine the self through a set of somatic
habits and empathic links that make living with weapons a key part of
social life]{.underline}**. The proximity to weapons often fosters a
productive relationship to actual conflict, even in the form of pure
simulation, since [proximity changes and invents a new reality or field
of conflict]{.underline} (Der Derian 2009[). Similar processes
inadvertently occur under duress or threat where continuous exposure to
the violence of weapons engenders a change in social structures of
empathy and care]{.underline}. In this model, [weapons not only alter
fantasies but also the corporeality and sociality of the bodies that
encounter them.]{.underline} The significant effort to [decouple weapon
users from their weapons, through institutions such as training and
legal distinctions under the laws of war, reflects the potency of this
relationship since, as safeguards,]{.underline} they presuppose the
capacity for the familiarity with weapons to alter human conduct (Baker
2010; Lunasco et al. 2010). Put differently[, weapons intervene on
somatic rhythms and relations of embodiment via their proximity and
therefore require strict macro- and micropolitical regimes of
governance]{.underline}. [A third model understands the encounter
between humans and weapons in terms of a series of potentials introduced
by weapons]{.underline}. This 'abstract' reading derives from weapons
ability to synthesise a variety of discrete connections between objects,
humans, and larger assemblages including the construction, use, and care
of weapons. These potentials, which remain unactualised, produce
contingent reactions to weapons, which cannot be predefined by the
function or purpose of the weapon. Put differently, [a weapon operates
as a pluripotential object that stimulates multiple forms of desire that
cannot be derived from the apparent utility of weapons for humans. The
'fantasy' and 'familiarity' models would thus be only a subset of the
broader relations formed by the potential opened by the 'striking power'
affects of the weapons]{.underline}. In this respect, it is important
recall the earlier point that as striking instruments, weapons emerge in
relation to an exterior milieu rather than an interior territory
(Deleuze and Guattari 1987). Unlike tools, which work towards a specific
end in a process of construction and must be freed from this model to
perform otherwise, [the potentiality of the weapon hinges on a far wider
and arguably more creative form of expenditure, which involves the
negative rearticulation of possibility]{.underline}. Put differently,
the potentiality lingering on the cutting edge of the weapon, the
capacity to void other relations, strikes human subjects and alters
desires irrespective of their conscious acknowledgment of the process.
This potentiality grows with the expansion of processes of weaponisation
and, in effect, generates positive feedback loops. [Weapons' potential
stimulates greater investment]{.underline} (social, economic, military,
and affective[) in weapons, which augments the potential of weapons in
multiple forms.]{.underline} The [striking power of the weapon not only
works as an instrument, unconscious fantasy, or because of the proximity
of arms but works also on the production of human subjectivity and
desire at the broadest and most intimate levels]{.underline}. [Two
examples]{.underline} show how this third model operates and directly
challenge the presumption of human sovereignty over weapons by
demonstrating how weapons influence subjectivity. [First]{.underline},
Klaus Theweleit's work Male Fantasies unpacks the forms of desire and
weaponry at work in the freikorps and Nazi leadership (1989, 1987).
Theweleit's argument, which remains largely ignored in studies of war
and conflict, is that the freikorps conceptions of self, state, and
society were entangled with processes of weaponisation. The freikorps,
according to Theweleit, were not exclusively intent on the destruction
of the Weimar Republic, Jewish people, or the Soviet Union, but with the
articulation of self through the process of destruction itself. In this
sense, the freikorps enemies were liquid, potential, fluidly targeted on
account of their ontological difference rather than static, eugenic
categories. Their image of body, society, and state defined by a rigid
schema except, as Theweleit shows, during the act of killing, which
provided a space of creativity. Destruction thus formed a crucial part
of the freikorps articulation of identity as their very purpose was to
make war 'more than a profession, \[but\] a state of being' (Theweleit
1989, 396). As the means of destruction, weapons play a powerful role in
the freikorps articulation of self such that they identify with their
weapons as vehicle of a perpetual seek and destroy mission. The
freikorps thus envision their lives as means of destruction long before
engagement with enemies (Theweleit 1987, 218--225). In short, [weapons
reconstruct the freikorps very capacity to desire, the forms desire
takes, and the ultimate form of life of the freikorps such that they
discover a virtually unlimited series of enemies and sources of danger
to destroy. Another example]{.underline} is brilliantly outlined by Banu
Bargu's Starve and Immolate: The Politics of Human Weapons. Bargu's text
describes the formation of necropolitical resistances that challenge the
coherence of a biopolitics of life. In doing so, she theorises a process
of 'the weaponization of life' as 'the tactic of resorting to corporeal
and existential practices of struggle, based on the technique of
self-destruction, in order to make a political statement or advance
political goals' (Bargu 2014, 14). The emergence of these 'human
weapons' illustrates the potential for weapons to directly affect
politics by reorganising the relationship between life and death. Life
forms have a long history at war (Cudworth and Hobden 2015), but many of
these examples are cases where militaries exploit the design features of
an organism just like metallic weapons exploit the properties of metal.
The appearance of 'human weapons', in contrast, marks the point where
weapons redefine the purpose, function, and possibilities of life and
death. However, this process is both a 'weaponisation of life' and a
'vitalisation of the weapon', since the possibility of human
weaponisation presupposes the capacity for weapons to augment human
desire and self-understanding so that the nature, role, and function of
life and political conflict transform (Bargu 2014). In this regard, the
weapon no longer works as simply a tool, but as a positive influence in
human life if not constituting a new form of life altogether. Put
differently, [the subjects of Bargu's study develop because of the
potential for weapons to transform the conception of self. This
possibility depends on a set of potentials opened up by weapons and
discloses how the reworking of desire relies on affective channels that
go beyond imagination or proximity]{.underline}. Furthermore, [these
examples imply a full reversal of the assumption of human sovereignty
over weapons by revealing the possibility that weapons alter the very
definition of human life both symbolically and technically]{.underline}.
These limited cases create a number of problems for theories of the
control and management of weapons. First, [they destabilise the
assumption that humans direct weapons to predetermined ends]{.underline}
and, by doing so, challenge traditional accounts of the genesis of
insecurity and armed conflict. Second, [they suggest that, on account of
their potentiality, weapons have the capacity to modify desire by
creating new constituencies that will advocate for them, use them,
ensure their reproduction as a form of non-life, and take them on as
integral to their mode of life]{.underline}. Weapons thus cannot be
easily separated from their capacity to build assemblages with human
beings who bear them as vital objects of desire. Unfortunately,
discussions of warfare have largely excluded this dimension of weaponry
from scrutiny.

### AT: LAWS Good

#### All LAWS good args deny the role of machines---they make the unraveling of norms and de-escalation frameworks [inevitable]{.underline}

**Gianni 17** (Nicolas Gianni, Master of Arts in International Relations
at Leiden University, "How Can Actor-Network Theory Assist in Rethinking
Approaches to Banning or Restricting Lethal Autonomous Weapon Systems?,"
Final Thesis Draft, 1-19, SR)

[For LAWS, ANT provides an ontological redistribution of agency and
ordering in a manner that elevates weapons on equal footing with other
actors and networks that are inherently linked to its
developmen]{.underline}t. This rebalancing allows for a closer
inspection of how [LAWS are composited together with various actors and
other networks, forming relations based on exchanges of power and
assertiveness]{.underline}. Beginning with the literal construct of the
system, the physical components that make up the weapon, the first
problem arises. What actually are LAWS? The issue with conceptualization
has been mentioned earlier, but gains new traction through the
application of ANT. Legal scholar Kjølv Egeland defines the term of a
[weapon system]{.underline} as usually [consist]{.underline}ing [of
three parts: the ensemble]{.underline} of the weapon[, a mechanism for
firing and]{.underline} if necessary, [a platform]{.underline} from
which to support the system.52 [This]{.underline} basic
[framework]{.underline} works well from an analytical context that [can
encompass variations on potential LAWS]{.underline}, [especially
for]{.underline} [systems that are predicted to become
autonomized]{.underline} in the near future, such as Predator and Reaper
drones.53 This simplification can aid in contextualising LAWS in
international [legal frameworks]{.underline}, that [depend upon clear,
binary examples of cases of violation]{.underline}.54 [However, is such
a definition suitable for more abstract or complex forms of LAWS, for
example cyber LAWS that consist solely of lines of code that leaves the
lethality aspect to the malfunction of its intended
targets]{.underline}? [No according to the U.S. DoD]{.underline}
directive on autonomy in weapon systems, [which states that the
definition of LAWS "does not apply to autonomous or semi-autonomous
cyberspace systems for cyberspace operations.]{.underline}"55
Furthermore, what of the "killer robot" depiction of a weapon system
that resembles the synthetic machines from the Terminator franchise, a
correlation that is promulgated by the Campaign to Stop Killer Robots,
an international coalition determined to ban the development of
[LAWS]{.underline} for fear that they [can lead to an ethically unjust,
unmoral and dangerous future]{.underline}?56 [The dystopic imagery has
been most certainly effective in converging the public's attention
towards the concern over unrestricted LAWS development, even if the
analogy remains firmly in the realm of science fiction]{.underline}.
Ongoing debates over the definition of LAWS continue in [public
forums]{.underline} such as the one hosted by the CCW, [demonstrating
that a clear consensus is still not possible]{.underline}. However, it
is not a hindrance to arms control and prohibition efforts, as was noted
in the summarized report written from the meeting of experts that took
place in April of 2016. 57 Instead, it is a realization that [LAWS are
not best understood through their physical properties, but rather
through their relational use with humans.]{.underline} Analysing [LAWS
as an assemblage of various human and non-human actors ordered in
hierarchies, held through the production of action and delegation, can
reveal the dynamics that propel their development and potential use.
Networks are]{.underline} envisioned as [processes, actions that are
performed as a result of relations between actants in a non-linear
fashion]{.underline}. [For LAWS, the research, development, production,
planning and operational phases are all immediate environments to be
dissected for a closer look at how these relations produce meaning. Its
composition is fluid and uncertain in nature, signifying the ability to
change and adapt at various stages according to the relations that bind
it together.]{.underline} 58 At the development stage, engineers test
new technologies on a range of predetermined criteria and expectations
that they have calculated, to see whether, for example, new prototypes
of LAWS can comply with the rules of IHL which they are obliged to
adhere by.59 If the results do not comply with their expectations, then
they make new adjustments based on their new findings. This [back and
forth relationship in the development stage demonstrates a shared
contribution between human and machine]{.underline} in how the system
progresses as a functioning weapon. This can also occur in the planning
or operational stage, as [their use on the battlefield can generate
surprising results that in turn may lead to modifications in their use
and role in future scenarios]{.underline}, based on improved
effectiveness or better efficiency. Furthermore, [civil
sectors]{.underline} of society [contribute]{.underline} in unexpected
ways[, as technology]{.underline} developed for commercial uses [become
appropriated for the military and vice versa]{.underline}. [For LAWS,
this would most likely result from improvements in information
technology, such as advanced recognition software or the advancement of
A.I systems]{.underline}. What of the implications of LAWS in relation
to international security? [This becomes problematic when translating
the network of activity that represents LAWS into the rigidity of formal
structures that demand clear boundaries, explicitly defining the objects
in question.]{.underline} In strictly legal terms, banning, restricting
or regulating the use of LAWS is discussed through a holistic lens that
aims to encapsulate the exercise of war under a set of rules and
regulations deemed appropriate by the international community. Rarely
though, does this reflect the reality of how new technology emerges.
[LAWS]{.underline}, along with many other forms of highly intelligent
systems utilized by the military, [will depend on a number of conditions
before they can successfully be developed and deployed]{.underline}.
UAV's require an extensive network of support that even the most
developed countries such as the U.S. and its NATO allies have struggled
to provide.60 Sustaining drone programs require an enormous amount of
money and resources, as well as hundreds of operators, engineers and
trained military personnel[. New innovations]{.underline} in military
hardware and software [do not disseminate quickly]{.underline}, even
among allies, as such [emerging technology must have the required
industrial infrastructure, proficiency and expertise, and organizational
competence to be maintained]{.underline}.61 It appears then, that there
is no immediate threat of LAWS sprouting from regimes, states or
non-state actors who outwardly reject the principles of LOAC. [Only
countries that are capable of investing with the required amount of
resources into military programs will be capable of acquiring LAWS in
the near future]{.underline}. This restricts the list of countries to a
select few, [most notably the U.S. and Israel, forming a potential
monopoly on LAWS development.]{.underline} Furthermore, weapons [R&D
remains opaque to the public]{.underline} as a means [to protect
innovations]{.underline} from losing their advantageous qualities.
[LAWS]{.underline} as an assemblage [can thus be envisioned as being
asymmetrical in its ordering and accessibility, restricted by means of
an unbalance of military capabilities, technological innovation,
financial wealth and support from the commercial sector.]{.underline}

#### Robotic warfare is on the rise -- allows for more insidious forms of targeting and burgeons the US shadow war and normalizes civilian casualties and recreates structural violence

**Holmquist '13** (Caroline, Millennium: Journal of International
Studies 41(3) 535--552, "Undoing War: War Ontologies and the Materiality
of Drone Warfare", March 2013, DOI: 10.1177/0305829813483350, LASA EM)

The topic of [robotic warfare is burgeoning at the moment]{.underline},
both [in the policy world and in academic debate]{.underline}.13 In this
article, I use '[robotic warfare' as shorthand for weapons systems that
are to various and varying degrees 'unmanned']{.underline}. [Unmanned
weapons sys- tems]{.underline} include: those that [are]{.underline}
[remote-controlled]{.underline} (i.e. 'manned' but at a distance);
[weapons systems programmed to work with a degree of
'automaticity']{.underline}; and systems that [are]{.underline}, to some
extent, '[autonomous']{.underline}. Automatic weapons systems range from
basic anti-personnel landmines (exploding automatically when stimulated)
to the more complex Phalanx sys- tem for Aegis-class cruisers, a radar
system whose response to detected 'enemy' aircraft can be set to various
degrees of automaticity.14 '[Autonomous' systems have the capacity to
interpret information and may identify a course of action; however,
no]{.underline} current [systems are truly autonomous in]{.underline}
the sense of [functioning entirely without human sanction or other
input]{.underline}.15 The main focus of this article, however, is on the
[use of combat-enabled]{.underline} unmanned weapons systems in the air,
commonly referred to as [drones]{.underline} or drone warfare.
Commentators are careful to point out that unmanned weapons systems [are
not entirely new: they were used by Israeli]{.underline} armed [forces
in the]{.underline} 1973 [October War and by the US in
Vietnam]{.underline}, and the famed US Predator was first used in the
war in Bosnia in 1995. [While much drone warfare is shrouded in
secrecy]{.underline} (not least given the vast proportion of drone
missions under CIA control), it is beyond doubt that their use has
increased substantially over the past half-decade. [Under]{.underline}
the [Obama]{.underline} administration, both the [number of
drone]{.underline} sorties and actual [attacks]{.underline} have
[escalated dramatically]{.underline}. The Bureau of Investigative
Journalism [estimates]{.underline} that **[between 2593 and 3365
people]{.underline}** have been [killed in drone strikes in
Pakistan]{.underline} during 2004--12.16 Drone [technologies have
proliferated over the last decades, and]{.underline} the [interest
within]{.underline} US [military circles]{.underline} for developing
them further [shows no sign of waning]{.underline}. Rather, the US Army
regularly issues new versions of their 'Roadmap' for 'Unmanned Aircraft
Systems', encouraging 'a broad vision' for their continued development,
as well as their deployment 'along the full spectrum of operations'.17
Importantly, the [trend towards robotic warfare is part of a wider shift
in]{.underline} concepts of [operation within the US military towards
'shadow war' involving the increased use of US Special
Forces]{.underline} (notably the Joint Special Operations Command,
JSOC). Forming a dense matrix of secret operations designed for night
raids of targeted killings (in 2011 estimated at 40 raids per night in
Afghanistan, i.e. over 1000 raids monthly), Unmanned Aerial Vehicle
(UAV)/drone technologies have come to fit snugly with the current pat-
tern of Special Forces deployment -- in particular, JSOC's networked
capabilities.18 Bob Woodward in The War Within (2009) highlights [the
fusion of technological innovation with plans for]{.underline} targeted
[killings, most ostentatiously under]{.underline} the US military's
Clandestine Tagging, Tracking and Locating ([CTTL) programme used to
develop methods for track- ing individuals using nano- and biotechnology
for the creation of sensors, tags and biochemical (thermal) biometric
'signatures' of individuals.]{.underline}19 This development is set to
continue, with US officials in October 2012 alluding to a new blueprint
for [pursuing 'terrorists' in the form of a 'disposition
matrix']{.underline} -- a next-generation [targeting list designed to
'go beyond existing kill-lists]{.underline}, mapping plans for the
"disposition" of sub- jects beyond the reach of American drones'.20 The
standard [narrative of the trend towards shadow war]{.underline} fought
with drone technology and secret operations is for these developments to
be [depicted as a reaction to]{.underline} the [costly]{.underline}
large-scale [man-intensive counterinsurgency campaigns that have
dominated]{.underline} US (and UK) [military ventures in the past
decade.]{.underline} Instead, the two trends evolved in tandem: the
'popula- tion-centric' [counterinsurgency warfare]{.underline} that
evolved in Iraq and Afghanistan around 2005--7 was [from]{.underline}
the [outset accompanied by reliance on secret operations featuring
military robotics designed to target key individuals for capture or
death]{.underline}. In other words, the proclaimed ambi- tion of
strengthening 'governance' structures, winning 'hearts and minds'
through the com- munication of an appropriate message and gaining
legitimacy amongst Iraqi and Afghan Holmqvist 541 [local
populations]{.underline} was always and [already intertwined
with]{.underline} the [increasingly mechanised **killing of
individuals**]{.underline}. US General Stanley McChrystal expressed it
thus: The idea was to combine analysts who found the enemy (through
intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance); drone operators who
fixed the target; combat teams who finished the target by capturing or
killing him; specialists who exploited the intelligence the raid
yielded, such as cell phones, maps and detainees; and the intelligence
analysts who turned this raw information into usable knowledge.21 As we
shall see, [in]{.underline} this [complex human--material
assemblage]{.underline}, the [local populations have]{.underline} also
[become a 'body' of a sort in contemporary war. Targeted killings
through robotic warfare and population-centric counterinsurgency are not
different in kind but two sides of the same coin: they testify to a
similar instrumentalisation of the populations amongst whom wars are
fought.]{.underline} Automated War -- Virtual yet Humanly Experienced An
[intuitive response to news about]{.underline} the increased [reliance
on technologies that allow for 'killing at distance']{.underline} is
that it [renders war 'virtual' for one side of the
conflict]{.underline}. This view follows from discussions of air power
in war more generally, [as we saw in]{.underline} the wake of **[NATO's
bombardment of Kosovo]{.underline}** in 1999.22 The [drone operator,
sitting in the safety]{.underline} and comfort [of his control room in
Nevada, no longer experiences war]{.underline}, goes the argument, and
**[killing as a result becomes casual.]{.underline}**23 Shielded from
physical harm, [the drone operator is no longer part of the fight in an
existential sense; there is no risk to his life.]{.underline} No doubt,
[drone warfare is infinitely more real for]{.underline} the
popul**[ations amongst whom attacks take place, who risk being killed,
losing loved ones or having their homes destroyed.]{.underline}** Yet,
while such arguments have understandable appeal, [close study of drone
operators' activity yields a more complicated picture.]{.underline}
Derek Gregory's study of drone operators' experience [focuses on the
'scopic regime']{.underline} that [enables drone warfare in the first
place and]{.underline} closely [examines]{.underline} the [different
types of vision and imaging that]{.underline} drone [operators are
exposed to, from wide area airborne surveillance to the macro-field of
micro-vision]{.underline}.24 These [visibilities are
conditional]{.underline} and conditioning [because they are not merely
technical feats but 'techno-cultural accomplishments'.25 Rather
than]{.underline} any [straight- forward abstracting of war into a video
game]{.underline}, the abstracting that takes place is convo- luted and
paradoxical. Contrary to common perception, [drone warfare is 'real'
also for those staring at a screen]{.underline} and, as such, the
reference to video games is often simplistic. It is the immersive
quality of video games, their [power to draw players into]{.underline}
their **[virtual worlds,]{.underline}** that **[make them
potent]{.underline}** -- this is [precisely why]{.underline} they are
used in pre-deployment training.26 The [video streams from the UAV are
shown to have]{.underline} the same [immersive qual- ity on the drone
operator]{.underline} -- they produce the same 'reality-effect'.
[Virtual war]{.underline}, it seems, [is less virtual than would appear
at first glance]{.underline}. This conclusion is strengthened by the
growing realisation that [drone operators suffer as high]{.underline},
and possibly higher, [rates of]{.underline} post-traumatic stress
disorder (**[PTSD]{.underline}**) [as soldiers engaged in
battle]{.underline} [as a result of exposure to high-resolution images
of killing]{.underline}, including the details of casualties and body
parts that would never be possible to capture with the human eye.27 [In
other words, drone operators see more than soldiers in theatre. This is
not to imply any trivialising parallels between operating drones from
afar and physical engagement in battle, however. The view of the
'hunter-killer' is]{.underline}, in Gregory's words, [still privileged
as the drone operator empathises with his fellow comrades on the ground
in Afghanistan and feels compelled to 'protect' and 'help' them by
instructing to shoot.]{.underline}28 Ultimately, the 'drone stare' still
furthers the subjuga- tion of those marked as Other.29 [What is of
interest]{.underline} to us [in examining]{.underline} the [interaction
of the virtual, material and human here, however]{.underline}, is that
this occurs not through the experience (on the part of the drone
operator) of distance, remoteness or detachment, but rather through the
'[sense of proximity' to ground troops inculcated by the video
feeds]{.underline} from the [aerial plat- forms]{.underline}.30 The
[relationship between the fleshy body of the drone operator and the
steely body of the drone and]{.underline} its ever-more [sophisticated
optical systems needs to be conceptualised in a way that allows for such
paradoxes to be made intelligible.]{.underline} Moreover, there is
clearly a need to think of the study of the experience of war in new
ways: [if drone operators are not]{.underline} as [shielded
from]{.underline} the [realities of war]{.underline} as is gener- ally
assumed, what might they be bringing into the wider communities of which
they are part? To what extent are their experiences theirs alone, and to
[what extent do we see them seeping out in a wider social
corpus]{.underline}? In Merleau-Ponty's terms, can we see the body (of
the drone operator) 'literally incarnating' material capacities for
agency, and thereby affecting the political disposition of a wider
community?31 It is well estab- lished that soldiers returning from
service run a higher risk of committing domestic violence, and [the US
military has an established programme for combating domestic
violence]{.underline}.32 The high [rate of PTSD amongst drone operators
points to the need for follow-up studies of how these individuals behave
in their home communities.]{.underline} By extension, this suggests that
those interested in the experience of war need to include consideration
also of the experience of -- in this case -- [Nevada communities amidst
which drone operators live]{.underline}. What such studies might yield
we can only guess; yet [it seems reasonable to suspect that the complex
assemblage of virtual and material expe- riences that drone warfare
produces might have its very own repercussions for pro- cesses and
dynamics of societal militarisation]{.underline} and other
manifestations of members' violent experiences set in motion by, but far
exceeding, war itself. In Merleau-Ponty's terms, the human body is not
separate from things, matter or representation; rather, 'the flesh (of
the world or my own) is \... a texture that returns to itself and
conforms to itself'.33 [Human bodies are 'beings-in-the-world',34 and
the material 'reality' of robotic warfare, like the flesh of human
bodies, is irredeemably generative]{.underline}. The fol- lowing section
will expand on how. Agentic Capacities of Material Objects The
[targeting logic of drone warfare **relies on a clear objectification of
people,**]{.underline} [marking and classifying them as 'targets' of
different 'value', with 'high-value targets' most hotly sought for
capture or death]{.underline}, and the more recent expansion of
targeting regimes to cover what are referred to as 'low level
fighters'.35 Advocates of decapitation [strategies using drone
warfare]{.underline} often [rely on precisely]{.underline} such
[objectification of people.36 This is interesting in terms of what
is]{.underline} revealed of [the ethical relation between real
people]{.underline} -- in this case, seemingly allowing for the eschewal
of any real encounter [involving mutual recognition and
recognisability37]{.underline} -- and raises interesting questions about
the way in which that rela- tion is mediated by technology. Yet the
[demarcation between subject and object, between]{.underline} people and
things, between the [human and]{.underline} the [material, is clearly
complicated]{.underline} in more ways than one [by drone war-
fare.]{.underline} From our discussion of the screen's capacity for
interpellation as it 'draws in' and 'captures', we may say that the
screen 'acts'. This, of course, is in addition to the way in which
camera or video footage acts as it enables the representability or
otherwise of human beings.38 [The potency of the screen]{.underline} (or
any digital imagery) in this regard, I want to argue, [vastly exceeds
'representation']{.underline} (though that too occurs, of course).
[Rather, we ought to think of the screen's capacity for action in a much
stronger sense.]{.underline} As such, the force of materiality goes far
beyond what conventional approaches to matter would allow. The power of
the drone to act is thus not confined to the question of the extent to
which the drone acts 'autonomously'. To begin with, drones are already
expected to act independently to some extent: the US Army's Unmanned
Aircraft Systems Roadmap 2010--2035 states that [drones are expected to
be able to 'swarm' with a degree of auton- omy and self-awareness.39
Developments towards decision-making capabilities on the part of drones,
and, crucially, their capacity to decide on attack]{.underline}, are no
doubt alarming and worthy of close attention,40 yet the question of
whether the drone ought be seen as 'acting' does not reside here.
[Drones provide visuals of the world and human beings]{.underline}
therein (they 'see' the world); drones filter the information [they have
in various ways]{.underline} (they 'interpret' the world through pattern
recognition, etc.) and rely on their own inter- pretation to provide
'information' about sites of potential 'danger' and the [human targets
that personify]{.underline} that [danger]{.underline}. The
[subject--object distinction is called into question by the drone's
capacity to 'see' and 'interpret']{.underline}, in much the same way as
Merleau-Ponty invites us to eschew the subject--object distinction when
examining the 'seer' in the form of a seeing individual, a 'seer' who
can never be distinguished from what he 'sees': 'the seer and the
visible need no longer be ontological opposites; the horizon includes
the seer and the world remains horizon because "he who sees is of it and
is in it"'.41 [A phenomenological approach to agency allows us to break
free from]{.underline} the conven- tional [liberal understanding of
agency bound up with an ontology of rational individual-
ism]{.underline} and, further, [to grasp the way in which the ability to
'act' is practised in various degrees across a continuum ranging from
corporeality]{.underline}, through partially rational embod- ied
subjects, to impersonal structures.42 Drawing on Coole's notion of
'agentic capacity' (in turn based on Merleau-Ponty) as a property also
of innate beings, of matter, [we can address the question of drone
autonomy]{.underline} in a very different way from that which focuses
only on the 'pull the trigger' aspect of robotic technologies. The drone
[always and already 'acts',]{.underline} as described above, and [a
critical materialist reading of drone warfare could, as the discussion
above illustrates, just as well focus on the agentic capacities of the
screen as on the actual aerial vehicle capturing the surveillance images
or dropping the bomb.]{.underline} Judith Butler suggests as much in the
preface to the paperback edition of Frames of War, as she invokes drone
warfare to call for new approaches to materiality: Of course, persons
use technological instruments, but instruments surely also use persons
(position them, endow them with perspective, establish the trajectory of
their action); they frame and form anyone who enters into the visual or
audible field, and, accordingly, those who do not \... there can surely
be, and are, different modalities of violence and of the material
instruments of violence.43 This step on the part of Butler is an
important one, not least given her concern for the way in which
attention to the [frames of war allows us to uncover a deeply set
politics and ethics of viewing war and the human beings
therein]{.underline}. Taking into account the [possibility of material
objects having 'agency' provides space also for new conceptions of
political agency.44 We may thus conceive of the drone even as a
political actor, with the crux of the argument being that drones, in
fact, are 'unbearably human' in the sense that they are deeply embedded
within the imperial and military apparatus behind them,]{.underline}
though those human relations are 'masked and mystified'. The [ascription
of human relations]{.underline} to the steely construction of the drone
is [borne out in analysis of how the drone could not have been invented
or constructed other than as part of the particular apparatus of
military power]{.underline} that envisaged their use.45 [Thus, they are
'already' political agents,]{.underline} regardless of the 'actual'
autonomy of their decision-making. Yet another way of
[reading]{.underline} the agen[tic capacity of drones is to think of
them as inducing 'embodied performances' by virtue of]{.underline} their
'[superhuman' qualities]{.underline} -- the fact that the hyper-vision
provided by drone optics far extends human vision through an unblinking,
'all-seeing' stare.46 [Such a reading sheds further light on the paradox
of drone warfare being at once distant and close, and the contradictory
experiences drone warfare gives rise to as killing at a distance
paradoxically makes for a vivid experience for the individual seated in
physical security in his control room,]{.underline} thou- sands of miles
away from the 'actual' action. For Brian Massumi, contemporary war is
'omnipresent'; it is one of a 'total situation'.47 We recognise this
[terminology from critical literature on the]{.underline} global [war on
terror, which has focused on]{.underline} the [discursive expansion of
war to envelop the world]{.underline} as a whole. Yet, the [omnipresence
suggested here is of a different order]{.underline}, based not on the
power of discursive representation, but on the material conditions of
contemporary war. Under these conditions, 'the only way to act \... is
to act on the conditions of emergence of the battle, prior to its occur-
rence \... you must act "totally" on the intangibles of the
situation'.48 As a conse- quence, the [distinction between tangible and
intangible is obliterated]{.underline}: under conditions of omnipresent
war, the boundaries between the corporeal and the incorporeal become
irreversibly blurred: 'To act on the former, you have to act on the
latter.'49 In Massumi's analysis, we have two things going on: a
[temporal shift from the actual to the emer- gent]{.underline} which he
finds intrinsic to the way in which contemporary war is fought (by
Western forces), and [the suggestion that the demarcation between
corporeal and non- corporeal is compromised. The next section will allow
us to draw out further affinities between bodies of flesh and
steel]{.underline} and to tease out the ways in which combining accounts
of material and non-material in a critical phenomenological sense will
fur- ther analysis also of the human in war. The [difficulty with
locating]{.underline} the [corporeal/material]{.underline} and its
[relation to]{.underline} the [incorporeal/ immaterial is central to
critical materialist thinking.]{.underline} It is also an issue that
feminist theo- rising has long struggled with.50 The issue can hardly be
resolved here; I would simply like to make two observations on the place
of the corporeal in the study of contemporary Western warfare prompted
by Massumi's statement. The first concerns perception (of individual
sentient beings) and the second the view of collectives of bodies -- of
'popula- tions' in contemporary war. Both observations are offered as
routes to thinking politi- cally and ethically about the human--material
assemblage that is contemporary war. For Merleau-Ponty, [human
perception is 'primary'; perception is what happens first, prior to
thought, and even prior to 'feeling'.]{.underline} This is the basis of
his existential phenom- enology, and one of the reasons that his
phenomenology does not (as one might other- wise expect) clash with
notions of discursive construction and representation, but rather allows
for both: Just as my body, [as the system of all my holds on the world,
founds the unity of the objects which I perceive, in the same way the
body of the other]{.underline} -- as bearer of [symbolic behaviours and
of the behaviour of true reality -- tears itself away from being one of
my phenomena, offers me the task of true communication, and confers on
my objects the new dimension of intersubjective being or, in other
words, of objectivity]{.underline}.51 The body, in this view, is 'the
pivot of the world' through its capacity for pre-rational sentience --
the bodily experience of feelings such as anxiety, rush, exhilaration.52
(Massumi treads a similar path when he suggests that perception is a
form of 'body mat- ter', and feelings like fear may not best be thought
of as emotions but as 'sharp bodily affect moments'.53) By centring
bodies both in the fleshy material sense and in the emo- tive sense,
Merleau-Ponty's work has important implications for the way in which we
theorise the human--material assemblage of contemporary war. The [focus
on human per- ception and sentience constitutes a counterpart to the
'human' capacities of matter]{.underline} (the agentic capacities of the
camera, screen or drone aircraft). At the same time, the view of the
individual body and its capacity for perception holds implications also
for, and is generalisable to, 'transpersonal qualities of the flesh' --
in other words, for the collective of human beings.54 Accordingly,
individuals are described by Merleau-Ponty as 'organs of one single
intercorporeity'.55 Seeing material and non-material bodies thus is
ulti- mately what allows critical materialism to open up new roads also
of thinking politically. For the [assemblage of human and material in
the contemporary war machine is a political phenomenon, and for us to
understand it politically, we must give due consideration to the complex
whole of which the corporeal and incorporeal are part]{.underline}. This
is what Merleau- Ponty invites us to do as he explores intercorporeity
as an intertwining, a chiasm.56 Merleau-Ponty's notion of humanity is
that of an embodied humanity, involving sentient and sensible bodies,
where thought is interwoven with matter in a single corporeality. This
is the flesh that Merleau-Ponty writes of: a flesh that 'is not matter,
is not mind, is not substance', but 'the coiling over of the visible
upon the seeing body, of the tangible upon the touching body'; the
flesh, in short, is something 'for which there is no other name in
philosophy', according to Merleau-Ponty, and which we can only
approximate as 'an element', 'an element of Being'.57 The second
observation regarding bodies in war [concerns local populations in con-
temporary Western constructions of 'theatres of operation'. With the
reorientation of strategic thinking towards populations as a
whole]{.underline} (populations 'amongst' whom war is fought and who are
considered crucial to the success of the mission),58 [there is a percep-
tible view of populations in their entirety as a 'body'.
Population-centric counterinsur- gency constitutes a very particular way
of relating to local populations]{.underline}, a mode of relating that
is both conceptual and technical. This affinity between material and
discursive ways of constructing the corpus of local populations is
[especially revealing of the politics and ethics of contemporary
counterinsurgency war.]{.underline} On the one hand, we can see the
effects of new technologies for surveillance and target- ing as a means
of constructing or producing populations: certain individuals are
'tagged' and 'tracked', whilst others are constituted as [the grey mass
of non-existence or possibly 'collateral damage'. Consider, for
instance, the way in which the US military counts all adult males killed
in drone strikes as 'militants' unless these individuals are
specifically exonerated after their death.]{.underline}59 On the other
hand, we have the discursive far-end of coun- terinsurgency war,
manifest in the recent focus on the concept of 'strategic communica-
tion' in US and UK military circles.60 The [logic of strategic
communication instructs the verbal stratification of populations in
theatres of operation according to how receptive they are believed to be
to the message communicated by the intervening forces. Inspired by
commercial logics of marketing, populations are strategised into
distinct 'audiences']{.underline} -- from those whose hearts and minds
are thought amenable to change to the 'die hard' terrorists, on whom no
communication campaign, however 'effective', will work and who thus can
only be removed through capture or death. [A sinister objectification of
local populations unites these seemingly disparate features of
contemporary Western cam- paigns -- an objectification that warns of a
very particular ethical relation, or, rather, non- relation. The
construction of populations in contemporary warfare is thus both
ideational/ discursive and material: the discursive construction of
populations into audiences/targets is matched by the material realities
and agentic capacities of surveillant and other auto- mated weapons
systems]{.underline}. The corporeal encroaches on the incorporeal and
vice versa.

#### Translatory politics are critical to understanding the way non-human agencies shape politics -- that disrupts normative epistemologies surrounding non-human actors and attend to the way those technologies are analyzed and directed by international institutions -- international relations are just as integral to war-making as the technological instruments used to facilitate it

**Barry '13** (Andrew Barry, Millennium - Journal of International
Studies 2013, "The Translation Zone: Between Actor-Network Theory and
International Relations, March 2013, DOI: 10.1177/0305829813481007, LASA

**[During the 1980s and 1990s actor-network theory developed largely in
the emerging field of science and technology studies and, in particular,
the sub-field of the sociology of scientific knowledge.]{.underline}**
At this time, it was not primarily known as a social theory at all, but
rather as an increasingly influential approach in the sociology of
science and technol- ogy. These origins remain significant, for the
study of science and technology opened up the **[critical importance of
studies of expertise for the anthropology of]{.underline}** the
contemporary and the question of the role of **[non-human agencies and
forces in social and political life]{.underline}**. In this way,
actor-network theorists sought to reverse a move made by the sociologist
Emile Durkheim who argued, in a critique of Gabriel Tarde, that the
'physical' environ- ment had nothing to do with the 'social' phenomenon
of suicide.35 For Durkheim, **[there was a clear division between the
proper domains of social and natural scientific research. By contrast,
one of the tasks the early actor-network theorists set themselves was to
attend to the agency of non-human actors]{.underline}**, including the
physical environment, in social and political life. In this way,
**[actor-network theory]{.underline}** poses two immediate challenges
for international relations. Firstly, it **[raises the problem of how to
think through the significance of non- humans, including surveillance
devices, pollutants, mineral resources and biological material, and
international relations]{.underline}**, however the latter is conceived.
Secondly, science and technology **[studies direct us to the critical
importance of scientific and technical knowledge to international
relations, whether this knowledge is related to nuclear and biological
weapons, climate change, carbon markets, genetically modified organisms,
biodiversity or computer security. The challenge of actor-network
theory, in the guise of science and technology studies, is not just to
recognise the general importance of scien- tific institutions and
epistemic communities in international relations, but to attend to the
ways in which specific claims to scientific knowledge acquire a
remarkable political and governmental importance]{.underline}**. In
short, international relations has to be concerned with the content of
scientific knowledge claims and not just the social and institutional
forms through which they are articulated. Where might these challenges
lead? I shall briefly describe two examples of the ways in which both
material object and scientific knowledge play a part in international
relations, drawing on my own research. Firstly, 15 years ago, when I was
working on a book about the European Union, **[I became interested in
the fact that the only visible sign of the EU in the neighbourhood of
Goldsmiths College in south-east London, where I then taught, was an
experimental air-quality monitoring zone.]{.underline}** The observation
was both surprising and instructive. For while the teachers, policemen
and doctors of **[south-east London were regulated and employed by
national and local institutions, the measure- ment of air
quality]{.underline}** was partly a European matter, the **[development
of an air-quality monitoring zone acquired European support and
measurements of air quality were based on European standards. In short,
the molecular composition of the air became a matter of concern to
international institutions in a way in which, for example, the edu-
cational curricula of London schools or the conduct of the Metropolitan
Police was not]{.underline}**. If one was to find international
relations in this place, one needed to examine the politi- cal
organisation of measurement or the constitution of what I have termed
its metrologi- cal zones.36 The presence of the European Union in
south-east London rendered the air of this part of the city comparable
to the air in Paris or Milan. More generally, **[if one wanted to
list]{.underline}** all **[those things that had been transformed
through the development of the European Union, one would need to
consider not just]{.underline}** the **[political

bulbs or toxic chemicals]{.underline}**.37 A second example derives from
fieldwork carried out along the route of **[the Baku-- Tbilisi--Ceyhan
oil pipeline in Georgia]{.underline}** in 2004--5. This **[led to a
brief investigation into the circumstances in which Donald Rumsfeld and
Colin Powell became indirectly involved in the question of whether the
pipeline should be buried one or two metres beneath the
ground,]{.underline}** an issue that had been discussed in meetings
between the Georgian and US governments in the summer of 2004. For a
period at least, the **[technicalities of pipeline construction became
an issue of international politics.]{.underline}** Fieldwork also led to
the deliberations by **[the Trade]{.underline}** and Industry
**[Committee of the British House]{.underline}** of Commons in London
that **[had]{.underline}** surprisingly **[come to be intensely
interested in the synthetic material that joined two sections of pipe
together]{.underline}**, following the failure of the coating material
in the winter of 2003--4. This interest arose **[following allegations
that BP, which played a]{.underline}** lead **[role in the construction
of the pipeline]{.underline}**, had failed to inform the UK government
of the failure of the coating material even though the UK Export Credit
Guarantee Department was in the process of deciding whether to support
the project. **[In these cir- cumstances, the House of Commons Trade and
Industry Select Committee received reports about the technicalities of
pipeline engineering and material science in Georgia]{.underline}**; but
at the time, this committee had no interest in the significance of the
Rose revolution that had brought the government of Eduard Shevardnadze
to an end in late 2003, or **[in]{.underline}** the pot**[ential
relation between the oil pipeline and]{.underline}** the **[possibility
of armed conflict in the Caucasus, which]{.underline}** in the event
**[did break out just three years later]{.underline}** in August 2008.38
In the Commons in 2005, the **[relations between Britain and Georgia
were discussed]{.underline}** only **[in the context of a controversy
about the suitability]{.underline}** and integrity **[of]{.underline}**
a **[pipeline coating mate- rial, not in relation to]{.underline}** the
**[potential for civil war or international conflict in the
region]{.underline}**. One of the lessons of science and technology
studies in general, and actor-network the- ory in particular, is an
empirical and methodological one. **[In]{.underline}** the **[study of
international relations, we should not ignore the significance of pipes,
coating materials and air-quality monitoring devices to political life,
but trace the importance of such objects wherever they may
lead.]{.underline}** Such materials and devices play an integral role in
the conduct of govern- ment. At the same time, the design, construction
and **[properties of materials]{.underline}** and tech- nologies can
**[themselves become objects of international dispute]{.underline}**.
Rather than take the existence of such objects for granted, as a stable
base on which the superstructure of international politics is
subsequently erected, we have to recognise that their **[material
existence can itself become a political matter.]{.underline}** The
empirical examples I have just outlined are more than just empirical
examples which can be readily added to the range of examples typically
studied by those interested in international relations. After all, their
study involves some understanding of specific fields of science and
engineering, such as atmospheric chemistry and pipeline engineer- ing.
Social scientists, including theorists of international relations, have
become attracted to natural scientific accounts of complexity and chaos
in recent years, **[viewing such approaches as the source of new
insights that can be translated into the social sciences. But one of the
lessons of science and technology studies is that researchers in
interna- tional relations also have to consider the importance of the
more mundane accounts of materials and their properties, such as
pipelines and air]{.underline}**, which are routinely generated by
natural scientists. The **[challenge of science and technology studies
-- in its actor-network theoretical version in particular -- is to think
through the relations between the molecular and the
international.]{.underline}** This is likely to involve a much closer
attention to the practices of the natural sciences than has hitherto
tended to exist in the discipline of international relations.

### AT: Realism/Lib-ism

#### Traditional IR theory misconstrues weapons as tools which augment state power; refuse their totalizing model in favor of a materialist study that foregrounds the agency of objects in social life.

[Traditional IR theory views weapons as tools, which augment or diminish
state power, but do not change its essential functioning]{.underline}.
Consequently, IR focuses on how different actors deploy weapons in
balances of power, strategic windows, or institutional
patterns[.]{.underline} However, by rendering war 'unwinnable' the
invention of nuclear power complicates this relationship (Jervis

and presents an anomaly in state-centric explanations of power (Herz

Contemporary theories have used the anomalies of nuclear politics as a
way of rereading the political tradition (Deudney
[2007](https://www-tandfonline-com.proxy.lib.umich.edu/doi/full/10.1080/21624887.2017.1312149)Deudney,

Nonetheless, the tool-based explanation of weapons remains prominent
even in the context of nuclear politics where various problems related
to proliferation, accidents, misuse, testing, and mining are understood
as forms of mismanagement or poor policy (Perrow

Constructivist and critical approaches thus challenge the naturalness of
the state's control of weaponry. [Unfortunately, this upside comes at
the cost of treating weapons as largely derivative of social
belief]{.underline}. [The materiality of weapons, procedures of
technical design and engineering, and the affective properties of
weapons are consequently treated as secondary in this
approach]{.underline}. For example, Helen Kinsella's *The Image Before
the Weapon*, which offers a brilliant gene aealogy of the 'principle of
distinction', shows how gender and power produce the division between
combatants and non-combatants
([2011](https://www-tandfonline-com.proxy.lib.umich.edu/doi/full/10.1080/21624887.2017.1312149)Kinsella,

6). However, the account privileges the articulation of this social
division largely independent of the materiality of the different
targeting, delivery, and mechanical systems constitutive of
weapons[.]{.underline} While the relationship the principle of
distinction has clear implications for weapon design and deployment,
[weapon systems also make substantive contributions to the formation of
the combatant non-combatant division by establishing the conditions of
possibility for a social distinction to be operational.]{.underline} In
this respect, a materialist approach deepens the resources available for
critical insights into the genesis of social distinctions regarding the
use of weapons. [Indeed, recent work in new materialism, object-oriented
ontology, and speculative realism foregrounds the agency of objects in
social life.]{.underline} While there is considerable debate over the
merits of different approaches to non-human entities, these theories
offer an important rebuttal to classic realism, rational human interest,
and social construction as explanations of causality and ontology

According to these theories, objects of all kinds resist the categories,
representations, and strategies applied to them while producing
unintended or unanticipated changes in politics[.]{.underline} Focusing
on objects consequently shifts the register for interpreting security
institutions as independent entities, which have productive effects on
security and insecurity (Grove

[Object-centred analysis thus challenges a basic conceit of IR theory by
opening up the black box of objects. Materialist analyses similarly
introduce an alternative reading of the role of weapons in political
life because they afford weaponry an indeterminate, yet significant
potential to influence other actors.]{.underline} While it is beyond the
scope of this article to fully outline materialist approaches, whether
understood in terms of 'actants', 'thing power', or 'aesthetic
dimension', the key value of materialist thinking is to destabilise the

In doing so, materialist theories enter new entities and relations into
security analysis and offer new explanations of the emergence of
violence[. The specific approach adopted by this article is to view
relations between human and non-human objects as a series of affective
encounters, which produce desire or motive force. In this context,
desire does not refer to static or mutable human interests, but
preconscious social drives and impulses, which constitute the
motivational forces that give form to individual interest]{.underline}

In this sense, ['desire']{.underline} as discussed throughout the
article [relies on Deleuze and Guattari's vision of desire as a series
of forces that produce a social field, which in turn frames how
individuals respond to a particular set of possibilities.]{.underline}
As the next section will detail[, this approach explores points of
contact between human and non-human things, which allows for formative
relationships to emerge between them without treating one element of
this relationship as fully dominant. In this sense, this article
theorises how human--weapon encounters produce forms of desire, which
slowly develop into stable relationships between weapons and
humans.]{.underline} The benefit of this approach is that [it does not
predetermine the meaning of weapons by assuming they operate as
instruments of violence,]{.underline} their human intended use[, but
instead examines their various 'productive' effects on human fantasies,
bodies, and politics.]{.underline} At present, critical literature on
weapons engages the relationship to materiality in several ways. First,
a burgeoning literature examines specific weapon assemblages such as
tanks, planes, chemical weapons, landmines, or small arms (Larrinaga

### AT: State/Macropolitics=Independent

#### Assemblage and object oriented ontology allow for the pursuit of dynamics of social change -- adopting this mindset in the sense of international relations allows entities of larger scale to reflect on the smaller scale objectives that compromise them 

M. **Muller**, 20**15**, \[\[\[Professor and DeepMind Chair in
Artificial Intelligence, Geography Compass, \"Assemblages and
Actor-Networks: Rethinking Socio-material Power, Politics and Space\",
<https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/gec3.12192>\]\]\] jf\
Ontology: We should stress that not all scholars want to go so far as
DeLanda does in making assemblages the building blocks for an entire
ontology or metaphysical system. [Sassen]{.underline} for one, as her
contribution to this volume makes clear, eschews such lofty
considerations in her insistence that she [uses assemblage as a
methodological tool to destabilize established discourses and meanings
in her pursuit of the dynamics of social change]{.underline}. But in
Deleuze, DeLanda and Latour, we have self-conscious metaphysical
operators shaping empirical considerations. If, as Colin Wight (2006: 2)
has argued, '[politics is the terrain of competing ontologies', we need
to ask: of what features does an assemblage ontology partake, and why
might such an ontology offer an improvement on those that IR scholar's
have held]{.underline}? [Assemblage theory is driven in large part by
dissatisfaction with the dominant ontologies that have characterized
social theory, including international theory]{.underline}. [One of
the]{.underline} defining characteristics of mainstream [approaches to
IR has been state-centrism.]{.underline} Assemblage theory's most
obvious promise is that it rules out such reification: it seeks to
replace such abstractions with concrete histories of the processes by
which entities are formed and made to endure. [Something like 'the
state' can only be talked about in terms of the heterogeneous elements
that comprise specific historically situated states, and the processes
and mechanisms that provide it with the emergent properties and
capacities of statehood]{.underline}. The same holds true for
'capitalism' the 'city' or 'society' -- t[hese categories are too blunt
to offer the fine-grained analysis of concrete historical processes and
entities **that assemblage thinking forces us to focus
on**]{.underline}. Traditional thinking in IR has, building from the
reification of states as units, tended to emphasize simple and
relatively closed systems, leading to the familiar assumptions about
equilibrium, cyclicality and predictability that we find in the
rationalist IR paradigm. In such theories, [systems are commonly seen as
no more than the sum of their parts -- thus ruling out emergent
properties]{.underline}. Shifting to the type of complex-systems
paradigm that assemblages offer opens up a new theoretical vista, and
engages fully with concepts such as emergence, non-linearity, openness,
adaptation, feedback and path-dependency (Bousquet and Curtis 2011).
[Although predictability in complex systems is tightly constrained, the
possibilities for analysis of the system's historical development offer
a much richer resource for understanding transitions from one systemic
configuration to another]{.underline}. [One of the useful
results]{.underline} of thinking this way about parts and wholes [is
that we are left with a 'flat ontology' of individuals]{.underline}
(Latour 2005). [Any assemblage, as a concrete historical individual, has
the same ontological status as any other assemblage, regardless of size
or scale]{.underline}.4 Given that IR has moved in the general direction
of pluralist conceptions of the international system[, this ontology can
provide a valuable starting point for the analysis of various social
actors, including **transnational corporations, institutional networks,
epistemic communities, nation-states, cities and terrorist networks,**
which are often kept separate in theories founded on ontologies that
make them incommensurable]{.underline}. In DeLanda's sketch of the
nested formation of different assemblages, larger wholes always emerge
from the interaction of heterogeneous parts at a lower level of scale.
This process of assemblage takes place repeatedly at various scales, as
larger entities emerge from arrays of smaller components: [individual
persons emerge from a range of sub-personal components, communities
emerge from the interaction of individuals, institutions and networks
emerge from the interaction of communities, cities emerge from these
networks and institutions, and states emerge from networks of cities as
well as other networks and institutions.]{.underline} In this way,
[assemblages become the component parts of other assemblages, and the
previously reified notion of society may be viewed as a historically
specific assemblage of assemblages, open to transformation]{.underline}.
The upward movement of processes of assemblage through these various
(always provisional) wholes should not lead us to discount the causal
power of 'structures'. [Although assemblage theory offers a bottom-up
perspective, it also contains an account of emergent topdown causality
-- **the ability of entities at larger scales to react back on the parts
that comprise them**.]{.underline} As DeLanda (2010: 12) makes clear**[,
'once a larger scale assemblage is in place, it immediately starts
acting as a source of limitations and resources for its
components']{.underline}**. This bears similarity to the conception of
structuration in Anthony Giddens's work (1984) or morphogenesis in
Margaret Archer's work (1995), but here it is the concept of emergent
capabilities that explains the structuring capacities of heterogeneous
social entities. [Sequence and temporality become vital: assemblages are
born into a pre-existing configuration of other assemblages]{.underline}
-- so although theoretically we are asked to follow the upward movement
of processes of assemblage, social reality is actually inherently
non-linear. [Assemblage thinking is thus comfortable with modelling
structures while seeking to undermine structuralism.]{.underline} It is
also important to note that [an assemblage approach to agency asks
important questions about where agency is to be found. When we talk
about the agency of an assemblage of heterogeneous social and material
elements we deal with a form of agency that is both emergent and
distributed across the entire assemblage]{.underline} (Dittmer 2013). As
Nick Srnicek argues here, in his consideration of the cognitive
assemblages developing around climate science or financial markets, it
is the entire assemblage that acts -- and [these are assemblages that
include in their components not just individual persons and groups and
their knowledge, but also the technological tools and measuring
instruments that have been developed to allow modelling and intervention
in the market and the climate]{.underline}: data collection tools,
computer models, software and data sets. This concept of distributed
agency, with its attendant decentring of the human subject of modern
liberal thought, and as part of the wider turn to post-anthropocentrism
or post-humanism (Cudworth and Hobden 2011), makes some scholars
distinctly uncomfortable with the implications of assemblage thought, a
view reflected here in the chapter by David Chandler.

#### Theories that detail the emergence of weapons in the context of gender, race, coloniality, and power fail to account for the material dimension of weaponry- instead, begin with an analysis of the power of the weapon.

[This literature directly comments on the relationship between weapons
and the intelligibility of violence and often shows how weapon devices
produce phenomenological frames that legitimate war and trauma. However,
critiques of weapon targeting often view weapons as passive structuring
agents rather than active contributors to the formation of human
experience. As such, this article explores a variety of features of
weaponry, which implicate practices of targeting, and also complicate
the relationship between humans and weapons in broader
contexts.]{.underline} In addition, a number of important materialist
analyses of weapons have emerged focusing on the agentic capacities of
weapons in nuclear politics, militarisation, and warfare more generally

[These approaches are largely consonant with the theory advanced in this
article.]{.underline} However, unlike this piece, they do not place
theoretical emphasis on the relationship between weapons and the
production of desire. [This emphasis on materialism and desire offers
three important contributions to the field of critical security studies.
First, focusing on desire adds depth to existing explanations of the
genesis of attachment to weaponry at both social and somatic
levels.]{.underline} Hence, this article provides an alternative account
of how specific procedures of targeting, particular practices of
warfare, or even certain classes of weapons become dominant. [In
contrast to a materialist approach centred exclusively on technical or
social side, the focus on desire opens up both aspects as mutually
constitutive of security politics. Second, the article concentrates on
the affective potential of weapons.]{.underline} Unlike ANT and other
materialist theories, this approach places less emphasis on the network
or series of relations that define an object in favour of highlighting
how weapons operate on the basis of affective potentials[.]{.underline}
By reading affective encounters back into classic literature on war, the
article foregrounds how material agencies have been explicitly left out
of security studies literature and demonstrates the impact for
contemporary theories of wa[r.]{.underline} Finally, the article extends
materialist analysis to the example of drone warfare and shows how even
critical readings of weaponry rely on dominant models or images of
weaponry. In specific, this piece challenges the widespread belief that
remote warfare constitutes a novel development in weapon autonomy rather
than a reproduction of many classical dynamics of weaponisation. In this
way, the article makes a contribution by countering the claim that
drones represent an unprecedented form of war.

Hyperobjects also presents useful insights for scholars interested in

apathy, leftist cynicism, and global warming denialism are
persuasive]{.underline}. Humans have spurned nonhuman objects that will
be "responsible for the next moment of human history and thinking"

### 1NC Affect Focus Bad

#### Affect isn't a basis for politics---they provide no recourse for dealing with atrocities

**Sherwin, 15**---New York Law School (Richard, "Too Late for Thinking:
The Curious Quest for Emancipatory Potential in Meaningless Affect and
Some Jurisprudential Implications", Law, Culture and the Humanities
1--13, October 13, 2015, dml)

In the history of western culture we can point to three historic moments
of epistemological de-centering. The Copernican revolution taught
humanity that we do not dwell at the center of the universe. The
Freudian revolution taught us that the ''I'' is a lonely island besieged
on all sides by a raging sea of irrational, unconscious forces. Then
quantum theory taught us that the universe is indeterminate: subject to
uncanny chance operations. [Affect theory]{.underline}, perhaps as an
extension of the Darwinian evolutionary account of selective adaptation,
**[humbles rationalist pretensions]{.underline}** further [by
subordinating mind to material, bio-chemical processes. If thinking is
always an after-thought, an after-the-fact construction, then we **can
never reliably account** for how we've **actually been affected** by
things and others in the world around us]{.underline}.

How oppressive never to escape the grip of contingent social constructs.
How depressing, if endless deconstruction yields only more
fragmentation. Surely something must abide, some Higgs Boson-like
elementary particle that can withstand deconstruction's powerful blows.
Is there anything real enough to withstand critique? Is there any basis
left to hope for emancipation from the destabilizing mutability of human
fabrication? In Brian Massumi's view, there is. As he puts it: "The
world always already offers degrees of freedom ready for
amplification."22 This takes us to the heart of the vitalist/ liberation
impulse, namely: "escape from crystallized power structures."23

[In Massumi's writings, affect operates as **a cipher**]{.underline} --
[a black box into which he can pack his emancipatory
ideal]{.underline}.24 ("'Affect' is the word I use for 'hope.'"25) What
[Massumi]{.underline} does not and perhaps [cannot]{.underline}, or
simply does not care to do is [formulate **a coherent basis for
political judgment**]{.underline}. While [he]{.underline} at some points
[expresses]{.underline} a [preference for "caring" and
"belonging]{.underline},"26 [he offers **no basis** in affect theory for
why those forms of behavior are preferable to other **perhaps more
intense alternatives**]{.underline}, such as "anger" and "shock," which
he also embraces.27 [But **choices must be made**]{.underline}. As
Martha Nussbaum has noted, [a society that cultivates conditions of
anger and disgust]{.underline}, for example, [is different from one that
promotes empathy, dignity, and love]{.underline}.28

[Massumi is enamored of the anti-structural]{.underline},29 [the
spontaneous emergent process]{.underline} that Deleuze called "pure
immanence." But [with affective intensity as his ultimate
value]{.underline}30 [Massumi remains **trapped in a double bind**. No
critical judgment is forthcoming **so long as intensity may be
amplified**]{.underline}.31 [Because of this Massumi **cannot coherently
critique manifestly oppressive political structures** (such as futurism,
Nazism, and other intensity-fueled political regimes]{.underline}). [How
could he if the masses have opted to embrace such regimes **for the
intensity they provide**?]{.underline}

Massumi's resistance to making judgments is consistent with his theory,
which minimizes to the vanishing point the human capacity for choice.
For Massumi, [the very notions of ''individual will'' and ''subjective
reflection'' are a fiction]{.underline}. ("There is no individual
outside its own trans-individual becoming."32) [Body is always
conditioning mind -- presumably without our conscious awareness. In the
end, "events decide."]{.underline}33 [**What could human freedom mean
under such conditions**?]{.underline}

The upshot is plain: [in Massumi's politics of affect, human freedom
**loses its capacity to signify**. Choices are a fiction,
and]{.underline} in any event [no apparent normative basis exists for
**affirming**, much less **institutionalizing** a preferred set of power
structures. Affective intensity **lacks structure by
definition**]{.underline}. Indeed, that is its appeal. ("Intensity is a
value in itself."34) But as Anthony Kronman has eloquently argued,
[without **coherent structures**, the **legal**, **political**, and
**cultural conditions** necessary for the **meaningful exercise of
freedom** (including **political judgment**) are **unlikely to emerge**
-- and if they do, they are **unlikely to be
sustainable**.]{.underline}35 The latter point is borne out by the very
political events that Massumi identifies as exemplary of his theory. [If
the "Arab Spring" and the "Occupy Movement]{.underline}"36 [illustrate
anything it is the **effervescence** of political action based on
**spontaneous intensity**. In the absence of **adequate political
structures**, this kind of political action is destined to pass with the
next day's tide]{.underline}.

The emancipatory cri du coeur that can be heard echoing in the work of
cultural theorists like Massumi may have landed on "trans-individual"
affect as the intensive Higgs Boson wave-particle of political science.
Its indeconstructability promises freedom from subjective and cultural
contingency -- the prison house of "crystallized power structures." But
there is a price to be paid. [The radical devaluation of reflective
consciousness produces a species of freedom that signifies
nothing]{.underline}. Perhaps this is what it is like to embrace a
Zeitgeist of "de-humanism."37

In Massumi's politics of affect we can discern the impetus for
''vitalist/liberation'' ideology. As Ben Anderson writes: "There is
always already an excess \[affect\] that power must work to recuperate
but is destined and doomed to miss. It is that excess that is central to
the creativity of bio-political production and thus the power of naked
life."38 [Affect in this sense is "a movement of creative production"
that always eludes capture. And this is what conveys a sense of its
emancipatory power]{.underline}.39 The intensity of affect liberates us
from bondage to contingent cultural entanglement.

Corporeal ontology precedes cultural epistemology. This move away from
the centrality of cognition marks the demise not only of identity
politics, but of identity itself, perhaps even of psychology.40 Simply
stated, [affect theorists]{.underline} like Massumi [romanticize the
unknowable "fluid materiality of excitable networks" as a way of
disrupting familiar social and cultural hierarchies]{.underline}.41 In
so doing, [they elevate raw process over social and cultural
regimentation and subjugation]{.underline}. It is the neurobiological
equivalent of Rousseau's primitive origin of society, an updated version
of the Romantics' myth of enchantment. [**If only** questions about
freedom and responsibility for shared values, justice included, could be
resolved by **so simple an expedient** as the]{.underline}
vitalist/liberation category [shift from human agency to
''trans-individual affective process]{.underline}.'' [Much can be
learned about **the various forms of political violence** that affective
intensity has assumed over the course of human history]{.underline}. But
one needn't take the historical path to discern trouble for Massumi's
emancipatory project. One can start with neuroscience itself.42

[Theorists]{.underline} like Massumi [play down]{.underline} (as they
must) a variety of **[obstacles]{.underline}** that stand [in the way of
affective emancipation: from the constraints of evolution to the
biological programming of the amygdala itself]{.underline}.43 Indeed,
[what constitutes ''fearfulness]{.underline},'' for example, [depends
upon programming]{.underline} the amygdala [based on]{.underline} a
habituated pattern of **[external stimuli]{.underline}**.44

There are other problems as well. For instance, a great deal of
[**uncertainty** surrounds the question of how communication occurs
among different levels of the mind/body complex]{.underline}. As Steve
Pile writes, for theorists like Massumi "affect is defined in opposition
to cognition, reflexivity, consciousness and humanness."45 Feelings, on
the other hand, occupy a space between non-cognitive affect and highly
socialized emotions. Feelings in this sense are pre-cognitive ("a
response to transpersonal affects").46 Our response to affects
personalizes them. Through feelings we associate affects with the
subject who experiences them. For their part, emotions reflect a shift
from pre-cognitive subjectivity to the cognitive domain of socially
constructed experience.47 Emotions, in this sense, are how I interpret
what I'm feeling through language and other representational or cultural
symbolic practices.

[Affect theorists]{.underline} like Massumi [insist that]{.underline} my
[choices and]{.underline} perhaps even my [feelings may]{.underline}
turn out to [have **nothing to do** with the affect my body has already
processed without my knowing it. This view preserves the **purity of
affective intensity** by keeping it **free of subjective or social
significance**]{.underline}. If you are in the ''vitalist/liberation''
camp of affect theory along with Massumi, [affect can never be
symbolized, which means it can never be cognized]{.underline}. Affect,
in this view, [is]{.underline} always beyond consciousness. It's
[like]{.underline} the [dark matter]{.underline} that makes up the
universe: [we know it's there, **we just can't say anything about
it**]{.underline}.

[The problem for]{.underline} ''vitalist/liberation'' [theorists like
Massumi is that they **want to eat their cake and have it too**. Affects
for them are ciphers -- free-ranging radicals incapable of signifying.
Yet]{.underline}, at the same time, many of [these same theorists engage
in searing critiques of those "in power" who use]{.underline} mass media
along with other instrumentalities of [affective manipulation for
purposes of enhancing social or political control]{.underline}.48 [The
difficulty is this: If affect is being actively engineered to manipulate
people's behavior]{.underline} -- whether in the form of habits of
consumption, political judgments, or jury verdicts -- [it is
**incumbent** upon the theorists to account for **how exactly this
manipulation is being carried out**]{.underline}. As Pile cogently
notes, [how are the agents of affective manipulation able to "know the
unknowable" **sufficiently well to control their course and impact in
society?**]{.underline}49

Thrift's [recourse to metaphors]{.underline} such as "pipes and cables"
[is hardly sufficient to bear the burden of scientific
explanation]{.underline}. Indeed, [the nomenclature that has emerged to
account for the engineering of affect -- ranging from "affect flow
between bodies," "transmissions," and "contagion]{.underline}"50 -- [all
seem to suffer from **the same fundamental lack of explanatory power**.
If we cannot know what affects are, it stands to reason that **we cannot
know how to control their flow** and **impact in society**.]{.underline}

**Sherwin, 15**---New York Law School (Richard, "Too Late for Thinking:
The Curious Quest for Emancipatory Potential in Meaningless Affect and
Some Jurisprudential Implications", Law, Culture and the Humanities
1--13, October 13, 2015, dml)

[The "affective turn" presents]{.underline} a number of **[important
challenges]{.underline}** to law and the humanities. One such challenge
concerns our ability to resist the temptation to romanticize the
inhuman. [Theorists]{.underline} from Nietzsche to Massumi [have been so
taken by the emancipatory promise of affective intensity that they risk
**relinquishing responsibility** for freedom's necessary **social**,
**political**, and **legal pre-conditions**.]{.underline}

[The defense of freedom in a resilient democratic society requires
**informed choice** as well as **prudent deliberation in the
decision-making process**. Democracy **cannot flourish** as a
non-cognitive phenomenon. Forgoing **self-reflexive moral judgment** and
**debate** invites **all manner of affective intensities**. Futurism's
romantic obsession with **the affective intensity of war**, Mussolini's
**fascist appeal**]{.underline} to the cult of charismatic personality,
[and Hitler's **hate-fueled vision of racial dominance**
exemplify]{.underline} ([as have other social and political movements
before them]{.underline}) [the dynamics and consequences of political
discourse **driven by unthinking affective intensity**]{.underline}.

[Law's humanity requires **clarity in the decisions we make** as well as
in **the choices we forgo**]{.underline}. This includes the capacity to
consider who we become as individuals and as a society when we choose
one narrative, rooted in one set of affective intensities, as opposed to
another.

[Our responsibility]{.underline} for narrative construction and
narrative choice [carries]{.underline} with it [an ethical imperative to
understand the orchestration of affect]{.underline}. Recent developments
along these lines in legal and political theory invite us to be mindful
of this need.60 [The issue]{.underline} for legal and political theory
and practice today [is **not** whether affects, feelings, and emotions
play a role in the construction of social, political, and legal meaning.
**They do**. The **more challenging question** is how this occurs, and
**with what impact** upon our social, political, and legal
institutions?]{.underline}

[Downplaying the importance of **reflective consciousness** (including
our capacity for prudent judgment) in favor of **spontaneous affective
events** invites **tragedy**]{.underline}. In this respect, Massumi's
romantic ideal is misplaced. [It is not the indeconstructability of
affect that ought to capture our imagination. What ought to concern us
most is **the nature of the social**, **political**, and **ethical
implications** of a given affective configuration. That configuration is
**not beyond us**. It is us, or at least it implicates us, as part of
what makes us who we are -- either as participants **actively
contributing to**, or spectators **passively colluding in** the world of
meaning that our choices (or our failure to make choices)
construct.]{.underline}

**Joronen and Häkli, 16**---Space and Political Agency Research Group,
School of Management, University of Tampere (Mikko and Jouni,
"Politicizing ontology," Prog Hum Geogr June 10, 2016, dml)

The ways in which an [onto-theological lock-in]{.underline} easily
[turns into **'theoretical path dependency'**, **directing** and
**circumscribing** how the political is taken up]{.underline} is further
illustrated by Lorimer's (2012) elaborate discussion on the consequences
of vitalist ontologies for the science and practice of biodiversity
conservation. He carefully elucidates several problems that might
benefit from rethinking in a vitalist vein and shows that the approach
resonates strongly with a number of concrete issues. However, as Lorimer
(2012) notes himself many of these are confined to topics that are "well
known and much debated among conservationists" (Lorimer, 2012: 600).
Again, we argue that [vitalist ontologies would gain **much more
political resonance** from giving consideration to settings in
which]{.underline} biodiversity [conservation meets forces and processes
unfolding in **actually existing** compositions, events and political
rationalities]{.underline}. This is because [the practices]{.underline}
of biodiversity conservation seldom operate autonomously, but rather
they [are **deeply enmeshed** with **fierce political disputes** related
to]{.underline}, for example, [the]{.underline} excessive [use of
natural resources]{.underline} by multinational corporations (e.g.
Zingerli, 2005) [or political steering processes]{.underline} (e.g.
Humalisto & Joronen, 2013).

There is more at stake in theoretical path dependency than just a
pre-defined and often narrow conception of what counts as politics. [The
tendency]{.underline} of onto-theologically oriented approaches [to
operate within their 'comfort zones' leaves many pressing]{.underline}
(human and social) [problems **unattended** and thus **seriously
thwarts** the **societal relevance** and **potential impact** of the
work itself]{.underline} -- a problem that McNay (2014: 205-206) calls
"social weightlessness" of political thought. [We consider this a **high
price to pay** for ontological novelty operating]{.underline}, as
Castree (2006: 169) writes, "[at **several moves** from
**real-world**]{.underline} scientific enterprise and its wider social
and environmental **[consequences]{.underline}**".

Politics without the (human) subject

[The]{.underline} second encounter between onto-theological
[reasoning]{.underline} and the political [**troubles the very idea of
politics** as it introduces non-human entities as political agents on a
par with humans]{.underline} and by distributing the subject of
political agency into contingently emerging assemblages. [This move is
seen as a **necessary corrective** to human exceptionalism]{.underline}
embedded in "modernity's ontological homage to a Cartesian dualism" that
separates humans from non-human nature and views the former as superior
in comparison to other entities (Coole, 2005: 125; see also Braun, 2008;
Lorimer, 2012). In introducing a turn away from an anthropocentric
conception of political agency that presupposes "the priority of human
intentions" (Bennett, 2005: 455-456), the building of a posthumanist
ontology carries emancipatory potential by underlining the
interdependency between human and non-human worlds. In addition, it
shows the position of humans as merely one among many politically
consequential events, objects and phenomena, most of which are non-human
or are at least more-than-human (Whatmore, 2002; Hinchliffe, 2008; Braun
and Whatmore, 2010; Latta, 2014).

It is this potential that has received positive responses even from
those who otherwise remain skeptical about the possibility of expanding
the political to include non-humans in something like "cosmopolitics"
unfolding in a "parliament of things" (Latour, 1993; Stengers, 1997).
While Braun (2011: 392), for instance, critically questions the
extensive political charge that vitalist ontologies give to non-humans
like "hurricanes, viruses and electrical grids", he nevertheless notes
that vitalism "may offer a valuable ethical and practical orientation to
the world" with environmental problems of catastrophic proportions
(Braun, 2008: 677). In a similar vein Abrahamsson et al. (2015: 16) note
that "the general claim that 'things have politics' has become too
vague", yet they admit that "political theory should concern itself with
the material world \[...\] in times of pollution, species extinction,
global warming and so on" (Abrahamsson et al., 2015: 5). Arguably, it is
in rethinking human-nature relationships and the illusion of
technological mastery over the non-human world where new ontologies,
usually under the title 'posthuman', operate on the least contentious
terrain. **[Few scholars]{.underline}**, including us, [deny the
**urgency** of complex environmental problems and the need to critically
question modes of thinking that have led to their escalation globally.
**Nonetheless**, when the notion of non-human agency forms a **steady
onto-theological stance**, it risks projecting a **totalising account of
the political**. **Everything non-human** is thought of as **having
political potential** because everything can have an effect on
something]{.underline} (Bennett, 2005; Roberts, 2012; Shaw and Meehan,
2013; Dittmer, 2014). At least two problems follow from this. The first
has to do with the idea of responsibility as an aspect of political
agency. Viewing political agency as always-conjoined action across human
and non-human entities underlines that human agency is not, and has
never been, anything more than relative, partial and dependent on the
co-action of non-humans. Thus, [human agency is not only seen
as]{.underline} much **[less]{.underline}** intentional and [**capable**
of producing change]{.underline} than we are accustomed to thinking, but
[it is also **always only partially** in charge of the effects that
agency brings about]{.underline} (Coole, 2013). [Whereas
some]{.underline} scholars [have viewed the distribution of
responsibility as carrying an emancipatory potential in that it allows
humanity to **withdraw from the illusion of mastery** over non-human
world]{.underline} (e.g. Lorimer, 2012; Whatmore, 2013), [others have
expressed worries about the consequences]{.underline} of the idea of
distributed responsibility among non-hierarchically organised entities
[for our **possibility of thinking meaningfully** about **politics** and
**power relations**]{.underline}. For example, Krause (2011: 300) warns
about difficulties in sustaining any "attributions of personal
responsibility" that she considers key in democratic citizenship. In a
similar vein, Chandler (2013: 525) notes that [in distributing agency
across assemblages new materialist ontologies **deprive us** of the
possibility to "**constitute our own ends**" and thus leave us with
"merely a world of]{.underline} ~~blind~~ [**\[unthinking\]
necessity**".]{.underline} Schmidt (2013: 184) goes as far as to state
that [this leads new materialist ontologies to leave us merely with the
possibility of adaptation, thus "making it **impossible** for humans to
**impose meaning** and **structure** onto this contingency]{.underline}"
(Schmidt, 2013: 191; see also Braun, 2014; Cudworth and Hobden, 2015).
To wit, we are not suggesting that the moves beyond human-centric
thought are unfounded. The point for us is rather that [the]{.underline}
onto-theological [exclusion of human-centrism **precludes from 'the
political'** issues that **in themselves** are (or happen as)
**human-centred**. This]{.underline}, we argue, [not only **dismisses
urgent matters** that are (or may become) politicised but also
paradoxically does its own politics on the level of an **ontological
lock-in**.]{.underline}

The second problem has to do with the notion of the political itself.
[If all the effects that an entity or object has upon another have a
certain 'politics']{.underline} -- as many arguing for distributed
agency would have it -- then [it becomes **difficult** to maintain which
human or non-human acts, events or processes are **not
political**]{.underline} in a given situation. This has the consequence,
as Latour (2007) himself puts it, that ["\[s\]ince by now 'everything is
political', the adjective 'political' suffers the same fate as the
adjective 'social': In being extending everywhere, they have both become
**meaningless**]{.underline}" (Latour, 2007: 812). [There is an
important difference to be made between the idea that 'anything can be
politicised' and 'everything is political']{.underline} (Dean, 2000;
Kallio and Häkli, 2011, 2015). While the former rests on the idea of not
fixing the political in advance, [the latter **dissolves the idea of
politics** by equating it with **any** and **all change**]{.underline}.
Consider the ways in which scholars have recently redressed the idea of
politics. For Roberts (2012: 2514), politics begins "with the material
participation of nonhuman forces in the world's becoming other", while
for Latta (2014: 329) "eventful transgressions or insurgencies of
marginalized thing-ness \[... mark\] moments of political becoming". The
political is also revealed "as a space of questioning to include
situations that 'force thought' or affect" (Donaldson et al., 2013: 605)
and is refigured "as an eventful technogenesis" where "politics
amplifies the matters that come to matter politically" (Whatmore, 2013:
47). As inspiring as [these formulations]{.underline} may be, they do
[**skirt the issue of politicisation** in favour of assuming that change
is **political in itself**. Their reliance on]{.underline} the
'onto-theology of [flow']{.underline}, we argue, [not only risks
**rendering the idea of the political meaningless** but also **thwarts
their capacity** to resonate with **broader political
realities**]{.underline} (see also Cresswell, 2006; McNay, 2014). In
their "desire to transcend the present and leave it far behind", as
Castree points out (2006: 169), [such approaches easily end up **too
self-contained** to be applicable to **actually existing issues** or
**events**, which are simply **indifferent** to]{.underline} researchers
"[desires]{.underline}" and onto-theological views. At worst, [the
"political celebration of the always-already becoming
virtual]{.underline}" (Joronen, 2013: 628) [may turn into an
ontologically grounded political agenda that forms in **complete
isolation from this-worldly concerns**]{.underline}.

The ontological turn as a political pedagogy

What is arguably the most concrete, even if often implicit, encounter
between the ontological turn and the political is the manner in which
the turn in itself proposes and demands specific political processes and
actions to unfold so as to become influential in mobilising change.
Coole (2013: 452), among those who explicitly recognise the political
momentum of vitalist ontology, envisions no less than a
"politicalethical intervention within the material unfolding of the 21st
century", which will be animated by "a transformation of conduct towards
matter" (Coole, 2013: 461). This facet of the ontological turn contains
a promise for political change that involves a fundamental turning away
from "the philosophical legacy of the Enlightenment" and more precisely
from "a humanism that finds ever new ways of positing the nonhuman 'out
there' rather than 'in here'" (Whatmore, 2013: 34, 47). Put differently,
what is needed is a move beyond "an unapologetically anthropocentric"
conception of politics and citizenship that is "engendered within a
political space occupied exclusively by human subjects" (Latta, 2014:
324).

[This]{.underline} is a more radical [form of politics]{.underline} than
at first [may seem]{.underline} as [it requires a profound change in how
humans]{.underline} in the global North, South, East and West [conceive
of being]{.underline} in a way that does not consider agency as "human
or as synonymous with (self-)consciousness, cognition or rationality"
and that does not "privilege some kinds of entity or agency over
others". Instead, it conceives of change in terms of assemblages and
hybrids that are "constantly emerging and dissipating across a
normatively and ontologically horizontal plane" (Coole, 2013: 453-454).
This understanding would free us from ideas of exclusive human agency
that constitutes "the rest of the world as if it were a set of mere
objects" (Connolly, 2011: 31). Instead it shows our place as
co-habitants in a thoroughly interdependent, emergent and
socio-materially assembled world where humans may learn to "minimize
forms of oppression with the other forms of life on the planet"
(Cudworth and Hobden, 2015: 146).

Yet, with all of their emancipatory promise, [these political projects
seem to employ a basic ontotheological argumentation]{.underline}. This
is evident in Connolly's (2011) discussion on the rewards of embracing a
vitalist conception of reality as 'becoming', where he portrays the
political transformation as a "work to 'become who you are,' so that the
word 'become' now modifies 'are' more than the other way around"
(Connolly, 2011: 114). [It is precisely the onto-theological requisite
for a new notion of the human being that **creates a lock-in** whereby
the politics it proposes is not achievable without
**extensive**]{.underline} and deep-going pedagogic
**[transformation]{.underline}**. According to Connolly, "the formation
of new maxims, judgments, concepts, and strategies" depends on the
cultivation of the human capacity to "dwell in the world as a seer" and
to amplify "the feeling of attachment to the most fundamental character
of existence as such, as you yourself confess those terms in a theistic
or nontheistic vein" (Connolly, 2011: 165). Hence, humans everywhere may
become who they are but only by apprehending reality as it really is --
what Schmidt (2013: 181) calls "bare reality". Expanded on the level of
all humanity, [this would entail an **enormous political development**
comparable to, and even **exceeding** in magnitude and importance, the
**rise of socialist thought** as a global force]{.underline} during the
nineteenth and twentieth centuries.

[Even if we accept that the politics]{.underline} of vitalist
onto-theology [is a **legitimate utopian vision**]{.underline} -- a view
that some non-Westerners may disagree with -- [the conditions for its
realisation appear to be **controversial**]{.underline}. As Chandler
(2013: 525) notes, [when the world is seen in terms of becoming, and
when the subject lacks coherence due to "forever
negotiating]{.underline}, experimenting and reflecting upon [its
imbrication within]{.underline} complex, fluid and overlapping
[networks]{.underline} and assemblages", [there is **little room** for
politics that **sets its own ends**]{.underline}. Yet, a growing
vitalist literature seems to suggest that a profound work on the self is
"the only route to changing the world" (Chandler, 2013: 532). Connolly
(2011: 26) sets this political project as one of acting "to cultivate
new sensitivities to human and nonhuman agents of multiple sorts" by
commending "work upon the self and the culture to which you belong".
Bennett (2010: 122) echoes this sentiment in stating that to discharge
"fantasies of human mastery" we need to "reshape the self and its
interests". Coole (2013: 461), too, argues for the "importance of
cultivating agency" and notes that to succeed the political project
ultimately depends on humans who are to be held accountable for damage
to vulnerable ecosystems and "must be accorded some privileged role" in
tackling these problems.

Hence, [while the political promise]{.underline} of these
onto-theologies [tends to be sketched on an **abstract level** in terms
of "bio-/eco-centric environmentalism]{.underline}" (Coole, 2013: 461)
[or "building alliances with \[...\] nonhuman nature"]{.underline}
(Latta, 2014: 336), [the **more practical advice**]{.underline} its
protagonists offer [is to a great extent]{.underline}, if not a little
paradoxically, [**reliant on human subjects'** sensibilities, learning
and work on the self]{.underline}. [It is]{.underline} perhaps [due to
this]{.underline} posthumanist [paradox that]{.underline} also
[the]{.underline} dimension of antagonism and/or the [understanding of
power structures]{.underline} (of which the notion of 'self-government'
is surely a sign of) [are **strikingly missing** from the political
repertoire of vitalist thought]{.underline} (McNay, 2014). [In a
subject-less world of becoming]{.underline}, object relations and
emergent causality, [with the political resting largely on the hope of a
more cultivated humanity living in harmony with the non-human world, the
idea of **clashing interests**, **intentions** or **powers** seems to
have **little role to play**]{.underline} (cf. Beisel, 2010).

#### The intent of the user and developer is what dictates how non-human actors behave relative to humans

**Introna 13** (Lucas, Department of Organisation, Work and Technology,
Lancaster University, Lancaster, UK, "Towards a Post-human
Intra-actional Account of Sociomaterial Agency (and Morality),"
Philosophy of Enginerring and Technology, volume 17, 31-53, SR)

It seems clear that it [is not feasible]{.underline}, given all the work
that emerged from the STS tradition, and the philosophy of technology[,
to maintain a]{.underline} simple [dualistic view of agency which claims
that agency is located either in the human or in the
artefact.]{.underline} It would be reasonable to say that there is a
generally accepted view that agency is more distributed than such a
dualistic view would suggest. Nevertheless[, although there is this
understanding that agency is more distributed, there is a group of
scholars that believe it is important to locate]{.underline} (or believe
we ought to locate) [the original]{.underline} and most fundamental
[source of agency on the side of the huma]{.underline}n. In this regard
I want to refer to two examples: a recent paper by Johnson (2006) on the
moral agency of computers systems and the work on value sensitive design
by Friedman et al. (2006) and Friedman and Nissenbaum (1996). In her
paper Johnson (2006) argues that [computers are moral entities but not
moral agents.]{.underline} Her argument is based on the notion that
[computers do not fulfil the basic criteria for moral agency as
traditionally conceived]{.underline}, by for example Kant. In particular
she suggests that [the key to moral agency is the 'intending act'
"because the intending to act arises from the agent's freedom. Action is
an exercise of freedom and freedom is what makes morality
possible"]{.underline} (199). She continues to argue that although
[computers do not exhibit 'intending acts'---which would make them moral
agents---it does not follow that they do not embody
intentionality]{.underline}. According to her computer systems have
intentionality in that they embody the intentionality 'inserted' into
them [by the intentional acts of designers]{.underline}. She suggests
that [designers design systems to be poised to behave in certain
ways.]{.underline} However, as she suggests, this is not the only
intentionality at work. [There is also the intentionality of the
user]{.underline}. Thus, she concludes: "[when computer systems behave,
there is a triad of intention- ality at work, the intentionality of the
computer system designer, the intentionality of the system, and the
intentionality of the user"]{.underline} (202) She proposes that [all
three of these intentionalities interact to shape the moral terrain that
should become the focus of moral evaluation]{.underline}. Thus,
according to her argument [it would be a mistake--- and misleading---to
allocate moral agency to computers independently of human
agency.]{.underline} Nevertheless, she proposes that [it is ultimately
human agency that should be the core focus of moral scrutiny: "when
attention is focused on computer systems as human-made, the design of
computer systems is more likely to come into the sights of moral
scrutiny, and, most importantly, better designs are more likely to be
created, designs that constitute a better world"]{.underline} (204, my
emphasis). This is exactly what the value sensitive design (VSD)
approach advocates. [Value sensitive design]{.underline} (Friedman et
al. 2006; Flanagan et al. 2008) [accepts the idea that technology
embodies certain intentionality]{.underline} as proposed by Johnson.
They claim that [a particular design renders possible certain
behaviours]{.underline} (in support of certain values) and not others.
Proponents argue that the moral problem is that most designers
work---often uncritically---with a limited set of values that repre-
sents the interests and values of a privileged subset of
stakeholders---such as econ- omy, efficiency, safety, and so forth. They
argue it is possible to design technologies that embody and render
possible a wider, more inclusive, set of behaviours and values. Like
Johnson [they accept an inter-actional human-centred view which suggests
that: "values are viewed neither as inscribed into
technology]{.underline} (an endog- enous theory), [nor]{.underline} as
simply [transmitted by social forces]{.underline} (an exogenous theory).
Rather, [the inter-actional position holds that while the features or
properties that people design into technologies more readily support
certain values and hinder others, the technology's actual use depends on
the goals of the people interacting with it"]{.underline} (Friedman et
al. 2006, p. 361).

#### Their ethical openness actively sanctifies violence

**Emden, 17**---Professor of German Intellectual History and Political
Thought at Rice University (Christian, "Normativity Matters:
Philosophical Naturalism and Political Theory," *The New Politics of
Materialism: History, Philosophy, Science*, Chapter 12, google books, no
page numbers, dml)

[Braidotti's account highlights the **political pitfalls** of a
posthumanist ethics that **pays little heed** to the problem of
**normativity** and **even less attention** to questions of
**justiﬁcation**. The ethical stance adopted by a **broad range** of
posthumanist interventions]{.underline}---from new materialism to the
farthest reaches of speculative realism, or object-oriented
ontology---[is either **unsurprising** or **banal**: human
exceptionalism is **overrated**, **indeed**, and the arbitrary
exploitation of both human and nonhuman animals is **questionable on
several fronts**]{.underline}.22 [**Few will disagree** with such
claims, but relegating the question of normativity **into the
background** also leads to a conception of ethics, and politics, that is
**devoid of any real normative import**.]{.underline} On such an
account, [something simply becomes ethical **as soon as it becomes a
subject of concern**, and while our environment]{.underline}---from
genes to entire habitats---[certainly can be an ethical concern, **not
everything** that can become a concern raises questions of an ethical
nature]{.underline}.23 [While it is certainly the case that our ethical
responsibilities---as far as we can still speak of the latter in
consequentialist terms as real responsibilities---**cannot seriously be
limited** to other human animals, it is **not entirely unproblematic**
to **reduce the question of ethics** to the **simple experience of an
encounter** with others, human and nonhuman alike, that highlights to us
**nothing more** than the "subtle involvements and relations between
more-than-just-human beings]{.underline}" (Smith 2011, xviii). [If
ethics is really supposed to consist in an activist and creative
interaction with others that **precludes moral judgment**, it does
become **devoid of any normative relevance** and tends toward a
**romanticizing aestheticization of the other**]{.underline}.24 [Such a
romanticizing stance particularly comes to the fore when posthumanism
**takes on environmentalist concerns**]{.underline} but replaces, for
instance, arguments about marine pollution with a poetic description of
deep-sea life whose main contention is that, somehow, we are all of
oceanic origins.25 [**Real** and **justiﬁed concerns** about **global
warming** are another prominent example for such an ethical stance, but
if the posthumanist thesis]{.underline} of a ﬂat monist ontology [**does
indeed hold water**, there is **no reason** to assume that global
warming is not **simply part of the system**, as it were]{.underline}.26

From a political perspective, [ﬂat monist ontologies lead to a
**diffusion of responsibility** which ultimately **turns against** those
posthumanist interventions that, in the name of emancipation, seek to
hold a modern, humanist subjectivity responsible for **gender
inequality**, **factory livestock farming**, **global warming**, and the
**ills of neoliberal capitalism**]{.underline}.27 In the end, it might
even be the case, as Bennett (2015) suggested most recently, that new
materialism would have "to forego the category of the political as such"
(84). Although this might be pressing the point too far, [it **might not
be possible anymore** to **differentiate** between]{.underline}, say,
[the **production of udon noodles** and **presidential elections**, and
if that should really be the case, then the demands of posthumanism and
new materialism might neither be **ethically**, nor **politicially**,
**relevant**]{.underline}.

While the consequences of posthumanism's and new materialism's ethical
stance thus appear questionable by their own standards, [what is at
stake is **not simply a lack of theoretical coherence**]{.underline}.
Rather, [in the background of political pitfalls and ethical vagueness
stands a **more serious philosophical problem**]{.underline}, that of
the naturalistic fallacy. For any posthumanist or new materialist
ethics, [the naturalistic fallacy proves **fatal**]{.underline}. This
problem becomes particularly obvious in a central claim---summarized in
exemplary fashion by Karen Barad---that shapes [the ethical and
political outlook of posthumanism and new materialism at
large]{.underline}. Relating the agency of matter directly to the
question of ethics, Barad draws on Emmanuel Levinas' understanding of
ethics as a ﬁrst philosophy grounded in the immediate phenomenological
experience of encountering "the other." The other, Levinas (1969)
[argues]{.underline}, is revealed in its "alterity" to the "I" and thus
creates an "irreducible relationship" that is centered on our immediate
response to the other, which he understands as the basis of ethical
responsibility (150 and 7980). While Levinas is far from being a
materialist philosopher, he does suggest that [our relationship to the
"material world" can]{.underline}, in principle, [repeat the structural
logic of "I" and "the other]{.underline}": "The primordial relation of
man with the material world is not negativity, but enjoyment and
agreeableness of life," and it is this move that allows Barad (1996) to
translate Levinas' theologically oriented assumptions into her account
of an "ethics of mattering"(Levinas 1969, 49; and Barad 1996, 391---96).
Ethics emerges in the agential dynamics inherent in matter, which
includes the human subject as constituted by its material agency. [As a
consequence, "the human subject is not the locus of ethicality," but
ethical relationships are **always part of the agency of matter**.
Ethics]{.underline}, then, [is **not really concerned with norms** but
rather with the "**relationalities of becoming** of which we are a
part"]{.underline} (Barad 1996, 393). While it might certainly be
possible to describe the emergence of normativity along these lines,
[Barad goes much further, concluding that **all material agency** is
**essentially of an ethical kind**, since "\[m\]atter itself is **always
already open to**, or rather **entangled with**, the
'**Other**"']{.underline} (393). Since all material agency is
reciprocal, in one way or another, it does "respond" to other kinds of
agency, and since agency thus entails "the ability to respond to the
other," Barad deﬁnes "responsibility" in terms of responsiveness (392).

Short-circuiting Levinas' theological ethics of the other with the
monist ontology of new materialism ultimately gives rise to metaphysical
claims that withdraw from justiﬁcation: "A delicate tissue of ethicality
runs through the marrow of being. There is no getting away from
ethics---mattering is an integral part of the ontology of the world in
its dynamic presencing" (Barad 1996, 396). Of course, [if **everything
is somehow ethical** as long as it is concerned with material agency,
then **any ethical claim** could potentially be accepted: **human
cruelty** might just be an **agential manifestation** "intrinsic to the
world's vitality," and the **agents of cruelty** might very well merely
be "**responsive to the possibilities that might help \[them\]
ﬂourish**," since they are, after all, "alive to the possibilities of
becoming"]{.underline} (396).

#### Their disregard of ethical consequences ensures their politics devolves into crude social Darwinism

**Emden, 17**---Professor of German Intellectual History and Political
Thought at Rice University (Christian, "Normativity Matters:

Materialism: History, Philosophy, Science*, Chapter 12, google books, no

Regardless of the dynamics with which the validity of norms needs to be
justiﬁed for different contexts of ahistorically contingent lifeworlds,
[ethics and morality are **detached** from our existence as **natural
beings**. This is particularly the case as soon as we **distinguish
ethics** as dealing with **concrete** and **particular problems** from
the **more general** and **formal principles** that are seen to govern
the normative order of morality]{.underline}, as Rainer Forst (2012)
points out.36 Morality, on this view, consists of "a system of
categorically binding norms, and corresponding rights and duties, which
hold reciprocally and universally among human beings qua human beings in
their capacity as moral persons, and which do not presuppose any thicker
context of interpersonal or communal relations (such as family, friends,
political community, and so on)" (Forst 2012, 43).

There are, of course, speciﬁc and understandable reasons why political
philosophy has refrained from extending its conception of normativity to
include nonhuman factors and agents. Deriving the structure of
normativity as categorically and universally binding among human
individuals from any natural facts about these individuals would fall
into the trap of the naturalistic fallacy. Moreover, [**reducing
normative action** to **natural agency** can give rise to a **crude
social Darwinism** that]{.underline}, from the vantage point of critical
theory, [has done **considerable damage** to the **emancipatory claims**
of political philosophy and that]{.underline}, from a historical
perspective, [has **undermined democratic pluralism**, as in the case of
a **biologically grounded racism**]{.underline}. Most importantly,
however, [extending normativity beyond the human world **undercuts** the
**presumed practical autonomy of reason** that allows for the **rational
justification** of **ethical** and **political claims** about the world
in which we have to live]{.underline}.

#### Actor Network Theory relies on a dangerous line of questioning that causes detachment from ourselves and the surrounding world

Actant-Network Theory\" // NCMD

Do cubes, bricks, slabs, beams, columns and bottles of beer act? Do they
co-ordinate their actions through a common definition of the situation?
Are they kept together or driven apart from each other through
agreements and disagreements? Obviously not. [Bottles, beams and slabs
do not act. Only humans (and animals) act; not endowed with
intentionality, artefacts do not act]{.underline}. Going 'back to the
things themselves' ('zu den Sachen selbst') in order to analyse how
bottles of beer, beams, blossoming cherry-trees and builders give
themselves to consciousness and are intentionally constituted as givens
of consciousness, we can see that [humans and non humans are essentially
different]{.underline}, or, to say the same in old-fashioned
phenomenological language, that [they belong to different 'regional
ontologies']{.underline} (Husserl, 1952: I, 7--23; III, 21--53).
Whatever a human or a non human is, and however they are perceived,
their essence (eidos), which predetermines what they necessarily must be
when they are to be things of a certain kind, can be a priori determined
through the procedure of 'eidetic variation'[. By a process of
imaginative variation, we can arrive at a categorical determination of
what makes a human a human and a non human]{.underline}. We start, as an
equipmental whole within easy reach and fit for the cold spread. [They
are not encountered as 'mere things', as unconnected, decontextualized,
self-contained objects, occurrent as analysable and decomposable
spatio-temporal entities, but as a series of useful objects available
for the cold spread.]{.underline} [The equipment does not only refer to
other equipment, but also indirectly to the materials it is made up of
and to the people who have furnished the materials, assembled the
equipment and made it available for use. The bottle]{.underline} of beer
[refers]{.underline} to the sand, the fire, the glass, the malt and the
water, but also [to the network of people who have assembled the
materials to make the bottle]{.underline} and the beer,
[and]{.underline} ultimately to [its potential users]{.underline} as
well. Thus along with the work, we encounter not only entities
ready-to-hand but also entities with Dasein's kind of Being -- entities
for which, in their concern, the product becomes ready-to-hand; and
together with these we encounter the world in which wearers and users
live, which is at the same time ours (Heidegger, 1927: 71[). Humans and
non humans are thus interconnected in a materialized 'technogram', but
Dasein's way of Being, which is, of course, the way of Being of humans,
is essentially different from the way of Being of non
humans]{.underline}. B[eing human is being-with-others, whereas non
humans are indifferent not only to humans, but also to non humans and to
themselves. When we encounter in our everyday life humans and non
humans, we do not encounter them as 'mere things']{.underline},
present-at-hand, occurring in the world as knowable entities or
enrollable allies, [but as entities that are part of our world and that
are available for our concerns]{.underline}. [We treat them with or
without care and approach them within the 'regime of
familiarity']{.underline} (Thévenot, 1994a). It is [only when something
goes wrong]{.underline} and objects become conspicuous in their
obtrusiveness that [we become conscious of them and of our selves**. It
is then that we surrender the 'natural attitude' and start theorizing,
and by theorizing in the 'naturalist attitude' we succumb to the
'scholastic tendency' to interpret all ways of Being, human and non
human, as modes of occurrentness.** This way of theorizing which
objectifies humans and non humans alike by decontextualizing them does,
however, not lead to knowledge of our Being-in-the-world but away from
it. **By giving up the attempt to understand the world 'from within' and
to interpret it as a world we always already understood, a 'deficient
mode' of understanding is enthroned as knowledge and eventually we end
up with the decontextualized knowledge of a 'worldless world' we can no
longer understand as our world, the world we always already understood
even without knowing it.**]{.underline}

Bottles of beer, slabs, bricks, hammers and blossoming cherry trees as
well -- depending on the discursive regime in which they figure, those
[non humans take on meaning]{.underline}, or lose it, [as intentional
objects of consciousness]{.underline}, as equipment ready-to-hand or as
things present-at-hand. In all cases, the root of the trail leads
eventually back to humans. [However humans are interconnected with non
humans]{.underline}, at the end of the day, [it is humans who encounter
non humans and endow them with meaning]{.underline}, use or value. Non
humans have meaning for humans, either proximally because they encounter
them in their life-world and apprehend them within a multiplicity of
axiological regimes of justification -- from the domestic and the civic
to the mercantile and the industrial one (Thévenot, 1994b) -- or,
ultimately, because they have made them. [Artefacts]{.underline}, such
as machines and other technosocial objects, [are objectified and
materialized spirit]{.underline}. [They can be understood by means of a
reconstruction of the meaning which humans intentionally gave to them
when they were manufacturing, using or consuming them]{.underline}
(Weber, 1972: 3). Verum et factum convertuntur -- because we have made
the facts, we can understand them; fact and fiction thus go together, at
least for those of us who are modern. The others have to bring back the
Gods to understand what we have not made. [Humans do not just encounter
non humans; they also encounter each other]{.underline}, either
directly, through communications of all sorts, or, indirectly, by
inserting non humans between themselves as gifts or as commodities. [By
introducing]{.underline} gifts and [commodities, we bring in social
relations between things and move from]{.underline} the lofty heights of
[philosophical anthropology to]{.underline} the exotic planes of social
and [economic anthropology]{.underline}. In the anthropological analysis
of the exchange of wealth, gifts and commodities are traditionally seen
as rival concepts and mirror images (Gregory, 1982). [In the moral
economy of the gift]{.underline}, which allegedly is dominant in archaic
societies, [it is the qualitative relations between humans that
matter]{.underline}. [Non humans only intervene to start or to renew the
cycle of reciprocity between humans. Humans are interdependent and their
reciprocal interdependency is maintained through the exchange of
inalienable symbolic objects.]{.underline} After the transaction, the
receivers are not the owners of the object. [They own the incorporeal
rights, not the object itself, which remains the inalienable possession
of the humans that make up the network of interdependency.]{.underline}
In the gift economy [property is thus not a thing but 'a network of
social relations that governs the conduct of people with respect to the
use and disposition of things']{.underline} (Hoebel, cit. Hann, 1998:
4). In the political economy of the commodity, on the other hand, which
allegedly has supplanted the moral economy of the gift, [objects are
alienable]{.underline}. They are not personalized but objectified and
reified into property, which is considered as a thing.
[After]{.underline} the [transaction]{.underline}, the [objects
lose]{.underline} every [connection with the transacting
subjects]{.underline}. [In commodity exchange,]{.underline} humans are
independent from and unrelated to each other. They don't really matter.
[Only the exchange-value matters]{.underline}, and it is understood as a
quantitative relation between non humans. The distinction between the
economy of the gift and the economy of the commodity is a systemic one,
referring to the objective conditions that make the alienation of goods
possible. Although one cannot decide on inspection whether a particular
transaction involves alienation or not, one can still [analyse the
economic system]{.underline} as a whole in which it occurs [and
determine whether the tendency to personalize non humans]{.underline},
which characterizes gift economies, [predominates over the
objectification of humans]{.underline}, which characterizes the
commodity economy, or whether it is the other way around (Simmel, 1992:
661--3). [If the cultural limits to universal commodification are almost
non existent]{.underline}, that is [if everything]{.underline},
including mothers and organs, [can be objectified]{.underline},
alienated and exchanged on the abstract market against money, [then we
are confronted with a commodity economy]{.underline}. The systemic
distinction between the two economic systems is analytic. As such, it
does no more exclude that commodities circulate in gift economies than
that gifts occur in commodity systems. It is even perfectly compatible
with Parry's observation that it is only under conditions of a
relatively free market that there's evidence for the entirely
disinterested gift (Parry, 1986). But it resists the post-modernist
temptation to undermine and deconstruct all conceptual distinctions.
Thomas is right when he states that one cannot presume that 'gifts are
invariably gifts and commodities are invariably commodities' (Thomas,
1991: 39), but he's wrong when in his attempt to dissolve the general
categories of the gift and the commodity by means of a
recontextualization of particular objects, he seems to be willing to
give up the distinction between commodity and gift economies altogether.
Like slaves, [objects can]{.underline} indeed [move in and out of the
commodity economy]{.underline} (Appadurai, 1986; Kopytoff, 1986), but
even if commodities are given and gifts exchanged, the commodity economy
remains a commodity economy and the gift economy a gift economy.
Depending on how [objects]{.underline} are appropriated when they leave
the generalized system of equivalence and exchange, they [can be
repersonalized through consumption]{.underline} (Miller, 1987: 189--96)
and sacrifice (Bataille, 1967: 93--7) or stamped as gifts with a
symbolic meaning and value (Mauss, 1950), which removes them in effect
from ordinary social exchange. Through this personalization, the object
becomes an 'inalienable possession', appropriated and authenticated as
different and non-exchangeable against an equivalent. 'Ownership of
these possessions makes the authentification of difference rather than
the balance of equivalence the fundamental feature of exchange' (Weiner,
1992: 40). In the exchange economy, the stress is always put on the
receiving end of the transaction, which establishes the equivalence
between the exchanged items and closes off the cycle of reciprocity,
rarely or never on the giving end, which gets the cycle going and
establishes a personal relationship of indebtedness between the
transactors. The moral economy of the gift does not cancel out debt but
thrives on it. The more you owe to the other, the more you're bound to
the other, because through the gift you incur a personal commitment to
the other who has given to you in the same way as the other is bound to
you through the gift you are supposed to return. **[The relations
between humans are thus mediated by non humans, but those non humans
only matter because they renew and perpetuate the cycle of reciprocity
between subjects.]{.underline}** In this sense, the gift represents and
realizes a relational or 'bond value' (Godbout and Caillé, 1992: 244).
With the gift, the primacy of the relations between non humans thus
becomes secondary and the primacy of relations between humans is
restored. Paraphrasing Marx's characterization of the commodity fetish,
we could say that [the relation between people no longer appears as a
relation between things, but that the relation between things now
appears as a relation between people]{.underline}. And indeed, if we may
believe Marcel Mauss, who acts here as the spokesperson of the Maori
elder Ranaipiri, [the gift economy is so thoroughly social that the non
humans that mediate between humans are somehow considered as human and
that the relation which is established by non humans is in fact
conceived as a relation between the souls of the givers]{.underline}:
'That what in the gift obliges is that the thing given is not inert.
Even when it is abandoned by the giver, it is still something which
belongs to him. . . . In Maori custom, this bond created by things is a
bond between souls, because the thing itself has a soul, is a soul'
(Mauss, 1950: 159--60). But if the thing has a soul, and if the soul is
what connects the body with the supernatural, then the thing also has a
cosmological or theological now becomes the spokesperson and messenger
of the Gods, the things are given and returned because they are animated
by the 'spirit of the gift', which transforms the object into a symbol
and explains why the communication between humans through non humans is
also a communion with the supernatural and thus, at least if we may
believe Durkheim, with themselves. In this sense, [gifts are symbols of
the social bond which by symbolizing the alliance between humans through
spiritualized non humans also perform the social bond]{.underline}. Once
more, we see that [humans are not so much kept together by the
commutation of non humans as by the communication through
symbols]{.underline}, symbols that are freely given and returned and
allow the humans to commune with themselves. Transforming non humans
into humans, endowing them with 'imaginary signification' (Castoriadis),
symbolic discourses both represent and perform the social bond as a
collective of humans who, thanks to the communication with the spirits,
commune with themselves via the giving and counter-giving of non humans.
In so far as the concrete practices of giving and countergiving are
mediated by a 'transcendental structure' of meaningful symbols, the
'mode of regulation and reproduction of society' is fundamentally of a
cultural nature: the social synthesis is effectuated by means of a
'double dialectic' whereby culture a priori structures the practices
that reproduce culture and integrate society (Freitag, 1986: II,
77--167). [If objects are shifted back from the gift economy, where they
are so thoroughly personalized and spiritualized that the relation
between non humans appears as a relation between humans, into the
commodity economy, the objects become so thoroughly objectified and
secularized, disconnected from their producers who are themselves
disenchanted and disconnected from their social relations, that the
relations between humans now appear as relations between non
humans]{.underline}. 'It is nothing but the definite social relation
between men themselves which assumes here, for them, the fantastic form
of a relation between things' (Marx, 1976: 165). This fantastic
inversion of humans and non humans is not simply an illusion, however,
but in so far as it expresses in ideological form the real nature of
social relations in a competitive market environment, it literally has
its fundamentum in rebus. In capitalist societies which are dominated by
a market economy, the economy is no longer embedded in society, but
apart from the gift economy, which survives, of course, not only in the
informal economy, but also more generally in the circles of primary
sociability of the life-world (Vandenberghe, 2002), society is embedded
in the economy. Market societies are not only societies which are based
on the economy but also societies where, as a result of the destruction
of the traditional forms of life by the planned imposition of the market
by the state on the life-world, the economy is based on self-interest
(Polanyi, 1944: 249). Self-interest presupposes 'possessive
individualism', which is really an ideological form of and justification
for 'atomistic individualism' which recentres society around the
individual and his or her property, which is now conceived as a thing
and no longer as a bundle of social relations. In the individualist
ideology, the individual is valued above society, and society is
conceived as an emergent but unintended effect of the anarchistic and
strategic pursuit of self-interests by each of the enterprising
individuals. Living in a disenchanted world, individuals are no longer
'oversocialized'; they are now atomized and 'overindividualized'.
Independent from each other, they carefully planify their own lives in
function of their self-interest and self-conservation and at the end of
the day their interests are moderated and their plans co-ordinated by
the market through the exchange of commodities and services. Their
actions and activities are not consciously and willingly co-ordinated
through communication, but a posteriori through the 'invisible hand' of
the market[. Relations of personal dependence between humans are thus
replaced by material relations between non humans and the social
integration of humans is imposed from without by the systemic
interconnection of non humans. This shift from a social-cultural to a
systemic-operational 'mode of regulation and reproduction of
society]{.underline}' (Freitag, 1986: I, 55--66), [which corresponds to
a shift from an economy of the gift to a commodity economy, explains the
fetishist inversion of the relations between humans and non humans: 'The
social relations between their private labours appears as what they are,
i.e. they do not appear as direct relations between persons but rather
as material relations between persons and social relations between
things']{.underline} (Marx, 1976: 166).

### 1NC Connolly

**Even if analyzing the formation of assemblages is good, they fail to
[mobilize]{.underline} the assemblage of [debate]{.underline}---it can
be a [valuable site]{.underline} to develop and enact rhetorical skills
that promote a pluralist assemblage mobilized by class consciousness and
evidence-based refutation---the impact is extinction from war and
environmental destruction**

**Connolly, 17**---Krieger-Eisenhower Professor of Political Science at
Johns Hopkins University, Joe's real dad (William, *Aspirational
Fascism: The Struggle for Multifaceted Democracy under Trumpism* pg
694-777, kindle, dml)

[Such changes]{.underline} are valuable in themselves. They also
[promote **intraclass connections** across multiple minorities who would
all benefit from them. **Single mothers**, **working-class African
Americans**, **same-sex couples** in the working class, and
**lower-income minorities of all sorts** who hold underwater mortgages
and face retirement squeezes would **benefit together** from such
**general policies**, **setting the stage** for formation of **more
positive connections**. When pluralism is joined **much more obdurately
to class egalitarianism**, it becomes both **more noble** and **more
resilient**]{.underline}--- [particularly when a large corps of
pluralist leaders in different positions **develop** and enact
rhetorical skills bolstering the horizontal pulls of democratic
life]{.underline}.

Would such changes ease the way for more working-class whites to accept
the new position of America in the world, as they also overcome evasions
of institutional racism and the galloping pressures of climate change? I
do not know. I do know that many in these situations already resist such
temptations, and I suspect that [these new initiatives could **increase
the odds** that such messages would be **absorbed by a larger portion**.
It can also be hoped that more of those outside this class who are
repelled by the strains of ugliness within this constituency will come
to **discern more closely** the grievances that foster temptations to
that ugliness]{.underline}. It is a shaky time.\[ 10\]

[The ugliness finding ample expression today in sections of the white
working class must no longer be deployed as a reason to **ignore its
actual grievances**. The idea is to **call out expressions** of
**racism**, **militarism**, **climate denialism**, and **misogyny** when
you encounter them as you **simultaneously demand positive responses**
to legitimate working-class grievances. Show how **reasonable
solutions** to them are **compatible** with a **pluralizing**,
**egalitarian culture**]{.underline}. [The task is to **define the
pluralizing Left anew** as an ally of the white working and lower middle
classes as it **simultaneously retains strong support** for the rights
and needs of other constituencies who are often **suffering even more**.
The pluralizing Left]{.underline}, indeed, [simmers with such
potentiality]{.underline}.

Hopefully, it has become clear to more on the democratic Left how
necessary it is to move a variety of pluralizing minorities closer to a
larger segment of the working class. For the latter class, once you take
into account relative income level, education level, type of work,
degree of job security, relative income increases over a career, and
declining retirement prospects, has itself become a minority. This
becomes even more obvious when you discern how what was once a decent
wage in the United States has now become less so as the infrastructure
of consumption has evolved to make it more expensive to make ends meet
than heretofore.\[ 11\] This is an aggrieved minority, too.

Hopefully, too, that clarity has not arrived too late to counter the
hold Trump has gained over a large swath of this class, led by those on
its evangelical, military, veteran, rural, and police edges. The Hillary
Clinton campaign, again, missed the boat in this respect, even if the
Democratic platform she was pressed to enact by Bernie supporters--- and
supposed to represent in the election--- made modest gestures in this
direction.

[If a dissident movement is to **acquire momentum**, the democratic Left
must also **identify more young leaders** in **multiple settings** who
are **charismatic in democratic ways** and who can **inspire large
constituencies** as they **counter the appeal** of Trumpian
authoritarian charisma]{.underline}. For [Trump is a charismatic
adversary whose **rhetorical effectiveness** has **not yet been measured
adequately** by enough of his critics]{.underline}. He and Hitler are
both right about one thing: [there is a tendency in the professoriate to
**downplay the role of rhetoric** in politics and the **ubiquitous
importance of the visceral register** of culture to public life. We
often **love writing more than speech**. There is]{.underline} thus [a
**corollary reticence** to working hard enough to **counter a rhetoric**
organized around **authoritarian leadership**, **militarism**,
**whiteness**, and **aggressive national assertion** with another mode
that draws]{.underline} [on our higher angels to encourage **horizontal
modes of organization** and an ethos of **presumptive generosity** as it
articulates the **differential class**, **regional**, and **urban
dangers** of **rapid climate change**.]{.underline}

[We both need to **learn more about Trump** and to **rebut his
rhetorical style** with **positive styles of engagement**]{.underline}.
Bernie Sanders shined a bright light here, too. For [visceral group
identifications **do not always** and **only pass** through the filter
of a narcissistic leader, as a few steeped in Freudianism may think.
They can also be **mediated by horizontal connections** on both the
**visceral** and **refined registers** of cultural life]{.underline}---
[connections forged across a **variety of**]{.underline} associational
meetings, church assemblies, blogs, family **[gatherings]{.underline}**,
**[classrooms]{.underline}**, neighborhood groups, school boards, tavern
**[conversations]{.underline}**, unions, [and so on]{.underline}--- [as
we **forge reciprocal ties** of **presumptive generosity** and
**care**]{.underline}.\[ 12\] [Charismatic, pluralizing, egalitarian
leaders support such horizontal connections and infusions]{.underline}
in the ways they provide Democratic leadership.\[ 13\] It is possible to
improve the internal ethos of the United States while coming to terms
more nobly with its new condition in the world, even if the
probabilities may point in another direction. Indeed, it is imperative
to try to accomplish both together, because [failure to do so risks
**unleashing the vast military power of the country** in a **series of
destructive wars** that could be **calamitous for the world**. Think
merely of how **climate change**--- a **gathering planetary force
massive in destructive power**--- is subject to denial in part because
those who seek to **return to an old "greatness"** are told that such a
return **requires the modes of industry**, **mining**, **imperial
power**, **triumphalism**, and **fossil fuel energy** that powered
growth the last time around.]{.underline}

Trump's attack upon the media and the professoriate is strategically
chosen in this respect. His tweets calling the media "the enemy of the
people" and carriers of "fake news" must never be treated lightly. Above
all, [this is **not a site**, if there is **any site**, at which the
Left should seek to "**accelerate the contradictions**" of the order to
**speed up its collapse**.\[]{.underline} 14\] [The latter route,
**however unintentionally**, is a route to **fascism**]{.underline}.

Trump's goal is to trap the media in a bind: he hopes he can win if the
media evades the charges he makes; he hopes he can win if they reply
simply by correcting the evidence when he endlessly accuses them of fake
news. [The **best strategy**]{.underline}, perhaps, [is to **keep
exposing how the Big Lie works**, to **respond with evidence-based
claims to each Lie** as you also **explain why he pursues
it**]{.underline}, to play up dramatically how critical a press free
from state control or intimidation is to a democratic society, [and to
**explore the real** and **neglected grievances** of those
constituencies most tempted to embrace Trump tweets]{.underline}. Yes,
the media often deserves intense criticism from the democratic Left for
its softness on a neoliberal corporate culture, but the Left must also
expose and attack Trumpian intimidation of it. It recently seemed unwise
to me, for instance, when a few on the Left reenforced Trump and Putin
denials of the Putin intervention in the election with statements that
came close to describing this as fake news. The media and professoriate
will both be vicious targets of Trump attacks for the next four years
(at least), as he deflects attention from his probable collusion with
Putin and the failure of his policies to uplift the working class. [It
is possible for critics on the Left to **chew gum** and **walk at the
same time**]{.underline}, in this case, [to hold the media accountable
as you also defend it against vicious Trumpian assaults that could get
worse as his false promises continue to encounter harsh
realities]{.underline}.

[I have doted a bit on the working class **not** because it could today
become the **center of a new movement** toward egalitarian democracy
oriented to both pluralism and the new planetary condition. We **do not
inhabit a Fordist era** in which much of the working class is centered
in large factories. That class is now **even more dispersed
geographically**]{.underline} and underorganized into unions. [It is
often distributed in small clusters]{.underline} in fast-food
restaurants, shopping mall stores, janitorial duties, farm work, small
factories, prison work, security assignments, subordinate administrative
duties, hospital services, and so on. Moreover, its dispersed
distribution makes it easier for those outside those circumstances to
ignore or deny its grievances, as they look merely at yearly income
statistics and fail to register how differences in lifetime income and
an evolving infrastructure of consumption make it harder for many with
apparently decent incomes to make ends meet. [Its very **dispersion**,
**disorganization**, and **uneven geodistribution**]{.underline},
however, [mean that, **intelligently engaged**, it could also **forge
indispensable elements** in a **vibrant pluralism** that has been on the
move for a while **without its active involvement**, a pluralism that
can also **constitute a key bulwark** against **aspirational
fascism**]{.underline}. That is why [it is wise to **appreciate the
working class** today as **one dispersed minority among
others**]{.underline}.

If and when we speak to the higher angels of the working class, [we
might help to **consolidate a vibrant pluralist assemblage** already in
motion organized around **several sexualities**, **diverse religious
creeds**, a few **class positions**, **ethnicities**, **urban** and
**rural locations**, and "**races**"--- all assembled in part to
**realize a better society** and in part to **defeat aspirational
fascism**.]{.underline}

There is little doubt that [such an agenda faces **deep difficulties of
achievement**]{.underline} in the United States, [especially with
respect to **speaking to the grievances of African Americans** and
**Native Americans**. But that **does not mean** that the difficult
drive to a more egalitarian pluralism should be
**scrapped**]{.underline} in favor of a drive to a more centered nation.
[The latter agenda, as **fascist perversions** of it show, is both
**more dangerous** and **filled with its own exclusionary drives**. It
means,]{.underline} rather, [that the struggle **must both be
intensified** and **rendered more creative**]{.underline}. It is
important to recall again that one hallmark of the early drives to
fascism in Europe was the replacement of real diversity with a
fraudulent plurality organized from the top down. Another was the
tendency of private finance, large corporations, and market ideologues
to endorse a fascist movement once it became powerful.\[ 15\] To them,
the prospective alternatives were worse.

[**If** and **as** an egalitarian pluralist assemblage becomes
**mobilized sufficiently** to **make impressive advances**, it might
then strive to **transfigure the existing order** into a **distinctive
kind of democratic socialism**, one that places **ecology**,
**egalitarianism**, **plurality**, and **critical responsiveness** to
new constituencies **high on the agenda**]{.underline}.

### 1NC Consequentialism

#### Refusing to assume responsibility for their \[ontological/epistemological/whatever\] starting point enables political [disaster]{.underline}---ours is an ontology of [entanglement]{.underline} that [considers unintended effects]{.underline} and [better enables political action]{.underline}

**Zanotti, 17**---Associate Professor Department of Political Science,
Virginia Tech (Laura, "Reorienting IR: Ontological Entanglement, Agency,
and Ethics," International Studies Review, January 13, 2017, dml)

In this article, I have argued that in order for IR to remain
politically relevant and critical, we must rethink and reflect on the
ontological, epistemological, and methodological assumptions of the
discipline. I then explored how [onto-epistemologies, ethics, and
political agency are **interlinked**]{.underline}. Ontologies of
entanglement tend to embrace complex conceptualizations of causality and
the morphogenetic properties of what exist. In a quantum world,
ontological cuts happen in practices. [This]{.underline} worldview
[invites a **reconsideration** of the way we **justify**]{.underline}
and address [**political decisions** and **ethical action** beyond the
**universalism** supported by atomistic ontologies and the **stifling
limits** imposed by substantialist-structuralism]{.underline}. As Nick
Onuf has argued, "In a straightened world, as [in a world in turmoil,
talk of universal principles **rings hollow**]{.underline}... [In such a
world, positional ethics is the **best we can hope for**]{.underline}"
(Onuf forthcoming, quoted with permission).

[A quantum reconceptualization of our being in the world and our
relation to matter calls for a **profound sense of modesty**, as well as
for the **central role of responsibility** for taking political
decisions. In an entangled world that is **not governed** by
**theoretically detectable**, **linear**, and **immutable laws** of
history, but instead by **intra-agential processes**, the conditions of
possibility for political agency are rooted in]{.underline} the
morphogenetic properties of **[practices]{.underline}**. Taking
responsibility for critically questioning what exists without the hubris
of assuming our ability to ordain outcomes displays an affinity with
Foucault's methodological and political project. In this vein, [ethical
guidelines **may not be grounded on abstractions** stemming from the
solitary ruminations of an individual's mind]{.underline}. [Prudence,
responsibility]{.underline}, and practices of cultivation of the self
[offer pathways to **overcome the limitations** of]{.underline} the
Kantian categorical imperative by which **[universal
prescriptions]{.underline}** are the main way of validating ethical
choices. As Patomäki has shown, [universalism may elicit
**exclusionary** and **violent practices**]{.underline}. Moreover, as
Connolly has argued, [the nostalgia for a slowly moving world regulated
by **linear relations of causality** and characterized by **certainty**
and **stability** may be the **root of fundamentalism**.]{.underline}

Furthermore, [if we accept]{.underline} Barad's position [that we are
"**of the world**" and not **above the world**, theorizing looks more
like a practice endowed with **performative political effects** than a
**quest** for the discovery of the "**true nature**" of what
exists]{.underline}. Therefore, [intellectual undertakings are a **form
of political agency** and come with **great responsibility**. Such
responsibility **requires** the need for **exercising prudence** in
making truth statements about what is **universally good** or
**naturally inevitable**. Assumptions about]{.underline} linearity of
causal relations, **[universal]{.underline}** laws of history, or
**[ontological properties]{.underline}** of entities [yield]{.underline}
two [**problematic effects**. On the one hand, they may **stifle
political imagination**; on the other hand, they could encourage actions
based upon **abstract prescriptions** rather than upon **careful
diagnosis** of the forces that obtain in the situation at hand. In an
entangled world, **there are no externalities**. Arguments that **divert
responsibility** by basing political choices upon **abstract
principles** or **aspirations** and]{.underline}, as a result, [that
treat **what happens on the ground** as "**unintended consequences**" or
"**collateral damage**," are **ethically thin** and **politically
dangerous**.]{.underline}

In fact, [**unintended consequences** may well be the result of
**irresponsible political decision-making** that does not include a
**competent assessment** of the **practical configurations** that
constitute the **context of action** and the **means necessary** to
achieve stated goals. Such attitudes]{.underline}, Amoureux and Steele
(2014) have suggested, [have led to **disastrous initiatives**, such as
the **Bush administration's invasion of Iraq**]{.underline}. Likewise,
Kennedy (2006) has shown that [the]{.underline} bland
[rhetoric]{.underline} of jus in bello that provides standardized
criteria regarding the number of acceptable civilian casualties
(conveniently called collateral damage) [produces the effect of
**diverting responsibility** from those who conduct war while
**assuaging their consciences** concerning the injuries and deaths their
choices are inflicting]{.underline}. Kennedy (2004) has also shown that
[as a result of the preference for **universal normativity**,
the]{.underline} human rights [profession]{.underline} (which he calls
"the invisible college") [is more concerned with **protecting abstract
norms** than with **acting politically** so as to **devise viable
solutions** to **specific problems**.]{.underline}

Universal norms and bureaucratic routines play a major role in
prescribing and justifying UN peacekeeping interventions. As Jean Marie
Guehénno argued more than a decade ago, strategies of international
intervention based upon assumptions of causal linearity and invariance
may amount to hubris. Norms and rules can also offer grounds for
appeasement. The massacres that occurred in Rwanda and Srebrenica in the
1990s provide examples of how, by uncritically following
institutionalized rules, United Nations peacekeepers permitted
atrocities. UN employees are not cold-blooded monsters or extremely
callous individuals. They follow norms and rules, key examples of which
include the principle of "impartiality," Security Council mandates, and
"rules of engagement." By doing so, however, they have often fallen
short of considering the possible consequences of decisions in specific
situations. The United Nations' failure to take action to prevent the
Rwanda and Srebrenica genocide testifies to the fact that following
universal norms (i.e., the imperative to preserve impartiality) and
bureaucratic reasoning (i.e., the rules of engagement prescribing not to
intervene to disarm any party of the conflict) set the stage for
avoiding a careful assessment of what was at stake on the eve of the
massacres. These ways of reasoning also appeased consciences for not
making decisions accountable to the people in danger (Zanotti 2014).

Significantly, [the **lack of prudence** that derives from **broad
overgeneralizations** and **reliance on abstractions**, **rather** than
**careful consideration** of **what the case demands**, threatens **more
self-defeating outcomes** in peacekeeping and international politics.
This is why a **careful reflection** of the ways our political choices
are **validated ontologically** and **epistemologically** is of
**paramount practical importance**]{.underline}. Seven decades ago, Carr
(1946) advocated the need for conceptualizing political agency and
ethics in a way that addresses both the limits of the idealist illusion
regarding the possibility to transform reality through acts of will as
well as the realist persuasion about the inescapable subordination of
actors to external conditions. Both of [these positions]{.underline},
Carr pointed out, [lead to **self-defeating outcomes** and **stifle
political imagination** because they **focus on general abstractions**,
**failing** to take into consideration what conditions and political
opportunity **actually obtain** in **specific historical
configurations**]{.underline}.

Here I have proposed that [an ontology of entanglement fosters an
**ethic of engagement** and **activism**]{.underline} along the lines
suggested by Foucault and opens up possibilities for political action.
In this ontological horizon, [what qualifies as meaningful agency is
**not stifled** by]{.underline} the structuralist commitment to the
stabilizing effects of structures (like in Waltz's) or by [the
**inescapable features** of an **oppressive** and **alienating social
order** that **dispossess subjects of their humanity** and **reduces
them to "bare life"**]{.underline} (as in Agamben). Instead,
[micropolitical interventions]{.underline}, parrēsia, and the
cultivation of a particular kind of character, [**while not
revolutionizing the status quo**, may be relevant to **triggering social
change**]{.underline}. Importantly, [ontologies of entanglement also
**raise the bar** for **adjudicating** the **ethical validity of
political choices**. Radical assumption of responsibility **drastically
limits what is acceptable** as "**unintended consequences**." This is
**important** for]{.underline} the way international organizations make
decisions regarding international peacekeeping interventions and for
[**the way politicians decide to wage war**. **Ethically** and
**politically sound** decision-making **cannot** be based mainly
upon]{.underline} the apodictic recognition of universal rules of
behavior, [**abstract aspirations**, or **overarching theories** of the
functioning of society. They must also include **careful analysis** of
how]{.underline} clusters of [causes may **generate effects** in the
**specific contexts** at hand and **take responsibility**
for]{.underline} the ontological cuts [our initiatives]{.underline}
operate [and for the]{.underline} morphogenetic [processes they may set
off.]{.underline}

### 1NC Expertism/Technocracy Good

#### The only way to save the planet is technological innovation guided by [nuanced political engagement]{.underline}---philosophical framings doom the planet

**Milne and Kinsella, 17**---Faculty of English, University of Cambridge
AND School of Media, Culture and Creative Arts, Faculty of Humanities,
Curtin University (Drew and John, "NUCLEAR THEORY DEGREE ZERO, WITH TWO
CHEERS FOR DERRIDA," Angelaki, 22:3, 1-16, dml)

A further line of political deflection is the accelerationist strategy.
There are quasi-leftist accelerationists (Mackay and Avanessian). [We
should **take seriously** the proposition that the **only way to save
the planet** is to **accelerate the pace of technological
innovation**]{.underline}. On one view, the only way to save the planet
from global warming is by developing nuclear fusion technology. This
points down the pathway of the Hadron collider and big science. But
there is another acceleration that would decommission all forms of
nuclear technology, and rather than imitating the sun, seek renewable
forms of symbiosis with solar energy. A global diversion of military and
industrial resources into renewable and sustainable energy forms would
constitute a technological acceleration coupled with a radical
deceleration in fossil fuel consumption, perhaps even putting the brakes
on the fallacy of economic growth. What quickly emerges is that [there
are **choices to be made** across contested terrains. The forms of
acceleration are **political choices**, choices of **great urgency**,
but to **thematise**]{.underline} "acceleration" as such [provides
**scant critical purchase** on different forms]{.underline} of
acceleration. [What is needed are **nuanced mediations of the science**
and **technology currently available**, along with **global democratic
decision making** on those technologies we choose to **accelerate** or
**slow down**]{.underline}.

[Another version of the "accelerationist" argument]{.underline} captures
some of the ideological workings of the term. In Marxist circles, an
"accelerationist" [is someone who thinks that the collapse of capitalism
will be **hastened** by allowing reactionary forces to **speed up
capitalism's self-destruction**. There are occasions when such an
argument has validity]{.underline}: nothing about the form of the
argument makes it inherently or structurally wrong. There are
revolutionary moments when allowing capitalism to collapse in order to
rebuild a socialist society is a better path than propping up a failing
capitalist regime. The judgement is political rather than philosophical.
[In **most contexts**, however, the accelerationist argument, especially
as a political principle, is **deeply dangerous**. It would be
**better**, for example, to **preserve a failing US capitalist regime
while building social forces to take it over**, than to allow the
nuclear weapons of the United States to **fall into the hands of a
suicidal military rearguard** or some **counter-revolutionary terrorist
organisation**. Preserving the possibility of human life **might involve
propping up collapsing capitalist institutions**, not least the
**nuclear safety inspectorate**, rather than **allowing humanity to be
swallowed up by some death spiral of presidential dictators** in fear of
being toppled. These are **critical judgements** that could arise at
**any moment**, with **real risks** that poor judgements will **hasten a
nuclear confrontation** that leads to **mutually assured annihilation**.
The **formal shape** of an accelerationist argument needs to be
understood **strategically** and **politically** if it is to address
nuclear questions.]{.underline}

[The accelerationist view]{.underline} that the deepening of capitalism
could hasten its self-destructive tendencies and lead to its collapse
[is **not inherently suicidal**, but consideration of what the
collapse]{.underline} of capitalism [might mean for the **global stock
of nuclear weapons** and **nuclear power stations indicates
dangers**]{.underline}. Amid the collapse of capitalism, [**securing the
safety of nuclear resources** is a **fundamental priority**,
and]{.underline} preparing a decelerationist strategy is [an **essential
political position** for **any radical formation** serious about nuclear
safety. Against the horizon of nuclear crisis, we **rely on workers** to
know how to **manage** and **decommission nuclear weapons**, **silos**
and **power stations**. This requires "**good**" science and ongoing
struggles to **control the decision making** around weapons and energy
systems. **Concrete consideration** of **what happens to ageing nuclear
systems** in an imploding political system has been **tested** in the
fall of the Soviet Union. Imagine the **retrenchment of reactionary
forces** around nuclear installations threatening **suicidal political
terrorism on a global scale**. The risks of a collapsing]{.underline}
capitalist [system **taking the world down with it** are
**clear**]{.underline}. Chernobyl and Fukushima, moreover, stand as
metonyms of the risks involved in systems that were apparently
functional and yet spiralled out of control even in what might be called
peacetime. The risks of the US or the Chinese nuclear androids imploding
involve different decisions. Again, [the need is for **nuanced political
judgements** and **strategies**, involving **scientific expertise**
along with solidarity between scientists, workers and new social
formations.]{.underline}

[The need for **nuanced political engagement** with "good" science
suggests some of the risks in **any thematisation**]{.underline} of
science [within **archaic philosophical paradigms**. One form of nuclear
denial is the **reluctance to engage** with the **concrete
consequences** of scientific knowledge, preferring to **retreat behind
the limited competence of the humanities scholar**. It takes **some
hubris of philosophical interpretation** to suggest that literary
studies can offer to **understand the fictional heart** of the nuclear
threat **despite knowing very little** about the science and technology
involved. There will, **doubtless**, be **philosophical**,
**ontological** and **metaphysical questions** that science and
technology cannot answer]{.underline}. Nuclear arguments may carry
within their forms and conditions of possibility the illusions of
Western metaphysics, and decommissioning nuclear metaphors could turn
out to be as significant as criticising the public lies of nuclear
policy: but the nuclear android also imposes less philosophical
imperatives to engage with science, from medical science to nuclear
waste disposal, and through the critique of the political economy of the
nuclear android. [None of this suggests that metaphysics **should** or
**could be deleted**. To **deflect engagement** with the existing
mess]{.underline} of the nuclear android [back into **metaphysical** and
**literary questions** nevertheless threatens to **evade the existing
threats**, not just of **nuclear annihilation** but of **Indigenous
rights**, **environmental politics**, and the **raft of mediations** and
**regulative practices on which any amelioration of nuclear damage
depends**. Nuclear war remains an **imminent threat**, but so does the
persistence of practices and strategies that **contribute to maintenance
of the spectacle** of the nuclear rather than its **disarmament** and
**decommissioning**. To reduce the problem to the "threat" of nuclear
war is to imagine that the **actually existing industrial behemoth** of
nuclear production is a **fiction**. **It isn't**. Nuclear weapons
testing and the history of nuclear accidents **were not just fables**,
and nor was the arms race a war of **sophistry** and **rhetoric**,
however much sophistry and rhetoric were deployed]{.underline} to
disguise the ecocidal tendencies of the nuclear android.

### 1NC Extinction Bad

#### Humanism relies on the [very ability to decenter itself]{.underline} which proves they [link to themselves]{.underline}---[but]{.underline}, preventing extinction is an [ethical opportunity]{.underline} to [reformulate the human]{.underline} without abandoning it---that's a better way of respecting nonhuman alterity---there's an external [future generations DA]{.underline} that outweighs

**Chernilo, 16**---Department of Social Sciences, Loughborough
University (Daniel, "The question of the human in the Anthropocene
debate," European Journal of Social Theory, advanced online access, dml)

If we follow Margaret Archer (2000, 2003), human reflexivity is central
to the characterization of an autonomous agent. We can conceive passive
social positions as devoid of reflexivity, but [collective action
requires the ability to turn these positions into **specific
projects**]{.underline} (e.g. the difference between being a worker
because of our age, qualification or family background and being a trade
unionist who makes the active decision to part in industrial action).
This matters to us because, rather than rejecting the speciestalk of the
Anthropocene as one of its major limitations, I contend that [it is the
**enhanced human ability** of **reflexive decentring** that is
**central** to our ability to **create** and **imagine new social
forms** and **normative ideas**: this is a general anthropological
capability that we possess as a species]{.underline}. We have seen that,
[because in the Anthropocene debate human action is **effectively
equated** to **instrumental rationality**, then there is **no option**
but to contend that human reflexivity entails **only strategic
action**]{.underline}. Here, [the]{.underline} social sciences'
**[reductionist account]{.underline}** of the social as fields where
power relations and strategic bargaining are all-encompassing
[is]{.underline} being [mirrored]{.underline} in the Anthropocene debate
[by an idea of reflexivity that is **purely strategic** vis-a\`-vis the
aggregated outcome of human action]{.underline}. Mainstream social
science contributes to the problem rather than to the solution of this
difficulty.14

Yet [most accounts of the development of those cognitive skills that are
central to the rise of philosophy]{.underline} and science [as a human
enterprise do emphasize **major acts of human
de-centring**.]{.underline} From the philosophy of language to our
theories of the observation of planetary orbits and gravitational
forces, [the 'Copernican revolution']{.underline} that inaugurated
modern science and philosophy [speaks precisely of the condition that,
in order to be able to explain the cosmos and society, humans **must not
locate themselves at their centre**]{.underline} (Blumenberg, 1987,
2015). Seen in this light, [the most **fundamental feature** of human
reflexivity is the ability to deploy a sense of self-transcendence so
that we are able to look at the world from **somebody else's point of
view**]{.underline}. We can thus conceive of new social institutions,
can create rules that allow us to think and assess different social
orders and, last but least, can change, modify or remedy the results of
our individual and collective actions (Arendt, 1978, Parsons, 1978). Our
ability to conceptualize these features requires us to open up our
conceptions of the human to dimensions that have been completely ignored
in the Anthropocene debate. It is my contention that there are at least
seven of these basic anthropological skills, and, if we put these ideas
together, a different concept of the human begins emerge:
self-transcendence, adaptation, responsibility, language, moral
evaluations, reflexivity and the reproduction of life.15 [These
anthropological traits **define us** as members of the same species and
**create the conditions** for social life to unfold, without this common
humanity itself being able to act directly on society]{.underline}. They
are the basis from which ideas of justice, self, dignity and the good
life emerge and are irreducible to material factors because their
normative worth refers back to our conceptions of what it is to be
human. [They are universal insofar as they include all individuals as
members of the same human species and they are also socially
differentiated in the ways in which humans actualize them. This turns a
generic notion of species-being into a more workable social-scientific
concept]{.underline}. Seen in this light, humans are competitive,
selfish and predatory -- and this fits well with the reductionist notion
of the anthropos that we have seen underpins the Anthropocene debate --
but humans are also evaluative, cooperative and reflexive beings.

The second and final conclusion for this article can be illustrated
through a reading of Hans Jonas' Imperative of Responsibility (Jonas,
1984). First published in 1979 and written in the context of the rise of
green politics in Germany, there is much in Jonas' argument that
pre-empts and is consistent with the Anthropocene debate: [human life
has **fundamentally altered** the ways in which nature reproduces
itself, we are **at a tipping point** vis-a\`-vis the use of natural
resources, and the developments of modern science and
technology]{.underline} of the past few centuries [are **key** to the
challenges that are posed by these transformations]{.underline}. Jonas
also elaborates on the temporality of his normative call in a way that
speaks directly to some of the key motifs of the Anthropocene debate:
[humans are beings who have a **moral duty** towards the **humans of the
future**]{.underline}. That is, [we have the **collective
responsibility** of **leaving them the planet** in such a state that
they will also be able to lead a life that is **worth calling 'human'**:
a **self-determining life**]{.underline}.

But Jonas' (2001) wider intellectual project, his 'philosophical
biology', departs in at least one crucial respect from the Anthropocene
debate: Jonas wholly rejects anthropocentrism. Indeed, [a critique of
anthropocentrism is **central**]{.underline} to his philosophy: all
living beings, [**all forms** of organic life, are **ends for
themselves** and **not a mere resource for humans**]{.underline}. His
argument is that [humans' organic constitution is something that they
**share** with all other forms of life]{.underline}. As 'the first form
of freedom', [**continuous existence** defines the **essential form of
identity** that **constitutes life itself**]{.underline} (Jonas, 2001:
3). [Life is an **end in itself** and this is a **common denominator**
that **humans** and **all living creatures** have in common. Because
they are alive and as long as they remain alive, all organisms look
after themselves and pursue the maintenance of their existence as their
own 'continuous achievement']{.underline} (Jonas, 2001: 80). If this is
the case, then [human nature is **not qualitatively different** from any
other type of organic life]{.underline} -- however simple. Indeed, [even
human sociality]{.underline}, which is reflected in the fact that the
realization of some species' organic potentials requires the company of
and association with others, [is not specifically human. The realization
of their organic potentials may well require certain species to live
within a collective environment, and this sociality remains something
that organisms ought to do because it is in their nature]{.underline}:
even as they have a natural impulse to sociality -- as in the case of
bees and ants -- the source of these tendencies remain previous to it.
[What makes human life unique is **precisely that it can decentre
itself**: it is able to stop making everything cohere around its own
immediate needs]{.underline}.

Jonas accepts that human beings are an object of concern for themselves
because this is the way in which all forms of life organize themselves,
but he rejects a conception of nature whose only value resides in its
instrumental availability for human beings: [humans are an object of
nature rather than its master. Humans are **not** the measure of all
things but instead our **particular species-centred perspective** has
the unique ability to **understand the workings of nature**]{.underline}
-- and in order to do so, it must de-centre itself. Jonas then turns
this cognitive skill into a moral command: [**only humans** can **take
responsibility** for the rest of nature because they **have the power to
do so**. It is 'the **scope** and **kind**' of human powers that
'**determine**' the **type of responsibility** humans have and this
remains a burden that falls **only on human shoulders**]{.underline}
(Jonas, 1984: 98, 128). Given the scale of technological innovations and
environmental challenges that are a direct result of human intervention,
this responsibility has dramatically intensified over the past century.
Indeed, it has become a major social question of our times: under the
current global circumstances, [humans now have a responsibility towards
the **planet as a whole**]{.underline}. In addition to the philosophical
redefinition of life and organic nature, Jonas argues therefore that
[there is a **pragmatic urgency** that makes environmental challenges
**relevant**. **Even if** we **fail to agree** on such foundational
questions as a **common conception** of the **human**, **nature** or
**life**, these polemics are **secondary** to the **practical** and
**political demands** of the world in which we live]{.underline}:

We find ourselves thrown back from the ever-open question, what man
ought to be (the answer to which is changeable), to the first
commandment tacitly always underlying it, but never before in need of
enunciation: that he should be -- indeed, as a human being \... [what
now matters most is **not**]{.underline} to perpetuate or bring about [a
**particular image** of \[hu\]man but]{.underline} first of all [to
**keep open** the **horizon of possibilities** which in the case of
\[hu\]man is given with the existence of the species as such and
\...\[which\] \... will always offer a **new chance to the human
essence**.]{.underline} (Jonas, 1984: 139--40)

Jonas' imperative of responsibility commands that [our actions ought to
**safeguard the possibility** of **continuous human habitation** in the
future. We have the **duty** to leave the planet in a state that is
worthy of human habitation, a planet that will allow future human beings
to **lead a fulfilling human life**]{.underline}. Formulated as a moral
law, Jonas introduces his imperative of responsibility thus: 'there
ought to be through all future time such a world fit for human
habitation, and \... it ought on all future time to be inhabited by a
mankind worthy of the human name' (Jonas, 1984: 10). [We **owe to future
generations** that they are able to conduct their human life as a
**self-legislating experience**: traditional ideas of selfpreservation
need to be **broadened** in order to include an imperative that
**guarantees the future existence** of human beings. The **more we are
concerned** with the future of humanity, the **better will humans look
after nature** itself in the present.]{.underline}

Jonas' position is not free of difficulties; not least of which is that
he favours an arrangement in which technocracy is preferred over
democracy when it comes to making the right decisions on the environment
(Jonas, 1984: 147--55). This is problematic because it curtails in the
present the very principle of self-legislation that he seeks to
safeguard for the humanity of the future. In other words, while Jonas is
aware of the dangers of reducing reflexivity to instrumental rationality
-- as is apparent in the Anthropocene debate -- his position does not
pay equal attention to the reverse challenge: instrumental rationality
is able to enhance and extend moral reflexivity itself.

All its scientific, philosophical and even political merits
notwithstanding, [the Anthropocene debate is built on a **very narrow
understanding** of what a human being is and what human life consists
of. It is based on an idea of the anthropos as a **selfish being** whose
only drive is the constant satisfaction of its multifarious needs
through an **incessantly instrumental attitude** towards everything and
everyone that surrounds it]{.underline}. On the contrary, it has been my
contention here that there is one aspect of the universalistic
orientation of Jonas' ethical theory that remains central to our
normative imagination: [humans can be appealed to as moral agents. This
is an appeal that **builds on** rather than **stands in opposition to**
our human experiences as beings who reside in the natural
world]{.underline}. If [humans are genuinely]{.underline} to be seen as
[a geological force]{.underline}, then this is the case [because they
can realize that the consequences of their actions are to be felt beyond
what is conventionally conceived as 'the foreseeable future'. But the
human ability to think about their responsibility towards future
generations is being **curtailed** rather than **enhanced** by the way
in which proponents of the Anthropocene remain]{.underline} ~~blind~~
[**\[ignorant\] to**, rather than **build on**, the acts of **human
decentring** and **responsibility** that are **central** to all
critiques of anthropocentrism.]{.underline}

### 1NC Network Politics Bad

#### The aff devolves into alt-right fetishism of anonymous networks, free speech, and intellectual property that collapses on itself and accelerates inequality

**Baldwin, 18**---London Metropolitan University (Jon, "In digital we
trust: Bitcoin discourse, digital currencies, and decentralized network
fetishism," Palgrave Communications 4, Article number: 14 (2018), dml)

[Networks are often **fetishised**, presented and assumed to be
**decentred** and **democratic** because they **supposedly exist without
central command**. This is supposed to facilitate **non-hegemonic**,
**noncoercive**, **individualistic freedom of movement**, while
encouraging **some kind of distributed representation** and
**engagement**. To this utopian vision we have become **increasingly
suspicious**: "Don't we know now that networks **also produce
stoppages**, **closures**, **dark spots**, and their **own particular
forms of control** and **governance**?"]{.underline} (Aranda et al.,
2015, p 7) Further possible problems, and the poverty, of decentred
networks are outlined by Berry (2008). A new form of social organisation
is developing in relation to the network and networks are celebrated as
being "decentred, limitless and often, it is claimed, non-hierarchical
and structureless forms or fluid organizations" (Berry, 2008, p 365). It
follows that a distinction is made between two apparently antagonistic
economic, social and technological forms: "industrial hierarchical mass
production vs. peer-produced decentralized network production" (Berry,
2008, p 371). In this scheme [a new priority is given to "**ownership of
the immaterial**---software, algorithms, patents and copyright---that
will determine the shape of the new age"]{.underline} (Berry, 2008, p
370). It is here, however, that Berry argues that [we see the emergence
of a **problematic binary**---material/immaterial---and that even
"something as ephemeral as software has a concrete materiality which
**problematizes this distinction**"]{.underline} (Berry, 2008, p 370).
It is the case that the amount of power consumed by blockchain
operations is so large that it has been suggested that bitcoin itself is
"unsustainable" (Malmo in Golumbia, 2016, p 43). [The materiality of the
network, and the exploitative relations inherent in such materiality,
are a **blind-spot in network fetishism**.]{.underline}

[Trouble continues when we forget that the network models and diagrams
we use are **generative of a real yet to come**]{.underline},Footnote 21
when we think that the world conforms to our digital models and
algorithms Footnote 22, [or when, "we attempt to **remake the world in
terms of our network theories**"]{.underline} (Berry, 2008, p 365).
[These models are **simplifications of the world**: "The network is
**not ontological** it is **analytical**, and as such it is **restricted
in how much it can tell us** and **how useful it can be**"]{.underline}
(Berry, 2008, p 365). The problem is that "the existence of networks
invites us to think in a manner that is appropriate to networks" (Berry,
2008, p 366). [Networks **privilege the connected**, as the
unconnected---by definition---are not within the network. They **distort
a reading of reality** that highlights synchronic dispersal over
diachronic unfolding]{.underline}. In this sense, [networks "**abolish
history** and **shift our focus to the event**, the **happening** or the
**now**"]{.underline} (Berry, 2008, p 366). The idea of the decentred
network remains only "a spatial diagram which provides topological
information about the nodes that are connected with it" (Berry, 2008, p
371). Crucially, ["it **flattens reality** and **removes the
distinctions** between different nodes"]{.underline} (Berry, 2008, p
371). This means that [in a network "an **individual programmer** and a
**multinational corporation become equal** as connected nodes in the
network"]{.underline} (Berry, 2008, p 371). [What looks equal,
democratic, and decentred in the diagram of the network]{.underline},
with simple links and lines of connectivity between indistinguishable
nodes, [**conceals a massive distortion of power** and **power
relations**]{.underline}. Here we might make a distinction between the
network and the node in the way that Bruno Latour, in philosophical
discussion with Peter Sloterdijk, makes a distinction between the
network and the sphere.Footnote 23Unlike networks, "spheres are not
anemic, not just points and links, but complex ecosystems" (Latour,
2015, p 41). Likewise, nodes must be considered as complex ecosystems
behind the apparent simplicity of points, links, and lines of
diagrammatic representation. [Decentralized network fetishism **conceals
relations** and **systems of domination**, **exploitation**, and
**alienation**. This is arguably what has happened with **bitcoin**.
There is an **illusion of circumventing economic power** with
decentralised nodes but what has emerged upon **closer scrutiny** is the
**corporate occupation of cyberspace** in **powerful** and **deep
nodes**.]{.underline}

Another bitcoin obituary

In its first few years, bitcoin was a digital cottage industry run by
hobbyists and "the technology was still essentially just a volunteer
project that relied on the goodwill of users" (Popper, 2015, p 67).
Bitcoin could be mined by relatively fast home computers acting as
relatively equal nodes in a decentralised network. Today, however, most
successful mining is done by pools of dedicated high-power systems in a
sign of increasing nodal power and capital colonisation of the internet.
It is this nodal power that network fetishism is blind to. As Golumbia
suggests, this fact alone "has raised significant questions about
Bitcoins claim to 'democratise' or 'decentralise' currency operations"
(Golumbia, 2016, p 43). This also makes the Bitcoin system exposed to
the \'51 percent problem': if one node or cluster of nodes owns more
than 51 percent of the mining operations it could, at least
theoretically, "change the rules of Bitcoin at any time" (Golumbia,
2016, p 43). There are also debatesFootnote 24around bitcoin
"forks"---in open source software development terms, a possible shift to
a new version. These problems indicate that bitcoin is not as
decentralised as it imagines: "Bitcoin's own governance structures
displayed exactly the autocracy, infighting, bad faith, and
centralisation that the blockchain is often said to have magically
dissolved" (Golumbia, 2016, p 101) In essence, the promise of
decentralisation has not been kept and network fetishism has concealed
the fact that certain nodes function as centralised power bases.

Has bitcoin succeeded, or hinted at potential, in becoming digital
money? At a most basic level, moneyFootnote 25is typically held by
economists to have three prime functions: it serves as an accounting
unit, it has exchange-value (it serves as a medium of exchange), and it
has a use-value (it can store wealth). Bitcoin is arguably so well-known
because of its volatility---its price has fluctuated wildly, and it is
open to derivation and speculation.Footnote 26There is, at present, no
stability, which makes it hard to consider bitcoin a secure store of
value in the way that modulated gold might store value, or even the way
that fiat money (regulated by the state), which bitcoin was promoted to
replace, might store wealth. Bitcoin's very lack of regulation, and
openness to the whim of the market---again, something that was
championed---ensures a volatility that prevents the stability necessary
to store wealth or, indeed, act as a unit of account. The fact that
bitcoin largely "floats free of any anchor to ordinary valuing
processes" (Golumbia, 2016, p 71). means that it cannot fully function
as a stable accounting unit.Footnote 27In 2014 Goldman-Sachs announced
that "Our best definition would be that it is currently a speculative
financial asset that can be used as a medium of exchange"Footnote 28Most
accounts of Bitcoin, such as Brian Kelly's The Bitcoin Big Bang, ignore
the other functions of money and reduce money to currency only. Early
on, the pseudonymous nature of Bitcoin made it the currency of choice
for illegal activity on Silk Road, a dark web vending site, using the
anonymity software Tor. This may well be its legacy: for a short time
facilitating illegal activity and the dissemination of drugs, weapons,
and dubious pornography. It is as a speculative financial asset that the
volatility of bitcoin can be understood. Like any Ponzi scheme, the
investment must be constantly talked-up, the bubble inflated, and this
allows understanding of much of the hyperbole of bitcoin discourse.

There has been hope in some quarters that bitcoin as digital money,
peer-to-peer, with encryption, would be taken up and replace, or
compete, with the likes of PayPal. However, this has not been the case.
On the horizon for bitcoin is the attempt by the likes of Apple, Google,
and Facebook to become payment platforms. They will, like bitcoin,
collect a small fee for transactions, but they will also, crucially
unlike bitcoin, obtain the data that goes along with the transaction.
Data is the new "kind of raw material" (Srnicek, 2017, p 38) of the
digital economy that is being extracted and exploited. The current
strong position these house-hold name platforms have, as well as the
business model of extracting more data, will see one or more of them
attract enough investment and venture capital to fund a "growth before
profits" model (Srnicek, 2017, p 20). This will raise use and activity,
and eventually begin to monopolise the actions and transactions of the
digital economy. In this proposed scenario, and with competition from
other digital monies such as Ethereum, Dogecoin, and Litecoin---which
purport to improve upon bitcoin's inefficiencies---bitcoin is likely to
be unable to compete. There may well be a bursting of the bitcoin
bubble, or long drawn out deflation, and all that will be remembered is
likely to be an early innovative experiment in cryptocurrency.

The bitcoin obituary is almost a genre of its own.Footnote 29In response
to the failure of bitcoin, at least in terms of its own original
ambition, new Silicon Valley advocates began arguing in 2014 that the
significant technological development was not, as Nakamoto initially
intended, a network that allowed participants to make anonymous
transactions outside the reach of the government and banking system, but
rather digital cryptology and distributed ledger technologies. It is
ironic that centralised governments and banks are now taking opportunity
of this digital technology to increase their control and power in a way
that goes against the ethos of early bitcoin ideology. In 2016, the UK
government's chief scientific adviser issued a report which said that
distributed ledger technologies "have the potential to help governments
to collect taxes, deliver benefits, issue passports, record land
registries, assure the supply chain of goods and generally ensure the
integrity of government records and services" (Lanchester, 2016, p 11).
It is thought that the blockchain can be adapted to do this with lower
friction, lower cost, and higher security than any existing system. The
use of the blockchain, albeit not in its original bitcoin form, has
naturally attracted the attention of the banks. Financial institutions,
whose centralisation bitcoin was originally intended to subvert, are
going to use this new technology to maintain their power and keep
themselves right where they are: "in the middle of every possible
transaction network, extracting all the rent they can" (Lanchester,
2016, p 12). Far from weakening government, the banks, and transforming
business, the irony and cautionary tale of bitcoin is that these
enterprises are likely to be empowered by the digital technology that
bitcoin inaugurated. In terms of wider social implications, DuPont has
argued that cryptography is a new weapon in the Deleuzian control
society: "controlling economics through the ordering application of
Bitcoin" (DuPont, 2014). The digital economy has not seen the end of
ownership and power but rather the concentration of property and power.
In the future, one might have to modify Marx and Engels' famous slogan
somewhat: "Decentred digital networkers of the world, unite! You have
nothing to lose but your blockchains!"

Conclusion, bitcoin, the commons, and collectivization

Can bitcoin and its technology have a more progressive future? One such
claim is made In The Real World of the Decentralized Autonomous Society,
where [Garrod (2016) investigates the notion]{.underline}, celebrated by
its enthusiasts, that bitcoin represents the coming [of a
**decentralized autonomous society** in which humans are **free from
centralised forms of power** and **control**]{.underline}. [Garrod
is]{.underline} rightly **[critical]{.underline}** of certain elements
of this notion [insofar as "freedom" and autonomy here is conceived of
as **only** "freedom" and autonomy from the **supposed tyranny of the
state**, not 'freedom' from]{.underline}, for instance, [the **tyranny
of the market**]{.underline}. Bitcoin discourse, "neglects the power
that capital holds over us" (Garrod, 2016, p 62) Despite this criticism
Garrod proposes that [**something can be saved** from the]{.underline}
bitcoin [experiment in digital decentralization and **utilised on the
Left** or **for the Commons**.]{.underline} Based on the model of
bitcoin technology, [it may be "possible to create distributed
collaborative organizations or 'open co-operativism' "]{.underline}
(Garrod, 2016, p 73). [This could be used to help smaller, regional
areas **protect their own commons**---whether they be in the form of
healthcare, education, water, air, Internet, knowledge, and so
on]{.underline}. In Garrod's scenario, [there is the possibility of
**harnessing reactionary technology for progressive aims**]{.underline},
that is, [taking]{.underline} bitcoin and its [technology **outside of
its neoliberal emergence** and **context** to **forward the aims of the
Left** and **serve the Commons**]{.underline}.Footnote 30With
appropriate caution, Garrod claims that bitcoin can "provide the basis
for progressive human development" (Garrod, 2016, p 74).

It is agreeable that one must challenge oppressive structures and
technological practices, but what if one is employing the technology and
tools of the oppressor, Footnote 31and that these tools transform and
distort the holder in their application?Footnote 32 [Has a technology
that was developed to serve the interests of the political right **ever
been successfully recuperated by the left**?]{.underline} Footnote 33 At
least these are concerns worth raising. The discourse around utilization
of digital cryptology appears to be dominated by issues surrounding the
protection of wealth and security of private property---is this
compatible with the aims of the Left and the Commons? Perhaps [the
**biggest obstacle**]{.underline} to the progressive possibilities of
bitcoin technology [is that]{.underline} bitcoin [digital
decentralisation is a **thoroughly ideological** and **neoliberal
notion**, both in terms of its infrastructure and as a product of
technology]{.underline}. As Golumbia has it, "political values are very
literally coded into the \[bitcoin\] software itself" (Golumbia, 2016, p
102). If there is to be a progressive employment of this digital
technology, then this code and software will need much reconsideration.

Ultimately it may only be the humanization Footnote 34 and
collectivization of the Internet that sees true progressive values being
met. "Perhaps today we must collectivise the platforms," suggests
Srnicek (2017, p 127) and Golumbia argues that [what is required to
combat power "is **not more wars** between algorithmic platforms and
individuals who **see themselves as above politics**, but a
**reassertion of**]{.underline} the **[political power]{.underline}**
that the blockchain is specifically constructed to dismantle" (Golumbia,
2016, p 102). [A **reaffirmation** and **resurgence of organised
assembly**, **public controlled** and **collective power to govern** and
**regulate certain elements** of the digital economy could lead to the
**breaking up of digital monopolies**, **regulate business
practices**]{.underline}, ban exploitative "lean platform" employment
conditions, **[impose new privacy controls]{.underline}**, coordinate
action on tax avoidance, [**liberate us** from the tyranny of markets,
and begin to **place capital** and **power into public hands**.
**Long-term egalitarian goals** and **progressive political objectives**
can come from the **collective**, **rather than a designated centralised
figurehead**. All the while **monitoring** and **mitigating the worst
excesses of State power**, and being **independent** of the
"surveillance state apparatus"]{.underline} (Srnicek, 2017, p 127).
[This is ambitious]{.underline} of course, [but would see the **true
progressive potential** of the Internet finally in sight]{.underline}.
