### 1NC Shell -- Body Politics

#### Interpretation -- the body not the plan should be the focus of the debate. The affirmative should perform and defend a reduction in arm sales. 

#### Violation -- The affirmative has called for action from an external actor and does not actualize their solvency inside of the debate. 

#### Standards

#### Presumption -- the affirmative doesn't reduce arm sales, they only suggests a reduction in arm sales which doesn't resolve any of the 1ACs impacts -- vote negative on presumption. 

#### Limits -- plan-focus and disembodied debates blow the lid off the topic -- there are an infinite amount of hypothetical actions the USFG could take -- the USFG is inherently unpredictable for oppressed group. Policy-focus is unlimited because there are an infinite amount of levers of power for white people to oppress -- makes restricting the origins of violence more limited and predictable than how to limit that violence from a governmental standpoint

#### Neg ground -- we can't get access to our DAs or counter-plans that compete off of the performance or method of the 1AC because those exist outside the hypothetical imagining of the plan -- this kills neg ground crucial to survival strategies in debate which culminates in the death of the minority subject in debate

#### Topic Specific Education -- disembodied debate forces aff's to run to the margins forcing negatives to run to the margins, both pursuing strategies meant to undermine substantive discussions of the topic. Body-focused debate would have aff teams discuss how their particular performance is good and encourage the negative team to argue against the actions of the affirmative.

#### Voters -- Framework is a voting issue for accessibility and reversing the death of the minority subject in debate -- this debate is about competing-interpretations which means it is what you do AND what you justify.

### 1NC Shell - Activism

#### Our interpretation is that debate should be a cite for social and political activism. The affirmative must reduce arms sales from the United States.

#### Violation -- the affirmative does not reduce restrictions -- they merely present a plan or suggestion for the federal government to reduce arm sales.

#### C. Standards:

#### 1. Survivor Skills -- survival skills are key to both resistance and existence. People who exist on the margins of civil society need ways to not only engage the state but the conditions the state has created.

#### 2. Limits -- There are an infinite number of potential plans and policy proposals that the affirmative could fiat, but there is a limited amount of ways the bodies in this debate can reduce arm sales. 

#### 3. Ground -- aff interpretation destroys our disadvantage ground based on individual action and forces us to defend USFG inaction -- they make it impossible to be negative.

#### 4. Plan focus debate is bad- 

#### a. Topic education -- the aff encourages bad debate practices like conditionality, plan-inclusive counterplan, international fiat, process pics and a myriad of other bad debate practices because we should debate only the merits of the plan.

#### b. Activism good -- plan focus necessitates that we invest our advocacy in bureaucratic institutions as opposed to people. This displaces or agency and makes us slaves to the state. 

#### c. Fiat is bad -- it is not real and won't produce the material changes needed to resolve the affirmative. This trivializes the violence people experience and uses them as a pawn in a game of debate. 

#### We shouldn't succumb to the institutional demands of our professional lives -- it is our obligation as ethical actors to break-out of the logic doubling, or the idea that we are not responsible when higher powers, like the topic committee, traditional debate, and literalist interpretation of the resolution, tell us what to do.  The alternative is a form of political imagination that can't conceive of difference and culminates in mass death.

**Fasching and deChant 2001** (Darrell and Dell, Prof. of Religious
Studies @ University of South Florida, Prof. of Religious Studies @ USF,
Comparative Religious Ethics: A Narrative Approach, Pg. 42-43)

[Interpreting our own historical situation is a risky business, for we
are still too close to the events. We do not have the distance needed to
put everything into proper perspective. Nevertheless, without such an
interpretation it is impossible to identify the ethical challenges that
face us, so we must risk it]{.underline}. In this chapter we argue that
[two major trends unfolded in the twentieth century that are of
significance for thinking about ethics: (1) the phenomenon of mass
killing encouraged by sacred narratives that authorize \"killing in
order to heal,\" as symbolized by Auschwitz and Hiroshima, and (2) a
cross-cultural and interreligious ethic of non-violent
resistance]{.underline} or civil disobedience symbolized by figures like
Gandhi and King -- one [that functions as an ethic of audacity on behalf
of the stranger. The second, we suggest, offers an ethic of the holy in
response to the sacred morality of the first.]{.underline} [The modern
period, which began with a utopian hope that science and technology
would create an age of peace, prosperity, and progress, ended in an
apocalyptic nightmare of mass death, symbolized by Auschwitz and
Hiroshima, leaving us with the task of creating a post/modern ethic that
can transcend the techno-bureaucratic tribalism that expressed itself in
two world wars]{.underline}. Technobureaucratic tribalism occurs when
sacred narratives are combined with the technical capacity to produce
mass death. While we do not pretend to offer an exhaustive explanation
of the modern propensity for mass death, we do suggest two key elements:
(1) [the use of sacred narratives that define killing as a form of
healing, and (2) the undermining of ethical consciousness by
techno-bureaucratic organization through a psychological process of
doubling (separating one\'s personal and professional identities), which
enables individuals to deny that they are responsible for some of their
actions.]{.underline} Through sacred stories, the stranger is defined as
less than human and therefore beyond the pale of ethical obligation, as
well as a threat to sacred order. At the same time, [bureaucracies
encourage one to engage in a total surrender of self in unquestioning
obedience to higher (sacred) authority]{.underline} (whether God,
religious leaders, or political leaders), [so that when one acts as a
professional self on behalf of an institution (the state, the military,
the church, etc.) one can say, \"It is not I that acts: a higher
authority is acting through me, so I am not personally
responsible.\"]{.underline} Yet, despite the seemingly overwhelming
dominance of techno- bureaucratic tribalism and mass killing in the
twentieth century, a modest but important counter-trend also emerged --
a cross-cultural and interreligious ethic of audacity on behalf of the
stranger, linked to such names as Tolstoy, Gandhi, and King. The purpose
of this chapter is to grasp the ethical challenge of modernity as
symbolized by Auschwitz and Hiroshima. [The purpose]{.underline} of the
remainder of this book [is to examine the potential of the ethical
response to that challenge offered by the tradition of non-violent civil
disobedience, symbolized by Gandhi and King, for a cross-cultural and
interreligious post/modern ethic of human dignity, human rights, and
human liberation.]{.underline}

1\. [Political and organizational structure of government]{.underline}
[The United States of America is a federal republic consisting of 50
states]{.underline}. States have their own constitutions and within each
State there are at least two additional levels of government, generally
designated as counties and cities, towns or villages. The relationships
between different levels of government are complex and varied (see
Section B for more information). [The Federal Government is composed of
**three branches**: the legislative branch, the executive branch, and
the judicial branch]{.underline}. Budgetary decision-making is shared
primarily by the legislative and executive branches. The general
structure of these two branches relative to budget formulation and
execution is as follows.

**Vote Negative --**

#### 1) [Predictable Limits]{.underline} -- nuanced debate over a predictable stasis point is necessary to explore specific mechanisms. Underlimited topics unreasonably burden the negative's research burden and reduce argumentative quality and engagement

#### Limits are a key internal link for Procedural fairness and clash---[post facto]{.underline} topic change alters balance of prep, which [structurally]{.underline} favors the Aff because they speak last and use perms

#### [2) Political efficacy]{.underline} -- Choosing to forego material, resolutional action kills the effectivity of their model - any conversation that begins outside of the development of a concrete praxis for engagement plays into the interests of established, White political interests and enables the [vampiristic consumption]{.underline} of black communities. Their framing of the ballot [monetizes knowledge]{.underline}.

**researchers** in the social sciences]{.underline} of many colleges and

peoples are **left stranded**]{.underline} with little to no resources
[after researchers leave their communities high and dry. Researchers
steal value from oppressed peoples by making them the subjects of
**theoretical research**]{.underline} [without lending them access to
information that could]{.underline} better [help their
communities.]{.underline} Articles, [books]{.underline}, and
dissertations [written about marginalized populations are written for
academics]{.underline}, not working people, [and]{.underline} as such
[have little impact on the people whose lives are the
subject]{.underline} of this research. [Liberal academics]{.underline}
and social scientists [are]{.underline} [more concerned about
**developing** the wealth of academic literature than addressing the
immediate **material concerns**]{.underline} of the communities they
research. Penelope Herideen is a Sociology researcher in Western
Massachusetts (MA) and a professor of Sociology at the local community
college from which I recently graduated. Herideen has written about the
importance of critical pedagogy in community colleges. "Policy,
Pedagogy, and Social Inequality: Community College Student Realities In
Post-Industrial America" was the title of Herideen's research discussing
the realities that community college students face as they navigate
their social and academic worlds. Herideen's research is important, and
yet, she was hardly involved in student organizing campaigns against
budget cuts that affect low-income students. Community college [students
need resources developed through research]{.underline} like Herideen's[.
This is a major flaw in academic research in the social
sciences.]{.underline} Liberal academics and social scientists need to
understand their effect on the communities and people they study.
[Oppressed people who are put under the **magnifying glass** of
**academic research** have to live with **real consequences** after the
**researcher leaves.**]{.underline} This is especially true in the field
of women's and ethnic studies --- where [class, gender, and race
consciousness are a part of the research process. Researchers leave
behind a **stranded community** with little to **no resources** to help
them **organize movements** that will create **real
change.**]{.underline} Tim Wise, a well-known anti-racist writer and
activist receives thousands of dollars for speaking at various colleges
and universities about the impact that white privilege and white
supremacy have on communities of color. Wise has yet to give back to
these communities in any real or substantial way, such as offering
resources and support to the various communities he speaks of in his
writings. [Researchers]{.underline} in the fields of women's and ethnic
studies [entering oppressed communities without any desire to change
serious inequities are in **direct contradiction** of their **supposedly
"progressive" fields.**]{.underline} Women's and [ethnic studies were
created out of the social movements]{.underline} of the 1960s. The aims
of the people who started these fields of study were [to catapult a
movement of better access to education for people of color, poor people,
and women. These goals were met in conflict with a desire]{.underline}
in academia [to **concentrate knowledge** among groups of **specialized
elites**, instead of a focus on popularizing this knowledge for the
greater good.]{.underline} Try reading any academic text from your local
women's studies, ethnic studies, post-colonial studies, or anthropology
department. The texts are almost always written so that only academics
can understand. Some students and scholars call it
"**[acadamese]{.underline}**." It is writing that [needs to be
**decoded** before it can be **understood**.]{.underline} This is what
inaccessible language looks like in academic texts written about
oppressed groups, but not for them. Indian writer and activist Arundhati
Roy discusses the importance of "ordinary language" in social justice
work in her speech given at Hampshire College in 2001: I think it's
vital to de-professionalize the public debate on matters that vitally
affect the lives of ordinary people. It's time to snatch our futures
back from the 'experts.' Time to ask, in ordinary language, the public
question and to demand, in ordinary language, the public answer. Roy
purposefully writes for oppressed groups of people by writing in
"ordinary language." Ordinary language becomes extraordinary when groups
of people who have been historically "othered" are able to read
something that connects to their lives. Academics who use "ordinary
language" are able to encourage oppressed groups to consider their own
agency in the fight for social, economic and political justice. Their
advisors and colleagues constantly berate academics that attempt to
write in ordinary language because their writing is "too accessible."
**[Academics]{.underline}** use academic language and jargon to
[**centralize knowledge** and **power** in their hands.]{.underline}
Academics would lose a certain amount of power if everyone had access to
the same knowledge that they do. The division of labor in [the ivory
tower reinforces **capitalist modes of production** through
individualized research and study]{.underline} that is hardly ever
shared with those it most affects. This is how academia operates
knowledge in the form of transactions that create restricted, instead of
shared knowledge. [**Liberal academics** become **gatekeepers of
knowledge** by reinforcing ideas that **knowledge** should be **bought**
and **sold** instead of **shared** among communities that are studied.
In turn, serious activists]{.underline} who wish to create a world
without capitalism and other forms of oppression [are secluded from
their communities]{.underline} through work in the non-profit sector.

#### 3) [Prefer black Switch Side Debate]{.underline} -- Relying on pre-conceived convictions fuels dogmatism and reduces the capacity for nuanced self-reflexivity in relation to the resolution

**Evans '12** -- Rashad Evans, JD - National debate champion, "The 1NC,"
rwesq.com, November 20 2012, http://www.rwesq.com/the-1nc/)

Now, the debate! First, let me look at Casey Harrigan's ("CH")
definition of SSD. He says that : Definition: switch side debate (SSD)
is the practice that requires debaters to argue both for and against a
given topic in alternating rounds. In effect, it has meant that
debaters' arguments are divorced from personal conviction and instead
made contingently as a means of "testing" the truth value of a
proposition. I will accept this definition, but I think it requires some
more refinement. In a practical sense, [SSD]{.underline}, at a minimum,
[requires that the affirmative defend the resolution]{.underline}. For
the most part, the negative is unconstrained (except by competition) and
[most debates in which SSD comes up the question is whether the
affirmative team should be required to affirm the topic, including some
defense of an action by the United States Federal
Government]{.underline} ("USFG"). The [essential question posed by SSD
is whether the affirmative team should be required to defend the
resolution even when they (1) fundamentally disagree with all or part of
it and/or (2) are compelled to affirm other ideas because of their
"personal convictions]{.underline}." **[The answer to this question must
be yes]{.underline}**. First, [there are multiple ways to]{.underline}
skin a cat and even more ways to [affirm the resolution in the world of
parametric debate]{.underline} because one need only affirm an
interpretation of the resolution and not the resolution writ large.
Therefore, [there are rare instances in which there is no interpretation
of the resolution that you cannot defend and these rare instances are
most likely the product of lack of creativity and research]{.underline}.
So in reality, the question is an even simpler one: should the
affirmative team be required to defend an interpretation of the
resolution. [There are immense constitutive and instrumental benefits to
SSD that cannot be otherwise obtained]{.underline} and therefore must be
required. I ask that the judges: George, Justin and Kyla evaluate this
debate holistically, which requires that they evaluate the benefits of
SSD to the speaker (constitutive) and to society (instrumental). This
also requires that they exclude nothing in their analysis of this
debate. The Constitutive Debaters benefit from SSD. [It requires that
they engage in topics that they may not otherwise engage.]{.underline}
The resolution poses a unique question and the debate round is a unique
time to answer that question. One is much more likely to consider their
personal convictions outside of the debate round than they are to
consider the resolution outside the debate round. Therefore,
[independently of whether one agrees with the resolution or not, there
are benefits to defending an interpretation of the resolution in that it
requires you to consider something you may not have otherwise
considered]{.underline}. These [thought experiments create more informed
and thoughtful debaters and citizens. SSD creates a unique opportunity
for self-reflexivity]{.underline}. The idea is to let your personal
convictions guide you in the debate. The resolution doesn't require that
you suppress your identity or convictions, but is instead an opportunity
to infuse that identity and those convictions into the resolution and
public policy discussion. So, given who you are, what you believe and
what you know what say you regarding energy production? What say you
regarding democracy assistance? What say you regarding federal control
in Indian Country? Therefore, the resolution is an opportunity for you
to refine your personal convictions and put your identity in politics
instead of relying exclusively on identity politics. SSD allows you to
check your own privilege. Here, I will rely on my personal experience. I
once participated in a 30 day creative challenge where the challenge
leader would pose questions on facebook and the group would answer them
in the comments section. One day he asked us to imagine we could be the
other gender for 3 days and to discuss what would we do. I thought about
this on the A-train from Harlem to Chelsea and again from Chelsea to
Harlem and had no answer because I couldn't imagine being a woman. I
explained that as a gay man I don't need to be a woman to have sex with
a man, I don't want a baby in me and more importantly I don't want the
physical vulnerability of being a woman. This realization really forced
me to reevaluate my previous jokes even that as a gay many I was
ontologically indistinct from a woman. I am not. I am gay and I am
black...in many ways I am the the worlds bottom, but even I could would
not want to occupy the body of a woman. That thought experiment taught
me a lot about myself, privilege and the world. Sometimes, you have to
take a walk in someone else's stiletto to learn who you really are.
Seriously CH, have you walked in stilettos? It will change your life.
**[SSD is both necessary and sufficient to ensure that you debate your
personal convictions.]{.underline}** Remember, [if you are staunchly
opposed to the resolution you get to lodge those complaints on the
negative]{.underline}. Also, remember that what is good for the goose is
good for the gander and if you don't have to debate the resolution then
no one has to debate the resolution. This [loosening of the restrictions
on the resolution may mean that no one gets to debate anything they
want. I mean lets face it, no one wants to be topical]{.underline}!
There's always a better version of your aff that isn't topical. Every
2AC considers severance or intrinsicness because the resolution is
flawed or insufficient. However, a true debater understands that they
both have to debate on the affirmative and the negative and that [in
order to do either effectively there must be stability in the
relationship between the affirmative and the negative]{.underline}.
Therefore, [committing yourself to the resolution is key preserving your
own negative ground to engage in your critique of the
resolution]{.underline}. As goes the resolution so goes your personal
convictions about that resolution. [The Instrumental SSD is the only way
to organize a fair debate tournament]{.underline}. We must have a topic.
There must be rules and allowing any and everyone go rogue because of
their "personal convictions" it is a recipe for disaster. I don't want
to live and debate in that world. There must be strict requirements on
defending the resolution to allow for fair and predictable negative
ground. By the way, protecting fair negative ground is easier and more
important than all other concerns regarding fairness. [All people of all
convictions have to be negative at some point.]{.underline} Which means
that the affirmative-negative dialiectic is the only intersectional
analysis that can be performed because all people of all identities will
eventually find themselves on the affirmative or negative side in
debate. [Preserving negative ground then preserves the
ground]{.underline} of women, minorities and hippies. SSD ensures that
we have all hands on deck in these extraordinary times. We need all
perspectives and all peoples to engage in all debates. SSD facilitates
this. Allowing students to pick their own topic because of their
"personal convictions" may mean that important issues get ignored all
together. I mean, what would happen if we let the students set the
curriculum? Would they learn anything, ever? How many times have you
heard these questions in a classroom: why do I have to learn this? Will
this be on the exam? My major is X, why do I need to learn Y? Blah. Yes,
students would almost always like to do what they want to do. If we
allowed this where would we be as a country? Who will be there to tackle
the important questions pertaining to immigration, energy production,
the Arab Spring, etc? Engaging the resolution from your specific social
location can cause others to change their views. [There are several
examples of creative interpretations of the resolution that have
inspired folk to view the topic and life differently]{.underline}. [This
is when debate is at its best]{.underline} and when it's engaging in
important knowledge production. Debate and debaters have the potential
to infuse new arguments, ideas and perspectives into the resolution and
into the broader discussion. Now, the line by line! CH says: 1. It
presumes debate as a "pedagogical bull-pen", which undermines the
activity's potential for radical change. Students are told "you can't
know anything until you debate both sides", ignoring the VAST WEALTH of
lived experience that underwrites specific claims about identity, the
world, praxis, and the topic. In some ways, it is like Loyola's argument
about info accumulation -- we are told to place a hold on "conviction"
until we have "enough information" and "enough testing" when in reality
there is either never a point where "enough is enough" OR we have
\*already\* crossed that point and should be able to utilize the debate
space for advocacy. It makes debate into a game about hypothetical
action rather than a potential site for social justice. First, there are
radically topical interpretations of the resolution. Second, how does
one know that their lived experience is dispositive of any debate
without testing it against the research and lived experiences of others.
It's not that you can't know anything until you debate both sides but
more importantly that you debate both sides before you conclude you know
anything. Lastly, there is no internal link between resolutional debate
and the loss of social justice. In fact, one should always debate the
resolution in a way that produces social justice. 2. It is anti-Black.
[The norm of SSD and topic construction mandating USFG action presume
that public policy is valuable because it is equally accessible to all
participants, when in reality access is ANYTHING BUT that]{.underline},
relies on a belief that USFG action is a locus for change when in
reality and history it has produced the opposite, marginalizes
individual perspectives as "too local", and does not account for the
specific conditions of Black participation in debate. Your
anti-Blackness argument is without warrant. **[To the extent that
anti-Blackness is a problem, SSD is the solution]{.underline}**.
Certainly, holding on to ones conviction in avoidance of debate has
never benefited Black people in the past. Thinking itself is Blackness
(whiteness is anti-thought), so [avoiding a debate because of personal
conviction is quintessentially anti-Black]{.underline}. In fact, many of
debates current ills stem from people avoiding debates and holding fast
to their convictions. Also, **[the USFG is not uniquely
anti-Black]{.underline}**. [The world is anti-Black, so to isolate the
USFG is to fundamentally misunderstand Blackness]{.underline}. [The USFG
has been a locus for change where others have failed.]{.underline} [For
instance, the civil rights act]{.underline} regulated the racist
behavior of private individuals and corporations. [School
desegregation]{.underline} required federal intervention to ensure state
compliance with the constitution. [The Violence Against Women's
Act]{.underline} regulates individual behavior in the home which was
once considered a private matter. [This is]{.underline} not to suggest
that the USFG is a saint, but [to suggest that the question requires
more nuance and that **nuance is provided only by SSD**]{.underline}.
The specific conditions of Blackness require SSD. After years of
exclusion from education generally and debate specifically, its right
time that we jump into the discussions. **[Black SSD not equal white
SSD]{.underline}**. [Black debaters are the future and they will remake
the world partially in an image of themselves. This requires that they
theorize their Blackness across topics, resolutions and
debates.]{.underline} This is the revolution we are waiting for.

## 1NC -- Alternative Models of Debate

### 1NC -- Collaborative Model

#### Prefer the collaborative model as opposed to the adversarial nature of plan -centric debate -- pure competition is bad -- argument polarization, mitigates results, and ignores nuance in strategies

**Komoroske 16** (Alex Komoroske, Group Product Manager and Staff
Writer, "Debate should be collaborative, not combative", Medium,
https://medium.com/@komorama/debate-should-be-collaborative-not-combative-185ff37f1d34)//AR

The title might seem ridiculously over-generalized. [Debate tournaments
in high school]{.underline}, for example, [are a public battle of ideas
that have a clear winner and a loser]{.underline}. Surely those should
be combative? Of course they should --- [they're a classic zero-sum
game, where if one side wins the other must lose.]{.underline} But this
form of debate, while familiar, is extremely rare in real life and not
particularly important in the grand scheme of things. Its familiarity
means that when we hear "debate" we too often jump straight to a
combative stance. [The far more important type of debate in the real
world is a wholly different animal]{.underline}. It, too, is about
pitting ideas against one another to find the strongest one. But [unlike
in high-school debate, the team who advances the strongest idea isn't
the winner. The goal is to uncover the best solution to a given problem:
to understand a complex and ambiguous problem space as fully as
possible]{.underline}. Who had the best idea is immaterial. Unlike a
high-school debate, [**this framing reveals it to be a positive-sum
game.** And that difference between zero- and positive-sum game makes
all of the difference]{.underline}. [In a zero sum game, the proper
stance is competitive. But in a positive sum game, the proper stance is
collaborative]{.underline}. If the two parties together come to a better
understanding than either had individually before, everyone wins. How to
approach a collaborative debate No one knows everything. Everyone
approaches problems in a different way. This diversity, if properly
harnessed, can lead to better results than any one party could have come
up with on their own. [Seek to understand the other parties' insights,
concerns, and confusions]{.underline}. [If they have an insight, then
you can incorporate it and make the leading idea better.]{.underline} If
they have a legitimate concern then you can improve your idea to better
defend against it (or, if it's significant enough, pivot to a better
approach altogether). And even if they are confused, figuring out how to
help them understand will help you communicate your idea more
effectively to others in the future. [In a collaborative stance you go
into the debate willing to learn and willing to change course when
presented with better arguments or data]{.underline}. Riff off of one
another's ideas. [Try different framings, different models, different
metaphors and see which ones stick]{.underline} --- and then build off
of those. At all times focus on adding positive energy to the
exploration. Staying in a collaborative stance is difficult, and it's
easy to accidentally shift back into a combative stance. Be careful not
to privilege your own ideas. Be on the watch for emotional responses to
critiques or competing ideas --- if left unchecked they tend to cause
similar responses in others, derailing the whole discussion. It's
tempting to conclude that your debate partners are not participating in
good faith, or are taking a combative stance. But challenge yourself to
assume good faith and to always bring the other participants back to a
collaborative stance whenever they stray. After all, everyone has a
shared interest in identifying the best solution, and the only way to do
that is to maintain a collaborative stance. [If, with patience and a
willing partner, you are not able to convince the other that your idea
is superior, than perhaps it isn't]{.underline}. Get to the root of the
disagreement, the core point where you don't see eye to eye. Is it a
misunderstanding? A legitimate disagreement? Different assumptions about
the value of a currently unknown quantity? Work until you uncover it and
fully understand it. Th[e collaborative approach to debate is one of the
best ways to understand complex, and especially ambiguous, problem
spaces. The result is a stronger idea that more perfectly anticipates
the messy reality it will have to operate within.]{.underline}

"In fact, we don't have to reach very far at all to find a blank-out
campaign in our world. In 1998, Puerto Rican voters were faced with a
referendum about the status of the island. They were given a choice
between statehood, independence, free association, commonwealth, or none
of the above. A heated debate arose over the definitions of the terms.
The definition of commonwealth, in particular, raised some concerns. So
a campaign was launched to vote "none of the above." That vote signaled
a refusal to accept the given options; it was a political act to not
play the game as scripted. "None of the above" won 50.2 percent of the
vote. We need to do something that bold. Something that will upset the
entire game. In 2016, we should call for an "electoral blank-out." We
vote in the national election for the presidency of the United States,
but we leave the ballot blank or write in "none of the above." This
isn't your standard call for a third-party candidate or an independent
black political thrust. Nor is it a rejection of our sacred duty to
vote. Exercising the franchise is sacred. "Actually, I want black people
to turn out for the election in record numbers without Obama on the

This promise wants us to believe that voting is democracy. But that's
only half true. Sure, we must work overtime (sadly) to ensure that no
one rolls back the gains of the Voting Rights Act and that everyone has
access to the ballot. [But the work of democracy does not end with
elections."]{.underline} "**[We should turn our attention to efforts
like the Forward Together moral movement and the Dream Defenders and
#BlackLivesMatter]{.underline}**, or to [mobilizing around public school
closings in our neighborhoods]{.underline}. **[Some issue, concrete and
right in front of us, should be our focus.]{.underline}** A collateral
effect, although not the main objective, would be the election of men
and women at the state and local levels who aren't about symbolism and
celebrity, but who put forward a strategic vision for our communities.
([When elections become the primary aim of grassroots mobilization, the
conditions for demobilization are built into the very
activity]{.underline}. [If you succeed, you are often left twiddling
your thumbs]{.underline}.) The hope would be that the "Blank-Out 2016"
campaign could change the tone and focus of American politics, and
demonstrate that black folk have finally gotten sick and tired of being
sick and tired." "[The core of the campaign would be a coordinated
effort---a networked coalition---of grassroots organizations whose
primary task in the run-up to the election would be to focus attention
on particular issues in the black community]{.underline}. These
organizations would urge black voters to leave the presidential ballot
blank or to write "none of the above." But [the trade-off would be to
take up an issue (or issues) that requires our attention beyond the
election cycle]{.underline}. The idea is to use the presidential
election as a moment to disrupt the notion that democracy rests
primarily with elections and to reject black liberal politics. [Combined
with action in the street, we could shut down the power of politics as
usual in this country. I am suggesting a seismic shift in black
politics]{.underline}. Obviously, we can't stand idly by as Democrats
take our votes for granted and cave to forces that devastate our
communities. Nor can extremists on the right and those who enable them
expect us to sit back as they trade in racist nonsense, continue to
legislate for the 1 percent, and undo the modest gains we've made in
this country. What has become crystal clear over these past few years,
at least to me, is that business as usual isn't sufficient; that [the
typical black characters on the national scene have to be called out for
what they have failed to do and say in the face of what has happened and
is happening in black America]{.underline}." "I want to be clear. **[I
am not suggesting that we concede the national political
scene]{.underline}** [(although I am certainly suspicious of
it).]{.underline} Instead, we have to reboot national politics---change
the flow of the current. [Here intensified local efforts enter into a
network of other local practices across the country that, taken
together, have national political implications]{.underline}. **[You can
build a national politics from the ground up rather than think about it
as decisions that flow from the top down]{.underline}**. [That's what
the protests did. They connected what happened to Michael Brown in
Missouri and Jessica Hernandez in Colorado and John Crawford III and
Tanisha Anderson in Ohio with Eric Garner in New York and Trayvon Martin
in Florida and Ezell Ford in California and Yvette Smith in Texas and
Tony Terrell Robinson Jr. in Wisconsin]{.underline}. The same has
happened with the reaction to the closing of schools in places like
Chicago, Detroit, and Philadelphia, and with struggles for a livable
wage for workers at Walmart and McDonald's all across the country. [We
can do what the civil rights icon Ella Baker did]{.underline}, in her
early days of [organizing NAACP chapters]{.underline}. She established
pathways, connections, and conduits that "linked her practice across the
United States. Like her, [we can build a network of local efforts that
can give us a more robust form of democratic politics.]{.underline}
[Collectively, such grassroots work]{.underline}---people doing what
they do in their communities linking up with other people doing similar
work in their communities---[loosely constitutes a national
politics."]{.underline}

### 2NC Overview -- Body Ptx/Activism

#### Structural violence structurally disadvantages debate. Our age alone prohibits us from democratically participating nor could we actualize change in Washington DC from Austin, Texas; however, the PURPOSE of debate, or at least THIS debate, should debate as a location of activism.  This would mean that the affirmative must reduce arms sales from the United States. This is necessary to situate conversations around what WE can do now and not what can happen later. Some students do not have the luxury of using this space as training, rather it is their primary avenue to action which makes it critical to actualize this spaces potential.

#### The affirmative does not meet our interpretation: 

#### \<insert impacted no meet arguments including, but not limited to the plan does not happen, USFG as an actor, debate as a game etc, plan based strategies are bad.\>

#### Prefer our interpretation -

#### a. Presumption - nothing about the affirmative will produce the advantages discussed in the debate. You should immediately vote negative when they do not materially change the status quo.  b. Survival Skills - We need not learn how to act later, but engage in action now. Similar to the 1acs impacts something needs to be done today. We can learn the material outcome of our actions today which will help fine tune activism later, but solves our argument about the necessity of action today. The affirmative would encroach on those skills by devaluing the knowledge that students bring to the activity and the perspective they bring about what should be done now. Perspectivism is net-benefit to our method because it encourages students to relate to the topic via their experience. 

#### c. Limits - They make it impossible to be negative. They could make the united states do literally anything or engage in an infinity amount of thought experiments which makes burden of being negative insurmountable. Placing limits on the affirmative\'s direct actions avoids exploding debate and actualizes the power of debate to be a vehicle for change. 

#### We will win that their proposed model of plan-focused debate is bad:

### 2NC - 1. Unlimiting

#### a.       Makes it impossible to be negative -- we would have access to any and every action by the USFG multiplied by fiat which explodes the negative research burden which turns their interpretation.

#### b.       Makes it impossible to be affirmative -- crushes our potential to use our experiences to relate to the topic. We would have to rewrite our experiences to cater to the topic and not our needs which literally makes debate impossible because it does not address our everyday needs

### 2NC - 2.  Anti-educational

#### a.       Conditionality -- it allows it and encourages it. Condo is a voting issue because it encourages argumentative irresponsibility, kitchen sink strategies, and multiple contradictory arguments and destroys affirmatives competitive equities. 

#### b.      Plan Inclusive counterplans -- plan focus guarantees PICs. PICs are a voting issue because they steal aff ground and for the aff to debate itself, encourages vague plan writing which destroys negs ground and result in trivial distinctions between the plan and the counterplan like a penny saved is a penny earned. You cannot PIC out of an embodied performance.

#### c.       Process CPs -- Neg's interpretation allows it because they focus on the process of implementation. Process PICs are a voting issue because they destroy topic specific education, they destroy the aff because they include the affirmative, and lastly, they are limitless and unpredictable. If you hate conditions, consult, and dirty word PICs - vote for us!

### 2NC -- 3. \<insert aff specific state-based offense\>

## 2NC -- Extensions

### 2NC -- Ext - Norms Bad 

#### Even in Debate, Assimilation doesn't Work

Evans debated prior to the emergence of performance styles of debate. As
Duane Hartman says, he debated in a traditional, mainstream style. He
was undoubtedly used as an example of Black debaters fitting in to the
community and excelling. However, even [for Rashad Evans, racism was a
problem. He assimilated]{.underline}, at least in terms of outward
performance[, and yet, he still experienced problems as a Black man in
the debate world]{.underline}. Prior to the Louisville team's emergence,
[the choice of rejecting or assimilating seemed to be the two options
for debaters of color]{.underline}. And yet we see that [for Rashad
Evans, a decision to assimilate did not mean that a person of color
would be treated equally to his or her white peers]{.underline}. John
Calmore (2005) describes racialized Black identity as performance, and
whiteness as audition (p. 100). 21 ["Non-white performance in a
dominantly white setting has been a historical predicament\.... Indeed,
the rights enjoyed by white males could only be obtained by assimilatory
behavior\.... white performance was the quid pro quo for white
privilege"]{.underline} (Calmore, 2005, p. 102). This assimilatory
behavior, this performance of whiteness by a person of color, is always
audition for Calmore, because of a historical "universality of
\[combined\] white experience \[and\] judgment as the authoritative
standard that binds people of color and normatively measures, directs,
controls, and regulates the terms of proper thought, expression,
presentment, and behavior" (Calmore, 1995, p. 318). [Performance of
whiteness is always conditional to acceptance from whites; who as part
of white dominance "normatively measure" the performance for
acceptability.]{.underline} Rashad 21 I will discuss the performance of
race at more length in Chapter 5. 171 [Evans may have]{.underline}
performed whiteness and through the quid pro quo described by Calmore,
[achieved some success in the white-normed debate world.
However]{.underline}, according to Calmore [his performance was always
an audition,]{.underline} always [subject to special
scrutiny]{.underline}. [Some found that performance wanting and he was
then subject to racialized performance of white dominance]{.underline}.
[Instead of rejecting the practice altogether, or assimilating into its
current manifestation, performance debaters and their coaches, starting
with the transcendent Louisville Malcolm X squad, have collectively
created a third way. This radical alternative to the conventional
practice of debate is rooted in the expression of student voice and
experience]{.underline} (usually but not exclusively as people of color)
and based on a crucial recognition of social structure in constant
struggle with agency (again, usually but not always race-based). [The
debaters and coaches, moreover, function as a positive racebased
community working for liberation and the uplift of oppressed
communities]{.underline}, in this case the African American community in
the city of Baltimore. In this chapter I discuss these aspects of the
practice, before explaining the practice itself as an agentic mode of
performance and doing

#### A static interpretation of how we should debate assumes debate as a monolithic, rich and white activity, functionally excluding debaters who don't fit into those dichotomies.

The Intercollegiate Policy Debate community can be conceived of as a
speech community. **[The highly technical procedures and jargon laden
aspects of Debate have a language that can be specific to Debate itself
and can be exclusionary to underrepresented populations.]{.underline}**
By using the speech community model of analysis, this can help one

a site for examining how speech communities (un)intentionally suppress
and exclude minority members,]{.underline}** particularly Blacks.
Membership in a particular identity group occurs when two or more
individuals have a shared linguistic system that would include some or
all of their language, practices, norms, beliefs, and values. Speech
community as defined by Patrick (2002) as being a socially-based unit of
linguistic analysis is the term that some linguists have used to refer
to these groups. A speech community could be bound geographically
(Labov, 1989; Feagin, 1996), nationally (Dittmar, 1976), and
socio-culturally (Morgan, 2002). Verbal communication is not the only
tool used to make up a system of communication. According to Rosina
Lippi-Green (1997), ―**[language is more than a tool 50 for
communication of the facts between two or more persons. It is the most
salient way we have of establishing and advertising our social
identities]{.underline}** (p. 5).‖ This is done in a variety of ways;
for instance, through verbal communication, ways of dressing, gestures,
signs, facial expressions, written text and symbols. All of these things
combine to make up communication between people possible. Particular
language patterns and meanings are understood according to the meaning
prescribed by factors such as culture (Boas, 1911; Sapir, 1921; Whorf,
1956); the economy (Bourdieu, 1977; Irvine, 1989); cognition (Lakoff,
1988; Croft & Cruse, 2004); and social constructions (Gumperz, 1982;
Hymes 1967). Michael Silverstein (1985) argues that ―language is an
unstable mutual interaction of meaningful sign forms contextualized to
situations of interested human use mediated by the fact of cultural
ideology (p. 220).‖ The dialogue between speakers of different
backgrounds is constantly reiterating and constituting language codes
and patterns meaningful to each particular speaker. This is particularly
true for Debate. **[Debate is inherently an oral exchange of ideas and
world views from people of diverse backgrounds.]{.underline}** Naturally
debaters will come across various ideas and world views over the course
of their careers. During this time period debaters take from these
exchanges aspects that they find productive and useful, thus altering
their original language patterns. However, **[the process for
determining what is productive and useful is guided by their particular
ideologies. These ideologies are shaped by each individual's
relationship to society at large]{.underline}**. Therefore, as
Silverstein contends, ―**[we must look at their ideas about the meaning,
function, and value of language in order to understand the degree of
socially shared systematicity in empirically occurring linguistic
forms]{.underline}**‖ (p.220). This meaning, 51 function, and value can
be analyzed in the context of what Norman Fairclough (1989) calls
**[discourse, ―a social practice determined by social
structures]{.underline}** (p. 17).‖ Fairclough argues that **[discourse
is determined by socially constituted orders of discourse, or sets of
conventions associated with social institutions. Historically,
traditional norms and procedures within Debate have determined the
orders of discourse for the Debate community. These norms and procedures
of debate developed out of a culture of a relatively homogenous group of
wealthy, white males.]{.underline}** However, **[the increase in
diversity]{.underline}**---**[defined as race, class, gender, sexuality,
and those with disabilities---in recent years has shifted
Debate]{.underline}** into a more heterogeneous community. With the
influx of each group has come the potential of different ways of
communicating, **[thus creating a need to shift the norms and procedures
of debate to account for these differences.]{.underline}**
Unfortunately, there is no mechanism in place to guide this shift. As a
result, **[there have been tense conflicts over what constitutes
―appropriate‖ or ―productive‖ language use within Debate]{.underline}**.
Recognizing that each of these groups has its own relationship to
Debate, each group would warrant independent research.

**Many technical procedures of debate exclude black debaters, thus they
produce their own alternative debate methods.**

Blacks in the Debate community. It is important to note that [some Black
debaters have chosen to participate in the normative practices of
debate; therefore, the emphasis here will be on those Black debaters who
have elected to engage in alternative debate methods]{.underline}. These
methods vary in performance and presentation and thus should not be
reduced to an essentialized notion of ―Black Debate.‖ Nevertheless,
there are cultural discourse patterns that can be found in most of the
variations of alternative styles. The Debate literature suggests that
some of the methods utilized by alternative debaters victimize Debate
(Zompetti, 2004), are less productive for the goals of debate
competition (Atchison and Panetta, 2009), and do not maximize the
benefits that Debate can provide (Harrigan, 2008). Therefore, [this
research seeks to enter that dialogue and offer an alternative view of
the clash of civilizations that is occurring in Debate by arguing that
some of the traditional norms and procedures of debate can have the
unintended effect of excluding Blacks.15]{.underline}

#### In order to truly bring change and resolve impacts presented in the 1AC the aff must participate in dissident engagement and actively refuse the resolution/USfg to contest the norms 

Sparks 03 (Holloway Sparks, 7/29/18,

In this essay, I argue [that contemporary democratic theory gives
insufficient attention to the important contributions dissenting
citizens make to democratic life. Guided by the dissident practices of
activist women, I develop a more expansive conception of citizenship
that recognizes dissent and an ethic of political courage as vital
elements of democratic participation. I illustrate how this perspective
on citizenship recasts and reclaims women's courageous dissidence by
reconsidering the well-known story of Rosa Parks]{.underline}. A black
woman named Rosa Parks refuses to give up her seat to a white man on a
Montgomery, Alabama bus in 1955 and goes to jail. A group of welfare
mothers led by [Johnnie May Tillmon]{.underline} challenges the attempts
of white, middle-class male organizers to assume leadership roles in the
welfare rights movement in 1966. Poet, activist, and black lesbian
feminist [Audre Lorde]{.underline} pointedly calls white feminists to
account for their racism, classism, and homophobia during the 1981
National Women's Studies Association meeting. Activist [Candace
Gingrich]{.underline} comes out publicly as a lesbian following the
election of her conservative half-brother Newt as Speaker of the House
in 1994[. In spite of the crucial roles these activist women have played
in contemporary U. S. politics, mainstream democratic theory offers few
resources for thinking about their actions in terms of citizenship. For
political theorists interested in democracy, however, the dissident
practices of Parks, Tillmon, and other activist women provide a rich
source for considering what it means to be an active, self-governed
citizen, and what it means to act together with others in a political
community.]{.underline} In this essay, I argue that [the dissenting
practices of these women point toward an expanded conception of
democratic]{.underline} Hypztiu vol. 12, no. 4 (Fall 1997) 0 by Holloway
Sparks Holloway Sparks 75 [citizenship that incorporates dissent,
recognizes courage as central to democratic action, and reclaims and
revalues the courageous dissident practices of women
activist]{.underline}s. Although feminist historians and social
movements scholars have recently devoted a great deal of attention to
women's activism (see e.g., Crawford et al., 1990; West and Blumberg
1990; Laslett et al., 1995), this work has had little impact on
democratic theorists. Part of the reason for this inattention, as a
number of feminist theorists have noted, is [the tendency of democratic
theorists to ignore the public activities of women]{.underline}
(Ackelsberg 1988; Pateman 1989; Evans 1993). An additional reason is
[the deliberative and discursive focus of much contemporary democratic
theory. Recent controversies about citizenship have primarily centered
on the role of citizen deliberation in democracies]{.underline}.
Participatory theorists, such as Carole Pateman, Benjamin Barber, Jane
Mansbridge, Iris Marion Young, and theorists drawing from the work of
Hannah Arendt and Jurgen Habermas have generated a lively debate about
[the promise and possibilities of reconceptualizing and
institutionalizing citizen deliberation in a wider variety of public
spaces.]{.underline} Citizenship, however, involves more than
deliberation. Deliberation, however critical as a practice, is often the
goal rather than the starting point for those who engage in dissident
citizenship. I [conceptualize dissident citizenship as the practices of
marginalized citizens who publicly contest prevailing arrangements of
power by means of oppositional democratic practices that augment or
replace institutionalized channels of democratic opposition when those
channels are inadequate or unavailable]{.underline}. Instead of voting,
lobbying, or petitioning, dissident citizens constitute alternative
public spaces through practices such as marches, protests, and picket
lines; sit-ins, slow-downs, and cleanups; speeches, strikes, and street
theater. [Dissident citizenship, in other words, encompasses the often
creative oppositional practices of citizens who, either by choice or
(much more commonly) by forced exclusion from the institutionalized
means of opposition, contest current arrangements of power from the
margins of the polity]{.underline}. While dissident citizens can be
progressive or conservative, civil rights activists or segregationists,
pro-choice or pro-life, environmentalists or smokers' rights advocates,
they share a commitment to unconventional forms of democratic engagement
and opposition that nonetheless preserve the possibility of ongoing
debate and disagreement. Consequently, [if democratic citizenship is
ultimately about "the collective and participatory engagement of
citizens in the determination of the affairs of their
community'']{.underline} (Dietz 1987, 14[), then marginalized dissident
citizens who address the wider polity in order to change minds,
challenge practices, or even reconstitute the very boundaries of the
political itself engage in a form of democratic citizenship that is
essential for the continuing revitalization of democratic
life]{.underline}. 76 Hypatia [A crucial element in the practice of
dissident citizenship]{.underline}, I wish to argue[, is the discourse
and practice of courag]{.underline}e. One way to describe courage is as
a commitment to resolution and persistence in the face of risk,
uncertainty, or fear. Because of its strong association with the
behavior of soldiers, courage has often been constructed as a
quintessentially masculine trait, tied intimately to conceptions of
manhood and to the performance of violence (see esp. Brown 1988). But as
the examples at the beginning of this essay demonstrate, women are
perfectly capable of acting resolutely in the face of risk, uncertainty,
and fear, even though they are much less likely to be credited as
courageous actors. A courageous act, moreover, need not be a violent
one. It is commonly believed and well documented, for example, that
nonviolent resistance activities, protests, and communication with
opponents can require courage, especially in the face of verbal abuse,
threatened incarceration, or the possibility of physical violence. Civil
rights Freedom Riders who responded to mob attacks with nonviolence in
the summer of 1961, for example, clearly practiced courage while
resisting segregation in the American South. A less well developed
perspective is that communication, connection, and dialogue with allies
and potential allies can require the practice of courage as well. For
example, Audre Lorde speaks of the courage feminists have needed to
confront racism within their own groups. Women of color have practiced
courage by breaking the silence about racism; white women have practiced
courage by not turning away from the painful recognition of their own
racist practices. By courageously confronting racism, Lorde argues,
feminists have strengthened their alliances (Lorde 1984b). [Like
resistance activities, these connection and coalition activities are
important dimensions of the practice of dissident citizenship. In both
cases, discourses and practices of courage shape political engagement
and action, even under conditions of uncertainty and especially in
contexts where dissident citizens face domination and
oppression]{.underline}. Although contemporary democratic theory offers
little guidance for considering the role of courage in democratic life,
attending to the way that conceptions of courage are used to shape and
mediate dissent allows us to explore the ways that dissident citizenship
itself is negotiated and performed. Exploring courage will also draw
attention to how dissident citizenship is constructed and negotiated in
gendered, raced, and classed terms. In this essay, I construct an
account of dissident citizenship that includes attention to political
courage and that offers an approach for exploring the dissident
practices of women. Drawing on feminist theorizing about oppositional
citizenship, multidisciplinary work on women's activism, and activist
accounts of dissent, I argue for a conception of citizenship that
recognizes both dissent and an ethic of political courage as vital
elements of democratic participation. After briefly exploring a case
study of women's activism, I conclude with some reflections on what this
approach offers to democratic theorists and others interested in women's
citizenship and public activities. Holloway Sparks 77 CONTEMPORARY
PERSPECTIVES ON CITIZENSHIP [To understand how dissent has fallen
through the cracks of much mainstream democratic theory, it is helpful
to review how that theory conceptualizes citizenship and the role of
conflict in democratic life]{.underline}. In the liberal democratic
tradition of political thought, conflict between citizens is expected
and institutionalized. As exemplified in the work of theorists such as
John Rawls (1971,1985), Ronald Dworkin (1978), and Robert Nozick (1974),
this tradition conceives of citizens as legitimately self-interested
individuals who have agreed (contracted) to respect each other's
individual liberty and interests.' Governments are charged with
enforcing this respect, and should provide enough protection and
regulation to preserve individuals' abilities to pursue their diverse
interests and ends, especially in the marketplace. But because citizens
also need protection from powerful governments, certain activities and
spaces are withdrawn from legitimate public interference and are
protected as "rights." Furthermore, citizens are granted an additional
check on their government by way of regular elections. [Politics,
according to this view, is the process of resolving the inevitable
conflicts and disputes that will result when citizens pursue their
interests and their individual conceptions of the good
life.]{.underline} These conflicts, however, will be resolved by
representatives, not by citizens themselves. Citizens who "lose" in a
conflict, furthermore, are expected to respect the decision, even if
they begin the institutionalized process of disagreement again. [Under
the liberal democratic view of political life, in sum, conflict is a
given but is tamed by established institutional forms of
expression]{.underline}. As Mary Dietz has observed, 'This vision of the
citizen as the bearer of rights, democracy as the capitalist market
society, and politics as representative government is precisely what
makes liberalism, despite its admirable and vital insistence on the
values of individual freedom and equality, seem so politically barren to
so many of its critics" (Dietz 1987, 5-6). Communitarian theorists such
as Michael Sandel (1982, 1984) and Alasdair MacIntyre (1981), for
example, find the liberal vision of suspicious, self-interested,
isolated citizens tremendously impoverished. In Sandel's view, "we
cannot be wholly unencumbered \[liberal\] subjects of possession,
individuated in advance and given prior to our ends" (Sandel 1984, 166).
He and MacIntyre insist instead on the "embeddedness" of individuals
(and therefore citizens) in their communities. In contrast to the
liberal celebration of individual rights and self-interest,
communitarians claim that what is in the interest of an individual is
inextricably tied to what is good for a community as a whole: ["my
identity is not independent of my aims and attachments, but partly
constituted by them; I am situated from the start, embedded in a history
which locates me among others, and implicates my good in the good of the
communities whose stories I share"]{.underline} (Sandel 1984, 9).
Citizenship thus becomes the project of cooperatively 78 Hypatia seeking
the good for a community, as a community, rather than as self -
interested individuals. In the "local forms of community" that
communitarians favor, conflict-r at least serious conflict-seems to
disappear. The "central bond" of a communitarian community, MacIntyre
argues, is "a shared vision of and understanding of goods" (MacIntyre
1981,258). This shared vision, along with attention to traditions and to
one's history and roles, provide guidance for community interactions
that ideally embody "civility" (MacIntyre 1981, 263) and, one gathers, a
high degree of consensus. In a community where values and a sense of the
common good are shared, citizens are not adversaries, as liberal
democrats would have us believe, but something closer to friends or
perhaps even relatives. Unlike the liberal democratic view, which leaves
immutable conflict at the heart of public life, communitarians suggest
that citizen concern for the common good makes cooperation flourish and
conflict disappear. Recent participatory theorists join the
communitarians in finding the liberal conception of citizenship too
limited and adversarial, yet propose a quite different vision of human
living together in response. Drawing on traditions and sources as
diverse as Greek political thought, Italian Renaissance civic
republicanism, the writings of Jean-Jacques Rousseau, Alexis de
Tocqueville, the American pragmatists, and Hannah Arendt, contemporary
participatory theorists have argued for a conception of citizenship that
puts citizen action and self-government at the center of political life
(Pateman 1970; Mansbridge 1980; Barber 1984; Dietz 1987; Habermas 1989;
Young 1990; Fraser 1992). It is only through the active participation of
citizens, these theorists argue, that democracy becomes legitimate: "Men
and women who are not directly responsible through common deliberation,
common decision, and common action for the policies that determine their
common lives together are not really free at all, however much they
enjoy security, private rights, and freedom from interference" (Barber
1984, 145-46). Citizenship in a participatory democracy, therefore,
requires significant participation in common institutions of
self-government, institutions "designed to facilitate ongoing civic
participation in agenda-setting, deliberation, legislation, and policy
implementation (in the form of 'common work')" (Barber 1984,151). These
participatory institutions, by transforming strangers into
citizen-neighbors through common conversations and projects, enable
citizens to envision and articulate "a common future in terms of
genuinely common goods'' (Barber 1984, 197). And as Benjamin Barber
argues in Strong Democracy, this common vision need not be purchased by
suppressing conflict or by sacrificing individual interests. Conflict
and disagreement, Barber insists, can instead be transformed by citizen
deliberation and action. Participatory politics deals with public
disputes and conflicts of interest by subjecting them to a never-ending
process of delib- Holloway Sparks 79 eration, decision, and action. . .
. In such communities, public ends are neither extrapolated from
absolutes nor "discovered" in a preexisting "hidden consensus." They are
literally forged through the act of public participation, created
through common deliberation and common action and the effect that
deliberation and action have on interests, which change shape and
direction when subjected to these participatory processes. (Barber
1984,151-52) Unlike the liberal democratic vision of citizenship, which
views conflict as something merely to be tolerated or managed, conflict
in a participatory democracy becomes an occasion for learning and for
actively creating consensus where none existed before.2 Citizens learn,
through democratic interaction with other citizens, how to enlarge their
vision of their own freedom and interests to include others (Barber
1984, 232). The result is a form of democratic life, Barber argues, that
respects both individual and mutual purposes. Barber's vision of
participatory democracy, although powerful, has been challenged
persuasively by other participatory theorists. These theorists are
critical (sometimes intensely so) of Barber's failure to recognize
deep-seated inequalities that affect participation and interaction in
public life. As an example, some theorists flatly reject Barber's case
for putting political equality before economic equality, and for
assuming that common talk and common action can take place in the
presence of the systematic inequalities produced under capitalism.
Herbert Bowles and Samuel Gintis, for instance, present a compelling
argument for why the economy must be subject to democratic
accountability in a society that values equality and participation
(Bowles and Gintis 1986). In a similar vein, Richard Flacks has argued
recently that democratic societies must discover ways to democratically
control the movement and impact of global capital while simultaneously
creating more participatory economic institutions and practices (Flacks
1996). Meaningful political participation, these theorists insist,
requires some sort of substantive economic equality (Fraser 1992,
118-21). In addition, Iris Marion Young has criticized Barber's
inattention to the deep-seated inequalities produced by the cultural
imperialism practiced by dominant social groups. Cultural imperialism,
in Young's view, is "the universalization of a dominant group's
experience and culture, and its establishment as the norm" (1990,59).
Although she supports Barber's vision of a democratic society where all
people participate in public discussion and decision making, Young takes
Barber to task for defining the public realm as one in which social and
cultural differences must be "submerged" in favor of apparently neutral
deliberation about "the common good." In Barber's strong democracy,
Young observes, "The pursuit of particular interests, the pressing of
the claims of 80 Hypatia particular groups, all must take place within a
framework of community and common vision established by the public
realm" (1990, 117). This is problematic because dominant groups have the
power to "project their own experiences as representative of humanity as
such" (1990, 59). Public discussions framed in terms of community,
common vision, and unity, "as opposed to group affinity and particular
need and interest," Young argues, consequently privilege the voices and
perspectives of dominant groups who "dominate the allegedly common
public" (1990, 117). Any legitimate public conflict, consequently, is
precluded by a fraudulent consensus. (See also Mansbridge 1980; 1990,
127.) Although she respects Barber's desire to counter the liberal
vision of atomistic, self-interested individuals, Young argues that it
is not necessary to replace that vision with a falsely homogenizing
"ideal of community." Instead, Young supports the creation of what she
terms "a heterogeneous public." The repoliticization of public life does
not require the creation of a unified public realm in which citizens
leave behind their particular group affiliations, histories, and needs
to discuss a mythical "common good.'' In a society differentiated by
social groups, occupations, political positions, differences of
privilege and oppression, regions, and so on, the perception of anything
like a common good can only be an outcome of public interaction that
expresses rather than submerges particularities. . . . Indeed, in open
and accessible public spaces and forums, one should expect to encounter
and hear from those who are different, whose social perspectives,
experience, and affiliations are different. To promote a politics of
inclusion, then, participatory democrats must promote the ideal of a
heterogeneous public, in which persons stand forth with their
differences acknowledged and respected, though perhaps not completely
understood by others. (Young 1990,119) Citizenship, in Young's
heterogeneous public, thus takes the form of participation in public
discussion and decision making, but in an institutional context that
"equalizes the ability of oppressed groups to speak and be heard" (1990,
189). Institutional mechanisms and public resources should support group
representation by providing for the self-organization of oppressed
groups, the group generation and analysis of policy proposals, and group
veto power regarding specific policies (1990, 184). Group
representation, Young concludes, prevents oppression, draws conflict
into the open, and provides all social groups with the resources for
meaningful participation in joint agenda setting, deliberation,
decision, and a\~tion.\~ Although Young does not confine the principles
of group representation to representative bodies in government settings,
clearly her proposal has an Holloway Sparks 81 institutional focus. All
her examples are decision making bodies; the "democratized publics'' she
talks about are institutional ones. While both Barber and Young have
considered ways to expand democracy within current institutions,
democratic theorists drawing from the work of Jiirgen Habermas have
drawn attention to an additional realm of participation, what Habermas
and others have called "the public sphere." The public sphere, in Nancy
Fraser's words, designates a theater in modern societies in which
political participation is enacted through the medium of talk. It is the
space in which citizens deliberate about their common affairs, and hence
an institutionalized arena of discursive interaction. This arena is
conceptually distinct from the state; it is a site for the production
and circulation of discourses that can in principle be critical of the
state. The public sphere in Habermas's sense is also conceptually
distinct from the official economy; it is not an arena of market
relations but rather one of discursive relations, a theater for debating
and deliberating rather than for buying and selling. (Fraser 1992,
110-11) In recent years, theorists drawing on the notion of the ideal
public sphere have defended a conception of democracy variously termed
"deliberative democracy," "proceduralist-deliberative democracy,"
"discursive democracy," or "communicative democracy." (See esp. Habermas
1987 and 1989; Dryzek 1990; Fishkin 1991; Joshua Cohen 1989; Mansbridge
1992; Benhabib 1996a.) Deliberative theorists join the participatory
theorists in advocating significant political participation and "the
widest-reaching democratization of decision making processes" possible,
but they expand the focus on political participation to "a more
inclusively understood concept of discursive will formation" (Benhabib
1992'86). In the words of Seyla Benhabib, [under the deliberative
conception of democracy, participation is seen not as an activity only
possible in a narrowly defined political realm but as an activity that
can be realized in the social and cultural spheres as well]{.underline}.
Participating in a citizen's initiative to clean up a polluted harbor is
no less political than debating in cultural journals the pejorative
presentation of certain groups in terms of stereotypical images
(combating sexism and racism in the media). (Benhabib 1992,86)
Citizenship in a deliberative democracy, consequently, means
participating in "the determination of norms of action through the
practical debate of all affected by them" (Benhabib 1992,86). The
precise rules that should govern the practical debate are a matter of
some dispute (see, e.g., Habermas 1996; Joshua Cohen 1996; Young 1996)'
but this more expansive notion of partici- 82 Hypatia pation as talk and
deliberation in a variety of settings, Benhabib claims, "articulates a
vision of the political true to the realities of complex, modem
societies" (Benhabib 1992,86).4

#### The personal is political -- critiques offer important world views on how structures demarcate violence and are important to teaching debaters how to engage in real world change.

**Gehrke 98** (Gehrke, P.J. (1998). Critique Arguments as Policy
Analysis: Policy Debate Beyond the Rationalist Perspective. Contemporary
Argumentation and Debate, 19, 18-39.)

Implications of Critiques as Policy Analysis These two views of
**[critique arguments]{.underline}** \-- critiques as policy criteria
and critiques as interpretive policy analysis \-- **[expand our
conceptions of policy debate by demonstrating the roles of critiques in
policy discourse.]{.underline}** Some may find the implications of these
views uncomfortable. Policy analysis critiques should not replace all
other theories of critique argumentation or methods of policy analysis.
Rather, this theory expands the ways that we can think about and discuss
policies. Any debater, theorist, coach, or critic who advocates a policy
fOCllS has little theoretical basis from which to exclude critique
argumentation from their decision making process. The further one
entrenches oneself in the policy literature the more necessary critiques
become. Time is always at a premium in debate rounds, and debaters may
already feel they are dealing with too many issues. However, we should
remember that there was a time when debates moved, in general, much
slower and included a justification of decision criteria in the
affirmative case in addition to the requisite policy evaluation.
Constrained by time, some debates will focus more on policy
instrumentalities, some more on competing values, and\" some more on
communicative implications. This is simply a reflection of the fact that
**[the art of policy analysis \"lies in realizing when inadequate data
or social values other than efficiency make the narrow benefit-cost
approach inappropriate\"]{.underline}** (Weimer and Vining 311).
**[Critiques enhance our current model of policy discourse and can
improve our ability to perform policy evaluation and
advocacy.]{.underline}** A caveat here must be that viewing critiques as
a dimension of policy analysis does not seem to provide a model from
which we may comfortably evaluate arguments that critique the policy
focus. Arguments that question the project of policy making may be
ill-suited to the perspective of critiques as policy analysis. We should
not indict or reject critiques that we can not frame as policy analysis.
Rather, these positions simply must ground their relationship to policy
advocacy in something other than the models outlined here. However, the
vast majority of critiques do not break with the assumption that we are
debating about what we should do. **[Whether one critiques patriarchy,
statism, legal objectivism, modernism, essentialist ontology, democracy,
capitalism, or a host of other subjects, these arguments most often
attempt to shape our actions \-- our personal, social, and political
policies.]{.underline}** Repositioning critiques within the realm of
policy analysis provides an opportunity to overturn some common
assumptions about critiques found in claims made by both proponents and
opponents of critique argumentation. Perhaps most disturbing to some is
that incorporating critiques into policy analysis revokes their status
as a priori issues. However, we should resist so privileging any
argument form. Placing critiques before all other arguments generates a
structure that stultifies and stagnates the critical investigation of
issues. Instead, we should place specific arguments in contingent
hierarchies for the purpose of evaluation in a particular debate.
Critiques are additional methodologies for discussing our shared world
and shared action \-- the realm of policy debate. Hence, the
implications of a particular critique for a particular decision should
be grounded in the particular arguments advanced in that particular
debate. Accepting critiques as a part of policy analysis may help us to
redefine the relationship between debate and politics. **[Even the most
radically esoteric critique arguments may be deeply political, and
positioning critiques as policy analysis asks us to think of ourselves
as policy analysts and policy makers]{.underline}**. This very
proposition politicizes debate and revives the reality of the debate
forum. **[Thinking of debate and critiques as policy advocacy, policy
analysis, and pol icy making explodes the distinction between debate and
the \"real world\" by erasing the fictionality of debate rounds. Once
debaters and critics recognize themselves as real citizen/policy makers
rather than imagined governmental bodies, they will find it more
difficult to exclude values, ethics, and morals from their
decisions]{.underline}**. Critique opponents may argue this personalizes
the politics of debate, making decisions more arbitrary or dependent
upon a critic\'s subjective value system. We might more accurately say
that it uncovers politics. If the policy theorists and. analysts
discussed here are correct, then the rationalist model is no less
political or personal; rationalism merely denies and masks its political
and personal biases. In attempting to maintain the rationalist position,
a body of value hierarchies and epistemological assumptions are enforced
as given truths. Toppling the hegemony of the rationalist paradigm has
the \' pleasant side effect of unmasking the non-rational and emotional
bases for decisions made under the guise of the rationalist model.
Debaters and critics will need to struggle with how these issues can be
adjudicated in a debate round. Considering critiques as substantive
issues removes the easy hierarchy of issues that gave critique arguments
their trump status, and will require that critics and debaters develop
more sophisticated practices of comparison and evaluation. Non-policy
theorists such as Zarefsky may provide some guidance, but much work will
have to be done in the debate rounds. For value critiques, debaters
might advance both a criteria for the adjudication of the issues at
hand, and a value hierarchy that helps to place the competing values in
the debate in relation to one another. Language and advocacy arguments
might be advanced as substantive issues in a debate when a team argues
that the critic, as a citizen/policy maker, should not specifically
endorse the other team\'s advocacy. This could be as philosophical as a
moral obligation to not engage in or endorse particular communicative
behaviors, or as instrumental as a discussion of the implications of
advocacy for policy implementation and interpretation. Executive and
judicial bodies often interpret policies based upon the advocacy that
advanced them. This is especially apparent in judicial attempts to
interpret international treaties (Bederman 972-976; Koh 343). Solt may
have provided grounds for language and advocacy arguments as substantive
issues within the policy frame: \"**[If language is so abused that the
integrity of the debate process has been undermined, then it probably
should be a voting issue]{.underline}**\" (\"Demystifying\" A I 0). If a
citizen/policy maker feels that the language choices have impeded
effective GEHRKE 35 consideration of the issues, they may opt simply to
reject the proposal of the offending party. Solt\'s argument against
critiques is that such abuses are uncommon in debate. This is not a
criticism of the theoretical legitimacy of language critiques, but
rather questions the common practice of relying upon tenuous links
between arguments. **[Ethics violations or critiques]{.underline}** that
are equivalent to \"calling fouls\" in the debate \"game\" **[could also
be reconsidered as substantive reasons why a citizen should not endorse
a particular advocacy]{.underline}**. **[Ethics violations question the
reliability and character of the debaters, as weIl as all of their
arg·umentation. Politically these are powerful arguments. In debate, we
often remove them from the realm of debatable propositions in favor of
having critics or tournament administrators adjudicate them
independently. In politics they are openly discussed and debated and
result in political ramifications for propositions, policies, and
advocates long before any judicial body mandates criminal or civil
penalty. If one can adequately convince a citizen/policy maker that an
advocate of a proposition is lying, it is unlikely that the
citizen/policy maker wiIl entertain many of the arguments of that
advocate.]{.underline}** Of course, reconsidering critiques as policy
analysis is not an unassailable proposition, and it may be subject to
criticism for its focus on academic policy literature. The theorists
discussed here include policy analysts and advocates from the RAND
Corporation and the Cato Institute, and a variety of policy analysis
educators and scholars. Their work does not comprise the entirety of
perspectives on policy analysis, and there are many in the policy field
who take issue with their positions. However, Dan Durning and Will Osuna
do provide a quantitative analysis of the perspectives of working policy
analysts. They conclude not only that most policy analysts are not
objective technicians, but also that the majority of policy analysts
recognize that no policy problem has a single right solution.
AdditionaIly, the majority of analysts do not believe that a single
unified theory of policy analysis can explain or solve all policy
situations (649). It could also be claimed that the model of critiques
as policy analysis is unrealistic in terms of what a policy analyst must
do, which is to convince a client to foIlow their advice. While the
rational policy model may manifest hegemony in academic debate, such is
not always the case in policy analysis. Consider some advice from Weimer
and Vining: \"Sometimes doing good simply requires analysts to advise
their clients to forgo some current popularity or success to achieve
some important value. You are doing exceptionaIly well when you can
convince your client to accept such advice\" (408). 36 CONTEMPORARY
ARGUMENTATION AND DEBATE Just as Weimer and Vining seek to ensure that
the training of policy analysts considers perspectives other than policy
rationalism, so must we as debate educators and critics ask ourselves if
**[limiting academic debate to a rationalist perspective pays too high a
price in the values it sacrifices and messages it sends.]{.underline}**
**[If policy debate is to train better citizens and political activists,
then we must consider the inclusion of value arguments critical to this
education.]{.underline}** Political deliberation rarely relies solely
upon instrumental rationality. Even given the tendency of some policy
analysts to take a predominantly instrumental perspective, the inclusion
of nonnative value claims is prerequisite to a meaningful and compelling
justification or dejustification of a policy. Policy rationalism fails
for the same reason Brownlee and Crossman specifically indicted
cost-benefit analysis: \"In the attempt to replace consent with reason,
\[it\] typically omits vital steps in the debate over values\" (I).
Arguments focused upon value systems are a much-needed corrective to the
weaknesses of the rationalist policy paradigm (Anderson 31). **[In
academic debate, it is critical that the training and experience of the
students, coaches, and critics include the consideration and evaluation
of competing value claims.]{.underline}** Value conflicts are
increasingly central to politics in the United States. Brownlee and
Crossman note that conflicts between constituencies over regulatory or
redistributive policies are usually centered around \"the absence of a
common set of value priorities\" (I). **[If debaters, after spending
hundreds of hours in the activity, are left with the impression that
decision making only entails considerations of instrumentalities within
the bounds of fonnal rules or ethical guides, academic debate will be
responsible for proliferating amoral and value ignorant policy
advocates, and citizens who are ill-equipped to cope with the valueladen
issues of contemporary politics.]{.underline}**

in public discourse about Jews is almost exclusively a feature of

conservative critics and progressive defenders stand in a symbiotic
relationship: They are united in their desire to silence the message
most Jews want to send. The right insists on condemning the Democratic
Party and any progressive conversation about Israel as institutionally
anti-Semitic, [never mind that most Jews are committed Democrats and
often share the progressive critique of Israel's rightward drift that
Republicans are so eager to tar]{.underline}. Many of Omar's progressive
defenders, for their part, are happy to simply dismiss all talk of
left-wing anti-Semitism as conservative agitprop; they are content to
rely on the usual assortment of fringe voices who -- so long as Israel
is on the docket -- will offer to kasher even the clearest instances of
anti-Semitic discourse. It makes for a crushing feeling of
powerlessness. [The nation is having a conversation about Jews virtually
impervious to the input of Jews themselves. This, above all else, is
what makes so many Jews want to scream in frustration. **The right
loudly proclaims it's standing up to anti-Semitism** -- but Jews know
their 24/7 Omar coverage does us no favors, and that in any event,
conservative solidarity with Jews runs out precisely at the point it
requires challenging the sort of **anti-Semitic conspiracy mongering
that gets Jews shot.** The left self-righteously insists that it is
saving its ammunition for combating the "real anti-Semitism" -- but Jews
have long seen that for too much of the left, cases of "real
anti-Semitism" beyond the most obvious murderous varieties seem almost
as elusive as O.J.'s "real killer." Both sides are silencing Jews in the
guise of allyship. Both sides need to step back and knock it
off.]{.underline}

#### The political hides sheltered through acts of antisemitism as cities refuse to recognize the violence, systematically silencing what's happening. The political has gotten smarter - instead of obvious forms of Nazi violence and oppression, it prefers a new, systematic form of exclusion through the media and state. The political has adapted to resistance - people started identifying it after ww2 simply because it made itself too obvious. The same cities in which windows are filled with signs saying 'never again', are the cities in which Jews realize that the only recognition of anti-sematic violence will always be the holocaust - that's exactly what the political wants, the political wants us to focus on the obvious forms of Jewish violence in the past so we can ignore that our people silently dying in the status quo

### 2AC -- Ext - Body Ptx: Queer

#### In order for disabled and queer bodies to access the political they must first overcome the politics of shame and respectability.

Nancy Mairs, a self-described crip, writes, ["The fact that **the
soundness of the body** so **often serves as a metaphor for moral
health, its deterioration thus implying moral degeneracy,** puts me and
my kind in a quandary. How can I possibly be
'good**'**]{.underline}?"---a statement of shame if ever there were one
(1996, 57). [It is, of course, medical discourse we usually turn to in
order to decide which bodies are sound and even what bodily soundness
is, and the reliability of this discourse is seldom questioned.
**Disability** as presently constructed in the United States **manifests
itself as a central deﬁning characteristic of a personhood that is
rendered less than ideal**]{.underline} (Gauthier 1983; Wilkerson 1998,
88--93). This lesser status appears to be incontestable because it is
medically certiﬁed, with medical evidence regarded as utterly objective,
detached from values, emotions, and particular human interests. Yet
**[neither medical fatalism nor medical relegation of some to a lesser
status or a life without sexuality is fully deterministic in the end,
nor are other oppressive cultural norms]{.underline}**. Alternative
possibilities for politics and pleasures are being imagined and enacted
individually and collectively. Often, it has been noted, after all, that
being regarded as outside the norm gives one less stake in upholding it,
particularly when it turns out to be punitive, unjust---or impossible.
And when one experiences a break with the past, as in the case of those
who are suddenly disabled, the loss of "how things used to be," though
undeniably traumatic, can sometimes open the door to new possibilities.
For example, some (although not all) of the participants in Elle
Becker's early study of women with spinal cord injury report eventually
becoming more sexually assertive after their injury, due to the need to
actively reconstruct their sexual desires and practices, rather than
passively enact what they have been led to expect of themselves and
their partners (1978). Nondisabled women have much to learn from these
responses to an extremely challenging circumstance, just as everyone can
learn more from paraplegics and quadriplegics about the extensive
possibilities of human sexualities that depart from heterocentric and
phallocentric norms. If these arguments have been convincing, [**the
political importance of overcoming shame will be quite clear.** There
are many ways to try to overcome or avoid shame, **and perhaps one of
the most common involves bids for respectability,** but as Warner warns
us, this strategy poses signiﬁcant risks for queers. Perhaps
respectability poses similar dangers for feminism.]{.underline} [If the
"ofﬁcial queer movement" is pursuing respectability through marriage and
thereby solidifying the outsider status of those who don't jump on the
marriage bandwagon, national feminist organizations may be pursuing the
same illusory and problematic goal when they defend "reproductive
choice" as the right to avoid unwanted pregnancy, while failing to
defend women's right to sexual pleasure]{.underline}. Warner argues that
**[an accessible sexual culture is necessary for sexual
autonomy]{.underline}**. Bartky warns of the harms to women of what
might be called a patriarchal sexual monoculture. Their arguments
suggest that **[we must attend to the material conditions which make it
possible to access sexual culture and work to transform those which make
it unimaginable.]{.underline}** We must consider, for example, the war
against terrorism upheld as protecting American lives and helping to
liberate Afghan women, while they and other women are allowed to die all
over the world in childbirth or from unsafe abortions. President Bush is
currently withholding \$34 million in congressionally approved funds to
the United Nations Population Fund because of false allegations that the
money could be used to promote abortions. This could jeopardize delivery
of supplies to Afghan women, since the Fund provides "clean underwear,
sanitary napkins, and sterile delivery kits---soap, a string, and a
clean razor blade" (Cocco 2002). **[Overcoming shame and undermining the
moral inﬂuence of medicine]{.underline}** (which comes not only from
direct pronouncements and omissions but also from its cultural status as

the experiences of creating new pleasures which disabled people
exemplify, or the speciﬁc forms of resistance to sexual viliﬁcation or

some measure gain others' mutual recognition and respect, which are not
primarily psychological or attitudinal, although attitudes are
important; **they are more broadly political.**]{.underline} In other
words, [**the success of counterdiscourses requires not only that they

### 2NC -- Ext - Discourse First 

#### Critical arguments are necessary in debate to hold debaters accountable for their discourse and the potentially violent implications and impacts such discourse can have. 

**Gehrke 98** Gehrke, P.J. (1998). Critique Arguments as Policy
Analysis: Policy Debate Beyond the Rationalist Perspective. Contemporary
Argumentation and Debate, 19, 18-39./

While critique arguments were once rare in academic debates, today they
are part of nearly every debater\'s experience. Contemporary debates
frequently grapple with arguments that indict or advance values, systems
of knowledge, and language choices. It is difficult to know whether this
growing popularity is due to advances in critique theory, a growing
dissatisfaction with traditional models of policy debate, or the
competitive success of critiques in debate. What is apparent in debate
literature and discussion is that a substantial amount of controversy
still exists about the saliency of critiques to academic policy debate.
Some policy debate advocates claim there is no place for critiques in
the comparison of policy options, while advocates of critiques often
consider such arguments broader than a policy perspective, arguing that
**[critics should consider critiques before resolving policy
questions.]{.underline}** Whether one subscribes to Roger Solt\'s view
that \"the kritik is on balance bad for debate\" (Anti-Kritik ii) or
William Shanahan\'s view that \"kritiks allow debate access to another
of its fundamental assumptions\" (AS), it is clear that at least for the
near future **[critiques will playa major role in the practice of
academic policy debate.]{.underline}** At this point, the controversy
over critique argumentation is at an impasse. Both sides of this
controversy marginalize critique arguments by positioning them outside
of policy deliberation. The predominate notion among both supporters and
opponents of critiques is that they are argued as a sidebar to the
policy debate. While I am sympathetic to, and often agree with, the
philosophical potential envisioned by those who endorse critique
arguments, their reasoning often fails to address the questions raised
by those who doubt the role of critiques in policy debate. We cannot
transcend these differences without repositioning the relationship
between critique arguments and policy deliberation. This essay contends
that meaningful policy evaluation often includes arguments similar to
those labeled \"critiques\" in academic debate. Specifically, it argues
that **[critique arguments, rather than serving as a priori or
tangential issues, are relevant dimensions of policy analysis and should
be treated as substantive issues in policy debate]{.underline}**. The
idea that the issues raised by critique arguments are relevant to the
substance of policy disputes is consistent with arguments made by
innovative policy analysts and policy scholars. Many policy theorists
argue for including in the policy discussion process arguments that
mirror certain forms of critique argumentation. This position may seem
unusual, given that some debate theorists tend to believe that policy
analysis excludes critique arguments However, a considerable body of
policy studies literature clearly supports the inclusion of critiques
based upon competing value orientations and critiques based upon the
communicative aspects of the policy process. The Status of Critique
Arguments in Academic Debate In contemporary academic debate, critique
arguments encompass a wide range of philosophical issues. Shanahan
originally focused on the German existential philosopher Martin
Heidegger\'s call to explore how we think about being in the world. This
continental pedigree gave rise to the commonly used German spelling,
kritik. Shanahan contends that **[traditional policy debate \"functions
on a foundation of unquestioned assumptions]{.underline}**\" (A4). He
calls for debaters to advance arguments that can uncover and investigate
these assumptions. Shanahan holds that **[the focus ought not be on the
results of such a questioning, but rather that the process of thinking
and questioning itself is to be valued]{.underline}** (A4). Since
Shanahan, debaters have expanded critiques from their existential
origins to include a broad diversity of philosophical and political
perspectives. Recent critiques have been based on Riane Eisler\'s
feminist anthropology, Herbert Marcuse\'s theory of repressive
desublimation, Immanuel Kant\'s categorical imperative, and Ayn Rand\'s
objectivism. A second origin of critique argumentation is Kenneth
Broda-Bahm\' s theory of the language-linked value objection, or
\"language critique.\" Broda-Bahrn **[indicts academic debate for
operating under the assumption that language is transparent and purely
referential]{.underline}**. He uses Ludwig Wittgenstein\' s theory of
language games to argue that **[words and their use have effects, and
that critics should consider objections to certain language choices when
adjudicating debates]{.underline}**. As originally conceived, the
language-linked value objection focused \"more directly on the actual
language practices of an opponent\" (Bahrn 69). Broda-Bahm gives
**[language critiques]{.underline}** primacy as voting issues because
they **[make claims to immediate and tangible impacts that \"uniquely
happen as a direct result of our advocacy]{.underline}**\" (Bahm 76).
More recently, theorists and debaters have fashioned critiques involving
such diverse arguments as evidence challenges, morality arguments, and
objections to particular styles of delivery (Berube, \"Kritiks\"). For
the purposes of this essay, critiques conveniently may be divided into
three argument forms: value critiques, epistemology critiques, and
language critiques. This classification system is relatively common in
critique literature. David Berube refers to ideational (value), thinking
(epistemology), and language critiques (\"Criticizing\" 68). Solt
separates critiques into practical philosophical critiques (value), pure
philosophical critiques (epistemology), and language critiques
(Anti-Kritik ii-vii). While these \..... \"I . · t. : \....
classification schemes are neither universal nor comprehensive, they are
functional for \.... discussing the relationship between critique
argumentation and policy deliberation. **[Value critiques establish or
indict value systems or advance ethical or moral claims.]{.underline}**
These take the shape of deontological critiques, decision rules, value
hierarchies, ethics violations, and moral obligations. When an
affirmative claims a moral obligation to implement their policy, they
are advancing value arguments in an attempt to justify their policy
position. Likewise, these arguments are frequently advanced by negatives
contending that an affirmative\'s proposed policy is discriminatory
(i.e., racist, patriarchal, heterosexist, etc.) or morally unacceptable
as a COurse of action (such as the pacifist\'s opposition to committing
violent acts). Value critiques were the stock and trade of \"value\"
debate, usually referred to as criteria and value objections arguments
(Zarefsky IS). Epistemology critiques establish or indict means of
creating or finding truths. These include arguments such as Paul
Feyerabend\'s critique of scientific method and Murray Edelman\'s theory
of enemy construction. Epistemology critiques predominantly question the
reliability of particular methods of making predictive and descriptive
claims inherent in a particular policy advocacy**[. Every policy case
advances causal and predictive claims. These claims are each the result
of a particular way of coming to or creating knowledge, such as
laboratory study, romantic introspection, field research, or humanist
investigation. Epistemology critiques indict a method of coming to or
creating knowledge, thus undercutting the claims derived through that
method]{.underline}**. The best of these critiques will also advance an
alternative knowledge system that produces results contrary to the
claims advanced in the opponent\'s positions. GEHRKE 21 Language
critiques can be differentiated from value and epistemology critiques in
two respects. First, they focus upon communicative or interpretive
aspects of either particular word choices or the broader advocacy of
debaters. **[Language critiques indict what an advocate communicates,
intentionally or otherwise, and what others who endorse that advocacy
might communicate]{.underline}**. Debaters have called these arguments
language-linked value objections, language objections, language
critiques, advocacy critiques, advocacy-linked disadvantages, and a host
of other names. Second, **[the most controversial element that
differentiates these arguments from other objections to policy advocacy
is the claim that their implications supersede the impacts of particular
policy actions]{.underline}**. Advocates of language critiques often
claim fiat to be illusory, that language creates reality, or that
advocacy has \"real-world\" or \"in-round\" effects upon critics,
debaters, and others. For example, a language critique might argue that
an opponent has employed sexist language, such as using \"mankind\" as
an androgynous term. The team advancing the critique may argue that a
critic who fails to reject the sexist language likewise advocates using
sexist language, and consequently perpetuates and reinforces sexism in
the culture. Conversely, the policy issues debated are only fictions or
imaginations used to simulate a policy decision in the debate. In
actuality, **[when the critic votes, no policy is enacted.
Yet]{.underline}**, the critique proponents argue, **[the effects of the
language are real and immediate]{.underline}**. Thus, the debaters ask
the critic to ignore the illusory or imagined impacts of the proposed
policies and decide the debate based upon the real and immediate impacts
of language. Some critiques, such as Critical Race Theory, cross these
categories. Since Critical Race Theory indicts the American legal system
for being racist, which makes its predictive and descriptive claims
inaccurate, it combines a value critique and an epistemological
critique. Similarly, debaters sometimes combine value arguments with
language critiques to create a dual set of impacts for their positions.
With the sexism example previously discussed, the critiquing team may
add an argument that says that individuals have a moral obligation to
reject sexism when they encounter it. Thus, in addition to the language
critique of the use of the term \"mankind,\" the critiquing team would
also advance a value critique, holding that there is an obligation to
reject sexism. The distinctions between value, epistemology, and
language critiques are not always clean, and may leave out some critique
arguments. Critique argumentation is in a constant state of mutation as
debaters find new ways to think about particular issues. The
classification scheme used here should be considered functional only for
the purposes of this discussion. 22 CONTEMPORARY ARGUMENTATION AND
DEBATE One of the primary CrIticisms leveled against all such critiques
is that they fail to address policy questions (Jinks A14; Shors and
Mancuso A15; Solt, Anti-Kritik xiii; Solt, \"DemystifYing\" A9).

#### Even if you like traditional policy debate, contemporary real world policy making requires looking into the assumptions behind the actions proposed, which is an analysis only critical debate can provide. 

**Gehrke 98** (Gehrke, P.J. (1998). Critique Arguments as Policy
Analysis: Policy Debate Beyond the Rationalist Perspective. Contemporary
Argumentation and Debate, 19, 18-39./cdc)

**[Most debate theorists who oppose critique arguments
advance]{.underline}** a rationalist paradigm of policy evaluation. In
their minds, a **[strict cost-benefit analysis, particularly a
quantitative analysis based on the preservation of human life, is the
only means by which an advocate can justifY or dejustifY a
policy]{.underline}**. In his criticism of scientific models of public
policy, Robert Formaini, the former vice president for public policy at
the Cato Institute, explains the rationalist policy paradigm: According
to the policy rationalist, if the risks are \"acceptable\" and the
\"benefits\" are greater than \"costs,\" what person can argue that the
proposed policy ought not be done, and on what inductive basis? It will
not work to say that the proposed policy is \"wrong,\" \"immoral,\"
\"unjust,\" and a \"waste of time and effort.\" These arguments are
\"unscientific\" and \"value-laden\" with the citizen\'s personal,
irrational prejudices. (69) **[In policy debate, the rationalist
perspective marginalizes critiques by mistakenly representing a
particular approach to policy evaluation as the essential means of
policy deliberation, implying that one theoretical perspective is both
appropriate for all policy questions and preferable to all other means
of policy comparison]{.underline}**. Marouf Hasian and Edward Panetta
argue that \"both the promise and the peril of the critique come from
its use as a method of questioning some of the assumptions behind
\'policy\' debate itself\' (47). They continue, \"the use of \'the
critique\' in policy debate means a virtual abandonment of many of the
cherished assumptions of policy decision making\" (53). If by policy
debate and policy decision making, Hasian and Panetta are referring only
to the conventional practices of academic debate, they would be correct.
However, their criticism is not that critiques simply challenge academic
policy debate as we commonly practice it, but rather that critiques are
\"politically irrelevant and counterproductive\" (54). This conclusion
is arrived at by giving primacy to rationalist policy models, including
claims such as that \"debating is an inherently rationalistic activity\"
(54). Faith in rationalism as the core element of policy debate leads
Derek Jinks to posit that if critiques have any theoretical legitimacy,
\"they should take the form of disadvantages, counterplans, solvency
arguments, etc.\" (AI4). links argues that resolutions imply the context
for academic debates, and since contemporary resolutions are interpreted
as policy questions, they should be addressed from a policy perspective
(AI2). While this line of reasoning may bear some merit, Jinks begs the
question of whether the rationalist model is the only possible policy
perspective. Jinks relies on a rationalist cost-benefit analysis model
for decision making. He argues that policy decisions cannot be made
without comparing unique costs and benefits of proposed courses of
action (A 14). Jinks likewise contends that policy debate should begin
from a set of shared assumptions about the values at stake, which should
simply be taken as true (Al3). Matthew Shors and Steve Mancuso propose
an extreme division between critiques and policy discourse. Shorsand
Mancuso make the same error as Jinks · by generalizing from rationalist
policy models to all policy deliberation. **[They claim that critiques
are \"utterly irrelevant\" and that critiques ask us to believe that
\"it is pointless to discuss policies]{.underline}**\" (A16). Shors and
Mancuso would have us believe that critiques \"ignore policy issues
altogether\" (A16). It is because critiques do not argue unique
commensurable costs or benefits that they contend that critiques carry
\"little, if any, weight in policy comparison\" (AI6). Only by failing
to recognize the broad diversity of policy perspectives can Shors and
Mancuso come to conclude that \"the Critique is wholly incompatible
with, and non-germane to, policy debate\" (A 17). Perhaps the most
vehement opponent of critiques has been Solt. Solt makes many of the
same assumptions about policy analysis as do Jinks, Shors, and Mancuso.
Solt so strongly believes that critiques challenge the assumption that
\"what we are essentially engaged in is a policy debate\" that he
recommends the first response to critiques be to reestablish the policy
framework (\"Demystifying\" A9). For Solt, \"the kl\'itik is a
non-policy argument\" (Anti-hitik ii). He sees debate as a policy forum,
and critiques are considered not to be \"germane to the subject at
hand\" (Anli-Kl\'itik xxii). Solt argues that \"at root, the kritik
misunderstands the nature of the policy calculus\" (Anti-Kritik x:xiii).
Solt\'s rationalist assumptions are apparent in arguments encouraging us
to \"take an a priori ethical and political framework for granted\"
(\"De mystifying\" A II). Similarly, **[he ignores a whole body of
interpretive and communicative policy analysis literature when he claims
that \"ideas are more important than the rhetoric with which they are
expressed]{.underline}**\" (\"Demystifying\" All). Here, Solt is
attempting to refute language critiques by retreating to a separation of
policies and the words that express, present, and form those policies.
For So It, the policy has a pure form outside of language, and it is
that form that is to be evaluated, rather than any of the words that
might malign it. Such a position is distant from much of both
contemporary communication studies and policy studies literature. 24
CONTEMPORARY ARGUMENTATION AND DEBATE **[The arguments against critiques
advanced by the policy debate rationalists are suspect because they are
grounded in the traditions of academic debate rather than contemporary
theories of policy studies. Consequently, they dismiss questions they
can not force-fit into policy rationalism as neither worthwhile nor
relevant to policy discussions]{.underline}**. As two policy analysts
wrote of the hegemony of the rationalist paradigm, \"When all you have
is a hammer the whole world looks like a nail\" (House and Shull
163-164). Berube attacks critiques from a perspective not overtly
founded on policy rationalism, holding that critiques are fundamentally
pre-fiat arguments and that they disregard post-fiat substantive claims
(\"Criticizing\" 68-72). Nonetheless, he bases his arguments upon
similar assumptions about the relationship between critiques and policy
debate. Here, \"fiat\" is a stand-in for \"policy focus,\" in that fiat
represents an enacted policy. **[To claim that critiques disregard
issues that arise after fiat is to claim that they disregard questions
raised by enacting policies]{.underline}**. Berube\'s argument is also
**[predicated upon the assumption that academic debate should extend no
further than \"intentional, intended, naIve, objective, and rogate\"
meanings]{.underline}** (\"Criticizing\" 77). **[This means that
debaters and critics should not question any of the assumptions or
presuppositions of texts or advocacies, uncritically accepting the
premises inherent in propositions.]{.underline}** In the context of
policy analysis, Berube \'s standards require that policy advocates and
analysts not ask of each other: \"But what are your assumptions? Are
they valid, or consistent, or morally acceptable?\" This position is
extraordinarily dangerous. Wayne Booth argues that we must consider
precisely those questions texts attempt to foreclose: Each literary work
implicates within itself a set of norms about what questions are
appropriate. Hemingway, to choose a favorite example of the new feminist
critics, does not demand of us that we ask of his works, \"Is it good
for men or women to accept uncritically my machismo bravado?\" Indeed,
he seems to work quite hard to prevent our asking such a question. But
surely, the feminist critics say, and I think they are right, surely any
teacher who teaches A Farewell to Arms without inviting, somewhere along
the line, a critical consideration of Hemingway\'s heroes as human
ideals, and of his portraits of women as reflecting a peculiarly maimed
creative vision, and of his vision of the good life as a singularly
immature one-surely any such teacher is doing only half the job. (301) .
. ; GEHRKE 25 . Similarly, we might say that **[any policy debater who
does not seek a critical consideration of the questions that a policy
proposal tries to foreclose is only doing half the job of a policy
analyst.]{.underline}** Additionally, Berube assumes that we have pure
and direct knowledge of the meanings of a text. However, **[in order to
understand the meanings of a text we must interpret that text. When
advocates speak, we inevitably interpret what they say. Meanings are
found in the act of interpretation, and those meanings differ, at least
slightly, between interpretations. There is virtually no text in a
debate that can inspire one universally agreed upon
interpretation]{.underline}**. As listeners and readers, we can never
find ourselves at a point where the intentional, naive, and rogate
meanings of a text are objectively transparent to us. Determining what
questions a text invites requires interpreting the text, and these
interpretations will vary, producing contrary readings of what questions
may be asked of that text. There is no way to reconcile interpretations
objectively. In order to evaluate competing interpretations, one would
have to engage in precisely the critical textual analysis Berube
attempts to foreclose. Since every interaction with a text is
interpretive, Berube\'s objective standard for encountering a text never
can be met. While opponents of critiques might be expected to position
critiques outside of policy discussion, some advocates of critique
arguments in debate have done the same. Many · critique proponents
advance either the position that we should not consider ourselves policy
analysts (Berube, \"Kritiks\" 21), or that critiques supersede policy
questions (Bahm 76; Broda-Bahm and Murphy 21). These arguments
unwittingly lend assistance to opponents of critiques by disconnecting
critique arguments from policy discourse. Stepping outside the policy
focus is not inviting to those who hold resolutely to a policy
perspective; rationalist or otherwise. Rather, it makes it all the more
difficult to recognize the unique role critique arguments can play in
the enhancement of policy analysis and policy debate. Broda-Bahm
probably has done more to popularize language critiques than any other
theorist, but he clearly positions these arguments outside of policy
deliberation. BrodaBahm and Thomas Murphy define a critique as \"any
argument which does not provide an answer to the resolutional question\"
(21). In this context, they refer to \"the resolutional question\" not
merely as the resolution itself, but as the affirmative case which
advocates it (31 n3). They make the same assumption often used as a
premise against critiques, that we can and should separate policies from
the language that advances them. Broda-Bahm separates policy and
language by arguing that critiques do not answer substantive advocacy,
but rather focus \"more directly on the actual language practices of an
opponent\" (Bahrn 69). This is reinforced with attempts to give primacy
to the \"more immediate and more tangible\" effects of language by
claiming policy proposals to be fictions of debate rounds (Bahm 76).
While positioning critiques outside of policy discourse is a common
error amongst critique advocates, Shanahan is an exception. Much of
Shanahan\'s essay is esoteric and philosophical, but he does recognize
at least a potential for critiques to be a part of policy analysis.
Making use of literature about development assistance, Shanahan
considers \"the possibility that the kritik is policy debate\" (A8).
Shanahan was nearest the mark when he claimed that \"the kritik
supplements, not supplants current debate practice\" (A4). However,
critique proponents have either ignored or simply reiterated these
claims, and opponents of critique argumentation scoff at Shanahan\'s
conception of policy analysis. Most likely, this is because Shanahan\'s
theory is so deeply embedded in Heidegger\'s philosophy that it is
difficult to read a policy focus beneath the existential vocabulary.
This may also be because neither proponents nor opponents of critique
argumentation have considered the policy studies literature that
reinforces the need for critiques in policy discussions. **[If one truly
takes a policy perspective toward debate, one inevitably finds that
critique argumentation is a necessary element of policy
evaluation]{.underline}**. The impasse hence arises because opponents of
critiques hold that the purpose of debate is to discuss policies
exclusively, and assume that policy rationalism is the only mechanism
debaters can use to do so. Many proponents of critiques maintain the
impasse by arguing that critiques somehow supersede or exist outside of
policy argumentation. The marginalization performed by both sides of
this controversy disconnects critique argumentation from politics,
policy deliberation, and real world debates. **[To move past the impasse
and integrate critique argumentation and policy deliberation, we must
reposition critiques within the spectrum of policy
analysis.]{.underline}**

### 2NC -- Ext -- Performative sociality 

#### Narratives are a pre-req to the process of law formation -- key to counterhegemonic forms of knowledge production 

**Wharton '16 (Robin Wharton, Georgia State University, Derek Miller,
Harvard University, "New Directions in Law and Narrative", Law, Culture
and the Humanities 1--11, pp. 1-3, Accessed 7/29/18, PAS).**

This commentary assesses the state of scholarship on law and narrative
and argues for a more holistic approach to the topic. **[Narrative and
law do not encounter each other accidentally but are ineluctably
intertwined. Law is a dominant narrative form in the modern world;
narrative suffuses]{.underline}** not just testimony but **[all legal
practice. We urge scholarship that recognizes law and narrative as part
of the same socio-cultural project of making the world.]{.underline}**
At the 2015 meeting of the Modern Language Association (MLA), we
organized a roundtable on "Desire for Narrative in Law and Literature."
We solicited work that explored the various ways in which **[law not
only engages narrative, but also seems to need narrative.]{.underline}**
In other words we took as granted that **[law]{.underline}**, as Peter
Brooks has argued, **["needs narratology," and sought to explore the
diverse narratives -- and thus the multiple narratological perspectives
-- that law demands.]{.underline}** Two articles in this commentary
section originally appeared in that panel. This comment introduces those
exciting contemporary approaches to law and narrative and reflects on
the scope of the topic and its persistent importance**[. Law takes
advantage of the entire range of rhetorical and representational
possibilities available to it as a narrative form.]{.underline}** The
law does not merely involve narration -- for example, in representing
the underlying reality from which judicial or regulatory decisions
emerge. Rather, **[law is narrative, its coherence dependent upon our
collective understanding of how stories make meaning by connecting
characters and events into histories both factual and
fictional.]{.underline}** Further, as a narrative form in its own right,
like the epic or the novel, **[the law exercises considerable influence
not only over how we read other narrative forms, but also over the
stories such forms are capable of telling.]{.underline}** The two
comments gathered here, along with the other material from the MLA
panel, demonstrate both the breadth and depth of new scholarship on law
and narrative and make a case for the centrality of the law and
narrative paradigm within literary and legal studies. In an influential
PMLA article assessing law and literature, Julie Stone Peters divides
the joint study of those subjects into three phases.2 First came
"humanism," which offered literature as the antidote to the technocratic
rigor of law and economics. "Hermeneutics," swept up in deconstruction
and other literary theory, "threatened to unmoor law from its
traditional interpretive bases" of textual interpretation.3 Last but not
least comes **[narrative]{.underline}**, which **[combined the former's
concern with human agency and the latter's awareness of a text's
multiple meanings.]{.underline}** A similar tripartite division defines
the general approaches to law and narrative. Although Peters lists
narrative third in the development of law and literature, narrative
actually features prominently in the contemporary field's ur-text, James
Boyd White's The Legal Imagination from 1973. In White's chapter on
narrative, the final section of his book, he notes that [narrative draws
together and summarizes his central concerns. He suggests there that
"the central act of the legal mind, of judge and lawyer alike, is this
conversion of the raw material of life -- of the actual experiences of
people and the thousands of ways they can be talked about -- into a
story that will claim to tell the truth in legal terms."]{.underline}4
Yet law and narrative did not truly come into its own until the late
1980s. White's concern with how the minds of jurists, litigants, and
other citizens narrate their lives and their understanding of law
features prominently in that first explosion of law and narrative
scholarship that critiqued the force of storytelling in legal cases.
Writers such as Richard Delgado and Robin West hoped **[attending to
narrative would give voice to the voiceless and offer perspectives that
critiqued the hegemony of laws usually narrated by and for dead white
men.]{.underline}** Introducing the influential 1989 Michigan Law Review
symposium on law and narrative, Kim Lane Scheppele noted **[that "what
almost all the writer]{.underline}**s \[in the symposium\] **[shared was
a concern with the point of view of outsiders, those whose perspectives
had been excluded in the law's construction of an official story for the
particular case."]{.underline}**5 As Peters later summarized, **[this
work claimed "a kind of postcritical real as a viable basis for legal
ethics."]{.underline}**6 As this movement of narrative jurisprudence
firmly established itself in the early 1990s, scholars shifted their
gaze from the stories that litigants tell and those that litigation
excludes to the stories embedded in judicial decision-making. "The
stories that theorists such as \[Oliver Wendell\] Holmes, \[Lon L.\]
Fuller, and \[Ronald\] Dworkin tell are not simply ornamental; they are
central to -- they even constitute -- each writer's conception of law,"
wrote Robin West in her critique of legal narrative. **["By reading
these jurisprudential stories systematically and critically as stories,
we may achieve a richer understanding of the philosophical arguments
those anecdotes are meant to convey.]{.underline}**"7 **[Such readings
seek out narratives that do not mark themselves as such, and thus expand
the scope of narrative studies in law.]{.underline}** The 1995
conference on "Narrative and Rhetoric in the Law" at Yale's Whitney
Humanities Center summarized some of the myriad ways in which scholars
had recognized narrative's centrality to law in the preceding decade or
so.

#### Performance activism allows for new roles and rules for bodies normally excluded 

**Friedman and Holzman 12** By Dan Friedman and Lois Holzman,
"Performing the World: The Emergence of Performance Activism")

The performance turn is widely acknowledged. [**The premise that all (or
much) of** human practices are performed, that humans, through
performance, function as the active social constructors of their world
is not only embodied in the discipline of performance studies, but has
become part of the dialogue in anthropology, linguistics, ethnography,
folklore, psychology, sociology, and history.]{.underline} What is
generally less recognized, both by scholars and by political activists
themselves, is the performance turn in social activism. **[The
corruption and collapse of the Communist revolutions]{.underline}** of
the 20^th^ Century have **[called into question]{.underline}** the value
of ideology (in particular) and cognition and knowledge (in general) to
provide [**a** way out of the developmental dead ends**---pervasive
poverty, constant warfare and violence, the rapidly expanding gaps in
wealth and opportunity---that appear to have trapped
humanity.**]{.underline} Acknowledging this, a growing number of
political and social activists, community and youth organizers,
progressive and critical educators and therapists, and others **[around
the globe have been turning to performance as a way of engaging social
problems, activating communities, and experimenting with new social and
political possibilities. This shift looks different in different
cultures and political environments.  Whatever the differences, however,
the performance shift is allowing social change activists in both modern
and traditional cultures to organize not around a set of ideas, an
ideology, but to create, through performance, something new with what
exists. In our view, the performance turn has the potential to be
socially and culturally transformative/revolutionary precisely because
performance, consciously practiced in daily life, is, by its nature, a
creative social activity that allows human beings to break out of old
roles and old rules.]{.underline}**

#### Sociologists note that through performance, humans develop beyond the norms of social activism, constantly re-defining what it means to be an activist. 

**Friedman and Hotzman 12** (Dan Friedman and Lois Holzman, "Performing
the World: The Emergence of Performance Activism", pgs. 8-9)

The other direction performative inquiry takes is relating to people as
performers by studying the human activity of performing in its endless
varieties and by creating opportunities for people to perform in new
ways. For example, there are practitioners who, recognizing the
emotional and social growth that occurs when people create together
theatrically on stage, use theatrical performance techniques in
non-theatrical settings to support the expression of people's creativity
and sociality in all areas of their lives. Included here are various
nontraditional therapies, including psychodrama, social constructionist,
collaborative and narrative approaches.\[i\] There are also educators
who have made this performance turn, becoming attentive to creativity as
*socially performed* and learning itself as a creative activity. Some
relate explicitly to teaching and learning as improvisational\[ii\] and
develop performatory practices of student-teacher engagement.\[iii\]  It
is this direction of performative psychology that was taken by the
community we the authors are part of. We became convinced that
performing in new ways is key to ongoing human development, and that
ongoing human development is a necessary bi-condition of global cultural
and political transformation.\[iv\]  Our unique brand of performance
activism links performance inextricably to human and community growth
and development. PTW was born as an organizing tactic of this community,
and so we now offer a brief intellectual history of its activities.This
community of activists began by working in the poorest communities of
New York City in the 1970s and has gone on to organize middle class and
wealthy people to work with us to support poor people to develop and
provide leadership to the process of positive social change, free of
government, corporate or university dependence.  This organizing has led
to, among many other things, the development of outside of school youth
programs, a theatre, a research and training center, social therapy
practices, independent electoral campaigns and organizations on a
national, and increasingly, international stage.\[v\] In the course of
nearly four decades of this work, we have come to an understanding of
performance as a transformative, developmental activity. [We understand
performance to be the universal human capacity to be both who we are and
who we are not at the same time.  It is this ability, we believe, that
allows human beings to develop beyond instinctual and socially patterned
behavior. This understanding of performance changes the very nature of
social change activism.]{.underline} * *In coming to this
understanding/practice of performance, our organizing experience was
enriched by both Newman's training in analytical philosophy, the
philosophy of science and the foundations of mathematics under the
mentorship of Donald Davidson at Stanford University, and Holzman's
training in developmental psychology, psycholinguistics and
cultural-historical activity theory (the latter as a post-doc researcher
at Michael Cole's Laboratory of Comparative Human Cognition at
Rockefeller University)---and by the embrace by Newman, Holzman, et al
of the early methodological writings of Marx, the later writings of
Austrian philosopher Ludwig Wittgenstein, and the work of Soviet
psychologist Lev Vygotsky. From Marx we took his dialectical methodology
and insistence that human beings are not isolated individuals: ["As
society itself produces man as man, so it is produced by him. Activity
and mind are social in their content as well as in their origin: they
are social activity and social mind]{.underline}."\[vi\] Second, we took
from Marx that the transformation of the world and of ourselves as human
beings is one and the same task: "The coincidence of the changing of
circumstances and of human activity or self-changing can be conceived
and rationally understood only as revolutionary practice."\[vii\]
Revolutionary practice, we came to understand from Marx, is not so much
the organizing toward a specific goal as it is a new conception of
method, a conception of method that involves a unity of human beings and
the world we've created/are re-creating.\[viii\] From Wittgenstein, we
came to an understanding of the limitations of language, and by
extension, of ideology.  Wittgenstein, in his later work, created a
radically new method of doing philosophy, one without foundations,
premises, generalizations or abstractions.\[ix\] His work exposed "the
pathology" embedded in language and in accepted conceptions of language,
thoughts and emotions. These linguistic/philosophical pathologies
permeate everyday life and create intellectual-emotional muddles, as
people look for: causes, correspondences, rules, parallels,
generalities, theories, interpretations, explanations for our thoughts,
words and verbal deeds---even when we are not trying to or trying not
to! Getting out of these traps, we gradually concluded, required
something other than language.  It required performance.\[x\]

####  Performative scenarios are the best educational methods for real-world problems

**Gordon 98** (Rick Gordon, 7/29/18, "Balancing Real-World Problems with
Real-World Results", The Phi Delta Kappa, Vol. 79, No. 5 (Jan., 1998),
pp. 390-393, SZ)

Enthusiasm for real-world learning needs to be balanced with the
realities of real-world classrooms, Mr Gordon notes. [Through
thoughtfully designed authentic learning experiences, students can
develop the understandings, skills, and beliefs needed for
success]{.underline} in school and beyond. Mankind likes to think in
terms of extreme opposites. It is given to formulating its beliefs in
terms of Either-Ors, between which it recognizes no inter mediate
possibilities.\' [AUTHENTIC learning, real-world problems,
constructivist class rooms, performance assessment. Engaging students in
\"authentic\" performance situations seems to be the latest wave to wash
over the schools. On the surface, this is a most appealing contrast to
the decontextualized, rote learning typified by \"traditional\"
education]{.underline}. As Jacqueline Brooks and Mar tin Brooks exclaim
in describing the bene fits of constructivist classrooms, \"[They free
students from the dreariness of fact-driven curriculum and allow them to
focus on ideas; they place in students\' hands the exhilarating power to
follow trails of interests, to make connections, to reformulate ideas,
and to reach unique conclusions.\"]{.underline}2 Without doubt, the
possibilities are great and the language lofty when addressing this
latest wave. As one who comes to this movement with long experience
engaging students in real-world problems, I feel that it is important to
warn against the all-too-familiar tendency in education to be enamored
with new ideas while losing sight of the grounded perspective needed to
make things work in real classrooms with real students. The program I
work with, Education by Design/Critical Skills (EBD/CS), pioneered
\"Learning by Real Problems\"\~ in the early 1980s. Directed to come up
with educational practices that would allow children to develop the
knowledge and skills needed for success in school and beyond, EBD/CS
originally focused exclusively on real-life problems. In six-week summer
institutes, teachers were [engaged in real world problems so that they
could directly experience the power of this mode of
learning.]{.underline} The response to this approach was consistent -
participants found it to be among the most compelling learning
experiences of their lives; they felt engaged, challenged, energized,
and overwhelmed. It was this last factor that proved most problematic.
How Realistic Is Real? Real-world problems, by their nature, are messy -
involving uncertainty, complexity, and nuanced judgment.3 These
characteristics tend to clash with the norms that are prevalent in most
schools. Real world problems often don\'t mesh well with mandated
curricula, textbooks, standardized tests, state standards, and the seven
period day. Teachers who actually tried using real-world problems with
their students tended to be those renegades who thrive on change and
risk-taking. A more typical response of institute participants was that,
while they found the summer experience invigorating, they were daunted
by the prospect of attempting to implement this approach in their class
rooms. Where would they find resources? How would they assess student
work? What would parents and administrators say? Finally, there was the
omnipresent concern about \"covering\" the curriculum and ensuring
students\' exposure to the content at the heart of a teacher\'s subject
area. For many teachers, real-life problems, despite their promise,
seemed incompatible with classroom realities. Stepping Back to Step
Forward As a program, we have stepped back from this solitary focus on
real-world problems to consider what are the essential elements of
\"authentic\" learning. What is it about real-life problems that make
them powerful and engaging, and how can this be re-created in an
environment, such as the classroom itself, that often has relatively
loose ties to the \"real world\"? Here is what we have found. 1.
[Authentic learning demands that students actively solve
problems]{.underline}. Life involves an ongoing series of problems to
solve, decisions to make, concepts to understand, and products to
produce. Whether it\'s a relatively simple matter of deciding what to
eat for breakfast or a more complex one such as figuring out how to
reduce pollution in one\'s community[, in life we make decisions and do
things that have concrete results]{.underline}. Very few of us do
worksheets. 2. In authentic learning situations, people work together.
There are not the artificial boundaries of what some call the
\"graveyard model of teaching\" (everyone in rows and dead). Students
move about, talk to one another, and are active both physically and
mentally. They find resources to help solve problems - whether they be
fellow students, books, or the Internet. The focus is not just on what
you have stored inside your head but on what you can actually do to
solve a problem using the resources around you. 3[. Authentic learning
situations simultaneously involve one\'s knowledge, skills, and
attitudes. In real-life situations, you use your organizational skills
to manage resources to make decisions about how to solve problems using
the knowledge you possess to produce a result that meets your
internalized sense of quality. Knowledge, skills, and attitudes are
developed in the context of actual work.]{.underline} 4. Authentic
learning is driven by \"essential knowledge\" that is meaningful to
students. Not every element of student work must be \"real,\" but
meaning for students entails seeing connections to the real world on
some level. This relevance is best ensured by tying student work to the
\"big\" questions, what Ernest Boyer called the \"human
commonalities.\"4 These questions get to the heart of our culture,
history, and future as they relate to the human life cycle; our command
of symbols; our understanding of the social web; our connection to
science, technology, and the natural world; and the interdependence of
community and the individual. Likewise, [attention to real-life skills,
such as decision making and problem solving, can link students\' work to
real-life experience]{.underline}. 5. In authentic learning
environments, activities are connected. Knowledge, skills, and attitudes
learned and employed in one context carry over to another. The
curriculum looks less like a compilation of discrete building blocks and
more like a continuous ascending spiral in which each experience builds
on previous ones as students increase their understanding and improve
their skills. 6. [In authentic learning situations, students publicly
exhibit their learning, and there are often real-life standards of
quality]{.underline}. Authentic problems don\'t generate scores on a
test. There is usually some authentic benchmark instead to which
students are accountable. For example, if students make a proposal to
the town council, the council responds and perhaps approves it. If
students are making a product - such as a poster, play, or mural - there
are models of excellence against which the product can be judged.
[Exhibiting one\'s work publicly places it up against these real world
standards of quality.]{.underline} [The purpose of listing these
features of authentic learning experiences is to make clear that they
are achievable in regular classroom settings]{.underline}. [While it may
be true that the most authentic context is the real world beyond the
school-yard fence, there are reasonable approximations that can be
created in the classroom to offer students the same level of engagement,
meaning, and learning on a consistent basis]{.underline}. Making
Learning Authentic [The framework that guides the creation of authentic
learning in all settings is the experiential learning cycle (ELC). This
model offers an approach to make \"smaller\" learning activities more
authentic and to make \"messier\" real-life problems more
focused.]{.underline} At the heart of the ELC are what we call
challenges or problems to solve, which are driven by desired outcomes -
what we want students to know, do, and be like (knowledge, skills, and
attitudes). To help make challenges accessible to teachers and students,
we categorize them on three levels of generally increasing authenticity,
complexity, uncertainty, and student self direction. 1. Academic
challenges. [These activities provide an entry point into authentic,
problem-based learning]{.underline}. An academic challenge is student
work structured as a problem arising directly from an area of study (see
sidebar, part 1). It is used primarily to promote greater understanding
of selected subject matter. The academic challenge is crafted by
transforming existing curricular material into a problem format.
Academic challenges tend to look fairly familiar to teachers and
students accustomed to traditional educational environments. They serve
as a useful access point for developing a capacity for actively con
structing learning, working collaboratively, targeting specific
outcomes, focusing on standards of quality, and grappling with essential
questions. 2. Scenario challenges. [These challenges cast students in
real-life roles and ask them to perform these roles in the context of a
reality-based or fictional scenario]{.underline} (see sidebar, part 2).
[The scenario challenge simulates many of the elements of the real world
as a way of working with existing curricular material.]{.underline}
[Students begin to see themselves in real-life roles as they develop the
knowledge and skills needed for success in school and
beyond]{.underline}. 3. [Real-life problems. These are actual problems
in need of real solutions by real people or organizations]{.underline}
(see sidebar, part 3[). They involve students directly and deeply in the
exploration of an area of study. And the solutions have the potential
for actual implementation at the class room, school, community,
regional, nation al, or global level. Through real-life problems,
students move outside the classroom, take action on issues, and have a
tangible impact in their communities]{.underline}. These assignments can
be powerful learning experiences, but pulling off more than one or two
of them a year seems to be beyond the resources (energy, time, and
money) of most teachers and schools. [Moreover, for students to succeed
with real-life problems, it helps if they have experience working in
collaborative problem-solving teams.]{.underline} The skills and
attitudes of collaborative problem solving are best developed through
coordinated work on problems of increasing complexity and uncertalnty
(such as academic and scenario challenges). The ELC includes both
student and teacher dimensions. The student phases of the cycle are
engagement, exhibition, and reflection. [First, students are engaged in
a problem that has been crafted by the teacher to target specific
knowledge, skills, and attitudes. This challenge, as do many real-life
problems, usually requires some concrete product as evidence of student
learning. During the engagement phase, students and teachers spend time
articulating standards, based on real-world models, for the quality of
the product]{.underline}. In the course of engagement, and in the
exhibition of this product, students demonstrate their learning. After
completion and exhibition of their products, the students are not
\"done\" with their learning. Students participate in the reflection
phase, in which they examine their work and reflect on what they have
learned (reinforcing and constructing knowledge and considering their
personal and interpersonal behaviors). Students may then join the
teacher in assessment of their work based on their pre-established
standards of quality. The teacher-led phases of the cycle are design,
coaching, and feedback. Once the students have begun work on the problem
that has been carefully designed by the teacher to target specific
knowledge, skills, and attitudes, the teacher assumes the role of coach.
As coach, he or she helps students to develop their skills and
knowledge, shape their strategies, and find ap propriate resources. Like
a coach, however, the teacher remains on the sidelines at times,
allowing students to own their successes and failures. Here, the
students are truly the workers, and the quality of their work reflects
their efforts. [In the feedback phase, teachers create structures with
in which students can reflect on and assess their products, processes,
and level of understanding.]{.underline} Finally, this learning
experience is connected to subsequent experiences as students move into
the housekeeping phase, in which they consider what they learned and
what they need in order to proceed. They articulate what they might do
better next time and address skills and knowledge they need to develop
further as they move on to other challenges. Notably, they also give
consideration to the status and needs of their learning community. [They
address issues that arose during their work and develop strategies for
future work to improve the learning of their community.]{.underline} In
short, the classroom is structured so that students are given a
meaningful con text for interdependent work throughout the learning
cycle. Purposes and processes are made explicit, and students understand
what they are doing, why they are doing it, and how it relates to work
in school and outside. Experiences are organized to build on one
another, so that, as we do in the real world, students can learn from
their successes and failures and carry these les sons with them to their
future work. Most important, the work of the classroom consistently
demands that students authentically exhibit their knowledge, skills, and
attitudes throughout the learning cycle instead of only during a
scheduled performance. Bridging School And the Real World Authentic
learning is a laudable goal that should be promoted and pursued
vigorously. Students not only should see their work in school related to
the real world but must see it that way, if they are to be able to apply
their learning in real-life con texts. As we pursue this goal, however,
our experience warns us to remain grounded in the realities of
teachers\' and students\' school lives. Working with real-life problems
is a sophisticated process that demands refined skills and a tolerance
for ambiguity and complexity. While only some teachers and students have
an innate capacity for such undertakings, almost all teachers and
students can develop such capacity. Designing challenges to develop the
understandings, skills, and beliefs necessary to be successful with
real-life problems involves a commitment to authentic learning
experiences of increasing sophistication. The experiential learning
cycle and the combination of academic, scenario, and real-life
challenges provides a blueprint to connect the vision of real-world
learning to the realization of authentic student results.

### 2NC -- Ext -- Narrativization/Story Telling 

#### Story telling is key to combat objective v. subjective knowledge. 

#### **Delgado 89**, Richard Delgado, Storytelling for Oppositionists and Others: A Plea for Narrative, 87 MICH. L. REV. 2411 (1989) \[hereinafter Oppositionists\]; Pierre Schlag, Normative and Nowhere To Go, 43 STAN. L. REV. 167 (1990); EC

[Underlying these stylized debates about subjective versus objective
standards is a well-hidden issue of cultural powe**r, one neatly
concealed by elaborate arguments that predictably invoke predictable
\"principle.\"**]{.underline}**2 5 These arguments invite us to take
sides for or against abstract values that lie on either side of a
well-worn analytical divide, having remarkably little to do with what is
at stake. [The arguments mystify and sidetrack, rendering us helpless in
the face of powerful repeat players like corporations, human
experimenters, actiort-loving surgeons, and sexually aggressive
men.]{.underline}26 How does this happen? [Notice that in many cases it
is the stronger party-the tobacco company, surgeon, or male date-that
wants to apply an objective standard to a key event.2 7 The doctor wants
the law to require disclosure only of the risks and benefits the average
patient would find material.28 The male partygoer wants the law to
ignore the woman\'s subjective thoughts in favor of her outward
manifestations]{.underline}.2 9 The tobacco company wants the warning on
the package to be a stopper. Generally, the law complies. What explains
the stronger party\'s preference for an objective approach, and the
other\'s demand for a more personalized one? It is not that one approach
is more principled, more just, or even more likely to produce a certain
result than the other. Rather, in my opinion, [the answer lies in issues
of power and culture. It is now almost a commonplace that we construct
the social world.30 We do this through stories, narratives, myths, and
symbols-by using tools that create images, categories, and pictures.3 1
Over time, through repetition, the dominant stories seem to become true
and natural, and are accepted as \"the way things are.\"32 Recently,
outsider jurisprudence33 has been developing means, principally
\"counterstorytelling,\" to displace or overturn these comfortable
majoritarian myths and narratives.]{.underline}3 4 A well-told
counterstory can jar or displace the dominant account.35 [The debate on
objective and subjective standards touches on these issues of
world-making and the social construction of reality]{.underline}.
Powerful actors, such as tobacco companies and male dates, want
objective standards applied to them simply because these standards
always, and already, reflect them and their culture. These actors have
been in power; their subjectivity long ago was deemed \"objective\" and
imposed on the world.3 6 Now their ideas about meaning, action, and
fairness are built into our culture, into our view of malefemale,
doctor-patient, and manufacturer-consumer relations.**

#### Narratives threaten the hegemonic nature of the state- keeping a singular narrative of the state is key to cohesion 

**Wharton '16 (Robin Wharton, Georgia State University, Derek Miller,
Harvard University, "New Directions in Law and Narrative", Law, Culture
and the Humanities 1--11, pp. 3-5, Accessed 7/29/18, PAS).**

With contributors ranging from Martha Minow and Catherine McKinnon to
Elaine Scarry and John Hollander, the volume on Law's Stories produced
from that conference probed legal narrative as a political force, as
constructed in trials, as confession or victim impact statement, and as
it appeared in judicial opinions.8 So rich had the dialogue about
narrative become that when Richard Posner revised his heavily critical
monograph Law & Literature in 1998, he devoted an entire chapter to
narrative, a subject that did not merit an index entry a decade
earlier.9 Peter Brooks, one of the editors of the Yale conference
volume, developed a robust critique of law's persistent repression of
narrative. Brooks argued that **[the law resists narratology because
narrative fundamentally threatens law's hermeticism. "Law's suspicion of
narrative \[reveals\] its implicit awareness that in certain cases
letting narrative breach the bar of repression would risk a veritable
deconstruction of all the legal argumentation -- a massive housewrecking
of judicial rhetoric-as-usual,"]{.underline}** Brooks writes.10 For
instance, Brooks suggests that Fourth Amendment **[jurisprudence about
"inevitable discovery" exemptions to the exclusionary rule reveal how
the law relies on "retrospectivity" to justify its
outcomes.]{.underline}** In such examples the known result of an
otherwise illicit search structures the narrative courts hypothesize in
determining the forbidden item's discovery "inevitable" and thus
permissible[. A proper understanding of how narrative structures itself
around endings might]{.underline}, in Brooks' view, [reshape such
tendencies in Fourth Amendment law]{.underline}. Whatever the utopian
desires implicit in Brooks' analysis, **[narrative here clearly means
more than only testimony or confession]{.underline}** (on which Brooks
has also written extensively).11 **[Narrative exists in more than the
stories told in the courtroom or summarized in judicial opinions:
narrative suffuses all of legal practice.]{.underline}** Bernard S.
Jackson had made precisely this argument in his 1988 book, Law, Fact,
and Narrative Coherence. Jackson, writing from a Greimasian semiotic
perspective, urged that we read not only the explicit narratives related
at trial, but also the narratives of the trial itself. The latter, the
"story of the trial," as distinguished from the "story (told) in the
trial," "is as much subject to the constraints of narrative coherence as
is" the former, Jackson writes.12 Jackson calls his analytic method the
"narrativisation of pragmatics," in which the actions of the trial's
participants meet our demands for narrative coherence as fully as must
the competing narratives offered by the trial's opposing parties. The
trial process itself is a complex of pragmatic interactions each one of
which individually, and all of which collectively, are themselves
discursive constructions, their very intelligibility depending upon
their character as such. For not only is the "evidence" judged in the
light of narrative frameworks of typical social action; the behaviour of
participants -- and particularly the lawyers -- is judged in the light
of narrative frameworks of typical legal action: how counsel behaves in
a particular context, how the judge behaves, how the jury behaves,
etc.13 **[By recognizing narrative as fundamental to humans'
understanding of the world]{.underline}**, Jackson sees **[that we
narrativize every aspect of the law, not only those that we might name
"stories." Three major intertwining strands thus thread through law and
narrative.]{.underline}** The first strand concerns itself with
storytelling such as in witness testimony, asking questions about who
speaks and what stories get told. The second strand considers how legal
opinions narrativize their own logic and tidy the narratives presented
as evidence. And the third (and seemingly least developed) strand
considers narratives of the law that constrain and define the
possibilities of legal practice. In any of those forms, **[narrative
suffuses law because law is a human activity that, like all other human
endeavors, we narrativize so as to make comprehensible.]{.underline}**

### 2NC -- Ext -- Artistic Expressio

#### Cultural expressions of art through performances are viewed as a way to further localize and accentuate better resistance from a social group.

**Hughes and Déa 12** (Jennifer Scheper Hughes and Ariane Dalla Déa,

Performance in the New Global Context)

**[Social movements employing art and performance as a means of

appeal to an authentic and decommodified expression of hip-hop. She sees
[hip-hop in Cuba]{.underline} as a prime example of the appropriation,
replication, and reconfiguration of globalized art to express local
histories. Furthermore, she argues that the artists in her study
consciously choose hip-hop at [the primary medium for the social
critique]{.underline}. With state support, Cuban **[hip-hop has emerged

### 2NC -- Ext - Activism General

#### Youth activism empowers people disenfranchised by poverty 

**Ballard and Ozard 16** (Jahromi) Ballard, Parissa & Ozer, Emily.
(2016). Implications of Youth Activism for Health and Well-Being.)

Youth activism and adolescent health. Adolescent health is
multi-dimensional. **[For our purpose of linking youth activism with
health and well-being, we are concerned with three aspects of adolescent
health: mental health and psychological well-being, physical health, and
health behaviors. As described further below, activism has been linked
with indicators of mental health such as self-esteem, empowerment, and
self-confidence.]{.underline}** Volunteerism has been linked to physical
health among adolescents, bringing up the intriguing possibility that
**[certain types of engagement with communities can promote physical
health]{.underline}**, although there is not yet evidence 4 linking
activism and physical health. Finally, **[activism aims to provide youth
with a sense of purpose and a chance to make meaningful community
contributions, which can have implications for positive health
behaviors]{.underline}**. For these reasons, the review below includes
studies that focus on these three types of health and well-being
outcomes. There are troubling disparities in both adolescent health and
levels of youth civic engagement across socioeconomic and racial/ethnic
lines. On average**[, youth of color and adolescents from lower
socioeconomic backgrounds have poorer health status, measured by markers
such as disease (e.g., HIV/AIDS), some indicators of behavioral health
(homicide, dating violence, unintended pregnancies), as well as access
to health services]{.underline}** (National Association of Social
Workers, 2001; Newacheck, Hung, Park, Brindis, & Irwin, 2003). **[At the
same time, youth of color and adolescents from lower socioeconomic
backgrounds are presented with fewer opportunities for high quality
civic engagement (]{.underline}**Kahne & Middaugh, 2008; Levinson,
2010). We submit that **[these are not unrelated phenomena, but rather,
that the structural realities of socioeconomic hardship and the related
opportunity gaps in the US underlie both health and civic disparities.
Youth activism can provide a path for young people to lobby for
necessary structural changes that might improve community health, while
potentially experiencing health benefits of empowerment during the
process. Thus, youth activism has the dual potential to affect youth and
community health positively]{.underline}** (Ballard & Syme, 2015). Given
the theoretical importance of civic engagement for healthy adolescent
development and the disparities in youth civic participation, there has
been surprisingly little systematic research on the role of activism for
youth health and well-being. Although most youth researchers and
practitioners share an assumption that youth activism is beneficial for
youth, it is important to provide evidence supporting or challenging
this assumption. At a time when youth activism is on the rise as new
technologies enable new forms of activism (Kahne, Middaugh, & Allen,
2014), we ask: What does activism mean for healthy youth development?

### 2NC -- Ext -- Active Education

#### They only focus on creating change based on personal gain, not taking into account the experiences of those who will be affected by this change. Activist education is the best mode of debate -- it is inherently more inclusive and allows the state to be checked by its people.

**Young 01** (Iris Marion Young, "Activist Challenges to Deliberative
Democracy", pg. 675-678,
https://www.jstor.org/stable/pdf/3072534.pdf?refreqid=search%3Acf3fd94d9aec2b5a5dd03705b742f9bc)

The deliberative democrat might claim that the stance of the activist is
unreasonable. Reasonable political engagement, on this account, consists
of the willingness to listen to those whom one believes is wrong, to
demand reasons from them, and to give arguments aimed at persuading them
to change their views. For the most part, the activist declines so to
engage persons he disagrees with. Rather than on reason, according to
this deliberative democrat, the activist relies on emotional appeal,
slogans, irony, and disruptive tactics to protest and make his claims.
It is common in the political life of many democracies thus to label an
activist stance unreasonable and even \"extremist.\" One can interpret
such blanket labeling itself as a power ploy whose function is to rule
out of bounds all claims that question something basic about existing
institutions and the terms in which they put political alternatives. It
is important, therefore, to consider the activist answer to the charge
of being an irrational extremist: it relies on far too narrow an
understanding of what is reasonable***.* [By \"reasonable\" here, I mean
having a sense of a range of alternatives in belief and action and
engaging in considered judgment in deciding among them. The reasonable
person thus is also able and willing to justify his or her claims and
actions to others. As I have constructed the stance of the activist, he
is principled and reasonable in this sense. He reflects on some of the
wrongs that come to people and nonhuman things and has an account of
some of the social causes of those wrongs that he believes are
alterable]{.underline}**. He considers alternative means for bringing
attention to those wrongs and calling on others to help redress them,
and he is usually quite prepared to justify the use of specific means on
specific occasions, both to his comrades and to others, such as
television reporter[*s.* **While his principles often lead him to
protest outside of or disrupt the meetings of powerful people with whom
he disagrees, one of his primary reasons for such protest is to make a
wider public aware of institutional wrongs and persuade that public to
join him in pressuring for change in the institutions.**]{.underline}
[While not deliberative, then, in the sense of engaging in orderly
reason giving, most activist political engagements aim to communicate
specific ideas to a wide public. They use slogans, humor, and irony to
do so because discursive arguments alone are not likely to command
attention or inspire action]{.underline}**.** In the real world of
politics, some nihilistic and destructive persons demonstrate and
protest from blind rage or because they get pleasure from destruction.
Such a nihilistic stance describes few activists, however; activists are
often more self-conscious than other political actors about having good
reasons for what they do and disciplining their fellows to follow rules
in their collective actions. The common rhetorical move of official
powers to paint all protest action with the tar of \"extremism\" should
be resisted by anyone committed to social justice and reasonable
communication. Now that the activist has answered the deliberative
democrat\'s suspicion that he is not worth talking to, we can hear his
criticism of deliberative recommendations for political engagement and
citizen virtue. I will present these challenges in four steps, giving
the deliberative democrat the opportunity to respond to each. Exhorting
citizens to engage in respectful argument with others they disagree with
is a fine recommendation for the ideal world that the deliberative
democrat theorizes, says the activist, where everyone is included and
the political equal of one another. This is not the real world of
politics, however, where powerful elites representing structurally
dominant social segments have significant influence over political
processes and decisions Deliberation sometimes occurs in this real
world. Officials and dignitaries meet all the time to hammer out
agreements. Their meetings are usually well organized with structured
procedures, and those who know the rules are often able to further their
objectives through them by presenting proposals and giving reasons for
them, which are considered and critically evaluated by the others, who
give their own reasons. **[Deliberation, the activist says, is an
activity of boardrooms and congressional committees and sometimes even
parliaments. Elites exert their power partly through managing
deliberative settings]{.underline}*.*** Among themselves [they engage in
debate about the policies that will sustain their power and further
their collective interests. Entrance]{.underline} into such deliberative
settings [is usually]{.underline} rather [tightly
controlled]{.underline}, **[and the interests of many affected by the
decisions made in them often receive no voice or
representation.]{.underline}** The proceedings of these meetings,
moreover, are often not open to general observation, and often they
leave no public record. Observers and members of the press come only by
invitation. Deliberation is primarily an activity of political elites
who treat one another with cordial respect and try to work out their
differences. Insofar as **[deliberation is exclusive in this way, and
insofar as the decisions reached in such deliberative bodies support and
perpetuate structural inequality]{.underline}** or otherwise have unjust
and harmful consequences, says the activist, then it is wrong to
prescribe deliberation for good citizens committed to furthering social
justice. [Under these circumstances of structural inequality and
exclusive power, good citizens should be protesting outside these
meetings, calling public attention to the assumptions made in them, the
control exercised, and the resulting limitations or wrongs of their
outcomes.]{.underline} They should use the power of shame and exposure
to pressure deliberators to widen their agenda and include attention to
more interests. As long as the proceedings exercise exclusive power for
the sake of the interests of elites and against the interests of most
citizens, then politically engaged citizens who care about justice and
environmental preservation are justified even in taking actions aimed at
preventing or disrupting the deliberations. Many of the thousands who
filled the streets of Seattle in December 1999, it seems to me, assumed
just this account of the relation between deliberation and protest.
Heads of state or other high officials came from all over the world to a
meeting of the World Trade Organization (WTO) to deliberate and try to
agree on a new round of global trade rules. Protestors criticized the
meeting, and many thought it should simply be stopped. They protested
the exclusive methods of the WTO, that the proceedings of its commission
are closed, and that the Seattle meeting itself was not public. They
claimed that the WTO is a tool of transnational corporate power and that
its deliberations give little attention to the effects of the free trade
regime on average citizens, especially the world\'s poorest people. The
deliberations of the WTO are not legitimate, and the agenda of the
organization is morally wrong. As I write this, some of my fellow
citizens prepare to protest similar deliberations on agreement for free
trade in the Americas. Not only are the meetings exclusive, but even the
document they will discuss is not public. There is no alternative to
protest and disruption, the activist thinks, when decisions affecting so
many people are made by so few and almost in secret. The advocate of
deliberative democracy as a prescription for political processes and the
behavior of good citizens has an easy answer to this criticism of
deliberation. She agrees with many things the activist says. Insofar as
[the proceedings of elite meetings are exclusive and nonpublic, they are
not democratic, even if they are deliberative.]{.underline} The norms of
deliberative democracy call not only for discussion among parties who
use the force of argument alone and treat each other as equals. They
also require publicity, accountability, and inclusion.4 [**To be
democratically legitimate, policies and actions decided on by means of
deliberation ought to include representation of all affected interests
and perspectives.** The deliberations of such inclusively representative
bodies ought to be public in every way]{.underline}**.** The people who
speak and vote in such deliberative settings, finally, ought to be
accountable to their fellow citizens for their opinions and decisions.
The deliberative democrat will likely join the activist to protest
outside exclusive and private deliberations. She exhorts the activist to
join her call for deliberations whose proceedings are public,
accountable, and inclusive, and she allies with the activist in
regarding deliberative processes as illegitimate unless they meet these
conditions. She may consider [activist protest a healthy means of
deepening democracy, of creating open and inclusive settings of
deliberative democracy.]{.underline}

#### Activist Education Helps Social and Political Change

**Niblett 15** -- (Blair Niblett Ph.D. in Education, "Narrating activist
education: teachers' stories of affecting social and political change",
Lakehead University,
https://knowledgecommons.lakeheadu.ca/handle/2453/604)

The project was undertaken in order to gain a deeper understanding of
the conceptual and practical relationships between education and
activism. [Of particular concern is how teachers perceive this landscape
from social, cultural, political, and pedagogical
perspectives.]{.underline} Underpinning this research is a
presupposition that education has the potential to create a less
oppressive and more socially just world. Methodologically informed by
narrative inquiry, ten participants were interviewed using a
semi-‐structured interview format that encouraged story telling. The
approach to the interviews was based in an understanding of stories as
fluid and organic organisms. Deleuze and Guattari's (1987) notion of
concepts as rhizomes was helpful in theorizing this approach.
Participants were encouraged to share stories of their experiences as
activist educators, the transcripts of each were parsed for relevant
stories, following McCormack's (2000a, b) multiple lenses approach, and
then curated into an experience narrative for each participant. Three
meaningful rhizomes were discerned from the body of experience
narratives. [Analysis of stories indicated that activist education may
be understood as socially, politically, and pedagogically
oriented.]{.underline} Social elements have to do with human relations,
how people treat each other, and how they learn these ideas through
education. Political elements refer to normative dimensions of activism
and education: what decisions should be made in order to live well? Who
should be included in making these decisions, and who is excluded?
[Pedagogical elements reflect the importance of experiences as vehicles
for learning, and the potential for activism to be a source of rich
learning experiences.]{.underline} These three strands are not strictly
independent, but rather are intricately intertwined, and even
chameleonic at times; that is to say that activist education may be
social at one moment, but transform into something more political or
pedagogical at another moment according to the needs of the teachers and
students and the contexts in which they find themselves[. The findings
of this work are significant both for teachers who identify as activist
educators, teachers who do not immediately see themselves as activist
educators but who are interested in anti-‐oppressive and social justice
education, and others who are interested in social justice and
anti-‐oppressive education.]{.underline} The stories shared by the ten
participants in this research illustrate a broad range of activist
education approaches that range from simple and politically safe, to
complex and politically contentious. [Readers of the participants'
stories and accompanying theorizing have an opportunity to better
understand ways that education, as a process that changes students and
teachers, can play a role in social change both in schools and the
societies and cultures in which they are situated.]{.underline}

### 2NC -- Ext - Activism in debate

#### Organized Debate Can Be a Tool For Activism -- But Not Without a Critical Self-Reflection of its Elitist Roots

**Zhang, Amanda**. "Organized Debate Can Be a Tool For Activism - But
Not Without a Critical Self-Reflection of Its Elitist Roots." *The
Madison Times*, 12 Nov. 2015,

**[High School debate is prized as an intellectual activity for
politically engaged young people.]{.underline}** Each tournament often
begins with a commencement speech by some important **[person or other
who makes the claim that those of us participating will be the future
leaders of the world.]{.underline}** Advertisements hung throughout high
schools tout the fact a that a numerous number of famous political
officials and academics have participated in some form of formal debate
education and competition and in fact, the claim is genuine. A large
number of important political and social leaders have indeed
participated in formal competitive debating when they were in high
school or college. For **[those who aren't as familiar with the
activity, it works like this: there a few different types of categories
of competitive debate ranging from individual to partner to
group]{.underline}** events with different focuses on policy making
skills, research, philosophical rhetoric, or presentation. Each month or
year, depending on the category of debate, the National Speech and
Debate Association assigns an official national topic often in the form
of a resolved clause. For the months of September and October the
resolution was "Resolved, The US Federal government ought to pay
reparations to African Americans." Competitors are then expected to come
up with both a pro and con position on the resolution and debate both
positions against other teams. Unsurprisingly, **[national level
competitive debate functions as a mirror microcosm of the greater
political climate of the United States. As future leaders of the world,
those who are able to compete in national-level competition are often
those who are affluent or come from wealthy schools. More
disconcertingly, those who win and do well, much like the real world,
are almost always wealthy white men.]{.underline}** Wealth plays a
significant determinant of success as debate is an often times
ridiculous expensive activity with many students paying up to a thousand
dollars a year to compete at national tournaments across the country**[.
Individual costs are only mitigated by large debate endowments that are
only usually seen in extremely wealthy schools.]{.underline}** Moreover,
there is an advantage to those whose families can afford to send their
children to debate camps over the summer with the cost of an average
debate camp ranging from 2,000 to over 5,000 dollars. There have been
some [efforts to equalize the playing field for those who can not afford
camps such as creating an open evidence project.]{.underline}
Originally, only those who were able to go to camp would have access to
curated files of evidence that were an unbeatable advantage in
competition. In the debate documentary Resolved director Greg Whiteley
follows around two different teams: one affluent and white the other
poor and black in which the differences and **[advantages posed by
wealth and perception lend to competitors. It is within this climate of
elitism and dated preference that thousands of wealthy white debaters
across the country were discussing the topic of African American
reparations.]{.underline}** Recently, Bryan Stevenson, author of Just
Mercy, came to UW Madison to speak on issues of racism within the
criminal justice system. Throughout his speech he focused his efforts on
conveying to the audience that proximity -- that is, getting close to
the problems you are passionate about -- is essential in building good
advocacy as an ally to disadvantaged communities. Within academia there
is a rift between, on the one hand, academics who theorize and write
**[scholarship regarding privilege and oppression, but are not directly
impacted by the oppression; and those who write from actual lived
experiences of oppression. High school debate is one of the earliest
forms of the former, the 'armchair activist.' Oftentimes, debaters value
a topic only to the extent that they can win a tournament and forget
that the advocacy they espouse can genuinely impact the communities they
talk about. Surely, this is not the case for every student who
participates in high school debate, however, it is true for the vast
majority. Debate is an extraordinarily valuable form of intellectual
engagement and is especially vital for young people to develop their
skills in rhetoric and argumentation.]{.underline}** However, as an
institution, unless there is a shift in the idea that competition is
more valuable than learning the skills to impact the real world, debate
will continue to simply be an application-boosting extracurricular that
won't make the world a better place.

**Debate is a key space for us to engage in discourse through its
accessibility to teach us how to engage in social and political
actions.**

An Inward Glance: A Response To Mitchell\'s Outward Activist Turn,\"
[[http://www.wfu.edu/Student-organizations/debate/MiscSites/DRGArticles/Coverstone1995China.htm
  EC]{.underline}](http://www.wfu.edu/Student-organizations/debate/MiscSites/DRGArticles/Coverstone1995China.htm)

Mitchell\'s argument underestimates the nature of academic debate in
three ways. [First, **debate trains students in the very skills required
for navigation in the public sphere of the information
age.**]{.underline} [In the past, political discourse was controlled by
those elements who controlled access to information.]{.underline} While
this basic reality will continue in the future, its essential features
will change[. **No longer will mere possession of information determine
control of political life**.]{.underline} Information is widely
available. For the first time in human history we face the prospect of
an entirely new threat. The risk of an information overload is already
shifting control of political discourse to superior information
managers. It is no longer possible to control political discourse by
limiting access to information. Instead, control belongs to those who
are capable of identifying and delivering bits of information to a
thirsty public. Mitchell calls this the \"desertification of the public
sphere.\" [The public senses a deep desire for the ability to manage the
information around them. Yet, they are unsure how to process and make
sense of it all. In this environment, snake charmers and charlatans
abound.]{.underline} The popularity of the evening news wanes as more
and more information becomes available. People realize that these half
hour glimpses at the news do not even come close to covering all
available information. They desperately want to select information for
themselves. So they watch CNN until they fall asleep. Gavel to gavel
coverage of political events assumes top spots on the Nielsen charts.
Desperate to decide for themselves, the public of the twenty-first
century drinks deeply from the well of information. When they are
finished, they find they are no more able to decide. Those who make
decisions are envied and glorified. **[Debate teaches individual
decision-making for the information age. No other academic activity
available today teaches people more about information gathering,
assessment, selection, and delivery. Most importantly, debate teaches
individuals how to make and defend their own decisions.]{.underline}**
Debate is the only academic activity that moves at the speed of the
information age. Time is required for individuals to achieve escape
velocity. Academic debate holds tremendous value as a space for
training. Mitchell\'s reflections are necessarily more accurate in his
own situation. Over a decade of debate has well positioned him to
participate actively and directly in the political process. Yet the
skills he has did not develop overnight. [Proper training requires time.
While there is a tremendous variation in the amount of training required
for effective navigation of the public sphere, the relative isolation of
academic debate is one of its virtues. **Instead of turning students of
debate immediately outward, we should be encouraging more to enter the
oasis. A thirsty public, drunk on the product of anyone who claims a
decision, needs to drink from the pool of decision-making skills.

**Activism in debate is key to opening discussion about the space and
empowering excluded voices in debate**

**Eisenberg  2012**

(Stephanie Esienberg "Speaking from the Margins: Negotiating barriers to
women's\
participation and success in policy debate" San Francisco State.)

Particular types of argument choices may affect the way participants
experience a debate round. For example, [debaters may experience some
pushback to some of the arguments they wish to speak about in debate,
especially if they are trying to integrating personal
experiences]{.underline} into their argument. For example, Akila
explains that [debaters tend to treat each other as if it is a race to
the bottom, where the ballot is the only thing that
matters]{.underline}. [Judy notes that this norm of the community to
place emphasis on competitive success allows people to justify arguments
that are reprehensible or "not okay."]{.underline} Akila highlights
several examples of teams who will justify racism, sexism and
imperialism as appropriate side effects of advocacies that claim to save
the lives of many people from potential nuclear war scenarios
constructed through a lens of political realism. Ivana notes that
externalized logic, large body counts and phallic weapons are privileged
over personal experience or "your own body." Akila feels that debaters
don't place an emphasis on trying to relate to one another, and feels
that debate isn't an alternative space where students are encouraged to
relate more ethically towards one another. Like Judy, Akila agrees [that
the atmosphere promotes an emphasis on competitive success that makes
debate feel like "warfare," a common masculine metaphor]{.underline}.
Akila shares: On a personal level, I spent time writing this poem to try
to convey to you what being a woman of color and an immigrant is like
under this year's topic which is immigration, but because of the way
that we are taught to socialize in a sort of militarized space that is
debate, that gets lost until it becomes some sort of arsenal or some
sort of weapon. My narrative is just a reason we should win because it
foregrounds experiences of immigrants...that's not a good way of
understanding why people put themselves in debates. People put
themselves in debates because debate needs to be less insular; it needs
to be less detached from the reality of what we talk about. While some
women experienced this as a barrier, others did not perceive specific
arguments as inherently gendered or as a roadblock to their
participation or success in debate. Even though Catherine adopts this
particular perspective, she has become more aware of language choices in
argumentation, and explains that she frequently hears rhetoric that
equates certain argument choices with weakness, such as comparing
arguments with rape or making comments such as "that's gay" or other.
These comparisons serve to reaffirm hegemonic masculinity, and Catherine
feels that this type of\
rhetoric is a distinct barrier to inclusion in debate. In order to
combat some of these barriers, women utilize argument choice itself as a
tactic. Ivana, for example, frequently deploys feminist arguments in
debate rounds. She notes that even though some men in the community find
it acceptable to speak more candidly  about women's bodies and sexual
experiences, it is perpetually taboo to speak about women's bodies in
debate rounds. Ivana deployed arguments related to women's menstruation
as one way to engage this dichotomy she is confronted with. Thomas
(2007) explains how the menstruation taboo in modern Western society is
"restricting Western women from full citizenship" (p. 76). Ivana's
decision to speak out in this public forum about women's menstruation
might be thought of as a tactic to confront this taboo while reclaiming
a sense of citizenship in the debate community or even in the round
itself. By [requiring both the judge to listen and the other team to
engage her discussion of menstruation, she can call for a questioning of
this simultaneous objectification and silencing of women while
establishing a space for her to feel engaged and empowered by her
argument.]{.underline} [Other women chose to approach these tensions by
using personal experience as evidence, sharing their own stories in
debate rounds. Davis (2007) argues that "women's subjective accounts of
their experiences and how they affect their everyday practices need to
be linked to a critical interrogation of the cultural discourses,
institutional arrangements, and geopolitical contexts in which these
accounts are invariably embedded" (p.133) This is precisely what these
women are doing, weaving their own narratives in with theoretical texts
and political events situated while acknowledging the particular
institutional space the activity is located in.]{.underline} Lucille
doesn't feel that she uses tactics in debate rounds very often to
overcome these barriers, however she notes that there are instances
where enough was enough and she spoke about her subjectivity as a woman.
[Several women noted that being able to speak about being a female or
femininity in general while also remaining strategic and successful was
an empowering tactic. Akila calls these types of tactics "little
disruptions," or subversive instances in debate that challenge their
competitors and judges to a moment of reflexivity.]{.underline}

### 2NC -- Ext -- Impact Framing

#### Structural Violence is worse than nuclear war. Extinction is now.

**Abu-Jamal 98** - (Mumia Abu-Jamal is a political activist and
journalist who was convicted of murder and sentenced to death in 1982
for the 1981 murder of Philadelphia police officer Daniel Faulkner.)

It has often been observed that America is a truly violent nation, as
shown by the thousands of cases of social and communal violence that
occurs daily in the nation. Every year, some 20,000 people are killed by
others, and additional 20,000 folks kill themselves. Add to this the
nonlethal violence that Americans daily inflict on each other, and we
begin to see the tracings of a nation immersed in a fever of violence.
But, as remarkable, and harrowing as this level and degree of violence
is, it is, by far, not the most violent features of living in the midst
of the American empire. [We live]{.underline}, equally immersed, and to
a deeper degree, [in a nation that condones and ignores wide-ranging
\"structural\' violence, of a kind that destroys human life with a
breathtaking ruthlessness.]{.underline} Former Massachusetts prison
official and writer, Dr. James Gilligan observes; By \"structural
violence\" I mean the increased rates of death and disability suffered
by those who occupy the bottom rungs of society, as contrasted by those
who are above them. Those excess deaths (or at least a demonstrably
large proportion of them) are a function of the class structure; and
that structure is itself a product of society\'s collective human
choices, concerning how to distribute the collective wealth of the
society. These are not acts of God. I am contrasting \"structural\" with
\"behavioral violence\" by which I mean the non-natural deaths and
injuries that are caused by specific behavioral actions of individuals
against individuals, such as the deaths we attribute to homicide,
suicide, soldiers in warfare, capital punishment, and so on.
\--(Gilligan, J., MD, Violence: Reflections On a National Epidemic (New
York: Vintage, 1996), 192.) [This form of violence]{.underline}, [not
covered by any of the majoritarian, corporate, ruling-class protected
media, is invisible to us]{.underline} [and because of its invisibility,
all the more insidious.]{.underline} How dangerous is it\--really?
Gilligan notes: [\[E\]very fifteen years]{.underline}, on the average,
[as many people die because of relative poverty as would be killed in a
nuclear war that caused 232 million deaths]{.underline}; and [every
single year]{.underline}, [two to three times as many people die from
poverty throughout the world as were killed by the Nazi genocide of the
Jews over a six-year period]{.underline}. [This is]{.underline}, in
effect, [the equivalent of an]{.underline} ongoing,
[unending]{.underline}, in fact [accelerating]{.underline},
[thermonuclear war, or genocide on the weak and poor every year of every
decade, throughout the world.]{.underline} \[Gilligan, p. 196\] Worse
still, [in a]{.underline} thoroughly [capitalist society]{.underline},
much of [that violence became internalized]{.underline}, [turned back on
the Self]{.underline}, [because]{.underline}, in a society based on the
priority of wealth, [those who own nothing are taught to loathe
themselves]{.underline}, as if something is inherently wrong with
themselves, instead of the social order that promotes this
self-loathing. [This intense self-hatred was often manifested in
familial violence]{.underline} as when the husband beats the wife, the
wife smacks the son, and the kids fight each other. [This]{.underline}
vicious, [circular]{.underline}, and invisible [violence]{.underline},
[unacknowledged by the corporate media, uncriticized in substandard
educational systems,]{.underline} and un- understood by the very folks
who suffer in its grips, [feeds on the]{.underline} spectacular and
[more common forms of violence]{.underline} that the system makes damn
sure -that we can recognize and must react to it. [This fatal and
systematic violence may be called The War on the Poor]{.underline}. [It
is found in every country]{.underline}, submerged beneath the sands of
history, [buried]{.underline}, [yet ever present, as omnipotent as
death]{.underline}. In the struggles over the commons in Europe, when
the peasants struggled and lost their battles for their commonal lands
(a precursor to similar struggles throughout Africa and the Americas),
this violence was sanctified, by church and crown, as the \'Divine Right
of Kings\' to the spoils of class battle. Scholars Frances Fox-Piven and
Richard A Cloward wrote, in The New Class War (Pantheon, 1982/1985):
They did not lose because landowners were immune to burning and
preaching and rioting. They lost because the usurpations of owners were
regularly defended by the legal authority and the armed force of the
state. [It was the state that imposed increased taxes or enforced the
payment of increased rents]{.underline}, and evicted or jailed those who
could not pay the resulting debts. [It was the state that made lawful
the appropriation by landowners]{.underline} of the forests, streams,
and commons, and [imposed terrifying penalties on those who persisted in
claiming the old rights to these resources]{.underline}. It was the
state that freed serfs or emancipated sharecroppers only to leave them
landless. (52) [The \"Law\", then, was a tool of the powerful to protect
their interests, then, as now. It was a weapon against the poor and
impoverished, then, as now.]{.underline} It punished retail violence,
while turning a blind eye to the wholesale violence daily done by their
class masters. [The law was, and is, a tool of state power, utilized to
protect the status quo, no matter how oppressive that status was, or
is.]{.underline} Systems are essentially ways of doing things that have
concretized into tradition, and custom, without regard to the rightness
of those ways. [No system that causes this kind of harm to people should
be allowed to remain, based solely upon its time in existence. Systems
must serve life, or be discarded as a threat and a danger to life. Such
systems must pass away, so that their great and terrible violence passes
away with them.]{.underline}

### w2NC -- Ext -- Debate Bad - Harms Education

#### High school debate has become an activity primarily focused on speed and strategic arguments which directly trades off with critical thinking and argumentation skills

**McCordick 2017** (Jack McCordick, Yale University and national debate
champion. The Corrosion of High School Debate -- and How it Mirror
American Politics. September 26th, 2017. Date Accessed: July 7th,

While high school football players burst out of locker rooms at halftime
to vigorous cheers, their counterparts on the debate team exit their
buses and cars to a more muted welcome: the quiet babble of a school
cafeteria [**early on a Saturday** morning**,**]{.underline} where
[**teams of debaters rush to colonize their plots of tables and chairs**
nearest to the electrical outlets or concessions stand.]{.underline} As
extracurriculars go, debate may be the most grinding of them all. In my
four years of high school debating, I spent many long nights holed up
alone in my room poring over amicus briefs or economic analyses. I
passed even longer weekends on buses and planes traveling to schools
across the country and staying in hotels or with local families. From
winter to spring, in settings as grand as a Harvard lecture hall and as
cramped as a boiler room in a Salt Lake City public school, my debate
partner and I held forth on everything from nuclear proliferation to
sanctions against Russia to the private prison industry. The world of
high school debate is often portrayed as a refuge of the budding
brainiac, an incubator of the 21st century's next generation of leaders.
To some extent it is that. But the more revealing truth is that the
debating community for years has been afflicted with an ideological and
practical struggle over the nature of debate. And that struggle does not
exist in a vacuum of cafeterias and lecture halls. It has powerful
implications for the current state of U.S. politics and for the pursuit
of social justice. Looking back, [it seems as if the course of my high
school debating career mirrored a deeper erosion in the quality of
debate in our wider society]{.underline}. Thanks to a media landscape
poisoned by partisan loyalties, the dissemination of "fake news" and the
ideological echo chambers created by social media, the country is in the
throes of a deep crisis. We don't know who we are anymore. When I asked
myself whether my extracurricular was a force against this decline, or
an accessory to it, far too often I settled on the latter. [The
conventions of high school debate were enabling, at times even creating,
our divisive culture.]{.underline} To understand how high school debate
went awry, you would have to go all the way back to its origins. The
first debate format practiced widely in high schools, beginning in the
1970s, was called Policy Debate. The format, which is still around
today, consists of two teams of two debaters each. The affirmative team
proposes a policy "plan" based on a resolution---for example, "The
United States federal government should significantly reform its
criminal justice system." The negative team responds to that plan.
Unlike more recent formats, where the topics change month-to-month,
policy topics run for an entire year and require extraordinary
dedication to research and preparation. As Policy Debate grew in
popularity, the more Machiavellian debaters attempted to gain an edge by
overwhelming their opponents with as many arguments and as much
supporting evidence as possible. This was because if a team "dropped" an
argument by its opponent---if it did not respond to the other side's
claim---that argument was conceded as "true," no matter how insane it
was. Chief among the strategies exploiting this rule was "spreading" (a
combination of "speed" and "reading"), where debaters would rattle off
arguments at a blistering pace. Their speeches often exceeded 300 words
per minute. (A conversational pace is about 60 per minute.) [**Debaters
started formulating outlandish arguments**. The more apocalyptic the
outcome the better, **with little care for the argument's probability or
real-world application**]{.underline}**.** "A new retirement program
will trigger a nuclear war." "Prison overcrowding would cause the
destruction of the ozone layer." High school debate had come to this.
[If you were to peek into a room in the middle of a policy round, you

functions.]{.underline} When an executive of Phillips Petroleum, then
the primary sponsor of the National Forensics League, observed a debate

The executive aired his concerns to the league's executive council,
resulting in an entirely new debate category called the Lincoln-Douglas
debate. This format, with its express reference to the famous debates
over slavery between Abraham Lincoln and Stephen Douglas, was designed
to promote debates about values and prioritize rhetorical persuasion. In
contrast to Policy Debate's wonkish topics, L.D. featured more timeless
resolutions. "It is morally permissible to kill one innocent person to
save the lives of more innocent people." Or "When in conflict, idealism
ought to be valued above pragmatism. [The new format earned the disdain
of Policy Debate's more snobbish competitors, who joked that its
initials stood for "learning disabled."]{.underline} But for students
disillusioned with P.D.'s descent into nonsensical, mile-a-minute
argumentation, it was a godsend. At least for a while. Soon L.D.
suffered the same fate as its precursor. [**The speed of argumentation
increased**, as did the amount of evidence required to be competitive at
the national level. As with Policy Debate, **the arguments became
increasingly unmoored from reality.** Some debaters even began refusing
to debate the resolutions altogether, formulating elaborate theoretical

they had been given.]{.underline} As L.D. descended further and further
into absurdity, Ted Turner, the billionaire founder of CNN, came along
and attempted to turn the ship again. Like the Philips executive several
decades earlier, he pushed the National Forensic League in 2002 to
establish a new debate format that would be plainspoken and jargon-free.
The resulting format, which immediately drew comparisons to CNN's
"Crossfire," was called Public Forum. Its title was an expression of Mr.
Turner's hope that any reasonably informed member of the public could
walk into a Public Forum round and be able to pick a winner. A decade
and a half after its inception, P.F. is still by far the most
intelligible category in debate. However, in recent years its speed has
increased markedly, as have the mountains of evidence. The **[emphasis

time I began to realize that high school debate was my firsthand
education in the perversion and abuse of language. I learned how
language could be used to conceal, to muddle. This was not limited to
the debate community. The writer (and former debate wunderkind) Ben
Lerner once wrote, "Americans are always getting 'spread' in their daily
lives."

#### Debate offers a false illusion of knowledge and tricks people into believing that they can actually change the system -- the language cannot be transferred to other activities

graduate student with a background in law and international relations;

not endore the ableist language in this cite/card

I still remember the first debate I ever did. It was in a high school
classroom that smelled of deodorant. Our school ran a debate club
on-and-off throughout my adolescence, and I loved the idea of taking
part ever since I first saw a session in eighth grade. As a dorky
11-year-old drowning in a sweater I was supposed to "grow into," I sat
in the back of the audience, enthralled. The debaters were all much
older than me and used a lot of big words, like the smarter adults I
knew and wanted to be. Five years later, I was 16, very confident in my
intelligence, and very insecure about everything else (still hadn't
grown into that sweater). A classmate decided to start up the debate
club again, and I pounced on the opportunity to join. Our first subject
was reinstating the death penalty, and I was "anti" (since we were young
and sincere, we all picked the sides we really believed in. One of the
people on the "pro" side is now a cop). For our opening speech, I gave
all the points you would expect in an argument against the death
penalty: the unacceptably high rate of false convictions, the particular
targeting of non-white defendants, the cost, the cruelty, the lack of
data proving its effectiveness as a deterrent. My opponent's speech was
much shorter. They simply named three famous child killers --- including
one who had murdered someone three miles from our school --- and said
"do you think these people deserve to live?" My opponent won. To
understand why debate is inadequate to the task of our current moment,
one need look no further than the Munk Debate: a biannual event held in
Toronto in which well-known academics, pundits, and policymakers argue
about controversial statement in a modern-day gladiatorial battle. Most
recently, the resolution was "the future of America is populist, not
liberal." Squaring up against each other were the notorious ex-White
House strategist and jacuzzi-ruiner Steve Bannon, and
guy-who-coined-Axis-of-Evil-but-is-somehow-now-in-the-Resistance David
Frum. There was an outcry over the decision to give Bannon yet another
platform, but for supporters of this type of event, scandal is a sign of
success. After all, these days we are constantly being told that one of
the top threats to society is not climate change or fascism but people
stifling debate. Some claim that by "no-platforming" controversial
speakers, or calling pundits mean names on Twitter after they say
something racist on Bill Maher's show, we are facilitating a dangerous
slide into illiberalism. If those pearl-clutchers are to be believed,
the key to becoming a society of informed and sophisticated
intellectuals is to hook ourselves up to an IV of pure debate, and let
the heated repartee course through our veins until it leads us to
fact-based solutions. As it turned out, the debate didn't go so well for
fans of liberalism. Frum himself tried to make sense of it in a
postmortem published in The Atlantic, scratching his head at the
wreckage he and Bannon had left behind. At first, the post-debate
polling suggested that Bannon had won the hearts and minds of the
audience, with 57 percent taking his side by the end, compared to 28
percent at the start of the event. Later the Munk Debate officials
issued a correction, stating that the audience voted exactly the same at
the start and the end, which by the debate's rules is considered a draw.
The situation remains somewhat unclear, but we know this much: best case
scenario, Frum got onto a stage with a person who appeals to humanity's
grossest instincts, believing he could defeat those instincts with
knowledge, reason, and Enlightenment values --- and he didn't move the
needle in the slightest. Admittedly, debates can produce some pretty
entertaining clips of people you don't like getting owned. Peewee
Republican Charlie Kirk's explosive anger at being asked his salary is
objectively funny. And, depending on the format, debates can sometimes
be well-paced, reasonably fair, and introduce you to new information. A
recent debate at Pomona College, between Dan Mitchell of the libertarian
Cato Institute and Nathan J. Robinson of the socialist magazine Current
Affairs, is an example of a calm, well-moderated discussion in which
both parties had the space to explain themselves. Perhaps this has
something to do with the fact that this event was intended for a small
audience and seemingly recorded and uploaded as an afterthought, rather
than expressly for the plentiful Youtube money that rains down on any
right-wing pundit who finds an audience of excitable young reactionaries
craving edgy video content. [But any form of debate is inherently
flawed. The aim of debate is not to provide a detailed, cogent,
well-sourced answer to the question at hand. The aim of debate is to be
the most convincing, not the smartest, and anyone who's good at debating
knows this.]{.underline} [This is how former Breitbart scribe Ben
Shapiro has a reputation as an intellectual warrior when his arguments
mostly consist of saying incorrect things very fast. This is why
conservative political commentator Steven Crowder has a series called
"Change My Mind" in which he ambushes random college kids with a big
binder full of pre-prepared talking points, and pulls the mic away from
them anytime they seem like they might actually change someone's
mind.]{.underline} This is how a call to murder pedophiles got my high
school audience onside better than my scribbled stats on deterrence
rates did. People --- yes, even you --- do not make decisions on an
entirely rational basis. An audience is more easily won over with a
one-liner that inspires applause or laughter than a five-minute
explanation of a complicated phenomenon. A false statistic repeated
confidently will be more convincing than a truth stated haltingly by
some guy you've never heard of, and who you've already decided you don't
like because he's arguing against the guy you came to see. Massively
complex ideologies with hundreds of years of scholarship behind them are
reduced to a couple of fast-talking egos in Dockers thinking about the
best way to make their opponent look like a dumbass. Debate is not
politics. It's theater. Real learning is hard. It's a slow, confusing
process where you sometimes have to read long books with dreadful
covers, and look at footnotes and shit. It requires us to recognize and
then overcome our biases as best we can. It can take years to learn what
we really think and why, and then if we get a lingering feeling we might
be wrong, it can take years to un-learn and start all over. [Debate, in
contrast, offers an easy way out. Some dudes spouting their favorite
buzzwords in each other's vicinity makes us feel smart and engaged, like
we're in that fresco of the Greek men they put on all the philosophy
textbooks. (Small aside --- have you ever noticed how in this image, all
the female figures look thoroughly sick of these guys?) However, the
format of debate, which is supposed to represent the height of
intellectual tradition, encourages us instead to applaud the candidate
who is best at using simple rhetoric, looking suave, and machine-gunning
irrelevant lines at their browbeaten interlocutor.]{.underline} These
are all things that real intellectual inquiry is supposed to look
beyond. Do not be tempted by the promise of easy satisfaction. Watching
a debate can make you actively worse at understanding the nuances of a
topic. If you want to really know about a subject, here's my advice:
read widely and extensively (and not just the books your favorite
YouTuber recommends). Talk to people, patiently and fairly, rejecting
your instinctual desire to win. And perhaps most importantly --- take
this from a veteran --- do not reward former debate team kids with your
attention. They are the worst type of nerds and they never share their
snacks.

### 2NC -- Ext: Debate Bad -- Harms Skills

#### Debate dialogue is meaningless

While high school football players burst out of locker rooms at halftime
to vigorous cheers, their counterparts on the debate team exit their
buses and cars to a more muted welcome: the quiet babble of a school
cafeteria early on a Saturday morning, where teams of debaters rush to
colonize their plots of tables and chairs nearest to the electrical
outlets or concessions stand. [As extracurriculars go, debate may be the
most grinding of them all]{.underline}. In my four years of high school
debating, I spent many long nights holed up alone in my room poring over
amicus briefs or economic analyses. I passed even longer weekends on
buses and planes traveling to schools across the country and staying in
hotels or with local families. From winter to spring, in settings as
grand as a Harvard lecture hall and as cramped as a boiler room in a
Salt Lake City public school, my debate partner and I held forth on
everything from nuclear proliferation to sanctions against Russia to the
private prison industry. As extracurriculars go, debate is maybe the
most grinding of them all. The world of high school debate is often
portrayed as a refuge of the budding brainiac, an incubator of the 21st
century's next generation of leaders. To some extent it is that. [But
the more revealing truth is that the debating community for years has
been afflicted with an ideological and practical struggle over the
nature of debate. And that struggle does not exist in a vacuum of
cafeterias and lecture halls. It has powerful implications for the
current state of U.S. politics and for the pursuit of social
justice.]{.underline} Looking back, it seems as if the course of my high
school debating career mirrored a deeper erosion in the quality of
debate in our wider society. Thanks to a media landscape poisoned by
partisan loyalties, the dissemination of "fake news" and the ideological
echo chambers created by social media, [the country is in the throes of
a deep crisis. We don't know who we are anymore]{.underline}. When I
asked myself whether my extracurricular was a force against this
decline, or an accessory to it, far too often I settled on the latter.
The conventions of high school debate were enabling, at times even
creating, our divisive culture. To understand how high school debate
went awry, you would have to go all the way back to its origins. The
first debate format practiced widely in high schools, beginning in the
1970s, was called Policy Debate. The format, which is still around
today, consists of two teams of two debaters each. The affirmative team
proposes a policy "plan" based on a resolution---for example, "The
United States federal government should significantly reform its
criminal justice system." The negative team responds to that plan.
Unlike more recent formats, where the topics change month-to-month,
policy topics run for an entire year and require extraordinary
dedication to research and preparation. The conventions of high school
debate were enabling, at times even creating, our divisive culture. [As
Policy Debate grew in popularity, the more Machiavellian debaters
attempted to gain an edge by overwhelming their opponents with as many
arguments and as much supporting evidence as possible. This was because
if a team "dropped" an argument by its opponent---if it did not respond
to the other side's claim---that argument was conceded as
"true,"]{.underline} no matter how inane it was. Chief among the

"speed" and "reading"), where debaters would rattle off arguments at a

formulating outlandish arguments. The more apocalyptic the outcome the
better, with little care for the argument's probability or real-world
application. "A new retirement program will trigger a nuclear war."
"Prison overcrowding would cause the destruction of the ozone layer."
High school debate had come to this.]{.underline} If you were to peek
into a room in the middle of a policy round, you would likely be treated
to a flurry of limbs and spittle, as a teenager expelled arguments from
his mouth with such speed and force that he would sometimes appear to
lose control of his fine motor functions. When an executive of Phillips

was a godsend. At least for a while. Soon L.D. suffered the same fate as
its precursor. The speed of argumentation increased, as did the amount
of evidence required to be competitive at the national level. [As with

of evidence (much of it of dubious value) and specialized jargon often
confused more than it revealed. **It became like the kind of language

immensely important skills from my four years of debate. I have met many
brilliant, incredibly well-read students from across the country from
schools dedicated to treating debate the right way. But these are
exceptions, not the rule. The norms that currently guide debate elevate
form over content, and victory over truth. Debate programs are perfectly
situated to produce students who want to seek the truth, who will resist
the decay of quality public speech. [As currently
practiced,]{.underline} however[, the clearest evidence of a high school
debate career is often just a collection of plastic trophies, slowly
gathering dust.]{.underline}

## 2NC -- Alternative Models

### 2NC -- Collaborative Model - Skills

#### Prefer The Collaborative model as opposed to the adversarial nature of plan-centric debate -- it functions as a training ground for technical skills necessary for comprehension and communication 

**Yanklowitz 13** (Dr. Shmuly Yanklowitz, President & Dean of the Valley
Beit Midrash, the Founder & President of Uri L'Tzedek, the Founder and
CEO of The Shamayim V'Aretz Institute and the author of ten books on
Jewish ethics, "Cognitive Conflict: Should Educational Debates Be
Competitive or Collaborative?" Huffpost.com, August 26, 2013,
https://www.huffpost.com/entry/should-educational-debates-be-competitive-or-collaborative_b_3802088)//AR

I recently made the case for the importance of developing argument
skills and explored various academic approaches to enhancing cognitive
development. [We must also explore whether we\'ll embrace a competitive
or collaborative learning environment to further student
growth.]{.underline} While there is support for using dyadic
argumentation as a means of cognitive engagement (Billig, 1987; Kuhn,
1991), [there is debate about whether argumentation should be
competitive, collaborative or a combination of the two]{.underline}.
Others have framed this debate as being about \"[adversarial\" versus
\"exploratory\" discourse]{.underline}. In favor of collaborative
learning, Lin and Anderson (2008) explain that \"[rubbing up against
others with different points of view is one of the best ways to bring to
light gaps in understanding, inconsistencies in thinking, and my-side
bias, and hence, the value of collaborative discussion and reasoned
argumentation]{.underline}.\" Students can collaborate by challenging
each other but there are other models of collaboration to consider.
Since argument consists both of \"product\" (propositions and
conclusions) and \"process\" (dialogue about arguments) [collaboration
can come in the form of discourse (process) or in a shared goal
(product]{.underline}). Walton (1999) termed it differently as
\"information-seeking\" dialogue rather than a persuasive dialogue.
Wegerif, Mercer, and Dawes (1999) have called collaborative learning
\"exploratory talk.\" Reznitskaya et al. (2001) suggests that
\"[collaborative discussion appears to be an effective training ground
for the development and internalization of generalized knowledge of
argumentation.\"]{.underline} Felton (2003) suggests that a \"process of
co-constructing arguments is accomplished through the use of discourse
strategies\" through \"argument construction\" and \"discourse
strategies.\" Others explain collaborative argumentation as \"[a social
process in which individuals work together to construct and critique
arguments]{.underline}\" (Golanicks & Nussbaum, 2008; Nussbaum, 2002). A
strong basis for adversarial argumentation can be traced back to Piaget.
Through cognitive conflict, Piaget suggested, conceptual change
triggered by disagreement could occur (1963). According to Piaget, a
learner constructs knowledge when receiving input from the environment.
The learner\'s mental structures incorporate the new experience
(assimilation). [If the newly-assimilated information conflicts with a
previously formed mental structure, then the result is called
disequilibrium which motivates the learner to seek
equilibrium]{.underline}. [Reaching equilibrium results in]{.underline}
what Piaget called accommodation leading to the [development of new
mental structures. Through]{.underline} this [assimilation and
accommodation, the learner adapts to the environmental input
received]{.underline}. For Piaget, there are four primary stages of
cognitive development: sensorimotor, preoperational, concrete
operational, formal operational. In Felton\'s competitive argumentation
model (debate), there are three skills to argument construction:
\"producing justifications, producing counterarguments, and rebutting
counterarguments.\" However Felton suggests that the skills of argument
construction are learned at a young age and that our educational focus
should be on discourse strategies; that is, \"to construct arguments
competitively in social contexts.\" Felton and Kuhn (2001) have even
developed a system of categorization for strategies in argumentative
discourse. Keefer, Zeitz, and Resnick (2000) claim that **[collaborative
argumentation enables deeper arguments than adversarial
argumentation]{.underline}**. However, it should be acknowledged that
some claim that there is not one correct method (collaborative or
competitive) for all students. Rather, each student\'s personality
should be taken into consideration. Nussbaum (2002), for example, showed
that \"[introverts tend to prefer collaborative over adversarial
discourse\" and may feel more threatened by adversarial
argumentation.]{.underline} While a comparison between the competitive
and collaborative models can be quite complex, a more prevailing
approach has been put forth. Kuhn, Shaw and Felton (1997) wrote: \"In
the case of argumentive reasoning, [the conflict model of change has
dominated, on the assumption that the power of dialogue stems from the
discrepancy between viewpoints,]{.underline} creating the opportunity
for each member of the dyad to be exposed to new perspectives that might
potentially be integrated into their own thinking.\" **[Students
collaborate through a dialogical adversarial approach to
argument.]{.underline}** Kuhn et al. (2008) [distinguish between the
\"classical argument\" goal (prevailing over an opponent) from \"dilemma
resolution\" (resolving the underlying problem that the two sides
address).]{.underline} To further epistemic and moral development, we
must focus more on cognitive development through the cultivation of
argument skills. We also must determine the learning culture that will
serve as a future foundation for how students view the other in the
marketplace of ideas. The choice between a competitive or collaborative
learning environment will not only determine the quality of learning but
it may also help determine the nature of our future economies and
political cultures.

### 2NC -- Collaborative Model -- Truth Testing

#### Purely competitive models of debate prioritize winning over the discovery of truth -- only a collaborative model ensures the veracity of truth-testing itself

**Tsipursky 17** (Gleb Tsipursky Ph.D., professor at the Ohio State
University, where he published dozens of articles in peer-reviewed
academic publications, "How To Win Arguments Through Collaborative
Truth-Seeking Research-based strategies to win arguments by finding the
truth.", Psychology Today, April 28, 2017,
https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/intentional-insights/201704/how-win-arguments-through-collaborative-truth-seeking)//AR

We frequently use debates to resolve different opinions about the truth.
However, debates are not always the best course for figuring out the
truth. In more emotionally charged situations, the technique of
collaborative truth-seeking is often better. The Problem with Debates
The usual method of hashing out disagreements in order to discover the
truth about reality is through debates, in person or online. Yet [more
often than not,]{.underline} **[people on opposing sides of a debate end
up seeking to persuade rather than prioritizing truth
discovery]{.underline}**. Indeed, [research suggests that debates have a
specific evolutionary function -- not for discovering the truth but to
ensure that our perspective prevails within a tribal social
context]{.underline}. No wonder debates are often compared to wars. This
is especially so in emotionally charged topics, such as politics, as our
autopilot system takes over and inhibits our ability to be rational in
our engagement with others. [We may hope that we would strive to
discover the truth during debates.]{.underline} Yet given that we are
not always fully rational and strategic in our social engagements, it is
easy to slip up within debate mode and orient toward winning instead of
uncovering the truth. Heck, I know that I sometimes forget in the midst
of a heated debate that I may be the one who is wrong -- I'd be
surprised if this didn't happen with you. So while we should certainly
continue to engage in debates, we should also use additional strategies
-- less natural and intuitive ones. These strategies could put us in a
better mindset for updating our beliefs and improving our perspective on
the truth. [One such solution is a mode of engagement called
**collaborative truth-seeking.**]{.underline} Collaborative
Truth-Seeking Collaborative truth-seeking is one way of describing [a
more intentional approach in which two or more people with different
opinions engage in a process that focuses on finding out the
truth]{.underline}. Collaborative truth-seeking is a modality that
should be used among people with shared goals and a shared sense of
trust. [Some important features of collaborative truth-seeking, which
are often not present in debates, are: focusing on a desire to change
one's own mind toward the truth;]{.underline} a curious attitude; being
sensitive to others' emotions; striving to avoid arousing emotions that
will hinder updating beliefs and truth discovery; and a trust that all
other participants are doing the same. These can contribute to increased
social sensitivity, which, together with other attributes, correlate
with accomplishing higher group performance on a variety of activities.
Share weaknesses and uncertainties in your own position Share your
biases about your position Share your social context and background as
relevant to the discussion. For instance, I grew up poor once my family
immigrated to the US when I was 10, and this naturally influences me to
care about poverty more than some other issues, thus biasing me in this
area Vocalize curiosity and the desire to learn Ask the other person to
call you out if they think you\'re getting emotional or engaging in
emotive debate instead of collaborative truth-seeking, and consider
using a safe word Here are additional techniques that can help you stay
in collaborative truth-seeking mode after establishing trust:
Self-signal: signal to yourself that you want to engage in collaborative
truth-seeking, instead of debating Empathize: try to empathize with the
other perspective that you do not hold by considering where their
viewpoint came from, why they think what they do, and recognizing that
they feel that their viewpoint is correct Keep calm: be prepared with
emotional management to calm your emotions and those of the people you
engage with when a desire for debate arises. Watch out for defensiveness
and aggressiveness in particular Go slow: take the time to listen fully
and think fully Consider pausing: have an escape route for complex
thoughts and emotions if you can't deal with them in the moment by
pausing and picking up the discussion later. Say "I will take some time
to think about this," and/or write things down Echo: paraphrase the
other person's position to indicate and check whether you've fully
understood their thoughts Be open: orient toward improving the other
person's points to argue against their strongest form Stay the course:
be passionate about wanting to update your beliefs, maintain the most
truthful perspective, and adopt the best evidence and arguments, no
matter if they are yours of those of others Be diplomatic: when you
think the other person is wrong, strive to avoid saying \"you\'re wrong
because of X\" but instead to use questions, such as \"what do you think
X implies about your argument?\" Be specific and concrete: go down
levels of abstraction Be clear: make sure the semantics are clear to all
by defining terms. Consider tabooing terms if some are emotionally
arousing, and make sure you are describing the same territory of reality
Be probabilistic: use probabilistic thinking and probabilistic language,
to help get at the extent of disagreement and be as specific and
concrete as possible. For instance, avoid saying that X is absolutely
true, but say that you think there\'s an 80% chance it\'s the true
position. Consider adding what evidence and reasoning led you to believe
so, for both you and the other participants to examine this chain of
thought When people whose perspective you respect fail to update their
beliefs in response to your clear chain of reasoning and evidence,
update a little somewhat toward their position, since that presents
evidence that your position is not very convincing [Confirm your
sources]{.underline}: look up information when it\'s possible to do so
(Google is your friend) Charity mode: try to be more charitable to
others and their expertise than seems intuitive to you, as our
intuitions are a bad guide to seeking the truth when the person with
whom we are in discussion has a perspective different from our own. For
instance, if someone says something that seems wrong to you, check to
make sure that is what the person actually said - you might have
misheard things, or the person might have misstated something [Use the
reversal test to check for status quo bias]{.underline}: If you are
discussing whether to change some specific numeric parameter - say
increase by 50% the money donated to charity X - state the reverse of
your positions, for example decreasing the amount of money donated to
charity X by 50%, and see how that impacts your perspective Use CFAR's
double crux technique In this technique, two parties who hold different
positions on an argument each writes the the fundamental reason for
their position (the crux of their position). This reason has to be the
key one, so if it was proven incorrect, then each would change their
perspective. Then, look for experiments that can test the crux. Repeat
as needed. If a person identifies more than one reason as crucial, you
can go through each as needed. More details are here. Of course, not all
of these techniques are necessary for high-quality collaborative
truth-seeking. Some are easier than others, and different techniques
apply better to different kinds of truth-seeking discussions. You can
apply some of these techniques during debates as well, such as double
crux and the reversal test. Try some out and see how they work for you.
Conclusion [Engaging in collaborative truth-seeking goes against our
natural impulses to win in a debate, and is thus more cognitively
costly.]{.underline} It also tends to take more time and effort than
just debating. It is also easy to slip into debate mode even when using
collaborative truth-seeking, because of the intuitive nature of debate
mode. Moreover, collaborative truth-seeking need not replace debates at
all times. This non-intuitive mode of engagement can be chosen when
discussing issues that relate to deeply-held beliefs and/or ones that
risk emotional triggering for the people involved. Because of my own
background, I would prefer to discuss poverty in collaborative
truth-seeking mode rather than debate mode, for example. On such issues,
[collaborative truth-seeking can provide a shortcut to resolution, in
comparison to protracted, tiring, and emotionally challenging
debates]{.underline}. Likewise, using collaborative truth-seeking to
resolve differing opinions on all issues holds the danger of creating a
community oriented excessively toward sensitivity to the perspectives of
others, which might result in important issues not being discussed
candidly. After all, research shows the importance of having
disagreement in order to make wise decisions and to figure out the
truth. Of course, [collaborative truth-seeking is well suited to
expressing disagreements in a sensitive way]{.underline}, so if used
appropriately, it might permit even people with triggers around certain
topics to express their opinions. Taking these caveats into
consideration, [collaborative truth-seeking is a great tool to use to
discover the truth]{.underline} and to update our beliefs, as it can get
past the high emotional barriers to altering our perspectives that have
been put up by evolution.

### 2NC -- Ext - Bottom-Up Model/Body Politics -- Arms

#### Government discussions of arms sales are motivated by hegemony, ignoring the consequences of the policies discussed 

**Thrall and Dorminey, 2018** (A. Trevor Thrall and Caroline Dorminey,
3-13-2018, \"Risky Business: The Role of Arms Sales in U.S. Foreign
Policy,\" Cato Institute,
https://www.cato.org/publications/policy-analysis/risky-business-role-arms-sales-us-foreign-policy)MNF

What role should arms sales play in American foreign policy? Though
major deals --- like Trump's \$110 billion agreement with Saudi Arabia
announced in 2017 or the decision to sell arms to Ukraine --- [provoke
brief periods of discussion, there is no real debate in Washington about
the wisdom of exporting vast quantities of weapons around the globe to
allies and nonallies alike]{.underline}. [Congress, which has the
authority to cancel arms deals, has not impeded a deal since the passage
of the 1976 Arms Export Control Act created the framework for doing
so]{.underline}. Since 9/11 the pace of sales has increased. From 2002
to 2016, the United States sold roughly \$197 billion worth of weapons
and related military support to 167 countries.1In just his first year
Donald Trump cut a deal worth as much as \$110 billion to Saudi Arabia
alone and notified Congress of 157 sales worth more than \$84 billion to
42 other nations.2Despite losing market share over the past two decades
because of increasing competition, [the United States still enjoyed the
largest share of the global arms trade between 2012 and 2016 at 33
percent.3 The current consensus in favor of arms sales rests on three
planks]{.underline}. First, advocates argue that arms sales enhance
American security by bolstering the military capabilities of allies,
enabling them to deter and contain their adversaries, and helping
promote stability in critical areas like the Middle East and Southeast
Asia. Second, they argue that arms sales help the United States exert
influence over the behavior and foreign policies of client nations.
Finally, advocates argue that arms sales provide a boon to the U.S.
economy and fiscal benefits in the form of lower unit costs to the
Pentagon, while helping ensure the health of the American defense
industrial base.4 We argue, however, that **[Washington's faith in the
wisdom of foreign arms sales is seriously misplaced]{.underline}. [The
benefits tend to be oversold]{.underline}**[,]{.underline} and the
downsides are often simply ignored. [The defense industry and its
champions, in particular, have long exaggerated the economic boon of
arms sales]{.underline}.5 And even if they were greater, economic
benefits alone are not worth subverting strategic considerations. [More
importantly, the strategic deficits of arms sales are severe enough to
overwhelm even the most optimistic economic argument. It is the
strategic case for and against arms sales that we consider in this
analysis]{.underline}. [Arms sales create a host of negative,
**unintended consequences** that warrant a much more cautious and
limited approach, even **in support of an expansive grand strategy like
primacy or liberal hegemon**y.]{.underline} [From the perspective of
those who would prefer a more restrained American foreign policy, the
prospective benefits of engaging in the arms trade are even
smaller]{.underline}. Even in cases where the United States wants a
nation to arm itself, there is rarely a need for the weapons to come
from the United States. Moreover, the United States would generate
significant diplomatic flexibility and moral authority by refraining
from selling arms. Given these outsized risks and nebulous rewards, the
United States should greatly reduce international arms sales.

## 2NC -- Black Framework

### 2NC -- Political Efficacy -- Eurocentric Ethics

#### The affirmative replicates the Eurocentric notion of conceptual ethics, or ethics as a [way of thought]{.underline}. Only rupturing this academization of black resistance through [existential ethics]{.underline} can provide an alternative to Eurocentric political thought.

**Ani '94** -- Anthropologist and African Studies Scholar (Marimba,
"Yurugu: an African-Centered Critique of European Cultural Thought and
Behavior," March 1994, pages 329-221)

It has been part of the posture of [the moral philosophers of European
culture]{.underline} to disavow cultural commitment, yet their work has
contributed significantly to the survival and intensification of the
rhetorical ethic-the hypocrisy and the deception that constitute a vital
and definitive part of the content of European cultural imperial-
ism-and, therefore, to nationalistic objectives. To begin with the
Platonic-influenced utamawazo [provide]{.underline}s [the theoretical
basis for]{.underline} a conceptual ethics; [an ethical
system]{.underline}, the themes of which are considered to be valid, as
long as they are consistent in terms of the logic of that system. [What
is \"ethical\" becomes what is \"rational\" and \"logical.\" The most
\"ethical\" statement is the purest abstraction.]{.underline} As
Havelock correctly observes, the individual \"thinking\" psyche becomes
the seat of morality and the individual\'s ability to act ethically is
based on his ability to think \"rationally\"; i.e., \"abstractly."
[**The result, again, is \"talk.\" The European idea is that words
divorced from action,** feeling, commitment, from human involvement
**can them- selves be relevant to** (and properly inform) **human
interaction**]{.underline}-as long as they are part of a consistent
syntax; an approved semantical system. [This pursuit itself is an
exercise in self-deception.]{.underline} Primary cultures are
characterized by an \"existential ethic\" (Stanley Diamond) that is
based on and refers to actual behavior. [European culture gives rise to
semantical systems and instead of being concerned with the inconsistency
between \"word\" and \"deed**\"**]{.underline} (which could conceivably
be the determinant of ethical behaVior), [the moral philosophers are
merely concerned with verbal and what they call \"logical\"
inconsistency. One result of this characteristic of the culture is a
tendency to make philosophers the most irrelevant of people and to
effectively divorce their work from any decision-making
capacity]{.underline} or role that in any way influences the ethical
behavior of European peoples. What this tradition has done instead is to
support the culture in its ability to use words without meaning, and to
support Europeans in their quest to deceive others and themselves as
well. The body of literature known as \"ethical theory\" has to a large
degree been conducive to the growth of moral hypocrisy in European
culture. It is the \"liberal\" academic tradition in contemporary
European/ European American culture that uses the rhetorical ethic best
to sup- port the objectives of European chauvinism. [Ingeniously t**hese
theorists use the semantical systems of the moral philosophers**, the
\"brotherhood\" rhetoric]{.underline} of the Christian statement and
**[empty abstractions like \"humanitarianism\" and \"universalistic
ethics\" as evidence of the ideological commitments]{.underline}** of
the Europeans and therefore as indices of the nature of European
culture. [They are \"critical,\" because they say that the imperialistic
behavior of the European has represented a conflicting theme or
\"negative\" tendency in European development. The result of their
theories, however, is that they succeed in making the European
responsible for everything-the \"good\" as well as the \"bad\"-and in
the end the good far outweighs the bad and will,]{.underline} of course,
triumph along with \"reason.\" Norman F. Cantor provides an excellent
example of the subtle chauvinism of the European liberal academician in
his work on Western culture. He says, The new ethos of the late 1960\'s
sought to restore to their central place in Western culture the
religious, mystical, compassionate, imaginative, and altruistic ideals
that had been tarnished or ignored by industrialism and secularism, by
the mechanism and bureaucracy of modern life. 22 The new ethos had
indigenous roots in some of the central cur- rents of the Western
tradition-in Christian mysticism, in the Enlightenment\'s vision of a
happy and peaceful world, [in Romanticism\'s yearning of the union of
self and nature and for the union of all individuals in the Absolute
Spirit, in anarchism\'s faith in the spontaneous association of men in a
harmonious community when freed from the brutality and oppression of the
state]{.underline}, in Nietzsche\'s life-affirming ethic and Freud\'s
revelation of the pri- macy of erotic impulses, and in the existential
philosophy of Camus, Sartre, and Jaspers. 23 The trick is to \"claim\"
ideas that have failed to influence the def- inition of the culture:
because they do not fit in with the asili. In this way, \\any critique
of European ideology informed by a vision of the human that could only
have been created either by a rejection of European value or in a
culture qualitatively different from European culture itself becomes a
\"Western\" product. [And this argument (if \"argued\" at all) is made
on the basis of values that were, for the European, never more than
rhetoric!]{.underline} \"Christian mysticism\" becomes \"Western,\" and
the \"Enlightenment\'s vision of a happy world\" is not tarnished by the
fact that this world was to be defined in terms of and controlled by
European \"progress.\" Cantor\'s characterization of \"Western
liberalism\" is a perfect statement of what I have called the
\"rhetorical ethic.\" In the statement that follows, taken from the
concluding paragraphs of his three-vol- ume work on European cultural
history, Cantor claims, for the cul- ture, its most severe critics.
Movements that would seek the destruction of what the West has meant are
characterized as expres- sions of Western humanism and of Western
ideals. This excerpt is evi- dence of the characteristic of European
cultural nationalism that we are here delineating. This particular
example is all the more signifi- cant because it represents a fairly
recently published text, used to explain and interpret to the
European-American college student, the nature and meaning of
Western-European history: It is a pernicious misreading of history to
identify Western civilization with the racism, imperialism, and
capitalism of the late nineteenth century. Even in their heyday, [these
attitudes and institutions were only one side of the Western world view
and way of life.]{.underline} The destiny of Western civilization
immeasurably transcends the mistakes of one era. The West has had its
confusion, horror, and misery, its moments when anti-human doctrine have
seemed on the verge of carrying all before them. But it is the glory of
Western civilization that it has never stood still and has never
neglected for long the quest for institutions that can contribute to the
realization of human freedom. Soon its best minds have recalled the
highest ideals of the classical and Christian traditions; they have
inspired their contemporaries with the vision of a great age of
beginning anew, of the establishment of God\'s kingdom on earth or a
secular equivalent in their own time.\" Cantor concludes his panegyric
with the assurance that the \"great upheavals of the 1960\'s were
collectively only manifestations of the age-old western tradition by
which Western \'civilization\' periodically \'renews itself.\'\" In this
way he debunks the need for revolu- tion; and in fact \"claims\" the
revolutionaries, who, he says, will inevitably and happily be
overshadowed by the \"rationalists and moderates, II who have
restructured the institutions of the past and redirected the ideas of
the present. [The result has never been perfect justice or absolute
truth but sufficient justice and enough truth to satisfy the anxieties
of the contemporary era while reestablishing the social peace and
political order that the progress of civilization
requires.]{.underline}22 And so ends Cantor\'s historical study of the
\"genesis and des- tiny\" of Western culture. With its greatest minds as
the custodians of \"civilization\"-not just \"European civilization.\"
[My interpretation of that history is quite different, as it is informed
by an African-centered perspective and methodology.]{.underline} Cantor
is concerned lest the students of the \"new ethos\" would \"shatter\"
and irrevocably separate from what has historically been Western
European culture. **[Our conclusion is that the European tradition must
be \"shattered\" if a truly \"new ethos\" is to replace the
old.]{.underline}** This means a new utamaroho to fulfill a different
asiii. [But then centered in African interest I understand European
culture to be identified with anti-Africanism, the imperialistic
pursuit, and with a denial of the human spirit]{.underline}; whereas
Cantor finds this identification \"pernicious\" and makes the claim that
the \"liberation of the human spirit\" has been a \"central current\" in
the Western tradition. Ultimately Cantor\'s objectives are chauvinistic.
He is concerned with influencing students in such a way that they will
act to maintain the \"peace\" and \"order\" necessary for the
continuance of the European conception of \"progress,\" i.e., the
persistence of European power.

### 2NC -- Political Efficacy -- Cede the Political

#### Withdrawing from politics cedes power to the right

**Themba-Nixon 5** (Makani Themba-Nixon, executive director of The
Praxis Project, a media and policy advocacy organization, "Disrupting
the Discourse: Framing at the Intersection of Racism and Opportunity" AK
Press 2005, http://www.racialequitytools.org/resourcefiles/praxis2.pdf)
//AR

[While talking about race has been declared passé in some communications
circles, any examination of conservative framing on crime, public school
funding, welfare and more show that they seem to talk about little
else.]{.underline} Affirmative action, public school funding, income
supports -- virtually every major political battle underway today banter
race somewhere close to the surface. Race and more precisely [racism, is
where the contest for the "dominant frame" is most intense]{.underline}
and where, when we don't pay close attention, we often lose the battle.
**[If progressives remain silent about race, they not only concede the
race frame to the right]{.underline}**. [They concede all of the issues
that conservatives successfully racialize]{.underline}. And the list of
these issues grows long. The fight over affirmative action invoked
centuries old notions of who is capable and deserving and who is not.
When President Reagan introduced America to the welfare queen, we
certainly got the picture in living color. And what's the main rationale
the right uses for public budget cuts? So those people won't waste your
hard earned money. The right frames nearly everything in a neat "us" and
"them" and, more often than not, the dividing line is the color line.
And they have centuries of stereotypes on their side. Their frames are
like an old song that's hard not to hum once the music starts. [Winning
hearts and minds on a wide range of social justice issues requires that
we disrupt these centuries of programming with a few old songs of our
own]{.underline}. A[nd it will take more than trying to code our
language behind vague "**values**" like **equality**, **opportunity** or
**fairness**.]{.underline} It is easy to get people, even people with
whom we often disagree, to agree that equality and opportunity is good.
[Disrupting the dominant frames on race, deservingness and competency
means focusing on two main questions: Why are things the way they are?
And how can they be different?]{.underline} The answers to these
questions distinguish our "opportunity talk" from the opposition. Every
"why" leads us to a different "how". T[heir "why" stories are bursting
with cultural and biological pathology as an explanation for everything
from poverty, school failure to crime. When the opposition starts that
old song of pathology, **it will only lead toward policies that punish
individuals**.]{.underline} O[ur job as progressives is to expose
patterns and systems of injustice in ways that help people understand
the structural roots of these issues and shift blame away from
victims.]{.underline} When we disrupt their frame and assert a different
story, things change.

[Conviction generated through debating both sides is almost universally
preferable to dogmatic and non-negotiable assertions of
belief]{.underline} (Baird 1955, p. 6). [Switching sides grounds belief
in reasonable reflective thinking;]{.underline} it **[teaches that
decisions should not be rendered until all positions]{.underline}** and
possible consequences **[have been considered]{.underline}** in a
reasoned manner. [This method is closely linked to the value that debate
places on critical thinking]{.underline}. Unsurprisingly, **[many
authors have noted the importance of SSD for generating]{.underline}**
such **[rigorous decision-making skills]{.underline}** (Muir 1993;
Parcher 1998; Rutledge 2002; Speice & Lyle 2003; English, Llano,
Mitchell, Morrison, Rief and Woods 2007). **[The critical thinking
taught by SSD provides the ultimate check against dangerous forms of
cooption.]{.underline}** Over time, certain arguments will prevail over
others only if they have a strong enough logical foundation to withstand
thorough scrutiny. [Debaters will change their minds to support the
"moderate" side of certain positions only if]{.underline}---after
reasoned reflection and sound conviction---[doing so is found to be
preferable]{.underline}. While such a "marketplace of 38 ideas" may be
marked by some imperfections, one of its most effective incarnations is
undoubtedly in academic debate rounds. There, appeals to wealth, status,
and power are minimized by a focus on logic and formal rules, which
protect the ability of all participants to contribute in an honest and
open manner. As a result, it should be assumed that [the insights
generated through debate's dialectic process will be generally correct
and that any shifting beliefs are the reflection of a social
good]{.underline} (the replacement of false ideas with truth).
[Conceiving of conviction in this manner redefines the role of debate
into what Baird calls an "educational procedure":]{.underline} the
formation of [a pedagogical playground to experiment with alternative
ideas]{.underline} and coalesce assertions and unwarranted beliefs into
sound conviction (1966, p. 6). **[Treating debate as a training ground
for advocacy and decision-making has several benefits]{.underline}**:
[it allows debaters the conceptual flexibility to experiment with
minority and extreme ideas, protects them from outside influences, and
buys them time before they are forced to publicly put forward their
opinions]{.underline} (Coverstone 1995). As a result, the primary focus
of the activity shifts from arguing to deciding, giving critical
thinking its crucial importance. A fundamental premise of the anti-SSD's
claim about cooption is thoroughly indicted: it is impossible to lose
one's convictions before they have truly been discovered.

### 2NC -- SSD - Debate key

#### SSD [in Debate]{.underline} is uniquely good to develop tolerance and comprehensive critical thinking

**Harrigan 8** (Casey Harrigan, Director of Debate at MSU, "A DEFENSE OF

It has been argued that many of the benefits of switching sides could
theoretically be achieved through alternative means (Murphy 1957; 1963).
After all, debaters should live well-rounded lives and have many
academic pursuits outside of the competitive arena. The benefits of
tolerance and critical thinking generated through intensive research and
understanding of the opposition's arguments might be created by simply
spending time reading and understanding multiple sides of complex
positions. Practice rounds that simulate actual debating but are
conducted in the privacy and seclusion of the debate office away from
public tournaments can expand debaters' experiences without requiring
SSD. All of this, the anti-SSD advocates such as Murphy say, can capture
the benefit of debating both sides without risking its ethical or social
downsides. However, [even if many of the strengths of switch side debate
can be achieved in other ways, it does not mean that they necessarily
would be.]{.underline} Some students will seek out avenues to broaden
their range of thinking and encounter beliefs that are contrary to their
own. Others will not. [For many students, the competitive aspects of
contest debating are the primary motivation for their initial engagement
with the tedious and complex literature featured in policy debates.
Without the push of SSD and the competitive drive]{.underline}
associated with wins and loses [of]{.underline} competitive [contest
debating, **most would not step outside their narrow personal
beliefs**]{.underline} and enter into a meaningful dialogue with
opposing arguments. [The task of educators is to make the tough choices
about how to direct the learning of their students in order to maximize
their educational benefit. SSD is a timetested way to do
that]{.underline}. 69 Moreover, as was noted by Greene and Hicks, [there
may be something different and special about actively assuming the
position of the advocate for the other side in a public way that is
qualitatively distinct from merely researching the "offending"
arguments]{.underline}. They write that, "**[a unique value of debating
both sides is that it works as a technique of embodied speech
performance]{.underline}**. To produce a liberal citizen requires more
than the presentation of different points of view.

### 2NC -- SSD - AT: Devil's Advocate

#### SSD is essential for effective critique of intolerable positions

Tolerating the Intolerable: A Defense of Limited Argumentative Pluralism
[A second criticism of SSD]{.underline} that has recently been voiced
[is that, because the practice]{.underline} places some restrictions
upon what debaters may argue (by [forcing them to take the position of
the both the affirmative and the negative), it requires students to
become advocates for certain intolerable ideas that should be "off
limits]{.underline}" for discussion. For example, [the increasingly
prevalent usage of postmodern arguments in collegiate debate rounds has
caused many teams to argue that they should not be forced to defend the
"dirty" bureaucratic politics of the federal government]{.underline}
(Solt 2004). A similar phenomenon can be seen in wider spheres of
deliberation as well. During rallies by the Ku Klux Klan, many liberal
activists who generally defend freedom of speech have questioned their
right to spread their racist message. On the opposite side of the
spectrum, some conservatives have objected to United States negotiations
with the government of North Korea because of its poor human rights
record, instead choosing to "shun" the nation through diplomatic
restrictions and economic pressure. [Each of the previous examples
demonstrates that]{.underline}, in certain extremes, [the principles of
free speech and pluralism encounter contradictions. To allow each
individual to voice his or her own opinion, in the most absolute sense,
means to accommodate even those who seek to silence others from
speaking.]{.underline} [To reject views that many consider intolerable
or repulsive may reproduce intolerance]{.underline}. [Because
argumentative pluralism, as an expression of opinion and a litmus test
of societal values, is crucially important for advancing
tolerance,]{.underline} resolving these dilemmas in a manner that most
effectively facilitates respect for difference is an essential task for
engaged citizens of liberal democratic societies. With this goal in
mind, philosopher John Stuart Mill and other scholars of rhetoric and
argumentation have taken up the cause of providing a meta-theory to
guide public deliberation. While Mill is correct in his argument that no
opinion, no matter how minor, should be suppressed on the basis of its
falsity (a position supported by recent writing on argumentation), his
position should be modified to account for two "special cases" in which
suppression of certain views is desirable. First, on the occasion where
one interlocutor is actively attempting to silence another, advocates of
openness must, paradoxically, be willing to say "no" and seek closure.
Second, for the purpose of argument, a common starting point, or stasis,
is required for debate to begin and must be delineated with clear lines
of relevance.

### 2NC -- SSD -- AT: USFG exceptionalism

#### Defending the resolution does not demand defense of the United States Federal Government -- SSD incentivizes contesting [all]{.underline} current dogma, including American exceptionalism

**Harrigan 8** (Casey Harrigan, Director of Debate at MSU, "A DEFENSE OF
SWITCH SIDE DEBATE", Thesis Submitted to the Graduate Faculty of WAKE
FOREST UNIVERSITY in Partial Fulfillment of the Requirements for the
Degree of MASTER OF ARTS in the Department of Communication, May 2008,

The arguments advanced by Massey and other vocal critics of switch side
debating are susceptible to several other persuasive responses. First,
as have been previously argued by Stannard (2006), [many of the
processes that have contributed to American
exceptionalism]{.underline}---globalization, infiltration of academic
institutions by agents of imperialism, etc.---[are on-going, inevitable,
and independent of the institution of competitive debate]{.underline}.
As Alan Coverstone has noted, th[e disengagement of the public from
political participation and adoption of a pure "spectator mentality" has
now become the "predominant mode" of politics]{.underline} (2005, p. 5).
Any citizen who been attentive to political developments over the past
eight years can tell that American politics has been overtaken by an
administration bent on pursuing illiberal policies while wrapping
themselves in the clothing of liberalism. Given the now almost
all-consuming exceptionalist mantra, **[debate is one of the last arenas
that reward anti-institutional thinking and oppositional
rhetoric]{.underline}** (Stannard 2006). **[It is a tremendous "stretch"
to attribute the causal source of exceptionalism to
debate]{.underline}** (Lacy 2006). Debate isn't Vietnam. Nothing in the
activity makes students participate. Once involved, there are no
thought-police who control the content of students' speeches. Those who
argue otherwise show a profound lack of respect for the magnitude of
violence that their comparisons draw likeness to. Instead, the exact
opposite seems truer: [a major and endemic problem, that contributes to
American exceptionalism, is the lack of debate at all levels of
society]{.underline}. Stannard agrees, warning: Don't throw the baby out
with the bathwater. Instead, [seek to expand this method of deliberation
to those who will use it to liberate themselves, confront power, and
create ethical, nonviolent patterns of problem resolution]{.underline}.
If capitalism corrupts debate, well, then I say we save debate. (2006)
[The proper task of critics is not to retreat into speaking only from
conviction. It is to strive to expand SSD to new avenue and to make
ideas that were once considered dogma contestable]{.underline}. The very
nature of the approach acts as a counter-weight to imperialism and
"foster\[s\] resistance to domination" (Stannard 2006). Second, [switch
side debate's emphasis on tolerance and empathy, which have been noted
by many authors]{.underline} (Sanders 1982; Muir 1993; Bellon 2000; Lacy
2002), [may indeed by one of the strongest "antidotes" to the disease of
exceptionalism]{.underline} (Mitchell & Suzuki 2004, p. 7). [Debate
combines a commitment to reason and logic over emotive and political
appeals, a priority placed upon quality research, and vigorous norms of
openness and plurality to create a forum where unwarranted]{.underline}
and inappropriate forms of [exceptionalism cannot survive]{.underline}.
English et al. have referred to [this deliberative attitude as **a
"bulwark against fundamentalism of all stripes**]{.underline}" (2007, p.
224). [SSD teaches that no argument is "off limits," that issues are
more complex than black and white]{.underline}, and that reflection and
contemplation are preferable to rash and preemptive decision-making. It
is thus no surprise, as the Debate Authors Working Group has noted, that
[many of the most vocal contemporary critics of the Bush
administration's exceptionalist]{.underline} (and debatably imperialist)
**[policies, including lawyer Neal Katyal and law professor Laurence
Tribe]{.underline}**, [received a portion of their training in the
pedagogical bull-pen of debate]{.underline}. In particular, **[SSD is an
especially effective tool to combat the "with us or against us"
absolutism of contemporary neoconservative ideology]{.underline}**.
Debating both sides increases debater's appreciation of the arguments
made by the opposition (English, Llano, Mitchell, Morrison, Rief and
Woods, 2007, p. 222). Oftentimes, as is frequently the case with complex
issues, a reasonable party may conclude that two positions, which are
polar opposites may each contain an element of truth. It is revealed
that a compromised position is preferable to either extreme and that the
discrete "with us" and "against us" stances are arbitrary and inaccurate
categorizations. Finally, [switch side debate prioritizes
deliberative]{.underline}, rather than majoritarian,
[democracy]{.underline} (Lacy 2006). As far back as Day (1966), **[there
is an emphasis on the expression of minority view points.]{.underline}**
[Debating both sides allows debaters the intellectual
flexibility]{.underline} (through un-attachment to their personal
beliefs) [to express dissent and critique even the most firmly
established policies and norms]{.underline}. This ensures a vibrant
activist influence in debate [that can provide at least a modest check
against the most extreme governmental abuses.]{.underline}

Genre Violation Four: Policymaker as Impersonal and the Rhetoric of
Personal Experience. [Debate]{.underline} is a competitive game. 112 It
[requires that its participants take on the positions of state actors
(at least when they are affirming the resolution). Debate resolutions
normally call for federal action]{.underline} in some area of domestic
or foreign policy. [Affirmative teams must support the resolution, while
the negative negates it. The debate then becomes a "laboratory" within
which debaters may test policies]{.underline}. 113 Argumentation scholar
Gordon Mitchell notes that "Although they \[end page 117\] may research
and track public argument as it unfolds outside the confines of the
laboratory for research purposes, [in this approach students witness
argumentation beyond the walls of the academy **as spectators**, with
**little or no apparent recourse** to **directly participate** or
**alter the course of events**]{.underline}." 114 [Although debaters
spend a great deal of time discussing and researching government action
and articulating arguments relevant to such action, what happens in
debate rounds has **limited or no real impact** on contemporary
governmental policy making. And participation does **not** result in the
majority of the debate community engaging in activism around the issues
they research]{.underline}. Mitchell observes that [the stance of the
policymaker in debate comes with a "sense of **detachment** associated
with **the spectator posture**."]{.underline}115 In other words, [its
participants are able to engage in debates where they are able to
**distance themselves from the events that are the subjects of
debates**. Debaters can throw around terms like torture, terrorism,
genocide and nuclear war without blinking. Debate simulations can only
serve to **distance the debaters from real world participation** in the
political contexts they debate about]{.underline}. As William Shanahan
remarks: ...[the topic established a relationship through interpellation
that inhered irrespective of what the particular political affinities of
the debaters were]{.underline}. The relationship was both political and
ethical, and needed to be debated as such. [When we blithely call for
U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates [F]{.underline}ederal
[G]{.underline}overnment [policymaking, we are not immune to the
**colonialist legacy** that establishes our place on this continent. We
cannot **wish away** the horrific atrocities perpetrated **everyday in
our name** simply by refusing to acknowledge these
implications]{.underline}"(emphasis in original).116 \[end page 118\]
[The "objective" stance of the policymaker is **an impersonal or
imperialist persona**. The policymaker relies upon "acceptable" forms of
evidence, engaging in logical discussion, producing rational
thoughts]{.underline}. As Shanahan, and the Louisville debaters' note,
[such a stance is integrally linked to the **normative**, **historical**
and **contemporary practices of power** that produce and maintain
**varying networks of oppression**]{.underline}. In other words, [the
discursive practices of policy-oriented debate are developed **within**,
**through** and **from** systems of **power and privilege**. Thus, these
practices are **critically implicated in the maintenance of
hegemony**]{.underline}. So, rather than seeing themselves as government
or state actors, Jones and Green choose to perform themselves in debate,
violating the more "objective" stance of the "policymaker" and require
their opponents to do the same.

### 2NC -- AT: Plan-Focus Debate - Education

#### Rigid plans are ineffective for education 

**Sandholtz 11**[, Sandholtz, Judith Haymore. "Preservice Teachers\'
Conceptions of Effective and Ineffective Teaching Practices." Teacher
Education Quarterly, vol. 38, no. 3, 2011, pp. 27--47. JSTOR,
JSTOR,]{.underline}
[www.jstor.org/stable/23479616](http://www.jstor.org/stable/23479616)[.]{.underline}

[In other cases, the teachers didn\'t alter plans]{.underline}, but
instead attempted to complete all planned activities. As [one teacher
stated, she \"had all of these good ideas on how to enhance the lesson\"
and rushed through the activities, but later realized that \"it would
have been much more effective if I had split it up into two or three
separate lessons]{.underline}.\" [One]{.underline} preservice
[teacher]{.underline}, who finally secured a one-hour block of time to
teach a science lesson in an elementary classroom[, incorporated a
variety of teach ing strategies but later acknowledged that \"even
though the lesson was interesting to students, there was too much
information and. .. the students did not benefit much from
it]{.underline}.\" As happened with others, she ended up having to
re-teach some concepts. But [some teachers couldn\'t alter their
schedules to re-teach.]{.underline} For instance, [a
teacher]{.underline} who was required to follow the district pacing
schedule described her frustration when she realized students did not
understand the concept and she [\"could not go back and re-teach\" the
next day]{.underline} after finding an alternative strategy[. Instead,
she \"had to move on knowing they didn\'t understand.\" Another student
teacher wanted \"to include more hands-on activities and try to spend
more time on each lesson to ensure that students were grasping concepts
and were really ready to move on to the next level,\" but she was
required to teach one mathematics lesson]{.underline} from the book
[each day]{.underline}.

### 2NC -- AT: Plan-Focus Debate - Agency

#### Plan based debate relies on a topic wording that inherently gives agency and only gives power to debaters who have access to the state, and limits out a literature base of critical race studies which reaffies structures of oppression.

**Dillard-Know 2014** (Dillard-Knox, Tiffany Yvonne, \"Against the grain
: the challenges of black discourse within intercollegiate policy
debate.\" (2014). Electronic Theses and Dissertations. Paper 2161./cdc)

Historically, **[the topics that have been selected have been
constructed utilizing the active voice as opposed to a passive
voice]{.underline}**. An active voice example would be, ―Resolved: The
United States Federal Government should substantially increase statutory
and/or judicial restrictions on the war powers authority of the
President of the United States.‖ A passive voice example would be,
―Resolved: The war powers authority of the President of the United
States should be substantially restricted.‖ **[The active voice topics
require debaters to defend that the United States Federal
Government]{.underline}** ―do something‖ in a more limited capacity,
whereas a passive voice topic could allow debaters the opportunity to
defend a variety of interpretations of ―something being done‖ by or to
the United States Federal Government. **[The active voice topic always
gives the agency to act to the United States Government.]{.underline}**
For students that see themselves as having the possibility to access
these positions of power, acquiring these skills become empowering.
However, many **[marginalized students come to Debate from communities
that have historically been excluded from these positions of power.
Having a passive topic that removes the agency from the United States
Federal Government and allows debaters the flexibility to choose who has
agency thus becomes more empowering to this population of
students]{.underline}**. These students would then be more motivated to
participate in the process of 70 debate through which they can acquire a
variety of skill sets from politician to community activist. Secondly,
t**[he literature base used to construct the topic has failed to include
perspectives found within the race literature,]{.underline}** such as
the legal and political scholarship of Derrick Bell (1992), Cornel West
(1994), and bell hooks (1995). **[Very little, if any, attention has
been given to Critical Race Theory or Critical Legal Studies within the
chosen controversy areas, such as Immigration and Supreme Court
Cases]{.underline}**. **[Even when topic papers are submitted that do
include this literature, they are rarely,]{.underline}** if **[ever
selected in the voting process.]{.underline}** This is important to the
conversation of debating the topic in that the topic paper sets the
definitional guidelines of what is considered topical. If the topic
paper is limited to the language and perspective of the dominant, then
so too will the **[debates be limited to the language and perspective of
the dominant]{.underline}**. Thus, it could be argued that **[the topic
does not account for the discourse strategies of marginalized
populations and could be an additional source of exclusion from
Debate.]{.underline}**

#### The rejection of fiat in debate allows debaters to reclaim agency and empowerment in order to challenge the power structures that fiat enforces.

**Dillard-Knox 2014** (Dillard-Knox, Tiffany Yvonne, \"Against the grain
: the challenges of black discourse within intercollegiate policy
debate.\" (2014). Electronic Theses and Dissertations. Paper 2161.)

A major concept that determines strategic decisions in any given debate
is the notion of fiat and the idea of role playing. **[Fiat is a
convention whereas debaters can assume a hypothetical
implementation]{.underline}** of a particular policy. This allows
debaters to focus on whether a policy ―should‖ be adopted and avoids
discussions of whether it ―would‖ be adopted. The purpose of fiat is to
require the debaters to debate the merits of the proposition, and not
the political machinations of how one might garner the votes necessary
for enactment (Freeley and Steinberg, p. 71). **[This notion of fiat is
one place where alternative debate has broken from tradition in order to
employ strategies that focused on in-round actions rather than a
hypothetical implementation of a plan, or proposed policy action. The
debaters were no longer limited to a hypothetical testing of policies
that the United States Federal Government should or should not
enact]{.underline}**. **[Instead, the debaters began challenging the
language and presentational choices made in debates.]{.underline}**
These debaters initiated challenges to traditional concepts regarding
what constitutes valuable debate by incorporating music, drama and
personal narrative. Until recently, Debate was viewed primarily as an
academic game (Snider, 1984). While there is value in the use of game
simulation theory, **[this use of ―gaming‖ as a way to view debating,
allows one to speculate about the ―what-ifs‖ of the future while
ignoring the potential power in dealing with the right
now.]{.underline}** **[Components of alternative debate provide the
tools necessary for acknowledging and proposing solutions for the
problems of right now]{.underline}**. Advocates of alternative debate
see the activity as **[having the 19 potential to be an educational tool
of empowerment]{.underline}** (Warner and Bruschke, 2001). Participants,
who engage in debates from an alternative standpoint, view themselves
not only as players of a game, but agents of social change. This change
occurs in both form and content. In alternative debates, also known as
**[performance debate, students will utilize]{.underline}** what has
come to be called a three-tier process. The three-tier process includes
**[personal experience, organic intellectuals, and academic
intellectuals]{.underline}**. According to Nathan Abrams (1995), organic
intellectuals have four characteristics. They must be a member of an
―aggrieved community.‖ As members of an aggrieved community, they should
**[reflect the needs of that community]{.underline}**. Thirdly, they
attempt to **[challenge the power structures through the dissemination
of subversive ideas]{.underline}**. The final characteristic is that
they strive **[to construct an ―historical block---a coalition of
oppositional groups united around these subversive ideas]{.underline}**.
Academic intellectuals are academic experts in a particular field of
research whose work is published in scholarly journals, non-fiction
books, and other scholarly work, such as: theses, dissertations, and
conference papers. Bartanen (1995) has described this type of knowledge
as ―authoritative evidence from an objective source.‖ Elizabeth Jones of
the University of Louisville described the function of the three-tier
process as a method of validation: A way in which you can validate our
claims, is through the three-tier process. And we talk about personal
experience, organic intellectuals, and academic intellectuals. Let me
give you an analogy. If you place an elephant in the room and send in
\[sic\] three blind folded people into the room, and each of them are
touching a different part of the elephant. And they come back outside
and you ask each different person they gone \[sic\] have a different
idea about what they was \[sic\] talking about. But, if you let those
people converse and bring those three 20 different people together then
you can achieve a greater truth (Reid-Brinkley, 2008, p. 84). 4 **[This
method of validation allows debaters to insert experiences and voices
into debates that have traditionally been left out and/or
marginalized.]{.underline}** This concept comes from critical legal
scholar Mari Matsuda's method of ―looking to the bottom.‖ Matsuda (1987)
argues that, ―those who have experienced discrimination speak with a
special voice to which we should listen (p. 324)‖ The presentation of
argument in alternative debates can encompass the performance of rap
music, poetry, metaphors and other art forms during a round (Polson,
2012). Freeley and Steinberg quote Jones' presentation of the following
rap as a part of her affirmative case in favor of U.S. withdrawal from
NATO: Roma people feel just like me, tired of being deprived of their
liberty. Relegated to ghettos, held as slaves, poor health care leading
to early graves. Prison scars, from prison bars, walking round the
prison yard. No running water, no heat, no jobs, and everything you've
seemed to love, you've lost. While the rich get richer, who's paying the
cost? George Soros, Bill Clinton, to Dick Cheney, the so-called bearers
of democracy. NATO represents the military wing, of the all-powerful
capitalist regime. While you think gangsters listen to rap and sag, They
really wear suits and carry leather bags. Politicians with the power to
pick, define, and choose who will win and who will lose. Not hearing the
Roma or Palestine, I guess it depends how genocide is defined (p.233)5 .
4 Alternative framework used by the University of Louisville and
explanation of that framework as cited by Shanara Reid-Brinkley (2008),
taken from a video of a debate speech given by Elizabeth Jones. Emory
University Vs. University of Louisville, Double-Octa-Finals Ceda
Nationals: Second Negative Rebuttal (Louisville, KY: 2004). 5 Spoken
word piece written by Elizabeth Jones as part of her 1AC. 21 While this
form of presentation is representative of a cultural art form, it is not
limited to just art for art's sake. According to Polson, the use of
musical and narrative forms in performance debate exemplifies a type of
meta-information. An example of this can be seen in the excerpt above.
Jones uses spoken word, not only as a performative piece, but also to
describe the similarities of the relationship of some Blacks with
American institutions to the relationship of the Roma people with NATO
(North Atlantic Treaty Organization). These similarities are not
connections that are easily recognized by outsiders of either
subordinate group. Secondly, Jones plays on the word ―gangsters.‖
Instead of what people typically thinks of as a gangster, she applies it
to politicians. The visual that she creates with her description of
gangsters ―wearing suits and carrying leather bags‖ as opposed to
―listen(ing) to rap and sag(ging),‖ is part of the metainformation that
Polson has articulated. Polson goes on to say, ―the form provides
instruction to the listener about how to perceive and interpret the
debate (p. 16).‖ The relationship that is created within Jones' spoken
word piece, informs the judge that there are more ways to discuss
justifying the United States Federal Government's ―full withdrawal from
NATO‖ than by any singular understanding of the topic, as framed by the
authors of the topic paper.

### 2NC -- AT: Plan-Focus Debate - Activism

#### Modes of activism and engagement for youths have been limited by the affirmative's plan text-state based methods

#### **Kennelly 09** (Jacqueline Kennelly (2009) Good Citizen/Bad Activist: The Cultural Role of the State in Youth Activism, The Review of Education, Pedagogy, and Cultural Studies , page 144-145, \< <https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/figure/10.1080/10714410902827135?scroll=top&needAccess=true>\>)

The production and regulation of the good citizen within the Canadian
state is accomplished through a variety of cultural means, which emanate
from schooling and also extend beyond its bound- aries. The possibility
for active participation within the state, while explicated as an ideal
of the new civics curricula, comes with a set of limits and expectations
about what such participation looks like. **[Drawing on histories of
liberalism and current ideologies of neoliberalism, the active citizen
of contemporary civics curricula is one who engages with the state
through self-regulated acts of responsible citizenship that are limited
to individual encounters with the electoral process, charitable
community work, and=or participation through formal aspects of the
political system, such as official parties]{.underline}.** This article
has also sought to demonstrate how histories of racism and classism
continue to shape the experiences of young people attempting to take up
concepts and practices of citizenship. The submerged cultural messages
that young people encounter provide evidence for them that the rewards
and benefits of such participation are aligned with stratifications of
class and race. Although the experiences of working class, Aboriginal
and racialized young people are diverse, participants' reflections
within this research project highlight the ways in which their
experiences within the school system and among their peers can reinforce
the belief that the forms of belonging to be found within the idea of
the good citizen is not for them. This is because **[good
citizenship]{.underline}**, as it is elaborated within the cultural
sphere, **[continues to be heavily regulated and governed through the
languages and contingent discourses of normative liberal
principles]{.underline}**, which are in turn grounded within a history
of symbolic domination that perpetuates class and race disadvantages.
[Even those who venture into the realm of activism receive their warning
about where the limits to legitimate citizenship lie. Through practices
of policing and the justice system, young people are given a clear
message about the boundaries of permissible citizenship.]{.underline}
What is of interest, I would suggest, is that the recent rise in civics
curricula across Western liberal democratic states (including Canada)
indicates some degree of uncertainty about how well the state is
managing to encourage the appropriate self- regulation of its own
citizens. Particularly in the face of **[policy
priorities]{.underline}** that have resulted in growing disparities
between rich and poor, alongside the ever-increasing policing of borders
that have emerged in the post--9=11 world, perhaps the recent increase
in civics education ought to be understood, at least in part, as a form
of governance that is intended to quell the emergent strands of critique
that saw their expression through the mass mobilizations in Seattle,
Quebec, and elsewhere. It is perhaps indicative of the urgency of our
times that the cultural space within which young activists
work---permeated by state norms and heavily policed---functions as a
form of containment for any dissident expression that threatens to
undermine state legitimacy. It thus **[counters the potential for
activism to generate a more diverse and democratic public sphere, an
unfortunate consequence in a time where all creative energies are
required to resolve the dilemmas we currently face.]{.underline}**

#### Debates about critical pedagogy and activism are vital to stopping [anti-democratic norms]{.underline} --- addresses [argumentative agency]{.underline} and leads to [real change.]{.underline}

[Extreme power is now showcased through the mechanisms of
ever-proliferating cultural/educational apparatuses and the anti-public
intellectuals who support them and are in turn rewarded by the elites
who finance such apparatuses.]{.underline} The war at home is made
visible in the show of force aimed at civilian populations, including
students, workers, and others considered disposable or a threat to the
new authoritarianism. [Its most powerful allies appear to be the
intellectuals, institutions, cultural apparatuses and new media
technologies that constitute the sites of public pedagogy, which produce
the formative culture necessary for authoritarianism to thrive. While a
change in consciousness does not guarantee a change in either one\'s
politics or society]{.underline}, it is a crucial precondition for
connecting what it means to think otherwise to conditions that make it
possible to act otherwise. The education deficit must be seen as
intertwined with a political deficit, serving to make many oppressed
individuals complicit with oppressive ideologies. As the late Cornelius
Castoriadis made clear, democracy requires \"critical thinkers capable
of putting existing institutions into question\.... while simultaneously
creating the conditions for individual and social autonomy.\"(41)
[Nothing will change politically or economically until new and emerging
social movements take seriously the need to develop a language of
radical reform and create new public spheres that support the knowledge,
skills and critical thought that are necessary features of a democratic
formative culture. Getting beyond the big lie as a precondition for
critical thought, civic engagement and a more realized democracy will
mean more than correcting distortions, misrepresentations and falsehoods
produced by politicians, media talking heads and anti-public
intellectuals.]{.underline} It will also require addressing how new
sites of pedagogy have become central to any viable notion of agency,
politics and democracy itself. This is not a matter of elevating
cultural politics over material relations of power as much as it is a
rethinking of how power deploys culture and how culture as a mode of
education positions power. James Baldwin, the legendary African-American
writer and civil rights activist, argued that the big lie points to a
crisis of American identity and politics and is symptomatic of \"a
backward society\" that has descended into madness, \"especially when
one is forced to lie about one\'s aspect of anybody\'s history,
\[because you then\] must lie about it all.\"(42) He goes on to argue
\"that one of the paradoxes of education \[is\] that precisely at the
point when you begin to develop a conscience, you must find yourself at
war with your society. It is your responsibility to change society if
you think of yourself as an educated person.\"(43) What Baldwin
recognizes is that learning has the possibility to trigger a critical
engagement with oneself, others and the larger society education becomes
in this instance more than a method or tool for domination but a
politics, a fulcrum for democratic social change. Tragically, in our
current climate \"learning\" merely contributes to a vast reserve of
manipulation and self-inflicted ignorance. [Our education deficit is
neither reducible to the failure of particular types of teaching nor the
decent into madness by the spokespersons for the new authoritarianism.
Rather, it is about how matters of knowledge, values and ideology can be
struggled over as issues of power and politics. Surviving the current
education deficit will depend on progressives using history, memory and
knowledge not only to reconnect intellectuals to the everyday needs of
ordinary people, but also to jumpstart social movements by making
education central to organized politics and the quest for a radical
democracy.]{.underline}

**Active participation and genuine cooperation do not occur through
fiat, their framework crushes democracy and interconnectedness,

**[As social analysts have pointed out, the dominant philosophical and
political discourses in the United States reflect and reinforce a
perspective that Nancy Hartsock calls \"the standpoint of exchange\":
these discourses constitute human beings as fundamentally separate,
prudential, interest-driven monads who pursue their own self-chosen
conception of the good life and who interact with one another only when
there is a momentary convergence of interest]{.underline}** (1985,
chap.2). Because of the dominance of \"the standpoint of exchange\" in
U.S. American culture, not surprisingly we are particularly susceptible
to counterfeit claims of community. According to John Freie,
\"\[l\]acking genuine community, yet longing for the meaning and sense
of connectedness that it creates, feeling of community? people become
vulnerable to even the merest suggestion of community\" and to mistaking
the /feeling/ of connectedness or community for the genuine article
(1998, 2[). Although the feeling of connectedness is necessary to
communal bonds and identity, this emotional dimension is not sufficient:
community is \"an interlocking pattern of just human relationships in
which people have at least a minimal sense of consensus within a
definable territory]{.underline}. People within a community actively
participate and cooperate with others to create their own self-worth, a
sense of caring about others, and a feeling for the spirit of
connectedness\" (Freie 1998, 23). [What bears emphasizing here is that
active participation and genuine cooperation do not happen by verbal
fiat; in order for social interactions to be substantively (and not
merely abstractly) dialogical and democratic, the heterogeneity of human
viewpoints, interests, and desires must be recognized?and this, in turn,
requires allowing for the epistemic significance of social
divisions.]{.underline} More specifically, it necessitates
acknowledging, on the one hand, the inescapably \*\[End Page 176\]\*
[limited, partial, and socially embedded perspectives of human
deliberators and, on the other hand, the role that social, political,
and economic power plays in the abilities of dominant social groups to
create defining discourses and in the abilities of subordinated groups
to resist the use of marginalizing or subjugating discourses and to
create discourses that give voice to their experiences, interests, and
needs in an authentic way. Unless the concrete social and institutional
conditions and constraints that govern communicative interactions are
themselves subject to on-going thematization, critique, and change, and
until, therefore, members of subordinated groups are able to represent
their experiences, interests, and needs in a non-distorted,
non-repressed way]{.underline} (Arnault 1989), [whatever feelings of
cohesion, solidarity, and connectedness have been generated in any given
situation will ultimately be counterfeit.]{.underline}

#### Traditional debate revolves around discourse that distances the reality of suffering and violence, narratives in debate allow for inclusion of minority perspectives

**Dillard-Knox 14** (Dillard-Knox, Tiffany Yvonne, \"Against the grain :
the challenges of black discourse within intercollegiate policy
debate.\" (2014). Electronic Theses and Dissertations. Paper 2161./cdc)

There are three types of arguments that Zompetti (2004) used to define
personalized arguments: ―**[traditional debate excludes certain types of
evidence]{.underline}**, traditional debate **[privileges affluent
individuals, and]{.underline}** traditional debate **[ignores the
reality of many individuals who are already at a disadvantage in the
activity]{.underline}** (p.28).‖ The first 62 argument type, that
―debate excludes certain types of evidence,‖ maintains that **[the
Debate community values academic evidence and devalues other forms of
knowledge]{.underline}** that come from what Antonio Gramsci (1978)
calls organic intellectuals. The type of organic intellectuals being
referred to here are the ones that Gramsci identifies as the permanent
persuaders, a group of organic intellectuals that grows within the
subordinated class(es). He goes on to state, ―Organic intellectuals in
the subordinated class(es) are defined by social function rather than
the characteristics of formal education, cultural distinction, or social
status (p. 42).‖ **[Alternative debaters]{.underline}** have introduced
some forms of hip hop as a source of organic intellectualism that
**[provides a perspective that is counter to that of the dominant
ideological constructs of the world]{.underline}**. The second argument
type argues that ―traditional debate privileges affluent individuals.‖
This argument encompasses things associated with material privileges.
Some of the material privileges include things such as the financial
costs associated with attending debate camps, travelling to a large
number of national tournaments, access to the amount of ―free time‖ to
prepare for debate tournaments in order to be nationally competitive,
etc. As mentioned above, learning the language of Debate requires
extensive training, debate camp is one of the mechanisms used to train
debaters but camps generally cost between \$1500-3000 to attend.
Additionally, competitive success typically depends upon one's ability
to travel to the national circuit tournaments. The reasoning is that the
best of the best compete at these tournaments, as opposed to the
regional tournament circuit. Lastly, debaters spend anywhere from 40-100
hours per week in preparation for tournaments. Unfortunately, there are
many debaters who have 63 academic, familial and work obligations
outside of Debate that prohibit them from being able to commit that
amount of time towards preparing for debates. Finally, the argument that
―debate ignores the reality of many individuals who are already at a
disadvantage in the activity‖ makes claims about the way that
traditional debate does not allow for the implications that race, class,
gender, sexuality, and disability can have on how Debate, in general,
and debate tournaments, more specifically, function. These arguments
typically make claims about what types of perspectives and Debate norms
develop from positions of privilege. Tim Wise (2005) while discussing
his experiences in Debate argues that **[Debate is an ―extraordinarily
white‖ activity]{.underline}** (p. 69). He goes on to state, the reason
that I call this process a white one is **[because white people (and
especially affluent ones), much more so than folks of color, have the
luxury of looking at life or death issues of war, peace, famine,
unemployment or criminal justice as a game, a mere exercise in
intellectual and rhetorical banter...kids of color and working class
youth of all colors are simply not as likely to gravitate to an activity
where pretty much half the time they'll be forced to take positions
that, if implemented in the real world, might devastate their
communities]{.underline}** (p. 71-72). These three argument types are
usually made by debaters identifying themselves as being affected by
these patterns of exclusion. Thus, it is believed by debate scholars
that these debaters are using their ―victimage‖ to gain a competitive
advantage in debate rounds (Zompetti, 2004. p. 30). These scholars have
argued that these narratives of exclusion are not contestable because
one cannot effectively debate another's personal experience. Recalling
Smitherman's definition of narrative sequencing, as the relating of
events (real or hypothetical) to explain a point, to persuade holders of
opposing views to one's own point of view, and in general to ―win
friends and influence people‖ (p. 148), 64 **[narratives should be
considered valuable components of debate strategy and
technique]{.underline}**. However, while these scholars acknowledge
these narratives as important, they fail to accurately understand and
portray the function of these narratives, thus missing the value in
using narratives in debates. The sociolinguistics literature offers an
alternative perspective for understanding the function of these
narrative discourses. While most Debate scholars would argue that these
narratives in debate only serve as personal testimony, or complaints of
oppression, the sociolinguistic literature surrounding identity and
language would suggest that **[these narratives are ways of positioning
the self in the context of a larger interactional scheme.]{.underline}**
Therefore, as Bucholtz and Hall (2005) suggests, when approaching
identity---in Debate---to ―consider a relational and sociocultural
phenomenon (p. 585). This phenomenon emerges and circulates in discourse
contexts of interaction rather than as a stable structure located
primarily in the individual psyche or in fixed social categories (p.
586).‖ **[Conceptualizing personalized arguments in this way allows one
to understand that all language interactions in debates communicate at
least part of one's identity, whether it is explicit or implicit.
Therefore, debates are always ―personal‖. However, criticizing one group
of students for positioning their arguments within a larger social,
political, or cultural context creates an unfair barrier for inclusion
into Debate for that group.]{.underline}**

Consider the following true stories: 1. Anne Cameron, [a]{.underline}
very gifted [white Canadian author, writes]{.underline} several [first
person]{.underline} accounts of the lives [of Native Canadian
women]{.underline}. At the 1988 International Feminist Book Fair in
Montreal, [a group of Native Canadian writers ask Cameron
to]{.underline}, in their words, \"[move over]{.underline}\" on the
grounds [that her writings are disempowering for Native
authors]{.underline}. She agrees.2 2. After the 1989 elections in Panama
are overturned by Manuel Noriega, [U.S. President]{.underline} George
[Bush declares]{.underline} in a public address that Noriega\'s actions
constitute an \"outrageous fraud\" and that \"[the voice of the
Panamanian people have spoken.]{.underline}\" \"The Panamanian people,\"
he tells us, \"want democracy [and]{.underline} not tyranny, and want
Noriega out.\" He [proceeds to]{.underline} plan [the invasion of
Panama]{.underline}. 3. At a recent symposium at my university, a
prestigious theorist was invited to give a lecture on the political
problems of post-modernism. Those of us in the audience, including many
white women and people of oppressed nationalities and races, wait in
eager anticipation for what he has to contribute to this important
discussion. To our disappointment, he introduces his lecture by
explaining that he can not cover the assigned topic, because as a white
male he does not feel that he can speak for the feminist and
post-colonial perspectives which have launched the critical
interrogation of postmodernism\'s politics. He lectures instead on
architecture. [These examples demonstrate the range of current practices
of speaking for others in our society]{.underline}. While the
prerogative of speaking for others remains unquestioned in the citadels
of colonial administration, among activists and in the academy it
elicits a growing unease and, in some communities of discourse, it is
being rejected. [There is a strong]{.underline}, albeit contested,
[current within feminism which holds that speaking for
others]{.underline}\-\--even for other women\-\--is arrogant, vain,
[unethical, and]{.underline} politically [illegitimate. Feminist
scholarship]{.underline} has a liberatory agenda which [almost
requires]{.underline} that [women]{.underline} scholars [speak on behalf
of other women]{.underline}, and yet the dangers of speaking across
differences of race, culture, sexuality, and power are becoming
increasingly clear to all. In feminist magazines such as Sojourner, it
is common to find articles and letters in which the author states that
she can only speak for herself. In her important paper, \"Dyke
Methods,\" Joyce Trebilcot offers a philosophical articulation of this
view. She renounces for herself the practice of [speaking for
others]{.underline} within a lesbian feminist community, arguing that
she \"will not try to get other wimmin to accept my beliefs in place of
their own\" on the grounds that to do so [would be to practice a kind of
discursive coercion and even a violence]{.underline}.3 Feminist
discourse is not the only site in which the problem of speaking for
others has been acknowledged and addressed. [In
anthropology]{.underline} there is similar discussion about whether it
is possible to speak for others either adequately or justifiably. Trinh
T. Minh-ha explains the grounds for skepticism when she says that
anthropology [is]{.underline} \"mainly [a conversation of \`us\' with
\`us\' about \`them,\' of the white man]{.underline} with the white man
about the primitive-nature man\...[in which \`them\' is
silenced]{.underline}. \`Them\' always stands on the other side of the
hill, naked and speechless\...\`them\' is only admitted among \`us\',
the discussing subjects, when accompanied or introduced by an
\`us\'\...\"4 Given this analysis, [even ethnographies written by
progressive anthropologists are]{.underline} a priori
[regressive]{.underline} because of the structural features of
anthropological discursive practice. The recognition that there is a
problem in speaking for others has followed from the widespread
acceptance of two claims. First, [there has been a growing awareness
that where one speaks from affects both the meaning and truth of what
one says]{.underline}, and thus that one cannot assume an ability to
transcend her location. In other words, [a speaker\'s
location]{.underline} (which I take here to refer to her social location
or social identity) [has an epistemically significant impact on that
speaker\'s claims, and can serve either to authorize or dis-authorize
one\'s]{.underline} The Problem of Speaking For Others
http://alcoff.com/content/speaothers.html 3 of 26 1/30/08 11:09 AM
[speech]{.underline}. The creation of Women\'s Studies and African
American Studies departments were founded on this very belief: that both
[the study of and the advocacy for the oppressed must come to be done
principally by the oppressed themselves]{.underline}, and that we must
finally acknowledge that systematic divergences in social location
between speakers and those spoken for will have a significant effect on
the content of what is said. The unspoken premise here is simply that a
speaker\'s location is epistemically salient. I shall explore this issue
further in the next section. The second claim holds that not only is
location epistemically salient, but certain [privileged locations
are]{.underline} discursively dangerous.5 In particular, the practice of
privileged persons speaking for or on behalf of less privileged persons
has actually resulted (in many cases) in [increasing]{.underline} or
reenforcing [the]{.underline} oppression of the [group spoken
for]{.underline}. This was part of the argument made against Anne
Cameron\'s speaking for Native women: Cameron\'s intentions were never
in question, but the effects of her writing were argued to be harmful to
the needs of Native authors because it is Cameron rather than they who
will be listened to and whose books will be bought by readers interested
in Native women. [Persons from dominant groups who speak for others are
often treated as authenticating presences that confer legitimacy and
credibility on the demands of subjugated speakers; such speaking for
others does nothing to disrupt the discursive hierarchies that operate
in public spaces.]{.underline} For this reason, the work of privileged
authors who speak on behalf of the oppressed is becoming increasingly
criticized by members of those oppressed groups themselves.6 As social
theorists, [we are authorized by virtue of our academic positions to
develop theories that express and encompass the ideas, needs, and goals
of others.]{.underline}

#### Accurate representation becomes skewed when speaking for others

**Alcoff 91** - (Linda Alcoff, "The Problem of Speaking for Others",
*Cultural Critique,* pp.5-32) \<
https://www.jstor.org/stable/1354221?item_view=read_online&refreqid=excelsior%3A1d2ad6f025cbcbae6e9264496e578d7c\>)

However, we must begin to ask ourselves whether this is ever a
legitimate authority, and if so, what are the criteria for legitimacy?
In particular, is it ever valid to speak for others who are unlike me or
who are less privileged than me? We might try to delimit this problem as
only arising when a more privileged person speaks for a less privileged
one. In this case, we might say that I should only speak for groups of
which I am a member. But this does not tell us how groups themselves
should be delimited. For example, can a white woman speak for all women
simply by virtue of being a woman? If not, how narrowly should we draw
the The Problem of Speaking For Others
http://alcoff.com/content/speaothers.html 4 of 26 1/30/08 11:09 AM
categories? The complexity and multiplicity of group identifications
could result in \"communities\" composed of single individuals.
Moreover, the concept of groups assumes specious notions about clear-cut
boundaries and \"pure\" identities. I am a Panamanian-American and a
person of mixed ethnicity and race: half white/Angla and half Panamanian
mestiza. The criterion of group identity leaves many unanswered
questions for a person such as myself, since I have membership in many
conflicting groups but my membership in all of them is problematic.
[Group identities and boundaries are ambiguous and permeable, and
decisions about demarcating identity are always partly
arbitrary.]{.underline} Another problem concerns how specific an
identity needs to be to confer epistemic authority. Reflection on such
problems quickly reveals that no easy solution to the problem of
speaking for others can be found by simply restricting the practice to
speaking for groups of which one is a member. Adopting the position that
one should only speak for oneself raises similarly difficult questions.
If I don\'t speak for those less privileged than myself, am I abandoning
my political responsibility to speak out against oppression, a
responsibility incurred by the very fact of my privilege? If I should
not speak for others, should I restrict myself to following their lead
uncritically? Is my greatest contribution to move over and get out of
the way? And if so, what is the best way to do this\-\--to keep silent
or to deconstruct my own discourse? The answers to these questions will
certainly depend on who is asking them. While some of us may want to
undermine, for example, the U.S. government\'s practice of speaking for
the \"Third world,\" we may not want to undermine someone such as
Rigoberta Menchu\'s ability to speak for Guatemalan Indians.7 So the
question arises about whether all instances of speaking for should be
condemned and, if not, how we can justify a position which would
repudiate some speakers while accepting others. In order to answer these
questions [we need to become clearer on the epistemological and
metaphysical issues which are involved in the articulation of the
problem of speaking for others]{.underline}, issues which most often
remain implicit. I will attempt to make these issues clear before
turning to discuss some of the possible responses to the problem and
advancing a provisional, procedural solution of my own. But first I need
to explain further my framing of the problem. The Problem of Speaking
For Others http://alcoff.com/content/speaothers.html 5 of 26 1/30/08
11:09 AM In the examples used above, there may appear to be a conflation
between the issue of speaking for others and the issue of speaking about
others. This conflation was intentional on my part, because [it is
difficult to distinguish speaking about from speaking for in all
cases]{.underline}. There is an ambiguity in the two phrases: when one
is speaking for another one may be describing their situation and thus
also speaking about them. In fact, it may be impossible to speak for
another without simultaneously conferring information about them.
Similarly, [when one is speaking about another, or]{.underline} simply
trying to [describe their situation]{.underline} or some aspect of it,
[one may also be]{.underline} speaking in place of them, i.e. [speaking
for them]{.underline}. One may be speaking about another as an advocate
or a messenger if the person cannot speak for herself. Thus I would
maintain that if [the practice of speaking for others is problematic, so
too]{.underline} must be [the practice of speaking about
others.]{.underline}8 This is partly the case because of what has been
called [the \"crisis of representation]{.underline}.\" For in both the
practice of speaking for as well as the practice of speaking about
others, I am [engaging in]{.underline} the act of [representing the
other\'s needs, goals, situation, and]{.underline} in fact, [who they
are]{.underline}, based on my own situated interpretation. In
post-structuralist terms, I am [participating in the construction of
their subject-positions rather than simply discovering their true
selves]{.underline}. Once we pose it as a problem of representation, we
see that, not only are speaking for and speaking about analytically
close, so too are the practices of speaking for others and speaking for
myself. For, in speaking for myself, I am also representing my self in a
certain way, as occupying a specific subject-position, having certain
characteristics and not others, and so on. In speaking for myself, I
(momentarily) create my self\-\--just as much as when I speak for others
I create them as a public, discursive self, a self which is more unified
than any subjective experience can support. And this public self will in
most cases have an effect on the self experienced as interiority. The
point here is that the problem of representation underlies all cases of
speaking for, whether I am speaking for myself or for others. This is
not to suggest that all representations are fictions: they have very
real material effects, as well as material origins, but they are always
mediated in complex ways by discourse, power, and location. However, the
problem of speaking for others is more specific than the problem of
representation generally, and requires its own The Problem of Speaking
For Others http://alcoff.com/content/speaothers.html 6 of 26 1/30/08
11:09 AM particular analysis. There is one final point I want to make
before we can pursue this analysis. The way I have articulated this
problem may imply that individuals make conscious choices about their
discursive practice free of ideology and the constraints of material
reality. This is not what I wish to imply. [The problem of speaking for
others is a social one, the options available to us are socially
constructed, and the practices we engage in cannot be understood as
simply the results of autonomous individual choice.]{.underline} Yet to
replace both \"I\" and \"we\" with a passive voice that erases agency
results in [an erasure of responsibility and accountability for one\'s
speech]{.underline}, an erasure I would strenuously argue against (there
is too little responsibility-taking already in Western practice!). When
we sit down to write, or get up to speak, we experience ourselves as
making choices. We may experience hesitation from fear of being
criticized or from fear of exacerbating a problem we would like to
remedy, or we may experience a resolve to speak despite existing
obstacles, but in many cases we experience having the possibility to
speak or not to speak. On the one hand, a theory which explains this
experience as involving autonomous choices free of material structures
would be false and ideological, but on the other hand, if we do not
acknowledge the activity of choice and the experience of individual
doubt, we are denying a reality of our experiential lives.9 So I see the
argument of this paper as addressing that small space of discursive
agency we all experience, however multi-layered, fictional, and
constrained it in fact is. Ultimately, the question of speaking for
others bears crucially on the possibility of political effectivity.
[Both collective action and coalitions would seem to require the
possibility of speaking for]{.underline}. Yet influential postmodernists
such as Gilles Deleuze have characterized as \"absolutely fundamental:
[the indignity of speaking for others]{.underline}\"10 and important
feminist theorists have renounced the practice as [irretrievably
harmful]{.underline}. What is at stake in rejecting or validating
speaking for others as a discursive practice? To answer this, we must
become clearer on the epistemological and metaphysical claims which are
implicit in the articulation of the problem. I. The Problem of Speaking

#### The position of a speaker can change the meaning or distort the context of what they are speaking about

**Alcoff 91** - (Linda Alcoff, "The Problem of Speaking for Others",
*Cultural Critique,* pp.5-32) \<
https://www.jstor.org/stable/1354221?item_view=read_online&refreqid=excelsior%3A1d2ad6f025cbcbae6e9264496e578d7c\>)

Critical theory, discourses of empowerment, psychoanalytic theory,
post-structuralism, feminist and anti-colonialist theories have all
concurred on this point. Who is speaking to whom turns out to be as
important for meaning and truth as what is said; in fact [what is said
turns out to change according to who is speaking and who is
listening]{.underline}. Following Foucault, I will call these \"rituals
of speaking\" to identify discursive practices of speaking or writing
which involve not only the text or utterance but their position within a
social space which includes the persons involved in, acting upon, and/or
affected by the words. Two elements within these rituals will deserve
our attention: [the positionality or location of the speaker and the
discursive context. We]{.underline} can take the latter to [refer to the
connections and relations of involvement between the utterance/text
and]{.underline} other utterances and texts as well as [the material
practices]{.underline} in the relevant environment, which should not be
confused with an environment spatially adjacent to the particular
discursive event. [Rituals of speaking are constitutive of
meaning]{.underline}, the meaning of the words spoken as well as the
meaning of the event. This claim requires us to shift the ontology of
meaning from its location in a text or utterance to a larger space, a
space which includes the text or utterance but which also includes the
discursive context. And an important implication of this claim is that
meaning must be understood as plural and shifting, since a single text
can engender diverse meanings given diverse contexts. Not only what is
emphasized, noticed, and how it is understood will be affected by the
location of both speaker and hearer, but the truth-value or epistemic
status will also be affected. **[For example, in many situations when a
woman speaks the presumption is against her; when a man speaks he is
usually taken seriously]{.underline}** (unless his speech patterns mark
him as socially inferior by dominant standards). When writers from
oppressed races and nationalities have insisted that all writing is
political the claim has been dismissed as foolish or grounded in
ressentiment or it is simply ignored; when prestigious European
philosophers say that all writing is political it is taken up as a new
and original \"truth\" (Judith Wilson calls this \"the intellectual
equivalent of the \`cover The Problem of Speaking For Others
http://alcoff.com/content/speaothers.html 8 of 26 1/30/08 11:09 AM
record\'.\")11 [The rituals of speaking which involve the location of
speaker and listeners affect whether a claim is taken as true,
well-reasoned, a compelling argument, or a significant
idea]{.underline}. Thus, how what is said gets heard depends on who says
it, and who says it will affect the style and language in which it is
stated**[. The discursive style in which some European
post-structuralists have made the claim that all writing is political
marks it as important and likely to be true for a certain (powerful)
milieu; whereas the style in which African-American writers made the
same claim marked their speech as dismissable in the eyes of the same
milieu]{.underline}**. This point might be conceded by those who admit
to the political mutability of interpretation, but they might continue
to maintain that truth is a different matter altogether. And they would
be right that [acknowledging the effect of location on meaning and even
on whether something is taken as true within a particular discursive
context does not entail that the \"actual\" truth of the claim is
contingent upon its context.]{.underline} However, this objection
presupposes a particular conception of truth, one in which the truth of
a statement can be distinguished from its interpretation and its
acceptance. Such a concept would require truth to be independent of the
speakers\' or listeners\' embodied and perspectival location. Thus, the
question of whether location bears simply on what is taken to be true or
what is really true, and whether such a distinction can be upheld,
involves the very difficult problem of the meaning of truth. In the
history of Western philosophy, there have existed multiple, competing
definitions and ontologies of truth: correspondence, idealist,
pragmatist, coherentist, and consensual notions. The dominant modernist
view has been that truth represents a relationship of correspondence
between a proposition and an extra-discursive reality. On this view,
truth is about a realm completely independent of human action and
expresses things \"as they are in themselves,\" that is, free of human
interpretation. Arguably since Kant, more obviously since Hegel, it has
been widely accepted that an understanding of truth which requires it to
be free of human interpretation leads inexorably to skepticism, since it
makes truth inaccessible by definition. This created an impetus to
reconfigure the ontology of truth, from a locus outside human
interpretation to one within it. Hegel, for example, understood truth as
an \"identity in difference\" between subjective and objective elements.

### 2NC -- AT: Deliberative Democracy

#### Deliberative democracy uses the façade of [pseudo-participation]{.underline} to disregard the perspectives of marginalized communities, [limit]{.underline} the alternatives under consideration, and further [hegemonic discourse]{.underline}

**Kadlec and Friedman 7** (Alison Kadlec, visiting professor in the

To critics such as Iris Marion Young and Lynn Sanders, most versions of
**[deliberative democracy]{.underline}** fail doubly. Because they
**[reproduce undemocratic power relations]{.underline}** that beleaguer
our larger society, [they are neither]{.underline} sufficiently
[inclusive to be democratic nor meaningful enough to be genuinely
deliberative]{.underline}. The specifics of their critiques are
instructive. Young, for instance, argues that: • First, [in the real
world of politics, "powerful elites representing structurally dominant
social segments have significant influence over political processes and
decisions]{.underline}." [Therefore, **deliberation is a luxury to which
only political elites have access**]{.underline} and, given the
structural inequalities, **[why should disempowered
individuals]{.underline}** and groups be asked to **[trust so-called
"rational dialogue" with those in whose interest it is to perpetuate
unjust economic and political arrangements]{.underline}**? • Second,
while those deliberative settings that are obviously exclusionary are
troubling, more pernicious yet are the claims that formal inclusion in
deliberative processes guarantee that all voices will be heard.
[Deliberation is always structurally biased in favor of those with
greater resources and power]{.underline} and to pretend otherwise is
morally specious. • Third, [even if legitimate deliberative settings
were to emerge]{.underline} against these odds, "[existing social and
economic structures have set unacceptable constraints on the terms of
deliberation]{.underline} and its agenda." On **[what terms are
underserved communities to expect that deliberation will accomplish
anything substantive if, for example, the constraints imposed by federal
law make it impossible to administer policies that embody a commitment
to]{.underline}** social **[and economic justice]{.underline}**? •
Finally, even if deliberative democracy is able to redress the problem
of constrained alternatives by proposing the creation of deliberative
settings free from "the immediacy of the given economic imperatives and
power structures," free inquiry is still not possible given that those
deliberating are entrenched in a hegemonic discourse "which itself is a
complex product of structural inequality." (Young, 2003: 108-15) Lynn
Sanders adds to these points that **[an ironic antidemocratic appeal is
at work in the undergirding principles of deliberative democracy
itself]{.underline}**. In her view, [the rules governing deliberation
are steeped in an]{.underline} aristocratic, [elitist tradition in which
legitimate democratic discussion must be calm, rational, moderate, and
guided by mutual respect.5 And this,]{.underline} says Sanders[, is
culturally biased in favor of those with greater resources]{.underline}
and power **[because deliberative democracy fails to take into account
the differences in]{.underline}** status and **[hierarchy that shape how
we communicate]{.underline}**. Therefore, Taking **[deliberation as a
signal of democratic practice paradoxically works
undemocratically]{.underline}**, [discrediting on seemingly democratic
grounds the views of those who are less likely to present their
arguments in ways that we recognize as characteristically
deliberative.]{.underline} In our political culture, [these citizens are
likely to be those who are already underrepresented in formal political
institutions and who are systematically materially
disadvantaged]{.underline}, **[namely women; racial minorities,
especially Blacks; and poorer people]{.underline}**. (Sanders, 1997:
349) While "insidious prejudices" may incline those with more power to
discount the arguments of those with less, more problematic yet is the
possibility that [because of the subtlety of this kind of exercise of
power "this prejudice may be unrecognized by those citizens whose views
are disregarded as well as by other citizens]{.underline}"---i.e.,
[marginalized citizens may themselves internalize and accept such
"insidious prejudices" as norms]{.underline}, and thereby fail to see
the ways in which their interests are violated or eclipsed (Sanders,
1997: 353). Thus, in addition to more or less formal and obvious forms
of exclusion that undermine deliberation, "[**hegemonic discourse**" can
constrain the alternatives under consideration and even manipulate the
least powerful in ways that violate their interests in virtually
undetectable ways.]{.underline}6 What if, then, deliberative democracy
excludes under the guise of inclusion and stifles the perception of
legitimate grievances while making essentially empty gestures toward
free and open inquiry? The practical result, say critics like Sanders,
is that both participatory democrats and democratic elitists are
satisfied; the former can imagine that citizens are being included in a
process of grappling with common problems, while the latter can be
comforted with the knowledge that the rules of the game are rigged to
prevent the inclusion and/or effective participation of non-elites. Such
concerns cast light on the extent to which much that passes for
deliberation can actually marginalize and even exclude the perspectives
of those individuals and groups who are already at a disadvantage, such
as minorities, women and the poor. The concern is that **[in a society
that is structured by deep inequalities, such as ours, formal inclusion,
even when it exists, is not enough to guarantee everyone the opportunity
to deliberate as equals]{.underline}** [because the more powerful
interests always have greater influence in the deliberative
process.]{.underline} From this perspective, then, [deliberative
democracy suffers fundamental problems of legitimacy. Worse, yet, it
masks those problems behind a façade of
pseudoparticipation]{.underline}.

#### Deliberative Democracy is constrained by officially sanctioned frameworks and has [minimal influence]{.underline} on genuine power politics

**Kadlec and Friedman 7** (Alison Kadlec, visiting professor in the
political science department at Macalester College and an adjunct
professor in the political science departments at the University of
Minnesota, Baruch College and Hunter College, Will Friedman, Ph.D. is
the president of Public Agenda, a nonprofit, nonpartisan organization,

Social intelligence is not stimulated in a political vacuum; rather, it
is largely brought into being as citizens confront common problems.
Therefore, while the development of social intelligence will be an
indispensable feature of any enduring process of change, the ongoing
expanding and maturing of civic capacity must be accompanied by a range
of concrete opportunities to effect real change in specific situations
in the near-term. Indeed, **[without the promise of concrete payoffs
citizens will be less inclined to embark on deliberative undertakings in
the first place]{.underline}**; and [without instances of concrete
results, citizens will be unlikely to sustain deliberation over
time]{.underline}. Moreover, and particularly relevant to our present
purposes, the immediate problems posed to deliberation by power politics
come into focus when we realize that, typically, **[those with real
power to shape policy are under no obligation to respond to the outcomes
of even the most conscientiously designed instances of public
deliberation]{.underline}**. Rather, [in most instances deliberative
processes are such that decision-makers and influencers can choose to
respond to them or not at their discretion]{.underline}. The result is
that [the potential role that deliberation might play in public life is
diminished as power politics picks up where deliberation leaves
off]{.underline}. There are exceptions in which a straighter line can be
drawn between deliberation and change in the form of new public
policies, which Archon Fung calls "Empowered Participatory Governance"
and Joshua Cohen calls "Directly Deliberative Polyarchy." These are
situations in which government officials commit to citizen deliberation
as part of a formal decision-making process (Cohen and Fung, 2004).
Cohen and Fung pose such official empowerment of citizen deliberation as
the key means by which deliberation may have appropriate impacts on
public life. "In our view," they write, "participatory-deliberative
arrangements \[created by officials\] represent the most promising path
toward the ends of deliberative democracy" (Cohen and Fung, 2004: 30).
We certainly favor "participatory-deliberative arrangements" situated in
public institutions and organized by public officials. But we also hold
that deliberation will continue to fall short if it is not also situated
and controlled, to a very significant degree, in civil society as well.
In this light, public deliberation is just as much about strengthening
civil society and civic practices as it is about adjusting how public
officials do their work. Essentially, we see two problems with viewing
officially sanctioned and organized deliberation (important as it is) as
the sole, or even the primary, path toward more meaningful deliberative
democratic practice. First, instances of empowered participatory
governance, let alone well-designed instances (beyond the debilitating
democratic kabuki of most formal, public hearings) are quite rare.
Therefore, deliberation must now act from outside official institutions
much of the time or there will be so few opportunities that its proof of
concept and transformative potential may never adequately be realized.
Moreover, [deliberation must always be anchored and controlled from
outside officialdom to]{.underline} some extent if it is to [address
issues---and solutions to issues]{.underline}---[that]{.underline} are
controversial and [threaten to significantly upset the status
quo]{.underline}. [Officially sanctioned]{.underline} and organized
**[deliberation will naturally tend to be limited to those issues and
solutions with which officials are comfortable]{.underline}**. And
should issues and solutions uncomfortable to officials make their way
onto the policy agenda through the efforts of enterprising citizens,
officially controlled deliberation is likely to be conducted in a less
than whole-hearted fashion. **[Thus, relying solely on
institutionally-based solutions to the problem of power invites the very
distortions and dangers of agenda setting, exclusion, constraining rules
of engagement and the like]{.underline}** that Young and Sanders warn
about. In short, if one way to connect public deliberation to processes
of political and societal change is to make official institutional
practices more inclusive of public deliberation, another is through
citizens, groups and coalitions learning to leverage deliberation on
behalf of democratic change from the position of civil society. Our
capacity to leverage deliberation for change depends in large part on
our ability to address the challenges of control and design at the
outset. By properly attending to control and design we tend to confer on
deliberative processes a high degree of procedural democratic legitimacy
which, in turn, creates a capacity to promote change. To date this
capacity has often gone untapped by deliberative democrats, who often
seem to feel as if their work is done when deliberations conclude and a
report is written. Rather, the conclusion of a round of deliberation
marks not the end of the deliberative democrat's work, but a new and
most challenging phase of it, an activist phase of a particular kind. In
conceptualizing such deliberative activism, Young's juxtaposition of the
deliberative democrat and the political activist is a useful point of
departure. In her "Activist Challenges to Deliberative Democracy," Young
suggests that, "\[T\]he theory of deliberative democracy should be
critical of typical tactics of activism such as street marches,
boycotts, or sit-ins, on the grounds that their activities confront
rather than engage in discussion with people the movement's members
disagree with." The activist, on the other hand, believes that
"[deliberation is as likely to reinforce injustice as to undermine it"
because existing power arrangements "make it nearly impossible for the
structurally disadvantaged to propose solutions to social problems that
might alter the structural positions in which they stand]{.underline}."
Such structural change, in contrast to cosmetic policy adjustments that
only skim the surface of societal inequities, can best be addressed, in
Young's view, via activism.

### 2NC -- AT: Deliberative Democracy - Empiricism

#### [Empirical research]{.underline} proves inequality controls the structure of deliberative democracy -- racial divides fuel subordinate status in nearly all deliberations

**Mendelberg & Oleske 2k** (Tali Mendelberg, professor in the Department
of Politics, at Princeton University, John Oleske, Political Scientist,
"Race and Public Deliberation", Political Communication, 17:169 --191,

Some theorists have recently articulated the need to build more bridges
between delib- erative theory and political reality (e.g., Gutmann &
Thompson, 1996). [Our empirical study]{.underline}, although it is a
first, tentative step, [suggests that meaningful deliberation among
citizens is hampered]{.underline} by the difficulty of fully
implementing the rules that ideal deliberation requires. Entman and
Rojecki put the problem well: "The more social capital, the more
trustful communication among diverse members in a society and the better
able it is to work out its problems. . . . \[[Yet\] the racial divide
embodies the single most serious instance in the U.S. of low social
capital across groups"]{.underline} (1996, pp. 1--2). **[Subordinate
groups cannot rely on deliberation to secure equality and build a
community with dominant groups, because deliberation must have equality
and community as preconditions to succeed]{.underline}**. The situation
is a closed circle: One cannot get what one needs when the process of
obtaining it is itself tainted by the lack of what one needs. Theorists
who tackle inequality at length tend to focus on the twin facts that
do[minant groups silence speakers from subordinate groups and that
subordinate speakers do not feel empowered to speak]{.underline}
(Mansbridge, 1983; Sanders, 1997; Young, 1996). [How- ever, these
analyses leave out the other problem with inequality: the very
unwillingness of dominant groups to enlarge their community to include
subordinate groups in the first place]{.underline}. Furthermore, the
meaning of language was contested, making the deliberation itself an
issue. On our reading, [the anger and frustration of minority
citizens]{.underline} and their integrated White allies w[as a
product]{.underline} not so much of feeling silenced but **[of
accurately perceiving that, in the guise of principled, rational speech,
they and their children were being set apart in an isolated community
and marked as inferior citizens]{.underline}**. The question remains as
to how to get dominant groups to listen to subordinate groups. How do
subordinate groups get dominant groups to the table at all?

### 2NC -- AT: Deliberative Democracy - Proceduralism

#### Even under the most st[ringently procedural]{.underline} rules of deliberative democracy, racism [strongly]{.underline} advantages majority groups

of Politics, at Princeton University, John Oleske, Political Scientist,

The rhetoric at these meetings was not the ideal deliberation envisioned
by many deliberative theorists.13 Some theorists might object that the
meetings failed to provide an adequate opportunity to deliberate. We
consider this problem subsequently, but for now, we note that [the
meetings did go a long way toward meeting the most basic procedural
rules of deliberation]{.underline}: They were public, they entailed a
collective discussion, there was a relatively equal opportunity to
participate in all phases, and decisions were driven by arguments rather
than power. Thus, the meetings were a rare opportunity for citizens to
publicly and formally discuss a crucial matter of public policy. [We use
the substantive criteria of ideal deliberation to analyze how and why
the rhetoric was problematic]{.underline}. The deliberation we studied
was deficient in the following ways: (a) The segregated meeting ended in
consensus, which is a desirable outcome for some theorists, but it did
so through rhetoric that allowed participants to legitimize their
opposition to integration; (b) the integrated meeting did not lessen
conflict, because the implicitly racial rhetoric used by segregated
Whites was decoded as racial and racist, and the meeting was not
conducive to discussing ways of reducing that racism; (c) segregated
Whites did not use less group-inter ested language, or make more
references to the good of both commu- nities, or show signs of greater
tolerance at the integrated meeting, since in their inter- pretation
their rhetoric already was legitimate; (d) integrated citizens at the
integrated meeting did not express mutual understanding, because what
they decoded made them too angry and defensive; and (e) [facts and
reasoning played an important role, but in a highly selective,
self-serving way]{.underline} not endorsed by deliberative theorists.
What was perceived in Leonia as nonracial and well reasoned was
perceived in Englewood as racial and poorly reasoned. [What allowed
speakers to respect each other as civic-minded community members in
Leonia became a marker of group interest and opposition to a broader
community in Englewood]{.underline}. What counted as [universal language
for one community counted as the opposite in the other.]{.underline} In
short, [the positive effects of deliberation rest on the ability of the
opposing sides to communicate about their disagreement]{.underline}.
**[When the meaning of speech is contested, deliberation is unlikely to
be reasoned or consensual]{.underline}** (see also Warren, 1992, p.
15).14 The two expectations we derived from Mansbridge's work each found
support here, although each is complicated by racially coded language.
First, Leonia's segregated meeting, with its common interests, ended in
a sense of equal respect and consensus. However, it did so as a racially
segregated community, because it was a racially segregated commu- nity.
The White citizens at Leonia's segregated meeting engaged in what
Mansbridge calls the "enclave model of democratic deliberation" (1996,
p. 58). But ironically, Mansbridge recommends this model as a way for
subordinate groups to articulate their collective interests in a safe
setting, to understand themselves better, forge bonds of solidarity, and
hammer out conceptions of self, community, justice, and universality.
These meetings allowed the privileged group to do this, and do it
effectively. Faced with concerted opposition to regionalization, the
state abandoned regionalization and opted for segregated Whites'
preferred solution: It proposed that Englewood "work to correct the im-
balance itself." Englewood must now create a special magnet school, with
technical aid but no funds from the state. The second expectation we
derived from Mansbridge's work---that the adversarial meeting in
Englewood would end in alienation---was fulfilled. But this was in part
due to the contested meaning of language. Englewood residents seemed
angry not only about what they perceived as racism from the other side,
but at what they saw as an attempt to hide racism behind a veil of
legitimate words. The conflicting interests would have been more easily
resolved if the issue had not also included a conflict over basic
respect. At issue at these meetings was the affront to human dignity, an
affront that one group perceived and the other group denied. The
problems at these meetings are likely to arise outside the realm of race
as well. **[Racism undermines deliberation because it produces strong
negative assumptions about the opposing deliberators.]{.underline}**
[The same is probably true of sexism, nationalism, and other sets of
ideas that denigrate an out-group.]{.underline}

### 2NC -- AT: Law Key

#### Celia v. Missouri proves the law doesn't apply when it comes to people of color

**Brown 17 -** (DeNeen L. Brown, local enterprise reporter, "Missouri v.
Celia, a Slave: She killed the white master raping her, then claimed
self-defense", 10-19-17)

She warned the white slave owner that the rapes had to stop. Celia, 19,
had endured five years of assaults by Robert Newsom, the Missouri
[widower](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/retropolis/wp/2017/10/19/missouri-v-celia-a-slave-she-killed-the-white-master-raping-her-then-claimed-self-defense/?noredirect=on&utm_term=.b01687de07be)
in his 70s who'd purchased her when she was 14. She'd borne two of her
predator's children. Now [she was being courted by an enslaved black man
named George. When she became pregnant a third time, George told her the
farmer's abuse could not continue. Celia warned Newsom that she would
hurt him if he came to her cabin again. She also asked his two adult
daughters for help keeping their father away. But on the night of June
23, 1855, Newsom crept into her cabin and tried to force her to have sex
with him. Celia took a stick and bashed his head with it, killing him,
according to court documents. Then she pushed his body into a roaring
fire in her cabin's fireplace. The next day, his bones were carried out
in the embers. What followed was her arrest and a groundbreaking legal
case known as the State of Missouri vs. Celia, a Slave --- a dispute
that played out long before #MeToo hashtags on Twitter and the explosive
sexual assault and harassment allegations against]{.underline} [Harvey
Weinstein](https://www.washingtonpost.com/lifestyle/style/violence-threats-begging-harvey-weinsteins-30-year-pattern-of-abuse-in-hollywood/2017/10/14/2638b1fc-aeab-11e7-be94-fabb0f1e9ffb_story.html?utm_term=.9d08e24a4e9d),
Roger Ailes, Bill O'Reilly, Bill Cosby and other powerful men. *\[[She

[In Missouri in 1855, it was a crime "to take any woman unlawfully
against her will and by force, menace or duress, compel her to be
defiled," allowing women to argue self-defense in resisting such
assaults. Did that law apply to enslaved women? Celia's court-appointed
defense lawyer argued that it did. He asked Circuit Court Judge William
Hall to instruct the jury that a slave master had no right to rape a
slave and that the slaying could be considered justifiable. But the
judge refused to give the jury those instructions. Instead, Hall told
the 12 white men weighing the evidence: "If Newsom was in the habit of
having intercourse with the defendant who was his slave and went to her
cabin on the night he was killed to have intercourse with her or for any
other purpose and while he was standing in the floor talking to her she
struck him with a stick which was a dangerous weapon and knocked him
down, and struck him again after he fell, and killed him by either blow,
it is murder in the first degree." Though Celia had pleaded not guilty,
she'd confessed to the crime, according to Jefferson Jones, who
investigated the killing.]{.underline} Jones had interrogated Celia in
jail about a week after she was arrested to learn if there were any
accomplices in Newsom's slaying. "I asked her whether she thought she
would hang for what she had done," Jones testified, according to court
documents. "She said she thought she would hang. I then told her to tell
the whole truth." Celia told Jones the farmer had been abusing her for
years and "he had told her he was coming down to her cabin that night.
She told him not to come, that if he came she would hurt him." "I asked
her if George had asked her to kill the old man; said he never had. Said
that George had told her that he would have nothing to do with her if
she did not quit the old man." She told Jones that after she killed
Newsom, his body lay about an hour on the floor, before she decided to
burn it, he testified. [Christopher Gordon]{.underline}, director of
library and collections at the Missouri Historical Society in St. Louis,
[called the trial "a sham. Most everyone on the jury was either
pro-slavery or they owned]{.underline}
[slaves](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/retropolis/wp/2017/10/19/missouri-v-celia-a-slave-she-killed-the-white-master-raping-her-then-claimed-self-defense/?noredirect=on&utm_term=.b01687de07be)[themselves.
The thought of a slave --- and let alone a female slave --- getting away
with something like this was not anything they would
permit.]{.underline} The defense tried very hard to play on sympathy and
cast Robert Newsom as a predator. ... But the racial politics of the day
won out." *\[[Hunting down runaway slaves: The cruel ads of Andrew
Jackson and 'the master

At the time, the country was edging toward civil war over slavery, and
Missouri was a microcosm of those tensions. [White people who supported
slavery wanted Celia executed for the murder of her master. But others
expressed sympathy for her,]{.underline} wrote Melton A. McLaurin,
author of the book, "Celia: A Slave." "Although slave law had come in
the course of the 19th century to recognize a slave's right to use force
to protect her life, it had not extended this right to include
protection against sexual assault," McLaurin wrote. On Nov. 1, 1855, the
Glasgow Weekly Times reported that Celia had been found guilty in
Callaway County [Circuit
Court](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/retropolis/wp/2017/10/19/missouri-v-celia-a-slave-she-killed-the-white-master-raping-her-then-claimed-self-defense/?noredirect=on&utm_term=.0bd9574e19f8)
"of murder in the first degree ... for the murder of her master." The
jury sentenced her to death, though her case was appealed to the
Missouri Supreme Court. While awaiting her execution, Celia escaped.
"The negro woman 'Celia' confined in the Calloway jail, and under
sentence of death, made her escape a few days before she was to have
been executed, and was at large last accounts," the Glasgow, Mo.,
newspaper reported on Nov. 22, 1855. "She was to have been hung last
Friday." [Celia was captured a few days later. The state Supreme Court
refused to overturn Celia's conviction. But her execution was delayed
long enough to allow her to give birth to her third child. The baby was
stillborn. On Dec. 21, 1855, Celia was taken to the Calloway Courthouse
in Fulton, Mo., and "hanged until she died."]{.underline}

#### The United States Supreme Court Unlawful Ruling for the Scottsboro Cases

**Social Service Review 18** -- (Social Service Review, "The United
States Supreme Court and the Scottsboro Cases", The University of
Chicago Press, Page 336-337
https://www.jstor.org/stable/pdf/30010470.pdf?refreqid=excelsior%3A2908c0db0ef8b747d01fb060259910cf)

The case of one of the defendants, Clarence Norris, has again gone by an
analogous route to the Supreme Court. Norris was brought to trial in
November, 1933, and [a motion was made on his behalf to quash the
indictment on the grounds of exclusion of Negroes from juries in Jackson
County, where the indictment was found. The motion was denied. The
defendant was again found guilty. The verdict was again sustained by the
Supreme Court of the State]{.underline}, and has again (April I, 1935)
been passed on by the Supreme Court of the United States.2 This time Mr.
Chief Justice Hughes delivers the opinion, and this time the judgment is
again reversed and the cause is remanded for further proceedings. This
time the emphasis is however, being laid upon the fact that, although it
is shown that there are in Alabama competent Negroes, capable of serving
upon grand and petit juries, they have been consistently excluded from
such service. [The argument in this case, which is devoted to a
considerable extent to the question of whether or not there is evidence
of the presence in Alabama of Negroes qualified to serve, is less
interesting in some respects than the arguments in the earlier opinion,
but it is, of course, a more distressing evidence of the consistent
influence of racial prejudice seventy years after the close of the war
in which the South submitted the issue of slavery to the arbitrament of
war.]{.underline} There was no dissenting opinion in this case, but Mr.
Justice McReynolds did not hear the evidence. These decisions recall the
so-called Arkansas cases,3 in which, in 1923, the Supreme Court took
notice of the hideous travesty on justice perpetrated by the Arkansas
courts when a group of Negro share-croppers were trying to find some
protection against their [exploiters and were the victims of violent
attack and then suffered in the denial of every item in the bill of
rights.]{.underline} In the case of these defendants under the guidance
of Mr. Moorfield Storey, the Court found itself able to distinguish the
situation from that of Leo Frank, 4 a Jew who was the victim of the mob
spirit in Atlanta, in which it had not seemed possible for the Supreme
Court to assume jurisdiction. In the Arkansas cases, Justice Holmes, who
had dissented in the Frank case, wrote the opinion. Then Justice
Sutherland, who wrote the opinion of the Court in the first Scottsboro
case, dissented with Justice McReynolds, who dissented in the first
Scottsboro case.

at The Washington Post, where the legal director of the American Civil
Liberties Union, David D. Cole, made the case that the travel-ban
ruling, like [the Dred Scott decision, is "likely to be judged by
history as one of the court's greatest failures."]{.underline} The
comparison of Trump v. Hawaii to Dred Scott hinges on the argument that
the two cases are similarly egregious, turning on specious ideas about
racial difference: [then against black people and now against Muslim
people]{.underline}. That's true, and certainly a reason we should study
Dred Scott in this moment. But which lessons we draw from the past
matters. [The Dred Scott decision was a bad one, and yet it also exposed
the limitations of the court's power]{.underline} --- and how lawyers
and activists curbed its influence. Chief Justice Roger B. Taney
overreached when he aimed to seal the fate of black Americans, and the
resistance to his ruling is instructive for those who are seeking to do
the same in the face of Trump v. Hawaii. No sooner had the Dred Scott
decision been handed down than it was under attack from many sides.
African American activists and members of the abolitionist movement
immediately opposed what was a blow to those who had long claimed that
former slaves were free people and also citizens. At stake was whether
the United States was destined to be a white man's country or whether
there was a future for an interracial democracy on the horizon. Taney's
fellow jurists also objected to the blanket exclusion of black Americans
from the body politic. Lower federal courts resisted in surprisingly
effective ways. Their willingness to interpret Taney's decision narrowly
and treat black litigants like citizens was a blow that sapped Dred
Scott of much real influence. Sitting on the federal circuit court for
Illinois, Justice John McLean --- who also sat on the U.S. Supreme Court
and penned a dissent in Dred Scott --- reined in the ruling in Mitchell
v. Lamarjust a few months after Dred Scott was decided. McLean deemed
Joseph Mitchell, a free African American from Illinois, a citizen,
thwarting Taney's attempt to render all black Americans people without
rights under the Constitution. Because Mitchell was descended from free
people, rather than slaves, his status before the Constitution differed
from that of Scott. [State courts also resisted Dred Scott.]{.underline}
In Ohio, one court confronted the question of black citizenship when
called upon to interpret the phrase "citizen of the United States" as
set forth in its state constitution. [Determining that Taney's opinion
applied only to those who, like Scott, were descendants of slaves, the
court decided that a free man of mixed racial descent could be
considered a citizen.]{.underline} In Maine, by request of the
legislature, the state's high court interpreted a key provision of the
state constitution in a way that similarly narrowed Dred Scott. The
question was whether free men of color could serve as electors under a
provision limiting that role to "male citizens of the United States.
Yes, the court concluded: "Our constitution does not discriminate
between the different races of people which constitute the inhabitants
of our state; but that the term, 'citizens of the United States,' as
used in that instrument, applies as well to free colored persons of
African descent." Even in Taney's home state of Maryland, where he was
generally admired, the state's highest court refused to adopt the logic
of Dred Scott. When asked in the 1858 case of Hughes v. Jackson whether
a free man of color could bring suit in a state court, the answer was a
clear yes. Taney might have barred black litigants from federal courts
as noncitizens, but the Maryland court determined that his approach was
not consistent with the state's interests. There, it was deemed
essential that free black men and women have the ability to protect
their property and persons by way of court proceedings --- that, contra
Taney, they did indeed have rights that white men were bound to respect.
By the fall of 1858, Taney was despondent over the criticisms of his
ruling. "I do not feel willing to write a defense of one of my judicial
opinions," he wrote to his son-in-law and confidant J. Mason Campbell.
Yet he very much wanted to. Taney's need to justify his ruling reflects
the degree to which Dred Scott was widely reviled. [A sense of judicial
propriety kept him from speaking out publicly, but his personal writings
reveal the depth of his disappointment. Taney lamented how "disingenuous
perversion and misrepresentation" were shaping the fate of Dred
Scott.]{.underline} So he privately penned a supplemental opinion to
Dred Scott, one he hoped to publish "while the question is still
exciting attention." As he had in Dred Scott, Taney's supplement drew
upon historical analysis to argue that people of African descent had
enjoyed no rights from 1689, as British subjects, through 1787, when the
Constitution was ratified. And he stood ready to reargue the issue,
though he suspected that the supplement's publication would take place
only after his death: "My executors must in some form or other bring it
before the public." That is indeed what would happen. Dred Scott was
good law for the briefest time, and even then was never given the full
force in the daily lives of black Americans that Taney intended.
Ultimately, it took the Civil War to resolve the controversy over black
citizenship that Dred Scott had ignited. A consensus emerged in which
black Americans were deemed citizens by virtue of their birth on U.S.
soil, first in an 1862 opinion by Attorney General Edward Bates, then in
the Civil Rights Act of 1866 and, finally, with the ratification of the
14th Amendment to the Constitution in July 1868. Dred Scott was undone.
Invoking Dred Scott today should do more than provide an example of how
courts have, from time to time, made bad decisions. It should also show
how these bad decisions can be undermined, undercut, resisted and,
ultimately, even overturned. We should remember Dred Scott as an example
of how high courts can err, but it is most valuable as a primer on what
can follow in the wake of a court's injustice and as a cautionary tale
about what might await a nation that fails to respond to it.

## 2AC -- Shell -- Plan Affirmatives

#### Our interpretation is that the affirmative should be able to weigh the advantages of the plan enacted by the federal government, the negative has the right to the status quo and a competitive policy option. 

#### Violation -- Their interpretation of debate moots the 1ac while steering the conversation away from the resolutional question. 

C.  **Vote Neg -**

#### Plan Focus - our framework ensures a stable locus for links and the comparison of alternatives. Alternative frameworks which do not ensure that the plan is the starting-point of the debate make confusion and judge intervention inevitable.

#### Ground -- there are an infinite number of unpredictable K frameworks, K links, and K impacts. Forcing the aff to debate in the neg framework moots the 1AC. Because the K could literally be about anything, their so-called framework destroys aff ground because we can never predict what we'll have to compare our plan to. Even if there's some ground for us to respond to their arg, it's not good or predictable and losing the 1AC puts us at an inherent disadvantage. 

#### Topic Specific Education - Only debates about the plan translate into education about the topic. There would be no reason to switch topics every year if not for plan-focus debate. K frameworks encourage ultra-generics like the 'state bad' K that are stale and uneducational

### 2AC - Student Activism

#### Student activism about arm sales is key to empowerment and change.

Schools are experiencing a tidal wave of student activism in response to
the shooting in Parkland, Florida. Practically overnight, Marjory
Stoneman Douglas [High School students have become the new face of gun
control and school safety --- challenging lawmakers, tweeting out their
views, and organizing marches, boycotts, and walkouts for stricter gun
laws]{.underline}. As young people across the country join in, it's an
inspiring moment for their educators --- and a tricky one. [Many feel
powerless against state and federal laws, uncertain as to what their
district leaders will endorse, unsure how to steer anger into action, or
overwhelmed by a torrent of youthful voices.]{.underline} We spoke with
[Gretchen Brion-Meisels](https://www.gse.harvard.edu/node/125602), an
expert in youth development who studies ways to build a positive school
climate. Here, she shares perspectives on how teachers and
administrators can acknowledge their students\' concerns and empower
their insightful leadership. Why [it's important to take students' views
seriously]{.underline}: From a social-emotional standpoint[: In terms of
building trust, relationships, and a positive school culture, it's vital
that everyone in a school building ---teachers, staff, and students ---
feel like their voices are respected and heard. Part of ensuring this is
making sure that there is a clear path for giving and receiving
feedback]{.underline}. Students must feel safe and welcome in school, in
order to be able to fully engage with their learning. From a youth
empowerment standpoint: We know from [research on youth participatory
action](http://yparhub.berkeley.edu/) and youth organizing that [when
young people are given a voice in shaping the policies and practices in
their school, there are benefits for both the young people and the
school. The young people benefit from learning the skills and tools
necessary to research and articulate their arguments, and from the sense
of agency that comes with being an authentic partner in decision-making
processes. Schools benefit because they better understand the ways in
which their policies and practices are impacting their students, and
because partnering with students builds trust and authentic
collaboration.]{.underline} From a policy standpoint: [Too often
policies about schools are made without consulting or considering the
young people and adults in schools.]{.underline} There are countless
examples of teachers and students across history protesting the
decisions of policymakers and/or demanding policy reforms that more
fully acknowledge their humanity. [Young people across the country have
recently advocated against the criminalization of youth in schools,
tracking, and punitive discipline policies; and in favor of gun control,
LGBTQ rights, and a National Bill of Student Rights]{.underline}. In
early February, youth across the country took part in a national [Black
Lives Matter Week of Action in Our
Schools](https://www.facebook.com/The-National-Black-Lives-Matter-Week-of-Action-in-Our-Schools-192373061312325/),
where they demanded an end to zero tolerance and the implementation of
restorative justice practices; the hiring of more black teachers; and a
mandate for black history/ethnic studies in K-12 schools. The incredible
young people who are leading the fight in Parkland are building on a
deep history of youth activism in this country. How schools can welcome

## 2AC -- Shell -- Non-Traditional Affirmative/Black Framework

#### The affirmative recognizes debate as a cite for activism. The 1nc does not address the purpose of the debate established by the 1ac \<insert analysis from critical solvency cards in 1ac\>

#### We will win that their proposed model of plan-focused debate is bad:

### 2AC - 1. Unlimiting

#### A. Makes it impossible to be negative -- we would have access to any and every action by the USFG multiplied by fiat which explodes the negative research burden which turns their interpretation.

#### B. Makes it impossible to be affirmative -- crushes our potential to use our experiences to relate to the topic. We would have to rewrite our experiences to cater to the topic and not our needs which literally makes debate impossible because it does not address our everyday needs

### 2AC - 2. Anti-educational

#### A. Conditionality -- it allows it and encourages it. Condo is a voting issue because it encourages argumentative irresponsibility, kitchen sink strategies, and multiple contradictory arguments and destroys affirmatives competitive equities. 

#### B. Plan Inclusive counterplans -- plan focus guarantees PICs. PICs are a voting issue because they steal aff ground and for the aff to debate itself, encourages vague plan writing which destroys negs ground and result in trivial distinctions between the plan and the counterplan like a penny saved is a penny earned. You cannot PIC out of an embodied performance.

#### C. Process CPs -- Neg's interpretation allows it because they focus on the process of implementation. Process PICs are a voting issue because they destroy topic specific education, they destroy the aff because they include the affirmative, and lastly, they are limitless and unpredictable. If you hate conditions, consult, and dirty word PICs - vote for us!

### 2AC - 3. \<insert aff specific state-based offense\>

#### Activism is a better approach to debate -

#### We need not learn how to act later but engage in action now. We can experience material outcome of our actions today which will help us know how to engage in activism more effectively later, but solves our argument about the necessity of action today \<insert aff uniqueness\>

#### Their interpretation would encroach on those skills by devaluing the knowledge that students bring to the activity and the perspective they bring about what should be done now. Perspectivism is net-benefit to our method because it encourages students to relate to the topic via their experience. 

#### \<insert Gerhke or perm-like card here\>\*this is also a permutation because it says K and policy can go hand in hand, but K has to come first\*

## 2AC - Permutations

### 2AC - Perm -- Performance + Law 

#### Perm do both. Critical analysis is necessary in order for debate to function. Traditional policy and critical debate requires the same advocacy and research skills behind the actions proposed, they go hand and hand.

Gehrke, P.J. (1998). Critique Arguments as Policy Analysis: Policy
Debate Beyond the Rationalist Perspective. Contemporary Argumentation
and Debate, 19, 18-39./cdc

Most debate theorists who oppose critique arguments advance a
rationalist paradigm of policy evaluation. In their minds, a strict
cost-benefit analysis, particularly a quantitative analysis based on the
preservation of human life, is the only means by which an advocate can
justifY or dejustifY a policy. In his criticism of scientific models of
public policy, Robert Formaini, the former vice president for public
policy at the Cato Institute, explains the rationalist policy paradigm:
According to the policy rationalist, if the risks are \"acceptable\" and
the \"benefits\" are greater than \"costs,\" what person can argue that
the proposed policy ought not be done, and on what inductive basis? It
will not work to say that the proposed policy is \"wrong,\" \"immoral,\"
\"unjust,\" and a \"waste of time and effort.\" These arguments are
\"unscientific\" and \"value-laden\" with the citizen\'s personal,
irrational prejudices. (69) [In policy debate, the rationalist
perspective marginalizes critiques by mistakenly representing a
particular approach to policy evaluation as the essential means of
policy deliberation, implying that one theoretical perspective is both
appropriate for all policy questions and preferable to all other means
of policy comparison]{.underline}. Marouf Hasian and Edward Panetta
argue that \"both the promise and the peril of the critique come from
its use as a method of questioning some of the assumptions behind
\'policy\' debate itself\' (47). They continue, \"the use of \'the
critique\' in policy debate means a virtual abandonment of many of the
cherished assumptions of policy decision making\" (53). If by [policy
debate and policy decision making,]{.underline} Hasian and Panetta [are
referring only to the conventional practices of academic debate, they
would be]{.underline} [correct]{.underline}. However, their criticism is
not that critiques simply challenge academic policy debate as we
commonly practice it, but rather that critiques are \"politically
irrelevant and counterproductive\" (54). This conclusion is arrived at
by giving primacy to rationalist policy models, including claims such as
that \"[debating is an inherently rationalistic activity]{.underline}\"
(54). Faith in rationalism as the core element of policy debate leads
Derek Jinks to posit that if critiques have any theoretical legitimacy,
\"they should take the form of disadvantages, counterplans, solvency
arguments, etc.\" (AI4). links argues that resolutions imply the context
for academic debates, and since contemporary resolutions are interpreted
as policy questions, they should be addressed from a policy perspective
(AI2). While this line of reasoning may bear some merit, Jinks begs the
question of whether the rationalist model is the only possible policy
perspective. Jinks relies on a rationalist cost-benefit analysis model
for decision making. He argues that [policy decisions cannot be made
without comparing unique costs and benefits of proposed courses of
action]{.underline} (A 14). Jinks likewise contends that [policy
debate]{.underline} should [begin from a set of shared assumptions about
the values at stake]{.underline}, which should simply be taken as true
(Al3). Matthew Shors and Steve Mancuso propose an extreme division
between critiques and policy discourse. Shorsand Mancuso make the same
error as Jinks · by generalizing from rationalist policy models to all
policy deliberation. They claim that critiques are \"utterly
irrelevant\" and that critiques ask us to believe that \"it is pointless
to discuss policies\" (A16). Shors and Mancuso would have us believe
that critiques \"ignore policy issues altogether\" (A16). It is because
critiques do not argue unique commensurable costs or benefits that they
contend that critiques carry \"little, if any, weight in policy
comparison\" (AI6). Only by failing to recognize the broad diversity of
policy perspectives can Shors and Mancuso come to conclude that \"the
Critique is wholly incompatible with, and non-germane to, policy
debate\" (A 17). Perhaps the most vehement opponent of critiques has
been Solt. Solt makes many of the same assumptions about policy analysis
as do Jinks, Shors, and Mancuso. Solt so strongly believes that
critiques challenge the assumption that \"what we are essentially
engaged in is a policy debate\" that he recommends the first response to
critiques be to reestablish the policy framework (\"Demystifying\" A9).
For Solt, \"the kl\'itik is a non-policy argument\" (Anti-hitik ii). He
sees debate as a policy forum, and critiques are considered not to be
\"germane to the subject at hand\" (Anli-Kl\'itik xxii). Solt argues
that \"at root, the kritik misunderstands the nature of the policy
calculus\" (Anti-Kritik x:xiii). Solt\'s rationalist assumptions are
apparent in arguments encouraging us to \"take an a priori ethical and
political framework for granted\" (\"De mystifying\" A II). Similarly,
he ignores a whole body of interpretive and communicative policy
analysis literature when he claims that \"ideas are more important than
the rhetoric with which they are expressed\" (\"Demystifying\" All).
Here, Solt is attempting to refute language critiques by retreating to a
separation of policies and the words that express, present, and form
those policies. For So It, the policy has a pure form outside of
language, and it is that form that is to be evaluated, rather than any
of the words that might malign it. Such a position is distant from much
of both contemporary communication studies and policy studies
literature. 24 CONTEMPORARY ARGUMENTATION AND DEBATE [The arguments
against critiques advanced by the policy debate rationalists
are]{.underline} suspect because they are [grounded in the traditions of
academic debate rather than contemporary theories of policy
studies.]{.underline} Consequently, [they dismiss questions they can not
force-fit into policy rationalism as neither worthwhile nor relevant to
policy discussions.]{.underline} As two policy analysts wrote of the
hegemony of the rationalist paradigm, \"When all you have is a hammer
the whole world looks like a nail\" (House and Shull 163-164). Berube
attacks critiques from a perspective not overtly founded on policy
rationalism, holding that critiques are fundamentally pre-fiat arguments
and that they disregard post-fiat substantive claims (\"Criticizing\"
68-72). Nonetheless, he bases his arguments upon [similar assumptions
about]{.underline} the [relationship between critiques and policy
debate. Here]{.underline}, \"fiat\" is a stand-in for \"policy focus,\"
in that fiat represents an enacted policy[. To claim that critiques
disregard issues that arise after fiat is to claim that they disregard
questions raised by enacting policies]{.underline}. Berube\'s argument
is also predicated upon the assumption that academic debate should
extend no further than \"intentional, intended, naIve, objective, and
rogate\" meanings (\"Criticizing\" 77). [This means that debaters and
critics should not question any of the assumptions or presuppositions of
texts or advocacies, uncritically accepting the premises inherent in
propositions.]{.underline} In the context of policy analysis, Berube \'s
standards require that policy advocates and analysts not ask of each
other: \"But what are your assumptions? Are they valid, or consistent,
or morally acceptable?\" This position is extraordinarily dangerous.
Wayne Booth argues that we must consider precisely those questions texts
attempt to foreclose: Each literary work implicates within itself a set
of norms about what questions are appropriate. Hemingway, to choose a
favorite example of the new feminist critics, does not demand of us that
we ask of his works, \"Is it good for men or women to accept
uncritically my machismo bravado?\" Indeed, he seems to work quite hard
to prevent our asking such a question. But surely, the feminist critics
say, and I think they are right, surely any teacher who teaches A
Farewell to Arms without inviting, somewhere along the line, a critical
consideration of Hemingway\'s heroes as human ideals, and of his
portraits of women as reflecting a peculiarly maimed creative vision,
and of his vision of the good life as a singularly immature one-surely
any such teacher is doing only half the job. (301) . . ; GEHRKE 25 .
Similarly, we might say that [any policy debater who does not seek a
critical consideration of the questions that a policy proposal tries to
foreclose is only doing half the job of a policy analyst]{.underline}.
Additionally, Berube assumes that we have pure and direct knowledge of
the meanings of a text. However, [in order to understand the meanings of
a text we must interpret that text. When advocates speak, we inevitably
interpret what they say. Meanings are found in the act of
interpretation, and those meanings differ, at least slightly, between
interpretations. There is virtually no text in a debate that can inspire
one universally agreed upon interpretation]{.underline}. As listeners
and readers, we can never find ourselves at a point where the
intentional, naive, and rogate meanings of a text are objectively
transparent to us. Determining what questions a text invites requires
interpreting the text, and these interpretations will vary, producing
contrary readings of what questions may be asked of that text. There is
no way to reconcile interpretations objectively. In order to evaluate
competing interpretations, one would have to engage in precisely the
critical textual analysis Berube attempts to foreclose. Since every
interaction with a text is interpretive, Berube\'s objective standard
for encountering a text never can be met. While opponents of critiques
might be expected to position critiques outside of policy discussion,
some advocates of critique arguments in debate have done the same. Many
· critique proponents advance either the position that we should not
consider ourselves policy analysts (Berube, \"Kritiks\" 21), or that
critiques supersede policy questions (Bahm 76; Broda-Bahm and Murphy
21). These arguments unwittingly lend assistance to opponents of
critiques by disconnecting critique arguments from policy discourse.
Stepping outside the policy focus is not inviting to those who hold
resolutely to a policy perspective; rationalist or otherwise. Rather, it
makes it all the more difficult to recognize the unique role critique
arguments can play in the enhancement of policy analysis and policy
debate. Broda-Bahm probably has done more to popularize language
critiques than any other theorist, but he clearly positions these
arguments outside of policy deliberation. BrodaBahm and Thomas Murphy
define a critique as \"any argument which does not provide an answer to
the resolutional question\" (21). In this context, they refer to \"the
resolutional question\" not merely as the resolution itself, but as the
affirmative case which advocates it (31 n3). They make the same
assumption often used as a premise against critiques, that we can and
should separate policies from the language that advances them.
Broda-Bahm separates policy and language by arguing that critiques do
not answer substantive advocacy, but rather focus \"more directly on the
actual language practices of an opponent\" (Bahrn 69). This is
reinforced with attempts to give primacy to the \"more immediate and
more tangible\" effects of language by claiming policy proposals to be
fictions of debate rounds (Bahm 76). While positioning critiques outside
of policy discourse is a common error amongst critique advocates,
Shanahan is an exception. Much of Shanahan\'s essay is esoteric and
philosophical, but he does recognize at least a potential for critiques
to be a part of policy analysis. Making use of literature about
development assistance, Shanahan considers \"the possibility that the
kritik is policy debate\" (A8). Shanahan was nearest the mark when he
claimed that \"the kritik supplements, not supplants current debate
practice\" (A4). However, critique proponents have either ignored or
simply reiterated these claims, and opponents of critique argumentation
scoff at Shanahan\'s conception of policy analysis. Most likely, this is
because Shanahan\'s theory is so deeply embedded in Heidegger\'s
philosophy that it is difficult to read a policy focus beneath the
existential vocabulary. This may also be because neither proponents nor
opponents of critique argumentation have considered the policy studies
literature that reinforces the need for critiques in policy discussions.
[If one truly takes a policy perspective toward debate, one inevitably
finds that critique argumentation is a necessary element of policy
evaluation. The impasse hence arises because opponents of critiques hold
that the purpose of debate is to discuss policies exclusively, and
assume that policy rationalism is the only mechanism debaters can use to
do so]{.underline}. Many proponents of critiques maintain the impasse by
arguing that critiques somehow supersede or exist outside of policy
argumentation. The marginalization performed by both sides of this
controversy disconnects critique argumentation from politics, policy
deliberation, and real world debates. [To move past the impasse and
integrate critique argumentation and policy deliberation, we must
reposition critiques within the spectrum of policy
analysis.]{.underline}

#### Perm - narratives and law determine each other 

#### **Wharton '16**

**(Robin Wharton, Georgia State University, Derek Miller, Harvard
University, "New Directions in Law and Narrative", Law, Culture and the
Humanities 1--11, pp. 8-11, Accessed 7/29/18, PAS).**

Through a careful survey of legal history, Bricker demonstrates how
judicial reliance on precedent evolved from the twelfth through the
seventeenth centuries, from pre-modern canonical use of previous
decisions to illustrate important legal rules and concepts into modern
stare decisis in which previous rulings are binding precedent in
subsequent cases involving analogous factual scenarios. In order to
accomplish this transition, early modern jurists and **[legal theorists
had to "narrativize" the common law, transforming it from an arguably ad
hoc jumble of sometimes wildly inconsistent outcomes into a coherent
histoire of doctrinal cause and effect.]{.underline}** The result is a
narrative archetype that shapes all modern common law judicial
decisions: All of this is to suggest that, at the heart of the judicial
ruling, is a double act of storytelling and displacement. The courts
recite the facts of the case as a kind of omniscient historical
narrative, and then apply to those facts, logically and analogically, a
series of cases bearing similar legal principles. But [**both of these
acts of storytelling**, while gathering their force and legitimacy
through the appeal of narrative, **are also sublimated -- they only gain
their force,** the law claims, **through reason.**]{.underline} In
Bricker's analysis, what we often take for granted as a fundamental
rhetorical feature of the law becomes a historically constructed
narrative form or genre with a specific narrative function --
legitimation through application of previous judicial precedent. The
approaches to law and literature studies presented by Bricker and Waugh
Lagji comfortably work within both what Paul Heald has called the "law
as literature as language" and "law and literature as ethical discourse"
categories of law and literature scholarship.24 They combine study of
"the form of legal argument and the form of literary rhetoric," with
attention to whether "the lessons taught in fiction have direct
applicability to how substantive legal decisions should be made."25 In
doing so, however, they take important strides beyond critical
methodology and vocabulary that depend upon analogy and equivalence, a
type of criticism that never quite captures law and literature's shared
identity within and as narrative. To the extent that **[law and
literature are narrative, they participate in the same project. They are
two sides of the same coin, the currency with which historical
continuity and socio-political cohesion are purchased.]{.underline}**
If, as Heald suggested in 2009, "Law and Literature" as a field of
academic study continues in mattering little to the law, legal
scholarship will continue to account inadequately for how gendered,
racist, ableist, and classist constructions of human subjectivity lead
to and perpetuate structural inequality within legal systems.26 And
**[legal education]{.underline}**, especially in the United States,
**[will continue to produce scholars and practitioners blind to the
extra-judicial or extra-legislative content that "pours in" to the law
via literary and other narrative forms of cultural
production.]{.underline}**27 We are particularly interested in
reasserting the stakes of law and narrative as defined by Peters**[. Law
and narrative battles the layman's misconception or rhetorically
constructed notion that the law always represents the
"real."]{.underline}**28 In **[fact legal narrative sometimes quite
openly operates as fiction, and explicitly demands a willing suspension
of disbelief in the reader's mind. At other moments, though, legal
narrative can venture unintentionally into fictional
speculation.]{.underline}** As Best shows, **[a tendency to accept
without examination legally significant, yet extra-legal interpretations
of disputed concepts and forms can lead to implicit bias that is all the
more difficult to eradicate because the hermeneutic and rhetorical
operations of legal discourse obscure its presence.]{.underline}**29 At
the same time, however, **[by insisting the law is ideally a closed
system that works most perfectly when it no longer needs to refer beyond
itself]{.underline}**, some legal scholars and judicial **[authorities
create legal arguments that unmoor the law from any grounding in the
real, lived experience of the individuals it governs]{.underline}**.
Such is the case with Justice Clarence Thomas's recent pronouncement in
Obergefell v. Hodges that "\[s\]laves did not lose their dignity (any
more than they lost their humanity) because the government allowed them
to be enslaved."30 This bit of sophistry is not even clearly true in an
abstract legal sense given that one could hardly be said to own or
possess a thing when those rights are neither universally acknowledged
in the collective social imagination nor enforceable in a court of law.
Of what personal or even symbolic value are one's dignity and humanity
when one can legally be bought, sold, raped, killed, or tortured by
one's legal owners? To accept Thomas's reasoning on this point, even if
it were logical from a purely legal standpoint, requires one to ignore
the terrible reality of slavery. Further, judicial arguments over the
extent to which the interpretation of legal precedent should refer
beyond the four corners of a document might be read, in part, as
aesthetic disputes over how much fiction is too much in a legal
narrative. Responding to the majority's central holding in Citizens
United v. FEC that government speech regulation cannot discriminate on
the basis of a speaker's corporate identity, Justice John Paul Stevens
writes on behalf of the dissenters, "[The fact that corporations are
different from human beings might seem to need no elaboration, except
that the majority opinion almost completely elides it."]{.underline}31
Stevens certainly criticizes the majority's interpretation of the law,
but he describes in great detail and seems even more concerned by the
majority's disregard for both history and contemporary reality. In
essence, he accuses the majority of adjudicating in a fantasy world: If
individuals in our society had infinite free time to listen to and
contemplate every last bit of speech uttered by anyone, anywhere; and if
broadcast advertisements had no special ability to influence elections
apart from the merits of their arguments (to the extent they make any);
and if legislators always operated with nothing less than perfect
virtue; then I suppose the majority's premise would be sound. In the
real world \[emphasis added\], we have seen, corporate domination of the
airwaves prior to an election may decrease the average listener's
exposure to relevant viewpoints, and it may diminish citizens'
willingness and capacity to participate in the democratic process.32
Kennedy's majority opinion deals heavily in **[abstraction of both
"speech" and "personhood" and is replete with prolepses into future
scenarios where he imagines how an incorrect decision in the case at
hand may have disastrous results down the line.]{.underline}** Stevens,
by contrast, relies on analepsis as well as exhaustive citation to the
legal and historical record to justify his argument that his particular
interpretation of the law is the only just result for this particular
case. **[The two opinions not only offer two divergent legal outcomes,
they also exhibit very different narrative characteristics. These formal
distinctions are more than a matter of mere style,
however.]{.underline}** They substantively affect the kind of story each
justice is able to tell about the law, and reflect their implicit and
perhaps unexamined decisions [about the poetics of legal narrative --
that is their ideas about things such as what a legal narrative should
include, the order in which to tell it, whose perspective to foreground,
the sources from which to draw, the extent to which it can refer or
allude to other narratives and the substance of those
allusions]{.underline}, whether it follows the conventions of allegory
or historiography or something in between. In his essay "The Law Wishes
to Have a Formal Existence," Stanley Fish argues that ["the law is
continually creating and recreating itself out of the very materials and
forces it is obliged, by the very desire to be law, to push
away."]{.underline}33 As Fish describes it, **[the law's authority as
law stems in large part from the manner in which legal narrative
disavows]{.underline}**, through fancy rhetorical "legerdemain," its
origins in linguistic interpretation and situational morality.34 Law and
narrative has always meant more than this, as the papers on our panel
and those printed here make clear. There remains much work to do.
Acknowledging and exploring the complex interdependence between legal
and literary modes of cultural production might bring greater
transparency and flexibility to the legal process**[. Rather than
keeping up a false pretense that the law is a closed formal system, and
insisting it must be freed from contaminating outside influences, we
should spend more time examining how the law participates within a
larger narrative project.]{.underline}**35 The overview we offer here,
the essays by Bricker and Waugh Lagji, and the position statements
offered by the other participants in the original MLA roundtable, reveal
both how thoroughly narrative suffuses all legal practice and how much
work the narratives produced in and by the law do in the world. In
reasserting these suppressed but, we hope, unavoidable facts, we might
establish a more systematic and productive -- as opposed to obscure and
haphazard -- evolutionary relationship between law and other narrative
forms. Such an approach may empower petitioners and litigants by
providing a more complete picture of the discursive process from which
the law emerges and yet of which it remains only a part. It could also
foster greater mindfulness and clarity in legislative and judicial
decision-making by creating a broader awareness of how deeply legal
narratives draw upon and how profoundly they influence the creation of a
collective sociocultural identity

### 2AC -- Perm -- Democratic Participation

#### **Considering all forms of dissent is key to democracy** 

**Sparks 97,** Sparks, Holloway. "Dissident Citizenship: Democratic
Theory, Political Courage, and Activist Women." Hypatia, vol. 12, no. 4,
1997, pp. 74--110. JSTOR, JSTOR,
[www.jstor.org/stable/3810734](http://www.jstor.org/stable/3810734).

The participatory and deliberative views of citizenship as citizen
participation and joint deliberation and action offer provocative
visions of the possibilities for democratic societies in the late
twentieth century. Strikingly absent from this work, however, is
sustained attention to the role of dissent in democratic life.
[Theorists who do talk about dissent, furthermore, tend to raise the
issue only in terms of verbal deliberative dissent.]{.underline} For
example, Barber confines his discussion of dissent to his chapter on
democratic talk and judgment.' "A healthy democratic community," Barber
notes, will leave room for the expression of distrust, dissent, or just
plain opposition, even in lost causes where dissenters are very much in
the minority. Here the function of talk is to allow people to vent their
grievances or frustration or opposition, not in hopes of moving others
but in order to give public status to their strongly held personal
convictions. The cry "In spite of all, I believe , . ." is the hallmark
of such usage, and conscientious objection to military service is an
illuminating example. (Barber 1984,192) Dissenters can also register
continuing opposition even after a decision has been made. "I am part of
the community, I participated in the talk and deliberation leading to
the decision, and so I regard myself as bound; but let it be known that
I do not think we have made the right decision," says the dissenter in a
strong democracy. He means thus not to change the decision this time,
for it has been taken, but to bear witness to another point of view (and
thereby to keep the issue on the public agenda). (Barber 1984, 192)6 As
Barber's examples suggest, [dissent is not simply
resistance]{.underline} (e.g., Cooper 1995, chs. 2 and 7). [Dissenters
do not exit the political collective when they "lose" in a
discussion.]{.underline} [Neither do they simply change their minds, or
remain silent. Instead, to dissent is to maintain a principled
oppositional stance against a more powerful group while remaining
politically and publicly engaged]{.underline}. But the dissent that
Barber seems to have in mind here passes verbally between people who
remain participatory and deliberative equals, people who have equal
standing and membership within the strong democratic public. "I Holloway
Sparks 83 participated in the talk and deliberation leading to the
decision," says Barber's dissenter. Barber's dissenting actions are
undertaken by equals who are only temporarily ou\[t\]numbered during one
episode of public deliberation. But why limit dissent to interactions
within a decisionmaking community, between deliberative partners?
Barber's vision of citizenship and the minimal role reserved for dissent
would exclude from the realm of legitimate public action the important
activities undertaken by those citizens who are not in fact
participatory or deliberative equals. Barber and indeed most democratic
theorists pay no attention to actions that challenge the structure or
practices of political institutions, that highlight inequality and
exclusion within the collective, that assert independence on the part of
those citizens who are less powerful, that are intended to educate or
change the minds of the more powerful, or that challenge the boundaries
of the political itself[. By focusing almost exclusively on the debates
and deliberative interactions of those citizens on the "inside," most
democratic theorists have missed the important dissident activities of
those citizens on the "outside."]{.underline} [We clearly need to
consider these forms of dissident citizen action as central to an
adequate conception of democratic citizenship. To dissent, whether one
has an acknowledged place at the deliberative table or not, is to be an
engaged, active, self-govemed citizen. To dissent when one faces
domination and oppression, furthermore, marks a level of commitment to
participatory democracy rarely matched by nondissenting citizens.
Dissent has been a persistent, if sometimes vexing, visitor in the house
of democracy; perhaps it is time to unpack its bags, welcome it home,
and acknowledge its rightful place in our democratic lives.]{.underline}

#### **A combination of dissent and confidence provides an avenue for oppressed communities to participate and engage in politics.** 

**Sparks 97,** Sparks, Holloway. "Dissident Citizenship: Democratic
Theory, Political Courage, and Activist Women." Hypatia, vol. 12, no. 4,
1997, pp. 74--110. JSTOR, JSTOR,
[www.jstor.org/stable/3810734](http://www.jstor.org/stable/3810734).

In this essay, \[I\] have argued that [an adequate account of
citizenship should recognize both dissent and courage as crucial
elements of democratic life]{.underline}. In particular, [a theoretical
conception of dissident citizenship should attend to four dimensions of
dissent: oppositional, democratic, noninstitutionalized interactions
between unequal publics; discursive, performative, organizational, and
"everyday" dissenting actions]{.underline} within and among those
publics that augment or replace institutionalized forms of democratic
opposition; the material and institutional conditions that shape the
dissenting actions between unequal publics; and the ideas and discourses
that shape and influence dissidence, especially discourses about
democracy, citizenship, dissent, and courage. There are five broader
contributions of this perspective on dissent and courage. First, by
drawing attention to the importance of dissident democratic citizenship,
this approach encourages democratic theorists to pay closer attention to
dissident activities, and consequently to those people for whom the
promise of democracy has not been fulfilled. By recognizing the
political agency of dissidents and "marginals" as the agency of
citizens, democratic theorists can provide a richer account of
democratic citizenship than can theories that focus solely on sanctioned
deliberation. Second, by incorporating an ethic of political courage
into our conception of citizenship, this approach fills an additional
gap in our understanding of democracy as joint deliberation and action.
Political courage is important because it enables us to act and
communicate when faced with fear and uncertainty. Fear and uncertainty
are certainly confronted by dissidents who act in a context of
inequality, but this approach also suggests that courage is Holloway
Sparks 101 necessary for all citizens, not just those engaged in
dissent. As long as we think engaging in politics is something more than
"who gets what, when, and how," the challenges of conflict, connection,
and accountability will lie at the heart of being a citizen. Even if we
manage to eliminate the major inequalities that characterize our current
political environment, engaging in conflict and connection are risky
activities and will not happen (or will not happen well) without
courageous citizens. By scrutinizing the courage necessary for
dissidence, therefore, this perspective also explores the nature of a
practice that is fundamental to human beings who wish to communicate and
act together in the world. Third, this approach highlights the
limitations of the public-private split as it is commonly understood and
incorporated into democratic theories of citizenship. [By attending to
the dissident practices of marginals, and especially the dissident
practices of women marginals, this approach encourages democratic
theorists to broaden their understanding of where political
participation takes place, and to credit women for their public
activities]{.underline} (including dissent) [that occur in spheres and
locations traditionally viewed as private or apolitical]{.underline}.
Fourth, this approach encourages democratic theorists and others
interested in citizenship to examine the impact of race, class, gender,
and sexuality on democratic participation. Critically exploring how the
dissident and deliberative practices of women and other marginals are
negotiated and constructed respects the feminist call to examine gender
as it intersects and interacts with race, class, and sexuality in the
world. Finally, [this approach participates in the reclaiming of
courageous dissent as an important political practice for women and
other agents who face discrimination and oppression.]{.underline} [When
women and other dissidents conceive of themselves as courageous, new
possibilities for action as citizens are opened]{.underline}. As Mary
Dietz has suggested, by remembering and bringing to light the many
examples of courageous democratic practices already in existence, we
provide inspiration for activists still to come (Dietz 1987, 79).

#### Public discussion of arms sales key exposing the criminal actions of the government. 

**Hartung 16 **(William, director of arms and security project at the
center for international policy, 7/30/16, "The US government is
literally talking about arming the world, nobody's even talking about
it", <https://www.motherjones.com/politics/2016/07/tomdispatch-dc-congress-defense-international-arms-business/>)

**It's** [not that]{.underline} no one writes about [aspects of the arms
trade. There are occasional pieces that, for example, take note of the
impact of US weapons transfers, including cluster bombs, to Saudi
Arabia]{.underline}**, or of** the [disastrous dispensation of weaponry
to US allies in Syria, or of foreign sales of the costly, controversial
F-35 combat aircraft. And once in a while, if a foreign leader meets
with the president, US arms sales to his or her country might generate
an article or two. But the sheer size of the American arms trade, the
politics that drive it, the companies that profit from it, and its
devastating global impacts are rarely discussed, much less analyzed in
any depth.]{.underline} So here's a question that's puzzled me for years
(and I'm something of an arms wonk): [Why do other major US
exports]{.underline}---from Hollywood movies to Midwestern grain
shipments to Boeing airliners---[garner regular coverage]{.underline}
while trends in weapons exports remain in relative obscurity? [Are we
ashamed of standing essentially alone as the world's No. 1 arms dealer,
or is our Weapons "R" Us role so commonplace that we take it for
granted, like death or taxes?]{.underline} The numbers should stagger
anyone. According to the latest figures available from the Congressional
Research Service, the United States was credited with more than half the
value of all global arms transfer agreements in 2014, the most recent
year for which full statistics are available. At 14 percent, the world's
second largest supplier, Russia, lagged far behind. Washington's
leadership in this field has never truly been challenged. The US share
has fluctuated between one-third and one-half of the global market for
the past two decades**,** [peaking at an almost monopolistic 70 percent
of all weapons sold in 2011. And the gold rush
continues]{.underline}**.** Vice Admiral Joe Rixey, who heads the
Pentagon's arms sales agency, euphemistically known as the [Defense
Security Cooperation Agency, estimates that arms deals facilitated by
the Pentagon topped \$46 billion in 2015, and are on track to hit \$40
billion in 2016. Arms deals are a way of life in
Washington]{.underline}. From the president on down, significant [parts
of the government are intent on ensuring that American arms will flood
the global market and companies]{.underline} like Lockheed and Boeing
will live the good life. From the president on his trips abroad to visit
allied world leaders to the secretaries of state and defense to the
staffs of US embassies, [American officials regularly act as salespeople
for the arms firms. And the Pentagon is their enabler]{.underline}**.**
From brokering, facilitating, and literally banking the money from arms
deals to transferring weapons to favored allies on the taxpayers' dime,
[it is in essence the world's largest arms dealer]{.underline}**.** In a
typical sale, [the US government is involved every step of the way. The
Pentagon often does assessments of an allied nation's armed forces in
order to tell them what they "need"---and of course what they always
need is billions of dollars in new US-supplied equipment]{.underline}.
Then the Pentagon helps negotiate the terms of the deal, notifies
Congress of its details, and collects the funds from the foreign buyer,
which it then gives to the US supplier in the form of a defense
contract. In most deals, the Pentagon is also the point of contact for
maintenance and spare parts for any US-supplied system. The bureaucracy
that helps make all of this happen, the Defense Security Cooperation
Agency, is funded from a 3.5 percent surcharge on the deals it
negotiates. This gives it all the more incentive to sell, sell, sell.
[The degree to which the Obama administration has been willing to bend
over backward to help weapons exporters was underscored at a 2013
hearing on those administration export "reforms]{.underline}." Tom
Kelly, then the deputy assistant secretary of the State Department's
Bureau of Political-Military Affairs, caught the spirit of the era when
asked whether the administration was doing enough to promote American
arms exports. He responded: "\[[We are\] advocating on behalf of our
companies and doing everything we can to make sure that these sales go
through...and that is something we are doing every day, basically \[on\]
every continent in the world...and we're constantly thinking of how we
can do better]{.underline}." One place where, with a helping hand from
the Obama administration and the Pentagon, the arms industry has been
doing a lot better of late is the Middle East. Washington has brokered
deals for more than \$50 billion in weapons sales to Saudi Arabia alone
for everything from F-15 fighter aircraft and Apache attack helicopters
to combat ships and missile defense systems. [The most damaging deals,
if not the most lucrative, have been the sales of bombs and missiles to
the Saudis for their brutal war in Yemen, where thousands of civilians
have been killed and millions of people are going hungry.
Members]{.underline} of Congress like Michigan Representative John
Conyers and Connecticut Senator Chris Murphy [have pressed for
legislation that would at least stem the flow of the most deadly of the
weaponry being sent for use there, but they have yet to overcome the
considerable clout of the Saudis in Washington]{.underline} (and, of
course, that of the arms industry as well). When it comes to the arms
business, however, there's no end to the good news from the Middle East.
Take the administration's proposed new 10-year aid deal with Israel. If
enacted as currently planned, it would boost US military assistance to
that country by up to 25 percent---to roughly \$4 billion per year. At
the same time, it would phase out a provision that had allowed Israel to
spend one-quarter of Washington's aid developing its own defense
industry. In other words, all that money, the full \$4 billion in
taxpayer dollars, will now flow directly into the coffers of companies
like Lockheed Martin, which is in the midst of completing a
multibillion-dollar deal to sell the Israelis F-35s.

### 2AC -- Ext - Law Key 

#### **The law shapes how we interpret and tell the narratives we create**

#### **Wharton '16 (Robin Wharton, Georgia State University, Derek Miller, Harvard University, "New Directions in Law and Narrative", Law, Culture and the Humanities 1--11, pp. 5-6, Accessed 7/29/18, PAS).** 

While the examples above focus on what narrative means to law,
**[law]{.underline}** also **[means much to narrative]{.underline}**,
particularly for writers such as Hayden White. White's discussion of
Hegel and the state's role in history's genesis highlights the law as an
essential condition of narrative: "**[Where there is no rule of law,
there can be neither a subject nor the kind of event which lends itself
to narrative representation."]{.underline}**14 For White, **["the
reality that lends itself to narrative representation is the conflict
between desire and the law." Perhaps even more significantly, "some
notion of the legal subject" must be present to "serve as the agent,
agency, and subject of historical narrative in all of its
manifestations, from the annals through the chronicle to the historical
discourse as we know it in its modern realizations and failures."
Notions of legal subjectivity underlie depictions of the subject in
narrative, whether that narrative subject acts within commonly accepted
legal bounds placed on individual agency, or whether that subject
transgresses or transcends such limits.]{.underline}** In White's
construction of history, [the law forms a sort of regulatory backdrop
against which events unfold and become visible and relatable as
narrative: If every fully realized story, however we define that
familiar but conceptually elusive entity, is a kind of allegory, points
to a moral, or endows events, whether real or imaginary]{.underline},
with a significance that they do not possess as a mere sequence, then it
seems possible to conclude that every historical narrative has as its
latent or manifest purpose the desire to moralize the events of which it
treats. Where there is ambiguity or ambivalence regarding the status of
the legal system, which is the form in which the subject encounters most
immediately the social system in which he is enjoined to achieve a full
humanity, the ground on which any closure of a story one might wish to
tell about a past, whether it be a private or public past, is lacking.
And this suggests that [narrativity, certainly in factual storytelling
and probably in fictional storytelling as well, is intimately related
to, if not a function of, the impulse to moralize reality, that is, to
identify it with the social system that is the source of any morality
that we can imagine.]{.underline}16 The law does more than circumscribe
action within a particular social context; it also exercises a profound
influence over the literary imagination. Mary L. Dudziak has recently
described "the way law makes an indelible mark, or acts as a
legitimizing force, affecting what historical actors imagine to be
possible," in the field of international relations.17 As White
challenges us to remember, **[law contributes substantially to how we
write and interpret the stories that we tell about ourselves and our
history.]{.underline}** We only know the law through the narratives we
create about it -- narratives that include statutes and judicial
decisions. And these legal narratives, like medieval chronicles and
Victorian novels, are generated by a fundamental epistemological
"impulse to moralize reality, that is to identify it with the social
system that is the source of any morality that we can imagine,"18 or to
put it another way, a desire to know the law. At the same time, the law
itself provides an essential condition for the legibility of all
narratives, both legal and non-legal. For example, Stephen Best has
asked us to consider, "How does the 'form' in the commodity form
generate social phenomena in ways that are neither mechanical
(historical causality) nor fully contingent (analogy)?"19 In stitching
together a history of property law in the United States, Best
demonstrates how a particular "figure of the person," one in which
personhood itself is increasingly figured as a species of property in a
wide variety of contexts, moved from law into culture and from culture
into the law.20 As a consequence, in spite of the potential discursive
discontinuities created by emancipation and constitutional amendment,
antebellum juridical constructions such as the "fugitive" continued to
inform the genesis and evolution of Equal Protection jurisprudence after
the Civil War.21 To see law and narrative as mutually interdependent as
Best or White does is to understand, as Jackson suggests, that the
"events" in a legal narrative include more than the transaction that
gives rise to a particular case, or the actions of lawyers, litigants,
and witnesses at trial. Such a perspective also opens the door to
considering aesthetics, poetics, and other aspects of form as essential
characteristics of sound legal decision-making. They are not mere
ornamentation of judicial process but perhaps as influential in shaping
the judicial process as the doctrine of stare decisis or the rules of
evidence. [If law is narrative then we must read legal narratives as
attempts at representation (rather than acts of perfect mimesis),
attempts that depend upon familiar strategies and tropes found in other
narrative genres, including fiction.]{.underline}

[Debate is a **means of settling differences**,]{.underline} [so there
**must be a**]{.underline} difference of opinion or a **[conflict of

in agreement]{.underline}** on a tact or value or policy, [there is **no
need for debate**]{.underline}: **[the matter can be settled by
unanimous consent]{.underline}**. Thus, for example, [it would be

statement. ([Controversy is an essential prerequisite]{.underline} of
debate. [Where there is no clash of ideas]{.underline}, proposals,
interests, or expressed positions on issues, **[there is no
debate]{.underline}**. In addition, [debate **cannot produce effective
decisions**]{.underline} [without **clear identification of a question
or questions to be answered**]{.underline}. For example, **[general
argument may occur about the broad topic of illegal
immigration]{.underline}**. [How many]{.underline} illegal immigrants
[are in the United States?]{.underline} What is the impact of illegal
immigration and immigrants on our economy? What is their impact on our
communities? Do they commit crimes? [Do they take job]{.underline}s from
American workers? Do they pay taxes? Do they require social services? Is
it a problem that some do not speak English? [Is it the responsibility
of employers to discourage illegal immigration]{.underline} by not
hiring undocumented workers? Should they have the opportunity- to gain
citizenship? Docs illegal immigration pose a security threat to our
country? [Do illegal immigrants do work that American workers are
unwilling to do?]{.underline} Are their rights as workers and as human
beings at risk due to their status? Are they abused by employers, law
enforcement, housing, and businesses? I low are their families impacted
by their status? What is the moral and philosophical obligation of a
nation state to maintain its borders? [Should we build a wall on the
Mexican border]{.underline}, establish a national identification can!,
or enforce existing laws against employers? Should we invite immigrants
to become U.S. citizens? [Surely you can think of many more concerns to
be addressed by a conversation about the topic area of illegal
immigration. Participation in this \"debate\" is likely to be emotional
and intense. However, it is **not likely to be productive or useful
without focus on a particular question**]{.underline} [and
identification of a line **demarcating sides in the
controversy**]{.underline}. To be discussed and resolved effectively,
**[controversies must be stated clearly]{.underline}**. **[Vague
understanding]{.underline}** [results in **unfocused deliberation** and
**poor decisions**]{.underline}, frustration, and emotional distress, as
**[evidenced by the failure of the United States Congress to make
progress on the immigration debate during the summer of

[Someone disturbed by the problem of the growing underclass of poorly
educated, socially disenfranchised youths might observe, \"Public
schools are doing a terrible job!]{.underline} They are overcrowded, and
many teachers are poorly qualified in their subject areas. Even the best
teachers can do little more than struggle to maintain order in their
classrooms.\" That same concerned citizen, facing a complex range of
issues, might arrive at an unhelpful decision, such as \"We ought to do
something about this\" or. worse. \"It\'s too complicated a problem to
deal with.\" [Groups of concerned citizens worried about the state of
public education could join together to express their
frustrations]{.underline}, anger, disillusionment, and emotions
regarding the schools, **[but without a focus for their
discussions]{.underline}**, [they could easily agree about the sorry
state of education **without finding points of clarity or potential
solutions.**]{.underline} **[A gripe session would
follow]{.underline}**. [But if a **precise question** is
posed]{.underline}---such as \"What can be done to improve public
education?\"---[then a more **profitable area of discussion** is opened
up]{.underline} [**simply by placing a focus on the search** for a
concrete solution step]{.underline}. [One or more judgments can be
phrased in the form of debate propositions, motions for parliamentary
debate, or bills for legislative assemblies.]{.underline} The statements
\"Resolved: That the federal government should implement a program of
charter schools in at-risk communities\" and \"Resolved: That the state
of Florida should adopt a school voucher program\" more clearly identify
specific ways of dealing with educational problems in a manageable form,
suitable for debate. [They provide specific policies to be investigated
and aid discussants in identifying points of difference.]{.underline}

[To have a **productive debate, which facilitates effective decision
making**]{.underline} [by]{.underline} directing and **[placing limits
on the decision]{.underline}** to be made, **[the basis for argument
should be clearly defined]{.underline}**. [If we merely talk about
\"homelessness\" or \"abortion\" or \"crime\'\* or \"global warming\" we
are likely to have an interesting discussion but not to establish
profitable basis for argument]{.underline}. For example, **[the
statement \"Resolved: That the pen is mightier than the sword\" is
debatable, yet fails to provide much basis for clear
argumentation]{.underline}**. If we take this statement to mean that the
written word is more effective than physical force for some purposes, we
can identify a problem area: the comparative effectiveness of writing or
physical force for a specific purpose.

[Although we now have a **general subject**]{.underline}, we have not
yet stated a problem. **[It is still too broad]{.underline}**, too
loosely worded to promote well-organized argument. [What sort of writing
are we concerned with]{.underline}---poems, novels, government
documents, website development, advertising, or what? [What does
\"effectiveness\" mean]{.underline} in this context? What kind of
physical force is being compared---fists, dueling swords, bazookas,
nuclear weapons, or what? A more specific question might be. \"Would a
mutual defense treaty or a visit by our fleet be more effective in
assuring Liurania of our support in a certain crisis?\" [The basis for
argument could be phrased in a **debate proposition**]{.underline} such
as \"Resolved: That the United States should enter into a mutual defense
treatv with Laurania.\" Negative advocates might oppose this proposition
by arguing that fleet maneuvers would be a better solution. **[This is
not to say that debates should completely avoid creative
interpretation]{.underline}** of the controversy by advocates,
[or]{.underline} [**that good debates cannot occur over competing
interpretations of the controversy**; in fact, **these sorts of debates
may be very engaging**. The point is that debate is best facilitated by
the guidance provided by **focus on a particular point of difference**,
which will be outlined in the following discussion.]{.underline}

#### Competitive debate is a dialogue between two teams. Their willful refusal to defend the resolution is an act to exclude the negative from meaningful participation in the dialogue. Placing a priority on a balanced topic exists to provide a voice for both sides.

**Galloway, 7** --professor of communication at Samford University
(Ryan, "DINNER AND CONVERSATION AT THE ARGUMENTATIVE TABLE:
RECONCEPTUALIZING DEBATE AS AN ARGUMENTATIVE DIALOGUE", *Contemporary
Argumentation and Debate,* Vol. 28 (2007), ebsco)

[Debate as a dialogue sets an argumentative table, where all parties
receive a relatively fair opportunity to voice their
position.]{.underline} Anything that fails to allow participants to have
their position articulated denies one side of the argumentative table a
fair hearing. [The affirmative side is set by the topic and fairness
requirements]{.underline}. While affirmative teams have recently
resisted affirming the topic, in fact, the topic selection process is
rigorous, taking the relative ground of each topic as its central point
of departure. [Setting the affirmative reciprocally sets the negative.
The negative crafts approaches to the topic consistent with affirmative
demands]{.underline}. The negative crafts disadvantages, counter-plans,
and critical arguments premised on the arguments that the topic allows
for the affirmative team. [According to fairness norms, each side sits
at a relatively balanced argumentative table]{.underline}. [When one
side takes more than its share, competitive equity suffers]{.underline}.
[However, it also undermines the respect due to the other involved in
the dialogue. When one side excludes the other, it fundamentally denies
the personhood of the other participant]{.underline} (Ehninger, 1970, p.
110). [A pedagogy of debate as dialogue takes this respect as a
fundamental component. A desire to be fair is a fundamental condition of
a dialogue that takes the form of a demand for equality of
voice]{.underline}. [Far from being a banal request for links to a
disadvantage, fairness is a demand for respect, a demand to be heard, a
demand that a voice backed by literally months upon months of
preparation, research, and critical thinking not be
silenced]{.underline}. [Affirmative cases that suspend basic fairness
norms operate to exclude particular negative strategies. Unprepared, one
side comes to the argumentative table unable to meaningfully participate
in a dialogue.]{.underline} [They are unable to "understand what 'went
on...'" and are left to the whims of time and power]{.underline}
(Farrell, 1985, p. 114). Hugh Duncan furthers this line of reasoning:
*[Opponents not only tolerate but honor and respect each other because
in doing so they enhance their own chances of thinking better and
reaching sound decisions]{.underline}. Opposition is necessary because
it sharpens thought in action. We assume that argument, discussion, and
talk, among free an informed people who subordinate decisions of any
kind, because [it is only through such discussion that we reach
agreement which binds us to a common cause...If we are to be
equal...relationships among equals must find expression in many formal
and informal institutions]{.underline}* (Duncan, 1993, p. 196-197).
[Debate compensates for the exigencies of the world by offering a
framework that maintains equality for the sake of the
conversation]{.underline} (Farrell, 1985, p. 114). For example, [an
affirmative case]{.underline} on the 2007-2008 college topic [might
defend neither state nor]{.underline} international [action]{.underline}
in the Middle East, [and yet claim to be germane to the topic in some
way. The case essentially denies the arguments that state action is
oppressive or that actions]{.underline} in the international arena [are
philosophically or pragmatically suspect. Instead of allowing for the
dialogue to be modified by the interchange of the affirmative case and
the negative response, the affirmative subverts any meaningful role to
the negative team, preventing them from offering effective
"counter-word" and undermining the value of a meaningful exchange of
speech acts. Germaneness and other substitutes for topical action do not
accrue the dialogical benefits of topical advocacy]{.underline}.

#### Resolutional Debates are key to clash

**Galloway 07** (Ryan Galloway, DINNER AND CONVERSATION AT THE
ARGUMENTATIVE TABLE: RECONCEPTUALIZING DEBATE AS AN ARGUMENTATIVE
DIALOGUE, Samford University Contemporary Argumentation and Debate The
Journal of the Cross Examination Debate Association Volume 28 2007
Edited by Allan D. Louden Wake Forest University // AH

[Much of the controversy involves the resolution itself, and whether
teams should have to defend the resolution, or whether they can mount a
broader criticism of the activity]{.underline} (Snider, 2003). Steve
Woods notes that, "Academic debate is now entering a third state, a
critical turn in the activity. The identifying element of this change is
that abandonment of the role playing that the construct of fiat enabled"
(Woods, 2003, p. 87). This journal previously (2004) addressed issues
regarding the growing divide in policy debate. However[, the role of the
debate resolution in the clash of civilizations was largely ignored.
Here, I defend the notion that activist approaches of critical debaters
can best flourish if grounded in topical advocacy defined in terms of
the resolution. This approach encourages the pedagogical benefits of
debates about discourse and representations while preserving the
educational advantages of switch-side debate. Debaters' increased
reliance on speech act and performativity theory in debates generates a
need to step back and re-conceptualize the false dilemma of the "policy
only" or "kritik only" perspective.]{.underline} [Policy debate's
theoretical foundations should find root in an overarching theory of
debate that incorporates both policy and critical
exchanges]{.underline}. Here, I will seek to **[conceptualize debate as
a dialogue]{.underline}**, following the theoretical foundations of
Mikhail Bakhtin (1990) and Star Muir (1993) that connects the benefits
of dialogical modes of argument to competitive debate. Ideally, the
resolution should function to negotiate traditional and activist
approaches. [Taking the resolution as an invitation to a dialogue about
a particular set of ideas would preserve the affirmative team's
obligation to uphold the debate resolution. At the same time, this
approach licenses debaters to argue both discursive and performative
advantages.]{.underline} **[While this view is broader than many policy
teams would like, and certainly more limited than many critical teams
would prefer, this approach captures the advantages of both modes of
debate while maintaining the stable axis point of argumentation for a
full clash of ideas around these values.]{.underline}**

#### Without limits on the federal government their only limit is their imaginations

**Smith 15** (Kyle Smith, American critic, novelist, and essayist. He is
a former film critic for the New York Post. and is currently
critic-at-large at National Review, "We need a resistance movement to
stop out-of-control government",06-14-15)/

Say you're a small business owner. A dentist. A landscaper. A citizen
who feels he's drowning in needless government-imposed bureaucracy. You
can whine about it. You can
[vote](https://nypost.com/2015/06/14/a-resistance-movement-is-the-only-way-to-stop-out-of-control-government/)
for politicians you hope will lighten your load, even though you know
they never will. Or you can fight back. It's far too late to roll back
the tide of government, argues Charles Murray in his new book "By the
People: Rebuilding Liberty Without Permission" (Crown Forum). Starting
in the New Deal years, the Supreme Court stepped down from its 150-year
mission of limiting the scope of government according to the
restrictions laid out in the constitution. [In 1942, the court decided
that the Commerce Clause became]{.underline} (in the words of federal
judge Alex Kozinski), [the "Hey, You Can Do Anything You Like
Clause."]{.underline} At that time the court ruled, absurdly, that the
federales could fine an Ohio farmer for producing 239 more bushels of
wheat than allowed by the Agricultural Adjustment Act, even though he
consumed most of the wheat himself and sold the remainder nearby, on the
theory that what he was doing solely in Ohio amounted to "interstate
commerce." [In the same era, the Constitutional phrase authorizing laws
for the "general welfare" became another blank check. As Murray points
out, the meaning of "general welfare" was hashed out at great length
during debate about the Constitution.]{.underline} Both Madison and
Hamilton argued vigorously that "general welfare" was merely a phrase
meant to introduce the enumerated powers --- the specific acts to which
the federal government is limited. [The notion that Washington could do
whatever it liked provided the result was said to be for "general
welfare" would have struck the Framers as absurd. Today, federal
agencies, using those Supreme Court decisions and vaguely worded
statutes, are constrained only by the limits of their
imaginations.]{.underline} As Tocqueville foresaw, government now
"covers the surface of society with a network of small, complicated
rules, minute and uniform." [We live not under tyranny but a state that
"compresses, enervates, extinguishes, and stupefies a
people."]{.underline} Effect change through the ballot box? Not a
chance. [There are two parties. One is for big government, the other is
for really shockingly huge government.]{.underline} Murray has lost
patience with the ordinary democratic process. He suggests willful,
determined, sustained resistance: "to make large portions of the Federal
Code of Regulations unenforceable. I want to make government into an
insurable hazard, like flood, fire, or locusts." He proposes the Madison
Fund. [Philanthropists, are you listening? This would be an attack squad
of lawyers on call to protect and defend Constitutional limits on
government.]{.underline} Getting slimed by bureaucrats? Call Govbusters.
Murray envisions the lawyers telling the government agents, "We are
taking over this man's case. We will litigate it as long as it takes. We
will publicize this litigation that will embarrass you and your
superiors. None of this will cost our client a penny, and we will
reimburse him for any fine you are able to impose. And if you come back
and bother him again, we will go through the whole process again." They
throw the book at you? Catch it, and throw it back. That's why God gave
us lawyers. This time they're on your side. [The Madison Fund would have
three purposes: To defend those who are innocent of regulatory charges
brought against them; to defend those who are technically guilty of
violating nonsensical regulations, in order to maximize the burden on
the government; and to generate as much publicity as possible to bring
public pressure to bear on the agencies and the elected and appointed
officials who oversee them.]{.underline} Would it work? Maybe not.
Wouldn't it be fun to try, though? Consider the amount of [money
spent](https://nypost.com/2015/06/14/a-resistance-movement-is-the-only-way-to-stop-out-of-control-government/)
in the 2012 campaign season: billions of dollars, and neither the White
House nor the Senate nor the House changed hands. [A single mischievous
billionaire could stir up a lot of trouble by seeding the Madison Fund.
What will the future look like? Ever-increasing government-fueled
stagnation and sclerosis? Murray thinks the country is inherently too
powerful, free and individualistic for that to happen. "National wealth
that dwarfs today's, and technology that gives the individual access to
total information and the ability to apply that information to everyday
life: Under those]{.underline}
[conditions](https://nypost.com/2015/06/14/a-resistance-movement-is-the-only-way-to-stop-out-of-control-government/)[,
it is unimaginable to me that Americans will still think the best way to
live is to be governed by armies of bureaucrats enforcing thousands of
minutely prescriptive rules. "Somehow," Murray believes, "the American
polity will have evolved toward more efficient ways of working and
living together." America stands alone. We're the only country built on
a basic framework structured to limit the reach of government and
empower individuals instead. If Murray is right, there is a way to
restore that promise.]{.underline}

### 2AC -- Ext -- Legal Education

#### **We have a responsibility as scholars to evaluate the policy debate - we shape decision making**

#### Edkins and Zehfussi 5 (Review of International Studies (2005),31,p. 454-5)

What **[we are attempting]{.underline}** in this article is **[an
intervention that demonstrates how]{.underline}** the illusion of
**[the]{.underline}** sovereign **[state]{.underline}** in an insecure
and anarchic international system is sustained and how it **[might be
challenged.]{.underline}** It seems to us that **[this has become
important]{.underline}** in the present circumstances. The focus on
security and the dilemma of security versus freedom that is set out in
debates immediately **[after September 11th]{.underline}**
**[presents]{.underline}** an apparent choice as **[the focus for
dissent]{.underline}**, while concealing the extent to which thinking is
thereby confined to a specific agenda. Our argument will be that this
approach relies on a particular picture of the political world that has
been reflected within the discipline of international relations, a
picture of a world of sovereign states. **[We have a responsibility as
scholars; we are not insulated from the policy world. What we discuss
may not]{.underline}**, and indeed does not, **[have a direct impact on
what happens in the policy world,]{.underline}** this is clear, **[but
our writings]{.underline}** and our teaching **[do]{.underline}**
**[have an input in terms of the creation]{.underline}** and
reproduction **[of pictures of the world that inform
policy]{.underline}** and set the contours of policy debates.21
Moreover, the discipline within which we are situated is one which
depends itself on a particular view of the world -- a view that sees the
international as a realm of politics distinct from the domestic -- the
same view of the world as the one that underpins thinking on security
and defence in the US administration.22 In this article then we develop
an analysis of the ways in which thinking in terms of international
relations and a system of states forecloses certain possibilities from
the start, and how it might look to think about politics and the
international differently. **[The truth is often disturbing.
Our]{.underline}** impressive American **[victories against terrorism
and rogue states]{.underline}**, although proper and indispensable,
**[are]{.underline}** inevitably **[limited]{.underline}**. The words of
the great Irish poet Yeats reveal, prophetically, where our entire
planet is now clearly heading. **[Watching violence
escalate]{.underline}** and expand in parts of Europe and Russia, in
Northern Ireland, in Africa, in Southwest Asia, in Latin America, and of
course in the Middle East, **[we discover]{.underline}** with certainty
**[that]{.underline}** \"\... the centre cannot hold/Mere **[anarchy is
loosed upon the world]{.underline}**/The blood-dimmed tide is loosed/and
everywhere The Ceremony of innocence is drowned.\" **[Our
response]{.underline}**, even after Operation Iraqi Freedom, **[lacks
conviction]{.underline}**. Still **[pretending that \"things will get
better,\" we]{.underline}** Americans **[proceed]{.underline}**
diligently **[with our day-to-day affairs, content that, somehow, the
worst can never really happen]{.underline}**. Although it is true that
we must go on with our normal lives, it is also true that \"**[normal\"
has]{.underline}** now **[become a]{.underline}** quaint and
**[delusionary state]{.underline}**. We want to be sure that a \"new\"
normal falls within the boundaries of human tolerance, but we can\'t
nurture such a response without an informed appreciation of what is
still possible. For us, other rude awakenings are unavoidable, some of
which could easily overshadow the horrors of Sept. 11. There can be
little doubt that, **[within a few short years, expanding tribalism will
produce several new genocides and proliferating nuclear weapons will
generate]{.underline}** one or more **[regional nuclear
wars.]{.underline}** Paralyzed by fear and restrained by impotence,
various governments will try, desperately, to deflect our attention, but
it will be a vain effort. Caught up in a vast chaos from which no real
escape is possible, **[we will learn too late that there is no durable
safety]{.underline}** in arms, no ultimate rescue by authority, no
genuine remedy in science or technology.  What shall we do? For a start,
we must all begin to look carefully behind the news. **[Rejecting
superficial analyses of day-to-day events in favor of penetrating
assessments]{.underline}** of world affairs, **[we]{.underline}** must
**[learn]{.underline}** quickly **[to distinguish what is]{.underline}**
truly **[important]{.underline}** from what is merely entertainment.
**[With]{.underline}** such **[learning, we Americans could prepare
for]{.underline}** growing **[worldwide anarchy]{.underline}** not as
immobilized objects of false contentment, but as authentic citizens of
an endangered planet.  **[Nowhere is it written that we people of Earth
are forever]{.underline}**, that humankind must thwart the
long-prevailing trend among all planetary life-forms (more than 99
percent) of ending in extinction. Aware of this, **[we
may]{.underline}** yet **[survive]{.underline}**, at least **[for a
while]{.underline}**, but only if our collective suppression of
purposeful fear is augmented by a complementary wisdom; that is, that
our personal mortality is undeniable and that the harms done by one
tribal state or terror group against \"others\" will never confer
immortality. This is, admittedly, a difficult concept to understand, but
the longer we humans are shielded from such difficult concepts the
shorter will be our time remaining. We must also look closely at higher
education in the United States, not from the shortsighted stance of
improving test scores, but from the urgent perspective of confronting
extraordinary threats to human survival. For the moment,
**[some]{.underline}** college **[students are exposed to]{.underline}**
an occasional course in what is fashionably described as **[\"global
awareness,\"]{.underline}** but such exposure usually sidesteps the
overriding issues: **[We]{.underline}** now **[face a deteriorating
world system]{.underline}** that cannot be mended through sensitivity
alone; **[our leaders are dangerously unprepared]{.underline}** to deal
with catastrophic deterioration; our schools are altogether incapable of
transmitting the indispensable visions of planetary restructuring.  To
institute productive student confrontations with survival imperatives,
colleges and universities must soon take great risks, detaching
themselves from a time-dishonored preoccupation with \"facts\" in favor
of grappling with true life-or-death questions. In raising these
questions, it will not be enough to send some students to study in Paris
or Madrid or Amsterdam (\"study abroad\" is not what is meant by serious
global awareness). Rather, **[all students must be made
aware]{.underline}** - as a primary objective of the curriculum **[- of
where we are heading, as a species,]{.underline}** and where our limited
survival alternatives may yet be discovered.  There are, of course, many
particular ways in which colleges and universities could operationalize
real global awareness, but one way, long-neglected, would be best. I
refer to the study of international law. For a country that celebrates
the rule of law at all levels, and which explicitly makes international
law part of the law of the United States - the \"supreme law of the
land\" according to the Constitution and certain Supreme Court
decisions - this should be easy enough to understand. Anarchy, after
all, is the absence of law, and knowledge of international law is
necessarily prior to adequate measures of world order reform.  Before
international law can be taken seriously, and before \"the blood-dimmed
tide\" can be halted, America\'s future leaders must at least have some
informed acquaintance with pertinent rules and procedures. Otherwise we
shall surely witness the birth of a fully ungovernable world order, an
unheralded and sinister arrival in which only a shadowy legion of
gravediggers would wield the forceps.

### 2AC -- Ext -- Legal education - Simulation

#### Simulation of different roles through fiat encourages learning and empowerment

**Innes and Booher '99** (Judith, Director -- Institute of Urban and
Regional Development and Professor at UC Berkeley and David, Visiting
Scholar at the Institute, Journal of the American Planning Association,
Winter, Vol. 65, Iss. 1)

Our observation and practice of consensus building suggests that the
analogy to **[role-playing]{.underline}** games **[will]{.underline}**
help to **[illuminate the]{.underline}** dynamic of **[effective
consensus processes]{.underline}**. Even **[when the dispute seems
intractable, role playing]{.underline}** in consensus building **[allows
players to let go of]{.underline}** actual or assumed
**[constraints]{.underline}** **[and]{.underline}** to **[develop ideas
for]{.underline}** creating **[new]{.underline}** conditions and
**[possibilities]{.underline}**. Drama and suspension of reality allows
competing, even bitterly opposed interests to collaborate, and engages
individual players emotionally over many months. Scenario building and
storytelling can make collective sense of complexity, of **[predicting
possibilities in an uncertain world, and can allow the]{.underline}**
playful **[imagination, which people normally suppress, to go to
work.]{.underline}** In the course of engaging in various roles,
participants develop identities for themselves and others and become
more effective participants, representing their stakeholders\' interests
more clearly. In many of their most productive moments, **[participants
in consensus building engage]{.underline}** not only **[in playing out
scenarios]{.underline}**, but also in a kind of collective, speculative
tinkering, or bricolage, similar in principle to what game participants
do. That is, they play with heterogeneous concepts, strategies, and
actions with which various individuals in the group have experience, and
try combining them until they create a new scenario that they
collectively believe will work. **[This]{.underline}** bricolage,
discussed further below, **[is a type of reasoning and collective
creativity]{.underline}** fundamentally different from the more familiar
types, **[argumentation and tradeoffs]{.underline}**.\[sup11\] **[The
latter modes of problem solving]{.underline}** or dispute resolution
typically **[allow zero sum allocation of resources]{.underline}** among
participants or finding the actions acceptable to everyone. Bricolage,
however, produces, rather than a solution to a known problem, a new way
of framing the situation and of developing unanticipated combinations of
actions that are qualitatively different from the options on the table
at the outset. The result of this collective tinkering with new
scenarios is, most importantly, learning and change among the players,
and growth in their sophistication about each other, about the issues,
and about the futures they could seek. Both consensus building and
**[roleplaying]{.underline}** games **[center on learning, innovation,
and change]{.underline}**, in a process that is entertaining and-when
conducted effectively-in some fundamental sense empowers individuals.

#### Utopian policy proposals are valuable even if they are never enacted---they still put pressure on power to accede to demands and create a vision for social change

**Streeten 99** (Paul, Development, v. 42 n.2 ingenta)

First, **[Utopian thinking can be useful]{.underline}** as a framework
for analysis. Just as physicists assume an atmospheric vacuum for some
purposes, so **[policy analysts can assume a political vacuum from which
they can start afresh.]{.underline}** The physicists' assumption plainly
would not be useful for the design of parachutes, but can serve other
purposes well. Similarly, when thinking of tomorrow's problems,
**[Utopianism]{.underline}** is not helpful. But for long-term strategic
purposes it **[is essential]{.underline}**. Second, **[the Utopian
vision gives a sense of direction]{.underline}**, which can get lost in
approaches that are preoccupied with the feasible. **[In a world that is
regarded as]{.underline}** the **[second-best]{.underline}** of all
feasible worlds, **[everything becomes a necessary constraint. All
vision is lost]{.underline}**. Third, **[excessive concern with the
feasible tends to reinforce the status quo.]{.underline}** In
negotiations, it strengthens the hand of those opposed to any reform.
Unless the case for change can be represented in the same detail as the
case for no change, it tends to be lost. Fourth, it is sometimes the
case that the conjuncture of **[circumstances changes quite
suddenly]{.underline}** and that the constellation of forces,
unexpectedly, turns out to be favourable to even radical innovation.
**[Unless we are prepared with a carefully worked out]{.underline}**,
detailed **[plan]{.underline}**, that yesterday **[could have appeared
utterly Utopian, the reformers will lose out by default]{.underline}**.
Only a few years ago nobody would have expected the end of communism in
Central and Eastern Europe, the disappearance of the Soviet Union, the
unification of Germany, the break-up of Yugoslavia, the marketization of
China, the end of apartheid in South Africa. And the handshake on the
White House lawn between Mr Peres and Mr Arafat. Fifth, the **[Utopian
reformers themselves can constitute a pressure group, countervailing
the]{.underline}** self interested **[pressures of the obstructionist
groups]{.underline}**. **[Ideas thought to be Utopian have become
realistic]{.underline}** at moments in history **[when large numbers of
people support them]{.underline}**, and those in power have to yield to
their demands. **[The demand for ending slavery is a historical
example]{.underline}**. It is for these five reasons that **[Utopians
should not be discouraged from formulating]{.underline}** their
**[proposals]{.underline}** and from thinking the unthinkable,
unencumbered by the inhibitions and obstacles of political constraints.
They should elaborate them in the same detail that the defenders of the
status quo devote to its elaboration and celebration. **[Utopianism and
idealism will]{.underline}** then **[turn out to be the most realistic
vision.]{.underline}** It is well known that there are three types of
economists: those who can count and those who can't. But being able to
count up to two, I want to distinguish between two types of people. Let
us call them, for want of a better name, the Pedants and the Utopians.
The names are due to Peter Berger, who uses them in a different context.
The Pedants or technicians are those who know all the details about the
way things are and work, and they have acquired an emotional vested
interest in keeping them this way. I have come across them in the
British civil service, in the bureaucracy ofthe World Bank, and
elsewhere. They are admirable people but they are conservative, and no
good companions for reform. On the other hand, there are **[the
Utopians]{.underline}**, the idealists, the visionaries who dare think
the unthinkable. They **[are]{.underline}** also
**[admirable]{.underline}**, many of them young people. But they lack
the attention to detail that the Pedants have. **[When the day of the
revolution comes, they will have entered it]{.underline}** on the wrong
date in their diaries and fail to turn up, or, if they do turn up, they
will be on the wrong side of the barricades. What we need is a marriage
between the Pedants and the Utopians, between the technicians who pay
attention to the details and the idealists who have the vision of a
better future. There will be tensions in combining the two, but they
will be creative tensions. We need Pedantic Utopian Pedants who will
work out in considerable detail the ideal world and ways of getting to
it, and promote the good cause with informed fantasy. Otherwise, when
the opportunity arises, we shall miss it for lack of preparedness and
lose out to the opponents of reform, to those who want to preserve the
status quo.

#### Roleplaying is necessary to refuse our construction as passive client citizens---it's a more effective form of politics 

**Kulynych 97** [ ]{.underline}(Jessica, Winthrop University, Polity,
Winter, p. 344-5)

Unfortunately, it is precisely these **[elements of citizen action that
cannot be explained by]{.underline}** a **[theory]{.underline}** of
communicative action.  It is here that a performative conception of
political action implicitly informs Hager's discussion.  **[From a
performative perspective, the goal of action is not only to secure a
realm for deliberative politics, but to disrupt and
resist]{.underline}** the **[norms and identities]{.underline}** that
structure such a realm and its participants.  **[While Habermas
theorizes that political solutions will emerge from dialogue, a
performative understanding of participation highlights the limits of
dialogue]{.underline}** and the creative and often uncontrollable effect
of unpremeditated action on the very foundations of communication.
 **[When we look at the success of citizen initiatives from a
performative perspective, we look]{.underline}** precisely **[at those
moments of defiance]{.underline}** and disruption that bring the
invisible and unimaginable into view.  **[Although citizens were
minimally successful]{.underline}** in influencing or controlling the
outcome of the policy debate and experienced a considerable lack of
autonomy in their coercion into the technical debate, **[the
goal-oriented debate within the energy commissions could be seen as a
defiant moment of performative politics]{.underline}**.  The existence
of a goal-oriented **[debate within a]{.underline}** **[technically
dominated arena defied the normalizing separation between expert
policymakers and consuming citizens.  Citizens momentarily recreated
themselves as policymakers]{.underline}** in a system that defined
citizens out of the policy process, thereby **[refusing their
construction as passive clients.]{.underline}**

### 2AC -- Ext -- Debate is Good - Skills

#### Policy debates about hypothetical government action are good. Builds skills and fosters learning that can't be found elsewhere

**Bauschard & Champ, 11 **\[Stefan and Cheryl, writers for DebatesUS!
Brief institute, Expanding Controversy Beyond the Classroom: Supporting
Competitive Policy Debate, (2011). Debateus.org. Retrieved 8 July 2019,
from <https://debateus.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/bc2.pdf>\]

[Although some of the benefits of competitive Policy Debate, such as
developing an understanding of current and contemporary issues, critical
thinking, problem solving and public speaking can be captured in the
classroom, developing debate as an after school and competitive weekend
learning program affords opportunities to acquire significant additional
skills]{.underline}. Students have the opportunity to engage with
contemporary issues for an extended period of time, learn to work
together as part of a large group, benefits from intellectual gains that
spring from debating both sides of the resolution, are afforded
extensive opportunities for developing speaking and refutation
skills, [master in-depth and reflexive research and have the chance to
compete against students with similar skills who come from different
backgrounds]{.underline}. Since the structured academic debate outside
the classroom is competitive, students are driven to excel vis a vis
their peers. This often results in students doing extensive research
that debaters engage in is extensive, yearlong, reflexive, and diverse.
Some have estimated that the amount of research a nationally competitive
high school debater does is equivalent to the amount to research needed
to complete a master's thesis (Parcher, 1998) Since teams will debate
many opponents multiple times throughout the year, the [research and
argument development needs to account for changes in their opponent's
arguments and work toward developing new ideas]{.underline} to keep the
debates fresh. The diversity and quantity of arguments that can come
into play in any given [Policy Debate round also require debaters to
organize, synthesize and evaluate arguments]{.underline} that have been
written by coaches and other members of the team for use in their
debates. And since the [debates often involve matters of public policy,
scientific feasibility and moral issues the research is inherently
interdisciplinary]{.underline}. As the season advances, debaters must
continually adjust adapt, develop and often entirely revise their
arguments if they wish to reamin effective. All of the topics that
Policy debaters address, from limiting the use of weapons of mass
destruction, to reducing aggressive detention practices, and providing
social services to the poor, are [pulled from the headlines dealing with
the most controversial and timely issues of the day.]{.underline} In a
world of standardized curriculums and testing, students may not
otherwise have an opportunity to explore these relevant, contemporary
issues in such depth. Since many individual two-person teams make up a
squad where research and argument ideas are shared, debaters have
self-interest in working together to develop ideas that will benefit the
entire team. And since every squad is made up of many debaters who
possess diverse levels of experience and skill, [a debate squad is a
great place for peer-to-peer modeling and cooperative
learning.]{.underline}

#### It's a voting issue and outweighs their offense -- their attempt to exclude the negative obliterates the pedagogical benefits of in-round dialogue. Fairness norms are vital because they allow [both]{.underline} teams to be heard in a meaningful way. Debate as dialogue is vital to refine and develop positions, test ideas and is a prerequisite to meaningful political participation

**Galloway, 7** --professor of communication at Samford University
(Ryan, "DINNER AND CONVERSATION AT THE ARGUMENTATIVE TABLE:
RECONCEPTUALIZING DEBATE AS AN ARGUMENTATIVE DIALOGUE", *Contemporary
Argumentation and Debate,* Vol. 28 (2007), ebsco)

A second reason to reject the topic has to do with its exclusivity.
[Many teams argue that because topicality and other fairness constraints
prevent particular speech acts, debaters are denied a meaningful voice
in the debate process]{.underline}. Advocates argue that because the
negative excludes a particular affirmative performance that they have
also precluded the affirmative team. [The problem with this line of
reasoning is that it views exclusion as a unitary act of definitional
power. However, a dialogical perspective allows us to see power flowing
both ways. A large range of affirmative cases necessitates fewer
negative strategies that are relevant to the range of such cases. If the
affirmative can present any case it desires, the benefits of the
research, preparation, and in-depth thinking that go into the creation
of negative strategies are diminished, if not eviscerated
entirely]{.underline}. The affirmative case is obliged to invite a
negative response. In addition, [even when the negative strategy is not
entirely excluded, any strategy that diminishes argumentative depth and
quality diminishes the quality of in-round dialogue. An affirmative
speech act that flagrantly violates debate fairness norms and claims
that the benefits of the affirmative act supersede the need for such
guidelines has the potential of excluding a meaningful negative
response, and undermines the pedagogical benefits of the in-round
dialogue. The "germ of a response]{.underline}" (Bakhtin, 1990) [is
stunted]{.underline}. [While affirmative teams often accuse the negative
of using a juridical rule to exclude them, the affirmative also relies
upon an unstated rule to exclude the negative response]{.underline}.
This unstated but understood rule is that the negative speech act must
serve to negate the affirmative act. Thus, [affirmative teams often
exclude an entire range of negative arguments, including arguments
designed to challenge the hegemony, domination, and oppression inherent
in topical approaches to the resolution]{.underline}. Becoming more than
just a ritualistic tag-line of "fairness, education, time skew, voting
issue," **[fairness exists in the implicit right to be heard in a
meaningful way]{.underline}**. [Ground is just that---a ground to stand
on, a ground to speak from, a ground by which to meaningfully contribute
to an ongoing conversation.]{.underline} Conversely, [in a dialogical
exchange, debaters come to realize the positions other than their own
have value, and that reasonable minds can disagree on controversial
issues. This respect encourages debaters to modify and adapt their own
positions on critical issues without the threat of being labeled a
hypocrite]{.underline}. [The conceptualization of debate as a dialogue
allows challenges to take place from a wide variety of perspectives. By
offering a stable referent the affirmative must uphold, the negative can
choose to engage the affirmative on the widest possible array of
"counterwords," enhancing the pedagogical process produced by
debate]{.underline}. Additionally, debate benefits activism by exposing
the participants to a wide range of points of view on topics of public
importance. A debater starting their career in the fall of 2005 would
have debated about China, landmark Supreme Court decisions, Middle East
policy, and agricultural policy. It is unsurprising that many debaters
contend that debate is one of the most educationally valuable
experiences of their lives.

### 2AC -- Ext -- Debate is Good -- Decision-Making Skills

#### WE ARE ALL POLICY MAKERS. Debating about alternative government policies is the best way to instill a METHOD OF DECISIONMAKING that is useful in all parts of life. 

**Ross Smith, former debate coach at Wake Forest University, 7**
(4/4/2007, Ross K., "Challenge to the Community,"
<https://mail.google.com/mail/?shva=1#inbox>, )

Policy: a course of action undertaken by an agent. [We are all policy
makers every time we decide to undertake a course of action. Most
policies are non-governmental. We have an obligation to ourselves and
others to be good policy makers and advocates of good policies when
dealing with others in our spheres of influence. Policy Deliberation and
Debate: a METHOD for making and advocating better policy decisions.
**Intercollegiate debate about PUBLIC policy: a useful way of teaching
the SKILLS needed for successful use of a METHOD of making and
advocating good decisions. Public policy topics are especially useful
because the research base is public.** While we could debate about
private actions by private agents, we have no way of poviding equal
access to the kinds of information that would help make those debates
good ones.]{.underline} **[There is a side benefit that some of what we
learn about the public policy topics sometimes informs our later lives
as citizens engaged in public deliberation regarding those same
policies, but that is not the primary reason that public policy topics
are necessary]{.underline}**. [Andy Ellis is a policy maker. He makes
decisions about courses of action for himself and for/with others. But a
topic about what Andy Ellis should do is inaccessable and, frankly,
largely none of our business.]{.underline} But Andy Ellis has been well
served by having the training in one of the better methods of choosing
among and advocating whatever policies he is responsible for. That
method is policy debate. [Debate about public policy is a subset of
debate about policy, **a subset that is \"debatable\" because there is a
common research base. The fact that the subject matter is at a remove
from us personnally while still residing in the \"public sphere\" is a
feature, not a bug.**]{.underline}

unimaginable order. **[Every]{.underline}** imagination of the end in
**[apocalyptic style is the occasion for new orientation toward
the]{.underline}** open space we call the **[future]{.underline}**. This
future, however, is not for us to name, in the end, since it is beholden
to the Other. And this may mean -- and has meant, in the terms forged by
a certain tradition embracing Dante, Celan, and Stevens -- being
beholden to an apocalypse, to the revelation of the "eternity" that
surpasses us utterly and unutterably.

### 2AC -- Ext -- Deliberative Democracy

#### Deliberative democracy is inherently good for minorities and gives them a platform for them to consent to laws

**Wheatley '04** (Steven Wheatley is the senior Lecturer in Human Rights
Law and International Law, Department of Law, University of Leeds;
"Deliberative Democracy and Minorities"; published 2004; accessed
7/8/2019) // krys

The emerging '[democratic norm']{.underline} thesis in international law
has been rightly criticized for focusing too heavily on institutional
arrangements and the holding of competitive elections.6 It [appears to
conceive of a thin model of democracy, whereby the function of
government is to aggregate the preferences of individuals to find the
decision that will be acceptable to most]{.underline}. In extreme
versions[, the role of the citizen is simply to determine who will hold
power.]{.underline} [The people do not actually rule in any obvious
sense of the terms 'people' and 'rule', and democratic government
becomes the rule of the elected politician]{.underline}.7 This
aggregative model is not conducive to realizing the interests and
preferences of those minority groups with a high degree of solidarity
and shared outlook, which find themselves permanently outvoted by the
majority population.8 [Even if they are represented in decision-making
processes, there is nothing to prevent the more powerful and numerous
participants from ignoring them]{.underline}. **[No right of cultural
security can be guaranteed]{.underline}**. Yet the UN Declaration on
Minorities and the UN Commission on Human Rights have both concluded
that the issue of minorities can only be resolved 'within a democratic
framework'.9 **[A more inclusive model must then be conceived, one in
which decisions are based not only on the counting of votes, but also on
the sharing of reasons]{.underline}**. Democratic legitimacy depends
upon the will of the people to their being governed by those in power.10
Sovereignty lies with the people,11 who rule on a basis of political
equality.12 The core democratic principles of equality and popular
sovereignty are typically conceived to be antagonistic: the 'rights of
the individual' versus the 'will of the people'. This is not the case
under the deliberative model of democracy. The citizen is seen as both
the subject of the law and its author. The fact [that x and y determine
that some restriction should be placed in z does not make their decision
right simply because they constitute a majority in a voting process that
weighs each of their votes equally]{.underline}. Sometimes it is
necessary that a decision is made. If x, y and z are walkers who come to
a fork in the path they must go left or right. According to John Locke[,
the majority in a democracy have the right to determine policy, as it is
necessary that the body politic should 'move that way whither the
greater force carries it'. The only alternative would be the consent of
each individual, but 'such consent is next impossible ever to be
had']{.underline}.13 But if x and y determine that z should carry all
the equipment and they should carry none then z not being treated as an
equal in the relationship. Only if z agreed to the proposal would it be
acceptable: a person cannot complain that their rights have been
violated when they themselves have freely agreed to the interference in
their liberty. Thus, according to Kant, **[for a law to be legitimate it
must enjoy the 'united and consenting will of all']{.underline}**.14
Democracy, according to the deliberative model, is a system of
government that gives each citizen a genuinely equal share in the
exercise of power. Crucially, it requires that laws are introduced only
where a consensus exists following public deliberation and reasoned
argument between citizens as to what should be done.15 Seyla Benhabib
has argued that [deliberative democracy is not simply an additional
theoretical model about how democracies should be constructed, but one
that elucidates some aspects of the logic of democratic practices better
than others]{.underline}, albeit inimperfect form.16 [It is a model
which finds implicit recognition in the judgments of national
constitutional courts and international human rights bodies and one
which sits more easily with the principle of equality and with the
internal aspect of the right to self-determination, which requires that
the government of a state be representative of all the
people]{.underline},17 **[not simply a majority]{.underline}**.18
Recognizing the nature of democracy as deliberation not aggregation is
not an argument for reconstructing liberal democracy, but for a
different understanding of how it functions. For those international
organizations committed to democratic rule, the Organization of American
States,19 the European Union,20 the Organization for Security and
Co-operation in Europe,21 and the Commonwealth,22 a deliberative
understanding of democracy demands that member states do not simply
concern themselves with the question as to whether free and fair
elections have taken place, but also with issues of political equality,
representation and regard for the views and interests of minorities.23
[The requirements of the deliberative model]{.underline} [of democracy
are]{.underline} outlined by Julia Black: [imperfect form. It is a model
of democracy that potentially applies to all associations of free and
equal individuals]{.underline}. This would include a group of housemates
who must agree responsibilities for a variety of domestic tasks. There
will be no obvious answer as to who should be responsible for what[. An
open]{.underline}, reasoned,25 [discussion amongst equal and uncoerced
participants]{.underline}, the deliberative model argues, [will produce
a consensus as to what is to be done that is rational, fair and
legitimate]{.underline}. The same point may be made about the
heterogeneous or plural state. There are no universal values that we can
look towards to tell us what policies should be introduced. No single
normative principle of multiculturalism that a Court might apply to tell
us how to respond to claims for cultural rights from different groups in
different contexts.26 This was made clear in Société des Acadiens v.
Association of Parents, where the Canadian Supreme Court concluded that
the language rights expressed in the Charter of Rights and Freedoms were
matters of 'political compromise', and that judicial bodies 'should
pause before they decide to act as instruments of change with respect to
\[such\] rights'.27 **[Rational, fair and legitimate policies concerning
minorities can only emerge from a process of democratic
deliberation]{.underline}**.

#### Public intentions, especially those of minorities, are clarified through deliberative democracy

**Wheatley '04** (Steven Wheatley is the senior Lecturer in Human Rights
Law and International Law, Department of Law, University of Leeds;
"Deliberative Democracy and Minorities"; published 2004; accessed
7/8/2019) // krys

[The first requirement of deliberative democracy is an open political
agenda to which all may contribute]{.underline}. Democracy is a system
of government in which equal citizens determine the answer to the basic
political question: 'What ought we to do?'28 It is a system of ongoing
deliberation.29 As noted by the Canadian Supreme Court in Re Secession
of Quebec: [The original]{.underline} Athenian [conception of democracy
depended upon direct participation by citizens who engaged in 'proper
discussion']{.underline}. Decisions and laws rested on the force of
better argument.31 The United Nations' Commission on Human Rights has
argued that democratic government requires the widest participation in
the democratic dialogue by all sectors and actors of society in order to
come to agreements on appropriate solutions to social, economic and
cultural problems.32 [Deliberation is everywhere in the modern
democratic state, it takes place at meetings of pressure groups,
political parties, in universities, in the media, and innumerable places
where individuals engage in communicative debate on political
questions]{.underline}.33 [Through public deliberation]{.underline}, the
German Federal Constitutional Court has concluded, [political goals
become clarified, and a public opinion emerges which forms the
beginnings of political intentions]{.underline}.34 [There]{.underline}
must be, within this public sphere, [a tolerance for a wide diversity of
political opinions and points of view]{.underline}. In a number of cases
involving Turkey, the European Court of Human Rights has considered [the
extent of tolerance for political deliberation required of the
democratic state:]{.underline} Political debate may only be limited
where it does harm to democracy itself.36 Thus a political party may
campaign for a change in the law on two conditions: (1) the means used
to that end must be legal and democratic; and (2) the change proposed
must itself be compatible with fundamental democratic principles.37
Beyond this, [any and all political programmes may be proposed and
debated]{.underline}, '[even those that call into question the way a
state is currently organised]{.underline}'.38 [Minority groups may
participate in political deliberation through formally constituted
political parties and organizations or as part of the general
opinion]{.underline}- and will-formation in the public sphere. **[This
is a right protected by the international human rights instruments, and
includes the freedom to establish political parties specifically
dedicated to the advancement of minority interests and
preferences]{.underline}**.39 The proposals of the group may be radical
in nature, including autonomy40 and even secession.41 [What emerges from
this deliberative communication are the constitutional norms and legal
rules that will dictate the political arrangement. They will differ from
state to state, reflecting the outcomes of those societies' ongoing
deliberations]{.underline} as to the best form of government suited to
their particular circumstances in the light of current and past
experiences.

## 2AC - AT: General

### 2AC -- AT: Body Politics -- Top Level

#### You should evaluate our arguments based on credibility and evidence -- reversion to personalized bases of knowledge eradicates the possibility of common knowledge and educational development.

**Hammersley, 93** -- Prof. Education and Social Research @ Centre for
Childhood, Development and Learning @ Open U \[Martyn, British Journal
of Sociology, "Research and \'anti-racism\': the case of Peter Foster
and his critics," 44.3, 11-93, JSTOR\]

I suggest that [the assessment of substantive and methodological claims
should be based on judgments about the plausibility and credibility of
evidence with attempts to resolve disagreements]{.underline} such as
that between Foster and his critics, being pursued through a search for
common ground and an attempt to argue back from that to some conclusion
that all will accept. By \'plausibility\' here I mean what I referred to
earlier as consistency with existing knowledge whose validity is taken
to be beyond reasonable doubt. By \'credibility I mean (Martyn
Hammersley) the likelihood that the process that produced the claim is
free of serious error. Here I am assuming that factual claims vary in
their credibility both according to their own content and according to
the circumstances in which they were produced. [Where a claim is neither
sufficiently plausible nor credible to be accepted at face value,
evidence for it must be examined in terms of its plausibility and
credibility, and so on until a judgment can be made]{.underline} or
until judgment must be suspended for want of the necessary evidence.
[Where there is initial disagreement, ideally this process will result
in the acceptance by all of one or other of the two original positions,
or]{.underline} (more likely) [the construction of a third
position]{.underline}( for example through clarification of the concept
of racism); though unlike with foundationalism [there is no guarantee
offered that disagreement will be resolved]{.underline}. It seems to me
that [maximizing the chances that agreement will be reached in this way,
and that the resulting consensus will capture the truth, requires a
research community operating on the basis of the following
norms:]{.underline} 1 [The overriding concern of researchers is the
truth of claims, not their political implications or practical
consequences.]{.underline} 2 [Arguments are **not judged on the basis of
the personal and/or social characteristics of the person advancing
them**, but in terms of their plausibility and credibility]{.underline}.
3 [Researchers are willing to change their views if arguments from
common ground suggest those views are false; and, equally important,
they assume]{.underline} (and behave as if) [fellow researchers have the
same attitude - at least until there is very strong evidence
otherwise]{.underline}. 4 [Where agreement does not result, all parties
must recognize that there remains some reasonable doubt about the
validity of their own positions, so that whenever the latter are
presented they require supporting argument, or reference to where such
argument can be found]{.underline}. 5 [The research community is open to
participation by anyone able and willing to operate on the basis of the
first four rules]{.underline}; though their contributions will be judged
wanting if they lack sufficient knowledge of the field and/or of
relevant methodology. In particular, there must be no restriction of
participation on the grounds of personal characteristics religious or
political attitudes. In my view, [a research community committed to the
above norms maximizes the chances of discovering error in empirical and
theoretical claims, and of discovering the truth about particular
matters. It encourages the cumulative development of a body of knowledge
whose validity is more reliable]{.underline} on average than that of lay
views about the same issues. [This is not to say that in any particular
instance current research-based knowledge will be correct and
commonsense wrong; simply that it will usually be closer to the
truth]{.underline}. Furthermore, [it should be noted that this advantage
is bought at considerable cost in terms of the time taken to complete
inquiries in this way, and]{.underline} (correspondingly)[the limited
size of the body of research-based knowledge that can be
produced.]{.underline}

#### Personal Debates deter participation for fear of personal attacks, turning the FW

**Hansen 18** - Morten T. Hansen is a professor at the University of
California, Berkeley, and a faculty member at Apple University, Apple.
He is the author of Great at Work and Collaboration and co-author
of Great by Choice. He was named one of the top management thinkers in
the world ; 1-10-2018, \"The Problem with Most Meetings Is That There's
Not Enough Debate,\" Harvard Business Review,
<https://hbr.org/2018/01/how-to-have-a-good-debate-in-a-meeting> ;
7-8-2019

The modern workplace is awash in meetings, many of which are terrible.
As a result[, people mostly hate going to meetings. The problem
is]{.underline} this: [The whole point of meetings is to have
discussions that you can't have any other way. And yet most meetings are
devoid of real debate. To improve the meetings you run, and save the
meetings you're invited to, focus on making the discussion more robust.
When teams have a good fight during meetings, team members debate the
issues, consider alternatives, challenge one another, listen to minority
views, and scrutinize assumptions. Every participant can speak up
without fear of retribution. However, many people shy away from such
conflict, **conflating disagreement and debate with personal
attack**s]{.underline}. In reality, this sort of friction produces the
best decisions. In my recent study of 5,000 managers and employees,
published in my recent
[book](https://www.amazon.com/Great-Work-Performers-Better-Achieve/dp/1476765626/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1515454088&sr=8-1&keywords=great+at+work),
I found that the best performers are really good at generating rigorous
discussions in team meetings. (The sample includes senior and junior
managers and individual contributors from a range of industries in
corporate America; my aim was to statistically identify work habits that
correlate with higher performance.) So how do you lead a good fight in
meetings? Here are six practical tips: [Start by asking a question, not
uttering your opinion]{.underline}. In one meeting I was invited to as
an adviser, the boss started out by saying, "I think we should do X; I
would like your opinion." Then he went around the table, and everyone in
the room raised their hand in support, with zero objections. If you want
a real discussion, start with a question. Why? [First, it frames the
problem to be debated. If the problem is too general, the discussion
will go all over the place; if it's too narrow, that will limit the
options. So spend time thinking about the best question. And make sure
it isn't leading, meaning it doesn't bias the answers. Second, it
signals that you want real debate, not just a charade of one. Third, it
invites people with different ideas to speak up.]{.underline} Help quiet
people speak up (and don't let the talkers dominate). Even with good
questions, many people refrain from speaking up. Some are intimidated,
particularly new hires and junior people. Others fear retribution. Some
won't speak their true opinions for political reasons. And introverted
people dislike the discomfort of a rough-and-tumble discussion with loud
voices. Yet many of these people have important contributions to make.
To draw them in, try to "warm call" them ahead of the meeting, as one
top performer in my study did: "Sometimes I'll talk to folks in advance
of a meeting, saying, 'Hey, we're going to have this meeting. I know you
have a particular viewpoint, and I think [it's very important that it
gets heard]{.underline}, so I'd like to make sure you share it with the
group.'" Then lend your support ("Thank you for that important input").
It's better to try to get people to speak up in a group meeting than to
revert to one-on-one discussions. When you get people to speak in
meetings, you benefit from the group's collective wisdom, so people can
build on one another's comments and ideas. [Make it safe for people to
take risks --- don't let the sharks rule. Create an atmosphere of
psychological safety, as Harvard professor Amy Edmondson [calls
it](https://www.hbs.edu/faculty/Pages/item.aspx?num=23399), a "climate
in which people feel free to express work-relevant thoughts and
feelings.]{.underline}" In my study, about one-fifth of participants
(19%) were adept at creating such climates. As the data showed, those
who scored highly performed better (the correlation was 0.63; perfect
correlation would be 1.0, and random chance would be 0). A study of
[team effectiveness at
Google](https://rework.withgoogle.com/blog/five-keys-to-a-successful-google-team/)
showed the same. To create such a climate, lead by example ("Let me just
throw out a risky idea..."); support those who try ("I really appreciate
you suggesting..."); and sanction those who ridicule others ("I don't
want that kind of language here..."). Take the contrarian view. When I
was teaching [the American Express turnaround
case](https://cb.hbsp.harvard.edu/cbmp/product/396212-PDF-ENG) at HBS,
Harvey Golub, then the company's CEO, came to class. He explained that
he would often take the contrarian view: If the meeting was about
raising the price for a service, he would show up and ask whether they
should lower the price. It forced people to have really solid arguments
for their views. A top performer in my study used a similar tactic to
provoke a reaction: "I sometimes throw out a ridiculous answer; I find
people will speak up and say 'That doesn't make any sense whatsoever.'"
You can also ask a colleague to play devil's advocate, where you ask
them, for the sake of argument, to take the opposing view. But make sure
to get the opposing view on the table. Dissect the three most
fundamental assumptions. In the infamous [Bay of Pigs
Invasion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bay_of_Pigs_Invasion), where
President John F. Kennedy's team launched a botched invasion of Cuba,
his team failed to dissect a crucial assumption --- that the invasion by
some 1,400 Cuban exiles would lead to a popular uprising against the
Castro regime. President Kennedy might well have called off the flawed
plan had he known how shaky that assumption was. To avoid such
calamities, go after assumptions like a prosecutor goes after a
criminal: Do a deep dive yourself, get other experts to dive deep, and
get the team to be extremely thorough. One of the managers in our study
kept asking the team one tough question: "What are the key assumptions,
and what data will make them flawed?" Cultivate transparent advocates
(and get rid of the hard sellers). When you buy a used vehicle on a car
lot in the United States, the salesperson will tell you everything
that's good about the car and nothing that's bad. That's the hard sell
[--- highlighting the positives and downplaying the negatives. You want
people to propose ideas and be passionate about them, but you also want
them to be totally honest about the potential negatives. The problem is
that there's a human tendency to shift from being a transparent advocate
(showing the plan, warts and all) to becoming a used car salesperson:
**People are led astray by [confirmation
bias](https://hbr.org/2017/03/root-out-bias-from-your-decision-making-process)**]{.underline},
where they pay attention to data that confirms their idea, and they
[escalate
commitments](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Escalation_of_commitment) by
continuing to advocate for their plans even in the face of negative
information. You can combat this tendency by forcing people to show the
negative: "When you present in the meeting tomorrow, I want to see a
slide with the five biggest risks, and we will spend lots of time
discussing them, so be prepared." Or you can ask for a pre-mortem:
"Assuming your idea will fail, what would be the key reasons for the
failure?" The purpose of a meeting is to have a debate that will result
in a great decision. How you as a manager or participant behave in those
meetings to improve debate matters a great deal. **[Don't hate meetings;
make them better]{.underline}**.

**[Non-disabled responses to visible impairment embody either social

construction of a disabled identity. Impairment is read by and inﬂuences
the social structure of ableism. This paper attempts to understand
how **[ableist discourses about impaired bodies have impacted on and
been resisted by disabled people and how embodiment is related to
identity]{.underline}**. In pursuit of these aims, a qualitative study
was conducted with seven people who have visible physical impairments.
The results indicate that **disabled embodiment is produced and
experienced within an ableist context that mobilizes the charitable gaze
and the medical model to signify impaired bodies**[ at the expense of
the recognition of disabled identity]{.underline}. In order to
deconstruct ableism and to recognize and respect the value of the
disabled identity, a politics of recognition is required

#### Embodiment assumes an abled body subject. The theory reaches it limitations with disability because there is not a universal body or mind.

**Monceri 2014 **(Dr. Flavia Monceri, Ph.D in Social Sciences.
Department of Humanities, Social Sciences and Education at Universita
degli Studi del Molise. 2014. Date Accessed 7/8/2019 // ONW)

But this is not the case. [**We** usually **talk about embodiment** as
it were something we can more or less understand in shared terms, **as
if** that **«physical and mental experience of existence»
were** something we perceive more or less in **the
same **way]{.underline}, for at the end of the day we are all "human
beings". This happens just [because **the notion of embodiment
presupposes a notion of the bod**y, and ultimately of human being, that
we are used to understanding as definable **in universal
terms**]{.underline}, despite all individual differences, and
particularly despite the fact that there is no possibility to make two
individual embodiments overlap, given the uniqueness of the individual
body. This is the reason why I find that the only legitimate task that
theory -- abstract by definition -- can perform in this case is that of
problematizing its own assumptions, showing just its inability to
trespass its borders to enter the realm of concreteness. Therefore[, **I
will** try to **problematize the notion of embodiment** by means of
considering the case of the so-called "disabled" bodies, using them as a
kind of trojan-horse **to show the biased presuppositions of the usual
discourse about body and embodiment**]{.underline}, which is rooted in
an implicit, but clear-cut, understanding of nature. My theoretical
position is close to those suggested by Critical Disability Studies
(Meekosha and Shuttleworth 2009; Shildrick 2012; Goodley 2013), Crip
theory (McRuer 2006), and Studies in Ableism (Campbell 2009). As it is
well-known, Disability Studies (DS) uncovered the constructed character
of what is usually defined "disability" just highlighting the fact that
the body is a social institution. As Garland-Thomson (2005: 524)
stresses, «**[Disability Studies points out that ability and disability
are not so much a matter of the capacities and limitations of bodies but
more about what we expect from a body at a particular moment and
place]{.underline}**». In the terms I am using here, this amounts to say
that each concrete body is intersubjectively evaluated on the basis of
the social, cultural and political expectations concerning the "normal"
or the "ruling body" that is however a social construction for which
those «capacities and limitations» defining the concrete and unique body
under scrutiny are not relevant at all, if they are not consistent with
those envisaged by the model. [What DS as a whole have succeeded in
showing is that the label "disability" is a social construction whose
condition of possibility lies in the existence of a clear-cut definition
of the normal body. And of course this implies also a catalogue of
normal embodiments, that is to say of the «physical and mental
experience(s) of existence» that ought to be considered as fully
human]{.underline}. However, there is a second relevant aspect that DS
are able to highlight by means of investigating the social constructed
character of "disability", as  again Garland-Thomson rightly points out:
Disability studies reminds us that all bodies are shaped by their
environments from the moment of conception. We transform constantly in
response to our surroundings and register history on our bodies. The
changes that occur when body encounters world are what we call
disability. The human body varies tremendously in its forms and
functions. Our bodies need care; we all need assistance to live. Every
life evolves into disability, making it perhaps the essential
characteristic of being human (2005: 524).  Put differently, [**bodies
cannot be conceived if not referring to embodiment**, which is bounded,
in its turn, to environment and time.]{.underline} The lived experience
of each and every human body unfolds as an unceasing and ongoing series
of practices, that is to say interactions both with the nothuman and the
human "outside", without forgetting the ones occurring at the level of
the single body itself. Therefore, the idea that «embodied social
relations exist both as the context (the prior circumstances) and as an
outcome (a consequence) of given social formations, given systems
through which we create and gain social meaning» (Cregan 2006: 3) can be
surely extended to all types of human relations with the environment,
without limiting it to the ones taking place among human beings as if
they lived in a vacuum. As a consequence, granted that a newborn body
has been evaluated as perfectly corresponding to the ruling one within a
society -- that is to say the one considered as "corresponding to
nature" and therefore "normal" -- this is not sufficient to state that
this condition will be maintained during the entire life-course just
because of embodiment, that is to say just because life unfolds as a
number of practices that are very heavily dependent on environmental
conditions and the passage of time

gender domination.]{.underline}** Lastly, finding that the cult of true
womanhood ideology denied them a sexual outlet for their contempt of all
women, **[white men recharacterized slave women as Jezebels or
\"sexually aggressive women,\" thereby incarnating slave women as sexual

\"Jezebel\" to an African American woman conflates notions of
motherhood, 212 reproduction, and women as sexual objects, and forces an
African American woman to recall her prior status as a sexually
exploited breeder. Including African American women\'s experiences in
the street harassment discourse enlightens women to their multiple
consciousness and provides all women with a tool that enables them to
cope with the social and psychologically oppressive ef- fects of street
harassment. **[Angela Harris states that \"\[t\]his sense of a

expressed this sense in ways that are striking, poignant, and
potentially useful to feminist theory]{.underline}**. 213 By embracing
the multiplicitous self, African American wo- men, as the descendants of
slaves, have learned how to handle the multiple forms of oppression,
including gender and racial op- pression. Recognizing a multiple

untrustworthy. This chaotic mo- ment can seem like madness, to which one
responds with a desperate struggle to understand and explain. When,
then, a woman turns into the Subject-as-Object, as in street hassling,
she can feel as though she were losing her mind. As if to pre- vent her
from going crazy, thoughts and feelings rush in, mate- rializing into a
ghostly chorus, each voice shrieking a contradictory explanation for
what just happened or a conflict- ing instruction about what to do about
it.216 African American women have historically and consistently existed

### 2AC -- AT: Black Framework - SSD

#### SSD doesn't solve the impacts of framework - the process of the topic decision itself is rooted in traditional pedagogy 

**Dillard-Knox 2014** (Tiffany Yvonne, \"Against the grain : the
challenges of black discourse within intercollegiate policy debate.\"
(2014). Electronic Theses and Dissertations. Paper 2161.)

**[The biggest defense for the set prescriptive rubric for debating the
topic is]{.underline}** the theory of **[switch-side debate
(SSD).]{.underline}** According to Casey Harrigan (2008) that rubric
―requires students to argue both for and against a given topic during
the course of a season. As part of this process, it has been generally
accepted that student debaters are allowed, if not encouraged, to ‗step
outside of the box' and gain additional insight into controversial
issues during contest rounds by arguing on the behalf of positions that
they 68 do not personally hold (p. 37).‖ Aside from the fact that **[SSD
does not account for difference in discoursal styles,]{.underline}**
**[there are a couple of other reasons that SSD does not account for
difference. The premise behind the benefits of SSD is that this format
encourages debaters to argue on behalf of positions that they do not
personally hold; allowing for pragmatic, pedagogical, and social
benefits. In theory, SSD is productive and beneficial.]{.underline}**
However, **[the way that the topic is constructed limits the pedagogical
and social possibilities of SSD.]{.underline}** **[Understanding the
process of topic selection is a pre-requisite for examining the
implications of topic construction]{.underline}** on the benefits of
SSD. **[The topic selection process occurs in several
stages.]{.underline}** The first stage is an open call for papers, where
any member of the community can submit a controversy paper. According to
the CEDA National website, [the goal of this stage of the process is to
develop papers that outline the \'problem areas\' involved with a public
policy controversy and provide some guidance as to how such a topic
might develop.]{.underline} A controversy paper is then selected by a
mail ballot of all CEDA member schools. During the second stage the
selected controversy is researched with an interest in developing the
possible specific propositions (or resolutions) for the coming season in
the form of wording papers. The committee and community will both be
invited to prepare such wording papers. Finally **[there is a topic
meeting]{.underline}**, open to the membership, to finalize the slate of
specific propositions **[to be voted on by all of the CEDA member
schools.]{.underline}** On face, this is a neutral process that allows
for all of the CEDA membership to have an ―equal‖ voice in the process
of topic selection. Unfortunately, **[the break down occurs at the level
of the voting, much like in the larger ―democratic‖ society. Voting 69
becomes a numbers game whereas, the majority has voting
power]{.underline}**. While this is true of any democratic voting
process, **[the ability to maintain a majority has historically
advantaged traditional debaters and coaches. Thus the language of the
topic has been constructed in ways that reinforce the pedagogical and
social values of traditional debate.]{.underline}** At the heart of the
arguments in favor of or against SSD lies the topic.

### 2AC -- AT: Black Framework - Political efficacy

#### Dialogue with the government is actually bending to its will

**Mead** 20**15** -- Lawrence M. Mead is a professor in the department
of politics at New York University, where he is currently professor of
politics and public policy; 5-17-2015; \"Only connect: Why government
often ignores research,\" SpringerLink,
<https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11077-015-9216-y>; Date
Accessed: 7-6-2019

[Why has academic policy research played little role in social policy
developments since 1980? One obvious reason is politics. Most academic
poverty experts are politically left of center. From that position, the
transfer model of programming, where government does more for the poor,
comes naturally]{.underline}. After national politics turned rightward
after 1980, that approach became less politic. There was now more
emphasis on limiting dependency on government and, especially, on
raising work effort among the poor[. One reason was rising budgetary
pressures due to the rising costs of larger entitlement
programs---Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid---which have always
cost much more than smaller welfare and service programs]{.underline}.
There simply was less money to spend on new antipoverty initiatives than
formerly. There were also political limits to the right. [Some
conservative experts sought simply to cut back welfare, but Congress
chose chiefly to condition aid on work. Very few researchers supported
the strategy of work requirements that in fact came to
dominate.]{.underline} The larger problem is that most policy research
gives little attention to politics. Most poverty experts concentrate on
measuring and analyzing poverty and other social problems, and on how
they might be assuaged. While they advise government to act, they say
little about government or politics themselves. Due to the Model 1
image, government is assumed willing and able to "do the right thing"
once it is shown what that requires. But in reality, policy choice
always faces political constraints. Public executives must struggle to
reconcile what they want to do with what legislators will approve and
what administrators can execute. Often, the goals of enacted programs
are simply unclear. For administrators, grasping these political limits
is the most crucial learning they do. They get little help from most
policy research. Of course, some policy experts do focus on politics[.
Typically, political scientists study what government actually does and
the politics of those issues. But these scholars, for their part,
typically say little about the merits of policy. Thus, they too are
little help to policymakers]{.underline} (Palumbo
[1992](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11077-015-9216-y#CR48);
Rogers
[1989](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11077-015-9216-y#CR50)).
That stance reflects longstanding inhibitions in political science
against taking positions on policy issues (Nelson
[1977](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11077-015-9216-y#CR46)).
Thus, the irony: economists and sociologists tell government what to do
but otherwise ignore it, while most political scientists do address
government but will not tell it what to do. [**To gain government's ear,
policy scholars must link policy argument with political analysis**.
They must show how to address a policy problem "on the merits," but also
discuss political and institutional limitations. To make desired policy
and the political process consistent may require changes in one or the
other]{.underline}. Only by wresting with those trade-offs do
researchers sit where policymakers do. Only then can they help them
(Mead
[2013](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11077-015-9216-y#CR39)).
The implication is not necessarily that politics has a veto over good
policy ideas. Congress often does defer to interests that oppose change,
but it will also defy them if a broader interest that requires reforms
becomes salient to the public (Arnold
[1990](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11077-015-9216-y#CR4)).
One notable example was the deregulation movement of the 1970s and
1980s. Congress dismantled rules controlling prices in airlines, energy
and other economic sectors despite opposition from both management and
unions, because doing so would lower costs for consumers (Derthick and
Quirk
[1985](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11077-015-9216-y#CR9)).
Another case was tax reform in 1986, when many preferences for business
were cut to permit lower overall tax rates (Birnbaum and Murray
[1988](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11077-015-9216-y#CR7)).

of the counterplan was the fact that since** [Texas' evidence suggested
that the only thing necessary to solve the advantage was that a "hole be
poked in the panoptic screen," an academic study would constitute a
sufficient poke. The judges unanimously disagreed. This year, a Wake
Forest team advocated a counterplan which promised that they would
personally contact human rights NGOs and plead for them to better value
and respect Palestinian people and culture. The Wake Forest debaters,
Sean Nowak and Armen Nozarabhian, secured a negative ballot in a round
against Texas with this counterplan]{.underline}**, [but have apparently
not yet implemented its mandates.]{.underline} These examples of
debaters themselves assuming the role of agents of change push the
envelope of legitimate fiat by raising the question: does the power (or
privilege) of fiat extend to one's own self? Or to put the question
differently**[, is fiat reflexive]{.underline}**? Approaching the
question from the received perspective, [the answer clearly must
be]{.underline}** [no: fiat only affords the option to defend
governmental, not private action]{.underline}**. In this piece, I
question the normative worth of this received view of fiat and propose
that there are good reasons for permitting the opportunity for debaters
to present their own actions as voting alternatives in contest rounds.
My argument will unfold in the course of a brief three part discussion.
In part one, I highlight the structural differences between received and
reflexive views of fiat and consider how these differences shape the
political trajectory the debate community as a progressive agent of
social change. In part two, I sketch the basic features of reflexive
fiat and illustrate its emancipatory potential as a social movement
mobilization tool. In part three, I anticipate objections to the theory
of reflexive fiat and offer constructive reactions.**
