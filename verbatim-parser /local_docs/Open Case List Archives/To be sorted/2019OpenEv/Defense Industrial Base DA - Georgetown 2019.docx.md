[The Trump administration has set its sights on expanding America's
substantial arms sales around the globe]{.underline}. [The United States
is already the world's leading arms exporter]{.underline}, accounting
for 34 percent of total arms exports in the world between 2013--2017
according to a recent release by the authoritative Stockholm
International Peace Research Institute (SIPRI). [Arms sales constituted
6.2 percent of the value of all U.S. exports]{.underline} in the period
from 2007 to 2014. During the Obama presidency, the administration
approved more than \$278 billion in foreign-arms sales, more than any
administration since World War II. In the first year of President
Trump's administration, the United States signed arms-export deals in
excess of \$41 billion and notified Congress of potential deals that
total more than \$82 billion, though some of these were initiated under
the previous administration. In the effort to increase sales, President
Trump is actively urging foreign leaders he meets to buy U.S.-made
military systems and equipment. He also signed on April 19 a National
Security Presidential Memorandum approving a new Conventional Arms
Transfer (CAT) policy designed to ease export restrictions. The recent
announcement by the Defense Security Cooperation Agency of the reduction
of the surcharge foreign nations pay when buying American weapon systems
from 3.5 to 3.2 percent, is another step designed to increase the
competitiveness of "buying American" by this administration. [Bolstering
arms sales is seen by the administration not only as a tool to enhance
traditional national security and foreign-policy goals but as serving
its "America First" policy by supporting the manufacturing and defense
industrial base and driving new innovation and creating American
jobs.]{.underline}

[America\'s military strength remains vital to preserving the nation\'s
interests and sustaining international stability]{.underline}. While
much of this strength is derived from the professionalism and skills of
America\'s armed forces, [the technologically superior military
platforms that the U.S. has developed and fielded]{.underline} since
World War II [are]{.underline} also **[vital to ensuring a superior
fighting force.]{.underline}** In both peace and war, [America\'s
defense manufacturing industrial base has allowed the United States to
design and build an advanced array of weapons systems and platforms to
meet **the full spectrum of potential missions**]{.underline} [the
military may be called upon to fulfill]{.underline}. [Securing
America\'s military dominance for the decades ahead will require: **An
industrial base that can retain a highly skilled workforce with critical
skill sets and** Sustained investment in platforms]{.underline} that
offer future commanders and civilian leaders a vital set of core
military capabilities and equipment to respond to any threat.
[America\'s military may]{.underline} also [benefit from a **more open
international defense market**]{.underline}. A 2005 Heritage Foundation
study examined the effect of globalization on the defense market and
concluded that access to [**foreign suppliers** would play a significant
and positive role in helping the Pentagon to access **a broader
industrial base** and meet immediate **defense needs more
efficiently**]{.underline}.\[1\] **[These findings still hold true
today]{.underline}**. While remaining focused on the critical
technologies, industries, and skills that are not readily available in
the global market, [Congress should]{.underline} also support
[increase]{.underline}d [foreign military sales to help complement
America\'s domestic defense industrial base]{.underline}.

one form or another, [[the American way of]{.mark} war and of the

Valley Forge, we enjoyed immense and forgiving strategic depth, the
3,000-mile barrier of the Atlantic, and the great forests that would
later give birth to the Navy. In the Civil War, the North's burgeoning
industrial and demographic powers meshed with the infancy of America's
technological ascendance to presage superiority in mass industrial ---
and then scientific --- 20th-century warfare. The way we fight is that
we do not stint. Subtract the monumental preparations, **[[cripple the
defense industrial base, and we will fail to deter wars that we will

## Uniqueness 

### Readiness Uniqueness 

#### Readiness high now

**Petraeus and O'Hanlon, 16.** David Petraeus is a retired United States
Army general and public official. He served as Director of the Central
Intelligence Agency from September 6, 2011, until his resignation on
November 9, 2012. Michael O'Hanlon is a senior fellow at The Brookings
Institution, specializing in defense and foreign policy issues. "The
Myth of a U.S. Military 'Readiness' Crisis." (8/9/16).
https://www.wsj.com/articles/the-myth-of-a-u-s-military-readiness-crisis-1470783221(//JTR)

[U.S. military readiness is again a hot issue in the presidential
election, but unfortunately the current debate glosses over some of the
most important facts. While Congress\'s sequestration-mandated cuts to
military spending have hurt preparedness, **America\'s fighting forces
remain ready for battle**.]{.underline} [They have extensive combat
experience across multiple theaters since 9/11, a tremendous high-tech
defense industry supplying advanced weaponry, and support from an
extraordinary intelligence community.]{.underline}

For those concerned that America\'s military is in decline or somehow
not up to the next challenge, we offer a few reassuring facts:

\-- [The current national defense budget of over \$600 billion a year
far exceeds the Cold War average of about \$525 billion (in
inflation-adjusted 2016 dollars) and the \$400 billion spent in
2001]{.underline}, according to official Pentagon and Office of
Management and Budget data. The national defense budget, which doesn\'t
include Veterans Affairs or the Department of Homeland Security,
constitutes 35% of global military spending and is more than that of the
next eight countries \-- including China and Russia \-- combined.
Spending has been reduced from the levels of the late Bush and early
Obama years, but that isn\'t unreasonable in light of scaled-down combat
operations abroad and fiscal pressures at home.

\-- Assuming no return to sequestration, as occurred in 2013, [Pentagon
budgets to buy equipment now exceed \$100 billion a year, a healthy and
sustainable level. The so-called \"procurement holiday\" of the 1990s
and early 2000s is over.]{.underline}

\-- While some categories of aircraft and other key weapons are aging
and will need replacement or major refurbishment soon, [most equipment
remains in fairly good shape. According to our sources in the military,
Army equipment has, on average, mission-capable rates today exceeding
90% \-- a **historically high level**]{.underline}. Marine Corps
aviation is an exception and urgently needs to be addressed.

\-- Training for full-spectrum operations is resuming after over a
decade of appropriate focus on counterinsurgency. By 2017 the Army plans
to rotate nearly 20 brigades \-- about a third of its force \-- through
national training centers each year. The Marine Corps plans to put 12
infantry battalions \-- about half its force \-- through large training
exercises. The Air Force is funding its training and readiness programs
at 80%-98% of what it considers fully resourced levels. This situation
isn\'t perfect, but it has improved \-- and while the military is still
engaged in combat operations across the world.

\-- [The men and women of today\'s all-volunteer military continue to be
**outstanding and committ**ed to protecting America. Typical scores of
new recruits on the armed forces qualification test are now
**significantly better** than in the Reagan years or the immediate
pre-9/11 period, two useful benchmarks]{.underline}. The average time in
service, a reflection of the experience of the force, is now about 80
months in the enlisted ranks, according to Defense Department data. That
is not quite as good as in the 1990s, when the average was 85-90 months,
but is better than the 75-month norm of the 1980s.

[While there are areas of concern, **there is no crisis in military
readiness**]{.underline}. But that doesn\'t mean the U.S. is good enough
\-- especially in a world of rapidly changing technology, new threats
emerging across several regions, and a constantly evolving strategic
landscape. Here are some of the most pressing issues:

#### Readiness is historically high now, there is no crisis

**O'Hanlon, 17**. Michael O\'Hanlon is a senior fellow in foreign policy
at the Brookings Institution, where he specializes in U.S. defense
strategy, the use of military force and American national security
policy. "\'Military readiness crisis\' a risky misdiagnosis." (10/5/17).
https://thehill.com/opinion/national-security/354042-military-readiness-crisis-a-risky-misdiagnosis(//JTR)

[Current military readiness --- i.e., the ability of the U.S. military,
unit by unit, to carry out assigned tasks promptly and competently ---
can be summarized as follows: First, most major categories of equipment
are in fairly good shape, in terms of their \"mission-capable rates\"
relative to historical norms.]{.underline}

[For example, major Army vehicle readiness rates typically exceed 90
percent today]{.underline}. That said, a number of categories of
equipment across the services, like certain helicopter fleets, are not
in good shape.

[Second, funding for major training is being provided to the military at
85 to 95 percent of comprehensive rates]{.underline}. That is not
perfect, but by historical standards[, it is still rather
good.]{.underline}

[Third, the quality of our personnel is quite high, and recruiting as
well as retention statistics are strong]{.underline}. Yet, we do not
have enough people for some specialties, and we have real dearths in
areas like certain types of pilots and equipment maintenance personnel.

This review is admittedly cursory and imperfect, partly because the
Department of Defense has been classifying more readiness data than it
used to or than it should. But my research suggests that it is correct
in broad strokes.

[Today\'s overall readiness, averaged across multiple categories, is
probably something like a B+]{.underline} --- though that kind of broad
assessment can admittedly gloss over specific problems that might prove
disproportionately serious in a given mission or crisis.

### 2NC Saudi Arabia 

#### Arms sales are a key component that supports the defense industry

industries at The Washington Post. "Defense contractors stand with White
House on Saudi arms sales."

(//JTR)

Major U.S. defense manufacturers say they will stand by the Trump
administration regarding whether American-made weapons systems should be
sold to the Saudi government, despite a global political backlash over
the killing of a Saudi journalist and an ongoing humanitarian crisis at
the hands of a Saudi-led military campaign in Yemen.

U.S. defense contractors have shied away from publicly discussing the
disappearance and killing of Jamal Khashoggi, a Washington Post
contributing columnist who sharply criticized the Saudi state for
limiting free expression. But when pressed by investment analysts this
week on how the political situation might affect their business,
executives from Massachusetts-based Raytheon and Bethesda-based Lockheed
Martin said they would keep selling advanced weaponry to Saudi Arabia as
long as the U.S.-Saudi military partnership continues.

"We continue to be aligned with the administration's policies, and we
intend to honor our commitments," Toby O'Brien, Raytheon's chief
financial officer, told investors Thursday.

Both companies emphasized that their international arms deals are
ultimately coordinated by the government in concert with foreign allies.
For U.S. defense contractors to sell weapons systems abroad, they have
to first go through a complicated government process that involves the
Defense Department, State Department and Congress, which vet each deal's
geopolitical, security and human rights implications.

"Most of these agreements that we have are government-to-government
purchases, so anything that we do has to follow strictly the regulations
of the U.S. government," Lockheed Martin chief executive Marillyn Hewson
said Tuesday. "Beyond that, we'll just work with the U.S. government as
they're continuing their relationship with Saudi."

The Aerospace Industries Association, a trade group, said it will
continue to "support U.S. national security and foreign policy goals,
and our companies will continue to look to the government for direction
on how best to support those goals."

[Saudi Arabia is a favored business partner of U.S. defense contractors
because it is among the world's largest military spenders. The kingdom
spends billions of dollars every year on American-made weapons systems,
and it has few of the bureaucratic checks and balances that delay big
military purchases in the United States.]{.underline}

[Raytheon executives said Thursday that about 5 percent of the company's
annual sales come from the kingdom]{.underline}, though they emphasized
it is not dependent on any one foreign buyer. They expect those sales to
remain roughly flat into next year, as the company receives at least two
large contracts for "offensive and defensive weapons systems" and
military training.

[Lockheed executives said Tuesday that they have "about less than \$500
million" in Saudi sales planned for 2019 and about \$900 million into
2020. The company expects to receive an additional \$450 million
contract for combat ships and is awaiting an additional deal on its
Terminal High Altitude Area Defense (THAAD) missile defense system,
which is expected to be operational in Saudi Arabia by
2023.]{.underline}

[Lockheed has made **selling to foreign governments a key target for
growth**. Earlier this year, Hewson said her company's international
sales had jumped from 17 percent of total sales in 2013 to 30 percent in
2017.]{.underline}

[**Saudi Arabia played a key role in that growth**, she said, and made
it clear that the relationship would continue.]{.underline}

["Saudia Arabia has expressed its intent to procure integrated air and
missile defense systems, combat ships, helicopters, surveillance systems
and tactical aircraft in coming years," she said.]{.underline}

#### Saudi arms sales are key to [defense industrial base]{.underline} \-\-- Saudi Arabia is a critical export market 

**Ghoshal** 10/15/**15** \-\-- Debalina, Research Associate, Delhi
Policy Group, "The softening of Saudi Arabia towards the Iranian nuclear
deal would yield positive results in US-Saudi relations"
http://www.turkishweekly.net/2015/10/15/op-ed/the-softening-of-saudi-arabia-towards-the-iranian-nuclear-deal-would-yield-positive-results-in-us-saudi-relations/

Of course, while the Saudi Arabians might have mellowed down when it
comes to the nuclear deal, this does not necessarily mean that they are
attempting to improve relations with Iran. Saudi Arabia's Foreign
Minister Adel al Jubeir was quoted as saying that because the nuclear
deal assures that Iran would not have easy access to nuclear weapons, it
would enable Saudi Arabia to focus more intensely on Iran's "nefarious"
activities in the region. Further, he believes that the deal will
"contribute to security and stability"\[3\] in the region. This
[softening of the Saudis towards the]{.underline} nuclear [deal can only
be a step forward on the path to renewing relations between Riyadh and
Washington]{.underline}. This relation has been soured not only by the
Iranian nuclear deal, but also by the U.S.'s foreign policy on matters
pertaining to the Syrian crisis and the fledgling democratic
trajectories ofTunisia and Egypt as well as the inability of the U.S. to
check Iranian influence in Iraq. **[[Renewed Saudi-U.S. relations would
bear positive results]{.underline}]{.mark}**. Just like Iran, [Saudi
Arabia]{.underline} has [joined the]{.underline}
**[U]{.underline}**nited **[S]{.underline}**tates [in its fight
against]{.underline} the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant
([ISIL]{.underline}). Moreover, [[any discontent with the U.S. on the
part of the Saudis **could cost the former an important defence export
market as Saudi Arabia is one of the leading importers of U.S.
weapons**]{.underline}]{.mark}. Moreover, the Saudis also know that the
nuclear deal is going to be passed by U.S. Congress. Hence, the only
solution is to join hands with the U.S. to ensure that the verification
mechanisms outlined in the agreement are in place. [Also, for the U.S.,
[gaining the Saudi's confidence is **necessary** if it is to deploy a
regional]{.mark}]{.underline} Terminal High Altitude Air Defence
([[THAAD]{.underline}) [system in the GCC]{.underline}]{.mark} countries
[successfully. [Estranged relations]{.mark}]{.underline} with Saudi
Arabia **[[could make this effort to deploy a joint missile defence
system a difficult task.]{.underline}]{.mark}**

#### Exports to Saudi Arabia are the largest and most important for the US defense industrial base 

**Hartung** 10/19/**15** \-\-- William D., Senior Adviser to the
Security Assistance Monitor program, "U.S. Arms Transfers to the Middle
East: Promoting Stability or Fueling Conflict?"
http://www.securityassistance.org/blog/us-arms-transfers-middle-east-promoting-stability-or-fueling-conflict

Introduction: The Obama Arms Bazaar [The recent surge in U.S. arms
transfers to the Middle East is part of an **unprecedented boom in major
U.S. arms sales**]{.underline} that has been presided over by the Obama
administration. In President Obama's first six years in office, new
agreements [under the]{.underline} Pentagon's [Foreign Military
Sales]{.underline} (FMS) [program -- the largest channel for U.S.
weapons exports]{.underline} -- totaled over \$195 billion.\[1\]
Overall, the Obama administration has approved more major weapons deals
than any U.S. administration since World War II. [The majority
of]{.underline} the Obama administration's major [arms
sales]{.underline} -- **[over 56 per cent]{.underline}** -- [have gone
to the]{.underline} Middle East and [Persian Gulf, **with Saudi Arabia
topping the list with over \$49 billion in new
agreements**]{.underline}.\[2\] This is particularly troubling given the
complex array of conflicts raging throughout the region, and given the
Saudi regime's use of U.S.-supplied weaponry in its military
intervention in Yemen. [The increase in arms sales]{.underline} under
the Obama administration [is rooted in two factors]{.underline}, one
political and one economic. [The political factor is grounded
in]{.underline} President [Obama's pledge to avoid getting into any new,
large-scale "boots on the ground" conflicts like Iraq or
Afghanistan]{.underline}.\[3\] His alternative has been to rely on
tactics designed to limit U.S. casualties, from drone strikes to arming
and training allies to carry out fighting that might otherwise have been
done by U.S. troops. This aspect of the Obama policy mirrors the
approach taken by Richard Nixon in the wake of the Vietnam War, when he
armed regional surrogates like Iran under the Shah to fight on behalf of
U.S. interests in key regions.\[4\] [On the economic front, the Obama
administration has been a **major promoter of exports in general and
arms exports in particular**]{.underline}. In doing so, it has been
responding to pressure from weapons manufacturers like Boeing, Lockheed
Martin and General Dynamics who are seeking to increase export sales to
counterbalance a leveling off of Pentagon procurement spending. The
extent of the Obama administration's commitment to promoting weapons
sales was underscored at a March 2013 hearing on arms export control
policy when Tom Kelly, who was principal deputy assistant secretary of
the State Department's bureau of political-military affairs, said that
"it is an issue that has the attention of every top-level official who's
working on foreign policy throughout the government . . . in advocating
on behalf of our companies and doing everything we can to make sure
these sales go through."\[5\]\\ In addition to setting higher goals for
arms exports in general, [major weapons contractors have attempted to
use foreign sales to keep open key production lines for systems that are
reaching the end of the line in terms of Pentagon
procurement]{.underline}. For example, earlier this year it was reported
that Boeing had concluded a deal to sell 40 F-18s to Kuwait, which will
extend the life of the program for another year or more beyond its
current projected end date of early 2017.\[6\] Similarly, the General
Dynamics M-1 tank has been surviving on a combination of Congressional
add-ons and a deal for tanks and tank upgrades for Saudi Arabia.\[7\]

#### Billion dollar industry 

**Kavanaugh, vocative, 5-8-15**

(Shane Dixon, "Obama's "Ironclad" Diplomacy In Middle East Is A Cash Cow
Back Home,"
<http://www.vocativ.com/usa/nat-sec/obamas-ironclad-diplomacy-in-middle-east-is-a-cash-cow-back-home/>)

President [Obama's "ironclad commitment" to Persian Gulf
allies]{.underline} may fail to calm Arab concerns about the resolutions
to the increased instability in the Middle East, national security
experts say. But it [**will certainly be a boon to the U.S economy,
pumping billions of dollars into its defense industry.** Saudi Arabia
and other members of the Gulf Cooperation Council left Camp
David]{.underline} last week with little in the way of bold, hardline
pledges from the United States on Iran, Syria or ISIS. Instead, [they
were offered to continue buying billions of dollars in advanced
weapons,]{.underline} which the Obama administration has aggressively
sold to them, time and time again, over the last six years. Continuing
escalated arming of one side in the ongoing regional proxy war between
Saudi Arabia and Iran will also likely only heighten tensions between
those two powers.

#### Arms Sales necessary to keep workers employed and occupied

**Stone, 18**. Mike Stone is a Defense Industry Correspondent for
Reuters. (10/30/18) "Exclusive: Defense firms see only hundreds of new
U.S. jobs from Saudi mega deal."
<https://www.reuters.com/article/us-saudi-arms-jobs-exclusive/exclusive-defense-firms-see-only-hundreds-of-new-u-s-jobs-from-saudi-mega-deal-idUSKCN1N40DM>(//JTR)

Industry executives have argued that [without the Saudi package coming
through they would have fewer orders to fill]{.underline}, but robust
U.S. defense budgets, which account for the majority of their sales,
coupled with a record backlog of orders suggest little risk that workers
would face layoffs if the Saudi sales package failed to materialize.

[Certainly for each defense manufacturing job, other adjacent jobs are
supported indirectly by higher demand for defense products.]{.underline}

But Heidi Garrett-Peltier, a research fellow at the Political Economy
Research Institute, [estimated that for this type of industry the
highest multiplier would be just below 3.2. Given that, 20,000 to 40,000
sustained or new jobs could generate between about 64,000 to 128,000
jobs in related industries, Reuters calculations show, bringing the
total of sustained and new jobs to between 84,000 and
168,000.]{.underline}

In short, 500,000 jobs Trump keeps bringing up is at least three to five
times higher than what one could expect from the Saudi deal, given the
estimates from the companies themselves, plus the most generous use of
the indirect multiplier.

By its own math, [the U.S. State Department said in May 2017 that the
Saudi deal could support "tens of thousands of new jobs in the United
States."]{.underline}

Drastic reductions in resources pinch any organization, and DoD is no
different. [[Rather than making draconian cuts to force structure and
troop benefits, DoD has instead historically chosen to reduce its
procurement budget by]{.mark} prolonging the shelf-life of existing
platforms]{.underline}, stretching out new acquisition programs, [and
[purchasing fewer new units of equipment than it had originally
intended. If the defense industry is to thrive in such a challenging
environment, **it will need to look abroad for new
markets**]{.mark}]{.underline}[. [American defense contractors
are]{.underline}]{.mark} aware of the history of defense draw-downs, and
are [[examining the best ways to weather the fiscal
storm]{.underline}]{.mark}. Last November, Boeing announced major
layoffs in its defense division, citing declining defense spending.4
This comes after public concerns from several other corporations
regarding reduced spending and its implications for industry.5
[[Complicating matters is the lack of diversity in the revenue streams
of large American defense contractors]{.mark}. Four of the five largest
American companies in the defense business generate more than
three-quarters of their revenue from the defense sector, leaving them
vulnerable to declines in government spending]{.underline}.6 **[[A
healthy defense industrial base is vital to America's ability to project
power and protect interests globally]{.underline}]{.mark}**. Although
further cuts to defense budgets will almost certainly mean additional
reductions to the defense industry's workforce, infrastructure, and
operational capability, [[it is in the interest of America's economic
and national security that this pillar of domestic industrial capacity
does not wither. It will help ensure American competitiveness]{.mark} in
science and technology development [and make sure that]{.mark} the
[platforms]{.mark} necessary for waging future wars [are]{.mark}
designed, developed, and [manufactured
domestically]{.mark}]{.underline}. A robust industrial base also means
protecting jobs and infrastructure at home, which is particularly
important in today's economic climate. To protect domestic industrial
capacity and strengthen strategic relationships globally, industry and
government should work together to develop inexpensive platforms
designed and constructed with the budgetary realities and tactical
requirements of foreign governments in mind. [By developing export-ready
platforms, the U.S. defense industry will generate new incentives for
foreign governments to buy American]{.underline}.

ultimately coordinated by the government in concert with foreign allies.
For U.S. defense contractors to sell weapons systems abroad, they have
to first go through a complicated government process that involves the
Defense Department, State Department and Congress, which vet each deal's
geopolitical, security and human rights implications.

"Most of these agreements that we have are government-to-government
purchases, so anything that we do has to follow strictly the regulations
of the U.S. government," Lockheed Martin chief executive Marillyn Hewson
said Tuesday. "Beyond that, we'll just work with the U.S. government as
they're continuing their relationship with Saudi."

The Aerospace Industries Association, a trade group, said it will
continue to "support U.S. national security and foreign policy goals,
and our companies will continue to look to the government for direction
on how best to support those goals."

Saudi Arabia is a favored business partner of U.S. defense contractors
because it is among the world's largest military spenders. The kingdom
spends billions of dollars every year on American-made weapons systems,
and it has few of the bureaucratic checks and balances that delay big
military purchases in the United States.

Raytheon executives said Thursday that about 5 percent of the company's
annual sales come from the kingdom, though they emphasized it is not
dependent on any one foreign buyer. They expect those sales to remain
roughly flat into next year, as the company receives at least two large
contracts for "offensive and defensive weapons systems" and military
training.

Lockheed executives said Tuesday that they have "about less than \$500
million" in Saudi sales planned for 2019 and about \$900 million into
2020. The company expects to receive an additional \$450 million
contract for combat ships and is awaiting an additional deal on its
Terminal High Altitude Area Defense (THAAD) missile defense system,
which is expected to be operational in Saudi Arabia by 2023.

Lockheed has made selling to foreign governments a key target for
growth. Earlier this year, Hewson said her company's international sales
had jumped from 17 percent of total sales in 2013 to 30 percent in 2017.

Saudi Arabia played a key role in that growth, she said, and made it
clear that the relationship would continue.

"Saudia Arabia has expressed its intent to procure integrated air and
missile defense systems, combat ships, helicopters, surveillance systems
and tactical aircraft in coming years," she said.

Arms sales key to defense companies' bottom line

Foreign arms sales are growing in importance to the top line of big
defense firms and may get an added boost this year due to initiatives by
President Donald Trump.

Sales to allies and other friendly countries also have allowed American
defense companies to extend production lines that otherwise might be
shuttered or downsized.

Trump's personal involvement in defense sales also hasn't gone
unnoticed, whether touting \$350 billion in weapons to Saudi Arabia last
May or suggesting in November that Japan should buy more U.S.-made
equipment to shoot North Korean missiles "out of the sky."

Lockheed Martin and Raytheon, two defense companies with upcoming
earnings reports, stand to benefit from increased international sales
over the next few years, according to analysts. A lot of the recent
growth in U.S. defense sales is in missile defense systems and
Lockheed's F-35 stealth fighter jets.

"We're seeing a global upturn in defense spending," said Peter Arment, a
defense analyst at Robert W. Baird. "We're seeing Europe, NATO, the
Middle East, Asia and U.S. domestic."

For defense companies, international weapons sales can sometimes be more
lucrative too. Arment said direct arms sales from U.S. defense companies
to foreign countries "can have a higher margin" than going through
Washington's Foreign Military Sales program.

Reuters reported earlier this month that the administration plans as
part of its new "Buy American" plan to have embassy personnel "help drum
up billions of dollars more in business overseas for the U.S. weapons
industry." "This is the government's job in many ways," Roman Schweizer,
a Cowen defense analyst and former government acquisition official, told
CNBC. Regardless of the administration's new plans, Schweizer said there
are diplomats and other federal workers at embassies around the world
already actively promoting U.S. defense exports. "We have used foreign
military sales to help friends and allies around the world and also to
help U.S. defense manufacturers around the world," Schweizer said.
However, Reuters said the White House's plans will be "going beyond the
limited assistance" now provided by overseas American military attaches
and diplomats. The White House didn't respond to CNBC's request for
comment. Remy Nathan, vice president of international affairs at the
Aerospace Industries Association, said the Arlington, Virginia-based
industry trade group representing some top American defense companies
"is very much in favor of enhancing" the current arrangement.
Specifically, the administration wants to make it easier to export U.S.
defense products abroad, whether drones, aircraft or ships. It comes at
a time when the Chinese are getting more aggressive in selling weapons
overseas. The Trump administration has already relaxed rules allowing
more military sales to countries such as Saudi Arabia, which has been
accused of war crimes by some human rights groups. Also, the
administration lifted human rights conditions for arms sales to other
countries, including Bahrain. In May, when he visited Saudi Arabia on
his first foreign-nation visit, the president announced a massive,
multiyear arms deal with the kingdom that he said would add hundreds of
thousands of U.S. jobs. But some questioned whether all of the weapons
were part of a new agreement. Even so, an expanded "Buy American"
program in defense helps the administration in its efforts to boost
manufacturing jobs.

The U.S. had nearly \$42 billion in foreign military sales during fiscal
2017, up from \$33.6 billion in the previous year, according to the
Defense Security Cooperation Agency. There is an expectation that
foreign military sales could grow again this fiscal year due to
increased global tensions and efforts by U.S. allies to increase their
overall defense spending.

Major U.S. defense manufacturers say they will stand by the Trump
administration regarding whether American-made weapons systems should be
sold to the Saudi government, despite a global political backlash over
the killing of a Saudi journalist and an ongoing humanitarian crisis at
the hands of a Saudi-led military campaign in Yemen.

U.S. defense contractors have shied away from publicly discussing the
disappearance and killing of Jamal Khashoggi, a Washington Post
contributing columnist who sharply criticized the Saudi state for
limiting free expression. But when pressed by investment analysts this
week on how the political situation might affect their business,
executives from Massachusetts-based Raytheon and Bethesda-based Lockheed
Martin said they would keep selling advanced weaponry to Saudi Arabia as
long as the U.S.-Saudi military partnership continues.

"We continue to be aligned with the administration's policies, and we
intend to honor our commitments," Toby O'Brien, Raytheon's chief
financial officer, told investors Thursday.

Both companies emphasized that their international arms deals are
ultimately coordinated by the government in concert with foreign allies.

#### Procurement is key to R&D, which the plan reduces

https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0169721810020137(//JTR)

A third important channel through which defense-related spending on new
technologies can advance civilian applications is procurement. [As in
other areas of "mission-oriented" R&D, defense-related R&D investment is
often complemented by **substantial purchases of new technologies**.
Procurement may affect defense firms' R&D spending directly (see below
for discussion of the work of Lichtenberg, 1984), and defense
procurement **can affect the development of new
technologies**]{.underline}. The US military services, whose
requirements typically emphasize performance above all other
characteristics (including cost), have played a particularly important
role during the post-1945 period as a "lead purchaser," placing large
orders for early versions of new technologies. These procurement orders
enabled suppliers of products such as transistors or integrated circuits
to reduce the prices of their products and improve their reliability and
functionality.15 [Government procurement historically has allowed
innovators to benefit from learning by increasing the scale of
production for early versions of the technology.]{.underline}

### Tech Key for Readiness

#### R&D is most important today because of rising global competitiveness

**Sargent** **et. al. 18**. John F. Sargent Jr. is a Specialist in
Science and Technology Policy at Library of Congress. "The Global
Research and Development Landscape and Implications for the Department
of Defense." (11/8/18).
https://www.everycrsreport.com/reports/R45403.html#\_Toc530401442(//JTR)

[Recognizing that potential military adversaries may have access to the
same suite of commercially available technologies as DOD does, the NSS
places a premium on speed in the development, adaptation, and
acquisition of technologies, as well as in bringing them to the
warfighter in the form of new tools and weapons. According to the NSS,
\"the **United States must regain the element of surprise and field new
technologies** at the pace of modern industry]{.underline}. Government
agencies must shift from an archaic R&D process to an approach that
rewards rapid fielding and risk taking.\" 38

In testimony before the House Armed Services Committee, Secretary Mattis
stated that DOD is transitioning to a culture of performance and
affordability \"that operates at the speed of relevance,\" and that the
department is prioritizing speed of delivery, along with continuous
adaptation and frequent modular upgrades.39

In testimony before the House Armed Services Committee, Under Secretary
of Defense for Research and Engineering Mike Griffin [discussed the
implications of commercial firms leading technology development in
disciplines that will play an **increasingly important role** in U.S.
national security.]{.underline} He said this situation could lead to a
reduction in the U.S. military\'s technological advantage over potential
adversaries and the need for DOD to develop and implement new approaches
to capitalize on and leverage commercial research. Because of this he
emphasized the importance of speed in innovation and in the delivery of
military capabilities to national security:

[The incremental democratization of technology has fostered global and
easy access to cutting edge capabilities, which has in turn contributed
to the ability of our adversaries to achieve technology parity. As a
result, our military\'s advanced technical capabilities and unmatched
technological superiority is being **challenged by the investments of
competing powers**. Given the leveled playing field, speed in developing
new technologies and delivering capabilities to the warfighter is more
critical now than ever.]{.underline}

[We must be willing and able to tap into **commercial research,
recognize its military potential**, and leverage it to develop new
capabilities,]{.underline} while also accounting for the operational and
organizational constructs to employ them faster than our competitors.40

#### Gov agrees, technological advancements are key to readiness in the 21^st^ century

**DOD, 18**. The Department of Defense is the US Government agency in
charge of the military and security for the United States of America.
"Summary of the 2018 National Defense Strategy of The United States of
America."
https://dod.defense.gov/Portals/1/Documents/pubs/2018-National-Defense-Strategy-Summary.pdf(//JTR)

[The security environment is also affected by rapid technological
advancements and the changing character of war. The drive to develop new
technologies is relentless, expanding to more actors with lower barriers
of entry, and moving at accelerating speed.]{.underline} New
technologies include advanced computing, "big data" analytics,
artificial intelligence, autonomy, robotics, directed energy,
hypersonics, and biotechnology--- [the very **technologies that ensure
we will be able to fight and win the wars of the future**.]{.underline}

New commercial technology will change society and, ultimately, the
character of war. The fact that many technological developments will
come from the commercial sector means that state competitors and
non-state actors will also have access to them, a fact that risks
eroding the conventional overmatch to which our Nation has grown
accustomed. [Maintaining the Department's technological advantage will
require changes to industry culture, investment sources, and protection
across the National Security Innovation Base.]{.underline}

States are the principal actors on the global stage, but non-state
actors also threaten the security environment with increasingly
sophisticated capabilities. Terrorists, trans-national criminal
organizations, cyber hackers and other malicious non-state actors have
transformed global affairs with increased capabilities of mass
disruption. There is a positive side to this as well, as our partners in
sustaining security are also more than just nation-states: multilateral
organizations, non-governmental organizations, corporations, and
strategic influencers provide opportunities for collaboration and
partnership. Terrorism remains a persistent condition driven by ideology
and unstable political and economic structures, despite the defeat of
ISIS's physical caliphate. It is now undeniable that the homeland is no
longer a sanctuary. America is a target, whether from terrorists seeking
to attack our citizens; malicious cyber activity against personal,
commercial, or government infrastructure; or political and information
subversion. New threats to commercial and military uses of space are
emerging, while increasing digital connectivity of all aspects of life,
business, government, and military creates significant vulnerabilities.
During conflict, attacks against our critical defense, government, and
economic infrastructure must be anticipated. Rogue regimes, such as
North Korea, continue to seek out or develop weapons of mass destruction
(WMD) -- nuclear, chemical, and biological -- as well as long range
missile capabilities and, in some cases, proliferate these capabilities
to malign actors as demonstrated by Iranian ballistic missile exports.
Terrorists likewise continue to pursue WMD, while the spread of nuclear
weapon technology and advanced manufacturing technology remains a
persistent problem. Recent advances in bioengineering raise another
concern, increasing the potential, variety, and ease of access to
biological weapons. NATIONAL DEFENSE STRATEGY 4 DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE
OBJECTIVES In support of the National Security Strategy, the Department
of Defense will be prepared to defend the homeland, remain the
preeminent military power in the world, ensure the balances of power
remain in our favor, and advance an international order that is most
conducive to our security and prosperity. Long-term strategic
competitions with China and Russia are the principal priorities for the
Department, and require both increased and sustained investment, because
of the magnitude of the threats they pose to U.S. security and
prosperity today, and the potential for those threats to increase in the
future. Concurrently, the Department will sustain its efforts to deter
and counter rogue regimes such as North Korea and Iran, defeat terrorist
threats to the United States, and consolidate our gains in Iraq and
Afghanistan while moving to a more resource-sustainable approach.
Defense objectives include: ¬ Defending the homeland from attack; ¬
Sustaining Joint Force military advantages, both globally and in key
regions; ¬ Deterring adversaries from aggression against our vital
interests; ¬ Enabling U.S. interagency counterparts to advance U.S.
influence and interests; ¬ Maintaining favorable regional balances of
power in the Indo-Pacific, Europe, the Middle East, and the Western
Hemisphere; ¬ Defending allies from military aggression and bolstering
partners against coercion, and fairly sharing responsibilities for
common defense; ¬ Dissuading, preventing, or deterring state adversaries
and non-state actors from acquiring, proliferating, or using weapons of
mass destruction; ¬ Preventing terrorists from directing or supporting
external operations against the United States homeland and our citizens,
allies, and partners overseas; ¬ Ensuring common domains remain open and
free; ¬ Continuously delivering performance with affordability and speed
as we change Departmental mindset, culture, and management systems; and
¬ Establishing an unmatched twenty-first century National Security
Innovation Base that effectively supports Department operations and
sustains security and solvency. STRATEGIC APPROACH A long-term strategic
competition requires the seamless integration of multiple elements of
national power---diplomacy, information, economics, finance,
intelligence, law enforcement, and military. More than any other nation,
America can expand the competitive space, seizing the initiative to
challenge our competitors where we possess advantages and they lack
strength. A more lethal force, strong alliances and partnerships,
American technological innovation, and a culture of performance will
generate decisive and sustained U.S. military advantages. NATIONAL

DEFENSE STRATEGY 5 As we expand the competitive space, we continue to
offer competitors and adversaries an outstretched hand, open to
opportunities for cooperation but from a position of strength and based
on our national interests. Should cooperation fail, we will be ready to
defend the American people, our values, and interests. The willingness
of rivals to abandon aggression will depend on their perception of U.S.
strength and the vitality of our alliances and partnerships. Be
strategically predictable, but operationally unpredictable. Deterring or
defeating long-term strategic competitors is a fundamentally different
challenge than the regional adversaries that were the focus of previous
strategies. Our strength and integrated actions with allies will
demonstrate our commitment to deterring aggression, but our dynamic
force employment, military posture, and operations must introduce
unpredictability to adversary decision-makers. With our allies and
partners, we will challenge competitors by maneuvering them into
unfavorable positions, frustrating their efforts, precluding their
options while expanding our own, and forcing them to confront conflict
under adverse conditions. Integrate with U.S. interagency. Effectively
expanding the competitive space requires combined actions with the U.S.
interagency to employ all dimensions of national power. We will assist
the efforts of the Departments of State, Treasury, Justice, Energy,
Homeland Security, Commerce, USAID, as well as the Intelligence
Community, law enforcement, and others to identify and build
partnerships to address areas of economic, technological, and
informational vulnerabilities. Counter coercion and subversion. In
competition short of armed conflict, revisionist powers and rogue
regimes are using corruption, predatory economic practices, propaganda,
political subversion, proxies, and the threat or use of military force
to change facts on the ground. Some are particularly adept at exploiting
their economic relationships with many of our security partners. We will
support U.S. interagency approaches and work by, with, and through our
allies and partners to secure our interests and counteract this
coercion. Foster a competitive mindset. To succeed in the emerging
security environment, our Department and Joint Force will have to
out-think, out-maneuver, out-partner, and out-innovate revisionist
powers, rogue regimes, terrorists, and other threat actors. We will
expand the competitive space while pursuing three distinct lines of
effort: ¬ First, rebuilding military readiness as we build a more lethal
Joint Force; ¬ Second, strengthening alliances as we attract new
partners; and ¬ Third, reforming the Department's business practices for
greater performance and affordability. Build a More Lethal Force The
surest way to prevent war is to be prepared to win one. Doing so
requires a competitive approach to force development and a consistent,
multiyear investment to restore warfighting readiness and field a lethal
force. The size of our force matters. The Nation must field sufficient,
capable forces to defeat enemies and achieve sustainable outcomes that
protect the American people and our vital interests. Our aim is a Joint
Force that possesses decisive advantages for any likely conflict, while
remaining proficient across the entire spectrum of conflict

[Prioritize preparedness for war. Achieving peace through strength
requires the Joint Force to deter conflict through preparedness for
war]{.underline}. During normal day-to-day operations, the Joint Force
will sustainably compete to: deter aggression in three key regions---the
Indo-Pacific, Europe, and Middle East; degrade terrorist and WMD
threats; and defend U.S. interests from challenges below the level of
armed conflict. In wartime, the fully mobilized Joint Force will be
capable of: defeating aggression by a major power; deterring
opportunistic aggression elsewhere; and disrupting imminent terrorist
and WMD threats. During peace or in war, the Joint Force will deter
nuclear and non-nuclear strategic attacks and defend the homeland. To
support these missions, the [Joint Force must gain and **maintain
information superiority**; and develop, strengthen, and sustain U.S.
security relationships.]{.underline}

Modernize key capabilities. [We cannot expect success fighting
tomorrow's conflicts with yesterday's weapons or equipment. To address
the scope and pace of our competitors' and adversaries' ambitions and
capabilities, **we must invest in modernization of key capabilities**
through sustained, predictable budgets.]{.underline} Our backlog of
deferred readiness, procurement, and modernization requirements has
grown in the last decade and a half and can no longer be ignored. We
will make targeted, disciplined increases in personnel and platforms to
meet key capability and capacity needs. The 2018 National Defense
Strategy underpins our planned fiscal year 2019-2023 budgets,
[accelerating our modernization programs and devoting additional
resources in a sustained effort to solidify our competitive
advantage]{.underline}

## Impacts 

### 2NC Impact Overview 

**Strong defense industrial base solves nuclear war with Russia, China,
North Korea, India/Pakistan, and contains the impact of failed states
across the globe**

**O'Hanlon, Senior Fellow @ Brookings, 11**

(Michael, "The National Security Industrial Base: A Crucial Asset of the
United States, Whose Future May Be in Jeopardy,"
http://www.brookings.edu/\~/media/research/files/papers/2011/2/defense%20ohanlon/02_defense_ohanlon.pdf)

[Good [defense industrial policy ]{.mark}]{.underline}is not just about
potential assets, but also [[must include an assessment of]{.mark} the
[nation's security]{.mark} requirements]{.underline} as well as the
threats faced by the United States. It is for this reason that the
policy process logically begins with a national security strategy,
coordinated at the White House, to guide defense planning and budgeting.
The same logic should therefore apply to a consideration of the nation's
future national security industrial base requirements. There are
numerous ways to assess potential risks to American security and thus
possible requirements for the nation's armed forces that would be
supplied by the defense industrial base. As an example, the following
are a range of scenarios that the U.S. military could be called upon to
deal with in the coming years. The list is suggestive, rather than
complete; more important than its wide geographic scope is its
functional variability, and coverage of many different types of possible
warfare:21 „ [Airstrikes against Iran]{.underline} or perhaps a naval
blockade of the country, [or at least the potential to threaten the
Iranian regime's hold on power in order to **deter major
aggression**]{.underline} „ **[[War between India and Pakistan over
Kashmir]{.underline}]{.mark}** [[that]{.mark} then [leads to a
robust]{.mark} international [peace implementation force **with strong
U.S. participation**]{.mark}]{.underline} „ **[[Another Korean]{.mark}
war]{.underline}**, perhaps **[[involving weapons of mass
destruction]{.underline}]{.mark}** [**[A Taiwan contingency that
could]{.underline}**,]{.mark} if things went tragically wrong[, **[pit
the U]{.underline}**]{.mark}**[nited [S]{.mark}tates [against China in
open conflict]{.mark},]{.underline}** including not only classic kinetic
operations but (as with other scenarios here) cyberwarfare and perhaps
combat in space „ Perhaps more plausibly, [Chinese challenges to other
disputed islands and associated sea and seabed resources near its
coasts]{.underline} „ A [[Russian attack on a former Soviet
republic]{.underline}]{.mark} like Georgia or,
**[[worse]{.underline}]{.mark}** yet [given]{.underline} their [NATO
membership]{.underline}, the [B[altic states]{.mark}]{.underline} „ [A
major terrorist attack on U.S. soil, perhaps even involving weapons of
mass destruction]{.underline} „ [[A **collapsing** **Congo** or
**Indonesia**]{.underline}]{.mark}...or
**[[Mexico]{.underline}]{.mark}** or **[[Pakistan]{.underline}]{.mark}**
As one looks into the future, [any such list will evolve not only as a
function of geopolitics but also of technology]{.underline}. Certainly
the trends in computers have already been remarkable, and if \"Moore\'s
Law\" continues to hold, [there could be another billion fold increase
in computing power within roughly 25 years]{.underline}. There may be
somewhat analogous trends underway in areas such as microbiology and
nanotechnology, even if the enthusiasts for a "revolution in military
affairs" of the 1990s often overstated their cases and made their
arguments about technological progress too sweeping and bold.23 [These
trends are providing the basis for the existing growth in systems like
robotics to new ones like directed energy or
nanotechnology]{.underline}. [The implications of technological trends
are that the domains in which conflict could take place, and for which
the military will be looking to find solutions, will extend into new
areas such as cyber, space, and the changed global environs as
well]{.underline}. This will connect to huge demographic trends to
create what might be termed the urban hot zone. That is, just as 15
years ago the U.S. military was not gearing up for a counterinsurgency
fight in rural Afghanistan, it may be failing now to face up to a future
fight that is much different, and perhaps more urban. [A strong majority
of the world\'s future population will lie in major urban areas and some
50 new megacities]{.underline} (with populations of 10 million or more)
will be created around the world within a quarter century. Violence and
national security threats are likely to be found emanating from such
places, where hundreds of millions of individuals, many poorly educated
and underemployed yet aware of all that the world offers that they
cannot easily access, could represent potential recruits for various
militant movements. All of these developments have major implications
for not just the defense budget and weapons decisions, but also for the
people that DoD and industry must hire. [[Operating complex systems
effectively, a traditional American strength, will require attracting
**technology-literate people**]{.mark}]{.underline} even more than in
the past. Rosie the riveter might not have to become Gussie the group
theorist, but the trend is clear nonetheless. The United States armed
forces also must think hard about how to attract and retain, and thus
[the nation's [universities and industry must figure out how to supply,
individuals with a \"Google mindset\" who expect access to
infor]{.mark}mation as well as modern devices without all the
bureaucratic encumbrances and hierarchical structures that traditionally
afflict military organizations.]{.underline} Another key aspect of this
change is that [[the U.S. will have no monopoly on power]{.mark} and
some of these sophisticated technologies, [meaning]{.mark} not just [a
diversity of new environments to prepare for, but a **deeper lethality
within them**]{.mark}]{.underline}[.]{.mark} The future period holds a
greater spread of access-denial technology, cyberthreats and \"GRAM\"
technologies (guided rockets, artillery, and mortars). Such a
\"democratization of destruction\" will continue with small states and
non-state groups having greater access to lethal technologies.24 [Even
more, a "proliferated world" of WMD in the hands of a greater number of
states seems a strong possibility]{.underline}. Some argue for pursuit
of a nuclear-free world, but even if that goal proves viable as a
vision, in [the interim it is just as likely that the threat could
become more complex and acute]{.underline}. Nuclear campaign planning
could become more important, as **[[the likelihood that one or more
nuclear weapons will be used somewhere probably
grows.]{.underline}]{.mark}**25 Another key challenge, especially in
such realms as cyberwarfare, is integration---not only within individual
systems but across systems, and with enough flexibility to allow for
modernization, adaptation and innovation. This, though, stands in direct
contrast to another key demand, which is to build resilient networks
that can resist and recover from attacks. [This same growing DoD concern
over cyber-assurance will likely grow on the hardware side, as more and
more investment and production moves away from traditional U.S. partners
and suppliers]{.underline}.26 Not all is foreboding. Historically, the
United States remains quite secure as a major power. In addition, with
China the only plausible rising rival of comparable power, we may not
face major challenges anywhere except the Western Pacific---and some
would debate the degree to which China, however impressive as a rising
power in many ways, is likely to pose a security threat to the United
States or its allies. Moreover, for all of China's strengths in
manufacturing, [the United States still enjoys advantages of leadership
in innovation.]{.underline} [The ability to integrate across systems and
technologies has been and will be a key strength.]{.underline} We can
use methods such as data mining to improve intelligence collection and
the forecasting and tracking of threats. We have a history in the "black
world" of remarkable game-changing inventions. But the challenges are
great. Making this even more difficult from a defense industrial
strategy perspective is that we do not have a national security strategy
with clear priorities. The main customer, DoD, is often unsure of its
clear wants and needs and thus companies are not likely to receive clear
demand signals. [The]{.underline} 2010 [Quadrennial Defense
Review]{.underline} document, for example, [recognized that industrial
base issues are important but failed to lay out any actual strategy or
guideposts]{.underline} for protecting and enhancing this economic
sector. On the Congressional side, the main tendency loosely seems to be
towards major platforms and minimizing the role for U.S. ground forces,
but again, it is unclear whether this links to the defined needs in a
future environment.

**That goes nuclear -- deterrence key**

Throughout the ages, freestanding, [warlike polities have]{.underline}
for brief periods **[threatened the international order]{.underline}**
while [existing **outside** the orbit of great powers]{.underline}. The
last quarter of a century witnessed another of these episodes. [The
immediate years after the USSR fell apart witnessed a **sudden profusion
of rogue states**, for which the world was **ill-prepared**]{.underline}
[after four decades of reasonably predictive actions]{.underline} from
the two superpowers and their allies. Rogue entities in earlier
historical periods possessed similar traits. [The [post-Cold War
adversarial states]{.mark} fought]{.underline}, subverted, and
confronted [other countries for their own nefarious ends. They
[differed]{.mark} from their historical predecessors **[by going after
WMD,]{.mark}**]{.underline} [[which]{.mark} **exponentially
[heightens]{.mark}**]{.underline} [[their]{.underline} **[destructive
power]{.underline}**]{.mark} [and]{.underline} their
**[danger]{.underline}** to other countries. [Now]{.underline}, as in
the past, [**[heavyweights conspire]{.underline}** [against small,
**aggressive**]{.underline}]{.mark}[, free- lance [states
bent]{.mark}]{.underline} [**[on upsetting political order.]{.mark}**
Taking on all comers alone is a **dangerous game**]{.underline} for a
pariah, no matter how much a garrison state it is. Cuba, Libya (before
its revolution), and Sudan passed from rogue status to nations less
threatening to global peace. At this juncture, Syria\'s Assad barely
clings to power amid a popular revolt. Self-preservation traditionally
dictates that outgunned rogues align with stronger protectors. Sometimes
[renegade regimes are useful to a major state, as when the Soviet Union
employed them in its chess match]{.underline} with the United States.
[Today]{.underline}, [China seems to be in the same business. As the
world relapses back to great power politics, [modern-day Machiavellians
will look for their \"prince]{.mark}\" and find him in personages such
**as [Kim Jong II or]{.mark} Bashar al-[Assad]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Be
this as it may, [[lone-wolf states have]{.underline}]{.mark}
traditionally [succumbed or [aligned themselves with a **more powerful
patron**]{.mark}]{.underline}. Much the same state of affairs is
occurring in our period. [[**Syria** hunkered behind]{.mark} a resurgent
**[Russia]{.mark}**]{.underline} opposed to the West, [[**North Korea**
moved under]{.mark} the wing of]{.underline} an ascending
**[[China]{.underline}]{.mark}**, [and an isolated [**Iran** took
advantage of the **Sino-Russo pushback** ]{.mark}**against
America**]{.underline}---[all very reminiscent of the Cold War
**competition**]{.underline} among great powers and their satellites.
Some adversarial nations---Sudan, Libya, and Cuba---slipped from the
adversarial column. But [as some rogues disappear,]{.underline} [others
will]{.underline}, no doubt, **[emerge]{.underline}**. [It is still too
early to know whether Venezuela is a rogue-in-the- making]{.underline}
or merely another Latin American authoritarian state. At the very least,
**[it has a dangerous linkage to Iran.]{.underline}** [Currently rouge
behavior sets them against the prevailing international
society]{.underline} in the early twenty-first century. Their reliance
on dictatorship, repression, and brutal security forces makes their rule
hard but brittle. As with all tyrannies they live and die by the sword.
**[[They are inherently unstable]{.underline}]{.mark}** like most police
states. [[Rogue regimes fear internal change]{.underline}.]{.mark}
[Externally, [they **pursue risky approaches**]{.mark} **at
times**]{.underline}, in part, [[to consolidate their
rule]{.underline}]{.mark} or exert their regional presence. [The
historical trajectory]{.underline} of rogues has [pointed toward an
axis]{.underline} or at least connections with a potential guardian
power. Present-day adversarial states also are maneuvering from
isolation to the protective eaves of a powerful patron, as Syria fell in
with Iran, North Korea draws closer to China, Iran seeks an anti-Western
security bloc with China and Russia, and Cuba is on Venezuelan life
support. Without foreign buttressing, the stand-alone rogues must
curtail their regional threats, as did Libya in 2003 and Cuba after the
Soviet Union split apart. Or they can suffer the fate of Iraq which the
United States militarily crushed, althought it paid a high price to
quell an antiforeign insurgency and furious sectarian violence in the
aftermath of its invasion. History's muse is too scornful and
unpredictable to hazard a confident prophesy, but the historical record
augurs against longevity for rogue regimes. Today's world of instant
communication via the Internet, YouTube, Twitter, and Facebook along
with the allure of the youth culture act as powerful solvents eating
away at closed, repressive regimes premised on threats to neighbors in
the name of ideological abstractions. [Until rogues succumb or fall
under the sway of a restraining power, the]{.underline}
**[U]{.underline}**nited **[S]{.underline}**tates and allied nations
[must tackle the challenges]{.underline} they present. **[Direct
conflict]{.underline}**, as in the Iraq War, against another rogue
nation [is far too expensive in economic and human costs for serial
application]{.underline}. Proceeding to invasion, regime change, and
occupation is an option but an unlikely one, especially since the United
States amassed staggering debts with a more than SI trillion price tag
for the Iraq and Afghan wars. The human toll likewise was steep with
over 6,000 US military deaths, tens of thousands seriously wounded, and
hundreds of thousands of inhabitants killed in the two theaters.
[America\'s dark economic picture is crimping its international
endeavors]{.underline}. Intervention-cum-[nation-building
remedies]{.underline} for derelict countries [are]{.underline} almost
[beyond consideration, given America\'s struggling economic recovery,
cash-strapped federal budget, and blooming entitlement debt. [The **only
viable approach** is]{.mark} one embodying **containment and [deterrence
to confront the threats]{.mark}**]{.underline} [[emanating from rogue
states. This]{.underline}]{.mark} approach **[[requires the hard
power]{.underline}]{.mark}** [of military forces [to give it
credibility. Armed might]{.mark}]{.underline}, in part, [[persuaded
Libya and]{.underline}]{.mark} perhaps [[Iran]{.underline} [to halt
their drive for WMD]{.underline}]{.mark}[, as]{.underline} noted
earlier. Libya's [Qaddafi believed]{.underline} President [Bush planned
to invade his country]{.underline} once the Iraq campaign ended. [The
Libyan strongman decided to **renounce his nuclear
program**]{.underline} and open his country to international arms
inspectors. [Iran also appears to have suspended the development of
weapons]{.underline} in its nuclear-energy effort at the time of the US
invasion into Iraq. Earlier, [the North Korean regime seemed awed by
Americas application of electronic, push-button military
technology]{.underline} during the Persian Gulf War, the first time that
\"smart\" weapons had been deployed with devastating effectiveness.
[[The threat of military action]{.underline}]{.mark}, therefore, **[[can
serve as a powerful inducement to]{.mark} some outlaw states to
[disarm]{.mark}]{.underline}**. [A \"carrots\"-]{.underline}laden
[approach]{.underline} (without any sticks) **[comes off as bribery from
a weak hand]{.underline}**, as North Korea so often surmised about the
American \"nice\" approach. **[[Hard power]{.underline}]{.mark}** also
[**[reinforces antirogue alliances]{.underline}**
[and]{.underline}]{.mark} **[international [sanctions to contain]{.mark}
and deter rogue-state [aggression]{.mark}.]{.underline}** Containment
and deterrence need not be totally pacific. The containment-plus
approach against Saddam Hussein following the Persian Gulf War
encompassed air strikes, no-fly zones, and even on-the-ground assistance
to Iraqi Kurds for a decade. The US-led NATO military siege against
Slobodan Milosevic\" was accompanied by political campaigning training
and funds for antiregime dissidents in nearby countries, who went on to
organize demonstrations that toppled the Serbian dictator. Even before
the Arab Spring uprisings engulfed Syria, the United States had secretly
financed the political opposition. The US Department of State funded a
satellite television channel that beamed in anti-Assad programming
beginning in April 2009.123 South Korean democracy activists have
floated balloons into the DPRK laden with antiregime messages calling
for protests among the Northern population to no avail. This angers
Pyongyang but so far has been ineffective. Computer viruses and cyber
warfare offer more subtle---and deniable---sabotage instruments than
aerial bombardments to undermine rogue threats.

#### Outweighs their war scenarios 

**Johnson, Forbes contributor and Presidential Medal of Freedom winner,

(Paul, "A Lesson For Rogue States", 5-8,
<http://www.forbes.com/sites/currentevents/2013/05/08/a-lesson-for-rogue-states/>,
ldg)

Although we live in a violent world, where an internal conflict such as
the Syrian civil war can cost 70,000 lives over a two-year period, there
hasn't been a major war between the great powers in 68 years.
[[Today's]{.mark} three [superpowers]{.mark}--the U.S., Russia and
China--[have no conflicts of interest that can't be resolved through
compromise]{.mark}]{.underline}. All have hair-trigger nuclear alert
systems, but the sheer scale of their armories has forced them to take
nuclear conflict seriously. Thus, in a real sense, nuclear weapons have
succeeded in abolishing the concept of a winnable war. [[The same cannot
be said]{.mark},]{.underline} however, [[for]{.mark} certain [paranoid
rogue states]{.mark}]{.underline}, namely North Korea and Iran. [If
these two nations appear to be prospering]{.underline}--that is, if
their nuclear threats are winning them attention and respect, financial
bribes in the form of aid and all the other goodies by which petty
dictators count success--[other prospective rogues will join
them.]{.underline} [One such state is [Venezuela]{.mark}. Currently its
[oil wealth is]{.mark} largely wasted, but it is great [enough to buy
entree to a]{.mark} junior [nuclear club.]{.mark}]{.underline} [Another
possibility is Pakistan]{.underline}, which already has a small nuclear
capability and is teetering on the brink of chaos. [[Other]{.mark}
potential [rogues]{.mark} are one or two of the components that [made up
the former Soviet Union]{.mark}.]{.underline} All the more reason to
ensure that North Korea and Iran are dramatically punished for traveling
the nuclear path. But how? It's of little use imposing further
sanctions, as they chiefly fall on the long-suffering populations.
Recent disclosures about life in North Korea reveal how effectively the
ruling elite is protected from the physical consequences of its nuclear
quest, enjoying high standards of living while the masses starve. Things
aren't much better in Iran. Both regimes are beyond the reach of
civilized reasoning, one locked into a totalitarian vise of such
comprehensiveness as to rule out revolt, the other victim of a religious
despotism from which there currently seems no escape. Either country
might take a fatal step of its own volition. Were North Korea to attack
the South, it would draw down a retribution in conventional firepower
from the heavily armed South and a possible nuclear response from the
U.S., which would effectively terminate the regime. Iran has frequently
threatened to destroy Israel and exterminate its people. Were it to
attempt to carry out such a plan, the Israeli response would be so
devastating that it would put an end to the theocracy forthwith. [The
balance of probabilities is that [neither nation will embark on
a]{.mark} deliberate [war but instead will carry on
blustering.]{.mark}]{.underline} **[[This]{.mark}, however, [doesn't
rule out war by accident]{.mark}--[a small-scale nuclear conflict
precipitated by the blunders of a totalitarian
elite]{.mark}.]{.underline}** Preventing Disaster [The most effective,
yet cold-blooded, way to teach these states the consequences of
continuing their nuclear efforts would be to make an example of one by
destroying its ruling class.]{.underline} The obvious candidate would be
North Korea. Were we able to contrive circumstances in which this
occurred, it's probable that Iran, as well as any other prospective
rogues, would abandon its nuclear aims. But how to do this? At the least
there would need to be general agreement on such a course among Russia,
China and the U.S. But China would view the replacement of its communist
ally with a neutral, unified Korea as a serious loss. Compensation would
be required. Still, it's worth exploring. **[What [we must avoid]{.mark}
is [a jittery world in which proliferating rogue states]{.mark}
perpetually [seek to be]{.mark}come [nuclear]{.mark} ones. The risk of
an [accidental conflict]{.mark} breaking out that [would]{.mark} then
[drag in]{.mark} the [major powers]{.mark} is too great.]{.underline}**
This is precisely how the 1914 Sarajevo assassination broadened into
World War I. [It is fortunate the major powers appear to have understood
the dangers of nuclear conflict without having had to experience them.
Now they must turn their minds, responsibly, to solving the menace of
rogue states]{.underline}. **[At present all we have are the bellicose
bellowing of the rogues and the well-meaning drift of the Great
Powers--a formula for an eventual and [monumental disaste]{.mark}r that
[could be the end of us all]{.mark}.]{.underline}**

### Readiness Impacts

#### Collapse causes [global war]{.underline}

**Spencer 00** -- Jack Spencer, Senior Research Fellow at The Heritage
Foundation\'s Roe Institute for Economic Policy Studies, "The Facts
About Military Readiness", Heritage Backgrounder #1394, 9-15,
http://www.heritage.org/research/reports/2000/09/bg1394-the-facts-about-military-readiness

[Military readiness is vital because declines in America\'s military
readiness **signal to the rest of the world** that the
**U**]{.underline}nited **[S]{.underline}**tates [is not prepared to
defend its interests]{.underline}. Therefore, potentially [hostile
nations will be more likely to **lash out** against]{.underline}
American [allies and interests, inevitably leading to U.S. involvement
in combat. A high state of military readiness is more likely to **deter
potentially hostile nations from acting aggressively** in regions of
vital national interest, thereby preserving peace]{.underline}.

#### Readiness is key to prevent nuclear great power war

**Dowd** **15** - senior fellow at the Sagamore Institute for Policy
Research and a contributing editor for the American Legion magazine

(Alan, "Shield & Sword: The Case for Military Deterrence", 12/31/15,
<https://providencemag.com/2015/12/shield-sword-the-case-for-military-deterrence/>,
Providence Magazine)

Surely, the same principle applies in the realm of nations. Our world
teems with violent regimes and vicious \[humans\]. And something
precious---our notion of peace, sovereignty, liberty, civilization
itself---sits exposed to all that danger. [In a world where might makes
right, the **only thing** that keeps the peace]{.underline}, defends our
sovereignty and liberty, and upholds civilization [is the willingness to
use our resources to keep the dangers at bay]{.underline}. Yet [too
many]{.underline} policymakers [disregard the wisdom of military
deterrence]{.underline}, and too many people of faith forget that the
aim of deterrence is, by definition, to prevent wars, not start them.
Some people of faith oppose the threat of military force, let alone the
use of military force, because of Christ's message of peace. This is
understandable in the abstract, but we must keep in mind two truths.
First, governments are held to a different standard than individuals,
and hence are expected to do certain things individuals aren't expected
to do---and arguably shouldn't do certain things individuals should do.
For example, a government that turned the other cheek when attacked
would be conquered by its foes, leaving countless innocents defenseless.
A government that put away the sword---that neglected its
defenses---would invite aggression, thus jeopardizing its people.
Second, all uses of force are not the same. The sheriff who uses force
to apprehend a murderer is decidedly different from the criminal who
uses force to commit a murder. The policemen posted outside a sporting
event to deter violence are decidedly different from those who plot
violence. Moral relativism is anything but a virtue. [Some lament the
fact that we live in such a violent world, but **that's precisely the
point**. Because we live in a violent world, governments must take steps
to deter those who can be deterred]{.underline}---[and neutralize those
who cannot]{.underline}. In this regard, it pays to recall that Jesus
had sterner words for scholars and scribes than He did for soldiers. In
fact, when a centurion asked Jesus for help, He didn't admonish the
military commander to put down his sword. Instead, He commended him for
his faith.\[i\] "Even in the Gospels," soldier-scholar Ralph Peters
reminds us, "it is assumed that soldiers are, however regrettably,
necessary."\[ii\] They are necessary not only for waging war but,
preferably, for maintaining peace. [It's a paradoxical truth that
**military readiness can keep the peace**]{.underline}. The Romans had a
phrase for it: Si vis pacem, para bellum. "If you wish for peace,
prepare for war." President George Washington put it more genteelly:
"There is nothing so likely to produce peace as to be well prepared to
meet an enemy." Or, in the same way, "We infinitely desire peace,"
President Theodore Roosevelt declared. "And the surest way of obtaining
it is to show that we are not afraid of war." [After the West gambled
civilization's very existence in the 1920s and 1930s on hopes that war
could somehow be outlawed]{.underline}, the men who crafted the
blueprint for waging [the Cold War returned to peace through
strength]{.underline}. Winston Churchill proposed "defense through
deterrents." President Harry Truman called NATO "an integrated
international force whose object is to maintain peace through
strength...we devoutly pray that our present course of action will
succeed and maintain peace without war."\[iii\] President Dwight
Eisenhower explained, "[Our arms must be mighty, **ready for instant
action**, so that no potential aggressor may be tempted to risk its own
destruction]{.underline}." President John Kennedy vowed to "strengthen
our military power to the point where no aggressor will dare attack."
And President Ronald Reagan steered the Cold War to a peaceful end by
noting, "None of the four wars in my lifetime came about because we were
too strong." Reagan also argued, "[Our military strength is a
**prerequisite** for peace]{.underline}."\[iv\] [Even so, **arms alone
aren't enough** to deter war]{.underline}. After all, [the great powers
were armed to the teeth in 1914]{.underline}. But since they weren't
clear about their intentions and treaty commitments, a small crisis on
the fringes of Europe mushroomed into a global war. [Neither is clarity
alone enough to deter war]{.underline}. After all, President Woodrow
Wilson's admonitions to the Kaiser were clear, but America lacked the
military strength at the onset of war to make those words matter and
thus deter German aggression. In other words, America was unable to
deter. "The purpose of a deterrence force is to create a set of
conditions that would cause an adversary to conclude that the cost of
any particular act against the United States of America or her allies is
far higher than the potential benefit of that act," explains Gen. Kevin
Chilton, former commander of U.S. Strategic Command. It is a
"cost-benefit calculus."\[v\] So, given the anemic state of America's
military before 1917, the Kaiser calculated that the benefits of
attacking U.S. ships and trying to lure Mexico into an alliance
outweighed the costs. That proved to be a grave miscalculation. [In
order for the adversary not to **miscalculate**]{.underline}, a few
factors must hold. First, [consequences must be clear]{.underline},
which was not the case on the eve of World War I. [Critics of deterrence
often cite World War I to argue that arms races trigger wars. But if it
were that simple, then a) there wouldn't have been a World War
II]{.underline}, since the Allies allowed their arsenals to atrophy
after 1918, [and b) there would have been a World War III, since
Washington and Moscow engaged in an unprecedented arms
race]{.underline}. [The reality is that **miscalculation lit the fuse**
of World War I. The antidote, as alluded to above, is **strength plus
clarity**.]{.underline} A second important factor to avoid
miscalculation: The adversary must be rational, which means it can grasp
and fear consequences. Fear is an essential ingredient of deterrence. It
pays to recall that deterrence comes from the Latin dēterreō: "to
frighten off."\[vi\] Of course, as Churchill conceded, "The deterrent
does not cover the case of lunatics."\[vii\] Mass-murderers masquerading
as holy men and death-wish dictators may be immune from deterrence. (The
secondary benefit of the peace-through-strength model is that it equips
those who embrace it with the capacity to defeat these sorts of enemies
rapidly and return to the status quo ante.) Third, [the consequences of
military confrontation must be **credible** and
**tangible**]{.underline}, which was the case during most of the Cold
War. Not only did Washington and Moscow construct vast military arsenals
to deter one another; they were clear about their treaty commitments and
about the consequences of any threat to those commitments. Recall how
Eisenhower answered Soviet Premier Nikita Khrushchev's boast about the
Red Army's overwhelming conventional advantage in Germany: "If you
attack us in Germany," the steely American commander-in-chief fired
back, "there will be nothing conventional about our response."\[viii\]
Eisenhower's words were unambiguously clear, and unlike Wilson, he
wielded the military strength to give them credibility. Discussing
military deterrence in the context of Christianity may seem incongruent
to some readers. But for a pair of reasons it is not. First, deterrence
is not just a matter of GDPs and geopolitics. In fact, scripture often
uses the language of deterrence and preparedness. For example, in the
first chapter of Numbers the Lord directs Moses and Aaron to count "all
the men in Israel who are twenty years old or more and able to serve in
the army." This ancient selective-service system is a form of military
readiness. Similarly, I Chronicles 27 provides detail about the
Israelites' massive standing army: twelve divisions of 24,000 men each.
II Chronicles 17 explains the military preparations made by King
Jehoshaphat of Judah, a king highly revered for his piety, who built
forts, maintained armories in strategically located cities "with large
supplies" and fielded an army of more than a million men "armed for
battle." Not surprisingly, "the fear of the Lord fell on all the
kingdoms of the lands surrounding Judah, so that they did not go to war
against Jehoshaphat." In the New Testament, Paul writes in Romans 13
that "Rulers hold no terror for those who do right, but for those who do
wrong...Rulers do not bear the sword for no reason." Again, this is the
language of deterrence. Those who follow the law within a country and
who respect codes of conduct between countries have nothing to fear.
Those who don't have much to fear. Likewise, to explain the importance
of calculating the costs of following Him, Jesus asks in Luke 14, "What
king would go to war against another king without first sitting down to
consider whether his 10,000 soldiers could go up against the 20,000
coming against him? And if he didn't think he could win, he would send a
representative to discuss terms of peace while his enemy was still a
long way off." In a sense, both kings are wise---one because he
recognizes that he's outnumbered; the other because he makes sure that
he's not. Put another way, both kings subscribe to peace through
strength. Again, as with the Centurion earlier, Jesus could have rebuked
the martial character of these kings, but he did not. This is not just
description but commendation. We ignore their example at our peril.
Secondly, it is not incongruent if [we understand military deterrence as
a means to **prevent great-power war**]{.underline}---the kind that
kills by the millions, [the kind humanity has not endured for seven
decades]{.underline}. We know we will not experience the biblical notion
of peace---of shalom, peace with harmony and justice---until Christ
returns to make all things new. In the interim, in a broken world, the
[alternatives to peace through strength leave much to be
desired]{.underline}: peace through hope, peace through violence, or
peace through submission. But [these options are
**inadequate**]{.underline}. [The sheer **destructiveness** and
**totality** of great-power war testify that crossing our fingers and
hoping for peace is not a]{.underline} Christian [option]{.underline}.
[Wishful thinking, romanticizing reality, is the surest way to
invite]{.underline} what Churchill called "[temptations to a trial of
strength]{.underline}." [Moreover, the likelihood that the next
great-power war would involve multiple nuclear-weapons states means that
it could **end civilization**]{.underline}. [Therefore, a posture that
leaves peer adversaries doubting the West's capabilities and
resolve---thus **inviting miscalculation**---is not only unsound, but
immoral and inhumane]{.underline}---unchristian. "Deterrence of war is
more humanitarian than anything," Gen. Park Yong Ok, a longtime South
Korean military official, argues. "If we fail to deter war, a tremendous
number of civilians will be killed."\[ix\] [Peace through
violence]{.underline} has been tried throughout history. Pharaoh, Caesar
and Genghis Khan, Lenin, Hitler, Stalin and Mao, all attained a kind of
peace by employing brutal forms of violence. However, this is not the
kind of "peace" under which God's crowning creation can flourish;
neither would the world long tolerate such a scorched-earth "peace."
This option, too, the Christian rejects. Finally, the civilized world
could bring about [peace simply by not resisting]{.underline} the
[enemies]{.underline} of civilization---by not blunting the Islamic
State's blitzkrieg of Iraq; by not defending the 38th Parallel; by not
standing up to Beijing's land-grab in the South China Sea or Moscow's
bullying of the Baltics or al-Qaeda's death creed; by not having armies
or, for that matter, police. As Reagan said, "There's only one
guaranteed way you can have peace---and you can have it in the next
second---surrender."\[x\] [The world has tried these alternatives to
peace through strength, and the outcomes have been
**disastrous**.]{.underline} After World War I, Western powers disarmed
and convinced themselves they had waged the war to end all wars. By
1938, as Churchill concluded after Munich, the Allies had been
"reduced...from a position of security so overwhelming and so
unchallengeable that we never cared to think about it."\[xi\] Like
predators in the wilderness, the Axis powers sensed weakness and
attacked. In October 1945---not three months after the Missouri steamed
into Tokyo Bay---Gen. George Marshall decried the "disintegration not
only of the Armed Forces, but apparently...all conception of world
responsibility," warily asking, "Are we already, at this early date,
inviting that same international disrespect that prevailed before this
war?"\[xii\] Stalin answered Marshall's question by gobbling up half of
Europe, blockading Berlin, and arming Kim Il-Sung in patient preparation
for the invasion of South Korea.\[xiii\] The U.S. military had taken up
positions in Korea in 1945, but withdrew all combat forces in
1949.\[xiv\] Then, in 1950, Secretary of State Dean Acheson announced
that Japan, Alaska and the Philippines fell within America's "defensive
perimeter."\[xv\] Korea didn't. Stalin noticed. Without a U.S. deterrent
in place, Stalin gave Kim a green light to invade. Washington then
reversed course and rushed American forces back into Korea, and the
Korean peninsula plunged into one of the most ferocious wars in history.
The cost of miscalculation in Washington and Moscow: 38,000 Americans,
103,250 South Korean troops, 316,000 North Korean troops, 422,000
Chinese troops and 2 million civilian casualties.\[xvi\] The North
Korean tyranny--- now under command of Kim's grandson---still dreams of
conquering South Korea. The difference between 2015 and 1950 is that
tens of thousands of battle-ready U.S. and ROK troops are stationed on
the border. They've been there every day since 1953. [The lesson of
history is that waging war is far more costly than maintaining a
military capable of deterring war]{.underline}. As Washington observed,
"Timely disbursements to prepare for danger frequently prevent much
greater disbursements to repel it." Just compare military allocations,
as a percentage of GDP, during times of war and times of peace: In the
eight years before entering World War I, the United States devoted an
average of 0.7 percent of GDP to defense; during the war, U.S. defense
spending spiked to 16.1 percent of GDP. In the decade before entering
World War II, the United States spent an average of 1.1 percent of GDP
on defense; during the war, the U.S. diverted an average of 27 percent
of GDP to the military annually. During the Cold War, Washington spent
an average of 7 percent of GDP on defense to deter Moscow; it worked.
Yet it seems we have forgotten those hard-learned lessons. In his book
The World America Made, Robert Kagan explains how "[America's most
important role has been to dampen and deter the normal tendencies of
other great powers to compete and jostle]{.underline} with one another
in ways that historically have led to war." [This role has depended on
America's military might]{.underline}. "[There is no better recipe for
great-power peace]{.underline}," Kagan concludes, "[than **certainty**
about who holds the upper hand]{.underline}."\[xvii\]

### A2: Killer Robots

#### Defense research into AI is key to innovation and won't lead to "Killer Robots"

**New, 18**. Joshua New is a senior policy analyst at the Center for
Data Innovation. He has a background in government affairs, policy, and
communication. "Fighting Military AI Research Undermines Social and
Economic Progress." (10/19/18).
https://www.datainnovation.org/2018/10/fighting-military-ai-research-undermines-social-and-economic-progress/(//JTR)

In November 2017, an advocacy group called the Campaign to Stop Killer
Robots published a short film called "Slaughterbots" in which autonomous
drones developed by the military-industrial complex terrorize and kill
innocent civilians. Though compelling, Slaughterbots is disingenuous
propaganda that stigmatizes incredibly [valuable AI research done by
defense agencies---research that will have broad social and economic
benefits beyond just defense applications. Defense research and
development (R&D) activities have long played a crucial role in the U.S.
innovation ecosystem and have been responsible for many widely-used
technologies today, including the Internet, GPS, and smartphones.
Defense agencies' investments in AI will be no different, yet should
policymakers succumb to baseless fears that military AI research will
lead to a dystopian world full of killer robots, it will set back
important AI research poised to deliver many benefits to
Americans.]{.underline}

Though the Campaign to Stop Killer Robots and others typically only call
for the ban on "fully autonomous weapons," this is not nearly so clean
cut of an issue and would significantly hinder innovation. [The
development of any fully autonomous system, whether it be a self-driving
car or a military drone, would rely on huge amounts of R&D into its
various components: navigation algorithms, computer vision algorithms,
facial recognition algorithms, and others, depending on its function.
Thus, fear of autonomous weapons,]{.underline} stoked by propaganda like
"Slaughterbots" and pundits hand-wringing about "runaway AI" alike,
[engenders apprehension for AI R&D efforts that could conceivably be
used in an autonomous weapon]{.underline}. Case in point, Google earlier
this year opted to not renew a contract with the Pentagon for Project
Maven, an initiative to develop better computer vision algorithms to
analyze drone video, after facing significant backlash due to the fact
that the technology could conceivably be used to help automate drone
strikes.

Unfortunately, [these concerns overshadow the vast amount of valuable AI
research taking place in U.S. defense agencies. The Defense Advanced
Research Projects Agency (DARPA) alone is investing heavily in AI R&D
efforts that could generate crucial breakthroughs that would benefit
broad swathes of AI applications beyond military ones]{.underline}. For
example, in 2017, DARPA allocated \$75 million for its Explainable AI
(XAI) program to spur breakthroughs in machine learning techniques that
could explain themselves or be more interpretable by humans without
sacrificing performance (there can be as-of-yet inescapable tradeoffs
between accuracy and interpretability for advanced machine learning
systems). Explainable AI would be enormously beneficial for applications
ranging from judicial decision-making to medical diagnostic software,
and would alleviate pervasive concerns about the potential for AI to be
biased and unfairly discriminate. Just recently, DARPA also announced
its Machine Common Sense program, which aims to improve AI's ability to
understand the world and communicate naturally, as AI currently can only
understand and evaluate very narrow types of problems that do not
require outside knowledge. AI with common sense would be an enormous
boon to practically every conceivable application of AI, enabling it to
intuit, for example, that solid objects cannot pass through one another,
which AI expert Oren Etzioni describes as the "holy grail of AI for 35
years or more." [The list of broadly useful AI R&D initiatives at DARPA
is long, including using AI to discover new molecules that could lead to
new medical treatments, using AI and smartphones to conduct ongoing,
passive health monitoring, and using AI to uncover and account for bias
in datasets.]{.underline}

These and other projects are part of DARPA's "AI Next" campaign, a \$2
billion initiative to "advance the state-of-the-art" in AI. [These R&D
efforts will benefit the military's use of AI, to be sure, but will also
benefit applications that generate social and economic value in
countless ways]{.underline}. Resisting such efforts due to their
potential military application is fundamentally a disagreement about the
ethics of defense activities and warfare. Debating how nations should
govern and use autonomous weapons has its place in policymaking, but
[sabotaging important AI research that can serve the public good as a
means of avoiding confronting these issues head on is counterproductive
and will harm innovation.]{.underline}

There are compelling reasons to pursue the development of AI explicitly
for defense purposes, as countries such as China and Russia develop
autonomous systems of their own. However, as policymakers responsible
for funding the federal government's R&D activities evaluate agency
budgets, they should be careful to recognize that this technology is not
just about killer robots: [AI research in defense can create
immeasurable benefits that can be broadly enjoyed by the public and
shying away from these efforts will leave Americans worse
off.]{.underline}

### 2NC Economy Module 

#### Arms Sales are key to the economy as a whole

**Gholz, 19**. Eugene Gholz is an associate professor of political
science at the University of Notre Dame. He was awarded the US
Department of Defense Exceptional Public Service Medal for his service
as senior advisor to the Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense for
Manufacturing and Industrial Base Policy. "Conventional Arms Transfers
and US Economic Security." Spring 2019.
https://www.airuniversity.af.edu/Portals/10/SSQ/documents/Volume-13_Issue-1/Gholz.pdf(//JTR)

[At the macroeconomic level, arms transfers can be a new source of
demand for American industry. The additional effort to produce goods and
services for export can stimulate and expand the supply side of the US
economy relative to a hypothetical world in which that export demand did
not exist]{.underline}. If the US economy has slack inputs, notably
unused labor---unemployed workers or potential workers who choose not to
look for jobs---[the export demand can **provide a stimulus** that uses
those slack inputs, expands the employed population, and increases total
US economic output]{.underline}. If, instead, the United States were
already at full employment before the export demand, then the exports
would require producers to outbid existing users of inputs in the US
economy---meaning the exporters would offer higher wages---and the new
export-oriented production would increase at the expense of other US
economic activity. Presumably, that other economic activity would be
lower value-added work, because the effort to bid away inputs from the
other activity would succeed by offering greater compensation in the
export-oriented sector. [The net effect of the exports would increase
**US gross domestic product (GDP)** and create "higher-paying jobs" for
American workers.]{.underline} Foreign consumers would pay the higher
costs of the export-oriented production, although with arms sales the US
government sometimes subsidizes the transaction with military aid,
reducing or even eliminating the net economic benefit to the US
economy.11

#### Strong growth and trade solves war impacts\-\--it's a conflict dampener

**Hillebrand 10** -- Hillebrand, Kentucky Diplomacy Professor, 2010
(Evan, "Deglobalization Scenarios: Who Wins? Who Loses?", Global Economy
Journal, Volume 10, Issue 2, Ebsco)

[A long line of writers]{.underline} from Cruce (1623) to Kant (1797) to
Angell (1907) to Gartzke (2003) [have theorized that economic
interdependence can lower the likelihood of war]{.underline}. Cruce
thought that free trade enriched a society in general and so made people
more peaceable; Kant thought that trade shifted political power away
from the more warlike aristocracy, and Angell thought that [economic
interdependence shifted cost/benefit calculations in a peace-promoting
direction]{.underline}. Gartzke contends that [trade relations enhance
transparency among nations and thus help avoid bargaining
miscalculations]{.underline}. [There has also been a tremendous amount
of **empirical research** that mostly supports the idea of an inverse
relationship between trade and war]{.underline}. Jack Levy said that,
―While there are extensive debates over the proper research designs for
investigating this question, and while some empirical studies find that
trade is associated with international conflict, [most studies conclude
that trade is associated with peace]{.underline}, both at the dyadic and
systemic levels‖ (2003, p 127). There is another important line of
theoretical and empirical work called Power Transition Theory that
focuses on the relative power of states and warns that when rising
powers approach the power level of their regional or global leader the
chances of war increase (Tammen, Lemke, et al, 2000). Jacek Kugler
(2006) warns that the rising power of China relative to the United
States greatly increases the chances of great power war some time in the
next few decades. The IFs model combines the theoretical and empirical
work of the peace-through-trade tradition with the work of the power
transition scholars in an attempt to forecast the probability of
interstate war. Hughes (2004) explains how he, after consulting with
scholars in both camps, particularly Edward Mansfied and Douglas Lemke,
estimated the starting probabilities for each dyad based on the
historical record, and then forecast future probabilities for dyadic
militarized interstate disputes (MIDs) and wars based on the calibrated
relationships he derived from the empirical literature. The probability
of a MID, much less a war, between any random dyad in any given year is
very low, if not zero. Paraguay and Tanzania, for example, have never
fought and are very unlikely to do so. But there have been thousands of
MIDs in the past and hundreds of wars and many of the 16,653 dyads have
non-zero probabilities. In 2005, the IFs base year---the last year of
the data base and the starting year for all simulations---the average
probability across the 183 countries represented in the model of a
country being involved in at least one war was estimated to be 0.8%,
with 104 countries having a probability of at least 1 war approaching
zero. A dozen countries8, however have initial probabilities over 3%.
[The globalization scenario projects that the probability for **war will
gradually decrease through 2035** for every country]{.underline}---but
not every dyad\--that had a significant (greater than 0.5% chance of
war) in 2005. [The decline in prospects for war stems from the
scenario's projections of rising levels of democracy, rising incomes,
and rising trade interdependence---all of these factors figure in the
algorithm that calculates the probabilities]{.underline}. Not all dyadic
war probabilities decrease, however, because of the power transition
mechanism that is also included in the IFs model. The probability for
war between China and the US, for example rises as the power9 of China
rises gradually toward the US level but in these calculations the
probability of a China/US war never gets very high.10 **[Deglobalization
raises the risks of war substantially]{.underline}**. [In a world with
much lower average incomes, less democracy, and less trade
interdependence, the average probability of a country having at least
one war in 2035 rises from 0.6% in the globalization scenario to 3.7% in
the deglobalization scenario]{.underline}. [Among the top-20 war-prone
countries, the average probability rises from 3.9% in the globalization
scenario to 7.1% in the deglobalization scenario. The model estimates
that in the deglobalization scenario there will be about 10 wars in
2035, vs. only 2 in the Globalization Scenario]{.underline}11. Over the
whole period, 2005-2035, the model predicts four great power wars in the
deglobalization scenario vs. 2 in the globalization scenario.12 Winners
and Losers Deglobalization in the form of reduced trade interdependence,
reduced capital flows, and reduced migration has few positive effects,
based on this analysis with the International Futures Model. Economic
growth is cut in all but a handful of countries, and is cut more in the
non-OECD countries than in the OECD countries. Deglobalization has a
mixed impact on equality. In many non-OECD countries, the cut in imports
from the rest of the world increases the share of manufacturing and in
61 countries raises the share of income going to the poor. But [since
average productivity goes down in almost all countries, this gain in
equality comes at the expense of reduced incomes and increased poverty
in almost all countries.]{.underline} The only winners were a small
number of countries that were small and poor and not well integrated in
the global economy to begin with---and the gains from deglobalization
even for them were very small. [Politically, deglobalization makes for
less stable **domestic politics** and a greater likelihood of war. The
likelihood of **state failure** through internal war, projected to
diminish through 2035 with increasing globalization, rises in the
deglobalization scenario]{.underline} particularly among the non-OECD
democracies. Similarly, [deglobalization makes for **more fractious
relations** among states and the probability for **interstate war**
rises.]{.underline}

### Defense Base Key 

#### The defense industry is key to the US economy

**Aerospace Industries Association, 16**. "ECONOMIC IMPACT STUDY OF THE
U.S. AEROSPACE & DEFENSE INDUSTRY". April 2016. The Aerospace Industries
Association is an American trade association representing manufacturers
and suppliers of civil, military, and business aircraft, helicopters,
UAVs, space systems, aircraft engines, missiles, material, and related
components, equipment, services, and information technology in the
United States.
<https://www.aia-aerospace.org/report/aerospace-and-defense-an-economic-impact-analysis/>(//JTR)

[The sales activity generated by the A&D industry triggers additional
economic benefits -- workers must be hired and retained in order to
deliver goods and services; companies reap additional profits and make
larger contributions to GDP; and both companies and their employees must
pay taxes]{.underline}. In this realm, IHS estimates that in 2015 the
A&D industry fueled the following contributions to the U.S. economy:

 The U.S. A&D industry directly and indirectly employed 1.7 million
workers engaged in the

design and production of end-user goods and services and within the
industry's supply chain.

About two-thirds of those workers were split about evenly between the
civilian aviation and

the defense/national security sector.

 More specifically, within the A&D industry about 531,030 workers were
employed in the

design, manufacture and supply chain of civil and general aviation
aircraft, helicopters and

space systems. Since 2013, employment in the sector has decreased by a
compound annual

growth rate (CAGR) of -0.38%, or by a net of 6,100 jobs.

 [**Another 510,570 jobs** were focused on the design, manufacture and
supply chain of end-use]{.underline}

[military aircraft, ground and sea systems, armaments and space
systems.]{.underline} Since 2013, the

segment's employment base experienced overall stability, decreasing by a
CAGR of -0.03%,

or a net loss of less than 1,000 jobs.

 Jobs supported by the A&D industry represent approximately two percent
of the nation's

total employment base.

 Direct A&D industry jobs combined with those supported in the
industry's supply chain

represented 13 percent of the nation's manufacturing employment base.

 For every million dollars in direct sales activity, eight employees
are supported throughout

the supply chain and across economic sectors.

 [The A&D industry generated **\$300 billion in economic value,** which
represented **1.8 percent**]{.underline}

[**of total nominal GDP** in the U.S.]{.underline}

 The output supported by the A&D industry directly and through the
supply chain represented

about 10 percent of manufacturing output in the U.S.

 Labor income supported by the A&D industry represented about 2.3
percent of the nation's

total labor income.

[ The average labor income per job within the A&D industry (both
producers of end-use goods]{.underline}

[and services as well as the supply chain) amounted to just over
\$93,000 -- or approximately]{.underline}

[44 percent above the national average -- reflecting the highly skilled
nature of the workforce.]{.underline}

[ The contribution to tax receipts from the A&D industry was \$63
billion, or about 1.7 percent]{.underline}

[of the total tax revenues received by the federal and state and local
governments.]{.underline}

The U.S. A&D industry is a broad complex of firms performing a variety
of functions including service delivery in support of operations and the
manufacturing of goods and of materials, components, systems and
platforms for civil aviation, space, and national security applications.
For the purposes of this analysis, the A&D industry is defined by a set
of associated sectors categorized under the North American Industry
Classification System (NAICS) that include firms that produce goods and
services for end use by A&D industry customers, while other sub-sectors
are predominately comprised of suppliers that support production.

These two primary groupings are described as having a 'direct' or
'indirect' impact on the economy; firms that engage in producing goods
and services for end use are considered to have a 'direct' impact on the
economy (for a list of these sectors, see Table 1 in the Approach and
Methodology section of this report), while firms in the supply chain are
considered to have an 'indirect' impact on the economy (for a list of
these sectors, see Table 2 in the Approach and Methodology section of
this report). Further, firms supplying to 'direct' manufacturers are
classified as 'tier I' and firms supplying to the 'tier I' suppliers are
classified as 'tier II'. In addition to this tiered classification,
there is a portion of the supplier base that does not fall within the
A&D industry. As a point of reference, firms that supply management
consulting, transportation services or office equipment to the tier I
and II A&D-supplier community do not constitute the A&D supplier base,
but are included as part of the industry's indirect and induced impact
(for a list of these sectors, see Table 3 in the Approach and
Methodology section of this report).

[The A&D industry is a vital component of the US economy,]{.underline}
not solely for the role the industry plays in national security,
transportation and technological innovation, but also because [its
influence spans many sectors and every state throughout the
country.]{.underline} From commercial airliners to military vehicle
manufacturing, [the A&D industry calls upon businesses across the nation
to supply goods and services for end-use production. From these
transactions, the A&D industry supported an average of nearly 2.8
million jobs between 2013 and 2015, representing approximately two
percent of total U.S. employment and produced an average of \$301
billion in total economic value, or 1.8 percent of nominal U.S.
GDP.]{.underline}

### Arms Sales -- Jobs 

#### Arms Sales necessary to keep workers employed and occupied

**Stone, 18**. Mike Stone is a Defense Industry Correspondent for
Reuters. (10/30/18) "Exclusive: Defense firms see only hundreds of new
U.S. jobs from Saudi mega deal."
<https://www.reuters.com/article/us-saudi-arms-jobs-exclusive/exclusive-defense-firms-see-only-hundreds-of-new-u-s-jobs-from-saudi-mega-deal-idUSKCN1N40DM>(//JTR)

Industry executives have argued that [without the Saudi package coming
through they would have fewer orders to fill]{.underline}, but robust
U.S. defense budgets, which account for the majority of their sales,
coupled with a record backlog of orders suggest little risk that workers
would face layoffs if the Saudi sales package failed to materialize.

[Certainly for each defense manufacturing job, other adjacent jobs are
supported indirectly by higher demand for defense products.]{.underline}

But Heidi Garrett-Peltier, a research fellow at the Political Economy
Research Institute, [estimated that for this type of industry the
highest multiplier would be just below 3.2. Given that, 20,000 to 40,000
sustained or new jobs could generate between about 64,000 to 128,000
jobs in related industries, Reuters calculations show, bringing the
total of sustained and new jobs to between 84,000 and
168,000.]{.underline}

In short, 500,000 jobs Trump keeps bringing up is at least three to five
times higher than what one could expect from the Saudi deal, given the
estimates from the companies themselves, plus the most generous use of
the indirect multiplier.

By its own math, [the U.S. State Department said in May 2017 that the
Saudi deal could support "tens of thousands of new jobs in the United
States."]{.underline}

#### US Arms Sales are key to 2.5 million workers in the defense and aerospace sectors of the economy 

US **State Department**, April 16, 20**18**, \"U.S. Arms Sales and
Defense Trade,\" U.S. Department of State,
<https://www.state.gov/t/pm/rls/fs/2018/280506.htm>(//JTR)

Arms sales and defense trade are key tools of foreign policy with
potential long‐term implications for regional security. For this reason,
the United States takes into account political, military, economic, arms
control, and 14 human rights conditions in making decisions on the
provision of military equipment and the licensing of direct commercial
sales to any country. Each proposed transfer is carefully assessed on a
case‐by‐case basis and approved only if found to further U.S. foreign
policy and national security interests. In addition, major defense
transfers and sales may be subject to Congressional notification. Review
and monitoring are integral components of the process for U.S.‐origin
defense equipment delivered to any recipient nation. The United States
works to ensure U.S.‐origin defense equipment is being used in the
manner intended and consistent with the agreement or licenses under
which the arms were transferred. The United States is committed to
expediting, when possible, defense transfers to U.S. allies and
partners, while at the same time seeking to prevent access to
U.S.‐origin defense technologies by hostile state and non‐state actors.
Recipients of U.S.‐origin defense articles must agree to make items
available for end‐use monitoring for the life of the equipment and may
not retransfer equipment to a third party without first receiving U.S.
authorization. [Properly regulated defense transfers support the U.S.
defense industrial base and reduce the costs of procurement for our own
military. The U.S. defense industry directly **employs almost 2.5
million** people across our nation. These individuals and the companies
they work for represent a **key part of American entrepreneurship and
innovation**, helping to maintain the United States' status as the world
leader in the defense and aerospace sectors and ensuring our armed
forces maintain their military edge.]{.underline}

#### Decline in defense exports associated with a drop in employment

**Anderton, 95**. "Economics of arms trade." Charles H. Anderton is a
Distinguished Professor of Ethics and Society with expertise in the
fields of Economics of Conflict and International Trade at the College
of the Holy Cross.
https://ideas.repec.org/h/eee/hdechp/1-18.html.(//JTR)

[Associated with a decline in demand for defense goods is a decline in
employment in the defense industry. Weapons exports are often cited as a
**mechanism to maintain employment** in the defense industrial sector in
the face of declining domestic demand for weapons.]{.underline} Table 5
presents selected empirical studies of economic impacts of arms trade.
While

the three studies highlighted in the table consider a broad range of
economic variables affected by the arms trade (e.g., jobs, inflation,
exchange rates, etc.), employment is a focal point of the studies. [In
each case, significant job displacement occurs from arms export
restraints. **Job displacement occurs** not only directly in defense
manufacturing, but indirectly in other sectors via multiplier effects
\[as in CBO (1976) and Bajusz and Louscher (1988)\] and inter-sectoral
linkages \[as in Grobar et al. (1990)\].]{.underline}

#### Defense exports are a vital component of the US economy, support high skilled workers

**Aerospace Industries Association, 18**. "U.S. DEFENSE EXPORTS:
Statistical Overview and Economic Impact Analysis for 2018." February,
2018. The Aerospace Industries Association is an American trade
association representing manufacturers and suppliers of civil, military,
and business aircraft, helicopters, UAVs, space systems, aircraft
engines, missiles, material, and related components, equipment,
services, and information technology in the United States.
<https://www.aia-aerospace.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/AIA-Defense-Exports-Statistical-Overview-Economic-Impact-2018-WebFinal.pdf>(//JTR)

This report estimates the economic contribution of U.S. defense exports
to the national economy. [U.S. defense exports have far-reaching
economic impacts.]{.underline} While some of these impacts cannot be
measured quantitatively, this analysis captures economic activity
generated by the manufacture of defense specific platforms, components
and parts using trade data available from the U.S. Department of
Commerce and the International Trade Commission. [In 2017, the U.S.
defense industry generated \$20 billion worth of exports, which
supported **204,070 U.S. jobs and generated \$51.9 billion in total
economic output**. Reflecting the high value-add nature of defense
manufacturing, the jobs multiplier for defense exports was
3.6.]{.underline} In other words, for every direct industry job
supported by defense exports manufacturing, 3.6 additional jobs were
supported throughout the U.S. economy. [Lastly, the average annual wage
of an industry job supported by defense exports was \$106,500, or 106
percent above the national average wage, while the average wage for all
jobs supported by defense exports was \$73,030, or 41 percent above the
national average.]{.underline}

### Skilled Labor Key

#### Productive use of high skilled labor is key to a strong economy

**INTERNATIONAL LABOUR OFFICE , 10**. "A Skilled Workforce for Strong,
Sustainable and Balanced Growth - A G20 Training Strategy." November,
2010. The International Labour Organization (ILO) is devoted to
promoting social justice and internationally recognized human and labour
rights, pursuing its founding mission that social justice is essential
to universal and lasting peace.
<https://www.oecd.org/g20/summits/toronto/G20-Skills-Strategy.pdf>(//JTR)

[Equipping the workforce with the skills required for the jobs of today
and those of tomorrow is a strategic concern in the national growth and
development outlooks of all G20 countries]{.underline}. Together, G20
leaders have pledged to support robust training strategies to meet the
challenges of fostering strong, sustainable and balanced growth in each
country and globally. The globalization of markets is accelerating the
diffusion of technology and the pace of innovation. New occupations are
emerging and replacing others. [Within each occupation, required skills
and competencies are evolving, as the knowledge content of production
processes and services is rising]{.underline}. A major challenge in all
G20 countries is simultaneously to enhance the responsiveness of
education and training systems to these changes in skill requirements
and to improve access to training and skills development. Many G20
countries have used training and retraining in their responses to the
employment challenges arising from the global financial crisis of 2008.
Lessons learned since that time are being applied more widely.
[Ultimately, each country's prosperity depends on how many of its people
are in work and how productive they are, which in turn **rests on the
skills they have and how effectively those skills are used**. Skills are
a foundation of decent work.]{.underline}

#### Skilled workers major factor of growth

**Radcliffe, 18**. Brent Radcliffe is a digital marketing analyst for
more than ten years, based out of Washington, D.C. "How Education and
Training Affect the Economy." (3/23/18)
https://www.investopedia.com/articles/economics/09/education-training-advantages.asp(//JTR)

[The knowledge and **skills of workers** available in the labor supply
is a **key factor** in determining both business and economic growth.
Economies with a significant supply of skilled labor, brought on through
formal education, as well as vocational training, are often able to
capitalize on this through the development of more value-added
industries, such as high-tech manufacturing.]{.underline}

#### Skilled Labor Industry is key to the economy and innovation

**The Innovation Policy Program, 12.** "Skilled Labor." The Innovation
Policy Platform (IPP), developed by the Organisation for Economic
Co-operation and Development (OECD) and the World Bank is a web-based
interactive space that provides easy access to knowledge, learning
resources, indicators and communities of practice on the design,
implementation, and evaluation of innovation policies.
https://www.innovationpolicyplatform.org/content/skilled-labour(//JTR)

[Access to skilled labour is key for innovation in firms: **skilled
labour can contribute to innovation and growth** by generating new
knowledge, developing incremental innovations, supporting firms in the
identification of business opportunities, helping companies adapt to
changing environments, generating spillovers (transfer of knowledge to
co-workers) within the organization and adding to social
capital.]{.underline} Although educational attainment has risen steadily
in OECD countries in past decades, innovating firms still suffer from a
shortage of skilled labour, inhibiting their capacity to innovate. The
question of skilled labour is related to broader questions of access to
labour. [**Innovative businesses require specific skills and
experience**.]{.underline} The costs of hiring and firing are critical
in shaping how innovative businesses tap into skilled labour. Public
policy could improve innovative firms' access to skilled labour by
strengthening education about innovation, promoting an innovation
culture, raising public interest in S&T, attracting young people to
pursue higher education in S&T disciplines and encouraging lifelong
learning to allow people to upgrade their skills throughout their adult
lives.

#### High skilled workers key

**Mason, 18**. Geoff Mason has extensive experience of applied research
studies, including cross-country comparisons, in the areas of
productivity, innovation, education, training and labour markets. He is
a Visiting Professor and Project Leader at The Centre for Learning and
Life Chances in Knowledge Economies and Societies. "Workforce skills at
all levels boost innovation and productivity." January 2018.
https://esrc.ukri.org/news-events-and-publications/evidence-briefings/workforce-skills-at-all-levels-boost-innovation-and-productivity/(//JTR)

[There is a **positive link** between high-skilled workers and turning
**external knowledge into innovative output,**]{.underline} but this
link also extends to intermediate-skilled workers (for instance, the
support of technicians in new product design and development).

T[he ability to feed innovative output into productivity depends on a
firm\'s full range of skill levels]{.underline} -- not just skills
associated with formal qualifications, but also uncertified skills.

[When innovation pushes the technological limits, new opportunities for
productivity improvements also trickle down to the less innovative
\'laggard\' firms. Country/industry sectors far from the technological
frontier typically benefit most from the scope for knowledge transfers
from technological leaders.]{.underline}

[Even when country/industry sectors are relatively close to the
technological cutting edge, productivity growth benefits not just from
high-level skills,]{.underline} but also from being complemented by
upper intermediate skilled workers who can help adopt best practices,
new business models and investment in other intangible assets.

[Producers of goods and services **depend on the skills** of the whole
workforce to transform and apply acquired knowledge effectively. For
producers of innovative outputs (such as patents) high-level and upper
intermediate skills are more important than lower levels of
skill.]{.underline}

### Dual Use 

#### 40% of military R&D leads to dual use tech

**Lu et al 16**. Wen-Min Lu works at The Department of Financial
Management, National Defense University, No. 70, Section 2, Zhongyang
North Road, Beitou, Taipei 112, Taiwan. "Evaluating the efficiency of
dual-use technology development programs from the R&D and socio-economic
perspectives." July 2016.
https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0305048315001851(//JTR)

[Technologies that civilians use in the daily life (e.g., global
positioning system and the Internet) are initially developed and applied
for the purpose of national defense. In other words, the driving force
prompting developments in the emerging industries such as the
information and communications technology (ICT) and semi-conductor
industries is the development of technologies in military]{.underline}.
Overall, this trend leads to the development of dual-use technologies,
i.e. technologies for civilians and militaries. According to an analysis
conducted by Benoit \[1\], a U.S. national defense economist, [**at
least 40 percent of successful military technologies contribute in
improving people\'s economic wellbeing.** Specifically, military
technologies are able to **enhance a country\'s security and the overall
national economy** \[2--4\]. By incorporating military technologies into
the private industries, countries not only transfer military innovations
or inventions to civilian livelihood that create incomes, but also help
upgrade technologies in the private industries, which in turn actively
participate in the construction of national defense.]{.underline}

#### Dual use tech has a significant effect on the economy and tech leadership

**Mehta, 17**. Aaron Mehta is Deputy Editor and Senior Pentagon
Correspondent for Defense News, covering policy, strategy and
acquisition at the highest levels of the Department of Defense and its
international partners. "OMB: Pentagon should emphasize dual-use R&D
spending." (8/17/17).
https://www.defensenews.com/pentagon/2017/08/17/omb-pentagon-should-emphasize-dual-use-rd-spending/(//JTR)

[For defense, that means balancing military needs with a focus on
technology that could find uses in a different context]{.underline} --
while looking to trim costs for programs that may no longer be feasible.

["While military R&D should serve the national defense first and
foremost, the Administration recognizes the contributions of military
R&D to the development of tremendously useful civil applications,"
Mulvaney and Kratsios write. "Accordingly, we **encourage programs with
dual-use potential** to be leveraged for Federal non-military
advancements."]{.underline}

A similar push is evident in a section focused on homeland security
needs, which emphasizes that "[Special attention should be paid to R&D
that can support the safe and secure integration into society of new
technologies that have the potential to **contribute significantly to
American economic and technological leadership."**]{.underline}

#### Tech developments backbone of the economy

**Çaliskan, 15.** Hülya Kesici Çaliskan has a degree of Economic Theory
and works at the Department of Economics at Istanbul University.
"Technological Change and Economic Growth." 2015.
<https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1877042815036538(//JTR)>.

[Nowadays scientific and technological changes form the motivating power
of scientific and economic policies adopted to ensure economic growth
and development. Technological development brings economic
growth]{.underline}. However it also enhances social wealth on the one
hand by increasing the income levels and wealth and causes certain
social problems on the other hand. [Technological development makes very
important contributions to the economic and social-cultural
life.]{.underline} A study conducted in America reveals that people work
more than the past; virtues like industriousness and self-discipline are
more valued; entrepreneurship increased and people increased their
technological capabilities for their new careers (EraydÕn, 2001).
However in spite of these positive developments, the fluctuations and
uncertainties created in the commercial life by the technological
development caused uncertainties in the job positions of the employees.
While technological development eliminated certain jobs and work areas
and made a negative impact to employment on the one hand, it created new
job opportunities and taught other methods to perform the jobs on the
other hand.

This condition brought negative consequences for the developing
countries that have great difficulties in producing technology. The
traditional industrial centers of the past find hard to preserve their
competitive power and at the same time, global cities started to become
dominant as new supervisory centers. Causing increased communication,
easy and fast access to the new markets, increase in the marketing
channels and company mergers, technological development made a positive
impact to the economy. As a result of e-commerce made on Internet, the
dimensions of commerce have changed. The producers and consumers could
meet with each other in international markets through e-commerce and
make commerce. [Technological advances develop competition among
nations.]{.underline}

[For the technology producing countries, technology brings **economic
and military superiority** to other countries. Thus **countries with
superior technology may exert pressure to the other
countries.**]{.underline} The speed of the technological development
causes economic uncertainty and difficulties in forecasting the future.
Increasing exposition of the economies to global fluctuations, fierce
competition environment and insufficient security cause economic
negativities. Increasing mutual dependency between the global countries
make economies exposed to the financial crises (Mandel, 1998). One of
the areas in which we can observe the effects of technological
development is the financial markets. Many banks and intermediary
institutions adapt their systems to the technological developments and
start to provide online banking services. Branch-free banking activities
are able to provide banking services on 7-24 basis throughout the world
because information could be transferred and shared.

[This is having an adverse effect on the long-term sustainability of the
industry.]{.underline} In addition, the [trend towards importing
equipment off-the-shelf will inevitably degrade European nations'
front-line operational capability as the deep, system-level
understanding of domestically designed and developed products
declines.]{.underline}

[Reductions in defence research and technology (R&T) also have a proven
negative impact on the European economy]{.underline}. A European Defence
Agency [factsheet published last year reported that for every €100m cut
in EU defence industrial spending, there is a €150m fall in EU GDP, a
€40m fall in EU tax revenues and a loss of 2,870 jobs, 760 of which
would be highlyskilled employees.]{.underline}

### Economy Uniqueness 

#### Economy strong now, GDP proves

https://www.thebalance.com/us-economic-outlook-3305669(//JTR)

[The U.S. economic outlook is healthy according to the key economic
indicators. The most critical indicator is the gross domestic product,
which measures the nation\'s production output. The GDP growth rate is
expected to remain between the 2% to 3% ideal range. Unemployment is
forecast to continue at the natural rate. There isn\'t too much
inflation or deflation. **That\'s a Goldilocks economy.**]{.underline}

#### The economy is defying expectation snow, key job growth

**Long, 19**. Heather Long is an economics correspondent for The
Washington Post. She has a masters in financial economics from Oxford
University. "Is this economy too good to be true?" (5/3/19).
https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/economy/is-this-the-too-good-to-be-true-economy/2019/05/03/9f05aff0-6dbc-11e9-8f44-e8d8bb1df986_story.html?utm_term=.f1d6a0fc505e(//JTR)

[The U.S. economy again **defied expectations in April**, as another
month of strong hiring and falling unemployment]{.underline} forced
experts to reevaluate just how good the economy can get --- and how long
the current expansion can last.

[Employers added 263,000 new jobs last month, a record **103 straight
months of job growth**, and the official unemployment rate fell to 3.6
percent, the lowest since 1969, the Labor Department reported
Friday.]{.underline}

[The latest piece of good news comes accompanied by strong wage growth,
hot stock markets and a first-quarter growth report last week that
smashed expectations. Equally noteworthy is what economists aren't
seeing: the high levels of inflation that have accompanied previous
expansions.]{.underline}

As the economy continues to grow past what many predicted was possible,
some analysts and officials are wondering if the current state of the
economy is too good to be true --- and that experts must be missing
warning signs.

Some expressed concerns about rising debt after the Trump administration
undertook heavy borrowing to fund tax cuts and additional government
spending to boost growth. President Trump is actively pushing for more,
including a \$2 trillion infrastructure package, additional military
spending and extra stimulus from the Federal Reserve.

[But **few, if any, deny the remarkable overall strength** of the U.S.
economy.]{.underline}

[**Spectacular'** is the only way to describe this jobs report," said
Sung Won Sohn, an economist at Loyola Marymount University and SS
Economics.]{.underline} "It is hard to believe that this 10-year-old
recovery keeps pumping out home runs."

#### No recession, the economy is healthy and has long projected growth. Household debt down, tax cuts, unemployment. China strong too

**Rapoza, 19.** Kenneth Rapoza is a senior contributor to Forbes with a
focus on business and investing in the big emerging markets exclusively
for Forbes. "The Trump 2020 Economic Recession Isn\'t Happening."
(4/29/19).
https://www.forbes.com/sites/kenrapoza/2019/04/29/the-trump-2020-economic-recession-isnt-happening/#681a038c312b(//JTR)

[About that 2020 recession, people: **It's not happening.** Here\'s
why.]{.underline}

\"[The earnings season is coming in healthier than people expected three
weeks ago. Most companies' earnings are coming in better than we
thought]{.underline}," says Scott Clemons, chief investment strategist
for Brown Brothers Harriman in New York. "[**We see no earnings
recession coming at us**.]{.underline} The highs in the S&P are similar
to where we were in October. The economy is a bit better, interest rates
are lower and the likelihood of a very aggressive Fed is remote. [All of
that is supportive of growth. No recession next year."]{.underline}

As everyone now knows, [the U.S. economy grew 3.2% in the first quarter,
beating the consensus forecast]{.underline}. When the economy was
growing at similar numbers in Trump's first quarters in office, guys
like Krugman explained it all away as merely a by-product of the Obama
Administration.

The Obama presidency must still be serving us leftovers.

[Growth came thanks to tax cuts, followed by regulatory rollback, which
helped some industries.]{.underline}

Another factor economists are considering is all the deleveraging of
household balance sheets that began in earnest in the Obama years.
[Americans were paying off debt instead of spending. Much of that
delveraging was due to the housing bubble popping in 2008.]{.underline}

[Household debt of equivalent income was over 144% 10 years ago and is
now at 99%, according to Federal Reserve data.]{.underline}

["That's about \$6 trillion that has gone towards deleveraging rather
than spending and driving the economy]{.underline}," Clemons says. "In
other words, it's not just the Fed we need to help the economy growth.
We are paying back bills, and that's led to lower growth in the past. It
restores health to the American household balance sheet, but you get
little in the way of spending so a penny saved is not a penny going to
corporate earnings, let's say."

[Deleveraging has led to a relatively stable, if not unimpressive, 1.2%
annualized consumer growth rate.]{.underline}

Even without Americans shopping with reckless abandon, the [**stock
market made a new high** for the year last week]{.underline}. And while
the S&P 500 is a poor indicator of the true economic sentiment on Main
Street, Wall Street's confidence is telling. It tells us that big
investors believe the Fed's dovish tilt means no rate hikes this year.
Three to four hikes were expected back in January.

The CME FedWatch Tool is giving a 50+% probability of a rate cut at the
October 2019 Fed meeting. Prudent investors won't count on that,
especially if China is still in stimulus mode and U.S. wages hold steady
or push higher.

[The IMF increased its forecast for China's GDP two weeks ago to 6.3%
from 6.2%.]{.underline}

March industrial profits in China increased 13.9% year-over-year to
around \$87 billion, according to the National Bureau of Statistics in
Beijing. Too much good news could lead to less stimulus. Still[**, none
of this looks like a recession**.]{.underline}

The conclusions reached in this thesis demonstrate how [economic
considerations within states can figure **prominently into the calculus
for future conflicts**]{.underline}. The findings also suggest that
[security issues with economic or financial underpinnings will transcend
classical determinants of war and conflict, and change the manner by
which rival states engage in hostile acts toward one
another]{.underline}. The research shows that [security concerns
emanating from economic uncertainty and the inherent vulnerabilities
within global financial markets will present new challenges for national
security, and provide developing states new asymmetric options for
balancing against stronger states.]{.underline}¶ [The security
areas]{.underline}, identified in the proceeding chapters, [are likely
to mature into **global security threats** in the immediate
future]{.underline}. As the case study on South Korea suggest, [the
overlapping security issues associated with economic decline and reduced
military spending by the United States will **affect allied confidence
in America's security guarantees**]{.underline}. The study shows that
[this outcome could cause **regional instability** or realignments of
strategic partnerships in the Asia-pacific region with ramifications for
U.S. national security]{.underline}. [Rival states and non-state groups
may also become **emboldened to challenge America's
status**]{.underline} in the unipolar international system.¶ [The
potential risks associated with **stolen or loose WMD**]{.underline},
[resulting from poor security, can also pose a threat to U.S. national
security]{.underline}. The case study on Pakistan, Syria and North Korea
show how [financial constraints affect weapons security making weapons
vulnerable to theft, and how financial factors can influence WMD
proliferation]{.underline} by contributing to the motivating factors
behind a trusted insider's decision to sell weapons technology. The
[inherent vulnerabilities within the global financial markets will
provide terrorists' organizations and other non-state
groups]{.underline}, who object to the current international system or
distribution of power, [with opportunities to disrupt global finance and
perhaps weaken America's status]{.underline}.

#### US economic decline spills worldwide and causes global economic collapse

Accessed 6-21-19)

[A striking feature of today's global economic landscape is the many
**weaknesses in the world's major economies**]{.underline}. In Europe,
following the Brexit vote, the [United Kingdom's economy is likely to be
beset by many years of investor uncertainty as it renegotiates its
complex relationship with Europe.]{.underline}

[Meanwhile Italy, the Eurozone's third-largest economy, is having to
cope with major difficulties in its banking system, the
over-indebtedness of its government, and growing public antipathy to the
Euro]{.underline}. This is all the more serious considering that Italy
will hold a constitutional referendum later this year, which could see a
fall in the Italian government. [It also must be of concern that, unlike
Greece, Italy is simply too big for Europe to save should it face an
economic and political meltdown.]{.underline}

[In Asia, Japan's over-indebted economy is again flirting with both
deflation and economic recession, while the Chinese economy is
struggling to make the transition away from an investment- and
export-led economy to one led by consumption and the service
sector]{.underline}. At the same time[, major emerging market economies
like Brazil, Russia and South Africa are all having to cope with
depressed international commodity prices and with excessive corporate
U.S. dollar indebtedness.]{.underline}

[Further clouding the global economic outlook is the fact that the world
is now drowning in debt.]{.underline} Indeed, a recent McKinsey Global
Institute study found that private and public sector debt levels around
the world today are very much higher than they were in 2008 on the eve
of the Great Economic Recession. [This makes it all the more important
that the world economy is not hit by a renewed shock that might cause
the world economy to falter and that would make the repayment of that
debt all the more difficult.]{.underline}

[It is against this troubled background that one would think **that the
last thing that the world economy needs right now is a period of
investor uncertainty in the United States**, the world's largest
economy.]{.underline} Yet that is very well what could happen if the
presidential candidates continue to outbid themselves on tax giveaways
and lavish public spending promises that might compromise the country's
public finances.

### NU -- Readiness 

#### there is a readiness crisis now

**Johnson, 16**. Justin Johnson is senior policy analyst for defense
budgeting at The Heritage Foundation. "The Military's Real Readiness
Crisis; Petraeus & O'Hanlon Are Wrong." (8/17/16).
<https://breakingdefense.com/2016/08/the-militarys-real-readiness-crisis-odierno-petraeus-are-wrong/(//JTR)>

It's no news to Breaking Defense readers that [the U.S. military faces a
readiness crisis. But retired Gen. David Petraeus apparently
disagrees.]{.underline}

[Yes, the military's budget has been cut by 25 percent in real terms
since 2011---much of it coming from accounts used to maintain and build
combat readiness. Yes, leaders from the Army, Navy, Air Force and Marine
Corps have all publicly expressed their deep concerns about readiness
levels. And, yes, top brass are publicly discussing "Carter-era"
readiness problems and even the prospect of a hollow
military.]{.underline}

[Still, Petraeus and the Brookings Institution's Michael
O'Hanlon]{.underline} took to the pages of the Wall Street Journal last
week to bust the "myth" of a military readiness crisis[. I deeply
respect both men, but **they got this one wrong.**]{.underline}

[Pentagon leaders---both civilian and military---as well as their
overseers in Congress concur that the readiness crisis is
real.]{.underline} Many of the details regarding the problems remain
(rightly) classified, but enough facts have been made public to remove
any doubt that readiness is a wide-spread problem in the military today.

**[Petraeus and O'Hanlon completely ignore readiness statements from
recent and current military leaders]{.underline}**. Consider the
assessment of Gen. Raymond Odierno, Petraeus' right-hand man during the
Iraq Surge. Before leaving his post as Army Chief of Staff last year,
Odier[no said Army readiness was at "historically low levels." Current
Army Chief of Staff Gen. Mark Milley echoed that conclusion. He recently
told Congress that he has "**grave concerns about the readiness of our
force**" to deal with a serious challenger like Russia or
China.]{.underline}

Instead of responding to current military leaders, Petraeus and O'Hanlon
offer "reassuring facts" that are worth further consideration.

[First, they point out that today's defense budget is higher than the
Cold War average in inflation-adjusted dollars. This is true, but it
offers a very incomplete picture. Petraeus and O'Hanlon would surely
agree that our military today is far different than what we had in the
Cold War. Adjusting for inflation does not account for the higher cost
of better equipment.]{.underline}

Adjusting for inflation, a standard Ford F-150 costs 40 percent more
today than it did in 1986. Why? Because today's F-150 is far more
technologically advanced and capable. The same is true for military
equipment.

A more complete picture of defense spending appears when we look at
defense spending in terms of its percentage of GDP and percentage of
total federal budget. By both of these measures, the current defense
budget is at historic lows.

Perhaps more significantly, [today's defense budget is **well below the
minimums** agreed to by bipartisan experts]{.underline}. The National
Defense Panel, for example, agreed that former Secretary of Defense Bob
Gates' last budget (in fiscal year 2012) represented the bare minimum.
For 2017, that budget would be \$100 billion more than President Obama's
current request.

[Second, Petraeus and O'Hanlon point out that the military is on track
to spend \$100 billion per year to buy new equipment. A nice round
number, it bears no relation to what the military truly
needs.]{.underline} A strong military is not built by investing an
arbitrary number, but by a clear analysis of what threats the nation
faces and what equipment the military needs and how big it must be to
defend against those threats. The Secretary of Defense has been clear
that the military needs significantly more funding over the next few
years, particularly to replace equipment that is past its useful life.

[Third, they argue that "most \[military\] equipment remains in fairly
good shape." They admit that Marine Corps aviation is not, but recent
testimony shows that aircraft across all four services are in similarly
rough shape]{.underline}. And as seen in the 2016 Index of U.S. Military
Strength, all the services are laden with equipment that is decades old
and difficult to maintain. Across the military, the maintenance and
modernization challenges are serious and seem to be growing.

[Fourth, Petraeus and O'Hanlon argue that training is improving. This
appears to be true, but once again **they ignore concerning statements**
about where our military stands today.]{.underline}

[Secretary of the Air Force Deborah Lee James has repeatedly stated that
less than half of all Air Force squadrons are ready for combat and that
the Air Force faces serious shortages of both pilots and mechanics. At
the same time, pilot flying hours (i.e. training) have fallen
dramatically.]{.underline}

Army units are rotating through training centers, but only one-third of
this historically small force are considered ready for high-end combat.
Training may be improving in some quarters, but the lack of combat-ready
units across the services points to serious underlying problems.

Petraeus and O'Hanlon are right on one point. [The U.S. military remains
an incredible fighting force. But **its readiness for combat has
declined precipitously in the last five years.**]{.underline}

Today's men and women in uniform put their lives on the line for our
country, but they are doing so with less training, worn out equipment,
and fewer brothers and sisters in arms to back them up. With threats
rising across the globe, all Americans should be concerned about the
troubling state of the U.S. military.

### No Link -- Arms sales not Key Readiness 

#### Arms sales have little proven effect on military innovation

**Gholz 19** (Eugene Gholz, Gholz is an associate professor of political
science at the University of Notre Dame Published in Spring 2019,
"Conventional Arms Transfers and US Economic Security" Strategic Studies

Access date 6-20-19)//GH

Conventional arms transfers can have separate, microeconomic effects of
interest to a discussion of economic security, including effects on
innovation and manufacturing highlighted in the Presidential Memorandum.
[The **defense industry is not like a normal commercial industry**,
where corporations use retained earnings from their past sales---or
borrowing from investors, who expect to be repaid from future sales
revenue---to invest in research and development**. Innovation in the
defense industry is mostly supported by direct government research and
development (R&D) contracts**. That is, the DOD customer directs the
trajectory of innovation and pays for specific R&D effort. Another
fraction of total defense R&D comes from companies' Independent Research
and Development (IR&D) expenditures]{.underline}, [reimbursed by the
government as part of the overhead cost of other government-funded
defense projects. IR&D spending is company directed, but it is also paid
for by the DOD customer, not drawn from the company's retained
earnings.]{.underline} [As a result, general **increases in defense
firms' profitability---which** might **stem from arms sales** approved
under the CAT policy---**do not generally have much effect on defense
innovation** at the systems level]{.underline}. However, many suppliers
in the defense supply chain operate on commercial terms, and for them,
the general added revenues from expanded defense sales contribute to the
retained earnings that support their R&D investment. Thus, at the
supplier level, arms sales can contribute to US innovation. However,
generally, [the suppliers are less visible, as are the innovations they
might choose to invest in with the marginal dollar of income. Due to
that lack of visibility, it would be difficult for an economic
assessment, as part of the CAT approval process, to give much weight to
the potential innovation-related investments by commercial firms at
lower tiers of the defense supply chain]{.underline}

#### Defense Exports and FMS tiny compared to commercial aerospace exports

While [commercial aerospace exports have outpaced both direct commercial
defense exports and FMS]{.underline}, on a combined basis, defense
exports and FMS have represented a significant portion of overall US A&D
exports (see Figure 10). [In 2014 to 2016, they(FMS) accounted for 35
percent, 37 percent, and 33 percent of the total exports. With the
anticipated growth in defense related exports, their contribution could
exceed 40 percent of the total in the next two years.]{.underline}

On August 23, 2018, the Senate passed the [Department of Defense

OCO/GWOT base RDT&E funding for a total of **\$96.308
billion**.]{.underline} This represents an increase of \$5.726 billion
(6.3%) over the FY2018 enacted Title IV RDT&E funding level (base and
OCO/GWOT), an increase of \$3.943 billion (4.3%) above the request, and
an increase of \$3.885 billion (4.2%) above the House-passed level.

Accessed 6-20-19)//GH

[The new CAT policy outlines the purpose of arms sales, and places a
keen emphasis on the anticipated economic benefits of weapons transfers.
As the policy asserts, the **purpose of arms transfers** (under the
Trump administration) is to help the United States:]{.underline}

["**maintain a technological edge** over potential adversaries;
strengthen partnerships that preserve and extend our global influence;
bolster our economy; **spur research and development**;]{.underline}
enhance the ability of the defense industrial base to create jobs;
increase our competitiveness in key markets; protect our ability to
constrain global trade in arms that is destabilizing or that threatens
our military, allies, or partners; and better equip our allies and
partners to contribute to shared security objectives and to enhance
global deterrence."

[These priorities sound reasonable in theory, but the **arms trade does
not work** like the trade in cars or bananas. A focus on short-term
economic benefits overlooks the realities of the global arms trade, in
which the wares being sold and transferred endure long after the
transfer is completed and can be used to promote or undermine U.S.
interests]{.underline}. Recent transfers of weapons and vehicles
supplied to the Iraqi military, which were then seized by ISIS and used
against U.S. troops and interests is but one in a long book of
cautionary tales.

#### The DOD uses circular defense logic, changing one input doesn't necessarily affect the output in a linear fashion

**Harrison, 14.** Todd Harrison is the director of Defense Budget
Analysis and the director of the Aerospace Security Project at CSIS. As
a senior fellow in the International Security Program, he leads the
Center's efforts to provide in-depth, nonpartisan research and analysis

Readiness." Fall 2014.
https://www.airuniversity.af.edu/Portals/10/SSQ/documents/Volume-08_Issue-3/Harrison.pdf(//JTR)

[Reporting the status of readiness using inputs creates a **circular
chain of logic** when those reports are used to justify the inputs
required. In other words, the readiness reporting system is used to
justify a certain level of readiness inputs, but the readiness reporting
system is merely a measurement of the inputs it is used to justify. This
approach implicitly assumes that outputs are directly proportional to
inputs---that is, if the inputs increase, readiness will
increase.]{.underline}

As the DoD noted in its most recent budget submission, [the **inputs to
readiness are "non-linear variables** \[that\] work together to produce
ready forces."]{.underline} Numerous studies have established a
nonlinear relationship between training and performance for a variety of
jobs in the military, with the best correlation often being a power law
or log(n) function.[20 Nonlinear systems can behave in **complex and
unexpected ways** because the output is not directly proportional to the
input]{.underline}. For example, increasing the flying hours of a
squadron could harm its readiness if crews are forced to fly to the
point of fatigue. In practice, a pilot's flying time is limited in both
the military and commercial aviation because excessive flying has been
shown to reduce performance and increase accident rates.21

#### No readiness impact

[The **U**]{.underline}nited **[S]{.underline}**tates
[seems]{.underline} to be substantially **[free from threats that
require a great deal of military preparedness]{.underline}**.

To begin with, it really seems time to consider the consequences of the
fact that a [conflict like World War II is extremely
unlikely]{.underline} to recur. Spending a lot of money for an
eventuality---or fantasy---of ever-receding likelihood is highly
questionable. [Some envision threat in China's]{.underline}
rapidly-increasing [prosperity]{.underline}. But, although its
oft-stated desire to incorporate (or re-incorporate) Taiwan into its
territory should be watched, [armed conflict would be]{.underline}
extremely---even [overwhelmingly---costly]{.underline} to the country.
And **[Chinese leaders]{.underline}**, already rattled by internal
difficulties, seem to [**realize this**. Russia's]{.underline} recent
[assertiveness]{.underline} bears watching, but it [does not suggest
that the game has been]{.underline} crucially [changed. It might make
sense to maintain a containment]{.underline} and deterrent [capacity
against rogue states]{.underline} in formal or informal coalition with
other concerned countries. However, [**the military requirements for the
task are limited**. Humanitarian intervention with military force is
unlikely]{.underline} due to a low tolerance for casualties in such
ventures, an increasing aversion to the costs of nation-building, and
the lack of political gain from successful ventures. [Concern about
nuclear proliferation is overwrought]{.underline}: long experience
suggests that when countries obtain the weapons, they "use" them only to
stoke their national ego and to deter real or imagined threats.
[Europe]{.underline} seems to [face no]{.underline} notable [threats of
a military nature]{.underline}, the [Taiwan/China]{.underline} issue
[remains a]{.underline} fairly [remote concern]{.underline}, and
[Israel's primary problems derive from the actions of sub-state
groups]{.underline}. The [military relevance of the terrorism "threat"
has been substantially exaggerated]{.underline}, and it mainly calls for
policing and intelligence work and perhaps for occasional focused
strikes by small units.

### A2: Dual Use

#### Dual Use technology causes increased access to nukes, bioterror, wmds, etc.

**Rosner 16** (Robert Rosner is an astrophysicist and founding director
of the Energy Policy Institute at the University of Chicago, where he is
the William E. Wrather Distinguished Service Professor in the
departments of Astronomy and Astrophysics and Physics, Edited by Elias
D. Harris, Published in 2016, "Governance of Dual-Use Technologies:
Theory and Practice"
<https://www.amacad.org/sites/default/files/academy/multimedia/pdfs/publications/researchpapersmonographs/GNF_Dual-Use-Technology.pdf>,
Accessed 6-22-19)//GH

[**Modern concerns about dual-use technologies** emerged in concert with
fears about the proliferation of nuclear weapons--related technologies
in the early days of the Cold War. These concerns focused on obvious
targets, such as specialty steels, high-precision computer-aided
manufacturing tools and facilities, and high-performance software and
hardware; that is, materials and tools that are readily adapted to
nuclear weapons--related design and manufacturing. More recently, focus
has shifted to nonnuclear technological contexts---including, most
prominently, biological and information technology---]{.underline}in
which ongoing research and development has dramatically advanced human
social and economic well-being, though [at the **cost of generating
potential for these technologies to be harnessed for nefarious
purposes**.]{.underline}

Of course, the dual nature of technological advances---capable of
elevating humanity and unleashing destruction upon it---long predates
the total war and scientific breakthroughs of the twentieth century. For
example[, the chemical advancements underlying the use of fireworks in
imperial China were adapted by the tenth century AD to produce "fire
arrows" for use in battle. What has changed since is not the balance of
dual-use technologies, **but the ability of modern weaponry to kill on
drastically greater scales**,]{.underline} [affecting vast portions of
the earth's surface]{.underline}---a dynamic captured in J. Robert
Oppenheimer's sobering allusion to the two-thousand-year-[old
Bhagavad-Gita: "I am become Death, the destroyer of worlds," when
describing the Trinity nuclear explosion. **We are faced today with
weaponry that is appropriately referred to as weapons of mass
destruction.**]{.underline}

#### Dual use technology is extremely dangerous and brings along many threats -- Viruses, Biological agents, Modified organisms, etc. 

**Harris 16** (Elisa D. Harris is a Senior Research Associate at the
Center for International and Security Studies at Maryland (CISSM),
Published in 2016, "Chapter 2 Dual Use Threats: The Case of Biological
Technology, Governance of Dual-Use Technologies: Theory and Practice,
<https://www.cissm.umd.edu/sites/default/files/Dual-Use%20Threats-The%20Case%20of%20Biotechnology%20-%20Harris.pdf>,
Accessed 6-23-19)//GH

As other studies have pointed out, governance of biological technology
is inherently difficult. First, most [**biological agents**, such as
bacteria and viruses, are living organisms that **replicate,** so
policies that focus on inventory controls and accountability, especially
monitoring the quantity of materials being stored, are problematic, as
small seed stocks can later be used to produce large amounts of
biological agent. Most biological agents can also be **found in
nature**]{.underline}---in diseased soil or animals in the case of
pathogens and in other living organisms in the case of toxins. While
technical proficiency is required to obtain biological materials from
these natural sources, the fact that it can be done means that [policies
aimed at controlling access to dangerous pathogens or toxins can also be
evaded.]{.underline}

Second, [advances in science and technology are increasing the number of
**biological agents** of potential **concern,** **expanding** the types
of **equipment relevant to** their **development** and production, and
broadening the range of facilities in which work with biological agents
is occurring.]{.underline} During the Cold War, fewer than two dozen
biological agents were developed and accepted into national biological
weapons programs. However, [advances in genetic sequencing and in
synthetic biology are now making it **possible to create** an **almost
unlimited number of modified organisms**, some of which may be more
dangerous than existing biological agents, harder to detect, or capable
of evading existing therapeutics.]{.underline}

Until a decade ago, efforts to control the acquisition of equipment that
could be used to make biological agents focused on items such as high
containment facilities, fermenters, specialized separators and
filtration equipment, and aerosol test chambers, most of which were
available in a relatively small number of countries. Today[, modified
organisms are being created more quickly and cheaply using sophisticated
gene synthesis machines and reagents that are widely available. This
work is being carried out in many countries and in diverse settings---in
academic institutions, in industry and other private sector facilities,
in government laboratories, and, in some cases, at sites where amateur
scientists work without any institutional affiliation.]{.underline}

Third, [governance of biological technology must also grapple with
**intangible technology**]{.underline}---specifically, information or
knowledge. This includes, for example, [technical data necessary for the
development or **production of biological agents**]{.underline}; it also
[includes the DNA sequence databases and design software available on
the Internet that are central to the synthesis of modified or novel
agents]{.underline}. And it [includes the methods and results of
research that are disseminated in multiple ways---in conversations among
scientists, in email exchanges, in posters or presentations at
scientific conferences, and in peer-reviewed publications]{.underline}

Finally, each of these items---[**the biological materials, equipment,
and related information**---is used for legitimate purposes but can also
**cause harm**, either accidentally or deliberately.]{.underline}
[Pathogens being studied for human or animal vaccines can escape from
laboratories and sicken those they were designed to
protect.]{.underline} [Equipment used to understand the underlying
biological properties of existing pathogens can also be directed toward
enhancing the transmissibility or virulence of those pathogens for
hostile applications.]{.underline} [**Information on** the synthesis of
an extinct pathogen like **the 1918 Spanish flu** virus can be used to
bolster disease surveillance as well as to **resurrect** and disseminate
this once-lethal threat. These characteristics have had a profound
impact on efforts at every level to govern dual-use biological
technology.]{.underline}

#### Specific technology has caused human rights abuses in other countries

[It is no secret that **technology companies have greased the wheels for
human rights abuses** around the world backed by a global web of private
sector support and investment that has yielded significant financial
returns.]{.underline} In April 2018, Citizen Lab published research
analyzing the use of Internet filtering technology in ten countries of
interest: Afghanistan, Bahrain, India, Kuwait, Pakistan, Qatar, Somalia,
Sudan, United Arab Emirates, and Yemen. In these countries[, technology
produced by a company called Netsweeper is implemented by
national-level, consumer-facing Internet Service Providers (ISPs) to
filter online content.]{.underline} [Choices made by Netsweeper have a
significant impact on the types of websites that users in a given
country can ultimately access.]{.underline}

Citizen Lab researchers demonstrated through a variety of technical
methods that Netsweeper's technology [facilitates the **blocking of
digital speech protected by international human rights
law**]{.underline}---[from religious content in Bahrain and political
campaigns in the UAE to media websites in Yemen. News concerning
Rohingya refugees was censored, information about violence against
national religious minority populations blocked]{.underline}, and
websites---from the World Health Organization to the Christian Science
Monitor---were miscategorized as "Pornography" using Netsweeper's
filtering tools. Pre-set categories curated by Netsweeper itself
(including an "Alternative Lifestyles" category) also [facilitated the
miscategorization and censorship of content from LGBTQ2+ civil rights
and advocacy organizations]{.underline}, [HIV/AIDS health resources, and
media and cultural groups]{.underline}. Netsweeper's filtering system
can even be configured so that every website originating from an entire
specified country can be blocked all at once.

Citizen Lab concluded that these uses of Netsweeper's technology were
likely contrary to international human rights law. [They appeared to
constitute impermissible restrictions on, among other rights, freedom of
opinion and expression, minority rights, and protections against
discrimination enshrined in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights
and the International Covenant on Civil and Political
Rights.]{.underline}

[For the US economy as a whole, arms sales to Saudi Arabia are
insignificant. Military equipment made up 18 per cent of US exports to
Saudi Arabia last year, but just **0.13 per cent of total worldwide
exports**, according to official data.]{.underline} The two countries
announced last year that the kingdom would buy \$110bn of US arms in the
coming years, and Mr Trump has suggested that these exports would
support up to 500,000 jobs, but he has not given any source for that
estimate, which has been greeted sceptically by analysts. [Most of the
workforce in the US defence industry of roughly 1m is producing
equipment for the federal government, which had a military procurement
budget of \$134bn in the past fiscal year alone, more than **40 times
the value** of exports to Saudi Arabia that year.]{.underline}

significantly more job opportunities for Saudis than for

funds away from better economic growth opportunities. Investments into
military jobs are often [less
effective](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/saudi-arabia-is-the-top-buyer-of-u-s-weapons/)

it up: [by increasing military spending, America pays an economic
opportunity cost that sacrifices the chance to fund programs that are
better at job creation.]{.underline} [These sectors create many more
jobs than defense spending does and can generate better value for the
overall economy. If increasing job opportunities and expanding the
American economy is the priority, then, military contracts are far from
the most effective solution.]{.underline}

[Defense contractors are economically-driven corporations that seek
higher profits. To avoid the political backlash of Saudi arms sales in
their pursuits, contractors tend to claim that they are both helping the
American economy and assisting the US government's Saudi
relations.]{.underline} Lockheed Martin alone will
[acquire](https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2018/10/25/defense-contractors-stand-with-white-house-saudi-arms-sales/?utm_term=.f14799a8b3b6)
about \$900 million from Saudi sales in 2020 and an additional \$450
million contract if Saudi Arabia decides to deploy an American ballistic
missile defense system. Contractors like Lockheed Martin are increasing
revenue streams at the expense of millions of lives in Yemen. [**The
United States should not continue to prioritize defense contractor
business opportunities over its capability to mitigate the humanitarian
crisis in Yemen** and the continuously dire implications of Saudi Arabia
weapons purchases.]{.underline}

Ending the arms sales will also lift the veil on the Trump
Administration's disingenuous economic justifications for politically
expedient Saudi relations. The Trump Administration has long used
economic arguments to cover for their political and military desires.
[However, the arms sales to Saudi Arabia transcend economics. By
maintaining Saudi arms sales, the United States is
[declining](https://duckofminerva.com/2018/10/with-arms-sales-its-not-just-the-economy-stupid.html)
to hold countries accountable in exchange for the comfortable benefits
offered by the status quo]{.underline}. The administration has attempted
to simplify the arms sales issue to make the controversy appear more
palatable. [In reality, the arms sales are diverting American dollars to
a sector that is relatively **ineffective at job development**,
implicitly **condoning human rights abuses** that stem from those sales
and **harming American foreign policy** itself.]{.underline}

tacitly endorsing Saudi actions. Congress should, at the very least,
suspend arms sales to Saudi Arabia. The State Department approved [\$1
billion](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2018/03/approves-proposed-1bn-arms-sale-saudi-arabia-180323090745361.html)
worth of sales to the kingdom in March -- delaying the transfer of TOW
anti-tank missiles would be one clear way to signal US displeasure with
Saudi Arabia. Otherwise, why should Saudi Arabia cooperate with
investigations into the disappearance of Khashoggi, or modify its policy
in Yemen? In the realm of international politics, talk is cheap;
[actions
matter](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0022002797041001004?casa_token=oN5x9J2lJboAAAAA:cqoTBxWei6igIszju_BgXs-KjVFjLj3P4DRLDsj6TnRQEd3AOx_Wd-MTbNwr9duGKyR32jV5T0w).
**Cutting off arms sales or switching suppliers is one way states can
signal their dissatisfaction with partners**, as Turkey so clearly did
by purchasing the S-400. **The political stakes of arms sales are high**
-- and it is **crucial that policymakers consider that political
significance in their arms sales decision calculus** along with economic
and military considerations.]{.underline}

### Link Turn: Tech Transfer

#### Arms sales boost foreign militaries

**Hartung and Arabia, 19**. William Hartung is the director of the Arms
and Security Project at the Center for International Policy. Christina
Arabia is the Director of the Security Assistance Monitor (SAM) at the
Center for International Policy. "Trends in Major U.S. Arms Sales in
2018: The Trump Record - Rhetoric Versus Reality." (4/4/19).
https://securityassistance.org/sites/default/files/USArmsTrends2018_Report_190404_letter.pdf(//JTR)

One of the Trump administration's primary rationales for its efforts to
expand U.S. arms sales is the assertion that weapons exports create
large numbers of jobs in the United States. This claim does not hold up
to scrutiny.13

[For example, the Trump administration has sharply increased the number
of deals in which **foreign nations produce U.S.-developed weaponry** in
their countries under licensing and coproduction agreements. These deals
support production overseas, as well as **helping potential competitors
build up their own defense industries**. The number and value of
licenses granted to manufacturing U.S. weapons and weapons components
overseas nearly doubled from 2017 to 2018.]{.underline} In 2017 there
were 19 manufacturing licenses granted, valued at \$12.6 billion. In
2018 those figures jumped to 40 licenses granted, valued at \$19.8
billion. [The dollar value of licensing and manufacturing deals in 2018
accounted for over **25% of all U.S. arms offers** in that year, an
indication of the growing number of arms offers that involve overseas
production.]{.underline}

#### Arms sales are ineffective and create offsets that lead to technology transfer and theft -- hurt competitiveness of domestic industry and neutralize any benefits.

**ASMP 01** {The Arms Sales Monitoring Project is conducted by the
Federation of American Scientists, "Offsets: The Industrial, Employment
and Security Costs of Arms Exports," *FAS*,
<https://fas.org/asmp/campaigns/offset.html>, Published 11/01, Accessed
6/21/19} //RG

One of the most politically powerful claims supporting U.S. arms trading
today is that weapons exports sustain American jobs. But [the employment
benefits of arms exports are diluted, and **may be negated**, by
seldom-discussed side deals known as \"offsets.\"]{.underline} These
agreements require a supplier to direct some benefits. -usually work or
technology. -back to the purchaser as a condition of the sale.

Shrinking military budgets have reduced the demand for military
equipment, creating a buyer\'s market. This [increased international
competition allows customers to extract very favorable deals from
suppliers]{.underline}. Former Assistant Secretary of Commerce for
Export Administration R. Roger Majak testified before Congress in 1999,
\"It is a buyer\'s market for defense systems, and weapon sellers in
France, Britain, and the United States are confronted with
ever-increasing offset demands.\"

Offsets come in two forms. [Through \"direct\" offsets, the purchaser
receives work or tech]{.underline}nology [directly related to the
weapons sale]{.underline}, typically by producing the weapon system or
its components under license. [\"Indirect\" offsets involve barter and
countertrade deals, investment in the buying country, or the transfer of
technology unrelated to the weapons being sold. Both types of offsets
send work overseas, but direct offsets also raise serious security
concerns, as they assist the development of foreign arms
industries.]{.underline}

The 2001 [report]{.underline} produced by the Presidential Commission on
Offsets in International Trade (created by the Defense Offsets
Disclosure Act of 1999) [concluded that the average offset]{.underline}
requirement for 1998 [was 57.9% of the value of the
contract;]{.underline} this rate represented a slight increase over the
figures from the previous five years. The quantifiable effect of direct
[offset transactions for 1993-1998 \"supplanted \$2.3 billion in U.S.
work or 25,300 work-years.\"]{.underline} The report concluded that
while quantitative levels of offsets have remained relatively steady,
there has been a qualitative increase in the negotiated transactions.
These qualitative increases refer to [the transfer of]{.underline} often
[sensitive technologies]{.underline} to foreign defense industries,
which [**improve the competitiveness of foreign firms** and
rarely]{.underline} (only in 4% of the cases) [result in the transfer of
technology back to the U.S.]{.underline} Furthermore, Ann
[Markusen]{.underline}, a member of the Presidential Commission on
Offsets, [concluded that although \"the U]{.underline}nited
[S]{.underline}tates [has one of the strongest licensing regimes in the
world, \...enforcement is inadequate.\"]{.underline} Thus these
[qualitatively high demands for offsets and the resulting technology
transfer **increase potential threats to U.S. national security, and
pose real threats to U.S. jobs**.]{.underline}

The report claims that theoretically if offsets were not offered, there
would be a net loss of profits which would have a detrimental impact on
U.S. jobs. However actual figures speak volumes. William Hartung in his
report \"Welfare for Arms Dealers\" reported that \"Today, thanks to
these offsets, there are twice as many workers employed building the
F-16 in Ankara, Turkey (2,000), as there are at Lockheed Martin\'s
principle F-16 plant in Fort Worth, Texas (1,155).\" Sending jobs abroad
reduce labor costs for manufacturers, but it translates into the loss of
American jobs.

### R&D Impact Turn\--Killer Robots

#### Collapsing R&D good, stops the development and proliferation of Terminator style Killer Robots

**The Editors of Scientific American, 19.** Scientific American is the
award-winning authoritative source for the science discoveries and
technology innovations that matter. Scientific American, the longest
continuously published magazine in the U.S., has been bringing its
readers unique insights about developments in science and technology for
more than 170 years. "Don't Let Robots Pull the Trigger." (3/1/19).
https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/dont-let-robots-pull-the-trigger/?redirect=1(//JTR)

[**The killer machines are coming**. Robotic weapons that target and
destroy without human supervision are poised to start a revolution in
warfare comparable to the invention of gunpowder or the atomic bomb. The
prospect poses a dire threat to civilians]{.underline}---and could lead
to some of the bleakest scenarios in which artificial intelligence runs
amok. A prohibition on killer robots, akin to bans on chemical and
biological weapons, is badly needed. But some major military powers
oppose it.

[The robots are no technophobic fantasy]{.underline}. In July 2017, for
example, Russia\'s Kalashnikov Group announced that it had begun
development of a camera-equipped 7.62-millimeter machine gun that uses a
neural network to make "shoot/no-shoot" decisions. An entire generation
of self-controlled armaments, including drones, ships and tanks, is
edging toward varying levels of autonomous operation. [The **U.S.
appears to hold a lead in R&D** on autonomous systems---with \$18
billion slated for investment from 2016 to 2020.]{.underline} But other
countries with substantial arms industries are also making their own
investments.

[Military planners contend that "lethal autonomous weapons systems"---a
more anodyne term---could, in theory, bring a detached precision to war
fighting.]{.underline} Such automatons could diminish the need for
troops and reduce casualties by leaving the machines to battle it out.
[Yet control by algorithm can potentially morph into "**out of
control**." Existing AI cannot deduce the intentions of others or make
critical decisions by generalizing from past experience in the chaos of
war]{.underline}. The inability to read behavioral subtleties to
distinguish civilian from combatant or friend versus foe should call
into question whether AIs should replace GIs in a foreseeable future
mission. [A killer robot of any kind would be a trained assassin, **not
unlike Arnold Schwarzenegger in The Terminator.** After the battle is
done, moreover, who would be held responsible]{.underline} when a
machine does the killing? The robot? Its owner? Its maker?

With all these drawbacks, [a fully autonomous robot fashioned using
near-term technology could create a novel threat wielded by smaller
nations or **terrorists** with scant expertise or financial resources.
Swarms of tiny, weaponized drones, perhaps even made using 3-D printers,
could wreak havoc in densely populated areas. **Prototypes are already
being tested**: the U.S. Department of Defense demonstrated a
nonweaponized swarm of more than 100 micro drones in 2016]{.underline}.
Stuart Russell of the University of California, Berkeley, a prominent
figure in AI research, has suggested that "[antipersonnel micro robots"
deployed by just a single individual could kill many thousands and
constitute a **potential weapon of mass destruction.**]{.underline}

### No Link - Econ

#### Arms sales aren't key to the economy

**Caverley, 18**. Jonathan Caverley is Associate Professor of Strategy
in the Strategic & Operational Research Department of the Naval War
College's Center for Naval Warfare Studies and a research scientist in
political science at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. (4/6/18)
"AMERICA'S ARMS SALES POLICY: SECURITY ABROAD, NOT JOBS AT HOME."
https://warontherocks.com/2018/04/americas-arms-sales-policy-security-abroad-not-jobs-at-home/(//JTR)

[Even if the Trump administration boosts sales against such headwinds,
this will not create many additional jobs. Arms exports are a
surprisingly inefficient means of employing people at home.]{.underline}

[Using census data, the Commerce Department estimates that a billion
dollars of defense exports would "create or sustain" 3,918 jobs,
considerably fewer than the 5,700 jobs per billion created by increased
US exports more broadly.]{.underline} Doubling the United States' annual
arms exports to \$40 billion, a highly unrealistic goal, would thus
create fewer than 80,000 new jobs. [There are other industries the
United States can promote that will have larger effects on
jobs.]{.underline}

One reason defense exports appear to be inefficient employment
generators is that [states that spend their own money on buying American
weapons also care about "jobs, jobs, jobs" for their own people, as well
as supporting their own aspirational defense industries. Most countries
require "offsets," mandating that a percentage of any arms deal (often
50 to 100 percent) must be re-invested in the importing state's
economy.]{.underline} Between 2013 and 2015, these offsets, had the work
been performed in the United States, would have created or sustained
over 46,000 jobs[. In publicizing a recent Saudi deal for 150 S-70 Black
Hawk utility helicopters at roughly \$6 billion, Lockheed Martin
predicted that it would "support" 900 jobs. But half those jobs would be
in Saudi Arabia.]{.underline}

Yet another reason that arms exports are an inefficient employment
mechanism: [Any additional U.S. market share is likely to be heavily
subsidized]{.underline}. In 2016, the United States spent \$10 billion
buying weapons for other countries, roughly 10 percent of the entire
global arms export market, equivalent to Singapore's or Algeria's
defense budget. Moreover, over the past six years, the Defense
Department waived another \$16 billion in normally mandatory fees for
Foreign Military Sales --- including \$3.5 billion for a \$15 billion
Saudi agreement --- largely to close deals that may have gone to other
suppliers.

[In short, when it comes to boosting the domestic economy, arms sales
contain relatively little juice. And, as we shall see, it may not be
worth the squeeze.]{.underline}

#### Cutting arms sales won't hurt the economy

**Lam, 19**. Sophia Lam is an opinion writer for The Gate at the
University of Chicago. "Ending US Arms Sales to Saudi Arabia." (4/9/19)
http://uchicagogate.com/articles/2019/4/9/ending-us-arms-sales-saudi-arabia/(//JTR)

[Grand claims about the importance of arms sales to maintaining American
jobs and boosting the domestic economy are often exaggerated so that
private defense companies can keep deals that generate enormous profit.
Private sector defense workers only make up **about 0.5 percent of the
total US labor force** and almost none of them depend specifically on
arms sales to Saudi Arabia for their livelihood. Even if the deals
ended, companies such as Lockheed Martin and Boeing would only lose
about 2 percent of revenue]{.underline}. In fact, these arms deals
create significantly more job opportunities for Saudis than for
Americans. Empirically, Trump's plan will create nearly ten thousand
jobs in Saudi ports but only five hundred US jobs overall.

US arms sales to Saudi Arabia have hurt the US economy by diverting
funds away from better economic growth opportunities. [Investments into
military jobs are often **less effective** than federal spending on
education, healthcare, or infrastructur]{.underline}e. Professor Heidi
Garrett-Peltier of Brown University sums it up: by increasing military
spending, America pays an economic opportunity cost that sacrifices the
chance to fund programs that are better at job creation. [These sectors
create many more jobs than defense spending does and can generate better
value for the overall economy. If increasing job opportunities and
expanding the American economy is the priority, then, military contracts
are **far from the most effective solution.**]{.underline}

#### American taxpayers are not benefitting from arms sales, they are having to pay for them because of waivers and added incentives

**Abramson 18** (Jeff Abramson,  is a non-resident senior fellow for
arms control and conventional arms transfers at the Arms Control
Association April 2018, \"Trump Touts Saudi Arms Sales,\" No
Publication,
<https://www.armscontrol.org/act/2018-04/news/trump-touts-saudi-arms-sales>,
Accessed 6-19-19)//GH

[Further, some U.S. lawmakers are calling into question the economic
logic of waivers to Saudi Arabia that would reduce the price it pays for
the \$15 billion Terminal High Altitude Area Defense system notified in
October 2017, the single-largest notification of the year. Bloomberg
reported on March 21 that the Saudis received what amounts to a \$3.5
billion price cut through waivers from a U.S. law requiring foreign
purchasers of U.S. weapons to pay part of the Defense Department's costs
in developing them.]{.underline}

Such waivers are now relatively commonplace, according to a Government
Accountability Office report in January 2018; but [Bloomberg quoted
House Armed Services Committee member Jackie Speier (D-Calif.) saying,
"**American taxpayers are footing the bill for billions of dollars for
researching and developing the weapons we sell to foreign
governments."**]{.underline}

###  A2: Skilled Labor Key

#### Low-skilled labor key to the economy

**Guarino, 17**. Professor Guarino's professional career has been deeply
involved in the financial services industry with such corporations as
TIAA-CREF, Met Life, and The Bank of New York Mellon. (9/1/17). "Labor
shortage in the United States becoming an increasingly dire issue."
<https://globalriskinsights.com/2017/09/labor-shortage-united-states-dire-issue/>(//JTR)

If the situation regarding lack of skilled workers in the American
workforce is bad, [the outlook regarding unskilled workers is probably
even worse. Unskilled workers are those who have no formal
training]{.underline} but are the farm workers, low-skilled factory
workers, landscapers, construction workers, and others in labor
intensive jobs. They are the ones who pick the fruits and vegetables
Americans eat, clean off the tables at restaurants and diners, and cut
the lawns of office campuses and homes across the United States. Trump
is trying to put forth legislation to have them deported since many of
them are undocumented. Yet the problem is this: who will perform their
work when they are gone?

In 2011, there were 6,500 farm jobs advertised in North Carolina state
employment agencies, with 265 American workers applying for the
positions. Of those, 7 workers made it through the harvest season. Only
7 Americans completed the backbreaking, exhausting work that unskilled
workers, who are usually immigrants, perform at low pay.

[Farms across the United States are in desperate need of workers to pick
the crops that ultimately reach American tables]{.underline}. For
example, Limoneira, one of the largest lemon producers in America, is
[experiencing a severe labor shortage even with new worker benefits,
increased pay, and vastly improved living conditions]{.underline}.
According to New American Economy (NEA), an immigration reform advocacy
group, it is estimated that from 2002 to 2014[, the workforce shrank
approximately 20 percent and that farm labor shortages was responsible
for \$3 billion in lost revenues in the same time period]{.underline}.
[The unskilled worker shortage in the farming industry has caused
farmers to allow fruit and vegetables to rot in the fields and
eventually be plowed under. The long-term ramification is that since
there are no workers to cultivate these crops, there may be eventual
price increases for fruits and vegetables for American
consumers.]{.underline}

The key reason for this lack of unskilled workers is the decrease in
immigration from Mexico and other parts of Latin America. While Trump is
calling for the building of a wall between the United States and Mexico,
the border should really be thrown wide open since there is a projected
huge shortage of unskilled workers. Rather than restricting visas issued
to foreign workers, more should be given, and quickly. This means that
the H-2A visa program must be greatly expanded. The H-2A visa program,
instituted in 1986, allows farmers to acquire labor by hiring foreign
guest-workers temporarily. The program has seen visas increase from
55,000 in 2011 to 134,000 in 2016. While Trump encourages employers to
"hire American" the agriculture industry cannot find enough workers to
pick crops or prune vines at wineries.

More workers needed or else. . .

[The bottom line is that America needs more workers or else its economy
will suffer. The Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) reported that the
United States will need 3 million more workers in the next ten years to
fill low-skilled jobs so that the country will achieve economic
growth.]{.underline} The problem is that the total number of workers
entering the labor force at all skill levels, between the ages of 25 and
54, will be 1.7 million. [If this does in fact occur, then the United
States will not see 2 per cent economic growth for many decades to
come.]{.underline}

### No Link -- Arms Sales not key - Jobs

#### Arms sales two tenths of 1% of employment

**Hartung and Arabia, 19**. William Hartung is the director of the Arms
and Security Project at the Center for International Policy. Christina
Arabia is the Director of the Security Assistance Monitor (SAM) at the
Center for International Policy. "Trends in Major U.S. Arms Sales in
2018: The Trump Record - Rhetoric Versus Reality." (4/4/19).
https://securityassistance.org/sites/default/files/USArmsTrends2018_Report_190404_letter.pdf(//JTR)

[One of the Trump administration's primary rationales for its efforts to
expand U.S. arms sales is the assertion that weapons exports create
large numbers of jobs in the United States. This claim does not hold up
to scrutiny]{.underline}.13

For example, [the Trump administration has sharply increased the number
of deals in which foreign nations produce U.S.-developed weaponry in
their countries]{.underline} under licensing and coproduction
agreements. [**These deals support production overseas, as well as
helping potential competitors build up their own defense
industrie**s]{.underline}. The number and value of licenses granted to
manufacturing U.S. weapons and weapons components overseas nearly
doubled from 2017 to 2018. In 2017 there were 19 manufacturing licenses
granted, valued at \$12.6 billion. In 2018 those figures jumped to 40
licenses granted, valued at \$19.8 billion. The dollar value of
licensing and manufacturing deals in 2018 accounted for over 25% of all
U.S. arms offers in that year, an indication of the growing number of
arms offers that involve overseas production.

A case in point regarding the administration's exaggerated claims of
arms sales-related jobs is Saudi Arabia, where President Trump has
claimed that there are hundreds of thousands of U.S. jobs tied to arms
sales to that nation. He has used this argument in opposing a reduction
in U.S. sales to the Saudi regime in response to its murder of
U.S.-resident journalist and Washington Post contributor Jamal Khashoggi
and Saudi Arabia's killing of civilians in its intervention in Yemen.
There are serious questions as to whether arms sales-related jobs should
be an adequate reason to arm repressive regimes. But putting that aside
for the moment, [President Trump's assertions on arms exports and jobs
**don't stand up to even minimal scrutiny**. Based on actual deliveries
of arms, which is the best measure of how much money is Security
Assistance Monitor Center For International Policy 12 April, 2019
actually flowing in any given year pursuant to current and past weapons
offers, U.S. jobs tied to Saudi arms deals likely numbered in the range
of 20,000 to 40,000 jobs in 2018]{.underline}, less than ten percent of
President Trump's claims of 500,000 jobs directly tied to U.S. arms
sales to the regime in Riyadh. A claim of one million jobs appeared to
involve both arms sales and other commercial offers, so is not included
in the above calculations.14

[U.S. arms sales more broadly also create far fewer U.S. jobs than is
commonly assumed. Deliveries under the Pentagon's Foreign Military Sales
program totaled \$27.4 billion, which by standard estimating procedures
would account for 190,000 jobs in the United States, in an economy that
employs over 155 million people. That would put the share of arms
exports in total U.S. employment at well under **two-tenths of one per
cent** of total U.S. employment.15 But this figure is likely an
overstatement, because many of the jobs associated with U.S. arms sales
are based overseas]{.underline} due to coproduction and offset
agreements, and many others may not be the equivalent of full-time
employment on products destined for foreign customers, as workers switch
between production for export and work on weapons purchased by the
Pentagon.

#### 110 billion-dollar arms deal only lead to 500 jobs

**Stone, 18**. Mike Stone is a Defense Industry Correspondent for
Reuters. (10/30/18) "Exclusive: Defense firms see only hundreds of new
U.S. jobs from Saudi mega deal."
<https://www.reuters.com/article/us-saudi-arms-jobs-exclusive/exclusive-defense-firms-see-only-hundreds-of-new-u-s-jobs-from-saudi-mega-deal-idUSKCN1N40DM>(//JTR)

[Interviews with people familiar with other major defense contractors'
plans and estimates reflect similar dynamic as Lockheed's and Raytheon's
plans - relatively minor additions to their U.S. workforce and more
significant build-up in Saudi Arabia.]{.underline}

Since Trump's trip to the Kingdom last year, little economic activity
has taken place beyond Lockheed's work on four frigates the Saudis have
ordered.

The order will yield nearly 10,000 jobs in the Saudi ports for
maintenance workers, [but only 500 new U.S. jobs will be created,
according to documents seen by Reuters.]{.underline}

Executives at the several of top U.S. defense companies say Riyadh had
wanted much of the military equipment as a way to both develop new
domestic industry and to create new jobs and local expertise as a part
of Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman's Vision 2030 initiative to wean the
country off oil dependency.

Saudi Arabia has set a goal of creating 40,000 defense industry jobs by
2030.

The arms package Trump announced in May 2017 came under renewed scrutiny
after the Oct. 2 killing of Washington Post columnist Jamal Khashoggi in
the Saudi consulate in Istanbul. The killing provoked international
outrage and both the administration and defense contractors have been
working to prevent a backlash that could imperil what Trump has called a
"tremendous order" and 500,000 jobs.

Industry executives have argued that without the Saudi package coming
through they would have fewer orders to fill, [but robust U.S. defense
budgets, which account for the majority of their sales, coupled with a
record backlog of orders suggest little risk that workers would face
layoffs if the Saudi sales package failed to materialize.]{.underline}

#### Arms sales aren't job creators

**Hiller, 17**. Patrick T. Hiller has a Ph.D. in Conflict Analysis and
Resolution from Nova Southeastern University and is the Vice President
of the Board of Directors at the International Peace Research

Defense Needs." (5/20/17).
https://worldbeyondwar.org/110-billion-myth-supporting-saudi-arabias-defense-needs/(//JTR)

[The myth of arms deals as job creators:]{.underline} The State
Department does not even try to hide that one of the objectives of the
Saudi arms deal is to create tens of thousands of new jobs in the United
States[. There are two flaws with this argument. First, Holden and
colleagues demonstrate that military spending is strongly correlated
with poorer economic growth and that it can actually hurt the economy. A
study found that defense spending creates far fewer jobs than spending
on health care, education, green economy or tax cuts.]{.underline}
Second, aren't we morally bankrupt when we even begin to accept the
possibility that exporting weapons of war is necessary to drive our
economy?

#### Arms sales from the US do not have the same economic benefits as manufacturers and the US would like to claim because of offsets

**Thrall and Cohen 19** (A. Trevor Thrall, Jordan Cohen, Trevor Thrall
is an associate professor at George Mason University. Jordan Cohen is a
Ph.D. student at GMU. 4-5-2019, \"The False Promises of Trump's Arms
Sales,\" Defense One,
<https://www.defenseone.com/ideas/2019/04/false-promises-trumps-arms-sales/156071/>,
Accessed 6-19-19 )[//GH]{.underline}

Unfortunately, Trump's promises about the benefits of arms sales are
mostly empty, while the dangers are all too real.

And though presidents tout export of arms as a good way to strengthen
allies, the truth is that [the United States doesn't just sell weapons
to responsible nations such as Italy, the United Kingdom, and Belgium.
Vast amounts of U.S. weapons are shipped to [risky
customers](https://www.cato.org/publications/policy-analysis/risky-business-role-arms-sales-us-foreign-policy):
fragile states like Turkey, nations embroiled in conflicts like Saudi
Arabia, and oppressive governments with horrendous human rights records
like Egypt, Bahrain, and the United Arab Emirates.]{.underline} Since
2001, the U.S.government has notified the public of arms sales totaling
over [\$560 billion to 167
countries](http://securityassistance.org/data/country/arms/country/2001/2018/Global/Government-to-Government).
Each of these sales adds a varying degree of risk to the United States
regarding potential blowback, entanglement, dispersion, and increasing
instability throughout the world.

[Finally, Trump's claims about the economic benefits of arms sales ring
the [hollowest of
all](https://www.thenation.com/article/pentagon-spending-is-a-poor-job-creator/).
For starters, not only won't arms sales create a million new American
jobs, **but a great number of the jobs created by arms sales will go to
citizens of the purchasing nations**]{.underline}. [As the Security
Assistance Monitor
[report](https://securityassistance.org/publication/trends-major-us-arms-sales-2018-trump-record-rhetoric-versus-reality)
notes, the number of licenses granted to weapons manufacturers outside
the United States doubled from 2017 to 2018. As a result, more than
one-quarter of all U.S. arms "sales" last year were deals to permit the
manufacturing of U.S.-designed weapons under license --- that is, they
created jobs in other nations instead of the United States.]{.underline}
The report also finds that the Trump administration has sharply
increased the number of deals in which foreign countries produce
U.S.-developed weaponry under coproduction agreements, further reducing
the number of U.S. jobs tied to arms sales.

[Weakening the economic rationale even further is the fact that in order
to seal major deals, **American defense contractors have to [offer
massive discounts](https://i/)**, or offsets, to the purchasing nations
in the form of coproduction arrangements or technology
transfer.]{.underline} In 2014, for example, these offsets equaled
roughly one-third of the value of total U.S. arms sales. [These offsets
mean not only that **American arms sales are less profitable** than they
appear on paper, but also that **they lead to fewer jobs** created in
the United States than many, including the president, would like to
think]{.underline}. Trump's big Saudi arms deal, for example, would
likely lead to somewhere between 20,000 and 40,000 jobs, or less than
two-tenths of one percent of the American labor market.

The unpleasant truth is that the underwhelming economic benefits cannot
justify Washington's love of arms sales. [Arms sales simply do not
benefit the U.S. economy nearly as much as Trump likes to claim.
Meanwhile, a large percentage of American arms sales goes to countries
with horrible human rights records, to nations where arms are at risk of
finding their way into the wrong hands, and to nations embroiled in
dangerous and destabilizing conflicts. Given this, it is long past time
to rethink American arms sales policy.]{.underline}

which in turn incent leaders to]{.underline} search for ways to [cut
defense expenditures]{.underline}. [(2) Economic crises]{.underline}
also [encourage strategic reassessment, so]{.underline} that [leaders
can argue to]{.underline} their peers and [their publics that defense
spending can be arrested without endangering the state]{.underline}.
[This can lead to threat deflation]{.underline}, where elites attempt to
downplay the seriousness of the threat posed by a former rival. [(3) If
a state faces multiple threats, economic crises provoke elites to
consider threat prioritization, a process that is postponed
during]{.underline} periods of [economic normalcy]{.underline}. [(4)
Economic crises increase the political and economic benefit from
international economic cooperation]{.underline}. [Leaders seek foreign
aid, enhanced trade, and increased investment from abroad
during]{.underline} periods of [economic trouble]{.underline}.
[This]{.underline} search [is]{.underline} made [easier if tensions are
reduced]{.underline} with historic rivals. [(5)]{.underline} Finally,
[during crises, elites]{.underline} are more prone to
[select]{.underline} [leaders]{.underline} who are [perceived as capable

[these mechanisms make it much more likely]{.underline} that [a leader
will prefer conciliatory policies]{.underline} compared to during
periods of economic normalcy. This section reviews this causal logic in
greater detail, while also providing historical examples that these
mechanisms recur in practice.

#### There are many red flags in the economy right now

**Long 6-19** (Heather Long is is an economics correspondent at the
Washington Post, 6-19-19, "Federal Reserve expresses concern about U.S.
economy and signals interest rate cuts are likely"
<https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2019/06/19/federal-reserve-expresses-concern-about-us-economy-signals-likely-interest-rate-cut-soon/?utm_term=.e562b1da9311>,
Accessed 6-21-19)//GH

[The Federal Reserve on Wednesday raised concerns the economy is slowing
and sent its strongest signal to date that it could act soon to cut
interest rates, a move that would plunge the central bank into unusual
territory.]{.underline}

[Business investment is slowing, uncertainty has increased and the U.S.
economy is growing at a "moderate" pace,]{.underline} the Fed
[said](https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/files/monetary20190619a1.pdf)
Wednesday in its official policy statement, [a notable downgrade from
last month, when the central bank characterized the economy as
"[solid](https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/economy/2019/05/01/3062ef44-6c23-11e9-a66d-a82d3f3d96d5_story.html?utm_term=.2d1505617032)."]{.underline}

The Fed did not cut rates Wednesday and did not specify exactly when it
would. But nearly half of Fed leaders now [predict rates will fall by
the end of the year]{.underline}, a significant change [from
March](https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2019/03/20/federal-reserve-cuts-growth-forecast-predicts-no-more-rate-hikes/?utm_term=.21313d3d1392),
when none of the 17 Fed policymakers anticipated a cut this year. Seven
of the 17 are forecasting two rate decreases by the end of 2019,
according to
[projections](https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/files/fomcprojtabl20190619.pdf)
also released Wednesday.

"The case for somewhat more accommodative policy has strengthened," Fed
Chair Jerome H. Powell said Wednesday. "It's really trade developments
and concerns about global growth that are on our minds. . . . Risks seem
to have grown.\"

The Fed's benchmark interest rates play a powerful role in shaping the
economy, by encouraging or discouraging the lending that often serves as
the lifeblood of business. Mortgages, credit cards, business loans and
virtually all other types of lending [are
affected](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2018/03/20/a-new-era-what-the-federal-reserves-interest-rate-hike-means-for-you/?utm_term=.79bf3564bdad)
by the Fed's decisions.

[The Fed is facing an unusual predicament. By many measures, the economy
is doing well, with unemployment and inflation low, so it should not
need stimulus from low rates. **But** there have **been [numerous red
flags
recently](https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/economy/trump-is-about-to-face-his-biggest-test-yet-on-the-economy/2019/06/17/ec9d00a6-911b-11e9-b570-6416efdc0803_story.html)**
that the economy could turn, particularly in [manufacturing
data](https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2019/06/19/steel-industry-begins-idle-plants-shows-signs-weakness-despite-trumps-support/?utm_term=.be84c7445852),
and the Fed is in the uncomfortable spot of trying to figure out whether
the head winds are strong enough to necessitate action.]{.underline}

[It is also a difficult moment because so much of the economy's path
could be dictated by political events,]{.underline} including a [meeting
later this
month](https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2019/06/18/trump-says-he-will-meet-with-chinas-xi-g-summit-amid-escalating-trade-war/)between
President Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping that could defuse trade
tensions that have grown more intense this year.

Meanwhile, [Trump has [repeatedly slammed the
Fed](https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2019/06/19/fed-meets-trumps-potential-next-pick-wants-see-lower-rates-fast-possible/?utm_term=.df0ad4d9ecc4)
for not cutting rates]{.underline}, though Powell reaffirmed Wednesday
he is not looking to respond to political criticism.

#### A recession is coming now, many economists agree

management firm.Noah Smith is a Bloomberg Opinion columnist. He was an
assistant professor of finance at Stony Brook University, and he blogs

<https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/a-slowdown-is-inevitable-but-a-recession/2019/04/04/0b3e4bc2-56df-11e9-aa83-504f086bf5d6_story.html?utm_term=.56f1317f6acb>

[Concerns that a **recession is coming** are rising, with a quarter of
all economists saying that a slump is possible in the next 12
months]{.underline}. The current U.S. expansion clearly is slowing as
the 10-year anniversary of the last recession approaches. But expansions
don't just end: Something has to serve as a trigger. Bloomberg Opinion
columnists Nir Kaissar and Noah Smith recently met online to debate.

Nir Kaissar: The R-word seems to be on everyone's mind these days. In a
few months, the current U.S. economic expansion will be the longest on
record. It's already three times longer than the average expansion since
1854, and twice the average since 1945, according to numbers compiled by
the National Bureau of Economic Research. No, booms don't die of old
age, but that doesn't appear to soothe anxiety that the U.S. is due for
a recession.

[Recent economic trends don't help]{.underline}. Yes, the economy is
growing, unemployment is low and consumer sentiment is high, but [some
**important numbers are pointing down.** The Federal Reserve Bank of
Atlanta estimates that real gross domestic product grew at an annual
rate of 2.1 percent in the first quarter, marking the second consecutive
quarter of subdued growth and down from 4.2 percent in the second
quarter of last year. That echoes the Institute for Supply Management's
manufacturing index, which fell to 55.3 in March from a
post-financial-crisis high of 60.8 in August.]{.underline}

[**Markets don't offer much reassurance**, either. The 10-year Treasury
yield has dropped to roughly 2.5 percent from 3.2 percent in November, a
sign that the bond market fears a slowdown. And parts of the yield curve
recently inverted]{.underline} --- that is, some long-term bond yields
dipped below short-term yields. [Inversions have historically preceded
recessions by a year or two.]{.underline}

Meanwhile, the stock market can't seem to make up its mind. There have
been six corrections since the financial crisis, defined as a decline of
10 percent or more in the Standard & Poor's 500 Index. Two of them came
in the past 15 months, and both were followed by sharp moves higher.

All of which raises the question: Is a recession looming or not?

Noah Smith: [**Signs of recession are certainly starting to mount**. In
addition to the ones you mentioned, I'd point to housing and trade.
Housing starts, which usually fall before a recession, have plateaued
for the past two years. Residential investment, which macroeconomist Ed
Leamer calls "by far the best early warning sign of an oncoming
recession," is slightly down from its peak in the second quarter of
2018. So this is another sign of U.S. economic weakness]{.underline}.
Meanwhile, if not for increased military spending, those GDP growth
numbers might look even worse.

[Global trade recently posted its **biggest three-month drop since
2009**. Chinese exports fell quite a bit in February. A global recession
driven by a slowdown in China **could easily spill over to the
U.S.**]{.underline}

#### While the economy may seem high, structural issues indicate a downturn looming

and Policy Priorities and author of \'The Reconnection Agenda: Reuniting

accessed 6-21-19)//GH

[Much has been made lately of the hot economy, a narrative driven
largely by a long run of strong jobs numbers. But this enthusiastic
story line is **ignoring a few disturbing structural problems** that
suggest that the economy is not as strong as those numbers
suggest.]{.underline} Underneath the hood, [problems persist, including
**earnings below what families need to get by, stark inequalities in
wealth and income, an increasingly jittery stock market, an affordable
housing shortage, damaged fiscal accounts and slower growth on the
horizon**.]{.underline}

**[Wages trend up but still too low]{.underline}**: The tight labor
market is no doubt lifting workers' wages, particularly at the bottom of
the wage scale as less-advantaged workers see their bargaining position
improved. [However, a few good years of rising wages doesn't make up for
the decades of real wage stagnation faced by many middle- and low-wage
workers. The result is that for many working families, their paychecks
fail to meet their basic needs.]{.underline}

[Consider a single parent with a couple of kids who is earning the
20th-percentile wage]{.underline} (20 percent earn less; 80 percent earn
more) and whose pay could rise to \$13 per hour by the end of this year,
or about \$26,000 per year, pretax. Subtracting payroll taxes and adding
tax credits for working parents could get her up to about \$30,000.
[That clears the poverty line, but it doesn't pay for decent housing,
child care, health care and transportation, at least not in most
cities]{.underline}. Family budget calculators show that child care for
two kids costs about \$11,000 per year in
[Ohio](http://livingwage.mit.edu/states/39), and more than twice that in
[New York](http://livingwage.mit.edu/states/36). Add housing and
health-care costs, and [even middle-wage earners with children have
trouble squaring their budgets with their salaries.]{.underline}

[**Economic insecurity**: This too-tight breathing room between what
many families earn and what it costs them to live has **created a
widespread sense of economic insecurity**,]{.underline} which shows up
clearly in recent
[analysis](https://www.federalreserve.gov/consumerscommunities/shed.htm)
of economic well-being by the Federal Reserve[. One-fifth of white
households and a third of black and Hispanic households grade their
financial conditions "just getting by" or worse. And just under half of
rural households grade their local economies to be "only fair" or
"poor."]{.underline}

The Fed's survey also looks at the share of adults who "would have
difficulty handling an emergency expense as small as \$400." [They find
that 39 percent of adults couldn't cover an emergency expense of that
amount with cash, savings or a credit-card charge that they could pay
off quickly]{.underline}. [For African American adults, that share is 60
percent.]{.underline} In other words, [well over half of black adults
are highly vulnerable to even a relatively mild economic
hit.]{.underline} (Economist Michael Strain is
[critical](https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2019-06-04/the-400-emergency-expense-story-is-wrong)
of this Fed data, but we think it's telling us something important.)

Though down from the years coming out of the crisis, [these numbers are
largely unchanged from 2017, suggesting that communities all across the
country, and especially communities of color, continue to face
entrenched barriers to getting ahead even in a hot national labor
market.]{.underline}

[**Surging inequality**: The situation looks very different at the high
end of the economic scale. Over the past decade, the nation's highest
earners (the 95th percentile) saw their wages grow at almost four times
the rate of those whose earnings put them in the middle of the pack (the
50th percentile). Even more
[remarkably](https://www.federalreserve.gov/releases/efa/efa-distributional-financial-accounts.htm),
the top 1 percent of households now hold 31 percent of the nation's
wealth (assets minus liabilities), or \$30 trillion, while the entire
bottom half of the nation's households hold only about 1 percent, or \$1
trillion.]{.underline} That comes to \$23 million per householdfor the
top 1 percent and \$18,000 in net worth per household for the bottom
half. And the Trump tax cut is exacerbating these divisions, with a
recent [analysis](https://itep.org/taxcreditproposals/) by the Institute
on Taxation and Economic Policy showing that in 2020, more than half of
the tax cut will go to the top 5 percent of households, with only 14
percent going to the bottom 60 percent.

**[Shortage of affordable housing]{.underline}**: [Compounding these
challenges is a deepening crisis in affordable housing for working
families. Supply constraints are making it increasingly hard to find an
affordable place to live anywhere near economic opportunity, forcing
more and more families to choose between forgoing a good job and paying
unaffordable rent.]{.underline}

[The percentage of housing stock available for rent or sale has fallen
sharply since the housing crash and is now as low as it has been in more
than 30 years]{.underline}. And it is [set to get worse, possibly much
worse. The current annual supply of new housing units is running an
estimated 300,000 below the trend for new housing demand.]{.underline}
The increasing shortfall of housing supply is pushing up house prices
and rents, particularly in areas that offer better jobs, education and
health care, as demand increasingly vastly outstrips supply. [This is
not only holding back a large number of working families; by reducing
labor mobility, it's also holding back the entire economy.]{.underline}

**[Tax stimulus proving expensive and fleeting:]{.underline}** The Trump
administration claimed that the tax cuts would pay for themselves by
jump-starting stronger and sustainable growth, but it [has not turned
out that way. In the absence of any meaningful boost in investment,
revenue has fallen to levels far below where it should be in an economy
closing in on full
[capacity](https://financialservices.house.gov/uploadedfiles/12.19.2018_jared_bernsteinl_testimony.pdf).
And in the absence of any spending cuts to offset this loss in revenue,
the tax cuts are putting us in a hole that will make it harder to
address the wide range of economic and social challenges that will
ultimately demand greater public investment.]{.underline}

The cuts did contribute to faster economic growth in 2018 and 2019,
adding close to a point to gross domestic product growth and pushing the
unemployment rate below 4 percent. However, [given the failure of the
cut to generate significant additional investment, it has offered more
of a sugar high than any meaningful improvement in the economy.
Virtually every economic forecast, except those of the White House,
projects its effect to fade this year, with GDP growth falling back to
about 2 percent next year.]{.underline}

**[Worrisome signs from the stock market:]{.underline}** While only
about one-third of households own stocks of any consequence, [the stock
market's performance can be a good indication of investors' expectations
about future growth and profitability. Investors tend to buy stocks when
they believe businesses will be able to sell more of what they produce
at a higher price, and they tend to sell them when they fear the
reverse, making **marketwide movements in the stock market a useful
metric for investor forecasting the health of the
economy**.]{.underline} With that in mind**[, investors appear to be
increasingly wary of what is to come]{.underline}**. While the market
stands roughly where it was when Trump signed his tax cut into law 18
months ago[, it has swung wildly in recent weeks, driven in large part
by concern over his escalating trade war.]{.underline}

[The dynamics we've described --- low wages, income and wealth
inequality, a shortage of affordable housing, increasingly nervous
investors --- all create head winds for growth]{.underline}. The
momentum from the deficit-financed tax cut has thus far proved strong
enough to overcome them, but that momentum is slowing, **[raising the
prospect of a stalled economy still struggling with a host of deep
structural problems.]{.underline}**

#### The economy is heading towards a recession -- Trade War

[Morgan Stanley has again issued a warning that president Donald Trump
is leading the **United States towards a recession** with his ramped-up
**trade war** against China.]{.underline}

In its newest warning made Tuesday, [Morgan Stanley said Trump's trade
war is putting U.S. corporate profits and economic growth at risk, and
cited a **slump in economic data** as an indicator of this outcome. It
also said the fortunes of Wall Street and the **economic outlook for the
United States as a whole is "deteriorating."**]{.underline}

["Recent data points suggest U.S. earnings and **economic risk is
greater** than most investors may think,"]{.underline} wrote chief U.S.
equity strategist Michael Wilson.

[[A slowdown in
both](https://www.cnbc.com/2019/05/28/morgan-stanley-says-economy-on-recession-watch-amid-bond-warning.html)
the manufacturing and services sector coupled with the inverted curve
for the benchmark 10-year Treasury yield means the **U.S. is now on a
"recession watch."**]{.underline}

"[The adjusted yield curve inverted last November and has remained in
negative territory ever since, surpassing the minimum time required for
a valid meaningful economic slowdown signal]{.underline}," wrote Wilson.
"It also suggests [the 'shot clock' started 6 months ago, putting us 'in
the zone' for a recession watch."]{.underline}

Wilson called attention to a recent survey by global financial data
provider IHS Markit revealing [U.S. manufacturing activity plunging to a
nine-year low in May.]{.underline} IHS Markit also uncovered a [notable
slowdown in the U.S. services sector, a vital tech-led growth area for
the economy.]{.underline}

Wilson estimates [many leading companies "might throw in the
towel]{.underline} on the second half rebound \--something we have been
expecting but we believe many investors are not."

[Wilson also warns investors might be caught in a "rolling bear market "
for the next several years. Many economists predict an anemic second
half of the year. Morgan Stanley economists have reduced their Q2 U.S.
GDP forecast to 0.6% from 1.0%.]{.underline}

["The April durable goods report was bad, particularly the details
relating to capital goods orders and shipments]{.underline}. Coming on
the heels of last week's crummy April retail sales report[, it suggests
**second quarter activity growth is sharply downshifting from the first
quarter pace,**]{.underline}" said Morgan Stanley economists.

On May 14, [Morgan Stanley predicted a recession if Trump pushed ahead
with recent threats to implement tariffs on Chinese imports that haven't
yet been hit with higher tariffs.]{.underline}

[The Trump administration boosted duties on [\$200 billion in
goods](https://ibtimes.com/us-china-trade-talks-tensions-escalate-trump-threatens-25-tariffs-200b-goods-2790049)]{.underline}
from China to 25% from 10% on May 17. China responded on May 20 with
promises to increase tariffs on \$60 billion in U.S. imports.

In retaliation, Trump threatened to raise taxes on the remaining \$300
billion worth of goods that China exports to the U.S. This means [the
U.S. will have taxed all of China's imports]{.underline}.

[If the tariffs on the \$300 billion
goods](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/trumps-threatened-tariffs-would-likely-lead-to-an-economic-recession-says-morgan-stanleys-wilson-2019-05-13)
is implemented[, the potential cost of these duties could represent a
decline of 1% to 1.5% in the S&P 500,]{.underline} [and a 0.84%
reduction in companies' net income]{.underline}, said Morgan Stanley.

Worse, "[the demand destruction and ailing confidence increase the
potential impact well beyond just higher costs, and **would likely lead
to an economic recession** in our view]{.underline}," wrote Mike Wilson,
Morgan Stanley's chief investment officer, in a note to clients on May
20.
