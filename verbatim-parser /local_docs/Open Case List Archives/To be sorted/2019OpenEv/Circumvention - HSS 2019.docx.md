# Circumvention

### Notes

#### Non-FMS SCP

<https://www.ustranscom.mil/dtr/part-ii/dtr_part_ii_toc.pdf>

**[Non-FMS SCP includes both grant programs, such as the Presidential
Drawdowns and International Military Education and Training Programs,
and specially funded Building Partner Capacity programs, such as
Counter-Narcotics programs and National Defense Authorization Act
programs.]{.underline}** Shipments made under a Building Partner
Capacity program are processed by shippers in the same way as FMS
program shipments. MILSTRIP is also used to release and route Building
Partner Capacity SCP shipments. The procedures for transporting material
under Building Partner Capacity Grant Program SCP differ from FMS/
Building Partner Capacity procedures in the following ways:

This applies to the Presidential Drawdown argument.

For each module, focus on the "motive" part -- some of these cards are
just about how alternate programs exist, not how Trump/Congress would
shift to them. Winning that is important.

### 1NC -- Circumvention -- Security Assistance

While military force is often the preferred method in COIN, **[an
emphasis on [non-kinetic means]{.mark} for DoD [could provide better
results at a]{.mark} much [lower cost]{.mark}]{.underline}**. The
defense budget for fiscal year (FY) 2017 brought major reforms to
security assistance authorities and organizations, a problem that had
previously plagued those initiatives. **[[Security assistance
programs]{.mark} [allow]{.mark} small teams of DoD [personnel]{.mark}
[to train]{.mark} [partner forces in]{.mark} basic [military
tactics]{.mark} [and provide weapons training]{.mark}]{.underline}**
\[14\]. DoD spending as part of the foreign assistance budget totaled
out to \$6.4 billion spent worldwide in FY 2018, which includes these
programs. Total spending for the foreign assistance budget in FY 2018
was \$17.6 billion \[15\]. In comparison, the war in Afghanistan alone
cost \$45 billion in 2018, a little under half the \$100 billion spent
every year during the war's height between 2010-2012\[16\]. **[DoD
[training]{.mark} with partner militaries [is]{.mark} relatively
[inexpensive]{.mark} when compared with other DoD programs and
deployments, [and "builds relationships with friendly foreign forces,
improves interoperability]{.mark} with [and]{.mark} indirectly
[contributes]{.mark} [to]{.mark} [building]{.mark} the
[capability]{.mark} [of]{.mark} key [allies]{.mark} through exposure to
United States tactics, techniques, and
procedures...]{.underline}**\[17\]" Capacity-building conducted by
specially trained units could better enhance opportunities for partner
forces to provide security in COIN conflict environments. The Army's
SFAB model appears to be a comprehensive training force, standing in
contrast to the ad hoc approach used throughout Operations Enduring
Freedom and Iraqi Freedom. **[[This]{.mark} option [could]{.mark}
[alleviate]{.mark} [pressure on SOF]{.mark} to manage similar missions
on a global scale that would continue to strain overworked equipment and
personnel.]{.underline}**

#### Aff gets circumvented -- security assistance

**McInnis and Lucas 15** (Kathleen McInnis is an analyst in
international security, Nathan Lucas is a section research manager,
"What Is 'Building Partner Capacity?' Issues for Congress",
Congressional Research Service, 12-18-15, Accessed on 7-22-19,
<https://fas.org/sgp/crs/natsec/R44313.pdf>, DP)

**[[Security assistance]{.mark}, by contrast, [is defined as]{.mark} a
group of [programs]{.mark} authorized by Title 22 of the U.S. Code, as
amended, [or]{.mark} other [related statutes by which the U]{.mark}nited
[S]{.mark}tates [provides defense articles, military training,
and]{.mark} other [defense-related services by grant, loan, credit, cash
sales, or lease]{.mark}, in furtherance of national policies and
objectives.17]{.underline}**

**[Security assistance is a subset of security cooperation, 18 and BPC,
in its current formulation, appears to be associated with those security
cooperation and assistance activities designed to enable weakened or
fragile states to manage their own security challenges.]{.underline}**
Although all DOD aspects of security assistance programs are
administered by DSCA, the agency is not responsible for the department's
broader strategy and non-programmatic elements of security cooperation
or building partner capacity.19

As with all federal agencies, DSCA allocates its resources according
only to the authorities Congress has provided. The authorities
associated with security cooperation and security assistance are often
described as a "patchwork" of authorities and programs, only some of
which are exclusively within DOD's purview. Others are either (1)
managed by the State Department, (2) managed by the State Department and
executed by DOD (such as Foreign Military Sales programs), or (3)
jointly managed by the State Department and DOD, requiring both
departments' concurrence to authorize specific activities. Table 2
depicts some of the key programs and authorities in the security
assistance toolkit, including from where each program derives its legal
authority.

Examining Table 2, one could make two observations. **[First,
[after]{.mark} the [9/11]{.mark} attacks, the number of [security
assistance]{.mark} programs [proliferated]{.mark}.]{.underline}** Of the
31 programs listed above 17 were created after 9/11, suggesting that the
United States government believed that its traditional, pre-9/11
security assistance portfolio was necessary but insufficient to meet the
challenges of an increasingly interdependent and complex world**[.
Second, the [majority]{.mark} of these programs established after 9/11
[were additional authorities given to the D]{.mark}epartment [o]{.mark}f
[D]{.mark}efense, suggesting that [DOD plays a greater role in security
cooperation today than]{.mark} the one it [historically]{.mark}
played.]{.underline}** **[The latter observation is borne out by the
current manifestations of BPC across the DOD's
activities.]{.underline}** Although the programs and authorities listed
above are the focus of most analysis and discussion with respect to BPC,
they do not capture the full extent of DOD's activities and expenditures
in this area. **[This is because [DOD has integrated BPC]{.mark}---in
its various guises and manifestations (security cooperation, assistance,
foreign internal defense, security force assistance, and so
on)---[across a wide range of]{.mark} its [operations and
activities]{.mark} (see "DOD Activities That Build Partner
Capacity").]{.underline}** In order to do so, different DOD components
utilize a variety of funding sources. For example, according to a 2013
RAND study, rather than using DSCAearmarked funds for specific
activities with partners, Most \[BPC\] programs are funded by other,
less narrow \[funding\] sources, such as operations and maintenance
funds. Examples include exercises overseen by the Chairman of the Joint
Chiefs of Staff, and military-to-military contacts, which are often (but
not always) funded by Traditional COCOM Activity Authority. In each of
these cases, DoD uses a specific authority to use its operations and
maintenance funds for a given security cooperation activity. In some
cases, these funds are then reimbursed, but more often than not, the
security cooperation activity comes at the expense of another defense
priority.20

**[In the U.S. foreign policy toolkit, [security
assistance]{.mark}]{.underline}** and arms transfers **[[have
become]{.mark} the [instruments]{.mark} of choice [for]{.mark} American
[diplomats]{.mark} [and soldiers]{.mark}]{.underline}**[. **[Grant
assistance]{.underline}**]{.mark} and weapons sales **[are treated as
Swiss Army Knives]{.underline}**, all-purpose tools appropriate for use
in virtually any scenario. According to the prevailing view in the U.S.
government, **[security assistance works wonders: it [builds the
capabilities of partner]{.mark} [countries]{.mark}, [provides
influence]{.mark} over their policies, and [guarantees access to]{.mark}
influential institutions and [personalities]{.mark} in capitals across
the globe]{.underline}**. If true, this would seem to more than justify
the \$48.7 billion the U.S. has spent on security assistance to the
Middle East over the past decade.

In reality, U.S. military assistance promises more than it delivers.
There is scant evidence outside of a few isolated cases that U.S.
material support to Middle Eastern countries has fulfilled any of these
purposes. Recipients of U.S. funding and weapons have largely failed to
make major strides in their capabilities and, in some instances, may
have even regressed.

Despite \$47 billion in U.S. military assistance over 40 years, **[the
Egyptian military has struggled mightily to contain an ISIS-affiliate
numbering no more than 1,200 militants]{.underline}**. **[[The Saudis
barely used]{.mark} their [American]{.mark}-made advanced combat
[aircraft]{.mark} in the U.S.-led anti-ISIS operation in Syria, and \$89
billion in [arms sales]{.mark} to the kingdom over the last 10 years
[has not prevented]{.mark} [Riyadh]{.mark} [from]{.mark} getting bogged
down in an increasingly costly [quagmire in Yemen]{.mark} with
U.S.-supplied weapons]{.underline}**. The U.S. has sold hundreds of
billions of dollars in military hardware to Persian Gulf countries and
yet collectively they are not capable of defending the free flow of oil
from the Gulf against a militarily weaker Iran without U.S. assistance.

#### Security assistance is super ambiguous -- ensures circumvention

However, as the Regionally Aligned Forces example demonstrates, in DOD's
view security cooperation, and by extension BPC, is much broader than
those programs DSCA manages. The green circle depicts the wide array of
programs, activities, and even force structure decisions designed to
support the overarching rationale of building partner capacity.
**[Essentially, DOD has infused BPC across its activities and
operations, not just in DSCA-managed programs and activities. [DOD does
not]{.mark} presently [capture the level of granularity]{.mark}
necessary [to identify the]{.mark} full scope of [expenditure on
BPC]{.mark} programs, particularly those represented in the green
circle. Thus, [identifying how much]{.mark} money [DOD]{.mark} actually
[spends on BPC]{.mark} activities [is nearly impossible]{.mark} at
present.]{.underline}**

The final component of the diagram is the grey shaded circle in the
background. This represents the use of building partner capacity as a
strategic rationale in its own right, and is used as a justification for
many of the activities captured in the other circles of the diagram.
**[As the diagram suggests, the term BPC is used to represent a variety
of different programs activities, as well as the intellectual rationale
for undertaking those activities. These [varying
definitions]{.mark}---alternately using "BPC" to describe ends, ways and
means---[add to the ambiguity]{.mark} surrounding BPC [and]{.mark}
therefore [compound]{.mark}ing the [oversight challenge]{.mark}
associated with these programs.]{.underline}**

#### Trump will use an emergency to continue sales -- empirics

The US plans to send billions of dollars in weapons to Middle Eastern
allies --- including Saudi Arabia --- by declaring an emergency that
experts say doesn't really exist.

Multiple [[reports detail that]{.underline}]{.mark} Trump
[[officials]{.mark} are [consider]{.mark}ing [using
a]{.mark}]{.underline} legal [[loophole]{.underline}]{.mark} within days
[[to export]{.underline}]{.mark} roughly [[\$7 billion in arms to Saudi
Arabia and the U]{.underline}]{.mark}nited [[A]{.underline}]{.mark}rab
[[E]{.underline}]{.mark}mirates, both of which have waged a brutal war
in Yemen against Houthi rebels for more than four years.

[[The idea]{.underline}]{.mark}, pushed by Secretary of State Mike
Pompeo and other top officials, [[would allow the
admin]{.underline}]{.mark}istration [[to circumvent]{.mark} Congress's
[authority to approve or reject]{.mark} weapons
[sales]{.mark}]{.underline}.

[[There is a provision]{.underline}]{.mark} in a [weapons export
law](https://legcounsel.house.gov/Comps/Arms%20Export%20Control%20Act.pdf)
[[allowing]{.mark} the [executive]{.mark} branch [to sell arms
without]{.mark} congressional [sign-off if "an emergency exists which
requires the]{.mark} proposed [sale in the]{.mark} national security
[interest of the]{.mark} [U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates]{.underline}."
Administrations rarely invoke it, [experts
say](https://twitter.com/maxbergmann/status/1131737512714678273), mainly
because of how controversial it is and the high bar required to claim a
dire situation exists.

War](https://csis-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/s3fs-public/legacy_files/files/publication/120720_Cordesman_LessonsIsraeliHezbollah.pdf),
but that was last time an administration took advantage of the loophole.

President Donald [[Trump]{.mark} likely [will claim that Saudi Arabia
and the UAE need]{.mark} new [munitions because]{.mark} they face
[[repeated
attacks](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2019/05/yemen-houthi-rebels-attack-saudi-najran-airport-190523140308211.html)
from Houthi]{.mark} rebels]{.underline}. However, the Yemen war has
raged since 2015, with the US supporting the Saudi-led coalition's side.
It's jarring now to say that an emergency exists after all this time,
especially when the US previously [sold
weapons](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/saudi-arabia-is-the-top-buyer-of-u-s-weapons/)
to the Saudis through the normal process.

Much of the difficulty lies in the fact **[that [civil wars]{.mark}
[are]{.mark} largely [fought with small arms]{.mark}, [which are]{.mark}
the most [difficult]{.mark} weapons [to
regulate]{.mark}]{.underline}**.27 In its arms control activities,
**[[the US has focused on]{.mark} preventing the transfer of
[w]{.mark}eapons of [m]{.mark}ass [d]{.mark}estruction to \'rogue
states\', [rather than]{.mark} on the [small]{.mark} [arms]{.mark}
market]{.underline}**, despite the fact that small arms have recently
proved to be collectively far more destructive to lives and property.
Over sixty states manufacture small arms and the market is highly
competitive. The glut of weapons available has steadily eroded the
convention that arms should only be transferred to legitimate
governments.28 Indeed, **[[profits from trafficking small arms]{.mark}
[increase]{.mark} further [with]{.mark} the imposition of [an
embargo]{.mark}: the tighter the embargo, the greater the
rewards]{.underline}**.29 **[Targeted [groups]{.mark} [are]{.mark} often
[willing]{.mark} [to pay higher prices]{.mark}, especially when they
control valuable natural resources]{.underline}**, evident with UNITA in
Angola. Realising that UNITA rebels used diamond profits to finance
their weapons purchases, the UN Security Council imposed an embargo on
uncertified diamond exports from Angola. This episode suggests that,
**[[as a stand-alone policy]{.mark}, [arms embargoes are unlikely to
curtail]{.mark} local [conflicts]{.mark}]{.underline}**.30 To generate
the international will to introduce an arms embargo, combatants in a
civil war must already be slaughtering one other. **[There is not a
single case where an arms embargo was introduced sufficiently early to
prevent the aggressor faction from actually initiating civil
war]{.underline}**. Therefore, **[[by the time]{.mark} [embargoes are
introduced]{.mark}, many of the [combatants are armed to the
teeth]{.mark}.]{.underline}** States now experiencing internal wars
often developed considerable stockpiles of weaponry during the Cold War.
In addition, **[combatants can anticipate an embargo and purchase arms
supplies prior to its enactment]{.underline}**; for example, UNITA
created sufficient stockpiles for two years\' fight- ing.31 **[If the
capacity of [local actors]{.mark} is sufficient, they [can replace
imports with]{.mark} an [indigenous]{.mark} [arms
industry]{.mark}]{.underline}**. The arms embargo against the South
African government did not undermine its ability to wage war externally
or internally. The government instead built an impressive and profitable
defence industry.32 **[[Actors]{.mark} in civil wars [have
proved]{.mark} to be very [creative]{.mark} in their efforts to break
arms embargoes, for example, [setting up]{.mark} secret [corporations

**[Recent dramatic [reductions in fed]{.mark}eral [budgets]{.mark} for

These private military service contractors employ thousands of retired
American military officers and view military activity as a purely
commercial enterprise.\'3 **[Federal law requires these companies to
register with the State Department and obtain a license for each
project, 4 but the government does not directly employ them. Instead,
the companies hire out their military expertise to foreign governments
and other entities for profit.\'5]{.underline}** In many ways,
**[[private military service contractors]{.mark} [are]{.mark} modern day
[privateers]{.mark}.]{.underline}** During the American Revolution, the
Continental Congress and individual colonial governments licensed
private volunteer ship owners or privateers to attack and plunder
British ships. The licenses the privateers received were termed letters
of marque and reprisal. 7 In exchange for their services these
commercial warriors were allowed to keep any booty they captured. In a
similar way, **[[companies]{.mark} like MPRI [are solicited]{.mark}
[to]{.mark} [undertake]{.mark} profit-making military [ventures]{.mark}
[that align with]{.mark} the [national security interests]{.mark} of the
United States]{.underline}**. For policymakers, **[these new
[privateers]{.mark} [provide]{.mark} many [financial]{.mark} [and
political advantages]{.mark}]{.underline}** over the use of regular
military troops. First, in an era of tight defense budgets, **[the
[use]{.mark} of private contractors like MPRI [is
inexpensive]{.mark}]{.underline}**. 8 Like many large corporations, the
United States military cannot afford to warehouse legions of experts
with very narrow specialties that are seldom needed. For the American
government, soliciting retired officers to accept privately-financed
military contracts that further American interests is extremely cost
effective. Second, in international relations, **[the introduction of
American troops into a region is often untenable]{.underline}**. Private
military contractors can behave as unofficial agents of American policy
in a region where official action is prohibited or undesirable. For
example, **[[when MPRI first entered the Balkans]{.mark}, the
[America]{.mark}n military [was barred]{.mark} from the region, and when
American troops were invited to go in, they were part of an ostensibly
neutral NATO peacekeeping force]{.underline}**.\' 9 Under the guise of a
private commercial enterprise, MPRI could thus achieve what would
otherwise be impermissible American military objectives. Finally,
employing **[[privateers]{.mark} [allow]{.mark}s [politicians to
sidestep]{.mark} sensitive [domestic]{.mark} political
[issues]{.mark}]{.underline}**.2 0 To the American public, **[risking
the lives of American service persons is often unacceptable even where
key strategic concerns are at stake. If private contractors volunteer to
take those risks at no expense to the government, [it is a win-win
situation]{.mark} from a political standpoint.]{.underline}**

organizations such **[as the Department of Defense ([DoD]{.mark}), the

[and]{.mark} the Department of State ([DoS) have contracted PMSCs to
manage security risks]{.mark}]{.underline}**. The employees of these
corporations perform duties that until recently were fulfilled by
military members, such as the protection of key personnel, convoys and

privatization was heavily favored, **[[PMSCs became a vital component of
counterinsurgency]{.underline}]{.mark}**. Despite their importance,
**[planners often overlook the role of these contractors]{.underline}**.
The two cases of Iraq and Afghanistan offer three pathways to reach the
envisioned political, tactical, operational and strategic objectives
during counterinsurgency.

Significance: **[Private security [contractors are part of

**[around 30,479 [contractors]{.mark} [worked]{.mark} for the DoD in

employed around 1850 and 3770 security contractors respectively in

members were deployed in Afghanistan in 2010\[1\]. **[[As a vital

**[The number of [armed private security contractors]{.mark} in
Afghanistan [has increased more than 65% since]{.mark} President Donald
[Trump took office]{.mark}]{.underline}**, according to a review of
Pentagon statistics.

The Pentagon\'s most recent report on contractor personnel numbers for
the first quarter of Fiscal Year 2019 shows **[[there are now
2,847]{.mark} armed private [security contractors]{.mark} supporting the
Operation Freedom\'s Sentinel mission [in Afghanistan]{.mark}, up from
the 1,722 armed contractors it reported in Jan. 2017.]{.underline}**

The use of armed security contractors seemed to be on the decline during
President Barack Obama\'s last year in office. In Jan. 2016, there were
1,083 armed contractors in Afghanistan, and in the following months, the
number fluctuated but never rose above that level before it settled at
813 armed contractors reported in October.

**[By the time the next report was issued in Jan. 2017, however, [there
were]{.mark} 1,722 armed contractors in Afghanistan, [more than double
the number deployed under Obama]{.mark}]{.underline}**. It wasn\'t clear
from the report whether the surge in contractors was a last minute
decision by the outgoing administration, or a change initiated after
Trump became commander-in-chief.

Mercenaries adapted to changing trends in statecraft and warfare by
merging into corporate entities under the title of private military
companies, or PMCs. **[[America]{.underline}]{.mark}**, the country with
the strongest national military, **[[is]{.mark} oddly [the largest
customer of PMCs]{.mark}]{.underline}**. According to the Congressional
Research Service, roughly **[10% of [America's armed forces were

in [Iraq and Afghanistan]{.mark}, the proportion has [grown to]{.mark} a
staggering [50%]{.mark}.]{.underline}** This past July, the **[Trump

The effort was part of what was labeled **[[the \"Middle East Marshall
Plan,]{.mark}\" a package [advanced by IP3]{.mark} International, [a
private company]{.mark}]{.underline}** led by a retired admiral and with
a board of assorted retired Army and Marine Corps generals, former
Republican administration officials, and congressmen. Flynn signed on as
an advisor to IP3 just before joining the Trump transition team. The
Saudi nuclear sales push is the entire focus of the company.

According to the House report, Derek **[[Harvey]{.mark}---the senior
director for Middle East and North African Affairs for the National
Security Council]{.underline}** from January to July 2017---**[[told NSC
staff]{.underline}]{.mark}** members immediately after Trump\'s
inauguration **[that [Flynn]{.mark} had [decided to adopt IP3's plan to
develop]{.mark} "dozens of [nuclear power plants]{.mark}" in Saudi
Arabia]{.underline}** during the transition while he was still serving
as an advisor to IP3. Harvey also said that **[Barrack would be made a
special representative]{.underline}**, with credentials equivalent to an
ambassador, to guide the plan.

On January 27, Harvey met with representatives of IP3, including its
co-founders, retired General Jack Keane, Reagan administration National
Security Advisor Robert McFarlane, and a group of other retired generals
working with the firm. Immediately after the meeting, **[Harvey told NSC
staffers to add information about IP3's "plan for 40 nuclear power
plants]{.underline}**" to the briefing package for President Trump's
call with Saudi Arabia\'s King Salman---stating that \"**[this was the
\'energy plan\' that had been developed and approved by General Flynn
during the presidential transition]{.underline}**,\" according to the
report.

The IP3 plan draft was sent to Flynn on January 28, 2017 by McFarlane, a
board member of IP3 and co-founder of the US Energy Security Council.
The email said, "In the enclosed memo you would call upon the relevant
cabinet officers to lend their support to this historic program. I
recommend that you sign it."

The draft memo, written to be signed by Flynn, stated, \"Tom Barrack has
been thoroughly briefed on this strategy and wants to run it for you.
He's perfect for the job. Rex \[Tillerson, then Secretary of State\] and
\[Defense Secretary\] Jim \[Mattis\] are supportive of Tom's focus on
this also.\"

After Harvey\'s pronouncement of the plan, career **[[NSC]{.mark}
staffers [warned]{.mark} him that \"any [transfer of nuclear
tech]{.mark}nology [must comply with the A]{.mark}tomic [E]{.mark}nergy
[A]{.mark}ct]{.underline}**, that the United States and Saudi Arabia
would need to reach a 123 Agreement, and that these legal requirements
could not be circumvented.\"

**[[Section 123]{.mark}]{.underline}** of the Atomic Energy Act
**[[requires]{.mark} that countries receiving nuclear
technology]{.underline}** from the US **[must comply with a number of
[requirements focused on nonprolif]{.mark}eration of nuclear
weapons]{.underline}**, including a guarantee that transferred nuclear
material, equipment, and technology will not have any role in nuclear
weapons development or any other military purpose, except in the case of
cooperation with nuclear-weapon states. Enrichment of nuclear fuel must
be covered under a separate agreement and must be overseen by the
International Atomic Energy Agency. The law also dictates that the US
can demand the return of any transferred equipment if the IAEA reports a
violation.

**[[Harvey]{.mark} was reported to have [ignored the
warnings]{.mark}]{.underline}** and continued to insist that the
decision had already been made. The House report states:

Both career and political **[staff inside the White House reportedly
agreed that Mr. Harvey's directive could violate the law]{.underline}**.
One senior political official stated that the proposal was "not a
business plan," but rather "a scheme for these generals to make some
money." That official stated: "Okay, you know we cannot do this." Yet,
just **[days after the President's inauguration, [IP3]{.mark} officials
[sent documents directly to]{.mark} General [Flynn for]{.mark} President
[Trump to approve]{.mark}]{.underline}**, including a draft Cabinet Memo
stating that the President had appointed Mr. Barrack as a special
representative.

**[[Even after the NSC]{.mark} legal advisor]{.underline}** John
Eisenberg **[[ordered a stop]{.mark} to all work on the
plan]{.underline}** and senior officials told IP3 representatives to
take their plan through normal government agency channels, **[[Harvey
persisted. McFarlane continued]{.mark} to push to get the plan [in front
of Trump]{.mark}]{.underline}**, sending an email to Harvey with a
subject line reading, "We're Very Close to Losing Our Position in the
Middle East." **[[McFarlane sought \"a public US]{.mark} government
statement or [letter of support]{.mark} for the IP3 plan]{.underline}**,
ideally ahead of then-Saudi Deputy Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman's
visit to Washington, D.C.,\" the congressional staff report states.

**[[Harvey managed]{.mark} to [work the plan into Trump\'s agenda
for]{.mark}]{.underline}** the March 2017 **[[meeting
with]{.underline}]{.mark}** then-Deputy Crown Prince
**[[M]{.mark}ohammed [b]{.mark}in [S]{.mark}alman]{.underline}** in the

program\... in energy]{.underline}**, industry, infrastructure, and
technology **[worth]{.underline}** potentially **[more than \$200
billion]{.underline}** in direct and indirect investments within the
next four years." **[[Nobody]{.mark} else]{.underline}** in the NSC
**[[had been aware]{.mark} of any such plan]{.underline}**.

But the seed was planted, and **[[Trump has continued to be \"directly
engaged in the effort, maintaining contact with IP3]{.mark} about the
plans]{.underline}** and expressing his support for the transfer of
nuclear technology to Saudi Arabia,\" the report states. \"**[These
reports also indicate that Saudi Arabia is refusing to agree to
prohibitions]{.underline}** on enriching uranium and processing
plutonium similar to those agreed to by other countries in the region.\"

### 1NC -- Circumvention -- FMF

#### DoS is looking in to FMF -- it could replace FMS

**Diamond 17** (Steven S. Diamond, has over thirty years of experience
in subjects like government contracts law, "FMS Leasing: A New
Alternative for Foreign Military Sales', *Mondaq.com*, 03/13/2017,

Date Accessed: 07/24/2019)

\*\*FMF = Foreign Military Funding

[Government [contractors]{.mark}]{.underline} interested in pursuing
international sales [[should]{.mark} also [consider the]{.mark}
potential [availability of]{.mark} foreign military funding
([FMF]{.mark}) to their foreign government customers for the lease of
defense equipment]{.underline}. Although typically prohibited,\[1\] [[in
some circumstances]{.underline}]{.mark}, the Defense Security
Cooperation Agency ([[DSCA]{.underline}]{.mark}) [[has approved the use
of FMF funding]{.underline}]{.mark} for equipment leases. As explained
below, using [FMF funds to facilitate leases of defense equipment can be
advantageous to American defense contractors, foreign government
customers and the U.S. government]{.underline}. Contractors may be in a
position to self-finance these leases, or they may require third-party
financing. For the latter, executing these deals will require combining
the worlds of FMF transactions and commercial equipment lease financing,
which at first blush present mutually conflicting requirements.

With the decline in U.S. defense spending, American contractors are
looking abroad to sell their goods and services to foreign customers. At
the same time, [[increasingly unstable geopolitical conditions
and]{.mark} rapid [growth in]{.mark} emerging [economies make]{.mark}
some [foreign governments eager]{.mark} customers [for]{.mark}
U.S.-produced defense [equipment]{.mark}]{.underline}. Under certain
circumstances, the U.S. government facilitates and funds the sale of
military supplies and services to friendly countries.

Often, [[the U.S.]{.underline}]{.mark} government [[will assist in
funding]{.mark} these transactions [to further foreign policy and
military objectives]{.mark}]{.underline}. The sale of defense equipment
to foreign customers generally occurs within the legal framework of
either a (1) foreign mlitary sale (FMS) or (2) direct commercial
contract (DCC) with a foreign government, assisted with FMF funds.

FMS, which is the more common of the two approaches, involves a foreign
government purchasing directly from a U.S. defense agency, with the
defense agency contracting through a standard federal government supply
contract with a U.S. contractor. The [U.S. Department of
Defense](http://www.mondaq.com/redirection.asp?article_id=576448&company_id=21532&redirectaddress=http%3A//www.law360.com/agencies/u-s-department-of-defense)
handles all aspects of the procurement --- including contract formation
and administration, selection of terms and conditions, quality
assurance, payment, and dispute resolution. This relieves the foreign
government of a considerable administrative burden, and allows it to
capitalize on the DOD\'s acquisition experience. Conversely, the foreign
customer loses some control over the acquisition process and may pay a
premium for the DOD\'s services.

Under the DCC framework, the foreign customer contracts directly with a
U.S. contractor. The U.S. government may provide assistance in the form
of FMF. In contrast to the FMS framework, in a DCC, there is privity
between the contractor and the foreign government. Although various
requirements are imposed by the U.S. government, the foreign government
and the contractor act relatively independently during the acquisition
process. The prerequisites for entering a DCC and obtaining FMF funding
are set forth in DCSA guidance,\[2\] which requires, among other things,
that the contractor execute a contractor certification and agreement
with DSCA and, potentially, submit to a pre-award survey, pricing review
and U.S. government audit rights.\[3\]

FMS and FMF transactions are typically contracts for sale, but they can
also be structured as leasing arrangements. Foreign governments might
prefer leases because leasing may involve lower cost and less risk of
owning equipment that could become obsolete. As in any equipment lease,
the lessee pays for the value it uses. From the U.S. government
perspective, [[the]{.mark} [[U.S. Department of
State](http://www.mondaq.com/redirection.asp?article_id=576448&company_id=21532&redirectaddress=http%3A//www.law360.com/agencies/u-s-department-of-state)
and the DOD are incentivized to approve FMF]{.mark} for leases, [because
such arrangements allow leverage]{.mark} of increasingly scarce
appropriations and facilitate relations [with
allies]{.mark}]{.underline}. Leases appeal to contractors, because they
generate increased revenue and may ultimately result in the foreign
customer purchasing the equipment (e.g., through a lease-to-own
provision). Even without a sale, the contractor may be able to re-lease
or resell the equipment.

The FMS legal framework expressly allows for leases under certain
circumstances, but leases generally have been prohibited from receiving
FMF funding.\[4\] [Foreign [customers]{.mark} may nevertheless
[prefer]{.mark} direct lease [contracts supported by
FMF]{.mark}]{.underline}, so that they have more control over the
transaction and can obtain equipment that they otherwise may not have
funding to procure. [The [DSCA]{.mark}, in limited circumstances thus
far, [has shown]{.mark} a [willingness to consider FMF]{.mark} for lease
transactions. Unlike FMS leasing, which is more common, there are no
guidelines for FMF leases]{.underline}, and striking the balance between
a compliant FMF transaction and a commercial equipment lease can be
difficult. The following section addresses issues that must be
considered when contemplating an FMF lease.

The reports to Congress specifically delineate those participants in the
International Military Education and Training (IMET) program tagged in
the State Department's annual human-rights reporting effort as having
problematic behavior**[. As [the main program]{.mark} [that]{.mark}
[brings foreigners]{.mark} to the United States [to]{.mark} attend U.S.
[military schools]{.mark} at Washington's expense, [IMET]{.mark}
[is]{.mark} now [offered]{.mark} [to]{.mark} select military and police
officers in more than [120 countries]{.mark} worldwide. A much larger
portion of the military's foreign trainees is instructed in their own
countries or at regional foreign centers]{.underline}**.

Under a provision of the defense funding bill for fiscal year 2017 that
Congress approved and President Barack Obama signed in December, the
Trump administration will be required to certify that future security
assistance "includes a comprehensive curriculum on human rights and the
law of armed conflict." But it does not specify what this should consist
of.

**[The IMET training costs more than \$100 million
annually]{.underline}** and in 2014 trained roughly 4,000 foreign
military officers, amounting to 7 percent of the more than 56,000
foreign officers trained by the Defense Department yearly.

**[The [IMET]{.mark} program, in turn, [is]{.mark} [part]{.mark}
[of]{.mark} [a]{.mark} larger U.S. government [effort to build up
foreign police]{.mark} [and]{.mark} [military forces]{.mark} at a total
cost of \$250 billion since the September 2001 terror
attacks]{.underline}**. **[[That]{.mark} larger [effort]{.mark}
[is]{.mark} [managed]{.mark} by roughly 46 government offices [with
little coordination]{.mark} [and weak
oversight]{.mark}]{.underline}**[,]{.mark} according to multiple
critics. While the work is mostly funded by the Pentagon, the State
Department is supposed to lead it, and to vet potential trainees.

"**[These [dysfunctions]{.mark} [include]{.mark} [shortcomings in
personnel]{.mark} and bureaucratic structure... [a mismatch in]{.mark}
planning [cultures]{.mark} [and budgeting]{.mark} timelines; a [lack
of]{.mark} policy [prioritization]{.mark} [and]{.mark} coherence \[and\]
insufficient clarity, [transparency]{.mark}, and monitoring and
evaluation]{.underline}**," according to the Open Society Foundation's
Rose Jackson, who served as chief of staff in the State Department's
Bureau of Democracy, Human Rights and Labor from 2013 until last April
and recently completed a comprehensive study of the issue (PDF).

The IMET program was started in 1976 to foster closer relations with
foreign militaries, but one of its three stated goals is to teach
foreign military officers "basic issues involving internationally
recognized human rights," according to the Foreign Assistance Act.

That goal has been sketchily met, experts say**[. Most of the IMET
[courses]{.mark} [concern war strategy]{.mark}, [tech]{.mark}nical
[skills]{.mark}, and management, and the participants read military
history and are taught how to react in a crisis]{.underline}**. The
Defense Department says human-rights topics are woven into these
courses. At the Defense International Studies Institute in Newport,
Rhode Island, the naval school in Monterey, and the Western Hemisphere
Institute for Security Cooperation in Georgia, for instance, IMET
students take courses on international law, military ethics, and
civil-military relations as part of yearlong master's degree programs.

At most of the other service colleges, however, the officers instead
participate in field trips to American cities, courthouses, and
nonprofit organizations meant only generally to expose the IMET students
to American values, according to the State Department's annual "Foreign
Military Training" report and interviews with independent experts and
international program directors at Defense Department service colleges.

**[While most of the 17 officers listed in the State Department
disclosures took courses on command and strategy, the reports list only
one as having completed a rule of law course.]{.underline}**

Their experience was typical, not unusual, according to researchers at
the Security Assistance Monitor, a unit of the Center for International
Policy that tracks U.S. spending related to foreign militaries. In an
analysis completed last year based on public reports, the unit concluded
that only 11.7 percent of IMET-funded students in 2014 took courses
focused on human rights or the rule of law.

A Pentagon spokesman, Navy Cmdr. Patrick L. Evans, said in an email to
CPI that the department "is committed to providing comprehensive
training" to foreign personnel on military budgeting, civilian-control
mechanisms, military-justice systems, and following codes of conduct
that meet international human-rights standards.

But Shannon Green, a former senior director for global engagement at the
National Security Council during the Obama administration who now
directs the Human Rights Initiative at the Center for Strategic and
International Studies, said ["**[the
h]{.underline}**]{.mark}**[uman-[r]{.mark}ights [training]{.mark}
component [is merely a check-the-box exercise]{.mark}]{.underline}**."
She said she formed this conclusion after interviewing Pentagon
officials about how to improve U.S. security assistance.

its IMET research, said the U.S. military should not only give human
rights a higher priority but take a broad view of how to instill it. Its
courses, he said, should emphasize the importance of combating
corruption and creating robust oversight mechanisms, while tailoring
training to specific human-rights gaps in countries where the officers
are serving.

### 1NC -- Circumvention -- CAT Policy

#### Trump will circumvent the aff with the administration's CAT policy

**Emmons 18** (Alex Emmons is a reporter covering national security,
foreign affairs, human rights, and politics, "HOW A ONE-WORD LOOPHOLE
WILL MAKE IT EASIER FOR THE U.S. TO SELL WEAPONS TO GOVERNMENTS THAT
KILL CIVILIANS", The Intercept, 7-20-18, Accessed on 7-27-19,
<https://theintercept.com/2018/07/20/trump-conventional-arms-transfer-policy/>,
DP)

**[When it was issued in April, the Trump administration's Conventional
Arms Transfer policy was widely panned by critics for prioritizing the
profits of weapons companies ahead of transparency and human rights
concerns.]{.underline}** The White House was blunt about its intentions,
promising that the executive branch would "advocate strongly on behalf
of United States companies."

**[But [one change]{.mark} in particular may [make it easier for
American companies to sell]{.mark} weapons to governments that routinely
kill civilians in conflicts [by discounting killings that the
governments claim are unintentional]{.mark}.]{.underline}** The change
could have a significant impact on sales to Saudi Arabia and the United
Arab Emirates --- the top two U.S. weapons clients --- both of which are
engaged in a destructive bombing campaign in Yemen.

**[The loophole hinges on the insertion of one word in a section that is
otherwise identical to the Obama administration's conventional arms
policy, which was issued in 2014. While the previous policy prohibited
arms transfers to countries that perpetrate "attacks directed against
civilian objects or civilians," the [Trump administration]{.mark} policy
[bars]{.mark} such [transfers to]{.mark} [countries that commit]{.mark}
"[attacks intentionally directed against]{.mark} civilian objects or
[civilians]{.mark}" (emphasis added).]{.underline}**

The release of the new policy was followed by a two-month public comment
period that ended last month. On Monday, the State Department issued a
fact sheet on the policy's implementation, which promised it would
energize a "whole-of-government effort to expedite transfers that
support \[the administration's\] essential foreign policy and national
security objectives."

**[Colby Goodman, a researcher on arms sales and director of the
Security Assistance Monitor at the Center for International Policy, said
[arms control groups]{.mark} had [objected]{.mark} to the word
"intentional," [but no change was reflected]{.mark} in the guidelines
released Monday.]{.underline}**

**["Depending on how [this policy]{.mark} is implemented, this focus
could [make it harder for those in the]{.mark} U.S. [government]{.mark}
\[with\] legitimate human rights concerns to [block or modify]{.mark}
some proposed U.S. arms [sales]{.mark}," Goodman told The
Intercept.]{.underline}**

The loophole is particularly significant in light of the destructive
Saudi and Emirati-led bombing campaign in Yemen, where civilian deaths
are routinely termed inadvertent or unintentional.

### 1NC -- Circumvention -- Pseudo-FMS

#### Pseudo-FMS programs would fill in -- it's faster and has more variety in equipment

**GAO 17** -- "Foreign Military Sales: DoD Needs to Improve Its Use of
Performance Information to Manage the Program," pg. 39, Accessed
7/24/19, \<<https://www.gao.gov/assets/690/686720.pdf>\> // NS

**[The United States provides military equipment and training to partner
countries through a variety of programs]{.underline}**. Foreign partners
may pay the U.S. government to administer the acquisition of materiel
and services on their behalf through the FMS program. **[The United
States also provides grants to some foreign partners through the Foreign
Military Financing (FMF) program to fund the partner's purchase of
materiel and services through the process used for FMS.]{.underline}**
In recent years, **[[Congress has expanded]{.mark} the number of
security cooperation [programs]{.mark} [to include]{.mark} several
[new]{.mark} [programs]{.mark} [with funds]{.mark} [appropriated]{.mark}
[to]{.mark} the Department of Defense ([DOD]{.mark}]{.underline}**), as
well as administered and implemented by DOD, that focus on building
partner capacity. In this report, **[we refer to these programs as
"[pseudo-FMS]{.mark}" cases]{.underline}**. **[FMS and pseudo-FMS
transactions follow the same process, but [the roles, responsibilities,
and actors]{.mark} involved [can differ]{.mark}.]{.underline}** One
important difference highlighted by DOD and Department of State (State)
officials is that **[with FMS, there is a much greater level of
involvement on the part of the partner country in defining requirements
and developing the Letters of Offer and Acceptance]{.underline}** (LOA).
As a result, **[[the]{.mark} amount of [time]{.mark} it takes [to
develop FMS]{.mark} cases on average will tend to [exceed the
time]{.mark} it takes [for pseudo-FMS]{.mark} cases]{.underline}**.
According to DOD and State officials, **[[there may]{.mark} also [be
differences in the types of equipment]{.mark} that tend to be provided
via FMS as opposed to pseudo-FMS cases]{.underline}**. For example,
pseudo-FMS is not typically used to provide complex weapons systems with
long production cycles such as advanced fighter aircraft. According to
DOD and State officials, pseudo-FMS cases are often prioritized because
the funds used for these programs generally are only available for
obligation for 1 or 2 years, depending on the program. These officials
note that funds for traditional FMF programs do not have such time
constraints. As a result, **[pseudo-FMS cases are,]{.underline}** on
average**[, processed faster than FMS cases]{.underline}**. Army and Air
Force officials noted that **[[pseudo-FMS cases]{.mark} [tend]{.mark}
[to be]{.mark} [more]{.mark} [labor intensive]{.mark} than FMS
cases]{.underline}** for several reasons. For example, according to Air
Force officials, **[pseudo-FMS [cases]{.mark} [often involve
items]{.mark} [that]{.mark} frequently require a new contract because
the item [is not part of]{.mark} the [Air Force
inventory]{.mark}]{.underline}**. For that reason, Air Force officials
noted that they cannot modify an existing contract to add additional
items. Army officials said that **[pseudo-FMS [cases]{.mark}
[require]{.mark} [more work]{.mark} [because]{.mark} of the nature [of
expiring funds.]{.mark}]{.underline}** This requires an acceleration of
almost all their processes.

In the 60s the US military had the ingenious idea to purge the armed
services of excess and dated weaponry that would increase operational
capability of US forces and allow America's allies to purchase military
equipment that would improve interoperability. Congress formally created
the Foreign Military Sales program (**[[FMS]{.underline}]{.mark}**),
however, like any well-intentioned government program, it **[[morphed
into]{.mark} something other than its intended purpose]{.underline}**,
in this case, **[[an international arms trafficking
business]{.mark}.]{.underline}**

The US does have **[legislation to oversee]{.underline}** Foreign
Military Financing (**[FMF]{.underline}**) **[and]{.underline}** Direct
Commercial Sales (**[DCS]{.underline}**) programs; however, it looks
**[like [the defense industry is circumventing]{.mark} the intended
burdensome [regulations]{.mark}]{.underline}**, **[apparently [with
government consent]{.mark}, by [partnering with foreign
countries]{.mark}]{.underline}** to arm America's Middle East partners.
The **[defense firms]{.underline}** are now **[licensing US technology
through FMS/FMF/DSCS]{.underline}** departments **[to]{.underline}** arm
many Middle Eastern **[countries]{.underline}**, many **[[with terrorist
ties]{.underline}]{.mark}**.

For example, military defense contractors, like **[[Lockheed
Martin]{.underline}]{.mark}**, have **[[partnered with
the]{.underline}]{.mark}** United Arab Emirates
(**[[UAE]{.underline}]{.mark}**) **[under]{.underline}** the state-owned
company Advanced Military Maintenance Repair and Overhaul Center
(**[AMMROC]{.underline}**) **[to weaponize]{.underline}** Black Hawk
helicopters and Falcon F-16s (block 60/61), **[American's workhorse
fighter]{.underline}**.

The latter is especially troubling because **[Lockheed Martin is
PARTNERING with UAE [to build the most advanced technological F-16s
inside the Emirates.]{.mark} [Federal law]{.mark} explicitly
[prohibits]{.mark} the [modification]{.mark} of US]{.underline}**
military **[weapons]{.underline}** and systems transferred
**[[under]{.underline}]{.mark}** the **[[FMS]{.underline}]{.mark}**
program. But increasingly**[, US defense industries are venturing with
foreign corporations]{.underline}** to manufacture and supply state of
the art weaponry under the aegis of national security.

In 2017 Rick Groesch, Lockheed's regional vice president at the time,
told The National, in Abu Dhabi, \"We are talking to some in the region
\[about sales\].\" The International Defense Exhibition and Conference
introduced Lockheed Martin's idea to sell F-16s to Bahrain. The program
was initiated under Obama, but after the 2016 presidential election,
Groesch said the **[Trump]{.underline}** administration was eager to
**[continue negotiations]{.underline}**.

\"We are talking to them \[Bahrain\] about it, and the \[US\] government
is talking to them about buying an additional production aircraft which
will be designated Block 70 \[technology\],\" he concluded.

Andrew Strike of the Department of State responded to questions about
the military and its partnership with Lockheed Martin by sending a
February 4, 2019 link: \"Under US law, any US company or individual
involved in certain activities involving the items enumerated on the
USML is required to receive an approved export license or other approval
before providing any USML regulated item, technical data, or service to
a foreign end-user. As with FMS, export licenses approved under DCS are
approved following an intensive US government review and, as required,
after Congressional notification. Export licenses are valid for up to
four years. Authorizations for defense services are also required and
may last for longer timeframes. Licenses and authorizations may be
extended or amended as needed. DCS cases are considered to be a
proprietary agreement between the foreign governments or companies and
the US defense contractor. However, certain information about cases
notified to Congress is published quarterly in the Federal Register, in
fulfillment of requirements in the Arms Export Control Act.\"

In laymen's terms, **[the State Department considers the FMS program in
conformity with US law]{.underline}** **[and]{.underline}** believes the
Kingdom of **[Saudi Arabia and the Emirates will fulfill]{.underline}**
their contractual **[requirements]{.underline}** to retain procession of
all US military equipment.

**[So far, [the program has flown under]{.mark} the media
[radar]{.mark}]{.underline}** and received little attention over the
sales of high-tech weapons to favored Middle East nations. In essence,
the State Department along with **[[the Defense
Department]{.underline}]{.mark}** has overseen a program that
essentially **[[allows US businesses to operate with]{.mark}
[Middle]{.mark} [East governments to loosen]{.mark} the
[congressionally]{.mark} mandated [end-user
agreements]{.mark}]{.underline}**.

Typically an end-user certificate contains the parameters of the
purchase governing how military weapons must be used and they cannot be
transferred to a third nation or party without United States approval.
It also requires that the end user provide the same physical security as
the US provides and the recipient nation must allow the Americans to
verify compliance on a regular basis.

The **[original]{.underline}** statutory **[[law included strict
guidelines]{.mark} that partner]{.underline}** nations **[could not be
sponsors [of terrorism]{.mark}]{.underline}**
[**[or]{.underline}**]{.mark} **[[h]{.underline}]{.mark}**uman
**[[r]{.underline}]{.mark}**ights **[[violators]{.underline}]{.mark}**.
**[However, the UAE and Saudi Arabia have been designated as sponsors of
terrorism]{.underline}**. Both countries are **[listed on the State
Department's human rights list]{.underline}**. Those **[[designations
should exclude KSA and UAE from participating in the FMS/FMF/DSCA
programs]{.underline}]{.mark}**. A White House waiver is required to
sell FMS to countries in violation of the statute based upon a
presidential finding that the sales meet US \"national security\"
requirements.

The consequences for broadening foreign military sales to questionable
state actors are plentiful. A 2017 Reuters article highlighted the
Emirates violated the UN arms embargo in Libya by aiding military
commander Khalifa Haftar. UAE provided enhanced air superiority to
Haftar's Libyan National Army (LNA) to gain the upper hand last year in
a conflict between rival groups vying for control of Libya.

The United Nations also said it received evidence that attack
helicopters were delivered to the LNA group in April 2015. The UN report
published \"a photo of an AT-802i single-engine plane which was based in
eastern Libya. The plane, originally designed for agricultural or
firefighting use, was repurposed in the United States for
counter-insurgency \[operations\] and sold to the UAE.\"

The UN also confirmed LNA received a shipment of \"... Ninety-three
armored personnel carriers and 549 armored and non-armored vehicles
...\" destined for the LNA in April 2016. The report concluded Saudi
Arabian carriers' shipped Panther T6 and Tygra models; coincidentally,
companies based in the UAE, modified and delivered those weapons to the
North African battlefield.

The so-called \"partnership\" between US corporations and the UAE is
highlighted in a Human Rights Watch Report (HRW) written last month
accusing the UAE of playing a leading role as Saudi Arabia's proxy in
the war in Yemen. HRW argued that the UAE \"conducted scores of unlawful
attacks in Yemen.\"

They \"documented 87 unlawful coalition attacks, some likely war crimes,
that have killed nearly 1,000 civilians.\"

Adding fuel to the deadly region is the Emirates deployment of 30
aircraft committed to bombing various targets in Yemen. According to
HRC, \"A helicopter attacked a boat carrying Somali migrants and
refugees off Yemen's coast, killing and wounding dozens, a member of the
UAE armed forces said UAE forces were operating in the area but denied
carrying out the attack.\"

**[Despite]{.underline}** this **[egregious behavior, [FMS
weapons]{.mark}]{.underline}** continue to **[[stream onto battlegrounds
across the globe]{.underline}]{.mark}**. **[A Senior State Department
official explained]{.underline}**, \"review and monitoring are an
integral component of the process for US-origin defense articles
delivered to any recipient nation. The monitoring is to make sure that
those articles are being used in the manner intended and are consistent
with our legal obligations, foreign policy goals, and values.\"
Unfortunately, **[the [US is not able to monitor all]{.mark} high tech
[weapons]{.mark}]{.underline}** and sadly the **[[corrupt
nations]{.underline}]{.mark}** resort to
**[[resell]{.mark}ing]{.underline}** US weapons **[to
terrorist]{.underline}** organizations.\"

When it comes to terrorism, **[numerous think tanks and academia believe
Saudi Arabia, not Iran, is the largest state sponsor of terrorism in the
world.]{.underline}** In fact, this week the EU took an extraordinary
action to curb terrorist funding by adding the House of Saud to the list
of Terror-Funding Nations. \"We have established the strongest
anti-money laundering standards in the world, but we have to make sure
that dirty money from other countries does not find its way to our
financial system," Vera Jourova, the European commissioner said in a
statement. "Dirty money is the lifeblood of organized crime and
terrorism.\"

Even the Obama administration understood the terrorism realities.
**[Hillary Clinton, the former Secretary of State]{.underline}**,
**[wrote a memo in 2009 that]{.underline}** was released by WikiLeaks.
The memo **[acknowledged]{.underline}** state \"donors in **[Saudi
Arabia constitute the most significant source of funding to Sunni
terrorist]{.underline}** groups worldwide... Saudi Arabia remains a
critical financial support base for al-Qaida, the Taliban, LeT \[Lashkar
e-Tayyiba\], and other terrorist groups, including Hamas, which probably
raise millions of dollars annually from Saudi sources.\"

Mrs. Clinton also confirmed the Saudi government was doing little to
curb its ties with Royal family members funding terrorism that continues
to kill Americans and its allies in the region.

Regrettably, the disconnect between Middle East reality and the military
brass is ever-present as Commander, US Central Command (CENTCOM) Army
General Joseph Votel, testified before the Senate Armed Services
Committee last week and told members he thinks the US needs STRONGER
agreements with KSA and UAE. \"We look to strengthen our security
cooperation partnership through continued engagement and FMS programs.\"

Votel suggested all countries stand to gain from additional military
weapon sales. \"The US and UAE cooperate under a strong bilateral
framework to prevent and respond to conflicts and crises, and the UAE
has clearly indicated a desire to forge even stronger military
relationships with the US,\" he explained. \"The UAE is active in an
operational partnership to disrupt terrorist networks and reduce
terrorist attacks and is the only member of the Saudi-led Coalition in
Yemen to expand its military objectives to include counter-terrorism
alongside the US.\"

The CENTCOM Commander said the Emirates \"expressed a desire to
strengthen our relationship through a nine-point Defense Cooperation
Roadmap, which supports our NDS \[National Defense Strategy\] through
increased burden sharing in its own defense. The UAE's purchase of US
produced weapon systems will help secure interoperability.\"

**[[The General was confident that the UAE would stand with
America]{.mark} in its fight [against]{.mark}]{.underline}** Violent
Extremist Organizations (VEOs) aka
**[[terrorists]{.underline}]{.mark}**, operating in Syria, Yemen, and
Afghanistan.

In this case, **[[the proof is not in the pudding as a Yemen bomb strike
killed 44 children]{.underline}]{.mark}**. Additional reporting from the
Associated Press acknowledged that the UAE and Saudi Arabia are
partaking in \"secret deals with al-Qaida fighters, paying some to leave
key cities and towns and letting others retreat with weapons, equipment
and wads of looted cash ... hundreds more were recruited to join the
coalition itself.\"

### 1NC -- Circumvention -- Presidential Draw-Down

#### Presidential drawdown authority circumvents the aff

**GAO 85** (The United States Government Accountability Office is a
legislative branch government agency that provides auditing, evaluation,
and investigative services for the United States Congress, "Use of
Special Presidential Authorities for Foreign Assistance", GAO, 5-28-85,
Accessed on 7-23-19, <https://www.gao.gov/products/GAO/NSIAD-85-79>, DP)

THE DRAWDOWN AUTHORITY **[Since 1963, 13 [drawdowns]{.mark} have been
authorized for \$862.1 million and 12 have actually been made, to
[provide]{.mark} a variety of [military equipment]{.mark} to six
countries \--Vietnam, Cambodia, Thailand, Liberia, El Salvador, and
Chad.]{.underline}** ( See P. 8.1 )

As enacted in 1961, use of the drawdown authority was conditioned on a
determination by the President that a drawdown was vital to U.S.
security interests. During the 19709, this criterion was relaxed,
reinstated and strengthened, and relaxed again. **[Overall, the drawdown
authority has changed from a large dollar ceiling, tightly controlled,
special authority to a moderate dollar ceiling authority with less
control over its use.]{.underline}** Even though there have been changes
in\' the drawdown usage criteria, written procedures governing use of
the authority have apparently not been updated. GAO\'s review of
documents shows that up to 1976 there was written guidance, generally
within DOD, on use of the drawdown authority. **[[Officials]{.mark} told
GAO that they [do not know of any]{.mark} current written [guidances
on]{.mark} the [use]{.mark} of the drawdown authority.]{.underline}**

**[In addition, GAO was told [there is no definition of]{.mark} the key
terms of [the authority]{.mark}. Currently, the usage criteria are that
[the President]{.mark} must [determine]{.mark} that there is [an]{.mark}
unforeseen [emergency requiring immediate military assistance]{.mark}
and this emergency cannot be met under any other law.]{.underline}**
(See pp. 7-8 and 13-16.)

**[[The interpretation]{.mark} of what meets the criteria can [vary by
situation and]{.mark} by [administration]{.mark}.]{.underline}** The
U.S. response to Thailand\'s security problems is an example of this
variability. In 1980, the drawdown authority was used to fund an airlift
of military equipment following a Vietnamese attack across the Thai
border. In 1983, the U.S. response to a similar but greater attack was
to require Thailand to pay for a similar airlift through its military
assistance grant funds. (See p. 16.)

In the 1960s and early 197Os, the Congress appropriated specific funds
for drawdown reimbursement. Since 1979, Congress has appropriated a lump
sum amount for military assistance with reimbursement of DOD for a
drawdown being one of the items that could be funded. **[As a result,
the decision on reimbursement of a drawdown has shifted from the
Congress to the executive branch. Since 1979, most [military assistance
funding]{.mark} has gone to [provide defense articles and services for
various countries]{.mark}, and drawdown reimbursements have not been
made.]{.underline}** (See pp. 16-20.)

Access to this information is more important than ever as this
administration continues to strip Congress of its oversight powers and
consistently pushes a U.S. foreign policy that prioritizes business
interests over human rights or diplomatic relationships. This is most
evident in the Trump administration approach to U.S. arms sales. Since
taking office, President Trump has removed Obama-era suspensions on arms
sales to Bahrain, Nigeria and Saudi Arabia, to which sales were withheld
due to human rights concerns. Human rights have also taken second place
to economic considerations in the Trump administration's new
Conventional Arms Transfer policy; and Trump has requested that U.S.
ambassadors, the top American diplomats, promote U.S. arms sales.

At the beginning of this year, **[the [Trump]{.mark} administration
notified Congress of its [plans to loosen]{.mark} the [regulatory
controls]{.mark} [on]{.mark} some U.S. [firearms exports]{.mark}
[and]{.mark} [transfer]{.mark} [jurisdiction]{.mark} of these exports
[to]{.mark} the [Commerce Department]{.mark}]{.underline}**.
**[[This]{.mark} move [means]{.mark} that [Congress will lose]{.mark}
its [oversight]{.mark} role on important and deadly U.S. weapons,
[which]{.mark} in the past [had allowed them to stop certain problematic
exports to Turkey and the Philippines]{.mark}]{.underline}**. If
anything, **[U.S. [weapons]{.mark} [exports]{.mark} [deserve higher
scrutiny]{.mark}, rather than being treated as mere business
transactions and reduced to a streamlined export process similar to that
of tractor exportation.]{.underline}**

Controversies surrounding the recipients, use and diversion of arms
sales are by no means a new phenomenon. What makes Trump's policies and
abuse of power so dangerous is **[the new precedent his administration
has set allowing the executive branch to make foreign policy decisions
unilaterally]{.underline}**. In effect, arms sales are now driving U.S.
foreign policy instead of being used as a tool for it. The repercussions
from this reversal could be disastrous. On top of eroding American
values and diminishing U.S. credibility among its partners, **[some
[countries]{.mark} [have]{.mark} [learned]{.mark} how [to
leverage]{.mark} [our]{.mark} own "[tool]{.mark}" against

### They Say: "Congress Checks"

#### Congress can't check Trump -- Legislative fixes take too long, Congress can't override a veto, and legal arguments would avoid any checks

**[The [challenge for]{.mark} any of these [legislative
fixes]{.mark}]{.underline}**, ultimately, **[[will be making it past
a]{.mark} presidential [veto]{.mark}]{.underline}**. While **[[measures
limiting]{.mark} the [president]{.mark}'s authority to use military
[force]{.mark} against Iran]{.underline}** might plausibly garner
majority support in the House and the Senate, they **[[seem unlikely to
secure]{.mark} the two-thirds [support]{.mark} in both chambers that
would be needed to override Trump's veto]{.underline}**. This is why
existing proposals are mostly being debated within the context of the
annual NDAA and defense appropriations bill, as tying such measures to
high-priority omnibus legislation may make it much more politically
difficult for Trump to use his veto. But **[[there is no guarantee
that]{.mark} these [provisions will survive]{.mark} to the final draft
of each bill. And, even if they do, the [legislation]{.mark} currently
being debated [is unlikely to become law before the fall of
2019]{.mark}.]{.underline}**

Hence, **[even if Congress chooses to act, President [Trump will]{.mark}
most likely [have]{.mark} what his legal advisers view as [legal
authority to use military force against Iran]{.mark} for the next
several months. He will have the strongest legal grounds to
act]{.underline}** if Iran is foolish enough to take action against U.S.
nationals or personnel, but his legal advisers most likely do not see
his authority as being strictly limited to that scenario. His
administration's own stated views also imply that there are
constitutional limits on his ability to pursue large-scale, extended
military campaigns involving substantial hostilities and U.S. ground
forces---the type of operation that would most likely be required for
effective regime change---without congressional authorization. Yet
**[[there are precedents for legal arguments the]{.mark} Trump

Intercept, he worked for Amnesty International and the American Civil
Liberties Union on their campaigns against targeted killing, mass

a Fake Emergency To Sell Weapons to Saudi Arabia," *The Intercept*,

<https://theintercept.com/2019/05/24/us-saudi-arabia-arms-sales/> // NS

In a statement on Friday, Sen. Bob Menedez, the top Democrat on the
Senate Foreign Relations Committee, said that **[[in notifying
Congress]{.mark} of its plans, the [Trump]{.mark} administration had
"described years of malign Iranian behavior but [failed to
identify]{.mark} [what]{.mark} actually [constitutes an
emergency]{.mark} today]{.underline}**."

Since 2015, Saudi Arabia and the UAE have been involved in an
intervention in Yemen, aimed at restoring the former president, Abdu
Rabbu Mansour Hadi, to power. The intervention's U.S.-supported bombing
campaign has come under heavy criticism for repeatedly destroying
civilian structures, including homes, markets, factories, water
treatment plants, schools, and hospitals.

Menendez previously held up \$2 billion in sales of precision-guided
bombs to Saudi Arabia and the UAE over human rights concerns.

In the past, presidents who invoked the provision have been able to
point to time-sensitive emergencies that justified going around
Congress. In the days after Saddam Hussein invaded Kuwait in 1990, for
example, President George H.W. Bush invoked it to transfer M60 tanks and
F-15 aircraft to Saudi Arabia to secure its northeastern border.

Connecticut Democratic Sen. Chris Murphy, who warned days ago that
**[[the Trump admin]{.mark}istration [would]{.mark} [try to circumvent
Congress]{.mark}]{.underline}**, said that **[President Donald
[Trump]{.mark} [is]{.mark} only [using]{.mark} the [loophole]{.mark}
because he knows he cannot sell weapons to Saudi Arabia any other
way]{.underline}**.

"**[[There is no new 'emergency']{.mark} reason to sell bombs to the
Saudis to drop in Yemen,]{.underline}** and doing so only perpetuates
the humanitarian crisis there," Murphy said in a statement Friday.

The move has also alarmed arms control advocates, who have argued for
restrictions on arms sales to Saudi Arabia, especially in the wake of
the murder last year of Saudi dissident and Washington Post contributing
columnist Jamal Khashoggi.

Jeff Abramson, a senior fellow at the Arms Control Association, told The
Intercept that Congress should have a hand in reigning in arms sales.

"There's a reason why the arms trade has a process where congressional
involvement is mandated," Abramson said. "**[[It's]{.mark} exceedingly
[dangerous because these are life-and-death]{.mark} materials. [It's
good if there's]{.mark} a c[heck and balance]{.mark}
system."]{.underline}**

As still the world's sole superpower, **[[the]{.mark} [U]{.mark}nited
[S]{.mark}tates [possesses]{.mark} [an]{.mark} unequaled [array]{.mark}
[of instruments to]{.mark} [support]{.mark} its [foreign]{.mark} [and
defense strategies]{.mark}]{.underline}**. With so much attention being
focused on the conflicts in the Middle East, Russian aggression in
Eastern Europe and Chinese efforts to assert its hegemony in the Western
Pacific, **[the fact that [the U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates
[employs]{.mark} a wide range of non-military, or at least [non-kinetic
tools]{.mark} [in]{.mark} [pursuing]{.mark} its [national
interests]{.mark} is lost]{.underline}**. Most recently, for example,
the United States and China agreed on the imposition of new trade
sanctions on North Korea in response to that country's test of a
long-range ballistic missile.

One of the most important of these tools is foreign military sales
(FMS). The complex role of FMS is reflected, in part, in the fact that
the program is run by the Department of State and not the Department of
Defense. One reason for this unusual management approach is that the FMS
program involves sales by the U.S. government of U.S. arms, defense
equipment, defense services, and military training to foreign
governments. As a result, such sales reflect the views of the U.S.
government with respect to the recipient country, its relationships with
others in the region and the overall approach this country takes to
mitigating the threat of regional or global conflict.

The FMS program serves many other purposes. **[The sales of U.S. arms
and related items to foreign countries helps reduce the cost of those
systems to our own military]{.underline}**. FMS sales help to ensure the
ability of U.S. allies to defend themselves and support the maintenance
of stable regional military balances. Equally important, FMS sales over
time establish enduring relationships between foreign governments and
their militaries and the U.S. When the U.S. military trains alongside
those of allies equipped with the same hardware, it helps to cement the
bonds between our countries. Moreover, it improves communications and
understanding among these militaries, often helping to inculcate U.S.
values related to the use of military force. **[[Foreign]{.mark}
[militaries]{.mark} [dependent]{.mark} [on]{.mark} access to
[U.S.]{.mark} hardware, spare parts, software upgrades and training [are
more likely to listen]{.mark} to this country when there is a dispute
regarding regional politics or defense issues.]{.underline}**

FMS has been particularly important as an instrument for influencing
foreign governments and shaping regional balances of power in the Middle
East. Following the 1973 Arab-Israeli War, the United States completely
reequipped the Egyptian military. The Egyptian-Israeli border has been
remarkably stable ever since. Sales of military aircraft, missile
defense systems and precision munitions to the nations of the Persian
Gulf have been instrumental in ensuring a stable balance of forces in
that area.

Pakistan has been a recipient of U.S. arms. FMS sales have been
extremely important to U.S. efforts to ensure Pakistan's reliability as
an ally in the war on terror. **[[Congress has appropriated]{.mark}
about [\$3.6]{.mark} [billion]{.mark} [in]{.mark} Foreign Military
Financing ([FMF) for Pakistan]{.mark} since 2001]{.underline}**. **[The
kind of equipment provided ranges from radios, transport aircraft and
unmanned systems to F-16 fighters.]{.underline}**

Recently, the State Department approved the sale of eight F-16s to
Pakistan. Pakistan intends to use these aircraft in its fight against
domestic terrorists. The U.S. and other regional allies have found the
F-16 to be an effective platform for conducting precision strikes
against terrorist targets. In addition, India is pursuing a major Air
Force modernization program. The sale of F-16s to Pakistan would help to
maintain the balance of power in the subcontinent.

Unfortunately, Senator Rand Paul has filed a Joint Resolution of
Disapproval for this sale, something that hasn't happened since the
1980s. The effort to block this sale is a mistake. It will serve only to
weaken the relationship between our two countries even as the fight
against the Taliban continues and intensifies in Afghanistan. In
addition, it leaves the way open for Pakistan to acquire aircraft from
other suppliers, such as China or Russia. **[The only practical effect
that [disapproval]{.mark} of this sale [will]{.mark} have is to [weaken
Washington]{.mark}'s hand [at a time when it needs all the
policy]{.mark} instruments [it can]{.mark} muster.]{.underline}**

for long since the days of Yamamah deal in 1979. David Cameron visited
the Gulf in November 2012, in the middle of Arab Spring demonstrations
to persuade UAE, Oman and Saudi Arabia to buy its Eurofighter Typhoon
jets for more than \$3 billion. Apparently, the purchase would have
saved thousands of jobs in the UK. Cameron pushed the arms industry as
an alternative for job creation in the country. The irony is,
consecutive Conservative governments had terminated hundreds of
thousands of government jobs in the name of reforms.

On June 21, one UK court ruled that the arms trade to Saudi Arabia as
illegal. On the same day, the US Senate blocked arms sales to Saudi
Arabia, UAE and Jordan. The War in Yemen was cited as a reason in both.
Notwithstanding, the UK has already supplied arms worth more than \$6
billion since the war in Yemen began in 2015. Weapons and military
exports to the region make more than 43% of the UK's total arms exports.

**[The [US]{.mark} and Russia alone [supply 60 percent of the world's

On the Friday before Memorial Day, **[[when few]{.mark} Americans [were
paying attention]{.mark}, the [Trump]{.mark} administration announced
that it would [circumvent Congress]{.mark} and sell]{.underline}** \$8bn
in **[new weapons]{.underline}** to Saudi Arabia and the United Arab
Emirates. **[It was]{.underline}** Donald **[Trump's latest attempt [to
give a blank check]{.mark}]{.underline}** to two US allies leading a
disastrous war in Yemen.

UK arms exports are still playing a central role in Yemen's humanitarian
crisis

**[If Trump]{.underline}** **[succeeds]{.underline}** in getting around
Congress, **[these]{.underline}** weapons **[sales]{.underline}** will
prolong suffering in Yemen and **[[eliminate one of the last
levers]{.underline}]{.mark}** that allowed the US **[to exert
influence]{.underline}** over Saudi and Emirati actions**[: the threat
[of Congress blocking arms deals]{.mark}.]{.underline}**

On 5 June, a bipartisan group of senators said they would try to block
the administration from going ahead with the sales by introducing 22
"resolutions of disapproval" -- one for each of the deals cleared by
Secretary of State Mike Pompeo. The effort is led by two unlikely
allies: Bob Menendez, a Democrat from New Jersey and frequent Trump
critic, and Lindsey Graham, a Republican from South Carolina who is one
of Trump's biggest supporters.

The two senators agree on one thing: that Saudi Arabia should face more
scrutiny of its actions in Yemen after Saudi agents murdered the
journalist Jamal Khashoggi at the Saudi consulate in Istanbul in
October. Since then, **[[members of Congress have tried]{.mark} to force
the Trump administration to reexamine its alliance with the
kingdom]{.underline}** -- especially its relationship with Mohammed bin
Salman, the brash and ruthless crown prince often considered an
architect of the Yemen war**[. But Trump and his senior]{.underline}**
aides have **[made clear that they still support the
prince]{.underline}** and won't try to isolate him, **[despite a CIA
assessment that concluded]{.underline}**, with "high confidence", that
Prince **[Mohammed ordered the killing of Khashoggi]{.underline}**.

The Saudis have been dropping the bombs on civilians, so if there is an
emergency, it's a humanitarian emergency

Senator Chris Murphy

The senators' effort, which includes seven co-sponsors, is **[yet
another example of Congress trying [to claw back its constitutional
responsibilities.]{.mark}]{.underline}** On 24 May, when
**[Pompeo]{.underline}** notified Congress that the administration would
move ahead with the \$8bn deals without congressional approval, he
**[cited]{.underline}** a rarely used provision of **[[the
A]{.underline}]{.mark}**rms **[[E]{.underline}]{.mark}**xport
**[[C]{.underline}]{.mark}**ontrol **[[A]{.underline}]{.mark}**ct which
**[[allows the president to bypass Congress]{.mark} if]{.underline}** he
determines **[there is an emergency]{.underline}** that impacts national
security. **[Pompeo]{.underline}** **[invoked]{.underline}** the Trump
**[administration's favored bogeyman: an increased threat of "Iranian
aggression".]{.underline}**

But over the past month the administration has inflated the threat posed
by Iran to US troops and allies in the Middle East and several hawkish
Trump aides, especially national security adviser John Bolton, have
pushed for a new confrontation with Tehran. At Bolton's request, the
Pentagon updated plans to send as many as 120,000 troops to the Middle
East. **[The administration is [using]{.mark}]{.underline}** similar
**[[scare tactics]{.mark} to justify its end-run around Congress to sell
more weapons]{.underline}** to Saudi Arabia and the UAE.

As Senator Chris Murphy, a Democrat from Connecticut and one of the
earliest critics of US support for the Saudi-led war in Yemen, wrote on
Twitter: "To state the obvious, there is no new emergency reason to sell
bombs to Saudi Arabia to drop in Yemen. The Saudis \[have\] been
dropping the bombs on civilians, so if there is an emergency, it's a
humanitarian emergency caused by the bombs we sell the Saudis."

**[[Trump]{.mark}'s]{.underline}** supposed **[desire to end US
involvement in foreign wars]{.underline}** -- in Syria and Afghanistan
-- **[clearly hasn't superseded]{.underline}** **[his [wish to
keep]{.mark}]{.underline}** Saudi Arabia and
**[[the]{.underline}]{.mark}** UAE happy and continuing to **[[purchase
American weapons]{.underline}]{.mark}**. **[This]{.underline}**
willingness to prolong the suffering of millions of Yemenis also
**[[underlines]{.mark} the administration's [single-minded
obsession]{.mark}]{.underline}** with countering Iran. Trump and his
advisers repeatedly try to justify a prolonged war in Yemen by blaming
Iran and its support for the rebel Houthi militia. This narrative
ignores the fact that the Houthis did not receive significant help from
Iran before Saudi Arabia intervened in March 2015.

**[With the administration firmly behind]{.underline}** its Saudi and
Emirati allies, **[Congress offers the best hope]{.underline}** to end
the American role in a war that has triggered one of the world's worst
humanitarian crises. In early April, the House voted to cease military
support for the Saudi-led coalition in Yemen, finally approving a bill
to restrain presidential war powers that has taken years to pass both
chambers of Congress. On 16 April, **[Trump vetoed the
bill]{.underline}**. Two weeks later, the bill's supporters in the
Senate tried to **[override]{.underline}** the veto but **[fell
short]{.underline}**, 53-45. (It takes two-thirds of the Senate, or 67
votes, to override a presidential veto.) But the measure was still a
turning point because it focused attention on the extent and
unpopularity of military support for Saudi Arabia and its allies.

As the political jockeying unfolded in Washington, the United Nations
Development Programme issued a report underscoring the extent of the
humanitarian disaster being fueled by US weapons and logistical support.
The report warned that the death toll in Yemen could rise to 233,000 by
the end of 2019 -- far higher than previous estimates. (The projection
includes an estimate of 102,000 deaths from combat and 131,000 indirect
deaths due to the lack of food, health crises like a cholera epidemic
and damage to Yemen's infrastructure.)

"The current conflict in Yemen is one of the greatest preventable
disasters facing humanity," the report said, adding that the conflict
has turned into a "war on children", with a Yemeni child dying every 12
minutes. The report estimated that 140,000 of those killed by the end of
2019 would be children under the age of five.

**[Despite a majority of Congress voting to end support, American
assistance to the Saudi-led war persists, thanks to
Trump]{.underline}**'s veto. In their latest effort to stop the weapons
sales, congressional critics of the war will likely need to secure a
veto-proof majority. It is a matter of moral and political urgency.

**[[Pseudo-FMS]{.mark} [does not fit under]{.mark} [the]{.mark} [same
AECA]{.mark} provisions that FMS does because [it is not a sale]{.mark}
to a foreign country or authorized customer,86 which may be why it is
referred to as "Pseudo]{.underline}**." In implementing the AECA, **[the

the most current version dated April 1, 2011, [fails to mention

largely mirror FMS procedures, as prescribed by the SAMM, the statutory
authority for Pseudo-FMS falls under either the FAA, section 632(b), or
a different AECA provision, section 38(b)(2). This can be a source of
confusion for export licensing purposes because **[the ITAR, 126.6(c),
exempts all FMS cases from licensing requirements, while Pseudo-FMS
cases are not exempt]{.underline}**. Although the administrative
procedures are similar for Pseudo-FMS and FMS, **[[the personnel]{.mark}

on Pseudo-FMS cases during the last fiscal year went through Combined
Security Transition Command Afghanistan (CSTC-A) and the Iraq Security
Assistance Mission (ISAM). Both CSTC-A and ISAM are under the control of
United States Central Command (CENTCOM). Additionally, \[t\]he
organizations in Afghanistan and Iraq can loosely be termed
"pseudo-SCOs" for a variety of reasons. First, their mission, including
operational advice and training, exceeds that of a normal SCO under U.S.
law. Second, these organizations are part of operational commands,
rather than U.S. embassy country teams. As such, they do not report to
the U.S. Ambassador, but to the GCC \[Geographic Combatant Commander\]
through \[military\] channels.94 Thus, at CSTC-A and ISAM, **[[where
high volumes of]{.mark} Pseudo-FMS [cases]{.mark} [are

role]{.mark}]{.underline}**.95 As the number and value of Pseudo-FMS

The expansion of DOD's engagement with foreign partner militaries over
the past decade has both policy and budgetary implications. These
include the overall size and scope of U.S. security assistance
activities worldwide, the geographic distribution of such activities,
and the relative influence of DOS and DOD in interagency security
policymaking processes. **[Another implication relates to
[congressional]{.mark} committees of [jurisdiction]{.mark}, as primary
oversight and funding prerogatives [have progressively extended]{.mark}
and migrated from foreign relations [to defense authorizers]{.mark} and
appropriators]{.underline}**. Yet, challenges continue to exist in the
development of consistent interagency action and terminology to describe
the range of security assistance and cooperation programs and activities
funded by the U.S. government. Moreover, **[[funding]{.mark}
[data]{.mark} [for security assistance]{.mark} and data on historical
security assistance funding [are incomplete]{.mark}.]{.underline}**
**[Although DOS has long been required to track most security assistance
funding by aid account and on an individual country basis, [DOD has
not]{.mark}]{.underline}**. As a result, **[[compar]{.mark}isons between
security assistance [funding]{.mark} provided by both departments is
challenging, and [totaling the two may leave
gaps]{.mark}]{.underline}**.4 The 115th Congress is continuing scrutiny
and debate on security assistance matters. Within the Department of
State, Foreign Operations, and Related Programs FY2018 budget request,
**[[the Admin]{.mark}istration [is seeking]{.mark} [to reduce]{.mark}
international [security assistance by]{.mark} about [\$2.3
billion]{.mark}, or 24.4%.]{.underline}** Each of the security
assistance programs would be reduced by amounts ranging from 9% to more
than 54%. In addition, the **[[Admin]{.mark}istration [proposes]{.mark}
making changes to security assistance programs, such as
[designating]{.mark} [95% of]{.mark} the Foreign Military Financing
([FMF]{.mark}) program [to four countries]{.mark}]{.underline}**. **[The
remaining 5% of the funds, rather than being made available on a grant
basis globally as FMF is currently implemented, would be made available
to all other countries with a combination of grant and loan assistance
to be coordinated with DOD]{.underline}**. Congress is also debating a
possible increase of Overseas Contingency Operations (OCO) funds for
defense and nondefense, including for funding security assistance
activities in FY2018.

### 2AC -- Circumvention -- Emergency Sales

#### Congress won't stop fighting Trump and is pushing further legislation

  I don't think any card will since it's just truths -- this card has
  some warrants about GOP members getting fed up and them pushing
  legislation other than arms sales

Arabia," *The Spokesman*, 7/25/19, Accessed 7/27/19,

// NS

**[A [Senate]{.mark} panel [advanced legislation]{.mark} Thursday [that
would suspend arms transfers]{.mark} to Saudi Arabia [and]{.mark}
[impose sanctions on]{.mark} members of [the royal
family]{.mark}]{.underline}**.

The bill was introduced by the top Democrat on the panel, Sen. Bob
Menendez of New Jersey and was sent to the full Senate over the
objections of Sen. Jim Risch, the Republican chairman. Risch warned the
measure would likely be vetoed by President Donald Trump if it passed
Congress.

**[[Support for]{.mark} the [legislation]{.mark} [is]{.mark} just [the
latest sign]{.mark} [that anger]{.mark} over the U.S.-Saudi relationship
[is not ebbing]{.mark} in Congress]{.underline}**, **[[despite
significant pushback]{.mark} from Trump and senior officials in his
administration who say the alliance is a national security
imperative]{.underline}**. Lawmakers are frustrated with the mounting
civilian casualties in Saudi-led war in Yemen and want a stronger U.S.
response to the killing of Saudi dissident Jamal Khashoggi by agents of
the kingdom last year.

"**[[We need to have a bill]{.mark} [that has serious
consequences]{.mark}]{.underline}**," Menendez told the committee,
warning that anything less would be interpreted by Saudi leadership as
just "a slap on the wrist."

Risch, of Idaho, acknowledged that the alliance with Saudi Arabia "is on
the wrong trajectory" and told his colleagues he understands their
frustration, but he advocated a more measured response that he said
Trump would support and sign into law.

Legislation introduced by Risch would have denied visas to Saudi
government officials and ordered a review of U.S.-Saudi relations. Risch
said he was confident such a measure would be met with approval from the
White House. However**[, [the committee]{.mark} adopted amendments
[imposing sanctions and suspending arms
transfers]{.mark}]{.underline}**, causing Risch to withdraw his measure.

"We must assert that there are consequences when countries engage in
devastating human crises, act against our interests and flagrantly flout
international law and norms by executing journalists and dissidents at
home or on foreign soil," Menendez said in a statement following the
vote on his bill.

But each time Congress has passed legislation critical of Saudi Arabia,
it has met strong opposition from the White House. Trump used his
presidential veto on Saudi-related legislation twice, first when
Congress passed a bill ending U.S. support for the Yemen war and more
recently after Congress attempted to override the use of an emergency
declaration to sell the kingdom weapons.

**[Menendez's bill will need to be brought to the floor for a full
Senate vote before it can move on to the Democratic-controlled
House.]{.underline}** It is unclear if Senate Majority Leader Mitch
McConnell will schedule floor time for the legislation, since it faces a
likely president veto.

As for the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, Risch said it was time to
move on from the issue of U.S.-Saudi relations.

"There's 200 countries on the planet, we've got lots of work to do," he
said.

**[The debate on privatizing the war in Afghanistan is heating up yet
again]{.underline}**, with Democratic lawmakers pledging to end
so-called \"forever wars.\" The public is slowly recognizing the war\'s
hidden costs and global scale.

In 2016**[, [one in four]{.mark} United States armed [personnel in Iraq

contractor.]{.underline}** **[This means that the war is already being
outsourced, yet [scholars,]{.mark} the [media, and]{.mark} the general
[public know]{.mark} almost [nothing about
it]{.mark}]{.underline}**[.]{.mark}

Because contractors operate in the shadows, without effective public
oversight, they allow policymakers to have their cake and eat it
too---by appearing to withdraw, while keeping proxy forces in theater.
Who are the contractors who actually execute American policy? Are they
equipped to succeed in this important task? What risks is the U.S.
asking them to take?

The simple truth is that **[[there is little reliable data]{.mark} about
this industry]{.underline}**. Without this data**[, s[cholars cannot
ask]{.mark} even the most basic questions of whether using contractors
works better than the alternative, namely military personnel or local

The difficulty with Pattison's argument is that **[while there may be no
PMCs that can compete with a democratic, state-sponsored military for
this kind of cumulative legitimacy, such companies can often compete
with the militaries of fragile states]{.underline}**. It would not be
hard to imagine **[[a PMC]{.mark} that [is more effective, more
democratic, treats its]{.mark} own [personnel better, and makes a
greater contribution]{.mark} to communal bonds [than the Afghan National
Army]{.mark}]{.underline}**. This point suggests **[[cumulative
legitimacy]{.mark}, as an enabling principle, may permit weak states
with developing militaries to hire PMCs that can transfer expertise from
more professional militaries]{.underline}**. Moreover, **[if employed
properly, private military contractors can [contribute to the cumulative
legitimacy of a host military]{.mark} force [by]{.mark}
[ensuring]{.mark} the [capabilities]{.mark} it provides [meet the
standards of international humanitarian law]{.mark}.]{.underline}**
Rather than judging a PMC's legitimacy by virtue of competition for
cumulative legitimacy, it is better to evaluate their contribution to
their client's legitimacy.

#### PSF's are too costly -- life insurance, incentives, and cost-plus contracts prove

**Weiner 5** (Rebecca Weiner - a lawyer and specialist in the
implications of corporate law on military policy, is an International
Security Program fellow, Winter of 2005, Accessed 7-27-2019, "Private
Military Contractors Come with Strings Attached", Belfer Center for
Science and International Affairs,
https://www.belfercenter.org/publication/private-military-contractors-come-strings-attached)//
KK

As corporations, **[[PSFs are subject to]{.mark} private- sector
[mechanisms for limiting]{.mark} exposure to]{.underline}** and
mitigating **[[risk, such as]{.mark} tort liability and
[insurance]{.mark}]{.underline}**. While soldiers cannot sue the
military for injuries sustained in battle, for instance, **[contractors
can sue their employers]{.underline}**. Last year, the families of four
contractors who were brutally killed in Fallujah filed a wrongful death
suit against the security provider Blackwater, alleging that Blackwater
put the men at risk by breaching corporate protocol-and fraudulently
covering it up. If the families prevail, the precedential effect will be
far more significant than whatever punitive and compensatory damages
Blackwater will have to pay. With well over 200 contractor casualties in
Iraq so far, the PSF industry is awaiting the Blackwater verdict with
understandable apprehension.

Unlike military commanders, **[[PSFs must purchase life
insurance]{.mark} for their contractors]{.underline}**. Not only does
**[[this impose enormous costs]{.mark} on PSFs, it [limits]{.mark} the
range of [activities]{.mark} that [they]{.mark} may [undertake. When
insurance rates increased by]{.mark} upwards of [500 percent]{.mark} in
the initial phases of the war, some [firms were priced out of the
market]{.mark}]{.underline}**, leading to no-shows and contract
breaches. **[[Insurance premiums]{.mark} currently account for up to 40
percent of overhead]{.underline}** for some PSFs, **[costs which
[are]{.mark}]{.underline}** by many accounts
**[[unsustainable]{.underline}]{.mark}**. Without regulation, rates will
not drop: PSFs engage in extremely risky activities in dangerous places.
But as these costs must be incorporated into contracts in order to
preserve profit margins, they come at great expense to the industry\'s
contracting partners.

On the other hand, as corporations, PSFs possess the leverage of
private-sector mechanisms for structuring incentives. While even the
most elite soldiers are compensated like mid-level bureaucrats,
**[[contractors are compensated like]{.mark} management [consultants.
The effect has been to cannibalize the military\'s labor]{.mark} pool-in
particular the top echelon]{.underline}**. Lured by salary increases of
up to 400 percent, hundreds of soldiers have decided not to re-enlist
but to \"go private,\" adding to the resentment of the less-compensated
and increasingly shorthanded force they leave behind. The **[[Army
has]{.mark} recently [resorted to offering]{.mark} bonuses of up to
\$[150,000 as incentive]{.mark}]{.underline}** for soldiers to stay.

Finally, there is the **[Pentagon\'s preference for [\"cost-plus\"
contracts]{.mark}]{.underline}**, which **[treat PSFs as if they are on
retainer]{.underline}**-they respond quickly when they are needed,
provide the service desired, and bill after the fact for the costs
outlaid, adding a fixed award on top. **[The result [encourages neither
cost-cutting nor enhanced performance]{.mark}]{.underline}**[.]{.mark}
The rationale for using this form of contract is efficiency: it allows
PSFs to provide surge capacity. However, **[when the surge turns out to
be chronic and constant, [this]{.mark}]{.underline}** logic **[[should
be re-examined]{.mark}.]{.underline}**

In short, the PSF industry\'s supporters and its fiercest critics share
an assumption: that contractors allow for a forceful foreign policy on
the cheap and quiet. In reality, **[[contractors come with]{.mark}
considerable [strings]{.mark} attached, [and]{.mark} these [strings can
prove costly]{.mark} and cumbersome.\]{.underline}**

\*\*FMF = Foreign Military Financing/Funding

What is the Foreign Military Financing Program?

Foreign Military Financing ([[FMF]{.mark}) [provides]{.mark} USG
assistance [funds for allied]{.mark} foreign [countries to purchase
U.S.]{.mark}-made [military equipment and training]{.mark}]{.underline}.
According to the [Defense Security Cooperation
Agency](http://www.dsca.mil/programs/fmf),

FMF helps countries meet their legitimate defense needs, promotes U.S.
national security interests by strengthening coalitions with friends and
allies, cements cooperative bilateral military relationships, and
enhances interoperability with U.S. forces. Because FMF monies are used
to purchase U.S. military equipment and training, [[FMF contributes to a
strong U.S. d]{.mark}efense [i]{.mark}ndustrial
[b]{.mark}ase]{.underline}, which benefits both America's armed forces
and American workers.

The State Department's Political-Military Bureau sets Foreign Military
Financing policy, and the program is administered by the DOD's Defense
Security Cooperation Agency (DSCA). Congress appropriates FMF funds as
part of the annual Foreign Operations Appropriations Act (the State
Department budget).

How does FMF work?

[[Most FMF]{.underline}]{.mark}-funded [[purchases are made
through]{.underline}]{.mark} the Foreign Military Sales
([[FMS]{.underline}]{.mark}) framework. [A few [countries have received
exceptions to use FMF]{.mark} funds [for D]{.mark}irect
[C]{.mark}ommercial [S]{.mark}ales]{.underline}. Foreign Military
Financing funds are budgeted three years in advance, as part of the
regular State Department budget cycle.

### 2AC -- Cirvumvention -- Training 

#### They're wrong --- IMET solves human rights by providing training to some countries.

**GAO 11** --- U.S. Government Accountability Office, a legislative
branch government agency that provides auditing, evaluation, and
investigative services for the United States Congress, 2011
(\"International Military Education and Training: Agencies Should
Emphasize Human Rights Training and Improve Evaluations,\" *Government
Accountability Office*, 10-27-2011, Available Online at
https://www.gao.gov/products/GAO-12-123, Accessed 07-27-2019)

Since 1976, **[the International Military Education and Training
([IMET]{.mark}) program [has provided education]{.mark} and training to
foreign military personnel. The program\'s [objectives include]{.mark}
professionalizing military forces and increasing respect for [democratic
values and human rights]{.mark}.]{.underline}** In 2010, Congress
appropriated \$108 million in IMET funding for more than 120 countries.
The Department of State (State) and the Department of Defense (DOD)
share responsibility for IMET. In response to a mandate in the
conference report accompanying the Consolidated Appropriations Act of
2010, this report assesses (1) changes in the program from fiscal years
2000 to 2010, by funding levels, students trained, and recipient
countries; (2) the program\'s provision of and emphasis on human rights
training for its students; and (3) the extent to which State and DOD
monitor IMET graduates and evaluate program effectiveness. GAO reviewed
and analyzed agency funding, planning, and performance management
documents, and interviewed U.S. officials in Washington, D.C., and
overseas.

Although IMET funding has increased by more than 70 percent since fiscal
year 2000, the number of students trained has decreased by nearly 14
percent. Over the last 10 years, countries in the Europe and Eurasia
region have continued to receive the largest portion of IMET funding,
receiving \$30 million in 2010. However, all regions have received
increased IMET funding since fiscal year 2000, with the levels of
funding to the Near East and South and Central Asia regions more than
doubling from fiscal year 2000 to fiscal year 2010. Professional
military education represents the largest single use of IMET funds\--
nearly 50 percent in fiscal year 2010. Other major types of training
funded by IMET include English language training and technical training,
which represented 13 and 11 percent, respectively, of fiscal year 2010
IMET program costs. **[Training to build [respect]{.mark} [for]{.mark}
internationally recognized [human rights]{.mark} standards [is
provided]{.mark} to IMET students [through]{.mark} various in-class and
field-based courses, but human rights training was generally not
identified as a priority in the IMET country training plans GAO
reviewed. IMET students primarily receive human rights training through
[human rights courses that focus on]{.mark} promoting [democratic
values, and]{.mark} through [a voluntary program]{.mark} that sends them
on visits to democratically oriented institutions. However,
[h]{.mark}uman [r]{.mark}ights [and related]{.mark} concepts [were
identified as key]{.mark} objectives [in]{.mark} only [11 of]{.mark} the
[29 country]{.mark} training [plans]{.mark} GAO reviewed for IMET
participant countries that received low rankings for political and civil
freedoms by Freedom House, an independent nongovernmental
organization.]{.underline}** State and DOD\'s ability to assess IMET\'s
effectiveness is limited by several weaknesses in program monitoring and
evaluation. First, State and DOD have not established a performance plan
for IMET that explains how the program is expected to achieve its goals
and how progress can be assessed through performance measures and
targets. Second, State and DOD have limited information on most IMET
graduates, due to weaknesses in efforts to monitor these graduates\'
careers after training. DOD has collected updated career information on
only 1 percent of IMET graduates. Training managers identified limited
resources and lack of host country cooperation as among the key
challenges to monitoring IMET graduates. Third, the agencies\' current
evaluation efforts include few of the evaluation elements commonly
accepted as appropriate for measuring progress of training programs, and
do not objectively measure how IMET contributes to long-term, desired
program outcomes. The agencies could incorporate existing evaluation
practices, including those of other State and DOD entities, or
suggestions from training managers overseas to improve IMET monitoring
and evaluation efforts. IMET training managers have offered suggestions
for improving monitoring efforts, such as by clarifying DOD\'s
monitoring guidance and strengthening DOD\'s IMET data systems. Training
managers also offered ideas to improve program evaluations, such as
surveying U.S. military groups to assess participant nations\'
proficiency in key areas, assessing career progress of IMET graduates
against non-IMET graduates in specific countries, and testing students
before and after training to measure changes in knowledge or attitudes.
GAO recommends that the Secretaries of State and Defense (1) ensure
human rights training is a priority in IMET recipient countries with
known human rights concerns, and (2) take initial steps to begin
developing a system to evaluate the effectiveness of the IMET program,
including adopting existing evaluation practices used by other State and
DOD agencies and soliciting IMET training managers for suggestions on
improving monitoring and evaluation efforts. State and DOD both
concurred with our recommendations.

in industry as not having much in the way of detail attached.

On Thursday, the department released a fact sheet about the CAT
implementation plan, with a State Department official, talking on
background ahead of the public release, acknowledging to Defense News
the federal agency needed to share more information with the public.

"We wanted to release a public version of the CAT \[implementation
plan\] to show to industry, show to the public all the work we've been
doing," the official said. "We've been a little hampered in showing our
work and we want this to ultimately be an iterative process with
industry, so we can show our work and get additional feedback."

**[[The short fact sheet lays out]{.mark} three, overarching [lines of
effort]{.mark}: prioritize strategic and economic competition, organize
for success and create conducive environments]{.underline}**. Under each
of those headings are a number of smaller action items. The official
said there has been significant work done in each of those areas.

When asked to point to a few key changes coming in the near term, the
official highlighted three aspects.

First, **[the department plans to push for updates to the ITAR
restricted list, while continuing to move items from the ITAR and U.S.
munitions list into the realm of the Commerce Department, [allowing
quicker sales through]{.mark} the [D]{.mark}irect [C]{.mark}ommercial
Sales process.]{.underline}** Several of those changes will be released

**[[Sen]{.mark}ator Bob [Menendez]{.mark} (D-N.J.), Ranking Member of
the Senate Foreign Relations Committe]{.underline}**e, sent a letter to
Secretary of State Mike Pompeo expressing his concern about a proposal
to drastically weaken firearms export regulations, and
**[[announc]{.mark}ing [he will not allow the proposed]{.mark} [rules to
move forward]{.mark} [unless the State Department]{.mark} [fully
addresses the dangerous]{.mark} and far-reaching [implications]{.mark}
of this proposal prior to its taking effect.]{.underline}**

In a move designed to stifle Congressional oversight and weaken controls
over exports of guns from the United States, the Trump Administration
announced last month that it will formally seek to transfer control of
the export of semi-automatic pistols, assault-style rifles, sniper
rifles and ammunition from the United States Munition List (USML) under
the authority of the Department of State to the less-stringent controls
of the Department of Commerce. As part of the move, the Administration
also seeks to transfer the control of the technical information and
blueprints for nearly undetectable 3D Guns from State to Commerce, where
lax regulations will facilitate printing of 3D guns worldwide.

"\[**[[Firearms]{.mark}\] are easily modified, diverted, and
proliferated, and are the primary means of injury, death, and
destruction in civil and military conflicts throughout the world. As
such, they [should be subject to]{.mark} [more]{.mark}, not less,
[rigorous export controls and oversight]{.mark}]{.underline}**," wrote
Menendez.

As the top Senate Democrat with oversight on U.S. firearms exports and
weapons sales, **[[Menendez]{.mark} [announced he would refuse to
consent to formal congressional notification]{.mark} of the proposed
transfer until the Trump administration is more forthcoming in
responding to his questions and concerns.]{.underline}** Specifically,
**[Menendez listed his concerns that all Congressional oversight and
right of disapproval over firearms sales to countries of concern would
be eliminated, despite [Congress tightening such oversight under
law;]{.mark} and that [Commerce has admitted that it will not
control]{.mark} or prevent the global [internet publication of 3D
printing of]{.mark} nearly-undetectable [guns]{.mark} [by terrorist
groups]{.mark}, a real danger to American embassies, military bases, and
passenger air carriers abroad]{.underline}**. Despite the new statutory
requirements on the President and Secretary of Commerce to control
emerging technologies like 3D printing, the Administration is seeking in
effect to eliminate meaningful control over 3D gun printing.

#### Trump opposes merging the lists and Congress can block it with legislation.

**[[The admin]{.mark}istration [is trying to finalize]{.mark} the new
rule,]{.underline}** which would transfer export oversight of most
firearms and ammunition from the stringent control of the State
Department to more export-friendly Commerce Department regulations.

The rule is the final piece of a broader effort started by the Obama
administration to streamline the country's export-control system for
weapons and technology that have both civilian and military uses. The
initiative aimed to give companies more flexibility to export
commercially available items while still safeguarding national security.

Then-President Barack **[[Obama held off]{.mark} on easing export
regulations on firearms and ammo [amid]{.mark} an escalation of [mass
shootings]{.mark}]{.underline}**. Shortly after taking office, the Trump
administration moved forward with the proposed rule.

Now, **[[Trump's hesitation]{.mark} on issuing the new rule [makes him
an]{.mark} unexpected [ally with]{.mark} congressional
[Democrats]{.mark}]{.underline}**.

The change has raised scrutiny on Capitol Hill. In a letter to Secretary
of State Mike Pompeo in February, Sen. Bob Menendez (D-N.J.) announced
an informal hold on the State Department\'s request to transfer
responsibility for the export control of firearms and ammunition to
Commerce.

Menendez, the ranking Democrat on the Senate Foreign Relations
Committee, also worried about the publication of plans for 3D printed
weapons, saying the rule would "open the floodgates of information for
the 3D printing of nearly undetectable firearms and components by
foreign persons and terrorists that intend to harm U.S. citizens and
interests."

The lawmaker said moving forward with the rule without restrictions on
3D printed technology could be at odds with a recently passed law that
authorizes the Commerce Department to develop new restrictions on
exports of "emerging and foundational" technologies. The Commerce
Department highlighted 3D printing as an area of emerging technology,
Menendez noted.

**[[House lawmakers]{.mark} have also [introduced legislation that would
block]{.mark} the move.]{.underline}**

**[But sources said [it is Trump's position]{.mark} on the matter, not
Democratic concerns, [that has brought publication]{.mark} of the rule
[to a halt]{.mark}]{.underline}**.

### They Say: "Congressional O/S Low"

#### H.R. 7080 is expanding Congress' ability and restoring Congressional Oversight

The debate over U.S. complicity in Yemen's humanitarian catastrophe is
coming to a head in the Senate, with a series of votes on the
Sanders-Lee-Murphy war powers resolution. But beyond this immediate
measure, other **[members of Congress are planning to increase their
long-term leverage over weapons sales]{.underline}** to problematic
security partners. Foremost among them, Representatives Ted Lieu
(D-Calif.) and Jim McGovern (D-Mass.) recently introduced **[House
Resolution 7080, the "Arms Sale Oversight Act]{.underline}**," to little
fanfare. The bill's unassuming title and procedural focus should not
escape the attention of conventional arms control advocates. **[If
passed, [H.R. 7080 would expand Congress's]{.mark} constricted [ability
to vote down]{.mark} damaging [arms sales]{.mark}]{.underline}** and
mark a first step toward preventing the United States from exacerbating
the human cost of conflict.

The **[[legislation would]{.underline}]{.mark}** reform Section 36 of
the Arms Export Control Act (AECA) to **[[ensure]{.mark} that
[any]{.mark} supportive [representative can move to discharge a]{.mark}
joint [resolution of disapproval against a proposed arms
sale]{.mark}]{.underline}** ten days following its introduction if the
presiding committee fails to report it. Win the vote in the House, pass
the same joint resolution in the Senate (or vice versa), and Congress
has successfully exercised its primary legal means of immediately
barring a harmful transfer (whether or not the White House agrees).

**[The measure could dramatically reshape congressional authorities over
arms exports]{.underline}**. Currently, due to a separate AECA
provision, only senators are guaranteed a vote on a joint resolution of
disapproval. **[[Absent H.R. 7080]{.mark}'s proposed reform,
corresponding [House resolutions]{.mark} will remain "highly
privileged"---which means that those seeking to stop a transfer at
present [can only secure a vote only if leadership
acquiesces]{.mark}.]{.underline}**

**[[This]{.mark} inter-chamber [imbalance]{.mark}]{.underline}** not
only robs representatives of a vote in determining U.S. foreign policy,
but also **[[diminishes]{.mark} the [efforts of]{.mark} conventional
arms control [advocates in the Senate]{.mark}]{.underline}**. Because
joint legislation from the House is unlikely to see the floor, Senate
efforts can be reduced to signaling opposition to, rather than truly
shutting down, an administration's proposed sale.

By correcting this imbalance, **[[H.R. 7080 will open another avenue to
ending U.S. enabling of]{.mark} other
[governments']{.mark}]{.underline}** **[gross [violations of]{.mark}
international humanitarian and human rights [law]{.mark}s. Nowhere is
this avenue more needed than for Yemen's]{.underline}**
internationalized civil **[war]{.underline}**. There, parties to the
conflict routinely conduct indiscriminate attacks on civilians and have
created a humanitarian crisis that has pushed millions to the brink of
starvation. Yet, it is Saudi Arabia and the UAE, using U.S.-manufactured
weapons and logistical support, that have caused the majority of the
conflict's recorded civilian casualties. Causing further concern, a new
documentary aired by Deutsche Welle, presents credible evidence that the
coalition states have diverted U.S.-manufactured armored vehicles to
unaccountable non-state militias.
