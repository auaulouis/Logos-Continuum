#### The Supreme Court's ruling on Curtiss-Wright justifies enforcement of unchecked executive authority on international relations

**Blackman 18** (Josh Blackman, Law Prof-South Texas College of Law
Houston, The Travel Ban, Article II, and the Nondelegation Doctrine,
2018,

[The citation to **Curtiss-Wright** is important. In this 1936 case,
Congress delegated to the president the power to ban arm sales in Latin
America. While such a criminal prohibition might otherwise be viewed as
a legislative act, the court upheld the delegation. Justice George
Sutherland explained: It is important to bear in mind that we are here
dealing not alone with an authority vested in the President by an
exertion of legislative power, but with such an [authority]{.mark} plus
the very delicate, **plenary and exclusive power** [of the President as
the sole organ of the federal government in the field of international
relations]{.mark}---a power which does not require as a basis for its
exercise an act of Congress, but which, of course, like every other
governmental power, [must be exercised in subordination to the
applicable provisions of the Constitution]{.mark}.]{.underline}
(Emphasis added.) This passage from Curtiss-Wright is very similar to
the quoted passage from Knauff, except for one very important difference
in terminology. Curtiss-Wright spoke of an "exclusive power," while
Knauff spoke of an "inherent executive power." What's the difference? An
"inherent" powers allow the president to act, even if Congress has not
delegated the authority to do so. Such an action could survive Justice
Robert Jackson's second tier of Youngstown. Congress can place certain
limitations on an "inherent" power, which need not be "exclusive."
However, an "exclusive" power is one that the president and the
president alone can exercise. Congress lacks the authority to limit that
"exclusive" power. Such an action would likely survive the third tier of
Youngstown. "Courts can sustain exclusive Presidential control in such a
case," Jackson wrote, "only be disabling the Congress from acting upon
the subject." For an example, Jackson cited the president's "exclusive
power of removal in executive agencies" that was upheld in Myers v.
United States (1926). There are other examples. [Curtiss-Wright upheld
the "plenary and exclusive power of the President as the sole organ of
the federal government in the field of international relations." And
most recently, [Zivotofsky v. Kerry (2015) recognized an "exclusive"
power of the president]{.mark} to "recognize foreign nations and
governments."]{.underline} (As Jack Goldsmith
[observed](https://harvardlawreview.org/2015/11/zivotofsky-ii-as-precedent-in-the-executive-branch/),
though the "majority in Zivotofsky **II** appeared to distance itself
from some aspects of Curtiss-Wright," it did not "repudiate" the
decision.) Did the Knauff court mean to suggest that the president's
power to exclude aliens was "exclusive" as in Curtiss-Wright, or merely
"inherent"? If it is "inherent," the power to exclude aliens inheres in
the president by virtue of Article II, regardless of whether Congress
has delegated any authority and regardless of whether there is a
declared war, or some sort of national emergency. With such an
authority, Congress would retain the right to constrain that power. If
it is "exclusive," the power to exclude belongs to the president alone,
and Congress cannot impose any limitations on the entry of aliens into
the United States. For purposes of the travel ban case, it does not make
a difference whether the power is "inherent" or "exclusive," because the
president prevails either way. Pursuant to 8 U.S.C. §1182(f), Congress
has in fact given the president the plenary authority to "suspend the
entry" of "aliens" if their "entry" would be "be detrimental to the
interests of the United State." This delegation works in either fashion:
as a recognition of an "exclusive" power under Curtiss-Wright or as a
recognition of an "inherent" power that is shared with Congress. In
contrast, Con0gress has prohibited nationality-based discrimination with
respect to the issuance of immigrant visas. Here, Congress's enumerated
power over naturalization is plenary, and the president has neither an
exclusive, nor an inherent power to rely on. As I've noted since the
[outset of this
litigation](https://www.lawfareblog.com/ninth-circuit-previews-why-article-ii-will-save-travel-ban),
there is an important distinction between the power to deny entry (the
president's inherent power) and the power to issue visas (Congress's
plenary power). The government has sought to resolve this tension in
this fashion: People who are subject to an entry ban should not be
issued a visa, for such an act would be futile. The court could disagree
with this distinction and find that the proclamation violates the INA's
prohibition on nationality-based discrimination with respect to
immigrant visas. (With respect to the executive power to deny immigrant
visas on the basis of nationality, see my discussion of the [saving
construction](https://www.lawfareblog.com/ninth-circuit-previews-why-article-ii-will-save-travel-ban).)
That holding would still permit nationality-based discrimination for
non-immigrant visas. But such an opinion would not reach the conclusion
that Chief Judge Gregory did: that the president lacks such an inherent
power altogether. **The Power to Exclude Recognized in Knauff** **was
not limited to "A Time of National Emergency"** [Gregory dismisses this
reading of **Knauff**, under which the president has an "inherent" power
to exclude. He wrote: One might misconstrue some language in **Knauff**
to say that delegating immigration power can never violate nondelegation
given the executive's **inherent** powers. See 338 U.S. at 542--43.
However, **Knauff** upheld a delegation of broad discretion because that
discretion was to be exercised only "during a time of national
emergency."]{.underline} Id. at 543 ("Congress may in broad terms
authorize the executive to exercise the power, e.g., as was done here,
for the best interests of the country during a time of national
emergency."). Whatever the President's inherent powers during war or
national emergency, it does not follow that he has the same powers under
ordinary circumstances. (Emphasis added.) We can quibble whether the
power identified in **[Knauff]{.underline}** recognized an "inherent" or
an "exclusive" power. The quoted sentence on 338 U.S. 543, however, does
not support the conclusion that this power can "be exercised only
'during a time of national emergency.'" Justice Minton's analysis lacks
that qualifier: Thus the decision to admit or to exclude an alien may be
lawfully placed with the President, who may in turn delegate the
carrying out of this function to a responsible executive officer of the
sovereign, such as the Attorney General. The action of the executive
officer under such authority is final and conclusive. Whatever the rule
may be concerning deportation of persons who have gained entry into the
United States, it is not within the province of any court, unless
expressly authorized by law, to review the determination of the
political branch of the Government to exclude a given alien.
**[Nishimura Ekiu v. United States]{.underline}**; **[Fong Yue Ting v.
United States]{.underline}**; Ludecke v. Watkins. Cf. **[Yamataya v.
Fisher]{.underline}**. Normally Congress supplies the conditions of the
privilege of entry into the United States. **[But because the power of
exclusion of aliens is also inherent in the executive department of the
sovereign, Congress may in broad terms authorize the executive to
exercise the power, e.g., as was done here, for the best interests of
the country during a time of national emergency.]{.underline}**
Executive officers may be entrusted with the duty of specifying the
procedures for carrying out the congressional intent. (Emphasis added.)
It is not the case, as Chief Judge Gregory writes, that this power can
be exercised "only 'during a time of national emergency.'" Not at all.
Instead, Congress "may"---and that's the key word,
**[may]{.underline}**---"during a time of national emergency" choose to
delegate such authority, as it did so in **[Knauff]{.underline}**. The
Court was not discussing when the President could exercise the power,
but when Congress may choose to delegate that power. Gregory gets it
entirely backwards. In any event, Minton explains earlier at 338 U.S.
542 that the "exclusion of aliens" is an "inherent executive power."
Full stop. Gregory does not quote this section of the opinion. He merely
critiques those who "might misconstrue" it. To be even more precise, the
quoted passage speaks only of a "national emergency," not "war." The
latter qualifier about "war" was a gloss added by Gregory. And, as I
noted in an earlier
[post](https://www.lawfareblog.com/ninth-circuit-previews-why-article-ii-will-save-travel-ban),
there is still a lingering question about whether the 2001 and 2002
authorizations for use of military force could bolster the case that
such a "national emergency" exists. Indeed, the proclamation itself
explains that its purpose is to "address both terrorism-related
**[and]{.underline}** public-safety risks." (emphasis added). Gregory's
incomplete treatment of this question undercuts his analysis. Later,
Gregory writes "no one has identified a single case adopting what would
be an astonishing view of inherent executive power." That case is
**[Knauff]{.underline}** itself. Additionally, I found several decisions
that cited **[Knauff]{.underline}** for that exact proposition. **[See
e.g., Defs. of Wildlife v. Chertoff]{.underline}**, 527 F. Supp. 2d 119,
129 (D.D.C. 2007) ("The construction of the border fence pertains to
both foreign affairs and immigration control---areas over which the
Executive Branch traditionally exercises independent constitutional
authority."); **[Encuentro Del Canto Popular v.
Christopher]{.underline}**, 930 F. Supp. 1360, 1365 (N.D. Cal. 1996)
("President Reagan enacted Proclamation 5377 based partly on his
inherent Constitutional authority to do so"); **[Haitian Refugee Ctr.,
Inc. v. Gracey]{.underline}**, 600 F. Supp. 1396, 1400 (D.D.C. 1985)
("In addition to statutory authority, the President has implied
constitutional power under Article II of the Constitution to suspend
entry of certain groups of aliens"). Admittedly, this issue does not
come up often---because immigration decisions of this sort are generally
not subject to review---but other courts have given
**[Knauff]{.underline}** the reading that the government and I have. In
contrast, I could not find any opinions (before the instant litigation)
that support Gregory's cramped reading. The concurring opinion fails in
its effort to read a "national emergency" requirement into the
president's exercise of his own inherent powers. Finally, Gregory is
mistaken to assume that the president's "inherent powers" fluctuate
during a time of "war or national emergency." To the contrary, the very
nature of an inherent power is that the president has it, regardless of
whether or not Congress takes action, such as with a declaration of war,
or the delegation of some other authority. The essence of an inherent
power under Article II, is that it can be exercised unilaterally,
regardless of the situation. What does fluctuate, however, are
delegations of authority from Congress. This premise illustrates
Jackson's framework in **[Youngstown]{.underline}**. At all times, the
president can rely on his own inherent powers. What determines whether
the actions falls in the first, second, or third zone, is whether
Congress has delegated additional powers to the president. If Congress
has so delegated, the action falls in the first tier. If Congress has
withheld such powers, the action falls in the third tier[. But [even
if]{.mark} the president is acting at the "lowest ebb" of his
authority---that is, he relies only on his own executive powers (perhaps
those of the "exclusive" type), or [Congress has forbidden him from
taking such an action---the president can still prevail.]{.mark} Such
was the case in **Zivotofsky v. Kerry** (2015). Congress passed a bill
that ordered the State Department to update passports for U.S. citizens
born in Jerusalem, with Israel listed as the place of birth. President
Bush, who signed that bill into law, refused to comply, citing his
inherent constitutional authority over recognition. He, and not
Congress, could decide what the capital of Israel was. President Obama
continued that practice. The Supreme Court upheld that exercise of
authority, even though it was properly considered in Jackson's third
tier. [Congress forbade the president from doing something, and he did
it anyway, relying solely on inherent powers]{.mark}. That is, the
Article II "exclusive" power trumped the statutory regime.]{.underline}
To the extent that **[Knauff]{.underline}** remains good law, the
president has this inherent power to exclude aliens. , hen 8 U.S.C.
§1182 is fairly read, Congress has in fact recognized that the president
already has this power. It provides: Whenever the President finds that
the entry of any aliens or of any class of aliens into the United States
would be detrimental to the interests of the United States, he may by
proclamation, and for such period as he shall deem necessary, suspend
the entry of all aliens or any class of aliens as immigrants or
nonimmigrants, or impose on the entry of aliens any restrictions he may
deem to be appropriate. I have long read this provision as merely an
affirmation of the power the president already had---the inherent power
recognized in **[Knauff]{.underline}**. Gregory reads it differently. He
writes that this is a mere "gap-filling provision that empowers the
President to exclude (1) foreign nationals whose individual conduct or
affiliation makes their entry harmful to national interests for reasons
unanticipated by Congress and (2) foreign nationals in response to a
foreign-affairs or national-security exigency." Neither of those
criteria are present in the statute, and should not be read into an area
where the president enjoys broad powers.. That Gregory misread
**[Knauff]{.underline}** is easy enough to demonstrate. Far more
important is to explain **[why]{.underline}** he felt compelled to draw
this conclusion: If **[Knauff]{.underline}** is read fairly, then
President Trump has the inherent power to exclude aliens, and the
remainder of this statutory analysis topples. In other words, whether or
not Congress gave him such authority, he could exercise it; that
Congress in fact delegated it is icing on the cake. [Panama
Refining]{.underline} **Revisited** Gregory's discussion of the
president's constitutional powers relies on an incomplete analysis of
**[Knauff]{.underline}**. His discussion of the president's statutory
powers, however, relies on an incomplete analysis of the twentieth
century. [Constitutional law students are taught to separate decisions
of the Supreme Court from **before** and **after** 1937. While the myth
of the "switch in time that saved nine" has been
[dispelled](https://www.amazon.com/Rethinking-New-Deal-Court-Constitutional/dp/0195120434),
1937 still serves as a inflection point in the Supreme Court's approach
to the due process clause, the commerce clause, the taxing power,
federalism, and, as relevant here, the nondelegation
doctrine.]{.underline} Article I, Section 1 of the Constitution,
provides that "\[a\]ll legislative Powers herein granted shall be vested
in a Congress of the United States." Congress cannot surrender its
"legislative Powers." It can, however, delegate certain authority to the
executive branch, so long as there is sufficient guidance---known as an
"intelligible principle"---of how that power is to be exercised. Under
the nondelegation doctrine, in theory at least, courts can invalidate
laws that cross the line from mere delegation to surrender. I add the
modifier **[in theory]{.underline}**, because since 1937, the Supreme
Court has ceased enforcing this line. Justice Antonin Scalia's majority
opinion in **[Whitman v. American Trucking Associations]{.underline}**
(2001) summarizes the doctrine well: [In the history of [the
Court]{.mark} we have found the requisite "intelligible principle"
lacking in only two statutes, one of which provided literally no
guidance for the exercise of discretion, and the other of which
conferred authority to regulate the entire economy on the basis of no
more precise a standard than stimulating the economy by assuring "fair
competition." **See Panama Refining Co. v. Ryan** (1935); **A.L.A.
Schechter Poultry Corp. v. United States** (1935). . . . In short, we
have "almost [never felt qualified to second-guess Congress]{.mark}
regarding the permissible degree of policy judgment that can be left to
those executing or applying the law." **Mistretta v. United States**
(1989) (SCALIA, J., dissenting); **see id.**, at 373, 109 S.Ct. 647
(majority opinion). Scalia identified only two decisions where the court
found a violation of the nondelegation doctrine: **Panama Refining Co.
v. Ryan** (1935) and **Schechter Poultry Corp v. United States**.
Professor Cass Sunstein
[quipped](http://chicagounbound.uchicago.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1335&context=law_and_economics)
that 1935 was "the conventional nondelegation doctrine's only good
year."]{.underline} But that does not mean the nondelegation doctrine is
dead. Instead, through what Sunstein referred to as the "nondelegation
canons," courts have narrowly construed delegations of authority to
avoid raising serious constitutional questions[.]{.underline} (In the
**[Harvard Law Review]{.underline}**, I discussed one such canon, known
as the ["major question"
doctrine](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2816726),
at pp. 260-265.) It is in this nature of avoidance that Chief Judge
Gregory invokes the non-delegation doctrine. That much is not
problematic (at least to this
[anti-administrativist](https://harvardlawreview.org/2017/11/confessions-of-an-anti-administrativist/)).
What's problematic, is that he uses **[Panama Refining
Co.]{.underline}** as the proper test for his analysis. He wrote: The
INA provisions invoked by the Proclamation are similar in critical
respects to the statute at issue in **[Panama]{.underline}**, which the
Court invalidated on nondelegation grounds. See 293 U.S. at 414--15, 430
(invalidating statute that gave the President discretion to prohibit
petroleum in interstate and foreign commerce because decision was
"obviously one of legislative policy," and Congress did not provide
standards to guide President's exercise of discretion). Congress, in
both instances, delegated the power to suspend movement of people or
goods in commerce. According to the Government, the INA simply
authorizes the President to do whatever he believes best, which means
that the only source of guidance derives from the President himself, not
Congress. In terms of direction from the legislature, such a
"requirement" may as well be nonexistent, as was the case in
**[Panama]{.underline}**. I did a double-take when I read this. Was a
circuit judge actually relying on a pre-New Deal precedent concerning
the nondelegation doctrine? Granted **[Panama Refining]{.underline}**
has never been overturned. And in **[NFIB v. Sebelius]{.underline}**
(2012), the court favorably cited another pre-New Deal opinion
concerning the taxing power, **[Bailey v. Drexel Furniture
Co.]{.underline}**(1922). But the so-called **[Child Labor Tax
Case]{.underline}** had not been eroded by decades of precedent (an
issue that many in the professoriate overlooked in their defense of the
Affordable Care Act's individual mandate). The rule in **[Panama
Refining]{.underline}**, however, has been interred. Sunstein wrote that
**[Panama Refining]{.underline}** "is a controversial ruling, fitting
poorly with post-World War II decisions, and it is most unlikely that
the Court would follow it today." He was right. And were it not true
when Sunstein wrote his article in 1999, Scalia's opinion in
**[Whitman]{.underline}** proved Sunstein unquestionably correct. Let's
consider 8 U.S.C. §1182(f) once again to ascertain whether it has an
"intelligible principle". Whenever the President finds that the entry of
any aliens or of any class of aliens into the United States would **[be
detrimental to the interests of the United States]{.underline}**, he may
by proclamation, and for such period as he shall deem necessary, suspend
the entry of all aliens or any class of aliens as immigrants or
nonimmigrants, or impose on the entry of aliens any restrictions he may
deem to be appropriate. (Emphasis added.) There is, without question, an
intelligible principle for the president to apply: The entry of the
aliens must be "be detrimental to the interests of the United States."
Perhaps to a student of the English language, this delegation would seem
open-ended and capacious. What does "detrimental" mean? What are the
"interest of the United States"? How long does "he shall deem necessary"
last? But, under the Supreme Court's precedents, this statute is **[well
within]{.underline}** the boundaries of permissible delegations. This
statute is far less vague than other standards that the court has upheld
over the past seven decades. Scalia offered several of examples in
**[Whitman]{.underline}**: We have, on the other hand, upheld the
validity of § 11(b)(2) of the Public Utility Holding Company Act of
1935, 49 Stat. 821, which gave the Securities and Exchange Commission
authority to modify the structure of holding company systems so as to
ensure that they are not "unduly or unnecessarily complicate\[d\]" and
do not "unfairly or inequitably distribute voting power among security
holders." **[American Power & Light Co. v. SEC]{.underline}** (1946). We
have approved the wartime conferral of agency power to fix the prices of
commodities at a level that "'will be generally fair and equitable and
will effectuate the \[in some respects conflicting\] purposes of th\[e\]
Act.'" **[Yakus v. United States]{.underline}** (1944). And we have
found an "intelligible principle" in various statutes authorizing
regulation in the "public interest." **[See, e.g.,]{.underline}**
**[National Broadcasting Co. v. United States]{.underline}** (1943)
(Federal Communications Commission\'s power to regulate airwaves);
**[New York Central Securities Corp. v. United States]{.underline}**
(1932) (Interstate Commerce Commission\'s power to approve railroad
consolidations). If the court upheld delegations which only asked the
executive branch to determine if a regulation was in "the public
interest," then it is perfectly permissible for a delegation to ask the
president to determine if an alien is "detrimental to the interests of
the United States." Without question, such a determination is within the
president's expertise and competency. [[Further **Curtiss-Wright** still
stands for the proposition that courts should read delegations in the
foreign-policy context in a generous fashion.]{.mark}]{.underline}

#### [Specifically,]{.underline} Curtiss Wright precedent leaves the President the ability to unilaterally to restrict foreign commerce based on personal judgements

**White 5** (G. Edward White, David and Mary Harrison Distinguished

[The 1930s featured an increased number of instances in which Congress
chose to explicitly or implicitly delegate its powers to the executive
branch]{.underline} or to agencies staffed by the executive. In the
early years of the New Deal several new federal agencies were created by
delegation, and in two cases in the mid 1930s the Court struck down
provisions of the National Industrial Recovery Act on on the ground that
Congress's delegation of its powers to the executive had not provided
adequate standards for making decisions. Meanwhile Congress had been
doing some delegating in the foreign relations arena as well: [a joint
resolution it issued in 1934 gave power to the President to prohibit
American arms manufacturers from shipping weapons to foreign nations if
he found that such a prohibition would "contribute to the establishment
of peace." One arms manufacturer, the Curtiss-Wright Export Company, was
prohibited by President Roosevelt from shipping aircraft machine guns to
Bolivia, and challenged the order as an unconstitutional delegation of
legislative power to the executive branch.271 As we have seen, [there
had been a long history of foreign affairs decisions being regarded as
"submitted to the Executive" under the Constitution]{.mark}. But
Roosevelt's prohibition of overseas arms sales, which could be triggered
simply by his personal judgments about the effects of those sales,
seemed to resemble the standardless delegations that the Court had found
in the National Industrial Recovery Act cases]{.underline}. Moreover,
the 1934 executive order ending arms shipments to Bolivia was not the
only example of Congressional delegations to the executive in the
foreign relations sphere. A year earlier the United States had
recognized the Soviet Union after 15 years of non-recognition, but the
form of recognition had not been the traditional form of a treaty with
Senate ratification. It had been an executive agreement which was the
result of diplomatic correspondence between Roosevelt and the Soviet
Commissar of Foreign Affairs Maxim Litvinov.272 An important feature of
the Litvinov Agreement, as it was known, was the assignment to the
United States of all amounts owed by American nationals to the Soviets.
Most of the assigned obligations were based on the Soviet government's
confiscation of assets owned by Americans in Russia at the time the
Soviets seized power. The Litvinov Agreement had the effect of
legitimating that confiscation and making the United States government
the creditor of a variety of persons that had owned property in
pre-Soviet Russia. Between 1937 and 1945 the Court decided three cases
related to the exercise of executive power in connection with the 1934
presidential arms embargo and the Litvinov Agreement. In each case the
Court held that the exercise of power was within the discretion of the
President, passed constitutional muster, and represented a policy
decision of the United States government that superceded contrary law
and was binding on the courts. [The cumulative effect of the decisions
was to significantly expand the category of cases that were "submitted
to the executive" under the Constitution. In the first case, United
States v. Curtiss-Wright Export Co., 273 Justice George Sutherland, for
the Court, propounded the novel theory that the federal government's
powers in the area of foreign relations were "inherent," deriving from
national sovereignty rather than from the Constitution, and were thus
not subject to constitutional restraints such as the non-delegation
doctrin]{.underline}e. In addition, Sutherland's Curtiss-Wright opinion
canvassed reasons for what he called the "plenary and exclusive power of
the President\....in the field of international relations."274 He cited
the longstanding practice of Congress's delegating power to the
President to negotiate international treaties, and suggested that this
provided an argument for "the constitutionality of the practice."275
[Both his "inherent powers" theory and his argument from practice were
subject to the objection that they confused the United States's status
as an international entity with the status of the federal government
under the Constitution. [The power of the federal executive to negotiate
international agreements presupposes that those agreements, when they
affected the states or American citizens, are subject to constitutional
limitations]{.mark}. Few [commentators, however, criticized the Court's
conclusion in Curtiss-Wright that the President had discretion to
suspend the foreign arms sales of American corporations at his
pleasure]{.mark}. The Court then relied on Curtiss-Wright in two
subsequent decisions, the 1937 case and the 1942 case of United States
v. Pink, 278 in which it found that the Litvinov Agreement's assignment
provisions represented policies of the United States government which
superceded state law and could not be reviewed by the
courts.]{.underline} Both cases involved the disposition, in New York
state, of assets that had been confiscated by the Soviet government and
assigned to the United States under the Litvinov Agreement. In both the
Court concluded that the claims of the United States to the assets,
which had originally been owned by a Russian metal works corporation and
a Russian insurance company, prevailed over those of Russian nationals
or creditors, even though that disposition was contrary to the rules of
New York state for distributing assets. "\[T\]he policies of the States
become wholly irrelvant to judicial inquiry," Douglas wrote for the
Court in the Pink case, "when the United States, acting within its
constitutional sphere, seeks enforcement of its foreign policy in the
courts."279 Even though the Litvinov Agreement was not a treaty, it
prevailed over competing state law.

C. The Appeal of Chevron in Security-Wealth Cases

Because [the advantages of a Curtiss-Wright framework do not apply with
the same force in security-wealth cases, there is good reason to doubt
the appropriateness of its application to such scenarios]{.underline}.
This Section goes on to consider why Chevron might offer a fruitful
alternative.165 [Chevron's advantages in foreign affairs law begin with
the advantages of dividing decisionmaking authority between two
political branches]{.underline}. As a framework that distributes power
between two branches[, **[Chevron is a system that mitigates the effects
of an executive who fails to act in the public
interest]{.mark}**]{.underline}[.]{.mark}166 Executive divergence from
the public interest can arise for a number of political reasons.167 For
instance, [the President's relatively short term in office can lead the
politically motivated executive to avoid policies that have deferred
payoffs]{.underline}.168 Many policies implicating national wealth and
national security, however, do not have significant effects for many
years. Trade regimes, for instance, can take years to increase national
welfare conditions because firms may have to relocate or grow in
response to reshuffled incentives; similarly, some military actions like
sanctions or blockades do not have immediate consequences. [Because
members of Congress often serve much longer, empowering the legislature
in security-wealth cases can help the state select a mix of policies
that includes those with deferred payoffs]{.underline}.169

Other electoral differences can cause divergence between executive and
legislative choices in security-wealth cases. For instance, [the public
may consider national security more of a presidential responsibility
than a congressional one; if so, a vote-seeking executive would
systematically select security-maximizing positions at the expense of
national wealth]{.underline}. Even if the general public does not make
this distinction, the difference in presidential and congressional
constituencies can cause bias in the selection among security-wealth
policies. [Suppose, for instance, that arms dealers provide critical
political support for the President, while key members of Congress rely
on the support of certain importers.170 In these cases, balancing power
between the branches helps avoid rent-seeking behavior along the
security-wealth Pareto frontier]{.underline}. In a different vein,
**[Chevron's emphasis on procedure---incentivizing the executive to
respect certain established protocols like notice-and-comment
rulemaking---can help decisionmaking by passing on the institutional

nature of foreign policy decisionmaking (only rarely does the executive
face the same strategic security-wealth problem multiple times), [laws
"borne out of experience"]{.underline}172 [can enhance imperfect
executive decisionmaking]{.underline}. A third type of advantage that
Chevron offers arises from the fact that [security-wealth cases often
require negotiations with another foreign party, whether over the sale
of fighter jets or a mutual tariff reduction]{.underline}.173 In
international negotiations, the structure of political institutions can
have an important role in building a state's reputation.[174 [Public
participation and open debate---particularly in fora like Congress---can
send clear and credible information regarding U.S. intentions to other
states.]{.underline}]{.mark} [Two-branch decisionmaking can increase
state credibility in at least two ways]{.underline}. First, **[when the
executive is not empowered to make international agreements unilaterally
but rather serves as an agent requiring approval of Congress, he can
credibly claim certain concessions are beyond legislative
acquiescence]{.underline}**.175 Second, [interbranch communication

credible signals to adversaries]{.underline}. Democracies, for instance,
may be constrained from misleading other countries by the disincentives
of misleading their own public. [If signals to other countries also are
likely to be seen by the public, a democracy's message may be much more
believable.]{.underline} In contrast, autocratic leaders have less
incentive to be truthful to their own populations and therefore cannot
send the same signals credibly.176 [Administrative decisionmaking,
particularly through informal rulemaking, is a similarly transparent
process that conveys U.S. intentions in a credible way. The Chevron
framework, then, increases credibility by requiring interbranch
coordination and encouraging the executive to use public procedures like
notice-and-comment rulemaking]{.underline}. In contrast, **[[the
one-branch decisionmaking process facilitated by Curtiss-Wright reduces
the likelihood of intragovernmental debate that can be witnessed by
other states]{.underline}]{.mark}**.177 Credibility is also valuable as
a means of extracting concessions from other states. **[Political
scientists and legal scholars have emphasized the ways in which [state

process of decisionmaking and as a method of signaling U.S. intentions

useful in other cases,181 this Note recommends confining that subset and
extending Chevron to the remainder.

CONCLUSION This Note sheds light on an overlooked corner of foreign
affairs law: the security-wealth tradeoff. As with the security-liberty
tradeoff, security and wealth are often substitutable goods, with
leaders facing a tough decision whether to increase one at the expense
of the other. While courts for the last ninety years have been content
to leave such decisionmaking almost exclusively to the executive branch,
the recent expansion of the Chevron framework to foreign affairs law in
Eurodif may have been the first step in returning valuable congressional
input into the decisionmaking process. Only time will tell if Eurodif is
the first case of a new Chevron era for security-wealth cases or if
Eurodif will go down as an anomaly. If the former is the case,
**[[Chevron will improve foreign policy decisionmaking and return
much-needed reflection to the policymaking
process.]{.underline}]{.mark}**

#### Executive power over trade policy threatens to unravel the current international trade order - foreign commerce clause-based constraints are key to give the constitutional power back to congress

Trade and security are the two policies most central to every nation's
wellbeing and most critical to every government's functioning. The
United States replaced the Articles of Confederation with the
Constitution in large part to give the nation control over trade policy.
The world's other great federation, the European Union, used trade
integration to rebuild itself after two catastrophic world wars. The
twenty-first century has been dominated by security considerations since
the attacks of September 11 turned the Bush presidency into a wartime
presidency. The 2016 presidential election marked a turning point. As
both the Republican and Democratic parties pursue policies aimed at
addressing voters' economic insecurity, trade policy is once again
taking center stage. At this moment, [understanding how our trade
constitution came to be is critical to understanding how our trade
policy can and will be made going forward. The country's rightful
concern about a host of global challenges---climate change, rogue
regimes like North Korea, the rise of China as a global power---make it
tempting to revert to a trade policy dominated by foreign policy
considerations.]{.underline} Yet as President Obama's ill-fated efforts
to negotiate the TPP and justify it on foreign policy grounds shows,
**[[foreign policy considerations simply cannot carry the weight of a
domestic economic policy that so many Americans of both parties feel no
longer benefits them]{.underline}]{.mark}**. Trade liberalization for
its own sake---the utilitarian idea that we should maximize aggregate
national welfare through our trade policy without concern for the
distribution of the gains from that policy--- is an idea whose time is
past. Going forward, [concerns about economic opportunity, equality, and
the distribution of the gains from our trade policies will dominate our
politics. How those concerns will shape that policy remains to be seen.
Protectionist policies like punitive tariffs and subsidies (for
manufacturers and displaced labor) redistribute wealth, although they
have very different trade implications]{.underline}. **[A trade
[policy]{.mark} [dominated]{.mark} [by the President]{.mark} [is unable
to deal]{.mark} [comprehensively]{.mark} with domestic concerns. [Only
if Congress participates as a full constitutional partner will the
United States have a sustainable trade liberalization policy that enjoys
broad public support.]{.mark}]{.underline}** Nothing legally or
functionally prevents Congress from reasserting its constitutional role.
Whether it will do so remains to be seen.

#### Failure to leave credible options for future trade removes the constraints on great power conflict---Structural change is key, because traditional growth drivers are tapped out

The next generation world economy will depend crucially on the answers
to the following five questions: 1. Has the accelerated growth
experienced by the developed world since the start of the Industrial
Revolution come to an end? Perhaps the best long-range economic forecast
ever made was John Maynard Keynes' statement at the start of the Great
Depression in 1930 that "the standard of life in progressive countries
one hundred years hence will be between four and eight times as high as
it is today."69 That prediction has turned out to be true---because of
the rapid rate of postwar economic growth. While Keynes proved to be
correct, it is nonetheless true that the last two centuries of rapid
growth are the exception and not the rule in human history. One economic
historian estimates that England's per capita GDP in 500 B.C. was
roughly what it was in 1800 A.D. Over the next two hundred years,
however, GDP per capital increased twelve-fold.70 Economists agree that
with the start of the Industrial Revolution, economic growth and
prosperity radiated outwards from Great Britain to the rest of the
developed world.71 The Industrial Revolution directly contributed to
economic growth through innovation, but it also indirectly contributed
to economic growth through trade and demographic drivers.72 The
development and spread of general purpose technologies in manufacturing
directly contributed to faster economic growth through increases in
labor productivity. New technological advances in transportation and
communication rapidly lowered the barriers to trade and exchange across
borders, thereby spurring greater growth through globalization. Advances
in health and medicine also enabled and enhanced a significant
demographic explosion, another key mechanism to increase economic
growth. In recent years, however, the rate of per capita income economic
growth in the developed world has slowed down considerably. [If one
compares the U.S. economy since 1971 to the Bretton Woods era, there is
no denying that, with one brief exception in the late 1990s, there has
been a slowdown in per capita income growth. According to Northwestern
University economist Robert Gordon, at the peak of the twentieth century
U.S. boom, real GDP per capita increased by 2.5 percent per year. In the
21st century, that figure has been less than 1.4 percent.73 A
concomitant slowdown has occurred in U.S. productivity. During the
heyday of the 1960s, labor productivity increased by more than three
percent a year. [Over the past five years]{.mark}, annual [U.S.
productivity growth]{.mark} has [fallen to]{.mark} an average of [0.9
percent]{.mark}. Indeed, in the last quarter of 2014 and the first
quarter of 2015, productivity contracted by 2.6 percent.74 The slowdowns
in income and productivity are [not only true of the U]{.mark}nited
[S]{.mark}tates---they [apply to the rest of the advanced industrialized
democracies]{.mark} as well. Gordon speculates that [by]{.mark} the year
[2100, growth in GDP per capita could fall to pre-1800
levels]{.mark}]{.underline}. This is because, as Tyler Cowen has argued,
many of the drivers of economic growth in the developed world for the
past two centuries are now close to being tapped out: "We're trying to
eke out gains from marginal improvements in how we've done things for
quite a few decades. That kind of process isn't going to yield massive
improvements in our living standards."75 The "low-hanging fruit" of
demographic and trade expansions will not play much of a role in
boosting economic growth in the developed world. All of the demographic
evidence shows a decline of working-age population in the OECD
economies. Japan is projected to lose over a quarter of its labor force;
Germany, Portugal and South Korea are projected to lose close to twenty
percent.76 Trade will also be less of a driver of economic growth for
these economies. Further trade liberalization is certainly possible, as
demonstrated by the ongoing negotiations of the Trans-Pacific
Partnership and Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership. Still,
estimates of these agreements' effect on economic growth pale beside the
estimates of past trade liberalization on economic growth.77 The erosion
of the trade and demographic drivers puts even more pressure on
technological innovation to be the engine of economic growth in the
developed world. As one McKinsey analysis concluded, "For economic
growth to match its historical rates, virtually all of it must come from
increases in labor productivity."78 Growth in labor productivity is
partially a function of capital investment, but mostly a function of
technological innovation. The key question is whether the pace of
technological innovation will sustain itself. This remains a known
unknown. [[The pace of innovation]{.mark} relative to global population
[has slowed dramatically over the past fifty
years]{.mark}.79]{.underline} Consider that the developed world still
relies on the same general purpose technologies of modern society that
were originally invented 50-100 years ago: the automobile, airplane,
telephone, refrigerator, and computer. To be sure, all of these
technologies have improved in recent decades, in some cases
dramatically. But nothing new has replaced them. And even these
improvements have not necessarily had dramatic systemic effects. For
example, the average speed on a passenger aircraft has actually fallen
since the introduction of the Boeing 707 in 1958, because of the need to
conserve fuel. For all of the talk of "disruptive innovations," the
effect of these disruptions on both the business world and aggregate
economic growth have been exaggerated[.80 At present, many of the fields
that seem promising for innovation---nanotechnology, green energy, and
so forth---require massive fixed investments. Only large institutions,
like research universities, multinational corporations and government
entities, can play in that kind of game. Joseph Schumpeter warned that
once large organizations became the primary engine of innovation, the
pace of change would naturally slow down. Because large organizations
are inherently bureaucratic and conservative, they will be less able to
imagine radical innovations]{.underline}.81 What if the "secular
stagnation" debate is really just a harbinger of a deeper debate about a
return to pre-19th century growth levels? An obvious counter to this
argument is that the pace of technological innovation in laptops, smart
phones, tablets, and the Internet of things has accelerated. This is
undeniably true---but the problem is that the gains in utility have not
been, strictly speaking, economic. Most of the important innovations
that we think about with respect to the Internet---Facebook, Twitter,
Wikipedia, YouTube and so forth ---are free technologies for consumers.
As Tyler Cowen argues, "The big technological gains are coming in
revenue-deficient sectors."82 They generate lots of enjoyment but little
employment. The largest and most dynamic information technology firms,
like Google and Apple, hire only a fraction of the people who worked for
General Motors in its heyday. At the same time, Internet-based content
has eroded the financial viability of other parts of the economy.
Content-providing sectors---such as music, entertainment, and
journalism---have suffered directly. The growth of "sharing economy"
firms like Uber and Airbnb that develop peer-to-peer markets are causing
similar levels of creative disruption to the travel Five Known Unknowns
about the Next Generation Global Political Economy Project on
International Order and Strategy at BROOKINGS 13 and tourism sectors.83
The rapid acceleration of automation is also leading to debates about
whether the "lump of labor" fallacy remains a fallacy---in other words,
whether displaced workers will be able to find new employment.84 A
slow-growth economic trajectory also creates policy problems that
increase the likelihood of even slower growth. Higher growth is a
political palliative that makes structural reforms easier. For example,
Germany prides itself on the "Hartz reforms" to its labor markets last
decade, and has advocated similar policies for the rest of the Eurozone
since the start of the 2008 financial crisis. But the Hartz reforms were
accomplished during a global economic upswing, boosting German exports
and cushioning the shortterm cost of the reforms themselves. In a
low-growth world, other economies will be understandably reluctant to
engage in such reforms. It is possible that concerns about a radical
growth slowdown are exaggerated. In 1987, Robert Solow famously said,
"You can see the computer age everywhere but in the productivity
statistics."85 A decade later, the late 1990s productivity surge was in
full bloom. Economists are furiously debating whether the visible
innovations in the information sector are leading to productivity
advances that are simply going undetected in the current productivity
statistics.86 Google's chief economist Hal Varian, echoing Solow from a
generation ago, asserts that "there is a lack of appreciation for what's
happening in Silicon Valley, because we don't have a good way to measure
it."87 It is also possible that current innovations will only lead to
gains in labor productivity a decade from now. The OECD argues that the
productivity problem resides in firms far from the leading edge failing
to adopt new technologies and systems.88 There are plenty of sectors,
such as health or education, in which technological innovations can
yield significant productivity gains. It would foolhardy to predict the
end of radical innovations. But the possibility of a technological
slowdown is a significant "known unknown." And if such a slowdown
occurs, it would have catastrophic effects on the public finances of the
OECD economies. Most of the developed world will have to support
disproportionately large numbers of pensioners by 2036; slower-growing
economies will worsen the debtto-GDP ratios of most of these economies,
causing further macroeconomic stresses---and, potentially, political
unrest from increasingly stringent budget constraints.89 2. Are there
hard constraints on the ability of the developing world to converge to
developed-country living standards? One of the common predictions made
for the next generation economy is that China will displace the United
States as the world's biggest economy. This is a synecdoche of the
deeper forecast that per capita incomes in developing countries will
slowly converge towards the living standards of the advance
industrialized democracies. The OECD's Looking to 2060 report is based
on "a tendency of GDP per capita to converge across countries" even if
that convergence is slow-moving. The EIU's long-term macroeconomic
forecast predicts that China's per capita income will approximate
Japan's by 2050.90 The Carnegie Endowment's World Order in 2050 report
presumes that total factor productivity gains in the developing world
will be significantly higher than countries on the technological
frontier. Looking at the previous twenty years of economic growth, Kemal
Dervis posited that by 2030, "The rather stark division of the world
into 'advanced' and 'poor' economies that began with the industrial
revolution will end, ceding to a much more differentiated and multipolar
world economy."91 Intuitively, this seems rational. The theory is that
developing countries have lower incomes primarily because they are
capital-deficient and because their economies operate further away from
technological frontier. The gains from physical and human capital
investment in the developing world should be greater than in the
developed world. From Alexander Gerschenkron forward, development
economists have presumed that there are some growth advantages to
"economic backwardness"92 This intuitive logic, however, is somewhat
contradicted by the "middle income trap." [Barry Eichengreen, Donghyun
Park, and Kwanho Shin have argued in a series of papers that as an
economy's GDP per capita hits close to \$10,000, and then again at
\$16,000, growth slowdowns commence.93 This makes it very difficult for
these economies to converge towards the per capita income levels of the
advanced industrialized states. History bears this out. There is a
powerful correlation between a country's GDP per capita in 1960 and that
country's per capita income in 2008. In fact, more countries that were
middle income in 1960 had become relatively poorer than had joined the
ranks of the rich economies. To be sure, there have been success
stories, such as South Korea, Singapore, and Israel. But other success
stories, such as Greece, look increasingly fragile. Lant Prichett and
Lawrence Summers conclude that "past performance is no guarantee of
future performance.]{.underline} Regression to the mean is the single
most robust and empirical relevant fact about cross-national growth
rates."94 Post-2008 growth performance of the established and emerging
markets matches this assessment. While most of the developing world
experienced rapid growth in the previous decade, the BRICS have run into
roadblocks. Since the collapse of Lehman Brothers, these economies are
looking less likely to converge with the developed world. During the
Great Recession, the non-Chinese BRICS---India, Russia, Brazil, and
South Africa---have not seen their relative share of the global economy
increase at all.95 China's growth has also slowed down dramatically over
the past few years. [Recent and massive outflows of capital suggests
that the Chinese economy is headed for a significant market correction.
The [collapse of commodity prices removed another source of economic
growth]{.mark} in the developing world.]{.underline} By 2015, the gap
between developing country growth and developed country growth had
narrowed to its lowest level in the 21st century.96 What explains the
middle income trap? Eichengreen, Park and Shin suggest that "slowdowns
coincide with the point in the growth process where it is no longer
possible to boost productivity by shifting additional workers from
agriculture to industry and where the gains from importing foreign
technology diminish."97 But that is insufficient to explain why the
slowdowns in growth have been so dramatic and widespread. There are
multiple candidate explanations. One argument, consistent with Paul
Krugman's deconstruction of the previous East Asia "miracle,"98 is that
much of this growth was based on unsustainable levels of ill-conceived
capital investment. Economies that allocate large shares of GDP to
investment can generate high growth rates, particularly in
capital-deficient countries. The sustainability of those growth rates
depends on whether the investments are productive or unproductive. For
example, high levels of Soviet economic growth in the 1950s and 1960s
masked the degree to which this capital was misallocated. As Krugman
noted, a lesser though similar phenomenon took place in the Asian tigers
in the 1990s. It is plausible that China has been experiencing the same
illusory growth-from-bad-investment problem. Reports of overinvestment
in infrastructure and "ghost cities" are rampant; according to two
Chinese government researchers, the country wasted an estimated \$6.8
trillion in "ineffective investment" between 2009 and 2013 alone.99 A
political explanation would be rooted in the fact that many emerging
markets lack the political and institutional capabilities to sustain
continued growth. Daron Acemoğlu and James Robinson argue that modern
economies are based on either "extractive institutions" or "inclusive
institutions."100 Governments based on extractive institutions can
generate higher rates of growth than governments without any effective
structures. It is not surprising, for example, that post-Maoist Chinese
economic growth has far outstripped Maoist-era rates of growth.
Inclusive institutions are open to a wider array of citizens, and
therefore more democratic. Acemoğlu and Robinson argue that economies
based on inclusive institutions will outperform those based on
extractive institutions. Inclusive institutions are less likely to be
prone to corruption, more able to credibly commit to the rule of law,
and more likely to invest in the necessary public goods for broad-based
economic growth. Similarly, Pritchett and Summers conclude that
institutional quality has a powerful and long-lasting effect on economic
growth---and that "salient characteristics of China---high levels of
state control and corruption along with high measures of authoritarian
rule---make a discontinuous decline in growth even more likely than
general experience would suggest."101 A more forward-looking explanation
is that the changing nature of manufacturing has badly disrupted the
20th century pathway for economic development. For decades, the
principal blueprint for developing economies to become developed was to
specialize in industrial sectors where low-cost labor offered a
comparative advantage. The resulting growth from export promotion would
then spill over into upstream and downstream sectors, creating new
job-creating sectors. Globalization, however, has already generated
tremendous productivity gains in manufacturing---to the point where
industrial sectors do not create the same amount of employment
opportunities that they used to.102 Like agriculture in the developed
world, manufacturing has become so productive that it does not need that
many workers. As a result, many developing economies suffer from what
Dani Rodrik labels "premature deindustrialization." If Rodrik is
correct, then going forward, manufacturing will fail to jump-start
developing economies into higher growth trajectories---and the political
effects that have traditionally come with industrialization will also be
stunted.103 Both the middle-income trap and the regression to the mean
observation are empirical observations about the past. There is no
guaranteeing that these empirical regularities will hold for the future.
Indeed, China's astonishing growth rate over the past 30 years is a
direct contradiction of the regression to the mean phenomenon. It is
possible that over time the convergence hypothesis swamps the myriad
explanations listed above for continued divergence. But in sketching out
the next generation global economy, the implications of whether
regression to the mean will dominate the convergence hypothesis are
massive. Looking at China and India alone, the gap in projections
between a continuation of past growth trends and regression to the mean
is equivalent to \$42 trillion---more than half of global economic
output in 2015.104 This gap is significant enough to matter not just to
China and India, but to the world economy. [As with the developed world,
a [growth slowdown]{.mark} in the developing world [can have a feedback
effect]{.mark} that [makes]{.mark} more [growth-friendly reforms more
difficult]{.mark} to accomplish. As]{.underline} Chinese economic growth
has slowed, Chinese leader Xi Jinping's economic reform plans have
stalled out in favor of more political repression. Follows the recent
playbook of Russian President Vladimir Putin, who has added diversionary
war as another distracting tactic from negative economic growth.
Short-term steps towards political repression will make politically
risky steps towards economic reform that less palatable in the future.
Instead, the advanced developing economies seem set to double down on
strategies that yield less economic growth over time. [3.]{.underline}
Will geopolitical rivalries or technological innovation alter the
patterns of economic interdependence? Multiple scholars have observed a
secular decline in interstate violence in recent decades.105 The Kantian
triad of more democracies, stronger multilateral institutions, and
greater levels of cross-border trade is well known. In recent years,
international relations theorists have stressed that commercial
interdependence is a bigger driver of this phenomenon than previously
thought[.106 The [liberal logic is straightforward]{.mark}. The
[benefits of cross-border exchange and]{.mark} economic [interdependence
act]{.mark} [as a powerful brake on]{.mark} the utility of [violence in
international politics]{.mark}]{.underline}. The global suply chain and
"just in time" delivery systems have further imbricated national
economies into the international system. This creates incentives for
governments to preserve an open economy even during times of crisis. The
more that a country's economy was enmeshed in the global supply chain,
for example, the less likely it was to raise tariffs after the 2008
financial crisis.107 Similarly, global financiers are strongly
interested in minimizing political risk; historically, the financial
sector has staunchly opposed initiating the use of force in world
politics.108 Even militarily powerful actors must be wary of alienating
global capital. [Globalization therefore creates powerful pressures on
governments not to close off their economies through protectionism or
military aggression]{.underline}. Interdependence can also tamp down
conflicts that would otherwise be likely to break out during a great
power transition. Of the 15 times a rising power has emerged to
challenge a ruling power between 1500 and 2000, war broke out 11
times.109 Despite these odds, China's recent rise to great power status
has elevated tensions without leading to anything approaching war. It
could be argued that the Sino-American economic relationship is so deep
that it has tamped down the great power conflict that would otherwise
have been in full bloom over the past two decades. Instead, both China
and the United States have taken pains to talk about the need for a new
kind of great power relationship. Interdependence can help to reduce the
likelihood of an extreme event---such as a great power war---from taking
place. Will this be true for the next generation economy as well? The
two other legs of the Kantian triad---democratization and
multilateralism---are facing their own problems in the wake of the 2008
financial crisis.110 Economic openness survived the negative shock of
the 2008 financial crisis, which suggests that the logic of commercial
liberalism will continue to hold with equal force going forward. [But
some international relations scholars doubt the power of globalization's
pacifying effects, arguing that interdependence is not a powerful
constraint.111 Other analysts go further, arguing that [globalization
exacerbates financial volatility]{.mark}---which in turn can [lead to
political instability and violence]{.mark}.112 A different
counterargument is that the continued growth of interdependence will
stall out. Since 2008, for example, the [growth in global trade flows
has been muted]{.mark}, and global [capital flows are]{.mark} still
considerably [smaller]{.mark} than they were in the pre-crisis
era.]{.underline} In trade, this reflects a pre-crisis trend. Between
1950 and 2000, trade grew, on average, more than twice as fast as global
economic output. In the 2000s, however, trade only grew about 30 percent
more than output.113 In 2012 and 2013, trade grew less than economic
output. [The McKinsey Global Institute estimates that global flows as a
percentage of output have fallen from 53 percent in 2007 to 39 percent
in 2014.114 While the stock of interdependence remains high, the flow
has [slowed to a trickle]{.mark}. The Financial Times has suggested that
the global economy has hit "peak trade."115 If economic growth continues
to outstrip trade, then the level of interdependence will slowly
decline, thereby weakening the liberal constraint on great power
conflicts]{.underline}. And there are several reasons to posit why
interdependence might stall out. One possibility is due to [innovations
reducing the need for traded goods.]{.underline} For example, in the
last decade, higher energy prices in the United States triggered
investments into conservation, alternative forms of energy, and
unconventional sources of hydrocarbons. All of these steps reduced the
U.S. demand for imported energy. A future in which compact fusion
engines are developed would further reduce the need for imported energy
even more.116 [A more radical possibility is the development of
technologies that reduce the need for physical trade across
borders]{.underline}. Digital manufacturing will cause the relocation of
production facilities closer to end-user markets, shortening the global
supply chain.117 [An even more radical discontinuity would come from the
wholesale diffusion of 3-D printing. The ability of a single printer to
produce multiple component parts of a larger manufactured good
eliminates the need for a global supply chain.]{.underline} As Richard
Baldwin notes, "Supply chain unbundling is driven by a fundamental
trade-off between the gains from specialization and the costs of
dispersal. This would be seriously undermined by radical advances in the
direction of mass customization and 3D printing by sophisticated
machines...To put it sharply, transmission of data would substitute for
transportation of goods."118 As 3-D printing technology improves, the
need for large economies to import anything other than raw materials
concomitantly declines.119 [Geopolitical ambitions could reduce economic
interdependence even further.120 [Russia and China have
territorial]{.mark} and quasi-territorial [ambitions]{.mark} beyond
their recognized borders, and the United States has attempted to counter
what it sees as revisionist behavior by both countries. In a low-growth
world, it is possible that leaders of [either country would choose to
prioritize]{.mark} their [nationalist ambitions over economic
growth]{.mark}. More generally, it could be that the [expectation of
future gains]{.mark} from interdependence---rather than existing levels
of interdependence---[constrains great power bellicosity]{.mark}.121 [If
great powers expect]{.mark} that the [future benefits]{.mark} of
international trade and investment [will wane]{.mark}, then commercial
constraints on revisionist behavior will lessen. All else equal, [this
increases the likelihood of great power conflict going
forward]{.mark}.]{.underline}

all demonstrated that Trump was planning on following through on his
protectionist campaign rhetoric.

While Trump's [**[attack on free trade has important implications for
American and global economies, it will also have an impact on the
likelihood of war between the great powers]{.underline}**.]{.mark}

As discussed here previously, President Trump sees the world in [zero
sum
terms](https://niskanencenter.org/blog/trumps-transactional-foreign-policy/).
Absent disproportionate economic gains for the United States,
international agreements cannot be considered successful. However
beneficial such arrangements prove to be for all involved, Trump's
mercantilist outlook sees them as a raw deal for Americans.

It is not surprising therefore, that U.S. Treasury Secretary Steve
Mnuchin nixed attempts to include language supporting free trade in a
statement from a G-20 meeting in Baden-Baden, Germany. As CNN
[reported](http://money.cnn.com/2017/03/18/news/economy/g20-trade-protectionism-trump-germany/),
while the statement included some positive words on trade, "conspicuous
by its absence was the phrase 'we will resist all forms of
protectionism' that was contained in the communiqué from the last
meeting of the group in China, July 2016." Mnuchin rejected the idea
that the omission was meaningful, but **t[he unwillingness to reaffirm
American opposition to protectionism ignores that trade provides
benefits beyond the global economy. Specifically, [the expectation of
future trade affects the likelihood of war and
peace.]{.mark}]{.underline}**

The connection between trade and conflict has never been as simple as
early liberal theorists suggested. The idea, [wrongly attributed to the
nineteenth century French economist Frederic
Bastiat](http://oll.libertyfund.org/pages/did-bastiat-say-when-goods-don-t-cross-borders-soldiers-will),
that "**[[when goods don't cross borders, soldiers
will]{.underline}"]{.mark} still offers a good summation of the
longstanding position that [trade has pacifying effects on international
politics]{.underline}**[.]{.underline} The logic behind the argument is
compelling: **[[the greater the extent of commercial relations between
states, the less likely there will be conflict]{.mark} because the
economic cost of war (and the lost benefits of trade) will be too
high]{.underline}**. However, history has shown that states still
sometimes go to war despite high levels of economic interdependence at
the time of the conflict.

In his book [Economic Interdependence and
War](http://press.princeton.edu/titles/10403.html), political scientist
Dale Copeland explained that it is not the current level of trade that
is important to the likelihood of conflict. Rather, Copeland argues, it
is the expectation of future trade that determines a state's willingness
to go to war. He writes,

In a very real way[, **it does not matter in the least whether past and
current levels of trade and investment have been low**]{.underline}, as
long as leaders have strongly positive expectations of for the future.
**[[It is their future orientation and expectations of a future stream
of benefits that will likely make the leaders incline to
peace]{.underline}]{.mark}**. Likewise, it does not matter whether past
and current levels of commerce have been high **[if leaders believe they
are going to be cut off tomorrow or in the near future]{.underline}**.
It is their pessimism about the future **[that will]{.underline}
probably [drive these leaders to consider hard-line measures and even
war to safeguard the long-term security of the state.]{.underline}**

Multilateral trade has been a feature of the [liberal international
order developed after World War
II](http://press.princeton.edu/titles/9410.html) for a reason.
**[Postwar policymakers feared a return to the closed economic blocs of
the 1930s that helped drive the world to war]{.underline}**. It is
entirely possible that the norms in favor of free trade are robust
enough to withstand the absence of routine language from a statement by
a meeting of the world's finance ministers. But **[groups like the G-20
help set expectations about the future. Given the connection between
those expectations and conflict, [failing to reaffirm America's
opposition to protectionism could put the world on a dangerous
path.]{.mark}]{.underline}**

#### [Only the plan solves]{.underline}---current Curtiss Wright precedent is unbeatable\-- the Supreme Court must correct it

**Fisher 16** (Louis Fisher, a scholar in residence at The Constitution
Project in Washington, DC, and visiting scholar at the William and Mary
Law School, 9/6/16, "The Staying Power of Erroneous Dicta: From
*Curtiss-Wright* to *Zivotofsky*,
<http://loufisher.org/docs/ci/staypower.pdf>) //uxm

[A 1994 article by Michael Dorf defines dicta as "statements in a
judicial opinion that are not necessary to support the decision reached
by the court. A dictum is usually contrasted with a holding, a term used
to refer to a rule or principle that decides the case."25 He added: "It
is a commonplace that holdings carry greater precedential weight than
dicta, 'which may be followed if sufficiently persuasive but which are
not controlling.'"26 In the case of [Sutherland's dicta in
Curtiss-Wright]{.mark}, scholars have demonstrated for more than seven
decades that his statements about presidential power in the field of
external affairs [are not persuasive]{.mark}. Nevertheless, [the greater
precedential weight in Curtiss-Wright has]{.mark} not [been]{.mark} the
holding but rather [the dicta]{.mark}]{.underline}. A study by Michael
Abramowicz and Maxwell Stearns in 2005 relies on [Black's Law Dictionary
to define dictum "as a statement in a judicial opinion that is
'unnecessary' to the case resolution."]{.underline}27 They define
holding to consist of propositions and paths of reasoning that "(1) are
actually decided, (2) are based upon the facts of the case, and (3) lead
to the judgment. If not a holding, a proposition stated in a case counts
as dicta."28 Their purpose is to develop clear distinctions between
holdings and dicta to be applied to judicial rulings, with the former
given dominant status. In Curtiss-Wright, [Justice [Sutherland's
declarations about the sole-organ doctrine and other misconceptions
should be considered]{.mark} not merely dicta but [erroneous dicta. Yet
federal courts]{.mark}, the elected branches, and some scholars
regularly [treated them as the holding]{.mark}.]{.underline} The overlap
between dicta and holding is analyzed by Judith Stinson in an article in
2010. Despite much guidance from the legal profession, "lawyers and
judges continue to confuse dicta for holding and holding for dicta."29
[To the extent that courts treat dicta as holding, "they are more likely
to reach incorrect decisions, to exceed their judicial authority, and to
generate illegitimate results."30 That accurately summarizes the
influence of Curtiss-Wright.]{.underline} Stinson observes that Supreme
Court opinions "tend to be lengthy, allowing more space for extraneous
commentary."31 No doubt about that. In defense of dicta, Foster Calhoun
Johnson in 2012 looked to dicta as "a unique tool for addressing
injustice, without doing injustice," especially in cases involving
equitable relief.32 Wit[h regard to Curtiss-Wright, Justice Sutherland's
profound misconceptions and errors about plenary and exclusive
presidential power have created a serious imbalance between the two
elected branches in the field of foreign affairs. A concentration of
power in one branch, the result not of constitutional grants but of
judicial error, poses great risk of injustice]{.underline}. To Johnson,
by employing dicta "to announce a prospective new rule, the court
advances the interests of justice while reconciling tensions in legal
doctrine."33 [Justice did not come from Sutherland's dicta in
Curtiss-Wright]{.underline}. Johnson says that the virtue of dicta "is
that it can correct the law without betraying the law."34 That may occur
in cases of equitable remedy. With regard to artificially inflated
theories of presidential power, Sutherland's dicta betrayed the law and
the Constitution. According to Johnson, dicta's virtue "is precisely
this: It corrects the law without betraying the law."35 [[With
Curtiss-Wright the law was not corrected. It was systematically
undermined]{.underline}]{.mark}. Writing in 2006, Judge Pierre N. Leval
of the Second Circuit expressed concern that dicta "no longer have the
insignificance they deserve. They are no longer ignored. Judges do more
than put faith in them; they are often treated as binding law." The
distinction between dictum and holding, he said, "is more and more
frequently disregarded."36 Although many agree that dictum does not
establish binding law, "this rule is now honored in the breach with
alarming frequency."37 The acceptance of prior dicta as binding law
"results in some part from time pressures on an overworked judiciary."38
As to Supreme Court dicta, Judge Leval said [it is "sometimes argued
that the [lower courts]{.mark} must [treat the dicta of the Supreme
Court as]{.mark} [controlling]{.mark}," even though the Court's dicta
"are not law]{.underline}."39 He explained why dicta can provide weak
and misleading guides to the formation of law. First, courts are
supposed to reach a decision after "confronting conflicting arguments
powerfully advanced by both sides. When, however, the court asserts
rules outside the scope of its judgment, that salutary adversity is
often absent."40 As a second point, Judge Leval cautioned that when a
court asserts a rule of law in dictum, it "will often not have before it
any facts affected by that rule. In addition, the lack of concrete facts
increases the likelihood that readers will misunderstand the scope of
the rule the court had in mind."41 Third, another weakness of law made
through dicta is that "there is no available correction mechanism. No
appeal may be taken from the assertion of an erroneous legal rule in
dictum. Frequently, what's more, no party has a motive to try to get the
bad proposition corrected. [[No party will]{.mark} even [ask the court
to reconsider]{.mark} its unfortunate dicta."42 That has been the
history of the sole-organ doctrine in Curtiss-Wright.]{.underline}
Finally, Judge Leval recalled that his experience as a judge "has shown
me that assertions made in dictum are less likely to receive careful
scrutiny, both in the writing chambers and in the concurring chambers.
When a panel of judges confers on a case, the judges generally focus on
the outcome and on the reasoning upon which the outcome depends. . . .
There is a high likelihood that peripheral observations, alternative
explanations, and dicta will receive scant attention."43 Justice Robert
Jackson once described the Supreme Court as having the final word: "We
are not final because we are infallible, but we are infallible only
because we are final."44 Chief Justice Rehnquist later described the
Court's record with greater clarity and accuracy: "It is an unalterable
fact that our judicial system, like the human beings who administer it,
is fallible."45 [[A misrepresentation that appears in Curtiss-Wright is
not a valid source of authority.]{.mark} Courts should not continue to
cite an erroneous secondary source, even if it appears regularly in
Supreme Court and lower court dicta. Instead, [the Court should revisit
a judicial mistake and correct it]{.mark}.]{.underline} The Supreme
Court has a capacity to correct its errors, often within the space of
three years, as it did with the compulsory flag-salute cases in 1940 and
1943.46 Interestingly, the Justice who wrote for the Court in the second
case was Robert Jackson, clearly demonstrating that the Court is neither
infallible nor final. The executive branch has a capacity to correct its
errors. Solicitors General have confessed error in the Supreme Court
approximately 250 times over the past century, with most of the
confessions involving criminal cases. 47 A recent example is Acting
Solicitor General Neal Katyal stating in 2011 that Solicitor General
Charles Fahy in the Japanese-American cases during World War II failed
to inform the Supreme Court about matters directly relevant to the cases
of Gordon Hirabayashi and Fred Korematsu. 4 x The Supreme Court has
available to it a procedure to revise its opinions to catch spelling
errors, duplicate words, punctuation and spacing problems, citation
form, and allow for word additions, deletions, and substitutions.49 In
one case, the Supreme Court released an opinion that misstated who was
President of the United States in 1799.50 With regard to erroneous
dicta, the Supreme Court appears to have little process that enables it
to publicly admit error and remove serious misconceptions from prior
cases that distort the constitutional powers available to the President
and weaken the system of checks and balances.51 In an article in 2014,
Judge Andrew D. Hurwitz of the Ninth Circuit could recall few judicial
rulings \"acknowledging common human error. \'\' 52 With regard to such
errors, he wondered whether the authority of the Supreme Court in a
recent case \'\'would have suffered a whit had it just acknowledged its
collective humanity. If one views the Supreme Court as Olympian, of
course, failure to know everything is unthinkable.\"53 [Whenever judges
learn of significant mistakes that affect the outcome of a case, \"there
is value to correcting them transparently.\" Correcting errors, Judge
Hurwitz points out, \"is not only required to do justice, but
reemphasizes a sad but important truth-that although almost all judges
try very hard to do their best, we sometimes fall short. More frequent
[admissions of]{.mark} human [fallibility]{.mark} will [increase]{.mark}
the public [appreciation of the]{.mark} role of the
[courts]{.mark}]{.underline} and their capacity for human error.\"54

9 The Myth of Extraconstitutional Foreign Affairs Power
<https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/73968483.pdf>) //uxm

[Over sixty years ago in United States v. Curtiss-Wright Export Corp.,\'
the U.S. Supreme Court posited a peculiar notion of the source of
federal power in foreign affairs. Justice [Sutherland]{.mark}, speaking
for the Court, [said]{.mark} that federal power in this area does not
arise as federal power is ordinarily understood to arise-namely, from a
grant of power by the express or implied terms of the U.S. Constitution.
Rather, said Sutherland, [federal power in foreign affairs is
extraconstitutional:]{.mark} \"the powers of external sovereignty \...
if they had never been mentioned in the Constitution, would have vested
in the federal government as necessary concomitants of nationality\....
\[They\] exist as inherently inseparable from the conception of
nationality.\"2 Curtiss-Wright is a **striking departure from the usual
view of constitutional law**, which holds that the federal government is
one of enumerated powers and, as Madison said, \"delegation alone
warrants the exercise of any power.\"3 It runs [contrary to the]{.mark}
plain [language of the Tenth Amendment]{.mark} (declaring that the
\"powers not delegated to the United States by the Constitution\" are
reserved to the states or to the people4) and seems inconsistent with
numerous statements to the same effect made during the debates over the
ratification of the Constitution]{.underline}.5 Not surprisingly, it has
invited vigorous dispute. Much academic labor has been devoted to
proving Curtiss-Wright wrong,6 but none of these efforts has met
unqualified success: despite its difficulties, the case still has
prominent defenders and remains a centerpiece of academic7 and judicial8
discussions of federal foreign affairs power. Nonetheless,
[Curtiss-Wright is demonstrably wrong as a historical
matter]{.underline}, and it is wrong for reasons that have escaped the
central focus of many attacks upon it. As set forth below, [whatever
else one thinks of [Curtiss-Wright]{.mark}, it [wrongly describes the
understanding of the drafters]{.mark} and ratifiers [of the
Constitution]{.mark}. There [was no theory of extraconstitutional power
in]{.mark} foreign affairs at the time [the Constitution]{.mark} was
drafted and ratified. To the contrary, the Constitution\'s drafters and
ratifiers understood the Constitution as the means to give the national
government foreign relations power it would otherwise lack.]{.underline}
Surprisingly, no academic study has comprehensively considered the
1787-89 understanding of the source of foreign affairs power. Instead,
criticism of Curtiss-Wright focuses upon different time periods or
broader issues, upon which consensus has proved impossible. As a result,
Curtiss-Wright has survived despite widespread attacks upon it. Once the
focus is narrowed to the 1787-89 understanding of foreign affairs power,
however, it should be demonstrable beyond dispute that Curtiss-Wright is
wrong upon this point. Further, because **[Curtiss-Wright\'s reasoning
depends upon the claim that the Constitution was drafted against a
background of extraconstitutional powers in foreign affairs, once that
claim is rejected Curtiss-Wright as a whole becomes
indefensible]{.underline}.** Prior criticism of Curtiss-Wright has
failed to discredit the opinion conclusively, in part because that
criticism has claimed too much. First, Curtiss-Wright\'s critics often
address not the question of extraconstitutional power, but the
opinion\'s secondary claim that the President (as opposed to Congress)
should have a predominant role in foreign affairs.9 Proponents of
congressional leadership in foreign affairs have made powerful arguments
in this regard,\" but in spite of the attention given it, the matter
remains debatable. It is clear, at least as a practical matter, that the
President does play a leading role in foreign affairs, and has done so
since the founding.\"1 But the case against Curtiss-Wright need not turn
upon the scope of presidential authority in foreign affairs. [The truly
[radical part of Curtiss-Wright is not]{.mark} its [emphasis on
presidential power]{.mark}, but [rather its claim that]{.mark} that
[power arose outside the Constitution]{.mark}.]{.underline}

#### It\'s a key constitutional question -- Curtiss-Wright jeopardizes the federalist architecture

[The Tenth Amendment reads in full: \"The powers not delegated to the
United States by the Constitution, nor prohibited by it to the States,
are reserved to the States respectively, or to the people.\" At least on
its face, all it appears to say is that [the United States does not have
extraconstitutional powers]{.mark} (that is, if the federal government
claims a power, [it must look for it within the Constitution]{.mark} and
not claim it by virtue of, for example, inherent national
sovereignty)]{.underline}. 39 That command is not a trivial one, for
subsequent [history has shown that, even despite the Tenth Amendment,
courts and commentators have been all too willing to reach outside the
Constitution to find sources of national power - most infamously,
sixteen years after Holland in United States v. Curtiss-Wright Export
Corp.]{.underline}40 Taken seriously, [[the Tenth Amendment is an
important limit on the source of federal power and a vital underpinning
of the Constitution\'s core architecture]{.mark}.]{.underline} But it
adds nothing to the Holland debate. Justice Holmes in Holland did not
look outside the Constitution to find federal power. Rather, his textual
proposition was that Article II, Section 2 granted treatymaking power,
and the Tenth Amendment did not limit a power that was constitutionally
granted.41 The core counterargument must remain that Holmes erred in
thinking Article II, Section 2 granted unrestricted treatymaking power.
The Tenth Amendment has nothing to say on that matter.

B. United States v. Curtiss-Wright Export Corp. (1936) In the interim,
however, [the Supreme Court decided one of the most misguided precedents
in US. foreign relations law, United States v. Curtiss-Wright Export
C0rp.\"\" Despite serious errors, amply documented by scholars,\"
Curtiss-Wright remains a favorite, for obvious reasons, of the executive
branch.\" One would be hard-pressed to identify anyone who still defends
the decisions sweeping dicta.\" Nonetheless, the opinion has continued
to exert a tremendous and pernicious influence on U.S. foreign relations
law. 7 In part, its purported relevance to the dormant foreign-affairs
doctrine reflects just that, for Curtiss-Wright did not raise any issue
of state power relative to the federal government in foreign affairs. It
did not involve Tenth Amendment rights. [Claims about the powers of the
federal government, especially]{.mark} those of the [president, relative
to the states in foreign affairs]{.mark} nonetheless [permeate
Sutherland\'s opinion in dicta]{.mark}.\" On its face, Curtiss-Wright
raised only a question about the so-called non- delegation
doctrine.\"]{.underline} The Department of justice indicted the
defendants for conspiring to sell arms to Bolivia in violation of a
criminal prohibition promulgated by President Franklin D. Roosevelt
under the authority of Congress\'s May 24, 1934 Joint Resolution.
Congress had empowered the president to prohibit the sale of arms to
countries involved in the Chaco War, subject to certain findings and
conditions, mainly that the prohibition would help to re-establish
peace.7\" Roosevelt exercised this authority immediately and issued a
proclamation criminalizing such arms sales. Following their indictment,
the defendants argued that the law constituted an unconstitutional
delegation of the power to enact criminal legislation to the executive
branch. The facts thus raised no question of states\' rights. [Justice
Sutherland, however, seized the opportunity to launch into an essay on
the purported exclusivity of presidential power in \"external
relations.\" In perhaps the most frequently quoted passage, he
wrote:]{.underline} It is important to bear in mind that we are here
dealing not alone with an authority vested in the President by an
exertion of legislative power, but with such an authority plus the very
delicate, [plenary and exclusive power of the President as the sole
organ of the Federal government in the field of international
relations]{.underline}-a power which does not require as a basis for its
exercise an act of Congress, but which, of course, like every other
governmental power, must be exercised in subordination to the applicable
provisions of the Constitution.\" Sutherland\'s assertion about
exclusivity speaks to the comparative competence of the federal
executive and legislative branches in foreign relations-not that of the
states.\" Nonetheless, Curtiss-Wright has been invoked in the context of
foreign affairs federalism because the opinion relies upon a theory
about the federal governments historical relationship to the states in
the realm of external or foreign affairs. According to Sutherland, The
broad statement that the federal government can exercise no powers
except those specifically enumerated in the Constitution, and such
implied powers as are necessary and proper to carry into effect the
enumerated powers, is categorically true only in respect of our internal
affairs. [In that field, the primary purpose of the Constitution was to
carve from the general mass of legislative powers then possessed by the
states such por- tions as it was thought desirable to vest in the
federal government, leaving those not included in the enumeration still
in the states.\" But [in Sutherland\'s view, \"the states]{.mark}
severally [never possessed international powers]{.mark}\" in the first
place;7\"\' rather, those powers were transmitted directly from the
Crown \"to the colonies in their collective and corporate capacity\" and
there- after to the federal government.75 Sutherland therefore concluded
that the states, individually, never possessed foreign-affairs powers:
\"the colonies were a unit in foreign affairs, acting through a common
agency.\"]{.underline} \"By Curtiss-Wright\" as Henkin pointed out,
\"[[the federal government would have had all foreign relations powers,
and the states none, even if the]{.mark} [Constitution]{.mark} had [said
nothing on the subject]{.mark}.]{.underline}\"77 That cannot be right.\"
If it were, Curtiss- Wright overturned decades of constitutional
jurisprudence sustaining state laws with incidental effects, intentional
or unintentional, on foreign affairs. These include, among others, a New
York labor law that imposed citizenship requireÂ» ments on the employees
of government contractors,7\" a Washington statute that denied aliens
the right to own land within the state\'s borders unless they declared
their good-faith intention to become U.S. citizens,\" a California law
that simi- larly limited the right of certain aliens to acquire
interests in real property,\" and Cincinnati\'s refusal to grant an
alien a license to conduct a billiard and pool room.\" Indeed, under the
exclusion principle of Curtiss-Wright, none of the state conduct in
foreign affairs detailed in Chapter 2 would be constitutional.

[Not only does the [one-voice doctrine]{.mark} obscure the varying
constitutional methodologies employed and conflate the constitutional
questions presented, the doctrine [can lead to unconstitutional
results]{.mark}. As explained above, the Constitution nowhere vests
foreign affairs power in one branch of the federal government nor
utterly precludes its exercise by the states. 4 3 When the doctrine
suggests otherwise it lacks constitutional footing and points toward
unconstitutional results. The Court\'s actual practice, of course,
reveals that the Justices have not followed the one-voice doctrine to
its broadest conclusions. Even while retaining the one-voice doctrine,
the Court has recognized the shared nature of foreign affairs power.432
This is comforting as it suggests that the most flagrantly
unconstitutional conclusions that might result from the doctrine might
not materialize in the Court. The level of comfort declines, however,
upon the realization that [the most one can say is that these results
may not materialize]{.mark}. The [expansiveness and staying
power]{.mark} of the doctrine [generate risk that the doctrine will yet
be used]{.mark} to exceed constitutional limits. Moreover, even if the
risk does not materialize in the Supreme Court, the [doctrine
invigorates the executive to claim broad authority]{.mark} outside the
courts [and]{.mark} may provide Congress cover for accepting those
claims. 3 1 It might also [dissuade constitutional action by the
states]{.mark} or more critical review by lower courts.]{.underline}

[[The world is now at its climate's "tipping point]{.mark}" at a
precipice to redress global warming; after which our ability to halt a
climate temperature rise below 2 degrees Centigrade]{.underline} (3.4
degrees Fahrenheit) is deemed unreachable.1 How [[to arrest the
fast-accelerating accumulation of long-term carbon in the
atmosphere]{.mark} is the legal and environmental challenge of the 21st
century]{.underline}. It [[involves intelligent implementation of legal
mechanisms, not technical fixes]{.underline}]{.mark}. **[Governments
must quickly torque the levers of international power, [but U.S. courts
are finding]{.mark} some of [these]{.mark} levers
[unconstitutional]{.mark}]{.underline}**. International climate
agreements have operated poorly to date: The 1997 Kyoto Protocol
concluded its operative phase in 2012, and three major and necessary
covered world powers---Russia, Japan and New Zealand---then refused to
agree to any subsequent obligations.2 The Paris COP-21 continued the two
most criticized elements of the Kyoto Protocol---placing no definitive
obligations for carbon reduction on any nation, and being totally
unenforceable. If the levers of international power are not grasped
immediately and manipulated carefully, experts, including the White
House Science Advisor and NASA's lead climatologist, state that the
battle against manageable climate change is forfeited.3 The
International Panel on Climate Change 2014 report concludes that in
order to maintain world warming below 2°C, there must be a 40--70%
reduction of greenhouse gases ("GHGs") emission from 2010 levels by
2050.4 Not only was a solution nowhere in place under the Kyoto
international climate protocols, but on the contrary, world carbon
emissions each year are increasing rapidly rather than diminishing.5
Global GHG emissions increased by an average of 2.2% per year from 2000
to 2010, nearly double the 1.3% per year growth during the preceding 30
years.6 [To address climate change]{.underline} in the narrow window of
time before the battle for no increase more than 2º C is forfeited, the
electric power sectors of the 200 world [nations are the critical focus
for effectively controlling carbon emissions]{.underline}.7 The
technology exists to dramatically mitigate carbon emissions.8 However,
all world nations must engage in a fundamental shift from the
carbon-intensive methods by which electric power is produced.9 The
levers of (electric) power are the critical controls that much be
manipulated and applied. The most used lever, internationally and in the
European Union, to promote quick implementation of renewable power,
feed-in tariffs ("FiTs"), has been declared fundamentally
unconstitutional when mandated by U.S. states.10 When misused, states
can be ordered to pay the challengers' attorneys' fees.11 Even though
FiTs are legal in European Union countries at the national level, the
record demonstrates flawed and uneconomic use of these mechanisms.12 The
program cost imposed on utility rate payers has caused backlash among
stakeholders and significant financial hemorrhage in Germany, Italy and
Spain, the primary countries aggressively employing FiTs.13 Renewable
Portfolio Standards ("RPS"), the alternative international lever used by
29 U.S. states to maneuver sustainable power development,14 creates a
separate tradable "virtual" credit earned by independent renewable
energy producers, which utilities must purchase at a substantial
price.15 When maneuvered in a discriminatory fashion, the RPS levers

FiTs, net metering, and RPS are the primary legal levers in place to

having to legally remake their programs. Part IV also surveys where and
how these levers of power are implemented internationally. Warming

nations. Part V strategically manipulates these key international levers
of power for the developed and developing countries of the world.

The most used lever, internationally and in the European Union, to
promote quick implementation of renewable power, feed-in tariffs
("FiTs"), has been declared fundamentally unconstitutional when mandated
by U.S. states.10 When misused, states can be ordered to pay the
challengers' attorneys' fees.11 Even though FiTs are legal in European
Union countries at the national level, the record demonstrates flawed
and uneconomic use of these mechanisms.12 The program cost imposed on
utility rate payers has caused backlash among stakeholders and
significant financial hemorrhage in Germany, Italy and Spain, the
primary countries aggressively employing FiTs.13 Renewable Portfolio
Standards ("RPS"), the alternative international lever used by 29 U.S.
states to maneuver sustainable power development,14 creates a separate
tradable "virtual" credit earned by independent renewable energy
producers, which utilities must purchase at a substantial price.15 When
maneuvered in a discriminatory fashion, the RPS levers have resulted in
successful constitutional attack on U.S. state RPS programs.16 RPS
programs are now gaining popularity internationally;17 their costs, as
with net metering, are imposed on utility customers.18 FiTs, net
metering, and RPS are the primary legal levers in place to maneuver an

#### [2 internal links]{.underline}

#### First is preemption: **Sole organ doctrine uniquely enables executive preemption of state foreign affairs policy**

**Fisher 16** (Louis Fisher, a scholar in residence at The Constitution
Project in Washington, DC, and visiting scholar at the William and Mary
Law School, 9/6/16, "The Staying Power of Erroneous Dicta: From

FASHIONING A NEW PRESIDENTIAL MODEL In dismissing the administration's
plea for a President who acts as "sole organ" in the field of foreign
affairs, [[t**he Court**]{.underline}]{.mark} **in Zivotofsky [[created
a variant that seem]{.underline}]{.mark} close cousin, [[without
ground]{.mark}ing it [in any constitutional text]{.mark}]{.underline}**.
It states that recognition is a topic on which the Nation must "'speak .
. . with one voice,'" and that voice "must be the President's."357 The
citation here is to the Court's decisions in Garamendi (2003), quoting
Crosby (2000).358 Neither decision had anything to do with independent
presidential power in foreign affairs, cut free from congressional
control. Instead, both cases concerned efforts by states to interfere
with national policy. [[Crosby involved a Massachusetts law that barred
state entities from buying goods or services from companies doing
business with Burma]{.underline}]{.mark}. [Congress later imposed
mandatory and conditional sanctions on Burma. A unanimous Court held
that **[the state act was preempted]{.mark}** by congressional statutory
policy]{.underline}.359 The decision did not elevate the President over
Congress in external affairs. Instead, the Court declared: "A
fundamental principle of the Constitution is that Congress has the power
to preempt state law."360 [[The President was operating on statutory
authority, not on independent executive power]{.underline}]{.mark}. The
Massachusetts law on Burma represented "an obstacle to the
accomplishment of Congress's full objectives under the federal Act."361
The Court explained that the legislation passed by Congress "intended
the federal Act to provide the President with flexible and effective
authority over economic sanctions against Burma."362 The President was
therefore operating on the basis of statutory authority, not independent
executive power. In that sense, the President was acting under Justice
Jackson's first category in his Youngstown concurrence: "[[When the
President acts pursuant to an express or implied authorization of
Congress, his authority is at its maximum]{.underline}]{.mark}, for it
includes all that he possesses in his own right plus all that Congress
can delegate."363

#### The states can solve but federal preemption permanently prevents transition

[The [most potent weapon in]{.mark} the [Trump]{.mark} administration's
[arsenal for defeating efforts to combat climate
change]{.mark}]{.underline} and slowing the adoption of solar, wind and
other low-carbon energy sources [[is]{.underline}]{.mark} one rarely
spoken of: [[federal preemption of state-based
incentives]{.mark}]{.underline} and policies like Renewable Portfolio
Standards (RPS). Preemption, in lay terms, is the game of rock, paper
scissors. In the abstract, it makes for interesting, if not always
civil, discourse. The harsh reality, however, is it may be the only
efficacious way for Trumptefarians to make good on their promises of
rolling back environmental regulation and restoring the coal and nuclear
industries to more halcyon days. [Telltale signs of a possible
preemptive strike on state clean energy and climate protection policies
are hiding in plain sight]{.underline}. Can Pruitt's promise to continue
California's auto emissions waiver be trusted? [A more strident
requirement]{.underline} in the Sunshine State and its 14 allied
partners [could well mean a defacto national standard higher than what
the Administration]{.underline} and the auto industry [would
prefer]{.underline}. Then there is Secretary of Energy Perry's grid
reliability study. Might the recommendation be to keep uneconomic coal
and nuclear fired generating units on-line as matters of NATIONAL
interest? Will the Final released version include the conclusion in the
leaked Draft document that the grid is more stable today than ever
before? In the following paragraphs, I address what I see as the growing
possibility [**the [Trump]{.mark} administration [will move against
state clean energy programs]{.mark} [invoking]{.mark} Constitutional
claims of [national security ]{.mark}**[and]{.mark} interstate
[commerce]{.mark}]{.underline}. This is the first time I address this
issue; it will not the last. Preemption, from a legal perspective, is a
tricky business and deserves an extended examination. Rather than
waiting to release the several articles dealing with this matter in my
forthcoming book, Earth v Trump, I thought it important enough to post
today's article to encourage consideration by the clean energy and
sustainable climate communities. For purposes of this discussion, the
reader need only keep in mind one principle: [Should the Trump
administration choose to launch a preemptive strike against state and
local clean energy incentives like RPS, it would have a legal leg to
stand on]{.underline}. WHY NOW? WHY IN THIS PLACE? The
[[preemption]{.underline}]{.mark} scenario [[is not]{.underline}]{.mark}
as far-fetched as many might imagine. Dismissed at peril, it should not
be thought of as [[a temporary Trumpian
interruption]{.underline}]{.mark} of the space/time continuum [that will
leave the building]{.underline} when Elvis does. Neither is it just
another name for the raging debate between deniers and defenders of
global warming theory. Preemption is the deniers' best hope for
defeating the movement of society to a sustainable lower-carbon future.
A future that challenges the status quo and threatens conservative
institutions of a certain age and disposition, e.g. traditional
regulated utilities, coal mining companies and labor unions. Once
normalized as a proposed policy by the Trump administration, it will not
go gentle into that good night. Where is the victory in dismantling
federal clean energy and climate change programs only to have them
re-emerge and grow at the state and local level? Since The Donald
decided to pull the U.S. out of the Paris climate agreement, governors
and mayors have vowed to make good on President Obama's promised carbon
reductions and even to make-up for lost dollar contributions to the
Green Climate Fund. Foreign leaders are now attending the National
Governors Association summer meeting. Why? They are looking to negotiate
bi- and possibly multi-lateral climate agreements with states. Governor
Jerry Brown recently spent five days in China on a diplomatic mission.
Just before leaving to meet with Germany's highest ranking environmental
policymakers he gave a speech: I came here to China not because I think
we're doing everything we can, but because I felt that China is a very
important ally in the fight to combat climate change and that we have to
do everything in our power. This is not a time for inertia. It's a time
for radical change in how we power the modern economy. California alone
is the world's sixth largest economy. States pose a significant trading
opportunity for other climate-conscious countries. The graphic below
shows how various states compare to global economies. Picture
​Individually states may not be able to replace the loss of an actively
engaged U.S. combating global climate change. In confederation, they
certainly can make a very large contribution. Again, the question must
be asked: where is the victory? Will President Trump and the senior
advisors---Bannon, Pruitt, Zinke, Sessions, Miller, Gorka, et. al.---who
prevailed upon The Big D to exit Paris permit the perceived disloyalty?
Or, will they deploy the nuclear option of preemption? [The emergence of
preemption]{.underline}--[at this time and in this place--is owed
to]{.underline} several factors: [The]{.underline} depth of [disdain
Trump and co]{.underline}mpany [have for environmental
regulation]{.underline} [and]{.underline} their dismissiveness of [clean
energy]{.underline} technologies [as economic engines]{.underline}. The
[[coincidental interaction of]{.mark} certain [political and economic
factors]{.mark} that]{.underline} together are [[present]{.underline}ing
[a unique opportunity for]{.underline}]{.mark} [the concept to be
debated openly and seriously]{.underline}, [with]{.underline} some
[actual [possibility of passage]{.mark}]{.underline}. The [appearance of
seemingly disjunctive regional markets and security fears]{.underline}.
The [chaos of the current political environment]{.underline}. These
factors owe their existence to the decades-long absence of a national
energy policy and growing divisions in U.S. society. How long [the
opportunity to establish federal supremacy]{.underline} will remain open
is unclear. That it [will not remain open for long]{.underline} is not.
Timing---as proven by the 2016 presidential election---is often
everything in politics. Those wishing to stymie the growth of renewables
and stall environmental regulation understand this and will try to move
on it---just as they have on healthcare and immigration reform. Doors
open, doors close. There is a perverse irony in all of this: those who
would cast themselves as anti-establishment reformers are fighting to
protect many of the most established and entrenched institutions and
practices. If this were a movie it might be called Ahead to the Past.
The U.S. Constitution is specific about some of the powers reserved to
the federal government, while silent on others. The defining line
between state and federal authorities remains blurry, despite the 2oo or
so years pre-emption has been debated in the courts and Congress. The
split between federal and state governments is one of the most
enduringly contentious constitutional principles. It strikes at the
heart of the federal/state/local\[i\] relationship and the souls of the
Republican and Democratic parties. Division of the authorities to
regulate the electric power industry is in the main determined by the
Constitution's interstate commerce clause, the Federal Power Act of 1935
and various pieces of amending legislation, e.g. PURPA and EPACT,
enacted along the way to reflect changes in technology, industrial
circumstances and practices, and federal policies. With certain
exceptions, e.g. wholesale pricing and the free-flow of electrons across
jurisdictional borders, federal and state governments have overlapping
authorities. The mingling of powers often manifests itself in disputes
regarding the extent to which the federal government can impose its
priorities on state legislatures and regulatory bodies that oversee
pricing and other practices in the selling of electricity to end
users---households, commercial and industrial customers. The limited
involvement of the federal government in power markets over past decades
has allowed states to exercise significant authority over the mix of
resources used to generate electricity and the retail price at which it
is sold. Through a variety of measures, e.g. Renewable Portfolio
Standards, net metering, feed-in tariffs, etc., states have encouraged
and supported the introduction of clean energy alternatives like solar
and wind. That many of these policies and programs have worked in
conjunction with federal tax credits and were enabled by PURPA's open
access provisions simply means the energy field has been shared by both
state and federal governments. It does not guarantee a future of
compatible collaboration. In matters of energy, the enactment of
individual state-based policies and programs has produced differences
between state markets. According to the National Conference of State
Legislatures (NCSL): Net metering policies can assist states in meeting
their renewable portfolio standards (RPS) or targets since a number of
states have specific requirements for distributed generation. While a
majority of states and territories have authorized net metering, they
have taken differing approaches to policies with variations in capacity
limits, eligible technology, net metering credit retention and renewable
energy credit (REC) ownership. Not only do the terms of various state
net metering laws differ, so too do the technologies deemed eligible to
participate in the programs. Again, according to NCSL: ...all states
with net metering include solar energy in their policies, they may also
include: wind and micro-turbines, combined heat and power or
cogeneration, biomass, biogas, landfill gas, municipal solid waste,
anaerobic digesters, geothermal electric, fuel cells, small
hydroelectric, tidal energy, wave energy, ocean thermal and renewable
fuel cells. While there are few conflicts between federal and state
programs from either a technological or policy perspective and proven
important to the emergence of market competitive alternative energy
sources like solar and wind, not all stakeholders view these programs
favorably. Increasing market penetration of distributed solar and
mandatory efficiency measures, for example, are triggering open
hostility on the part of some utilities and state government leaders to
net metering and other clean energy and energy efficiency incentives.
Power company concerns arise from multiple circumstances, including:
Stranded assets; Declining retail sales; Grid stability; and, Higher per
consumer maintenance costs. Utility opposition to forced acceptance of
solar, wind, efficiency and other low-carbon power alternatives is only
part of the story. Rejecting the seriousness of global warming and
resisting environmental regulation are others. Each pocket of resistance
is populated by various political powerhouses, i.e. the U.S. Chamber of
Commerce, the National Association of Manufacturers, multiple
fossil-fuel interests, well-healed conservative think tanks, steel
producers and other industrial conglomerates, labor unions, states, a
significant number of the members of Congress and others. Consider all
opposed to the Clean Power Plan (CPP). Now, consider many of them
opposed to states doing what they tried to stop the federal government
from doing. Add to these numbers core Trump supporters, who may have
never given much thought to the CPP but remain committed to The Big D's
personal brand of populism. [There are [any number of events]{.mark}
that [could trigge]{.mark}r Trump's playing the [preemption]{.mark}
card]{.underline}. The Trump administration, [for example]{.underline},
could suddenly [deny California's current auto emissions
waiver]{.underline}. The most immediate of potential triggering events
is release of the Perry study should it contain findings and
[recommendations like]{.underline}: The favoritism shown solar, wind and
other so-called clean energy technologies by the Obama administration
ignores the body of scientific evidence [dispelling]{.underline} the
myth of global [warming]{.underline} and: [Interferes with the free-flow
of goods]{.underline} and services across state lines;
[Kills]{.underline} tens of thousands of quality [jobs in the coal, oil,
gas and nuclear industries]{.underline}; [Prevents America's Being Great
Again by locking down the resources needed to power the electric grid
and the economy]{.underline}; Compromises the security of the nation's
electric grid's and its ability to provide the 24/7 power needed by
hospitals, schools, the military and inner-city residents whose lives
depend on the lights being on; Threatens the health and welfare of all
Americans, opening the nation to terrorist attacks---cyber and physical;
and, Limits the ability of the military, police, fire and emergency
personnel to respond to disasters and all manners of threats foreign and
domestic. Therefore, it is the recommendation of the Secretary of Energy
that: The President of the United States, in consort with leaders of
Congress and others, propose federal legislation re-establishing the
safety and security of the nation's power grid, restoring the health of
inter-state commerce and relieving the private sector of incurring
unnecessary job-killing compliance costs that keeping America from being
great again. The chances of the preemptors winning or losing is somewhat
incidental to the issue. [To truly appreciate the damage]{.underline}
that could be [done by a well-staged effort to establish federal
supremacy]{.underline} in clean energy matters [consider the context
within which the efforts would be made]{.underline}. **[[Time is of the
essence in]{.mark} the matter of [combating climate
change]{.mark}]{.underline}**. Without better information, it is
impossible to know just exactly how much time there is before crossing
the environmental divide between salvageable and irretrievable. The
evidence is sufficient now to inform that [at the current rate of
activity and action carbon concentrations will exceed safety limits
already thought too conservative]{.underline}. What happens then, if a
preemptive strike on state and city initiatives to combat climate change
is thrust upon the scene? Envision the task of having to control the
descent of a monster truck tire down a slope that starts gently downward
and then gets much steeper some yards from the top. If you were you,
where would you stand the greatest chance of gaining the upper hand on
the tire? Right---closer to the top before it gained momentum. The same
is true **[for controlling GHG emissions. The earlier the
better]{.underline}**. Global warming is not a measured incremental
process. A 2-degree Celsius increase in temperatures is not going to
occur .025 degrees each year over the next 80 or so. Warming is a
cumulative. GHGs already in the atmosphere will be there for years.
Adding more---in terms of that monster tire your still struggling
with---adds weight and momentum to the downward movement. Years in court
will stall efforts to slow emissions because neither political nor
economic markets much care for uncertainty. Will efforts in the interim,
i.e. the time between the strike and its being struck down by the
courts, continue? Surely. If, however, we are already behind the
curve...? Well, I'll let the reader think about that for a while. In the
meantime, I'm going to move on to my next article.

#### Second is executive policy uncertainty: merely the [threat]{.underline} of preemption deters investments -- that's key for solvency

**Pástor and Veronesi 12** (Lubos Pastor financial economist teaching
Finance at the Booth School of Business University of Chicago, PhD in
finance from the Wharton School at the Universtiy of Pennsylvania,
Pierto Veronesi Chicago Board of Trade Professor of Fiance at the

Bureau of Economic Research, "Uncertainty about Government Policy and
Stock Prices, The Journal of Fianance book, Volume 67, No 4, pg
1248-125)

In the benchmark model, firms\' decision-making is not modeled
explicitly. Any investment decisions taken by firms are assumed to be
reflected in the profitability process in equation (1). That process
might not adequately capture all investment decisions. For example,
prompted by policy uncertainty, a firm might shut down its operations.
In this section, we extend the model by allowing each firm to make a
major investment decision at time r. To preview our results, [[we find
that firms]{.mark}]{.underline} often [[cut their investment in response
to government-induced uncertainty]{.mark}.]{.underline} We also find
that EAR remains negative, as in the benchmark model.

Between times 0 and r, each firm is fully invested in its risky
technology, as in the benchmark model (equation (1)). At time r, each
firm has the option to disinvest and shift all of its capital into a
risk-free storage technology whose constant return is normalized to
zero. If the firm disinvests, its capital earns the zero rate of return
from time r until time T; otherwise, its profitability continues to
follow equation (1). Partial investment in the two technologies is ruled
out for simplicity.

All firms make their investment decisions at the same time r at which
the government makes its policy decision. This simplifying assumption
captures the idea that firms decide on their investment while facing
policy uncertainty, and the government decides on its policy while
taking into account its im pact on investment. The government and firms
have the same prior beliefs (equations (3) and (8)). We solve for the
Nash equilibrium in which the government\'s policy choice is optimal
given the firms\' investment decisions, and each firm\'s investment
decision is optimal given the decisions of all other firms as well as
the government\'s decision rule.

Proposition 9: In equilibrium at time t, a randomly selected fraction at
e \[0,1\] of firms continue investing in their risky technologies, while
the remaining firms disinvest and park their capital in the risk-free
technology. The government changes its policy if and only if

gr \< g(c,ar), (49)

where the threshold g(c,ar) and th below.

Similar to Proposition 2, Proposition is perceived to have a
sufficiently un difference from Proposition 2 is th fraction of
investing firms, aT, which

To shed light on Proposition 9, we fi government makes its policy
decision as given. Recall that a policy change o This condition involves
functions o value of Bt is given by \[eqation omitted\]

where g = gold if there is no policy change and g = gnew i change. Using
equation (50), we find that condition (12) holds

ecEx{\[aya(x\'T)+a-cxr)f-Y) \< + y}, (5i\> where

e\'(z, T) \~ N((n +gi --- a2/2)(T --- r), (T --- r)2af + o2(T --- r))f
(52)

for i = yes, no and gm =gT, a■\*, = of, gyes = 0, and a2es = ctJ. The
right-hand side of (51) decreases with gT, whereas the left-hand side
does not depend on

gT. Therefore, condition (51) implies the cutoff rule in Proposition 9,
where the cutoff g(c, ax) is the value of gT for which the left-hand
side of (51) equals the right-hand side.

Next, we take the firms\' perspective. At the time of their investment
decisions, firms do not know whether the government\'s policy will
change. Even though firms observe gT, they do not observe g(c,ar)
(because they do not observe c), so they cannot fully anticipate the
government\'s action. [[Firms maximize their market
value]{.mark},]{.underline} which obeys equation (17), where the state
price density rtt is computed based on equations (16) and (50). If firm
i decides to switch to the risk-free technology at time r, its market
value is Ml --- Rx (because BlT --- B\[, so that Er\[\^-B\'r\] = Er=
Br). Therefore[[, each firm chooses to remain invested in the risky
technology if and only if doing so results in a market-to-book ratio
greater than one at time r.]{.underline}]{.mark}

If firm i decides at time r to remain invested, its market value right
after time r is given bym\^s - if \^changes Mr+ = 4+ if poiicy does not
change

Right before time r, the market value of firm i is a weighted averag and
MlrTM as in equation (23), but the weights toT are in equation Appendix.
The values of M\\/RT are equal across i because all fir tical ex ante.
Therefore, if MlT/RT \> 1, all firms remain invested, s equilibrium. For
an interior solution 0 \< aT \< 1 to occur, firms must ferent between
the risky and risk-free technologies, so that MlT/Rx i. Combining this
condition with equation (23), we obtain the co equilibrium with
\[equation omitted\]

The right-hand side of equation (54) depends on ax, which affects both
a\>T and the M/B ratios. If there exists a value of aT strictly between
zero and one for which equation (54) holds, then this is the equilibrium
value of aT in Proposition 9. If instead the right-hand side of equation
(54) exceeds one for all az e \[0,1\], then az = 1 in equilibrium, and
all the results from Sections I and II hold. If the right-hand side of
equation (54) is smaller than one for all ar e \[0,1\], then the
equilibrium features ar = 0, an uninteresting case of no investment.

For the parameter values in Table I, the equilibrium solution is aT = 1
(no disinvestment), so that all the results from the benchmark model
also apply to the problem analyzed here. To analyze the effect of
disinvestment, we reduce the value of /i from its benchmark value of 10%
to 2%, which is the largest integer percentage value for which aT \< 1
in equilibrium (i.e., for all /i \> 3%, the equilibrium has aT = 1). All
other parameter values are in Table I. We set the downturn length to 5
years, as before. We solve the problem numerically and plot the results
in Figure 9 .

Panel A of Figure 9 reports the equilibrium value of aT as a function of
ac and ag. Higher values of ac or ag imply lower values of aT. Fixing ac
--- 10% and raising ag from 1% to 2% to 3%, the fraction of firms that
remain invested decreases from one to 0.87 to 0.77, respectively. The
effect of ac is weaker: fixing og = 2%, ar decreases from 0.88 to 0.85
as we raise oc from zero to 20%. In short, [[both types of policy
uncertainty reduce aggregate investment.]{.underline}]{.mark}

Panel B of Figure 9 plots EAR as a function of ac and ag. The plot is
similar to that in Panel B of Figure 6, which corresponds to the
benchmark model (in which we force aT = 1). For ag --- 1%, EAR is the
same as in Figure 6 because ax = 1 in equilibrium (see Panel A of Figure
9). For ag = 2% and 3%, EAR is more negative than for ag = 1% but less
negative than its counterparts in Figure 6. For example, for ag --- 2%
and oc --- 10%, EAR is ---0.6% compared to ---1.1% in Figure 6, and the
difference from Figure 6 is even larger for ag = 3%. The reason is that
a substantial fraction of firms disinvest in equilibrium (aT \< 1),
thereby reducing aggregate risk. [[By cutting their investment, firms
essentially undo some of the uncertainty associated with government
policy]{.underline}]{.mark}. Nonetheless, EAR remains negative for all
values of ac and ag, as in the benchmark model.

Panels C and D of Figure 9 plot the expected dynamics of return
volatility, \<JM,t, and correlation, pt, respectively, around a policy
change. Both quantities exhibit patterns very similar to those in Panels
C and D of Figure 7, which correspond to the benchmark model (az = 1).
The post-r increases in crMt and pt are slightly smaller than in Figure
7, as one would expect as a result of a reduction in aggregate risk, but
the conclusions are the same. In short, the key asset pricing results
from the benchmark model hold also when we allow for disinvestmen

technologies, deployed at large scales, could save humanity from
catastrophic climate change]{.mark} by providing a bridge to a future in
which we'll have enough capacity to create, store, and supply all the
world's energy from only renewable sources.]{.underline} Now that seems
imminent. The 2015 Paris climate agreement set a number of goals
designed to keep global average temperatures from rising above 2°C as
compared to pre-industrial levels---a threshold beyond which there may
be irreversible changes to the climate. The foremost authority on the
matter, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, has modeled
hundreds of possible futures to find economically optimal paths to
achieving these goals, which require the world to bring emissions down
to zero by around 2060. In virtually every IPCC model, carbon capture is
absolutely essential---no matter what else we do to mitigate climate
change.

But carbon-capture technologies have a tortured history. Though first
developed nearly 50 years ago, their use in climate-change mitigation
only began in earnest in the 1990s and scaling them up hasn't gone as
planned. Over the past decade[[, billions of dollars have been spent on
carbon-capture projects]{.underline}]{.mark} that have not materialized.
The most recent failure was the \$7.5 billion Kemper Project in
Mississippi, whose owners earlier this year announced that instead of
finishing the planned low-emissions coal plant, they would just turn it
into a natural-gas plant.

Those fiascos have provided ammunition to environmental activists who
argue that carbon-capture technologies create a "moral hazard," making
us complacent about the ongoing use of fossil fuels and extending the
time we take to wean off them. At the most recent climate talks in Bonn,
Germany in November, protesters thronged the only panel the US was
officially hosting, because some of the panelists were arguing for the
use of carbon capture when burning coal. "Clean coal is a myth!" they
shouted.

My initial perception of carbon capture, based on what I had read in the
press, was to side with the protesters. [[Carbon-capture technologies
seemed outrageously expensive]{.underline}]{.mark}, especially when
renewable energy is starting to get cheap enough to compete with fossil
fuels. At the same time, my training in chemical engineering and
chemistry told me the technologies were scientifically sound. And [some
of world's most important bodies on climate change keep insisting that
we need carbon capture.]{.underline} Who should I believe?

The question took me down a rabbit hole. After a year of reporting,
through visits to large and small carbon-capture plants around the
world, and conversations with more than 100 academics, entrepreneurs,
policy experts, and government officials, I've come to a conclusion:
[[Carbon capture is both vital and viabl]{.underline}e.]{.mark} Its mass
deployment remains a challenge, but not for the reasons that many
environmentalists commonly cite. Clearing up those misunderstandings
could offer hope in a world full of doom-and-gloom climate stories.

Over the next two weeks, Quartz will publish a series of articles
exploring carbon-capture technologies from China to California,
showcasing an important but poorly understood part of the world's race
to zero emissions. These are stories of staunch environmentalists who
take a different approach to solving the biggest global threat humanity
has ever faced, and of a new breed of energy entrepreneur trying to
convert carbon dioxide from a liability to an asset.

Many would agree that [if we have to burn fossil fuels, we should use
carbon-capture technologies to negate greenhouse-gas
emissions]{.underline}. But why do we need to keep burning fossil fuels?

In many countries, even without subsidies, solar and wind power are
starting to compete with fossil fuels on price. The trend points to a
world awash in renewable energy not too many years from now. Moreover,
there is now little doubt the malice of some fossil-fuel companies
delayed efforts to take global action against climate change. Why should
we develop technologies that will help them now?

[The optimism surrounding renewable energy masks some harsh realities.
[Despite decades of progress, about 80% of the world's energy still
comes from fossil fuels---]{.mark}]{.underline}the same as in the 1970s.
Since then, we've kept adding renewable capacity, but it hasn't outpaced
the growth of the world's population and its demand for energy.

[Today, about 30% of total world energy (and 40% of the world's
electricity) is supplied by coal, which emits more carbon dioxide per
unit of energy produced than nearly any other fuel source.]{.underline}
In a recent analysis (paywall), Deborah Adams of the International
Energy Agency, an intergovernmental think tank, notes that the world's
demand for coal actually increased in 2017. (And, not surprisingly,
global annual emissions are projected to increase and set a new record.)
New coal power plants are being built in most poor countries, "because
coal is a relatively cheap, readily available, secure, and reliable
source of power," she writes. "A coal-fired power plant is a massive
capital investment and will typically operate for 40 years. This means
coal will continue to be a significant part of the energy mix for
decades to come."

[The hugely valuable oil and gas industries, accounting for 33% and 24%
of total world energy use,]{.underline} respectively, are also
entrenched. "Based on what we know now, [we would need major
technological breakthroughs]{.underline} or weak world growth, including
[for large emerging and developing economies,]{.underline} for oil
demand to peak in the next 20 years," says Gian Maria Milesi-Ferretti of
the International Monetary Fund. Despite the growth in electric
vehicles, most oil companies agree that peak oil is "not in sight."

Even the head of the International Renewable Energy Agency, whose job is
to ensure that its more than 180 member countries reach 100% renewable
energy, is not exactly gung-ho about the prospects. "In the electricity
sector, 100% renewables by 2050 or 2060 may still be achievable," Adnan
Amin told me, "but it's unlikely to happen for all energy use." The
global electricity sector is responsible for only about 25% of all
emissions.

To help get across the challenge we're facing when it comes to weaning
humanity off fossil fuels, we've created a simulation where your goal is
to reduce the world's emissions to zero as soon as possible. You can
either disincentivize energy sources that produce carbon dioxide or
incentivize clean-energy sources, or some combination of both. The
projections are based on the open-source En-ROADS tool built by the
nonprofit Climate Interactive and MIT Sloan, which simulates the effect
subsidies and taxes have on energy use and carbon emissions.

As you may have gathered, [t[here is no way to achieve zero emissions
through subsidies and taxes]{.underline}]{.mark} that are [[within the
bounds of what would reasonably ensure that the global economy doesn't
come to a complete halt]{.underline}]{.mark}. (For coal, for example,
these would be in the range of ±\$80 per metric ton of CO2 emitted). You
need something else to reduce emissions. [Carbon-capture technologies
are essential.]{.underline}

If you're still not convinced, consider this: there are a handful of
industries essential to the modern way of life that generate large
amounts of carbon dioxide as a side product of the chemistry of their
manufacturing process. These carbon-intensive industries---including
cement, steel, and ethanol---produce about 20% of all global emissions.
[[If we want to keep using these products and reach zero emissions, the
only option is to have these industries deploy carbon
capture.]{.underline}]{.mark}

And we need to reach zero emissions, not just in the energy sector, but
completely, across every industry and every part of the world. The last
time there was so much carbon dioxide in Earth's atmosphere was more
than 800,000 years ago, when the world's sea levels were 10 meters (30
ft) higher than today. Even conservative estimates of a 2°C world
suggest that by 2100 the oceans could rise more than one meter from
today's levels, which could displace as much as 10% of the world's
population[. It would also increase the frequency of heatwaves and
intensity of storms, while decreasing crop yields. It's not something we
can wait out.]{.underline}

Cooperative Federalism

The law of American federalism is based in the Tenth Amendment, which
recognizes that states are sovereign entities with their own powers and
responsibilities.77 The American federalist system has historically
operated under the doctrine of dual federalism, whereby the federal and
state governments operate as separate entities, each with its own
discreet scope of authority.78 Despite this, the Supremacy Clause of the
United States Constitution allows Congress to preempt state law,
supplanting it with a federal regime, even when the state is acting
within the realm of the powers delegated to it under the Tenth
Amendment.79 This is known as the doctrine of preemptive federalism.
[[Cooperative federalism strikes a balance between dual federalism and
preemptive federalism. Cooperative federalism allows state and federal
governments to share responsibility for the regulation of an activity
with the goal of generating more effective results than either level of
government acting alone would be capable of
achieving]{.underline}]{.mark}. In the late 1960s and early 1970s
Congress increasingly began to rely on this approach to regulation,
beginning with dozens of federal environmental regulations, including
the Clean Air Act and the Clean Water Act. Since then, a variety of
endeavors have utilized this approach, from telecommunications to health
insurance to financial aid for needy families.80 **[[Cooperative
federalism operates according to two basic structures. Under the first
model, state agencies follow federally set standards in order to receive
funds to implement a federal statutory scheme.]{.underline}]{.mark}**81
This model is utilized in the Medicaid Act, which provides federal
funding to the states to reimburse the cost of providing medical
treatment to the poor.82 A cooperative federalist approach was chosen
for Medicaid to provide the states flexibility in implementing the
program while still maintaining federal control.83 The provision of
funds gives states an incentive to implement the federal policy. Under
the second model, the federal government grants the states the authority
to regulate subject matter areas that would otherwise be reserved for
the federal government.84 An example of this model can be seen with the
Clean Air Act (CAA). The CAA, originally passed in 1970, was the first
major piece of federal environmental legislation to utilize a
cooperative federalism framework.85 A national standard was needed to
combat the "race to the bottom," whereby the states looked to attract
industry by creating a favorable regulatory environment, which often
resulted in lenient environmental regulations. Under this approach, the
federal government sets a minimum level of environmental protection ---
a regulatory "floor"--- that states cannot drop below in administering
the Act. This allows the federal government to utilize their knowledge
of the situation at the national level, and their access to the best
scientific data, to determine the parameters of the regulatory
structure, but allows the states, with their unique knowledge of the
situation in their area, to implement the program as they see fit.
Often, a combination of the two models is used, where the federal
government provides grants to non-federal entities to implement a
program, and conditions the grant money on the state or local entity
complying with minimum federal standards.86 Proponents of cooperative
federalism say that it balances the competing interests in having
federal oversight of issues that are of national importance and
recognizing each states' right to regulate issues that are traditionally
in their purview.87 Proponents of this approach further argue that state
and local governments are better equipped to create programs tailored to
their unique needs, and that allowing regulation to operate at this
level will result in greater citizen participation in local
government.88 This approach could also help to spread the burden of
enforcement between the federal government and the states, and could
streamline federal administrative requirements by allowing states to
issue permits, investigate violations, and issue sanctions. Another
benefit is that cooperative federalism allows for policy experimentation
by the states, from which other states and the federal government can
learn without taking on the risk of the experimentation themselves.
Cooperative federalism also has potential drawbacks. When states have
primary responsibility for administering a program, that program becomes
subject to budgetary issues, changing political landscapes, and
interstate competition.89 Critics argue that federal oversight will be
inadequate or inconsistent under a cooperative federalist regime, and
that administrators of the programs and affected citizens could become
confused as to which level of government is accountable in any given
situation.90 Analysts claim that this occurred in the aftermath of
Hurricane Katrina, where the shared responsibility for disaster
preparedness and relief by the local, state, and federal governments
resulted in blame shifting and ineffective action by any one level of
government.91

Cooperative Federalist Approach to CCS Regulation

CCS regulation is already evolving in a cooperative federalist
direction, as evidenced by the SDWA's Class VI well program, where the
federal government grants states the authority to regulate the
underground injection of CO2 for the purpose of long-term
sequestration.92 As is often the case with cooperative federalism in
environmental regulation, the SDWA UIC program includes baseline
standards set by the federal government that act as a floor for state
regulatory programs. The federal government grants states the authority
to run the program, provided they meet or exceed the set minimum
requirements. A cooperative federalist approach would minimize the
extent to which the pursuit of the federal goal of greenhouse gas
emissions reduction would infringe on state sovereignty. It would also
allow states discretion as to how to achieve the best results,
recognizing that states have diverse political, economic and geologic
circumstances. Even if policy makers determine that a cooperative
federalist approach to CCS regulation is the most effective path
forward, questions will arise as to the best way to go about dividing
regulation between the federal government and the states. Cooperative
federalist regimes approach this division in a variety of ways. [[One
option is to confine the federal role to providing information and
financial support]{.underline}]{.mark}. Conditioning the receipt of
funds on adherence to federal standards, but leaving implementation
authority with the states could strengthen this model. A second option
is for the federal government to displace state and local power over
some aspects of CCS, while allowing states to regulate other issues.
Regardless of what model is chosen, we are likely to see a combination
of federal and state authority in the regulation of CCS moving forward.
Further questions will arise due to the patchwork of policy that already
exists and in which CCS research and development projects are already
operating. For example, how should federal regulation incorporate
regulatory actions already taken by the states? How can federal
regulation build on the best state regulatory programs, and how should
it address the inconsistencies between state regulations without
requiring a uniform approach? Should there be horizontal cooperation
between the states, such as regional initiatives, in addition to
vertical cooperation between the federal, state, and local governments?
How should these be governed? Government regulation of each aspect of
CCS will fall along a continuum, with regulation completely at the state
level on one extreme, and regulation completely at the federal level on
the other extreme. For example, cost recovery for the construction and
operation of capture-ready power plants will fall completely under the
purview of state utility regulation, whereas carbon sequestration under
federal lands will be regulated solely by the federal government. Most
issues will fall between these two dual federalist extremes, and would
likely be most effectively regulated through cooperation between the
state and federal governments. In the following section we take each
major regulatory issue inhibiting the widespread, cost effective
deployment of CCS in turn, analyzing the most appropriate role for each
level of government. In determining the appropriate role for the federal
and state governments, we considered the following: Whether there are
applicable laws already on the books; Whether the issue falls under an
area traditionally regulated by the states; Whether there is a need for
consistent standards; Whether the issue is one that will continue to be
present over a long time frame; Whether there is a need for more
resources than one state can provide; Whether there are cross border
issues; and Whether there is a need for consistent standards.

#### Warming is existential -- best models prove that bending the carbon curve is necessary and sufficient to stay below key tipping points

[Climate change is becoming an existential threat with warming in excess
of 2°C within the next three decades and 4°C to 6°C within the next
several decades]{.underline}. [Warming]{.underline} of such magnitudes
[will expose as many as 75% of the world's population to deadly heat
stress in addition to disrupting the climate and weather
worldwide]{.underline}. [[Climate change is an urgent problem requiring
urgent solutions]{.underline}]{.mark}. This report lays out urgent and
practical solutions that are ready for implementation now, will deliver
benefts in the next few critical decades, and places the world on a path
to achieving the longterm targets of the Paris Agreement and near-term
sustainable development goals. The approach consists of four building
blocks and 3 levers to implement ten scalable solutions described in
this report by a team of climate scientists, policy makers, social and
behavioral scientists, political scientists, legal experts, diplomats,
and military experts from around the world. These solutions will enable
society to decarbonize the global energy system by 2050 through
effciency and renewables, drastically reduce short-lived climate
pollutants, and stabilize the climate well below 2°C both in the near
term (before 2050) and in the long term (post 2050). It will also reduce
premature mortalities by tens of millions by 2050. As an insurance
against policy lapses, mitigation delays and faster than projected
climate changes, the solutions include an Atmospheric Carbon Extraction
lever to remove CO2 from the air. The amount of CO2 that must be removed
ranges from negligible, [if the emissions of CO2 from the energy system
and SLCPs start to decrease by 2020 and carbon neutrality is achieved by
2050, to a staggering one trillion tons if the carbon lever is not
pulled and emissions of climate pollutants continue to increase until
2030. There are numerous living laboratories including 53 cities, many
universities around the world, the state of California, and the nation
of Sweden, who have embarked on a carbon neutral pathway.]{.underline}
These laboratories have already created 8 million jobs in the clean
energy industry; they have also shown that emissions of greenhouse gases
and air pollutants can be decoupled from economic growth. Another
favorable sign is that growth rates of worldwide carbon emissions have
reduced from 2.9% per year during the frst decade of this century to
1.3% from 2011 to 2014 and near zero growth rates during the last few
years. The carbon emission curve is bending, but we have a long way to
go and very little time for achieving carbon neutrality. We need
institutions and enterprises that can accelerate this bending by
scaling-up the solutions that are being proven in the living
laboratories. We have less than a decade to put these solutions in place
around the world to preserve nature and our quality of life for
generations to come. The time is now.

The Paris Agreement is an historic achievement. For the first time,
effectively all nations have committed to limiting their greenhouse gas
emissions and taking other actions to limit global temperature change.
Specifically, 197 nations agreed to hold "the increase in the global
average temperature to well below 2°C above pre-industrial levels and
pursue efforts to limit the temperature increase to 1.5°C above
pre-industrial levels," and achieve carbon neutrality in the second half
of this century.

[The climate has already warmed by 1°C. [The problem is running ahead of
us, and under current trends we will likely reach 1.5°C in the next
ffteen years]{.mark} and surpass the 2°C guardrail by mid-century with a
50% probability of reaching 4°C by end of century. Warming in excess of
3°C is likely to be a global catastrophe for three major
reasons]{.underline}:

• [Warming]{.underline} in the range of 3°C to 5°C [is suggested as the
threshold for several tipping points in the physical and geochemical
systems]{.underline}; a warming of about 3°C has a probability of over
40% to cross over multiple tipping points, while a warming close to 5°C
increases it to nearly 90%, compared with a baseline warming of less
than 1.5°C, which has only just over a 10% probability of exceeding any
tipping point.

• [[Health effects of such warming are emerging as a major if not
dominant source of concern]{.mark}. Warming of 4°C or more will expose
more than 70% of the population]{.underline}, i.e. about 7 billion by
the end of the century, to deadly heat stress and expose about 2.4
billion to vector borne diseases such as Dengue, Chikengunya, and Zika
virus among others.

• [Ecologists and paleontologists have proposed that warming in excess
of 3°C, accompanied by increased acidity of the oceans by the buildup of
CO2 , can become a major causal factor for exposing more than 50% of all
species to extinction]{.underline}. 20% of species are in danger of
extinction now due to population, habitat destruction, and climate
change.

The good news is that [there may still be time to avert such
catastrophic changes]{.underline}. The Paris Agreement and supporting
climate policies must be strengthened substantially within the next fve
years to bend the emissions curve down faster, stabilize climate, and
prevent catastrophic warming. [To the extent those efforts fall short,
[societies and ecosystems will be forced to contend with substantial
needs for adaptation]{.mark}---a burden that will fall
disproportionately on the poorest three billion who are least
responsible for causing the climate change problem.]{.underline}

Carbon will outlive us, but can current state climate change law and
sustainable energy regulation survive? State carbon policies to control
climate warming and our energy future are in legal jeopardy. I[n the
void created by a lack of federal policy,1 California and ten states on
the East Coast implemented new laws to reduce carbon emissions and
promote sustainable energy]{.underline}. **[[Since implementation, a
successful barrage of litigation has invoked the dormant Commerce Clause
and the Supremacy Clause of the U.S. Constitution to challenge the legal
viability of these laws]{.underline}]{.mark}**. Although California was
not the first state to impose carbon control law, it is now the
epicenter of legal challenges. [California is accused of taking *ultra
vires* administrative actions not allowed under state law or the U.S.
Constitution and illegally discriminating against interstate
commerce.]{.underline}3 While carbon regulation proceeds in California
and in nine East Coast states,4 California is the only state to have
adopted all five primary legal mechanisms for sustainable energy and
low-carbon development:5

Net Metering: Also employed in 85% of states.

Renewable Portfolio Standards (RPS): Also employed in 65% of states.

Renewable System Benefit Charges: Also employed in 33% of states.

Carbon and greenhouse gas (GHG) regulation: Also employed in 20% of
states.

Feed-In Tariffs: Also employed in less than 10% of states.

[The states, particularly including California, are now legally
challenged from multiple angles and have had some of their regulations
declared unconstitutional.]{.underline}6 The writing was on the wall.7
This Article examines these California le- gal confrontations and
compares them to what is transpiring in other states. Notably, it is not
just the regulated community that has taken legal umbrage with the
California sustainable energy program. California is also challenged by
environmental groups, low-income consumers, and businesses outside the
state.8

And many of these challenges to state policies have been found valid:

The California feed-in tariff was stricken as illegal/unconstitutional.9

State RPS programs are being challenged in several states as implemented
in an unconstitutional manner, and have been stricken when challenged on
constitutional grounds.10

A recent Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC)adjudicatory order
casts uncertainty on the scope of net metering mechanisms when states,
like California, allow a substantial net export of power from the
generator to the utility.11

[California's carbon control law is under several serious, and in some
cases already successful, legal challenges]{.underline}.12

Other state regulation of power has been stricken as unconstitutional.13

California was challenged as to whether its regulatory actions regarding
sustainable energy fuels violate the dormant Commerce Clause of the U.S.
Constitution. California lost in the federal trial court,14 but the
decision was recently reversed in a controversial split decision of the
U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit.15 [The Ninth Circuit
decision seems to reconfigure the past three- quarters of a century of
Supreme Court precedent applying the Commerce Clause, as analyzed
below]{.underline}.16 The Ninth Circuit held that **[[states can
disregard the dormant Commerce Clause prohibition against interstate
commerce discrimination when they make their statutory purpose the
discouragement of CO2 emissions resulting from transport of goods or
commerce from outside the state]{.underline}]{.mark}**. There is no
prior Supreme Court sanction for such environmental purposes ne- gating
the Commerce Clause. Comparing California's loss to other states
undergoing a dozen dormant Commerce Clause challenges to their state
sustainable energy regulation, eight of the twelve either were settled
in favor of the challengers or the state lost, and the remaining four
have been dismissed on procedural grounds without reaching the merits of
the claim or are still pending or are on appeal.17 Part II of this
Article examines in detail these dormant Commerce Clause dimensions of
state en- ergy regulation.

Pursuant to the Supremacy Clause of the U.S. Constitution, California
has been challenged six times regarding regulation of its electric power
generation facilities and liquid fuels. California has either settled in
favor of challengers or lost five of these six, and the sixth matter was
dismissed on procedural grounds, without reaching the merits of the
claim and with the plaintiffs receiving permis- sion to re-file the
complaint.18 In states undergoing four recent similar challenges to
their energy regulation, three of the four either were settled in some
manner favorable to challengers or the state lost the decision, while
the fourth matter and one of the originally adjudicated matters on
appeal are still pending.19 Part III of this Article analyzes the
Supremacy Clause bifurcation of jurisdiction to regulate electricity and
recent challenges pursuant to constitutional doctrine.20

There is more than constitutional invalidity of certain state energy
regula- tion. California carbon and sustainable energy policy has
recently undergone seven significant legal challenges raised pursuant to
*state* law. California has either settled in favor of challengers or
lost three of the four of these that have proceeded to a final decision,
while one challenge has been sidetracked on pro- cedural grounds without
reaching the merits of the claim, and others are still awaiting final
decisions.21 New York, the state leading the East Coast Regional
Greenhouse Gas Initiative (RGGI), has faced four challenges. One was
settled in favor of the challengers, two were dismissed on procedural
grounds without reaching the merits of the claim, and one has not
reached a decision.22 Part IV of this Article analyzes the state law
challenges to energy regulation.23

[California and other states have survived these legal challenges
sparingly, and often only by procedural defenses that dismiss the case
before a decision on the legal merits of their state energy
regulation]{.underline}. This Article analyzes and charts the dimensions
of legal challenges on carbon and sustainable energy in Califor- nia
compared to other states. There is more to this than a mere "box score."
These new legal precedents construct the legal carbon-control future as
states labor to achieve a sustainable economy. Unconstitutional state

Climate Federalism Clarity and the Constitutional and Statutory
Minefield

Rounded analysis of federalism hedging and the climate challenge
requires a brief foray into doctrinal analysis. [Whatever the federalism
and preemption mix ultimately adopted to address climate change,
encourage clean energy, or address another regulatory challenge, federal
statutory language about federalism must be clear and explicit to avoid
regulatory and market uncertainty.]{.underline} Even if a new federal
climate-targeted law remains elusive, a modest statutory amendment to
either federal environmental laws, energy laws, or a freestanding
enactment addressing state climate and clean energy regulatory authority
would help ensure that state and regional clean energy and climate
regulation efforts do not run afoul of federal statutory law or face
dormant Commerce Clause challenges. [[Current state]{.mark} and regional
[efforts]{.mark} are already [imperiled by preemption]{.mark} and
constitutional challenges]{.underline}.326 Such arguable infirmities
arise due to state efforts to take responsibility for reducing their
jurisdiction's own emissions, reduce compliance costs by embracing
cross-state and even international trading options, and, especially,
ensure that their regulation does not simply result in the transfer of
energy production or leakage of GHG emissions to other jurisdictions. A
raft of judicial rejections and some limited successes confirm the need
for explicit and effective statutory drafting. For example, even if
well-intentioned, state barriers to the interstate movement of business
activity and energy can violate FERC's exclusive jurisdiction over
interstate and wholesale energy markets, as the Supreme Court found in
2016 in striking down a Maryland law that sought to incentivize
construction of clean energy production.327 [Under somewhat
distinguishable programs, state [clean energy strategies in California
and Minnesota were challenged on both statutory and constitutional
grounds]{.mark}. California's program to assess fees based on climate
impacts of fuel transportation was upheld in a decision focused on
dormant Commerce Clause doctrine.]{.underline}328 Minnesota's limitation
on importation of energy from out-of-state generators was rejected, but
with the three appellate judges dividing on the underlying rationale.329
[Other energy and [climate-linked measures]{.mark} also [have met with
judicial rejection due to preemption]{.mark}]{.underline}. For example,
municipal measures to improve the energy efficiency of buildings were
found by a district court to be preempted under a federal law setting
uniform appliance efficiency standards.330 [The Supreme Court's
[construction of the Clean Air Act's]{.mark} most [preemptive provision
further creates]{.mark} federalism and [preemption
uncertainties]{.mark}.]{.underline} In the Engine Manufacturers331 case,
despite the Clean Air Act's savings clause and State Implementation Plan
provisions, the Supreme Court rejected local measures mandating clean
motor vehicle fleets.332 Such measures were held preempted by the Clean
Air Act provision setting forth a national emissions standard for new
motor vehicles, subject only to a carve-out for California; the Court
declined to limit the reach of the law's preemptive language to
regulation directed at manufacturers.333 [The Court held that the law
also preempted state and local regulation targeting motor vehicle
purchase choices.334 Efforts by municipalities to require clean taxicab
fleets have been similarly rejected in the lower courts]{.underline}.335
And when New York sought to preclude trades of power plant pollution
that would result in increased Midwestern power plant pollution that
would drift back to New York, the Second Circuit found that such
regulation illegally frustrated the Clean Air Act's acid rain trading
program's goals of a cost-effective freely operating market in sulfur
dioxide allowances.336 Because so many activities and categories of
regulation link to energy usage and GHG emissions, little state or local
regulation is sure to avoid conflict with current federal laws or future
climate-directed legislation or regulation. And if such a future federal
climate law or regulation were to adopt market-based modes of regulation
or in other respects seek cost-effective regulation or even just provide
incentives for desired innovations, any additional state and local
regulation could be viewed as posing an obstacle to those
market-facilitating and costeffectiveness goals.337 Two main strategies
could avoid constitutional and statutory challenges to state and local
efforts to produce cleaner energy and limit GHG emission. [The [first
option is for Congress]{.mark} or agencies to [provide careful
articulation]{.mark} of categories of [permissible activity.
Explicit]{.mark} statutory [permission can overcome]{.mark} both
[statutory preemption concerns]{.mark} and dormant Commerce Clause
infirmities.]{.underline} However, due to the massive variety of
government choices and actions influencing energy usage and GHG
emissions, comprehensive express carve-outs from conflict preemption
risks would be difficult to craft. A better or perhaps accompanying
option would be to create a regulatory or adjudicatory regime that would
protect state and local climate and energy efficiency regulation unless
stakeholders in agency or judicial venues established that such state
and local measures posed a substantial obstacle to federal ends.338
Preemption doctrine may already be moving in the direction of assessing
actual evidence of undue state frustration of federal ends.339 Courts
should not find obstacle preemption without assessment of the magnitude
of the conflict, state and local motivations, and consideration of other
benefits of such state and local regulation, including horizontal and
vertical learning about the efficacy of alternative regulatory
options.340

CONCLUSION Monopolies are always problematic. In debates over the
content of ideal federal climate legislation or regulation, prominent
scholarly, political, and industry advocates have argued for preemption
of state climate regulatory authority. Such arguments fail to consider
the beneficial dynamics created by what this Article labels federalism
hedging. Despite the intuitive appeal of a preemptive single market
structure for a worldwide problem that would benefit from marketbased
regulation at the largest scale possible, a preemptive regime could
create incentives for strategic reversal efforts or actions to derail
legal implementation. This nation's progress would be almost completely
dependent on a federal regulatory monopoly and a single law. As with
other regulatory challenges characterized by rapid change, innovation,
and turbulent politics, retaining state and local climate authority both
intertwined with and possibly independent from federal climate
regulation would create a more sturdy and resilient web of regulation,
stabilize linked markets, and discourage efforts to derail a federal
climate law. The mere possibility of more state regulation would create
heightened incentives for successful federal regulation that would, in
turn, reduce potentially disparate state measures. With more regulatory
stability, market rewards for innovation would also be enhanced.
[[Federal climate preemption]{.mark} and unitary regulatory scheme
arguments [may make sense in an idealized world]{.mark} of perfect,
stable legal commitments, [but in a real world]{.mark} [pervaded by
regulatory failure]{.mark}, reversal risks, and political instability,
such [unitary]{.mark} preemptive [regimes would undercut climate
progress]{.mark}. The more federal climate regulation or future
legislation uses preemptive strategies, the more all hopes for climate
progress would rest on one imperfect and vulnerable federal
vessel.]{.underline} Retaining room for state and local climate
regulation and linked clean energy efforts hedges regulatory risks. Such
overlapping and potentially intertwined federal and state regulation
may, somewhat paradoxically, be the most effective way to ensure that a
future federal climate law or regulation under existing law will
actually be implemented and endure despite ongoing political and legal
contestation. In the meantime, during times of federal policy reversal
or inertia, the enduring norm of room for additional state regulation
and innovation remains important. [States, alongside intermittent
federal progress and policy support, have been critical to climate and
clean energy progress]{.underline} and in catalyzing federal climate
engagement. During a period of federal recoil, states will again likely
become the main vessel for climate momentum and in rewarding clean
energy innovation. Through that retained and ongoing state authority,
the pressure will build for federal reengagement. Through the benefits
of federalism hedging, climate progress may slow but is unlikely to
cease.

IV\. THE CASE FOR FEDERALISM: APPLICATION TO GLOBAL CLIMATE CHANGE The
inactivity of the Bush Administration in the area of climate change over
the past eight years has led to a flowering of state actions, like those
described above in New York State, from state renewable performance
standards and energy efficiency programs to the development of RGGI and
other emerging state cap-and-trade programs. These programs have had,
and will continue to have, tremendous value as they reduce GHG
emissions, build a thriving green energy economy, and serve as the
laboratory for further efforts at the federal, international or
multi-state level. [Once the federal government finally begins
meaningful action-whether in the form of federal cap-and-trade
legislation, administrative regulation of GHG emissions, or
otherwise-the role for continued state and local efforts will be equally
critical, or even more essential]{.underline}. [**A federal program
should take advantage of the progress that has been demonstrated at the
state level.** The recent history of climate regulation demonstrates
that many of the traditional economic incentives that have led to a
so-called \"race to the bottom\" in some areas of environmental policy
are reversed in the case of climate change, as it is often in a state\'s
self-interest economically and otherwise to work towards additional GHG
emission reductions.]{.underline} Furthermore, there are collective
benefits that will accrue to the nation as a whole from allowing states
to continue to operate unfettered in the climate change context, even
after the federal government finally establishes its climate change
policy. [**Finally, there is no legitimate federal policy reason for
preventing a state or region from implementing additional climate change
policies that impose additional costs only on its own sources**. Indeed,
a state\'s interest in positioning its sources to compete effectively in
an interstate marketplace provides a sufficient constraint on state
exuberance]{.underline}. When determining the appropriate roles for the
different levels of government in climate change policy, the question is
not simply whether or not federal climate change legislation should
preempt state and local laws. Instead, the question is whether the
federal government can enact policies that fully address cli mate change
in the most effective manner possible. [Undoubtedly, [the most efficient
and effective method of addressing climate change includes state and
local governments]{.mark} continuing to operate in a manner that is
long-accepted under our system of federalism, wherein they **[are
collaborative partners with the federal government in working to address
a complex and wide-ranging problem]{.mark}**.]{.underline} Without this
kind of cooperative federalism, solving the climate change crisis may be
further delayed or even become impossible, and powers traditionally left
to the states will be precluded by the federal government without any
resulting collective benefit. A. Climate Change and the Dynamics of
Cooperative Federalism While the climate change crisis may differ from
other environmental problems in many ways, it is similar in that the
best approach to mitigate and adapt to the problem requires a
comprehensive approach involving multiple levels of government. Over the
past several decades, **[[many of the major success stories in
environmental law contain some type of cooperative federalism
approach]{.mark}; restraining one or both levels of government in the
overall equation often has negative results]{.underline}**. 24
[Recognizing the value of state action,]{.underline} [[**Congress has
rarely enacted laws that preempt state and local action completely**,
especially]{.mark} when that state and local action supplements [the
protection of public health and the environment]{.mark} provided by the
federal statute]{.underline}.25 [In the rare instances that Congress has
preempted state action, its policy choice has been dictated by the
interstate and international nature of commerce at issue]{.underline}.26
The fairly short history of environmental regulation in the United
States has been characterized by an ebb-and-flow of action at the state
and federal levels. Prior to the enactment of the major federal
environmental laws starting in the 1960s, the states were the primary
forces in protecting environmental quality, relying on nascent state
laws as well as the common law of public nuisance. After Congress passed
a multitude of federal laws and created the Environmental Protection
Agency in the 1960s and 1970s, the space for states to act seemed less
important. But times change, and as Washington became gridlocked on
environmental policy in the 1990s and continuing into this decade, the
initiative returned to the states, especially in the realm of climate
policy.2 7 Although it appears that we are moving into another period of
federal action, the pendulum will undoubtedly swing back again in the
future. The recent history of climate change regulation has defied the
conventional wisdom that states, left to their own devices, will engage
in a so-called \"race to the bottom,\" in which some states eschew
environmental requirements in order to gain a competitive advantage
economically over the other states. [Federal environmental laws have
been seen as necessary to counter the \"race to the bottom\" by the
states. Under this scenario, a federal response to the environmental
problem is often necessary to set a uniform regulatory \"floor\" that
requires each state to at least meet a minimum level of environmental
protection.]{.underline} In fact, it is largely because of this dynamic
that the major federal environmental laws of the early 1970s, including
the Clean Air Act, came to fruition.28 Instead of a \"race to the
bottom,\" **[climate change has engendered what may be called a \"race
to the top.\"]{.underline}**\'29 In many ways, the reasons for the
\"race to the top\" are similar to the reasons for the \"race to the
bottom,\" in that states are trying to gain an eco nomic advantage. 30
In fact, states have seen many policies that address climate change not
as a burden on commerce, but as an economic opportunity. Research,
manufacturing and deployment of \"green\" technologies can generate
well-paying jobs in the short term and create new anchor industries in
the long term. These technologies can then be sold to the rest of the
country and the world, providing additional economic and environmental
benefits. Part of the reason for a particular state to act even in the
absence of federal action is to be a leader in new and emerging markets.
[[In the event Congress finally enacts some form of comprehensive
climate change legislation, states will still have many of the same
motivations to engage in a \"race to the top,\"]{.mark} with potential
changes only in terms of degree]{.underline}. With a properly designed
piece of legislation, the continuing \"race to the top\" can have
numerous positive effects, in terms of national and state economic
benefits, as well as national and state GHG emission reductions. B.
Collective Benefits of State and Local Government Action to Combat
Climate Change State and local efforts to reduce GHG emissions have
already played a valuable role in reducing GHG emissions in the United
States. Such efforts have also helped in developing strategies for
reducing GHG emissions that can serve as a model for federal and
international action, and in positioning the United States to join in
and lead international efforts to reduce GHG emissions. **[Even if the
federal goyernment finally implements real measures to address climate
change, state and local action will continue to have substantial
benefits]{.underline}**. 1. **[States as \"Laboratories\" and the Need
for Ongoing Innovation]{.underline}** One of the primary benefits of
state environmental action is that it enables states to develop new and
more effective or efficient models of environmental regulation. As
Justice Brandeis observed, while a state may incur additional expenses
or decide to impose extra risk on itself, \"\[i\]t is one of the happy
incidents of the federal system that a single courageous State may, if
its citi zens choose, serve as a laboratory; and try novel social and
economic experiments without risk to the rest of the country. \' 31 In
this sense, **[[allowing states the ability to develop their own
strategies to further reduce GHG emissions operates as a sort of
insurance policy for the national economy]{.underline}]{.mark}**. This
is because an innovation that fails at the state level will, of course,
have less of an impact on the national economy than a federal attempt at
innovation that fails. State efforts to date are influencing the
development of a federal program profoundly. In particular, RGGI has
provided an important template for action by the federal government and
other states in several ways. It is demonstrating the mechanics of
developing a cap-and-trade program for carbon dioxide. This is
especially true in areas such as offsets and the auctioning of CO2
allowances. Prior to the development of RGGI, there was little
discussion in Washington about auctioning CO2 allowances. Now, given
RGGI\'s example of auctioning nearly 100 percent of CO2 allowances, the
only debate seems to be how quickly to move to 100 percent auctioning of
allowances.32 In fact, President Obama\'s recent budget proposal makes
clear the administration\'s intent for the forthcoming federal
cap-and-trade program to include 100 percent auctioning of allowances.
33 The actual process for conducting RGGI auctions will also serve as a
detailed model for federal legislation or regulation, particularly given
the success of the RGGI auctions to date. Once comprehensive federal
climate change legislation is finally enacted, the need for ongoing
innovation and additional development of policy mechanisms will not just
disappear. Continued improvements in policy will likely be necessary to
develop new means of further reducing GHG emissions. State and local
level action is often the most effective way to accomplish this
continual policy enhancement. Even if a particular state innovation does
not result in net reductions within a federal cap, it could provide a
policy model for reducing emissions further into the future. **[2. State
and Local Programs Can Reduce the Cost of Meeting a Federal
Cap]{.underline}** State and local programs can facilitate compliance
with a federal program by reducing the overall cost of a given level of
nationwide emissions reduction. Even advocates of preemption recognize
the value of complementary policies at the sub-national level, including
in areas such as \"appliance efficiency standards, building codes, land
use decisions, performance standards, public transit, and incentives to
increase efficiency. \'34 These policies address market imperfections
and barriers such as lack of consumer information about the financial
benefits of efficient products, disconnect between the buyers and users
of equipment (e.g., rental housing), entrenched energy systems, research
and development spillover effects, and other related issues. By reducing
the demand for carbon-intensive energy, these state programs and
policies reduce the pressure on achieving a given federal GHG goal.
Ignoring these barriers could potentially result in the federal program
accruing higher costs and higher allowance prices than necessary. State
programs that reduce the demand for carbon-containing energy through
measures such as state efficiency programs and standards, improved land
use and transportation planning, renewables deployment and cap-and-trade
35 will reduce the cost of federal allowances by lowering the demand for
such allowances. 36 Reduced federal allowance prices will result in
reduced consumer price impacts and reduced costs for other covered
entities outside of the state. Because costs of compliance and consumer
price impacts are both significant political variables in policy design,
these effects could create the political opportunity for the federal
government to further ratchet down the federal cap over time. In other
words, aggressive state action, even if it is more expensive for the
state, can-lead to additional benefits by facilitating more stringent
federal action. Certain redundancies that result from an overlapping
cooperative federalism approach are actually desirable. Many federal
laws contain some form of redundancy in authority among the different
levels of government. Although such redundancy may not be perfectly
efficient, it is sometimes more effective than a less redundant
approach.37 Other approaches-including those that are more purely
federal, exclusively state-controlled or more precisely divided between
the two levels-have certain benefits, but also notable flaws. A
cooperative and sometimes redundant approach still realizes these
benefits-including a reduced overall cost of a given level of national
GHG emission reductionswhile also avoiding most of the costs. 38 **[3.
Enabling Further Action in the Future]{.underline}** Allowing for the
possibility of continued state innovation also gives states the ability
to encourage and affect further federal action. With climate change,
this has happened over the past several years in an environment of
federal inaction. Even if Congress finally does pass some form of
comprehensive GHG emission reduction legislation, additional efforts may
become necessary in the future. New technologies will likely be needed
on an ongoing basis. Just as the auction of allowances was a new policy
innovation, so too might a new policy mechanism be developed by state or
local governments once a federal cap-andtrade program is in place. But
if Congress decides to preclude ongoing progress by the state and local
governments, such necessary future innovation may be impossible. As
explained above, the history of environmental regulation has been
characterized by an ebb-and-flow of action between the federal and state
governments. We appear to be entering an era of federal action on
climate change after a lengthy period in which states filled the vacuum
left by federal inaction. But the pendulum is sure to swing back in the
future, and the possibility-even likelihood-of the return of a period of
federal gridlock a decade or two in the future dictates the need to keep
all the tools in the toolbox, including the ability to act at the state
level. Furthermore, states are able to respond more quickly than the
federal government to new information and scientific and technological
developments. New information is always being developed in the climate
change area, including information regarding the scope and timing of the
response needed, the technological options available for mitigating
climate change, and the economics of responding to climate change. In
areas of environmental protection, states are often able to act more
quickly to adapt to new circumstances. 39 We\'must be mindful of the
possibility-indeed the likelihood-that a federal response will be
inadequate from the outset. It is virtually certain that any federal
legislation will not be completely comprehensive; it will probably not
apply to 100 percent of the nation\'s GHG emissions. Additionally, a
federal bill might not be sufficiently stringent to avoid the most
damaging effects of climate change in its first incarnation. This could
be due to a variety of factors including political compromise, poor
policy design choices, or lack of information. This is particularly
relevant to the changing nature of climate science. As we learn more
about the earth\'s climate system and our impact upon it, it is possible
we will have to accelerate reductions beyond what is deemed to be
\"necessary\" today. In this regard, the reduction targets in all the
major federal bills are based on the scientific consensus on the need to
keep atmospheric CO2 concentrations below 450 parts per million, which
requires emission reductions in the developed world of 80 percent by
midcentury. However, there is a growing minority view-led by Dr. James
Hansen and the writer Bill McKibbenthat contends that we have already
exceeded the safe level of 350 ppm, meaning that much more dramatic
action is needed.40 Five to ten years from now, this minority view may
become the majority view, sparking recognition of the need for more
action. By then, however, [**[power in Washington may have returned to
less progressive leadership, requiring states to fill the void once
again]{.mark}**. It is difficult to predict exactly what further action,
if any, may be necessary in the future. But this is precisely the reason
for allowing the states to take further action if it does become
necessary. The dynamic of the last eight years-in which states act in an
environment of federal inaction-could very well happen again.
**[Ignoring this history will make it even more likely that this history
will be repeated, to the detriment of the nationwide environment and
economy.]{.mark}**]{.underline}

**[[This year saw a subtle but significant shift in the way voters and
politicians think about climate change.]{.underline}]{.mark}**

Not only are more Americans worried about climate change [than ever
before](https://ecoamerica.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/ecoamerica-american-climate-perspectives-2017-annual-summary-1.pdf),
for the first time, a significant portion of the electorate rates
climate change as a top issue. In 2016, climate change was
the [sixth](http://climatecommunication.yale.edu/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Politics-and-Global-Warming-Spring-2016.pdf#page=19)
most important issue for liberal Democrats, according to Yale and George
Mason University, while today it's
their [fourth](http://climatecommunication.yale.edu/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Global-Warming-Policy-Politics-March-2018.pdf#page=23) most
important issue. It may be higher still. A recent [Marist
poll](http://maristpoll.marist.edu/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/NPR_PBS-NewsHour_Marist-Poll_USA-NOS-and-Tables_1810241423.pdf) found
that, among all Democrats, climate change is the second most important
issue, trailing only health care. And it's not just Democrats. In
particularly vulnerable parts of the country, like Florida, Republicans
are [worried](https://climatenexus.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/FL-Poll-Results-D2.pdf)too.

Politicians, in turn, are speaking to the ways that rising temperatures
are imperiling their constituents today. In South Florida, where rising
seas are [flooding
streets](http://uk.businessinsider.com/sea-level-rise-high-tides-sunny-day-flooding-coastal-cities-2018-4?r=US&IR=T) on
sunny days, Republicans sound like Democrats on climate change. Curbelo,
for example, recently broke with his party to propose a tax on carbon
pollution. Francis Mooney, who cruised to victory in a safe Republican
district in South Florida, [has
said](https://www.eenews.net/climatewire/2018/11/05/stories/1060105091) the
GOP should acknowledge that carbon pollution is fueling climate change
and worsening sea-level rise. At the state level, Florida Republicans
are more circumspect. Florida's next governor, Ron DeSantis,
has [called](https://www.eenews.net/climatewire/2018/11/05/stories/1060105091) for
building protections to keep seawater at bay, though he has waffled on
the cause of rising seas.

Elsewhere in the country, vulnerable Republicans demurred on climate
change, but
they [championed](https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/policy/energy/republicans-learn-to-love-wind-and-solar-jobs-after-once-mocking-them) clean
energy. Embattled Nevada senator Dean Heller, who lost his seat,
campaigned on extending the federal tax credit for electric vehicles.
California Republican Steve Knight, who similarly lost re-election in
his district north of Los Angeles, called for the Energy Department to
invest in energy storage.

Where Republican incumbents dismissed the threat posed by climate
change, Democratic challengers used the issue to bludgeon their
opponents. Across the country,

Democrats also made climate and energy local issues. Lizzie Fletcher,

It may be that, after years of disregarding climate change,
[[politicians are finally responding to voter
preferences.]{.underline}]{.mark} Nearly [eight in
10](http://climatecommunication.yale.edu/visualizations-data/ycom-us-2018/?est=regulate&type=value&geo=national) adults
want to regulate carbon dioxide as a pollutant, but congressional aides
grossly [underestimate](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/10/31/opinion/congress-midterms-public-opinion.html) public
support for capping carbon pollution. That may change. The 2018 election
suggests that politicians are edging closer to the people they
represent.

In addition to congressional races, this year saw a slate of ballot
measures aimed at protecting public lands, curbing the use of fossil
fuels, and bolstering clean energy. While several of these
proposals [failed](https://twitter.com/emorwee/status/1060234020611653634),
there seems to be growing support for climate initiatives. Voters in
Washington State, for example, narrowly rejected a fee on carbon
pollution, but the policy earned
more [support](https://www.nytimes.com/elections/2016/results/washington-ballot-measure-732-create-carbon-emission-tax) than
a previously proposed carbon fee, despite the fact that fossil fuel
companies spent tens of [millions of
dollars](https://insideclimatenews.org/news/29102018/election-2018-washington-carbon-fee-ballot-initiative-price-carbon-big-oil-opposition) to
defeat the measure. In Florida, voters approved
a [ban](https://dos.elections.myflorida.com/initiatives/initdetail.asp?account=11&seqnum=23) on
offshore drilling in state waters, and in Nevada, they approved
a [proposal](https://www.nvsos.gov/sos/home/showdocument?id=5824) requiring
the state get half its power from renewables by 2030.

The support for these measures is remarkable given that climate change
has long been seen as a political loser. The conventional wisdom is that
the issue is too abstract to resonate with voters, and that candidates
would be better off speaking to kitchen-table issues like jobs and
health care. Now it seems that climate change itself is becoming a
kitchen-table issue[[. A [recent
poll](https://blogs.chapman.edu/wilkinson/2018/10/16/americas-top-fears-2018/) found
that air pollution, water pollution, and climate change all ranked among
Americans' top fears, alongside not having enough money and being
saddled with high medical bills.]{.underline}]{.mark}

Politicians---some of them anyway---are speaking to these fears. In an
interview with Anderson Cooper on Monday, Senator Bernie Sanders said
that climate change should be a top priority for Democrats in the new
year, along with raising the minimum wage and lowering the cost of
health care. "You have \[the Trump administration\] not even recognizing
the reality of climate change and working hand in glove with the fossil
fuel industry to put more carbon into the atmosphere when we have to
transform our energy system," Sanders said. "I want us to begin moving
boldly to address the global crisis of climate change."

South Florida's newly elected representative, Debbie Mucarsel-Powell,
underlined this point in her [victory

"We celebrate tonight, but very soon I have to start to work," she said.
"Together, we are going to work for a country where we finally take

### CCS solves

carbon capture and storage,\" Princeton University,
https://www.princeton.edu/news/2017/09/01/leaks-will-not-sink-carbon-capture-and-storage)

The case for carbon capture and storage --- a promising method for
reducing greenhouse gases --- received a boost recently from a Princeton
University study that indicated the procedure would not be prone to
significant leakage or high costs related to fixing leaks.

In
a [[paper]{.underline}](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10584-017-2035-8) published
July 26 in the journal Climatic Change*, *the researchers concluded that
[[levels of leakage based on simulations at hypothetical subsurface
carbon dioxide storage locations, even in a worst-case scenario, would
not make the cost of the technology prohibitive in the global energy
system.]{.underline}]{.mark}

In carbon capture and storage, carbon dioxide gas, which is released
from burning oil and gas, is captured at a source such as a power plant.
The gas is compressed into a dense fluid and injected a kilometer or
more below the land surface for permanent storage. While the technology
is not yet being used in large scale, advocates believe it is a
promising strategy for climate change mitigation while fossil fuels are
still being used. A chief worry, however, is whether the gas could leak
and return to the atmosphere.

To reach their conclusion, the researchers mathematically simulated the
geophysical impacts of carbon storage, which include projections of
leaks, in combination with the economic impact of stopping leaks and
paying associated fines and penalties.

Hang Deng, a former doctoral student at Princeton and the paper's lead
author, explained that carbon capture and storage has been researched
for years, with many studies focusing on the efficacy of the process and
the potential for leakage. But the Princeton team wanted to understand
both the level of leakage and the economic implications of any escaping
gases.

"That link was not there before, and that is really what has motivated
our study," said Deng, who graduated in 2015 and is now a postdoctoral
researcher at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory. "I think this is
really the first attempt trying to make this link and using the
scientific findings (regarding geologic CO~2~ storage) to inform global
climate change mitigation efforts."

[[Catherine
Peters]{.underline}](http://www.princeton.edu/cee/people/display_person/?netid=cap),
an author and chair of Princeton's [[Department of Civil and
Environmental Engineering]{.underline}](https://www.princeton.edu/cee/),
said the researchers wanted to answer two questions: Would the
technology lead to significant leaks, and would the leaks have an
economic impact on commercial adoption of the technology? The answer to
both, she said, was no.

"Prior to this study, that question had not been answered," Peters said.

The study was done with modeling based on both the geophysical aspects
of carbon capture and storage, such as flow through subsurface
geological formations, and economic modeling of the global energy
market, using an integrated assessment model.

[["We studied the most worst-case scenarios,"]{.mark} Peters said. ["And
even with the extreme worst-case scenarios, we still found that the
CO~2~will be reliably trapped underground when you put it
there."]{.mark}]{.underline}

Deng said there were different types of impacts that were quantified.
[[These included groundwater contamination and escape into the
atmosphere. Another was the possibility that leaked CO~2~ may interfere
with subsurface operations such as natural gas
storage.]{.underline}]{.mark} In the modeling, however, the monetized
risks of those impacts were negligible.

That finding is highly important for the future of climate change
mitigation, Peters said. "For more than a decade, people have been
pointing to leakage as a potential barrier for widespread adoption of
carbon capture and storage," she said.

Deng's research was also unique in other ways.

"At Princeton, we are giving students a unique opportunity to conduct
research that combines different fields," Peters said. "This is an
unusual study in that we have a geophysics model and an economics model
together."

That cross-disciplinary work is encouraged by Princeton's PEI-STEP
Fellowship Program, which is a collaboration between the [[Princeton
Environmental
Institute]{.underline}](https://environment.princeton.edu/) and the [[Woodrow
Wilson School of Public and International
Affairs]{.underline}](http://wws.princeton.edu/).

Deng, who was awarded a competitive PEI-STEP fellowship, chose to work
with Peters on the engineering and geophysical modeling and
with [[Michael
Oppenheimer]{.underline}](http://wws.princeton.edu/faculty-research/faculty/omichael),
the Albert G. Milbank Professor
of [[Geosciences]{.underline}](https://www.princeton.edu/geosciences/) and
International Affairs and the Princeton Environmental Institute, on the
economic modeling and the policy analysis.

"It's because of that fellowship and this resourceful, industrious
student that we were able to come up with this unique finding, because
if you had studied just one or the other, we would not have learned what
we learned," Peters said.

This type of study across multiple disciplines is becoming increasingly
critical when it comes to solving thorny issues such as climate change,
Peters said.

Besides Peters and Deng, authors include: Michael Oppenheimer, director
of Princeton's Program in Science, Technology and Environmental Policy;
Jeffrey M. Bielicki of the John Glenn College of Public Affairs and
Department of Civil, Environmental and Geodetic Engineering at Ohio

#### Carbon capture is key

**Buck** **18** (Holly Jean Buck is a writer, geographer, and
sociologist of the future, currently working as a research fellow at
UCLA's Institute of the Environment and Sustainability. Her forthcoming
book (Verso, 2019) examines best- and worst-case scenarios for a world
after climate engineering, "The Need for Carbon Removal", 7/24/18,
https://www.jacobinmag.com/2018/07/carbon-removal-geoengineering-global-warming)
//uxm

[Massive removal of carbon from the atmosphere --- also known as
negative emissions, carbon drawdown, or regeneration --- could be a
cornerstone of either dystopian or radically utopian futures. Some of
the dystopian ones are well known: vast conversion of land to
plantations for biofuels with carbon capture and storage, displacing
people from the land, destroying habitats, and spiking food prices. But
given what we know about climate change in 2018, it's not enough to
protest against dystopian versions of carbon removal. **Too much warming
is already locked in. We need a radically utopian way of removing
carbon**. If we buy into thinking of carbon removal technologies as
substitutes for reducing carbon output, then industrial interests have
already won: they have set the narrative and the framing, where carbon
capture exists so that they can continue to emit. But we should demand
more from these technologies. **[Industrial carbon capture technologies
could]{.mark} instead [be used as an extension of decarbonization ---
mitigation to get us to zero, and carbon removal going a step further to
take emissions negative and address some of the climate impacts already
being felt]{.mark}**]{.underline}. It won't be easy. But climate science
suggests it's a challenge the Left must take up. [**Climate change has
already warmed the planet over 1°**C relative to pre-industrial
levels]{.underline}. Paradoxically, cleaning up the air pollution that's
currently masking some of the global warming in the pipeline would raise
temperatures another 0.5 to 1.1 degrees. [This means that **if we waved
a magic wand and suddenly (1) stopped using fossil fuels, and (2)
cleaned up air pollution, we would already be breaching 1.5°**C --- the
amount of warming that most climate advocates have argued for. **The
carbon budget is not an exact science, but [it seems we are hovering at
the point where 1.5°C of warming is locked in by what has already been
emitted]{.mark}**. Put differently, the most recent scientific evidence
suggests we have zero to five years before every additional ton of
carbon dioxide emitted would need to be compensated by a ton of negative
emissions to stay below 1.5°C. In fact, the scenarios used in the fifth
Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (**IPCC) report rely on
massive amounts of negative emissions** to curb warming to 1.5°C,
**primarily via** a method known as **bioenergy with carbon capture and
storage (BECCS**)]{.underline}. This led a team of modelers to try and
see what it would take to achieve 1.5° without BECCS. **[[Even a
scenario where renewables]{.mark}, electrification, and energy
efficiency [were aggressively pursued]{.mark} --- and 80 percent of meat
and eggs were replaced with cultivated meat, flying was reduced, and
tumble dryers were eliminated --- [could not eliminate the need for
carbon removal]{.mark}]{.underline}**. This scenario still required
about four hundred billion tons (Gt) of carbon dioxide removed via
reforestation. Reforestation sounds great and green, but it also has the
potential to result in dispossession, conflict over land access, and
worsened livelihoods for smallholders. [**What about achieving a
slightly less ambitious goal of 2°C? Two and 1.5 degrees might not sound
all that different, but they are**. The difference is one that threatens
entire unique coral ecosystems, the homes of five million people
(including entire countries), and high increases in the frequencies of
extreme events. Rapid mitigation could still curb warming to 2°C without
the use of negative emissions technologies. **But that window is closing
fast**. If near-term emissions reductions follow the trajectory laid out
in the commitments nations made under the Paris agreement, by 2030, 2°C
scenarios will also depend upon negative emissions]{.underline}. That
is, in the next decade, [**we would have to vastly exceed the Paris
promises to not depend upon negative emissions**. We aren't even making
much progress towards these Paris targets, which if achieved would still
produce 3°C of warming --- an amount widely agreed to lead to massive
disruptions]{.underline}. This is why negative emissions have become
such a useful device for the models. By the end of the century,
[scenarios for 1.5°C or 2°C envision pulling out ten billion tons (10Gt)
per year. For comparison, current levels of emissions are around forty
billion tons of CO2 per year. So 1.5°C means not just zeroing out those
forty billion tons, but then working to extract another ten billion on
top of that to be net-negative. **This would require scaling up current
carbon capture and sequestration efforts a thousand-fold**. Negative
emissions help maintain the narrative that although time is running
short, we can still stop catastrophic global warming if we act now. Once
we understand that this inventive arithmetic has been employed to
"solve" for 1.5, what do we do]{.underline}? Assuming there will be a
complete about-face that puts us on a course towards 100 percent
renewables, massive lifestyle changes, and drastic land use change for
afforesting millions of hectares in the tropics within the next ten
years strikes me as not only magical thinking, but thinking that puts
many at risk of great suffering. Alternately, [**accepting that the
earth will warm more than 1.5°C means accepting the loss of the world's
coral reefs and the half billion people relying on them, as well as
other harms to communities living on the front lines of climate
change**. So we need to ask: is there a form of massive carbon removal
that could be put towards socially just ends, pulling carbon out of the
atmosphere as a form of collective social good]{.underline}? Can it work
as an outgrowth of energy democracy? [For if such a collection of
technologies, practices, and institutions can exist, **we should try to
build it**]{.underline}. Notably, carbon removal at what I'll call
climate-significant scale should not be thought of as a magic wand to
wipe carbon away either. For one thing, it will not compensate exactly
for emissions. The ocean, for example, currently takes up close to half
of the carbon humans emit, and it's possible that if carbon was removed
at a large scale from the atmosphere, the oceans would then give off
carbon, perhaps replacing half of the carbon that had been removed.
**[The prospect of carbon removal is fraught with complexity, and even
peril --- all of which we have to talk about]{.underline}**. The best
way to remove carbon immediately is through "natural climate solutions,"
which employ nature's processes to store carbon in ecosystems.
Sequestering carbon in soil, restoring forests and planting new ones,
and protecting wetlands can store carbon. These can forestall some
amount of warming, in addition to other benefits for both humans and the
environment. [**Yet while it seems intuitive to simply let nature take
up the carbon, carbon was put into the atmosphere unnaturally, and the
available scientific evidence suggests [ecosystem-based solutions simply
don't scale]{.mark} well enough to contend [with the sheer amount of
carbon that has been dumped]{.mark} into the atmosphere**. Pursued
vigorously, reforestation and soil carbon sequestration could each
remove a few gigatons per year --- for a while. After a few decades, a
forest planted to remove carbon reaches a plateau where it becomes
saturated and can't remove any additional carbon, like a bathtub filling
up]{.underline}, at which point the already-absorbed carbon must simply
be held indefinitely. Similarly, a farm that has transitioned to
regenerative practices to store more carbon in the soil can only remove
additional carbon for a few decades. Moreover, forests can be ravaged by
epidemics or fires, resulting in the sudden release of their stored
carbon, which means they are vulnerable to global warming itself. [**So
while these projects can do important work in the near future, we also
need to supplement these one-off, land-based carbon removal projects
with systems that can continuously remove carbon and store it reliably
over centuries --- that is to say, with industrial carbon capture with
geological sequestration. We need to build systems that capture carbon
emissions from sources like power plants or factories, or even from
ambient air, and transport it to underground reservoirs where it can be
stored. There are major technical and social obstacles to this**. But
these industrial systems for geological storage, used together and
sequentially with natural carbon removal, could help ease the path to a
climate-stable world. Carbon capture and storage ([CCS)]{.mark}
technology [is not a new technology]{.mark}. The first large-scale
operations began in the 1970s, and there are around seventeen CCS
projects operational today. **CCS is actually a collection of
technologies: those needed to capture carbon emissions at a source;
technologies to transport it, usually by pipeline, to a storage site;
and technologies to inject it deep underground**. It can be used with
industrial operations like cement or steel production, with natural gas
power plants, with biomass-fueled power plants (BECCS), or in tandem
with devices that mine carbon from the air ("direct air
capture").]{.underline}

week. The Saskatchewan plant, which officially opened in 2014, is one
source of debate around the future of energy in Canada and the world,
however. In addition to criticizing troublesome cost overruns and
maintenance issues at the facility, opponents view carbon capture
technology as a stopgap between fossil fuels and truly clean sources of
power such as renewables. **[Proponents point to the the drastic
improvement the CCS process has over traditional coal-fired
generation]{.underline}**.

Two factors have now changed what was a rather simple and predictable
scenario: globalization and the Garamendi decision. As mentioned in
Section II-A, a hallmark of globalization is the increased reliance on
international institutions for arbitration of disputes; such an
institution would be the arbitration mechanisms under the North American
Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA). [Under the Anti-Expropriation clauses16 1
in the NAFTA agreement signed by the United States, a Canadian company
producing MTBEs claimed that California\'s ban on its methanol-based
product was in fact an expropriation in favor of domestically-produced
ethanol substitutes rather than a true environmental policy decision. 62
Although the long-term effect of the litigation is not yet clear, some
scholars have already supposed that such [litigation will severely erode
a state\'s ability to have its own environmental policy]{.mark}.
163]{.underline} Any damages under a Methanex-type complaint through
NAFTA would be paid out by the United States, though undoubtedly
pressure would be applied to the offending state to drop its ban to
lessen the damages (it is significant to note that the ban itself would
remain unmolested under the Anti-Expropriation clauses under NAFTA,
simply that damages must be awarded for its consequences to foreign
investors). [Added to this already bleak picture for a state\'s
environmental concerns now comes the Garamendi decision. Under
Garamendi, the federal government would not have to even apply pressure
(and thus, perhaps, a deal is struck for California\'s loss of
sovereignty on account of a federal treaty being interpreted in a
unfavorable way) to have the California ban dropped. Using similar
language to Deputy Secretary Eisenstat\'s that the Garamendi majority
relied so heavily on, 65 the federal government can simply state it
believes that NAFTA (or any similar trade agreement) \"occupies the
field,\" even if the initial document is ambiguous or does not
specifically preclude sub-national units from acting, just as the ICHEIC
did not specifically preclude state action. Preemption would then
largely turn on the convenience of the federal government and how it
felt entitled to use state economies in shifting diplomatic concerns. If
the federal government is finding itself subject to damage awards
because of state action, that convenience becomes advantageous. The
\"pressure\" mentioned above that has environmentalists worried about
the [continued viability of state policies could become a sledge-hammer
under Garamendi.]{.mark} The [federal government will be able to simply
preempt the state law by stating that law seems to affect what the
federal government believed]{.mark} (but did not articulate in any
formal agreement[) it had reserved to itself.]{.mark}]{.underline}

[[All else equal, this increases the likelihood of great power conflict

reduction in militarized interstate disputes.]{.underline} Nuclear
deterrence has helped curb violent conflict among the great powers.
Multilateral peacekeeping missions mitigate small country conflicts.
Even if there is a decline in interdependence, it is possible that the
"Long Peace" will endure. Furthermore, it is impossible to predict the
degree to which either innovations or geopolitics will lessen the need
for international trade. Even technological optimists acknowledge that
the future diffusion of 3D printing is unclear. Advocates of networked
manufacturing insist that economic openness is a prerequisite for the
process to continue.122 And the degree of geopolitical revisionism among
great powers might be endogenous---that is to say, preexisting levels of
globalization might constrain revisionist impulses, rather than such
impulses weakening the globalized economy. [[If great powers resort to
revisionist foreign policies]{.mark}, however, then [the global economy
will]{.mark} start to [resemble the Cold War era]{.mark} of economic
blocs and strategic embargoes---one in which [trade and investment
follow the flag]{.mark} rather than follow the rate of return. The
increased American use of targeted financial sanctions, for example, has
already generated grumblings from peer competitors about finding ways to
diversify away from reliance upon the dollar]{.underline}.123 In 2015,

[Of all the misconceived and poorly reasoned [judicial decisions that
have expanded presidential power in the field of national
security]{.mark}]{.underline}[, [thereby weakening the rule of law and
endangering individual rights, the Curtiss-Wright]{.underline}]{.mark}
[case of 1936 stands in a class by itself]{.underline}. I[t is
frequently cited by courts and the executive branch for the existence of
"inherent" presidential power]{.underline}. In language that is plainly
dicta and had no relevance to the issue before the Supreme Court,
[Justice]{.underline} George [Sutherland wrote: "It is important to bear
in mind that we are here dealing not alone with an authority vested in
the President by an exertion of legislative power, but with such an
authority plus the very delicate, plenary and exclusive power of the
President as the sole organ of the federal government in the field of
international relations --- a power which does not require as a basis
for its exercise an act of Congress, but which, of course, like every
other governmental power, must be exercised in subordination to the
applicable provisions of the Constitution]{.underline}."9

Justice Sutherland's distortion of the "sole organ" doctrine is examined
in the next section. Here [it is sufficient to point out that the case
before the Court [had absolutely nothing to do with presidential power.
It concerned only the power of Congress]{.mark}]{.underline}. The
constitutional dispute was whether Congress by joint resolution could
delegate to the President its power, authorizing President Franklin D.
Roosevelt to declare an arms embargo in a region in South America.10 In
imposing the embargo, [President Roosevelt relied solely on this
statutory --- not inherent --- authority]{.underline}. He acted "under
and by virtue of the authority conferred in me by the said joint
resolution of Congress."11 President Roosevelt made no assertion of
inherent, independent, exclusive, plenary, or extraconstitutional
authority. Litigation on his proclamation focused on legislative power
because, in 1935, the Supreme Court twice struck down the delegation by
Congress of domestic power to the President.12 [The issue in
Curtiss-Wright was therefore whether Congress could delegate legislative
power more broadly in international affairs than it could in domestic
affairs]{.underline}. A district court held that the joint resolution
impermissibly delegated legislative authority but said nothing about any
reservoir of inherent or independent presidential power.13 That decision
was taken directly to the Supreme Court, [None of the briefs on either
side discussed the availability of inherent or independent presidential
power. Regarding the issue of jurisdiction, the Justice Department
advised that the question for the Court went to "the very power of
Congress to delegate to the Executive authority to investigate and make
findings in order to implement a legislative purpose]{.underline}."14
The joint resolution passed by Congress, said the Department, contained
adequate standards to guide the President and did not fall prey to the
"unfettered discretion" found by the Court in the two 1935 decisions.15

[The brief for]{.underline} the private company,
[[Curtiss-Wright]{.mark}, focused solely on the issue of delegated power
and did not explore the availability of independent or inherent powers
for the President]{.underline}.16 [A separate brief]{.underline},
prepared for other private parties, [concentrated on the delegation of
legislative power and did not attempt to locate any freestanding or
freewheeling presidential authority]{.underline}.17 Given President
Roosevelt's stated dependence on statutory authority and the lack of
anything in the briefs about inherent presidential power, there was no
need for the Supreme Court to discuss independent sources for executive
authority.

Anything along those lines would be dicta. The extraneous matter added
by Justice Sutherland in his Curtiss-Wright opinion has been subjected
to highly critical studies by scholars. [One article regarded
Sutherland's position on the existence of inherent presidential [power
to be "(1) contrary to American history, (2) violative of our political
theory, (3) unconstitutional, and (4) unnecessary, undemocratic, and
dangerous]{.mark}.]{.underline}"18 Other scholarly works find similar
deficiencies with Sutherland's dicta.19 Federal courts repeatedly cite
Curtiss-Wright to sustain delegations of legislative power to the
President in the field of international affairs and at times to support
the existence of inherent and independent presidential power for the
President in foreign policy. [Although some Justices of the Supreme
Court have described the President's foreign relations power as
"exclusive," the Court itself has not denied to Congress its
constitutional authority to enter the field and reverse or modify
presidential decisions in the area of national security and foreign
affairs]{.underline}.20

a constitutional challenge to Section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act of
1962, thereby upholding the steel and aluminum tariffs that President
Donald Trump imposed in March 2018 on the basis of national security
concerns. Finding that it was "bound" by Supreme Court precedent, the
special threejudge panel of the CIT nevertheless acknowledged the
validity of many of the plaintiffs' arguments, with one judge expressing
"grave doubts" about the statute's constitutionality in a separate
opinion.]{.underline} The CIT decision, now on appeal before the Federal
Circuit, suggests that [[the Section 232 tariffs will likely remain in
place, absent]{.mark}]{.underline} congressional action or a departure
from [[precedent by the U.S. Supreme Court]{.mark}.]{.underline} The CIT
decision was issued in response to a June 2018 complaint filed by the
American Institute for International Steel and two member companies,
which claimed that Section 232 constitutes an improper delegation of
legislative authority in violation of Article I of the U.S. Constitution
and the separation of powers. Under the "non-delegation doctrine,"
Congress may not delegate any of its law-making powers, such as its
power to regulate trade, unless it provides an "intelligible principle"
or set of clear standards defining the extent of the delegation. The
plaintiffs contended that Section 232 permits the President "to
consider, in essence, anything in the Nation's economy that imports
might affect" because it fails to delineate what constitutes "national
security" and leaves it to the President's discretion to determine the
appropriate remedy. The case was widely considered a long shot, both
because a non-delegation challenge has not been upheld since 1935 and
because the Supreme Court, in Federal Energy Administration v.
Algonquin, had already ruled specifically that Section 232 "easily" met
the intelligible principle standard and was "clearly sufficient to meet
any delegation doctrine attack." While the plaintiffs argued that
Algonquin only concerned the specific remedy that the President had
selected, the CIT determined that the Supreme Court had "squarely
addressed" the non-delegation issue in Algonquin. [[Finding itself bound
by precedent]{.mark}, the CIT majority nevertheless acknowledged that
"the broad guideposts of \[the statute\] bestow flexibility on the
President and seem to invite the President to regulate commerce by way
of means reserved for Congress, leaving very few tools beyond his
reach." Unlike government agencies, the President is not subject to the
Administrative Procedure Act ("APA"). As a result, [decisions committed
to the President's discretion]{.mark}---such as those made under Section
232---[are not subject to judicial review on the basis of rationality,
findings of fact, or abuse of discretion]{.mark}.]{.underline}
International Trade 2 Judge Gary Katzmann, in a separate "dubitante"
opinion that is neither a concurrence nor a dissent, expressed "grave
doubts" that Section 232 "passes constitutional muster" and suggested
that it may be appropriate for the Supreme Court to revisit Algonquin.
Acknowledging that "as a lower court, it behooves us to follow the
decision of the highest court," [Judge Katzmann explained that "\[w\]hat
we have come to learn is that section 232 . . . [provides virtually
unbridled discretion to the President]{.mark} with respect to the power
over trade that is reserved by the Constitution to Congress." Although
Judge Katzmann did not dissent in light of the binding precedent, he
noted that "[it is difficult to escape the conclusion that the statute
has permitted the transfer of power to the President in violation of the
separation of powers."]{.mark}]{.underline} This constitutional
challenge may eventually land in the Supreme Court, but in the meantime
the Section 232 tariffs on steel and aluminum are likely to remain in
place. [Moreover, additional Section 232 actions---on automobiles,
uranium, and other imports---are in process or under
consideration]{.underline}

### 1ar preemption bad

#### Foreign affairs preemption destroys all federalism -- globalization means everything touches on international relations

A. [[Federal Preemption in an Age of Globalization]{.underline}]{.mark}

[[States]{.mark} and]{.underline} other [sub-national units [do not
operate in a foreign relations vacuum]{.mark}]{.underline}. As
corporations expand beyond the borders of their home countries,
[[contact between states]{.mark} regulating what was once within their
sole discretion [has taken on international importance. Sub-national
economies have]{.mark} economic [significance on the world
stage]{.mark}]{.underline}, and this significance is felt by
corporations and governments that are affected by differing controls
enacted by states.1 For instance, [in 2001 California\'s economy ranked
as the fifth largest in the world]{.underline}, behind the United
States, Japan, Germany, and the United Kingdom; New York, the next
largest state economy, was about 60% the size of California\'s. 2
Because of such a large stake in international trade, [[many]{.mark}
state and local [governments engage in]{.mark}]{.underline} limited
[[foreign relations, such as]{.mark} attempts to [attract]{.mark}
foreign [investment or deal with regional issues]{.mark} that extend
over national boundaries]{.underline}.3 [This brings into
question]{.underline} exactly [how far U.S. states can go when dealing
with foreign entities]{.underline} while still operating under their
traditional competencies outlined in the Constitution. The federal
government has jurisdiction in much out-of-state regulation thanks to
the Foreign and Interstate Commerce Clauses.4 In addition, the
Constitution spells out prohibitions against states engaging in specific
foreign affairs5 while reserving specific powers to the federal
government. 6 However, [while the Constitution grants specific powers to
the federal government as well as to the states, the framework does not
cover every possibility. Because of]{.underline} the effects
[globalization]{.underline} has brought, [[what was once]{.mark} largely
[the realm of the states]{.mark}]{.underline} (the regulation of
intrastate commerce) [[has]{.underline}]{.mark}, by the advance of
technology and business sophistication, [[encroached upon]{.mark}
traditional federal government]{.underline} 7[powers]{.underline}
([[foreign affairs]{.underline}]{.mark} and the interstate/foreign
commerce clauses). [[This]{.underline}]{.mark} conflict [has [led to a
series of Supreme Court decisions addressing]{.mark} the question of
when federal [preemption]{.mark} of state law is applicable. [The
question contains pitfalls for federalism]{.mark} concerns [when state
laws]{.mark}, which are facially constitutional, [conflict with]{.mark}
federal interests in [foreign affairs]{.mark}]{.underline} ([such
as]{.underline} multinational [trade]{.underline} agreements
[and]{.underline} maintaining [diplomatic relations]{.underline}).
[[This]{.mark} conflict [cuts to the core of]{.mark}]{.underline} the
recent resurgence of [[federalism and states
rights]{.underline}]{.mark}.8 [In an atmosphere where the expansion of
federal power]{.underline} along Interstate Commerce Clause lines [has
been checked, where the Supreme Court indicates it respects the
sovereignty of states]{.underline} to effectively govern within their
own borders, [[one must ask]{.mark} if that applies to actions which
have implications beyond their borders. [Does
globalization]{.mark}]{.underline} now [[prevent]{.mark} the [states
from acting]{.mark} where they otherwise could?]{.underline}
Furthermore, may the federal government commandeer large intrastate
economies for the coercive diplomatic power those economies have in
foreign affairs?

[In general, the executive branch, after complying with the terms of
applicable U.S. law, principally contained in the AECA, is free to
proceed with an arms sales proposal unless Congress passes legislation
prohibiting or modifying the proposed sale. Under current law Congress
faces two fundamental obstacles to block]{.underline} or modify [a
presidential sale of military equipment: it must pass legislation
expressing its will on the sale, and it must be capable of overriding a
presumptive presidential veto of such legislation. Congress, however, is
free to pass legislation to block or modify an arms sale at any time up
to the point of delivery of the items involved.]{.underline} This report
will be updated, if notable changes in these review procedures or
applicable law occur.

#### Under the AECA even post-plan, should congress attempt to limit an arms sale the president can just veto any joint resolution to end arm sales. This makes congressional control of Arm Sales virtually impossible

Baghdad, Iraq., Untangling the Yemen Arms Sales Debate, Lawfare,
<https://www.lawfareblog.com/untangling-yemen-arms-sales-debate>)

[The president's authority to engage in arms sales is rooted in statute.
Since at least
[1795](https://www.loc.gov/law/help/statutes-at-large/3rd-congress/session-2/c3s2ch53.pdf),
Congress has permitted the executive branch to transfer or sell arms to
allies to help advance their common defense interests]{.underline}. The
most recent version of this authority is provided by the [Arms Export
Control Act](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/22/chapter-39)
(AECA) in coordination with the related [Foreign Assistance
Act](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/22/chapter-32) (FAA).
Unsurprisingly, however, the modern Congress does not leave U.S. arms
sales entirely up to the president's discretion. Instead, it imposes a
number of conditions on what the president may sell (or permit to be
sold) and how.

Enacted in
[1976](https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/STATUTE-90/pdf/STATUTE-90-Pg729.pdf)
following a [series of arms sales-related
controversies](https://digitalcommons.wcl.american.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?referer=https://www.google.com/&httpsredir=1&article=1654&context=auilr#page=4),
[the AECA was originally intended to promote shared executive branch and
congressional control over arms sales.]{.underline} To accomplish this,
Congress
[amended](https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/STATUTE-90/pdf/STATUTE-90-Pg729.pdf#page=12)
Section 36 of the existing [Foreign Military Sales Act of
1968](https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/STATUTE-82/pdf/STATUTE-82-Pg1320-2.pdf)
to require the president to provide Congress with a "certification" of
any proposed sale of defense articles or services to a foreign
government---or any effort to license a private actor to conduct such a
sale---above a certain threshold in value 30 days before the
finalization of that sale. During the certification period, Congress
could object to the sale through a [concurrent
resolution](https://www.senate.gov/reference/glossary_term/concurrent_resolution.htm)---meaning
a resolution approved by the House and the Senate but not presented to
the president for signature or veto---pursuant to certain expedited
procedures defined in [Section
601](https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/STATUTE-90/pdf/STATUTE-90-Pg729.pdf#page=37)
of the AECA, which makes it possible for a senator to force at least a
procedural vote and ensure that the measure can proceed in a timely
manner so long as it has majority support. Such a resolution would,
under the AECA, prohibit the president from moving forward with the sale
unless he certified to Congress that "an emergency exist\[ed\] which
require\[d\] such sale in the national security interests of the United
States." Functionally, this procedure gave a simple majority in Congress
substantial control over U.S. arms sales.

[But this arrangement was not destined to last]{.underline}. In its 1983
decision in the matter of [INS v.
Chadha](https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=2221871582286121199&q=ins+v.+chadha&hl=en&as_sdt=20006),
[the Supreme Court held that a similar legislative veto provision in a
different statute was unconstitutional]{.underline}, because it evaded
the constitutional requirement that substantive legislation be presented
to the president for a potential veto before having legal effect. This
raised serious doubts as to whether the AECA's various legislative veto
provisions would withstand constitutional scrutiny if challenged in the
courts. In 1986, [Congress responded by
[amending](http://uscode.house.gov/statutes/pl/99/247.pdf) Section 36 to
substitute [joint
resolutions](https://www.senate.gov/reference/glossary_term/joint_resolution.htm)
in place of concurrent resolutions for the statute's legislative veto
provisions, ensuring their constitutionality. But this substantially
weakened congressional control, as the president now had the power to
veto any effort to stop a proposed arms sale.]{.underline}

#### Even right now with Congress more pissed than ever they are not going to be able to put together enough votes to actually stop the president from executing on an arms sale due to provisions in the AECA

If motivated by this latter logic, however, the Trump administration
appears to have miscalculated badly. On June 5, [a bipartisan coalition
of senators
[introduced](https://www.foreign.senate.gov/press/ranking/release/menendez-graham-murphy-paul-leahy-young-reed-announce-22-joint-resolutions-to-block-weapons-sales-to-saudi-arabia-and-uae-without-congressional-approval)
not one but 22]{.underline} [[individual joint resolutions of
disapproval]{.underline}](https://www.congress.gov/search?searchResultViewType=expanded&q=%7B%22source%22%3A%22legislation%22%2C%22search%22%3A%22%5C%22A+joint+resolution+providing+for+congressional+disapproval+of%5C%22%22%2C%22congress%22%3A116%7D),
[one for each]{.underline} DCS and [FMS case covered by Pompeo's
emergency pronouncement]{.underline}. Each resolution is currently
sitting in the Senate foreign relations committee, where chairman (and
Trump ally) James Risch would normally be in a strong position to
prevent them from coming up for a vote. [The expedited procedures
provided for in Section 601 of the AECA,]{.underline} however[, allow a
majority of the Senate to move a joint resolution of disapproval out of
committee, on to the Senate floor, and to a final vote in a manner of
days]{.underline}. (The AECA also
[directs](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/22/2776) the House to
treat any such resolutions as "highly privileged," though moving them
forward is less likely to be an issue there due to Democratic control.)

Notably, there was initially a [parliamentary
question](https://www.rollcall.com/news/congress/bipartisan-senate-group-seek-block-saudi-arms-sales-trump-administration-tries-avoid-congressional-review)
as to whether joint resolutions on arms sales moved forward under the
emergency exception could qualify for the Section 601 expedited
procedures---an ineligibility, perhaps, that the Trump administration
had been relying on. The Senate parliamentarian appears to have resolved
this question in favor of the resolutions' sponsors, as Senate Majority
Leader Mitch McConnell has since
[confirmed](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-06-10/senate-republicans-join-in-rebuke-of-trump-over-saudi-arms-sales)
that a vote to move the resolutions out of committee could take place as
soon as next week. Moreover, unlike concurrent resolutions in the
original AECA, any joint resolutions that are enacted into law through
these procedures will be free-standing legislation with independent
force of law. As a result, the resolutions' directive that each of the
22 specified transactions "is prohibited" should still be binding on the
executive branch.

[That said, it seems unlikely that any of the joint resolutions will
reach this stage]{.underline}. [Given that each is co-sponsored by four
Republican senators, they seem to have the minimum votes necessary to
pass the Senate as well as the Democrat-controlled House. But Trump
is]{.underline} almost [certain to veto them, and it seems unlikely that
two-thirds of both the House and the Senate will support an effort to
override these vetoes.]{.underline} [As a result, the outcome here is
likely to resemble the outcome of the Yemen war powers debate, with
Trump using his veto to continue to pursue his increasingly
unpopular]{.underline} Yemen [policies over bipartisan
objections]{.underline}. But to arrive here, the Trump administration
will have to weather many more rounds of floor debate that will put
bipartisan objections to the president's Yemen policies on full display
and associate his Republican allies with an increasingly unpopular war.
And the numerous vetoes Trump will have to deploy will no doubt make
clear to what extent he is pursuing those policies without the support
of Congress.

#### No spillover to other areas of law, powers shared between Congress and the President have higher standards to be allowed to be delegated, so the aff doesn't need to spillover to solve

**Cornell Law School,** The History of the Doctrine of Nondelegability,
DELEGATION OF LEGISLATIVE POWER,
https://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution-conan/article-1/section-1/delegation-of-legislative-power

That the delegation of discretion in dealing with foreign relations
stands upon a different footing than the transfer of authority to
regulate domestic concerns was asserted in United States v.
Curtiss-Wright
Corporation.[140](https://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution-conan/article-1/section-1/delegation-of-legislative-power#fn140art1)
There the Court upheld a joint resolution of Congress making it unlawful
to sell arms to certain warring countries upon certain findings by the
President, a typically contingent type of delegation. But Justice
Sutherland for the Court proclaimed that the President is largely free
of the constitutional constraints imposed by the nondelegation doctrine
when he acts in foreign
affairs.[141](https://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution-conan/article-1/section-1/delegation-of-legislative-power#fn141art1)
Sixty years later, the Court, relying on Curtiss-Wright, reinforced such
a distinction in a case involving the President's authority over
military
justice.[142](https://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution-conan/article-1/section-1/delegation-of-legislative-power#fn142art1)
[Whether or not the President is the "sole organ of the nation" in its
foreign relations, as asserted in
Curtiss-Wright,[143](https://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution-conan/article-1/section-1/delegation-of-legislative-power#fn143art1)
a lesser standard of delegation is applied in areas of power shared by
the President and Congress.]{.underline}

#### The president still has legislative ways to bypass congress

**Ford 6-11,** Matt, columnist for Newsrepublic and the Atlantic, A
Farewell to Arms Deals, The New Republic,
https://newrepublic.com/article/154160/trump-arms-deals-executive-power-democrats-congress

[Pompeo cited the Arms Export Control Act to justify the
administration's move, which includes a provision that [allows the
president](https://www.vox.com/2019/6/10/18659434/usa-saudi-arabia-trump-mbs-weapons-murphy-young)
to bypass congressional review if his administration determines that "an
emergency exists which requires the proposed sale in the national
security interest of the United States." What's striking is how
perfunctory the restrictions are in the first place: If Congress wants
to block a particular arms sale, lawmakers would need to pass a
resolution of disapproval by a two-thirds majority in both chambers to
overcome the president's likely veto]{.underline}. Traditional
Washington comity largely obscured this weakness, since the White House
would typically limit or scrap an arms deal if faced with enough
congressional criticism. [In the hands of a president with an iron grip
on one party and nothing but contempt for the other, it's more of a
blank check than a meaningful one]{.underline}. The raft of moribund
Cold War--era laws that give the president emergency powers in certain
circumstances, coupled with Trump's extraordinarily broad definition of
when they can be invoked, and the Supreme Court's supine deference to
those interpretations, has been a disastrous recipe for American
governance.

## Congress should have authority

#### Congress constitutionally should be in charge of arms exports

**Capito 7** \[Charles L. Capito III, JD-Washington and Lee University
School of Law, "Inadequate Checks and Balances: Critiquing the Imbalance
of Power in Arms Export Regulation", Washington and Lee University
School of Law,
http://lawdev.wlu.edu/deptimages/Law%20Review/64-1%20Capito%20Note.pdf\]

A legislative veto is unnecessary (and unconstitutional) in the context
of \"naturalization\" powers because there is a presumption that the
Executive\'s discretion is checked by the judiciary.318 The presence of
one of the presumptive checks from the Chadha majority distinguishes
Congress\'s power over immigration from its delegated power to regulate
the international trade of defense articles. **[Therefore, of the four
enumerated foreign affairs powers in the Constitution, only the power
\"to regulate Commerce with foreign Nations\" (more specifically, the
power to regulate arms transfers), has been (1) delegated to the
Executive and (2) precluded from meaningful judicial
review]{.underline}**. As a result, the hypothetical legislative veto is
appropriate only for situations implicating Congress\'s power to
regulate arms transfers. Not only can a definite line be drawn between
Congress\'s power over foreign commerce and its other enumerated powers
but this Note contends that another line can be drawn generally between
foreign and domestic affairs. Admittedly the line between the two is
sometimes hazy, but in most cases the distinction is clear. Congress
delegates much of its power in domestic affairs, but the difference
between delegated domestic authority and foreign affairs power is that
agency decisions made pursuant to domestic authority are presumably
reviewable. Once again, the availability of the judicial check on
executive discretion renders the legislative veto unnecessary in matters
of delegated domestic affairs. To summarize, this section argues tahat
Chadha generally precludes the use of the legislative veto. In
instances, however, where power goes unchecked, as is the case with
DDTC\'s interpretation of § 129, \"common sense and the inherent
necessities of the governmental coordination require a departure from
the formalistic rules prohibiting the legislative veto. The veto\'s use
must be judicious. It can apply only to the narrow situations that
implicate Congress\'s power to regulate arms transfers because all other
decisions made pursuant to delegated domestic powers are susceptible to
judicial review, and Congress\'s other foreign affairs powers have
either not been delegated or are reviewable by the courts. Therefore,
the argument that one exception will inevitably lead to the veto\'s
wholesale reintroduction is a non-starter because the legislative veto
may apply only to the narrow and defined area of congressional power
described above. 4. The Veto Legislation Can Be Thoughtfully Designed to
Avoid a Presentment Problem This Note\'s main purpose is to critique the
political imbalance regarding DDTC\'s interpretation of PTAR 5 129, and
the ineffectiveness of the checks and balances designed to remedy
similar situations.323 This Part\'s purpose is to suggest that a
legislative remedy, possibly in the form of a narrowly applied
legislative veto, is the most appropriate solution, but the exact
specifications and structure of the legislative veto are beyond the
scope of this Note. Before concluding, however, a brief discussion of
the legislative veto\'s construction is worthwhile. **[Because the
general use of the legislative veto is at odds with constitutional
formalities, the mechanism should be used only as a last resort. Thus,
any use of the veto should be subsequent to committee hearings whose
purpose is to inform the appropriate officials of Congress\'s
disapproval of the State Department\'s misinterpretation. Congress
already has the power to do this but lacks the significant threat of a
veto in its back pocket. Perhaps the mere threat of the veto will be
enough to steer the State Department\'s interpretations back on
track.324 To remedy the case at hand, the legislative veto provision
must give Congress the ability to object to statutory language it
observes being interpreted or used in a manner that is inconsistent with
Congress\'s wishes]{.underline}**. Louis Fisher, a renowned scholar of
presidential and congressional powers, defines legislative vetoes as
\"statutory provisions that delay an administrative action . . . during
which time Congress may approve or disapprove without further
presidential involvement.\"325 Using this definition as a framework,
this Note suggests that the AECA have a veto provision that requires
DDTC to submit its regulations (along with formal guidance as to how the
regulation is applied) to the foreign affairs oversight committee in
Congress. The committee, at that point, could choose to accept or veto
DDTC\'s interpretation. If Congress chose not to act within a short
period of time, then the agency\'s view would become binding. This
structure (as opposed to a veto provision that allows Congress to amend
regulations) does not threaten the Executive\'s independence because the
Executive retains control over the regulation\'s contents.326 The veto,
if exercised, would simply send the State Department and DDTC back to
the drawing board.327 The unicameral legislative veto in Chadha was
struck down because it violated the \"presentment\" and \"bicameralism\"
requirements of Article I.\~\~\~ Any revived version of the legislative
veto must address those two deficiencies. 324. See FISHER, supra note
266, at 212 (noting that Congress never used the veto power in the AECA,
but it was the threat of the veto that forced the Executive to
reconsider the trade of weapons). The \"bicameralism\" requirement329 is
the easiest deficiency to address. Any viable legislative veto must
ensure that its execution involve a vote in both Houses. The Presentment
on the other hand, is the requirement that cut \"the ground out from
under all legislative vetoes.\"331 Any legislative mechanism that will
effectively remedy the political imbalance must, however, avoid the
presidential veto or else the legislative veto becomes simply Article I
legislation.332 This Note raises a novel idea that is as fair as it is
untested. Essentially, the AECA would be amended in two ways. First,
Congress would be granted the legislative veto described above to
execute in situations in which an agency is effectively unchecked by the
other two branches. Second, veto provisions would include sunset clauses
requiring reauthorization every four to six years. The reauthorization
process, obviously, would be subject to the Presentment Clause and all
other Article I requirements. This scheme would give Congress the
necessary check on DDTC\'s interpretation of statutory language, while
also providing the Executive its constitutionally required veto power
(lest Congress stray too far from the Executive\'s foreign policy
objectives).

[**Thirty years ago, Congress reasserted its constitutional authority to
regulate arms transfers because \"\[tloo often in the past decisions
\[were\] made with respect to security assistance without the . . .
concurrence of Congress." Today, our arms export policy has once again
become unmoored from its constitutional foundations and unresponsive to
congressional influence. An absence of effective checks in the structure
of arms export regulation allows the Executive branch to operate
unilaterally and with impunity**.]{.underline} The lack of fundamental
constraints is particularly regrettable in the case of the State
Department\'s interpretation of 5 129.3, which perverts congressional
intent and would likely fail judicial review if review were available.
[**This imbalance of power not only flouts the basic principle that no
branch of government should go unchecked,335 but it has also caused
uncertainty within the defense industry, delayed the licensing process,
and threatened important policy objectives abroad**.]{.underline}
Strains on the United States\' defense industry significantly affect
some of the most volatile situations around the globe: It is vital that
the processes that control arms exports work with maximum efficiency and
clarity. **[Congress must, as it did thirty years ago, reassert its
power over the regulation and policy of arms exports.]{.underline}**
Recent events, such as the creation of a Senate subcommittee to oversee
the President\'s use of warrantless surveillance336 and the failure of
the administration\'s plan to handover port security to a Dubai firm,337
evidence Congress\'s ability and newfound willingness to respond to the
Executive\'s unilateral decision-making. Will the political imbalance
that plagues arms export control be next?

#### Arms sales should be under the Foreign Commerce Clause, a Congressional jurisdiction

[As in many areas of foreign policymaking, Both **Congress and the
President can claim some constitutional power to authorize arms sales.
United States v. Curtiss-Wright Corp. is often cited to support claims
of broad executive powers in foreign affairs. Language in the opinion
celebrates the \"very delicate, plenary and exclusive power of the
President as the sole organ of the federal government in the field of
international relations**---a power which does not require as a basis
for its exercise an act of Congress.\" Supporters of a strong executive
role in foreign affairs have seized on this conception and argued that
the opinion confirms a constitutionally-based general foreign affairs
power for the Executive. The general foreign affairs power, in tandem
with article Il\'s enumerated grants of power, can be read to support
the President\'s claim to constitutional authority in the arms sales
area.]{.underline} The commander-in-chief clause has historically been
seen to provide the Executive with wide- ranging power over military
matters even in peacetime. Further, the President may derive some power
in this area from the grant of general executive power in article[.
**Historically, Presidents have relied on the aggregation of these
powers to make executive agreements covering a wide range of
intergovernmental relations,** and this power can be seen as an
additional ground for assertion of executive power in this area. But
ironically, **given that dicta in Curtiss-Wright suggests an independent
role for the President in foreign affairs generally, the holding in the
case supports a less expansive view of the President\'s power in the
arms sales area**]{.underline}. The Supreme Court found that the statute
at issue in that case, granting to the President the power to prohibit
the sale of arms to certain countries, did not contain an
unconstitutional delegation of legislative power. [The holding thus
concedes that Congress has a role to play in arms sales. The Court would
have been hard pressed to argue for executive independence in the making
of arms sales given the strong congressional claims to participate in
arms sales. Congressional claims are derived from the foreign commerce
clause \[fn 25\] U.S. CONST. art. I, § 8, cl. 3. **The foreign commerce
clause allows Congress to regulate every aspect of trade with foreign
nations, including whether or not goods, including arms**, are sold at
all. See L. HENKIN, supra note 16, at 70 (\"The Commerce Power . . .
might be sufficient to support virtually any legislation that relates .
. . to foreign relations.\"); see also Note, supra note 20, at 310
(same).\[end footnote 25\]]{.underline} \]the \"spending power,\" the
power to dispose of U.S. property, the necessary and proper clause and
Congress\' general foreign affairs power. Given [Congress\' strong
textual claims to regulate arms sales]{.underline}, it will be rare that
a President will attempt to act on independent authority in the area.
Instead, the pressing question is how Congress should legislate so as to
ensure adequate scope for executive flexibility while exercising its
constitutional right to participate in decisionmaking. The history of
arms sales legislation, as in many other foreign affairs areas, has been
one of successive attempts to craft statutes that allow for delegation
without sacrificing participation in overall policy formulation. The
question of broad or narrow delegation of authority by Congress to the
President has often been determined by the values Congress wants to
maximize at a given time. [The executive branch argues that diplomatic
maneuvering demands the ability to make flexible responses and credible
offers. Indeed, in each of the three arms sales \"regimes\" employed in
the postwar period, Congress accepted the importance of executive
flexibility and credibility by delegating broadly. However, **Congress
has increasingly recognized the importance of others values, principally
the need for congressional oversight of executive action and
congressional participation in policymaking: in the two most recent
statutory regimes it has struggled to recalibrate the balance of power
to reflect these values.**]{.underline}

Diego Law School. William & Mary Law Review Volume 42 \| Issue 2 Article

https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/73968483.pdf\]

Nonetheless, [Curtiss-Wright is demonstrably wrong as a historical
matter, and it is wrong for reasons that have escaped the central focus
of many attacks upon it]{.underline}. As set forth below, whatever else
one thinks of Curtiss-Wright, it wrongly describes the understanding of
the drafters and ratifiers of the Constitution. [There was no theory of
extraconstitutional power in foreign affairs at the time the
Constitution was drafted and ratified. To the contrary, the
Constitution\'s drafters and ratifiers understood the Constitution as
the means to give the national government foreign relations power it
would otherwise lack.]{.underline} Surprisingly, no academic study has
comprehensively considered the 1787-89 understanding of the source of
foreign affairs power. Instead, criticism of Curtiss-Wright focuses upon
different time periods or broader issues, upon which consensus has
proved impossible. As a result, [Curtiss-Wright has survived despite
widespread attacks upon it. Once the focus is narrowed to the 1787-89
understanding of foreign affairs power, however, it should be
demonstrable beyond dispute that Curtiss-Wright is wrong upon this
point.]{.underline} Further, because Curtiss-Wright\'s reasoning depends
upon the claim that the Constitution was drafted against a background of
extraconstitutional powers in foreign affairs, once that claim is
rejected Curtiss-Wright as a whole becomes indefensible.

Prior criticism of Curtiss-Wright has failed to discredit the opinion
conclusively, in part because that criticism has claimed too much.
First, [Curtiss-Wright\'s critics often address not the question of
extraconstitutional power,]{.underline} but the opinion\'s secondary
claim that the President (as opposed to Congress) should have a
predominant role in foreign affairs.9 Proponents of congressional
leadership in foreign affairs have made powerful arguments in this
regard,\" but in spite of the attention given it, the matter remains
debatable. It is clear, at least as a practical matter, that the
President does play a leading role in foreign affairs, and has done so
since the founding.\"1 But the case against Curtiss-Wright need not turn
upon the scope of presidential authority in foreign affairs. [The truly
radical part of Curtiss-Wright is not its emphasis on presidential
power, but rather its claim that that power arose outside the
Constitution]{.underline}.

Curtiss-Wright\'s critics have also tried to prove more than necessary
in the area of state sovereignty. In so doing, they, as well as those
who defend the opinion, focus upon the wrong time period. Specifically,
they look not to 1787-89, but to the period surrounding independence
more than a decade earlier. Part of Curtiss-Wright\'s theory was that
the states were never fully sovereign. They passed, in Curtiss-Wright\'s
view, from being colonies to being subnational units in the newly
independent Union, and so never had foreign affairs power, which is an
attribute of full sovereignty.\' Attacks on Curtiss-Wright argue that
the states at one point were full sovereigns, and therefore
Curtiss-Wright cannot be correct on this point.\'\" But the former
proposition is widely disputed, as there are two competing historical
theories about what hi7ppened at the moment of independence: that the
states became independent separately and then created the Union, and
that the Union declared independence and so established the collective
independence of the states.\'4 Moreover, the debate has far-reaching
implications in other areas, such as claims of states\' rights based on
inherent state sovereignty and claims of inherent federal powers in
other fields. 5 Because the historical attack on Curtiss-Wright has
depended upon establishing the historical priority of the states-with
consequent implications for state sovereignty-it has proved unpersuasive
to those committed to the alternate historical reading; those skeptical
of state sovereignty cling to Curtiss-Wright, not so much for what it
says about foreign affairs powers, but for what is says about state
versus federal power in general.

A further difficulty is that [critics of Curtiss-Wright]{.underline}
have not gone far enough in one respect: they [have not offered a
constitutional alternative to the theory of extraconstitutional foreign
affairs power]{.underline}. [Curtiss-Wright is attractive]{.underline},
despite its drawbacks, [because]{.underline} [it]{.underline} appears to
[answer]{.underline} three difficult que[s]{.underline}tions regarding
foreign affairs: [the source of federal foreign affairs power, the
allocation of federal foreign affairs power, and the extent of the
foreign affairs power of the states]{.underline}

The Constitutionality of Human Rights Legislation In conditioning
military aid to foreign countries on their respect for human rights,
[Congress treads in an area of constitutional uncertainty. The U.S.
Constitution leaves open to dispute which branch of the government is to
direct the course of foreign policy.24 The enumerated powers of the
President in this area are few]{.underline}: the commander in chief
power,25 the power to receive ambassadors,26 and (with the advice and
consent of the Senate) the power to make treaties and appoint ambassa-
dors and other officers of the United States.27 The President also is
charged with exercising the \"executive Power\" 28 and is required to
\"take Care that the Laws be faithfully executed.\" 29 Case law and
executive practice have added an unenumerated \"foreign affairs\" or
\"sole organ\" 30 power as well, **[although its content is far from
clear]{.underline}**.31 **[The enumerated powers of Congress relating to
foreign affairs include the power to]{.underline}** declare war,32 to
establish, support and regulate the armed forces, 33 to define and
punish offenses against the law of nations, 34 and to **[regulate
foreign commerce]{.underline}**.35 More generally, **[the Constitution
vests in Congress the authority to provide \"for the common Defense and
general Welfare of the United States]{.underline}**.\"\'36 In addition,
Congress derives implied \[FN 24\] As they have evolved**, [the foreign
relations powers appear not so much "separated" as fissured, along
jagged lines indifferent to classical categories of governmental power:
some powers and functions belong to the President, some to Congress,
some to the President-and-Senate]{.underline}**[;]{.underline} some can
be exercised by either the President or the Congress, some require the
joint authority of both[. **Irregular, uncertain division renders claims
of usurpation more difficult to establish and the courts have not been
available to adjudicate them.**]{.underline} \[End FN 24\] powers from
the \"necessary and proper\" clause,3 7 as well as from an unenumerated
congressional \"foreign affairs\" power.38 **[Undoubtedly Congress has
the authority, under the foreign commerce power, to regulate sales of
weapons and technology to foreign countries. Equally clear, the
disbursement of foreign aid is a function of the spend- ing power of
Congress]{.underline}. 3 9 [It does not follow, however, that Congress
may exercise these powers in any way it chooses. The powers are
exclusive]{.underline},** in that no other branch on its own authority
may spend for the general welfare or regulate foreign commerce, and they
**[are unquestionably broad]{.underline}**, but they are not without
limits. Even in the exercise of its exclusive powers, Congress is bound
by the Constitution, and it cannot violate constitutional constraints on
federal authority. Congress could not, for example, appropriate funds to
estab- lish an official religion. It could not pay government employees
dispa- rately according to their race. Nor could it withhold salaries to
certain federal employees because it believes they are \"subversives.\"
\'40 **[Other limits on Congress, less clear perhaps, derive from the
separa- tion of federal powers]{.underline},41 and it is [these limits
that may be implicated in Congress\' control over foreign aid and arms
sales. To what extent do the powers vested by the Constitution in the
Executive Branch constrain Congress\' discretion to spend for the
general welfare and to regulate commerce among foreign
nations]{.underline}**[?]{.underline} While the Supreme Court has never
struck down any use of the spending power as an infringement upon ex-
excutive authority,42 certain limits must exist. For example, in
exercising its spending power, Congress cannot nullify a power that
belongs exclu- sively to the Executive. In particular, it is unlikely
that Congress could refuse to appropriate money for the salary of an
ambassador or for the maintenance of an embassy. Congressional action of
this sort would un- abashedly intrude on the President\'s exclusive
appointment and recogni- 43 tion powers. Human rights restrictions on
foreign aid and trade do conflict with the President\'s recognition
power and its emanations. Directing the Presi- dent to declare a country
a gross violator of human rights44 would cer- tainly affect, and might
well jeopardize, U.S. relations with that country. To put this argument
at its strongest, a congressional human rights pol-icy could result in a
severance of diplomatic relations. But this situation is different from
a decision by Congress to cut off all funds for an em- bassy. The latter
is a direct nullification of the President\'s power to es- tablish
diplomatic relations; the former is a legitimate legislative policy- to
avoid funding governments that deny their citizens fundamental human
rights-that might result in the deterioration of diplomatic rela-
tions.45 As Louis Henkin has written: It has been argued that
increasingly foreign policy takes the form of spend- ing programs; that
\[aid programs\] in particular are \... essential indicia of friendly
relations with many countries; that decisions as to aid are therefore
properly the President\'s responsibility and Congress can no more refuse
the President appropriations for foreign assistance than for
maintaining\' an embassy. Here the argument for Congressional
independence is surely stronger. Foreign assistance seems not merely an
appropriation of funds to implement policies which are primarily the
President\'s responsibility but a form of spending for the general
welfare of the United States, and it is difficult to accept that the
President should command a power expressly conferred 46 upon Congress.
Champions of executive autonomy may also argue that human rights
restrictions interfere with the \"sole organ\" power of the President,
or, as Justice Sutherland wrote in Curtiss-Wright,the power of \"the
President alone . . . to speak or listen as a representative of the
nation. \' 47 This doctrine has doubtful merit as a statement of
constitutional principle.48 [However, **even if the President does
possess a \"sole organ\" power requir- ing \"one voice\" in foreign
affairs, it does not follow that Congress should be denied a role in
shaping the content of that voice**.]{.underline}49 In the case of
Guatemala, for instance, direct communication by Congress with the
Guatemalan government might unconstitutionally infringe on the Presi-
dent\'s \"sole organ\" power.50 But Congress is not forbidden from
directing the President to refuse, in his single voice, aid to
Guatemala[. **If any content can be imputed to the \"sole organ\" power
of the President, it cannot utterly disempower Congress from acting
under its express con- stitutional authority to regulate foreign
commerce and provide for the common defense and general
welfare.**]{.underline} 51 **[Congress and the President are partners in
the making of foreign pol- icy, and while each has exclusive powers,
they frequently occupy the same terrain.]{.underline} [The actions of
one affect the actions of the other]{.underline}**, and human rights
legislation is no exception. [**It could not be otherwise**, **with- out
sacrificing the principles of a constitutional scheme that places great
value on a system of checks and balances. Congress, therefore, has the
constitutional power to enact human rights restrictions on foreign aid
and trade**]{.underline}. Because, under Article II, the President
\"shall take Care that the Laws be faithfully executed,\" 52 it is
unconstitutional for the President not to enforce human rights legisla-
tion. However, the courts are loath to adjudicate foreign policy
disputes between Congress and the President, labeling such disputes
nonjusticia- ble political questions 53 or denying standing to the
litigants. 54 In the political arena, a successful challenge to
executive action is also difficult, and may require the two-thirds vote
necessary to override the President\'s veto. Thus, while the
Administration has no constitutional authority to avoid executing human
rights statutes, it may often find the political power to evade their
provisions.

https://definitions.uslegal.com/d/delegation-doctrine/)

[The Delegation doctrine is a principle limiting Congress\'s ability to
transfer its legislative power to another governmental branch,
especially the executive branch.]{.underline} This is based on the
separation-of-powers concept. It says that the power to declare whether
or not there shall be a law, to determine the general policy to be
achieved by the law, and to fix the limits within the limits within
which the law shall operate is vested by the constitution in the
legislature and it shall not be delegated. Therefore any statute
conferring excessive legislative power is invalid because it is
unconstitutional to delegate powers**[. [Delegation is permitted only if
Congress prescribes clear and adequate standards to guide an executive
agency in making the policy.]{.mark}]{.underline}**

All states whose constitutions contain a separation of powers doctrine
have adopted some version of the delegation doctrine, which permits the
legislature to delegate the administration of the law, to non
legislative entities, such as administrative agencies. Thus, [[the
delegation doctrine allows the legislature to focus on the fundamentals
of a law leaving to the agencies the task of filling in the gaps by
promulgating rules to administer the law.]{.mark} However, if
legislation does not provide adequate standards for the agency charged
with the task of filling in the legislative gaps, courts can invalidate
the legislation.]{.underline}

<https://chicagounbound.uchicago.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=12236&context=journal_articles>)

During the New Deal period, three kinds of issues were submitted for
agency resolution: legalistic, technocratic, and political.100
Legalistic decisions involve the application of law to fact. They rarely
call for broad judgments of policy or technical specialization. An
example of a legalistic decision is the choice of an administrative law
judge to award or to withhold disability benefits under the standards
set out by the Social Security Act.\' 0\' In cases of this sort,
Congress might as well have placed the decision in the hands of state or
federal judges. The decision to delegate authority to an administrator
is partly a matter of convenience and partly a product of a desire to
limit the number of and burdens on article ITl judges. By contrast,
technocratic decisions involve the application of expertise to policy
goals that Congress has clearly identified. An example of a technocratic
decision is an administrative determination of the proper method for
attaining a specified level of pollution. The decision to delegate
authority to an administrative agency in this context is based on the
need for specialization and perhaps the desire to avoid the distorting
effects of partisanship. Finally, political decisions call for a large
measure of value judgment; they involve basic issues of the distribution
and allocation of resources. A decision concerning regulation of
carcinogens in the workplace is essentially political, for the decision
cannot depend solely or even primarily on application of technical
expertise**[. The reason for the delegation of power to an
administrative actor]{.underline}** might **[be]{.underline}** the
absence of political consensus, the desire to avoid political
responsibility for the decision, or **[a belief that insulation promotes
sound decisions.]{.underline}**

#### **The thesis of the aff disproves the DA\-- the executive currently has the power to raise taxes and tariffs, a Congressional jurisdiction**

for Vox, "Why Trump can raise steel tariffs without Congress", Mar 8,
2018, <https://www.vox.com/2018/3/8/17097206/trump-tariffs-congress>)

[Raising taxes and tariffs is usually Congress's job]{.underline}. But
on Thursday, [President Donald Trump officially raised tariffs on steel
and aluminum imports, despite widespread opposition from Republicans in
Congress]{.underline} --- [and it was completely in his
right]{.underline} to do so. [Trump signed an executive
order]{.underline} calling on the Commerce Department [to impose a 25
percent tariff on steel imports and a 10 percent tariff on
aluminum]{.underline}. [His reason: Foreign countries' current trade
practices with the United States are a threat to national
security]{.underline}. [By law, that's enough of a reason to bypass
Congress]{.underline} altogether. It's left his party in a lurch.
[Congressional Republicans spent much of Thursday unsure of what Trump
would actually do on tariffs]{.underline}. On Wednesday, [107 House
Republicans wrote Trump a letter imploring him not to impose
tariffs]{.underline}. Many Republican senators --- including ranking
Sens. John Thune (SD) and Orrin Hatch (UT) --- have advised the
president against the action as well. Sen. Ben Sasse (R-NE) went so far
as to say you'd "expect a policy this bad from a leftist
administration," not a Republican one. Already, Sen. Jeff Flake (R-AZ)
has said he will propose a bill to nullify the tariffs. "[These
so-called 'flexible tariffs' are a marriage of two lethal poisons to
economic growth --- protectionism and uncertainty," Flake said in a
statement. "Trade wars are not won, they are only lost. Congress cannot
be complicit as the administration courts economic
disaster."]{.underline}

The only way Congress could really stop the tariffs is by passing a
measure with a veto-proof majority that would either strip Trump's
executive powers over tariffs or undo the ones he has put in place.
Needless to say, in a contentious midterm year, both options carry great
political risk. Why the president can impose tariffs without Congress's
approval The Constitution is pretty clear: It's in Congress's power "to
lay and collect taxes, duties, Imposts and Excises, to pay the Debts and
provide for the common Defence and general Welfare of the United
States," and regulate trade between the US and other countries. But
[over the past century, Congress has shifted many of the powers to raise
and lower tariffs to the executive branch]{.underline} (a concentration
of power that conservatives now decry). [There are many ways the
president can impose tariffs without congressional
approval]{.underline}. To name a few: [Through]{.underline} [the Trading
With the Enemy Act of 1917, the president can impose a tariff during a
time of war]{.underline}. But the country doesn't need to be at war with
a specific country --- just generally somewhere where the tariffs would
apply. (This is how Richard Nixon imposed a 10 percent tariff in 1971,
citing the Korean War.) The [Trade Act of 1974 allows the president to
implement a 15 percent tariff for 150 days]{.underline} [if there is "an
adverse impact on national security]{.underline} from imports." After
150 days, the trade policy would need congressional approval. There's
[the International Emergency Economic Powers Act of 1977]{.underline},
which would [allow the president to implement tariffs during a national
emergency]{.underline}. Trump's White House cited [Section 232 of the
Trade Expansion Act of 1962]{.underline}, a provision that [gives the
secretary of commerce the authority to investigate and determine the
impacts of any import on]{.underline} the [national
security]{.underline} of the United States --- [and the president the
power to adjust tariffs]{.underline} [accordingly]{.underline}. In this
case, Wilbur Ross, Trump's commerce secretary, conducted an
investigation, which Trump called for last April, into the impacts of
steel and aluminum imports. That report was [enough legal
justification]{.underline} for Trump [to bypass both Congress and the
independent US International Trade Commission (USITC]{.underline}),
which is typically called on to weigh in on proposed tariffs. (When
President George W. Bush imposed steel tariffs in 2002 as temporary
safeguards, it required USITC oversight.) Republicans in Congress are
really not a fan of these tariffs For months, congressional Republicans
and Trump's former top economic adviser Gary Cohn --- who resigned from
office this week --- have been trying to convince the president that
imposing tariffs on steel and aluminum imports is a bad idea. But on
Thursday, Trump made it clear that he doesn't care what his party
thinks, highlighting one of the key policy divides between him and many
Republicans. Congressional Republicans went through a kitchen sink of
concerns about Trump's trade proposal. [Critics say angering US trading
partners will lead to retaliatory countermeasures]{.underline}, which
could cost Americans jobs and raise prices for American businesses that
buy steel and aluminum. Even one of Trump's most consistent defenders,
Rep. Mark Meadows (R-NC), who chairs the conservative House Freedom
Caucus, tweeted against the proposal --- although, notably, he put the
onus on the Commerce Department, not Trump. Thune and Kansas Republican
Sen. Pat Roberts said they were worried about [the agricultural
industry]{.underline}, which [could be targeted in a trade
war]{.underline}. "I'm not very happy," Roberts said. Sen. Ron Johnson
(R-WI) said the aluminum tariffs could impact the beer industry in his
state.

[The 1930s featured an increased number of instances in which Congress
chose to explicitly or implicitly delegate its powers to the executive
branch]{.underline} or to agencies staffed by the executive. In the
early years of the New Deal several new federal agencies were created by
delegation, and in two cases in the mid 1930s the Court struck down
provisions of the National Industrial Recovery Act on on the ground that
Congress's delegation of its powers to the executive had not provided
adequate standards for making decisions. Meanwhile Congress had been
doing some delegating in the foreign relations arena as well: [a joint
resolution it issued in 1934 gave power to the President to prohibit
American arms manufacturers from shipping weapons to foreign nations if
he found that such a prohibition would "contribute to the establishment
of peace." One arms manufacturer, the Curtiss-Wright Export Company, was
prohibited by President Roosevelt from shipping aircraft machine guns to
Bolivia, and challenged the order as an unconstitutional delegation of
legislative power to the executive branch.271 As we have seen, there had
been a long history of foreign affairs decisions being regarded as
"submitted to the Executive" under the Constitution. But Roosevelt's
prohibition of overseas arms sales, which could be triggered simply by
his personal judgments about the effects of those sales, seemed to
resemble the standardless delegations that the Court had found in the
National Industrial Recovery Act cases]{.underline}. Moreover, the 1934
executive order ending arms shipments to Bolivia was not the only
example of Congressional delegations to the executive in the foreign
relations sphere. A year earlier the United States had recognized the
Soviet Union after 15 years of non-recognition, but the form of
recognition had not been the traditional form of a treaty with Senate
ratification. It had been an executive agreement which was the result of
diplomatic correspondence between Roosevelt and the Soviet Commissar of
Foreign Affairs Maxim Litvinov.272 An important feature of the Litvinov
Agreement, as it was known, was the assignment to the United States of
all amounts owed by American nationals to the Soviets. Most of the
assigned obligations were based on the Soviet government's confiscation
of assets owned by Americans in Russia at the time the Soviets seized
power. The Litvinov Agreement had the effect of legitimating that
confiscation and making the United States government the creditor of a
variety of persons that had owned property in pre-Soviet Russia. Between
1937 and 1945 the Court decided three cases related to the exercise of
executive power in connection with the 1934 presidential arms embargo
and the Litvinov Agreement. In each case the Court held that the
exercise of power was within the discretion of the President, passed
constitutional muster, and represented a policy decision of the United
States government that superceded contrary law and was binding on the
courts. [The cumulative effect of the decisions was to significantly
expand the category of cases that were "submitted to the executive"
under the Constitution. In the first case, United States v.
Curtiss-Wright Export Co., 273 Justice George Sutherland, for the Court,
propounded the novel theory that the federal government's powers in the
area of foreign relations were "inherent," deriving from national
sovereignty rather than from the Constitution, and were thus not subject
to constitutional restraints such as the non-delegation
doctrin]{.underline}e. In addition, Sutherland's Curtiss-Wright opinion
canvassed reasons for what he called the "plenary and exclusive power of
the President\....in the field of international relations."274 He cited
the longstanding practice of Congress's delegating power to the
President to negotiate international treaties, and suggested that this
provided an argument for "the constitutionality of the practice."275
[Both his "inherent powers" theory and his argument from practice were
subject to the objection that they confused the United States's status
as an international entity with the status of the federal government
under the Constitution. The power of the federal executive to negotiate
international agreements presupposes that those agreements, when they
affected the states or American citizens, are subject to constitutional
limitations. Few commentators, however, criticized the Court's
conclusion in Curtiss-Wright that the President had discretion to
suspend the foreign arms sales of American corporations at his pleasure.
The Court then relied on Curtiss-Wright in two subsequent decisions, the
1937 case and the 1942 case of United States v. Pink, 278 in which it
found that the Litvinov Agreement's assignment provisions represented
policies of the United States government which superceded state law and
could not be reviewed by the courts.]{.underline} Both cases involved
the disposition, in New York state, of assets that had been confiscated
by the Soviet government and assigned to the United States under the
Litvinov Agreement. In both the Court concluded that the claims of the
United States to the assets, which had originally been owned by a
Russian metal works corporation and a Russian insurance company,
prevailed over those of Russian nationals or creditors, even though that
disposition was contrary to the rules of New York state for distributing
assets. "\[T\]he policies of the States become wholly irrelvant to
judicial inquiry," Douglas wrote for the Court in the Pink case, "when
the United States, acting within its constitutional sphere, seeks
enforcement of its foreign policy in the courts."279 Even though the
Litvinov Agreement was not a treaty, it prevailed over competing state
law.

Climate Federalism Clarity and the Constitutional and Statutory
Minefield

Rounded analysis of federalism hedging and the climate challenge
requires a brief foray into doctrinal analysis. Whatever the federalism
and preemption mix ultimately adopted to address climate change,
encourage clean energy, or address another regulatory challenge, federal
statutory language about federalism must be clear and explicit to avoid
regulatory and market uncertainty. Even if a new federal
climate-targeted law remains elusive, a modest statutory amendment to
either federal environmental laws, energy laws, or a freestanding
enactment addressing state climate and clean energy regulatory authority
would help ensure that state and regional clean energy and climate
regulation efforts do not run afoul of federal statutory law or face
dormant Commerce Clause challenges. Current state and regional efforts
are already imperiled by preemption and constitutional challenges.326
Such arguable infirmities arise due to state efforts to take
responsibility for reducing their jurisdiction's own emissions, reduce
compliance costs by embracing cross-state and even international trading
options, and, especially, ensure that their regulation does not simply
result in the transfer of energy production or leakage of GHG emissions
to other jurisdictions. A raft of judicial rejections and some limited
successes confirm the need for explicit and effective statutory
drafting. For example, even if well-intentioned, state barriers to the
interstate movement of business activity and energy can violate FERC's
exclusive jurisdiction over interstate and wholesale energy markets, as
the Supreme Court found in 2016 in striking down a Maryland law that
sought to incentivize construction of clean energy production.327 Under
somewhat distinguishable programs, state clean energy strategies in
California and Minnesota were challenged on both statutory and
constitutional grounds. California's program to assess fees based on
climate impacts of fuel transportation was upheld in a decision focused
on dormant Commerce Clause doctrine.328 Minnesota's limitation on
importation of energy from out-of-state generators was rejected, but
with the three appellate judges dividing on the underlying rationale.329
Other energy and climate-linked measures also have met with judicial
rejection due to preemption. For example, municipal measures to improve
the energy efficiency of buildings were found by a district court to be
preempted under a federal law setting uniform appliance efficiency
standards.330 The Supreme Court's construction of the Clean Air Act's
most preemptive provision further creates federalism and preemption
uncertainties. In the Engine Manufacturers331 case, despite the Clean
Air Act's savings clause and State Implementation Plan provisions, the
Supreme Court rejected local measures mandating clean motor vehicle
fleets.332 Such measures were held preempted by the Clean Air Act
provision setting forth a national emissions standard for new motor
vehicles, subject only to a carve-out for California; the Court declined
to limit the reach of the law's preemptive language to regulation
directed at manufacturers.333 The Court held that the law also preempted
state and local regulation targeting motor vehicle purchase choices.334
Efforts by municipalities to require clean taxicab fleets have been
similarly rejected in the lower courts.335 And when New York sought to
preclude trades of power plant pollution that would result in increased
Midwestern power plant pollution that would drift back to New York, the
Second Circuit found that such regulation illegally frustrated the Clean
Air Act's acid rain trading program's goals of a cost-effective freely
operating market in sulfur dioxide allowances.336 Because so many
activities and categories of regulation link to energy usage and GHG
emissions, little state or local regulation is sure to avoid conflict
with current federal laws or future climate-directed legislation or
regulation. And if such a future federal climate law or regulation were
to adopt market-based modes of regulation or in other respects seek
cost-effective regulation or even just provide incentives for desired
innovations, any additional state and local regulation could be viewed
as posing an obstacle to those market-facilitating and costeffectiveness
goals.337 Two main strategies could avoid constitutional and statutory
challenges to state and local efforts to produce cleaner energy and
limit GHG emission. The first option is for Congress or agencies to
provide careful articulation of categories of permissible activity.
Explicit statutory permission can overcome both statutory preemption
concerns and dormant Commerce Clause infirmities. However, due to the
massive variety of government choices and actions influencing energy
usage and GHG emissions, comprehensive express carve-outs from conflict
preemption risks would be difficult to craft. A better or perhaps
accompanying option would be to create a regulatory or adjudicatory
regime that would protect state and local climate and energy efficiency
regulation unless stakeholders in agency or judicial venues established
that such state and local measures posed a substantial obstacle to
federal ends.338 Preemption doctrine may already be moving in the
direction of assessing actual evidence of undue state frustration of
federal ends.339 Courts should not find obstacle preemption without
assessment of the magnitude of the conflict, state and local
motivations, and consideration of other benefits of such state and local
regulation, including horizontal and vertical learning about the
efficacy of alternative regulatory options.340

CONCLUSION Monopolies are always problematic. In debates over the
content of ideal federal climate legislation or regulation, prominent
scholarly, political, and industry advocates have argued for preemption
of state climate regulatory authority. Such arguments fail to consider
the beneficial dynamics created by what this Article labels federalism
hedging. Despite the intuitive appeal of a preemptive single market
structure for a worldwide problem that would benefit from marketbased
regulation at the largest scale possible, a preemptive regime could
create incentives for strategic reversal efforts or actions to derail
legal implementation. This nation's progress would be almost completely
dependent on a federal regulatory monopoly and a single law. As with
other regulatory challenges characterized by rapid change, innovation,
and turbulent politics, retaining state and local climate authority both
intertwined with and possibly independent from federal climate
regulation would create a more sturdy and resilient web of regulation,
stabilize linked markets, and discourage efforts to derail a federal
climate law. The mere possibility of more state regulation would create
heightened incentives for successful federal regulation that would, in
turn, reduce potentially disparate state measures. With more regulatory
stability, market rewards for innovation would also be enhanced. Federal
climate preemption and unitary regulatory scheme arguments may make
sense in an idealized world of perfect, stable legal commitments, but in
a real world pervaded by regulatory failure, reversal risks, and
political instability, such unitary preemptive regimes would undercut
climate progress. The more federal climate regulation or future
legislation uses preemptive strategies, the more all hopes for climate
progress would rest on one imperfect and vulnerable federal vessel.
Retaining room for state and local climate regulation and linked clean
energy efforts hedges regulatory risks. Such overlapping and potentially
intertwined federal and state regulation may, somewhat paradoxically, be
the most effective way to ensure that a future federal climate law or
regulation under existing law will actually be implemented and endure
despite ongoing political and legal contestation. In the meantime,
during times of federal policy reversal or inertia, the enduring norm of
room for additional state regulation and innovation remains important.
States, alongside intermittent federal progress and policy support, have
been critical to climate and clean energy progress and in catalyzing
federal climate engagement. During a period of federal recoil, states
will again likely become the main vessel for climate momentum and in
rewarding clean energy innovation. Through that retained and ongoing
state authority, the pressure will build for federal reengagement.
Through the benefits of federalism hedging, climate progress may slow
but is unlikely to cease.

### 1ar Solves Warming

#### AFF solves---ccs is super effective and affordable

**Service 18** \[Robert F. Service is a writer for Science, "Cost
plunges for capturing carbon dioxide from the air," June 7, 2018,

[[Pulling carbon dioxide (CO2) from the air and using it to make
synthetic fuel seems like the ultimate solution to climate
change]{.underline}]{.mark}: Instead of adding ever more CO2 to the air
from fossil fuels, we can simply recycle the same CO2 molecules over and
over. But such technology is expensive---about \$600 per ton of CO2, by
one recent estimate. Now, in a new study, [scientists say future
chemical plants could [drop that cost below \$100 per
ton]{.mark}---which could [make synthetic fuels a reality in places such
as California that incentivize low-carbon fuels]{.mark}.]{.underline}

[[Those numbers are "real progress]{.underline}]{.mark}," says Chris
Field, a climate scientist at Stanford University in Palo Alto,
California. That's [because the new study bases its numbers on data and
costs from a real pilot facility, whereas others have relied on
scientists' best guesses of how CO2 capture technologies scale
up]{.underline}. "These guys actually have something you can measure,"
says Stephen Pacala, an ecologist with Princeton University who is
chairing a panel on carbon removal technologies for the National
Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine.

Until now, [the cost of climate change has been all about projections.
Climate scientists say countries will need to drop CO2 emissions to near
zero by midcentury and then remove more CO2 than they emit]{.underline},
if the planet is to avoid a catastrophic 2°C warming. [Numerous
so-called negative emissions technologies exist, including growing
perennial plants and trees to make biofuels, and sequestering carbon in
soils.]{.underline} One of the most compelling, known as [direct air
capture (DAC), uses giant banks of fans to blow air through a solution
that contains a CO2-capturing chemical]{.underline}. Once purified, the
captured CO2 can be injected underground or used to make commercial
products, such as fuels or plastics. But in 2011, a review panel of the
American Physical Society found that DAC would likely cost about \$600
per ton of captured CO2.

That didn't deter David Keith, a physicist at Harvard University who
co-founded a company focused on DAC. In 2015, Carbon Engineering
launched its first pilot plant for capturing CO2 in British Columbia in
Canada. After capturing the CO2 in solution, the plant transfers it into
a solid, which when heated releases it in a pure gas stream. [[The
crucial CO2-capturing chemical is recycled]{.underline}]{.mark}. After 3
years, Keith and his colleagues had collected enough data to calculate
the plant's efficiency---and project the costs of building a commercial
scale plant with the same technology. The results: Their technology can
capture CO2 for between \$94 and \$232 per ton, they report today in
Joule.

The company has also built a pilot operation to turn captured CO2 into a
variety of liquid fuels, including gasoline, diesel, and jet fuel. A
renewable energy--powered electrolyzer first splits water into hydrogen
(H2) and oxygen. The H2 is then combined with CO2 to make liquid
hydrocarbons using conventional chemical engineering technology. [If the
CO2 is captured at the low end of the cost range, the [company]{.mark}
says [can produce]{.mark} its [synthetic fuels for about \$1 per
liter]{.mark}]{.underline}, says Steve Oldham, Carbon Engineering's CEO.

That's more expensive than most fuels today, but not by much. [And
because the process recycles carbon from the air, it would constitute a
low-carbon fuel, something that places such as California are
increasingly requiring in their fuel mixes,]{.underline} and which
command a premium price. That could drive a market for DAC plants that
would likely drive costs down further, Oldham says. Still, Field
cautions that the technology isn't a silver bullet for combatting
climate change---there's no way yet to know whether it can scale up
quickly enough to alter CO2 levels in the atmosphere. "There is a long
way to go to see whether it will have any large-scale impact."

[It's not too late]{.underline}. In fact, it never will be. Whatever you
may have read over the past year --- as extreme weather brought a global
heat wave and unprecedented wildfires burned through 1.6 million
California acres and newspaper headlines declared, "Climate Change Is
Here" --- global warming is not binary. It is not a matter of "yes" or
"no," not a question of "fucked" or "not." Instead, it is a problem that
gets worse over time the longer we produce greenhouse gas, and can be
made better if we choose to stop. Which means that no matter how hot it
gets, no matter how fully climate change transforms the planet and the
way we live on it, it will always be the case that the next decade could
contain more warming, and more suffering, or less warming and less
suffering. Just how much is up to us, and always will be. A century and
a half after the greenhouse effect was first identified, and a few
decades since climate denial and misinformation began muddying our sense
of what scientists do know, we are left with a set of predictions that
can appear falsifiable --- about global temperatures and sea-level rise
and even hurricane frequency and wildfire volume. And there are, it is
true, [feedback loops in the climate system that we do not yet perfectly
understand and dynamic processes that remain mysterious. But to the
extent that we live today under clouds of uncertainty about the future
of climate change, those clouds are, overwhelmingly, not projections of
collective ignorance about the natural world but of blindness about the
human one, and they can be dispersed by human action]{.underline}. The
question of how bad things will get is not, actually, a test of the
science; it is a bet on human activity. How much will we do to forestall
disaster and how quickly?

[These are the disconcerting, contradictory lessons of global warming,
which counsels both human humility and human grandiosity, each drawn
from the same perception of peril.]{.underline} There's a name for those
who hold the fate of the world in their hands, as we do --- gods. But
for the moment, at least, [many of us seem inclined to run from that
responsibility rather than embrace it]{.underline}. Or even admit we see
it, though it sits in front of us as plainly as a steering wheel. That
climate change is all-enveloping means that it targets us all and that
we must all share in the responsibility so we do not all share in the
suffering --- at least not share in so suffocatingly much of it. Since I
first began writing about climate a few years ago, I've been asked often
whether I see any reason for optimism. The thing is, I am optimistic.
But optimism is always a matter of perspective, and mine is this: No one
wants to believe disaster is coming, but those who look, do. At about
two degrees Celsius of warming, just one degree north of where we are
today, some of the planet's ice sheets are expected to begin their
collapse, eventually bringing, over centuries, perhaps as much as 50
feet of sea-level rise. In the meantime, major cities in the equatorial
band of the planet will become unlivable. There will be, it has been
estimated, 32 times as many extreme heat waves in India, and even in the
northern latitudes, heat waves will kill thousands each summer. Given
only conventional methods of decarbonization (replacing dirty-energy
sources like coal and oil with clean ones like wind and solar), this is
probably our best-case scenario. It is also what is called --- so often
nowadays the phrase numbs the lips --- "catastrophic warming." A
representative from the Marshall Islands spoke for many of the world's
island nations when he used another word to describe the meaning of two
degrees: genocide. [You do not need to contemplate worst-case scenarios
to be alarmed; this best-case scenario is alarming enough]{.underline}.
Two degrees would be terrible, but it's better than three, at which
point Southern Europe would be in permanent drought, African droughts
would last five years on average, and the areas burned annually by
wildfires in the United States could quadruple, or worse, from last
year's million-plus acres. And three degrees is much better than four,
at which point six natural disasters could strike a single community
simultaneously; the number of climate refugees, already in the millions,
could grow tenfold, or 20-fold, or more; and, globally, damages from
warming could reach \$600 trillion --- about double all the wealth that
exists in the world today. We are on track for more warming still ---
just above four degrees by 2100, the U.N. estimates. So if optimism is
always a matter of perspective, the possibility of four degrees shapes
mine.

It is unlikely, I think, that we reach four degrees this century. But
this is what it would take to stay under two: a comprehensively
decarbonized economy, a perfectly renewable energy system, a reimagined
system of agriculture, perhaps even a planet without meat-eaters. We
also need overhauls of the world's transportation systems and
infrastructure. Every year the average American emits enough carbon to
melt 10,000 tons of ice in the Antarctic ice sheets --- enough to add
10,000 cubic meters of water to the ocean. Every minute, we each add
five gallons. If the task of reversing all that seems incomprehensibly
big, it is. [The scale of the technological transformation required
dwarfs every technological revolution ever engineered in human history,
including electricity and telecommunications and even the invention of
agriculture 10,000 years ago]{.underline}. By definition, it dwarfs
them, because it contains all of them --- every single sector needs to
be rebuilt from the foundation, since every single one breathes on
carbon like it's a ventilator. In October, the U.N.'s Intergovernmental
Panel on Climate Change warned that the world has only a dozen years to
halve its carbon emissions to safely avoid two degrees of warming and
all those "catastrophic" impacts. Is it possible? The short answer is,
technically speaking, maybe --- though just maybe. But speaking
practically, and politically, is another matter. Let's consider the
tools at hand. [First: a carbon tax]{.underline}. The very same day the
IPCC released its "Doomsday" report, the Nobel Prize in economics was
awarded to William Nordhaus, who pioneered the economic study of climate
change and is known today primarily for having championed the idea of
carbon pricing. The premise is simple: Legislate a high enough cost on
the stuff and the market will respond by producing less, then eventually
none, of it. It is also an appealing proposition to those who don't want
to see the economy truly upended; to those who trust that market forces
will deliver the outcomes they are predicted to; to those who believe
that the world would trust action on climate only if it came for free
or, better yet, with economic benefits; and [to those who believe that
action would otherwise involve, invariably, a trade-off --- that climate
action of any meaningful scale would be expensive, probably too
expensive for any growth-minded country to countenance.]{.underline}

Over the past several years, there has been a raft of papers showing
that the intuitive terms of that bargain are backward: Faster action on
climate will save or gain the world enormous amounts of money (\$26
trillion in potential growth by just 2030, according to one estimate;
those \$600 trillion in damages avoided by the end of the century,
according to another). But the labor involved in such a transformation
makes it seem burdensome anyway, and so the hope of the market solving
the problem on its own --- with the help of just a little
incentive-setting --- has prevailed, at least among a certain set. In
January, 45 economists described by Bloomberg as both "an all-star
lineup" and the world's "economic brain trust" united behind the cause
of a gradually increasing carbon tax, though they did not name their
starting price, which is a crucial variable. For his part, Nordhaus has
identified pricing for an "optimal" scenario: between \$35 and \$229 per
ton of CO2, a tax that, by his own estimate, could result in 3.5 degrees
Celsius of warming by 2100. That is 1.5 degrees warmer than that
island-nation "genocide." [A carbon tax is hypothetical for
Americans]{.underline}, which may be one reason they tend to be
optimistic about it. But there are already, today, many places with
existing carbon pricing --- South Korea, Japan, the E.U. None of their
emissions are declining fast enough to meet a goal of two degrees,
according to the carbon-watchdog site Climate Action Tracker. It is
conceivable, even probable, that at much higher levels of taxation, the
impact would be clearer. But as Jay Inslee, the governor of bright-green
Washington State, which tried and failed to enact such a tax in 2018,
recently put it, "To actually get carbon savings, you have to jack up
the price so high that it becomes politically untenable." [The longer we
wait, the steeper the declines will have to be]{.underline}. If the
world as a whole had begun decarbonization in the year 2000, when Al
Gore collected half a million more votes in the presidential election
than George W. Bush, emissions would have had to fall by 3 percent per
year to achieve climate stability at two degrees; if we begin now, we
will have to cut them by 10 percent each year; if we wait another
decade, the cuts will be enormous, 30 percent per year, to even hope for
warming levels below "genocide." Last year, Nordhaus's own nephew Ted
wrote in Foreign Affairs that the dream of keeping the world under two
degrees of warming, under any approach, was simply naïve. [The carbon
tax is the solution favored by business. On the left, another possible
approach has emerged: massive public investment and public
works]{.underline}, both directed toward replacing dirty energy sources
with clean ones and producing, along the way, an entirely renewable
economy. In other words, the Green New Deal.

The term may seem like a response to our very present tense of climate
panic, but it has bounced around for a while. It was used by Van Jones,
Obama's green-jobs adviser, in 2008 and formed the centerpiece of Jill
Stein's 2012 and 2016 campaigns, not that too many people took note.
This year, under that same banner, Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez has rallied
an astonishing level of political and policy energy around it --- Cory
Booker and Kamala Harris and Elizabeth Warren have already endorsed the
plan, and many of their fellow aspiring nominees will surely follow.
Their endorsements were for only a set of goals, as the proposal was
still being hammered into legislation when they attached their support.
The initial concept offered only one extremely ambitious goal ---
decarbonizing the American economy entirely by 2030 --- and a number of
other commitments that have excited many on the left whose political
priorities may not be so climate-focused. That is: to use the economic
stimulus of green-energy investment "to virtually eliminate poverty in
the United States and to make prosperity, wealth, and economic security
available to everyone participating in the transformation." [These
proposals are worthy, invigorating, and --- believe it or not ---
popular]{.underline}. I'm all for them. [Unfortunately]{.underline},
they are also, [on their own, not enough]{.underline}. As a strategy of
avoiding that same threshold of two degrees of warming, the investments
of a Green New Deal are what logicians call "necessary but
insufficient."

This is not a reflection of the modesty of the legislation, which is not
at all modest --- in fact, it is perhaps the most ambitious bill put
forward in congress in three quarters of a century. It is simply a
reflection of the scale of the challenge. In its report, the IPCC
compared the transformation required to stay safely below two degrees to
the mobilization of World War II. That mobilization was unprecedented in
human history and has never been matched since. That time, there was a
draft, a nationalization of industry, widespread rationing: The entire
American nation turned single-mindedly toward the relevant threat, as
did the entire Russian nation --- and the two of them, almost
inconceivably, in retrospect, allied. That is the kind of mobilization
the sober-minded scientists of the world believe is necessary today ---
to get to half of our current emissions by 2030. Is it possible? Well,
just about anything is possible, as the total mobilization of the nation
in World War II shows you. But it recently took New York City 45 years
to build three new stops on a single subway line. And if such a Green
New Deal transformation within the U.S. were possible, it would affect
only one country in the world, a country producing only 15 percent of
global emissions. This is the second reason the Green New Deal is, on
its own, insufficient. Last year, China was responsible for more than a
quarter of emissions --- and that figure does not account for any of the
massive infrastructure projects the country is undertaking across Asia
and Africa as part of its "Belt and Road" initiative to remake highways
and ports and airports throughout those continents. If the cement
industry were a country, it would be the world's third-largest emitter,
and China is now pouring more concrete in a span of three years than the
United States poured during the entire 20th century. Climate action does
not just take place within nations but between them. Here too the
hurdles are monumental. We have not yet really begun to consider the
ways in which climate change will shape and distort our global politics
--- bringing carbon budgets into the architecture of trade agreements
and peace treaties, reshaping rivalries between nations by literally
reshaping their geographies, introducing in the face of drowning nations
and uninhabitable cities in the poorest parts of the world the matter of
climate reparations and the question of just who will pay. But the way
our present politics is shaping our climate policy is already clear
enough. The Paris climate accords, signed nearly a decade after the
Great Recession, seemed to mark the end of the long era of technocratic,
neoliberal globalism. And yet, as a multilateral treaty negotiated on
the principle of positive-sum cooperation, it reflects those values in
almost every way. Distressingly, it also reflects the failures of those
values. Just two years in, no major industrial nation in the world but
India is on track to keep warming below two degrees.

In some places, government action is being lapped by market forces. In
America, for instance, coal production is projected to fall faster than
was predicted if Obama's Clean Power Plan were enacted (which it
wasn't). Over the past 25 years, the cost per unit of renewable energy
has fallen so far that you can hardly measure today's price using the
same scales (since just 2009, for instance, solar-energy costs have
fallen more than 80 percent). But over that same 25 years, the
proportion of global energy use derived from renewables has not grown at
all, which means that, billions of dollars and thousands of dramatic
breakthroughs later, the planet is in some ways no further in its
"green-energy revolution" than it was when hippies were affixing solar
panels to their geodesic domes. In fact, less far along, because the
market has not responded to these developments by retiring dirty-energy
sources and replacing them with clean ones. It has responded by simply
adding the new capacity to the same system. To the market, this is
growth; to human civilization, it is suicide. In 2003, Kan Caldeira of
the Carnegie Institution found that the world would need to add
clean-power sources equivalent to the full capacity of a nuclear plant
every single day between 2000 and 2050 to avoid catastrophic climate
change. In 2018, James Temple of MIT's Technology Review surveyed our
progress; he found that the world was on track to complete the necessary
energy revolution in 400 years. That gap yawns so wide it could swallow
whole civilizations, and indeed threatens to. Into it has crawled the
dreams of those extraordinary technological fixes: If we can't rebuild
the entire infrastructure of the modern world soon enough to save it
from self-destruction, perhaps we can at least buy ourselves some time
by artificially cooling off the planet or maybe sucking some of its
toxic fumes out of the air. If that seems too sci-fi for you, you are
not alone; in 2018, Nature dismissed all such scenarios as "magical
thinking." But if, today, you want to believe in climate hope --- want
to believe the planet can stay below two degrees of warming --- it means
believing in something more fanciful than decarbonization and clean
energy. No matter how quickly we take action, and no matter how
aggressively, the goal of a stable climate is functionally out of reach
by any conventional method. We can implement the most aggressive climate
policy yet conceived, doubling or even tripling the most ambitious
decarbonization proposals being put forward today by the world's
greenest leaders, and we will still need some "magic." Probably a whole
lot of it.

[The most promising variety of this magic is "negative emissions":
taking carbon out of the atmosphere]{.underline}. Once a last-ditch,
[if-all-else-fails strategy, negative emissions has recently been built
into nearly all climate-action goals.]{.underline} This is a chilling
fact, which almost nobody outside the climate world appreciates: Just
about every plausible scenario for avoiding catastrophic change is built
on these technologies, which we are only now beginning to test. [Of
400]{.underline} IPCC [emissions models that land us below two degrees
Celsius, 344 feature negative emissions, most of them
significantly.]{.underline} The ones that don't rely on negative
emissions all require such sharp and immediate emissions drops it is
hard to believe they could be produced by any policy on the table today.
On your chalkboard, you can draw whatever carbon-emissions curve you'd
like, but keeping the world safely under two degrees by conventional
decarbonization alone probably means policies like an immediate ban on
all new internal-combustion engines and much of the world's heavy
industry being suddenly shuttered or redirected by fiat. [What is more
of a fantasy --- that scenario or the "magical thinking" of negative
emissions? Because it promises a sort of global extension on the project
of decarbonization, that magical thinking has also been described as the
ultimate moral hazard. It is. But the math tells us negative emissions
is also a last, best, hope.]{.underline}

lever to remove CO2 from the air. The amount of CO2 that must be removed
ranges from negligible, [[if the emissions of CO2 from the energy system
and SLCPs start to decrease by 2020 and carbon neutrality is achieved by
2050, to a staggering one trillion tons if the carbon lever is not
pulled and emissions of climate pollutants continue to increase until
2030]{.mark}. There are numerous living laboratories including 53
cities, many universities around the world, the state of California, and
the nation of Sweden, who have embarked on a carbon neutral
pathway.]{.underline} These laboratories have already created 8 million
jobs in the clean energy industry; they have also shown that emissions
of greenhouse gases and air pollutants can be decoupled from economic
growth. Another favorable sign is that growth rates of worldwide carbon
emissions have reduced from 2.9% per year during the frst decade of this
century to 1.3% from 2011 to 2014 and near zero growth rates during the
last few years. The carbon emission curve is bending, but we have a long
way to go and very little time for achieving carbon neutrality. We need
institutions and enterprises that can accelerate this bending by
scaling-up the solutions that are being proven in the living
laboratories. We have less than a decade to put these solutions in place
around the world to preserve nature and our quality of life for
generations to come. The time is now.

The Paris Agreement is an historic achievement. For the first time,
effectively all nations have committed to limiting their greenhouse gas
emissions and taking other actions to limit global temperature change.
Specifically, 197 nations agreed to hold "the increase in the global
average temperature to well below 2°C above pre-industrial levels and
pursue efforts to limit the temperature increase to 1.5°C above
pre-industrial levels," and achieve carbon neutrality in the second half
of this century.

[The climate has already warmed by 1°C. The problem is running ahead of
us, and under current trends we will likely reach 1.5°C in the next
ffteen years and surpass the 2°C guardrail by mid-century with a 50%
probability of reaching 4°C by end of century. [Warming in excess of 3°C
is likely to be a global catastrophe for three major
reasons]{.mark}]{.underline}[:]{.mark}

• [Warming]{.underline} in the range of 3°C to 5°C [is suggested as the
threshold for [several tipping points in the physical and geochemical
systems]{.mark}]{.underline}; a warming of about 3°C has a probability
of over 40% to cross over multiple tipping points, while a warming close
to 5°C increases it to nearly 90%, compared with a baseline warming of
less than 1.5°C, which has only just over a 10% probability of exceeding
any tipping point.

• [[Health effects]{.mark} of such warming are emerging as a major if
not dominant source of concern. Warming of 4°C or more will expose more
than 70% of the population]{.underline}, i.e. about 7 billion by the end
of the century, to deadly heat stress and expose about 2.4 billion to
vector borne diseases such as Dengue, Chikengunya, and Zika virus among
others.

• [Ecologists and paleontologists have proposed that warming in excess
of 3°C, [accompanied by increased acidity of the oceans]{.mark} by the
buildup of CO2 , can become a major causal factor for exposing more than
50% of all species to extinction]{.underline}. 20% of species are in
danger of extinction now due to population, habitat destruction, and
climate change.

The good news is that [there may [still be time to avert such
catastrophic changes]{.mark}. The Paris Agreement and supporting climate
policies must be strengthened]{.underline} substantially within the next
fve years to bend the emissions curve down faster, stabilize climate,
and prevent catastrophic warming. [To the extent those efforts fall
short, societies and ecosystems will be forced to contend with
substantial needs for adaptation---a burden that will fall
disproportionately on the poorest three billion who are least
responsible for causing the climate change problem.]{.underline}

## Globalization good/AT: Trade Bad

#### Intl' trade is the main driver of the economy.

economic development, the public sector, education, and a wide range of
related topics. Esteban completed his DPhil in Economics at the
University of Oxford. October 2018, \"Trade and Globalization,\" Our
World in Data, https://ourworldindata.org/trade-and-globalization)

[The integration of national economies into a global economic system has
been one of the most important developments of the last
century]{.underline}. This process of integration, often called
[[Globalization, has materialized in a remarkable growth in trade
between countries]{.mark}.]{.underline}

The following chart shows the value of world exports over the period
1800-2014. These estimates are in constant prices (i.e. have been
adjusted to account for inflation) and are indexed at 1913 values.

This chart shows an [ex[traordinary growth in international trade over
the last couple of centuries: Exports today are more than 40 times
larger than in 1913.]{.mark}]{.underline}

You can click on the option marked \'Linear\', on top of the vertical
axis, to change into a logarithmic scale. This will help you see that,
over the long run, growth has roughly followed an exponential path.

[The value of global
exports](https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/world-trade-exports-constant-prices?time=1800..2014)

Time series of value of world exports at constant prices, relative to
1913 (i.e. values correspond to world export volumes\
indexed at 1913=100) 

Trade has grown more than proportionately with GDP

The chart above shows how much more trade we have today relative to a
century ago. But what about trade relative to total economic output?

[Over the last couple of centuries **the world economy has
experienced [sustained positive economic
growth](https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/world-gdp-over-the-last-two-millennia),**]{.underline}
so looking at changes in trade relative to GDP offers another
interesting perspective.

The next chart plots the value of trade in goods relative to GDP (i.e.
the value of merchandise trade as a share of global economic output).

Up to 1870, the sum of worldwide exports accounted for less than 10% of
global output. Today, the value of exported goods around the world is
close to 25%. This shows that over the last hundred years of economic
growth, there has been more than proportional growth in global trade.

Today trade is a fundamental part of economic activity everywhere

[In today\'s global economic system, countries exchange not only final
products, but also intermediate inputs. This [creates an intricate
network of economic interactions that cover the whole
world.]{.mark}]{.underline}

The following interactive data visualization, created by
the [London-based data visualisation studio
Kiln](https://www.kiln.digital/) and the [UCL Energy
Institute](http://www.bartlett.ucl.ac.uk/energy), gives us an insight
into the complex nature of trade. It plots the position of cargo ships
across the oceans.

Trade generates efficiency gains

If we look at country-level data from the last half century we find that
there is a correlation between [economic
growth](https://ourworldindata.org/entries/economic-growth) and trade:
countries with higher rates of GDP growth also tend to have higher rates
of growth in trade as a share of output.

This basic correlation is shown in the chart below, where we plot
average annual change in real GDP per capita, against growth in trade
(average annual change in value of exports as a share of
GDP).[^1^](https://ourworldindata.org/trade-and-globalization#note-1)

Is this just a correlation or is increasing trade *causing* higher
economic growth?

[Among the potential growth-enhancing factors that come from greater
global economic integration are: Competition (firms that fail to adopt
new technologies and cut costs are more likely to fail and to be
replaced by more dynamic firms); Economies of scale (firms that can
export to the world face larger demand, and under the right conditions,
they can operate at larger scales where the price per unit of product is
lower); Learning and innovation (firms that trade gain more experience
and exposure to develop and adopt technologies and industry standards
from foreign
competitors).[2](https://ourworldindata.org/trade-and-globalization#note-2)]{.underline}

Are these mechanisms supported by the data?

The [empirical literature suggests that indeed increased trade causes
higher economic growth.]{.underline}

Some of the [most cited papers in this field]{.underline} (e.g. [Frankel
& Romer

rely on long-run macroeconomic data and find evidence of a causal
relationship: **trade is one of the factors driving economic
growth.[3](https://ourworldindata.org/trade-and-globalization#note-3)**]{.underline}

Other important papers in this field have focused on microeconomic
evidence, exploring the causal impact of specific trade liberalization
policies on firm-level productivity within countries. These studies also
find [[that trade liberalization has led to growth in the productivity
of
firms]{.mark}.[4](https://ourworldindata.org/trade-and-globalization#note-4)]{.underline}

https://www.mercatus.org/publication/benefits-free-trade-addressing-key-myths)

[[Free trade increases prosperity for]{.mark} Americans---and the
[citizens of all participating nations]{.mark}---by allowing consumers
to buy more, better-quality products at lower costs. It dri[ves economic
growth,]{.mark} enhanced efficiency, increased innovation, and the
greater fairness that accompanies a rules-based system. These benefits
increase as overall trade---exports and
imports---increases.]{.underline}

Free trade increases access to higher-quality, lower-priced goods[.
[Cheaper imports]{.mark}]{.underline}, particularly from countries such
as China and Mexico, [[have eased inflationary pressure]{.mark} in the
United States. Prices are held down by more than 2 percent for every 1
percent share in the market]{.underline} by imports from low-income
countries like China, which leaves more income for Americans to spend on
other products.

[Free trade means more growth. At least half of US imports are not
consumer goods; they are inputs for US-based producers, according to
economists from the Bureau of Economic Analysis. Freeing trade reduces
imported-input costs, thus reducing businesses' production costs and
promoting economic growth.]{.underline}

[[Free trade improves efficiency and innovation]{.mark}.]{.underline}
Over time, free trade works with other market processes to shift workers
and resources to more productive uses, allowing more efficient
industries to thrive[. The results are higher wages, investment in such
things as infrastructure, and a more dynamic economy that continues to
create new jobs and opportunities]{.underline}.

[Free trade [drives competitiveness]{.mark}]{.underline}. Free trade
does require American businesses and workers to adapt to the shifting
demands of the worldwide marketplace. But these adjustments are critical
to remaining competitive, and [competition is what [fuels long-term
growth]{.mark}.]{.underline}

[Free trade [promotes fairness]{.mark}]{.underline}. When everyone
follows the same rules-based system, there is less opportunity for
cronyism, or the ability of participating nations to skew trade
advantages toward favored parties[. [In the absence]{.mark} of such a
system, big[ger]{.mark} and better-connected in[dustries]{.mark} can
more [easily acquire unfair advantages]{.mark}, [such as tax and
regulatory loopholes]{.mark}, which [shield them from
competition.]{.mark}]{.underline}

#### Global trade key for resource efficiency.

**Heakal 5/16** (Reem Heakal Became an Investopedia contributor in 2003
and Earned a Masters of Art in Political Science and International
Relations. 5-16-2019, \"What Is International Trade?,\" Investopedia,
<https://www.investopedia.com/insights/what-is-international-trade/>)

[Global trade allows wealthy countries to use their resources---whether
labor, technology
or [capital](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/capital.asp#axzz1n1rLWewe)---
more efficiently. Because countries are endowed with different assets
and natural resources (land, labor, capital, and technology), some
countries may produce the same good more efficiently and therefore sell
it more cheaply than other countries. If a country cannot efficiently
produce an item, it can obtain the item by trading with another country
that can. This is known
as [specialization](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/specialization.asp#axzz1n1rLWewe) in
international trade.]{.underline}

Let\'s take a simple example. Country A and Country B both produce
cotton sweaters and wine. Country A produces ten sweaters and six
bottles of wine a year while Country B produces six sweaters and ten
bottles of wine a year. Both can produce a total of 16 units. Country A,
however, takes three hours to produce the ten sweaters and two hours to
produce the six bottles of wine (total of five hours). Country B, on the
other hand, takes one hour to produce ten sweaters and three hours to
produce six bottles of wine (a total of four hours).

But these two countries realize that they could produce more by focusing
on those products with which they have a [comparative
advantage](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/comparativeadvantage.asp).
Country A then begins to produce only wine, and Country B produces only
cotton sweaters. Each country can now create a specialized output of 20
units per year and trade equal proportions of both products. As such,
each country now has access to 20 units of both products.

We can see then that for both countries, the [opportunity
cost](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/o/opportunitycost.asp) of
producing both products is greater than the cost of specializing. More
specifically, for each country, the opportunity cost of producing 16
units of both sweaters and wine is 20 units of both products (after
trading). [Specialization reduces their opportunity cost and therefore
maximizes their efficiency in acquiring the goods they need. With the
greater supply, the price of each product would decrease, thus giving an
advantage to the end consumer as well.]{.underline}

Note that, in the example above, Country B could produce both wine and
cotton more efficiently than Country A (less time). This is called an
absolute advantage, and Country B may have it because of a higher level
of technology. However, according to the international trade theory,
even if a country has an absolute advantage over another, it can still
benefit from specialization.

The law of comparative advantage is popularly attributed to English
political economist [David
Ricardo](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/david-ricardo.asp) and his
book "On the Principles of Political Economy and Taxation" in 1817,
although it is likely that Ricardo\'s mentor James Mill originated the
analysis.

David Ricardo famously showed how England and Portugal both benefit by
specializing and trading according to their comparative advantages. In
this case, Portugal was able to make wine at a low cost, while England
was able to cheaply manufacture cloth. Ricardo predicted that each
country would eventually recognize these facts and stop attempting to
make the product that was more costly to generate.

Indeed, as time went on, England stopped producing wine, and Portugal
stopped manufacturing cloth. Both countries saw that it was to their
advantage to stop their efforts at producing these items at home and,
instead, to trade with each other in order to acquire them.

A contemporary example: China's comparative advantage with the United
States is in the form of cheap labor. Chinese workers produce simple
consumer goods at a much lower opportunity cost. The United States'
comparative advantage is in specialized, capital-intensive labor.
American workers produce sophisticated goods or investment opportunities
at lower opportunity costs. Specializing and trading along these lines
benefit each.

[The theory of comparative advantage helps to explain why protectionism
is typically unsuccessful. Adherents to this analytical approach believe
that countries engaged in international trade will have already worked
toward finding partners with comparative advantages.]{.underline}

[If a country removes itself from an international trade agreement, if a
government imposes tariffs, and so on, it may produce a local benefit in
the form of new jobs and industry. However, this is not a long-term
solution to a trade problem. Eventually, that country will be at a
disadvantage relative to its neighbors: countries that were already
better able to produce these items at a lower opportunity
cost.]{.underline}

#### Globalization key to econ growth.

The [economic gains from globalization are immense]{.underline}. In the
United States, according to estimates from the Peter G. Peterson
Institute for International Economics and others, trade and investment
liberalization over the past decades has added between \$5oo billion and
\$1 trillion in annual income-between \$1,65o and \$3,3oo a year for
every American. A [Doha agreement on global free trade]{.underline} in
goods and services would [generate]{.underline}, according to similar
studies, [\$5oo billion a year in additional income]{.underline} in the
United States. [International trade and investment have spurred
productivity growth]{.underline}, the foundation of [rising average
living standards]{.underline}. The rate of increase in output per worker
hour in the U.S. nonfarm business sector has doubled in the past decade,
from an annual average of 1.35 percent between 1973 and 1995 to an
annual average of 2.7 percent since 1995. Much of the initial
acceleration was related to information technology (I)-one of the United
States\' most globally engaged industries, at the forefront of
establishing and expanding production networks linked by trade and
investment around the globe. Gains from globalization have been
similarly large in the rest of the world. [China and India have achieved
stupendous rates of productivity growth, lifting hundreds of millions of
people out of poverty]{.underline}. Central to this [success has been
the introduction of market forces, in particular international market
forces]{.underline} related to trade and FDI. In Chinese manufacturing,
foreign multinational companies account for over half of all exports.
And in the Indian IT sector, Indian and foreign multinational firms
account for two-thirds of sales. Freer trade and investment can also
enhance other foreign policy goals. The Doha Round was launched shortly
after 9/11 because of the view that global poverty is intimately linked
to international insecurity and instability. The Doha Round was also
intended to remedy the widespread perception that previous rounds of
trade negotiations had treated poor nations unfairly by failing to open
the very sectors\--such as agriculturewhose openness would most likely
help the world\'s poor. Accordingly, it is believed that a successful
Doha agreement would enhance the United States\' image and promote its
interests around the world.

In the following decades, [international trade and finance blossomed.
Economic growth took off]{.underline} and by the 1950s both Europe and
the US were expanding at important rates. Across [the developing
world]{.underline}, efforts in those decades were also put in
[maximizing growth rates]{.underline}, focusing on stimulating the
industrial sector and aiming at increasing productivity as a route to
achieve higher levels of economic development.6 [Increased demand
created the need for broader markets]{.underline}, opening the path for
liberalization of trade, soon followed by the liberalization of payments
facilities, at the end of the 1950s, and the loosening of capital
controls beginning in the early 1960s. [Financial deregulation allowed
both productive and financial capital to move increasingly more freely,
propelling exchanges in both markets]{.underline}. At the same time,
[advancements in science and technology enabled great improvements in
health, as well as in transportation, energy and
connectivity,]{.underline} among others. [Technological progress boosted
financial integration]{.underline}; at the same time, while [automation
invaded factories]{.underline} across the industrial sector, there were
productivity gains on average but lower skilled workers were affected by
the replacement of their jobs with machines. As [financial
liberalization]{.underline} surpassed trade liberalization in speed and
depth in the 1980s, increasing global financial integration, together
[with rising capital mobility]{.underline}, [bound countries into a
disinflationary constraint]{.underline}.7 Capital mobility meant that
financial agents could realize gains from differences in value of assets
arising from relative prices, such as interest rates and foreign
exchange rates, through arbitrage. [Increased financial integration led
to]{.underline} a [loss in]{.underline} degrees of freedom by [monetary
authorities in setting interest rates]{.underline} aiming at taming
inflation or boosting economic activity, as interest rate differentials
with other economies could generate severe pressure on the foreign
exchange market. [Increasing inflationary pressures]{.underline} in the
late 1960s, and especially after the oil crises of the seventies,
[seriously jeopardized the post-war model of labour
relations]{.underline} in most developed countries. Collective
bargaining aiming at wage increases in line with productivity growth
became increasingly economically unsustainable[. In an effort to contain
inflation, governments sought to shift bargaining towards more
decentralized models]{.underline}. These changes in the bargaining
process were further accentuated by the changes in the production
process fostered by globalization and technological advancement, which
led firms to [increase managerial initiatives promoting organizational
flexibility at global scale.]{.underline} Several episodes of high
inflation in the 70s, 80s and early 90s have shown the economic and
social cost of creeping prices. The International Monetary Fund, as the
provider of international liquidity and the guarantor of stability of
the international financial system, sought to stabilize those countries
undergoing debt or balance of payments crises by providing liquidity
conditional to policy programmes, often entailing tough fiscal
consolidation with deflationary effects, in what has come to be known as
the Washington Consensus. In effect, this consensus gradually
institutionalized widespread rejection of inflation. While inflation
caused real losses and misery, the structural programmes implemented
after hyperinflation episodes, debt or balance of payments crises in the
70s, 80s and 90s also caused immense hardship. Nevertheless, the
consensus around low inflation rates got progressively entrenched, and
countries and institutions in the Western world became sensitive to the
point of only accepting inflation rates around 2-3%. This compounds on
the disinflationary constraint, which highly restricts the instruments
for domestic stabilization available to policymakers, including their
ability to expand the economy. Given that the disinflationary constraint
is not created by a particular economic crisis but rather is due to
capital mobility, which is a structural feature of the system, this
meant that, in fact, it was a permanent constraint faced by
policymakers. The tendency to disembed the economic and financial
markets had been reinforced, as all other economic and social policy
objectives became subordinate to the principle and requirements of sound
finance. Indeed, policymakers are often forced to apply fiscal and
monetary austerity even if doing so causes hardship.9 [The 2008-2009
economic and financial crisis]{.underline} that originated in the
sub-prime mortgage market in the United States thus came as consequence
of an unlevelled playing field and mounting forces that had been
developing in the previous decades and, at the same time, further
exacerbated these same tendencies. Although it caused economic and
social hardship and some reforms were pursued,10 the crisis [did not
generate sufficient political will]{.underline} and momentum [to change
the status quo]{.underline} of economic and financial markets and
"embed" them back in social and political relations, or reflect in them
the principles and values of societies they operate in. Instead, [the
trend of disembedment has been reinforced.]{.underline}

AVERTING A protectionist backlash is in the economic and security
interests of the United States. Globalization has generated-and can
continue to generate-substantial benefits for the United States and the
rest of the world. But realizing those broad benefits will require
addressing the legitimate concerns of U. S. voters by instituting a New
Deal for globalization. In many ways, today\'s protectionist drift is
similar to the challenges faced by the architect of the original New
Deal. In August 1934, President Franklin Roosevelt declared: Those who
would measure confidence in this country in the future must look first
to the average citizen. \... This Government intends no injury to honest
business. The processes we follow in seeking social justice do not, in
adding to general prosperity, take from one and give to another. In this
modern world, the spreading out of opportunity ought not to consist of
robbing Peter to pay Paul. In other words, we are concerned with more
than mere subtraction and addition. We are concerned with multiplication
also-multiplication of wealth through cooperative action, wealth in
which all can share. Today, such [multiplication will depend on striking
a delicate balance between allowing globally engaged companies to
continue to generate large overall gains]{.underline} for the United
States [and]{.underline} using well-targeted fiscal mechanisms [to
spread the gains more widely]{.underline}. Would addressing concerns
about income distribution make voters more likely to support open
borders? The public-opinion data suggest that the answer is yes.
Americans consistently say that they would be more inclined to back
trade and investment liberalization if it were linked to more support
for those hurt in the process. The policy experience of other countries
confirms this point: [there is greater support for engagement with the
world economy in countries that spend more on programs for dislocated
workers.]{.underline} U.S. policymakers face a clear choice. They can
lead the nation down the dangerous path of creeping protectionism. Or
they can build a stable foundation for U.S. engagement with the world
economy by sharing the gains widely. A New Deal for globalization can
ensure that globalization survives.

#### Case outweighs---extinction is a unique moral category

**Bostrom, 12** \[Nick, directs Oxford\'s Future of Humanity Institute,
Interview in The Atlantic with Ross Andersen, We\'re Underestimating the
Risk of Human Extinction,
http://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2012/03/were-underestimating-the-risk-of-human-extinction/253821/\]
/Bingham

[Unthinkable as it may be, humanity, every last person, could someday be
wiped from the face of the Earth.]{.underline} We have learned to worry
about asteroids and supervolcanoes, but the more-likely scenario,
according to Nick Bostrom, a professor of philosophy at Oxford, is that
[we humans will destroy ourselves]{.underline}.Bostrom, who directs
Oxford\'s Future of Humanity Institute, has argued over the course of
several papers that [[human extinction risks are poorly understood and,
worse still, severely underestimated by society]{.underline}]{.mark}.
[Some of these existential risks are fairly well known, especially the
natural ones. But others are obscure or even exotic. Most worrying to
Bostrom is the subset of existential risks that arise from human
technology, a subset that he expects to grow in number and potency over
the next century]{.underline}. Despite his concerns about the risks
posed to humans by technological progress, Bostrom is no luddite. In
fact, he is a longtime advocate of transhumanism\-\--the effort to
improve the human condition, and even human nature itself, through
technological means. In the long run he sees technology as a bridge, a
bridge we humans must cross with great care, in order to reach new and
better modes of being. In his work, Bostrom uses the tools of philosophy
and mathematics, in particular probability theory, to try and determine
how we as a species might achieve this safe passage. What follows is my
conversation with Bostrom about some of the most interesting and
worrying existential risks that humanity might encounter in the decades
and centuries to come, and about what we can do to make sure we outlast
them[. Some have argued that we ought to be directing our resources
toward humanity\'s existing problems, rather than future existential
risks, because many of the latter are highly improbable. You have
responded by suggesting that existential risk mitigation may in fact be
a dominant moral priority over the alleviation of present
suffering]{.underline}. Can you explain why? Bostrom: [Well suppose you
have a moral view that counts future people as being worth as much as
present people. You might say that fundamentally it doesn\'t matter
whether someone exists at the current time or at some future time, just
as many people think that from a fundamental moral point of view, it
doesn\'t matter where somebody is spatially\-\--somebody isn\'t
automatically worth less]{.underline} because you move them to the moon
or to Africa or something. [[A human life is a human life]{.mark}. If
you have that moral point of view that future generations matter in
proportion to their population numbers, then you get this very stark
implication that existential risk mitigation has a much higher utility
than pretty much anything else that you could do. [There are so many
people that could come into existence in the future if humanity survives
this critical period of time]{.mark}]{.underline}\-\--we might live for
billions of years, our descendants might colonize billions of solar
systems, and there could be billions and billions times more people than
exist currently. Therefore, even a very small reduction in the
probability of realizing this enormous good will tend to outweigh even
immense benefits like eliminating poverty or curing malaria, which would
be tremendous under ordinary standards.

\"Apocalypse Not: The Oscars, The Media And The Myth Of 'Constant
Repetition Of Doomsday Messages' On Climate,\" No Publication,
<https://thinkprogress.org/apocalypse-not-the-oscars-the-media-and-the-myth-of-constant-repetition-of-doomsday-messages-on-11e97ff98006/>)

The two greatest myths about global warming communications are 1)
constant repetition of doomsday messages has been a major, ongoing
strategy and 2) that strategy doesn't work and indeed is actually
counterproductive! These myths are so deeply ingrained in the
environmental and progressive political community that when we finally
had a serious shot at a climate bill, the powers that be --- [led by
team
Obama!](http://thinkprogress.org/climate/2012/11/05/1140531/the-sounds-of-silence-team-obama-launched-the-inane-strategy-of-downplaying-climate-change-back-in-march-2009/) --- decided **not** to
focus on the threat posed by climate change in any serious fashion in
their \$200 million communications effort (see "[Can you solve global
warming without talking about global
warming?](http://thinkprogress.org/romm/2010/06/17/206256/global-warming-message-polling-ezra-klei/)").

These myths are so deeply ingrained in the mainstream media that such
messaging, when it is tried, is routinely attacked and denounced --- and
the flimsiest studies are interpreted exactly backwards to drive the
erroneous message home (see "[Dire straits: Media blows the story of UC
Berkeley study on climate
messaging](http://thinkprogress.org/romm/2010/11/22/207074/berkeley-study-dire-gloom-and-doom-climate-messaging-media/)")[The
only time anything approximating this kind of messaging --- not
"doomsday" but what I'd call blunt, science-based messaging that also
makes clear the problem is solvable --- was in 2006 and 2007 with [the
release of An Inconvenient Truth]{.mark} (and the 4 assessment reports
of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change and media coverage like
the April 2006 cover of Time).]{.underline} The data suggest **that
strategy measurably [[moved the public to become more concerned
about]{.mark} the threat posed by [global
warming]{.mark}]{.underline}**[ (see [major study
here](http://thinkprogress.org/romm/2012/02/06/419371/study-debunks-al-gore-polarized-the-debate-myths-of-public-opinion-climate-change/)]{.underline}).You'd
think it would be pretty obvious that the public is not going to be
concerned about an issue unless one explains why they should be
concerned about an issue. And the social science literature, including
the vast literature on advertising and marketing, could not be clearer
that only repeated messages have any chance of sinking in and moving the
needle, as I discuss in my book "[Language Intelligence: Lessons on
Persuasion from Jesus, Shakespeare, Lincoln, and Lady
Gaga](http://www.amazon.com/Language-Intelligence-Lessons-persuasion-Shakespeare/dp/1477452222)."
One of the most popular quotes in the book is from GOP wordmeister Frank
Luntz:

[There's a simple
rule: ](http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/shows/persuaders/interviews/luntz.html)You
say it again, and you say it again, and you say it again, and you say it
again, and you say it again, and then again and again and again and
again, and about the time that you're absolutely sick of saying it is
about the time that your target audience has heard it for the first
time.

Because I doubt any serious movement of public opinion or mobilization
of political action could possibly occur until these myths are
shattered, I've been posting on the best work on climate messaging and
public opinion analysis (see "[Must-Read: A Guide For Engaging and
Winning on Climate And Clean
Energy](http://thinkprogress.org/climate/2012/09/19/837281/must-read-a-guide-for-engaging-and-winning-on-climate-and-clean-energy/)"
and [Krosnick: Candidates "May Actually Enhance Turnout As Well As

Since this is Oscar night, though, it seems appropriate to [update my
post](http://thinkprogress.org/climate/2012/02/26/432546/apocalypse-not-oscars-media-myth-of-repetition-of-doomsday-messages-on-climate/) on
what messages the public are exposed to in popular culture and the
media. It ain't doomsday. Quite the reverse, [[climate change has been
mostly an invisible issue for several years and the message of
conspicuous consumption and business-as-usual reigns
supreme]{.underline}]{.mark}. The original motivation for this post
actually came up two years ago because I received an e-mail from a
journalist commenting that the "constant repetition of doomsday
messages" doesn't work as a messaging strategy. I had to demur, for the
reasons noted above.

But it did get me thinking about what messages the public are exposed
to, especially as I've been rushing to see the movies nominated for Best
Picture this year, many of which, fortunately, are available On Demand.
That said, good luck finding a popular movie in recent years that even
touches on climate change, let alone one a popular one that would pass
for doomsday messaging. Two years ago, Best Picture nominee The Tree of
Life was been billed as an environmental movie --- and even shown at
environmental film festivals --- but while it is certainly depressing,
climate-related it ain't. In fact, if that is truly someone's idea of
environmental movie, count me out. Last year Beasts of the Southern
Wild is an environmentally-themed movie that has won its share of awards
and is nominated for Best Picture. It was [seemingly
related](http://newswatch.nationalgeographic.com/2012/07/17/the-story-behind-beasts-of-the-southern-wild/) to
climate change. But it hardly counts as a popular movie, scoring a
whopping [\$12 million in domestic
gross](http://boxofficemojo.com/movies/?id=beastsofthesouthernwild.htm) to
date, which means it was seen by somewhere north of one million
Americans. The closest to a genuine popular climate movie was the
dreadfully unscientific The Day After Tomorrow, which is from 2004 (and
arguably set back the messaging effort by putting the absurd "global
cooling" notion in people's heads!) Even Avatar, the most successful
movie of all time --- \$2.7 billion global gross --- and "the most epic
piece of environmental advocacy ever captured on celluloid," as [one
producer put
it](http://thinkprogress.org/romm/2010/03/07/205275/avatar-environmental-best-picture-post-apocalypse-now-eco-pic/),
omits the climate doomsday message. One of my favorite eco-movies,
"[Wall-E, is an eco-dystopian gem and an anti-consumption
movie](http://thinkprogress.org/romm/2008/07/15/202869/wall-e-is-an-eco-dystopian-gem-an-anti-consumption-movie-from-disney/),"
but it isn't a climate movie. I had [some
hopes](http://thinkprogress.org/climate/2012/03/18/446723/the-hunger-games-post-apocalypse-now-for-young-adults/) for The
Hunger Games movie. I'd read all 3 of the bestselling young adult
novels --- hey, that's my job! --- and while post-apocalyptic, they
don't qualify as climate change doomsday messaging. Indeed, the first
book, at least, strongly suggests that the suppressed revolution that
led to the creation of the annual slaughter-fest known as "the hunger
games" was preceded by a climate-driven apocalypse. But, as [I
discussed](http://thinkprogress.org/climate/2012/04/01/455593/hunger-game-fans-care-climate-change-the-movie/) back
in 2012, any connection to global warming was excised from the first
movie. So, no, the movies certainly don't expose the public to constant
doomsday messages on climate. **Here are the key points about what
repeated messages the American public is exposed to**:

The broad American public is exposed to virtually no doomsday messages,
let alone constant ones, on climate change in popular culture (TV and
the movies and even online). There is not (yet) one single TV show on
any network devoted to this subject, which is, arguably, more
consequential than any other preventable issue we face. The same goes
for the news media, whose coverage of climate change has collapsed (see
"[Silence of the Lambs 2: Media Herd's Coverage of Climate Change Drops
Sharply --- Again](http://thinkprogress.org/climate/2012/01/03/396546/silence-of-the-lambs-media-herd-coverage-climate-change-drops-again/)").
When the media do cover climate change in recent years, the overwhelming
majority of coverage is devoid of any doomsday messages --- and many
outlets still feature hard-core deniers. Just imagine what the public's
view of climate would be if it got the same coverage as, say,
unemployment, the housing crisis or even the deficit? When was the last
time you saw an "employment denier" quoted on TV or in a newspaper?

The public is exposed to constant messages promoting business as usual
and indeed idolizing conspicuous consumption. See, for instance,
"[Breaking: The earth is breaking ... but how about that Royal
Wedding?](http://thinkprogress.org/romm/2011/05/03/208010/royal-wedding/)
Our political elite and intelligentsia, including MSM pundits and the
supposedly "liberal media" like, say, MSNBC, hardly even talk about
climate change and when they do, it isn't doomsday. Indeed, there isn't
even a single national columnist for a major media outlet who writes
primarily on climate. Most "liberal" columnists rarely mention it (Tom
Friedman being the main exception).

[[At least a quarter of the public chooses media that devote a vast
amount of time to the notion that global warming is a hoax and that
environmentalists are extremists and that clean energy is a
joke]{.underline}]{.mark}. In the MSM, conservative pundits routinely
trash climate science and mock clean energy. Just listen to, say, Joe
Scarborough on MSNBC's Morning Joe mock clean energy or CNBC anchor Joe
Kernen [dismiss](http://thinkprogress.org/media/2013/07/05/2260381/cnbc-climate-change/)climate
science.

The major energy companies bombard the airwaves with millions and
millions of dollars of repetitious pro-fossil-fuel ads. The
environmentalists spend far, far less money. As noted above, the one
time they did run a major campaign to push a climate bill, they and
their political allies including the president explicitly did NOT talk
much about climate change, particularly doomsday messaging.
Environmentalists when they do appear in popular culture, especially TV,
are routinely mocked. [[There is very little mass communication of
doomsday messages online]{.underline}]{.mark}. Check out the most
popular websites. General silence on the subject, and again, what
coverage there is ain't doomsday messaging. Go to the front page of the
(moderately trafficked) environmental websites. Where is the doomsday?

If you want to find anything approximating even modest, blunt,
science-based messaging built around the scientific literature,
interviews with actual climate scientists and a clear statement that we
can solve this problem --- well, you've all found it, of course, but the
only people who see it are those who go looking for it. Of course, this
blog is not even aimed at the general public. Probably 99% of Americans
haven't even seen one of my headlines and 99.5% haven't read one of my
climate science posts. And Climate Progress is probably the most widely
read, quoted, reposted, [liked and
retweeted](http://thinkprogress.org/climate/2013/01/07/1402921/deniers-finally-discover-twitter-social-media-where-climate-hawks-soar/),
climate science blog in the world.

Anyone dropping into America from another country or another planet who
started following popular culture and the news the way the overwhelming
majority of Americans do would --- at least until Superstorm
Sandy --- have gotten the distinct impression that nobody who matters is
terribly worried about climate change. And, of course, they'd be
right --- see "[The failed presidency of Barack Obama, Part
2](http://thinkprogress.org/romm/2010/11/04/206982/the-failed-presidency-of-barack-obama-2/)."
It is total BS that somehow the American public has been scared and
overwhelmed by repeated doomsday messaging into some sort of climate
fatigue. The public's concern did seem to drop several percent --- but
that is primarily due to the conservative media's disinformation
campaign impact on [Tea Party
conservatives](http://thinkprogress.org/romm/2011/12/02/380400/koch-denial-backfires-independents-other-republicans-split-with-tea-party-on-global-warming/) and
to the treatment of this as a nonissue by most of the rest of the media,
intelligentsia and popular culture. Ironically [[it took the
post-apocalyptic horror of an actual warming-fueled superstorm to bring
home the message that global warming is here and
now]{.underline}]{.mark}. What's amazing to me is not the public's
supposed lack of concerned about global warming --- another
myth, [debunked
here](http://thinkprogress.org/romm/2011/11/15/360335/experts-debunk-polls-americans-believe-in-global-warming/) --- but
that the public is as knowledgable and concerned as it is given the
realities discussed above! The stunning increase in extreme weather
events --- 25 disasters exceeding a billion dollars in 2011 and
2012 --- which had long been predicted by climate scientists, has not
gone unnoticed by the public: [Poll (2/12): Americans' Understanding of

So the question now is whether the media, politicians, and popular
culture will finally catch up to where the public is.

pursued]{.mark} liberal internationalist foreign policy agendas [more
extensively, and successfully]{.mark}, than any other major
state]{.underline}** in the modern state system, **[and [the
world]{.mark}]{.underline}**, I think, **[[has been]{.mark} made [better
off]{.mark}]{.underline}** in very important ways by these efforts. The
net impact of the United States and of American grand strategy and
particularly those parts of American brand strategy that have been more
liberal internationalist in their character, has been enormously
positive for the world. **[[It has]{.mark} produced not a
utopia]{.underline}** by any means, **[but has [brought]{.mark} about an
era with more [peace]{.mark} and [security, prosperity, and
freedom]{.mark} for more people than ever before in
history.]{.underline}** Both American foreign policy and liberal
internationalism have been subject to strong attacks from a variety of
perspectives. **[Recently some have characterized liberal
internationalism as]{.underline}** a type of American imperialism, or as
**[a cloak for US imperialism]{.underline}**. Virtually every aspect of
American foreign policy has been contested within the United States.
Liberal internationalists have been strong enemies of imperialism and
military adventurism, whether American or from other states. This
started with the Whig's opposition to the War with Mexico and the
Progressive's opposition to the Spanish-American War, and continued with
liberal opposition to the War in Vietnam. The claim that liberal
internationalism leads to or supports American imperialism has also been
recently voiced by many American realists, perhaps most notably John
Mearsheimer (Theory Talk #49). He and others argue that liberal
internationalism played a significant role in bringing about the War on
Iraq waged by the W. Bush administration. This was indeed one of the
great debacles of US foreign policy. But **[[the War in Iraq
was]{.underline}]{.mark}** actually **[[a war waged]{.mark} by American
realists [for reasons grounded in realist]{.mark} foreign policy
[thinking]{.mark}]{.underline}**[.]{.mark} It is true, as Mearsheimer
emphasizes, that many academic realists criticized the Bush
administration's plans and efforts in the invasion in Iraq. Some
self-described American liberal internationalists in the policy world
supported the war, but **[[almost all]{.mark} academic American [liberal
internationalists were]{.mark} strongly [opposed]{.mark}]{.underline}**,
and much of the public opposition to the war was on grounds related to
liberal internationalist ideas. **[[It is]{.mark} patently [inaccurate
to say that]{.mark} main [actors]{.mark} in the US government [that
instigated the War]{.mark} on Iraq [were liberal
internationalists]{.mark}]{.underline}**. The main initiators of the war
were Richard Cheney and Donald Rumsfeld. Whatever can be said about
those two individuals, they are not liberal internationalists. They
initiated the war because they thought that the Saddam Hussein regime
was a threat to American interests---basically related to oil. The
Saddam regime was seen as a threat to American-centered regional
hegemony in the Middle East, an order whose its paramount purpose has
been the protection of oil, and the protection of the regional American
allies that posses oil. Saddam Hussein was furthermore a demonstrated
regional revisionist likely to seek nuclear weapons, which would greatly
compromise American military abilities in the region. Everything else
the Bush Administration's public propaganda machine said to justify the
war was essentially window dressing for this agenda. **[Far from being
motivated by a liberal internationalist agenda the key figures in the
Bush Administration viewed the collateral damage to international
institutions produced by the war as a further benefit, not a cost, of
the war]{.underline}**. It is particularly ironic that John Mearsheimer
would be a critic of this war, which seems in many ways a 'text book'
application of a central claim of his 'offensive realism,' that powerful
states can be expected, in the pursuit of their security and interests,
to seek to become and remain regional hegemons.

[Not all]{.underline} of the [dialogue between]{.underline} these [two
intellectual camps is]{.underline} quite so [contradictory,]{.underline}
of course. There are indeed many cases on which we would agree and where
we would be contending together against other camps and other attitudes.
The [international-security phraseology]{.underline} [was in fact
devised as a **deliberate paraphrase** of the traditional
national-security formulation]{.underline}, [a formula that had the
major defect of hinting]{.underline} that international [conflict was
always]{.underline}, at least where wars and weapons were concerned,
[going to be]{.underline} a matter of \"one man\'s meat being another
man\'s poison.\" The [reformulation]{.underline} thus has [had the
advantage of reminding one and all that **security for our side now
depends on security for the other side as well**]{.underline}, as it
becomes necessary for Washington to assure Moscow that it need never
rush into the use of its nuclear weapons of mass destruction, just as it
has become necessary for Moscow to assure the United States. It is
required that neither side be placed in a position of \"use them or lose
them\" with regard to such missiles. This [[**concern for the other
side\'s intentions** and interests is a crucial
aspect]{.underline}]{.mark} also [[of]{.underline}]{.mark} all of what
we outlined previously as **[[arms control]{.mark}.]{.underline}** [If
the]{.underline} most pressing [goal of arms control is to **reduce the
likelihood of war,**]{.underline} [this sometimes means that we will not
want to have some effective weapon our-selves and]{.underline} that [we
will indeed want our adversary to have certain kinds of
weapons]{.underline}. At the end of the 1950s, experts on the
arms-control issue were thus already advocating submarine-based
ballistic missiles for the United States and also for the Soviet
Union.\' [The important point about the research]{.underline} approach
[that speaks of arms control]{.underline} and international security [is
that it recognizes how **complicated** the maintenance of peace may
be]{.underline}, as some weapons are good for us to let our enemies
have, and some are bad for us to possess, but others are good for us to
possess, and so on. [Avoiding a nuclear war is terribly important, but
so is avoiding conventional wars]{.underline}. Avoiding conventional
wars is never trivial, but winning such a war, if it breaks out, may
still be of tremendous value to many people. [Keeping down the costs of
military preparations is always important, but sometimes this can be
achieved more easily by retaining nuclear weapons than by eliminating
them]{.underline}. [Arms control is not identical to
strategy]{.underline}, even though it addresses many of the same
difficulties and paradoxes, [and international- security reasoning
is,]{.underline} similarly, [**not identical to national-security
reasoning.** Peace-research advocates]{.underline} sometimes **[throw
away the baby with the bathwater]{.underline}** in [arguing that any
discussion]{.underline} of weapons details [amounts to a moral
compromise]{.underline} or to [an endorsement of]{.underline} the arms
race and [armed conflict. The crucial accomplishment in the
**advancement of arms-control reasoning** comes with the open and clear
acknowledgment that]{.underline} now [we must always care about the
self-interest and motivations of our adversary]{.underline}. [[If war
ever resembled a zero-sum game]{.mark},]{.underline} whereby whatever is
good for the adversary is bad for us and vice versa, the looming
possibility of [nuclear [war amounts to a **definitive
refutation**]{.mark}]{.underline} of this, [refutation]{.underline} that
[every military officer]{.underline} [is]{.underline} now [required to
understand]{.underline} just as any civilian analyst cannot evade it.
The worst for the other side is now also the worst for us as well, and
one cannot become a general or admiral today without showing a
well-developed awareness of this. The final criticism that might be
directed against the majority, but not all, of peace-research or peace
studies programs, from the perspective of international security or arms
control, might thus be phrased as follows: [the opposite intellectual
camp does not realize how much we are on the same side and how much has
been accomplished]{.underline}. (104-5)

One of the signature features of President Donald Trump's campaign was
his hostility to free trade. Then-candidate Trump repeatedly denigrated
various multilateral trade pacts as bad deals for the United States.
Pulling out of the [Trans-Pacific
Partnership](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/01/23/us/politics/tpp-trump-trade-nafta.html?_r=0),
appointing opponents of free trade---such as [Steve

and[Peter

key positions, and promises of tariffs that are likely to
produce[retaliatory](http://money.cnn.com/2017/01/14/news/economy/donald-trump-mexico-tariffs-response/)
[measures](https://www.ft.com/content/06638c26-d42c-11e6-9341-7393bb2e1b51),
all demonstrated that Trump was planning on following through on his
protectionist campaign rhetoric.

While Trump's [**[attack on free trade has important implications for
American and global economies, it will also have an impact on the
likelihood of war between the great powers]{.underline}**.]{.mark}

As discussed here previously, President Trump sees the world in [zero
sum
terms](https://niskanencenter.org/blog/trumps-transactional-foreign-policy/).
Absent disproportionate economic gains for the United States,
international agreements cannot be considered successful. However
beneficial such arrangements prove to be for all involved, Trump's
mercantilist outlook sees them as a raw deal for Americans.

It is not surprising therefore, that U.S. Treasury Secretary Steve
Mnuchin nixed attempts to include language supporting free trade in a
statement from a G-20 meeting in Baden-Baden, Germany. As CNN
[reported](http://money.cnn.com/2017/03/18/news/economy/g20-trade-protectionism-trump-germany/),
while the statement included some positive words on trade, "conspicuous
by its absence was the phrase 'we will resist all forms of
protectionism' that was contained in the communiqué from the last
meeting of the group in China, July 2016." Mnuchin rejected the idea
that the omission was meaningful, but **t[he unwillingness to reaffirm
American opposition to protectionism ignores that trade provides
benefits beyond the global economy. Specifically, [the expectation of
future trade affects the likelihood of war and
peace.]{.mark}]{.underline}**

The connection between trade and conflict has never been as simple as
early liberal theorists suggested. The idea, [wrongly attributed to the
nineteenth century French economist Frederic

that "**[[when goods don't cross borders, soldiers
will]{.underline}"]{.mark} still offers a good summation of the
longstanding position that [trade has pacifying effects on international
politics]{.underline}**[.]{.underline} The logic behind the argument is
compelling: **[[the greater the extent of commercial relations between
states, the less likely there will be conflict]{.mark} because the
economic cost of war (and the lost benefits of trade) will be too
high]{.underline}**. However, history has shown that states still
sometimes go to war despite high levels of economic interdependence at
the time of the conflict.

In his book [Economic Interdependence and
War](http://press.princeton.edu/titles/10403.html), political scientist
Dale Copeland explained that it is not the current level of trade that
is important to the likelihood of conflict. Rather, Copeland argues, it
is the expectation of future trade that determines a state's willingness
to go to war. He writes,

In a very real way[, **it does not matter in the least whether past and
current levels of trade and investment have been low**]{.underline}, as
long as leaders have strongly positive expectations of for the future.
**[[It is their future orientation and expectations of a future stream
of benefits that will likely make the leaders incline to
peace]{.underline}]{.mark}**. Likewise, it does not matter whether past
and current levels of commerce have been high **[if leaders believe they
are going to be cut off tomorrow or in the near future]{.underline}**.
It is their pessimism about the future **[that will]{.underline}
probably [drive these leaders to consider hard-line measures and even
war to safeguard the long-term security of the state.]{.underline}**

Multilateral trade has been a feature of the [liberal international
order developed after World War
II](http://press.princeton.edu/titles/9410.html) for a reason.
**[Postwar policymakers feared a return to the closed economic blocs of
the 1930s that helped drive the world to war]{.underline}**. It is
entirely possible that the norms in favor of free trade are robust
enough to withstand the absence of routine language from a statement by
a meeting of the world's finance ministers. But **[groups like the G-20
help set expectations about the future. Given the connection between
those expectations and conflict, [failing to reaffirm America's
opposition to protectionism could put the world on a dangerous
path.]{.mark}]{.underline}**

Introduction

This article explores the political involvement of transnational
corporations and their directors in elaborating the project of climate
capitalism advanced to address climate change. [The expression 'climate
capitalism' designates the neoliberal attempt to mitigate climate change
through market measures that turn aspects of nature into new means of
accumulation while minimizing end-of-pipe, direct state regulation of
greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions]{.underline} (Newell and Paterson 2010;
see also Bumpus and Liverman 2008; Lohmann 2010). At its face value,
[[climate capitalism promotes the use of carbon markets, carbon taxes,
and other financial mechanisms as means to redirect investment flows
away from the polluting fossil fuel sector and toward more climatically
benign renewable electricity generation and energy efficiency
initiatives.]{.underline}]{.mark} These new, reorganized investment
patterns would foster an ecological modernization of production
processes and lead to reduced GHG emissions (Böhm and Dabhi 2009; Newell
and Paterson 2010). For its proponents, climate capitalism would thus
reconcile capital accumulation and climate change mitigation by making
the latter profitable for capitalist firms themselves, hence drawing on
their economic interest to draw them into the project of reducing GHG
emissions (see, e.g., Lovins and Cohen 2011). This project is contrasted
not only with the business-as-usual scenario of fossil fuel-driven
'carboniferous capitalism' (Newell and Paterson 2010),1 but also with
transformative proposals seeking more radical changes in the capitalist
political economy, such as those of a 'green new deal', of economic
degrowth toward a steady-state economy, or of ecosocialism (Candeias
2013). Climate capitalism has been harshly critiqued, not the least
because carbon markets -- still the main climate capitalist policy
instrument (Sterk et al. 2015) -- appear unlikely to actually lead to a
meaningful reduction in GHG emissions (Böhm and Dabhi 2009; Lohmann
2006, 2011; Vlachou 2014). On the contrary, many argue that carbon
markets have only been effective in two respects: (1) in facilitating
capital accumulation through dispossession and privatization of the
commons in the global South, and encouraging speculation and
rent-seeking among owning elites (Lohmann 2008, 361; see also; Foster
and Clark 2009; Isla 2015; Fairhead, Leach, and Scoones 2012); (2) in
delaying action to mitigate global warming, a partly unintended
consequence yet also an outcome welcomed by all those corporations
dependent on fossil fuels (Derber 2010; Lohmann 2006; Lohmann and Böhm
2012). The latter is especially true since the economic crisis that
erupted in 2008 has actually brought a much increased dependence on
fossil fuel-based accumulation as a means of generating short-term
profits (Bitter 2011; Lohmann and Böhm 2012). For their part, carbon
taxes have had little effect in the few jurisdictions where they have
been implemented (Brännlund, Lundgren, and Marklund 2014; Lin and Li
2011; Smith 2011).2 Thus, it is argued that in contrast to its discourse
of ecological modernization, climate capitalism has had -- at least up
to now -- the same effects as the carboniferous capitalist regime it
purports to supplant, that is, to delay GHG emissions reduction while
facilitating corporate profit. Corporate-supported think tanks and
policy-planning groups play a crucial role in constructing projects,
such as climate capitalism, that seek to maintain capitalist relations
by transforming them (van der Pijl 1998). The work performed by these
organizations consists in (1) producing knowledge that informs and
legitimates certain types of economic governance while delegitimizing
others, and (2) mobilizing this knowledge by linking elite networks
across sectoral and national boundaries, thus facilitating convergence
of ideas and consensus-making (Burris 2008; Carroll and Carson 2003;
Carroll and Sapinski 2010). That is, 'they provide an organizational
basis for the emergence, articulation, and diffusion of ideas within the
groups, factions and classes in which they are embedded' (Sapinski,
forthcoming). In the field of climate politics, corporate-funded climate
and environmental policy groups (CEPGs), such as the International
Emissions Trading Association (IETA) and the World Business Council for
Sustainable Development (WBCSD), play such a role of knowledge
production and mobilization (KPM). CEPGs conduct intensive lobbying with
governments and UN agencies to promote climate capitalism. They also
send representatives to the yearly UN Conferences of Parties (COPs),
where they hold side-events as part of their KPM activities, to which
corporate managers and policy-makers are invited (Tansey 2013). More
importantly for this article, by virtue of their organizational
structure, they function as places where the corporate elite and other
elites can meet, plan strategy, forge consensus on key issues, and
create a sense of community around the climate capitalist project (see
Carroll and Sapinski 2010; Domhoff 2014). In this way, they constitute
major venues where responses to the climate crisis are debated, and
provide a crucial capacity to bridge lines of fraction among corporate
elites from different regions and economic sectors (Sapinski,
forthcoming). This article assesses the role of CEPGs in constructing
the hegemony of climate capitalism among the global corporate elite. It
uses social network analysis (SNA) to map out the constellations of
corporate power in which CEPGs are embedded. [[The analysis will address
the question whether climate capitalism, as a hegemonic
project]{.underline}]{.mark} (Jessop 1990), [[stands a chance of
overtaking the currently existing regime of carboniferous capitalism and
become hegemonic among the global corporate elite.]{.underline}]{.mark}
By doing so, it will contribute to found empirically debates among
analysts of climate politics (see Bond 2013; Hahnel 2012; Lohmann 2011,
2012; Paterson and Newell 2012) and potentially inform political action.
Whereas previous research I conducted outlined the existence of a
climate capitalist policy-planning network (Sapinski, forthcoming), this
article assesses the reach of the CEPGs at the core of that network into
the very top layers of the global corporate community. This will shed
light on the position the climate capitalist project occupies within the
broader field of global corporate power. On the basis of this
assessment, I will discuss: (1) the possibility of an eventual
corporate-led transition to a climate capitalist production regime, and
(2) what consensus on climate capitalism may actually be achieved given
the different political-economic interests represented on CEPG boards.
In what follows, I will first provide details on the SNA methodology.
The second section will then discuss briefly the discourse and action
repertoire of the CEPGs that make up the core of this study. Next, the
main analyses explore where CEPGs stand within the global field of
corporate power, here operationalized as the 500 largest corporations in
the world and the network of boardlevel interlocks that connects them
together (Carroll 2010). For this, (1) considering the network at the
interorganizational level where corporations and CEPGs link together, I
will look at the position CEPGs occupy among the network of G500
interlocking directorships; (2) looking at the network at the
interindividual level, I will delineate an 'inner circle' of climate
capitalism composed of a small number of key individuals who bind the
field together (Sapinski, forthcoming). A brief overview of inner circle
members' corporate affiliations will provide an indication as to the
eventual policy content of climate capitalism and thus whether it has
any potential to avoid catastrophic climate change.

INTEGRATING ECONOMIC ANALYSIS AND PUBLIC DECISION MAKING FOR CLIMATE
CHANGE POLICIES9

The challenges posed by climate change and the challenges to applying
economic analysis raise the question of what can be done with respect to
normative analysis of climate change risks and policies. One relatively
unprofitable strategy is to minimise the urgency of the problem. This
can be done in different ways and is not the unique province of one
political persuasion. Within the administration of George W. Bush the
emphasis has been on the need to augment \'sound science and broaden
participation by developing countries before taking significant or
mandatory actions. Within the Clinton Administration, on the other hand,
the tendency often was to downplay economic analyses of GHG mitigation
costs, and to argue that a combination of voluntary measures and
international emissions trading would make significant GHG cuts possible
at negligible or even negative cost.10 Another approach is to argue that
decisions about GHG mitigation and adaptation policies are essentially
political. Arguments for this view include the idea that technical
analysis of costs and benefits from GHG policies inherently cannot
reflect the complex preferences and values of \'real people;\' and that
scientific analysis (physical, not just economic) cannot provide a
robust basis for evaluating policy options since scientists themselves
make value judgments about what facets of climate change are important
to understand better and how to go about studying them (Norton 1992). In
this view, climate change policies become legitimated through
transparent and fair political processes that command sufficiently broad
public support. [[Transparent and fair political processes are clearly
important to the determination of sound climate change
policies.]{.underline}]{.mark} But informed processes are important as
well. While admittedly somewhat of a caricature, the view expressed in
the previous paragraph seems to be too nihilistic with respect to the
ability of scientific analysis to provide useful information, and the
ability of the public to assimilate and benefit from that information.
Some intermediate position seems more profitable. One such approach can
be outlined by combining two ideas already discussed in the
environmental literatures: the notion of methodologically pluralistic
approaches to goal setting and evaluation, and the notion of iterative
processes for public information ad decision making. Climate change
seems to be an issue well suited to \'two-tier\' frameworks for
structuring goals and assessment of options, though there are still
serious operational problems to be overcome in using such an approach
(see Toman 1994 and Norton and Toman 1997 for discussions). In this sort
of framework, decision makers first consider what criteria and
management tools to apply to a particular issue. Human impacts on the
environment that are larger in scale and longer in duration give rise to
greater concerns about the opportunities for well-being available to
future generations (as well as to the present), and about the
constraints on opportunities for amelioration of adverse effects through
resource substitution and innovation. In such cases, standard economic
calculations need supplementing with information about the physical
robustness of underlying ecological systems and the potential
consequences over time, and by information about social norms (e.g.,
basic presumptions about fairness to existing communities and future
generations) that might be affected. Impacts that are smaller in scale
and shorter in duration are more amenable to being treated through
conventional cost-benefit tools, supplemented with information about
nonmonetisable impacts and distributional consequences. In the context
of climate change, [[mitigation policies undertaken by the current
generation will impose costs (and generate some ancillary benefits, like
air quality improvements) for the current
generation]{.underline}]{.mark}. These costs should be assessed to the
extent possible using the best state of the art in economic analysis,
including procedures for intragenerational discounting that reflect the
opportunity costs of changes in consumption and investment sreams. [[The
benefits of action or the costs of inaction, on the other hand, are more
complex to assess since they involve significant redistributions of
income between current and future generations]{.underline}]{.mark}; they
will accrue globally, not just to our own heirs; they are difficult to
estimate; and they will depend on the actions taken - for example,
actions to reduce future risks by limitingreenhouse gas emissions,
versus actions to promote adaptability to future climate change that can
also provide more immediate economic development benefits. Simply
calculating the present value of these effects as they appear to the
current generation does not provide an adequate basis for evaluating
different outcomes. An alternative is to provide a description of the
effects (monetary and otherwise) and their timing, so that decision
makers can weigh these effects and their costs against a variety of
ethical criteria and the expressed wishes of various stakeholders. This
approach uses multiple normative perspectives in the first tier to
assess how an issue should be judged, and then in the second tier in
evaluating the issue and decisions (though the mix of perspectives will
vary depending on the first tier outcome). This is not just an
application of \'scientific\' policy analysis, as can be underscored by
the fact that value judgments will permeate the firstier categorisation
as well as guiding the second tier evaluation. The process thus can
operate successfully only if it is superimposed on a mature ongoing
social discussion about which values matter in which contexts. This
superimposition enables an interaction between science, on the one hand,
and the process of values formation and education, on the other. To go
further along these lines, we can envisage an approach to evaluating
climate change policy goals and options that is not only pluralistic but
also iterative, to reflect and support processes of public learning and
value formation. The process might take the following very stylised
form: ( 1 ) Prior assessment of what criteriand evaluation tools should
apply to the issue. In the two-tier model sketched above, this amounts
to assessing where the issue lies on a continuum between abasic analysis
of economic tradeoffs and an analysis more circumscribed by physical
limits on substitution ad the operation of broader social norms, which
themselves must be identified. (2) Assessment of physical impacts from
different courses of action to the extent possible, with particular
attention to their scale, to the identificationf impacts that are
difficult to evaluate in monetary terms, and to distributional issues
across space and time. (3) Assessment of economic benefits and costs
from different courses of action to the extent possible, as well as
their incidence in space and time. (4) Further identificationf whether
and how social values or norms beyond the quantified benefits and costs
may be affected by a decision. (5) Engagement of public discourse about
both the consequences of different actions and the applicable social
values, especially where operable norms are not clear-cut or are
conflicting. This is the step that explicitly acknowledges that the
decision process cannot be purely scientific. The public engagement can
take various forms, from educational programs to multiple-stakeholder
negotiations to interagency debates characterised by disclosure and
electoral accountability. (6) Decisionmaking based on the pluralistic
approach and criteria outlined above. (7) Using the results of the
decision process to consider what new information and uncertainties have
been revealed about both science and social values, and plugging these
insights back into both the values discourse and scientific research
agendas. [[This]{.underline}]{.mark} conceptual [[model retains an
important role for economic analysis, but it seeks to broaden the
analysis beyond a single net benefits calculation and to embed it in a
broader discussion of social values and potential
actions]{.underline}]{.mark}. The approach seeks also to emphasise that
debate on [[climate change]{.underline}]{.mark} (or more generally, on
sustainability) [[cannot be resolved solely by recourse to natural or
social scientific inquiry]{.underline}]{.mark}. For example, substantial
progress in resolving uncertainties about the effects of greenhouse
gases on the world\'s climate system, and the effects of climatic
changes on ecological systems and human well-being, will not in
themselves address basic disagreements about the importance of humans
versus nature. As already indicated, the application of the idealised
approach sketched here presents enormous practical challenges,
especially given that the issue touches on everybody (versus, for
example, a local land use squabble) and involves such high levels of
uncertainty. How to translate this almost metaphorical set of ideas into
action is itself an important research task beyond the scope of this
paper. 1 1 Even if climate policy debates remain mainly the province of
public officials and technical specialists, however, there are still
lessons to be drawn. Informed consumers of climate change policy
analysis can ask for greater clarity in underlying assumptions about
principles as well as methodologies. Analysts can organise their work in
ways that reflect the need for pluralistic evaluations, multiple types
of information. Both analysts and policy makers can communicate
conclusions in ways that better support evolving public understanding
and values with regard to climate change

Critique of Green Political Economy New Political Economy 6 (2) p.

Hayekian political economy, markets and communicative rationality

Given the environmental and economic failures of technocratic planning,
demon- strated most clearly by the experience of East European
socialism, the critique of such procedures by Habermasian approaches is
surely well placed. What is perplexing about Green democratic theory,
however, is the similarly critical attitude towards market institutions.
Instrumentalist models have indeed pro- vided a signi cant element in
arguments for the market, which, as in the case of public choice theory,
emphasise the primacy of incentives, but it is inappropriate to suggest
that this is the principal rationale for markets advanced by the liberal
tradition. Arguably, the most forceful and in uential advocacy of market
institution s derives from Hayek and the 'Austrian school', none of
whose arguments depends on any assumptions about the motivations of
individual decision makers. These arguments do not, for example, assume
that individuals are self-interested utility maximisers, as is the case
in orthodox neoclassical economics and in public choice theory.15 The
con ation of the case for markets with a positivistic , instrumentalist
conception of reason is particularly surprising when considering that
the focus on non-quanti able, tacit and intersubjective forms of
knowledge in deliberative theory (i.e. a hermeneutic account of social
interaction) also constitutes the very heart of the critique of
government planning and the advocacy of markets put forward by Hayek.
[[Hayek's liberalism does not rest on a rationalist defence of the
market, but instead offers a radical, epistemological alternative as a
means for illuminating the primary merits of the market
system]{.underline}]{.mark}. Hayekian liberals oppose neoclassical
conceptions of markets, arguing that these models present individuals as
atomistic automatons, responding to objective 'data' in the manner of
robots. If such a world existed then there would in fact be no scope for
individual choice, for people would have no option but to respond to the
objective stimuli before them.16 Similarly, if objective knowledge of
relative resource scarcities could be made available in 'scienti c'
form, then it would be possible to dispense with the market in favour of
central planning and to have the allocation of resources supervised by
government of cials employing the techniques of social cost/bene t
analysis. From a Hayekian perspective, it is precisely because values
and knowledge are to a signi cant extent subjective that central
planning is unlikely to succeed. The 'Austrian' advocacy of markets
views individua l choice as a creative act, which takes places under
conditions of imperfect information, chronic uncertainty and with the
distinct possibility of error.17 Individuals are not conceived as
'rational actors', because such action would require the pursuit of some
optimal course, given objective knowledge of economic opportunity.
Rather, people should be viewed as purposeful actors who base their
plans on subjective perceptions of the opportunitie s before them. The
market economy, meanwhile, should be seen as a profoundly social process
of intersubjective trial and error, in which people learn about and at
the same time shape one another's plans and preferences. Market actors,
to use Gadamer's terminology, attempt to 'fuse their horizons' with
those of others, so as to discover which goods to produce.18 Hayekian
liberalism is clearly not af icted with the 'analytic sensibility',
which fails to consider the signi cance of social wholes in
non-reductionist terms. As Madison has noted,19 Hayek was one of the 
rst modern social theorists to give an account of social wholes in
irreducibly social terms, and he adopted the notion of 'spontaneous
order' to ful l this very task.20 Spontaneous orders such as language
and the market are 'spontaneous' in the sense that they were never
consciously 'planned' and cannot, therefore, adequately be accounted for
in terms of isolated, atomistic individuals (no one 'invented the
market'). Theories which attempt to explain social phenomena in such
rationalist terms are guilty of a 'false', Cartesian individualism.
'True' individualism, by contrast, is characterised by an attempt to
understand the forces which in uence the life of individuals as social
beings.21 For Hayek, the central concern of social science is to account
for those generalised, transsubjective patterns of meaning that are the
product of human action, but are not the result of human design.22
Spontaneous orders of a social or economic sort are neither natural nor
arti cial, they are neither subjective (of the individua l mind) nor
objective (matter). Rather, they should be conceived in intersubjective
terms. Hayekian political economy, therefore, is concerned with the
communicative function of social institution s in general.23 To the
extent that both Green deliberativists and Hayekian liberals conceive of
social coordination as a process of intersubjective learning, then
[[these two approaches appear to be treading similar
ground.]{.mark}]{.underline} Where Hayekians part com- pany with the
deliberative democrats, however, is in their account of the institutiona
l processes that are compatible with these epistemological foundations.
Dryzek and his followers emphasise the importance of face-to-face
communication and the conveyance of information via public discourse and
debate. For Hayekians, by contrast, markets are required to facilitate
intersubjective learning and coordination in situations where conscious
deliberation and face-to-face communication are simply not possible. In
order to understand the basis of a liberal critique of Green political
economy, which  ows from this perspective, it is necessary to  esh out
in a little more detail the communicative function of markets and the
epistemological de ciencies of government plan- ning. In Hayekian
political economy, knowledge is considered to be diffuse, to a large
extent subjective and, far from being given, must be produced through a
process of trial and error learning.24 This is not to say that no
objective information may be obtained in a centralised form, but that
even in the presence of such 'scienti c' data different individuals will
interpret the implications to bederived from the same data in different
ways. Prices formed by the interaction of market participants,
therefore, are not a re ection of objective underlying relative
scarcities, but are formed in part through the interplay of subjective
beliefs about these scarcities. Human action takes place in a world of
uncertainty where the outcomes of choices are to a signi cant extent
imagined.25 Crucially, it is the lack of an effective equivalent to the
re exive feedback provided by the pro t and loss account and the
relational properties of market prices that reduces the process of
social learning in a centrally planned system. From a Hayekian
perspective, planners (democratically elected or otherwise) can never
perceive and respond to as many instances of dis-coordination as can
individuals who have the freedom to exchange property titles in the
market.26 Knowledge of means and ends is scattered in the minds of many
dispersed actors, each of whom may possess subjective information that
no one else discerns. [[Even in a world of perfect altruism, therefore,
public-spirited planners could not obtain the information to engage in a
process of conscious social planning due to the cognitive limits of the
human mind.]{.underline}]{.mark}27 In the market economy, by contrast,
each entrepreneurial act, such as the offering of a new price/product or
changing the organisational form of pro- duction, actively creates new
knowledge that might otherwise have gone unnoticed and may act to
persuade other individuals to change their plans.28 Entrepreneurial pro
ts (and losses) may then be noticed by actors who imitate the behaviour
of the successful and learn not to make the same errors as the
unsuccessful. In turn, the structure of relative prices that emerges
provides a way for people to discover what goods are more or less
saleable, without ever having explicitly to ask or to articulate reasons
why this is the case. As the behaviour of the successful is emulated
more knowledge is produced and spreads throughout the market in a
snowballing process, the results of which could never have been given to
a group of minds attempting to simulate this process in advance.29 It
should be noted that the existence of large, bureaucratically managed
corporations, which might themselves be said to engage in a form of
'central planning', does not undermine the case for private markets.
There may be important social gains, in terms of reducing transaction
costs and the bene ts of scale economies, to be made from centralisation
and the operation of a hierarchi- cal management system. As Coase
famously pointed out, this is after all why  rms exist.30 The key point
is that the optimum scale of economic organisations (i.e. the optimum
scale at which 'planning' can take place) cannot be known in advance of
competition, but is itself something that must be discovered and
rediscovered through an open ended process of trial and error.31 The
appropriate boundary between the 'spontaneous order' of 'the market' and
the 'planned or designed order' of 'the  rm' is itself subject to a
process of entrepreneurial experimentation. 32 It is for precisely this
reason that the size and number of  rms in different industrial sectors
varies so markedly from decade to decade. [[Markets, therefore, whilst
far from 'perfect', may offer a better mechanism to determine the
appropriate scale of 'planning' organisations than administration by
government bureaucracies, which are not themselves subject to an
equivalent competitive discovery procedure.]{.underline}]{.mark}33

## Legalism K 

### 2AC AT Legalism K

The 1AC should be weighed against a competitive alternative and the ways
it responds to institutions. any alternative is self-serving and moots
the 1ac which undermines clash and fairness -- the roll of the ballot is
to determine the desirability of the hypothetical implementation of the
1AC.

#### The aff alone solves---successful leftist politics requires legalism---the alternative merely cedes constitutionalism to an overwhelmingly conservative Supreme Court

- This card could be great but it does say that libertarianism in terms
  of a free market is bad. Not sure how to reconcile this but?

- Also the aff is def pretty libertarian oops

**Purdy 18,** (9-10-2018, Jedediah Purdy (J.D., Yale Law School, 2001,
A.B., Harvard College, 1997) is a professor of Law at Columbia
University Law School. Before then, Purdy taught at Duke Law School for
14 years. He has been a visiting professor at Yale Law School, Harvard
Law School, Stanford Law School, the University of Virginia School of

for Judge Pierre N. Leval of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 2nd
Circuit.\"The Left's Guide to Reclaiming the Constitution,\" The New
York Times, https://www.nytimes.com/2018/09/10/opinion/brett-

With Brett Kavanaugh's nomination to the Supreme Court, progressives see
a dystopian future: a judicial gavel pounding down for decades on voting
rights, workers' rights, women's rights and more. But rather than
despairing or scheming for 1930s-style court packing, [[what
progressives need most is a constitutional vision of their own, a vivid
picture of what judges should do with the power of the
courts.]{.underline}]{.mark}

At a time when the left is on the offensive in ideas and policies,
political struggles are providing a compass for progressive
jurisprudence. [Progressives should not just resist the erosion of
important legal gains, but say --- starting today --- what they believe
the courts should do, and what they believe the Constitution
means.]{.underline}

The centerpiece should be a constitutionalism of strong democracy.
Fighting against the vote-suppression efforts of a Republican Party that
dominates national politics despite being in the minority in
presidential and Senate votes, [Democrats are recognizing the extent of
disenfranchisement --- of former felons, incarcerated people, Puerto
Rican citizens and those whose jobs and family responsibilities keep
them from the polls on any given Tuesday]{.underline}.

In the mid-1960s, the Supreme Court announced a fundamental right to
vote and established the one-person, one-vote rule. But as the court has
grown more conservative direction, it has upheld voter-suppression laws,
eroded the Voting Rights Act and, in a [quietly momentous
decision](https://www.oyez.org/cases/1973/72-1589) in 1974, held felon
disenfranchisement constitutional.

Judges should restore voting rights to the roughly [more than six
million
people](https://www.sentencingproject.org/publications/6-million-lost-voters-state-level-estimates-felony-disenfranchisement-2016/) who
cannot vote because of a previous crime. They should scrupulously
examine laws that limit ballot access for young and nonwhite voters.
They should revisit the century-old cases that authorized the United
States to govern permanent territories of noncitizens --- decisions with
implicitly racist and nationalist foundations --- and hold that as
Americans, Puerto Ricans must be full members of the political process.

These reforms would tend to benefit progressive candidates, but they are
also matters of democratic principle. [The best role for the Supreme
Court is to help maintain fair rules for the political process, and
nothing is more basic than the right of citizens to form their own
government.]{.underline}

Second, progressive candidates and activists are pressing for a new
conception of economic citizenship: universal health and family leave,
free higher education, access to union membership and other workplace
protections against the power of owners and bosses. That would inform a
constitutionalism of economic citizenship.

For decades, [[the Supreme Court has ignored economic power, protecting
unlimited campaign spending as a form of speech, undercutting
public-sector unions as burdens on the conscience of anti-union
employees and upholding "voluntary" arbitration agreements that sign
away workers' protections against abuse and
exploitation]{.mark}.]{.underline} The unifying impulse in these
opinions is the libertarian conceit that the free market is really free,
not shaped by unequal power and vulnerability.

But people aren't meaningfully free unless they have some security and
some option to say no --- that is, some power. Judges should protect
unions as essential institutions of worker power. They should treat
policies like the Medicaid expansion as essential efforts to achieve
economic security, treating them as obviously constitutional in the same
way that core civic institutions like jury duty are obviously
constitutional. They should hold that federal law does not authorize
arbitration agreements where workers sign away basic protections,
because those protections are part of the fabric of economic
citizenship. Instead of assuming that the law exists to uphold private
--- and often unequal --- agreements, they should assume that its job is
to help correct inequality.

Economic citizenship also has important meaning for abortion rights. All
liberal justices support the freedom to choose, but it is worth much
less to poor women far from services, as many are in the South and West.
Decades ago a divided court ruled that Medicaid and other federal
programs can refuse to fund abortion while paying for live births and
other reproductive care. This is a breach of the usual principle that
government may not penalize people for exercising a constitutional
right. (Imagine student loans only for those who agree not to vote.) It
is time to reopen this question.

Third is a constitutionalism of just criminal justice. [Activists are
raising a new generation of questions about policing and the prison
system: who gets stopped, the system of money bail that keeps arrestees
locked up simply because they cannot raise the cash to get out, the ways
prosecutors' offices set priorities, and the widespread and highly
unequal incarceration that results.]{.underline}

An earlier generation of court rulings established the right to a lawyer
for criminal defendants and protections against arbitrary and abusive
treatment by the police. Today we need justices who will address a new
generation of issues. They should rule that it violates due process of
law to languish in jail, away from work and family, because you cannot
make bail. They should hold that [constitutional equality is offended
when white and nonwhite people --- or poor and wealthy people --- have
pervasively different experiences of criminal justice.]{.underline}

Progressives are winning important victories on these fronts by electing
reformist prosecutors, but constitutional rulings can press change
throughout the system, not just in sympathetic cities and states. [The
core work of the law is organizing and disciplining government's
coercive power, and whether that power reinforces racial and economic
inequalities or helps to neutralize them is one of the most basic
questions for a legal system.]{.underline}

Fourth is a constitutionalism that respects the rights of noncitizens.
Spurred by President Trump's nativism, a new wave of mobilization and
solidarity with migrants has highlighted the extreme legal, economic and
sexual vulnerability of millions of undocumented residents and workers.

[The courts have long tolerated different treatment of foreigners than
of United States citizens and authorized residents. But the
family-separation crisis at the border has highlighted the American
archipelago of lawlessness that asylum-seekers and unauthorized
border-crossers face]{.underline}: little meaningful process, and opaque
and seemingly arbitrary decisions with life-or-death consequences. The
right to due process of law applies to everyone in the power of the
United States government, not just citizens. A progressive jurisprudence
would strike down policies like family separation and require a decent,
intelligible and transparent process to decide on the rights of
noncitizens. It would be more expensive than the present system, but
legitimacy is not free.

It may seem like pointless fantasizing to plot progressive rulings when
the right is tightening its grip on the courts. But these things change
quickly: No one expected Mr. Trump to be appointing justices. And the
demographic, generational and ideological changes that are reviving the
left may well shape decades of politics.

Even if the Democrats retake the elected branches, they will face
surprises from Mr. Trump's judges --- like the 2012 decision that
undercut the Obamacare Medicaid expansion, in which four conservative
justices would have invalidated the Affordable Care Act altogether. And
even when the courts don't stand in the way, progressive reformers will
need help from judges. [A constitutional vision is also part of how a
party defines itself to its constituencies.]{.underline} Republicans
have long identified themselves as the party of the Constitution ---
that is, their preferred version of it. [After years of professionalized
and defensive lawyering, the left needs an answer in the same
terms.]{.underline}

[[Every political movement has its constitutional visions, from Great
Society liberalism to Reaganite economic libertarianism and cultural
conservatism.]{.underline}]{.mark} The work now is to define a
jurisprudence of economic citizenship, strong democracy and inclusive
justice that will help a resurgent left reclaim the Constitution.

Demilitarizing and Reversing the Arms Race

Every gun that is made, every warship launched, every rocket fired
signifies, in the final sense, a theft from those who hunger and are not
fed, those who are cold and are not clothed. This world in arms is not
spending money alone. It is spending the sweat of its laborers, the
genius of its scientists, the hopes of its children \.... This is not a
way of life at all, in any true sense. Under the cloud of threatening
war, it is humanity hanging from a cross of iron. .- Dwight D.
Eisenhower 153 The United States has achieved unprecedented world
military domination and clearly intends to maintain it. 154 The United
States remains the only nation to have used nuclear weapons on civilian
populations-actions that certainly would be considered war crimes had
the United States lost that war.155 [[As Martin Luther King, Jr.,
pointed out, militarism is one of the evils that must be addressed to
bring about a world based on justice.]{.underline}]{.mark} 56 U.S.
military dominance has come about at an unimaginable financial,
physical, and moral cost to the well-being of the world and of the
nation itself. Obviously, the costs include draining resources away from
opportunities to address poverty. [In addition to the waste of
resources, there remains a justice question-under what theory of human
rights, justice or dignity can the United States stake its claim to
world military dominance and unilateral military and nuclear action?
Under what theory of human dignity and justice does the United States
justify huge stockpiles of nuclear weapons and the right to use them
again?]{.underline} **[[The law and lawyers are often involved in
justifying and assisting our world military dominance. Justice must work
to radically undermine and root out the current legal practices that
allow the leaders of one nation a unilateral right to invade and destroy
the people of another by preemptive conventional or nuclear
actions]{.underline}]{.mark}**. Otherwise, there can be no realistic
expectation that human dignity will be respected, or that the
inequalities that result in poverty will be fundamentally addressed at
any time. The United States\' global military dominance is breathtaking.
57 Military spending in the United States, totaling over \$450 billion,
represents 47% of all the money spent on militaries in the entire
world.158 This is more than the combined military budgets of the United
Kingdom, France, Japan, China, Germany, Italy, Russia, Saudi Arabia,
South Korea, India, Israel, Canada, Turkey and Australia-the next
fifteen countries combined. 5 9 The United States recently criticized
China for increasing its military budget, while maintaining one of its
own that is seven to eighteen times larger. 160 The U.S. military budget
is more than thirty times as large as the combined spending of the seven
\"rogue states\" (Cuba, Iran, Iraq, Libya, North Korea, Sudan and
Syria).16\' The United States maintains a world-wide military
presence.\' 62 The U.S. Department of Defense admits to having 725
military bases in thirty-eight countries outside of the United States,
163 in addition to the 969 military bases within the United States. 164
The United States trains about 100,000 foreign soldiers each year, 65
and is by far the biggest seller of weapons-in only four years, from
1997 to 2001, we exported over \$44 billion worth of arms. 166 Since
World War II, the United States has launched over fifty military and CIA
interventions in nations around the world, not counting the latest
invasion of Iraq. 1 67 Nuclear weapons provide several specific
challenges: staggering costs, current perils, and the fundamental
question of their legitimacy. The cost to the United States of building
and maintaining nuclear weapons has been documented at more than \$5.5
trillion from 1940 to 1996.168 What is \$5.5 trillion? The amount spent
on nuclear weapons alone \"exceeds the combined total over the same
period of federal spending on education, training, employment, and
social services; on agriculture; on natural resources and the
environment; on general science and space research; on community and
regional development, including disaster relief; on law enforcement; and
on energy production and regulation.\"\'1 69 The United States is the
only nation to have used nuclear weapons on civilians, certainly a crime
against humanity. 170 Tens of thousands were killed in these nuclear
strikes. 171 In Hiroshima, it is estimated that 45,000 died the first
day and 19,000 more died within four months; in Nagasaki, an estimated
22,000 people died the first day and approximately 17,000 others died
within four months. 172 The use or potential use of nuclear weapons is
generally considered to be illegal. The International Court of Justice
(ICJ) issued an opinion on July 8, 1996, stating that \"\[t\]he threat
or use of nuclear weapons would generally be contrary to the rules of
international law applicable in armed conflict, and in particular the
principles and rules of humanitarian law.\"\' 173 The court went on to
conclude unanimously that \"\[t\]here exists an obligation to pursue in
good faith and bring to a conclusion negotiations leading to nuclear
disarmament in all its aspects under strict and effective international
control.\' 74 Yet, the United States continues to stockpile and maintain
at readiness thousands of nuclear weapons. The United States retains
over 10,000 nuclear weapons, over 5000 of which are currently
operational. 175 The annual cost of maintaining the nuclear weapons
program was estimated in 1998 at \$35 billion.176 The United States
makes explicit its willingness to take preemptive military action when
it thinks that it or \"\[its\] allies and friends\" are faced with
danger. 177 The invasion of Iraq shows the willingness of the United
States to take action based on the flimsiest of frauds in order to
exercise military power for political means.178 Under what concept of
human dignity and justice can the United States claim the right to be
the world\'s biggest military power for now and the future? Radical
change is needed. Laws that justify the creation, presence and
deployment of nuclear weapons must be discarded. Laws that justify and
support spending on military dominance must likewise be destroyed.
[**[Lawyers must work with others to reverse the direction of these
policies, or else there may be nothing left for anyone to
defend]{.mark}**. We must demilitarize and reverse the arms race in
order to redirect resources to people, instead of to perpetual,
preemptive, and possibly world-ending wars]{.underline}.

and Political Economy,
https://lpeblog.org/2019/03/05/movement-visions-for-a-renewed-left-legalism/)

In this moment of crisis for the rule of law, a number of thinkers on
the left have prescribed new strategies for progressives to shift
reigning ideas about constitutionalism and the law. Jedediah Purdy, for
example, has argued that part of [**[the answer is to "[reclaim the
Constitution](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/09/10/opinion/brett-kavanaugh-supreme-court-constitution-democrats-.html)"
by articulating visions of how constitutional rules can promote true
democracy]{.mark}.** In Purdy's view, strengthening voting rights and
the rights of non-citizens, promoting economic citizenship, and
reforming the criminal legal system should be central to a left vision
of the Constitution.]{.underline} He argues these substantive ideas pose
a challenge to the status quo distribution of power, resources, and life
chances. Eyeing a different branch of government, Samuel Moyn
has [urged](http://bostonreview.net/law-justice/samuel-moyn-resisting-juristocracy) progressives
to resist the "juristocracy" and to shift our vision for change away
from the courts and towards legislators at all levels. Moyn bases his
analysis on the idea that in the short term, legislatures will be more
likely than Trump-appointed judges to enact laws that reduce inequality.

Purdy and Moyn generate important insights for left lawyers and social
justice activists. But neither identifies where we should look for the
substance of left legalist vision, or the process by which we should
derive one. How is it that we, as progressives, should generate and
evaluate the desired ends of constitutional doctrine or legislative
change? Addressing this question is essential for a renewed left
legalism of the sort this blog and its community hope to provoke.

As we suggested in [our prior
piece](https://lpeblog.org/2019/03/04/movement-visions-for-a-renewed-left-politics),
we believe **[a left political agenda must be grounded in solidarities
with social movement and left organizations, largely outside of formal
legal and elite academic spaces]{.underline}**. (Willie Forbath, too,
recently gestured on
this [blog](https://lpeblog.org/2019/02/14/three-views-of-constitutional-political-economy/#more-1915) at
the relationship between social movements, labor, and left
legalism.) The prevailing underlying presumption of much legal discourse
is that the formulation and interpretation of legal doctrine requires
specialized expertise. Past waves of left legalist critique, such as
Critical Legal Studies, reflected this traditionally elitist approach to
law by remaining confined within elite institutions and purveyed by law
professors, sometimes in impenetrable language. Like Purdy and Moyn, we
care deeply about democratic engagement, but we believe that the
institutional choice between courts and legislatures misses the bigger
picture: that **[[a new left legalism should be derived from social
movements fighting for justice on the ground.]{.underline}]{.mark}**

written about how movements are engaging in the radical rethinking of
law, law reform, and the state. [The epistemological method that we
describe collectively in our work is in many ways *anti-constitutional*,
in that the jurisgenesis is organic and bottom-up, most often a weaving
together of ideas and practices originated at the margins of the legal
order]{.underline}. It is anti-constitutional in another sense, in that
it rejects the mythologizing of the founding, in particular, to
use [Aziz Rana's
frame](http://www.hup.harvard.edu/catalog.php?isbn=9780674284333), it
refuses to ignore that second face of American freedom: enslavement and
settler colonialism, which is central to the early history and ongoing
realities of the country. At the same time, **[our epistemology of legal
imagination on the ground contributes to the development of a new kind
of constitutionalism, one that generates collective ideas of how we
should relate to the state and to each other]{.underline}**. These
collective imaginaries relate to formal legal institutions like courts
and legislatures; but the ideas come from contemporary social movements,
movements composed of the very people who are *excluded* from
traditional sites and methods of generating legal understanding. It is
alongside these social movements that we should position ourselves when
generating ideas about legal change.

Our call to promote collaboration with movements is one of
epistemological diversification and alternate courses of action. As law
professors, for example, we believe [it is essential to study and teach
how law is made, imagined, and contested through social movements and
community organizing]{.underline}. Through such engagement, our capacity
to support these grassroots projects may grow. Similarly, if public
interest legal organizations reallocated just a fraction of their
capacity away from individual legal representation or impact litigation
to collaborations with visionary organizers, left legalism will flourish
and be exponentially more generative. (For bright stars leading the way,

work alongside social movements, modeling radical participatory
governance, what emerges are ideas about what laws can do that extend
beyond longstanding, rigid boundaries.]{.underline}]{.mark}**

Law-making of this sort necessarily involves ongoing dialogical
relationships with movements and with each other. Intellectually, we
need to hold conflicting ideas in our heads, in the way that Critical
Race Theory has long counseled: of reforming existing laws and doctrines
and abolishing legal institutions that are near-constant sources of all
stripes of slow and fast violence; of fighting for change under law
while understanding it is not the end of the horizon. In order to
successfully negotiate these sometimes conflicting relationships and
generate transformative ideas, [leaders and thinkers on the left need to
recommit to full investment in the intellectual and political capacity
of organized social movements.]{.underline}

**[A left legal agenda with the necessary power to transform our social,
economic, and political order must be grounded in solidarities with
social movements and their allied
organizations.]{.underline}** Approaches to law that prescribe
particular constitutional or even political economy norms without
grounding those prescriptions in collective struggle will remain
limited, bound in the halls of power. Social change comes from bold
visions sustained by a critical intellectual-political firmament, and
sustained efforts at pragmatic, boisterous and plural campaigns for
concrete change. Contemporary social movements are engaging in the
radical, practical rethinking of law, law reform, and the state. Our
inspiration for reimagining our collective future should begin there,
together.

#### Incremental Court action is key to restrain the executive from doing bad things

**Kent 18** (Andrew Kent, Professor of Law at Fordham University School
of Law, former Senior Counsel to the Solicitor General in the State of
New York's Office of the Attorney General, former Climenko Fellow at
Harvard Law School, holds a J.D. from Yale Law School, 2018, "Don't
Forget Congress When Assigning Blame: Thoughts on Trump v. Hawaii,"
*Harvard Law Review Blog*, June 27^th^, Available Online at
<https://blog.harvardlawreview.org/dont-forget-congress-when-assigning-blame-thoughts-on-trump-v-hawaii/>,
Accessed 09-30-2018)

So [let's not forget **Congress** when assigning blame]{.underline}.
Starting in the twentieth century, and increasing during the pressures
of the Cold War and then the war on terror, [Congress has enacted in the
national security and foreign affairs area]{.underline} "[a scheme of
extraordinarily open-ended legislative delegation]{.underline} that
probably [exceeds any other area of American governance]{.underline}."
[The section of the I]{.underline}mmigration and
[N]{.underline}ationality [A]{.underline}ct [which authorized the travel
ban was enacted in 1952]{.underline}. Other extremely broad delegations
of authority to the President include the 1977 International Economic
Emergency Powers Act, the "vague" and "far-reaching" terms of which have
authorized a vast range of presidential actions; the post-9/11
Authorization for the Use of Military Force, which has been stretched by
three Presidents to justify wide-ranging counter-terrorism activity
around the globe and at home; and the Trade Expansion Act of 1962 and
Trade Act of 1974 which authorize the executive to raise or lower
tariffs on imports for undefined national security reasons---power that
the Trump administration just deployed against Canada and other
countries.

[A President like Trump, armed with the extremely powerful tools
Congress has given him, cannot be effectively restrained **without the
active participation of Congress**. When motivated to do so, Congress
**can** act to either **pull back delegated authorities** or **constrain
their uses**. One example is the Countering America's Adversaries
Through Sanctions Act, passed in]{.underline} the summer of [2017 with
bipartisan, veto-proof margins, which]{.underline}, among other things,
[made it very difficult for the President to relax sanctions and fail to
impose additional sanctions on Russia]{.underline}.

But Congress will probably maintain its practice of very broad
delegations. The reasons why Congress delegates so much to the President
in the foreign affairs and national security area are well known and
generally reasonable. They include the difficulty of predicting in
advance what foreign actors will do and how it would be best for the
United States to respond; the perceived dangerousness of modern foreign
adversaries and their destructive capabilities; the President's greater
access to information about the state of the world; and the structural
unity of the executive branch which allows it to deliberate more
secretly and act more quickly and decisively.

[One takeaway from]{.underline} the Court's decision in [Trump v. Hawaii
is that **Congress could and should consider ways to better cabin and
channel delegated power**]{.underline}. Legislative vetoes are not
available, but [Congress has many]{.underline} other
[tools]{.underline}---[such as requirements of more specific findings
before delegated power can be exercised, sunset provisions to force
reconsideration of delegations, active oversight of how delegated
authority is used, using the Senate's appointments check to push for
reasonable and competent nominees to lead executive departments and
agencies, and withholding funding for problematic uses of delegated

**Malawer 17** (Stuart S. Malawer, the Distinguished Service Professor
of Law and International Trade at George Mason University's Schar School
of Policy and Government, 6/17/17, "Stuart S. Malawer: Trump\'s foreign
policy and the new federalism,"

A new aggressive and proactive federalism seems to be evolving in the
United States.

[This [new]{.mark}er [federalism promotes global engagement and
observation of international rules. This is remarkably different from
the older version that supported states' rights and segregation and was
primarily based in the South.]{.mark}]{.underline}

Today, we see a rapidly evolving anti-Trump resistance in the widespread
movement for "sanctuary cities" and the more recent "city-state climate
coalition." Virginia is one of the most recent members of that
coalition.

These local actions by cities and states are in opposition to President
Trump's national policies relating to immigration enforcement, the
rejection of the Paris Climate Accord, and a general contempt for a
rules-based international order.

In particular, these policies relate to trade, climate change,
immigration, multilateral alliances, and almost any international
agreement that restricts the United States from taking unilateral
actions. These historical changes have occurred under the claim by
President Trump of protecting the United States and its national
sovereignty.

What else can be said?

This incipient development on city and state levels results from
President Trump's isolationist retreat from America's engagement in the
global system. This engagement has been a hallmark of U.S. foreign
policy since before 1945. This incomprehensible retreat by the world's
most powerful nation has seemingly been done with little thought and
even less collaboration with Trump's key national security, military,
and foreign policy advisers. Some advisers, however, have seemingly
betrayed their own competence by recently declaring there is no longer a
global community.

This atavistic retreat to isolationism is a rejection of the rules and
institutions that have marked U.S. engagement in international relations
since the end of World War II. That engagement had its earlier grounding
in the United States' participation in World War I and then in the 1930s
under President Roosevelt's Open Door Policy and his revamping of U.S.
trade policies under Secretary of State Cordell Hull.

\*\*\*

**Those policies** espoused open trade, adhering to the
most-favored-nation principle as a life-saving antidote to the
competitive tariff hikes globally, which had led to the Great
Depression. That principle was later multilateralised in the post-war
international economic system. This system persists today, but it is
under attack by the Trump administration. Most recently, this is seen in
its refusal to sign the historic OECD treaty on multinational tax
avoidance and bilateral tax treaties signed by 70 other countries
recently.

With only a slight knowledge of U.S. diplomatic history, one can draw a
straight line from President Woodrow Wilson's plea to Congress to stay
involved in the global system after the Great War (only to see the
League of Nations, the Permanent Court of International Justice, and the
Versailles Treaty defeated in the U.S. Senate) to President Trump's
nihilistic foreign policies today. Of course, nothing good came from the
failure of President Wilson's efforts. Twenty years later, German troops
marched across Europe.

The resurgence of the states' and cities' roles in foreign affairs is
reminiscent of the role states had under the Articles of Confederation
immediately after the Revolutionary War in the 1780s. This is seen even
going back to the Middle Ages, when states and cities were the central
players in international trade, as part of the Hanseatic League within
the Holy Roman Empire.

Today, it is the global city and cities of all sorts that are powering
international engagement, innovation, and economic development. Cities,
counties, and states are taking the lead in interfacing with the global
economic system to promote local economic development and jobs.

\*\*\*\*\*\*

**What we see** today are unprecedented actions by the United States on
the global stage causing more disorder and insecurity. Just witness the
recent flare-up in relations with Qatar and growing Saudi-Iranian
hostilities instigated by President Trump's visit to Saudi Arabia. To
many, these actions and policies evidence failed national leadership and
bizarre foreign policies.

[[We are now encountering unprecedented actions on the sub-national
level, among city and state governments as a reaction to failed national
governance and as blowback to skewed populism]{.mark}. These actions
have been powered by extensive and broad-based individual and corporate
support.]{.underline}

These activities are growing in intensity. For example, state attorneys
general have been energized in bringing judicial challenges to Trump's
policies, most notably to immigration. Canada has begun negotiating
directly with the states and cities that are members of the new climate
coalition. Cities and states are expanding their sister-city and
sister-state relations abroad. Most recently Virginia, completed a
memorandum of understanding with the Mexican state of Baja California to
promote trade.

Whether the Trump administration and its Justice Department will attempt
to block these grassroots political actions by resorting to the federal
courts is another question. Of course, these courts have not been very
favorable to the administration's actions and its reliance on national
security and the president's foreign policy powers, under either the
principles of the separation of powers or federalism.

Thus, the growing opposition of cities and states to President Trump's
failed foreign policies are spawning a new proactive federalism focusing
on locally generated foreign policies. [[This is setting up a legally
and politically historic battle over the new
federalism.]{.underline}]{.mark}

## Executive Power DA

### 2AC- Executive Power DA

#### Non-Unique: Congressional authority in arms sales is being reasserted now -- bipartisan resolutions aim to curtail executive authority 

**Bowman, 6/10/19**

\[Bryan, Globe Post Journalist and UMass journalism grad, The Globe
Post, "Congress Sets Sights on Arms Sales in Latest Challenge to Trump's
Saudi Policy",
https://theglobepost.com/2019/06/10/congress-saudi-arms-sales/\]

In the latest Congressional attempt to check President Donald Trump's
foreign policy powers, [a bipartisan duo in the Senate introduced a
resolution on Monday that will force a vote on weapons sales to Saudi
Arabia and the broader U.S. relationship with the Kingdom]{.underline}.
Democrat Chris Murphy and Republican Todd Young introduced a [joint
resolution that, if passed, would force Secretary of State Mike Pompeo
to produce a report on Saudi Arabia's human rights record before
proposed arms sales can be finalized. Last week, the Trump
administration angered lawmakers from both parties by attempting to
sidestep Congress and approve \$8.1 billion in weapons sales to Saudi
Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, and Jordan citing the president's
"emergency" powers]{.underline}. In response, a [bipartisan group of
Senators led by Foreign Relations Committee Chairman Bob Menendez
proposed 22 separate Joint Resolutions of Disapproval in an effort to
block each unauthorized weapons sale]{.underline}. Murphy and Young's
resolution is based on a clause in the [Foreign Assistance Act, which
grants Congress the right to demand information on the human rights
records of countries that will be recipients of Americans weapons**.
"[The process we are setting in motion will allow Congress to weigh in
on the totality of our security relationship with Saudi Arabia, not just
one arms sale, and restore Congress's role in foreign
policy-makin]{.mark}g**]{.underline}," Murphy said in a statement. The
Foreign Assistance Act stipulates that the administration must provide
Congress a report within 30 days and that Congress can then vote to
terminate or restrict all pending or future assistance to the country.
Citing the supposed "malign influence" of Iran in the Middle East, the
Trump administration attempted to expedite the arms sales and bypass
Congress by invoking an emergency loophole in the Arms Export Control
Act. Reasserting War Powers But particularly following the murder of
Washington Post journalist and U.S. resident Jamal Khashoggi inside a
Saudi consulate in Turkey in October, [many representatives from both
parties have conveyed a desire to reassert Congress' role in foreign
policy decision making, particularly on matters related to Saudi
Arabia.]{.underline} While Trump condemned the killing -- reportedly
ordered by Saudi Crown Prince Mohammad bin Salman -- he specifically
cited weapons sales to the Kingdom as a reason his administration
declined to take punitive action. Members of Congress, including many
from Trump's own party, directly challenged the administration's
approach, arguing the assassination was a brazen and unacceptable move
that must not go unpunished. "If you give this guy a pass after he
disrespected you, you will look weak," Republican Senator Lindsey
Graham, who also called the crown prince "nuts," told Trump in November.
[In a historic moment in April, Congress passed a War Powers Resolution
with bipartisan support directing the administration to end its military
support for a Saudi-lead coalition waging a war in Yemen. The passage of
the resolution marked the first time Congress had ever invoked the 1973
War Powers Act in an effort to end U.S. military participation in an
unauthorized war.]{.underline} Though the resolution was vetoed by
Trump, the bill's Senate sponsor Bernie [Sanders said [the vote was a
**"historic" step in a broader effort to "reassert the constitutional
authority of the United States Congress on issues of
war**]{.mark}.]{.underline}" [In a statement on his newly proposed
resolution, Young cited the dire humanitarian situation in Yemen --
considered to be the worst in the world by the United Nations -- as a
reason why Congress must provide oversight on weapons sales to Saudi
Arabia.]{.underline} "The ongoing humanitarian crisis and complicated
security environment in Yemen requires our sustained attention and we
cannot permit U.S. military equipment to worsen the situation on the
ground," he said. The U.S. has played a key role in supporting the
Saudi-coalition, which has been accused of indiscriminately bombing
civilian homes and infrastructure with American-made weapons systems.
Murphy and Young's resolution is "privileged," meaning the
representatives can force a vote on it in both chambers of Congress
after ten days.

Fourth, Congress has only its specifically enumerated powers in foreign
affairs, but these include a power to legislate in support of the
President. [A textual approach compels the conclusion that Congress has
only the powers granted to it by the text.96 No provisions in Article I,
Section 8 (the relevant text), either considered individually or taken
together, amount to a comprehensive congressional authority over foreign
affairs]{.underline}. But Congress has two important sources of
lawmaking authority that, taken together, almost add up to a general
power.97 [[Congress, of course, enjoys explicit legislative powers in
particular areas of foreign affairs, such as the power to regulate
foreign commerce, declare war, etc]{.underline}]{.mark}., plus the power
to make laws \"necessary and proper\" to effectuate these powers.98 From
our second and third principles, it should be clear that **[[these are
independent powers of Congress, which can be exercised despite
presidential opposition.]{.underline}]{.mark}** 9 [In addition, Congress
also may invoke the Necessary and Proper Clause to carry into execution
the powers granted to the President by the Constitution.]{.underline}
From our first principle, this includes the power to carry into
execution the President\'s residual foreign affairs powers. Thus
Congress has the general power to legislate in support of the
President\'s foreign policy goals. But this general power-unlike
Congress\'s specifically enumerated powers-is subject to a key
limitation. Since it is derivative of the President\'s power, it must be
exercised in coordination with, and not in opposition to, the President.
°° As a result the Constitution achieves a complex series of interbranch
checks in foreign affairs. The President has a residual executive power,
which means that only the President can speak for the United States on
the international stage and can formulate foreign policy (narrowly
understood).\' 0\' At the same time, [[the President must rely on
Congress (or two-thirds of the Senate) to give foreign policy any
domestic legal effect]{.underline}]{.mark}. **[Congress can pursue
foreign affairs goals independently from the President through
legislation in areas where it has a specifically enumerated power, such
as foreign commerce]{.mark}**. **[In other areas, where Congress has
only derivative power, it can act to support the President (or it can
refuse to act), but it cannot pursue independent
objectives.]{.underline}** No single branch, acting alone, has complete
control over the course of U.S. foreign affairs.

#### **The aff only decreases executive [foreign commerce powers]{.underline}**

law and was a prolific scholar and teacher in the fields of

Emphasis on the President\'s power to formulate foreign policy, with its
roots in his control of foreign relations, should not depre- ciate the
part which Congress continues to have in the formulation of foreign
policy. [Congress formulates major foreign policy by legis- lation
regulating commerce with foreign nations or authorizing in- ternational
trade agreements]{.underline}.2\' The Foreign Commerce Power has grown
enormously on the wings of the Interstate Commerce Power so that
Congress now has nearly-unlimited power to regulate any- thing that is,
is in, or affects, either interstate or foreign commerce. Congress, and
Congress alone, also has the power to make the na- tional policy to go
to war or to stay at peace; it has determined United States neutrality
in the wars of others. The War Powers of Congress include the power to
legislate and spend as necessary to wage war successfully; to prepare
for, deter, or defend against war; and to deal with the consequences of
war. Under the \"general wel- fare\" clause, Congress can decide where,
for what, how much, and on what conditions to spend, as in foreign aid.
There are implica- tions for foreign policy when Congress establishes
and regulates the Foreign Service and the bureaucracies of various
departments and agencies dealing with foreign affairs. The innumerable
uses of the \"necessary and proper\" clause include many that
\"formulate for- eign policy.\" Since foreign policy and foreign
relations require money, which only Congress can appropriate,\"
**[[Congress has some voice in all foreign policy through the
appropriations process, al- though Congress would probably not be
constitutionally justified in refusing to support policies which are
within the President\'s power to make.]{.underline}]{.mark}**
[[Congress]{.mark}\']{.underline} unenumerated power to legislate on all
matters relating to \"nationhood\" and foreign affairs may reach far
beyond regulation of immigration, nationality, and diplomacy. It
[[includes]{.underline}]{.mark}, apparently, [[the power to join the

[Experts]{.underline} in Congress and foreign policy [say it's been
decades since Congress exercised in]{.underline} any meaningful way its
role in setting and [overseeing US foreign policy.]{.underline} Writing
in the February 2017 issue of Foreign Affairs magazine, Stephen
Weissman, a former staff director of the House Subcommittee on Africa,
noted that [Congress experienced]{.underline} something of [a golden era
in "playing a constructive role in matters of war and peace" from the
late 1960s to the early 1990s.]{.underline} "Congress weighed in
responsibly on conflicts in Southeast Asia, Central America, the Middle
East, and southern Africa," he said, sometimes blocking "arguably
misguided action on the part of the executive branch," while at other
times "partnering" with the executive to "improve outcomes." [But
[Congress "started backsliding in the early 1990s" when President Bill
Clinton sent forces to Haiti, Bosnia, and Kosovo without congressional
authorization]{.mark}]{.underline}[,]{.mark} Mr. Weissman wrote. [By the
aftermath of the 9/11 attacks it was total abdication]{.underline}, he
added, noting how Congress set off a new round of executive-branch
foreign interventions by the "rushed" 2002 authorization of the use of
force in Iraq by President George W. Bush. Now [some foreign policy
analysts say the Khashoggi affair may portend some limited revival of
congressional involvement in foreign policy -- but they aren't holding
their breath for much beyond some impact on the Yemen war]{.underline}
and relations with Saudi Arabia generally. "[The two areas where a
Democratic House with cooperation from a Republican Senate might be able
to constrain administration policy is on Saudi Arabia and the war in
Yemen]{.underline}," says Aaron David Miller, a Middle East analyst at
the Wilson Center in Washington with long experience in administrations
of both parties. "[But [a higher profile for the Congress on a couple of
specific issues will not necessarily translate to activism and impact
across the full spectrum of our foreign policy]{.mark}]{.underline}," he
says, "so the real question is going to be if Congress can act in ways
to affect policy. And that," he adds, "will require the Senate."

#### The thesis of the aff disproves the DA---secrecy in foreign policy causes disastrous errors. 

**Pallitto 06 (**12/6/2006, Robert Pallitto, University of Texas at El
Paso Political Science Professor, "Secrecy and Foreign Policy," Foreign
Policy in Focus, <https://fpif.org/secrecy_and_foreign_policy/>)

[The imperial presidency has thrived on secrecy. [This unconstitutional
expansion of presidential power has helped make a mess of U.S. foreign
policy]{.mark}]{.underline}. Since the beginning of the republic, U.S.
presidents have used some form of secrecy in the course of governing. In
the wake of the Watergate scandal, congressional hearings in the 1970s
and the disclosure of covert U.S. programs of assassination and
destabilization overseas temporarily reduced the scope of secret
activities sponsored by the executive branch. [From the 1980s
on]{.underline}, however, [presidents have come to rely increasingly on
secrecy-related practices]{.underline}. Though the U.S. Constitution
does not explicitly grant executive secrecy in the list of Article II
powers, [presidents have increased their powers through legislation, the
federal courts' recognition of legal defenses to conceal information,
and responses to the ongoing threat of terrorism.]{.underline}
[The]{.underline} George W. [Bush administration has shown an even
greater commitment to secrecy than its predecessors]{.underline}. Having
made secrecy its watchword, this administration relies on the arsenal of
useful techniques already available even as it seeks to expand their
scope and number. Moreover, [secrecy practices are not limited to the
domestic policy realm; they extend into foreign policy as
well.]{.underline} In fact, [the claim to using them is sometimes made
even more strongly in the foreign policy context]{.underline}. [The Bush
administration's encroachment on the foreign policy responsibilities of
Congress has further limited the checks-and-balances that prevent the
secret misuse of power.]{.underline} Indeed, secrecy and expanding
executive power have gone hand in hand. But the imperial presidency's
use of secrecy to push a particular foreign policy agenda can be
reversed if Congress and the federal courts are willing to act. Court
decisions and congressional oversight---through funding, investigative,
and legislative action---would apply an overdue brake on excessive
presidential secrecy. Tools of Secrecy Secrecy enables power, and this
is particularly true of the activities of the executive branch. [The
executive is far freer to act if its actions never come to light. Formal
and informal constraints by the coordinate branches and the public
cannot be exercised against actions taken in secret. On foreign policy,
presidents have used this increasingly unchecked power of secrecy over
the years to facilitate the gathering of intelligence, to protect that
information, and, more recently, to fight terrorism.]{.underline} Since
1978, for instance, presidents have had available to them a legalized
procedure for conducting surveillance of suspected foreign agents. The
Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA), passed that year, sets
requirements for obtaining permission to conduct intelligence-gathering
surveillance. While this law checked executive power by obligating the
executive to follow strict procedures in wiretapping activities, the
legality of presidentially-ordered wiretaps prior to 1978 was, in fact,
questionable. Thus, FISA made the practice clearly legal for the first
time, effectively throwing a cloak of statutory protection around any
wiretapping the executive wishes to conduct. Moreover, FISA requests are
virtually never denied, so that the executive can be confident, in
making a request, that surveillance will be authorized. [The state
secrets privilege]{.underline} is another means by which the executive
can shield its activities from public or governmental view. Established
by the Supreme Court in 1953 in U.S. v. Reynolds, it [has been used to
protect information related to national security.]{.underline} [When a
party in litigation or in a congressional investigation seeks the
release of such information, the executive can invoke the state secrets
privilege and effectively end the case]{.underline}. Normally, [no one
gets to review the allegedly secret materials when this privilege is
invoked]{.underline}---not the court, and not the litigant requesting
the information. The laws and policies enacted post-9/11 to fight
terror, such as t[he PATRIOT Act, the Homeland Security Act, and the
order creating military commissions to try suspected
terrorists]{.underline}, also [provide the executive with greater
secrecy capabilities]{.underline}. Whether or not [these
laws]{.underline} are in fact the best way to approach the threat of
terror attacks, they certainly [increase executive power and restrict
civil liberties. These measures shield immigration hearings from public
view, expand access to private records, and authorize secret searches
and secret detentions. One of the most striking examples]{.underline} of
these anti-terror practices [is]{.underline} the interpretation and use
of [the "material witness statute,"]{.underline} an earlier law that
allowed detention of witnesses in criminal cases. [To ensure the
availability of a key witness]{.underline} to testify in an ongoing
criminal case, [the government could sometimes detain that person until
the date of her trial testimony]{.underline}. Controversial from the
beginning, the law signaled a departure from established criminal
procedure, since normally, confinement is only permitted when a
defendant faces trial or receives a sentence upon conviction. According
to the statute, however, witnesses could be confined for the sole
purpose of ensuring their testimony. These earlier objections seem
minor, though, when compared to the concerns provoked by the expanded
use of "material witness" detention by the Bush administration. In 2001,
then Attorney General John Ashcroft
[warned](http://www.usdoj.gov/ag/speeches/2001/agcrisisremarks.10_31.htm)
that "aggressive detention of lawbreakers and material witnesses is
vital to preventing, disrupting, and delaying of new attacks." In that
vein, he began using material witness detention far more broadly to
detain, secretly, individuals who might have information that could be
used in future, yet-to-be-filed criminal cases. Thus, material witness
detention grew from an occasional practice of confinement in pending
cases to a potentially unlimited means to accomplish extrajudicial
detentions. Even more ominously, as Laurie Levenson argues, "material
witness" became "a temporary moniker to identify an individual who will
soon bear the status of
defendant."[1](https://fpif.org/secrecy_and_foreign_policy/#_ftn1)
Accusations of [the "extraordinary
rendition"](http://www.blackwell-synergy.com/doi/pdf/10.1111/j.1741-5705.2006.00290.x)
of alleged terror suspects to torturers abroad, the Bush
administration's admission that it uses [secret detention
facilities](http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/nationworld/chi-0609070159sep07,1,5717693.story%20-%3e)
around the world as part of its "war on terror," and the controversy
over [treatment of detainees in Guantanamo Bay and Iraqi
prisons](http://www.newyorker.com/fact/content/articles/040510fa_fact?040510fa_fact)
have all intensified debate over secrecy practices related to detention.
[Taken together]{.underline}, all of the practices described
above---[intelligence surveillance, state secrets protective claims,
anti-terror laws]{.underline}, and others---[equip the executive with a
vast, almost unreviewable power to operate in numerous areas of
policymaking and execution]{.underline}. Foreign Policy Context [In some
instances, domestic policies regarding law enforcement and internal
security matters have a foreign policy component]{.underline}. The round
up of foreign nationals for questioning and the rendition of non-U.S.
citizens to home countries or third-party nations, for example, display
a foreign policy aspect even though they originate domestically with the
actions of internal governmental agencies such as Immigration and
Customs Enforcement. Thus, [they can be viewed both as foreign policy
and domestic policy as a result of the]{.underline} undeniable
[overlap]{.underline} of these policy domains. Often however, [the
administration has treated these matters as foreign policy. This
distinction is significant because]{.underline} some [proponents of
executive power claim that foreign policy is essentially off-limits to
the other branches]{.underline}. Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas,
for example, has said repeatedly that the Court lacks the expertise, as
well as the legal authority, to evaluate presidential foreign policy
decisions, even when those decisions involve the application of
constitutional civil liberties standards. The Bush administration's
extension of secrecy to foreign policy matters has many troubling
dimensions. The controversy over the 9/11 terror attacks has generated
numerous lawsuits, including the ones brought by victims' families
against the Saudi government for alleged Saudi complicity in the 9/11
terrorists' plans. In Burnett v. Al Baraka Investment Corp., the United
States asserted that information sought by the plaintiffs to prove their
case---evidence of U.S. foreknowledge of the 9/11 attacks---was national
security-related and therefore protected from disclosure by the state
secrets privilege. Similarly, in Arar v. Ashcroft, the government
asserted the state secrets privilege in response to a suit by [Maher
Arar](http://fpif.org/fpiftxt/3636), a Canadian citizen who alleges he
was seized by U.S. officials at Kennedy Airport as he passed through the
United States en route to Jordan. He relates that he was flown to Syria,
where he spent a year in confinement, suffering ongoing torture. Arar
sued the U.S. government under the Torture Victim Protection Act, but
his suit was dismissed. The U.S. District Court in New York suggested
that the matter involved U.S.-Canadian coordination in the war on
terror, and that if those activities were brought to light, the
executive might be impeded in its diplomatic efforts with Canada. Once
again, [legal claims by a private individual ran up against the
government's assertion of a secrecy interest based in national
security]{.underline}. There is a role for secrecy in foreign affairs.
However, [[existing legal doctrines, and presidential actions based on
them, have created a dangerously expanded executive power that uses
secrecy to shield itself from oversight]{.mark}.]{.underline} Congress
has authorized some of these practices by passing the PATRIOT Act and
other legislation. [The]{.underline} federal [courts,]{.underline}
including the Supreme Court, [have often refused to scrutinize executive
actions that implicate foreign policy or national security]{.underline}.
But what theory of presidential power would justify such deference by
the other branches? Unlimited Presidential Power? Not surprisingly, the
Bush administration has sought to provide a foundation in constitutional
law for its expansive, secrecy-related approach to foreign policy.
Administration lawyer John Yoo drafted a [**Error! Hyperlink reference
not valid.**](http://%20/www.usdoj.gov/olc/warpowers925.htm) in 2001
asserting vast war-making powers in the executive. And in 2006 Attorney
General Gonzales spoke of inherent constitutional authority as authority
for the warrantless eavesdropping that became public that year. The
eminent constitutional scholar Louis Fisher groups these arguments under
the heading of the "sole organ" doctrine, which he
[attributes](http://www.fas.org/sgp/eprint/fisher.pdf) to a misreading
of earlier statements in court and legislative records. In fact, as
Fisher shows, [there is no real authority for the claim of inherent,
unreviewable foreign policy power in the executive.]{.underline} Earlier
commentators emphasized the distinction between making and executing
foreign policy---and noted that the president may do only the latter,
while the former is the province of Congress. Legal rules originating in
court decisions are passed down through subsequent decisions, and they
derive their force from both verdicts in successive cases and the
validity of their original enactment by the courts adopting them for the
first time. Fisher shows that neither of these sources of authority is
available to proponents of the "sole organ" doctrine. The original
pronouncement was not, as some have argued, an endorsement of unlimited
presidential power in foreign relations, nor have subsequent courts
adopted such a view. The Curtiss-Wright case from the 1930s contains
some language in dicta indicating that Justice Sutherland held the view
that presidential power in foreign policy was immune from oversight. But
as dicta---the judge's editorializing---those comments are not part of
the ruling in the case. Thus, the "sole organ" doctrine is not part of
our constitutional jurisprudence concerning presidential power.
Congressional legislation in a particular policy domain also limits
presidential power, regardless of whether the subject matter of the
legislation is foreign or domestic affairs. In the historic "steel
seizure case," President Truman seized privately-owned steel mills to
aid the war effort in Korea. In the resulting litigation, the Supreme
Court announced a three-part test for adjudicating conflicts between
congressional and presidential power. Where Congress has authorized
presidential action, executive power is strongest, and where Congress is
silent on presidential action, the executive has a moderate claim.
However, where Congress explicitly claims power to act for itself,
executive power is at its "lowest ebb." Significantly in several
currently controversial areas, congressional action expressly limits
presidential power. In the foreign intelligence context, and with regard
to the prohibition of torture as well, Congress has spoken, and
therefore the scope of executive action is diminished. Thus, the
established judicial test first announced in the Youngstown case exerts
a separate limitation on the foreign policy powers of the executive.
Restoring Rule of Law [Given the concentration and abuse of power made
possible in part by the administration's use of secrecy, now is not the
time to adopt an expansive conception of presidential power. The
administration urged that]{.underline} expansive [view during
the]{.underline} National Security Agency [(NSA) eavesdropping
controversy]{.underline}, which became public knowledge three years
after the eavesdropping actually started. When Congress and the public
wanted to know why the president bypassed the FISA statute (designed
precisely to regulate presidentially-ordered surveillance) in the course
of its eavesdropping, [the administration responded that it did not need
to consult Congress or follow FISA in the matter.]{.underline} The
proffered defenses of secrecy converge with arguments for executive
supremacy in foreign policymaking, and these two types of claims are
mutually reinforcing. [Supremacy facilitates secrecy, and secrecy
facilitates supremacy]{.underline}. Nonetheless, [[there are strong
reasons not to acquiesce. The practice of constitutional interpretation
supports neither the "sole organ" doctrine nor the vast presidential
secrecy practiced by the Bush administration]{.mark}. They both threaten
the balance of powers when they are employed.]{.underline}
Already-existing checks and balances can be used to reverse the trend of
growing secrecy and its dangerous implications for foreign policy. Most
of the powers described above are statutory: they were given by
congressional act, and they can be withdrawn the same way. Congress
re-authorized the PATRIOT Act last spring, but they could act just as
easily to pass legislation restraining executive secrecy. The federal
courts could also overturn statutory provisions by invoking the
Constitution through the process of judicial review. Interestingly, the
Bush administration's frequent use of the state secrets privilege has
given courts more exposure to the doctrine, and consequently a more
developed state secrets jurisprudence is emerging, especially in the
wake of 9/11. The doctrine was court-created to begin with, and as
courts perform their institutional role of resolving disputes, there is
an opportunity to make it less one-sidedly favorable to the executive.
The question, of course, is whether the courts and Congress will see the
danger and find the will to act.

Strategy," Texas National Security Review, Vol 2, Issue 1, January 2019,

The nuclear-revolution school argues that [the bomb severely constrains
and limits]{.underline} [--- and at times eliminates --- the
grand-strategic choices that were available to states and statesmen in
the past]{.underline}. Robert Jervis, the leading thinker in the
nuclear-revolution school, has argued that "\[f\]orce and the threat of
it cannot support foreign policy in the same way that it did in the
past."3 Historian Lawrence Freedman agrees, suggesting that the notion
of a nuclear strategy "is a contradiction in terms." What is the
"nuclear revolution" framework, and what predictions and explanations
does it offer? While scholars differ on some aspects, Stephen Walt has
nicely defined its broad outlines: As refined by scholars like
\[Bernard\] Brodie, Thomas Schelling, Glenn Snyder, Robert Jervis,
Kenneth Waltz, and Stephen Van Evera, [nuclear weapons are said to
provide states with the ability to protect their sovereignty and
independence not via direct defense but rather through
deterrence]{.underline}. According to the "logic of the 'nuclear
revolution,' therefore, [states with second-strike capabilities were
secure against attack and didn't need to worry]{.underline} very much
[about]{.underline} their [sovereignty or independence]{.underline}."
The nuclear revolution "means that '[nuclear superiority' was a
meaningless concept. ... A handful of survivable weapons makes it very
unlikely that another state will attack you directly]{.underline} or try
to invade and take over your country." According to Jervis, the leading
scholar in this tradition, [nuclear weapons "can kill but not
influence." Nuclear weapons even "eliminate the security
dilemma]{.underline}," the phenomena that many scholars believe drove
international conflict for centuries, making cooperation among states
more likely. [Nor can they be used for much else besides
deterrence]{.underline}. As Todd Sechser and Matthew Fuhrmann argue in a
recent study, "For all the money spent on atomic bombs, they have bought
precious little coercive leverage for states." [The nuclear revolution
should have had important consequences for proliferation dynamics,
nonproliferation policies, and alliances]{.underline}. Joshua Rovner
explains that according to the nuclear-revolution view, "if nuclear
weapons were great for deterrence but lousy for battle, then Washington
should have been sanguine as new countries went nuclear. It might even
have been optimistic, since proliferation would, under this theory, lead
countries to become cautious." [[Even if the United States wanted to
stem the spread of nuclear weapons, however, the effort would be
futile]{.underline}]{.mark}. According to Kenneth Waltz, ["\[I\]f
countries feel insecure and believe that nuclear weapons would make them
more secure, America's policy of opposing the spread of nuclear weapons
will not prevail]{.underline}." Waltz, the most influential
international relations theorist of modern times and one of the more
extreme advocates of the nuclear-revolution framework, went further
still, arguing that nuclear weapons "make alliances obsolete." The mere
presence of the bomb would override the grand-strategic choices made by
a particular state or leader. "[Nuclear weapons can carry out their
deterrent task no matter what other countries do]{.underline}." The key
insight of this framework is that [the bomb is a defensive weapon of
such powerful force that it transforms strategy and
statecraft]{.underline}, constraining the grand-strategic options
available to states and leaders before the nuclear age, regardless of a
state's history, geography, culture, or regime type. According to Waltz,
"[American estimates of what is required for deterrence were absurdly
high." In other words, "not much is required to deter]{.underline}."
Summing up the conventional wisdom among scholars in this tradition,
Charles Glaser and Chaim Kauffman argue that the nuclear revolution
reveals that "[this technology so heavily favors defense that when all
the major powers have nuclear weapons variation in other factors becomes
relatively unimportant]{.underline}." According to Stephen Van Evera,
"the nuclear revolution gave defenders a large military advantage," so
large that conquest "became virtually impossible." John Mearsheimer
similarly concludes that "[there is no question ... [the presence of
nuclear weapons makes states more cautious about using military force of
any kind against each other]{.mark}]{.underline}." How well did the
theory of the nuclear revolution do in predicting American nuclear
weapons policy and explaining the role of the bomb in U.S. grand
strategy? The framework's key point --- that nuclear weapons made total,
thermonuclear war a horrifying absurdity to be avoided at all costs ---
is of course a profound insight. As the historian John Lewis Gaddis
argued during the Cold War, "[It seems inescapable that what has really
made a difference in inducing this unaccustomed caution has been the
workings of the nuclear deterrent."]{.underline}

#### No rogue nations impact\-\--problems are [regional]{.underline}, NOT [global]{.underline}. 

**Patrick 5/2011** (Stewart Patrick, Council on Foreign Relations James
H. Binger senior fellow in global governance and International
Institutions and Global Governance director, *Weak Links: Fragile
States, Global Threats, and International Security*, Abstract,
<https://www.oxfordscholarship.com/view/10.1093/acprof:oso/9780199751501.001.0001/acprof-9780199751501>)

[Conventional wisdom]{.underline} among policymakers in both the US and
[Europe holds that weak and failing states are the source of the
world\'s most pressing security threats today. The international
community\'s leadership sees such states as an existential
threat]{.underline} as well, evidenced in Kofi Annan\'s 2004 claim that
"our defenses are only as strong as their weakest links." This is not
surprising. The most destructive attack on the US in its history
originated in one of the world\'s poorest countries. Deadly communicable
diseases seem to constantly emerge from the world\'s poorest regions,
and transnational crime appears to flourish in weakly governed states.
However, as this book shows, [our [assumptions about the threats posed
by failed and failing states are based on anecdotal arguments]{.mark},
not on a systematic empirical analysis that traces the connections
between state failure and transnational security threats.]{.underline}
This book uses an Index of State Weakness as a basis for its findings.
[The book provides coverage of five key security threats: terrorism,
transnational crime, WMDs, pandemic diseases, and energy insecurity. The
basic conclusions may seem surprising. While many threats do emerge in
failed states, more often than not those states\' manifold weaknesses
create misery for only their own citizenry]{.underline}. In other words,
[the problems that flow from Liberia\'s failures are more typical than
those that spread from Afghanistan]{.underline}. Moreover, [many of
threats originate farther up the chain, in wealthier and more stable
countries like Russia, China]{.underline}, and Venezuela. And [[generic
state weakness is not a good threat predictor.]{.mark} Cultural and
regional particularities as well as the degree of global integration all
influence the threat level]{.underline}. Just as importantly, our
tendency to extrapolate an all-encompassing theory connecting weak
states and international security threats from turmoil in the Middle
East and Southwest Asia is insufficient. The book argues for complexity
and nuance, and will force policymakers to rethink what they assume
about state failure and transnational insecurity.

#### Absolutely zero threat from terrorists

The [reaction to 9/11 led]{.underline} not only to definitional mischief
but also [to the exaggeration of terrorist capacities.]{.underline} In
2009, for example, [the US Department of Homeland Security (DHS) issued
a lengthy report]{.underline} on protecting the United States. Key to
achieving such an objective, it would seem, should be a careful
assessment of the character, capacities, and desires of potential ter-
rorists targeting that homeland. [The report does contain a section
dealing with what its authors call "the nature of the terrorist
adversary." However, it devotes only two paragraphs to this important
concern, and both are decidedly one-dimensional and fully preoccupied
with the dire end of the spectrum of the terrorist threat.]{.underline}
Within that section, [it devotes but two sentences to an assessment of
the actual nature of the "adversary" it is so concerned
about]{.underline}: "The number and high profile of international and
domes- tic terrorist attacks and disrupted plots during the last two
decades under- score the determination and persistence of terrorist
organizations. Terrorists have proven to be relentless, patient,
opportunistic, and flexible, learning from experience and modifying
tactics and targets to exploit perceived vulnerabilities and avoid
observed strengths."34 In stark contrast, when seeking to describe their
subjects, [the authors of a set of case studies of terrorists who have
focused on the United States since 9/11 chiefly apply different
descriptors: incompetent, ineffective, unintelligent, idiotic, ignorant,
inadequate, unorganized, misguided, muddled, amateurish, dopey,
unrealistic, moronic, irrational, foolish, and gullible]{.underline}.35
Brian Jenkins's assessment of domestic terrorists is apt: "[[Their num-
bers remain small, their determination limp, and their competence
poor]{.mark}**.**]{.underline}"36 And Michael Kenney finds that
[would-be [terrorists]{.mark}]{.underline} in Europe and other Western
locations, like their counterparts in the United States, [[tend to be
operationally unsophisticated, short on know-how, prone to make
mistakes, poor at planning, and limited in their capacity to
learn]{.underline}]{.mark}.37 [There have been widespread worries
that]{.underline}, because the 9/11 [terrorists]{.underline} were
successful with box cutters, they [might soon be able to turn out and
detonate nuclear weapons]{.underline}. For example, in 2004, Graham
Allison found a large receptive audience when he alarmingly relayed his
"considered judgement" that "on the current path, a nuclear terrorist
attack on America in the decade ahead is more likely than not."38 [Not
only has such an attack not happened, but it seems clear, in the words
of]{.underline} William [Langewiesche, who has assessed the process in
detail, that no terrorist group "has gotten any- where near
this."]{.underline}39

[Given Congress\' strong textual claims to regulate arms sales, it will

should legislate so as to ensure adequate scope for executive
flexibility while exercising its constitutional right to participate in
decisionmaking.81 [The history of arms sales legislation, as in many
other foreign affairs areas, has been one of successive attempts to
craft statutes that allow for delegation without sacrificing
participation in overall policy formulation]{.underline}

[In general, the executive branch, after complying with the terms of
applicable U.S. law, principally contained in the AECA, is free to
proceed with an arms sales proposal unless Congress passes legislation
prohibiting or modifying the proposed sale. Under current law Congress
faces two fundamental obstacles to block]{.underline} or modify [a
presidential sale of military equipment: it must pass legislation
expressing its will on the sale, and it must be capable of overriding a
presumptive presidential veto of such legislation. Congress, however, is
free to pass legislation to block or modify an arms sale at any time up
to the point of delivery of the items involved.]{.underline} This report
will be updated, if notable changes in these review procedures or
applicable law occur.

#### Under the AECA even post-plan, should congress attempt to limit an arms sale the president can just veto any joint resolution to end arm sales. This makes congressional control of Arm Sales virtually impossible

[The president's authority to engage in arms sales is rooted in statute.
Since at least
[1795](https://www.loc.gov/law/help/statutes-at-large/3rd-congress/session-2/c3s2ch53.pdf),
Congress has permitted the executive branch to transfer or sell arms to
allies to help advance their common defense interests]{.underline}. The
most recent version of this authority is provided by the [Arms Export
Control Act](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/22/chapter-39)
(AECA) in coordination with the related [Foreign Assistance
Act](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/22/chapter-32) (FAA).
Unsurprisingly, however, the modern Congress does not leave U.S. arms
sales entirely up to the president's discretion. Instead, it imposes a
number of conditions on what the president may sell (or permit to be
sold) and how.

Enacted in
[1976](https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/STATUTE-90/pdf/STATUTE-90-Pg729.pdf)
following a [series of arms sales-related
controversies](https://digitalcommons.wcl.american.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?referer=https://www.google.com/&httpsredir=1&article=1654&context=auilr#page=4),
[the AECA was originally intended to promote shared executive branch and
congressional control over arms sales.]{.underline} To accomplish this,
Congress
[amended](https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/STATUTE-90/pdf/STATUTE-90-Pg729.pdf#page=12)
Section 36 of the existing [Foreign Military Sales Act of
1968](https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/STATUTE-82/pdf/STATUTE-82-Pg1320-2.pdf)
to require the president to provide Congress with a "certification" of
any proposed sale of defense articles or services to a foreign
government---or any effort to license a private actor to conduct such a
sale---above a certain threshold in value 30 days before the
finalization of that sale. During the certification period, Congress
could object to the sale through a [concurrent
resolution](https://www.senate.gov/reference/glossary_term/concurrent_resolution.htm)---meaning
a resolution approved by the House and the Senate but not presented to
the president for signature or veto---pursuant to certain expedited
procedures defined in [Section
601](https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/STATUTE-90/pdf/STATUTE-90-Pg729.pdf#page=37)
of the AECA, which makes it possible for a senator to force at least a
procedural vote and ensure that the measure can proceed in a timely
manner so long as it has majority support. Such a resolution would,
under the AECA, prohibit the president from moving forward with the sale
unless he certified to Congress that "an emergency exist\[ed\] which
require\[d\] such sale in the national security interests of the United
States." Functionally, this procedure gave a simple majority in Congress
substantial control over U.S. arms sales.

[But this arrangement was not destined to last]{.underline}. In its 1983
decision in the matter of [INS v.
Chadha](https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=2221871582286121199&q=ins+v.+chadha&hl=en&as_sdt=20006),
[the Supreme Court held that a similar legislative veto provision in a
different statute was unconstitutional]{.underline}, because it evaded
the constitutional requirement that substantive legislation be presented
to the president for a potential veto before having legal effect. This
raised serious doubts as to whether the AECA's various legislative veto
provisions would withstand constitutional scrutiny if challenged in the
courts. In 1986, [Congress responded by
[amending](http://uscode.house.gov/statutes/pl/99/247.pdf) Section 36 to
substitute [joint
resolutions](https://www.senate.gov/reference/glossary_term/joint_resolution.htm)
in place of concurrent resolutions for the statute's legislative veto
provisions, ensuring their constitutionality. But this substantially
weakened congressional control, as the president now had the power to
veto any effort to stop a proposed arms sale.]{.underline}

#### Even right now with Congress more pissed than ever they are not going to be able to put together enough votes to actually stop the president from executing on an arms sale due to provisions in the AECA

If motivated by this latter logic, however, the Trump administration
appears to have miscalculated badly. On June 5, [a bipartisan coalition
of senators
[introduced](https://www.foreign.senate.gov/press/ranking/release/menendez-graham-murphy-paul-leahy-young-reed-announce-22-joint-resolutions-to-block-weapons-sales-to-saudi-arabia-and-uae-without-congressional-approval)
not one but 22]{.underline} [[individual joint resolutions of
disapproval]{.underline}](https://www.congress.gov/search?searchResultViewType=expanded&q=%7B%22source%22%3A%22legislation%22%2C%22search%22%3A%22%5C%22A+joint+resolution+providing+for+congressional+disapproval+of%5C%22%22%2C%22congress%22%3A116%7D),
[one for each]{.underline} DCS and [FMS case covered by Pompeo's
emergency pronouncement]{.underline}. Each resolution is currently
sitting in the Senate foreign relations committee, where chairman (and
Trump ally) James Risch would normally be in a strong position to
prevent them from coming up for a vote. [The expedited procedures
provided for in Section 601 of the AECA,]{.underline} however[, allow a
majority of the Senate to move a joint resolution of disapproval out of
committee, on to the Senate floor, and to a final vote in a manner of
days]{.underline}. (The AECA also
[directs](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/22/2776) the House to
treat any such resolutions as "highly privileged," though moving them
forward is less likely to be an issue there due to Democratic control.)

Notably, there was initially a [parliamentary
question](https://www.rollcall.com/news/congress/bipartisan-senate-group-seek-block-saudi-arms-sales-trump-administration-tries-avoid-congressional-review)
as to whether joint resolutions on arms sales moved forward under the
emergency exception could qualify for the Section 601 expedited
procedures---an ineligibility, perhaps, that the Trump administration
had been relying on. The Senate parliamentarian appears to have resolved
this question in favor of the resolutions' sponsors, as Senate Majority
Leader Mitch McConnell has since
[confirmed](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-06-10/senate-republicans-join-in-rebuke-of-trump-over-saudi-arms-sales)
that a vote to move the resolutions out of committee could take place as
soon as next week. Moreover, unlike concurrent resolutions in the
original AECA, any joint resolutions that are enacted into law through
these procedures will be free-standing legislation with independent
force of law. As a result, the resolutions' directive that each of the
22 specified transactions "is prohibited" should still be binding on the
executive branch.

[That said, it seems unlikely that any of the joint resolutions will
reach this stage]{.underline}. [Given that each is co-sponsored by four
Republican senators, they seem to have the minimum votes necessary to
pass the Senate as well as the Democrat-controlled House. But Trump
is]{.underline} almost [certain to veto them, and it seems unlikely that
two-thirds of both the House and the Senate will support an effort to
override these vetoes.]{.underline} [As a result, the outcome here is
likely to resemble the outcome of the Yemen war powers debate, with
Trump using his veto to continue to pursue his increasingly
unpopular]{.underline} Yemen [policies over bipartisan
objections]{.underline}. But to arrive here, the Trump administration
will have to weather many more rounds of floor debate that will put
bipartisan objections to the president's Yemen policies on full display
and associate his Republican allies with an increasingly unpopular war.
And the numerous vetoes Trump will have to deploy will no doubt make
clear to what extent he is pursuing those policies without the support
of Congress.

#### No spillover to other areas of law, powers shared between Congress and the President have higher standards to be allowed to be delegated, so the aff doesn't need to spillover to solve

**Cornell Law School,** The History of the Doctrine of Nondelegability,
DELEGATION OF LEGISLATIVE POWER,
https://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution-conan/article-1/section-1/delegation-of-legislative-power

That the delegation of discretion in dealing with foreign relations
stands upon a different footing than the transfer of authority to
regulate domestic concerns was asserted in United States v.
Curtiss-Wright
Corporation.[140](https://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution-conan/article-1/section-1/delegation-of-legislative-power#fn140art1)
There the Court upheld a joint resolution of Congress making it unlawful
to sell arms to certain warring countries upon certain findings by the
President, a typically contingent type of delegation. But Justice
Sutherland for the Court proclaimed that the President is largely free
of the constitutional constraints imposed by the nondelegation doctrine
when he acts in foreign
affairs.[141](https://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution-conan/article-1/section-1/delegation-of-legislative-power#fn141art1)
Sixty years later, the Court, relying on Curtiss-Wright, reinforced such
a distinction in a case involving the President's authority over
military
justice.[142](https://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution-conan/article-1/section-1/delegation-of-legislative-power#fn142art1)

foreign relations, as asserted in
Curtiss-Wright,[143](https://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution-conan/article-1/section-1/delegation-of-legislative-power#fn143art1)
a lesser standard of delegation is applied in areas of power shared by
the President and Congress.]{.underline}

#### The president still has legislative ways to bypass congress

**Ford 6-11,** Matt, columnist for Newsrepublic and the Atlantic, A
Farewell to Arms Deals, The New Republic,
https://newrepublic.com/article/154160/trump-arms-deals-executive-power-democrats-congress

[Pompeo cited the Arms Export Control Act to justify the
administration's move, which includes a provision that [allows the
president](https://www.vox.com/2019/6/10/18659434/usa-saudi-arabia-trump-mbs-weapons-murphy-young)
to bypass congressional review if his administration determines that "an
emergency exists which requires the proposed sale in the national
security interest of the United States." What's striking is how
perfunctory the restrictions are in the first place: If Congress wants
to block a particular arms sale, lawmakers would need to pass a
resolution of disapproval by a two-thirds majority in both chambers to
overcome the president's likely veto]{.underline}. Traditional
Washington comity largely obscured this weakness, since the White House
would typically limit or scrap an arms deal if faced with enough
congressional criticism. [In the hands of a president with an iron grip
on one party and nothing but contempt for the other, it's more of a
blank check than a meaningful one]{.underline}. The raft of moribund
Cold War--era laws that give the president emergency powers in certain
circumstances, coupled with Trump's extraordinarily broad definition of
when they can be invoked, and the Supreme Court's supine deference to
those interpretations, has been a disastrous recipe for American
governance.

### 2ac Congress solves

#### Congress constitutionally should be in charge of arms exports

**Capito 7** \[Charles L. Capito III, JD-Washington and Lee University
School of Law, "Inadequate Checks and Balances: Critiquing the Imbalance
of Power in Arms Export Regulation", Washington and Lee University
School of Law,
http://lawdev.wlu.edu/deptimages/Law%20Review/64-1%20Capito%20Note.pdf\]

A legislative veto is unnecessary (and unconstitutional) in the context
of \"naturalization\" powers because there is a presumption that the
Executive\'s discretion is checked by the judiciary.318 The presence of
one of the presumptive checks from the Chadha majority distinguishes
Congress\'s power over immigration from its delegated power to regulate
the international trade of defense articles. **[Therefore, of the four
enumerated foreign affairs powers in the Constitution, only the power
\"to regulate Commerce with foreign Nations\" (more specifically, the
power to regulate arms transfers), has been (1) delegated to the
Executive and (2) precluded from meaningful judicial
review]{.underline}**. As a result, the hypothetical legislative veto is
appropriate only for situations implicating Congress\'s power to
regulate arms transfers. Not only can a definite line be drawn between
Congress\'s power over foreign commerce and its other enumerated powers
but this Note contends that another line can be drawn generally between
foreign and domestic affairs. Admittedly the line between the two is
sometimes hazy, but in most cases the distinction is clear. Congress
delegates much of its power in domestic affairs, but the difference
between delegated domestic authority and foreign affairs power is that
agency decisions made pursuant to domestic authority are presumably
reviewable. Once again, the availability of the judicial check on
executive discretion renders the legislative veto unnecessary in matters
of delegated domestic affairs. To summarize, this section argues tahat
Chadha generally precludes the use of the legislative veto. In
instances, however, where power goes unchecked, as is the case with
DDTC\'s interpretation of § 129, \"common sense and the inherent
necessities of the governmental coordination require a departure from
the formalistic rules prohibiting the legislative veto. The veto\'s use
must be judicious. It can apply only to the narrow situations that
implicate Congress\'s power to regulate arms transfers because all other
decisions made pursuant to delegated domestic powers are susceptible to
judicial review, and Congress\'s other foreign affairs powers have
either not been delegated or are reviewable by the courts. Therefore,
the argument that one exception will inevitably lead to the veto\'s
wholesale reintroduction is a non-starter because the legislative veto
may apply only to the narrow and defined area of congressional power
described above. 4. The Veto Legislation Can Be Thoughtfully Designed to
Avoid a Presentment Problem This Note\'s main purpose is to critique the
political imbalance regarding DDTC\'s interpretation of PTAR 5 129, and
the ineffectiveness of the checks and balances designed to remedy
similar situations.323 This Part\'s purpose is to suggest that a
legislative remedy, possibly in the form of a narrowly applied
legislative veto, is the most appropriate solution, but the exact
specifications and structure of the legislative veto are beyond the
scope of this Note. Before concluding, however, a brief discussion of
the legislative veto\'s construction is worthwhile. **[Because the
general use of the legislative veto is at odds with constitutional
formalities, the mechanism should be used only as a last resort. Thus,
any use of the veto should be subsequent to committee hearings whose
purpose is to inform the appropriate officials of Congress\'s
disapproval of the State Department\'s misinterpretation. Congress
already has the power to do this but lacks the significant threat of a
veto in its back pocket. Perhaps the mere threat of the veto will be
enough to steer the State Department\'s interpretations back on
track.324 To remedy the case at hand, the legislative veto provision
must give Congress the ability to object to statutory language it
observes being interpreted or used in a manner that is inconsistent with
Congress\'s wishes]{.underline}**. Louis Fisher, a renowned scholar of
presidential and congressional powers, defines legislative vetoes as
\"statutory provisions that delay an administrative action . . . during
which time Congress may approve or disapprove without further
presidential involvement.\"325 Using this definition as a framework,
this Note suggests that the AECA have a veto provision that requires
DDTC to submit its regulations (along with formal guidance as to how the
regulation is applied) to the foreign affairs oversight committee in
Congress. The committee, at that point, could choose to accept or veto
DDTC\'s interpretation. If Congress chose not to act within a short
period of time, then the agency\'s view would become binding. This
structure (as opposed to a veto provision that allows Congress to amend
regulations) does not threaten the Executive\'s independence because the
Executive retains control over the regulation\'s contents.326 The veto,
if exercised, would simply send the State Department and DDTC back to
the drawing board.327 The unicameral legislative veto in Chadha was
struck down because it violated the \"presentment\" and \"bicameralism\"
requirements of Article I.\~\~\~ Any revived version of the legislative
veto must address those two deficiencies. 324. See FISHER, supra note
266, at 212 (noting that Congress never used the veto power in the AECA,
but it was the threat of the veto that forced the Executive to
reconsider the trade of weapons). The \"bicameralism\" requirement329 is
the easiest deficiency to address. Any viable legislative veto must
ensure that its execution involve a vote in both Houses. The Presentment
on the other hand, is the requirement that cut \"the ground out from
under all legislative vetoes.\"331 Any legislative mechanism that will
effectively remedy the political imbalance must, however, avoid the
presidential veto or else the legislative veto becomes simply Article I
legislation.332 This Note raises a novel idea that is as fair as it is
untested. Essentially, the AECA would be amended in two ways. First,
Congress would be granted the legislative veto described above to
execute in situations in which an agency is effectively unchecked by the
other two branches. Second, veto provisions would include sunset clauses
requiring reauthorization every four to six years. The reauthorization
process, obviously, would be subject to the Presentment Clause and all
other Article I requirements. This scheme would give Congress the
necessary check on DDTC\'s interpretation of statutory language, while
also providing the Executive its constitutionally required veto power
(lest Congress stray too far from the Executive\'s foreign policy
objectives).

[**Thirty years ago, Congress reasserted its constitutional authority to
regulate arms transfers because \"\[tloo often in the past decisions
\[were\] made with respect to security assistance without the . . .
concurrence of Congress." Today, our arms export policy has once again
become unmoored from its constitutional foundations and unresponsive to
congressional influence. An absence of effective checks in the structure
of arms export regulation allows the Executive branch to operate
unilaterally and with impunity**.]{.underline} The lack of fundamental
constraints is particularly regrettable in the case of the State
Department\'s interpretation of 5 129.3, which perverts congressional
intent and would likely fail judicial review if review were available.
[**This imbalance of power not only flouts the basic principle that no
branch of government should go unchecked,335 but it has also caused
uncertainty within the defense industry, delayed the licensing process,
and threatened important policy objectives abroad**.]{.underline}
Strains on the United States\' defense industry significantly affect
some of the most volatile situations around the globe: It is vital that
the processes that control arms exports work with maximum efficiency and
clarity. **[Congress must, as it did thirty years ago, reassert its
power over the regulation and policy of arms exports.]{.underline}**
Recent events, such as the creation of a Senate subcommittee to oversee
the President\'s use of warrantless surveillance336 and the failure of
the administration\'s plan to handover port security to a Dubai firm,337
evidence Congress\'s ability and newfound willingness to respond to the
Executive\'s unilateral decision-making. Will the political imbalance
that plagues arms export control be next?

#### Arms sales should be under the Foreign Commerce Clause, a Congressional jurisdiction

\*\*can also say Curtiss-Wright's precedent in arms sales is
inextricably linked to every form of foreign policy power

**Sciarra 88** \[Vanessa Patton Sciarra was Vice President for Legal
Affairs and Trade & Investment Policy on the National Foreign Trade
Council and was responsible for matters related to trade and investment
policy, international trade agreements and international dispute
settlement, "Congress and Arms Sales: Tapping the Potential of the
Fast-Track Guarantee Procedure", Yale Law Journal Company,
<https://www.jstor.org/stable/pdf/796446>\]

[As in many areas of foreign policymaking, Both **Congress and the
President can claim some constitutional power to authorize arms sales.
United States v. Curtiss-Wright Corp. is often cited to support claims
of broad executive powers in foreign affairs. Language in the opinion
celebrates the \"very delicate, plenary and exclusive power of the
President as the sole organ of the federal government in the field of
international relations**---a power which does not require as a basis
for its exercise an act of Congress.\" Supporters of a strong executive
role in foreign affairs have seized on this conception and argued that
the opinion confirms a constitutionally-based general foreign affairs
power for the Executive. The general foreign affairs power, in tandem
with article Il\'s enumerated grants of power, can be read to support
the President\'s claim to constitutional authority in the arms sales
area.]{.underline} The commander-in-chief clause has historically been
seen to provide the Executive with wide- ranging power over military
matters even in peacetime. Further, the President may derive some power
in this area from the grant of general executive power in article[.
**Historically, Presidents have relied on the aggregation of these
powers to make executive agreements covering a wide range of
intergovernmental relations,** and this power can be seen as an
additional ground for assertion of executive power in this area. But
ironically, **given that dicta in Curtiss-Wright suggests an independent
role for the President in foreign affairs generally, the holding in the
case supports a less expansive view of the President\'s power in the
arms sales area**]{.underline}. The Supreme Court found that the statute
at issue in that case, granting to the President the power to prohibit
the sale of arms to certain countries, did not contain an
unconstitutional delegation of legislative power. [The holding thus
concedes that Congress has a role to play in arms sales. The Court would
have been hard pressed to argue for executive independence in the making
of arms sales given the strong congressional claims to participate in
arms sales. Congressional claims are derived from the foreign commerce
clause \[fn 25\] U.S. CONST. art. I, § 8, cl. 3. **The foreign commerce
clause allows Congress to regulate every aspect of trade with foreign
nations, including whether or not goods, including arms**, are sold at
all. See L. HENKIN, supra note 16, at 70 (\"The Commerce Power . . .
might be sufficient to support virtually any legislation that relates .
. . to foreign relations.\"); see also Note, supra note 20, at 310
(same).\[end footnote 25\]]{.underline} \]the \"spending power,\" the
power to dispose of U.S. property, the necessary and proper clause and
Congress\' general foreign affairs power. Given [Congress\' strong
textual claims to regulate arms sales]{.underline}, it will be rare that
a President will attempt to act on independent authority in the area.
Instead, the pressing question is how Congress should legislate so as to
ensure adequate scope for executive flexibility while exercising its
constitutional right to participate in decisionmaking. The history of
arms sales legislation, as in many other foreign affairs areas, has been
one of successive attempts to craft statutes that allow for delegation
without sacrificing participation in overall policy formulation. The
question of broad or narrow delegation of authority by Congress to the
President has often been determined by the values Congress wants to
maximize at a given time. [The executive branch argues that diplomatic
maneuvering demands the ability to make flexible responses and credible
offers. Indeed, in each of the three arms sales \"regimes\" employed in
the postwar period, Congress accepted the importance of executive
flexibility and credibility by delegating broadly. However, **Congress
has increasingly recognized the importance of others values, principally
the need for congressional oversight of executive action and
congressional participation in policymaking: in the two most recent
statutory regimes it has struggled to recalibrate the balance of power
to reflect these values.**]{.underline}

#### Curtis Wright unconstitutional

**Ramsey 2K** \[Michael D. Ramsey, Professor of Law, University of San
Diego Law School. William & Mary Law Review Volume 42 \| Issue 2 Article
9 The Myth of Extraconstitutional Foreign Affairs Power
https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/73968483.pdf\]

Nonetheless, [Curtiss-Wright is demonstrably wrong as a historical
matter, and it is wrong for reasons that have escaped the central focus
of many attacks upon it]{.underline}. As set forth below, whatever else
one thinks of Curtiss-Wright, it wrongly describes the understanding of
the drafters and ratifiers of the Constitution. [There was no theory of
extraconstitutional power in foreign affairs at the time the
Constitution was drafted and ratified. To the contrary, the
Constitution\'s drafters and ratifiers understood the Constitution as
the means to give the national government foreign relations power it
would otherwise lack.]{.underline} Surprisingly, no academic study has
comprehensively considered the 1787-89 understanding of the source of
foreign affairs power. Instead, criticism of Curtiss-Wright focuses upon
different time periods or broader issues, upon which consensus has
proved impossible. As a result, [Curtiss-Wright has survived despite
widespread attacks upon it. Once the focus is narrowed to the 1787-89
understanding of foreign affairs power, however, it should be
demonstrable beyond dispute that Curtiss-Wright is wrong upon this
point.]{.underline} Further, because Curtiss-Wright\'s reasoning depends
upon the claim that the Constitution was drafted against a background of
extraconstitutional powers in foreign affairs, once that claim is
rejected Curtiss-Wright as a whole becomes indefensible.

Prior criticism of Curtiss-Wright has failed to discredit the opinion
conclusively, in part because that criticism has claimed too much.
First, [Curtiss-Wright\'s critics often address not the question of
extraconstitutional power,]{.underline} but the opinion\'s secondary
claim that the President (as opposed to Congress) should have a
predominant role in foreign affairs.9 Proponents of congressional
leadership in foreign affairs have made powerful arguments in this
regard,\" but in spite of the attention given it, the matter remains
debatable. It is clear, at least as a practical matter, that the
President does play a leading role in foreign affairs, and has done so
since the founding.\"1 But the case against Curtiss-Wright need not turn
upon the scope of presidential authority in foreign affairs. [The truly
radical part of Curtiss-Wright is not its emphasis on presidential
power, but rather its claim that that power arose outside the
Constitution]{.underline}.

Curtiss-Wright\'s critics have also tried to prove more than necessary
in the area of state sovereignty. In so doing, they, as well as those
who defend the opinion, focus upon the wrong time period. Specifically,
they look not to 1787-89, but to the period surrounding independence
more than a decade earlier. Part of Curtiss-Wright\'s theory was that
the states were never fully sovereign. They passed, in Curtiss-Wright\'s
view, from being colonies to being subnational units in the newly
independent Union, and so never had foreign affairs power, which is an
attribute of full sovereignty.\' Attacks on Curtiss-Wright argue that
the states at one point were full sovereigns, and therefore
Curtiss-Wright cannot be correct on this point.\'\" But the former
proposition is widely disputed, as there are two competing historical
theories about what hi7ppened at the moment of independence: that the
states became independent separately and then created the Union, and
that the Union declared independence and so established the collective
independence of the states.\'4 Moreover, the debate has far-reaching
implications in other areas, such as claims of states\' rights based on
inherent state sovereignty and claims of inherent federal powers in
other fields. 5 Because the historical attack on Curtiss-Wright has
depended upon establishing the historical priority of the states-with
consequent implications for state sovereignty-it has proved unpersuasive
to those committed to the alternate historical reading; those skeptical
of state sovereignty cling to Curtiss-Wright, not so much for what it
says about foreign affairs powers, but for what is says about state
versus federal power in general.

A further difficulty is that [critics of Curtiss-Wright]{.underline}
have not gone far enough in one respect: they [have not offered a
constitutional alternative to the theory of extraconstitutional foreign
affairs power]{.underline}. [Curtiss-Wright is attractive]{.underline},
despite its drawbacks, [because]{.underline} [it]{.underline} appears to
[answer]{.underline} three difficult que[s]{.underline}tions regarding
foreign affairs: [the source of federal foreign affairs power, the
allocation of federal foreign affairs power, and the extent of the
foreign affairs power of the states]{.underline}

The Constitutionality of Human Rights Legislation In conditioning
military aid to foreign countries on their respect for human rights,
[Congress treads in an area of constitutional uncertainty. The U.S.
Constitution leaves open to dispute which branch of the government is to
direct the course of foreign policy.24 The enumerated powers of the
President in this area are few]{.underline}: the commander in chief
power,25 the power to receive ambassadors,26 and (with the advice and
consent of the Senate) the power to make treaties and appoint ambassa-
dors and other officers of the United States.27 The President also is
charged with exercising the \"executive Power\" 28 and is required to
\"take Care that the Laws be faithfully executed.\" 29 Case law and
executive practice have added an unenumerated \"foreign affairs\" or
\"sole organ\" 30 power as well, **[although its content is far from
clear]{.underline}**.31 **[The enumerated powers of Congress relating to
foreign affairs include the power to]{.underline}** declare war,32 to
establish, support and regulate the armed forces, 33 to define and
punish offenses against the law of nations, 34 and to **[regulate
foreign commerce]{.underline}**.35 More generally, **[the Constitution
vests in Congress the authority to provide \"for the common Defense and
general Welfare of the United States]{.underline}**.\"\'36 In addition,
Congress derives implied \[FN 24\] As they have evolved**, [the foreign
relations powers appear not so much "separated" as fissured, along
jagged lines indifferent to classical categories of governmental power:
some powers and functions belong to the President, some to Congress,
some to the President-and-Senate]{.underline}**[;]{.underline} some can
be exercised by either the President or the Congress, some require the
joint authority of both[. **Irregular, uncertain division renders claims
of usurpation more difficult to establish and the courts have not been
available to adjudicate them.**]{.underline} \[End FN 24\] powers from
the \"necessary and proper\" clause,3 7 as well as from an unenumerated
congressional \"foreign affairs\" power.38 **[Undoubtedly Congress has
the authority, under the foreign commerce power, to regulate sales of
weapons and technology to foreign countries. Equally clear, the
disbursement of foreign aid is a function of the spend- ing power of
Congress]{.underline}. 3 9 [It does not follow, however, that Congress
may exercise these powers in any way it chooses. The powers are
exclusive]{.underline},** in that no other branch on its own authority
may spend for the general welfare or regulate foreign commerce, and they
**[are unquestionably broad]{.underline}**, but they are not without
limits. Even in the exercise of its exclusive powers, Congress is bound
by the Constitution, and it cannot violate constitutional constraints on
federal authority. Congress could not, for example, appropriate funds to
estab- lish an official religion. It could not pay government employees
dispa- rately according to their race. Nor could it withhold salaries to
certain federal employees because it believes they are \"subversives.\"
\'40 **[Other limits on Congress, less clear perhaps, derive from the
separa- tion of federal powers]{.underline},41 and it is [these limits
that may be implicated in Congress\' control over foreign aid and arms
sales. To what extent do the powers vested by the Constitution in the
Executive Branch constrain Congress\' discretion to spend for the
general welfare and to regulate commerce among foreign
nations]{.underline}**[?]{.underline} While the Supreme Court has never
struck down any use of the spending power as an infringement upon ex-
excutive authority,42 certain limits must exist. For example, in
exercising its spending power, Congress cannot nullify a power that
belongs exclu- sively to the Executive. In particular, it is unlikely
that Congress could refuse to appropriate money for the salary of an
ambassador or for the maintenance of an embassy. Congressional action of
this sort would un- abashedly intrude on the President\'s exclusive
appointment and recogni- 43 tion powers. Human rights restrictions on
foreign aid and trade do conflict with the President\'s recognition
power and its emanations. Directing the Presi- dent to declare a country
a gross violator of human rights44 would cer- tainly affect, and might
well jeopardize, U.S. relations with that country. To put this argument
at its strongest, a congressional human rights pol-icy could result in a
severance of diplomatic relations. But this situation is different from
a decision by Congress to cut off all funds for an em- bassy. The latter
is a direct nullification of the President\'s power to es- tablish
diplomatic relations; the former is a legitimate legislative policy- to
avoid funding governments that deny their citizens fundamental human
rights-that might result in the deterioration of diplomatic rela-
tions.45 As Louis Henkin has written: It has been argued that
increasingly foreign policy takes the form of spend- ing programs; that
\[aid programs\] in particular are \... essential indicia of friendly
relations with many countries; that decisions as to aid are therefore
properly the President\'s responsibility and Congress can no more refuse
the President appropriations for foreign assistance than for
maintaining\' an embassy. Here the argument for Congressional
independence is surely stronger. Foreign assistance seems not merely an
appropriation of funds to implement policies which are primarily the
President\'s responsibility but a form of spending for the general
welfare of the United States, and it is difficult to accept that the
President should command a power expressly conferred 46 upon Congress.
Champions of executive autonomy may also argue that human rights
restrictions interfere with the \"sole organ\" power of the President,
or, as Justice Sutherland wrote in Curtiss-Wright,the power of \"the
President alone . . . to speak or listen as a representative of the
nation. \' 47 This doctrine has doubtful merit as a statement of
constitutional principle.48 [However, **even if the President does
possess a \"sole organ\" power requir- ing \"one voice\" in foreign
affairs, it does not follow that Congress should be denied a role in
shaping the content of that voice**.]{.underline}49 In the case of
Guatemala, for instance, direct communication by Congress with the
Guatemalan government might unconstitutionally infringe on the Presi-
dent\'s \"sole organ\" power.50 But Congress is not forbidden from
directing the President to refuse, in his single voice, aid to
Guatemala[. **If any content can be imputed to the \"sole organ\" power
of the President, it cannot utterly disempower Congress from acting
under its express con- stitutional authority to regulate foreign
commerce and provide for the common defense and general
welfare.**]{.underline} 51 **[Congress and the President are partners in
the making of foreign pol- icy, and while each has exclusive powers,
they frequently occupy the same terrain.]{.underline} [The actions of
one affect the actions of the other]{.underline}**, and human rights
legislation is no exception. [**It could not be otherwise**, **with- out
sacrificing the principles of a constitutional scheme that places great
value on a system of checks and balances. Congress, therefore, has the
constitutional power to enact human rights restrictions on foreign aid
and trade**]{.underline}. Because, under Article II, the President
\"shall take Care that the Laws be faithfully executed,\" 52 it is
unconstitutional for the President not to enforce human rights legisla-
tion. However, the courts are loath to adjudicate foreign policy
disputes between Congress and the President, labeling such disputes
nonjusticia- ble political questions 53 or denying standing to the
litigants. 54 In the political arena, a successful challenge to
executive action is also difficult, and may require the two-thirds vote
necessary to override the President\'s veto. Thus, while the
Administration has no constitutional authority to avoid executing human
rights statutes, it may often find the political power to evade their
provisions.

### 2AC NUQ

#### **The thesis of the aff disproves the DA\-- the executive currently has the power to raise taxes and tariffs, a Congressional jurisdiction**

**Golshan 18** (Tara Golshan, Covers Congress, Election, and Politics
for Vox, "Why Trump can raise steel tariffs without Congress", Mar 8,
2018, <https://www.vox.com/2018/3/8/17097206/trump-tariffs-congress>)

[Raising taxes and tariffs is usually Congress's job]{.underline}. But
on Thursday, [President Donald Trump officially raised tariffs on steel
and aluminum imports, despite widespread opposition from Republicans in
Congress]{.underline} --- [and it was completely in his
right]{.underline} to do so. [Trump signed an executive
order]{.underline} calling on the Commerce Department [to impose a 25
percent tariff on steel imports and a 10 percent tariff on
aluminum]{.underline}. [His reason: Foreign countries' current trade
practices with the United States are a threat to national
security]{.underline}. [By law, that's enough of a reason to bypass
Congress]{.underline} altogether. It's left his party in a lurch.
[Congressional Republicans spent much of Thursday unsure of what Trump
would actually do on tariffs]{.underline}. On Wednesday, [107 House
Republicans wrote Trump a letter imploring him not to impose
tariffs]{.underline}. Many Republican senators --- including ranking
Sens. John Thune (SD) and Orrin Hatch (UT) --- have advised the
president against the action as well. Sen. Ben Sasse (R-NE) went so far
as to say you'd "expect a policy this bad from a leftist
administration," not a Republican one. Already, Sen. Jeff Flake (R-AZ)
has said he will propose a bill to nullify the tariffs. "[These
so-called 'flexible tariffs' are a marriage of two lethal poisons to
economic growth --- protectionism and uncertainty," Flake said in a
statement. "Trade wars are not won, they are only lost. Congress cannot
be complicit as the administration courts economic
disaster."]{.underline}

The only way Congress could really stop the tariffs is by passing a
measure with a veto-proof majority that would either strip Trump's
executive powers over tariffs or undo the ones he has put in place.
Needless to say, in a contentious midterm year, both options carry great
political risk. Why the president can impose tariffs without Congress's
approval The Constitution is pretty clear: It's in Congress's power "to
lay and collect taxes, duties, Imposts and Excises, to pay the Debts and
provide for the common Defence and general Welfare of the United
States," and regulate trade between the US and other countries. But
[over the past century, Congress has shifted many of the powers to raise
and lower tariffs to the executive branch]{.underline} (a concentration
of power that conservatives now decry). [There are many ways the
president can impose tariffs without congressional
approval]{.underline}. To name a few: [Through]{.underline} [the Trading
With the Enemy Act of 1917, the president can impose a tariff during a
time of war]{.underline}. But the country doesn't need to be at war with
a specific country --- just generally somewhere where the tariffs would
apply. (This is how Richard Nixon imposed a 10 percent tariff in 1971,
citing the Korean War.) The [Trade Act of 1974 allows the president to
implement a 15 percent tariff for 150 days]{.underline} [if there is "an
adverse impact on national security]{.underline} from imports." After
150 days, the trade policy would need congressional approval. There's
[the International Emergency Economic Powers Act of 1977]{.underline},
which would [allow the president to implement tariffs during a national
emergency]{.underline}. Trump's White House cited [Section 232 of the
Trade Expansion Act of 1962]{.underline}, a provision that [gives the
secretary of commerce the authority to investigate and determine the
impacts of any import on]{.underline} the [national
security]{.underline} of the United States --- [and the president the
power to adjust tariffs]{.underline} [accordingly]{.underline}. In this
case, Wilbur Ross, Trump's commerce secretary, conducted an
investigation, which Trump called for last April, into the impacts of
steel and aluminum imports. That report was [enough legal
justification]{.underline} for Trump [to bypass both Congress and the
independent US International Trade Commission (USITC]{.underline}),
which is typically called on to weigh in on proposed tariffs. (When
President George W. Bush imposed steel tariffs in 2002 as temporary
safeguards, it required USITC oversight.) Republicans in Congress are
really not a fan of these tariffs For months, congressional Republicans
and Trump's former top economic adviser Gary Cohn --- who resigned from
office this week --- have been trying to convince the president that
imposing tariffs on steel and aluminum imports is a bad idea. But on
Thursday, Trump made it clear that he doesn't care what his party
thinks, highlighting one of the key policy divides between him and many
Republicans. Congressional Republicans went through a kitchen sink of
concerns about Trump's trade proposal. [Critics say angering US trading
partners will lead to retaliatory countermeasures]{.underline}, which
could cost Americans jobs and raise prices for American businesses that
buy steel and aluminum. Even one of Trump's most consistent defenders,
Rep. Mark Meadows (R-NC), who chairs the conservative House Freedom
Caucus, tweeted against the proposal --- although, notably, he put the
onus on the Commerce Department, not Trump. Thune and Kansas Republican
Sen. Pat Roberts said they were worried about [the agricultural
industry]{.underline}, which [could be targeted in a trade
war]{.underline}. "I'm not very happy," Roberts said. Sen. Ron Johnson
(R-WI) said the aluminum tariffs could impact the beer industry in his
state.

[The 1930s featured an increased number of instances in which Congress
chose to explicitly or implicitly delegate its powers to the executive
branch]{.underline} or to agencies staffed by the executive. In the
early years of the New Deal several new federal agencies were created by
delegation, and in two cases in the mid 1930s the Court struck down
provisions of the National Industrial Recovery Act on on the ground that
Congress's delegation of its powers to the executive had not provided
adequate standards for making decisions. Meanwhile Congress had been
doing some delegating in the foreign relations arena as well: [a joint
resolution it issued in 1934 gave power to the President to prohibit
American arms manufacturers from shipping weapons to foreign nations if
he found that such a prohibition would "contribute to the establishment
of peace." One arms manufacturer, the Curtiss-Wright Export Company, was
prohibited by President Roosevelt from shipping aircraft machine guns to
Bolivia, and challenged the order as an unconstitutional delegation of
legislative power to the executive branch.271 As we have seen, there had
been a long history of foreign affairs decisions being regarded as
"submitted to the Executive" under the Constitution. But Roosevelt's
prohibition of overseas arms sales, which could be triggered simply by
his personal judgments about the effects of those sales, seemed to
resemble the standardless delegations that the Court had found in the
National Industrial Recovery Act cases]{.underline}. Moreover, the 1934
executive order ending arms shipments to Bolivia was not the only
example of Congressional delegations to the executive in the foreign
relations sphere. A year earlier the United States had recognized the
Soviet Union after 15 years of non-recognition, but the form of
recognition had not been the traditional form of a treaty with Senate
ratification. It had been an executive agreement which was the result of
diplomatic correspondence between Roosevelt and the Soviet Commissar of
Foreign Affairs Maxim Litvinov.272 An important feature of the Litvinov
Agreement, as it was known, was the assignment to the United States of
all amounts owed by American nationals to the Soviets. Most of the
assigned obligations were based on the Soviet government's confiscation
of assets owned by Americans in Russia at the time the Soviets seized
power. The Litvinov Agreement had the effect of legitimating that
confiscation and making the United States government the creditor of a
variety of persons that had owned property in pre-Soviet Russia. Between
1937 and 1945 the Court decided three cases related to the exercise of
executive power in connection with the 1934 presidential arms embargo
and the Litvinov Agreement. In each case the Court held that the
exercise of power was within the discretion of the President, passed
constitutional muster, and represented a policy decision of the United
States government that superceded contrary law and was binding on the
courts. [The cumulative effect of the decisions was to significantly
expand the category of cases that were "submitted to the executive"
under the Constitution. In the first case, United States v.
Curtiss-Wright Export Co., 273 Justice George Sutherland, for the Court,
propounded the novel theory that the federal government's powers in the
area of foreign relations were "inherent," deriving from national
sovereignty rather than from the Constitution, and were thus not subject
to constitutional restraints such as the non-delegation
doctrin]{.underline}e. In addition, Sutherland's Curtiss-Wright opinion
canvassed reasons for what he called the "plenary and exclusive power of
the President\....in the field of international relations."274 He cited
the longstanding practice of Congress's delegating power to the
President to negotiate international treaties, and suggested that this
provided an argument for "the constitutionality of the practice."275
[Both his "inherent powers" theory and his argument from practice were
subject to the objection that they confused the United States's status
as an international entity with the status of the federal government
under the Constitution. The power of the federal executive to negotiate
international agreements presupposes that those agreements, when they
affected the states or American citizens, are subject to constitutional
limitations. Few commentators, however, criticized the Court's
conclusion in Curtiss-Wright that the President had discretion to
suspend the foreign arms sales of American corporations at his pleasure.
The Court then relied on Curtiss-Wright in two subsequent decisions, the
1937 case and the 1942 case of United States v. Pink, 278 in which it
found that the Litvinov Agreement's assignment provisions represented
policies of the United States government which superceded state law and
could not be reviewed by the courts.]{.underline} Both cases involved
the disposition, in New York state, of assets that had been confiscated
by the Soviet government and assigned to the United States under the
Litvinov Agreement. In both the Court concluded that the claims of the
United States to the assets, which had originally been owned by a
Russian metal works corporation and a Russian insurance company,
prevailed over those of Russian nationals or creditors, even though that
disposition was contrary to the rules of New York state for distributing
assets. "\[T\]he policies of the States become wholly irrelvant to
judicial inquiry," Douglas wrote for the Court in the Pink case, "when
the United States, acting within its constitutional sphere, seeks
enforcement of its foreign policy in the courts."279 Even though the
Litvinov Agreement was not a treaty, it prevailed over competing state
law.

Fourth, Congress has only its specifically enumerated powers in foreign
affairs, but these include a power to legislate in support of the
President. [A textual approach compels the conclusion that Congress has
only the powers granted to it by the text.96 No provisions in Article I,
Section 8 (the relevant text), either considered individually or taken
together, amount to a comprehensive congressional authority over foreign
affairs]{.underline}. But Congress has two important sources of
lawmaking authority that, taken together, almost add up to a general
power.97 [[Congress, of course, enjoys explicit legislative powers in
particular areas of foreign affairs, such as the power to regulate
foreign commerce, declare war, etc]{.underline}]{.mark}., plus the power
to make laws \"necessary and proper\" to effectuate these powers.98 From
our second and third principles, it should be clear that **[[these are
independent powers of Congress, which can be exercised despite
presidential opposition.]{.underline}]{.mark}** 9 [In addition, Congress
also may invoke the Necessary and Proper Clause to carry into execution
the powers granted to the President by the Constitution.]{.underline}
From our first principle, this includes the power to carry into
execution the President\'s residual foreign affairs powers. Thus
Congress has the general power to legislate in support of the
President\'s foreign policy goals. But this general power-unlike
Congress\'s specifically enumerated powers-is subject to a key
limitation. Since it is derivative of the President\'s power, it must be
exercised in coordination with, and not in opposition to, the President.
°° As a result the Constitution achieves a complex series of interbranch
checks in foreign affairs. The President has a residual executive power,
which means that only the President can speak for the United States on
the international stage and can formulate foreign policy (narrowly
understood).\' 0\' At the same time, [[the President must rely on
Congress (or two-thirds of the Senate) to give foreign policy any
domestic legal effect]{.underline}]{.mark}. **[Congress can pursue
foreign affairs goals independently from the President through
legislation in areas where it has a specifically enumerated power, such
as foreign commerce]{.mark}**. In other areas, where Congress has only
derivative power, it can act to support the President (or it can refuse
to act), but it cannot pursue independent objectives. [[No single
branch, acting alone, has complete control over the course of U.S.
foreign affairs]{.underline}]{.mark}.

FASHIONING A NEW PRESIDENTIAL MODEL In dismissing the administration's
plea for a President who acts as "sole organ" in the field of foreign
affairs, [[t**he Court**]{.underline}]{.mark} **in Zivotofsky [[created
a variant that seem]{.underline}]{.mark} close cousin, [[without
ground]{.mark}ing it [in any constitutional text]{.mark}]{.underline}**.
It states that recognition is a topic on which the Nation must "'speak .
. . with one voice,'" and that voice "must be the President's."357 The
citation here is to the Court's decisions in Garamendi (2003), quoting
Crosby (2000).358 Neither decision had anything to do with independent
presidential power in foreign affairs, cut free from congressional
control. Instead, both cases concerned efforts by states to interfere
with national policy. [[Crosby involved a Massachusetts law that barred
state entities from buying goods or services from companies doing
business with Burma]{.underline}]{.mark}. [Congress later imposed
mandatory and conditional sanctions on Burma. A unanimous Court held
that **[the state act was preempted]{.mark}** by congressional statutory
policy]{.underline}.359 The decision did not elevate the President over
Congress in external affairs. Instead, the Court declared: "A
fundamental principle of the Constitution is that Congress has the power
to preempt state law."360 [[The President was operating on statutory
authority, not on independent executive power]{.underline}]{.mark}. The
Massachusetts law on Burma represented "an obstacle to the
accomplishment of Congress's full objectives under the federal Act."361
The Court explained that the legislation passed by Congress "intended
the federal Act to provide the President with flexible and effective
authority over economic sanctions against Burma."362 The President was
therefore operating on the basis of statutory authority, not independent
executive power. In that sense, the President was acting under Justice
Jackson's first category in his Youngstown concurrence: "[[When the
President acts pursuant to an express or implied authorization of
Congress, his authority is at its maximum]{.underline}]{.mark}, for it
includes all that he possesses in his own right plus all that Congress
can delegate."363

Emphasis on the President\'s power to formulate foreign policy, with its
roots in his control of foreign relations, should not depre- ciate the
part which Congress continues to have in the formulation of foreign
policy. [Congress formulates major foreign policy by legis- lation
regulating commerce with foreign nations or authorizing in- ternational
trade agreements]{.underline}.2\' The Foreign Commerce Power has grown
enormously on the wings of the Interstate Commerce Power so that
Congress now has nearly-unlimited power to regulate any- thing that is,
is in, or affects, either interstate or foreign commerce. Congress, and
Congress alone, also has the power to make the na- tional policy to go
to war or to stay at peace; it has determined United States neutrality
in the wars of others. The War Powers of Congress include the power to
legislate and spend as necessary to wage war successfully; to prepare
for, deter, or defend against war; and to deal with the consequences of
war. Under the \"general wel- fare\" clause, Congress can decide where,
for what, how much, and on what conditions to spend, as in foreign aid.
There are implica- tions for foreign policy when Congress establishes
and regulates the Foreign Service and the bureaucracies of various
departments and agencies dealing with foreign affairs. The innumerable
uses of the \"necessary and proper\" clause include many that
\"formulate for- eign policy.\" Since foreign policy and foreign
relations require money, which only Congress can appropriate,\"
**[[Congress has some voice in all foreign policy through the
appropriations process, al- though Congress would probably not be
constitutionally justified in refusing to support policies which are

matters relating to \"nationhood\" and foreign affairs may reach far
beyond regulation of immigration, nationality, and diplomacy. It

[House Democrats warn that getting the Trump administration to cooperate
with their investigations is a matter of life-or-death for American
democracy.]{.underline} A number of legal and political experts agree.
[But lawmakers are fighting an uneven battle, they warn, one that favors
President Trump. Congress has chipped away at its own power for decades,
leaving the executive branch disproportionately strong. And now they're
facing off against a president willing to use every tool he's got to
flout them.]{.underline} Here's a look at the perfect storm of reasons
Congress will struggle to get what it wants from Trump. If they lose,
legal experts warn, it could exacerbate Congress's weakness for years to
come: [Congress has been ceding power to the executive branch since
World War II.]{.underline} This comes in many forms, said Sarah Binder,
a congressional expert and senior fellow at the Brookings Institution. A
notable one is that Congress created agencies such as the CIA or the
National Security Agency, then delegated power and oversight to the
president, which in turn gives the White House more resources for
standoffs against Congress. "It bolsters the president's ability to get
what he wants," Binder said, "because it's hard to challenge the
president because the president has more information." And once you give
a branch of government more power, it\'s very difficult to take it back.
[Congress is a coequal branch, yes, but it's also the messiest one. In
its purest form, Congress has 535 bosses all with different constituents
and thus different priorities. The executive branch has one boss and
thousands of people working to help him or her fulfill an
agenda.]{.underline} \"Wrangling all those cats to look like a branch of
government that can exert authority vis-a-vis the other branches is just
a more complicated endeavor than the executive branch," said Jennifer
Victor, a political science professor at George Mason University. [House
Democrats have to go it alone with holding Trump accountable, because
partisanship. We've been talking about Congress as an institution going
up against the president, but really, it's just one party in one chamber
of Congress that is willing to do anything.]{.underline} Democrats
control the majority in the House of Representatives and thus the
committees that are issuing subpoenas for people and information within
the Trump administration. They're investigating everything from Trump's
business practices before the White House to whether he obstructed the
special counsel probe into Russian election interference once he became
president. But Trump has the Republican-controlled Senate and
Republicans in the House to block for him. They have been holding news
conferences to defend the president, using powerful platforms to share
misleading information about special counsel Robert S. Mueller III's
report and using legislative stalling to drag out the investigatory
process as best they can. It's not unusual for the party of the
president to defend said president, but Trump has a particularly strong
grip on the Republican Party. That only strengthens his hand. Trump is
thwarting Congress more than any other recent president. There's always
been a natural tension between Congress's oversight authority into the
White House. In past administrations that's manifested in George W. Bush
fighting information about investigations into firing of U.S. attorneys
or Barack Obama refusing to have his attorney general testify about a
gun-drug-trafficking program. But that wrangling happened over just one
or two disputes. Trump's refusal to hand over anything related to any
congressional investigation is unlike any other president in modern
memory, said Josh Chafetz, a constitutional expert on Congress at
Cornell Law. Democrats are typically less inclined than Republicans to
take big political risks. Democrats have options to flex back. They are
considering voting to hold Attorney General William P. Barr in contempt
of Congress for not showing up to a hearing. House Speaker Nancy D.
Pelosi (D-Calif.) is using language that sounds like she's open to
Congress impeaching Barr. Some Democrats want to begin impeachment
proceedings against Trump himself. But all of these carry political
risks. A recent Washington Post-ABC News poll shows that a majority of
Americans oppose impeaching Trump even though most Americans believe he
lied. And Victor said that traditionally, Democrats are more nervous to
play brinkmanship than Republicans when it comes at a political cost.
But many legal and legislative experts say Congress may have no choice.
[Everyone The Fix spoke to said they are genuinely worried about
Congress as an institution. If the Trump administration can thwart
Congress without any significant repercussions, they could be forging
the new norm: an even weaker Congress and a stronger-than-ever
presidency. "I don't normally throw around terms like constitutional
crisis," Binder said, "but that is what's happening here if Congress
can't stand up for its prerogative as an equal branch."]{.underline}

In the age of Donald Trump, it often feels as though one individual has
the power to chart the United States' course in the world all by
himself. Since taking office as U.S. president, [Trump has made a series
of unilateral decisions with enormous consequences. He walked away from
the Trans-Pacific Partnership, the Paris agreement on climate change,
and the Iran nuclear deal. He imposed tariffs on Canada,
[China](https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/china/2018-03-22/better-way-challenge-china-trade),
Mexico, and the European Union]{.underline}. In June, [he
single-handedly upended the G-7 summit by insulting Canadian Prime
Minister Justin Trudeau and withdrawing the United States from the
group's joint communiqué]{.underline}. In July, [his European travels
produced more diplomatic fireworks, with a [NATO
summit](https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/europe/2018-07-09/nato-age-trump)
in Brussels that raised questions about his commitment to the
organization---before his [deferential press
conference](https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/russian-federation/2018-07-13/brothers-arms)
with Russian President Vladimir Putin**. Each choice has brought howls
of outrage---but little real pushback. Congress**, for example**, has
proved unable to block the president from starting a [trade
war](https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/2018-06-25/trumps-trade-war-escalates)
with China and with U.S. allies**]{.underline}. For all of Trump's talk
of a shadowy "deep state" bent on undermining his every move, the U.S.
government's vast bureaucracy has watched as the president has dragged
his feet on a plan to deter [Russian election
interference](https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/russia-fsu/2016-09-20/putins-meddling-us-elections).
Even the United States' closest allies have been unable to talk
[Trump](https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/united-states/2018-01-18/trump-normal-foreign-policy-president)
out of damaging and potentially withdrawing from institutions of the
liberal international order that the country has led for decades. How
can a political system vaunted for its checks and balances allow one
person to act so freely? [In reality, the problem goes well beyond
Trump, and even beyond the well-documented trend of increasing
presidential power. **Constraints on the president**---not just from
Congress but also from the bureaucracy, allies, and international
institutions---**have been eroding for decades**. Constraints are like
muscles: once atrophied, they require bulking up before the competitor
can get back in the game. Trump did not create the freedom of action he
is now routinely displaying. He has]{.underline} merely
[revealed]{.underline} just [how difficult it is to prevent it. In
Congress, the combination of declining foreign policy
[expertise](https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/united-states/2017-04-05/democratizing-us-foreign-policy)
among members and increasing political polarization has reduced the
ability of legislators to supervise the executive branch]{.underline}
even if they had the appetite to do so. [The bureaucracy]{.underline},
meanwhile[, has **lost its incentive to cultivate and wield expertise as
decision-making has become centralized in the White House and
congressional action and oversight on foreign policy have
declined.**]{.underline} And U.S. allies, for their part, have become
less able to check the president's foreign policies as the alliances
have become ensnared in U.S. partisan politics. Similarly, the
post--Cold War era has frequently seen presidents circumvent
international institutions. [Going forward, any attempts to stem the
growth of presidential power will have to confront not just the damage
done by Trump but also the deeper problem that damage has exposed: that
the bodies charged with constraining presidential power have been
steadily losing both their willingness and their capacity to rein in
presidents]{.underline}. Many have written eloquently, particularly
since 9/11, about the need for checks on presidential power. But the
reality is that Congress is in no shape to reclaim its role in foreign
policy---and neither are the other traditional sources of constraint on
U.S. presidents. It may take a major shock, such as the rise of China,
to reboot the system. Legislators Gone AWOL **[The Constitution grants
Congress the ability to constrain the president on issues such as trade
and the use of force]{.underline}**. Although formal votes on
presidential foreign policy are rare, **[the legislative branch can [act
as a
check](https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/iraq/2007-09-01/when-congress-stops-wars)
on the president in several other, more informal ways.]{.underline}**
Senators and representatives can hold hearings that generate debate and
expose decisions to public scrutiny. They can also force the president
to anticipate congressional reactions to policy, leading him to check
himself before Congress checks him---an important, if often invisible,
form of oversight. For example, he might shape the details of a
controversial international agreement to make sure members of Congress
will not balk. But Congress' oversight of U.S. foreign policy has
[declined
markedly](https://www.nytimes.com/roomfordebate/2014/08/07/a-return-to-the-fight-in-iraq/us-must-seek-strong-legal-justification-to-intervene)
since the early Cold War, and especially since the mid-1990s. As the
political scientist Linda Fowler has put it, "Something is amiss in the
Senate and its national security committees." [The two Senate committees
tasked with oversight of foreign policy and national security---the
Foreign Relations Committee and the Armed Services Committee---have held
substantially fewer hearings (both public and private) over time,
resulting in far less supervision of major foreign policy endeavors,
such as the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq, than was the case for Cold
War--era military interventions. Why this decrease? **The rise of
partisanship is one important reason.**]{.underline} Although foreign
policy has never been fully isolated from politics, political
polarization began to rise in the 1970s, and it increased sharply in the
1990s. Today, members of Congress reflexively support their own party.
In periods of unified government, this means extreme deference to the
president. In periods of divided government, it means congressional
gridlock. Neither scenario yields much in terms of congressional
oversight. [Polarization also gives presidents reason to]{.underline}
simply [ignore Congress when making foreign policy.]{.underline} As the
political scientist Kenneth Schultz has
[argued](https://twq.elliott.gwu.edu/sites/g/files/zaxdzs2121/f/downloads/TWQ_Winter%202018_Schultz.pdf)[,
with members less willing to cross the aisle, it is "more difficult to
get bipartisan support for ambitious or risky undertakings, particularly
the use of military force and the conclusion of treaties." And so
presidents opt for alternatives such as executive agreements over formal
mechanisms such as ratified treaties.]{.underline} Consider the Iran
nuclear deal. In 2015, President Barack Obama, concerned that he could
not get a treaty with Iran past the Republican-controlled Congress,
chose to make an executive agreement (which made it all too easy for
Trump to tear up the deal later). [Another trend that has sapped
Congress' influence is the decline of congressional expertise on foreign
policy and national security.]{.underline} Simply put, [legislators used
to know more about foreign policy than they do now. Greater expertise
strengthened Congress' formal and visible role, since committees could
engage in greater oversight of the executive branch. Expertise also
reinforced Congress' invisible means of constraining presidential power.
Presidents had to think about how a seasoned committee chair or member
would assess a policy.]{.underline} During his initial escalation of the
Vietnam War, for example, President Lyndon Johnson was careful to
maintain the support of powerful committee chairs, such as Senator J.
William Fulbright, who led the Senate Foreign Relations Committee from
1959 to 1974. Fulbright shepherded the Gulf of Tonkin Resolution through
the Senate in 1964, but two years later, his probative hearings helped
shift public opinion against the war. Congressional expertise also led
to serious, bipartisan policies that could force the president's hand. A
good example is the Cooperative Threat Reduction Program, an initiative
for safely securing and dismantling weapons of mass destruction in the
former Soviet Union. Senator Sam Nunn, a Democrat from Georgia, and
Senator Richard Lugar, a Republican from Indiana---two defense stalwarts
who had been deeply involved in arms control agreements during the Cold
War---proposed it in 1991 as an amendment to the annual defense bill.
The George H. W. Bush administration initially opposed the legislation
because it diverted \$500 million previously authorized for other
purposes, but Nunn and Lugar prevailed, backed up by 86 votes in the
Senate. They were able to pass their bill because the existing
polarization was still manageable and because both senators were
respected experts on defense and foreign policy. The program was a
high-water mark of expertise-informed legislation. In the years since,
legislators have become less and less interested in the details of
foreign policy. In 1994, a small group of newly elected congressional
Republicans even proudly declared that they did not own passports.
[Several factors explain the decline in expertise. Changes in the way
senators now divide up committee roles, by increasing the number of
committees they sit on, have led to greater breadth at the expense of
depth. The media, facing fragmentation and declining budgets, have paid
less attention to the crucial committees, especially the Senate Foreign
Relations Committee and the House Foreign Affairs Committee, thus
diminishing their value as reputation burnishers on Capitol Hill.
Increased turnover has led to less seniority, particularly on the Senate
Foreign Relations Committee, reducing the number of specialists to whom
other senators can look for leadership on complex issues. Add in
polarization and gridlock, which, by reducing overall congressional
activity, also reduces the incentives to develop specialties, and the
result is a Congress with decidedly less expertise]{.underline}. An
inflection point in the long-term decline of congressional oversight
came after 9/11, when Congress passed the Authorization for Use of
Military Force, a measure intended to combat terrorism but that
presidents ended up interpreting broadly. For nearly 17 years, the AUMF
has served as the legal justification for expanding military operations
across the Middle East, many of them only tenuously related to the
original intent. But legislators have shown little appetite for seeking
a new AUMF, which would constrain the president when it comes to the
many counterterrorism missions the United States now conducts in places
such as Somalia, Syria, and Yemen. That's because the status quo
actually suits many members of Congress. It lets them avoid voting on
military operations---always risky, since they can be held accountable
for their decision on the campaign trail---and it allows them to fixate
on the legality of the operation without having to take a position on
its wisdom. Obama's decision in August 2013 to seek [congressional
authorization](https://newrepublic.com/article/119827/obamas-war-powers-legacy-he-must-seek-congressional-authorization)
for the use of force in Syria in response to the regime's use of
chemical weapons may at first glance look like a sign of deference. But
it actually exposed how weak legislators' war-making powers had become.
Unable to gain backing even from the United Kingdom[, Obama announced
that he would seek congressional authorization before launching an
attack. Apart from a few Republicans who insisted that the president
could not strike Syria without legislative]{.underline} approval
(something they would not insist on later when Trump carried out strikes
in 2017**[), most members were visibly eager to avoid being drawn into
the debate---thereby proving how much Congress had been
sidelined]{.underline}.** As Ben Rhodes, Obama's deputy national
security adviser, confirmed in his memoir, the president sought a vote
knowing he might lose, which would firmly demonstrate legislators' lack
of support for greater U.S. military involvement in the Middle East. (As
events played out, the issue became moot when, at Russia's prodding,
Syria pledged to give up its chemical weapons.) [**Congress is equally
reluctant to stand up to the president on trade.** Despite misgivings
over Trump's protectionist measures, Democratic and Republican
legislators have essentially given up on the issue]{.underline}. In
June, Bob Corker, the Tennessee Republican who chairs the Senate Foreign
Relations Committee, proposed a bill that would require the president to
seek [congressional approval for
tariffs](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/congress/gop-s-division-tariffs-erupts-senate-floor-n882581)
enacted in the name of national security. But he has not been able to
gain sufficient support for the measure from fellow Republicans, who,
with midterm elections looming, are reluctant to cross Trump. There
still are some dedicated foreign policy hands willing to fight to give
the legislative branch a voice. In 2017, for example, Congress managed
to impose additional sanctions on Russia against the president's wishes.
But **[overall, Congress has relinquished its authority on foreign
policy and trade to the executive branch]{.underline}**---and would have
trouble reclaiming it even if it wanted to.

[The president requires no proactive congressional input to conduct
foreign and defense policies]{.underline}, which create significant,
lasting changes to the world order. This is true of initiatives such as
forging a new, informal alliance among Egypt, Israel, Jordan, Saudi
Arabia, and the United Arab Emirates to counter Iran\'s role in the
Middle East. It is true of arming Kurdish forces to attack the Islamic
State (also known as ISIS). It is true of whatever deal the president
might choose to strike, or not strike, with Russia over the future of
Syria. It is true of efforts to secure additional defense spending by
NATO allies and to shape the tenor of the transatlantic alliance. And it
will be true of however the president might choose to address North
Korea\'s nuclear weapons program or the growing Chinese military
presence in the South China Sea. [In recent years, presidents have also
enjoyed an almost totally free hand in decisions to use military force
abroad, despite the considerable power the Constitution invests in the
legislative branch]{.underline}. In this regard, [Congress has utterly
failed to defend its constitutional prerogatives]{.underline}. Not since
2002, when Congress authorized the Iraq war, has it exercised its
self-created responsibilities under the War Powers Act. In 2011,
Congress sat idly by as the Obama administration conducted an
eight-month-long bombing campaign in Libya with the ridiculous legal
rationale that the attacks should not count as hostilities. And
[Congress has continued to sit idly by as Trump]{.underline}, like Obama
did before him, [expands the 2001 Authorization for Use of Military
Force beyond all recognition as he wages military campaigns in six
different countries]{.underline}. [There have been recent signs in
Congress of attempts to amend or revoke that 2001 authorization. But
none of these efforts is likely to make it to the president\'s
desk]{.underline} (at least not without the provision of a lengthy
period grandfathering the 2001 authorization), and if one did, it is
highly unlikely that Trump would sign it. Unlike in domestic policy
making, [there is no reason to expect deeper congressional involvement
in presidential decisions to use military force in the
future]{.underline}. As the face of war is shaped more and more by
standoff weapons, drones, and cyberwarfare, it seems less and less
likely that Congress will assert its role in authorizing military
actions. In Washington today, the conventional wisdom holds that Trump
is unlikely to finish 2017 with a strong record of policy
accomplishments. Yet should he continue to learn how to work with a
newly assertive Congress, he may defy that conventional wisdom. If he
emerges from the first session of the current Congress with a
health-care bill, a tax bill, several new budgetary priorities, the
elimination of numerous regulations, a new Supreme Court justice, a
growing economy, and no new conflicts around the world, who could fairly
judge this as anything but success? [But Trump would be wise to keep in
mind that there is no stronger force in American politics than a unified
Congress]{.underline}, by the design of the Constitution\'s framers. In
light of recent decades of congressional passivity, that may be
difficult to remember. But [if the administration heads down a path that
majorities in both political parties oppose, Trump could confront a
unified Congress, a body that possesses far more constitutional power
than the presidency. When Congress rises to its full height and decides
to act, it is fitted with the most expansive powers of any institution
in the U.S. government]{.underline}. President Richard Nixon learned
that fact the hard way. Those powers are latent, but they are always
available. And [they are a reminder to any president, including Trump,
that although executive power can be stretched and expanded, sometimes
very widely, there are limits beyond which it is not wise to
proceed.]{.underline}

In theory at least, common law adjudication need not involve repudiation
of precedents, only their refinement and adjustment through further
elaborations. Accordingly, gaps in predictability may be merely the
result of indeterminacies; the recourse to notions of fairness are meant
primarily to reassure the citizenry that the inevitably unpredictable
will never be unjust. [Constitutional adjudication, on the other hand,
while relying on precedents as part of its common law methodology, must
ultimately be faithful to the constitutional provision involved rather
than to the precedents.]{.underline} As a result, [when precedents
appear patently unfair or circumstances have changed significantly, the
U.S. Supreme Court is empowered---perhaps obligated pursuant to its
constitutional function---to overrule precedent, thus putting fairness
above predictability**.**]{.underline}60 For example, in its recent
decision in Lawrence v. Texas,61 the Supreme Court overruled its 1986
decision in Bowers v. Hardwick,62 which held that the due process clause
did not extend constitutional protection to homosexual sex among
consenting adults, thus upholding a law that criminalized such conduct.
More generally, [whenever a constitutional challenge raises a
significant question that could entail overruling a constitutional
precedent, the Supreme Court faces a choice between predictability and
fairness.]{.underline} American rule of law, like the Verfassungsstaat,
involves constitutional rule through law, but unlike the Rechtsstaat it
produces a rule through law where predictability is but one among
several, often antagonistic, elements. American rule of law ultimately
amounts to a complex, dynamic interplay between competing elements and
tendencies. Moreover, it appears, at least initially, that more than the
Rechtsstaat or the État de droit, American rule of law depends for its
viability on a broad based consensus regarding extralegal norms, such as
fairness and substantive notions of justice and equity. [Indeed, if
there is a consensus on what constitutes fairness or justice, then the
tensions between predictability and fairness, and between procedural and
substantive safeguards, seem entirely manageable, and the work of the
constitutional adjudicator more legal than political]{.underline}. [If,
on the contrary, there are profound disagreements over what is fair or
just, then the work of the constitutional adjudicator is bound to seem
unduly political]{.underline}. Accordingly, at least prima facie, the
task of the American constitutional adjudicator seems more delicate and
precarious than that of her continental counterpart.

[Overruling]{.underline} Roe\'s central holding [would not only reach an
unjustifiable result under stare decisis principles, but would seriously
weaken the Court\'s capacity to exercise the judicial power and to
function as the Supreme Court of a Nation dedicated to the rule of
law]{.underline}. Where the Court acts to resolve the sort of unique,
intensely divisive controversy reflected in Roe, its decision has a
dimension not present in normal cases, and is entitled to rare
precedential force to counter the inevitable efforts to overturn it and
to thwart its implementation. [Only the most convincing justification
under accepted standards of precedent could suffice to demonstrate that
a later decision overruling the first was anything but a surrender to
political pressure]{.underline} and an unjustified repudiation of the
principle on which the Court staked its authority in the first instance.
Moreover, [the country\'s loss of confidence in the Judiciary would be
underscored by condemnation for the Court\'s failure to keep faith with
those who support the decision]{.underline} at a cost to themselves. [A
decision to overrule]{.underline} Roe\'s essential holding under the
existing circumstances [would address error]{.underline}, if error there
was, [at the cost of both profound and unnecessary damage to the
Court\'s legitimacy and to the Nation\'s commitment to the rule of
law]{.underline}

#### Overturn of established legal precedent undermines legitimacy

//uxm

The \$64,000 question all last week, as Senators from both sides of the
aisle including Judiciary Chairman Arlen Specter (R-PA) and Joe Biden
(D-DE) grilled Roberts, was and continues to be how the soon-to-be Chief
views Roe and what if anything might he do to overturn it. A brilliant
legal mind and one of the most effortlessly masterful speakers (he blew
through the entire week without notes), Roberts, in saying very little,
might have said an awful lot. [After last week, the term \"stare
decisis\" has become part of America\'s lexicon. Translated to \"to
stand by things decided,\" it\'s the written code among jurists who
respect the precedents set in the prior opinions and rulings of other
judges and courts.]{.underline} And this is where Roberts may have
tipped his hat. In his 2003 federal appeals court confirmation hearings,
Roberts said of Roe \"it\'s a little more than settled. It was
reaffirmed in the face of a challenge that it should be overruled in the
Casey decision.\" [The majority opinion in Casey stated that to overrule
Roe \"under fire in the absence of the most compelling reason to
re-examine a watershed decision would subvert the court\'s legitimacy
beyond any serious question.\"]{.underline} And it is in referring to
Casey where Roberts shows some key cards: \"considerations of the
court\'s legitimacy are terribly important.\" He added that Casey
\"reaffirmed the central holding in Roe.\" [Roberts last week also
firmly reinforced the primacy of legal precedent: \"I do think that it
is a jolt to the legal system when you overrule a precedent. Precedent
plays an important role in promoting stability and
evenhandedness]{.underline}.\" And when asked directly by Specter if he
believed the Constitution provides for the right to privacy\--the
foundation of the Roe case\--Roberts replied \"I do.\" In the landmark
1965 case Griswold v. Connecticut, the Supreme Court ruled that the
Constitution protects the right of marital privacy against state
restrictions on a couple\'s ability to be counseled in the use of
contraceptives. [Roberts also believes that decided law which becomes
part of the nation\'s social fabric\--\"settled expectations\" as he
calls it\--should perhaps be left undisturbed.]{.underline} For example,
today\'s 30 year-old-women have lived their entire lives under legalized
abortion. They\'ve known nothing else. Overturning Roe therefore would
change the expectations of an entire generation of people.

[Legal historians suggest that justices in the 19th Century responded to
the crisis of legitimacy by strengthening the norm of stare
decisis]{.underline}, a legal norm inherited from English common law
that encourages judges to follow precedent by letting the past decision
stand ( Friedman, 1985, pp. 127--133). [In order to foster compliance
and enhance the institutional reputation of the Court, stare decisis was
implemented to place decision-making in the domain of neutral legal
principles and the "accumulated experience of many judges responding to
the arguments and evidence of many lawyers" ( Landes and Posner, 1976,
p. 250) rather than at the whim of the personal preferences of
individuals. To this day, the justices of the Supreme Court are aware of
the inherent weakness of the federal judiciary and place high value on
maintaining their institutional and decisional legitimacy through the
use of precedent]{.underline} (Ginsburg, 2004, Powell, 1990 and Stevens,
1983). [Recognizing that legitimacy is essential to achieve their policy
objectives, the members of the Court justify their substantive rulings
through court opinions, which allow the justices to demonstrate how
their decisions are consistent with existing legal rules and principles
established in prior cases]{.underline} (see Hansford and Spriggs, 2006,
pp. 24--30). Because it is the application of existing precedents that
creates the perception of judicial decision-making to be procedurally
neutral and fair ( Tyler and Mitchell, 1994), these opinions are often
considered to be the source of the Court\'s power ( Epstein and Knight,
1998 and Segal and Spaeth, 2002).

## Saudi Assurances

#### Security assurances are low now---Trump makes trust and partnerships impossible; he's done nothing but destroy trust

**Metz 7/4**/19 (Steven, \"The Flaws in Trump's Strategic Approach to
U.S. National Security,\" No Publication,
<https://www.worldpoliticsreview.com/articles/28006/the-flaws-in-trump-s-strategic-approach-to-u-s-national-security//DeepStateSisco>)

[Most of [America's security partnerships have eroded]{.mark}; some are
close to collapse]{.underline}. China and Russia are more assertive and
less constrained than they were a few years ago. The Trump
administration's "maximum pressure" campaigns against North Korea, Iran
and Venezuela have produced few tangible security gains and seem
unlikely to do so anytime soon. [[The major reason for this erosion of
American influence is Trump's style of leadership]{.underline}]{.mark}.
He dominates American statecraft to a degree unseen at least since the
presidency of Richard Nixon. But unlike Nixon, Trump came to the White
House with no experience in foreign or national security policy, little
grasp of history and limited understanding of statecraft. Conceivably,
things could turn around or at least get better. The United States could
repair its tattered security partnerships and become more effective if
Trump brings his approach into closer alignment with what history
suggests are the characteristics of effective strategy. This column will
discuss two of these characteristics; next week's, my final column for
WPR, will cover three additional ones. [Effective strategy begins by
understanding the perspective and priorities of others. So far Trump has
failed to do this]{.underline}, particularly for America's major
adversaries---Russia, China, Iran and North Korea. Those nations have a
deep sense of insecurity reflecting a history of outside intervention
and foreign invasion. They see the United States as the architect and
manager of a system that is stacked against them. Their conflicts with
the United States are not simply misunderstandings that leaders can fix
during summits, but manifestations of their desire to alter or overturn
the existing U.S.-dominated security system. For the United States, all
that is at stake in the conflict with these four adversaries is
influence and perhaps access to markets and resources. For Russia,
China, Iran and North Korea, by contrast, American power represents a
threat to their very survival---or at least the survival of their
regimes. Other than the nuclear forces of Russia and possibly China,
none of these adversaries can pose an existential threat to the United
States. By contrast, America, with its powerful military and history of
intervention, is an existential threat to them. Effective strategy
begins by understanding the perspective and priorities of others. So far
Trump has failed to do this, particularly for America's major
adversaries. Trump shows an equally debilitating misunderstanding of
America's security partners. He treats them as subordinates who should
implement U.S.-designed policies rather than as sovereign nations with
their own priorities and interests. [Like marriages, however,
[sustaining strategic partnerships requires effort, compromise and
coordination.]{.mark} So far [Trump has not acted accordingly]{.mark},
or at least has not done so as much as needed.]{.underline} [A second
characteristic of effective strategy is combining carrots and sticks in
pursuit of realistic objectives. Trump has come up short on all
counts]{.underline}. In dealing with Russia, he has not articulated
realistic objectives, such as an end to Moscow's meddling in America's
electoral process as well as those of America's European allies. He has
not brought an array of carrots and sticks to bear, instead focusing on
what seems to be a submissive personal relationship with Russia's
autocratic president, Vladimir Putin. With China, Trump has not
untangled or prioritized the intricate components of the relationship:
the importance of direct bilateral economic ties, the value of necessary
cooperation in dealing with North Korea, and the challenge of China's
increasingly militarized assertiveness. The result is a dangerous
dissonance where Trump seems mostly concerned with U.S.-China trade
policy, while the rest of the U.S. government focuses on the rising
military and intelligence threats from Beijing. Trump's dealings with
North Korea have vacillated wildly between sticks and carrots, rather
than using them in careful conjunction. At points he has trumpeted
"maximum pressure" and made threats, while at other times he has
promised U.S. investment and economic assistance if Kim Jong Un totally
abolishes his nuclear weapons and ballistic missile programs. But this
is a dead end, since what Kim sees as most vital to the survival of his
regime are an ability to deter U.S. military intervention and an ability
to control internal dissent with patronage. The two things most
dangerous to him, both politically and personally, would be
defenselessness against the United States and a vibrant economy where
the North Korean public and elites were less dependent on him. Yet that
is what Trump offers. [Trump's [strategy toward Iran has been]{.mark}
the most deeply flawed and [incoherent of all.]{.mark} He has expressed
his desire for the Iranian regime to behave differently in its region,
but also for the regime be overthrown or removed. He shows no [grasp of
the Iranian leadership's deep insecurity]{.mark} and makes no effort to
address it. Trump's strategy on Iran reflects the desires of Israel and
Saudi Arabia to pummel Tehran, but it is not aligned with key partners
in Europe or with Russia and China. It is based on "maximum pressure"
that requires multilateral coordination, but [Trump seems uninterested
in aligning positions and priorities to achieve
that.]{.mark}]{.underline}

#### 2. No Link-

#### b. Arms sales are not the key issue in assuring allies---boots on the ground strategy and training programs more important.

Similar to extended deterrence strategies, [U[.S. assurance strategies
also rely on a mix of]{.mark} conventional, nuclear, and missile defense
f[orces,]{.mark} enabled by space and cyber assets.]{.underline}
Conventional Forces. Documents such as the 2010 QDR state that [[the

[remains critically important]{.mark} to assuring U.S.
allies.]{.underline}228 For many U.S. friends abroad, [U.S. "[boots on

War, representing a tangible symbol of the United States' guarantee it
is willing to risk American lives for the sake of an ally's protection
against adversary aggression.]{.underline} [The United States also
assures allies through [combined training and exercises, programs and
activities that increase operability]{.mark}]{.underline}, and sales or
transfers of military equipment. These steps ensure that U.S. allies
believe both parties can act cohesively and decisively in the event of
conflict or crisis, rapidly countering adversary threats to their
security.

#### 3.No Saudi prolif---international disincentives 

**Burkhard 17** (Sarah - Research Fellow at the Institute For Science
And International Security & Erica Wenig & David Albright & Andrea
Stricker, "Saudi Arabia's Nuclear Ambitions and Proliferation Risks," p.
14-15, 3/30/17,
https://isis-online.org/uploads/isis-reports/documents/SaudiArabiaProliferationRisks_30Mar2017_Final.pdf)

Disincentives. Saudi Arabia is expected to continually weigh these
incentives to acquire advanced nuclear capabilities (which possibly
include the ability to weaponize fissile material and deliver a nuclear
weapon) against a considerable list of disincentives. For starters,
[Saudi Arabia would jeopardize its good standing in the international
community, which it has established through signing several treaties and
joining nonproliferation regimes.]{.underline} These include the NPT,
IAEA, Convention for the Suppression of Acts of Nuclear Terrorism,
Proliferation Security Initiative (PSI), Convention on the Physical
Protection of Nuclear Material (CPPNM), and 2005 amendment of the CPPNM.
Following the discovery of a covert program, [[Saudi Arabia would risk
severe]{.mark} United Nations and other countries' [sanctions.]{.mark}
While economic in nature, the sanctions take on a security dimension
because Saudi Arabia's economy is predominantly reliant on its oil
exports.]{.underline} They accounted for nearly 50 percent of gross
domestic product and about 85 percent of export earnings in 2015.39 [Its
imported reactors would also likely remain dependent on the supply of
low enriched uranium fuel. Therefore, a [targeted sanctions regime
focused on Saudi oil exports and imported nuclear fuel
could]{.mark}]{.underline} ~~cripple~~ [\[[devastate\] its
economy]{.mark} [and hurt its security]{.mark}.]{.underline} On the
other hand, the countries and organizations applying sanctions would
have to weigh their own significant energy and security demands against
concerns that Saudi Arabia could get advanced nuclear capabilities.
Saudi Arabia's contribution to the global oil market (which is roughly
three times greater than that of Iran) grants it substantial leverage in
determining global oil prices.40 As such, establishing a credible
sanctions regime targeting Saudi oil would pose a difficult choice for
the oil-dependent West. This will be particularly true if some in the
international community become sympathetic to a Saudi desire to obtain a
nuclear deterrent to balance Iran. [The threat of potential sanctions
would also carry great weight in Saudi Arabia's nuclear weapons calculus
as the [government is facing its largest budget deficit in
history]{.mark}.]{.underline} It is currently seeking to diversify its
energy usage in order to sell more oil abroad rather than use it
domestically at an expensive loss.41 If there is a decrease in revenue,
the Saudis would be unable to spend as much money balancing Iranian
influence in neighboring countries as they are now.

To help get across the challenge we're facing when it comes to weaning
humanity off fossil fuels, we've created a simulation where your goal is
to reduce the world's emissions to zero as soon as possible. You can
either disincentivize energy sources that produce carbon dioxide or
incentivize clean-energy sources, or some combination of both. The
projections are based on the open-source En-ROADS tool built by the
nonprofit Climate Interactive and MIT Sloan, which simulates the effect
subsidies and taxes have on energy use and carbon emissions.

As you may have gathered, [t[here is no way to achieve zero emissions

come to a complete halt]{.underline}]{.mark}**. (For coal, for example,
these would be in the range of ±\$80 per metric ton of CO2 emitted). You
need something else to reduce emissions. [Carbon-capture technologies

If you're still not convinced, consider this: there are a handful of
industries essential to the modern way of life that generate large
amounts of carbon dioxide as a side product of the chemistry of their
manufacturing process. These carbon-intensive industries---including
cement, steel, and ethanol---produce about 20% of all global emissions.
[[If we want to keep using these products and reach zero emissions, the
only option is to have these industries deploy carbon
capture.]{.underline}]{.mark}

And we need to reach zero emissions, not just in the energy sector, but
completely, across every industry and every part of the world. The last
time there was so much carbon dioxide in Earth's atmosphere was more
than 800,000 years ago, when the world's sea levels were 10 meters (30
ft) higher than today. Even conservative estimates of a 2°C world
suggest that by 2100 the oceans could rise more than one meter from
today's levels, which could displace as much as 10% of the world's
population[. It would also increase the frequency of heatwaves and
intensity of storms, while decreasing crop yields. It's not something we

supplied by the United States]{.underline}]{.mark}---a 500-pound
laser-guided bomb made by Lockheed Martin.

As it has done repeatedly when its air strikes kill civilians, the Saudi
coalition at first insisted that it had attacked a legitimate military
target. On August 11, Saudi Arabia's mission to the United Nations
claimed that the strike had "targeted Houthi leaders who were
responsible for recruiting and training young children, and then sending
them to battlefields." It did not provide evidence to support these
claims. Finally, after growing international condemnation, on September
1, the Saudis acknowledged that the attack was unjustified and vowed to
"hold those who committed mistakes" accountable.

In an interview with Axios in November, President Donald Trump said the
Saudis and their allies did not know how to use American weapons
properly. Asked if he was bothered that the Saudis had blown up a school
bus with a US-made bomb, Trump responded, "Bother's not strong enough.
That was basically people that didn't know how to use the weapon, which
is horrible." He called the bus attack a "horror show" and promised to
take up the matter with Saudi leaders. "I'll be talking about a lot of
things with the Saudis," Trump added, "but certainly I wouldn't be
having people that don't know how to use the weapons shooting at buses
with children."

[Trump's muddled answer reflected a narrative that has been gaining
traction for years among US officials and in sectors of the Western
media: that the Saudis and their allies in the Yemen war, especially the
United Arab Emirates, are killing civilians and destroying
infrastructure by mistake. But this is not true. The Saudi coalition has
targeted civilians and the country's infrastructure by design since it
intervened in Yemen's civil war in March 2015. It's not that the Saudis
and their allies don't know how to use American-made weapons or need
help in choosing targets---they're using them as intended. And American
officials have known this for years.]{.underline}

[On April 4, the House voted to end US military support for the
Saudi-led war in Yemen, finally approving a bill to restrain
presidential war powers that has taken years to pass both chambers of
Congress]{.underline}. The measure, which invoked the 1973 War Powers
Act and argued that Congress never authorized support for the Saudi
coalition, underscored growing anger over American involvement in a war
that has created the world's worst humanitarian crisis. [The vote was
also a rebuke to Trump for doubling down on his support for Saudi
Arabia's ruthless crown prince, Mohammed bin Salman, after Saudi agents
murdered journalist Jamal Khashoggi at the Saudi Consulate in Istanbul.
On April 16, Trump vetoed the bill]{.underline}, and supporters in
Congress did not have enough votes to override that veto.

O[ne of the most persistent false arguments advanced by Pentagon and
Trump administration officials against the congressional bill is that
American support is necessary to keep the Saudi coalition from killing
even more civilians.]{.underline} On April 29, Michael Mulroy, deputy
assistant defense secretary for the Middle East, told a Washington think
tank that US support is now limited to "side-by-side coaching to help
mitigate civilian casualties." He argued that if Congress was to
override Trump's veto of the War Powers Act resolution, this US
assistance would end. "If that happens, that's obviously not helping the
situation," Mulroy said at the Center for a New American Security.

[The Trump administration continues to insist that Saudi Arabia and the
UAE have tried to reduce civilian deaths and to enable humanitarian-aid
deliveries in Yemen, despite contradictory evidence documented by the
United Nations, human-rights groups,]{.underline} and, most recently,
former US officials who served in President Barack Obama's
administration. In September, [Secretary of State Mike Pompeo formally
assured Congress that the two US allies were trying to reduce civilian
deaths]{.underline}. Congress required the administration to make this
certification a condition for the Pentagon to continue providing
military assistance. But Pompeo's claim contradicted most other
independent reviews of the war, including a report issued in August by a
group of UN experts. The report found both the Saudi-led coalition and
rebel Houthi militia responsible for likely war crimes, but it blamed
the Saudis and their allies for killing far more civilians. "[[Coalition
air strikes]{.mark} have [caused most]{.mark} of the documented
[civilian casualties]{.mark},"]{.underline} the report said. "In the
past three years, such air strikes have hit residential areas, markets,
funerals, weddings, detention facilities, civilian boats, and even
medical facilities."

Saudi leaders and their allies have ignored American entreaties to
minimize civilian casualties since the war's early days. And, according
to recent testimony in Congress by two members of the Obama
administration, [US officials recognized as early as 2016 that top Saudi
and UAE leaders were not interested in reducing civilian
casualties]{.underline}. In little-noticed testimony to the House
Subcommittee on the Middle East, North Africa, and International
Terrorism in early March, the two former State Department officials
explained how deeply involved the United States has been in helping the
Saudis choose their targets in Yemen, creating "no-strike" lists, and
sending trainers to help avoid civilian casualties. The officials were
Dafna Rand, a former deputy assistant secretary of state, who is now a
vice president at Mercy Corps; and Jeremy Konyndyk, former director of
the USAID Office of US Foreign Disaster Assistance.

Rand testified that soon after the Saudis launched the war in 2015, and
civilian casualties started to mount, the State Department sent a
trainer to Riyadh to work with Saudi Defense Ministry officials. She
said the trainer had worked with the US military's Central Command to
reduce civilian casualties in Afghanistan, and US officials had thought
the Saudis could use similar techniques to reduce casualties in Yemen.
"We approached this very technically behind closed doors, very quietly,
sent our trainer in," Rand said, adding that, after a cease-fire in
2016, US officials were hopeful that their efforts were paying off. But
once the cease-fire collapsed in August 2016, the Saudi coalition
attacked a series of civilian targets that caused mass casualties. At
that point, Rand said, "it gave us pause to recalibrate the strategy,
and wonder what had happened to our training." The State Department
continued to quietly send the trainer to Riyadh.

But Rand and other [officials soon realized that top [Saudi leaders were
not interested in limiting civilian casualties, despite American
appeals]{.mark}. She [said Saudi leaders only cared if the
president]{.mark}---first Obama and later Trump---[applied pressure or
threatened to suspend weapons sales]{.mark}]{.underline}. Rand did not
mention Mohammed bin Salman, who was then the deputy crown prince and
Saudi defense minister and a major architect of the Yemen war. "We came
to the conclusion by late 2016 that although there were very many
well-meaning and professional generals in the Saudi Ministry of Defense,
there was a lack of political will at the top senior levels to reduce
the number of civilian casualties," she said.

agencies' statutory authority is sometimes tested through litigation.
When courts review challenges to agency actions, they give special
consideration to agencies' interpretations of the statutes they

I grew up with the sights, sounds and smells of the Bradford oil fields
in New York state. My parents' small farm was over a small oil pool,
with fumes from unplugged wells in the air and small oil seeps coating
still waters. Before college, I worked these oil fields as a roustabout,
mainly cleaning pipes and casings. Like me, most people living in such
areas are not opposed to drilling, it seems. In my experience, such as
during the recent hearings for the Pennsylvania Governor's Marcellus
Shale Advisory Commission, activists from non-drilling regions outnumber
those from drilling regions by approximately two to one. Modern, massive
hydraulic fracturing is very different from that used decades ago.
Larger pads are required to accommodate larger drill rigs, pumps and
water supplies. People usually infer from this that modern techniques
have a greater impact on the environment. This isn't necessarily true.
Although more water is used per well, there are far fewer wells per unit
area. In the Bradford oil fields in the 1950s, a 640-acre parcel of land
might have held more than 100 wells, requiring some 18 kilometres of
roads, and with a lattice of surface pipelines. During the Marcellus
development today, that same parcel of land is served by a single pad of
five acres, with a 0.8-kilometre right-of-way for roads and pipelines.
[Although 'fracking' has emerged as a scare term in the press hydraulic
fracturing is not so strange or frightening. The process happens
naturally: high-pressure magma, water, petroleum and gases deep inside
Earth can crack rock, helping to drive plate tectonics, rock
metamorphism and the recycling of carbon dioxide between the mantle and
the atmosphere.]{.underline} Oil and gas have their origins in muds rich
with organic matter in lowoxygen water bodies. Over millions of years,
some of these deposits were buried and 'cooked' in the deep Earth,
turning the organic matter into fossil fuel and the mud to shale rocks.
In many areas, natural hydraulic fracturing allowed a large portion of
oil and gas to escape from the dense, impermeable shale and migrate into
neighbouring, more porous rocks. Some of this fossil fuel was trapped by
cap rock, creating the conventional reserves that mankind has long
tapped. [The groundwater above areas that host such conventional
deposits naturally contains methane, thanks to **natural hydraulic
fracturing** of the rock and the upward seeping of gas into the water
table over long time periods]{.underline}. More than 96% of all oil and
gas has been released from its original source rocks; **[industrial
hydraulic fracturing aims to mimic nature to access the
rest.]{.underline}** As in nature, industrial fracking can be done with
a wide variety of gases and liquids. Nitrogen can be used to open cracks
in the shale, for example. But this is inefficient, because of the
energy lost by natural decompression of the nitrogen gas. Water is more
efficient, because very little energy is wasted in decompression. Sand
is added to prop open the cracks, and compounds such as surface-tension
reducers are added to improve gas recovery

#### Toxic dangers all solved.

Two main environmental concerns are water use and water contamination.
Millions of gallons of water are required to stimulate a well. In
Pennsylvania, high rainfall means that water is abundant, and
regulations ensure that operators stockpile rainwater during the wet
season to use during drier months (thus the injection of massive volumes
of water in the Bradford oil fields for secondary recovery of oil, once
the well pressure has fallen, flew under the radar of environmentalists
for half a century). Obtaining adequate water for industrial fracking in
dry regions such as the Middle East and western China is a local
concern, but is no reason for a global moratorium. Press reports often
repeat strident concerns about the [chemicals added to fracking fluids.
But many of these compounds are relatively benign]{.underline}. One
commonly used additive is similar to simethicone, which is also used in
antacids to reduce surface tension and turn small bubbles in the stomach
into larger ones that can move along more easily. Many of the industrial
additives are common in household products. [Material safety data sheets
for these additives are required by US regulation. Industry discloses
additives on a website called FracFocus.org, run by state
regulators]{.underline}.

[Some people have expressed worries that fracking fluids might migrate
more than 2 kilometres upwards from the cracked shale into
groundwater]{.underline}. [The Ground Water Protection
Council]{.underline}, a non-profit national association of state
groundwater and underground-injection control agencies headquartered in
Oklahoma City, [has found no instance in which injected fluid
contaminated groundwater from below2. This makes sense: water cannot
flow this distance uphill in timescales that matter. This is the premise
by which deep disposal wells, used to hold toxic waste worldwide, are
considered safe]{.underline}. During gas production, the pressure of
methane is reduced: this promotes downward, not upward flow of these
fluids. Gas shale contains a number of materials that are carried back
up the pipe to the surface in flowback water, including salts of barium
and radioactive isotopes, that might be harmful in concentrated form.
According to a recent New York Times analysis, these elements can be
above the US Environmental Protection Agency's sanctioned background
concentrations in some flowback tanks. [Industry is moving towards
complete recycling of these fluids so this should be of less concern to
the public. However, production water will continue to flow to the
surface in modest volumes throughout the life of a well; this water
needs to be, and currently is, treated to ensure safe
disposal]{.underline}. [The real risk of water contamination comes from
these flowback fluids leaking into streams or seeping down into
groundwater after reaching the surface]{.underline}. [This can be caused
by leaky wellheads, holding tanks or blowouts. Wellheads are made
sufficiently safe to prevent this eventuality; holding tanks can be made
secure; and blowouts, while problematic, are like all accidents caused
by human error --- an unpredictable risk with which society
lives.]{.underline}

Although methane coming up to the surface within the steel well pipe
cannot escape into the surrounding rocks or groundwater, it is possible
that the cement seal between the well and the bedrock might allow
methane from shallow sandstone layers (rather than the reservoir deep
below) to seep up into groundwater. Methane is a tasteless and odourless
component of groundwater that can be consumed without ill effect when
dissolved. It is not a poison. [Long before gas-shale drilling,
regulators warned that enclosed spaces, such as houses, should be
properly ventilated in areas with naturally occurring methane in
groundwater]{.underline}. An alarm has been sounded too about the effect
of escaped methane on global warming. The good news is that methane has
a very short half-life in the atmosphere: carbon dioxide emitted during
the building of the first Sumerian cities is still affecting our
climate, whereas escaped methane from the fracturing of the Barnett
shale in 1997 is more than half gone. Industry can and should take steps
to reduce air emissions, by capturing or flaring methane and converting
motors and compressors from diesel to natural gas. Risk perception is
ultimately subjective: facts are all too easily combined with emotional
responses. [With hydraulic fracturing, as in many cases, fear levels
exceed the evidence.]{.underline}

## Court Key

#### Clear rulings key to legal clarity---key to solve the net benefit

**Bradford 90** \[Steven Bradford, Nebraska Law Professor, 1990,
FOLLOWING DEAD PRECEDENT: THE SUPREME COURT\'S ILL-ADVISED REJECTION OF
ANTICIPATORY OVERRULING, Fordham Law Review, Lexis,
<https://digitalcommons.unl.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1080&context=lawfacpub>\]

[The problem for lower courts is not that the Supreme Court overrules
its own precedent;]{.underline} that is inevitable[. The problem is the
Court\'s failure to do so candidly and certainly]{.underline}. [A court
may avoid its own precedent in a number of ways]{.underline} without
openly acknowledging it, and a court may openly overrule its own
precedent without acknowledging the full extent of the doctrinal shift.
Karl Llewellyn\'s famous list of techniques for dealing with precedent
includes at least thirteen ways to avoid a precedent without expressly
overruling it. 1 66 A court can distinguish the precedent on its facts,
interpret the old rule so that the new case falls outside of the rule,
limit or dismiss its broadest statement as dictum, or simply ignore the
old rule. Similarly, a court can overtly overrule a prior precedent in
ways that less directly attack the quality of the original ruling.167
The court may argue that changed conditions have undermined the basis of
the original ruling. 168 The court may rely on what Professor Israel
calls the \"lesson of experience\"-the difficulties experienced in
applying the old rule. 169 Finally, the court may claim that the
precedent overruled is inconsistent with subsequent decisions by the
court. 170 [All of these techniques have costs]{.underline}.
[Uncertainty results when]{.underline}, as in McMahon, [the Supreme
Court refuses to openly acknowledge the jurisprudential impact of its
decision]{.underline}, [generating what one scholar calls \"a labyrinth
of anomalies.]{.underline}\"\' 7\' As Justice Douglas once wrote,
\"\[y\]ears of litigation may be needed to rid the law of mischievous
decisions which should have fallen with the first of the series to be
overruled.\"\'\' 72 [This gradual process of erosion, not the departure
from stare decisis, creates the problem that courts seek to
solve]{.underline} through anticipatory overruling.\' 73 A return to a
rigid rule of stare decisis is not needed. Rather, [the Supreme Court
should openly and candidly acknowledge whether it is rejecting a prior
precedent and state plainly the doctrinal changes it is
making]{.underline}.174

#### **Courts key in allowing executive as the "sole organ"**

In the relationship between the political branches, **[the one-voice
doctrine has largely]{.underline}**, though not exclusively, **[been
used to expand presidential power]{.underline}**. The Court\'s most
famous invocation of one-voice principles in this context occurred in
*United States* *v. Curtiss-Wright Export Corp*., a case in which
Congress had authorized the President to criminalize certain arms sales
to the South American states involved in the Chaco War.\" Citing John

Representatives**,\" [[the Court in Curtiss-Wright designated the
President as \"the sole organ of the federal government in the field of
international relations]{.underline}]{.mark}**[.]{.underline}\"\"
Descriptions of the President as the \"sole organ\" or \"nation\'s
organ\" in foreign affairs slightly alter the one-voice metaphor but
substantively form part of the one-voice doctrine. 6 1 Curtiss-Wright
thus energized the doctrine in a powerful way. Curtiss-Wright has been
discredited in many ways, including for its reliance on Marshall\'s
speech.6 2 Nonetheless, its sole organ dictum has defied demise.\"

The U.S. [**Supreme Court's interpretation of the Commerce Clause has
shifted many times**]{.underline} throughout American history.1 At times
the power has been limited in nature, and at other times very
expansive.2 In the last twenty years the expansive nature of the
Commerce Clause power has come under scrutiny.3 **[The future of
Commerce Clause jurisprudence is still somewhat questionable, due to the
fact that the Court has carved out various nuances to what the power
covers]{.underline}.4 [These decisions have led to constitutional
challenges of several legislative regimes]{.underline}**.5 These
challenges include the challenge of the Sex Offender Registration and
Notification Act as being outside of the scope of Commerce Clause
power.6 **[The recent Commerce Clause jurisprudence]{.underline}, [in
combination with the upholding of the Affordable Care Act on Tax and
Spend grounds rather than Commerce Clause]{.underline}** grounds,
**[further leads to questions regarding the future of Commerce Clause
power]{.underline}**.7 This Note argues that the federal registration
requirement incorporated into the Sex Offender Registration and
Notification Act, given the recent course of interpretive limitations,
in combination with the Affordable Care Act decision, falls outside of
the scope of the Commerce Clause.8 The first part of this Note explores
the legislative history of the Sex Offender Registration and
Notification Act, the constitutional challenges that resulted therefrom,
and the history of the Commerce Clause that brings into question the
constitutionality of the registration requirements.9 Part II discusses
United States v. Kebodeaux and NFIB v. Sebelius and why these recent
decisions bring the constitutionality of the federal registration
requirement into question and reveal a new perspective to many Circuit
Court decisions regarding SORNA.10 Part III discusses the consequences
of this federal overstep and the infringement on states' rights as well
as individual liberties.11 II. SORNA: History, Construction, and
Constitutional Questions A. Legislative History [**The Sex Offender
Registration and Notification** Act (**SORNA)12 has been controversial
from a constitutional perspective since its passage in
2006**]{.underline}.13 SORNA was enacted as a part of the Adam Walsh
Child Protection and Safety Act of 2006.14 This law replaced the Jacob
Wetterling Crimes Against Children and Sexually Violent Offender
Registration Act of 1994 (Wetterling Act).15 The Wetterling Act provided
that the U.S. Attorney General would promulgate guidelines for states to
follow when implementing state-run registration systems for convicted
sex offenders.16 In 1996, the addition of Megan's Law to this Act made
federal funding for state law enforcement dependent on the creation of
state databases for the registration of sex offenders.17 The federal
funding for these registration programs was not dependent on states
requiring past offenders to register within the new system
retroactively.18 By the year 2000, every state and the District of
Columbia had functional sex offender registrations.19 **[SORNA replaced
a patchwork of state registration systems and guidelines and required
convicted sex offenders to register according to uniform federal
guidelines]{.underline}.20 [SORNA did not expand on the registration
requirements for past offenders, but instead directed the Attorney
General to promulgate registration requirements]{.underline}**.21
Attorney General Alberto Gonzalez issued a regulation on February 28,
2007, which explicitly applied SORNA's registration requirements to
those who were convicted prior to the passage of SORNA.22 The failure to
register according to the federal registration requirements resulted for
the first time in a federal criminal penalty.23 B. Section 16913
[Section 16913 of SORNA provides: (a) In general: A sex offender shall
register, and keep the registration current, in each jurisdiction where
the offender resides, where the offender is an employee, and where the
offender is a student]{.underline}. For initial registration purposes
only, a sex offender shall also register in the jurisdiction in which
convicted if such jurisdiction is different from the jurisdiction of
residence. (b) Initial registration: The sex offender shall initially
register--- (1) before completing a sentence of imprisonment with
respect to the offense giving rise to the registration requirement; or
(2) not later than 3 business days after being sentenced for that
offense, if the sex offender is not sentenced to a term of imprisonment.
(c) Keeping the registration current: A sex offender shall, not later
than 3 business days after each change of name, residence, employment,
or student status, appear in person in at least 1 jurisdiction involved
pursuant to subsection (a) of this section and inform that jurisdiction
of all changes in the information required for that offender in the sex
offender registry. That jurisdiction shall immediately provide that
information to all other jurisdictions in which the offender is required
to register.24 This section sets forth the registration requirements.25
It is important to note that § 16913 contains no interstate
jurisdictional component to the registration requirement.26 This section
defines who qualifies as a sex offender, and also sets forth the
three-day time constraint on registration.27 This section is also
separated from the component of SORNA that contains the punishment for
failure to register, § 2250. C. Section 2250 Section 2250 of SORNA
provides that whoever (1) is required to register under the Sex Offender
Registration and Notification Act; (2)(A) is a sex offender as defined
for the purposes of the Sex Offender Registration and Notification Act
by reason of a conviction under Federal law (including the Uniform Code
of Military Justice), the law of the District of Columbia, Indian tribal
law, or the law of any territory or possession of the United States; or
(B) travels in interstate or foreign commerce, or enters or leaves, or
resides in, Indian country; and (3) knowingly fails to register or
update a registration as required by the Sex Offender Registration and
Notification Act; shall be fined under this title or imprisoned not more
than 10 years, or both.28 Section 2250 is the part of the Act that
provides for the criminal prosecution of those who fail to register in
accordance with § 16913.29 This provision requires the definitions and
requirements as set forth in § 16913.30 In Carr v. United States, 31 the
Supreme Court explained, "Section 2250 is not a stand-alone response to
the problem of missing sex offenders; it is imbedded in a broader
statutory scheme enacted to address the deficiencies in prior law that
had enabled sex offenders to slip through the cracks."32 In that same
case the Court also considered that § 2250 and § 16913 were enacted with
different policies in mind.33 The Court noted that knowing the purpose
behind the enactment of § 16913 "tells us little about the specific
policy choice Congress made in enacting § 2250."34 **[The question
remains as to whether the provisions]{.underline} in § 2250 [properly
regulate the registration requirements of § 16913]{.underline}. 35 D.
[Nondelegation Doctrine Challenges These regulations resulted in
numerous challenges under the nondelegation doctrine, but the law was
unanimously upheld]{.underline}**.36 Many defendants argued that the
statute's delegation of the authority to promulgate these registration
requirements to the Attorney General was not done with an intelligible
principle that the Attorney General had to follow.37 **[Circuit courts
that have addressed this issue have unanimously held that the statute's
delegation of authority to decide whether SORNA registration
requirements applied retroactively was within Congress's discretion, and
that the Act laid out a sufficiently intelligible
principle]{.underline}**.38 [These decisions could reflect the judicial
branch's deference to the legislature on issues of delegation of
power]{.underline}. \[Fn 39\] See Mistretta v. United States, 488 U.S.
361, 372 (1989) ("[Applying this 'intelligible principle' test to
congressional delegations, our jurisprudence has been driven by a
practical understanding that in our increasingly complex society,
replete with ever changing and more technical problems, Congress simply
cannot do its job absent an ability to delegate power under broad
general directives]{.underline}.") \[End Fn 39\] It is unclear, however,
whether the Supreme Court would hold unanimously that SORNA would
withstand a nondelegation challenge.40 All of these cases were denied
certiorari.41 E. Ex Post Facto Challenges The February 28, 2007
regulation was also challenged on ex post facto grounds as extending
punishment to those who were found guilty prior to the passage of
SORNA.42 The Constitution in Article I section 10 provides, "No state
shall . . . pass any . . . ex post facto law."43 Challengers argued that
being punished for failing to register for crimes committed before the
passage of SORNA in 2006 violated their rights under this clause.44
Circuit courts upheld SORNA in the face of these challenges as well,45
insisting that the registration requirements imposed by SORNA were not
meant to be punitive, but rather were civil penalties for the benefit of
informing the public of safety concerns.46 The statute punished
individuals not for their past sex offenses, but for their current
failure to register.47 F. Commerce Clause Challenges **[The Commerce
Clause gives Congress the power "\[t\]o regulate Commerce with foreign
nations, and among the several States]{.underline}.**"48 The heart of
this challenge to the registration requirement in [SORNA]{.underline} is
that it [requires action to be taken even if the crime is purely
local]{.underline}.49 [This argument stems from the three distinct
categories of Congress's regulatory authority under the Commerce Clause:
regulation of channels, regulation of instrumentalities, and regulation
of activities that have a substantial effect on interstate
commerce]{.underline}.50 The Commerce Clause challenges have also failed
to overturn the registration requirements of SORNA in most instances.51
These courts determine that the registration of sex offenders falls
within Congress's jurisdiction with regard to channels and
instrumentalities of commerce.52 There remains, however, some question
as to whether Congress overstepped its Commerce Clause authority in
enacting the criminal penalty in SORNA.53 In United States v. Powers, 54
the court determined that the issue of sex offender registration fell
outside of the realm of the instrumentalities or channels of interstate
commerce.55 The court determined that this issue must then fall within
the third category--- substantial relationship to interstate commerce.56
The court in Powers determined that there was not a substantial
relationship to interstate commerce, and that the law's mere mention of
interstate travel did not amount to a sufficient nexus to commerce to
give Congress authority to enact this legislation.57 This case was
vacated and remanded at the appellate level, but it still provided a
compelling argument against the constitutionality of SORNA.58 The
Commerce Clause issue was denied certiorari on March 1, 2010.59 G.
History of Commerce Clause Jurisprudence [The history of Commerce Clause
jurisprudence can be broken into three broad eras]{.underline}.60 [In
the]{.underline} first era, the [Lochner era, the Court took a formalist
approach to Commerce Clause jurisprudence]{.underline}.61 During this
time, the Commerce Clause was dealt with in the literal sense, and it
was not clear whether even activities like mining62 or regulation of
labor63 would be included in the nation's understanding of Congress's
power to regulate commerce because they were not interstate and not
commerce in the traditional sense.64 **[In the Lochner era, there was an
emphasis on the economic rights of individuals, and governmental
regulation of working conditions or hours infringed on these individual
economic rights]{.underline}.65 [This approach to the Commerce Clause
power led to the Court striking down large swaths of federal
legislation, such as aspects of the New
Dea]{.underline}**[l]{.underline}.66 Next came [the expansive era of
Commerce Clause jurisprudence]{.underline}.67 During this era the powers
of Congress under the Commerce Clause were greatly expanded.68 The
Commerce Clause in combination with the Necessary and Proper Clause
[gave rise to the government being able to regulate manufacturing,69
labor,70 and even purely local and noncommercial activity that in the
aggregate would affect interstate commerce]{.underline}.71 [The Court
deemphasized the economic liberties of the Lochner era, and the new
scheme of authority under the Commerce Clause encompassed these
activities previously though, to be outside of Congress's
reach]{.underline}.72 [The Commerce Clause was]{.underline} not
[used]{.underline} to strike down legislation, but rather [as a catalyst
enabling the federal government to enact sweeping reforms like New Deal
legislation and the Civil Rights Act]{.underline}.73 [The Rehnquist
Court]{.underline} later [revived restrictions on Commerce Clause
legislation in]{.underline} what is called [the new federalism
era]{.underline}.74 This Court reverted back to a more conservative
reading of the Commerce Clause and [emphasized that the police powers
are reserved for the states]{.underline}.75 Cases during Chief Justice
Rehnquist's tenure overturned laws criminalizing very specific actions,
such as possession, that were purely local and in no way related to
interstate commerce through a jurisdictional nexus.76 In the new
federalism era [the Court specifically addressed criminal statutes that
were not substantially related to interstate commerce]{.underline}.77 In
the first of these cases, United States v. Lopez, 78 the Court reviewed
the Gun Free School Zones Act of 1990, which criminalized the possession
of a firearm in a school zone.79 The Court concluded that "the proper
test requires an analysis of whether the regulated activity
'substantially affects' interstate commerce."80 Under this test, the
mere possession of a firearm within a school zone did not meet the
standard of substantially affecting interstate commerce.81 The language
of the statute was too broad to limit the application to cases where it
could be proven that the gun traveled through interstate commerce and
the Act failed to withstand the Commerce Clause challenge.82 In
considering the consequences of the decision in Lopez, the Court
reasoned, Admittedly, a determination whether an intrastate activity is
commercial or noncommercial may in some cases result in legal
uncertainty. But, [so long as Congress' authority is limited to those
powers enumerated in the Constitution, and so long as those enumerated
powers are interpreted as having judicially enforceable outer limits,
congressional legislation under the Commerce Clause always will engender
"legal uncertainty]{.underline}."83 This was the first time in almost
sixty years that the Court declared a federal law unconstitutional as
exceeding the scope of the Commerce Clause power.84 [The Court then
added to new federalism in its holding in United States v. Morrison. 85
The question before the Court was whether the civil damages provision of
the Violence Against Women Act was constitutional]{.underline}.86 The
statute at issue in Morrison differed from the statute in Lopez because
the Violence Against Women Act included significant congressional
findings regarding the overall economic impact that violence against
women has on society.87 Despite these findings, **[the Court still found
that there was not a sufficient connection to interstate commerce to
warrant Commerce Clause authority]{.underline}**.88 The Court
"reject\[ed\] the argument that Congress may regulate noneconomic,
violent criminal conduct based solely on that conduct's aggregated
effect on interstate commerce. The Constitution requires a distinction
between what is truly national and what is truly local."89 **[This
holding narrowed Lopez by limiting what Congress could regulate even
when it provides findings that show a substantial effect on interstate
commerce if it is noneconomic in nature]{.underline}**.90 In response to
congressional findings that violence against women does have a
substantial impact on commerce and therefore could be regulated by
Congress, [the Court writes, The reasoning that petitioners advance
seeks to follow the but-for causal chain from the initial occurrence of
violent crime]{.underline} (the suppression of which has always been the
prime object of the States' police power) [to every attenuated effect
upon interstate commerce]{.underline}. If accepted, [petitioners'
reasoning would allow Congress to regulate any crime as long as the
nationwide, aggregated impact of that crime has substantial effects on
employment, production, transit, or consumption]{.underline}. Indeed, if
Congress may regulate gender-motivated violence, it would be able to
regulate murder or any other type of violence since gender-motivated
violence, as a subset of all violent crime, is certain to have lesser
economic impacts than the larger class of which it is a part.91 More
recently, the Court in [Gonzalez v. Raich]{.underline}92 [called into
question just how much staying power this more stringent Commerce Clause
jurisprudence had]{.underline}.93 [The Court carved out an exception for
regulating goods that never enter interstate commerce when the
regulation is part of a scheme that clearly meets the jurisdictional
nexus to interstate commerce]{.underline}.94 This [left open the issue
of whether this revival of Commerce Clause invalidations would
continue]{.underline} or whether they were simply a blip on the screen
of Commerce Clause jurisprudence. \[Fn 95\] See LaCroix, supra note 60,
at 2049--50 ("\[[T\]**he Supreme Court's 'federalism revolution' has . .
. shifted from its . . . inquiry into the scope of Congress's power to
regulate interstate commerce, refracted through the Tenth Amendment, to
become an inquiry into the transsubstantive reasons for allowing
Congress to regulate at all**]{.underline}."); id. ("This transformation
has been especially significant when the Court views Congress as
venturing into a domain not explicitly specified in the text of Article
I.") \[End Fn 95\] This question seemed to be answered, at least in
part, by the Court's reliance on the Tax and Spend Clause---rather than
the Commerce Clause---to validate the Affordable Care Act.96 It appears
that the narrower reading of the Commerce Clause under the Rehnquist era
has not been completely abandoned.97

A [recurring theme throughout the Rehnquist Court's federalism decisions
is the need to maintain judicially enforceable limits on federal
power]{.underline}. 109 These limits, even if rather modest, are
[necessary to maintain the underlying constitutional structure of
limited, separated, and enumerated powers]{.underline}. Thus, in Lopez,
the Court stressed that the federal government failed to offer any limit
on the asserted scope of Congress's commerce power.110 Although the
Rehnquist Court was willing to uphold an expansive conception of federal
authority, there needed to be a limit. While the Rehnquist Court's
rhetoric stressed the need for limits, [the Court's seeming reluctance
to enforce these limits with much rigor left some doubt as to whether
the rhetoric was believable]{.underline}. After all, even during the New
Deal, [the Court]{.underline} often reiterated the need to keep
congressional authority within constitutional bounds, even as it
[approved one expansive exercise of federal authority after
another]{.underline}.\* 111 By the time of the Great Society, the Court
had little difficulty approving expansive assertions of federal power.
112 Against this backdrop, [it was easy to read Lopez and the Rehnquist
Court's other federalism decisions as minor exceptions to a general rule
permitting Congress to exercise expansive federal power]{.underline}.113
Lower courts, already reluctant to invalidate federal statutes for
exceeding the scope of Congress's enumerated powers, certainly took this
view. Other than the Fourth Circuit,114 no appellate court struck down a
federal statute on Commerce Clause grounds between 1995 and 2000,115 and
Morrison did little to change this pattern.116

opinion authored by Judge Anne Claire Williams of the Seventh Circuit
Court of Appeals, Heinz v. Cent. Laborers\' Pension Fund, 303 F.3d 802,
Decided September 13, 2002)

[We conclude that plaintiffs\' loss of the option of working as

retirement [benefits]{.underline} within the meaning of § 1054(g)(2).
HN6 [A participant\'s [**benefits** **cannot be understood without**

on the **receipt** of the benefit \"**reduces**\" the benefit **just as

payment. [We **have not before** interpreted]{.mark}]{.underline} the
prohibition in [[the]{.underline}]{.mark} anti-cutback [[rule as limited
to amendments that reduce the **amount**]{.underline}]{.mark} of the
periodic payment, [[and we find **nothing**]{.mark} in the

held that the plaintiffs had stated a claim for violation of § 1054(g)
when they alleged that a \[\*806\] plan amendment changed the deadline
by which the employee must retire in order to receive supplemental early
retirement benefits. 96 F.3d at 1036-37; see also Bellas v. CBS, Inc.,
221 F.3d 517 (3d Cir. 2000) (plan amendment that changed eligibility
requirements for early retirement benefits violated § 1054(g)).
Similarly, in Michael v. Riverside Cement Co. Pension Plan, 266 F.3d
1023, 1027-28 (9th Cir. 2001), the Ninth Circuit held that an amendment
that eliminated the plan\'s \"no-offset rule,\" which had allowed a
participant to receive full early retirement benefits without regard to
the amount he already received upon previous retirement, violated §
1054(g) even though the amendment increased the plaintiff\'s monthly
benefit payment. Cf. Hickey, 980 F.2d at 468 (7th Cir. 1992) (plan
amendment that eliminated the particiant\'s right to cost-of-living
adjustments violated the anti-cutback rule). [The Fund argues
that]{.underline} [these cases are **distinguishable** because a change
in the **eligibility requirements**]{.underline}, as in Ahng \[\*\*11\]
[for example, **differs** from a change in the **conditions triggering

**permanently reduces** benefits or **eliminates** certain]{.underline}

monthly benefit [payments for participants who take certain jobs after
retirement and \"**reduces**\" the participant\'s **total**]{.underline}

the]{.underline} [disqualifying]{.underline} work [continues. Plaintiffs
**lost** a valuable right they had earned **before**]{.underline} the

our judgment, **this was a reduction**]{.mark} of]{.underline} early
retirement [benefits within the **plain meaning**]{.underline} of §
1054(g)(2). 6Link to the text of the note \[\*\*13\] \[\*807\] B. Spacek
v. Maritime Association The Fund points out, however, that
\"suspensions\" are not identified along with the prohibitions against
decreases, reductions, and elimination of benefits in the anti-cutback
rule. The Fund relies on Spacek v. Maritime Ass\'n, 134 F.3d 283 (5th
Cir. 1998), in which the Fifth Circuit concluded that an amendment like
the one in this case did not violate the anti-cutback rule because it
concerned a \"suspension\" and not a \"reduction\" in benefits. 7Link to
the text of the note The Fifth Circuit supported its conclusion with:
(1) an examination of the use of the two terms under the statute and
related regulations; (2) the legislative history of the Retirement
Equity Act; and (3) a Treasury regulation concerning the effect of
suspensions on \"accrued benefits.\" We respectfully conclude, however,
that the Fifth Circuit\'s arguments do not support its conclusion.
\[\*\*14\] 1. Suspensions and reductions under ERISA. In Spacek, the
court noted that \"throughout the statute and corresponding regulations,
the concepts of reduction of benefits and suspension of benefit payments
are used in distinct ways, often within a single provision.\" 134 F.3d
at 288-89 (citing 29 U.S.C. §§ 1441(a), 1341a(d) & 1342(d)(1)(A)(v); 29
C.F.R. § 2520.104b-4(a)(1)(iii)). From this the court reasoned that to
interpret the prohibition in the anti-cutback rule against amendments
that reduce benefits as applying to suspensions would \"make the word
\'suspension\' redundant in all of these statutory provisions and
interpretive regulations.\" Spacek, 134 F.3d at 289. This redundancy,
according to Spacek, would violate the canon of statutory construction
that every word in a statute must be given meaning. Id. We disagree with
the inference that Spacek draws from the various provisions that refer
to both reductions and suspensions. Our interpretation of the
anti-cutback rule does not suggest that all suspensions are
\"reductions\" (or vice versa), only that if the suspension is pursuant
\[\*\*15\] to an amendment that reduces benefits (attributable to
service before the amendment), then it is a reduction within the
anti-cutback rule. This interpretation does not render the word
\"suspension\" in the other provisions redundant. For example, Spacek
relies on various provisions in Title IV of ERISA (relating to
financially troubled and terminated plans) that refer to both
\"reduction of benefits\" and \"suspension of benefit payments\";
according to Spacek, to avoid redundancy, the former phrase must be
construed as excluding the latter. Id. But Spacek\'s identification of
the two relevant phrases is too narrow; to the extent the Title IV
provisions identify two separate categories, they are amendments that
reduce benefits on the one hand, and suspension \[\*808\] of benefit
payments, on the other. Section 1441, governing plan terminations, is
typical: (a) Amendment of plan by plan sponsor to reduce benefits, and
suspension of benefit payments Notwithstanding sections 1053 and 1054 of
this title, the plan sponsor of a terminated multiemployer plan to which
section 1341a(d) of this title applies shall amend the plan to reduce
benefits, and shall suspend \[\*\*16\] benefit payments, as required by
this section. 29 U.S.C. § 1441(a) (emphasis added) 8Link to the text of
the note \[\*\*17\] ;see also 29 U.S.C. § 1425(a)(1) & 26 U.S.C. §
418D(a)(1) (plans in reorganization may amend the plan to reduce
benefits); 29 U.S.C. § 1426(a) & 26 U.S.C. § 418E(a) (insolvent plans
may suspend benefit payments); 29 U.S.C. § 1053 (a)(3)(E)(ii) & 26
U.S.C. § 411(a)(3)(F) (exception to forfeiture rule for amendments that
reduce benefits under §§ 1441 or 1425, and suspension of benefit
payments under §§ 1441 and 1426). Because the latter category
(suspension of benefit payments) includes suspensions not according to
any amendment, as in the case of insolvent plans, for example, it is not
rendered superfluous by interpreting the amendment in this case as
falling into the former category (amendments that reduce benefits).
9Link to the text of the note In other words, even crediting the
reliability of any inference about the anti-cutback rule that can be
drawn from the use of these phrases in various provisions relating to
terminated or troubled plans, the most we can infer is that a suspension
of benefit payments not falling into the first category\--amendments
that reduce benefits\--should be excluded from the anti-cutback rule.
But other than in the case of insolvent or terminated plans, an
administrator\'s authority to suspend benefits must come from the plan.
\[\*\*18\] And as we noted before, no one is disputing that the
suspension in this case would be proper if it were contained in the
original plan. It is the propriety of the amendment to the plan that is
at issue in this case, and not the suspension itself, and therefore we
cannot infer from the distinction made in Title IV between suspensions
of benefit payments and amendments that reduce benefits that the
amendment in this case is beyond the anti-cutback rule. 10Link to the
text of the note \[\*\*19\] \[\*809\] We do not view the omission of a
specific reference to suspensions in the anti-cutback rule as an
oversight, but as unnecessary. Adding a reference to suspensions in §
1054(g)(1) (e.g., \"The accrued benefit of a participant under a plan
may not be decreased \[or suspended\] by an amendment of the plan\") or
§ 1054(g)(2) (e.g., \"a plan amendment which has the effect of
...eliminating\[,\] reducing\[, or suspending\] an early retirement
benefit ...\"), would be awkward and perhaps overbroad; it is not the
suspension of benefit payments that offends the anti-cutback rule, but
the change (to the detriment of the participant) in the conditions
triggering the suspension, and this concept is adequately captured by
the prohibition against amendments that reduce benefits. 2. Legislative
history of the Retirement Equity Act. The Fund, again relying on Spacek,
also points to the legislative history of the Retirement Equity Act of
1984, which added paragraph (2)\--the provision concerning amendments
that reduce or eliminate early retirement benefits\--to § 1054(g). See
Spacek, 134 F.3d at 289-90. Spacek found instructive the following
comment made \[\*\*20\] by Representative William Clay during the final
House debates on the Retirement Equity Act: Nor do those provisions in
any way apply to or affect the provisions of ERISA section 203(a)(3)(B)
and code section 411(a)(3)(B) relating to the suspension of benefits for
post-retirement employment, including the authorization for
multiemployer plans to adopt stricter rules for the suspension of
subsidized early retirement benefits. Spacek, 134 F.3d at 289 (quoting
130 Cong. Rec. 23,487 (1984)). The Fifth Circuit concluded that
Representative Clay\'s remark means that the anti-cutback rule in §
1054(g) does not limit the power of the plan to amend the plan to expand
the restrictions on post-retirement employment. See Spacek, 134 F.3d at
289-90. We find Representative Clay\'s remark ambiguous at best on the
question of whether amendments concerning suspensions for disqualifying
employment are outside the coverage of § 1054(g). 11Link to the text of
the note \[\*\*23\] But even if Representative Clay\'s understanding of
the anti-cutback rule were consistent with the Fifth Circuit\'s\--that
suspensions upon disqualifying re-employment represent an additional
exception to § 1054(g)\--we \[\*\*21\] find nothing in the legislative
history to indicate that anyone else in Congress shared the
understanding attributed to Representative Clay by the Fifth Circuit.
The parties have not identified, \[\*810\] and we have been unable to
find, any further reference in the legislative history of the Retirement
Equity Act to the exception for suspensions that the Fifth Circuit
infers from Representative Clay\'s remarks. 12Link to the text of the
note The absence of any additional support in the legislative history
suggests to us that the Fifth Circuit gave undue weight to the statement
of Representative Clay, which (as interpreted by the Fifth Circuit) is
at odds with the straightforward language of the statute. See Barnhart
v. Sigmon Coal Co., 534 U.S. 438, 122 S. Ct. 941, 953-54, 151 L. Ed. 2d
908 (2002) (rejecting interpretation contained in the floor statements
of the statute\'s sponsors); Monterey Coal Co. v. Federal Mine Safety
and Health Review Comm\'n, 743 F.2d 589, 596 (7th Cir. 1984) (same);
Alex v. City of Chicago, 29 F.3d 1235, 1239 n.3 (7th Cir. 1994)
(\"Isolated remarks of individual legislators, ...\[can\] not be used to
find ambiguity, or contrary intent, in statutory \[\*\*22\] language
that, with respect to a case in hand, is clear on its own terms without
rendering nugatory the \'plain meaning\' canon of construction.\").
13Link to the text of the note Accordingly, we conclude that
Representative Clay\'s remarks cannot be used to support an exception to
the anti-cutback rule for amendments that expand disqualifying
employment. 3. Treasury Regulation 26 C.F.R. § 1.411(c)-1(f). The court
in Spacek also found support in 26 C.F.R. § 1.411(c)-1(f), a Treasury
Department regulation concerning the allocation of accrued benefits
between employer and employee contributions. By way of background, the
court first noted that the term \"accrued benefit\" means the
employees\' benefit as accrued under \[\*\*24\] the plan, expressed in
the form of \"an annual benefit commencing at normal retirement age,\"
29 U.S.C. § 1002(23), 14Link to the text of the note or, for early
retirement benefits, the actuarial equivalent of the benefit commencing
at normal retirement age. See Spacek, 134 F.3d at 290 (citing 29 U.S.C.
§ 1054(c)(3); 26 C.F.R. § 1.411(c) -1(e)). 15Link to the text of the
note The Treasury regulation relied upon by Spacek, 26 C.F.R. §
1.411(c)-1(f)(1), states that in calculating the actuarial equivalent of
an accrued benefit, \"no adjustment ...is required on account of any
suspension of benefits\" if the suspension is permitted under ERISA §
203(a)(3)(B)\--the section dealing with restrictions on post-retirement
employment. 16Link to the text of the note According to the \[\*811\]
Fifth Circuit, \"because [the reduction in total benefits paid over the
lifetime of the plan participant as a result of the suspension **need
not** be accounted for **actuarially**]{.underline} in computing the
participant\'s accrued benefit,\" an amendment \"authorizing such a
suspension does not serve to decrease the participant\'s accrued
benefits, and thus cannot violate § 1054(g).\" 134 F.3d at 291.

9Link to the text of the note In other words, even crediting the
reliability of any inference about the anti-cutback rule that can be
drawn from the use of these phrases in various provisions relating to
terminated or troubled plans, the most we can infer is that a suspension
of benefit payments not falling into the first category\--amendments
that reduce benefits\--should be excluded from the anti-cutback rule.
But other than in the case of insolvent or terminated plans, an
administrator\'s authority to suspend benefits must come from the plan.
\[\*\*18\] And as we noted before, no one is disputing that the
suspension in this case would be proper if it were contained in the
original plan. It is the propriety of the amendment to the plan that is
at issue in this case, and not the suspension itself, and therefore we
cannot infer from the distinction made in Title IV between suspensions
of benefit payments and amendments that reduce benefits that the
amendment in this case is beyond the anti-cutback rule. 10Link to the
text of the note \[\*\*19\] \[\*809\] We do not view the omission of a
specific reference to suspensions in the anti-cutback rule as an
oversight, but as unnecessary. Adding a reference to suspensions in §
1054(g)(1) (e.g., \"The accrued benefit of a participant under a plan
may not be decreased \[or suspended\] by an amendment of the plan\") or
§ 1054(g)(2) (e.g., \"a plan amendment which has the effect of
...eliminating\[,\] reducing\[, or suspending\] an early retirement
benefit ...\"), would be awkward and perhaps overbroad; it is not the
suspension of benefit payments that offends the anti-cutback rule, but
the change (to the detriment of the participant) in the conditions
triggering the suspension, and this concept is adequately captured by
the prohibition against amendments that reduce benefits. 2. Legislative
history of the Retirement Equity Act. The Fund, again relying on Spacek,
also points to the legislative history of the Retirement Equity Act of
1984, which added paragraph (2)\--the provision concerning amendments
that reduce or eliminate early retirement benefits\--to § 1054(g). See
Spacek, 134 F.3d at 289-90. Spacek found instructive the following
comment made \[\*\*20\] by Representative William Clay during the final
House debates on the Retirement Equity Act: Nor do those provisions in
any way apply to or affect the provisions of ERISA section 203(a)(3)(B)
and code section 411(a)(3)(B) relating to the suspension of benefits for
post-retirement employment, including the authorization for
multiemployer plans to adopt stricter rules for the suspension of
subsidized early retirement benefits. Spacek, 134 F.3d at 289 (quoting
130 Cong. Rec. 23,487 (1984)). The Fifth Circuit concluded that
Representative Clay\'s remark means that the anti-cutback rule in §
1054(g) does not limit the power of the plan to amend the plan to expand
the restrictions on post-retirement employment. See Spacek, 134 F.3d at
289-90. We find Representative Clay\'s remark ambiguous at best on the
question of whether amendments concerning suspensions for disqualifying
employment are outside the coverage of § 1054(g). 11Link to the text of
the note \[\*\*23\] But even if Representative Clay\'s understanding of
the anti-cutback rule were consistent with the Fifth Circuit\'s\--that
suspensions upon disqualifying re-employment represent an additional
exception to § 1054(g)\--we \[\*\*21\] find nothing in the legislative
history to indicate that anyone else in Congress shared the
understanding attributed to Representative Clay by the Fifth Circuit.
The parties have not identified, \[\*810\] and we have been unable to
find, any further reference in the legislative history of the Retirement
Equity Act to the exception for suspensions that the Fifth Circuit
infers from Representative Clay\'s remarks. 12Link to the text of the
note The absence of any additional support in the legislative history
suggests to us that the Fifth Circuit gave undue weight to the statement
of Representative Clay, which (as interpreted by the Fifth Circuit) is
at odds with the straightforward language of the statute. See Barnhart
v. Sigmon Coal Co., 534 U.S. 438, 122 S. Ct. 941, 953-54, 151 L. Ed. 2d
908 (2002) (rejecting interpretation contained in the floor statements
of the statute\'s sponsors); Monterey Coal Co. v. Federal Mine Safety
and Health Review Comm\'n, 743 F.2d 589, 596 (7th Cir. 1984) (same);
Alex v. City of Chicago, 29 F.3d 1235, 1239 n.3 (7th Cir. 1994)
(\"Isolated remarks of individual legislators, ...\[can\] not be used to
find ambiguity, or contrary intent, in statutory \[\*\*22\] language
that, with respect to a case in hand, is clear on its own terms without
rendering nugatory the \'plain meaning\' canon of construction.\").
13Link to the text of the note Accordingly, we conclude that
Representative Clay\'s remarks cannot be used to support an exception to
the anti-cutback rule for amendments that expand disqualifying
employment. 3. Treasury Regulation 26 C.F.R. § 1.411(c)-1(f). The court
in Spacek also found support in 26 C.F.R. § 1.411(c)-1(f), a Treasury
Department regulation concerning the allocation of accrued benefits
between employer and employee contributions. By way of background, the
court first noted that the term \"accrued benefit\" means the
employees\' benefit as accrued under \[\*\*24\] the plan, expressed in
the form of \"an annual benefit commencing at normal retirement age,\"
29 U.S.C. § 1002(23), 14Link to the text of the note or, for early
retirement benefits, the actuarial equivalent of the benefit commencing
at normal retirement age. See Spacek, 134 F.3d at 290 (citing 29 U.S.C.
§ 1054(c)(3); 26 C.F.R. § 1.411(c) -1(e)). 15Link to the text of the
note The Treasury regulation relied upon by Spacek, 26 C.F.R. §
1.411(c)-1(f)(1), states that in calculating the actuarial equivalent of
an accrued benefit, \"no adjustment ...is required on account of any
suspension of benefits\" if the suspension is permitted under ERISA §
203(a)(3)(B)\--the section dealing with restrictions on post-retirement
employment. 16Link to the text of the note According to the \[\*811\]
Fifth Circuit, \"because [the reduction in total benefits paid over the
lifetime of the plan participant as a result of the suspension **need
not** be accounted for **actuarially**]{.underline} in computing the
participant\'s accrued benefit,\" an amendment \"authorizing such a
suspension does not serve to decrease the participant\'s accrued
benefits, and thus cannot violate § 1054(g).\" 134 F.3d at 291.

Court of Appeals, Heinz v. Cent. Laborers\' Pension Fund, 303 F.3d 802,
Decided September 13, 2002)

[We conclude that plaintiffs\' loss of the option of working as
construction supervisors was a **reduction** of their]{.underline} early
retirement [benefits]{.underline} within the meaning of § 1054(g)(2).
HN6 [A participant\'s [**benefits** **cannot be understood without**

**those benefits**, and an amendment **[placing]{.mark} materially
greater [restrictions]{.mark}** []{.mark}on the **receipt** of the
benefit [\"**reduces**\" the benefit **just as surely** **as a decrease
in the size**]{.mark} of the monthly benefit payment. We **have not
before** interpreted]{.underline} the prohibition in [the]{.underline}
anti-cutback [rule as limited to amendments that reduce the
**amount**]{.underline} of the periodic payment, [and we find
**nothing** in the language]{.underline} of the rule [that suggests such
an interpretation]{.underline}. In Ahng, \[\*\*10\] for example, we held
that the plaintiffs had stated a claim for violation of § 1054(g) when
they alleged that a \[\*806\] plan amendment changed the deadline by
which the employee must retire in order to receive supplemental early
retirement benefits. 96 F.3d at 1036-37; see also Bellas v. CBS, Inc.,
221 F.3d 517 (3d Cir. 2000) (plan amendment that changed eligibility
requirements for early retirement benefits violated § 1054(g)).
Similarly, in Michael v. Riverside Cement Co. Pension Plan, 266 F.3d
1023, 1027-28 (9th Cir. 2001), the Ninth Circuit held that an amendment
that eliminated the plan\'s \"no-offset rule,\" which had allowed a
participant to receive full early retirement benefits without regard to
the amount he already received upon previous retirement, violated §
1054(g) even though the amendment increased the plaintiff\'s monthly
benefit payment. Cf. Hickey, 980 F.2d at 468 (7th Cir. 1992) (plan
amendment that eliminated the particiant\'s right to cost-of-living
adjustments violated the anti-cutback rule). [The Fund argues
that]{.underline} [these cases are **distinguishable** because a change
in the **eligibility requirements**]{.underline}, as in Ahng \[\*\*11\]
[for example, **differs** from a change in the **conditions triggering
suspension** of benefit]{.underline} payments [in that the former
**permanently reduces** benefits or **eliminates** certain]{.underline}
participants\' rights to [benefits, whereas a **suspension** is
**temporary**]{.underline}. **[We find the distinction
unconvincing]{.underline}**. [Although with a suspension the
**interruption** in benefit]{.underline} payments [is temporary, the
retiree **never recovers** **the payments lost** during the]{.underline}
employment [period. The amendment thus \"**eliminates**]{.underline}\"
monthly benefit [payments for participants who take certain jobs after
retirement and \"**reduces**\" the participant\'s **total**]{.underline}
early retirement [benefits by an amount determined by how long
the]{.underline} [disqualifying]{.underline} work [continues. Plaintiffs
**lost** a valuable right they had earned **before**]{.underline} the
amendment\--the right to continue to work in the industry while
receiving monthly benefit payments\-- [and [**that loss** **was

\[\*\*13\] \[\*807\] B. Spacek v. Maritime Association The Fund points
out, however, that \"suspensions\" are not identified along with the
prohibitions against decreases, reductions, and elimination of benefits
in the anti-cutback rule. The Fund relies on Spacek v. Maritime Ass\'n,
134 F.3d 283 (5th Cir. 1998), in which the Fifth Circuit concluded that
an amendment like the one in this case did not violate the anti-cutback
rule because it concerned a \"suspension\" and not a \"reduction\" in
benefits. 7Link to the text of the note The Fifth Circuit supported its
conclusion with: (1) an examination of the use of the two terms under
the statute and related regulations; (2) the legislative history of the
Retirement Equity Act; and (3) a Treasury regulation concerning the
effect of suspensions on \"accrued benefits.\" We respectfully conclude,
however, that the Fifth Circuit\'s arguments do not support its
conclusion. \[\*\*14\] 1. Suspensions and reductions under ERISA. In
Spacek, the court noted that \"throughout the statute and corresponding
regulations, the concepts of reduction of benefits and suspension of
benefit payments are used in distinct ways, often within a single
provision.\" 134 F.3d at 288-89 (citing 29 U.S.C. §§ 1441(a), 1341a(d) &
1342(d)(1)(A)(v); 29 C.F.R. § 2520.104b-4(a)(1)(iii)). From this the
court reasoned that to interpret the prohibition in the anti-cutback
rule against amendments that reduce benefits as applying to suspensions
would \"make the word \'suspension\' redundant in all of these statutory
provisions and interpretive regulations.\" Spacek, 134 F.3d at 289. This
redundancy, according to Spacek, would violate the canon of statutory
construction that every word in a statute must be given meaning. Id. We
disagree with the inference that Spacek draws from the various
provisions that refer to both reductions and suspensions. Our
interpretation of the anti-cutback rule does not suggest that all
suspensions are \"reductions\" (or vice versa), only that if the
suspension is pursuant \[\*\*15\] to an amendment that reduces benefits
(attributable to service before the amendment), then it is a reduction
within the anti-cutback rule. This interpretation does not render the
word \"suspension\" in the other provisions redundant. For example,
Spacek relies on various provisions in Title IV of ERISA (relating to
financially troubled and terminated plans) that refer to both
\"reduction of benefits\" and \"suspension of benefit payments\";
according to Spacek, to avoid redundancy, the former phrase must be
construed as excluding the latter. Id. But Spacek\'s identification of
the two relevant phrases is too narrow; to the extent the Title IV
provisions identify two separate categories, they are amendments that
reduce benefits on the one hand, and suspension \[\*808\] of benefit
payments, on the other. Section 1441, governing plan terminations, is
typical: (a) Amendment of plan by plan sponsor to reduce benefits, and
suspension of benefit payments Notwithstanding sections 1053 and 1054 of
this title, the plan sponsor of a terminated multiemployer plan to which
section 1341a(d) of this title applies shall amend the plan to reduce
benefits, and shall suspend \[\*\*16\] benefit payments, as required by
this section. 29 U.S.C. § 1441(a) (emphasis added) 8Link to the text of
the note \[\*\*17\] ;see also 29 U.S.C. § 1425(a)(1) & 26 U.S.C. §
418D(a)(1) (plans in reorganization may amend the plan to reduce
benefits); 29 U.S.C. § 1426(a) & 26 U.S.C. § 418E(a) (insolvent plans
may suspend benefit payments); 29 U.S.C. § 1053 (a)(3)(E)(ii) & 26
U.S.C. § 411(a)(3)(F) (exception to forfeiture rule for amendments that
reduce benefits under §§ 1441 or 1425, and suspension of benefit
payments under §§ 1441 and 1426). Because the latter category
(suspension of benefit payments) includes suspensions not according to
any amendment, as in the case of insolvent plans, for example, it is not
rendered superfluous by interpreting the amendment in this case as
falling into the former category (amendments that reduce benefits).
9Link to the text of the note In other words, even crediting the
reliability of any inference about the anti-cutback rule that can be
drawn from the use of these phrases in various provisions relating to
terminated or troubled plans, the most we can infer is that a suspension

history of the Retirement Equity Act. The Fund, again relying on Spacek,
also points to the legislative history of the Retirement Equity Act of
1984, which added paragraph (2)\--the provision concerning amendments
that reduce or eliminate early retirement benefits\--to § 1054(g). See

donations mean that the nominal financial value of many arms deals
reflects neither the costs of production nor the objective military

outlined [provides a perfect way to measure]{.mark} international arms

#### We meet- congressional participation in the arm sales process is a reduction in arm sales by enforcing the sales restraint outlined in the AECA

**Sciarra 88** \[Vanessa Patton Sciarra was Vice President for Legal
Affairs and Trade & Investment Policy on the National Foreign Trade
Council and was responsible for matters related to trade and investment
policy, international trade agreements and international dispute
settlement, "Congress and Arms Sales: Tapping the Potential of the
Fast-Track Guarantee Procedure", Yale Law Journal Company,
<https://www.jstor.org/stable/pdf/796446>\]

A fast-track guarantee procedure for arms sales will allow the values of
congressional oversight and participation to be met while still allowing
executive branch flexibility in arranging and implementing arms deals.85
Debate over specific sales should also allow both branches to address
the broader policy question of how the United States government should
approach the growing demand for arms among developing countries. For
example, [[increased congressional participation in regulating arms
transfers may allow Congress to force executive compliance with the
mandate of sales restraint set out in the AECA]{.underline}]{.mark}

#### Counter-interpretation: Temporary suspensions and more restrictive eligibility criteria are both 'reductions' relative to the hypothetical continuation of the status quo

opinion authored by Judge Anne Claire Williams of the Seventh Circuit
Court of Appeals, Heinz v. Cent. Laborers\' Pension Fund, 303 F.3d 802,
Decided September 13, 2002)

[[We conclude]{.mark} that plaintiffs\' [loss of]{.mark} [the option of
working as]{.mark} construction [supervisors]{.mark} [was a
**reduction** of]{.mark} their]{.underline} early retirement
[[benefits]{.underline}]{.mark} within the meaning of § 1054(g)(2). HN6
[A participant\'s [**benefits** **cannot be understood without**
reference to the **conditions** **imposed on receiving**
**those**]{.mark} **benefits**, [and]{.mark} an amendment
**[placing]{.mark} [materially greater restrictions]{.mark}** [on
the]{.mark} **receipt** of the [benefit]{.mark} \"**[reduces]{.mark}**\"
[the benefit **just as surely**]{.mark} [**as a decrease in the size**
of]{.mark} the monthly benefit payment. [We **have not before**]{.mark}
[interpreted]{.mark}]{.underline} the prohibition in
[[the]{.underline}]{.mark} anti-cutback [[rule as limited]{.mark}
[to]{.mark} amendments that reduce [the **amount**]{.mark}]{.underline}
of the periodic payment, [[and]{.mark} we find [**nothing** in the
language]{.mark}]{.underline} of the rule [that [suggests]{.mark}
[such]{.mark} an interpretation]{.underline}. In Ahng, \[\*\*10\] for
example, we held that the plaintiffs had stated a claim for violation of
§ 1054(g) when they alleged that a \[\*806\] plan amendment changed the
deadline by which the employee must retire in order to receive
supplemental early retirement benefits. 96 F.3d at 1036-37; see also
Bellas v. CBS, Inc., 221 F.3d 517 (3d Cir. 2000) (plan amendment that
changed eligibility requirements for early retirement benefits violated
§ 1054(g)). Similarly, in Michael v. Riverside Cement Co. Pension Plan,
266 F.3d 1023, 1027-28 (9th Cir. 2001), the Ninth Circuit held that an
amendment that eliminated the plan\'s \"no-offset rule,\" which had
allowed a participant to receive full early retirement benefits without
regard to the amount he already received upon previous retirement,
violated § 1054(g) even though the amendment increased the plaintiff\'s
monthly benefit payment. Cf. Hickey, 980 F.2d at 468 (7th Cir. 1992)
(plan amendment that eliminated the particiant\'s right to
cost-of-living adjustments violated the anti-cutback rule). [[The Fund
argues that]{.underline}]{.mark} [these cases are **distinguishable**
because [a change in]{.mark} the **[eligibility
requirements]{.mark}**]{.underline}, as in Ahng \[\*\*11\] [for example,
[**differs** from a change in the **conditions triggering
suspension**]{.mark} of benefit]{.underline} payments [[in that the

[payments for participants who take certain jobs after retirement and
\"**[reduces]{.mark}**\" the participant\'s
**[total]{.mark}**]{.underline} early retirement [[benefits]{.mark} by

valuable right they had earned **before**]{.underline} the

\[\*\*13\] \[\*807\] B. Spacek v. Maritime Association The Fund points
out, however, that \"suspensions\" are not identified along with the
prohibitions against decreases, reductions, and elimination of benefits
in the anti-cutback rule. The Fund relies on Spacek v. Maritime Ass\'n,
134 F.3d 283 (5th Cir. 1998), in which the Fifth Circuit concluded that
an amendment like the one in this case did not violate the anti-cutback
rule because it concerned a \"suspension\" and not a \"reduction\" in
benefits. 7Link to the text of the note The Fifth Circuit supported its
conclusion with: (1) an examination of the use of the two terms under
the statute and related regulations; (2) the legislative history of the
Retirement Equity Act; and (3) a Treasury regulation concerning the
effect of suspensions on \"accrued benefits.\" We respectfully conclude,
however, that the Fifth Circuit\'s arguments do not support its
conclusion. \[\*\*14\] 1. Suspensions and reductions under ERISA. In
Spacek, the court noted that \"throughout the statute and corresponding
regulations, the concepts of reduction of benefits and suspension of
benefit payments are used in distinct ways, often within a single
provision.\" 134 F.3d at 288-89 (citing 29 U.S.C. §§ 1441(a), 1341a(d) &
1342(d)(1)(A)(v); 29 C.F.R. § 2520.104b-4(a)(1)(iii)). From this the
court reasoned that to interpret the prohibition in the anti-cutback
rule against amendments that reduce benefits as applying to suspensions
would \"make the word \'suspension\' redundant in all of these statutory
provisions and interpretive regulations.\" Spacek, 134 F.3d at 289. This
redundancy, according to Spacek, would violate the canon of statutory
construction that every word in a statute must be given meaning. Id. We
disagree with the inference that Spacek draws from the various
provisions that refer to both reductions and suspensions. Our
interpretation of the anti-cutback rule does not suggest that all
suspensions are \"reductions\" (or vice versa), only that if the
suspension is pursuant \[\*\*15\] to an amendment that reduces benefits
(attributable to service before the amendment), then it is a reduction
within the anti-cutback rule. This interpretation does not render the
word \"suspension\" in the other provisions redundant. For example,
Spacek relies on various provisions in Title IV of ERISA (relating to
financially troubled and terminated plans) that refer to both
\"reduction of benefits\" and \"suspension of benefit payments\";
according to Spacek, to avoid redundancy, the former phrase must be
construed as excluding the latter. Id. But Spacek\'s identification of
the two relevant phrases is too narrow; to the extent the Title IV
provisions identify two separate categories, they are amendments that
reduce benefits on the one hand, and suspension \[\*808\] of benefit
payments, on the other. Section 1441, governing plan terminations, is
typical: (a) Amendment of plan by plan sponsor to reduce benefits, and
suspension of benefit payments Notwithstanding sections 1053 and 1054 of
this title, the plan sponsor of a terminated multiemployer plan to which
section 1341a(d) of this title applies shall amend the plan to reduce
benefits, and shall suspend \[\*\*16\] benefit payments, as required by
this section. 29 U.S.C. § 1441(a) (emphasis added) 8Link to the text of
the note \[\*\*17\] ;see also 29 U.S.C. § 1425(a)(1) & 26 U.S.C. §
418D(a)(1) (plans in reorganization may amend the plan to reduce
benefits); 29 U.S.C. § 1426(a) & 26 U.S.C. § 418E(a) (insolvent plans
may suspend benefit payments); 29 U.S.C. § 1053 (a)(3)(E)(ii) & 26
U.S.C. § 411(a)(3)(F) (exception to forfeiture rule for amendments that
reduce benefits under §§ 1441 or 1425, and suspension of benefit
payments under §§ 1441 and 1426). Because the latter category
(suspension of benefit payments) includes suspensions not according to
any amendment, as in the case of insolvent plans, for example, it is not
rendered superfluous by interpreting the amendment in this case as
falling into the former category (amendments that reduce benefits).
9Link to the text of the note In other words, even crediting the
reliability of any inference about the anti-cutback rule that can be
drawn from the use of these phrases in various provisions relating to
terminated or troubled plans, the most we can infer is that a suspension
of benefit payments not falling into the first category\--amendments
that reduce benefits\--should be excluded from the anti-cutback rule.
But other than in the case of insolvent or terminated plans, an
administrator\'s authority to suspend benefits must come from the plan.
\[\*\*18\] And as we noted before, no one is disputing that the
suspension in this case would be proper if it were contained in the
original plan. It is the propriety of the amendment to the plan that is
at issue in this case, and not the suspension itself, and therefore we
cannot infer from the distinction made in Title IV between suspensions
of benefit payments and amendments that reduce benefits that the
amendment in this case is beyond the anti-cutback rule. 10Link to the
text of the note \[\*\*19\] \[\*809\] We do not view the omission of a
specific reference to suspensions in the anti-cutback rule as an
oversight, but as unnecessary. Adding a reference to suspensions in §
1054(g)(1) (e.g., \"The accrued benefit of a participant under a plan
may not be decreased \[or suspended\] by an amendment of the plan\") or
§ 1054(g)(2) (e.g., \"a plan amendment which has the effect of
...eliminating\[,\] reducing\[, or suspending\] an early retirement
benefit ...\"), would be awkward and perhaps overbroad; it is not the
suspension of benefit payments that offends the anti-cutback rule, but
the change (to the detriment of the participant) in the conditions
triggering the suspension, and this concept is adequately captured by
the prohibition against amendments that reduce benefits. 2. Legislative
history of the Retirement Equity Act. The Fund, again relying on Spacek,
also points to the legislative history of the Retirement Equity Act of
1984, which added paragraph (2)\--the provision concerning amendments
that reduce or eliminate early retirement benefits\--to § 1054(g). See
Spacek, 134 F.3d at 289-90. Spacek found instructive the following
comment made \[\*\*20\] by Representative William Clay during the final
House debates on the Retirement Equity Act: Nor do those provisions in
any way apply to or affect the provisions of ERISA section 203(a)(3)(B)
and code section 411(a)(3)(B) relating to the suspension of benefits for
post-retirement employment, including the authorization for
multiemployer plans to adopt stricter rules for the suspension of
subsidized early retirement benefits. Spacek, 134 F.3d at 289 (quoting
130 Cong. Rec. 23,487 (1984)). The Fifth Circuit concluded that
Representative Clay\'s remark means that the anti-cutback rule in §
1054(g) does not limit the power of the plan to amend the plan to expand
the restrictions on post-retirement employment. See Spacek, 134 F.3d at
289-90. We find Representative Clay\'s remark ambiguous at best on the
question of whether amendments concerning suspensions for disqualifying
employment are outside the coverage of § 1054(g). 11Link to the text of
the note \[\*\*23\] But even if Representative Clay\'s understanding of
the anti-cutback rule were consistent with the Fifth Circuit\'s\--that
suspensions upon disqualifying re-employment represent an additional
exception to § 1054(g)\--we \[\*\*21\] find nothing in the legislative
history to indicate that anyone else in Congress shared the
understanding attributed to Representative Clay by the Fifth Circuit.
The parties have not identified, \[\*810\] and we have been unable to
find, any further reference in the legislative history of the Retirement
Equity Act to the exception for suspensions that the Fifth Circuit
infers from Representative Clay\'s remarks. 12Link to the text of the
note The absence of any additional support in the legislative history
suggests to us that the Fifth Circuit gave undue weight to the statement
of Representative Clay, which (as interpreted by the Fifth Circuit) is
at odds with the straightforward language of the statute. See Barnhart
v. Sigmon Coal Co., 534 U.S. 438, 122 S. Ct. 941, 953-54, 151 L. Ed. 2d
908 (2002) (rejecting interpretation contained in the floor statements
of the statute\'s sponsors); Monterey Coal Co. v. Federal Mine Safety
and Health Review Comm\'n, 743 F.2d 589, 596 (7th Cir. 1984) (same);
Alex v. City of Chicago, 29 F.3d 1235, 1239 n.3 (7th Cir. 1994)
(\"Isolated remarks of individual legislators, ...\[can\] not be used to
find ambiguity, or contrary intent, in statutory \[\*\*22\] language
that, with respect to a case in hand, is clear on its own terms without
rendering nugatory the \'plain meaning\' canon of construction.\").
13Link to the text of the note Accordingly, we conclude that
Representative Clay\'s remarks cannot be used to support an exception to
the anti-cutback rule for amendments that expand disqualifying
employment. 3. Treasury Regulation 26 C.F.R. § 1.411(c)-1(f). The court
in Spacek also found support in 26 C.F.R. § 1.411(c)-1(f), a Treasury
Department regulation concerning the allocation of accrued benefits
between employer and employee contributions. By way of background, the
court first noted that the term \"accrued benefit\" means the
employees\' benefit as accrued under \[\*\*24\] the plan, expressed in
the form of \"an annual benefit commencing at normal retirement age,\"
29 U.S.C. § 1002(23), 14Link to the text of the note or, for early
retirement benefits, the actuarial equivalent of the benefit commencing
at normal retirement age. See Spacek, 134 F.3d at 290 (citing 29 U.S.C.
§ 1054(c)(3); 26 C.F.R. § 1.411(c) -1(e)). 15Link to the text of the
note The Treasury regulation relied upon by Spacek, 26 C.F.R. §
1.411(c)-1(f)(1), states that in calculating the actuarial equivalent of
an accrued benefit, \"no adjustment ...is required on account of any
suspension of benefits\" if the suspension is permitted under ERISA §
203(a)(3)(B)\--the section dealing with restrictions on post-retirement
employment. 16Link to the text of the note According to the \[\*811\]
Fifth Circuit, \"because [the reduction in total benefits paid over the
lifetime of the plan participant as a result of the suspension **need
not** be accounted for **actuarially**]{.underline} in computing the
participant\'s accrued benefit,\" an amendment \"authorizing such a
suspension does not serve to decrease the participant\'s accrued
benefits, and thus cannot violate § 1054(g).\" 134 F.3d at 291.

directive, released in April 2018, gives lip service to strategic and
human rights concerns, but its distinguishing feature compared to the

increasing U.S. competitiveness, promoting jobs, and advocating on
behalf of U.S. arms manufacturers.

For example, under the rubric of supporting "economic security" [the
[directive pledges to "increase trade opportunities]{.mark} for United
States companies, including by supporting United States industry with
appropriate advocacy and trade promotion activities and [by simplifying
the United States regulatory environment]{.mark}." In practice, measures
to "simplify the regulatory environment" have [included]{.mark}
downgrading the importance of human rights and strategic concerns in
favor of economic considerations; [attempting to speed up the review
process for major arms sales; and making it easier to export firearms by
removing]{.mark} significant categories of guns [from the primary
jurisdiction of the State Department and placing]{.mark} them [under the
purview of the Department of Commerce]{.mark}, where they will be

#### Aff ground outweighs limits -- creativity encourages more research and portable skills and is key to better neg ground -- otherwise we are forced to go for \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ to beat \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_.

#### Even if they win underlimiting, that's better than overlimiting -- prevents stale debates.

### Ground Loss

#### No ground loss -- they get generics because all links are based off of education regulation and funding -- we're both.

#### Make them prove in-round abuse -- by \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_-- they can generate more links to CPs and DAs -- such as Congress CPs, politics DAs, and \[a DA\].

### Race to the Margins

#### Reading courts affs prevent race to the margins -- that's better for neg limits and ground -- there are infinite small policies that the aff could propose, but there are only a limited number of decisions that courts can make regarding foreign policy.

#### They overlimit -- the best definitions of regulation are specific to executive agencies, which means that Congress isn't topical -- means that most of the affs in their caselist aren't topical.

### Functional Limits

#### Functional limits check -- since the states set most of the regulations for education the states CP will solve almost every aff -- even if they win that the topic is huge -- make them prove that their caselist will actually be able to win affirmative rounds.

#### We limit the topic best because we allow for debates that are central to the federal government's role in education -- which is having multiple branches work together to do the plan -- means that we access their limits arguments.

### 1AR W/M 

#### Adding conditions is a reduction 

(**La Casse 06**, Leonard, Judge on the 139^th^ California court of
appeals, North Gualala Water Co. v. State Water Resources Control Bd.,
139 Cal. App. 4th 1577, Nexis Uni)

The record before us contains no evidence of contemporaneous statements
discussing the legislative intent of the subterranean stream language in
section 42 of the Water Commission Act, and no published court cases
have interpreted the phrase since its enactment into law in 1914. From
the sequence of amendments made to section 42 of Assembly Bill No. 642,
it appears that the Legislature deliberately rejected wording that might
otherwise have supported a broad assertion of jurisdiction over
subsurface water. The addition, a few weeks later, of the phrase "and to
subterranean streams flowing through known and definite channels" cannot
reasonably be construed as an attempt to restore any major part of that
jurisdiction. First, [in contrast to the broad and inclusive list used
to describe]{.underline} the State Water Commission\'s surface water
[jurisdiction]{.underline} ("stream, stream system, lake or other body
of water"), [the phrase]{.underline} "subterranean streams flowing
through known and definite channels" [seems deliberately
narrow.]{.underline} [Virtually every word in it sets a limiting
condition (e.g., flowing, known, definite, channel) that seems to reduce
its breadth]{.underline}.

Service Benefits results from the \"occurrence of \[a\] condition.\"
When an employer is terminated from the Fund due to withdrawal or
failure to contribute, the Trustees, pursuant to Section 2.07 of the
Plan, cancel the portion of a participant\'s benefits which is
attributable to past service with that employer. [2![Link to the text of

[certain definite acts and conditions are prescribed for the
reduction]{.underline} of the capital stock of a corporation, none of
which was observed by petitioner. They are as follows: (1) The directors
or managing officers of the corporation may order the stock decreased
after they secure a two-thirds vote of all the outstanding stock with
voting privileges authorizing the same; (2) such authorization from the
stockholders must occur at a special or regular meeting called for that
purpose; (3) upon the decrease being ordered in accordance with such
provisions the same shall be certified to the secretary of state; (4) if
the decrease has been made in accordance with law the secretary of state

[Data in arms received by Middle East states is obtained directly from
Stockholm International Peace Research Institute, (SIPRI)s. SIPRI is
selected because it is more valid and reliable than any other sources
and it is widely used by scholars in this field. However, the
[measurement of arms transfers]{.mark} in terms of [\$ value]{.mark} per
year [as opposed to arms transfers agreements as the event, is
problematic. While the second measurement]{.mark} of arms transfers [is
more accurate than the \$ value]{.mark} measurement, [I was unable to
obtain the data on arms agreements]{.mark}. It is [difficult to collect
on the US side and impossible on the Soviet Side]{.mark}. Nonetheless, I
did search several sources and found limited information on some
agreements, however the length of the agreement was unknown as well as
what is in the agreement in terms of the value of arms
transfers.]{.underline} Regardless, I used a new data set on arms
transfers complied by John Sislin (1993) especially in chapter five (see
chapter 5 for more discussion).
