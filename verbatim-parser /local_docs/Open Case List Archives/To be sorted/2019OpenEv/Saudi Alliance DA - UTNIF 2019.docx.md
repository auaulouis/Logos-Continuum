The United States has been making a lot of big arms sales to Saudi
Arabia in recent years. [Recently]{.underline}, though, [[there has been
a push to halt the
sales](https://www.defensenews.com/congress/2019/06/20/us-senate-votes-to-kill-saudi-arms-sales-defying-trump-veto-threat/)
on a number of grounds, including the ongoing civil war in
Yemen]{.underline} (the Saudis are backing the Yemeni government against
Iranian-backed Houthi rebels) [and the murder of Jamal
Khashoggi.]{.underline} [Halting the arms sales would be a huge
mistake]{.underline}, and should the disapproval resolutions reach his
desk, President Trump should veto them. To be sure, the [Saudis, while
[making some moves in the right
direction](https://townhall.com/columnists/larryprovost/2018/10/24/khashoggi-writings-reveal-antisemitism-pro-shariaism-n2531301),
are not angels.]{.underline} [Khashoggi's murder was deliberate and
brutal. It should outrage people who value freedom of the press. But
cutting off arms sales and support for the Saudi efforts in Yemen would
be giving Iran]{.underline} a couple of [huge boosts]{.underline} just
[to say America owned the Saudis]{.underline} over Khashoggi in
particular and human rights in general. Yemen sits on the Bab el Mandeb,
a maritime choke point that is the southern entrance to the Red Sea. It
is, essentially, Israel's maritime back door. Aden, in the south, is
also a major port, used by the United Kingdom as a military base until
1967. [If the Houthis take control and drive out the government, it
means that the Iranian-sponsored rebels will have the ability to contest
passage through the Bab el Mandeb]{.underline}. They have already [fired
on an Arleigh Burke-class guided missile
destroyer](https://www.wearethemighty.com/articles/this-is-how-a-us-destroyer-just-dodged-2-missiles-off-the-yemen-coast)
on multiple occasions and [attacked a vessel that delivered humanitarian
aid](https://www.wearethemighty.com/articles/former-us-navy-vessel-attacked-by-yemeni-rebels-in-indian-ocean).
That doesn't even begin to touch Iran's record. Since 1979, [Iran has
taken Americans hostage, sponsored terrorist attacks, provided
insurgents in Iraq weapons that were used to kill American
servicemembers, and leaders of the regime have openly and repeatedly
expressed the desire to wipe Israel off the map.]{.underline} In the
last two weeks, [Iran has [mined two oil
tankers](https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/policy/defense-national-security/germanys-angela-merkel-strong-evidence-iran-to-blame-for-tanker-attacks)
and fired on two American unmanned aerial vehicles, [shooting one of
them
down](https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/policy/defense-national-security/us-commander-irans-claim-it-shot-down-us-drone-over-its-airspace-categorically-false)]{.underline}.
Why does America not reach out to Turkey? Turkey has not exactly been a
reliable ally during the regime of Recep Tayyip Erdoğan. The decision to
[yank the F-35 from that
country](https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/opinion/taking-turkeys-f-35s-is-the-right-move-for-the-wrong-reason)
is the right one, even if the Erdoğan regime's purchase of the S-400
air-defense system is the wrong reason. If we can't trust Turkey with
the F-35, can we trust them with other weapon systems? The answer would
appear to be no. Again, noting that the [Saudis are not angels should
not blind us to the fact that they have helped America out in the
past.]{.underline} As Historians Peter Schweizer (in his 1994 book,

the Middle East when we abandoned the Shah of Iran over his bad human

Hosni Mubarak in favor of the Arab Spring? [What evidence is there that

China's rise in the Middle East is not simply a case of debt-trap
diplomacy or expanding Chinese influence, it requires an ideological
shift to accommodate a new regional player and the process of
institutional change that that brings. [**Any US action in Iran would
profoundly benefit China's interests in Iran and strengthen its position
across the region.** Inviting China's capital, technology transfer, and
arms trade into Iran and further opening Iranian export markets to China
would greatly accelerate a fundamental shift in the undercurrent of the
Middle East: a geoeconomic shift from a northward regional axis to a
southward regional axis -- away from Moscow and towards the Indian
Ocean, facilitating China's access ambitions.]{.underline} Without a
US-trade war in the Pacific or a potential hot war in the Gulf, the
world does not have too much to fear in China yet. Generally speaking,
China is too incompetent to be a superpower: ideologically deficient,
global governance deficient, power projection deficient, and
geoeconomically deficient. Coupled with the fact that China has
geopolitically over-extended itself over the past eighteen months and
also has virtually zero competence in Middle East affairs, China is
unprepared to fully back Iran in any conflict with the US. However, a
developing China axis of future influence falls roughly along a straight
line from Urumqi to Cairo. Professor Wang Yangshu, at Lanzhou University
Central Asian Institute, has argued that China's interaction with
Central Asian and Middle Eastern economies will primarily be with the US
along this line. I would further push that anything south of this line
falls into a China Indian Ocean sphere of influence, while anything
north of it remains solely within Moscow's purview. Moreover, if
Russia's historically significant regional states are Afghanistan, Iran,
and Turkey, then China's could be said to be Pakistan, Iran and Turkey.
It is clear that Iran is central to China's 21st Century geostrategy.
Iran is a strategic Belt and Road bridge, critical to China's land and
sea infrastructure construction for cementing trade routes from Europe
and East Africa into Western China. The five key the Middle East Indian
Ocean economies for China are Pakistan, Iran, Saudi Arabia, Egypt, and
Oman all centered around an Indian Ocean geoindustrial policy. [The
prospect of China geoeconomic power in the Persian Gulf and the Red Sea
mean opening the Indian Ocean to a new world of geoeconomic
opportunities for China's geo-industrial and geopolitical options. This
means China's Middle East trade and industry policy should be read as a
geo-industrial foundation of a future geopolitics For Iran, wider
questions about the Iranian economy all seem to have natural answers in
China too.]{.underline} China's civil nuclear technology transfer
program is bringing third-generation pressurized water Hualong One
reactors to Iran, which can be deployed on inland river systems, away
from the vulnerable coast. [Alongside technology transfers, China is
offering industrial capacity transfers in aluminum and steel,
agroindustrial investment, and of course, a massive oil consumer market.
China is also developing competency in water security in the region,
practicing strategic water limitation of Tibetan rivers to India,
developing a Tibet-Xinjiang terraforming plan, as well as its strategic
cooperative relationships with Kyrgyzstan and Tajikistan---both great
water stores. Given Iran's acute water security crisis and extant
domestic political risk, any Chinese water security would be
invaluable.]{.underline} Questions on Iran that the US administration
should be asking itself are which formal and informal
government-to-government institutional linkages between China and Iran
will be strengthened by any US-led conflict? Perhaps most importantly in
terms of institutional history, would be the institutional relationships
of the people within Iran who were there for Iran-China arms trade and
military support in the past. Like the picture of Rumsfeld with Saddam,
who from Iran was buying Chinese arms in the Iran-Iraq war who is still
reasonably relevant to the current Iran administration? Similarly, with
China's economic technoindustrial transfers, [there is an Iran-China
institutional structure here that strategic bombardment is not going to
weaken, but will only strengthen. China already has overseas military
bases in Tajikistan and Djibouti. It has flirted with force projection
in Syria. China also supplies technology to Iran for Iran's civil
nuclear power program. China has the power to shortcut any aspect of
Iran's military nuclear program]{.underline}. In the short-term, there
is little chance of China forward deploying in Iran, but in the longer
term, [closer military relations between the two states could begin to
form a natural alliance against US power in the region.]{.underline} The
US media response to US belligerence in Iran has so far been one of
bemusement, but Chinese rhetoric towards the US over the trade war has
been a "tallionic" like for like, with the statement on Tuesday 15th May
2019 on State CCTV about the trade war that [China is not willing to
fight, but not afraid to fight, and will fight if necessary. And if
China were to support Iran in proxy wars with the United States, the
resulting quagmire could become intractable for the US]{.underline}.
China may not be ready for regional influence or projected power, but
foreign policy hawks in Washington or Moscow are not ready for this
either. Both have only ever seen China within their own threat matrices,
not of China redefining these matrices. Likewise, the outcome of any
military confrontation will not matter in the short-term, but this could
be remembered as the conflict that ended the 75-year aerospace
domination of warfare, and ushers in a new age of security threats in
information, technology, and water. [If the US is seen to be throwing
the dice rather than thinking it through, then China's Iran policy is
also undercooked, a waxing regional power completely unprepared for
foreign policy misadventures in the Middle East]{.underline}. However,
for the US, this is not 1991 or 2003. In 1991 regional conflicts were
more easily isolated into global power narratives. The year 2003
destabilized the region, was probably the beginning of the distrust and
delegitimation of Western democratic governance models abroad and also
the start of disaffection with national and power politics as patronage
systems at home. However, unlike 2003, 2019 is wired. In 2019
governments struggle to control narratives that were once the monopoly
of technocrats in the military industrial complex. [The US has lost
control of the global governance narrative, and let slip the dogs of war
on a whim into a tornado of uncontrollable variables in both information
warfare and conventional warfare is inviting catastrophe from
calm]{.underline}.

#### Ending arms sales decks the alliance, causes lash-out, and international fill in 

**Rounds 2019** (Ray Rounds, Ph.D. candidate at Georgetown University in
International Relations, \"THE CASE AGAINST ARMS EMBARGOS, EVEN FOR
SAUDI ARABIA\", War on the Rocks, April 16 2019,
<https://warontherocks.com/2019/04/the-case-against-arms-embargos-even-for-saudi-arabia/>,
mmv)

One area in which U.S. President Donald Trump does not need to worry
about making America great again is international arms sales. The United
States accounts for 34 percent of all global arms sales (second place
Russia remains a distant 23 percent), and has more than 40 defense
companies in the top 100 globally. [However, with civilian deaths caused
by the Saudi-led war in Yemen estimated at between 16,000 and 50,000 by
the end of 2018, calls for the United States to suspend arms sales to
its largest client --- Saudi Arabia --- have understandably gained
traction in both Congress and the public]{.underline}. More generally,
several authors have penned articles in these virtual pages calling for
more selective U.S. arms export decisions or outright embargos, governed
less by economic motivations and more by concern about blowback, human
rights, dispersion, and reducing technology transfer. I respectfully
disagree with all of these recommendations. [Whether it is delayed
approval, as in the recent Kuwaiti F-18 purchase, an outright
embargo]{.underline}, like Egyptian F-16s in 2013, [or denial of
technology transfer]{.underline}, as in the 2016 Turkish Patriot missile
request, [using the withholding of arms sales as a blunt force
instrument of coercion is unlikely to produce desired strategic benefits
and often backfires]{.underline}. [Arms exports are best used for
maintaining or strengthening relationships while limiting adversary
access to client states; a tool of nuanced influence, not outright
coercion]{.underline}. In fact, [threatening to withhold arms sales to
coerce a state into changing its behavior often has the opposite effect,
leading clients to diversify their arms sourcing instead of shifting
course]{.underline}. Similarly, [calls to restrict technology transfer
and worries about demands for direct offsets mistake what is known as
"design technology transfer" for the much more difficult "capacity"
level of transfer]{.underline}. Both are explained in more detail below,
but for now it is worth noting that design transfer, the level at which
most of these offsets occur, does not lead to the creation of an
independent defense industry, but instead provides the United States
with a source of political power. The United States should not fear
technology transfer, but with the appropriate end-user controls,
encourage it. [Additionally, while a large domestic market provides the
United States the luxury of sacrificing financial gains for political
influence, sometimes economics do matter; especially when it comes to
preserving complex production lines for future flexibility]{.underline}.
Finally, [the United States should not look to use an arms embargo to
coerce Saudi policy change, not for economic reasons, but simply because
it is unlikely to work]{.underline}. Greasing the Skids, Not Twisting
Arms [Arms sales are useful tools for maintaining]{.underline}
communication, strengthening [relationships]{.underline}, and keeping
potential adversary states at bay. [Conversely, as a blunt instrument of
coercion]{.underline} (i.e. if you do not do X, we will suspend Y),
[they are likely losers]{.underline}. Senior U.S. government officials
involved in the arms transfer process that I interviewed over the past
year during the course of my research have echoed similar sentiments.
This is also borne out by previous research providing evidence that
using arms transfers as situationally coercive tools is rarely
successful. [Interestingly, coercion attempts using arms transfers are
least likely to be successful when used as a punishment or threat
against an autocratic regime, such as Saudi Arabia]{.underline}.
Instead, [punishments in the form of an embargo can often push a client
to diversify sourcing rather than to change behavior]{.underline}.
Consider Indonesia and Egypt. [In 2015, Egypt agreed to purchase nearly
50 Russian]{.underline} MiG-29M/[M2s and more than two-dozen French
Rafales. This represented a shocking turn of events after more than
three decades of purchasing only American-made fighter
jets]{.underline}. [It was also driven largely by the U.S. embargo put
in place in 2013]{.underline}, after the Egyptian army's removal of
then-President Mohamed Morsi, who had won the presidency in a 2012
election. [The embargo caused significant tension between the two states
driven by "an Egyptian sense that they were at a point of mortal peril"
while the United States was moralizing about democratic
reforms]{.underline}. Remarkably, [the United States lifted the embargo
in 2015 with virtually no change in Egyptian policies, no official U.S.
"democracy certification", and Egyptian military support for the
Saudi-led war in Yemen]{.underline}. The U.S. arms embargo as a tool of
coercive change was an abject failure. [A similar story played out in
Indonesia more than a decade prior]{.underline}. A long-time arms client
of the United States with no history of Russian imports, Indonesia
announced a deal with Russia in 2003 to purchase Russian Su-27/30s.
While Indonesia was always far more politically neutral than Egypt, this
remarkable turnaround in arms sourcing diversification appears to be the
result of a U.S. arms embargo implemented in 1999 in response to
Indonesia's apparent human rights violations carrying out heavy-handed
military actions in East Timor. Furious at U.S. meddling in something
the government considered a domestic issue, Indonesia looked instead to
Russia with the specific intent to "overcome the effects of \[U.S.\]
arms sales restrictions." In other words, Indonesia looked to diversify,
not capitulate. [Indonesia continued sourcing Russian arms even after
the United States lifted the embargo in 2005. Perhaps most remarkably,
even after the United States agreed to give Indonesia 24 F-16s in 2012,
the archipelago state still agreed to purchase 11 Russian
Su-35s]{.underline}. [The U.S. attempt at coercion not only failed but
continues to perpetuate negative strategic effects today]{.underline}.
Who's Afraid of Technology Transfer? Another argument for a more
restrictive arms export policy concerns direct industrial offsets (those
economic agreements in which a supplier invests in the industry of a
client state directly related to the arms being transferred) and
technology transfer. However, these tools should not be feared.
Technology transfer is unlikely to breed meaningful competition for the
United States where it matters most, in the medium- to high-end markets,
and instead gives the United States a source of political influence. The
problem in many analyses is confusion over the type of technology
transfer. There are three ideal-typical categories of transfer: material
transfer, such as simple diffusion of weapons and machines; design
transfer, like blueprints and schematics; and capacity transfer, which
involves basic scientific knowledge and expertise within the industrial
base. Most technology transfers ultimately fall into the first two
categories, despite what a client state might hope for. Consider the
2003 Polish decision to purchase F-16s from Lockheed Martin with direct
offsets valued at more than \$6 billion. This represented 170 percent of
the program value and the then-largest in commercial history. Despite
this massive investment, Poland does not design and produce their own
fighter jets today, but rather subsections of American-designed systems
under license. In fact, direct offsets provided inroads for U.S.
industry in the Polish defense industry in a manner that strongly
incentivizes the Poles to continue purchasing U.S. aircraft, and indeed
Poland appears poised to purchase the F-35 in the near future. Offsets
and technology transfer may have helped revive portions of the Polish
defense industry and provided some domestic job creation, but it did not
create an independent competitor to the U.S. defense industry. This is
exactly as expected with material and design levels of transfer. While
some of the very largest industrial states, such as India or China,
might eventually create a world-leading defense industry, it will remain
out of the grasp of most states. Consider China, an unquestionable
economic powerhouse of recent decades. Despite decades of arms
purchases, technology transfer, blatant reverse engineering attempts,
and hundreds of billions of dollars, China still turns to Russia for
help with the most advanced weaponry such as fighter jets, helicopters,
surface-to-air missiles, radars, and jet engines. If China, the second
largest economy in the world struggles so mightily, what threat do
smaller, less capable states pose? Capacity transfer, the acquisition of
basic scientific knowledge and expertise crafted over decades, cannot
simply be uploaded, emailed to another state, or hacked. Rather, it
takes decades of intentional and costly investment. For high-end
weaponry, where research and development costs remain a prohibitive
barrier to entry, the United States and a handful of other advanced
economies are likely to remain in the driver's seat; even with generous
technology transfer agreements. Finally, consider some of the negative
second- and third-order effects that excessive restriction caused in
American unwillingness to commit to selling the U.S.-made Patriot
missile system and its underlying technology to Turkey. This was
recently posited as a U.S. export restriction success. However, this
restraint looks less successful each passing day. Even with significant
design transfer, it is unlikely Turkey could obtain the requisite
capacity transfer to be self-sufficient in surface-to-air and
anti-missile defense systems anytime soon. Conversely, by using U.S.
technology, the United States could have legally restricted Turkey's
future export of it. More importantly, Turkey has since agreed to
purchase Russia's advanced S-400 surface-to-air missile system, a blow
to U.S. and NATO relations with Turkey. The S-400 purchase will put
advanced Russian technology and military advisors inside a NATO ally and
tier-two F-35 industrial partner that is a sole-source supplier on
several F-35 components. As the Air Force Secretary said last year about
Turkey's S-400 agreement, "Sometimes it's the United States that's part
of the problem." Even worse, the United States has since approved the
sale of the Patriot to Turkey, with the acting U.S. Defense Secretary
recently commenting, "we need Turkey to buy the Patriot." Was holding
back on some surface-to-air missile technology worth the strategic cost?
It appears unlikely. Sometimes It's Not Dollars, But Sense As others
have pointed out, the United States can afford to "make economic \[...\]
sacrifices" in order to privilege politico-security benefits in arms
export decisions. As one author recently explained in War on the Rocks:
The United States is so economically advantaged in making and selling
weapons that it can limit conventional-weapons proliferation \[and\] ...
technology diffusion, (and maintain a robust defense industrial base)
while retaining its commanding market position. This is undoubtedly
true. However, on rare occasions economics do matter. Specifically,
maintaining strategic flexibility by keeping a production line open
which would otherwise shutter might sometimes need to be prioritized.
Consider the two recent examples of the F-22 and F-15. In December 2011,
the final F-22 fighter jet rolled off the assembly line, 554 short of
the original program requirement. At the same time, close U.S. allies
such as Japan and Australia made inquiries about purchasing further
increments of the fifth-generation fighter, which would have kept
production going for at least several more years. The United States
rejected the inquiries, shuttering the production line instead. A 2011
RAND Corporation study estimates the cost of restarting production and
fabricating 75 additional F-22s to be \$17 billion --- nearly \$227
million per jet. Despite this cost and because of an evolving
international security environment, the US Congress inserted language
into the 2017 defense budget directing the U.S. Air Force to conduct a
"production restart assessment," though the likelihood of a production
restart remains infinitesimally small. Fortunately, the outcome is
different for the F-15. In 2013, Qatar made a request for the purchase
of 70 F-15QAs, worth \$4 billion. At the time, without another export
order the 40-year old F-15 production line was slated to close by 2019,
eliminating any future purchases. After delaying approval for nearly
three years, the U.S. administration finally approved the deal in late
2016, guaranteeing F-15 production into the mid-2020s. Unlike the F-22,
the United States maintains strategic flexibility in F-15 (and F-18 and
F-16) production, largely because of exports. This appears to be an
especially prescient decision, as the FY2020 U.S. Air Force budget
proposal requests money to purchase at least eight (and up to 100)
F-15EX air superiority platforms; a platform one industry reporter
highlighted "is only possible because other countries have spent roughly
\$5B over the last couple of decades to continuously evolve the F-15
into what it is today \[...\] basically, the \[Air Force\] is getting
\[these upgrades\] for free." [What About Saudi Arabia? In sum, more
restrictive arms sales, delivery suspensions, or outright embargos are
unlikely to succeed in policy coercion]{.underline}. [While arms
transfers provide an avenue of influence, embargos often lead to
diversification, not desired policy changes]{.underline}. Additionally,
fears of technology transfer and direct offsets creating a competitor
out of every client are generally unfounded in the high-end market in
which the United States generally deals. Finally, [while the large
domestic market provides the United States the luxury of sacrificing
financial gains for political influence, sometimes economics do matter,
particularly when it comes to saving a production line for future
flexibility]{.underline}. [These conclusions should therefore inform
U.S. policy on Saudi Arabia. The intent here is not to argue the moral
or ethical responsibility of U.S. leaders in responding to Saudi
Arabia's execution of journalists or tactics in the war in
Yemen]{.underline}. It is natural to see the horror wrought in Yemen and
want to take any actions necessary to stop it. However, I ultimately
argue against a Saudi embargo. This is not because, as the president has
argued, it might cost a few billion dollars and some hundreds of defense
industry jobs. As others have pointed out, [the economic impact of Saudi
arms purchases on the U.S. defense industry is relatively small. Rather,
embargoing Saudi Arabia is unlikely to fundamentally alter Saudi
policies, but likely to further damage U.S. ties with
Riyadh]{.underline}. In the near-term, Saudi Arabia can substitute other
weapons, such as the Eurofighter and Tornado, and "dumb bombs" instead
of U.S.-built "smart weapons." The Saudis can also rely more heavily on
their Emirati and Egyptian partners using non-U.S. produced arms. [In
the medium to long term, such an embargo is likely to push the Kingdom
to greater arms diversification. If history is any guide, the United
States will eventually lift any potential arms embargo with little
change in Saudi behavior, but only after having provided an opportunity
for adversary states such as Russia and China to gain a strategic
foothold in Riyadh]{.underline}. Some might counter that it would be
extremely difficult and costly, in both time and money, for the Saudis
to significantly diversify their arms acquisitions away from the United
States. This is absolutely the case. However, costly does not mean
impossible. Less wealthy states have already done it. Egypt is one
example above; but others such as Venezuela and even tiny Kuwait ---
frustrated at years of U.S. approval delays --- have significantly
diversified their arms acquisitions. [In other words, with the money and
options available to Saudi Arabia, and few other producers showing a
stomach for a full embargo, it is not unreasonable to believe that the
Saudis might significantly diversify their arms acquisitions over time
in response to a U.S. embargo]{.underline}. [Thus, while a U.S. embargo
might be morally compelling and emotionally satisfying, it is unlikely
to create meaningful change for those most at risk or be strategically
beneficial to the United States]{.underline}. In the absence of a
compelling, evidence-based case that an arms embargo on Saudi Arabia
might produce desired changes in behavior, policymakers should look
elsewhere for solutions to their Saudi problems.

A ferocious debate over this question is raging in Washington at this
very moment, and the stakes are high.

[On one side of the debate are many in the media]{.underline}, along
with numerous former advisors to President Barack Obama. [They have
never liked how close Washington has been with Riyadh and they are
freshly determined to smash the Saudis in the mouth because of the
murder of Jamal Khashoggi, the Saudi journalist]{.underline}.

Most of these voices had no problem with President Obama cutting a
nuclear deal with Iran --- one of America's most dangerous enemies and
certainly the worst terrorist state on the planet. Despite Iran's
history of murdering thousands of their own people and others throughout
the Middle East (now especially in Syria and Yemen), these voices saw no
problem with providing the ayatollahs with \$150 billion in cash,
removing economic sanctions from Iran, or legitimizing Tehran's
previously illegal enrichment of uranium. They never once during the
process seriously tried to require Iran to stop funding terrorism,
building longer range missiles, or sowing seeds of revolution and
destruction throughout the Middle East. But the Saudis, oh the Saudis,
these folks claim, these are the blood-thirsty despots who really need
to be punished.

[What's more, a growing number of Republicans on Capitol Hill are also
ready to impose severe punishments on the entire Saudi government over
the Khashoggi affair. Some are calling into question the nature of the
alliance itself]{.underline}.

[On the other side of the debate are those who fully agree that the
Khashoggi murder was despicable and must be punished, but are calling
for cooler heads to prevail when it comes to upending American policy in
the Gulf region]{.underline}. They make the case that [we need the
Saudis to help us counter Iran and Russia in the Middle
East]{.underline}, to help us fight the Radicals like al Qaeda, ISIS and
the Muslim Brotherhood, to keep oil flowing, [and hopefully to advance
Arab-Israeli peace]{.underline}.

[They make the case that the 33 year-old Saudi Crown Prince is making
bold, serious, and important reforms at home, and wants to work more
closely with the U.S. and the West. Yes, he has made mistakes, even
serious ones. But he should be helped, coached, encouraged, not cut
loose]{.underline}.

What's more, [these voices caution that punishing the entire Saudi
government --- rather than targeting the operatives responsible for the
crime --- would be a serious mistake, one that could rupture the
alliance. Some worry that if Washington hits the Saudis too hard, this
could drive Riyadh into the waiting (eager) arms of Vladimir Putin and
the Russians, and/or into the arms of the Chinese]{.underline}.

[Putin is headed to the G20 summit in Argentina and plans to meet with
the Saudi delegation. He would absolutely love to flip Riyadh from the
American camp into the Russian orbit. I don't believe]{.underline} Saudi
King Salman or Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman ([MBS]{.underline}) [are
inclined at the moment to switch sides to the Kremlin. But I fully
expect Putin to make a very tempting offer. And who knows where the king
and his son might wind up if most of Washington loses focus on U.S.
national security interests in the region]{.underline}, in addition to
our enormously important human rights concerns.

#### Increasing Russian influence ensures expansionism and a war over the Ukraine -- arms sales are key to Russia's strategy 

**Hall 2019** (Jonathan Hall, security and political risk analyst
focused on Eurasian geopolitics, military affairs, and emerging
technologies, \"Western Sanctions Are Driving Russia's Focus on the
Middle East\", Fair Observer, April 15 2019,
<https://www.fairobserver.com/region/middle_east_north_africa/western-sanctions-russia-economy-syria-ukraine-middle-east-news-00171/>,
mmv)

September 30, 2015, marked the beginning of Russia's official
involvement in Syria at the request of President Assad, opening with
airstrikes around the cities of Homs and Hama in western Syria against
the mainstream opposition forces. [With the war in eastern Ukraine
already being waged for over a year at that point, the two conflicts
have since been inextricably linked. Some analysts posit that Russia's
incursion into Syria serves the same purpose as prior aggressions in
Ukraine, namely dismantling the current Western-led world
order]{.underline} that has been in place since World War II.
[Concerning this link, Russia's President Vladimir Putin likely knew he
would be able to use any gains in the Middle East in his favor
concerning Ukraine.]{.underline} However, these gains, when seen through
a wider lens than just the regional context of Ukraine, provide a
clearer analysis of the economically and geopolitically revitalized
bargaining position given to the Kremlin on issues with transatlantic
partners writ large and, therefore, certainly concerning Donbas and
Crimea. Throughout 2014, as US and EU sanctions began to accumulate, the
ruble was at one point devalued by roughly 50%. While Moscow has
reclaimed some economic stability, the strength of the Russian currency,
which is currently priced at 65 against the US dollar, is no where near
its former status of around 35 rubles against the dollar. While
sanctions have certainly hurt Russia's economy, the drop in the global
oil prices had a much more significant effect. Russia's long-term budget
projections placed oil above \$100 per barrel; however, at certain
points in 2016, the price fell below \$30. Moscow's economic
difficulties were further compounded by the budgetary pressures
self-imposed by its activities in Ukraine, as well as the economic shock
experienced during the 2008-09 global financial crisis that drained
central reserves. Even if the sanctions were never imposed, some suggest
the Kremlin would still have found itself in a difficult position.
Irrespective of sanctions staying in place, last year the State Duma
reviewed the federal budget and projected a surplus of 0.5% of GDP,
equating to around \$7.7 billion. This was the first expected surplus
since 2011, which displays the preponderant effect of oil over Western
sanctions given that 2012 marked the beginning of a drop in global oil
prices. The World Bank confirmed such reports, forecasting 1.5% GDP
growth in 2018, followed by an increase of 1.8% from 2019-20. Entering
Syria [Although the financial losses due to sanctions have not had the
same effect as declining oil prices, they have certainly taken their
toll]{.underline}. Resumed business with the EU and the US would be the
best-case scenario for Russia. However, this would only begin to be a
possibility after the Kremlin put forth a concerted effort to work with
the international community to bring about peace in the region. Moscow,
however, understands that an abrupt end to the fighting in Donbas, in
which it has only marginally admitted involvement, would be highly
unlikely, especially while trying to save face on both the international
stage as well as in front of domestic audiences. Given this reality,
[Russia appears fully committed to increasing relations in the Middle
East not only militarily, but also economically]{.underline}, as part of
its eastward pivot toward the MENA region and Asia. Important to note is
that on the list of sanctioned individuals and entities is
Vnesheconombank (VEB), of which Russia's sovereign wealth fund (SWF),
the Russian Direct Investment Fund (RDIF), is a fully owned subsidiary.
Put simply, SWFs serve as state-owned instruments in public finance.
Largely funded by revenues from commodity exports or from foreign
exchange reserves in a state's central bank, SWFs may be used to invest
globally. As such, [Russia has begun to circumvent the economic hardship
of sanctions and severed business partnerships in the West by
contractually binding itself to other sovereign wealth funds in the
Middle East]{.underline}. While not an exhaustive list of SWF
partnerships, the following are the most lucrative of contracts set up
through the RDIF, which represent short-term financial reprieve and
long-term economic bargaining power for the Kremlin: the Qatari
Investment Authority has committed over \$2.5 billion in assets to
Russia, mostly within Russia's oil giant Rosneft; Saudi Arabia's Public
Investment Fund invested \$10 billion, mostly focused on technology and
energy; and Abu Dhabi, for its part, has set up a \$3 billion fund with
the RDIF, focused on developing Russia's southern infrastructure and
agricultural sectors. Arms Sales [Apart from direct SWF investment,
Russia's arms industry has also received a huge boon since Russia
commenced military operations in Syria]{.underline}. The importance of
this can be seen from former deputy prime minister, Dmitry Rogozin,
stating that "[arms sales are the most important element of Moscow's
relations with other countries]{.underline}." For example, in 2009
Moscow sold roughly \$9 billion in arms to the MENA region. In 2016,
that number rose to \$21.4 billion. [With the MENA region quickly
becoming Russia's most profitable destination in terms of exporting
arms, behind Asia, the correlation of foreign policy interests is
clear]{.underline}. The Kremlin has used the war as effective
advertising from the very beginning. In early October, shortly after
Russia officially entered the war on behalf of Assad's regime, Moscow
fired 26 cruise missiles from its Caspian Sea flotilla, hitting various
targets in Syria. Although it could be argued that the same objective
could have been carried out through military capabilities already
in-country, Russia was able to broadcast its new technology on a global
scale. Shortly after, [customers from the Middle East and abroad began
to line up to buy various weapons systems.]{.underline} The key example
of this success would be Tehran resuming its position as a top-tier
client following the 2015 Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (and
Russia's assistance in the process) placing weapon orders to the sum of
\$10 billion. [For the near future, any economic gains achieved by the
Russian Federation may directly affect its position moving forward
concerning Ukraine]{.underline}. The Kremlin has been hemorrhaging money
in backing separatist activities and financing its own operations in
Donbas and Crimea. [Arms sales and economic partnerships in the Middle
East]{.underline} and North Africa [will provide the monetary reprieve
Russia needs to shield itself from the financial backlash currently
being sustained]{.underline}. Long-Term Benefits While economic deals
amongst SWFs and recent increases in arms sales provide Russia
assistance in the near-term to face the previous shock to global oil
prices as well as Western sanctions, the mid to long-term implications
of Russia's involvement in the Syrian Civil War are the most important
to analyze. [In terms of bilateral cooperation in the Middle East,
relations with Iran are the most important for Russia]{.underline}. A
major consumer of Russian arms, Moscow sees Tehran as a "regional
superpower" given Iran's extensive involvement in the war in Syria, its
support for Hamas and Hezbollah, as well as the question of its future
nuclear capabilities. [Russia also views Tehran as a reliable partner
with whom it can successfully counter the US presence in the Black Sea,
the Caspian region and the Middle East]{.underline}, in addition to
controlling Sunni extremism within Russia's near-abroad --- the North
Caucasus and Central Asia. While the war in Syria will eventually come
to an end, Russia has now successfully locked itself into the region
through its access to the Syrian port of Tartus and the Khmeimim
airbase, which it will maintain for at least the next 48 years. [The
geopolitical importance of Russia's permanent military presence in the
region, in concert with growing forms of economic cooperation, may be
better realized through discussion of the north-south
corridor]{.underline}. Introduced by President Putin in 2007, [this
strategic initiative is based upon a mixture of financial planning and
political enterprise. Moscow's goal with the so-called north-south
corridor is to utilize its partnerships in the Middle East and create a
staging ground for further economic and political cooperation in Africa
and the "global south]{.underline}." One example of this is a deal
likely brokered thanks to SWF investments in Abu Dhabi's defense sector
for Moscow to create an air hub in the UAE. Through this hub, Russia
will be able to deliver infrastructure projects and humanitarian aid.
[Should Russia continue to gain political clout throughout the MENA
region, the European Union may find itself dealing with Russia as its
main interlocutor for issues such as the ongoing refugee
crisis]{.underline}. In many European countries, issues concerning
migration flows are dominating the discourse in the media and political
spheres. [Domestic political concerns will likely take precedence over
the war in Ukraine. Therefore, Russia's ability to provide concessions
--- for example through growing its influence in Libya --- to work with
the EU in dealing with migration may, in turn, lead to unfavorable
tradeoffs for Ukraine]{.underline}. The trends regarding military and
economic cooperation between Russia and its Middle Eastern partners may
have begun well before the annexation of Crimea. However, it is apparent
that Western sanctions and political pressure have since driven the
Kremlin farther east, accelerating its efforts. This divergence does not
appear to be coming solely out of desperation after the loss of Western
investment, but rather because of the real promise Moscow sees in its
increasingly eastward-leaning strategic focus. [Russia's enlarged
presence in the Middle East]{.underline}, particularly as it relates to
renewed ties with Iran and the potential access this [will give the
Kremlin to developments in Africa, clearly displays the war in Syria as
just the beginning]{.underline}. [Any increased influence in these
regions will come at the expense of transatlantic partners and will
shift bargaining positions when it comes to its dealings with Russia,
namely as it pertains to Ukraine]{.underline}. [If these trends persist,
in addition to rising oil prices, some rethinking will be required when
it comes to countering Russia in Ukraine as sanctions may become less
and less relevant. If this is the case, expect the Russian Federation to
become economically more viable, geographically more influential and, as
a result,]{.underline} perhaps [more aggressive in eastern
Ukraine]{.underline}.

### 1NC -- Terrorism

#### U.S.-Relations are at an all-time high due to Trump's catering of MBS

**CFR, 2018** -- \[CFR is a think tank specializing in U.S. foreign
policy and international affairs, "U.S.-Saudi Arabia Relations,"
12/7/18, https://www.cfr.org/backgrounder/us-saudi-arabia-relations\]

**[The U.S.-Saudi Arabia alliance is built on decades of security
cooperation and strong business ties dominated by U.S. interests in
Saudi oil]{.underline}**. The relationship has survived severe
challenges, including the 1973 oil embargo and 9/11 attacks, in which
fifteen of the nineteen passenger jet hijackers were Saudi citizens.
**[Successive U.S. administrations have held that Saudi Arabia is a
critical strategic partner in the region.]{.underline}** **[Relations
between the two countries have grown especially warm under U.S.
President Donald J. Trump and Saudi de facto leader Mohammed bin Salman,
who was elevated to crown prince in mid-2017.]{.underline}** **[Both
have ramped up efforts to counter Iran, Saudi Arabia's main regional
rival.]{.underline}** However, recent actions under the crown prince's
leadership, particularly the killing of journalist Jamal Khashoggi, are
posing new strains on the alliance, as many members of the U.S. Congress
have called for punishing Riyadh and reassessing the relationship.

#### Alliances with Saudi Arabia are Key to solve Terrorism in the Middle East

**Byman 2016,** - \[Daniel Byman is a senior fellow in the Center for
Middle East Policy at Brookings, where his research focuses on
counterterrorism and Middle East security, and a Georgetown University
Professor; "Saudi Arabia and terrorism today;" 9/29/16;
https://www.brookings.edu/blog/markaz/2016/09/29/saudi-arabia-and-terrorism-today/\]

Congress' override of President Obama's veto to allow Americans to sue
Saudi Arabia for links to the 9/11 plot raises many questions, not least
of which is the relationship between Saudi Arabia and terrorist groups
today. As I testified earlier this year, **[Saudi Arabia has made
considerable progress on counterterrorism in the last 15
years]{.underline}** but still has a long way to go. Before the
September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks, and really until al-Qaida began to
attack the Kingdom directly in May 2003, Saudi Arabia was often
uncooperative on counterterrorism and more part of the problem than part
of the solution. Since 2003**[, the Saudi regime has emerged as a vital
counterterrorism partner, and several important successes against
al-Qaida in particular are due in large part to Saudi
cooperation.]{.underline}** Yet it's not a simple story of progress: the
Kingdom engages in many troubling behaviors today that make the
terrorism problem worse. In the end, **[policymakers would do well to
remember that Saudi Arabia is a key partner]{.underline}** but not a
friend: **[the United States and Saudi Arabia share many common
interests,]{.underline}** but they do not share common values or a
common worldview. Understanding Saudi Arabia's relationship with
terrorists, however, is far more difficult than assessing Iran's backing
of terrorism, which is open, extensive, and state-sponsored. Much of
Saudi support is done by non-state actors. Yet being "non-state" does
not absolve the Saudi government of responsibility. These non-state
actors enjoy a range of relationships to the Saudi regime. Some receive
or did receive official patronage. Others, particularly those tied to
leading clerics in the Kingdom, are embraced indirectly by the regime's
self-proclaimed role as Defender of the Faithful. And still others are
truly private, acting independently of the government and in times in
opposition to it. In addition, the Saudi royal family itself occupies an
unusual role. In one sense, the royal family---with its tens of
thousands of princes---is not the government. However, the family's and
the government's finances are interwoven, and if a prince supports a
group it has an unofficial imprimatur of approval. King Salman himself,
for example, helped raise money for the mujahedin in Afghanistan and the
Balkans. Many of these voices are responsible for indoctrination rather
than direct violence. That is to say they might propagate views on the
Satanic nature of Jews, the apostasy of Shiites, or the heretical nature
of the Ahmadiyyas, as well as the legitimacy of using violence to fight
foreign occupiers of Muslim lands---be it Indian forces in Kashmir, U.S.
forces in Iraq, or Israeli forces in historic Palestine. Such support,
in the United States, would often be considered distasteful but part of
protected free speech. For terrorists, however, it can prove invaluable
as it provides theological legitimacy for their actions, enabling them
to attract recruits and funds. **[Washington's ability to influence the
Kingdom is limited, however, given the Saudi domestic sensitivities of
these issues. U.S. pressure under the Bush and Obama administrations has
moved Saudi Arabia away from many dangerous activities and has helped
transform Saudi capacity in fighting terrorism.]{.underline}** Even if
the key motivation was the change in the perceived threat to the Kingdom
itself rather than U.S. influence, these are considerable successes that
deserve recognition. Changing Saudi policy still further is difficult.
Although the United States has sold the Kingdom almost \$100 billion in
arms during the Obama administration, the Saudi media remains critical
of the president as unreliable and hostile to the Kingdom. Riyadh,
moreover, is frustrated with U.S. policy regarding Iran in particular,
but also in the region in general. Saudi Arabia backed the coup in
Egypt, in opposition to U.S. policy, and Saudi leaders were previously
outraged that the United States abandoned the Mubarak regime. The Obama
administration has largely abandoned criticizing the Saudi regime on
human rights grounds, but it is important to remember that most Saudis
do not share U.S. values regarding women's and homosexual rights,
religious liberty, and other basic freedoms that are fundamental to
American society. Many issues regarding counterterrorism---particularly
the promotion of extremism abroad via sectarianism and criticism of
non-Muslims---touch on core domestic political issues vital to the
regime's legitimacy and very survival. **[Change in these areas will at
best be slow, and the United States should expect progress to end or
even reverse should the regime's domestic situation face
challenges.]{.underline}** Quiet pressure is almost always best when
trying to change Saudi policy. The small circle of decisionmakers in
Saudi Arabia does not take well to public embarrassment, and they
believe strongly in the value of close personal relationships. To be
effective, U.S. pressure must involve top officials, including the
president. Otherwise, it will simply be ignored or may even prove
counterproductive**[. Saudi Arabia is a vital partner in the struggle to
defeat the Islamic State, al-Qaida, and other groups.]{.underline}** But
it is not a friend. **[Demonizing Saudi Arabia does not help advance
U.S. interests,]{.underline}** but nor should critics of U.S. policy in
the region see Washington and Riyadh as fully aligned given the profound
difference in values.

#### Laundry list of impacts to Middle East terror -- oil prices, econ collapse, and global escalation 

**Moeller 2016** -- \[Hans Mathias Moeller is a contributor at Global
Risk Insight; "Assessing the impact of Saudi Arabia's suicide bombings;"
7/17/16;
https://globalriskinsights.com/2016/07/impact-saudi-arabia-suicide-bombings/\]

On July 4th, **[three suicide attacks occurred across Saudi Arabia,
including one in Medina near the Prophet's Mohammad's Mosque, one failed
attack in the vicinity of the U.S. Consulate in Jeddah, and another
failed attack at a Shiite mosque in Qatif in the Eastern
Province]{.underline}**. No group has claimed responsibility for the
attacks to date, but stated intentions, objectives, a history of recent
attacks, and the tactics and procedures of the attacks point towards the
Islamic State in Iraq and the Levant (ISIS). How have markets reacted to
the attacks? **[The nearly coordinated suicide attacks in Saudi Arabia
are unusual and should at least in theory have impacted the global
financial markets.]{.underline}** However, no significant impact was
noticed on the global stock market index, and there was no change in
global oil prices. A likely explanation is that the suicide attacks
occurred the week of Eid al-Fitr or the celebration of the end of
Ramadan. Most stock market trading in the Middle East was closed for
days during this week. Another explanation is that the three attacks in
Saudi Arabia, two of which failed, were overshadowed by spectacular
terrorist attacks in Istanbul, Turkey, Bagdad, Iraq, and Dhaka,
Bangladesh that garnered more media attention. **[Previous terrorist
attacks in Saudi Arabia did affect oil prices]{.underline}**.
Commerzbank notes in response to **[the three attacks]{.underline}**
that similar attacks only a few years ago **[would have resulted in oil
prices rising sharply]{.underline}**. The global oil markets now appear
to have accepted that ISIS is attacking Saudi Arabia without it
impacting oil prices. How might the bombings impact Saudi's tourism
industry? The impact of the recent suicide attacks on the tourism sector
will likely be low to insignificant. One-off events such as the attack
near the Medina mosque tend to fade from the public memory over time,
and government incentives and advertisement for the tourist industry
will help preserve Saudi tourism. **[The situation could be very
different if ISIS sustains a campaign against foreigners and soft
targets in the tourism sector such as hotels, shopping malls, airport
terminals, and religious tourist destinations, including Medina and
Mecca.]{.underline}** A sustained terrorist campaign would taint the
image of these locations, as it could significantly undermine Saudi
efforts to expand the tourist sector if tourists opt for safer
destinations. The reality is that, over the past two years, ISIS has
primarily targeted police and security forces across Saudi Arabia as
well as Shiite civilians and religious targets in the Eastern Province.
The Saudi Interior Ministry reported in June 2016 that 26 ISIS-related
terrorist attacks have occurred since the beginning of 2015.
Nonetheless, the attack near the holy site in Medina is unprecedented in
recent history in that Salafi Jihadists in Saudi Arabia have never
attacked such a holy site. **[The attack can be seen as an attempt to
undermine the religious legitimacy decreed by the royal family. Another
possibility is that the attack signifies a target shift to religious
tourist sites.]{.underline}** From the ISIS perspective, such a target
shift would make sense if the strategic objective is to undermine the
Saudi economy and the House of Saud. The Medina attack is timely in that
it occurred approximately two months after Saudi Arabia's Deputy Crown
Prince Mohammed bin Salman revealed a blueprint titled, "Saudi Vision
2030." The blueprint aims to transform the Saudi oil-dependent economy
to a more diversified economy, focused on increasing the number of
religious tourists making the annual pilgrimage to Saudi Arabia. The
blueprint also calls to open doors to tourism from all nationalities.
**[An ISIS campaign against tourist sites and foreigners could deliver
an economic setback for the kingdom, particularly at a time when oil
revenues are dropping.]{.underline}** If the Medina attack is the
beginning of a new ISIS campaign against religious tourist targets in
Saudi Arabia, then terrorist attacks in Medina and Mecca during the time
leading up to the annual pilgrimage in September with up to 2 million
tourists, cannot be ruled out. What challenges remain for Saudi's
security situation? **[The latest strings of terrorist attacks are only
one of many security concerns for Saudi Arabia]{.underline}**. The
kingdom is facing a potential outbreak of sectarian violence between the
Saudi government and Shiite Muslims in its Eastern Province. The Eastern
Province has a strategic economic significance, as it is a vital
industrial hub and home to critical oil infrastructure and gas and oil
fields**[. Economic activity in the Eastern Province accounts for
roughly 60% of Saudi Arabia's GDP. Any form of civil unrest and
intrastate conflict would likely undermine the Saudi economy. It is,
therefore, no coincidence that ISIS has focused many of its attacks on
the Saudi Shiite community and mosques in Qatif and al-Hasa in the
Eastern Province in an attempt to drive a wedge between Shiites and the
government to fuel sectarian violence, which ISIS tried most recently in
Qatif on July 4th]{.underline}**. The stability inside the kingdom is
intertwined with the current security situation in Iraq and the future
of ISIS. Saudi Arabia is bordered by Iraq to the north and is a member
of the U.S. led coalition fighting ISIS. In June 2016, the U.S. State
Department estimated that ISIS had lost 47 percent of the territory
previously controlled in Iraq. If ISIS continues to lose territory and
suffer losses in Iraq and Syria, it could morph itself from a terror
state into a terrorist organization after which foreign fighters would
return home to pursue ISIS's objectives. For example, **[Saudi fighters
could return to Saudi Arabia and target the Saudi royal family and the
Shiite community, which is a stated objective of Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi,
the leader of ISIS]{.underline}**. The Soufan Group estimates that 2,500
Saudis have joined the conflict in Syria and Iraq. **[If Saudi fighters
decide to return to Saudi Arabia, equipped with battlefield experience,
leadership and bomb-making skills, the number of terrorist attacks could
increase along with the level of sophistication of the
attacks.]{.underline}** **[Saudi Arabia is also facing spillover
violence from the civil war in Yemen, which lies along its southern
border.]{.underline}** On July 4th, Saudi air defense intercepted a
ballistic missile fired over its southern border by Houthi Shiite rebels
towards the southern city of Abha. The Houthi Shiite rebels, a Zyadi
Shia movement, overthrew the former Yemeni government in September
2014**[. The Houthis control a large swath of territory in northern
Yemen on the border with Saudi Arabia and receive international backing
from Iran.]{.underline}** In response to Iran's backing of the Houthis
and opposition against the U.S. and Saudi dominance on the Arabian
Peninsula, Saudi Arabia staged an intervention in Yemen in March 2015 to
reinstate the former Abd Rabbuh Mansur Hadi-led government. Data by the
National Consortium for the Study of Terrorism and Responses to
Terrorism indicates that **[Houthi Shiite rebels carried out close to 60
terrorist attacks inside Saudi Arabia during 2015 alone.]{.underline}**
In addition to indiscriminate Houthi attacks inside Saudi Arabia, the
chaos **[and ungoverned swaths of territory inside Yemen have offered Al
Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula and ISIS a safe haven from where
potential future attacks can be planned against Saudi
Arabia.]{.underline}**

#### Ending arms sales decks the alliance, causes lash-out, and international fill in 

**Rounds 2019** (Ray Rounds, Ph.D. candidate at Georgetown University in
International Relations, \"THE CASE AGAINST ARMS EMBARGOS, EVEN FOR
SAUDI ARABIA\", War on the Rocks, April 16 2019,
<https://warontherocks.com/2019/04/the-case-against-arms-embargos-even-for-saudi-arabia/>,
mmv)

One area in which U.S. President Donald Trump does not need to worry
about making America great again is international arms sales. The United
States accounts for 34 percent of all global arms sales (second place
Russia remains a distant 23 percent), and has more than 40 defense
companies in the top 100 globally. [However, with civilian deaths caused
by the Saudi-led war in Yemen estimated at between 16,000 and 50,000 by
the end of 2018, calls for the United States to suspend arms sales to
its largest client --- Saudi Arabia --- have understandably gained
traction in both Congress and the public]{.underline}. More generally,
several authors have penned articles in these virtual pages calling for
more selective U.S. arms export decisions or outright embargos, governed
less by economic motivations and more by concern about blowback, human
rights, dispersion, and reducing technology transfer. I respectfully
disagree with all of these recommendations. [Whether it is delayed
approval, as in the recent Kuwaiti F-18 purchase, an outright
embargo]{.underline}, like Egyptian F-16s in 2013, [or denial of
technology transfer]{.underline}, as in the 2016 Turkish Patriot missile
request, [using the withholding of arms sales as a blunt force
instrument of coercion is unlikely to produce desired strategic benefits
and often backfires]{.underline}. [Arms exports are best used for
maintaining or strengthening relationships while limiting adversary
access to client states; a tool of nuanced influence, not outright
coercion]{.underline}. In fact, [threatening to withhold arms sales to
coerce a state into changing its behavior often has the opposite effect,
leading clients to diversify their arms sourcing instead of shifting
course]{.underline}. Similarly, [calls to restrict technology transfer
and worries about demands for direct offsets mistake what is known as
"design technology transfer" for the much more difficult "capacity"
level of transfer]{.underline}. Both are explained in more detail below,
but for now it is worth noting that design transfer, the level at which
most of these offsets occur, does not lead to the creation of an
independent defense industry, but instead provides the United States
with a source of political power. The United States should not fear
technology transfer, but with the appropriate end-user controls,
encourage it. [Additionally, while a large domestic market provides the
United States the luxury of sacrificing financial gains for political
influence, sometimes economics do matter; especially when it comes to
preserving complex production lines for future flexibility]{.underline}.
Finally, [the United States should not look to use an arms embargo to
coerce Saudi policy change, not for economic reasons, but simply because
it is unlikely to work]{.underline}. Greasing the Skids, Not Twisting
Arms [Arms sales are useful tools for maintaining]{.underline}
communication, strengthening [relationships]{.underline}, and keeping
potential adversary states at bay. [Conversely, as a blunt instrument of
coercion]{.underline} (i.e. if you do not do X, we will suspend Y),
[they are likely losers]{.underline}. Senior U.S. government officials
involved in the arms transfer process that I interviewed over the past
year during the course of my research have echoed similar sentiments.
This is also borne out by previous research providing evidence that
using arms transfers as situationally coercive tools is rarely
successful. [Interestingly, coercion attempts using arms transfers are
least likely to be successful when used as a punishment or threat
against an autocratic regime, such as Saudi Arabia]{.underline}.
Instead, [punishments in the form of an embargo can often push a client
to diversify sourcing rather than to change behavior]{.underline}.
Consider Indonesia and Egypt. [In 2015, Egypt agreed to purchase nearly
50 Russian]{.underline} MiG-29M/[M2s and more than two-dozen French
Rafales. This represented a shocking turn of events after more than
three decades of purchasing only American-made fighter
jets]{.underline}. [It was also driven largely by the U.S. embargo put
in place in 2013]{.underline}, after the Egyptian army's removal of
then-President Mohamed Morsi, who had won the presidency in a 2012
election. [The embargo caused significant tension between the two states
driven by "an Egyptian sense that they were at a point of mortal peril"
while the United States was moralizing about democratic
reforms]{.underline}. Remarkably, [the United States lifted the embargo
in 2015 with virtually no change in Egyptian policies, no official U.S.
"democracy certification", and Egyptian military support for the
Saudi-led war in Yemen]{.underline}. The U.S. arms embargo as a tool of
coercive change was an abject failure. [A similar story played out in
Indonesia more than a decade prior]{.underline}. A long-time arms client
of the United States with no history of Russian imports, Indonesia
announced a deal with Russia in 2003 to purchase Russian Su-27/30s.
While Indonesia was always far more politically neutral than Egypt, this
remarkable turnaround in arms sourcing diversification appears to be the
result of a U.S. arms embargo implemented in 1999 in response to
Indonesia's apparent human rights violations carrying out heavy-handed
military actions in East Timor. Furious at U.S. meddling in something
the government considered a domestic issue, Indonesia looked instead to
Russia with the specific intent to "overcome the effects of \[U.S.\]
arms sales restrictions." In other words, Indonesia looked to diversify,
not capitulate. [Indonesia continued sourcing Russian arms even after
the United States lifted the embargo in 2005. Perhaps most remarkably,
even after the United States agreed to give Indonesia 24 F-16s in 2012,
the archipelago state still agreed to purchase 11 Russian
Su-35s]{.underline}. [The U.S. attempt at coercion not only failed but
continues to perpetuate negative strategic effects today]{.underline}.
Who's Afraid of Technology Transfer? Another argument for a more
restrictive arms export policy concerns direct industrial offsets (those
economic agreements in which a supplier invests in the industry of a
client state directly related to the arms being transferred) and
technology transfer. However, these tools should not be feared.
Technology transfer is unlikely to breed meaningful competition for the
United States where it matters most, in the medium- to high-end markets,
and instead gives the United States a source of political influence. The
problem in many analyses is confusion over the type of technology
transfer. There are three ideal-typical categories of transfer: material
transfer, such as simple diffusion of weapons and machines; design
transfer, like blueprints and schematics; and capacity transfer, which
involves basic scientific knowledge and expertise within the industrial
base. Most technology transfers ultimately fall into the first two
categories, despite what a client state might hope for. Consider the
2003 Polish decision to purchase F-16s from Lockheed Martin with direct
offsets valued at more than \$6 billion. This represented 170 percent of
the program value and the then-largest in commercial history. Despite
this massive investment, Poland does not design and produce their own
fighter jets today, but rather subsections of American-designed systems
under license. In fact, direct offsets provided inroads for U.S.
industry in the Polish defense industry in a manner that strongly
incentivizes the Poles to continue purchasing U.S. aircraft, and indeed
Poland appears poised to purchase the F-35 in the near future. Offsets
and technology transfer may have helped revive portions of the Polish
defense industry and provided some domestic job creation, but it did not
create an independent competitor to the U.S. defense industry. This is
exactly as expected with material and design levels of transfer. While
some of the very largest industrial states, such as India or China,
might eventually create a world-leading defense industry, it will remain
out of the grasp of most states. Consider China, an unquestionable
economic powerhouse of recent decades. Despite decades of arms
purchases, technology transfer, blatant reverse engineering attempts,
and hundreds of billions of dollars, China still turns to Russia for
help with the most advanced weaponry such as fighter jets, helicopters,
surface-to-air missiles, radars, and jet engines. If China, the second
largest economy in the world struggles so mightily, what threat do
smaller, less capable states pose? Capacity transfer, the acquisition of
basic scientific knowledge and expertise crafted over decades, cannot
simply be uploaded, emailed to another state, or hacked. Rather, it
takes decades of intentional and costly investment. For high-end
weaponry, where research and development costs remain a prohibitive
barrier to entry, the United States and a handful of other advanced
economies are likely to remain in the driver's seat; even with generous
technology transfer agreements. Finally, consider some of the negative
second- and third-order effects that excessive restriction caused in
American unwillingness to commit to selling the U.S.-made Patriot
missile system and its underlying technology to Turkey. This was
recently posited as a U.S. export restriction success. However, this
restraint looks less successful each passing day. Even with significant
design transfer, it is unlikely Turkey could obtain the requisite
capacity transfer to be self-sufficient in surface-to-air and
anti-missile defense systems anytime soon. Conversely, by using U.S.
technology, the United States could have legally restricted Turkey's
future export of it. More importantly, Turkey has since agreed to
purchase Russia's advanced S-400 surface-to-air missile system, a blow
to U.S. and NATO relations with Turkey. The S-400 purchase will put
advanced Russian technology and military advisors inside a NATO ally and
tier-two F-35 industrial partner that is a sole-source supplier on
several F-35 components. As the Air Force Secretary said last year about
Turkey's S-400 agreement, "Sometimes it's the United States that's part
of the problem." Even worse, the United States has since approved the
sale of the Patriot to Turkey, with the acting U.S. Defense Secretary
recently commenting, "we need Turkey to buy the Patriot." Was holding
back on some surface-to-air missile technology worth the strategic cost?
It appears unlikely. Sometimes It's Not Dollars, But Sense As others
have pointed out, the United States can afford to "make economic \[...\]
sacrifices" in order to privilege politico-security benefits in arms
export decisions. As one author recently explained in War on the Rocks:
The United States is so economically advantaged in making and selling
weapons that it can limit conventional-weapons proliferation \[and\] ...
technology diffusion, (and maintain a robust defense industrial base)
while retaining its commanding market position. This is undoubtedly
true. However, on rare occasions economics do matter. Specifically,
maintaining strategic flexibility by keeping a production line open
which would otherwise shutter might sometimes need to be prioritized.
Consider the two recent examples of the F-22 and F-15. In December 2011,
the final F-22 fighter jet rolled off the assembly line, 554 short of
the original program requirement. At the same time, close U.S. allies
such as Japan and Australia made inquiries about purchasing further
increments of the fifth-generation fighter, which would have kept
production going for at least several more years. The United States
rejected the inquiries, shuttering the production line instead. A 2011
RAND Corporation study estimates the cost of restarting production and
fabricating 75 additional F-22s to be \$17 billion --- nearly \$227
million per jet. Despite this cost and because of an evolving
international security environment, the US Congress inserted language
into the 2017 defense budget directing the U.S. Air Force to conduct a
"production restart assessment," though the likelihood of a production
restart remains infinitesimally small. Fortunately, the outcome is
different for the F-15. In 2013, Qatar made a request for the purchase
of 70 F-15QAs, worth \$4 billion. At the time, without another export
order the 40-year old F-15 production line was slated to close by 2019,
eliminating any future purchases. After delaying approval for nearly
three years, the U.S. administration finally approved the deal in late
2016, guaranteeing F-15 production into the mid-2020s. Unlike the F-22,
the United States maintains strategic flexibility in F-15 (and F-18 and
F-16) production, largely because of exports. This appears to be an
especially prescient decision, as the FY2020 U.S. Air Force budget
proposal requests money to purchase at least eight (and up to 100)
F-15EX air superiority platforms; a platform one industry reporter
highlighted "is only possible because other countries have spent roughly
\$5B over the last couple of decades to continuously evolve the F-15
into what it is today \[...\] basically, the \[Air Force\] is getting
\[these upgrades\] for free." [What About Saudi Arabia? In sum, more
restrictive arms sales, delivery suspensions, or outright embargos are
unlikely to succeed in policy coercion]{.underline}. [While arms
transfers provide an avenue of influence, embargos often lead to
diversification, not desired policy changes]{.underline}. Additionally,
fears of technology transfer and direct offsets creating a competitor
out of every client are generally unfounded in the high-end market in
which the United States generally deals. Finally, [while the large
domestic market provides the United States the luxury of sacrificing
financial gains for political influence, sometimes economics do matter,
particularly when it comes to saving a production line for future
flexibility]{.underline}. [These conclusions should therefore inform
U.S. policy on Saudi Arabia. The intent here is not to argue the moral
or ethical responsibility of U.S. leaders in responding to Saudi
Arabia's execution of journalists or tactics in the war in
Yemen]{.underline}. It is natural to see the horror wrought in Yemen and
want to take any actions necessary to stop it. However, I ultimately
argue against a Saudi embargo. This is not because, as the president has
argued, it might cost a few billion dollars and some hundreds of defense
industry jobs. As others have pointed out, [the economic impact of Saudi
arms purchases on the U.S. defense industry is relatively small. Rather,
embargoing Saudi Arabia is unlikely to fundamentally alter Saudi
policies, but likely to further damage U.S. ties with
Riyadh]{.underline}. In the near-term, Saudi Arabia can substitute other
weapons, such as the Eurofighter and Tornado, and "dumb bombs" instead
of U.S.-built "smart weapons." The Saudis can also rely more heavily on
their Emirati and Egyptian partners using non-U.S. produced arms. [In
the medium to long term, such an embargo is likely to push the Kingdom
to greater arms diversification. If history is any guide, the United
States will eventually lift any potential arms embargo with little
change in Saudi behavior, but only after having provided an opportunity
for adversary states such as Russia and China to gain a strategic
foothold in Riyadh]{.underline}. Some might counter that it would be
extremely difficult and costly, in both time and money, for the Saudis
to significantly diversify their arms acquisitions away from the United
States. This is absolutely the case. However, costly does not mean
impossible. Less wealthy states have already done it. Egypt is one
example above; but others such as Venezuela and even tiny Kuwait ---
frustrated at years of U.S. approval delays --- have significantly
diversified their arms acquisitions. [In other words, with the money and
options available to Saudi Arabia, and few other producers showing a
stomach for a full embargo, it is not unreasonable to believe that the
Saudis might significantly diversify their arms acquisitions over time
in response to a U.S. embargo]{.underline}. [Thus, while a U.S. embargo
might be morally compelling and emotionally satisfying, it is unlikely
to create meaningful change for those most at risk or be strategically
beneficial to the United States]{.underline}. In the absence of a
compelling, evidence-based case that an arms embargo on Saudi Arabia
might produce desired changes in behavior, policymakers should look
elsewhere for solutions to their Saudi problems.

Throughout the conference, participants and attendees kept coming back
to the same critical question: [If the U.S. is slowly disengaging from
the Middle East, will China necessarily fill the void? **The answer is a
qualified yes**]{.underline}. First, because the [Belt and Road
Initiative (BRI) is the most ambitious geopolitical and geo-economic
program since the Marshall Plan]{.underline}, and surpasses it in scope
and costs. The Marshall Plan dealt with the rebuilding of Europe only,
while the U.S. also helped raising Japan from the ashes of World War II.
It was limited in time to four years. [Belt and Road]{.underline},
proclaimed by Chairman Xi Jinping in 2013, [involves over 80 countries
in Eurasia, Europe, South and Southeast Asia, the Middle East and
Africa]{.underline}. Middle East energy will be the lifeblood of BRI,
with China its engine and brain. Western Europe and the developing world
will be its market. [The United States so far failed to offer a
comprehensive, strategic response]{.underline} to Belt and Road, which
would need to include an economic, cultural and human dimension.
Instead, under both the Obama and the Trump Administration, Washington
is sticking to mostly military answers, while ipso facto creating an
anti-American block that includes Russia and China -- something Henry
Kissinger warned against over 40 years ago. Second, [Beijing is
**aggressively bolstering its Near East presence.** China is already
building strategic partnerships with countries from Algeria to Saudi
Arabia to Iran, Iraq, and the UAE]{.underline}. It is targeting major
OPEC and Gulf Cooperation Council members, [while also focusing on U.S.
allies, like Israel, Jordan, Qatar, and Egypt.]{.underline} Following
World War II, the British Lion went home to lick his wounds. The British
Empire could not sustain its presence in the Middle East after losing
its Jewel in the Crown -- India -- in 1947. In the aftermath of the
protracted and costly wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, the American Eagle
wants a respite. Vital national interests of the U.S., chief among them
energy, are no longer bound to the Middle East region due to the shale
gale. Attention is now shifting to the Pacific, as China, the peer
competitor, is not flinching over its South China Sea expansion. The
People's Liberation Army (PLA) Navy is planning to build four carrier
battle groups, and is targeting American aircraft carriers with new
ship-busting nuclear-tipped ballistic missiles. China's high-tech naval
railguns and hypersonic cruise missiles are just around the corner. [The
security of the Middle East]{.underline} and its energy supplies [will
be defined in the next two decades by the **balance of military and
economic power between the U.S., China**, and Russia.]{.underline}
Within the region, [**the confrontation between Saudi Arabia** and the
UAE **vs. Iran** and Qatar will take center stage.]{.underline} Some
Chinese participants at the Singapore conference, such as Prof. Wang
Suolao of Institute of Area Studies in Beijing University, tried to deny
that China is playing geopolitics in the Middle East. However, one
cannot help but analyze the region through the prisms of political
interests, spheres of influence, proxy management, and exclusive
economic zones. [China already maintains a sizeable military base in
Djibouti, at Bab-el-Mandeb, the entrance to the strategically important
Red Sea, which leads to Suez Canal, one of the three principal choke
points of global naval routes (the others being the Strait of Malacca,
and the Panama Canal). Djibouti is also home to an American Naval
Expeditionary Base, Camp Lemonnier, just 11 kilometers
away.]{.underline} The two opposing bases present a fitting metaphor of
competing national interests on the African continent. [**Chinese and
American forces have even engaged in laser skirmishes** there, where
China deployed high energy lasers to blind U.S. pilots. This is just a
telltale symptom of things to come. **China is deploying its economic
and diplomatic power in the Middle East first, while the military
involvement may come later**]{.underline}: the launch of the petro-yuan,
which will exclude the dollar; massive Chinese advantage in mobile
payment tech which would allow 85 million "unbanked" people in the
Middle East to integrate in business and financial activities; the
growth of Chinese tourism to the Gulf; the involvement of Chinese Muslim
communities with the Middle East -- all discussed at the Singapore
conference in great detail. These will be the tools used by Beijing to
expand its influence from Morocco to Muscat -- and beyond. The forum,
led by the NUS Middle East Institute Chairman Bilahari Kausikan,
highlighted the tremendous opportunities and risks facing Asian
(including Singaporean) investments in the Middle East.

**[U.S. restraint also limits the spread of technology, which dampens
global arms races and slows the spread of dangerous advanced weapons
technology, which will eventually diffuse to American
adversaries]{.underline}.** And of course, **[it prevents the emergence
of competitors]{.underline}**, which makes good economic sense as well.
Historically, the United States has practiced "unilateral restraint" by
foregoing exporting its highest-capability weapons to a region until a
viable competing product emerges; for example, refusing to deliver
advanced medium-range air-to-air missiles to Asian states until China
purchased the Russian equivalent R-77. More broadly[, **the United
States, more than any other exporter, jealously guards against the
spread of weapons know-how even to its closest allies**]{.underline}
(often arms exporters themselves[). **A case in point is Turkey's effort
to acquire foreign long-range air and anti-missile defense systems,
hoping to acquire the underlying technology and eventually become a
major arms exporter itself. The U.S.-made Patriot system was eliminated
from consideration because most of its technology would not be given
to** Turkey.]{.underline} Announcing the ultimate deal with Russia,
Turkey's presidential spokesman was frank: "The price difference could
have been manageable. But the issue of technology transfer was more
important. On this issue, our allies, including the United States,
caused a big disappointment." [**The United States, again because of its
market power, can afford this restraint in order to maintain its global

MTC.)

President Donald [Trump]{.underline} went dancing with the Saudi royals
in Riyadh, where he [tried to sell America's principles in exchange for
a mess of weapons contracts]{.underline}. Since then, Secretary of State
Mike Pompeo has become Saudi Arabia's lead PR counsel in America. The
Pentagon is the Saudi regime's premier armorer. [Now]{.underline} Energy
Secretary [Rick Perry is acting as chief nuclear procurer for the
Saudis. "By ramming through the sale of as much as \$80 billion in
nuclear power plants," The New York Times warned recently, "the Trump
administration would provide sensitive knowhow and materials to a
government whose de facto leader, Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, has
suggested that he may eventually want a nuclear weapon as a hedge
against Iran and has shown little concern for what the rest of the world
thinks."]{.underline} Obviously, [Trump has not endorsed a Saudi nuclear
weapon. However, his administration's ongoing attempt to provide the
Kingdom with nuclear technology raises serious questions about U.S.
policy. America's]{.underline} relationship with Riyadh has long been
fraught with tension, inconsistency, and hypocrisy. The [faux friendship
revolves around oil]{.underline}, the lifeblood of the Western economy.
[However, the fracking revolution turned the U.S. into an energy
super-supplier, and]{.underline} other hydrocarbon sources have since
emerged. And [if Washington stopped routinely sanctioning other
governments for not following its dictates, oil producers such as Iran,
Russia, and Venezuela would be supplying international markets, further
reducing Riyadh's importance.]{.underline} American officials like to
promote the Saudis' antediluvian absolute monarchy as the foundation for
Middle East stability. Alas, the price is unrivaled repression[. Despite
the crown prince's reputation as a social reformer, he so far has not
relaxed the Kingdom's totalitarian political or religious controls one
bit.]{.underline} And that brutality has not guaranteed stability.
[Saudi Arabia looks brittle, an artificial, antiquated governing
structure held together by tyranny and bribery. In time, it will likely
lose to demands for justice, equality, and democracy, which have doomed
a host of other corrupt, brutal, Mideast dictatorships, most recently
Sudan's Omar al-Bashir.]{.underline} Outside of the country, [Crown
Prince Mohammed bin Salman (MbS) has pursued a wild and reckless
strategy of regional domination.]{.underline} [Even]{.underline} Senator
Lindsey Graham, perhaps [the United States' most war-happy lawmaker, has
called MbS "crazy," "dangerous," and a "wrecking ball."]{.underline} The
KSA has backed radical Islamists in Syria, subsidized the al-Sisi
dictatorship in Egypt, kidnapped Lebanon's prime minister, used troops
to sustain Bahrain's dictatorial Sunni monarchy, isolated Qatar,
kidnapped and murdered Saudi critics in foreign nations, invaded Yemen,
intensified the Mideast's long-running sectarian conflict, and promoted
General Khalifa Haftar's attack on Libya's internationally recognized
government. [MbS is even willing to court war with Iran if he believes
it's necessary for regional domination.]{.underline} Moreover, the Saudi
royals are not Westerners in different dress. They have poured \$100
billion into the promotion of intolerant fundamentalist Wahhabism around
the world, including in Yemen, where a Saudi-Emirati coalition has
allied with radical jihadists against the Houthis, who had opposed
al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula. [Nuclear weapons would further
embolden MbS. Currently there is no active nuclear program.
Nevertheless, suspicions about Riyadh's intentions are legion. A decade
ago, King Abdullah bin Abdulaziz told U.S. officials that if Iran
acquired a nuke, "we will get nuclear weapons." Last year, MbS said, "If
Iran developed a nuclear bomb, we will follow suit as soon as
possible."]{.underline} Nevertheless, the Trump administration is
pushing the sale of nuclear technology to Saudi Arabia. And no one seems
to know what safeguards will be imposed and whether MbS will abide by
those limits. ["There's a legitimate question over whether such a
government could be trusted with nuclear energy and the potential
weaponization of it,"]{.underline} worries Senator Marco Rubio. Senator
Jeff Merkley agrees: ["The last thing America should do is inadvertently
help develop nuclear weapons for a bad actor on the world
stage."]{.underline} The two are pushing legislation that would give
Congress the final say over any sale. The transfer of nuclear reactors
is usually not controversial, so long as it's accompanied by a
cooperation agreement under Section 123 of the Atomic Energy Act. Deputy
Energy Secretary Dan Brouillette insists, "We won't allow them to bypass
123 if they want to have civilian nuclear power that includes U.S.
nuclear technologies." Legislators remain wary, however, complaining
that seven permits, called "Part 810 authorizations," have been issued
to firms to provide nuclear technology to Saudi Arabia without
notification to Congress. ["I believe the Saudis saw an opportunity with
Trump and \[son-in-law Jared\] Kushner to conclude this rapidly on their
terms, holding out the promise of major purchases," charges Thomas
Countryman, head of the Arms Control Association.]{.underline} In fact,
the Saudis, in contrast to the Emiratis, want to enrich uranium, which
offers a principal opportunity to divert nuclear materials for military
use. And Riyadh hasn't agreed to any weapons inspections. As a result,
[if the Saudis come to believe they "need" a bomb---and their criteria
might broaden over time---any peacetime program could automatically be
turned into one for military development.]{.underline} Admittedly,
America's refusal to deal might not stop Riyadh. Prince Turki al-Faisal
has pointed to China, France, Pakistan, and Russia as other options, a
point that's been echoed by administration officials. Even so,
Washington should not aid, even inadvertently, another nation,
especially such a repressive and aggressive power, in acquiring nuclear
weapons. The consequences would be grave, including to America's
nonproliferation credentials. Prince al-Faisal also pointedly included
"our friends in Pakistan" as a nuclear power option. But Islamabad could
provide more than peaceful energy. Riyadh might purchase weapons
directly from the cash-strapped and unstable Pakistan
government---especially since the Saudis financed the Pakistani nuclear
program. Doing so would cause an international furor, but for years,
A.Q. Khan, father of the Pakistani bomb, has essentially operated a
Nukes "R" Us open to the world. When confronted, Islamabad closed down
Khan's market, but with the right incentives it might be convinced to
accept another client. Six years ago, Israel's former head of military
intelligence, Amos Yadlin, claimed that Pakistan had already produced
and set aside weapons for Riyadh. Gary Samore, who advised President
Barack Obama on nonproliferation, observes, "I do think that the Saudis
believe that they have some understanding with Pakistan that, in
extremis, they would have claim to acquire nuclear weapons from
Pakistan." [The Trump administration's fixation on Iran has malformed
American policy towards the rest of the Mideast, including Saudi Arabia.
The United States should not take sides in the bitter Sunni-Shia rivalry
that lies beneath the Saudi-Iran conflict. It certainly shouldn't treat
Saudi Arabia as a permanent and trusted ally. The latter shares neither
values nor interests with the United States, and is aggressively
pursuing dangerous imperial ambitions. Washington should drop its
support for MbS's irresponsible policies and be on guard against the
Kingdom's possible acquisition of nuclear weapons. A Saudi bomb would
unsettle the region, guarantee a Middle Eastern nuclear arms race, and
encourage sectarian conflict. MbS can't be trusted with a bone saw, let
alone nukes.]{.underline}

One area in which U.S. President Donald Trump does not need to worry
about making America great again is international arms sales. The United
States accounts for 34 percent of all global arms sales (second place
Russia remains a distant 23 percent), and has more than 40 defense

by the Saudi-led war in Yemen estimated at between 16,000 and 50,000 by
the end of 2018, calls for the United States to suspend arms sales to

traction in both Congress and the public]{.underline}. More generally,
several authors have penned articles in these virtual pages calling for
more selective U.S. arms export decisions or outright embargos, governed
less by economic motivations and more by concern about blowback, human
rights, dispersion, and reducing technology transfer. I respectfully
disagree with all of these recommendations. [Whether it is delayed
approval, as in the recent Kuwaiti F-18 purchase, an outright
embargo]{.underline}, like Egyptian F-16s in 2013, [or denial of
technology transfer]{.underline}, as in the 2016 Turkish Patriot missile
request, [using the withholding of arms sales as a blunt force
instrument of coercion is unlikely to produce desired strategic benefits
and often backfires]{.underline}. [Arms exports are best used for
maintaining or strengthening relationships while limiting adversary
access to client states; a tool of nuanced influence, not outright
coercion]{.underline}. In fact, [threatening to withhold arms sales to
coerce a state into changing its behavior often has the opposite effect,
leading clients to diversify their arms sourcing instead of shifting
course]{.underline}. Similarly, [calls to restrict technology transfer
and worries about demands for direct offsets mistake what is known as
"design technology transfer" for the much more difficult "capacity"
level of transfer]{.underline}. Both are explained in more detail below,
but for now it is worth noting that design transfer, the level at which
most of these offsets occur, does not lead to the creation of an
independent defense industry, but instead provides the United States
with a source of political power. The United States should not fear
technology transfer, but with the appropriate end-user controls,
encourage it. [Additionally, while a large domestic market provides the
United States the luxury of sacrificing financial gains for political
influence, sometimes economics do matter; especially when it comes to
preserving complex production lines for future flexibility]{.underline}.
Finally, [the United States should not look to use an arms embargo to
coerce Saudi policy change, not for economic reasons, but simply because
it is unlikely to work]{.underline}. Greasing the Skids, Not Twisting
Arms [Arms sales are useful tools for maintaining]{.underline}
communication, strengthening [relationships]{.underline}, and keeping
potential adversary states at bay. [Conversely, as a blunt instrument of
coercion]{.underline} (i.e. if you do not do X, we will suspend Y),
[they are likely losers]{.underline}. Senior U.S. government officials
involved in the arms transfer process that I interviewed over the past
year during the course of my research have echoed similar sentiments.
This is also borne out by previous research providing evidence that
using arms transfers as situationally coercive tools is rarely
successful. [Interestingly, coercion attempts using arms transfers are
least likely to be successful when used as a punishment or threat
against an autocratic regime, such as Saudi Arabia]{.underline}.
Instead, [punishments in the form of an embargo can often push a client
to diversify sourcing rather than to change behavior]{.underline}.
Consider Indonesia and Egypt. [In 2015, Egypt agreed to purchase nearly
50 Russian]{.underline} MiG-29M/[M2s and more than two-dozen French
Rafales. This represented a shocking turn of events after more than
three decades of purchasing only American-made fighter
jets]{.underline}. [It was also driven largely by the U.S. embargo put
in place in 2013]{.underline}, after the Egyptian army's removal of
then-President Mohamed Morsi, who had won the presidency in a 2012
election. [The embargo caused significant tension between the two states
driven by "an Egyptian sense that they were at a point of mortal peril"
while the United States was moralizing about democratic
reforms]{.underline}. Remarkably, [the United States lifted the embargo
in 2015 with virtually no change in Egyptian policies, no official U.S.
"democracy certification", and Egyptian military support for the
Saudi-led war in Yemen]{.underline}. The U.S. arms embargo as a tool of
coercive change was an abject failure. [A similar story played out in
Indonesia more than a decade prior]{.underline}. A long-time arms client
of the United States with no history of Russian imports, Indonesia
announced a deal with Russia in 2003 to purchase Russian Su-27/30s.
While Indonesia was always far more politically neutral than Egypt, this
remarkable turnaround in arms sourcing diversification appears to be the
result of a U.S. arms embargo implemented in 1999 in response to
Indonesia's apparent human rights violations carrying out heavy-handed
military actions in East Timor. Furious at U.S. meddling in something
the government considered a domestic issue, Indonesia looked instead to
Russia with the specific intent to "overcome the effects of \[U.S.\]
arms sales restrictions." In other words, Indonesia looked to diversify,
not capitulate. [Indonesia continued sourcing Russian arms even after
the United States lifted the embargo in 2005. Perhaps most remarkably,
even after the United States agreed to give Indonesia 24 F-16s in 2012,
the archipelago state still agreed to purchase 11 Russian
Su-35s]{.underline}. [The U.S. attempt at coercion not only failed but
continues to perpetuate negative strategic effects today]{.underline}.
Who's Afraid of Technology Transfer? Another argument for a more
restrictive arms export policy concerns direct industrial offsets (those
economic agreements in which a supplier invests in the industry of a
client state directly related to the arms being transferred) and
technology transfer. However, these tools should not be feared.
Technology transfer is unlikely to breed meaningful competition for the
United States where it matters most, in the medium- to high-end markets,
and instead gives the United States a source of political influence. The
problem in many analyses is confusion over the type of technology
transfer. There are three ideal-typical categories of transfer: material
transfer, such as simple diffusion of weapons and machines; design
transfer, like blueprints and schematics; and capacity transfer, which
involves basic scientific knowledge and expertise within the industrial
base. Most technology transfers ultimately fall into the first two
categories, despite what a client state might hope for. Consider the
2003 Polish decision to purchase F-16s from Lockheed Martin with direct
offsets valued at more than \$6 billion. This represented 170 percent of
the program value and the then-largest in commercial history. Despite
this massive investment, Poland does not design and produce their own
fighter jets today, but rather subsections of American-designed systems
under license. In fact, direct offsets provided inroads for U.S.
industry in the Polish defense industry in a manner that strongly
incentivizes the Poles to continue purchasing U.S. aircraft, and indeed
Poland appears poised to purchase the F-35 in the near future. Offsets
and technology transfer may have helped revive portions of the Polish
defense industry and provided some domestic job creation, but it did not
create an independent competitor to the U.S. defense industry. This is
exactly as expected with material and design levels of transfer. While
some of the very largest industrial states, such as India or China,
might eventually create a world-leading defense industry, it will remain
out of the grasp of most states. Consider China, an unquestionable
economic powerhouse of recent decades. Despite decades of arms
purchases, technology transfer, blatant reverse engineering attempts,
and hundreds of billions of dollars, China still turns to Russia for
help with the most advanced weaponry such as fighter jets, helicopters,
surface-to-air missiles, radars, and jet engines. If China, the second
largest economy in the world struggles so mightily, what threat do
smaller, less capable states pose? Capacity transfer, the acquisition of
basic scientific knowledge and expertise crafted over decades, cannot
simply be uploaded, emailed to another state, or hacked. Rather, it
takes decades of intentional and costly investment. For high-end
weaponry, where research and development costs remain a prohibitive
barrier to entry, the United States and a handful of other advanced
economies are likely to remain in the driver's seat; even with generous
technology transfer agreements. Finally, consider some of the negative
second- and third-order effects that excessive restriction caused in
American unwillingness to commit to selling the U.S.-made Patriot
missile system and its underlying technology to Turkey. This was
recently posited as a U.S. export restriction success. However, this
restraint looks less successful each passing day. Even with significant
design transfer, it is unlikely Turkey could obtain the requisite
capacity transfer to be self-sufficient in surface-to-air and
anti-missile defense systems anytime soon. Conversely, by using U.S.
technology, the United States could have legally restricted Turkey's
future export of it. More importantly, Turkey has since agreed to
purchase Russia's advanced S-400 surface-to-air missile system, a blow
to U.S. and NATO relations with Turkey. The S-400 purchase will put
advanced Russian technology and military advisors inside a NATO ally and
tier-two F-35 industrial partner that is a sole-source supplier on
several F-35 components. As the Air Force Secretary said last year about
Turkey's S-400 agreement, "Sometimes it's the United States that's part
of the problem." Even worse, the United States has since approved the
sale of the Patriot to Turkey, with the acting U.S. Defense Secretary
recently commenting, "we need Turkey to buy the Patriot." Was holding
back on some surface-to-air missile technology worth the strategic cost?
It appears unlikely. Sometimes It's Not Dollars, But Sense As others
have pointed out, the United States can afford to "make economic \[...\]
sacrifices" in order to privilege politico-security benefits in arms
export decisions. As one author recently explained in War on the Rocks:
The United States is so economically advantaged in making and selling
weapons that it can limit conventional-weapons proliferation \[and\] ...
technology diffusion, (and maintain a robust defense industrial base)
while retaining its commanding market position. This is undoubtedly
true. However, on rare occasions economics do matter. Specifically,
maintaining strategic flexibility by keeping a production line open
which would otherwise shutter might sometimes need to be prioritized.
Consider the two recent examples of the F-22 and F-15. In December 2011,
the final F-22 fighter jet rolled off the assembly line, 554 short of
the original program requirement. At the same time, close U.S. allies
such as Japan and Australia made inquiries about purchasing further
increments of the fifth-generation fighter, which would have kept
production going for at least several more years. The United States
rejected the inquiries, shuttering the production line instead. A 2011
RAND Corporation study estimates the cost of restarting production and
fabricating 75 additional F-22s to be \$17 billion --- nearly \$227
million per jet. Despite this cost and because of an evolving
international security environment, the US Congress inserted language
into the 2017 defense budget directing the U.S. Air Force to conduct a
"production restart assessment," though the likelihood of a production
restart remains infinitesimally small. Fortunately, the outcome is
different for the F-15. In 2013, Qatar made a request for the purchase
of 70 F-15QAs, worth \$4 billion. At the time, without another export
order the 40-year old F-15 production line was slated to close by 2019,
eliminating any future purchases. After delaying approval for nearly
three years, the U.S. administration finally approved the deal in late
2016, guaranteeing F-15 production into the mid-2020s. Unlike the F-22,
the United States maintains strategic flexibility in F-15 (and F-18 and
F-16) production, largely because of exports. This appears to be an
especially prescient decision, as the FY2020 U.S. Air Force budget
proposal requests money to purchase at least eight (and up to 100)
F-15EX air superiority platforms; a platform one industry reporter
highlighted "is only possible because other countries have spent roughly
\$5B over the last couple of decades to continuously evolve the F-15
into what it is today \[...\] basically, the \[Air Force\] is getting
\[these upgrades\] for free." [What About Saudi Arabia? In sum, more
restrictive arms sales, delivery suspensions, or outright embargos are
unlikely to succeed in policy coercion]{.underline}. [While arms
transfers provide an avenue of influence, embargos often lead to
diversification, not desired policy changes]{.underline}. Additionally,
fears of technology transfer and direct offsets creating a competitor
out of every client are generally unfounded in the high-end market in
which the United States generally deals. Finally, [while the large
domestic market provides the United States the luxury of sacrificing
financial gains for political influence, sometimes economics do matter,
particularly when it comes to saving a production line for future
flexibility]{.underline}. [These conclusions should therefore inform
U.S. policy on Saudi Arabia. The intent here is not to argue the moral
or ethical responsibility of U.S. leaders in responding to Saudi
Arabia's execution of journalists or tactics in the war in
Yemen]{.underline}. It is natural to see the horror wrought in Yemen and
want to take any actions necessary to stop it. However, I ultimately
argue against a Saudi embargo. This is not because, as the president has
argued, it might cost a few billion dollars and some hundreds of defense
industry jobs. As others have pointed out, [the economic impact of Saudi
arms purchases on the U.S. defense industry is relatively small. Rather,
embargoing Saudi Arabia is unlikely to fundamentally alter Saudi
policies, but likely to further damage U.S. ties with
Riyadh]{.underline}. In the near-term, Saudi Arabia can substitute other
weapons, such as the Eurofighter and Tornado, and "dumb bombs" instead
of U.S.-built "smart weapons." The Saudis can also rely more heavily on
their Emirati and Egyptian partners using non-U.S. produced arms. [In
the medium to long term, such an embargo is likely to push the Kingdom
to greater arms diversification. If history is any guide, the United
States will eventually lift any potential arms embargo with little
change in Saudi behavior, but only after having provided an opportunity
for adversary states such as Russia and China to gain a strategic
foothold in Riyadh]{.underline}. Some might counter that it would be
extremely difficult and costly, in both time and money, for the Saudis
to significantly diversify their arms acquisitions away from the United
States. This is absolutely the case. However, costly does not mean
impossible. Less wealthy states have already done it. Egypt is one
example above; but others such as Venezuela and even tiny Kuwait ---
frustrated at years of U.S. approval delays --- have significantly
diversified their arms acquisitions. [In other words, with the money and
options available to Saudi Arabia, and few other producers showing a
stomach for a full embargo, it is not unreasonable to believe that the
Saudis might significantly diversify their arms acquisitions over time
in response to a U.S. embargo]{.underline}. [Thus, while a U.S. embargo
might be morally compelling and emotionally satisfying, it is unlikely
to create meaningful change for those most at risk or be strategically
beneficial to the United States]{.underline}. In the absence of a
compelling, evidence-based case that an arms embargo on Saudi Arabia
might produce desired changes in behavior, policymakers should look
elsewhere for solutions to their Saudi problems.

The United States has been making a lot of big arms sales to Saudi

Iranian-backed Houthi rebels) [and the murder of Jamal
Khashoggi.]{.underline} [Halting the arms sales would be a huge
mistake]{.underline}, and should the disapproval resolutions reach his
desk, President Trump should veto them. To be sure, the [Saudis, while
[making some moves in the right
direction](https://townhall.com/columnists/larryprovost/2018/10/24/khashoggi-writings-reveal-antisemitism-pro-shariaism-n2531301),
are not angels.]{.underline} [Khashoggi's murder was deliberate and
brutal. It should outrage people who value freedom of the press. But
cutting off arms sales and support for the Saudi efforts in Yemen would
be giving Iran]{.underline} a couple of [huge boosts]{.underline} just
[to say America owned the Saudis]{.underline} over Khashoggi in
particular and human rights in general. Yemen sits on the Bab el Mandeb,
a maritime choke point that is the southern entrance to the Red Sea. It
is, essentially, Israel's maritime back door. Aden, in the south, is
also a major port, used by the United Kingdom as a military base until
1967. [If the Houthis take control and drive out the government, it
means that the Iranian-sponsored rebels will have the ability to contest
passage through the Bab el Mandeb]{.underline}. They have already [fired
on an Arleigh Burke-class guided missile
destroyer](https://www.wearethemighty.com/articles/this-is-how-a-us-destroyer-just-dodged-2-missiles-off-the-yemen-coast)
on multiple occasions and [attacked a vessel that delivered humanitarian
aid](https://www.wearethemighty.com/articles/former-us-navy-vessel-attacked-by-yemeni-rebels-in-indian-ocean).
That doesn't even begin to touch Iran's record. Since 1979, [Iran has
taken Americans hostage, sponsored terrorist attacks, provided
insurgents in Iraq weapons that were used to kill American
servicemembers, and leaders of the regime have openly and repeatedly
expressed the desire to wipe Israel off the map.]{.underline} In the
last two weeks, [Iran has [mined two oil
tankers](https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/policy/defense-national-security/germanys-angela-merkel-strong-evidence-iran-to-blame-for-tanker-attacks)

them

Why does America not reach out to Turkey? Turkey has not exactly been a
reliable ally during the regime of Recep Tayyip Erdoğan. The decision to
[yank the F-35 from that
country](https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/opinion/taking-turkeys-f-35s-is-the-right-move-for-the-wrong-reason)
is the right one, even if the Erdoğan regime's purchase of the S-400
air-defense system is the wrong reason. If we can't trust Turkey with
the F-35, can we trust them with other weapon systems? The answer would
appear to be no. Again, noting that the [Saudis are not angels should
not blind us to the fact that they have helped America out in the
past.]{.underline} As Historians Peter Schweizer (in his 1994 book,

of oil production helped bring down the Soviet Union. Furthermore, when
America has turned its back on those who fought alongside us or who were
friendly, it hasn't worked out well. Did things get better or worse in
the Middle East when we abandoned the Shah of Iran over his bad human
rights record? Did things improve in Egypt when we turned our back on
Hosni Mubarak in favor of the Arab Spring? [What evidence is there that
dumping Mohammed bin Salman over human rights and Khashoggi will work
out any better for America -- or the world, for that
matter?]{.underline} [Nobody wants to see a war break out between the
United States and Iran. But cutting off weapons sales to Saudi Arabia is
**a good way to make war more likely**, not less]{.underline}. [If Saudi
Arabia is weakened, Iran will be more likely to continue to be

on that regime. [A stronger Saudi Arabia]{.underline}, on the other
hand, [leaves Iran less room to maneuver]{.underline}. In the Middle
East, America must often choose between a number of options that are
less than ideal. [Sticking with the Saudis is the least bad option the

#### U.S.-Relations are at an all-time high due to Trump's catering of MBS

This speaks to an even more fundamental problem for [the US-Saudi
alliance: It\'s only as durable as the shared interests between the
countries]{.underline}. US relationships with countries like the UK and
Japan are about much more than interests and common enemies --- they\'re
about shared values, histories, and visions for the world. The US can\'t
have that kind of alliance with an ultraconservative authoritarian
theocracy. [The Saudi alliance is fundamentally transactional: It\'s
only as strong as the benefits both countries get out of
it]{.underline}. America\'s role in the Saudi oil sector, the Soviet
Union, and Saddam Hussein are gone; jihadism is still around, but it\'s
not clear how long that will remain an issue that actually unites the
two powers. To take one example, the US\'s top priority in Syria is
defeating ISIS, while Saudi Arabia\'s is toppling Bashar al-Assad (an
Iranian client). This leads the two countries to see issues such as the
value of peace talks and arming the Syrian rebels very differently.
Indeed, [when the countries\' interests are in conflict, each tends to
go its own way. This is]{.underline} exactly [what happened with the
Nimr]{.underline} al-Nimr [execution: Saudi Arabia executed him in order
to stoke anti-Shia sentiment]{.underline}, a crude attempt to shore up
its support among domestic Sunnis and regional Sunni powers. [From the
Saudi point of view, these benefits outweighed the damage done
to]{.underline} its relationship with Shia Iran and [America\'s efforts
to coordinate a Syria peace deal]{.underline} and region-wide front
against ISIS. [The United States]{.underline}, needless to say, [sees
things differently, and is thus quite upset about Nimr\'s
execution]{.underline}. So the key question coming out of recent Saudi
behaviors is this: [Are the common interests]{.underline} that bind the
United States and Saudi Arabia together [more important than the
conflicting interests]{.underline} pushing them apart? [The answer will
determine just how strong this]{.underline} decades-old [alliance will
be]{.underline} in the coming years.

because it wields power to push up prices.]{.underline} An editorial in
Arab News by Turki Aldhakhil, the general manager of the official Saudi
news channel, Al Arabiya, offers a hint of what could be in the offing.
He said Riyadh was weighing up 30 measures designed to put pressure on
the US if it were to impose sanctions over the disappearance and
presumed murder of Jamal Khashoggi inside the country's Istanbul
consulate. These would include an [**oil production cut that could drive
prices from around \$80** (£60) a barrel **to more than \$400,** more
than double the [all-time high
of\$147.27](https://www.theguardian.com/business/2008/jul/12/oil.commodities)
reached in 2008]{.underline}. This would have [profound consequences
globally, not just because motorists would pay more at the petrol pump,
but because it would force up the cost of all goods that travel by
road.]{.underline} Saudi Arabia also supports thousands of US jobs via
its arms purchases. It is the [world's second-largest arms importer
after
India](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/mar/12/nearly-half-of-us-arms-exports-go-to-the-middle-east)
and 61% of those imports come from the US. It was the US's biggest arms
customer last year, signing \$17.5bn worth of deals, a trend that looks
set to continue after Donald Trump [signed a \$110bn defence agreement
in
Riyadh](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/may/12/us-saudi-arabia-arms-deal-donald-trump-visit)
last year. [The alliance stands to benefit US employers such as Lockheed
Martin, Boeing, General Electric and ExxonMobil. Some of the firms are
reported to have expressed concern to Trump already about the impact
that a freeze in Saudi-US relations might have.]{.underline} [Riyadh
could, for example, simply switch its purchases to other major arms
exporters such as Russia and China.]{.underline} Trump's trip to the
Arabian peninsula last year also yielded an agreement that the kingdom's
Public Investment Fund, which manages its vast oil wealth, would invest
in US infrastructure programmes. The PIF is to stump up \$20bn of a
\$40bn pot overseen by the global asset manager Blackstone. The fund,
however, has yet to gather any serious momentum. [Saudi Arabia has shown
in the past that it is not afraid to leverage its unique political and
economic position to get its own way. An investigation into allegations
of bribery [involving the British defence firm BAE Systems in the
country](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/mar/06/us-investigation-into-bae-saudi-arms-deal-watered-down-leaked-memo-suggests)
was dropped under Tony Blair's government in 2006. Blair said Riyadh had
threatened to stop cooperating on intelligence matters, putting Britain
at greater risk of a terrorist attack.]{.underline} Seth Frantzman, the
executive director of the US-based Middle East Center for Reporting and
Analysis, said the kingdom's importance to US strategy in the Gulf,
particularly as a bulwark against Iran, gave it great influence.
"They're part of an American-Saudi-UAE alliance, and the current US
administration is tough on Iran, so [in some ways the US is more
beholden to [Saudi
Arabia](https://www.theguardian.com/world/saudiarabia) than in previous
years]{.underline}," he said. "[They don't want to be humiliated in this
exchange]{.underline}. The US press says Trump will punish Saudi Arabia,
and [they **don't want to come out of this looking like the child being
punished**]{.underline}. "[Saudi probably feels it's on a winning streak
economically and if it has to take a hit, which it already is in terms
of its image, it will be made up for by the fact they'll find markets

According to the [2018 BP Statistical Review of World

concentrated among a dozen or so companies. In the U.S., thousands of
companies]{.underline} acting in their own self-interest produce oil.
But [in Saudi Arabia, all of the oil production is controlled by Saudi
Aramco]{.underline}, the state-owned oil company and [reportedly the
**[most profitable
company](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-04-13/the-aramco-accounts-inside-the-world-s-most-profitable-company)
in the world**.]{.underline} Given that Saudi Arabia\'s share of oil
production is well beyond the spare production capacity of the world\'s
most important commodity, [Saudi Arabia has incredible economic
power.]{.underline} [All Saudi Arabia would have to do is withhold three
or four million barrels of oil per day from the market, and prices would
quickly rise above \$100/barrel.]{.underline} Some analysts have floated
the idea of [oil prices getting as high as \$200 or even \$400/bbl in
the event of a disruption in Saudi\'s petroleum output. That may seem
preposterous, but keep in mind that during the 1973 oil embargo, oil
prices quadrupled in about six months.]{.underline} [**Prices like that
would quickly push the global economy into recession**, as it helped do
in 1973. That is the power Saudi Arabia holds]{.underline}. Consider the
oil price movements since 2014. Oil prices plunged because Saudi Arabia
sought to win market share back from the shale oil producers. So, OPEC
flooded the market with oil, which sent prices down by over 70%. Then,
when they decided that experiment wasn\'t working, Saudi Arabia
convinced OPEC and Russia to cut oil production to support prices. Oil
prices doubled. Just this week oil prices fell by 5% after Saudi Arabia
said it would cover any supply disruptions from the sanctions on Iran\'s
petroleum exports. No other entity in the world has as much power to
move the oil markets. [Saudi Arabia could quickly bring the global
economy to its knees. Thus, as the world debates a harsh punishment for
Saudi Arabia over the killing of journalist Jamal Khashoggi]{.underline}
earlier this month, they really hold the trump card. [**\$100 billion in
potential arms sales is small potatoes** considering the **havoc Saudi
Arabia could unleash** if it decided to use oil as an economic
weapon]{.underline}. This is just one price we pay for our dependence on
oil. [Global economic security will continue to **depend strongly on the
cooperation of Saudi Arabia.**]{.underline}

Moreover, if Israel is our closest ally in the region (and it is), then
**[Saudi Arabia is our second closest ally]{.underline}.** And speaking
of Israel, Saudi Arabia does not like the Jewish state or recognize the
Jewish state. But **[Saudi Arabia accepts the Jewish state and keeps the
ambitions of Israel\'s enemies in check. Saudi Arabia also keeps the
production of oil in check, which in turn minimizes the cost of
petroleum]{.underline}.** But that does not mean the U.S. can afford to
relinquish its alliance with Saudi Arabia. What the U.S. might attempt
is to use the tragedy as an opportunity to force Saudi Arabia into
further reforms[. **Indeed, as the Saudis need us more than we need

### Alliance High -- Arms Sales

#### Security commitment to Saudi Arabia is high now

Somewhere along the line, [we seem to have forgotten that our strategy
in the Middle East is dependent on Saudi Arabia as our most important
single security partner. Israel]{.underline}'s security is certainly a
key American concern, but it [does not play an active role in most of
America's ongoing military engagements in the region, in dealing with
Iran, or in a direct fight against violent extremist movements like ISIS
and Al Qaeda.]{.underline} Saudi Arabia's role as a strategic partner
has also been enhanced by the fact that Egypt and Algeria are focused on
their own internal stability and their roles in the region have sharply
diminished, and Iraq and Syria both must deal with major instability
problems and are at war. Our European allies have declining power
projection capabilities, and Turkey's role in the region is increasingly
problematic. It is certainly true that Saudi Arabia needs the United
States as much or more than the United States needs Saudi Arabia. Saudi
military forces are steadily improving, but it is the [U.S. presence in
the region that create a balance of forces that firmly deters Iran and
has helped Saudi Arabia defeat its own terrorist threats from groups
like A]{.underline}l [Q]{.underline}aeda in the [A]{.underline}rabian
[P]{.underline}eninsula. [U.S. arms shipments, advisory efforts and
exercises]{.underline} also [play a critical role in improving Saudi
forces.]{.underline} But the United States needs Saudi Arabia as well.
[Saudi Arabia is]{.underline} now [the most critical single security
partner in ensuring the stable flow of petroleum out of the Gulf
region.]{.underline} While the United States is largely eliminating its
need for direct petroleum imports, it is steadily increasing its
dependence on the health and growth of the global economy and imports
from Asian states like China, Japan, South Korea and Taiwan, which are
critically dependent on Gulf petroleum exports. The end result is [that
U.S. strategic interests in the region continue to increase]{.underline}
in spite of the steady cut in U.S. direct oil imports. This is why
focusing on more [U.S. arms sales to Saudi Arabia]{.underline} and Saudi
investment in the United States, [ignoring the]{.underline}
[growing]{.underline} [role]{.underline} [Saudi Arabia has
play]{.underline}ed [in fight terrorism]{.underline} since
2003[,]{.underline} [down playing the need to cooperate in checking
Iran, and treating the war in Yemen as is if Saudi Arabia does not face
real threats is not the way the United States should deal
with]{.underline} Crown Prince [M]{.underline}ohammed [B]{.underline}in
[S]{.underline}alman's visit to the White House. Saudi Arabia's reform
and economic development plans are critical to its stability and the
region's security. The kingdom needs U.S. encouragement and an
understanding that Saudi Arabia cannot implement these plans effectively
without outside support.

#### Alliance high now -- arms sales and White House vetoes

President [Trump]{.underline} on Wednesday [vetoed three resolutions
that Congress passed to stop]{.underline} several [arms sales benefiting
Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates, which the president pushed
through without congressional approval.]{.underline} Earlier this month,
bipartisan majorities --- but not a veto-proof majority --- in the House
and Senate voted to block the arms deals, worth more than \$8 billion.
The sales would replenish part of the Saudi arsenal that lawmakers say
has been used against civilians in Yemen's civil war. Many lawmakers
also object to the idea of rewarding Saudi leaders after the killing of
the journalist Jamal Khashoggi. [The president announced in
May]{.underline} that [he would use emergency authority to push through
the weapons sales]{.underline} that include missiles, munitions and
surveillance aircraft. "The misguided licensing prohibitions in the
joint resolution directly conflict with the foreign policy and national
security objectives of the United States," Trump said in all three White
House statements declaring his vetoes. The [Trump]{.underline}
administration has [insisted]{.underline} the [arms sales are crucial to
protect]{.underline} [the region]{.underline} [against]{.underline} a
growing threat from [Iran]{.underline}. The vetoes come as the Senate
Foreign Relations Committee plans to vote Thursday on two competing
bipartisan bills to impose sanctions on Saudi Arabia. [The president has
resisted congressional efforts to punish Saudi Arabia for human rights
abuses]{.underline} and Khashoggi's murder, which U.S. intelligence
officials say was ordered by Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman. Lawmakers
and international human rights organizations have accused [Saudi
Arabia's bombing campaign in Yemen]{.underline} ---
[enabled]{.underline} in part [by]{.underline} the type of munitions
[Trump]{.underline} maneuvered to sell to Saudi leaders --- of
contributing to a crisis that has put 20 million Yemenis at risk of
starvation and exposed hundreds of thousands to cholera. "The United
States is very concerned about the conflict's toll on innocent civilians
and is working to bring the conflict in Yemen to an end," Trump said in
the veto statement. "But we cannot end it through ill-conceived and
time-consuming resolutions that fail to address its root causes."
Congress is unlikely to have the votes to override the veto and does not
have a consensus on how to proceed.

### Alliance Brink -- Arms Sales

#### Alliance is fragile -- ending sales pushes it over the edge

An effort is under way in Washington to fundamentally overhaul, if not
end, a decades-old American alliance---but it didn't come at the
direction of the alliance-skeptical Donald Trump. The president, in
fact, has paradoxically emerged as the greatest force of resistance to
the change. Fed up with the catastrophic human cost of Saudi Arabia's
military intervention in Yemen's civil war and appalled by the murder of
the Washington Post columnist Jamal Khashoggi, [Congress seemingly
attempts some sort of measure to censure the kingdom every week. Yet at
every turn, the White House has blocked or circumvented those moves,
standing staunchly by]{.underline} Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin
Salman, or [MbS]{.underline}, while escalating its confrontation with
his archenemy, Iran. The real reckoning in the U.S.-Saudi partnership
could come if a Democrat is elected president in 2020, though early
warning signs are already visible. Virtually all Democratic lawmakers,
along with several Republican members of Congress and various lobbyists,
analysts, and former officials, are shunning the Saudis to the point
where a visit to Washington, D.C., by MbS, the heir apparent who was
welcomed in 2017 and 2018, seems inconceivable anytime soon. When
Franklin D. Roosevelt and King Abdulaziz met aboard the USS Quincy in
1945, neither could have foreseen the cracks that would form in a
relationship built on mutual benefit: a steady supply of Saudi oil in
exchange for U.S. military protection. But even the fallout from the
September 11 attacks---in which 15 of the 19 hijackers were Saudi---did
not present the kind of existential challenge evident today. [U.S.
lawmakers are engaged in numerous efforts to restrict arms sales to the
kingdom and hold MbS, along with other top officials,
accountable]{.underline} for Khashoggi's death. For now, [the Saudis are
banking on the Trump administration's allegiance.]{.underline} Yet they
acknowledge, or at the very least pay lip service to, their precarious
position. "We in \[[Saudi Arabia]{.underline}\] recognize that the
relationship has come under strain recently, but we are [working hard on
restoring it]{.underline} to what it once was. We realize it's going to
take some time, but we see it as a marathon not a sprint," a senior
Saudi official wrote to us recently on the condition of anonymity to
discuss the issue. [That's far from]{.underline} the mea culpa [U.S.
lawmakers are demanding]{.underline}. In May, the administration invoked
emergency powers to bypass Congress and sell billions of dollars' worth
of weapons to Saudi Arabia, a show of support that nevertheless
reflected the administration's awareness that it would not have been
able to get lawmakers to approve the arms sales. [The
Senate]{.underline} responded by [pass]{.underline}ing [several measures
to try to prevent]{.underline} the [sales]{.underline}---moves
remarkable not just for their bipartisan backing, but also for the fact
that they came amid heightened tensions with Iran, which Trump cited as
grounds for the emergency transactions. In April, Trump vetoed a
resolution to end U.S. support for the Saudi-led military intervention
against the Iran-aligned Houthi rebels in Yemen. He had to take that
step because seven Republicans in the Senate and 16 in the House of
Representatives had joined nearly every Democrat in both chambers to
support the legislation. [Trump]{.underline}, whose first trip abroad as
president was to Saudi Arabia, has [championed the alliance]{.underline}
in part because his administration and the Saudi government are both
[alarmed by Iran's suspected nuclear-weapons]{.underline} pursuits and
support for militant groups in the Middle East. Secretary of State Mike
Pompeo focused only on the threats posed by Iran during meetings with
the Saudi king and crown prince in Riyadh last week. And while Trump
said he raised Khashoggi's killing with MbS at the G20 summit in Japan,
he would not be drawn on the CIA's intelligence that reportedly
concluded with high confidence that the crown prince ordered the
journalist's murder. But [Trump's motivations for dismissing concerns
about the war in Yemen]{.underline} and Khashoggi's assassination range
from the close personal relationship between MbS and Trump's son-in-law,
Jared Kushner, to Riyadh's [plentiful purchases of U.S.-made weapons,
which the president argues create American jobs.]{.underline} "You have
people wanting to cut off Saudi Arabia. They bought \$450 billion" worth
of military equipment, Trump declared at a recent campaign rally,
greatly inflating the actual figures. "I don't want to lose them!"
Trump's approach is to "align with this growing Saudi, Emirati, Israeli,
anti-Iran conception of the region, and \[Sanders\] is very much of a
different view." Most americans, of course, have had negative views of
Saudi Arabia since the 9/11 attacks; two-thirds of the public currently
view the kingdom unfavorably, Gallup's highest reading in its three
decades of polling on the question. The big development now is that
there's also serious ferment in the nation's capital, where Saudi Arabia
by one estimate poured more than \$40 million into lobbying Congress,
the executive branch, think tanks, and media outlets in 2017 and 2018
alone---tripling its spending on influence operations from the last year
of Barack Obama's administration to the first year of the Trump
administration. All the Saudis have to show for that money, though, is a
rock-solid friend in the White House and an open revolt on Capitol Hill.
"The [Saudis used to have really strong bipartisan support in
Washington]{.underline}," Senator Chris Murphy of Connecticut, a
Democrat and longtime critic of Riyadh, told us[. Now "they are clinging
to this alliance simply through the force of the regime's relationship
with]{.underline} one person: Donald [Trump]{.underline}." "Maybe we
have a hard time forcing a reset while Trump is in office," added
Murphy, who has sponsored numerous bills to rein in the security
relationship with the Saudis. "But [a reset's coming]{.underline}."

#### US-Saudi alliance is fragile now -- transactional benefits keep it together

This speaks to an even more fundamental problem for [the US-Saudi
alliance: It\'s only as durable as the shared interests between the
countries]{.underline}. US relationships with countries like the UK and
Japan are about much more than interests and common enemies --- they\'re
about shared values, histories, and visions for the world. The US can\'t
have that kind of alliance with an ultraconservative authoritarian
theocracy. [The Saudi alliance is fundamentally transactional: It\'s
only as strong as the benefits both countries get out of
it]{.underline}. America\'s role in the Saudi oil sector, the Soviet
Union, and Saddam Hussein are gone; jihadism is still around, but it\'s
not clear how long that will remain an issue that actually unites the
two powers. To take one example, the US\'s top priority in Syria is
defeating ISIS, while Saudi Arabia\'s is toppling Bashar al-Assad (an
Iranian client). This leads the two countries to see issues such as the
value of peace talks and arming the Syrian rebels very differently.
Indeed, [when the countries\' interests are in conflict, each tends to
go its own way. This is]{.underline} exactly [what happened with the
Nimr]{.underline} al-Nimr [execution: Saudi Arabia executed him in order
to stoke anti-Shia sentiment]{.underline}, a crude attempt to shore up
its support among domestic Sunnis and regional Sunni powers. [From the
Saudi point of view, these benefits outweighed the damage done
to]{.underline} its relationship with Shia Iran and [America\'s efforts
to coordinate a Syria peace deal]{.underline} and region-wide front
against ISIS. [The United States]{.underline}, needless to say, [sees
things differently, and is thus quite upset about Nimr\'s
execution]{.underline}. So the key question coming out of recent Saudi
behaviors is this: [Are the common interests]{.underline} that bind the
United States and Saudi Arabia together [more important than the
conflicting interests]{.underline} pushing them apart? [The answer will
determine just how strong this]{.underline} decades-old [alliance will
be]{.underline} in the coming years.

Unexpected Transfers: [Upgrade and Downgrade Signals Transfers can be
unexpected in either a positive or negative way, which correspond,
respectively, with upgrade and downgrade signals]{.underline}. [An
absence of transfers between states that have substantial common
interests is unexpected]{.underline}. To rely on the familiar example of
the NATO allies, [it would be very surprising if a NATO ally was denied
the transfer of a weapon other allies possessed, or if a NATO ally
decided to seek weapons from outside the alliance]{.underline}. [The
lack of transfer sends a downgrade signal: it is a visible interruption
to the shared ties between the states]{.underline}.96

Footnote beings

96 Some might argue that [the lack of a transfer in this condition is
epiphenomenal to a larger strategic interest shift]{.underline} (e.g.,
the US pivot to Asia might lead to fewer transfers to Europe). While it
is plausible that the lack of a transfer might signal a downgrading of
the states' relationship, this should be a very rare case. [States, even
if undertaking a strategic shift, will still want their friends and
allies to have advanced weaponry. Being seen to draw away from or
downgrade the relationship with states with whom you share significant
strategic interests could undermine the sender's reputation as a
reliable ally]{.underline}.

Footnotes ends

Downgrade signals can also come if the transfer is a mismatch with the
receiver's expectations. This can be caused by receiving a lower
quantity or lower type of weapon, such as expecting fighter jets but
receiving cargo planes. [Mismatched transfers indicate a growing rift
between the sender and receiver]{.underline}. Jordan, for example,
expected to receive the F-104 Starfighter jet, a bling weapon, from the
United States in 1967. It was instead sent a small number of backbone
and blip weapons, including rifles and utility trucks, leading King
Hussein to reconsider what he thought was a close US-Jordanian
relationship. [Importantly, a downgrade signal can be initiated by the
sender or the receiver of a weapon. The sender can choose to prevent the
receiver from acquiring a weapon, or the receiver can rebuff offers. The
downgrade signal is sent regardless]{.underline}. For example, in March
2015, Sweden decided not to negotiate a new defense agreement with Saudi
Arabia, a move that signaled new tensions and disputes between the two
states.97

[Weapons transfers are intimately linked to foreign policy and grand
strategy because they reveal information about the political
relationship between the sender and receiver. To actors in the
international system, weapons are credible signals of alignment and
intentions, even when the weapon does not affect the relative balance of
power]{.underline}. State leaders and policymakers have long observed
that weapons transfers have effects beyond the military balance.
Scholarly assessments of the consequences of arms transfers have not
incorporated this insight, and thus reaches contradictory conclusions:
arms might increase the likelihood of conflict, or decrease it; arms
might build alliance trust, or they might undermine it; or, they might
have no independent effect on state behavior whatsoever.54 [I argue that
weapons affect a state's military power and send signals about the
relationship between the sending and receiving state. The signals sent
by weapons transfers help states differentiate between close friends,
acquaintances, and opponents in a manner that is clear and
comprehensible in an otherwise noisy international system]{.underline}.
These political signals have observable effects on a state's foreign
policy behavior. [Weapons are intimately linked to grand strategy and
foreign policy because they create two types of power]{.underline}.55
Weapons most clearly provide material power, enabling a state to more
credibly make coercive threats or undertake forceful diplomatic actions
because of increased capabilities. [Weapons transfers are also signals
of political ties, which creates a more diffuse, relational power.
Weapons transfers signal the extent and depth of states' political
alignments, and can even sort states in intra-group status
hierarchies]{.underline}. [Weapons transfers are bright lines against
the noisy (and sticky) background that is state's broader political
networks]{.underline}. They affect the shape of and tensions in the
network. [State leaders use the ties created by weapons transfers as a
convenient shortcut for understanding how states are related to one
another, where the center of power is located, and the relative power of
one group of states compared to another]{.underline}. In focusing on the
signals sent by weapons transfers, I show, for example, that [some
transfers facilitate cooperation, while other transfers incentivize
prevention or aggression]{.underline}. These foreign policy outcomes,
determined by the signal sent by weapons transfers, more generally show
the importance of the symbols and signals that make and unmake relations
that constitute world politics. As the following empirical chapters
show, without an analysis of the political effects of weapons transfers,
explanations of international political outcomes are incomplete. Chapter
three, on India and Pakistan, shows how weapons transfers can moderate a
revisionist state's impulses to take advantage of its weakened neighbor.
The chapter on the Middle East offers a revised explanation for the 1967
war, focusing on the arms transfers that fueled uncertainty about
political relationships. Chapter five demonstrates how weapons transfers
expand foreign policy options available to states by allowing them to
hold on to otherwise contradictory relationships. [The US used transfers
to simultaneously reassure Taiwan and deter China -- the foundation of
the policy of strategic ambiguity. Finally, chapter six shows that
states remain sensitive to and interested in arms signals even when the
state can produce its own weapons. These cases are specific instances of
more general patterns in which weapons transfers have a causal effect on
state behavior]{.underline}. It is these political effects, and how they
explain foreign policy decisions, that are the focus of the remainder of
this chapter. [This chapter develops an explanation of foreign policy
behavior based on signals sent through international conventional
weapons transfers]{.underline}. First, I situate my discussion of arms
as signals within existing scholarship. Second, I go beyond existing
literature by explicitly and systematically building a theory of the
political effects of weapons transfers. Third, I discuss scope
conditions for this theory. Fourth, I show the broader theoretical
significance of this theory with respect to foreign policy, signaling,
and hierarchies in international security. I conclude with a discussion
of case selection and concept analysis. POLITICAL RELATIONSHIPS AND ARMS
TRANSFERS What do weapons do for a state? While existing literature
acknowledges that states can seek weapons for purposes beyond relative
capabilities, there is not yet a coherent description of the political
effects of arms transfers. Scholarship generally treats "conventional
weapons" as a monolithic category, overlooking differences between
planes, tanks, and ICBMs. Any first step toward creating a typology of
weapons must therefore take into account the different functions and
perceptions of weapons. Weapons quite obviously affect relative
capabilities. Greater capabilities give a state increased ability to
coerce its adversaries or to conduct military operations. However, the
effects of capabilities are not universal. A tank enables a very
different type of fighting than long-range bombers; a refueling plane is
quite different from a submarine. A logical first cut for
differentiating among types of weapons is based on their military
utility. Second, scholars have a sense that weapons can be acquired for
reasons other than relative capabilities, but have not explored these
purposes. With the exception of ambiguous statements that some weapons
are more "symbolic" than others, non-military reasons for weapons
acquisition are, in the conventional realm, largely ignored. Linguistic
politics approaches suggest the salient point of information is the name
of the weapon,56 whereas others have argued the weapon itself is a
symbol, and that supersonic aircraft are particularly notable because
they are "expensive, visible, and get a great deal of attention in the
policy-making process."57 Other weapons thought to receive significant
attention are submarines and main battle tanks.58 It's not clear,
though, why submarines, supersonic aircraft, and tanks are conceptually
distinct from other types of weapons. [There is, however, a sense that
weapons can be used as political signals. Arms can be part of a
reciprocal agreement for some other good, or they can be a means of
gaining influence in the receiving state]{.underline}.59 As I show
later, [weapons are long-term investments and providing (or denying) new
technologies to a state is a central process in the development of
status hierarchies]{.underline}. Unlike iPads, new fighter jet models
are not released every year. [The transfer of high-tech weapons thus
creates durable status hierarchies between and within groups of states.
Additionally, arms can send signals ranging from "gestures of political
support," to friendship and trust, to signals of technological
modernity]{.underline}.60 In sum, arms can do things, but there is no
consensus about which arms or what things. [There is also a startling
lack of attention to the decision not to sell arms, even though
withholding arms can be an act of great political import]{.underline}.
Freedman is a rare exception, accurately observing that, "[though only
limited political benefits can normally be expected from agreeing to
sell arms, since this is seen in commercial terms, refusing to sell arms
is a major political act. It appears as a calculated insult, reflecting
on the stability, trust, and credit-worthiness, or technical competence
of the would-be recipient]{.underline}."61 However, [other researchers
have not pursued this line of thinking, perhaps because the usual
databases focus on the arms transfers that come to fruition. Since
withholding arms means a transfer does not appear in these databases,
the act is usually ignored]{.underline}.62

Filling a foreign country\'s military capability gaps normally implies

services. [On any given day, thousands of American advisors, trainers,
planners, and technical experts]{.underline}---flown in on a

these gaps: training border guards to enhance border security;
transferring military equipment; providing technical assistance on the
latest combat aircraft; and organizing and leading multinational
exercises on the high-seas to make foreign armies, navies, and air
forces stronger, and preferably more interoperable with America's armed
forces]{.underline}. In general, [the U.S. military aims to train others
to enable them to fight in furtherance of both their own and America\'s
interests]{.underline}. There is no pure altruism in international
relations. Security cooperation is a critical instrument of American
statecraft. Thus [the U.S. provides allies with military training and
equipment in]{.underline} western and northern Europe to deter Russia,
in Asia to balance China, in Latin America to fight organized crime, in
the Persian Gulf to counter Iranian influence, and [the Middle East to
degrade terrorist networks.]{.underline} Because it is an ally-rich
country, and those allies often have interests in line with those of the
U.S., [America can count on other nations---with a bit of help from
Washington---to carry out the aforementioned tasks. Reveron argues
America's approach to security cooperation has been largely
effective]{.underline}. He points out that over the past few decades the
[U.S. military has brought twelve countries in Europe up to NATO
standards]{.underline}, thereby bolstering U.S. prospects for containing
Russian expansionism. In the Balkans, he believes security cooperation
has built military forces in Kosovo and Bosnia that, along with the
presence of international peacekeeping troops, have prevented the powder
keg of Europe from erupting. He also points out that from South America
to Southeast Asia American military aid has helped Colombia, the
Philippines, and other states effectively confront insurgencies,
terrorism, and transnational organized crime.

### Arms Sales -- Reverse Causal

#### Ending arms sales decks the alliance, causes lash-out and international fill in 

**Rounds 2019** (Ray Rounds, Ph.D. candidate at Georgetown University in
International Relations, \"THE CASE AGAINST ARMS EMBARGOS, EVEN FOR
SAUDI ARABIA\", War on the Rocks, April 16 2019,
<https://warontherocks.com/2019/04/the-case-against-arms-embargos-even-for-saudi-arabia/>,
mmv)

One area in which U.S. President Donald Trump does not need to worry
about making America great again is international arms sales. The United
States accounts for 34 percent of all global arms sales (second place
Russia remains a distant 23 percent), and has more than 40 defense
companies in the top 100 globally. [However, with civilian deaths caused
by the Saudi-led war in Yemen estimated at between 16,000 and 50,000 by
the end of 2018, calls for the United States to suspend arms sales to
its largest client --- Saudi Arabia --- have understandably gained
traction in both Congress and the public]{.underline}. More generally,
several authors have penned articles in these virtual pages calling for
more selective U.S. arms export decisions or outright embargos, governed
less by economic motivations and more by concern about blowback, human
rights, dispersion, and reducing technology transfer. I respectfully
disagree with all of these recommendations. [Whether it is delayed
approval, as in the recent Kuwaiti F-18 purchase, an outright
embargo]{.underline}, like Egyptian F-16s in 2013, [or denial of
technology transfer]{.underline}, as in the 2016 Turkish Patriot missile
request, [using the withholding of arms sales as a blunt force
instrument of coercion is unlikely to produce desired strategic benefits
and often backfires]{.underline}. [Arms exports are best used for
maintaining or strengthening relationships while limiting adversary
access to client states; a tool of nuanced influence, not outright
coercion]{.underline}. In fact, [threatening to withhold arms sales to
coerce a state into changing its behavior often has the opposite effect,
leading clients to diversify their arms sourcing instead of shifting
course]{.underline}. Similarly, [calls to restrict technology transfer
and worries about demands for direct offsets mistake what is known as
"design technology transfer" for the much more difficult "capacity"
level of transfer]{.underline}. Both are explained in more detail below,
but for now it is worth noting that design transfer, the level at which
most of these offsets occur, does not lead to the creation of an
independent defense industry, but instead provides the United States
with a source of political power. The United States should not fear
technology transfer, but with the appropriate end-user controls,
encourage it. [Additionally, while a large domestic market provides the
United States the luxury of sacrificing financial gains for political
influence, sometimes economics do matter; especially when it comes to
preserving complex production lines for future flexibility]{.underline}.
Finally, [the United States should not look to use an arms embargo to
coerce Saudi policy change, not for economic reasons, but simply because
it is unlikely to work]{.underline}. Greasing the Skids, Not Twisting
Arms [Arms sales are useful tools for maintaining]{.underline}
communication, strengthening [relationships]{.underline}, and keeping
potential adversary states at bay. [Conversely, as a blunt instrument of
coercion]{.underline} (i.e. if you do not do X, we will suspend Y),
[they are likely losers]{.underline}. Senior U.S. government officials
involved in the arms transfer process that I interviewed over the past
year during the course of my research have echoed similar sentiments.
This is also borne out by previous research providing evidence that
using arms transfers as situationally coercive tools is rarely
successful. [Interestingly, coercion attempts using arms transfers are
least likely to be successful when used as a punishment or threat
against an autocratic regime, such as Saudi Arabia]{.underline}.
Instead, [punishments in the form of an embargo can often push a client
to diversify sourcing rather than to change behavior]{.underline}.
Consider Indonesia and Egypt. [In 2015, Egypt agreed to purchase nearly
50 Russian]{.underline} MiG-29M/[M2s and more than two-dozen French
Rafales. This represented a shocking turn of events after more than
three decades of purchasing only American-made fighter
jets]{.underline}. [It was also driven largely by the U.S. embargo put
in place in 2013]{.underline}, after the Egyptian army's removal of
then-President Mohamed Morsi, who had won the presidency in a 2012
election. [The embargo caused significant tension between the two states
driven by "an Egyptian sense that they were at a point of mortal peril"
while the United States was moralizing about democratic
reforms]{.underline}. Remarkably, [the United States lifted the embargo
in 2015 with virtually no change in Egyptian policies, no official U.S.
"democracy certification", and Egyptian military support for the
Saudi-led war in Yemen]{.underline}. The U.S. arms embargo as a tool of
coercive change was an abject failure. [A similar story played out in
Indonesia more than a decade prior]{.underline}. A long-time arms client
of the United States with no history of Russian imports, Indonesia
announced a deal with Russia in 2003 to purchase Russian Su-27/30s.
While Indonesia was always far more politically neutral than Egypt, this
remarkable turnaround in arms sourcing diversification appears to be the
result of a U.S. arms embargo implemented in 1999 in response to
Indonesia's apparent human rights violations carrying out heavy-handed
military actions in East Timor. Furious at U.S. meddling in something
the government considered a domestic issue, Indonesia looked instead to
Russia with the specific intent to "overcome the effects of \[U.S.\]
arms sales restrictions." In other words, Indonesia looked to diversify,
not capitulate. [Indonesia continued sourcing Russian arms even after
the United States lifted the embargo in 2005. Perhaps most remarkably,
even after the United States agreed to give Indonesia 24 F-16s in 2012,
the archipelago state still agreed to purchase 11 Russian
Su-35s]{.underline}. [The U.S. attempt at coercion not only failed but
continues to perpetuate negative strategic effects today]{.underline}.
Who's Afraid of Technology Transfer? Another argument for a more
restrictive arms export policy concerns direct industrial offsets (those
economic agreements in which a supplier invests in the industry of a
client state directly related to the arms being transferred) and
technology transfer. However, these tools should not be feared.
Technology transfer is unlikely to breed meaningful competition for the
United States where it matters most, in the medium- to high-end markets,
and instead gives the United States a source of political influence. The
problem in many analyses is confusion over the type of technology
transfer. There are three ideal-typical categories of transfer: material
transfer, such as simple diffusion of weapons and machines; design
transfer, like blueprints and schematics; and capacity transfer, which
involves basic scientific knowledge and expertise within the industrial
base. Most technology transfers ultimately fall into the first two
categories, despite what a client state might hope for. Consider the
2003 Polish decision to purchase F-16s from Lockheed Martin with direct
offsets valued at more than \$6 billion. This represented 170 percent of
the program value and the then-largest in commercial history. Despite
this massive investment, Poland does not design and produce their own
fighter jets today, but rather subsections of American-designed systems
under license. In fact, direct offsets provided inroads for U.S.
industry in the Polish defense industry in a manner that strongly
incentivizes the Poles to continue purchasing U.S. aircraft, and indeed
Poland appears poised to purchase the F-35 in the near future. Offsets
and technology transfer may have helped revive portions of the Polish
defense industry and provided some domestic job creation, but it did not
create an independent competitor to the U.S. defense industry. This is
exactly as expected with material and design levels of transfer. While
some of the very largest industrial states, such as India or China,
might eventually create a world-leading defense industry, it will remain
out of the grasp of most states. Consider China, an unquestionable
economic powerhouse of recent decades. Despite decades of arms
purchases, technology transfer, blatant reverse engineering attempts,
and hundreds of billions of dollars, China still turns to Russia for
help with the most advanced weaponry such as fighter jets, helicopters,
surface-to-air missiles, radars, and jet engines. If China, the second
largest economy in the world struggles so mightily, what threat do
smaller, less capable states pose? Capacity transfer, the acquisition of
basic scientific knowledge and expertise crafted over decades, cannot
simply be uploaded, emailed to another state, or hacked. Rather, it
takes decades of intentional and costly investment. For high-end
weaponry, where research and development costs remain a prohibitive
barrier to entry, the United States and a handful of other advanced
economies are likely to remain in the driver's seat; even with generous
technology transfer agreements. Finally, consider some of the negative
second- and third-order effects that excessive restriction caused in
American unwillingness to commit to selling the U.S.-made Patriot
missile system and its underlying technology to Turkey. This was
recently posited as a U.S. export restriction success. However, this
restraint looks less successful each passing day. Even with significant
design transfer, it is unlikely Turkey could obtain the requisite
capacity transfer to be self-sufficient in surface-to-air and
anti-missile defense systems anytime soon. Conversely, by using U.S.
technology, the United States could have legally restricted Turkey's
future export of it. More importantly, Turkey has since agreed to
purchase Russia's advanced S-400 surface-to-air missile system, a blow
to U.S. and NATO relations with Turkey. The S-400 purchase will put
advanced Russian technology and military advisors inside a NATO ally and
tier-two F-35 industrial partner that is a sole-source supplier on
several F-35 components. As the Air Force Secretary said last year about
Turkey's S-400 agreement, "Sometimes it's the United States that's part
of the problem." Even worse, the United States has since approved the
sale of the Patriot to Turkey, with the acting U.S. Defense Secretary
recently commenting, "we need Turkey to buy the Patriot." Was holding
back on some surface-to-air missile technology worth the strategic cost?
It appears unlikely. Sometimes It's Not Dollars, But Sense As others
have pointed out, the United States can afford to "make economic \[...\]
sacrifices" in order to privilege politico-security benefits in arms
export decisions. As one author recently explained in War on the Rocks:
The United States is so economically advantaged in making and selling
weapons that it can limit conventional-weapons proliferation \[and\] ...
technology diffusion, (and maintain a robust defense industrial base)
while retaining its commanding market position. This is undoubtedly
true. However, on rare occasions economics do matter. Specifically,
maintaining strategic flexibility by keeping a production line open
which would otherwise shutter might sometimes need to be prioritized.
Consider the two recent examples of the F-22 and F-15. In December 2011,
the final F-22 fighter jet rolled off the assembly line, 554 short of
the original program requirement. At the same time, close U.S. allies
such as Japan and Australia made inquiries about purchasing further
increments of the fifth-generation fighter, which would have kept
production going for at least several more years. The United States
rejected the inquiries, shuttering the production line instead. A 2011
RAND Corporation study estimates the cost of restarting production and
fabricating 75 additional F-22s to be \$17 billion --- nearly \$227
million per jet. Despite this cost and because of an evolving
international security environment, the US Congress inserted language
into the 2017 defense budget directing the U.S. Air Force to conduct a
"production restart assessment," though the likelihood of a production
restart remains infinitesimally small. Fortunately, the outcome is
different for the F-15. In 2013, Qatar made a request for the purchase
of 70 F-15QAs, worth \$4 billion. At the time, without another export
order the 40-year old F-15 production line was slated to close by 2019,
eliminating any future purchases. After delaying approval for nearly
three years, the U.S. administration finally approved the deal in late
2016, guaranteeing F-15 production into the mid-2020s. Unlike the F-22,
the United States maintains strategic flexibility in F-15 (and F-18 and
F-16) production, largely because of exports. This appears to be an
especially prescient decision, as the FY2020 U.S. Air Force budget
proposal requests money to purchase at least eight (and up to 100)
F-15EX air superiority platforms; a platform one industry reporter
highlighted "is only possible because other countries have spent roughly
\$5B over the last couple of decades to continuously evolve the F-15
into what it is today \[...\] basically, the \[Air Force\] is getting
\[these upgrades\] for free." [What About Saudi Arabia? In sum, more
restrictive arms sales, delivery suspensions, or outright embargos are
unlikely to succeed in policy coercion]{.underline}. [While arms
transfers provide an avenue of influence, embargos often lead to
diversification, not desired policy changes]{.underline}. Additionally,
fears of technology transfer and direct offsets creating a competitor
out of every client are generally unfounded in the high-end market in
which the United States generally deals. Finally, [while the large
domestic market provides the United States the luxury of sacrificing
financial gains for political influence, sometimes economics do matter,
particularly when it comes to saving a production line for future
flexibility]{.underline}. [These conclusions should therefore inform
U.S. policy on Saudi Arabia. The intent here is not to argue the moral
or ethical responsibility of U.S. leaders in responding to Saudi
Arabia's execution of journalists or tactics in the war in
Yemen]{.underline}. It is natural to see the horror wrought in Yemen and
want to take any actions necessary to stop it. However, I ultimately
argue against a Saudi embargo. This is not because, as the president has
argued, it might cost a few billion dollars and some hundreds of defense
industry jobs. As others have pointed out, [the economic impact of Saudi
arms purchases on the U.S. defense industry is relatively small. Rather,
embargoing Saudi Arabia is unlikely to fundamentally alter Saudi
policies, but likely to further damage U.S. ties with
Riyadh]{.underline}. In the near-term, Saudi Arabia can substitute other
weapons, such as the Eurofighter and Tornado, and "dumb bombs" instead
of U.S.-built "smart weapons." The Saudis can also rely more heavily on
their Emirati and Egyptian partners using non-U.S. produced arms. [In
the medium to long term, such an embargo is likely to push the Kingdom
to greater arms diversification. If history is any guide, the United
States will eventually lift any potential arms embargo with little
change in Saudi behavior, but only after having provided an opportunity
for adversary states such as Russia and China to gain a strategic
foothold in Riyadh]{.underline}. Some might counter that it would be
extremely difficult and costly, in both time and money, for the Saudis
to significantly diversify their arms acquisitions away from the United
States. This is absolutely the case. However, costly does not mean
impossible. Less wealthy states have already done it. Egypt is one
example above; but others such as Venezuela and even tiny Kuwait ---
frustrated at years of U.S. approval delays --- have significantly
diversified their arms acquisitions. [In other words, with the money and
options available to Saudi Arabia, and few other producers showing a
stomach for a full embargo, it is not unreasonable to believe that the
Saudis might significantly diversify their arms acquisitions over time
in response to a U.S. embargo]{.underline}. [Thus, while a U.S. embargo
might be morally compelling and emotionally satisfying, it is unlikely
to create meaningful change for those most at risk or be strategically
beneficial to the United States]{.underline}. In the absence of a
compelling, evidence-based case that an arms embargo on Saudi Arabia
might produce desired changes in behavior, policymakers should look
elsewhere for solutions to their Saudi problems.

million on lobbying Congress this year, according to data compiled by
the Center for Responsive Politics, a government watchdog. But recently
filed documents detailing expenses and reimbursements put the actual
number closer to \$9 million, said Lydia Dennett, investigator with the
Project on Government Oversight. "The Kingdom has a veritable army of
lobbyists and PR firms working to promote their interests in a wide
variety of ways," she said. The Foreign Influence Transparency
Initiative, a left-leaning think tank in Washington, recently compiled
records filed under Foreign Agents Registration Act that show in 2017
Saudi lobbyists contacted over 200 members of Congress, including every
Senator. The data also found the Saudi agents contacted officials in the
State Department, which oversees foreign military sales, nearly 100
times. [The Saudi-U.S. relationship is peerless when it comes to arms
sales.]{.underline} [The kingdom buys more American weapons than any
other nation. Saudi Arabia accounted for nearly one-fifth of American of
all weapons exports over the past five years,]{.underline} according to
a recent report by the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute.
[The Pentagon has a team]{.underline} of U.S. service members [based out

serves as a direct pipeline to move weapons from U.S. arms manufacturers
into the arms of the Saudi military. [The U.S. military's Joint Advisory
Division works alongside commanders in each branch of the Saudi military
to help fill their weapons needs.]{.underline} Once the Saudis commit to
what they want --- tanks, attack helicopters, missiles, ships,
laser-guided bombs --- the arms packages must be OK'd by the U.S.
Defense and State Departments, and approved by Congress. The arrangement
falls under the U.S. Military Training Mission to Saudi Arabia, which is
led by a two-star American general. [The mission is primarily designed
to bolster Saudi Arabia against arch-rival Iran in order to assert power
and influence in the Middle East.]{.underline} "We have other very good
allies in the Middle East, but if you look at Saudi Arabia: They're an
ally and they're a tremendous purchaser of not only military equipment,
but other things," Trump said Wednesday in the Oval Office. It was the
President's latest attempt to trumpet \$400 billion in business deals
that his administration signed in May 2017 during a two-day visit to
Saudi Arabia. The eye-popping figure includes \$110 billion in military
sales, which analysts point out is misleading because it represented
letters of interest and not firmed-up contracts. Saudi Arabia has thus
far only committed to purchase \$14.5 billion-worth of equipment since
the announcement was made 17 months ago. The Administration says the
Saudis are currently pursuing more than \$114 billion in military
hardware.

are preventing Iran from developing nuclear weapons and protecting
Israel and Saudi Arabia.]{.underline} "That's all I care about," Trump
said. "Look, Saudi Arabia is buying \$400 billion worth of things for
us. That's a very good thing." Experts say Trump's repeated claim that
Saudi Arabia has invested hundreds of billions of dollars in U.S. goods
and services has no basis in reality. [The Saudis signed letters of
offer and acceptance for \$14.5 billion worth of purchases as of October

HuffPost's request for comment about the other \$385.5 billion. Trump
also told Todd that he spoke to Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman
(known as MBS) on Friday ahead of his interview with NBC News and that
the two had "a great conversation[." Asked]{.underline} by Todd [if he
spoke to MBS about Khashoggi, Trump said, "It really didn't come up."
The CIA and Turkish authorities investigated Khashoggi's death and
determined MBS personally ordered his murder.]{.underline} Khashoggi,
59, a Washington Post columnist who had been living in the U.S., was an
outspoken critic of the Saudi royal family. On Oct. 2, 2018, he entered
the Saudi consulate in Istanbul to get documents he needed for his
planned marriage and instead was killed and dismembered by agents of the
Saudi government, the U.S. and Turkish officials reported. MBS has
denied any involvement in Khashoggi's death and [Trump has publicly
sided with the crown prince over his own intelligence
agencies.]{.underline} In defending America's continued partnership with
the Saudis, Trump claimed in the NBC interview that [the country is "a
big buyer" of U.S. products.]{.underline} "That means something to me,"
the president said. "It's a big producer of jobs." Trump denied that the
[Saudi promise to buy American goods prompted him to "overlook" some of
the country's "bad behavior."]{.underline} But when asked if he would
allow the FBI to investigate Khashoggi's death, as encouraged by the
United Nations, Trump said he believes it's already been "heavily
investigated." "I've seen so many different reports," Trump said.
"Iran's killed many, many people a day. Other countries in the Middle
East ― this is a hostile place. This is a vicious, hostile place. If
you're going to look at Saudi Arabia, look at Iran, look at other
countries." Todd asked whether Saudi Arabia had paid the right price for
the U.S. to essentially look the other way on Khashoggi's killing. "No,
no," Trump responded. "But I'm not like a fool that says, 'We don't want
to do business with them.' And by the way, if they don't do business
with us, you know what they do? They'll do business with the Russians or
with the Chinese." "Take their money," he added. "Take their money,
Chuck." Just last week, the U.N. announced it had found "credible
evidence" linking MBS to Khashoggi's murder and called on Trump to allow
the FBI to investigate further. [The Senate voted last week to block the
Trump administration from selling arms to Saudi Arabia. The president
has vowed to veto the measure.]{.underline} "There is high confidence
that the Crown Prince of Saudi Arabia butchered a dissident with a bone
saw," Sen. Rand Paul (R-Ky.), one of a handful of GOP members who voted
against the arms sales, told his colleagues on the Senate floor ahead of
the vote. "You would think that would give us pause as to giving Saudi
Arabia or selling Saudi Arabia more weapons.

worth around \$123 billion. The largest deal, if approved by Congress,
would be a \$60 billion package of U.S. arms for Saudi Arabia, including
eighty-four new and seventy refurbished F-15 fighters, supplied largely
by Boeing, as well as seventy Apache helicopters, seventy-two Black
Hawks, and thirty-six Little Birds. Is the deal [a good idea for the
United States and the Middle East]{.underline}? Three of four [experts
contributing to this CFR.org roundup basically thought so.]{.underline}
Anthony Cordesman argues that arms sales makes sense in terms of U.S.
oil interests, the U.S. need for an ally in the region that can ease the
burden on the U.S. military, and helping to stop a nuclear arms race in
the region. Loren Thompson and F. Gregory Gause III said the Saudis will
buy arms elsewhere if the United States refuses to move forward on the
sale. Thompson notes the package carefully balances Saudi requirements
and Israeli fears, and Gause suggests that even if the sale doesn't
create long-term stability in the region, there's likely to be some
foreign policy benefit for the United States and for the Saudis. William
Hartung sounded a cautionary note, warning the deal could spur a
regional arms race. [The United States shares critical strategic
interests with Saudi Arabia that shape the proposed Saudi arms sale.
First, for all the talk of energy independence over the last four
decades, the U.S. Department of Energy estimates that the United States
will be as strategically dependent on imported oil through 2035 as it is
today. These projections do not even take account of our indirect
imports of oil in the form of manufactured goods, or our dependence on
the health of a global economy that requires stable supply- and
market-driven prices. The stability of Gulf energy exports is critical
to our economy and every job in the United States Second, U.S. military

naval-air-assault force threat to the Gulf states. The U.S. invasion of
Iraq has left Iraqi forces a decade away from being a counterbalance to
Iran; Saudi Arabia is the only meaningful regional power to work with.
Additionally, al-Qaeda in the peninsula is based in Yemen, and the
threat of terrorism and outside infiltration means highly mobile Saudi
forces are critical to the security of Saudi energy and civil
facilities. Helping Saudi Arabia create a combination of effective air
and naval power also helps ensure the security of tanker and other
shipping in the Gulf of Oman and a steadily more unstable Red Sea.

a missile and chemical weapons threat and may pose a nuclear one within
the next three to five years. Upgrades of the Saudi Patriots create a

THAAD, and an emphasis on defense (not Saudi purchases of missiles or
nuclear systems). Coupled with recent U.S. offers of \"extended regional
deterrence\" and the creation of a Saudi Air Force that is more of a
threat to Iran than Iran's conventional missiles are to Saudi Arabia,
they offer the best hope of both giving Saudi Arabia and other Gulf
states security and stopping a nuclear arms race in the region. Fourth,

sold, and no future Saudi government can ignore this fact. Moreover, the
sales are large in dollar terms, but not in terms of numbers of weapons.
This will not be some kind of massive build-up. Saudi Arabia had an air
force with some 417 combat aircraft in 2000, and it now has only 219.
The Saudi F-15 buy will not even restore the force to 2000 numbers. It
will take some three to five years to deliver and put fully in service,
replace some eighty-seven obsolete F-5A/Bs and F-5EIIs that were in
service in 2000, and help Saudi Arabia compensate for the serious
performance limits on 107 aging Tornados still in service. The United
States shares critical strategic interests with Saudi Arabia that shape
the proposed Saudi arms sale. First, for all the talk of energy

#### Reducing arms sales to Saudi Arabia would destroy alliances- arm sales are K2 further relations with Saudi Arabia

President Trump has vetoed a series of measures approved by bipartisan
lawmakers that were aimed at blocking the sale of weapons to Saudi
Arabia. [Trump said the three resolutions would \"weaken America\'s
global competitiveness and damage the important relationship we share
with our allies and partners.\"]{.underline} Lawmakers in support of the
bills have criticized the Saudis\' actions in the Yemen conflict where
thousands of civilians have died, and the death of journalist Jamal
Khashoggi in the Saudi consulate in Istanbul[. The two measures vetoed
by Trump aimed specifically at arms sales to Saudi Arabia]{.underline}
were approved by the Senate last month with the support of seven
Republicans, including Sen. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina and Sen.
Susan Collins of Maine. [Trump also vetoed a bill that would have
limited the sale of weapons to the United Arab Emirates, which has been
an important coalition partner to Saudi Arabia in its ongoing military
campaign in Yemen.]{.underline} The legislation emerged after
frustration on Capitol Hill after the Trump administration decided to go
forward with a multibillion-dollar weapons and equipment sale to the
Gulf countries in May without the approval of Congress. As The
Associated Press reported, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said threats
from Iran were the reason the sale was approved without lawmakers
formally weighing in. Iran and Saudi Arabia are regional rivals. Saudis
Say Wrong Information Caused Bombing That Killed 140 In Yemen THE
TWO-WAY Saudis Say Wrong Information Caused Bombing That Killed 140 In
Yemen Sen. Bob Menendez, a Democrat from New Jersey, sponsored the bills
that his office described as intended \"to block the Trump
Administration\'s unprecedented attempt at approving over \$8 billion in
arms sales to Saudi and UAE based on a false emergency and without
Congressional consent.\" On Thursday, the Senate Foreign Relations
Committee backed a separate bill in a 13-9 vote that Menendez described
as \"a comprehensive effort to hold Saudi Arabia accountable for the
murder of U.S. resident and journalist Jamal Khashoggi, and the
Saudi-led coalition for its role in the devastating conflict in Yemen.\"
\"President Trump\'s veto to continue helping cover for Saudi Arabia\'s
transgressions, including the murder of Jamal Khashoggi, was as expected
as it was avoidable,\" Menendez told NPR on Thursday. \"There is clearly
no level to which this Administration will not stoop to curry favor with
the brutal Saudi leadership.\" He called for \"Congressional Democrats
and Republicans to speak truth to power and stand up for our
institutional prerogatives by overriding the President\'s veto.\" Last
month, a special U.N. investigator looking into Khashoggi\'s death said
there was \"credible evidence\" that senior Saudi officials had planned
what she called a \"deliberate, premeditated execution.\" Human rights
groups have repeatedly criticized Saudi Arabia and its coalition
partners for the high number of civilian casualties since they started
their offensive four years ago against Shiite Houthi rebels in Yemen.

The airstrikes have repeatedly hit sites with large numbers of civilians
such as markets and weddings. In a widely condemned example last year,
an airstrike hit a bus carrying children. Last November, the U.N. said
it documented 6,872 civilians killed and 10,768 injured since the start
of the Saudi campaign in March 2015, and the majority of the casualties
were caused by Saudi-led coalition airstrikes. \"The United States is
very concerned about the conflict\'s toll on innocent civilians and is
working to bring the conflict in Yemen to an end,\" [Trump said in his
veto message. \"But we cannot end it through ill-conceived and
time-consuming resolutions that fail to address its root causes.\" He
said that limiting the arms sales would \"likely prolong the conflict in
Yemen and deepen the suffering it causes.\" The U.S. has said it is
working with Saudi Arabia to reduce civilian casualties.]{.underline}
These three new vetoes from Trump bring his total up to five over the
course of his presidency. The first -- and the only one not involving
the conflict in Yemen --- was in March, where he vetoed a resolution
that would end his declaration of a national emergency on the southern
border. In April, Trump issued his second veto when he blocked a
bipartisan resolution to end U.S. involvement in Yemen hostilities,
calling it an \"unnecessary, dangerous attempt to weaken my
constitutional authorities.\"

#### US arms sales and our alliance with Saudi Arabia are key to check a litany of threats -- Iran aggression, Gulf terrorism, and Red Sea piracy

[U.S.-Saudi security cooperation is becoming steadily more important as
Iran expands its capabilities]{.underline} for asymmetric warfare in the
Gulf, increases its long-range missile forces, and moves toward a
capability to build and deploy nuclear weapons. [The same is true of the
enduring threat from terrorism,]{.underline} dealing with Iraq's
weakness and uncertain political leadership, the problems of Yemen, [and
instability and piracy in the Red Sea area and Indian Ocean. The United
States needs all the friends it can find in the Gulf]{.underline}. It
faces serious uncertainties in reshaping its security posture in the
region as its forces depart from Iraq. These include Iraq's uncertain
future political stance and government, the inability to predict Iranian
actions and alignments, the uncertain outcome of the Israeli-Palestinian
peace process, and uncertainties surrounding the success or failure of
the conflicts in Afghanistan and Pakistan. Saudi Arabia and Reshaping
the U.S. Strategic Posture in the Gulf At the same time, several factors
are clear. [There is no possible "end state" to the U.S. presence in the
Gulf nor an end to the need for the strongest possible U.S. security
ties to Saudi Arabia]{.underline} and other friendly states in the
region. The United State as must reshape its military posture in the
Gulf as it withdraws from the Gulf, as well as reshape its power
projection capabilities and contingency plans. It must shape its force
posture and cooperation with its regional allies to become more
effective in hybrid warfare and in a spectrum of conflicts ranging from
covert and proxy warfare to long-range missile defenses and extended
regional deterrence---addressing the military side of the risk that Iran
may become a nuclear power and giving its allies an incentive not to
acquire their own nuclear weapons and long-range missiles. [Iran remains
an emerging challenge. It is deeply involved in strategic
competition]{.underline} with the United States and its friends and
allies [in the region. It is developing steadily better capabilities to
attack]{.underline} shipping, targets in the Gulf, and targets on the
Saudi and southern Gulf coast, [and it is using asymmetric warfare in
doing so. It is fielding significant long-range missile forces and may
acquire nuclear weapons. If the United States is to deter other regional
states from proliferation in reaction to Iran, and make]{.underline} its
statements about offering ["extended regional deterrence" a credible
option, it must]{.underline} show it will [do its best to create
effective regional partners in the southern Gulf,]{.underline} as well
as try to build a strategic partnership with Iraq. At the same time,
[neither the United States nor its Gulf allies have any reason to seek
open confrontation with Iran]{.underline}. This is particularly true of
the Gulf states. "Speak softly and carry a big stick" may not be an old
Arab proverb, but Arab leaders have long practiced this with
considerable success. The United States can still count on some support
from allies like Britain and France, but the fact remains that it will
have to rely on Saudi Arabia and other Gulf states. The same forces that
have made the United States and Saudi Arabia key de facto partners in
Gulf security will become even more important in the future. Regardless
of the outcome of Iraq's effort to forge a new government, it will not
become a major regional military power again for at least a decade. [If
the United States is to have any major strategic partner in the Gulf, it
is going to be Saudi Arabia.]{.underline} As General David Petraeus and
others have explained, [the war against terrorism and extremism is going
to be a long war]{.underline}, likely to go on for the next 10 to 20
years. [The Gulf region is going to be one of the centers of this
conflict]{.underline}. Al Qa'ida is not suddenly going away, and new
organizations are certain to emerge. Nations like Yemen and Somalia
present serious long-term risks of becoming centers of terrorist
activity. The United States faces growing pressures to limit its
military spending and commitments, and it has steadily increasing needs
for regional allies with strong and interoperable forces to deter and
contain regional threats and fight alongside U.S. forces if necessary.
It may or may not be possible to move forward quickly in an
Israeli-Palestinian peace agreement, but [it is vital to minimize the
tensions between our Arab allies and Israel]{.underline}. King
Abdullah's peace plan may differ sharply with Israel's position, but it
shows that [the United States can sell arms to Saudi Arabia with minimal
risk of this impacting on Israel's security]{.underline}. In fact,
[strong U.S. security ties to Saudi Arabia offer Israel a far better
alternative than Saudi Arabia]{.underline} turning to European or other
suppliers and [questioning U.S. support if it faces a crisis with
Iran.]{.underline} The Need for U.S.-Saudi Cooperation At the same time,
[Saudi Arabia has strong incentives to maintain its security cooperation
with the United States and to build up its forces to deter and defend
against Iran]{.underline} and other potential threats. It faces the same
challenges and threats, it needs a strong ally, and it faces many of the
same strategic uncertainties. Moreover, there is no credible regional
alternative. The Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) has made progress, but
the individual southern Gulf states have had only limited success in
creating interoperable forces, integrated defense plans and command and
control systems, and forces tailored to the key missions that affect
deterrence and defense. They may collectively spend more than 10 times
as much as Iran on military forces and arms imports, but the end results
are often fragmented, showpiece forces that are symbols of national
prestige and divided from each other by national rivalries. Both the
United States and Saudi Arabia actively support a broader security
structure and effort to create more effective security cooperation among
all of the southern Gulf states. Nevertheless, [the Gulf military
balance is essentially a U.S.-Iranian military balance backed by Saudi
forces]{.underline} and with support from the other individual Gulf
states. As has been the case since the fall of the Shah, [Saudi Arabia
is the only meaningful "pillar" in Gulf security
cooperation.]{.underline} The Saudi Air Force is a major modern force,
and the Saudi Navy is growing in capability. Saudi ground forces are
capable of defending the kingdom against any Iranian infiltration and
raid. This does not mean that other southern Gulf states do not play an
important, if more limited, role. Bahrain, Kuwait, Oman, Qatar, and the
United Arab Emirates (UAE) all play an important role in providing U.S.,
British, and French forces with bases and contingency capabilities. The
UAE is developing advanced capabilities for its air force. All of the
southern Gulf states with the exception of Qatar have significant
capabilities to deter and defend themselves against Iranian action and
threats, and many are beginning to acquire some elements of missile
defense capability. Their capabilities are limited, however, and the
progress made in U.S.-led and GCC-led common exercises has not been
significant enough to tie them together into effective forces in any
given mission area. This is why U.S.-Saudi security cooperation remains
critical to the overall security of the Gulf, the security of world oil
exports, and the security of the Saudi Kingdom. While it is limited by
the fact that any deployment of active U.S. combat forces in Saudi
Arabia presents serious political problems for the kingdom, the United
States does maintain a major military training mission, a training and
support effort for the Saudi National Guard, and now a support mission
to help Saudi Arabia develop its counterterrorism capabilities.
Moreover, the United States is working with Saudi Arabia to help it
become a far more modern and effective force in ensuring Gulf security,
as well as the security of its borders with Yemen and the Red Sea area.
Building on a Strong Foundation Fortunately, this is a case where both
nations have a strong foundation to build upon. [The United States has
long been a major supplier to the GCC states]{.underline} and has
already sold Saudi Arabia the E-2A AWACS surveillance aircraft,
Sikorsky's UH-60 Black Hawks, Raytheon-built Patriot and Hawk missile
defense systems, and General Dynamics's M1A2 tanks. It has worked with
the GCC states in joint exercises and has quietly developed a high level
of cooperation in counterterrorism. [It has worked with the Saudi
Kingdom and other Gulf states in developing counters to Iran's steadily
increasing capabilities]{.underline} for naval asymmetric warfare and
operations against offshore and coastal targets, and it is steadily
upgrading the air defense forces of many GCC state to provide missile
defense capabilities. [The United States has worked with Saudi Arabia to
develop long-term procurement plans that will improve the kingdom's
capabilities, limit the credibility of any Iranian threats of
intimidation, help defend against terrorist or extremist
attacks]{.underline}, and fight alongside the United States against any
escalation to large-scale conflict. **[New U.S. arms sales to Saudi
Arabia are part of this effort]{.underline}**, although major additional
sales are underway or planned for key states like Kuwait and the UAE.
Also, the United States is working closely with Bahrain, Oman, and Qatar
and has bases or contingency bases in these countries. The U.S.
Department of Defense has not yet notified Congress of all the details
of a major new arms sale to Saudi Arabia, but it is clear what this sale
could have a direct value well in excess of \$50 billion to \$60 billion
and mean maintaining a de facto military partnership with Saudi Arabia
for at least the next decade. In fact, [it means the Saudi Air Force
will remain **critically dependent** on U.S. military and contractor
support]{.underline}. According to press reports from Bloomberg News and
the Wall Street Journal, and work by the Washington Institute for Near
East Policy, the sale could include: 84 new Boeing F-15 combat aircraft,
virtually ensuring Saudi air superiority over Iran for the next decade,
as well as a far higher level of interoperability with U.S. air forces.
The radar equipment on these aircraft is yet to be announced, but [it
may give the Saudi Air Force far more capability to deal with the kind
of small, dispersed target sets that match Iran's]{.underline}
development of dispersed elements of Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guards
Corps and the threats posed by its [focus on asymmetric
warfare.]{.underline} Refurbishing and upgrading 70 existing Saudi F-15S
strike aircraft will help achieve the same objectives. New air
munitions, probably including air-to-surface missiles with the same
precision and ability to fire from outside the range of Iranian air
defenses as those used by the U.S. Air Force. Up to 60 AH-64D Longbow
Apache attack helicopters and upgrades to 12 existing AH-64As that can
be used to deal with threats in areas like the Yemeni border, defend
coastal and offshore targets, and counter internal threats from any
major terrorist attack. 72 UH-60 helicopters, in addition to the 22
UH-60s now in Saudi forces, greatly enhancing Saudi air mobility and
capability to react to any major threat in the Gulf or on its borders.
36 "Little Bird" MH-6/AH-6 helicopters, giving Special Forces added
mobility and firepower for counterterrorism and counterinfiltration
missions. Upgrades to Saudi Arabia's Patriot PAC 2 missile forces that
will improve both air defense against any Iranian air threat and begin
to give Saudi Arabia meaningful missile defense capability against a
growing Iranian missile threat. A mix of new patrol ships like the
Littoral Combat Ship and other naval weapons that will help defend Saudi
coastal waters and offshore facilities and deal with the major emerging
threat from the naval branch of Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guards.
Meeting the Challenge of Iran Large as [these arms
transfers]{.underline} may seem, it is important to understand that the
weapons numbers involved are relatively limited, given the overall size
of forces in the Gulf. Moreover, their actual cost and size will only
become clear once firm contracts are signed, and major deliveries will
occur over at least a five-year period. They [meet key Saudi concerns in
force expansion and modernization, provide the basis for full
interoperability with U.S. forces in a crisis or conflict, and give
Saudi Arabia a significant "edge" in air superiority against
Iran]{.underline}. [Moreover, they]{.underline} given the kingdom the
ability to improve the overall protection of its borders and coasts,
[assist in countering any serious terrorist attacks]{.underline}, and
deal with any attacks or challenges in Yemen and the Red Sea area. From
a U.S. viewpoint, [these arms transfers are part of a new]{.underline}
post--Iraq War [security structure]{.underline} that can secure the flow
of energy exports to the global economy. [They reinforce the level of
regional deterrence]{.underline} rather than threaten it; and they help
reduce the size of forces the United States must deploy or be ready to
project into the region. They also help ensure the U.S. strategic
position in the region at time when other powers like China are becoming
key players in global energy and when recycling "petrodollars" is even
more important than in the past. Hopefully, [a combination of such U.S.
and Saudi efforts will create an effective deterrent and not have to be
used.]{.underline} The United States also can never take Saudi
willingness to support U.S. military operations for granted,
particularly after U.S. miscalculations in Iraq. The fact remains,
however, that [U.S.-Saudi ties are critical to both deterrence and
defense, to any effective effort to check Iran's expanding military
capabilities]{.underline}, and to any hope that regional security
structures can advance to the point where the United States can create a
far more limited and "over-the-horizon" military presence and set of
contingency capabilities.

#### Engagement good -- regional stability 

**Cohen 18** (Jordan Cohen is a Political Science Ph.D. student at
George Mason University's Schar School of Policy and Government. His
dissertation focuses on alliances and alliance entrapment.; "Alliances
Are a Net Gain, Not a Loss, for America";

Recently, following a meeting with the North Atlantic Treaty
Organization's (NATO) G7, United States President Donald Trump used
Twitter to express his frustrations with the European alliance network.
The president noted that the United States pays "close to the entire
cost of NATO--- protecting many of these same countries that rip us off
on trade." He also said that "Germany pays 1% (slowly) of GDP towards
NATO, while we pay 4% of a MUCH larger GDP." In these tweets, Trump
echoes two large myths about America's alliance system. These myths are
that NATO allies free ride off the United States and that American
allies provide little-to-no security benefit. The idea that European
allies free ride off U.S. security spending is long-standing. George
Kennan posited that a united Europe would effectively balance against
the Soviet Union, but politicians are less trusting. Dwight Eisenhower
frequently lamented that European allies were not spending enough for
their defense. Furthermore, historical documents show that, when England
cut its defense spending in the mid-1960s, the Johnson administration
was noticeably frustrated. Moreover, according to Pew Research Center's
surveys conducted since the end of the Cold War, most Americans support
NATO, but a large proportion believes Washington's policymakers spend
too much money helping the organization. In other words, Americans think
that NATO allies are paying their "fair share" on defense, and thereby
take advantage of U.S. security spending. [Consequently, there is broad
acceptance regarding the myth of a free riding NATO. The problem is that
this myth ignores Kennan's still-standing Cold War logic. For Kennan,
**the central idea of NATO was to de-securitize Western European states
and**, paradoxically, **strengthen European security**.]{.underline}
This meant that by reducing the Europeans' state-led processes of
increasing power, European states would focus on "collective security"
instead of just their own. [Such a plan was compelling because, after
World War II, European states faced a threat from communism and the
Soviet Union. Accordingly, they were willing to avoid things like
building nuclear weapons so that they could join Washington's "security
umbrella." Furthermore, this increased European collective security.
Additionally, for the United States, **this reduced the likelihood of
war between its European allies and provided a way to balance against
the Soviet Union**.]{.underline} In the present, while there is no
Soviet threat, avoiding a European security dilemma is advantageous for
Washington. G. John Ikenberry's book After Victory examines the history
of "world order." [**He finds that liberal, rules-based orders---**like
that established by the United States after World War II**---last longer
and are significantly more peaceful than both hegemonic rule and
"balance of power" systems.**]{.underline} Two of the most critical
contemporary threats to the rules-based order is Russia's and China's
rising power and their expanding interests throughout Europe. [NATO
serves to counteract those threats, and in doing so, maintains the
international system's stability.]{.underline} Therefore, retrenching
from Europe is another grave threat facing the U.S.-led international
order, and one Trump should take seriously. The second myth that Trump's
statements feed is that United States' alliances provide minimal
benefits. Individuals who agree with this argue that Washington's
commitments to its friends both limit America's ability to establish its
supremacy and entrap it into conflict because of contractual
obligations. Consequently, by retrenching from formal defense pacts, the
United States could elongate its unipolar status. Inverting this logic,
however, shows the reality of the situation. [First, allies limiting
American primacy is a net benefit. Frankly, reducing the amount of war
and conflict is inherently advantageous, and can preserve U.S. economic
and military strength.]{.underline} In his 2015 article, "[The Myth of
Entangling
Alliances](https://www.belfercenter.org/sites/default/files/legacy/files/IS3904_pp007-048.pdf),"
[Michael Beckley argues that U.S. defense pacts reduce the risks of
conflict. This is because, by having many allies across the world,
America faces conflicting commitments and needs to restrain itself
militarily so that it can satisfy these varying agreements. The
offsetting obligations allow Washington to avoid unnecessary
conflict.]{.underline} Thus, similar to investment portfolios,
[America's significant number of alliances reduce the risk of future
war. Furthermore, because of Washington's dominant position in its
alliance hierarchies, it can effectively restrain its allies from great
conflicts. Smaller countries that do not want to increase their security
risk will not engage in wars that their stronger allies wish to avoid.
These small countries see a security benefit from great power alliances,
and the former is subservient to the latter.]{.underline} For example,
in Asia after World War II, Washington restrained South Korea from
attacking North Korea and Taiwan from fighting China via threats to
reduce American military and economic support. Moreover, the United
States threatened to end its arms sales to Iran, thus forcing Tehran to
avoid joining the 1973 oil embargo. Accordingly, America's alliances
provide it leverage that increases its immediate security and decrease
global conflict. Overall, Trump and other critics fundamentally
misunderstand the benefit to the U.S. alliance network. [NATO and other
allies serve to maintain the current rules-based international order,
reduce Washington's risk of war, and decrease levels of global
conflict.]{.underline} Therefore, abandoning U.S. allies under the guise
of "America first" would harm American security, and just mean "America
alone."

ENTANGLING ALLIANCES";
<https://warontherocks.com/2015/06/the-myth-of-entangling-alliances/>;
accessed 7/26/19)

[American concerns about entangling alliances are as old as the Republic
itself. During the post--World War II era, however, there have been only
ªve ostensible episodes of U.S. entanglement, and even these cases are
questionable.]{.underline} The case in which alliance obligations had
the largest impact on U.S. decisionmaking (the 1995--96 Taiwan Strait
crisis) entailed minimal military action, and the case that entailed the
most military action (the Vietnam War) contained only a marginal role
for alliance politics in U.S. decisionmaking. In the other three cases
(the 1954--55 Taiwan Strait crisis and the wars in Bosnia and Kosovo),
both the effect of alliance obligations on U.S. policy and the costs
suffered by U.S. forces were moderate. [And beyond these cases,
entanglement was virtually nonexistent in U.S. foreign policy. Against
this limited evidence of entanglement are numerous cases in which
alliances restrained the United States. Allies dissuaded the United
States from escalating the Korean War and crises in Laos and Berlin, and
struggled in vain to prevent the United States from entering or
escalating other conºicts, the 2003 Iraq War being only the latest major
example. Indeed, **instances of alliance-induced restraint are evident
even within the ªve cases of entanglement** discussed
above]{.underline}: in the 1954--55 Taiwan Strait crisis, concerns about
European alliances discouraged U.S. policymakers from bombing the
Chinese mainland and publicly committing to defend Jinmen and Mazu; in
the Vietnam War, allies impeded U.S. entry into the war and then
repeatedly implored the United States to get out; and in Bosnia and
Kosovo, U.S. allies initially restrained the United States from lashing
out violently and then provided all of the NATO ground forces and most
of the postconºict peacekeepers for the eventual operations. [There also
are several cases in which the United States sidestepped inconvenient
alliance commitments, restrained an ally from attacking a third party,
or openly sided against an ally---and this list could probably be
expanded by looking within other cases, including the ªve ostensible
cases of entanglement.]{.underline} As explained earlier, the United
States blatantly retracted a pledge to Taiwan to defend Jinmen and Mazu
in 1955, refused to save the French at Dien Bien Phu in 1954, delegated
ground operations and most of the postconºict peacekeeping in Bosnia and
Kosovo to allies, and waited for eight months and the receipt of private
security assurances before responding militarily to China's provocative
behavior near Taiwan in 1995--96. [In sum, the empirical record shows
that **the risk of entanglement is real but manageable and that**, for
better or worse, **U.S. security policy lies ªrmly in the hands of U.S.
leaders and is shaped primarily by those leaders' perceptions of the
nation's core interests.** When the United States has overreached
militarily, the main cause has not been entangling alliances but rather
what Richard Betts calls "self-entrapment"---the tendency of U.S.
leaders to deªne national interests expansively, to exaggerate the
magnitude of foreign threats, and to underestimate the costs of military
intervention.]{.underline}188 Developing a disciplined defense policy
therefore will require the emergence of prudent leadership, the
development (or resurrection) of guidelines governing the use of
force,189 the establishment of domestic institutional constraints on the
president's authority to send U.S. forces into battle, or some
combination of these.190 [Scrapping alliances, by contrast, would simply
unleash the United States to act on its interventionist impulses while
leaving it isolated diplomatically and militarily.]{.underline} To be
sure, certain alliances may need to be revised or dissolved as
circumstances change. Past performance is no guarantee of future
results, and U.S. entanglement risk may shift over time. For example,
China's development of antiaccess/area-denial capabilities may
substantially increase the risks to the United States of maintaining
alliance commitments in East Asia.191 Conversely, [U.S. allies may be
able to use similar capabilities to defend themselves and thereby allow
the United States to maintain alliance commitments while limiting risks
to U.S. forces.]{.underline}192 This study does not account for such
emerging trends and, therefore, cannot rule out the possibility that the
U.S. alliance network will need to be revised in the future. What this
study does suggest, however, is that such revisions should be modest.
[The historical record shows that **allies often help keep U.S. troops
at home not only by bearing some of the burden for U.S. wars, but also
by encouraging the United States to stay out of wars
altogether.**]{.underline} Large-scale retrenchment would sacriªce these
and other beneªts of alliances while doing little to compel U.S. leaders
to deªne national interests modestly or choose military interventions
selectively. How to accomplish those goals will continue to be the
subject of debate, but those debates will be more productive if they
focus on domestic culprits rather than foreign friends.

[Saudi Arabia enjoys a privileged position both in geopolitical and
economic terms. It will have a powerful hand to play if tensions with
the US and the west escalate and it follows through with Sunday's
warning of retaliation.]{.underline} Its vast oil reserves -- it claims
to have about 260bn barrels still to extract -- afford the most obvious
advantage. [The kingdom is the world's largest oil
exporter,]{.underline} pumping or shipping about 7m barrels a day, and
giving Riyadh huge clout in the global economy because [it wields power
to push up prices.]{.underline} An editorial in Arab News by Turki
Aldhakhil, the general manager of the official Saudi news channel, Al
Arabiya, offers a hint of what could be in the offing. He said [Riyadh
was]{.underline} weighing up 30 measures designed to [put pressure on
the US if it were to impose sanctions over the disappearance and
presumed murder of Jamal Khashoggi inside the country's Istanbul
consulate. These would include an oil production cut that could drive
prices from around \$80 (£60) a barrel to more than \$400, more than
double the all-time high of \$147.27 reached in 2008. This would have
profound consequences]{.underline} globally, not just because motorists
would pay more at the petrol pump, but because [it would force up the
cost of all goods that travel by road.]{.underline} Donald Trump shakes

It is the world's second-largest arms importer after India and 61% of
those imports come from the US. It was the US's biggest arms customer
last year, signing \$17.5bn worth of deals, a trend that looks set to
continue after Donald Trump signed a \$110bn defence agreement in Riyadh
last year. The alliance stands to benefit US employers such as Lockheed
Martin, Boeing, General Electric and ExxonMobil. Some of the firms are
reported to have expressed concern to Trump already about the impact
that a freeze in Saudi-US relations might have. [Riyadh could, for
example, simply switch its purchases to other major arms exporters such
as Russia and China.]{.underline} Trump's trip to the Arabian peninsula
last year also yielded an agreement that the kingdom's Public Investment
Fund, which manages its vast oil wealth, would invest in US
infrastructure programmes. The PIF is to stump up \$20bn of a \$40bn pot
overseen by the global asset manager Blackstone. The fund, however, has
yet to gather any serious momentum. [Saudi Arabia]{.underline} has shown
in the past that it [is not afraid to leverage its unique political and
economic position to get its own way.]{.underline} An investigation into
allegations of bribery involving the British defence firm BAE Systems in
the country was dropped under Tony Blair's government in 2006. Blair
said Riyadh had threatened to stop cooperating on intelligence matters,
putting Britain at greater risk of a terrorist attack. Seth Frantzman,
the executive director of the US-based Middle East Center for Reporting
and Analysis, said the kingdom's importance to US strategy in the Gulf,
particularly as a bulwark against Iran, gave it great influence.
"They're part of an American-Saudi-UAE alliance, and the current US
administration is tough on Iran, so in some ways the US is more beholden
to Saudi Arabia than in previous years," he said. "They don't want to be
humiliated in this exchange. The US press says Trump will punish Saudi
Arabia, and they don't want to come out of this looking like the child
being punished. ["Saudi probably feels it's on a winning streak
economically and if it has to take a hit, which it already is in terms
of its image, it will be made up for by the fact they'll find markets
somewhere else."]{.underline} Saudi Arabia does have something to lose
though, given that foreign money is a key plank of its plans to
diversify its economy away from oil and address a high unemployment rate
of nearly 13%. The Saudi stock market plunged by as much as 7%, or
around \$33bn, over fears about the ramifications of the country's
threat of retaliation against the US. International investors are
already turning their backs, and a number of high-profile names have
pulled out of an investment conference later this month dubbed "Davos in
the Desert". They include Uber's chief executive, Dara Khosrowshahi ,
and the US media giant Viacom's boss Bob Bakish. Sir Richard Branson has
suspended discussions with the Saudi government that might have led to
it investing in his space tourism project Virgin Galactic.

[Military alliances]{.underline}, such as NATO, [are the best-known
instrument of security cooperation]{.underline}, but they cannot address
every concern. Governments also sign specific agreements on a wide range
of issues, military exercises and training, peacekeeping,
counterterrorism, personnel exchanges, defense policy, and the
development and sale of weapons. [The result is a sprawling web of
protocols, memoranda, and treaties, often referred to as "bilateral
security agreements."]{.underline} My research on this topic shows that
[governments use these agreements to provide the legal frameworks that
allow soldiers, diplomats, bureaucrats, and spies from different
countries to work together every day.]{.underline} [Such agreements are
meant to tackle modern threats]{.underline}: terrorism, cyberattacks,
transnational rebel movements, biological and chemical weapons, piracy,
and trafficking in dangerous materials. [Such cooperation enhances U.S.
national security]{.underline}. As former Secretary of Defense Ash
Carter wrote in this magazine in 2016, [security agreements allow
countries "to take coordinated action in response to humanitarian crises
and natural disasters, address common challenges such as terrorism, and
ensure the security of and equal access to the commons."]{.underline} A
2007 agreement with Singapore on research related to homeland security,
for example, paved the way for inspectors to scan U.S.-bound freight for
nuclear or radioactive materials. A little-known 2013 agreement with
Libya helped eliminate that country's remaining stocks of chemical
weapons, preventing them from falling into the hands of terrorists or
other transnational groups. [The Trump administration is getting left
behind]{.underline}. [Many of today's most dangerous
threats]{.underline}---terrorism, cyberattacks, biological and chemical
weapons, piracy, drug trafficking---[cannot be fought by one country
alone]{.underline}. Governments need to share intelligence, coordinate
policies, conduct joint exercises, allow one another access to military
bases, and collaborate to develop new defense technologies. [Failing to

Throughout the conference, participants and attendees kept coming back
to the same critical question: [If the U.S. is slowly disengaging from
the Middle East, will China necessarily fill the void? **The answer is a
qualified yes**]{.underline}. First, because the [Belt and Road
Initiative (BRI) is the most ambitious geopolitical and geo-economic
program since the Marshall Plan]{.underline}, and surpasses it in scope
and costs. The Marshall Plan dealt with the rebuilding of Europe only,
while the U.S. also helped raising Japan from the ashes of World War II.
It was limited in time to four years. [Belt and Road]{.underline},
proclaimed by Chairman Xi Jinping in 2013, [involves over 80 countries
in Eurasia, Europe, South and Southeast Asia, the Middle East and
Africa]{.underline}. Middle East energy will be the lifeblood of BRI,
with China its engine and brain. Western Europe and the developing world
will be its market. [The United States so far failed to offer a
comprehensive, strategic response]{.underline} to Belt and Road, which
would need to include an economic, cultural and human dimension.
Instead, under both the Obama and the Trump Administration, Washington
is sticking to mostly military answers, while ipso facto creating an
anti-American block that includes Russia and China -- something Henry
Kissinger warned against over 40 years ago. Second, [Beijing is
**aggressively bolstering its Near East presence.** China is already
building strategic partnerships with countries from Algeria to Saudi
Arabia to Iran, Iraq, and the UAE]{.underline}. It is targeting major
OPEC and Gulf Cooperation Council members, [while also focusing on U.S.
allies, like Israel, Jordan, Qatar, and Egypt.]{.underline} Following
World War II, the British Lion went home to lick his wounds. The British
Empire could not sustain its presence in the Middle East after losing
its Jewel in the Crown -- India -- in 1947. In the aftermath of the
protracted and costly wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, the American Eagle
wants a respite. Vital national interests of the U.S., chief among them
energy, are no longer bound to the Middle East region due to the shale
gale. Attention is now shifting to the Pacific, as China, the peer
competitor, is not flinching over its South China Sea expansion. The
People's Liberation Army (PLA) Navy is planning to build four carrier
battle groups, and is targeting American aircraft carriers with new
ship-busting nuclear-tipped ballistic missiles. China's high-tech naval
railguns and hypersonic cruise missiles are just around the corner. [The
security of the Middle East]{.underline} and its energy supplies [will
be defined in the next two decades by the **balance of military and
economic power between the U.S., China**, and Russia.]{.underline}
Within the region, [**the confrontation between Saudi Arabia** and the
UAE **vs. Iran** and Qatar will take center stage.]{.underline}

still primarily economic --- [are not limited to commercial and
financial activity. Xi is augmenting the country's economic gains with
diplomatic exchanges]{.underline}, notably his January 2016 tour of
Saudi Arabia, Egypt, and Iran. [Xi subsequently welcomed]{.underline}
Saudi Arabia's [King Salman and]{.underline} Israeli Prime Minister
[Benjamin Netanyahu to Beijing]{.underline} for official visits. [China
has also demonstrated a new]{.underline}, if cautious, [willingness to

example, [Beijing has given the]{.underline} Bashar al-[Assad

backing]{.underline} as well as consistent support in the Chinese media.
[Beijing has also hosted Israelis and Palestinians for a Peace
Symposium.]{.underline} Although it is unlikely that China will ever
play a prominent role as a mediator in either of these crises, its
increasing willingness to wade into divisive regional issues
demonstrates Beijing's changing perception of its role in the region.
[Beyond these diplomatic overtures, China has ramped up its military
engagement across the Middle East. The Chinese navy has made efforts to
demonstrate its presence in]{.underline} the vicinity of [strategic
chokepoints such as the Strait of Hormuz, the Bab el-Mandeb strait, and
the Suez Canal.]{.underline} Since 2010, the navy has conducted port
calls in every nation in the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC), Egypt,
Israel, and Iran. In June 2017, China and Iran conducted a joint naval
exercise on the fringe of the Strait of Hormuz. Building on port visits
and exercises, and leveraging dual-use infrastructure created by its
regional investments, [**China could ultimately seek to obtain**
**military access in the region**]{.underline} --- much as it did in

export controls. Preliminary open-source satellite imagery indicates
that China recently sold such UAVs to the United Arab Emirates.
Reporting from Yemen indicates that these drones are being actively
employed in the ongoing campaign to eliminate prominent Houthi leaders.
Moreover, China has reportedly inked an agreement to open a new facility
in Saudi Arabia to manufacture military drones. Although China has
little hope of displacing the United States as the region's preeminent
arms supplier, military sales to the Middle East generate new markets
for China's low-cost, high-tech weapons systems, which further
incentivize Chinese indigenous research, development, and production.
And China's willingness to sell weapons to nearly any actor, regardless
of its intentions, could exacerbate regional conflicts by providing
countries with the means to wage war at attractive prices. [Now is the

[As the Middle East becomes ever more unstable, a surprising victor may
be emerging: China. Under President Xi Jinping, China has accelerated
its engagement with the Middle East --- a region Beijing once treated as
peripheral to its interests. **Increased trade and investment,
invigorated diplomatic exchanges, and expanded military ties are
gradually transforming China's position in the Middle
East.**]{.underline} Unless Washington can free its focus from the
crises of the moment, [Beijing may realize its ambitions: a Middle East
more squarely within its own economic and diplomatic orbit, where the
United States remains responsible for addressing the region's most
intractable challenges. Oil has traditionally served as the glue holding
together America's relationships with key Arab states.]{.underline} Yet
while the United States has revitalized its domestic petroleum
production through the fracking revolution and reduced its dependence on
foreign oil, China's energy imports from the region have surged as the
Middle East's demand for energy at home has grown. Today, even as
Beijing seeks to diversify its sources of foreign oil away from the
region, it remains the among the top three importers from Saudi Arabia,
Iraq, and Iran. [China's appetite for Middle Eastern energy is creating
the conditions for economic interdependence that mirrors the ties that
have bound the United States to Saudi Arabia and other Gulf countries.
This co-dependency runs the risk of curbing U.S. influence and rendering
key Arab states more susceptible to Chinese demands.]{.underline}
Indeed, Beijing has not shied away from using its leverage as a leading
energy importer --- in a recent example, it threatened to scale back oil
imports from Saudi Arabia over a pricing dispute. Beyond energy trade,
[China's economic influence across the Middle East has expanded through
its investment. Arab countries, eager to reduce their dependency on oil
exports and diversify their economies through creating new industries,
are welcoming Chinese investment. Saudi Arabia and Jordan are both in
discussions with Beijing to harmonize their development plans with the
Belt and Road Initiative --- Xi's signature piece of economic
statecraft. In the case of Saudi Arabia, this alignment of strategic
visions has translated into a strong commercial signing package during
King Salman's March 2017 state visit to Beijing, totaling \$65 billion
of bilateral agreements in the oil, space, and renewable energy
sectors.]{.underline} Additionally, Egyptian collaboration with China on
a new Suez Canal cooperation zone is underway. In Duqm, Oman, Chinese
capital inflows transformed a backwater fishing village into a \$10.7
billion "Sino-Oman Industrial City" featuring an oil refinery capable of
processing 235,000 barrels per day. In positioning its engagement with
the Middle East as purely commercial in nature, [China has enhanced its
economic relations with the Arab states without endangering its
similarly growing ties with Israel and Iran.]{.underline} In Israel,
China has invested in ports and railways, and it has become a growing
player in the Israeli high-tech sector. At a time when the United States
and its allies in Europe, Australia, and Japan increasingly regard
Chinese investment as a threat to their long-term innovation edge,
Israel, without taking appropriate precautions, could become a backdoor
for China to obtain the technology it needs to realize its ambitions to
dominate the critical industries of the 21st century. China's economic
relationship with Iran, for which it is the No. 1 trading partner, has
continued to deepen. As European firms fretted last year about a return
of U.S. sanctions under President Donald Trump, Chinese state-owned
investment arm CITIC Group established a \$10 billion credit line for
Iran. In 2017, China-Iran trade exceeded \$37 billion, with year-on-year
growth of 19 percent. U.S. withdrawal from the Iran nuclear deal and the
threat of new sanctions puts all foreign companies under growing
pressure to scale down their presence in Iran. Yet the specter of
sanctions does not appear to have dissuaded Beijing from continuing to
enhance its trade and investment relationship with Tehran, which will
--- as it did prior to the nuclear deal --- have few alternatives to
China going forward. [**China's burgeoning ties with the Middle East ---
though still primarily economic --- are not limited to commercial and
financial activity.** Xi is augmenting the country's economic gains with
diplomatic exchanges, notably his January 2016 tour of Saudi Arabia,
Egypt, and Iran. Xi subsequently welcomed Saudi Arabia's King Salman and

infrastructure initiative in partnership with Saudi Arabia and the UAE,
U.S. allies that are keen to play the role of hubs linking the region
both internally and to Africa and the Indian Ocean. With many countries
in the Middle East eager to diversify their sources of domestic energy
production away from fossil fuels, the United States should consider a
regional energy agenda premised on efficiency and the use of renewables.
On both infrastructure and energy, Japan, which ranks among the top five
export destinations for all GCC countries, could play a pivotal --- and
reinforcing --- role in counterbalancing China's regional economic
influence. Finally, the United States should continue pressing China to
expand the Belt and Road Initiative to countries in need of
reconstruction assistance, such as Iraq, Syria, and Yemen. Washington
should be unafraid of comparing the hypocrisy of Xi's "community with
shared future for mankind" with Beijing's tepid interest in
post-conflict reconstruction efforts. With tensions roiling the Middle
East, it would be easy for the United States to simply ignore China's
quiet power play. But that would be a mistake --- one that will enable
Beijing to continue to capitalize on economic opportunities across the
region and solidify its diplomatic influence while leaving Washington to
carry the burden of crisis management.

The U.S. is assembling its allies in Warsaw this week to coordinate
Middle East policy-- but with limited success. EU policy chief Federica
Mogherini, joined by China, Russia, France, Germany, Turkey, and Qatar
are boycotting the gathering, opting to adopt a more diplomatic,
business-focused, and 'less confrontational' track with the Islamic
Republic. At the same time, Washington is sending mixed signals,
announcing its withdrawal from Syria (and Afghanistan), with President
Trump calling Bashar al-Assad's country a place of "sand and death". The
U.S. is awash in oil and gas, projected to become a net energy exporter
next year. 2020 should also see domestic production reach a record 13
million barrels of oil per day. This does not increase America's
interest in the Middle East. China, on the other hand, is only growing
thirstier for energy. Most of its oil comes from OPEC members in the
Persian Gulf. A whopping 45% of Middle East trade is with Asia, whereas
only 14% is with the U.S., and 7% with Europe. [China has replaced the
UAE as the main investor in the Middle East, focusing on energy.
However, \$3.5 trillion dollars of future opportunities in the Middle
East are awaiting Asian investors -- from infrastructure projects, to
tourism, to industry, says Nasser Saidi, the former Chief Economist of
the Dubai International Financial Center and the former Lebanese central
banker.]{.underline} Saidi and other top experts spoke at a conference
organized by the Middle East Institute of the National University of
Singapore (NUS) this week. The event, titled The Middle East Pivot:
China's Belt and Road Initiative -- between Geostrategy and Commercial
Opportunity, attracted business people and academics from China, the
U.S., Singapore, and the Gulf. This author presented a report "Future
Calling: Infrastructure Investment in Central Asia". Throughout the
conference, participants and attendees kept coming back to the same
critical question: [**If the U.S. is slowly disengaging from the Middle
East, will China necessarily fill the void? The answer is a qualified
yes**. **First, because the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) is the most
ambitious geopolitical and geo-economic program since the Marshall
Plan**, and surpasses it in scope and costs.]{.underline} The Marshall
Plan dealt with the rebuilding of Europe only, while the U.S. also
helped raising Japan from the ashes of World War II. It was limited in
time to four years. Belt and Road, proclaimed by Chairman Xi Jinping in
2013, involves over 80 countries in Eurasia, Europe, South and Southeast
Asia, the Middle East and Africa. [Middle East energy will be the
lifeblood of BRI, with China its engine and brain.]{.underline} Western
Europe and the developing world will be its market. [The United States
so far failed to offer a comprehensive, strategic response to Belt and
Road, which would need to include an economic, cultural and human
dimension.]{.underline} Instead, under both the Obama and the Trump
Administration, [Washington is sticking to mostly military answers,
while ipso facto creating an anti-American block that includes Russia
and China]{.underline} -- something Henry Kissinger warned against over
40 years ago. **[Second, Beijing is aggressively bolstering its Near
East presence.]{.underline}** [China is already building strategic
partnerships with countries from Algeria to Saudi Arabia to Iran, Iraq,
and the UAE. It is targeting major OPEC and Gulf Cooperation Council
members, while also focusing on U.S. allies, like Israel, Jordan, Qatar,
and Egypt.]{.underline} Following World War II, the British Lion went
home to lick his wounds. The [British Empire could not sustain its
presence in the Middle East after losing its Jewel in the Crown -- India
-- in 1947. In the aftermath of the protracted and costly wars in Iraq
and Afghanistan, the American Eagle wants a respite. Vital national
interests of the U.S., chief among them energy, are no longer bound to
the Middle East region due to the shale gale.]{.underline}

[Crude oil is a key strategic, imported commodity for Beijing, and
the]{.underline} [[Middle
Eastern](https://www.eia.gov/todayinenergy/detail.php?id=34812) states
trail only Russia as supply sources for China.]{.underline} As the
world's largest petroleum consumer with declining domestic petroleum
production, [China aims to expand its refining and storage capacity to
decrease its exposure to global energy market volatility]{.underline}.
[The U.S. goal of bringing Iran's crude exports to zero threatens
China's import-based strategy, and all indications are that
Beijing]{.underline}---Tehran's top importer---[will duly ignore the
sanctions and continue business more or less as usual.]{.underline} Iran
also figures to be a linchpin in China's Belt and Road Initiative (BRI),
with Chinese infrastructure investment in Iran totaling \$8.5 billion in
loans from the Export-Import Bank of China through early 2018. As full
secondary sanctions on oil are re-imposed in November[, Iran threatens
to become the focal point of the looming U.S.-China trade war, with
potentially grim implications.]{.underline} [Oil prices are likely to
climb in 2019 as Iranian oil comes offline]{.underline}, resulting in
higher costs for downstream products, although it is possible the effect
will be [a
wash](https://www.cnbc.com/2018/05/14/rising-oil-prices-may-now-be-a-positive-for-the-us-economy.html)
for the U.S. economy. Furthermore[, because Iranian oil purchases run
through the sanctioned Central Bank of Iran, the People's Bank of China
(PBoC) would be subject to U.S. secondary sanctions. The PBoC could
respond with a raft of asymmetrical options for retaliation, including
devaluing the renminbi, targeting U.S. companies with retaliatory
regulations, or the nuclear option]{.underline}---selling some of its
\$1.2 trillion in government-held U.S. treasury bonds. Already, broader
trade tensions and the threatened imposition of tariffs on [U.S. oil
imports](https://www.cnbc.com/2018/08/15/reuters-america-chinese-oil-importers-shun-u-s-crude-despite-tariff-reversal.html)
earlier this month have discouraged Chinese purchasers from buying U.S.
crude. Considering the factors at play, the November secondary sanctions
deadline could become a flashpoint for further tensions. [Economic
engagement and security relationships are key facets of China's
engagement with the Arab Gulf states. China tries to leverage business
to balance tensions between Saudi Arabia and Iran.]{.underline} For
example, [China overtook the United States as Saudi Arabia's largest
trading partner in 2017, making it the key trade leader with both Iran
and Saudi Arabia.]{.underline} In 2017, Saudi Arabia's King Salman
signed [\$65
billion-worth](https://thediplomat.com/2017/03/saudi-arabia-pivots-to-asia-for-now/)
of memorandums of understanding in Beijing, and the two countries began
implementing agreements in petrochemical, technology, and other sectors.
Moreover, Saudi Arabia also [courted
China](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-saudi-aramco-ipo/in-aramco-ipo-china-talks-crucial-for-choice-of-listing-venue-sources-idUSKBN1FL5BW)as

led China to decrease its Saudi crude imports in 2018. China is wary of
veering too closely to Saudi Arabia or Iran at the risk of alienating
the other, and one fundamental question will be whether the Chinese
build on already high rates of cross-investment with the kingdom as
secondary sanctions against Iran are re-imposed. Chinese diplomats have
tried to draw linkages between the BRI and Vision 2030 plans, although
concerns over opaque Saudi government regulation may limit Saudi-Chinese
cooperation. Also, the Trump administration's apparent willingness to
broach a [nuclear
deal](https://www.vox.com/world/2018/3/26/17144446/saud-arabia-nuclear-weapons-trump-iran-deal)
with the kingdom also may have created a leverage point in America's
favor. [Beyond Saudi Arabia, Beijing pledged \$23 billion in development
aid to the region during the China Arab States Cooperation
Forum.]{.underline} Chinese president Xi also visited the United Arab
Emirates last month to discuss economic cooperation and regional
security. This is because [as much as]{.underline} [[60
percent](http://www.arabnews.com/node/1347531) of China's]{.underline}
[[trade with Europe and
Africa](https://www.huffingtonpost.com/muhammad-zulfikar-rakhmat/the-uae-and-chinas-thrivi_b_7821640.html)
passes through the UAE.]{.underline} Additionally, [China's relations
with the Gulf states are economically promising and could suggest a
**growing acceptance of Beijing's influence**]{.underline}. [Militarily,
the Chinese have recently increased naval patrols near the Gulfs of Oman
and Aden. Beijing has also established a base in Djibouti with an eye to
protecting business and trade interests in the area and perhaps a
longer-term military buildup. China could also play a constructive role
in maritime missions]{.underline} like counter-piracy or anti-smuggling,
although the United States and its naval forces at CENTCOM will surely
be monitoring developments closely. However, Beijing's willingness to
deal with Tehran may prove problematic for cooperation in the security
sphere, even as China ramps up its regional military presence. China's
relationship with Iran has prevented it from getting as close to Arab
states as is necessary to pose a challenge to the United States as the
region's dominant security force. So long as Beijing remains close to
Tehran, it is unlikely Saudi Arabia and the Gulf will turn to China for
more than occasional purchases of drones, special ops gear, and other
military hardware in the short-term. Russia's role as another external
power in the region vis-a-vis China is also worth examining. Moscow
seized the great power driver's seat in Syria, where it has attempted to
de-escalate tensions between Israel, Iran, its proxies, and the Assad
regime along the country's southwestern border. Its success in that
endeavor has been questionable, but Putin's supposed mediation between
the Iranians and Israelis has become a Kremlin talking point. China has
acted largely in concert with Russia in Syria, continuing to support
Syrian President Bashar al-Assad and engaging in diplomatic
obstructionism against intervention at the United Nations since the
civil war's early days. While [China could potentially play a
significant role in Syria's reconstruction]{.underline}, it remains
unclear if Beijing is [willing to do
so](https://thediplomat.com/2018/07/china-and-the-reconstruction-of-syria/).
[China and Russia's support for Iran is likely to remain within
limits]{.underline}---it's unclear whether either country would
genuinely support Iran\'s admittance to the Shanghai Cooperation
Organization, for example---[but **Tehran policy will remain a lever for
both countries** to push should they want to pester
America.]{.underline} The BRI will prove an interesting space to observe
broader Russian-Chinese dynamics. [China's infrastructure investment
around the energy sector could bolster Iran's ability to export
liquified natural gas with the exit of European companies]{.underline},
though secondary sanctions will hamper Iran's prospects for entering
European markets. Russia is satisfied with this status quo and will try
to keep Iran's LNG flowing eastward to maintain its stranglehold over
Europe. This arrangement ostensibly suits both Moscow and Beijing. At
the same time, however, China is using Iran to develop BRI routes that
circumvent Russian territory, leaving Russia in the cold for some of the
Belt and Road benefits. There are several takeaways for the United
States. [Iran's political factions are likely to converge under the
Trump administration's]{.underline}
[[rhetorical](http://www.atlanticcouncil.org/blogs/iransource/trump-s-twitter-war-unites-iranian-factions-and-bolsters-rouhani)
and]{.underline}
[[financial](http://www.atlanticcouncil.org/blogs/iransource/tehran-struggles-with-terrorism-financing-bill)
assaults, and continuing support from **China could undermine the
overarching U.S. policy goal of containing Iran's efforts to exert its
influence in the region.** Though U.S. Iran policy, among other factors,
may draw support from like-minded regional partners,]{.underline}
[America may risk escalating economic conflicts with China as the price
of re-imposing secondary sanctions]{.underline}. From a strategic
perspective, America must also consider whether removing Iran as an
alternative source of energy---in particular, natural gas---for Europe
actually benefits Russia and hinders the objective of uniting European
allies against the Kremlin. Given Washington's focus on the Indo-Pacific
as the primary theater of both economic opportunity and tomorrow's great
power conflicts, the Trump administration may need to [ask itself if
this is the fight with China that it wants to pick.]{.underline}

Attention is now shifting to the Pacific, as China, the peer competitor,
is not flinching over its South China Sea expansion[. The People's
Liberation Army (PLA) Navy is planning to build four carrier battle
groups, and is targeting American aircraft carriers with new
ship-busting nuclear-tipped ballistic missiles. China's high-tech naval
railguns and hypersonic cruise missiles are just around the corner. The
security of the Middle East and its energy supplies will be defined in
the next two decades by the balance of military and economic power
between the U.S., China, and Russia. Within the region, the
confrontation between Saudi Arabia and the UAE vs. Iran and Qatar will
take center stage.]{.underline} Some Chinese participants at the
Singapore conference, such as Prof. Wang Suolao of Institute of Area
Studies in Beijing University, tried to deny that China is playing
geopolitics in the Middle East. However, one cannot help but analyze the
region through the prisms of political interests, spheres of influence,
proxy management, and exclusive economic zones. [China already maintains
a sizeable military base in Djibouti, at Bab-el-Mandeb, the entrance to
the strategically important Red Sea, which leads to Suez Canal, one of
the three principal choke points of global naval routes (the others

mobile payment tech which would allow 85 million "unbanked" people in
the Middle East to integrate in business and financial activities; the

### China Bad -- Saudi Prolif

#### Increasing Chinese regional influence causes Saudi Arabia to proliferate 

**Dorsey 7/10/19** (James - a senior fellow at the S. Rajaratnam School
of International Studies and an award-winning journalist; \"Middle East:
Towards a Nuclear Arms Race,\" Globalist; 7-10-2019;
<https://www.theglobalist.com/us-iran-saudi-arabia-nuclear-weapons-jcpoa/>;
Accessed 7/28/19)

The Middle East is barreling towards a nuclear and ballistic missiles
arms race. The race is being aided and abetted by a schizophrenic U.S.
policy that, on the one hand, focuses on Iran (and the need to stop the
country in its tracks) and, on the other hand, primarily views Saudi
Arabia as a lucrative market for the U.S. defense and nuclear industry.
The race is further enabled by the inability or unwillingness of other
major powers -- Europe, Russia and China -- to counter crippling U.S.
sanctions against Iran in ways that would ensure that Tehran maintains
an interest in adhering to the 2015 international agreement that curbed
the Iranian nuclear program despite last year's U.S. withdrawal from the
deal. With the Middle East teetering on the brink of a military
confrontation, Iran has vowed to start breaching the agreement if the
international community, and particularly Europe, fails to shield it
against U.S. sanctions. Former International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)
deputy director general Olli Heinonen, a hard-liner when it comes to
Iran, asserted recently during a visit to Israel that Iran would need
six to eight months to enrich uranium in the quantity and quality
required to produce a nuclear bomb. U.S. and Chinese willingness to
lower safeguards in their nuclear dealings with Saudi Arabia further
fuel Iranian doubts about the value of the nuclear agreement and
potentially open the door to a nuclear arms race in the Middle East. In
a wide-ranging interview with NBC News, Donald Trump recently elaborated
on the prism through which he approaches the Middle East. The president
deflected calls for an FBI investigation into last October's murder by
Saudi government agents of journalist Jamal Khashoggi in the kingdom's
consulate in Istanbul. "Iran's killed many, many people a day. Other
countries in the Middle East ― this is a hostile place. This is a
vicious, hostile place. If you're going to look at Saudi Arabia, look at
Iran, look at other countries," Mr. Trump said, suggesting that crimes
by one country provide license to others. Asked whether Saudi arms
purchases was reason to let Saudi Arabia off the hook, Mr. Trump
responded: "No, no. But [I'm not like a fool that says, 'We don't want
to do business with them.' And by the way, if they don't do business
with us, you know what they do? They'll do business with the Russians or
with the Chinese."]{.underline} Europe has so far unsuccessfully sought
to put in place an effective mechanism that would allow European and
potentially non-European companies that do business with Iran to
circumvent U.S. sanctions unscathed. As the United States prepared to
announce new sanctions, Russia said it would help Iran with oil exports
and its banking sector if the European mechanism failed to get off the
ground but offered no details. While countering the sanctions is Iran's
immediate priority, Saudi moves, with the help of the Trump
administration as well as China, are likely to enhance Iranian
questioning of the nuclear accord's value. The country is keen to put in
place the building blocks for a nuclear industry that could develop a
military component and a ballistic missiles capability. [Trump's
argument that Russia and China would fill America's shoes if the United
States refused to sell arms and technology to Saudi Arabia is not wholly
without merit,]{.underline} even if it fails to justify a lack of
safeguards in the provision of nuclear technology to the kingdom. [For
example, when the United States refused to share its most advanced drone
technology, China opened in 2017 its first overseas defense production
facility in Saudi Arabia. State-owned China Aerospace Science and
Technology Corporation (CASC) is manufacturing its CH-4 Caihong, or
Rainbow drone, as well as associated equipment in Saudi Arabia. The CH-4
is comparable to the armed U.S. MQ-9 Reaper drone]{.underline}.
Satellite images discovered by the Middlebury Institute of International
Studies and confirmed by [U.S. intelligence show that Saudi Arabia has
significantly escalated its ballistic missile program with the help of
China. The missile program runs counter to U.S. policy that for decades
sought to ensure that Saudi Arabia had air supremacy in the region, so
that it wouldn't seek to go around the United States to upgrade its
missile capabilities. The program that started in the late 1980s with
Saudi Arabia's first clandestine missile purchases from China suggests
that the kingdom, uncertain about the reliability of the United Sates,
is increasingly hedging its bets]{.underline}. Saudi development of a
ballistic missile capability significantly dims any prospect of Iran
agreeing to limit its missile program -- a key demand put forward by the
Trump administration. [in 2017 Saudi Arabia signed a nuclear energy
cooperation agreement with China that included a feasibility study for
the construction of high-temperature gas-cooled (HTGR) nuclear power
plants in the kingdom as well as cooperation in intellectual property
and the development of a domestic industrial supply chain for HTGRs
built in Saudi Arabia]{.underline}. [The HTGR agreement built on an
accord signed in 2012 that involved maintenance and development of
nuclear power plants and research reactors, as well as the provision of
Chinese nuclear fuel. The Washington-based Institute for Science and
International Security (ISIS) warned at the time that the 2015 Iran
nuclear agreement had "not eliminated the kingdom's desire for nuclear
weapons capabilities and even nuclear weapons.]{.underline}" The Trump
administration, eager to corner a deal for the acquisition of designs
for nuclear power plants, a contract valued at up to \$80 billion
depending on how many Saudi Arabia ultimately decides to build, has
approved several nuclear technology transfers to the kingdom. It has
also approved licences for six U.S. firms to sell atomic power
technology to Saudi Arabia. Saudi Arabia is nearing completion of its
first atomic reactor in the King Abdulaziz City for Science and
Technology near Riyadh. A signatory of the nuclear Non-Proliferation
Treaty (NPT), Saudi Arabia has ignored calls by the IAEA, to implement
proportionate safeguards and an inspection regime that would ensure that
it does not move towards development of a nuclear military capability.
"Saudi Arabia is currently subject to less intrusive monitoring by
international inspectors because Riyadh concluded what is known as a
small quantities protocol with the agency. The small quantities protocol
was designed to simplify safeguards for states with minimal or no
nuclear material, but it is no longer adequate for Saudi Arabia's
expanding nuclear program," Kelsey Davenport, director of
Non-proliferation Policy at the Arms Control Association, told Middle
East Eye. Ms. Davenport warned that "given these factors, there are
legitimate reasons to be concerned that [Saudi Arabia is seeking to
develop the technical capabilities that would allow Riyadh to quickly
pursue nuclear weapons if the political decision were made to do
so]{.underline}."

#### Drones set the brink -- china fill in causes prolif 

**Zhen 18** (Liu - joined the Post in 2015 as a reporter on the China
desk. She previously worked with Reuters in Beijing; \"Chinese military
drones fill gap in Middle East market, report says,\" South China
Morning Post; 12/18/18;

Accessed 7/28/19)

[China plays a significant role in the supply of military drones to
Middle East countries, especially those that are barred from importing
them from the United States]{.underline}, a British think tank has said.
[The Royal United Services Institute said in a report that China has
filled a void left by the US, which has become more selective about
exporting armed drones and related technologies to the
region]{.underline}. "[China has often been described as a
no-questions-asked exporter of drones, has played and is likely to
continue playing a key role as a supplier of armed UAVs to the Middle
East]{.underline}," the report said. The only two rules Beijing follows
are dealing only with state actors and prioritising usage for
counterterrorism purposes, it said. China has sold advanced armed drones
to several Middle Eastern countries, including Jordan, Iraq, Saudi
Arabia and the United Arab Emirates, on the grounds they will be used to
combat terrorism, the report said. [Beijing has stated on more than one
occasion that it does not take sides on conflicts in the region. All
countries are therefore potential clients]{.underline}. China is not a
signatory to the Missile Technology Control Regime, an international
treaty signed in 1987 that seeks to control the sale of weapons such as
missiles and armed unmanned aerial vehicles. For example, it restricts
the sale of missiles and related technologies that are capable of
carrying a 500kg (1,100lb) payload for 300km (186 miles) or more. China
applied to join the treaty in 2004 but was rejected. It has since
pledged to voluntarily abide by its rules. But military experts have
said that some armed drones fall into a grey area under the agreement.
For example, the CH-4B Rainbow, a UAV manufactured by China Aerospace
Science and Technology Corp, has a range of just 150km if controlled
from the ground but more than 1,000km if fitted with a satellite
guidance function. It is not known if the company has ever sold Rainbow
drones with the enhanced capability to any of its clients. While US
drones are generally regarded as technologically superior to their
Chinese counterparts, buyers in the Middle East often do not have the
option to buy the former and the latter are significantly cheaper. Iraq,
for instance, bought at least four Rainbow drones from China in 2015
after failing to complete a deal on US-made MQ-1 Predator models.
According to reports by the Iraqi air force, as of the second half of
this year the drones had been used to carry out more than 260 strikes
against Islamic State. Similarly, the UAE bought two different models of
the Wing Loong drone manufactured by China's Chengdu Aircraft Industry
Group after it too failed to finalise a deal on Predators. The think

[As the Middle East becomes ever more unstable, a surprising victor may
be emerging: China.]{.underline} Under President Xi Jinping, [China has
accelerated its engagement with the Middle East --- a region Beijing
once treated as peripheral to its interests. Increased trade and
investment, invigorated diplomatic exchanges, and expanded military ties
are gradually transforming China's position in the Middle East. Unless
Washington can free its focus from the crises of the moment, Beijing may
realize its ambitions: a Middle East more squarely within its own
economic and diplomatic orbit, **where the United States remains
responsible for** addressing the **region's most intractable
challenges**.]{.underline} Oil has traditionally served as the glue
holding together America's relationships with key Arab states. Yet while
the United States has revitalized its domestic petroleum production
through the fracking revolution and
[reduced](https://www.eia.gov/tools/faqs/faq.php?id=32&t=6) its
dependence on foreign oil, China's energy imports from the region [have
surged](https://www.iea.org/newsroom/news/2018/february/weo-analysis-a-sea-change-in-the-global-oil-trade.html)
as the Middle East's demand for energy at home has grown[. Today, even
as Beijing seeks to
[diversify](https://www.forbes.com/sites/wadeshepard/2017/10/13/chinas-hunger-for-energy-resources-is-whats-driving-the-belt-and-road/2/#715c4b30496f)
its sources of foreign oil away from the region, it remains the among
the top three importers from [Saudi
Arabia,](https://www.eia.gov/beta/international/analysis.cfm?iso=SAU)
[Iraq](https://www.eia.gov/beta/international/analysis.cfm?iso=IRQ), and
[Iran](https://www.eia.gov/beta/international/analysis.cfm?iso=IRN).
China's appetite for Middle Eastern energy is creating the conditions
for economic interdependence that mirrors the ties that have bound the
United States to Saudi Arabia and other Gulf countries. This
co-dependency **runs the risk of curbing U.S. influence** and rendering
key Arab states more susceptible to Chinese demands.]{.underline}
Indeed, Beijing has not shied away from using its leverage as a leading
energy importer --- in a recent example, it
[threatened](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-05-03/oil-pricing-skirmish-between-saudis-and-chinese-trader-continues)
to scale back oil imports from Saudi Arabia over a pricing dispute.
Beyond energy trade, [China's economic influence across the Middle East
has expanded through its investment.]{.underline} Arab countries, eager
to reduce their dependency on oil exports and diversify their economies
through creating new industries, are welcoming Chinese investment. Saudi
Arabia and Jordan are both in discussions with Beijing to harmonize
their development plans with the Belt and Road Initiative --- Xi's
signature piece of economic statecraft. [In the case of Saudi Arabia,
this alignment of strategic visions has translated into a strong
commercial signing package during King Salman's March 2017 state visit
to Beijing,

\$65 billion of bilateral agreements in the oil, space, and renewable
energy sectors.]{.underline} Additionally, [Egyptian
[collaboration](http://www.xinhuanet.com/english/2017-03/16/c_136134254.htm)
with China on a new Suez Canal cooperation zone is

featuring an oil refinery capable of processing 235,000 barrels per day.
In positioning its engagement with the Middle East as purely commercial
in nature, China has enhanced its economic relations with the Arab
states without endangering its similarly growing ties with Israel and
Iran. In Israel, China has invested in [ports and

and it has become a [[growing
player](https://www.cnbc.com/2017/07/18/china-is-increasingly-becoming-key-for-israels-high-tech-industry.html)
in the Israeli high-tech sector]{.underline}. [At a time when the United
States and its allies in Europe, Australia, and Japan increasingly
regard Chinese investment as a threat to their long-term innovation
edge, Israel, without taking appropriate precautions, could become a
backdoor for China to obtain the technology it needs to realize its
[ambitions](http://www.cittadellascienza.it/cina/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/IoT-ONE-Made-in-China-2025.pdf)
to dominate the critical industries of the 21st century. China's
economic relationship with Iran]{.underline}, for which it is the [No. 1
trading
partner](http://ec.europa.eu/trade/policy/countries-and-regions/countries/iran/),
[has continued to deepen]{.underline}. As European firms fretted last
year about a return of U.S. sanctions under President Donald Trump,
Chinese state-owned investment arm CITIC Group established a [\$10

[exceeded](https://moderndiplomacy.eu/2018/03/20/belt-and-road-initiative-and-china-iran-cooperation/)

from the Iran nuclear deal and the [threat of new

puts all foreign companies under growing pressure to scale down their

Beijing from continuing to enhance its trade and investment relationship
with Tehran, which will --- as it did prior to the nuclear deal --- have
few alternatives to China going forward]{.underline}. China's burgeoning
ties with the Middle East --- though still primarily economic --- are
not limited to commercial and financial activity. [Xi is augmenting the
country's economic gains with diplomatic exchanges]{.underline}, notably
his January 2016 tour of Saudi Arabia, Egypt, and Iran. Xi subsequently
welcomed Saudi Arabia's King Salman and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu to Beijing for official visits[. China has also demonstrated a
new, if cautious, willingness to make forays into some of the region's
disputes.]{.underline} For example, Beijing has given the Bashar
al-Assad regime and its patron in Moscow [diplomatic
backing](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/worldviews/wp/2017/03/12/bashar-al-assad-says-relations-between-syria-and-china-are-on-the-rise/?utm_term=.6bde0470744d)
as well as [consistent
support](http://www.globaltimes.cn/content/1098220.shtml)in the Chinese
media. Beijing has also hosted Israelis and Palestinians for a [Peace
Symposium.](https://thediplomat.com/2017/12/china-vows-to-play-an-active-role-in-settling-the-palestine-israel-issue/)
Although it is unlikely that China will ever play a prominent role as a
mediator in either of these crises, its increasing willingness to wade
into divisive regional issues demonstrates Beijing's changing perception
of its role in the region. Beyond these diplomatic overtures, [China has
ramped up its military engagement across the Middle East]{.underline}.
The Chinese navy has made efforts to demonstrate its presence in the
vicinity of strategic chokepoints such as the Strait of Hormuz, the Bab
el-Mandeb strait, and the Suez Canal. Since 2010, the navy has conducted
[port
calls](https://news.usni.org/2014/10/27/china-iran-deepening-naval-ties-iran-calls-bilateral-blue-water-exercise)
in every nation in the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC), Egypt, Israel,
and Iran. In June 2017, China and Iran conducted a [joint naval
exercise](http://www.scmp.com/news/china/diplomacy-defence/article/2098898/china-and-iran-carry-out-naval-exercise-near-strait)
on the fringe of the Strait of Hormuz. Building on port visits and
exercises, and leveraging dual-use infrastructure created by its
regional investments, China could ultimately seek to obtain military
access in the region --- much as it did in nearby
[Djibouti](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/02/25/world/africa/us-djibouti-chinese-naval-base.html).
China has also emerged as a boutique source of armaments for the Middle
East, given its willingness to supply military-grade unmanned aerial
vehicles (UAVs) that until [very
recently](https://www.defensenews.com/news/pentagon-congress/2018/04/19/trump-admin-rolls-out-new-rules-for-weapon-drone-sales-abroad/?utm_medium=Socialflow&utm_source=Twitter)
were subject to U.S. export controls. Preliminary open-source satellite
imagery indicates that China recently [sold such
UAVs](https://thediplomat.com/2018/01/is-the-uae-secretly-buying-chinese-killer-drones/)
to the United Arab Emirates. [Reporting from
Yemen](http://foreignpolicy.com/2018/04/27/drone-wars-how-the-uaes-chinese-made-drone-is-changing-the-war-in-yemen/)
indicates that these drones are being actively employed in the ongoing
campaign to eliminate prominent Houthi leaders. Moreover, [China has
[reportedly](https://www.defensenews.com/air/2017/03/28/china-to-open-a-drone-factory-in-saudi-arabia/)
inked an agreement to open a new facility in Saudi Arabia to manufacture
military drones.]{.underline} Although China has little hope of
displacing the United States as the region's preeminent arms supplier,
[military sales to the Middle East [generate new
markets](https://www.mmtimes.com/news/strategic-contours-chinas-arms-sales.html)
for China's low-cost, high-tech weapons systems, which further
incentivize Chinese indigenous research, development, and production.
And China's [willingness to
sell](http://www.scmp.com/news/china/diplomacy-defence/article/2134680/chinese-military-drone-display-united-arab-emirates)
weapons to nearly any actor, regardless of its intentions, could
**exacerbate regional conflicts** by providing countries with the
**means to wage war at attractive prices**.]{.underline} Now is the time
for the United States to engage key regional allies and partners on
China's growing involvement in the Middle East. This can start by
debunking Beijing's narrative that it is a purely commercial actor
without a geopolitical agenda. The Trump administration should, in
particular, publicly and privately highlight to the GCC members and
Israel the nature of China's relationship with Iran, which has too often
remained overlooked. The United States should also have a quiet --- and
candid --- dialogue with Israel on the challenges posed by China's
investment in its high-tech sector, and it should work to align their
screening processes. In the economic domain, the United States need not
match the level of Chinese trade and investment. But it must advance a
positive vision for the Middle East. This could take the form of a new
infrastructure initiative in partnership with Saudi Arabia and the UAE,
U.S. allies that are keen to play the role of hubs linking the region
both internally and to Africa and the Indian Ocean. With many countries
in the Middle East eager to diversify their sources of domestic energy
production away from fossil fuels, the United States should consider a
regional energy agenda premised on efficiency and the use of renewables.
On both infrastructure and energy, Japan, which ranks among the top five
export destinations for all GCC countries, could play a pivotal --- and
reinforcing --- role in counterbalancing China's regional economic
influence. Finally, the United States should continue pressing China to
expand the Belt and Road Initiative to countries in need of
reconstruction assistance, such as Iraq, Syria, and Yemen. Washington
should be unafraid of comparing the hypocrisy of Xi's "community with
shared future for mankind" with Beijing's tepid interest in
post-conflict reconstruction efforts. [With tensions roiling the Middle
East, it would be easy for the United States to simply ignore China's
quiet power play. But that would be a mistake --- one that will enable
Beijing to continue to capitalize on economic opportunities across the
region and solidify its diplomatic influence while **leaving Washington
to carry the burden of crisis management.**]{.underline}

"Future Calling: Infrastructure Investment in Central Asia". Throughout
the conference, participants and attendees kept coming back to the same
critical question: [If the U.S. is slowly disengaging from the Middle
East, **will China** necessarily **fill the void**]{.underline}? **[The
answer is a qualified yes]{.underline}**. First, because the [Belt and
Road Initiative (BRI) is the most ambitious geopolitical and
geo-economic program since the Marshall Plan, and surpasses it in scope
and costs.]{.underline} The Marshall Plan dealt with the rebuilding of
Europe only, while the U.S. also helped raising Japan from the ashes of
World War II. [It was limited in time to four years. Belt and Road,
proclaimed by Chairman Xi Jinping in 2013, involves over 80 countries in
Eurasia, Europe, South and Southeast Asia, the Middle East and Africa.
Middle East energy will be the lifeblood of BRI, with China its engine
and brain.]{.underline} [Western Europe and the developing world will be
its market. The United States so far failed to offer a comprehensive,
strategic response to Belt and Road, which would need to include an
economic, cultural and human dimension.]{.underline} Instead, under both
the Obama and the Trump Administration, [Washington is sticking to
mostly military answers]{.underline}, while [ipso facto creating an
anti-American block that includes Russia and China]{.underline} --
something Henry Kissinger
[warned](http://www3.nccu.edu.tw/~lorenzo/Goh%20Soviet%20Card%20Opening%20to%20China.pdf)
against over 40 years ago. Second, Beijing is aggressively bolstering
its Near East presence. China is already building strategic partnerships
with countries from Algeria to Saudi Arabia to Iran, Iraq, and the UAE.
It is targeting major OPEC and Gulf Cooperation Council members, while
also focusing on U.S. allies, like Israel, Jordan, Qatar, and Egypt.
Following World War II, the British Lion [went

in Iraq and Afghanistan, the American Eagle wants a respite. Vital
national interests of the U.S., chief among them energy, are no longer
bound to the Middle East region due to the shale gale.]{.underline}
Attention is now shifting to the Pacific, as China, the peer competitor,
is [not
flinching](https://www.cfr.org/report/exposing-chinas-actions-south-china-sea)
over its South China Sea expansion. The People's Liberation Army (PLA)
Navy is
[planning](https://foxtrotalpha.jalopnik.com/inside-china-s-plan-to-build-the-second-biggest-aircraf-1828730033)
to build four carrier battle groups, and is targeting American aircraft
carriers with new ship-busting nuclear-tipped ballistic missiles.
China's high-tech naval railguns and [hypersonic cruise
missiles](https://nationalinterest.org/blog/buzz/can-americas-military-match-chinas-hypersonic-weapons-33656)
are just around the corner. The [security of the Middle East and its
energy supplies will be defined in the next two decades by the balance
of military and economic power between the U.S., China, and
Russia.]{.underline} Within the region, the confrontation between Saudi
Arabia and the UAE vs. Iran and Qatar will take center stage. Some
Chinese participants at the Singapore conference, such as Prof. [Wang
Suolao of Institute of Area Studies in Beijing University, tried to deny
that China is playing geopolitics in the Middle East. However, one
cannot help but analyze the region through the prisms of political
interests, spheres of influence, proxy management, and exclusive
economic zones.]{.underline} China already maintains a sizeable military
base in Djibouti, at Bab-el-Mandeb, the entrance to the strategically
important Red Sea, which leads to Suez Canal, one of the three principal
choke points of global naval routes (the others being the Strait of
Malacca, and the Panama Canal). Djibouti is also home to an American
Naval Expeditionary Base, Camp Lemonnier, just 11 kilometers away. The
two opposing bases present a fitting metaphor of competing national
interests on the African continent. Chinese and American forces have
even engaged in [laser
skirmishes](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/checkpoint/wp/2018/05/03/u-s-accuses-china-of-directing-blinding-lasers-at-american-military-aircraft-in-djibouti/?utm_term=.eb78e10180e0)
there, where China deployed high energy lasers to blind U.S. pilots.
This is just a telltale symptom of things to come. [China is deploying
its economic and diplomatic power in the Middle East first, while the
military involvement may come later: the launch of the petro-yuan, which
will exclude the dollar; massive Chinese advantage in mobile payment
tech which would allow 85 million "unbanked" people in the Middle East
to integrate in business and financial activities; the growth of Chinese
tourism to the Gulf; the involvement of Chinese Muslim communities with
the Middle Eas]{.underline}t -- all discussed at the Singapore
conference in great detail. These [will be the tools used by **Beijing
to expand its influence from Morocco to Muscat** -- **and
beyond**]{.underline}. The forum, led by the NUS Middle East Institute
Chairman Bilahari Kausikan, highlighted the tremendous opportunities and
risks facing Asian (including Singaporean) investments in the Middle
East. Experts view pragmatic approaches to industrialization and
investment, including in new areas beyond oil and gas, as key. This also
applies to political instruments in resolving simmering hostilities, and
furthering broad cooperation in fighting religious extremism of both the
Sunni and Shia variety. Hydrocarbons, the bread and butter of the Middle
East for the past 100 years, may become a stranded resource in just a
few decades. Soon, it could be infrastructure, renewables, IT, AI,
robotics, high tech, and services that drive the region's economic
development. [The U.S. has not yet lost-out to China in the Middle East,
but American and European businesses -- and strategic planners -- **will
need to work twice as hard to stay competitive.**]{.underline}

Additionally, Egyptian collaboration with China on a new Suez Canal
cooperation zone is underway. In Duqm, Oman, Chinese capital inflows
transformed a backwater fishing village into a \$10.7 billion "Sino-Oman
Industrial City" featuring an oil refinery capable of processing 235,000
barrels per day. In positioning its engagement with the Middle East as
purely commercial in nature, China has enhanced its economic relations
with the Arab states without endangering its similarly growing ties with
Israel and Iran. In Israel, China has invested in ports and railways,
and it has become a growing player in the Israeli high-tech sector. At a

Japan increasingly regard Chinese investment as a threat to their
long-term innovation edge, Israel, without taking appropriate
precautions, could become a backdoor for China to obtain the technology
it needs to realize its ambitions to dominate the critical industries of
the 21st century. [China's economic relationship with Iran, for which it
is the No. 1 trading partner, has continued to deepen]{.underline}. As
European firms fretted last year about a return of U.S. sanctions under
President Donald Trump, Chinese state-owned investment arm CITIC Group
established a \$10 billion credit line for Iran. In 2017, [China-Iran
trade exceeded \$37 billion, with year-on-year growth of 19 percent.
U.S. withdrawal from the Iran nuclear deal and the threat of new
sanctions puts all foreign companies under growing pressure to scale
down their presence in Iran. Yet the specter of sanctions does not
appear to have dissuaded Beijing from continuing to enhance its trade
and investment relationship with Tehran, which will --- as it did prior
to the nuclear deal --- have few alternatives to China going
forward]{.underline}. China's burgeoning ties with the Middle East ---
though still primarily economic --- are not limited to commercial and

backing as well as consistent support in the Chinese media. Beijing has
also hosted Israelis and Palestinians for a Peace Symposium. Although it
is unlikely that China will ever play a prominent role as a mediator in

indigenous research, development, and production. And China's
willingness to sell weapons to nearly any actor, regardless of its
intentions, could exacerbate regional conflicts by providing countries
with the means to wage war at attractive prices.]{.underline} Now is the
time for the United States to engage key regional allies and partners on
China's growing involvement in the Middle East. This can start by
debunking Beijing's narrative that it is a purely commercial actor
without a geopolitical agenda. The Trump administration should, in
particular, publicly and privately highlight to the GCC members and
Israel the nature of China's relationship with Iran, which has too often
remained overlooked. The United States should also have a quiet --- and
candid --- dialogue with Israel on the challenges posed by China's
investment in its high-tech sector, and it should work to align their
screening processes. In the economic domain, the United States need not
match the level of Chinese trade and investment. But it must advance a
positive vision for the Middle East. This could take the form of a new
infrastructure initiative in partnership with Saudi Arabia and the UAE,
U.S. allies that are keen to play the role of hubs linking the region
both internally and to Africa and the Indian Ocean. With many countries
in the Middle East eager to diversify their sources of domestic energy
production away from fossil fuels, the United States should consider a
regional energy agenda premised on efficiency and the use of renewables.
On both infrastructure and energy, Japan, which ranks among the top five
export destinations for all GCC countries, could play a pivotal --- and
reinforcing --- role in counterbalancing China's regional economic
influence. Finally, the United States should continue pressing China to
expand the Belt and Road Initiative to countries in need of
reconstruction assistance, such as Iraq, Syria, and Yemen. Washington
should be unafraid of comparing the hypocrisy of Xi's "community with
shared future for mankind" with Beijing's tepid interest in
post-conflict reconstruction efforts. With tensions roiling the Middle
East, it would be easy for the United States to simply ignore China's
quiet power play. But that would be a mistake --- one that will enable
Beijing to continue to capitalize on economic opportunities across the
region and solidify its diplomatic influence while leaving Washington to
carry the burden of crisis management.

#### China risks Middle East stability with its economic policy

Accessed 7/28/19; Katie)

[China is making a risky bet in the Middle East]{.underline}. By
focusing on economic development and adhering to the principle of
noninterference in internal affairs, [Beijing believes it can deepen
relations with countries that are otherwise nearly at war with one
another---all the while avoiding any significant role in the political
affairs of the regio]{.underline}n. [This is likely to prove
naive]{.underline}, particularly if U.S. allies begin to stand up for
their interests. In meetings I attended earlier this month in Beijing on
China's position in the Middle East, sponsored by the Carnegie-Tsinghua
Center, [Chinese officials, academics, and business leaders expressed a
common view that China can avoid political entanglement]{.underline} by
promoting development from Tehran to Tel Aviv. [China may soon
find]{.underline}, however, [that its purely transactional approach is
unsustainable in this intractable region]{.underline}---placing its own
investments at risk and opening new opportunities for the United States.
Over the past three years, Chi[na has charted an ambitious future in the
Middle East by forging "comprehensive strategic partnerships" with Iran,
the United Arab Emirates, Saudi Arabia, and Egypt]{.underline}. This is
the highest level of diplomatic relations China can provide, and Beijing
believes these four countries anchor a neutral position that will prove
more stable over the long term than that of the United States. China has
also made massive investments in infrastructure throughout the region,
including in Israel, where [China is now the second-largest trading
partner behind the United States. China's interests in the Middle East
are both structural and strategic. Structurally, China needs the natural
resources of the region, whereas the United States]{.underline}---now
the world's largest oil producer---[does not]{.underline}. China is also
seeking new markets to absorb its excess industrial capacity, and sees
the Middle East poised for growth after decades of wars, woeful
infrastructure, and popular discontent. Strategically, together with
Russia, [China is taking advantage of the uncertainty produced by
ever-shifting U.S. policies]{.underline}, including zero-sum
prescriptions for Iran and Syria that are unlikely to produce desired
outcomes anytime soon. Regional governments in turn have welcomed
China's embrace, and its offer of investment without pressure to
politically reform or respect human rights. China's President Xi Jinping
previewed this more assertive Middle East strategy in a landmark address
in Cairo three years ago. There, he declared that [China does not seek a
"sphere of influence" in the region]{.underline}---even while sinking
nearly \$100 billion in investments there through ports, roads, and rail
projects. He alleged China rejects "proxy" contests---even while
concluding a strategic partnership with Iran, the main sponsor of
proxies in the region. And he warned against "all forms of
discrimination and prejudice against any specific ethnic group and
religion"---even while reportedly forcing 1 million Muslims into
reeducation camps in China's Xinjiang province. Such [contradictions can
be maintained only so long as traditional U.S. allies in the
region]{.underline} now welcoming Chinese investment [allow them to be
maintained]{.underline}. These U.S. allies do not shy from asserting
their broader interests with Washington or expressing disagreement where
policies diverge, and it is time they do the same with Beijing. [As the
United States questions Chinese investment and intentions]{.underline},
particularly in the areas of technology and ports such as Israel's
Haifa, [it can also challenge traditional allies]{.underline} as to
whether they are granting China a free ride on what remains a largely
U.S.-led security architecture. [Such an arrangement should be as
unacceptable to American partners in the region as it is to
Washington]{.underline}. At the very least, these partners, together
with Washington, can demand that Beijing utilize its emerging
influence---particularly with Tehran and Damascus---to pursue measures
that promote longer-term stability. The [failure to support such
uncontroversial aims]{.underline}, by contrast, [would call into
question China's longer-term intentions as a benign power focused on
development.]{.underline}

What is one to make out of King Salman of Saudi Arabia recent trip to
Asia? The answer is the kingdom's worries about the economic and
security impact of the inevitable shift in global geopolitics. Though, I
am not surprised at this visit given the fact the kingdom is reassessing
its economic and security priorities to secure its interests, I found it
unusual that the Saudi king visits China before the United States,
though, it has been customary for the Saudi King to officially visit the
newly elected US president at the White House. Whether by design or
random coincidence, King Salman's visit to Asia-Pacific (Malaysia,
Indonesia, Brunei, Japan, China, the Maldives) came on the hills of his
son, Prince Mohammed Bin Salman's (third in line to the throne and
defense minister) visit to Washington recently and how the Prince made
it clear during his press statement that the desert kingdom is keeping
all its options open; whatever that means! [While King Salman's visit
to]{.underline} Tokyo, Japan resulted in a \$25 billion technology
venture with Japanese telecom giant Softbank, his visit to [China seems
to highlight the King's strategic thinking that is economically driven
and security oriented as Saudi Arabia and China signed economic ventures
worth \$65 billion.]{.underline} My analysis suggests that Saudi Arabia
is convinced that oil prices are not going back up to what they use to
be (over \$100/barrel) anytime soon; thus, the time is now to diversify
its economic assets. At the same time, this move will benefit China
given its ongoing growing demand for Saudi oil (while it is cheap on the
global market) in addition to increasing its footprints in the Middle
East as Beijing bids to connect China to Europe through infrastructure
developments in the desert Kingdom. It is pivotal that we place King
Salman's visit to Asia-Pacific within the context of current global
political climate: ongoing South China Sea tensions, North Korea nuclear
testing, US/South Korea's joint military exercises, ongoing civil war in
Syria, sudden rapprochement between Iran and Egypt and the ongoing proxy
war between Iran and Saudi Arabia in Yemen . [Equally important,
**having King Salman visits China first before the U.S. promotes China's
visibility and status on the global stage**. Similarly, King Salman's
visit reaffirms China's desire to increase its presence in the Middle
East as part of its quest for resources; thus, access to more markets
and increase of its global influence on a par with its economic
heft.]{.underline} [Recall Chinese president, Xi's speech last year
before the Arab league when he, indirectly, referred to American
presence in the Middle East as diminishing and that China could be seen
as the alternative. Yet, economic ventures are not the only factor that
drives China-Saudi Arabia relations, security ties seem to grow even
more significantly. Of interest is how Saudi Arabia's Air Force is
deploying Chinese unmanned attack drones.]{.underline} Also, the Chinese
and Saudi militaries are currently holding joint counter-terrorism
exercises in western China; exercises the kingdom use to conduct mainly
with the US military. In a show of growing military ties, Chinese navy
vessels have also visited the Saudi port of Jeddah as part of
increasingly active maneuvers in the Gulf of Aden. [While China might be
perceived as the new comer to the Middle East, its strategy is perfectly
aligned with its long-term objectives. Its presence is felt militarily
(agreements with both Iran and Saudi Arabia), economically (oil
refineries contracts worth \$10 billion with Saudi Arabia) and
strategically (resetting the Middle East geopolitical table in
coordination with Russia and Iran).]{.underline} Mind you that despite
the ongoing conflicts in the region, Beijing has thus far managed to
maintain and pursue a policy of "neutrality" keeping friendly ties with
all parties despite sometimes conflicting geopolitical interests.

ABU DHABI---[**Russia and China are stepping up their efforts to woo
Persian Gulf arms buyers**, encroaching on a market long dominated by
the U.S. and Europe and raising security concerns in Washington. The
market is crucial for the global defense industry, with Saudi Arabia's
\$7.7 billion in 2018 deals making it the Mideast's top arms buyer, and
the United Arab Emirates and Qatar also in the world\'s top 10,
according to market-research firm IHS Markit. Saudi Arabia and the
U.A.E. spent \$40 million each on Chinese arms in 2018, according to the
Stockholm International Peace Research Institute, a nonprofit that
tracks global arms deals.]{.underline} That is still a small amount, but
a big jump over previous years. The U.A.E. also plans to develop weapons
with a Chinese company. Russia has sold missile systems to the U.A.E.
and military rifles to Saudi Arabia in return for the right to produce
the weapons in the kingdom. Saudi Arabia and the U.A.E. have also bought
Chinese military drones. [China and Russia are willing to sell arms and
equipment, such as drones, to some Mideast countries when other
countries are reluctant to do so because of weapons-proliferation
concerns, or, in the case of the U.S., a policy of giving its ally
Israel a military edge. The arms competition reflects growing tensions
between the U.S. and its strategic rivals China and Russia over trade,
security and other matters in a region the U.S. has long considered its
sphere of influence.]{.underline} The U.S. Department of Defense isn't
only concerned about the threat to U.S. arms sales but also that China
and Russia are trying to gain know-how about advanced military equipment
and commercial technologies by working with U.S. allies, Pentagon
officials said. These officials say the shift complicates future deals
with Washington's Persian Gulf allies since the competing hardware may
be incompatible with Western systems. [Russia and China have been laying
down both military and economic roots in the region. In the past couple
of years, China set up a military base in the East African nation of
Djibouti, across the Gulf of Aden from Yemen, in proximity to a U.S.
facility the Pentagon uses for sensitive military operations, including
drone strikes and special operations missions. Beijing has also pressed
for closer economic ties, hosting Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman
in February and announcing a flurry of agreements ranging across energy,
investment and counterterrorism.]{.underline} Last year Chinese
President Xi Jinping visited the U.A.E., signing 13 deals. "In terms of
technology \[the Chinese\] are incredibly good, and they have more
financial strength" than many rivals, said Alessandro Profumo, chief
executive of Italian aerospace and defense equipment maker Leonardo SpA,
which has sold combat aircraft and military helicopters in the Middle
East. Such strength allows China to offer flexible payment terms for its
customers, helping it to clinch deals particularly in less wealthy
countries. [Russia, the world's second-biggest arms exporter after the
U.S., has made its own push for influence in the Middle East following
its military action in Syria since 2015 to keep President Bashar
al-Assad in power. Russian oil companies like PAO Rosneft have struck
deals from Iraq to Libya, while Kremlin-connected firms have pushed for
Syrian reconstruction business.]{.underline} The Trump administration
has made arms sales to Persian Gulf allies, particularly Saudi Arabia, a
centerpiece of its foreign policy. President Trump has resisted U.S.
senators' calls to restrict arms transfers to Saudi Arabia following the
killing of journalist Jamal Khashoggi, which the Central Intelligence
Agency said was likely ordered by Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin
Salman. Saudi Arabia denies that. U.S. officials say they believe
American technology gives its contractors an edge in the region. They
have warned their Middle East allies not to become too enamored with the
Chinese and Russian partnerships, saying it could threaten cooperation
with the U.S. military, industry officials said. The pressure has had
mixed results. [Washington failed to persuade Turkey to abandon the
purchase of Russia's S-400 air- and missile-defense system. Its
manufacturer, Rostec State Corp., says it can shoot down aircraft at a
range of up to 240 miles. Saudi Arabia has held talks with Russia over
buying the system, too.]{.underline} Sergey Chemezov, Rostec's chief
executive, recently told reporters he wouldn't discuss the status of
those talks because of the pressure Washington has placed on prospective
buyers of Russia equipment. Representatives for Saudi Arabia didn't
respond to requests for comment. Mr. Chemezov said Rostec is in talks
with the U.A.E. about the company's new warship-based antiaircraft
system. China North Industries Group Corp., known as Norinco, meanwhile,
announced plans in February to join forces with U.A.E. defense company
International Golden Group PJSC to set up a research joint venture.
Financial terms of the deal weren't disclosed. Under the pact, the two
partners will open a facility in Abu Dhabi staffed by Chinese and
Emirati engineers. The program will develop weapons and training with
the help of Chinese and Emirati universities and in cooperation with the
U.A.E. armed forces. The center's first project will focus on drones
that can be used for both surveillance but also offensive purposes, an
Emirati official said.

## Impacts -- Iran

### Iran War -- US

#### An alliance with Saudi Arabia prevents a U.S.-Iran war

military issues for multiple outlets, "Arms sales to Saudi Arabia is the

The United States has been making a lot of big arms sales to Saudi
Arabia in recent years. [Recently]{.underline}, though, [[there has been
a push to halt the
sales](https://www.defensenews.com/congress/2019/06/20/us-senate-votes-to-kill-saudi-arms-sales-defying-trump-veto-threat/)
on a number of grounds, including the ongoing civil war in
Yemen]{.underline} (the Saudis are backing the Yemeni government against
Iranian-backed Houthi rebels) [and the murder of Jamal
Khashoggi.]{.underline} [Halting the arms sales would be a huge
mistake]{.underline}, and should the disapproval resolutions reach his
desk, President Trump should veto them. To be sure, the [Saudis, while
[making some moves in the right
direction](https://townhall.com/columnists/larryprovost/2018/10/24/khashoggi-writings-reveal-antisemitism-pro-shariaism-n2531301),
are not angels.]{.underline} [Khashoggi's murder was deliberate and
brutal. It should outrage people who value freedom of the press. But
cutting off arms sales and support for the Saudi efforts in Yemen would
be giving Iran]{.underline} a couple of [huge boosts]{.underline} just
[to say America owned the Saudis]{.underline} over Khashoggi in
particular and human rights in general. Yemen sits on the Bab el Mandeb,
a maritime choke point that is the southern entrance to the Red Sea. It
is, essentially, Israel's maritime back door. Aden, in the south, is
also a major port, used by the United Kingdom as a military base until
1967. [If the Houthis take control and drive out the government, it
means that the Iranian-sponsored rebels will have the ability to contest
passage through the Bab el Mandeb]{.underline}. They have already [fired
on an Arleigh Burke-class guided missile
destroyer](https://www.wearethemighty.com/articles/this-is-how-a-us-destroyer-just-dodged-2-missiles-off-the-yemen-coast)
on multiple occasions and [attacked a vessel that delivered humanitarian
aid](https://www.wearethemighty.com/articles/former-us-navy-vessel-attacked-by-yemeni-rebels-in-indian-ocean).
That doesn't even begin to touch Iran's record. Since 1979, [Iran has
taken Americans hostage, sponsored terrorist attacks, provided
insurgents in Iraq weapons that were used to kill American
servicemembers, and leaders of the regime have openly and repeatedly
expressed the desire to wipe Israel off the map.]{.underline} In the
last two weeks, [Iran has [mined two oil
tankers](https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/policy/defense-national-security/germanys-angela-merkel-strong-evidence-iran-to-blame-for-tanker-attacks)
and fired on two American unmanned aerial vehicles, [shooting one of
them
down](https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/policy/defense-national-security/us-commander-irans-claim-it-shot-down-us-drone-over-its-airspace-categorically-false)]{.underline}.
Why does America not reach out to Turkey? Turkey has not exactly been a
reliable ally during the regime of Recep Tayyip Erdoğan. The decision to
[yank the F-35 from that
country](https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/opinion/taking-turkeys-f-35s-is-the-right-move-for-the-wrong-reason)
is the right one, even if the Erdoğan regime's purchase of the S-400
air-defense system is the wrong reason. If we can't trust Turkey with
the F-35, can we trust them with other weapon systems? The answer would
appear to be no. Again, noting that the [Saudis are not angels should
not blind us to the fact that they have helped America out in the
past.]{.underline} As Historians Peter Schweizer (in his 1994 book,
[Victory](https://smile.amazon.com/Victory-Administrations-Strategy-Hastened-Collapse/dp/0871135671/ref=sr_1_1?crid=8W3GNUJWIB2E&keywords=victory+peter+schweizer&qid=1561060227&s=gateway&sprefix=Peter+Schweizer+Vic%2Caps%2C327&sr=8-1))

of oil production helped bring down the Soviet Union. Furthermore, when
America has turned its back on those who fought alongside us or who were
friendly, it hasn't worked out well. Did things get better or worse in
the Middle East when we abandoned the Shah of Iran over his bad human
rights record? Did things improve in Egypt when we turned our back on
Hosni Mubarak in favor of the Arab Spring? [What evidence is there that
dumping Mohammed bin Salman over human rights and Khashoggi will work
out any better for America -- or the world, for that
matter?]{.underline} [Nobody wants to see a war break out between the
United States and Iran. But cutting off weapons sales to Saudi Arabia is
**a good way to make war more likely**, not less]{.underline}. [If Saudi
Arabia is weakened, Iran will be more likely to continue to be
aggressive]{.underline} as the Trump administration keeps the pressure
on that regime. [A stronger Saudi Arabia]{.underline}, on the other
hand, [leaves Iran less room to maneuver]{.underline}. In the Middle
East, America must often choose between a number of options that are
less than ideal. [Sticking with the Saudis is the least bad option the
United States has at this time.]{.underline}

[The larger picture is that Iran has been nurturing its role in its near
abroad, particularly Iraq and Syria, and providing support to Hezbollah
in Lebanon and the Houthi rebels in Yemen.]{.underline} Much of this
support is well known. For Hezbollah it means not only financial
packages but also precision guidance for a rocket arsenal that now
[numbers up to
150,000](https://www.jpost.com/Arab-Israeli-Conflict/Hezbollahs-second-in-command-All-of-Israel-in-Hezbollahs-missile-range-573842).
Hezbollah has said all of Israel is within its range. In the waning days
of 2018, Israel launched an operation along its northern border to
ferret out Hezbollah tunnels. This was a warning to Beirut that Israel
knows what Hezbollah is up to. [Iran has indicated that a conflict with
the United States would [result in attacks on
Israel](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-mideast-iran-israel/israel-will-be-destroyed-in-half-an-hour-if-america-attacks-iran-senior-iranian-mp-idUSKCN1TW2MO).]{.underline}
Mojtaba Zolnour, chairman of the Iranian parliament's National Security
and Foreign Policy Commission said [Israel would be destroyed in the
event of war with the United States]{.underline}, according to a report
on July 1. [That could mean a Hezbollah-Israel war, but it could also
mean opening up a front in Gaza and in Syria.]{.underline} For instance,
Iran has supported Hamas, which has run Gaza since 2006, [and Islamic
Jihad](https://www.al-monitor.com/pulse/originals/2019/04/truce-hamas-islamic-jihad-egypt-gaza-sniper-return-marches.html),
a militant Palestinian group that has fired rockets at Israel from Gaza
over the last year. Using its Iron Dome air defense system, Israel has
deflected most of the [more than
1,000](https://www.jpost.com/Arab-Israeli-Conflict/IDF-1000-rockets-fired-at-southern-Israel-from-Gaza-over-the-past-year-575871)
rockets fired since March 2018, thus foregoing the need for a large
ground offensive like the ones that took place in 2009 and 2014. Iran
has also established bases and infrastructure in Syria. This includes
Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) bases that have been used to
support the Syrian regime of Bashar al-Assad in the conflict against the
Syrian rebels since 2011. [There are also Iranian-backed militias from
[Iraq who have gone to
Syria](https://www.washingtoninstitute.org/policy-analysis/view/the-shia-militia-mapping-project)
to serve in the conflict. The existence of this Iranian infrastructure
has generally been
[revealed](https://www.memri.org/reports/reports-arab-media-iranian-bases-syria?fbclid=IwAR3Ts5sBXVzXLQQ6dLFCkD_yZY4s9PfmKHZBIHMP_odMYQJ10fsEFyqGS4E)
through tensions with Israel. More than one thousand airstrikes by
Israel against targets from Damascus to two hundred kilometers north in
Latakia and Homs provinces, reveal the extent of Iran's role and
Israel's desire to reduce or at least stall the growth of Iranian
entrenchment.]{.underline} In addition, several serious incidents
illustrate that [Iran's goal in Syria has grown from helping the regime
defeat the rebels to using Syria for other purposes]{.underline}. This
has been seen as part of Iran's [attempt to carve out a "[road to the
sea](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/may/16/iran-changes-course-of-road-to-mediterranean-coast-to-avoid-us-forces)"
or corridor of influence via Syria to Lebanon]{.underline}. In February
2018, an Iranian drone flown from Syria entered Israeli [airspace near
Beit
Shean](https://www.rferl.org/a/israel-claims-iranian-drone-shot-down-armed-ready-strike-hizballah-nasrullah/29166945.html).
It was shot down and Israel struck the T-4 airbase on the road to
Palmyra where the drone was allegedly flown from. Later in May, a salvo
fired from Syria [resulted in another
round](https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/middle_east/israel-says-retaliation-just-thetip-of-the-iceberg-after-iran-blamed-for-overnight-strikes/2018/05/10/bd2fde18-53e8-11e8-a6d4-ca1d035642ce_story.html)
of Israeli retaliations. The simmering conflict puts Syrian air defense
in an awkward position. If they don't defend their Iranian ally that
will be seen as giving Israel a carte blanche to do as it wants. But
Syrian air defense has also proved remarkably erratic. In September
2018, an S-200 fired at an Israeli warplane [struck a
Russian](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/russia-blames-israel-plane-shot-down-syria-missile-ilyushin-20-surveillance-plane-latakia/)
plane that was landing in Latakia. Angered, Russia said it would supply
Syria with the S-300 air defense system. That system remained dormant
until June 30 when a satellite image from ImageSat International [showed
it deployed near
Masyaf](https://www.jpost.com/Israel-News/Four-S-300-missile-launchers-up-in-Syrias-Masyaf-province-594188).
It wasn't clear if it was operational and when Israeli struck targets
nearby the next day the system did not appear to be used. Instead
[another S-200
fired](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-48824500) wildly
went out to sea and hit a mountain in northern Cyprus. In another
instance in 2017, a Syrian missile [flew over
Jordan](https://www.timesofisrael.com/iaf-arrow-battery-intercepts-syrian-missile-in-first-reported-use-of-the-system/)
and had to be intercepted by Israel's Arrow 3 defense system. Syria's
one success was a missile that targeted an F-16, leading to the [plane
crashing](https://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-5103264,00.html) in
northern Israel. Israel's frontline in a potential growing crisis with
Iran is clear. It could involve Gaza, southern Lebanon and targets in
Syria. In the past Israel has warned that Hezbollah's role in Lebanon,
where it [controls the Health
Ministry](https://www.washingtoninstitute.org/policy-analysis/view/why-does-hezbollah-want-lebanons-health-ministry)
and has a powerful political and military presence in the country, has
ramifications for Lebanon in general. This will be a more serious
conflict than the one in 2006, which was a precursor of worse to come.
Hezbollah's weapons have increased in precision and it has thousands of
battle hardened men who fought in the Syrian Civil War. Israel's air
defense and arsenal has also increased. [For the United States, the arc
of confrontation with Iran stretches down the Euphrates river in Syria
where U.S. forces and their partners in the Syrian Democratic Forces
defeated the Islamic State in March of this year.]{.underline} In
addition, the [United States continues to [play a role in
Tanf](https://foreignpolicy.com/2019/01/25/us-considering-plan-to-stay-in-remote-syrian-base-to-counter-iran-tanf-pentagon-military-trump/),
a barebones desert base established in Syria near the border of Iraq and
Jordan.]{.underline} The base was supposed to train anti-ISIS fighters,
but its long-term fate is unclear. When President Donald Trump announced
the United States would leave Syria in December 2018, it appeared to be
on the menu to be folded up, but it is still there[. The United States
has warned Iranian-backed militias and Syrian regime forces to keep out
of an exclusion zone around the base, which they have harassed in the
past with bloody results. Along the Euphrates River, [tensions
flared](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/05/24/world/middleeast/american-commandos-russian-mercenaries-syria.html)
in February 2018]{.underline} when a [group of pro-Syrian regime
militias attacked the U.S.-backed Syrian Democratic Forces]{.underline}
(SDF) and the [United States responded, allegedly killing Russian
mercenaries among the Syrians]{.underline}. Later, in the summer of
2018, an airstrike on a Kata'ib Hezbollah base led to accusations by the
group that the United States was behind the attack---although it may
have been Israel. Kata'ib Hezbollah, which the United States considers a
foreign terrorist organization (FTO), is closely linked to Iran's IRGC,
which Washington also designated as an FTO this year. The [summer 2018
airstrike](https://nationalinterest.org/blog/middle-east-watch/what-israeli-airstrike-iranian-militia-syria-says-about-whats-come-24477)
illustrates that [in Syria the multiplicity of Iranian-linked groups
would mean that **any outbreak of hostilities could also result in
conflict along the Euphrates** between the United States and partners,
such as the SDF, and groups like Kata'ib Hezbollah.]{.underline} [Iran
also proved with [ballistic missile
strikes](https://www.jpost.com/Middle-East/Iran-News/Iranian-ballistic-missiles-fired-at-Syria-as-revenge-for-Ahvaz-attack-568384)
in the fall of 2018 that it can target this area, so nothing is off the
table.]{.underline} Although Iran said it was retaliating for an ISIS
attack in Ahwaz, the United States asserted that it had not been warned
beforehand. Tensions with Iran also threaten U.S. forces in Iraq. For
instance, in the spring of 2018, a quarterly Department of Defense
report in May noted "Iranian support for certain PMF \[Popular
Mobilization Forces\] militias posed the greatest threat to the safety
of US personnel in Iraq." A more recent Inspector General report on the
U.S. anti-ISIS [campaign
warned](https://media.defense.gov/2019/Feb/05/2002086500/-1/-1/1/FY2019_LIG_OIRREPORT.PDF)
about the need to divert resources from the anti-ISIS fight to monitor
Iranian threats in Iraq.

### Iran War -- Adventurism

#### The plan collapses the alliance and ruins US-Saudi cooperation to deter Iran

[The U.S.-Saudi relationship is important for both countries'
security]{.underline} --- especially [as the confrontation with Tehran
edges closer to war. But it is built on an unstable
platform]{.underline}. This month's [House vote to block the sale of new
weapons to the kingdom is a sign of the political trauma at the core of
the relationship]{.underline}, and of trouble ahead. Resetting the
U.S.-Saudi relationship on a more honest basis is urgent now, as the
danger of regional conflict grows. The latest sharp escalation came
Friday as Iran seized a British tanker in the Gulf, according to a U.S.
official. This provocation makes British and probably American
retaliation likely --- compounding the crisis further, which seems to be
Iran's goal. [American and Saudi commanders stress they don't want war.
But]{.underline} make no mistake: [Unless the United States]{.underline}
or Iran [eases its demands, this confrontation will lead to a battle
that would devastate the region.]{.underline}

#### Alliance with Saudi Arabia keeps Iran in check in the Gulf

Al-**Mashareq**, 9-10-20**18**, GCC, US strategic alliance keeps Iran in
check,
https://almashareq.com/en_GB/articles/cnmi_am/features/2019/02/14/feature-01,
7-28-2019, updog

The Gulf Co-operation Council (GCC) is [a strong regional alliance that
has been successful in maintaining stability in the Gulf in the face of
the Iranian threat]{.underline}, political analysts told Al-Mashareq.
[The alliance is further fortified by its partnership with the US, they
said, noting that it serves as a model for strong regional and
international partnerships that are capable of deterring any threats
aimed at destabilising the Middle East]{.underline}. Since the GCC was
established in 1981, member states have proven their co-operative spirit
and their support for one another, Saudi political analyst Abdulrahman
al-Mulhim told Al-Mashareq. [\"Solidarity among GCC countries is a very
important element, especially in the current period, and is one of the
most critical elements we need at the present time,\"]{.underline}
al-Mulhim said. GCC states face many challenges at present, especially
from Iran and its various proxies, he noted, and must take this threat
with all due seriousness. If they remain \"allied, united and
cohesive\", however, no threat will shake them, he said. [In addition to
having a network of strong internal alliances, GCC member states also
have strong partnerships with strategic allies outside the region, most
significantly the US, al-Mulhim said. This strategic partnership has
helped to further a massive and robust effort to modernise a joint
weapons and armament strategy, he said, noting that GCC states currently
possess significant military capabilities]{.underline}. In the four
decades since the Iranian revolution, \"the Iranian regime has not
stopped intervening in the affairs of the Arab nation in general and GCC
countries in particular\", said Bahraini political writer Abdullah
al-Huweihi. \"All attempts to maintain good neighbourliness have been to
no avail,\" he told Al-Mashareq, adding that despite calls by Gulf and
international leaders to desist, Iran \"is continuing to pursue its
hostile policy against the region\". [\"Building strategic alliances
with both the West and East will remain a top priority, in order to
protect the security and stability of the Arabian Gulf and its
wealth,\"]{.underline} al-Huweihi said. [Maintaining strategic ties with
the US is a top priority]{.underline}, he added, [in order to stop
Iranian expansion in the Gulf and Arab countries, as has been the case
in Yemen, Iraq, Syria and Lebanon.]{.underline} \"The region needs to
strike a military balance, led by GCC countries, in co-operation and
co-ordination with its strategic partners,\" al-Huweihi said. \"Iran no
longer understands the language of neighbourliness, dialogue, logic or
humanitarian brotherhood,\" he added. \"It is our right as countries to
build a military force to preserve our unity, security and stability,
and safeguard our peoples, homelands and national gains,\" he said.
Bahraini journalist Ibrahim al-Nahham noted the insecurity of the Gulf
region since the Iranian Revolution of 1979, and pointed to \"Iran's
continuous attempts to interfere in the internal affairs of GCC
states\". [Iran has tried to create sectarian divisions in societies and
thereby destabilise governments, which confirms \"Iran is the first
enemy of the stability of the region and future of its
people\"]{.underline}, he told Al-Mashareq. He pointed to the firm
foundations upon which the GCC was built \"as an integrated group at all
levels, especially at the security and military levels\". [Security
co-operation]{.underline} has resulted in the successful establishment
of the Jazeera Shield force, the military arm of the GCC, he said, as
well as ongoing joint military and security training exercises between
the GCC member states. These [include \"Gulf Shield-1\", a month-long
military exercise in April 2018 hosted by Saudi Arabia involving more
than two dozen nations, which involved combat search-and-rescue drills
as well as naval warfare and air operations.]{.underline} Military
exercises with US forces include \"Iron Union 9\", a joint drill between
the US Army and the UAE\'s al-Dhafra Brigade which began last December
17th and continued for three days in the UAE\'s al-Hamra region. The
drill, an extension of the \'Iron Claw\' series of joint exercises, was
designed to increase combat readiness and enhance the ability of
participating forces to respond to security threats.

#### Saudi Arabia is a key partner in checking Iran, an embargo would deck Saudi's efforts

**Cordesman 2018** (ANTHONY CORDESMAN- Anthony H. Cordesman holds the
Arleigh A. Burke chair in strategy at the[Center for Strategic and
International Studies](https://www.csis.org/) in Washington, D.C. He has

accessed 7/26/19)

Somewhere along the line, [we seem to have forgotten that our **strategy
in the Middle East is dependent on Saudi Arabia** as our most important
single security partner.]{.underline} Israel's security is certainly a
key American concern, but it does not play an [active role in most of
America's ongoing military engagements in the region, in dealing with
Iran, or in a direct fight against violent extremist movements like ISIS
and Al Qaeda.]{.underline} [Saudi Arabia's role as a strategic partner
has also been enhanced by the fact that Egypt and Algeria are focused on
their own internal stability and their roles in the region have sharply
diminished]{.underline}, and [Iraq and Syria both must deal with major
instability problems and are at war]{.underline}. Our European allies
have declining power projection capabilities, and Turkey's role in the
region is increasingly problematic. It is certainly true that Saudi
Arabia needs the United States as much or more than the United States
needs Saudi Arabia. Saudi military forces are steadily improving, but it
is the U.S. presence in the region that create a balance of forces that
firmly deters Iran and has helped Saudi Arabia defeat its own terrorist
threats from groups like Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula. [U.S. arms
shipments, advisory efforts and exercises also play a critical role in
improving Saudi forces. But the United States needs Saudi Arabia as
well. Saudi Arabia is now the most critical single security partner in
ensuring the stable flow of petroleum out of the Gulf
region.]{.underline} While the United States is largely eliminating its
need for direct petroleum imports, it is steadily increasing its
dependence on the health and growth of the global economy and imports
from Asian states like China, Japan, South Korea and Taiwan, which are
critically dependent on Gulf petroleum exports. The end result is that
[U.S. strategic interests in the region continue to increase in spite of
the steady cut in U.S. direct oil imports. This is why focusing on more
U.S. arms sales to Saudi Arabia and Saudi investment in the United
States, ignoring the growing role Saudi Arabia has played in fight
terrorism since 2003, down playing the need to cooperate in checking
Iran, and treating the war in Yemen as is if Saudi Arabia does not face
real threats is not the way the United States should deal]{.underline}
with Crown Prince Mohammed Bin Salman's visit to the White House. [Saudi
Arabia's reform and economic development plans are **critical to its
stability and the region's security.** The kingdom needs U.S.
encouragement]{.underline} and an understanding that Saudi Arabia cannot
implement these plans effectively without outside support. The burden
sharing argument has become absurd. Saudi Arabia cannot be treated as a
source of ready money every time the United States has a need. It is
already spending more than 10 percent of its economy on security, which
is three times the economic burden security places on the United States.
This spending is too high given the kingdom's other needs, and the
United States should be focusing on better ways to make its security
partnerships with Saudi Arabia, as well as the other Gulf states and
Jordan more efficient and less costly, not simply on spending more. At
the same time, **[Iran is all too real a threat]{.underline}**.
[Effective joint action in dealing with Iran's nuclear programs, its
ballistic and cruise missile programs, its asymmetric threats to Gulf
shipping, and expending military influence in the region are all
critical common U.S. and Saudi priorities]{.underline}. The United
States also badly needs to find some common approach to dealing with
Iraq and Syria that will move both towards recovery and lasting
stability, limit Iranian and Russian influence as much as possible, and
help stabilize relations with Turkey. There are no easy options in
either case, but Saudi Arabia is the key potential Arab partner any such
efforts. [The United States, especially members of Congress, needs to
remember that we have had at least as many military problems in fighting
the Iraq and Syria wars as Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates
have faced in fighting in Yemen. Cutting U.S. arms shipments to Saudi
Arabia may do little more that lead the Saudis to ignore the systems
that the United States has helped set up to limit targeting of civilians
and using unguided and more damaging air munitions.]{.underline} It
raises a whole new round of questions about the U.S commitment to its
partners in the region.

#### Saudi Arabia is key to isolate and check Iran

**Bisaccio 2018** (Derek Bisaccio- Military Markets Analyst, Bachelor's
degree in international relations and affairs from Roger Williams
University, "Examining U.S. Arms Sales to Saudi Arabia," 10/23/18,

There are several diverging viewpoints on which course of action is
preferable for the U.S. to take. Jonathan Caverley, writing in The New
York Times, pushed for the U.S. to utilize its leverage in arms deals to
pressure Riyadh, noting that "the United States has the preponderance of
influence in this arms trade relationship," not Saudi Arabia.\[iii\] He
pointed out that [the bulk of Saudi Arabia's military equipment comes
from the U.S.]{.underline} (followed by Europe) and that [non-Western
suppliers]{.underline} like Russia and China [do not have the type of
systems Saudi Arabia seeks; nor would switching Saudi force structures
to Russian manufacture be an easy undertaking for the Saudi
government.]{.underline} [It would be expensive, take significant
amounts of time, and require a restructuring of Saudi Arabia's security
outlook]{.underline}, all to import systems whose quality and usefulness
Saudi Arabia is already skeptical of. These are strong points, but [it
is worth pointing out that a significant or total shutdown of U.S. arms
cooperation with Saudi Arabia would come with its own set of
risks.]{.underline} The most immediate consequence would be
[**jeopardizing American ties with Riyadh**, a country that remains
influential in the world especially because of its ability to act as a
swing oil producer.]{.underline} Opponents of Saudi Arabia in general
see no issue with downgrading U.S.-Saudi relations, and perhaps in time
the U.S. might view its security interests as diverging from requiring
Washington to work with governments like Saudi Arabia's. But [if the
Trump administration's goal in the present is to isolate Iran and
concretely address its nuclear and missile programs as well as foreign
policy in the region, coordination of efforts with Saudi Arabia will
prove essential.]{.underline} [Critics of the Crown Prince regularly
paint him as reckless, which, if an accurate depiction, should prompt
consideration of whether reducing America's ability to influence Saudi
policy choices is the wisest course of action for Washington to
take.]{.underline} Depending on how severely the U.S. was to act,
[cutting defense cooperation could produce the opposite effect than
intended with respect to Saudi policies: Saudi Arabia could well
double-down, or in any case refuse to budge, rather than concede to
Washington.]{.underline} Should the U.S. cut only a few deals, or refuse
to sell a few systems, the pressure will be so miniscule as to hardly
register in Riyadh. A more aggressive approach, however, would not be
guaranteed to produce a better effect on Saudi policy. A useful
comparison may be the [U.S. response to Egyptian President Abdel Fattah
el-Sisi's overthrow of Egypt's previous government and the subsequent
massacre of protestors in Rabaa]{.underline}. The U.S. [criticized the
government of President Sisi and cut a significant amount of arms
cooperation]{.underline} pending improvement toward a more democratic
system. [Two years later, the U.S. rescinded the policy, having made
little to no progress.\[]{.underline}iv\] Bahrain hardly moved on its
domestic policies despite the U.S. temporarily enacting a hold on the
sale of F-16s to the country until it improved its human rights record.
Perhaps extending these bans or making them bite harder would have the
intended effect, but [solely using coercive measures to target
governments based on their domestic policies]{.underline}, however
repulsive those policies may be, is **[not likely to produce positive
change]{.underline}**, particularly if those policies are related to
what the government conceptualizes as maintenance of regime security.

Dubai: [**Washington's relationship with Saudi Arabia is "fundamental to
the stability and security of the region**," US Secretary of State Mike
Pompeo said]{.underline} on Saturday. ["The relationship must go
forward. We have to have good relations with the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia
and this administration intends to do so,"]{.underline} Pompeo said in
an interview with Al Arabiya. Pompeo will meet with Saudi Crown Prince
Mohammad bin Salman on Sunday and plans to address many regional issues.
When asked if it was a partnership or a friendship with Saudi Arabia,
Pompeo told Al Arabiya: \"Call it what you will. They\'ve been great
partners in the missions that we have asked them to assist us with.
Stability He added: ["This relationship, this mutually beneficial
relationship to create stability in the Middle East --- and to assist
the US in executing things that keep the American people safe --- is
very important. And I\'m convinced the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia will be a
great ally in doing so.]{.underline}\" His Highness Shaikh Mohammad Bin
Zayed Al Nahyan, Abu Dhabi Crown Prince and Deputy Supreme Commander of
the UAE Armed Forces, received the US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo,
who is on a tour in the region. Pompeo arrived in Abu Dhabi over the
weekend, one of the stops on his nine-nation tour of Middle East, and
his travels will continue on Sunday with stops in Saudi Arabia and
Qatar. He will wrap the tour up on Monday and Tuesday in Oman and
Kuwait. Pompeo\'s Middle east tour is aimed at reassuring America\'s
partners that withdrawing troops from Syria does not mean Washington is
abandoning the region. Pompeo has traveled to Bahrain and the United
Arab Emirates where he called for increasing pressure on Iran and push
for unity among Gulf neighbours still embroiled in a festering dispute
with Qatar. Arab Nato [He\'ll also promoted a US-backed initiative to
form what some have termed an \"Arab Nato\" that would **bring the
region together in a military alliance to counter threats from
Iran**.]{.underline} In Bahrain, the UAE and later Qatar, Saudi Arabia,
Oman and Kuwait, Pompeo will also be making the case as he did on
previous stops in Jordan, Iraq and Egypt that President Donald Trump\'s
decision to pull U.S. troops from Syria is not a sign Washington is
retreating from the fight against Daesh. The trip came as a U.S.
military official announced Friday that the withdrawal had begun, though
he declined to comment on specific timetables or movements. [US
partnerships with the members of the Gulf Cooperation Council \"are
critical to achieving shared regional objectives: defeating Daesh,
countering radical terrorism, protecting global energy supplies, **and
rolling back Iranian aggression**]{.underline},\" the State Department
said in a statement r

eleased as Pompeo departed Egypt for Bahrain, home to the US Navy\'s 5th
Fleet. But the now 2-year-old crisis between GCC members Saudi Arabia
and UAE and Qatar has hampered US attempts to forge a unified front
against Iran. Backbone of regional peace Washington\'s efforts to ease
the dispute, begun by former Secretary of State Rex Tillerson, have thus
far failed and took another hit this week when the former general tasked
to broker a solution stepped down. [\"A united GCC is the backbone for
regional peace, prosperity, security, and stability, and is essential to
countering the single greatest threat to regional stability: the Iranian
regime]{.underline},\" the State Department said. At each of his stops
in the Gulf, Pompeo will be urging progress on creating the Middle East
Strategic Alliance, which would join GCC militaries with those of Egypt
and Jordan to serve as a counter-balance to Iran, which they all accuse
of fomenting unrest and rebellion throughout the region. US Secretary of
State Mike Pompeo (C) takes a tour of the newly inaugurated Al-Fattah
Al-Alim mosque in Egypt\'s New Administrative Capital, 45 kilometres
east of Cairo. Pompeo told Fox News before departing from Cairo that
there would be an international conference on Iran and the Middle East
in Poland on February 13-14. Yemen conflict During his trip, [Pompeo
will also call for boosting efforts to end the conflict in Yemen, where
a Saudi-led coalition has been battling Iranian-backed rebels in what
the UN says is now the world\'s worst humanitarian crisis,]{.underline}
the department said. UN-led peace efforts in Yemen, along with attempts
to broker a political solution to the war in Syria that \"expels every
last Iranian boot from the country\" and promoting reconciliation in
Afghanistan will also be high on Pompeo\'s agenda, the State Department
said. In Cairo, Pompeo delivered a scathing rebuke of former President
Barack Obama\'s Middle East policies that Obama had outlined in a 2009
address to the Arab and broader Muslim world. In a speech entitled \"A
Force for Good: America\'s Reinvigorated Role in the Middle East,\"
Pompeo accused the former president of \"misguided\" thinking that
diminished America\'s role in the region while harming its long-time
friends and emboldening Iran. He assailed the Obama administration for
being \"naive\" and \"timid\" when confronted with challenges posed by
the revolts that convulsed the Middle East, including Egypt, beginning
in 2011. Pompeo blamed the previous administration\'s approach to the
Mideast for the ills that consume it now, particularly the rise of the
Daesh (the so-called Islamic State group in Iraq and Syria) and Iran\'s
increasing assertiveness, which he said was a direct result of sanctions
relief, since rescinded by the Trump administration, granted to it under
the 2015 nuclear deal. He also said Obama ignored the growth of the
Iranian-backed Hezbollah movement in Lebanon to the detriment of
Israel\'s security and not doing enough to push back on Iran-supported
rebels in Yemen. And, he said the Trump administration was taking action
to repair the damage. Since withdrawing from the nuclear deal last year,
the administration has steadily ratcheted up pressure on Tehran and
routinely accuses the nation of being the most destabilizing influence
in the region. It has vowed to increase the pressure until Iran halts
what US officials describe as its \"malign activities\" throughout the
Mideast and elsewhere, including support for rebels in Yemen,
anti-Israel groups, and Syrian President Bashar Assad. \'Self-inflicted
American shame\' \"The age of self-inflicted American shame is over, and
so are the policies that produced so much needless suffering,\" Pompeo
said in the speech. The reaction to Pompeo\'s speech was swift and
equally harsh. \"That this administration feels the need, nearly a
decade later, to take potshots at an effort to identify common ground
between the Arab world and the West speaks not only to the Trump
administration\'s pettiness but also to its lack of a strategic vision
for America\'s role in the region and its abdication of America\'s
values,\" National Security Action group, a group of former officials,
said in a statement. Since withdrawing from the nuclear deal last year,
[the administration has steadily ratcheted up pressure on Tehran and

China's rise in the Middle East is not simply a case of debt-trap
diplomacy or expanding Chinese influence, it requires an ideological
shift to accommodate a new regional player and the process of
institutional change that that brings. [**Any US action in Iran would
profoundly benefit China's interests in Iran and strengthen its position
across the region.** Inviting China's capital, technology transfer, and
arms trade into Iran and further opening Iranian export markets to China
would greatly accelerate a fundamental shift in the undercurrent of the
Middle East: a geoeconomic shift from a northward regional axis to a
southward regional axis -- away from Moscow and towards the Indian
Ocean, facilitating China's access ambitions.]{.underline} Without a
US-trade war in the Pacific or a potential hot war in the Gulf, the
world does not have too much to fear in China yet. Generally speaking,
China is too incompetent to be a superpower: ideologically deficient,
global governance deficient, power projection deficient, and
geoeconomically deficient. Coupled with the fact that China has
geopolitically over-extended itself over the past eighteen months and
also has virtually zero competence in Middle East affairs, China is
unprepared to fully back Iran in any conflict with the US. However, a
developing China axis of future influence falls roughly along a straight
line from Urumqi to Cairo. Professor Wang Yangshu, at Lanzhou University
Central Asian Institute, has argued that China's interaction with
Central Asian and Middle Eastern economies will primarily be with the US
along this line. I would further push that anything south of this line
falls into a China Indian Ocean sphere of influence, while anything
north of it remains solely within Moscow's purview. Moreover, if
Russia's historically significant regional states are Afghanistan, Iran,
and Turkey, then China's could be said to be Pakistan, Iran and Turkey.
It is clear that Iran is central to China's 21st Century geostrategy.
Iran is a strategic Belt and Road bridge, critical to China's land and
sea infrastructure construction for cementing trade routes from Europe
and East Africa into Western China. The five key the Middle East Indian
Ocean economies for China are Pakistan, Iran, Saudi Arabia, Egypt, and
Oman all centered around an Indian Ocean geoindustrial policy. [The
prospect of China geoeconomic power in the Persian Gulf and the Red Sea
mean opening the Indian Ocean to a new world of geoeconomic
opportunities for China's geo-industrial and geopolitical options. This
means China's Middle East trade and industry policy should be read as a
geo-industrial foundation of a future geopolitics For Iran, wider
questions about the Iranian economy all seem to have natural answers in
China too.]{.underline} China's civil nuclear technology transfer
program is bringing third-generation pressurized water Hualong One
reactors to Iran, which can be deployed on inland river systems, away
from the vulnerable coast. [Alongside technology transfers, China is
offering industrial capacity transfers in aluminum and steel,
agroindustrial investment, and of course, a massive oil consumer market.
China is also developing competency in water security in the region,
practicing strategic water limitation of Tibetan rivers to India,
developing a Tibet-Xinjiang terraforming plan, as well as its strategic
cooperative relationships with Kyrgyzstan and Tajikistan---both great
water stores. Given Iran's acute water security crisis and extant
domestic political risk, any Chinese water security would be
invaluable.]{.underline} Questions on Iran that the US administration
should be asking itself are which formal and informal
government-to-government institutional linkages between China and Iran
will be strengthened by any US-led conflict? Perhaps most importantly in
terms of institutional history, would be the institutional relationships
of the people within Iran who were there for Iran-China arms trade and
military support in the past. Like the picture of Rumsfeld with Saddam,
who from Iran was buying Chinese arms in the Iran-Iraq war who is still
reasonably relevant to the current Iran administration? Similarly, with
China's economic technoindustrial transfers, [there is an Iran-China
institutional structure here that strategic bombardment is not going to
weaken, but will only strengthen. China already has overseas military
bases in Tajikistan and Djibouti. It has flirted with force projection
in Syria. China also supplies technology to Iran for Iran's civil
nuclear power program. China has the power to shortcut any aspect of
Iran's military nuclear program]{.underline}. In the short-term, there
is little chance of China forward deploying in Iran, but in the longer
term, [closer military relations between the two states could begin to
form a natural alliance against US power in the region.]{.underline} The
US media response to US belligerence in Iran has so far been one of
bemusement, but Chinese rhetoric towards the US over the trade war has
been a "tallionic" like for like, with the statement on Tuesday 15th May
2019 on State CCTV about the trade war that China is not willing to
fight, but not afraid to fight, and will fight if necessary. And if
China were to support Iran in proxy wars with the United States, the
resulting quagmire could become intractable for the US. China may not be
ready for regional influence or projected power, but foreign policy
hawks in Washington or Moscow are not ready for this either. Both have
only ever seen China within their own threat matrices, not of China
redefining these matrices. Likewise, the outcome of any military
confrontation will not matter in the short-term, but this could be
remembered as the conflict that ended the 75-year aerospace domination
of warfare, and ushers in a new age of security threats in information,
technology, and water. If the US is seen to be throwing the dice rather
than thinking it through, then China's Iran policy is also undercooked,
a waxing regional power completely unprepared for foreign policy
misadventures in the Middle East. However, for the US, this is not 1991
or 2003. In 1991 regional conflicts were more easily isolated into
global power narratives. The year 2003 destabilized the region, was
probably the beginning of the distrust and delegitimation of Western
democratic governance models abroad and also the start of disaffection
with national and power politics as patronage systems at home. However,
unlike 2003, 2019 is wired. In 2019 governments struggle to control
narratives that were once the monopoly of technocrats in the military
industrial complex. The US has lost control of the global governance
narrative, and let slip the dogs of war on a whim into a tornado of
uncontrollable variables in both information warfare and conventional
warfare is inviting catastrophe from calm.

### Iran Bad -- Oil

#### Maintaining good relations with KSA are key to deter Iranian aggression and prevent Iranian control of strategic oil flows in the Middle East. 

**Hanson** 10/16/**18** (Jim Hanson is President of Security Studies
Group and served in US Army Special Forces; "The US-Saudi relationship
must be preserved -- our national interest demands it";
<https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/the-us-saudi-relationship-must-be-preserved-our-national-interest-demands-it>;
Accessed 7/26/19) Taj

The concerted efforts now underway to derail the improved relations
between the U.S. and Saudi Arabia established by the Trump
administration are unhelpful at best and dangerous to America's national
and economic security at worst. Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman
is a reformer trying to modernize his country. The steps he has taken so
far are unprecedented. Letting that progress fall victim to mistakes by
his government and attacks from opponents would be a massive mistake.
[The death of Washington Post columnist Jamal Khashoggi -- a critic of
the Saudi government, who has not been heard from since he entered the
Saudi Consulate in Istanbul two weeks ago -- was a tragedy]{.underline}.
If the facts show the government of Saudi Arabia was responsible for his
death it should be held accountable. [But the death of Khashoggi **does
not outweigh U.S. strategic concerns**, which require that we maintain
good relations with the Saudi government. We must react accordingly --
not as a favor to the Saudis, but in our own national interest. In the
Middle East we must keep our eyes on the biggest threat in the region --
the dangerous and virulently anti-American government of Iran, which
poses a military danger to its neighbors and our ally Israel. We must
work with and strengthen the burgeoning coalition of our Arab allies to
counter the Iranian threat. And the Saudis play a vital role in that
Arab coalition.]{.underline} The Washington Post is understandably upset
and angry about the death of its columnist. Editorial Page Editor Fred
Hiatt said that reports of Khashoggi's killing, if true, represent "a
monstrous and unfathomable act." Consequently, the Post has taken a lead
role in [promoting the call for U.S. action against the Saudi
government]{.underline} -- action that [would harm us as well as the
Saudis in three areas: military cooperation; keeping oil flowing from
Saudi fields; and providing jobs for U.S. workers who produce arms and
other exports purchased by the kingdom]{.underline}. The Post said in a
wrongheaded editorial published Monday night: "The reality is that Saudi
Arabia, which, as Mr. Trump himself has pointed out, would not survive
without U.S. security support, has everything to lose from a break in
relations, while the United States no longer needs the kingdom as much
as it once did." The Post fails to point out that [the U.S. has as much
to benefit from a good relationship with the Saudis as they
do.]{.underline} If U.S. action results in the fall of the current
leadership of the kingdom, we will see a return to power of the Saudi
hardliners who supported terrorism and oppression. That is in nobody's
interest. Apart from the death of Khashoggi, a major complaint by many
against the Saudis is their ongoing fight against the Iranian proxy
fighters in Yemen -- a group called the Houthis. But [the Saudi fight
against the Houthis is vital to prevent Iran from shutting down both
major sea lanes for the export of oil from the region. The Iranians
already sit perched on the Straits of Hormuz and threaten regularly to
stop oil traffic there. If the Iranians can consolidate their position
in Yemen via the Houthis, they will then have the Bab al Mandeb Strait
in their sights as well. The Iranians have already attacked Saudi
vessels and that will happen more often if the Houthis are allowed to
win the civil war in Yemen. Iran fostered the Yemen civil war and should
bear the blame for any humanitarian crisis happening there]{.underline}.
[The Iranians are supplying arms -- including missiles -- to the Houthis
and have joined the Houthis in firing those missiles into Saudi
Arabia.]{.underline} The famine and other shortages in Yemen can be
ended as soon as Iran wishes. [Saudi Arabia has been the largest
supplier of food to Yemen for the past 30 years and will continue to do
so]{.underline}. But we cannot stop the fight against Iranian proxies
who can kill massive numbers of people in the region and threaten vital
U.S. interests, including the free flow of shipping. I can already hear
critics of my view saying the Saudis are paying me or the think tank I
head, the Security Studies Group, to support their government. But in
fact, the Security Studies Group has never taken a dime of foreign money
and the Saudis are not paying me either. We as a group support the
opportunity a modern Saudi Arabia presents to its people, the Middle
East and to the United States. I personally have not seen a better
chance to change the dynamic in the region during my lifetime. [The
Trump administration and Congress should resist calls to stop arms sales
to Saudi Arabia and even worse to stop supporting the crown
prince]{.underline} -- calls like those made by Sen. Lindsey Graham,
R-S.C., on "Fox & Friends" Monday. [**Destroying our relationship with**
the **Saudis would result in far more deaths and suffering in the
region** than keeping our relationship strong. And such a move would be
a great gift to the mullahs who rule Iran]{.underline} and lead their
people in chants of "Death to America" and boast of their plans to wipe
Israel off the map. [In the Middle East we must keep our eyes on the
biggest threat in the region -- the dangerous and virulently
anti-American government of Iran, which poses a military danger to its
neighbors and our ally Israel]{.underline}. [If America acts against
Saudi Arabia with such extreme measures that we topple the government,
we would gain nothing but a return to failed policies and extremism of
Saudi Arabia's recent past. We would lose a golden opportunity to move
the kingdom forward into modernity.]{.underline} Secretary of State Mike
Pompeo, who met with Saudi leaders Tuesday, presumably had a frank
discussion with Mohammed bin Salman and other Saudi high-ranking
officials about the death of Khashoggi and some of the other issues
dividing our nations. Pompeo, President Trump and other U.S. officials
have an obligation to give the Saudis an unmistakable message that if
the Saudi government was responsible for killing Khashoggi that was an
unacceptable action, as would be other such killings in the future. But
[rather than turning our backs on the Saudi government we must work to
push the country to make further reforms, institute a greater respect
for human rights and the rule of law and continue to defend against
Iranian aggression. The U.S., the people of Saudi Arabia and the entire
Middle East **will be better off if we work with the Saudis instead of
turning against them.**]{.underline}

## Impacts -- Oil Prices

### Alliance Key -- Internal Link

#### Saudi alliance is key to avoiding oil production cuts

**Davies 18** (Rob Davies has a bachelor in English and German
literature from Oxford University, "How much Damage can Saudi Arabia do
to the global economy?" 10/15/18,
<https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/oct/15/how-much-damage-can-saudi-arabia-do-to-the-global-economy>
accessed 7/27/19)

[Saudi Arabia enjoys a privileged position both in geopolitical and
economic terms. It will have a powerful hand to play if tensions with
the US and the west escalate]{.underline} and it [follows through with
Sunday's warning of
retaliation](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/oct/14/jamal-khashoggi-turkey-looks-to-uk-to-persuade-saudi-arabia-to-cooperate).
[Its vast oil reserves]{.underline} -- it claims to have about 260bn
barrels still to extract -- [afford the most obvious advantage. The
kingdom is the world's largest oil exporter, pumping or shipping about
7m barrels a day, and giving Riyadh [huge clout in the global
economy](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/jun/30/trump-saudi-arabia-oil-production-iran-venezuela)
because it wields power to push up prices.]{.underline} An editorial in
Arab News by Turki Aldhakhil, the general manager of the official Saudi
news channel, Al Arabiya, offers a hint of what could be in the offing.
He said Riyadh was weighing up 30 measures designed to put pressure on
the US if it were to impose sanctions over the disappearance and
presumed murder of Jamal Khashoggi inside the country's Istanbul
consulate. These would include an [**oil production cut that could drive
prices from around \$80** (£60) a barrel **to more than \$400,** more
than double the [all-time high
of\$147.27](https://www.theguardian.com/business/2008/jul/12/oil.commodities)
reached in 2008]{.underline}. This would have [profound consequences
globally, not just because motorists would pay more at the petrol pump,
but because it would force up the cost of all goods that travel by
road.]{.underline} Saudi Arabia also supports thousands of US jobs via
its arms purchases. It is the [world's second-largest arms importer
after
India](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/mar/12/nearly-half-of-us-arms-exports-go-to-the-middle-east)
and 61% of those imports come from the US. It was the US's biggest arms
customer last year, signing \$17.5bn worth of deals, a trend that looks
set to continue after Donald Trump [signed a \$110bn defence agreement
in
Riyadh](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/may/12/us-saudi-arabia-arms-deal-donald-trump-visit)
last year. [The alliance stands to benefit US employers such as Lockheed
Martin, Boeing, General Electric and ExxonMobil. Some of the firms are
reported to have expressed concern to Trump already about the impact
that a freeze in Saudi-US relations might have.]{.underline} [Riyadh
could, for example, simply switch its purchases to other major arms
exporters such as Russia and China.]{.underline} Trump's trip to the
Arabian peninsula last year also yielded an agreement that the kingdom's
Public Investment Fund, which manages its vast oil wealth, would invest
in US infrastructure programmes. The PIF is to stump up \$20bn of a
\$40bn pot overseen by the global asset manager Blackstone. The fund,
however, has yet to gather any serious momentum. [Saudi Arabia has shown
in the past that it is not afraid to leverage its unique political and
economic position to get its own way. An investigation into allegations
of bribery [involving the British defence firm BAE Systems in the
country](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/mar/06/us-investigation-into-bae-saudi-arms-deal-watered-down-leaked-memo-suggests)
was dropped under Tony Blair's government in 2006. Blair said Riyadh had
threatened to stop cooperating on intelligence matters, putting Britain
at greater risk of a terrorist attack.]{.underline} Seth Frantzman, the
executive director of the US-based Middle East Center for Reporting and
Analysis, said the kingdom's importance to US strategy in the Gulf,
particularly as a bulwark against Iran, gave it great influence.
"They're part of an American-Saudi-UAE alliance, and the current US
administration is tough on Iran, so [in some ways the US is more
beholden to [Saudi
Arabia](https://www.theguardian.com/world/saudiarabia) than in previous
years]{.underline}," he said. "[They don't want to be humiliated in this
exchange]{.underline}. The US press says Trump will punish Saudi Arabia,
and [they **don't want to come out of this looking like the child being
punished**]{.underline}. "[Saudi probably feels it's on a winning streak
economically and if it has to take a hit, which it already is in terms
of its image, it will be made up for by the fact they'll find markets
somewhere else]{.underline}."

### Arms Sales -- Internal Link -- Saudi Arabia

#### Any sanctions will lead to a backlash by Saudi Arabia, U.S. relies on Saudi crude oil

against possible sanctions]{.underline} [related to the
disappearance](http://www.cnn.com/2018/10/15/middleeast/saudi-us-khashoggi-turkey-intl/index.html)
of Washington Post journalist Jamal Khashoggi. [The United States [still
imports 7.9 million
barrels](https://www.eia.gov/dnav/pet/hist/LeafHandler.ashx?n=pet&s=mcrimus2&f=m)
of foreign crude per day and a sizable chunk comes from Saudi Arabia,
the world\'s largest oil exporter.]{.underline} [[Despite soaring US oil
production,](https://money.cnn.com/2018/07/17/investing/texas-oil-iran-iraq-permian-basin/index.html)
the United States still imported 876,000 barrels of crude a day from
Saudi Arabia in July]{.underline}, according to the most recent
[government
statistics](https://www.eia.gov/dnav/pet/hist/LeafHandler.ashx?n=PET&s=MCRIMUSSA2&f=M).
Even though imports from Saudi Arabia have declined sharply from 10
years ago, [the kingdom remains the No. 2 supplier to the United
States]{.underline}, behind only Canada. Saudi oil represents about 11%
of total oil imports, roughly on par with 1973, the year the kingdom
sent oil prices spiking by launching an embargo that crippled the
American economy. \"**[Anyone who thinks our shale oil boom means we can
rely less on Saudi Arabia, doesn\'t understand how the oil market
works]{.underline}**,\" said Bob McNally, president of consulting firm
Rapidan Energy Group and an energy official under President George W.
Bush. In fact, [even as US oil production ramped up in September, so did
purchases of Saudi oil.]{.underline} The United States imported 1.1
million barrels per day of Saudi oil last month, a 16-month high,
according to unofficial statistics from research firm ClipperData. [The
problem is that the shale oil coming out of the Permian Basin in Texas
and elsewhere is a very light blend that doesn\'t fit well with
America\'s Gulf Coast refineries. [To quench America\'s thirst for
gasoline](https://money.cnn.com/2018/08/14/investing/oil-refinery-gasoline-demand/index.html)
and jet fuel, these decades-old refineries require a steady dose of
medium and heavy grades of crude**. Saudi Arabia\'s crude is the perfect
match**.]{.underline} The United States consumed almost 20 million
barrels per day of petroleum products last year. [US refineries are
already geared as much as they can be to US shale]{.underline}, said
Matt Smith, director of commodity research at ClipperData. \"[They are
maxed out]{.underline},\" Smith said. That\'s why [US oil exports have
spiked](https://money.cnn.com/2018/07/12/investing/oil-exports-trade-war-china/index.html)
since Congress lifted an export ban. Gulf Coast refineries simply can\'t
process all that shale oil, so it gets sent to Europe, China and South
America. [Beyond the crude it ships directly to the United States, Saudi
Arabia has unmatched influence in world oil market. The kingdom is known
as the central bank of oil.]{.underline} Mere words from Saudi Arabia\'s
oil minister can send prices surging or tumbling. [Saudi Arabia\'s
enormous sway is derived from the belief that it\'s the only major oil
producer with the [firepower to quickly ramp up oil
production](https://money.cnn.com/2018/07/10/investing/oil-prices-saudi-arabia-spare-capacity/index.html).
That so-called spare capacity gives Saudi Arabia vast power, especially
now]{.underline}. \"That\'s where Saudi Arabia\'s real power comes.
It\'s not the cargo arriving at the terminal,\" said McNally.
Instability in Venezuela has sent its oil exports crashing. And
President Donald Trump\'s [sanctions on
Iran](http://money.cnn.com/2018/05/08/investing/oil-prices-trump-iran-sanctions/index.html)
could knock out 1.7 million barrels per day of exports around the world,
according to Societe Generale. [In theory, Saudi Arabia could maintain
its shipments of oil to the United States but still wreak havoc by
announcing plans to cut overall production.]{.underline} [Saudi Arabia
[released a statement on
Sunday](http://www.cnn.com/2018/10/14/investing/saudi-arabia-stocks-khashoggi/index.html)
warning that **sanctions would be met with \"greater
action.\"**]{.underline} The statement reminded the world that the
kingdom \"has an influential and vital role in the global economy.\"
\"There is [little doubt that Saudi Arabia has the ability to
single-handedly engineer another \'oil shock]{.underline},\'\" Caroline

[Oil dependency is another reason.]{.underline} Sometimes this idea is

out it's a lot]{.underline}. But we did not only find the existence of a
direct oil-for-weapons relationship. [Our results also reveal the
presence of a "global oil dependence". The more a country depends on oil
imports, the higher the incentives are to export weapons to oil-rich
economies,]{.underline} even in the absence of a direct bilateral
oil-for-weapons exchange. The idea is that [by providing weapons, the
oil-dependent country seeks to contain the risk of instabilities in an
oil-rich country.]{.underline} Our results point consistently toward the
conclusion that **the arms trade is an effective foreign policy tool to
secure and maintain access to oil**. As such, the arms trade reveals
national interests beyond simple economic considerations and the volume
of bilateral arms transfers can be used as a barometer of political
relations between the supplier and the recipient states. At the same
time, [we find that oil might play an even larger role in influencing
economic and political decisions than is generally
acknowledged]{.underline}.

According to the [2018 BP Statistical Review of World
Energy](https://www.bp.com/en/global/corporate/energy-economics/statistical-review-of-world-energy.html),
[in 2017 Saudi Arabia produced 12 million barrels of oil per day. That

is in the range of the world\'s two other major oil production
superpowers \-- Russia and the U.S. However, there is an [important
distinction when it comes to Saudi Arabia. In Russia, oil production is
concentrated among a dozen or so companies. In the U.S., thousands of
companies]{.underline} acting in their own self-interest produce oil.
But [in Saudi Arabia, all of the oil production is controlled by Saudi
Aramco]{.underline}, the state-owned oil company and [reportedly the

oil price movements since 2014. Oil prices plunged because Saudi Arabia
sought to win market share back from the shale oil producers. So, OPEC
flooded the market with oil, which sent prices down by over 70%. Then,
when they decided that experiment wasn\'t working, Saudi Arabia
convinced OPEC and Russia to cut oil production to support prices. Oil
prices doubled. Just this week oil prices fell by 5% after Saudi Arabia
said it would cover any supply disruptions from the sanctions on Iran\'s
petroleum exports. No other entity in the world has as much power to
move the oil markets. [Saudi Arabia could quickly bring the global

the economy isn't bad, but citizens are divided,\" says Ian Bremmer,
president of Eurasia Group. "**[Governments aren't doing much governing.
And the global order is unraveling]{.underline}.\" [What happens if
there is some kind of reckoning]{.underline}**[?]{.underline} Say if
Wall Street hit a 2008-like wall, China's debt meltdown arrived or
Washington started a trade war. A major terrorist attack, conflict on
the Korean peninsula, [**confrontation in the South China Sea or
troubles in Iran or Pakistan could slam markets**.]{.underline} At the
same moment, "**[the scale of the world's political challenges is
daunting]{.underline}**\", Bremmer says. "Liberal democracies have less
legitimacy than at any time since World War II, and most of their
structural problems don't appear fixable. [**Today's strongest leaders
show little interest in civil society or common values**.]{.underline}\"
Looking at the past two decades, if his team "had to pick one year for a
big unexpected crisis---**[the geopolitical equivalent of the 2008
financial meltdown---it feels like 2018]{.underline}**,\" Bremmer says.
**[Summers worries geopolitics and economics will
collide]{.underline}**. "Financial markets are widely cited, including
by US President Donald Trump, as providing comfort in the current

have catastrophic political consequences, sweeping into power even more
toxic populist nationalists]{.underline}**.\" Asia learned a great deal
from its 1997-98 meltdown. Banks were strengthened, currencies became
more flexible, central banks amassed ample currency reserves and
governments increased transparency. After that 2013 "taper tantrum,\"
India, for example, worked to stabilize the rupee, tame inflation and
address bad loans in the banking system. The West learned far less from
the 2008 Lehman Brothers crash, throwing money at the problem, but
demurring on painful reforms. **[Banks are re-leveraging as we

approximately 2008, [the historic decline in]{.underline} the number and
lethality of [wars appears to have been **reversed**]{.underline}.
Today's wars are not like World War I, with formal declarations of war,
clear war zones, rules of engagement, and definite endings. But they are
wars nonetheless. [What does a world in **global, generalized war look
like?**]{.underline} We have an unwinnable "war on terror" that is
metastasizing with every escalation, and which has blurred the
boundaries between war and everything else. We have [deep
states]{.underline}\-\--built on a new oligarchy of generals, spies, and
private-sector suppliers\-\--that [are strangling
liberalism]{.underline}. We have **[emboldened middle
powers]{.underline}** (such as Saudi Arabia) [and revanchist powers
(such as Russia) rearming and taking unilateral military
action]{.underline} across borders (Ukraine and Syria). We have massive
profiteering from conflicts by the arms industry, as well as through the
corruption and organized crime that follow in their wake (Afghanistan).
We have impoverishment and starvation through economic warfare, the
worst case being Yemen. We have "peacekeeping" forces fighting wars
(Somalia). We have [regional rivals threatening one another, some with
**nuclear weapons**]{.underline} (India and Pakistan) [and others with
possibilities of acquiring them]{.underline} (Saudi Arabia and Iran).
Above all, today's [generalized war is a conflict of
destabilization]{.underline}, with big powers intervening in the
domestic politics of others, buying influence in their security
establishments, bribing their way to big commercial contracts and
thereby corroding respect for government, and manipulating public
opinion through the media. Washington, D.C., and Moscow each does this
in its own way. Put the pieces together and [a global political market
of rival plutocracies comes into view. Add **virulent reactionary
populism**]{.underline} to the mix [and it resembles a war on
democracy]{.underline}. What more might we see? Economic liberalism is a
creed of optimism and abundance; reactionary protectionism feeds on
pessimistic scarcity. [If we see **punitive trade wars**]{.underline}
and national leaders taking preemptive action to secure strategic
resources within the walls of their garrison states, then old-fashioned
[territorial disputes]{.underline} along with accelerated
state-commercial grabbing of land and minerals [are in
prospect]{.underline}. We could see mobilization against immigrants and
minorities as a way of enflaming and rewarding a constituency that can
police borders, enforce the new political rightness, and even become
electoral vigilantes. [Liberal multilateralism is]{.underline} a system
of **[seeking common wins through peaceful negotiation]{.underline}**;
case-by-case power dealing is a zero-sum calculus. [We may see
**regional arms races, nuclear proliferation**]{.underline}, and
opportunistic power coalitions to exploit the weak. In such a global
political marketplace, we would see middle-ranking and junior states
rewarded for the toughness of their bargaining, and foreign policy and
security strategy delegated to the CEOs of oil companies, defense
contractors, bankers, and real estate magnates. The United Nations
system appeals to leaders to live up to the highest standards. The fact
that they so often conceal their transgressions is the tribute that vice
pays to virtue. [A cabal of plutocratic populists would]{.underline}
revel in the opposite: [applaud]{.underline}ing [one another's readiness
to tear up cosmopolitan liberalism]{.underline} and pursue a latter-day
mercantilist naked self-interest. [**Garrison America**
could]{.underline} opportunistically [collude with]{.underline}
similarly constituted political-military business [regimes in Russia,
China, Turkey]{.underline}, and elsewhere for a new realpolitik global
concert, redolent of the early nineteenth-century era of the Congress of
Vienna, [bringing a façade of stability for as long as they
collude\-\--and **war when they fall out**]{.underline}. And there is a
danger that, in response to a terrorist outrage or an international
political crisis, President Trump will do something stupid, just as
Europe's leaders so unthinkingly strolled into World War I. The
multilateral security system is in poor health and may not be able to
cope. Underpinning this is a simple truth: [the plutocratic populist
order is a **future that does not work**]{.underline}. If illustration
were needed of the logic of hiding under the blanket rather than facing
difficult realities, look no further than Trump's readiness to deny
climate change. We have been here before, more or less, and from history
we can gather important lessons about what we must do now. [The

#### Rise of populism destroys international relations, makes it easier to justify wars, Trump and the United States proves.

Mikhail Gorbachev, former president of the Soviet Union, has no doubts:
A new nuclear arms race has begun, he writes in an opinion piece for the
New York Times. He should know what he's talking about. He is the man
who signed with President Reagan in 1987 the I.N.F. treaty, **one of the
major arms non-proliferation treaties**. For Europe, it is the most
important since it aims at eliminating the arsenal of intermediate and
shorter-range missiles. Back then, Gorbachev was at the helm of a dying
Soviet Union shaken by the fall of the Berlin Wall, and he, more than
anyone, believed in a new age of peace and international cooperation. He
famously talked of a "Common European Home" and hoped to bring Russia
inside Europe as an equal partner. That did not happen and the rise of
Putin put paid to those hopes. In that article, Gorbachev reminds us
that the I.N.F. treaty was followed by two more important ones, the
Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty (a.k.a. Start 1, signed in 1991 by
George H.W. Bush) and the New Start Treaty (2010 signed by Obama). By
2015, The US and Russia were able to report at the United Nations
Nuclear Nonproliferation Review Conference that 85% of the arms had been
retired and mostly destroyed. An amazing success that Trump, another
Republican President, is about to reverse. Predictably, Russia is
accused of violations, the standard way to break off treaties. And yet,
the Republican party was not always the party of the military-industrial
complex, a notion another Republican President warned America against:
It was Eisenhower, in his farewell address in 1961, who identified the
threat and famously coined that phrase. In the Trump era of America
First, it's hard to remember that just three decades ago, in the 1980s,
there were politicians who had genuine liberal, progressive ideas --
even in the Soviet Union that after 70 years of dictatorship looked like
a hopeless case. Especially in the Soviet Union which, as events showed
with Gorbachev's Perestroika, was ready for a dramatic change, putting
its Communist past and the Cold War in the dustbin of History. Now,
History's dustbin is about to be emptied on the world stage, **bringing
the Cold War back.** Firebrand John Bolton, Trump's National Security
adviser (appointed last April) is having his moment of glory. A former
U.S.Ambassador to the United Nations (under Bush), Bolton has always
hated international treaties in general and the United Nations in
particular. His fondest memory, he recalls in his 2007 memoir, was to
pull the U.S. out of the International Criminal Court treaty. No matter
the Court presented no particular danger to American sovereignty and
that it was a major step forward for international law and justice.
Bolton is an uncompromising hawk. For him the world is a jungle, justice
is for sissies and the U.S. needs to be top dog. Now he is pushing Trump
to withdraw from all international treaties -- including further
blocking the ICC and even moving out of some minor treaties like the
Universal Postal Union, a 144 year-old postal treaty run by the United
Nations, accusing it of letting China ship goods at an unfair discount.
That was done last week. The fact that the ICC, as per its mandate,
cannot prosecute any American without the consent of an American court
is not mentioned by John Bolton or anyone in the Trump administration.
They all prefer to present the ICC as illegitimate and a threat to
American sovereignty. They do not accept the simple fact that the ICC is
a UN body and therefore not illegitimate; and that it is never a threat
to a country that respects international law and justice. And America
used to be a paladin of justice but with populists in power, that has
changed. Trump's priority now is moving out of nuclear arms treaties --
and that fits in nicely with his military build-up strategy. Let's tick
off the ways Trump has gone about re-militarizing the U.S.: Pumping up
the defense budget to a historic high of \$717 billion, even though
America has always spent more than the rest of the world combined on
military expenditures; of special note: \$21.9 billion for the
Department of Energy's nuclear weapons programs that includes research
and testing Getting out of the 2015 deal to limit Iran's nuclear
activities And now systematically pulling out of all remaining
non-proliferation arms deals To be fair to Trump, the U.S. had already
pulled out of the Antiballistic Missile Treaty in 2002. That was done by
the Bush administration without a good explanation, much to the dismay
of the Federation of American Scientists, an association created in 1945
by the scientists who built the first atomic bomb. Their 2001 letter of
protest to Congress ended with the following words that apply equally
well to all the treaties that Trump is seeking to undo: "America has
always sought to lead the world by example. Yet if other countries were
to follow the example we have just set, the framework of international
law would disintegrate. President Bush has just released NMD's first
shot, and it has landed squarely in the heart of American security."
Bolton's trip this week in Russia was clearly intended to lay the ground
to kill off the I.N.F. arms treaty, much to Putin's barely concealed
amusement. This is exactly what makes Putin happy: He gets a green light
from Trump to go ahead with building up his military arsenal, and takes
none of the blame. The military build-up is entirely Trump's. Bolton's
visit was relatively "friendly" and ended with an invitation to Putin to
visit Washington in "early" 2019. Before then, Trump and Putin will see
each other in Paris on 11 November, on the sidelines of the 100-year
anniversary of World War I armistice. But Bolton stood his ground and
warned Russia "not to mess with American elections", threatening more
sanctions to address Russia's interference in its elections and its
annexation of Crimea. What we get here is the American side of the
story. But what is interesting is to look at the Russian side. Putin
lays bare his thoughts, detailing the danger for Europe in the course of
a recent press conference (25 October -- Italian Prime Minister Conte
was on a state visit). Should Europe worry? Judge for yourself. Putin
puts it in very clear terms: The question is, he says, what will the
Americans do with the new missiles they plan to build? Deliver them to
Europe? If they do so, Russia will have no choice but to enter the arms
race...Then he makes it even clearer: The European countries that agree
to host American missiles need to realize that "they put their own
territories under the threat of a strike response". No matter how you
interpret Putin's statement or Trump's breaking off arms treaties, there
is little doubt that the Cold War will soon be back. Whether it will be
as cold as the original one remains to be seen. But one thing is
certain, **populism's obsession with national sovereignty** is a source
of tension, if not of out-and-out war. At least not yet.

with the oil-price rollercoaster in recent months, and OPEC's subsequent
efforts to fix the market by adjusting the amount of oil it pumps,
illustrates the frustration many in Washington feel when they see what
looks like a huge U.S. energy boom failing to deliver on promises of
dominance or independence. But [the reality is that the notion of energy
dominance, as repeatedly trumpeted by the administration, is at heart a
hollow idea]{.underline}. Even America's position as the top producer in
the world isn't enough to shield it from rising prices, free it from
Middle East entanglements, strangle foes with sanctions, or even give it
many additional foreign-policy tools. [The ultimate irony is that what
created the U.S. energy revolution---nimble, private-sector companies
using new technologies to extract previously untapped crude---keeps the
United States from wielding its energy strength in the way that Saudi
Arabia, Russia, and other big producers]{.underline} with state-owned
firms willing to put geopolitics above profits do. "Ironically, the
precise strength of the U.S. energy sector---that it is driven by the
market and not by a government---also means that it is not a stick to
beat people with," said Bruce Jones, the director of the foreign-policy
program at the Brookings Institution. Nobody can deny the historic size
and speed of America's transformation from energy importer to major
producer and exporter in its own right. The United States currently
[produces](https://www.eia.gov/outlooks/steo/report/us_oil.php) 11.4
million barrels per day, with forecasts of more than 12 million barrels
a day next year. Since the beginning of the shale boom a decade ago, the
United States has essentially discovered the resource equivalent of
another Iran and a Kuwait trapped in Texas and North Dakota shale
formations. "It's a stunning turnaround, and it has enormous benefits
economically and to some extent geopolitically," said Jason Bordoff, the
director of Columbia University's Center on Global Energy Policy. The
economic benefits, at least, are a little clearer. By producing more oil
and importing less from abroad, the energy boom helps U.S. GDP by
keeping dollars at home. And it helps shrink the trade deficit---a
[dividend](https://ihsmarkit.com/Info/1118/trading-places-shale-revolution.html)
of about \$250 billion compared to where the United States would have
been without the shale boom, according to a new study from the
consultancy IHS Markit. At the same time, all those extra barrels of
American oil sloshing around, even if they aren't physically exported,
keep the world as a whole better supplied, meaning that nasty
geopolitical surprises cause fewer price spikes than in years past.
Jones called U.S. production an "important shock absorber" for the
global economy. And there are some foreign-policy benefits to newfound
U.S. energy dominance, if not quite the bonanza many boosters seem to
still expect. U.S. natural gas production and exports have limited
Russia's ability to gouge customers among U.S. allies in Europe, even if
Moscow is still increasing its market share there. And the fact that the
United States produces and even exports record amounts of oil gives it a
different way to engage with neighbors such as Mexico, which once feared
American designs on its black gold. "It liberates our foreign policy to
deal with other issues," said David Goldwyn, the head of Goldwyn Global
Strategies, an energy consultancy. "In that sense, it's a positive, for
the flexibility it provides." But none of that makes the United States
immune to oil-price shocks or able to impose its will on other
countries---or even able to add many arrows to its geopolitical quiver.
Regardless of how much oil America produces, it's still a global oil
market. That means that prices for gasoline in the United States are
largely determined by what happens with the other almost 90 million
barrels of oil produced and consumed every day around the world. And
[the United States is even more vulnerable than most countries to sudden
pain at the pump, due to low taxes on fuel. That makes the up-and-down
price of crude an even bigger driver of U.S. gasoline prices than in
other countries,]{.underline} noted Goldwyn, who was a top State
Department energy official in the Obama administration. The [biggest
reality check for policymakers bewitched by America's record levels of
oil production is that sheer size doesn't matter that much. Saudi Arabia
produces less oil every day than the United States, but it **plays an
immeasurably bigger role in the world oil market than America does or
ever will.** That's because Saudi Arabia has most of the world's spare
production capacity, millions of barrels of oil that can quickly be
brought on line]{.underline} (or shut down) as the government orders to
keep prices around an elusive Goldilocks level. [That ability to open or
close the oil spigot on demand is "real leverage,]{.underline}" said
Bordoff, who was a White House energy advisor in the Obama
administration. "And that's not something the United States has, or
likely ever will. [Real influence stems not just from how much you
produce, but from the ability to quickly add or subtract supplies, and
really that is only Saudi Arabia."]{.underline}

U.S. crude oil and energy product exports surged to an all-time high in
the third week of June, making the country a net exporter of oil and
products for the third time since November 2018. This change lends
credence to American officials' presumption that amid growing U.S.-Iran
tensions in the Persian Gulf, Washington is less compelled to police oil
transit routes in the region, especially the Strait of Hormuz, than it
was during the 1980s. However, [while the U.S. is less reliant on oil
imports than in the past, it still remains dependent on Gulf
producers]{.underline}, albeit in different ways. It's clear that
America's shale oil boom and its new status as an oil exporter --- after
many years of relying on Gulf oil supplies --- have changed the way the
U.S. perceives its role in the security of the region. As Air Force
General Paul J. Selva, the vice chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff,
[told reporters
recently](https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/energy/iran-exposes-oils-sea-change-in-the-persian-gulf/2019/06/20/66040ffc-9365-11e9-956a-88c291ab5c38_story.html?utm_term=.e9db2c59ecef),
"[We are not wholly dependent on the movement of Saudi, Kuwaiti, Qatari,
and Emirati oil in and out of the Gulf to sustain our economy." U.S.
President Donald Trump echoed this sentiment later]{.underline},
[tweeting
that](https://twitter.com/realdonaldtrump/status/1143128646162493441),
"We don't even need to be there in that the U.S. has just become by far
the largest producer of energy in the world." [Trump's exaggerations and
falsehoods aside, this new perception of U.S. oil independence, based on
its surging production of shale oil, overlooks many facts about shale
and the complex reality of the new interdependencies facing the U.S.
today.]{.underline} First, it is true that the U.S. is less dependent on
the Gulf for its energy supplies than it was previously. However,
[despite becoming an occasional net exporter of oil, it **still needs to
import certain grades of crude oil**, namely medium and heavy. Unlike
the light shale grades, these grades are in high demand by U.S.
refineries.]{.underline} Second, [the nature and limitations of shale
oil create other dependencies, even as production continues to
grow]{.underline}. For instance, since shale oil production is
controlled by corporations with no government influence over the volume
of production, it is up to outside producers, mainly in the Gulf, to
moderate oil prices in the U.S. So while Trump can tout U.S. "energy
independence," he has no influence over shale production --- whether up
or down. Instead, he finds himself calling on his allies in OPEC to
intervene whenever oil prices become uncomfortable for U.S. consumers.
Another fact about shale that is often ignored --- whether purposely or
unwittingly --- is how much there is and how long it will last.
According to the best estimates, at some point in the next 5-10 years,
shale oil will plateau and eventually the production curve will be
reversed. Securing supplies from the Gulf might not be as important as
it was in terms of volume right now, but [it would be short-sighted to
base a strategy for regional presence or engagement on short-term
sufficiency. By the time the U.S. determines that it needs to step in
again, the reality on the ground might have changed, with new actors
taking on a central role in Middle East oil diplomacy]{.underline}. One
of the consequences of the U.S. becoming a major oil producer and
exporter is the emergence of a new paradigm in oil diplomacy, one that
has implications for the U.S. role in the Gulf. In order to ensure that
producers' interests are not negatively impacted by the surge in shale
oil production and exports, a new alliance was forged between the two
major oil producers, Russia and Saudi Arabia. The Saudi-Russian
coordination to control the volumes of crude oil on the market and to
deal with any glut or oversupply that may impact their revenues is a new
shift in world oil diplomacy that was unthinkable pre-shale. Ironically,
this was also unthinkable during the Cold War era of the 1980s, when the
U.S. helped protect Gulf oil supplies to prevent the then Soviet Union
from gaining a foothold in the region. Today, Gulf producers must
balance their relations with both the U.S., their security ally, and
Russia, their oil market ally. The Trump administration's false
perception of energy independence has gone beyond just questioning the
extent to which it needs to be involved in ensuring the security of
supply from the Middle East to global markets: It has now taken to
actively using oil in its foreign policy as well. Trump's emboldened
foreign policy is inextricably tied to America's newfound status as an
exporter of oil and gas. Being less dependent on outside supplies is
what enabled the U.S. to use oil as a tool --- or even a weapon. The
U.S. can afford to impose sanctions on multiple major producers at the
same time and curb exports from Iran and Venezuela, all without concern
that it will suffer a shortfall. However, while the U.S. might be less
dependent on oil supplies from those countries, shale has resulted in
new dependencies as well. [The U.S. cannot carry out this aggressive
foreign policy without relying on its Gulf allies,]{.underline} who
become the backbone of such policies, [underpinning any implications on
world oil markets]{.underline}. U.S.-imposed sanctions removed at least
half of Iran's 2.5 million barrels per day of crude oil exports in the
first half of this year and are targeting the remainder, with the
ultimate aim of bringing them down to zero. Removing that much oil from
the market would have pushed prices too high if it weren't for Gulf
producers, which have assured the U.S. that they will make sure the
market is well supplied at all times. [Without the cushion that Gulf oil
producers, mainly Saudi Arabia and the UAE, provide in dealing with any
shortfall in supply, **the U.S. would face skyrocketing oil
prices.**]{.underline}

**[U.S. restraint also limits the spread of technology, which dampens
global arms races and slows the spread of dangerous advanced weapons
technology, which will eventually diffuse to American
adversaries]{.underline}.** And of course, **[it prevents the emergence
of competitors]{.underline}**, which makes good economic sense as well.
Historically, the United States has practiced "unilateral restraint" by
foregoing exporting its highest-capability weapons to a region until a
viable competing product emerges; for example, refusing to deliver
advanced medium-range air-to-air missiles to Asian states until China
purchased the Russian equivalent R-77. More broadly[, **the United
States, more than any other exporter, jealously guards against the
spread of weapons know-how even to its closest allies**]{.underline}
(often arms exporters themselves[). **A case in point is Turkey's effort
to acquire foreign long-range air and anti-missile defense systems,
hoping to acquire the underlying technology and eventually become a
major arms exporter itself. The U.S.-made Patriot system was eliminated
from consideration because most of its technology would not be given
to** Turkey.]{.underline} Announcing the ultimate deal with Russia,
Turkey's presidential spokesman was frank: "The price difference could
have been manageable. But the issue of technology transfer was more
important. On this issue, our allies, including the United States,
caused a big disappointment." [**The United States, again because of its
market power, can afford this restraint in order to maintain its global
technological dominance**.]{.underline}

Iran a mortal foe. The
[suspicion](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/2347798916664613)
that Iran is building a bomb exacerbates the Saudis' sense of
threat.]{.underline} Tehran's most recent moves will likely heighten
that fear --- and push Riyadh to accelerate the development of its
nuclear program. [Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman
[warned,](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/saudi-crown-prince-mohammed-bin-salman-iran-nuclear-bomb-saudi-arabia/)
"Without a doubt if Iran developed a nuclear bomb, we will follow suit
as soon as possible."]{.underline} For now, [Saudi Arabia is focused on
becoming]{.underline} what
[scholars](https://www.mitpressjournals.org/doi/abs/10.1162/ISEC_a_00268)
call [a nuclear "hedger" --- a country without a dedicated nuclear
weapons program that can [weaponize relatively
quickly](https://www.mitpressjournals.org/doi/abs/10.1162/01622880260553633)]{.underline},
thanks to an advanced enrichment and reprocessing (ENR) capability. Iran
has already achieved this
[status](https://www.palgrave.com/gp/book/9781137273086). Hedging stems
from the fact that the military and civilian uses of the atom are [not
completely
separable](https://books.google.de/books?id=FjMqBQAAQBAJ&lpg=PA33&ots=Sc0LBVBmYv&dq=military%20and%20civilian%20uses%20of%20the%20atom%20two%20sides%20of%20the%20same%20coin&pg=PP1#v=onepage&q=military%20and%20civilian%20uses%20of%20the%20atom%20two%20sides%20of%20the%20same%20coin&f=false).
ENR facilities can fuel nuclear reactors and/or they can produce fissile
material for a bomb. Hedging also allows countries to avoid the
[costs](https://press.princeton.edu/titles/8554.html) of a nuclear
program, including international
[sanctions](https://www.mitpressjournals.org/doi/abs/10.1162/ISEC_a_00293),

[block](https://www.mitpressjournals.org/doi/pdf/10.1162/ISEC_a_00205)
Riyadh's access to sensitive nuclear transfers, such as enrichment
technology? It's possible Saudi Arabia will be unable to acquire or
develop the [wherewithal for a nuclear
weapon.](https://foreignpolicy.com/2019/02/22/whos-afraid-of-saudi-nukes-123-kashoggi-mbs-russia-china/)
But the nuclear market is changing in ways that facilitate
proliferation. There's been a shift from a [unipolar
world](https://www.cambridge.org/core/books/theory-of-unipolar-politics/8B28E1C45E984540EAF6E15683E11856),
with the United States as the dominant power, to a world of several
great powers, or
[multipolarity](https://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctv5cgb1w). Since 1975,
the key instrument for curbing nuclear transfers has been the supplier
cartel --- the Nuclear Suppliers Group (NSG), created by the [United
States in cooperation with the
Soviets](https://carnegieendowment.org/2017/12/14/more-geopoliticized-nuclear-suppliers-group-pub-75027).
The NSG forced suppliers to act in unison and [incorporate the same
guidelines](https://college.harvard.edu/college-events/curbing-nuclear-latency-how-international-agreements-promote-benign-nuclear)
into their individual nuclear export policies, restricting the sale of
ENR and thus stemming
[proliferation](https://doi.org/10.1177/0738894214559672). Here's the
catch: The NSG's ability to regulate supplier behavior depends on how
many great powers are in the system and whether they agree to [work
together to limit proliferation](https://doi.org/10.1086/682080). The
[emerging multipolar
world](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/monkey-cage/wp/2019/02/08/there-isnt-a-new-cold-war-with-china-for-these-4-reasons/?utm_term=.2066a4c0aa3b)
and the growing rivalry among the United States, Russia and China is
likely to weaken the NSG's effectiveness. This could crack open the door
to renewed supplier competition and broader access to sensitive nuclear
technologies. And this lets countries interested in acquiring nuclear
transfers, such as Saudi Arabia, pit suppliers against each other and
secure better products, lower prices and more advantageous terms of use.
As [Matthew
Fuhrmann](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2019/02/21/trump-administration-wants-sell-nuclear-technology-saudis-without-nuclear-agreement-thats-alarming/?utm_term=.56dfac820c2e)
explained here in the Monkey Cage, there remains debate over whether
peaceful nuclear technology transfers lead to proliferation --- but the
risk of proliferation is high in the Saudi case. Saudi Arabia has set
its nuclear procurement train in motion [After failing to secure nuclear
technology in the 1970s, Riyadh turned to the global market with renewed
vigor in the mid-2000s --- in both cases presumably because of a
perceived Iranian nuclear threat.]{.underline} Recent efforts to exploit
supplier competition seem to have paid off: [In 2015, Saudi Arabia
acquired a research reactor from
[Argentina](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-04-03/first-images-of-saudi-nuclear-reactor-show-plant-nearing-finish),
a steppingstone toward achieving the full nuclear fuel cycle
capability.]{.underline} Saudi authorities have also expressed an
interest in [nuclear power
reactors](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-saudi-nuclear/saudi-plans-to-invite-bids-for-nuclear-power-project-in-2020-sources-idUSKCN1RG1LL)and

Reactors alone are not enough to build a nuclear weapon, but can provide
[cover](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/00963402.1983.11458937?journalCode=rbul20)
for a nuclear weapons program or for hedging: Countries can claim they
need ENR technology to fuel their research or power reactors, but
instead use it to produce fissile material for a bomb. Moving forward,
[Saudi Arabia can play several suppliers against one another to secure
nuclear transfers. Countries such as [France and South
Korea](https://www.oxfordenergy.org/wpcms/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/GCC-East-Asia-Relations-in-the-Fields-of-Nuclear-and-Renewable-Energy-MEP-14.pdf)
have expressed an interest in selling nuclear technology to Riyadh for
almost a decade. And Saudi Arabia has excellent relations with Pakistan,
whose nuclear weapons program Riyadh [allegedly helped
finance](https://isis-online.org/uploads/isis-reports/documents/SaudiArabiaProliferationRisks_30Mar2017_Final.pdf)
in the 1970s.]{.underline} Fearing that other suppliers will get Saudi
Arabia's nuclear contracts, [the United States, Russia and
China](https://thebulletin.org/2019/04/the-trump-administration-is-eager-to-sell-nuclear-reactors-to-saudi-arabia-but-why/)
have also begun courting Riyadh. There are few good options for dealing
with Saudi Arabia's nuclear procurement plans Some analysts argue that
the United States should transfer nuclear technology to the Saudis on
the condition they adopt the "[gold
standard](https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/economy/pompeo-saudis-must-not-enrich-uranium-if-it-seeks-civilian-nuclear-cooperation/2018/05/24/714c5e30-5f92-11e8-a4a4-c070ef53f315_story.html?utm_term=.0089283f02a6),"
which would require the Saudi regime to forfeit its right to enrich or
reprocess. The problem here is that other countries could make more
lenient counteroffers. Recognizing this issue, others propose that
Washington should supply Saudi Arabia nuclear technology [without the
"gold
standard"](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/0163660X.2018.1484224)
constraints, thus keeping a foot in the door and hopefully becoming
well-positioned to limit Riyadh's nuclear pursuits. But even this
approach may prove too restricting for the Saudis. [If Saudi Arabia
concludes that the United States is encroaching on its nuclear
ambitions, it can turn to other suppliers for more advantageous
terms.]{.underline} The Trump administration has embraced a [more
permissive](https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/trump-administration-authorized-nuclear-energy-companies-to-share-technological-information-with-saudi-arabia/2019/03/28/1b5f0816-5180-11e9-8d28-f5149e5a2fda_story.html?utm_term=.bab4b8fc289c)
nuclear transfers policy toward Saudi Arabia than the "no gold standard"
approach --- and has signaled its willingness to approve such transfers
without congressional approval. As
[Fuhrmann](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2019/02/21/trump-administration-wants-sell-nuclear-technology-saudis-without-nuclear-agreement-thats-alarming/?utm_term=.9a6851d31e75)
explained, such an approach is particularly dangerous for containing the
bomb. The problem for those hoping to stop the further spread of nuclear
weapons is that it's hard to get the great powers to cooperate. Instead,
the United States, Russia and China are developing their own unilateral
policies on Saudi Arabia. [With the 2015 nuclear deal unraveling and
Iran accelerating its enrichment efforts**, the future does not bode
well for stopping Riyadh from going down the same path as
Tehran.**]{.underline}

that satellite photos show a containment vessel for atomic fuel at the
reactor site in Riyadh. [The report notes the " advancement is alarming
to arms-control experts because Saudi Arabia has yet to sign up to the
international framework of rules other nuclear powers follow to ensure
that civilian atomic programs aren't used to build
weapons.\"]{.underline} U.S. senators from both parties on Tuesday asked
Energy Secretary Rick Perry for details about recent approvals for
companies to share nuclear energy information with Saudi Arabia, with
[the lawmakers expressing concern about possible development of atomic
weapons. Saudi Arabia has engaged in \"many deeply troubling actions and
statements that have provoked alarm in Congress,]{.underline}\" Senators
Bob Menendez, a Democrat, and Marco Rubio, a Republican, told Perry in a
letter, a copy of which was seen by Reuters. [The senators said Congress
was beginning to reevaluate the U.S.-Saudi relationship,]{.underline}
and they believe Washington should not be providing nuclear technology
or information to Saudi Arabia now. The Trump administration has been
quietly negotiating a deal that would potentially help Saudi Arabia
build two reactors. Last week news reports revealed that since November
2017, Perry has authorized so-called Part 810 approvals allowing U.S.
companies to share sensitive nuclearinformation with the kingdom. The
approvals were kept from the public and from Congress. The senators
asked Perry to provide them by April 10 with the names of the companies
that got the 810 approvals, what was in the authorizations, and why the
companies asked that the approvals be kept secret. While 810 agreements
are routine, the Obama administration made them available for the public
to read at Energy Department headquarters. Lawmakers say the department
is legally required to inform Congress about the approvals. [Perry
approved the seven recent authorizations as the administration has tried
to hash out nonproliferation standards with Saudi Arabia. Such a pact,
known as a 123 agreement, would have to be agreed before U.S. companies
can share physical exports of materials and equipment to build reactors.
The kingdom has resisted standards on reprocessing spent fuel and
enriching uranium, two potential paths to making nuclear weapons. The
United States has been competing with South Korea, France, Russia and
China on a potential deal to help build reactors in Saudi Arabia. The
kingdom is expected to announce the winner this year.]{.underline}
Lawmakers from both parties have been concerned about Saudi Arabia\'s
bombing campaigns in Yemen, which is on the brink of famine, and the
killing of journalist Jamal Khashoggi, a U.S. resident, last October in
the Saudi consulate in Istanbul. Concern in Congress grew last year
after the kingdom\'s Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman told CBS that
\"Saudi Arabia does not want to acquire any nuclearbomb, but without a
doubt if Iran developed a nuclear bomb, we will follow suit as soon as
possible.\" Perry has said the 810 approvals were kept from the public
for corporate proprietary reasons. He has also said that **[if Saudi
Arabia relies on China or Russia for building nuclear reactors those two
countries don\'t give a \"tinker\'s damn\" about
non-proliferation.]{.underline}** Many non-proliferation experts dispute
the notion that a deal with China or Russia would be riskier. These
people say the United States has many other levers it can pull to
influence nuclear behavior.

### Prolif Bad -- Domino Prolif

MTC.)

President Donald [Trump]{.underline} went dancing with the Saudi royals
in Riyadh, where he [tried to sell America's principles in exchange for
a mess of weapons contracts]{.underline}. Since then, Secretary of State
Mike Pompeo has become Saudi Arabia's lead PR counsel in America. The
Pentagon is the Saudi regime's premier armorer. [Now]{.underline} Energy
Secretary [Rick Perry is acting as chief nuclear procurer for the
Saudis. "By ramming through the sale of as much as \$80 billion in
nuclear power plants," The New York Times warned recently, "the Trump
administration would provide sensitive knowhow and materials to a
government whose de facto leader, Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, has
suggested that he may eventually want a nuclear weapon as a hedge
against Iran and has shown little concern for what the rest of the world
thinks."]{.underline} Obviously, [Trump has not endorsed a Saudi nuclear
weapon. However, his administration's ongoing attempt to provide the
Kingdom with nuclear technology raises serious questions about U.S.
policy. America's]{.underline} relationship with Riyadh has long been
fraught with tension, inconsistency, and hypocrisy. The [faux friendship
revolves around oil]{.underline}, the lifeblood of the Western economy.
[However, the fracking revolution turned the U.S. into an energy
super-supplier, and]{.underline} other hydrocarbon sources have since
emerged. And [if Washington stopped routinely sanctioning other
governments for not following its dictates, oil producers such as Iran,
Russia, and Venezuela would be supplying international markets, further
reducing Riyadh's importance.]{.underline} American officials like to
promote the Saudis' antediluvian absolute monarchy as the foundation for
Middle East stability. Alas, the price is unrivaled repression[. Despite
the crown prince's reputation as a social reformer, he so far has not
relaxed the Kingdom's totalitarian political or religious controls one
bit.]{.underline} And that brutality has not guaranteed stability.
[Saudi Arabia looks brittle, an artificial, antiquated governing
structure held together by tyranny and bribery. In time, it will likely
lose to demands for justice, equality, and democracy, which have doomed
a host of other corrupt, brutal, Mideast dictatorships, most recently
Sudan's Omar al-Bashir.]{.underline} Outside of the country, [Crown
Prince Mohammed bin Salman (MbS) has pursued a wild and reckless
strategy of regional domination.]{.underline} [Even]{.underline} Senator
Lindsey Graham, perhaps [the United States' most war-happy lawmaker, has
called MbS "crazy," "dangerous," and a "wrecking ball."]{.underline} The
KSA has backed radical Islamists in Syria, subsidized the al-Sisi
dictatorship in Egypt, kidnapped Lebanon's prime minister, used troops
to sustain Bahrain's dictatorial Sunni monarchy, isolated Qatar,
kidnapped and murdered Saudi critics in foreign nations, invaded Yemen,
intensified the Mideast's long-running sectarian conflict, and promoted
General Khalifa Haftar's attack on Libya's internationally recognized
government. [MbS is even willing to court war with Iran if he believes
it's necessary for regional domination.]{.underline} Moreover, the Saudi
royals are not Westerners in different dress. They have poured \$100
billion into the promotion of intolerant fundamentalist Wahhabism around
the world, including in Yemen, where a Saudi-Emirati coalition has
allied with radical jihadists against the Houthis, who had opposed
al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula. [Nuclear weapons would further
embolden MbS. Currently there is no active nuclear program.
Nevertheless, suspicions about Riyadh's intentions are legion. A decade
ago, King Abdullah bin Abdulaziz told U.S. officials that if Iran
acquired a nuke, "we will get nuclear weapons." Last year, MbS said, "If
Iran developed a nuclear bomb, we will follow suit as soon as
possible."]{.underline} Nevertheless, the Trump administration is
pushing the sale of nuclear technology to Saudi Arabia. And no one seems
to know what safeguards will be imposed and whether MbS will abide by
those limits. ["There's a legitimate question over whether such a
government could be trusted with nuclear energy and the potential
weaponization of it,"]{.underline} worries Senator Marco Rubio. Senator
Jeff Merkley agrees: ["The last thing America should do is inadvertently
help develop nuclear weapons for a bad actor on the world
stage."]{.underline} The two are pushing legislation that would give
Congress the final say over any sale. The transfer of nuclear reactors
is usually not controversial, so long as it's accompanied by a
cooperation agreement under Section 123 of the Atomic Energy Act. Deputy
Energy Secretary Dan Brouillette insists, "We won't allow them to bypass
123 if they want to have civilian nuclear power that includes U.S.
nuclear technologies." Legislators remain wary, however, complaining
that seven permits, called "Part 810 authorizations," have been issued
to firms to provide nuclear technology to Saudi Arabia without
notification to Congress. ["I believe the Saudis saw an opportunity with
Trump and \[son-in-law Jared\] Kushner to conclude this rapidly on their
terms, holding out the promise of major purchases," charges Thomas
Countryman, head of the Arms Control Association.]{.underline} In fact,
the Saudis, in contrast to the Emiratis, want to enrich uranium, which
offers a principal opportunity to divert nuclear materials for military
use. And Riyadh hasn't agreed to any weapons inspections. As a result,
[if the Saudis come to believe they "need" a bomb---and their criteria
might broaden over time---any peacetime program could automatically be
turned into one for military development.]{.underline} Admittedly,
America's refusal to deal might not stop Riyadh. Prince Turki al-Faisal
has pointed to China, France, Pakistan, and Russia as other options, a
point that's been echoed by administration officials. Even so,
Washington should not aid, even inadvertently, another nation,
especially such a repressive and aggressive power, in acquiring nuclear
weapons. The consequences would be grave, including to America's
nonproliferation credentials. Prince al-Faisal also pointedly included
"our friends in Pakistan" as a nuclear power option. But Islamabad could
provide more than peaceful energy. Riyadh might purchase weapons
directly from the cash-strapped and unstable Pakistan
government---especially since the Saudis financed the Pakistani nuclear
program. Doing so would cause an international furor, but for years,
A.Q. Khan, father of the Pakistani bomb, has essentially operated a
Nukes "R" Us open to the world. When confronted, Islamabad closed down
Khan's market, but with the right incentives it might be convinced to
accept another client. Six years ago, Israel's former head of military
intelligence, Amos Yadlin, claimed that Pakistan had already produced
and set aside weapons for Riyadh. Gary Samore, who advised President
Barack Obama on nonproliferation, observes, "I do think that the Saudis
believe that they have some understanding with Pakistan that, in
extremis, they would have claim to acquire nuclear weapons from
Pakistan." [The Trump administration's fixation on Iran has malformed
American policy towards the rest of the Mideast, including Saudi Arabia.
The United States should not take sides in the bitter Sunni-Shia rivalry
that lies beneath the Saudi-Iran conflict. It certainly shouldn't treat
Saudi Arabia as a permanent and trusted ally. The latter shares neither
values nor interests with the United States, and is aggressively
pursuing dangerous imperial ambitions. Washington should drop its
support for MbS's irresponsible policies and be on guard against the
Kingdom's possible acquisition of nuclear weapons. A Saudi bomb would
unsettle the region, guarantee a Middle Eastern nuclear arms race, and
encourage sectarian conflict. MbS can't be trusted with a bone saw, let
alone nukes.]{.underline}

U.S. Secretary of Energy Rick Perry and Saudi Energy Minister Khalid
al-Falih are about to meet in London to discuss a nuclear agreement that
would allow Riyadh to enrich uranium and extract plutonium in return for
American companies getting a chance to build nuclear reactors in Saudi
Arabia. Inevitably, comparisons will be made with the 2015 Iran nuclear
agreement, which permitted limited uranium enrichment. But the current
debate over this deal is missing the most important point: [The issue
isn't whether it's fair to constrain the Saudis more than the Iranians,
or whether there is an opportunity to revive U.S. nuclear manufacturing,
or to thwart Russian and Chinese influence in the Middle East. It's that
giving Riyadh a pass on tight nuclear nonproliferation rules would be
playing with fire.]{.underline} Despite its denials, [Saudi Arabia's
resistance to restrictions on uranium enrichment and plutonium
extraction amounts to a public declaration that the kingdom wants to
keep a nuclear weapons option open.]{.underline} This is certainly the
way Iran's program has been viewed. It's also why [Riyadh]{.underline}
wants this option; it [is engaged in a struggle with Iran for regional
dominance. But the U.S. government shouldn't condone it.]{.underline}
[Any nuclear agreement]{.underline} worth striking [with Saudi Arabia
must]{.underline} be at least as tight as the one Washington has with
its neighbor the United Arab Emirates, which [prohibits enrichment and
reprocessing.]{.underline} The Saudi regime's past behavior provides
ample reason to insist on strict rules for nonproliferation. It was
Riyadh, remember, that [funded the
development](https://www.theguardian.com/world/julian-borger-global-security-blog/2010/may/11/pakistan-saudiarabia)
of Pakistan's nuclear arsenal. The United States should demand nothing
less than what is seen as the nonproliferation gold standard for such
agreements: no uranium enrichment and no extraction of plutonium. The
Saudis also possess the missiles needed to deliver nuclear weapons,
should they ever acquire them. In the 1980s, they bought long-range DF-3
"East Wind" missiles from China --- missiles that are designed to carry
nuclear weapons --- [without
informing](https://foreignpolicy.com/2014/01/30/why-did-saudi-arabia-buy-chinese-missiles/)
the United States. Then, 10 years ago, they bought newer nuclear-capable
Chinese missiles. They designated the Royal Saudi Strategic Missile
Force as one of the five branches of the Royal Saudi Arabian Armed
Forces, responsible for commissioning long-range missiles. What is often
left unsaid is that these missiles only make sense if armed with nuclear
weapons. [**Saudi Arabia is neither a stable state nor a benign actor**
in the Middle East **that deserves U.S. coddling.** The U.S. government
portrays Saudi Arabia as a partner in the fight against Islamic
extremism, but the truth is that **the Saudis have been the main
purveyors of the fundamentalist** religious **doctrines that have
spread** the seeds of **terrorism throughout the Arab world.** Indeed,
the Saudi-supported brand of Islam, Wahhabism, has [served as
inspiration](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2016/03/29/what-is-wahhabism-the-reactionary-branch-of-islam-said-to-be-the/)
for many of the world's most violent terrorists.]{.underline} But [the
most important reason for caution]{.underline} about any nuclear deal
with Saudi Arabia is that it [is]{.underline} unlikely to survive for
long in its current form, [because **Saudi Arabia's ruling family is
remarkably unstable.** **An absolutist monarchy** that represses
minorities, chops off heads of political opponents, and lacks a codified
system of law is out of step with 21st-century reality.]{.underline} It
**[rests on a shaky foundation.]{.underline}** [**It is unclear whether
a future regime that replaces the current monarchy would be friendly to
U.S. interests. What is clear is that any new regime would inherit
whatever nuclear technology and materials the current government
acquires.** It is worth recalling that the Shah of Iran was considered a
good friend and a modernizer before being deposed in the 1979 revolution
--- and that the United States once supported a nascent nuclear program
during his rule.]{.underline} The United States shouldn't get carried
away by Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman's reported efforts to
modernize the country, in particular the highly advertised decision to
let women drive. More significant is his extremely poor judgment in
getting involved in a war in Yemen, and his zeal for confronting Iran.
His method of shaking money out of Saudi billionaires, meanwhile, should
raise concerns about the kingdom's financial situation. A nuclear
cooperation agreement pursuant to the U.S. Atomic Energy Act --- which
is different from the political understanding reached with Iran ---
would last for decades, and any enriched uranium and plutonium
explosives produced under it would last indefinitely. If the United
States cuts a deal with Riyadh on nuclear power, it must restrict Saudi
nuclear activity strictly to generating electricity. The Saudis don't
need uranium enrichment for this. The United States doesn't even have a
U.S.-owned uranium enricher, and there is no country today operating
nuclear power plants that needs to separate plutonium. Any interest in
doing so raises obvious questions about ulterior military motives. The
existing U.S. deal with the United Arab Emirates, which is just
completing construction of four nuclear power reactors, should serve as
a model for the type of tight restrictions that should be placed on
Saudi Arabia's nuclear energy program. It meets the exigencies of
international security while imposing no economic penalties. Extending
this sound nonproliferation precedent to the Saudis would also establish
a firm standard for renewal of the U.S. nuclear power agreement with
Egypt, which comes up in 2021, and with Turkey, which is up for renewal
in 2023. To do otherwise would signal American acquiescence in the
Middle East, allow another country to edge closer to building nuclear
weapons, and potentially provoke a regional nuclear arms race.

#### The Saudis are willing to proliferate nuclear weapons from American reactors and materials -- they refused to commit to non-prolif agreements and openly desire to have leverage over Iran

Riyadh's reckless behavior foments widespread mistrust of its plans to
buy nuclear reactors. **[The]{.underline}** release this week of an
**[[explosive

by House Democrats alleging that the Trump administration has sought to
help its cronies sell nuclear power technology to Saudi Arabia has
dramatically heightened tensions between the White House and lawmakers
in both chambers.]{.underline}** But sleaze aside, is there cause for
alarm over Saudi Arabia gaining access to the same kind of
power-generating technology that more than 30 countries around the world
already use? Both Republican and Democratic legislators and nuclear
experts who are increasingly alarmed at Saudi Arabia's reckless behavior
say there is plenty of reason to be concerned. According to the House
report, [whistleblowers "have warned about political appointees ignoring
directives from top ethics advisors at the White House who repeatedly
and unsuccessfully ordered senior Trump Administration officials to halt
their efforts" to sell nuclear know-how to Riyadh.]{.underline} The
whistleblowers, who were not identified, also warned "of conflicts of
interest among top White House advisers that could implicate federal
criminal statutes," the report said. And in the wake of the gruesome,
regime-ordered killing in October 2018 of the Washington Post columnist
Jamal Khashoggi, anti-Saudi sentiment in Washington that had already
been rising due to atrocities in Yemen is boiling over. Lawmakers such
as Republican Sen. Marco Rubio have introduced legislation that would,
unusually, give Congress the final say on whether to allow nuclear
technology exports to Saudi Arabia, adding extra restrictions to the
standard accord with the express intent of
[thwarting](https://www.rubio.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/press-releases?ID=AB9F62A2-4391-407A-BF61-611D94ACA502).
Riyadh's quest for a nuclear bomb. "If a government is willing to murder

[told](https://www.thedailybeast.com/marco-rubio-warns-trump-on-saudi-nuclear-deal-talk-no-relationship-is-too-big-to-fail)
the Daily Beast, "there's a legitimate question over whether such a
government could be trusted with nuclear energy and the potential
weaponization of it." On the other hand, Saudi Arabia certainly needs
more power. With electricity demand
[growing](https://www.atlanticcouncil.org/blogs/energysource/saudi-arabia-s-vision-2030-key-electric-power-decisions-ahead)
by as much as 8 percent a year---needed to run air conditioners,
desalination plants, and more---the country is looking to find something
other than oil and gas, which currently provide nearly all its
electricity, to keep the lights on. [Officials in Saudi Arabia, which
can burn as much as one-tenth of its oil production every summer just
making electricity, want]{.underline} to preserve that black gold for
more lucrative exports. One answer is adding [more renewable
energy]{.underline}, especially solar power. Another answer is nuclear
power, a[nd the country plans to build as many as [16 big nuclear power

officials argue that America's nuclear industry should sell reactors to
Saudi Arabia---or else Russia or China will, potentially giving Moscow
or Beijing a decades-long lucrative, strategic partnership with a
keystone state in the Middle East.]{.underline}** (On Friday, Saudi
Arabia took another big step toward deepening its already tight energy
relationship with China,
[inking](https://www.reuters.com/article/asia-saudi-china/update-1-saudi-agrees-10-bln-china-refinery-deal-as-crown-prince-visits-idUSL3N20H37C)
a \$10 billion deal to build a new refinery.) In general, **[selling
U.S. nuclear technology has another benefit]{.underline}**, too, many
experts
[say](https://twq.elliott.gwu.edu/sites/g/files/zaxdzs2121/f/downloads/TWQ_Summer2018_HolgateSaha.pdf)**[:
The United States also exports its regulatory regime, safety and
security standards, and strict protocols against nuclear proliferation,
making American participation in the worldwide scramble for nuclear
power a way to boost, rather than undermine, global
security.]{.underline}** But in order to sell reactors overseas, the
United States needs a formal agreement with the other country regulating
just how those nuclear technologies will be used; to date, the United
States has nearly 50 such agreements, known as "123 agreements" for the
eponymous section of the 1954 Atomic Energy Act. For several years,
Washington and Saudi Arabia have been negotiating their own 123 accord.
But lately, those
[efforts](https://www.armscontrol.org/act/2018-12/news/pressure-builds-saudi-nuclear-accord)
have run into a buzz saw---or rather, a Saudi bone saw. [**Many experts
argue that fears that Saudi Arabia will turn nuclear reactors into
breeders for a weapons program are overblown. Reactors use low-enriched
uranium, while bombs need highly enriched uranium.** And that kind of
enrichment program is hard to keep hidden, not to mention costly.
Reprocessing spent nuclear fuel to scrape out plutonium to build a bomb
is even costlier.]{.underline} "There seems to be a conflating of
legitimate national security issues with civilian nuclear technology.
Saudi Arabia is not Iran. It's not North Korea," said Katie Tubb, a
nuclear energy specialist at the Heritage Foundation. She
[says](https://www.heritage.org/sites/default/files/2018-04/BG3304.pdf)
a standard 123 agreement, like the ones the United States has with
dozens of other countries, would provide plenty of safeguards and
oversight to ensure that Saudi Arabia used the technology responsibly.
"There are a lot of steps from having a nuclear power industry to having
a bomb," she said. So what is the problem with helping Saudi Arabia meet
its growing energy demand with foreign-built nuclear reactors, as
countries from China to Vietnam to the United Arab Emirates are doing?
"The simple answer is nothing. [Civilian nuclear technology can be
safeguarded, and it's not very well suited to producing nuclear weapons
material]{.underline}," said Jon Wolfsthal, formerly a top
nonproliferation official in President Barack Obama's administration and
now director of the Nuclear Crisis Group. Except for one thing,
Wolfsthal added: **["Saudi Arabia doesn't just want reactors---it wants
the ability to enrich uranium. And that is very sensitive
technology."]{.underline}** All states that have signed on to the
Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty (NPT), as Saudi Arabia has,
theoretically have the right to enrich uranium. Insisting on that right,
Saudi Arabia has refused to forswear uranium enrichment as part of any
agreement with the United States. That stands in sharp contrast to the
UAE, which inked a novel 123 agreement in 2009 that included an explicit
ban on any enrichment activities as a safeguard against proliferation.
But Saudi Arabia has refused to consider signing on to that so-called
"gold standard." "[The unwillingness to sign up to the 'gold standard'
gives people pause]{.underline}," Wolfsthal said. **[Holding onto a
sovereign right to enrichment is one thing. A much bigger problem is
that, the NPT notwithstanding, Saudi officials have openly said they'd
build a nuclear bomb of their own if Iran builds one. "If Iran developed
a nuclear bomb, we will follow suit as soon as possible," Saudi Crown
Prince Mohammed bin Salman
[said](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2018/03/mbs-saudis-pursue-nuclear-weapons-iran-180315152433732.html)
last year.]{.underline}** That's the main reason that Riyadh's quest for
nuclear power plants causes unease in a way that didn't happen with
other countries that have turned to atomic energy. After its gold-plated
nuclear deal with the UAE, for example, the United States signed a 123
agreement with Vietnam---which pointedly did not include the same
restrictions. ["Unlike any other potential partner, Saudi officials have
been saying, 'We might need a nuclear weapon,'" said Laura S.H. Holgate,
a former U.S. ambassador to the International Atomic Energy
Agency.]{.underline} "That's why **[it is a very different prospect for
us to be thinking about providing even the most peaceful nuclear
technology to Saudi Arabia]{.underline}**," said Holgate, now the vice
president for materials risk management at the Nuclear Threat
Initiative.

**[Would Saudi nukes find their way into the hands of terrorists? A very
real concern The possibility that the Saudis already have access to
nuclear weapons, and hope to soon develop them domestically, has been
met with concern by analysts, particularly given the kingdom's
[documented
history](http://conflictarm.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/Dispatch_IS_Iraq_Syria_Weapons.pdf)
of funneling weapons to [terrorist
groups](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2017/12/isil-weapons-traced-saudi-arabia-171214164431586.html)

radical Wahhabist groups they [actively
support](https://www.zerohedge.com/news/2016-10-11/hillary-confirms-saudi-arabia-qatar-are-funding-isis-leaked-email).
Another area of concern is the kingdom's disrespect for civilian life
and tendency to wage total war when embroiled in a military
conflict.]{.underline}** For instance, [in Yemen, where the Saudis have
been attempting to oust the Houthis from power since 2015, the Saudi-led
coalition has repeatedly bombed civilian infrastructure and [imposed a
blockade](https://www.mintpressnews.com/saudi-arabia-blockade-of-yemen-nightmare-scenario/234284/)
of the country that has prevented food, medicine and fuel from reaching

18.5 million Yemenis are [expected to face
starvation](https://www.mintpressnews.com/un-10-million-more-yemenis-expected-to-starve-to-death-by-end-of-year/242906/)
by this December and a ["preventable" cholera
epidemic](https://www.mintpressnews.com/preventable-cholera-yemen-reaches-1-million-cases/235822/)
of historic proportions continues to claim innocent life. **The Saudis'
willingness to inflict such misery on a civilian population as part of a
military conflict is yet another indication of the danger inherent in
their acquiring the ability to manufacture nuclear
weapons.**]{.underline}

### Prolif Bad -- China Alliance

#### Proliferation causes Saudi Arabia to ally with China -- pushing the US out of the Middle East and exacerbating tensions

Strategic Shortcomings With territory of more than 800,000 square miles,
[Saudi Arabia is a vast country, four times the size of France. Its
capital, Riyadh, is in the center of the country, but otherwise its
population centers and economic assets are concentrated along the
Persian Gulf and Red Sea coasts. The oil installations that provide most
of the country's revenue and the desalination plants that produce 70% of
its drinking water are visible, vulnerable targets that could be
devastated in short order by air assault or seaborne
attack.]{.underline} Despite Saudi Arabia's large territory, [it would
be difficult for the population and the armed forces to retreat from the
coasts and regroup in the interior because the interior is virtually
uninhabitable; cut off the from the coasts, the Saudis would be without
food or water. Military supply lines would be severed.]{.underline}
Moreover, [Western military analysts agree that despite its
multi-billion dollar purchases of military equipment over the past 30
years, Saudi Arabia does not have armed forces capable of defending the
country against a large-scale attack.]{.underline} So [let us suppose
that Saudi Arabia's currently testy relationship with the United States
deteriorated to the point where the Saudis no longer felt they could
rely on Washington's protection.]{.underline} If the Saudis could no
longer assume that the armed forces of the United States are their
ultimate weapon against external threats, might they not wish to acquire
a different ultimate weapon? With that in mind, [could not a reasonable
case be made in the Saudis' minds for the development of an alternative
security relationship, and perhaps a nuclear agreement, with another
major power should relations with the United States deteriorate? A
possible candidate for such a role would of course be China, a nuclear
power that has a close relationship with Saudi Arabia's ally Pakistan
and a growing need for imported oil.]{.underline} Sufficiently remote
from the Persian Gulf not to pose a direct threat to Saudi Arabia, and
no longer part of any international communist movement, China could
theoretically be an attractive partner. This is not to say that Saudi
Arabia is actually seeking such a relationship with any country other
the United States, but to be unaware of any such outreach is not to
exclude it from the realm of possibility. The Saudi Arabian armed forces
have never developed a coherent national security doctrine that could
provide a serious basis for acquisition and deployment planning, let
alone for a decision to acquire nuclear weapons. But [to summarize the
reasons why Saudi Arabia might pursue such a course: it is a rich but
weak country with armed forces of suspect competence; outmanned by
combat-hardened, truculent and potentially nuclear-armed neighbors; and
no longer confident that it can count on its American
protector.]{.underline} Even before the Iraq War, Richard L. [Russell
observed in a 2001 essay arguing the case for Saudi acquisition of
nuclear capability that "It would be imprudent, to say the least, for
Riyadh to make the cornerstone of \[its\] national-security posture out
of an assumption that the United States would come to the kingdom's
defense under any and all circumstances."\[3\] It might be even more
imprudent now. "From Riyadh's perspective," continued Russell, "the
acquisition of nuclear weapons and secure delivery systems would appear
logical and even necessary."]{.underline} Those "secure delivery
systems," Russell argued, would not be aircraft, which are vulnerable to
ground defenses, but "ballistic-missile delivery systems that would
stand a near-invulnerable chance of penetrating enemy airspace"---
namely, the CSS-2s.

[On January 18, Chinese Ambassador to Saudi Arabia Li
Huaxin]{.underline} praised Saudi Arabia's Vision 2030 project and
[called for tighter integration between Saudi Arabia's economic
diversification efforts and the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI). Li also
expressed]{.underline} enthusiastic [support for]{.underline} Saudi
Crown Prince [M]{.underline}ohammed [b]{.underline}in
[S]{.underline}alman's anti-corruption campaign, [claiming that his
efforts to strengthen the rule of law in Saudi Arabia would increase the
country's attractiveness as an investment destination for Chinese
businesses.]{.underline} While Li's praise for Saudi Arabia's economic
reforms suggests that the Beijing-Riyadh partnership is on firm footing,
[growing concerns in the United States about the implications of Chinese
investments for the Washington-Riyadh alliance and uncertainties
surrounding the nature of the Saudi privatization process could limit
the scope of China-Saudi Arabia economic cooperation. These factors
could cause Beijing to eventually pivot more firmly toward Riyadh's
regional rivals, Iran and Qatar.]{.underline} Saudi Arabia's Balancing
Act Between China and the United States Even though Washington did not
react strongly to China's emergence as Saudi Arabia's largest trade
partner in 2010, many [U.S. policymakers are concerned that China will
make Saudi Arabia an unwitting pawn in its efforts to erode U.S.
hegemony over global financial markets. These concerns have
risen]{.underline} sharply [since Saudi Arabia]{.underline}'s Vice
Minister of Economy and Planning Mohammed al-Tuwaijri
[announced]{.underline} on August 24 [that Saudi Arabia planned to
partially cover its budget deficit in Chinese yuan to reduce its
financial dependency on the U.S. dollar.]{.underline} Many American
economists have expressed alarm at Saudi Arabia's willingness to borrow
in Chinese yuan, as [Riyadh's decision could cause other oil-exporting
countries to abandon the U.S. dollar in favor of the
"petro-yuan."]{.underline} [A]{.underline} marked [decline in the use of
the U.S. dollar as the]{.underline} preferred credit-issuing [currency
by oil-producing countries would greatly weaken the U.S. dollar's
long-term viability as a global reserve currency.]{.underline} As the
[United States views its alliance with Saudi Arabia as the lynchpin of
its Middle East strategy, Washington will likely react strongly if
Riyadh uses its influence within OPEC to strengthen the Chinese
yuan.]{.underline} As Saudi Arabia remains dependent on U.S. arms sales
to pursue its geopolitical objectives in the Middle East and counter
Iran, intense [U.S. pressure would likely cause Riyadh to distance
itself from Beijing, limiting economic integration between the two
countries.]{.underline} In addition to setting informal limits on the
scope and nature of Saudi Arabia's economic partnership with China,
[Riyadh's dependence on U.S. military equipment restricts its ability to
purchase large quantities of Chinese arms.]{.underline} Historically,
Saudi Arabia has only purchased arms from China to pressure the United
States into selling Riyadh highly sophisticated weaponry. Saudi Arabia's
purchases of DF-3 missiles from China in 1987, and current procurements
of Chinese stealth weaponry for military use in Yemen, exemplify its
tactical approach to arms deals with Beijing. As U.S.-Saudi Arabia
relations have improved considerably under Donald Trump, [the need for
Saudi Arabia to purchase arms from China will likely decrease in the
years to come.]{.underline} As Qatar has been able to covertly purchase
Chinese SY-400 missiles with little U.S. scrutiny, and China has a
long-standing defense partnership with Iran, [the Chinese government is
likely to forge stronger defense links with Saudi Arabia's chief rivals,
straining the Beijing-Riyadh partnership.]{.underline} Even though Saudi
Arabia has historically been able to cooperate with China in the nuclear
energy sphere without U.S. criticism, the [Trump]{.underline}
administration['s depiction of China as an adversary]{.underline} in its
2018 National Security Strategy [will increase U.S. government scrutiny
over nuclear cooperation deals signed between Beijing and U.S.-allied
countries.]{.underline} As U.S. Secretary of Energy Rick Perry has held
negotiations with Saudi Arabia on a nuclear agreement, a hawkish tilt in
Washington's China policy could convert these discussions into a nuclear
deal. The ratification of Perry's proposed agreement would greatly
expand the United States' leverage over Riyadh's nuclear policy and
dilute the impact of China's \$2.43 billion nuclear manufacturing
equipment investment pledge. Privatization Uncertainties and the
China-Saudi Arabia Partnership While U.S. opposition is the largest
immediate obstacle to China-Saudi Arabia economic cooperation, [a shift
in the economic conditions that have allowed Chinese investments to grow
in Saudi Arabia could also weaken the partnership.]{.underline} In
recent years, Chinese investors have made inroads in Saudi Arabia
because of their willingness to directly cooperate with Saudi government
enterprises, and provide capital to potentially risky economic
diversification projects. While these advantages remain intact, [the
nature of Saudi Arabia's privatization strategy and success of Riyadh's
"Look East" strategy could eventually erode China's privileged
position.]{.underline} Although China will likely benefit from the
upcoming Aramco IPO deal, extensive [privatization outside the energy
sector could weaken Beijing's competitive position relative to the
United States.]{.underline} The speed of Mohammed bin Salman's proposed
privatization plan could also drastically impact the success of Chinese
investments. Even though the trajectory of Saudi Arabia's privatization
reforms will impact many economic sectors, [investment patterns in Saudi
Arabia's growing technology markets will be especially impacted by
policy changes. If Mohammed bin Salman exercises restraint and embraces
a cautious privatization plan, China's business interests will be given
a critical boost.]{.underline} Chinese technology companies like Alibaba
and Tencent are conglomerates that can more effectively withstand state
interference than their American counterparts, and will be able to
leverage this advantage to entrench their dominance over time. [If Saudi
Arabia undergoes rapid privatization and economic diversification,
however, U.S. technology companies could gain the upper
hand.]{.underline} The success of Twitter in Saudi Arabia highlights the
brand power of U.S. technology companies, and [a rapid withdrawal of
government interference in the IT sector would allow Facebook and Google
to leverage this marketing strength by creating a more level playing
field for investment.]{.underline} Mohammed bin Salman's willingness to
enact impulsive reforms in the economic and political spheres makes this
rapid privatization scenario a plausible one, and underscores the
fragility of China's influence over Saudi Arabia's post-oil economy. To
compound China's vulnerabilities in a rapid privatization scenario,
[Saudi policymakers]{.underline} view China as one of many potential
investors in the Asia-Pacific region, and [will work to prevent Beijing
from gaining excessively large ownership stakes in infant industries
developing within Saudi Arabia's non-oil sectors.]{.underline} The Saudi
monarchy's circumspect attitude toward Chinese investment can be
explained by Riyadh's concerns that [China will attempt to eventually
convert its economic influence in Saudi Arabia into political influence,
like it has in countries like Pakistan and the Philippines.]{.underline}
Saudi Arabia's efforts to strengthen its economic partnerships with
Russia, Japan, and India, in recent months, highlight its desire to
avoid becoming dependent on Chinese capital. If Riyadh's trade
diversification strategy prevents Saudi Arabia from granting China
preferential access to its consumer markets, Beijing could ultimately
divert more resources to other Middle East states, like Turkey and Iran,
to maximize the return on its capital investments. [Although China's
relationship with Saudi Arabia is likely to continue to strengthen for
the foreseeable future, the strength of the U.S.-Saudi Arabia alliance,
informal barriers to large-scale China-Saudi Arabia security
cooperation, and Mohammed bin Salman's impulsive governance style could
restrict the scope of the Beijing-Riyadh partnership. Unless these
underlying factors drastically change, Saudi Arabia's significance as a
Chinese trade partner could reduce considerably, as China redirects some
of its capital investments to other Middle East emerging markets in the
years to come.]{.underline}

A Role for Pakistan? [The other possible source would be
Pakistan.]{.underline} Saudi Arabia has had a long and close
relationship that survived Pakistan's multiple shifts from civilian to
military rule and back. Washington was alerted to the possibility of a
Saudi turn to Pakistan for missiles and perhaps even nuclear warheads by
Prince Sultan's 1999 visit to Pakistan's defense and nuclear facilities.
It was believed to be the first time any outsider had been permitted to
visit the Pakistani sites. By that time, Pakistan was openly in
possession of nuclear warheads, having tested six the year before in
response to tests by India, and was nearing production of a new
generation of ballistic missiles with a range of 1,500 miles --- a
possible replacement for the CSS 2s in Saudi Arabia. [As conservative,
Sunni Muslim nations with overlapping interests and complementary
strengths, Pakistan and Saudi Arabia had been considering formal
security agreements since the 1950s. The appeal of such an arrangement
was obvious: Pakistan had military knowhow, trained manpower, and
experienced forces, but no money; the Saudis lacked military and
industrial capability, but had plenty of cash.]{.underline} According to
the United Nations' global compilation of treaties, Saudi Arabia and
Pakistan have a friendship pact dating to that era but no formal mutual
defense agreement --- indeed, Saudi Arabia has no formal defense
agreement with any country, other than the loose arrangments of the Gulf
Cooperation Council, and would be unlikely to enter such an arrangment
with Pakistan out of fear of being dragged into the Kashmir conflict.
But the security relationship between the two countries has been close
since the late 1970s. After the tumultuous year of 1979 --- the most
stressful in modern Saudi history because of Egypt's peace treaty with
Israel, the Iranian revolution, and the armed takeover by radical
dissidents of the Great Mosque in Mecca, followed by the Soviet invasion
of Afghanistan --- a small contingent of Pakistani troops was deployed
to Saudi Arabia. One unit was stationed at Khamis Mushayt, in the far
south, the other in Tabuk, near the Jordanian border, far enough from
the capital not to pose any threat to the ruling family. The Saudis, of
course, footed the bill. These troops remained until 1987, when oil
prices hit historic lows and the Saudis could no longer afford them. In
cooperation with the CIA, Pakistan and Saudi Arabia worked closely
throughout the 1980s to recruit, train, equip and pay for the guerrilla
war of Islamic resistance against the Soviet troops occupying
Afghanistan. (Among the many Saudi individuals who participated in that
conflict was Usama bin Ladin.) The Saudis congratulated Pakistan after
its 1998 nuclear tests, and a few months later Crown Prince 'Abdullah,
now the king, was received effusively on a visit to Lahore. In their
joint statement about the visit, the two countries said that "Views were
exchanged in an atmosphere of brotherhood and understanding in which
prevailed mutual trust and compatibility of points of view which
characterizes the Saudi-Pakistani relations." The statement said the
visit symbolized the "permanent bond between Saudi Arabia and Pakistan."
There is little doubt that at least until recently Pakistan was pressing
ahead with the development of additional nuclear weapons and the
missiles by which to deliver them. In May 2002, Pakistan tested a new
liquid-fueled missile known as the Haft-V, apparently based on North
Korean technology, with a range of about 800 miles. That is less than
half the range of the CSS 2s, but still easily enough to reach critical
targets in Iran, Iraq, and Israel from Saudi Arabia. Later that year,
the Bush administration revealed its concern that Pakistan was paying
North Korea for its missile technology not in cash but in assistance to
Pyongyang's nuclear program. The CIA reported in January 2003 that
Pakistan has "continued to acquire nuclear-related equipment, some of it
dual use, and materials from various sources --- principally in Western
Europe." But times have changed and Pakistan is less likely now to
undertake such a risky venture as helping Saudi Arabia develop nuclear
weapons. The A.Q. Khan network of off-the-books proliferation, which
supplied Libya and other countries, has been exposed and dismantled.
Pakistan's efforts to block a nuclear cooperation agreement between the
United States and India would be undermined by its participation in a
new proliferation arrangement. And Pakistan is in such a state of
domestic political upheaval that it seems unlikely that anyone ---
including the embattled president, General Pervez Musharraf ---would be
willing or able to authorize such a deal. [Some US government officials
believe that Pakistan and Saudi Arabia have an understanding by which
Pakistan's nuclear capabilities would be made available on demand to
Saudi Arabia if the Saudis found themselves in extremis, a guarantee
purchased, in effect, by Saudi funding of Pakistan's nuclear
program.]{.underline} No known evidence supports this theory and some
experts openly discount it. Among them is Gary Samore, a long-time
student of Saudi Arabian security policy who was a senior arms control
and nonproliferation specialist at the National Security Council in the
Clinton Administration. "I don't believe there's a deal that the Saudis
already paid and could take delivery on demand and if I were the Saudis
I wouldn't trust the Pakistani to deliver on such a deal," Samore said.
"There's no doubt the Saudis have delivered a lot of money to Pakistan,
and some went to support the nuclear weapons program, but I don't
believe any such quid pro quo exists. What would be more likely would be
that Pakistan would \[again\] station troops on Saudi soil, and those
could include nuclear-armed forces."\[5\] These could be attack aircraft
carrying bombs, missile squadrons deploying nuclear-tipped warheads, or
ground troops, such as Pakistan previously sent to Saudi Arabia, now
equipped with tactical --- as opposed to strategic --- nuclear weapons.
But against which potential foe of Saudi Arabia would Pakistan put its
own interests at risk by deploying nuclear weapons in the Arabian
peninsula? The Pakistanis know as well as anyone that the principal
threats to the security and stability of Saudi Arabia are domestic and
nuclear weapons have no value against these threats. They might actually
stir up more trouble than they would alleviate. In summary, there are
some logical reasons why some senior Saudi princes might wish to pursue
nuclear weapons in the event that Iran is known to have acquired them.
Given the impenetrability of the Saudi decision-making process, it is
impossible to know if such discussions have taken place in Riyadh. But
on balance, the strategic, political and technological problems standing
in the way of such a program make it unlikely if not impossible that
Saudi Arabia would go down that road, no matter what happens across the
Gulf.

#### Causes Iran and India war

Historically, the Pakistani-Saudi relationship has largely been a
personal affair between the leaders on both sides, taking on a strategic
dynamic through security cooperation. This helped to ensure that the
Pakistani military was an essential element in the Islamabad
government's regional manoeuvres. But since the ousting of Pakistani
president Pervez Musharaf in 2008, the relationship has been unsettled.
It fractured further in 2015, when Pakistan's parliament rejected a
Saudi request for troops to take part in its intervention in Yemen's
civil war -- the Pakistani military had wanted to take a more diplomatic
approach. While the Saudis remained suspicious of Pakistan's civilian
leadership, **[the military made its own moves to repair the
relationship. It assured the Saudis over Pakistan's security commitments
to the Kingdom and projected Pakistan as a strategic link between the
Middle East and South Asia. This was a way to counter Islamabad's
isolation in the international arena and attract economic and political
benefits from the Gulf]{.underline}**. **[A strong relationship with
Riyadh was also a means of balancing the power of Pakistan's arch-rival,
India, and preventing India from gaining the upper hand in the Middle
East.]{.underline}** Pakistan's prime minister, Imran Khan. To this end,
in 2017, Pakistan joined the Saudi-led Islamic Military
Counter-Terrorism Coalition, which brings together the militaries of 41
Islamic countries to counter terrorist groups and their activities in
the Muslim world. Pakistan's retiring chief army general, Raheel Sharif,
was appointed its commander-in-chief. Pakistan's 2016 participation in
the "North Thunder" military exercise with Saudi Arabia and its allies
as well as joint exercises between the special forces of both countries
had already revealed an increased level of cooperation between the two
countries. Islamabad cemented the reconciliation with the dispatch of
more than 1,000 troops to the Kingdom, in addition to the 1,600 already
deployed on a training and advice mission -- making Pakistan the only
country with a significant foreign force within Saudi Arabia. Still,
without strong ties between Pakistan's military and the government in
Islamabad, the repaired relationship was limited. The Saudis were not
willing to make a significant financial investment in Pakistan without
the assurance of a prime minister who would fully support the bilateral
initiative. But then, last August, Imran Khan was elected prime minister
of Pakistan. And MBS, facing his own international tensions after the
murder of journalist Jamal Khashoggi, soon travelled to Islamabad with a
promise of US\$20 billion in funds for Pakistan. Shifting dynamics The
announcement of the Saudi largesse, and MBS's dramatic announcement that
2,100 Pakistani labourers detained in Saudi Arabia would also be
released, sent Khan's popularity soaring within hours. At 61%, his
approval rating is now the second highest we've recorded in our monthly
polls since his election. Only higher by 3pts was his rating right after
his swearing in as PM and first address to the nation. After years of
division, the military and civilian leaders are now on the same page
vis-a-vis the country's strategic outlook and there's a high level of
trust in the personal relationship between Khan and Bajwa. The bolstered
political-military axis within Pakistan, the much improved relationship
with Saudi Arabia and the investment that has come with it, have helped
ease a Pakistan still shaking from the turmoil and corruption of the
past decade. But Islamabad must also negotiate the wider geopolitical
terrain. **[Renewed Saudi-Pakistan ties have not been well received in
Iran, Pakistan's neighbour and Saudi's arch-rival in the Middle
East.]{.underline}** And this unease was compounded when 27 Iranian
Revolutionary Guards personnel were killed in a bus bombing near the
Pakistan border, just days before the crown prince arrived in Islamabad.
The attack was carried out by Baluch insurgents, but Tehran quickly
blamed "Saudi Arabia and the UAE, which carry out these acts on orders
from the US and the Zionist regime". **[It then turned to Islamabad: "If
Pakistan does not punish \[the insurgents\], we will definitely take
reparative measures against this counter-revolutionary force in the near
future." Then there was the escalation of Pakistan's ongoing dispute
with India over Kashmir. On February 26, Indian warplanes allegedly
bombed Pakistan in retaliation for an attack by insurgents that killed
40 Indian personnel in the disputed area on February 14. Pakistan downed
two Indian jet fighters and captured a pilot. Khan offered political
talks and Islamabad has returned the pilot, but tensions continue and
several civilians and soldiers have been killed in ongoing border
exchanges. So, while relations have been repaired within Pakistan and
between Pakistan and Saudi Arabia, nothing has been resolved in the
wider kaleidoscope of regional geopolitics. Khan may have forged a way
forward with the Pakistani military, and they may have restored a
partnership with the Saudi monarchy -- but it remains to be seen how
strong these bonds will prove to be if Tehran or Delhi create new
instability in the near future.]{.underline}**

Only Congress Stands Between Saudi Arabia and Nuclear Weapons There is
an eerie lull in the news about the proposed U.S.-Saudi nuclear
agreement that Washington has talked about for months. Could it be that
the administration no longer supports a sweetheart deal with its
favorite crown prince? It seems too good to be true. Alas, it surely is.
The lure of Saudi money is irresistible to the Trump White House and its
nuclear camp followers, and they will be back. Congress must act now in
anticipation if it is to stop an arrangement that would allow Crown
Prince Mohammed bin Salman to outfit himself with everything he needs
for a bomb. If Congress waits to see what lands on its table, then it
will be too late. **[If President Donald Trump presents a fully
negotiated agreement text to Congress, then the only way Congress can
reject it is by mustering a two-thirds vote of opposition in both
houses, which in their current configuration is a near political
impossibility. Altogether, the law, and Congress's decades-old passivity
in the face of Executive action, favor the president.]{.underline}** So
why has Trump not done so already? It can only be because he has not
been able to negotiate sufficiently advantageous terms. In truth, he
doesn't have much to work with other than the threat that Saudi security
ultimately rests on American power. There is no longer an American
vendor of nuclear power plants. Westinghouse, which is often spoken of
in this context, has been Japanese-owned for years. Its managerial
incompetence led to the collapse of one of the only two U.S. nuclear
construction projects, and the near failure of the other. It went
through bankruptcy and is now owned by a Canadian conglomerate (albeit
one with financial ties to the Trump family). It is an altogether
unattractive partner for an international construction project. The best
it can realistically hope for is to piggy-back on a Saudi deal with a
more solid vendor, the prime candidate being Korean.

height="8.333333333333333e-3in"} But **[the president and his closest
advisors are too heavily invested in the U.S.-Saudi connection to let
the nuclear deal go. It not only has personal importance for
Trump---recall the Kingdom was his first foreign destination---but he
has advertised that its putative riches will create untold jobs in
America, and it is also the capstone in the U.S.-Arab-Israeli front
against Iran.]{.underline}** If [the Saudis want nuclear
technology]{.underline} as part of the price, [the president is not
going to insist on encumbrances that would restrict what use they made
of it.]{.underline} To make this work he has to find a way around the
tiresome congressmen who keep on insisting that we shouldn't encourage
the spread of nuclear weapons, and the even more tiresome ones who bring
up the unfortunate disappearance of a Washington Post columnist. [Part
of the strategy is to keep Congress in the dark.]{.underline} A good
example is the so-called Part 810 issue. [To export equipment, the
Nuclear Regulatory Commission would have to issue a
license]{.underline}. It can only do that i[n the context of an
agreement with the]{.underline} importer (in this case the [Saudis) on
cooperation on civil nuclear power]{.underline}, a so-called "123
agreement," named for the section in the Atomic Energy Act that lays out
the conditions for equipment exports. To export technology, that is,
information, or to perform services, the exporter needs an approval from
the Department of Energy (DOE), which is granted [under Part 810 of its
regulations. It was uncovered recently that DOE had granted 810
approvals to seven firms seeking Saudi nuclear business. While such
actions have always been public in the past, the Trump administration
kept them secret, relying on the exemption in the regulation for
proprietary information.]{.underline} DOE added a creative wrinkle: it
claimed that not only were the contents of the 810 technology transfer
proprietary, but the name of the exporter was also proprietary, which is
a bit of a legal stretch. Not only that, [but DOE claimed
even](https://af.reuters.com/article/commoditiesNews/idAFL1N21E27G)
Congress couldn't have access to the information. Here DOE has waded
into illegal territory. The Atomic Energy Act (Section 123 e) instructs
the Executive to keep Congress "fully and currently" informed of its
activities. At one time, decades ago, this was a fearsome instruction,
and nuclear officials testifying before Congress seriously worried
whether they had complied with "fully and currently." But in time,
**[Congress ceded much of its power and congressional oversight went
slack to the point that Congress got out of the habit of overseeing the
Executive. In fact, it was a revelation to congressmen and their staffs
that the law required the Executive to inform them what it was up to in
areas covered by the Atomic Energy Act.]{.underline}** It must have been
a shock to the Trump crowd, too, but it didn't faze them much. They went
into their modus operandi---dragging things out, giving a bit of
information and insisting it could not be passed on, and so on, counting
on Congress to lose interest. The public still does not know the names
of the recipients of the seven 810 approvals, or what were the subjects
of the approvals, information we are entitled to know. If Congress has
any self-respect, then it will not stand for this state-of-affairs.
Since the Executive does not honor the traditional customs of political
process, only legislation that spells out its obligations can right the
balance. There are [legislative
proposals](https://www.congress.gov/bill/115th-congress/house-bill/7351?s=2&r=3)

Sherman](https://www.congress.gov/bill/116th-congress/house-bill/1471?s=1&r=5)

key [nonproliferation

[Such legislation will have difficulty getting through the Senate as it
is currently constituted, but the effort to do so is needed to publicize
the Executive's overreach and marshal public opinion.]{.underline}
Congress will also have to work harder at understanding complex nuclear
issues. A Saudi bomb could create havoc in the Middle East on a scale
beyond anything yet contemplated. Stronger Congressional action is
needed to prevent it.

two nuclear power plants as part of its effort to diversify its energy
sector and its economy as a whole. As part of this plan it has accepted
bids from Russia, South Korea and the U.S. for the lucrative contract.
Perry's approval is known as a Part 810 authorization, which allows
energy companies to begin the process of planning and starting
preliminary work in anticipation of the closing of a formal deal in the

by U.S. weapons-giant Raytheon -- came forward because of his concern
over the emerging nuclear arms race in the region. The cooperation
between the two countries in helping the Saudis to develop a nuclear
weapons program is just the latest sign of their warming relationship,
with Israel [recently
calling](https://reflection-online.com/2018/05/14/saudi-crown-prince-is-a-partner-of-israel-says-israel-envoy-to-egypt/)
the Saudi crown prince "a partner of Israel."]{.underline}** Israel has
been [a nuclear
power](https://www.mintpressnews.com/why-isnt-anyone-talking-about-israels-nukes/203040/)
for decades, though its nuclear arsenal is undeclared and the country
has refused to sign the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty. Estimates of
its arsenal vary, with [most
suggesting](http://fas.org/nuke/guide/israel/nuke/) that Israel
possesses from 100 to 200 nuclear weapons. Israel was aided in the
development of its nuclear program by Western powers, particularly
France. Much of the Western "help" Israel received, however, was the
result of covert thefts of nuclear material from countries such as [the
United
States](http://thebulletin.org/did-israel-steal-bomb-grade-uranium-united-states7056)
and
[Belgium](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Plumbat#cite_note-gilinsky-20040513-2).
While Dor-On, speaking to news outlet Arabi21, did not elaborate on the
details of the information being exchanged, he stated that the sharing
of this information was likely to be just the beginning of Israeli
involvement in a future Saudi nuclear weapons program, which would
likely see Israel "take the initiative to develop Saudi Arabia's effort
to acquire nuclear weapons" as a result of "the growing Saudi-Israeli
relations." [Both Israel and Saudi Arabia have justified their
acquisition of nuclear weapons by citing concerns about Iran's nuclear
capabilities.]{.underline} However, Iran --- unlike Israel --- has never
developed any nuclear weapons and its capacity to develop one is
virtually nil under the conditions set by the Joint Comprehensive Plan
of Action (JPCOA). Though the U.S. recently left the deal, Iran has
since announced [that it would continue to abide by the agreement if the
other signatories also agreed to do so. Dor-On additionally expressed
his concern over the Saudis' acquiring of nuclear weapons and a wider
nuclear arms race in the region, stating that "this information should
shock us as we see the world is changing for the worse, following the
race for the possession of nuclear weapons that pass right over our
heads in the Middle East."]{.underline} He also noted that [Israel's
decision to begin sharing nuclear secrets with Saudi Arabia was
motivated by a similar offer recently made by Pakistan to the Saudis ---
in which Islamabad had announced its ability to transfer nuclear-weapons
expertise to the Gulf kingdom "within a month" --- stating that the
Israeli government did not want to "leave it \[the development of a
Saudi nuclear program\] solely to Pakistan."]{.underline} Pakistan's
offer was likely related to the fact that the Saudis have long been
widely viewed as the chief financier behind Pakistan's nuclear program.
Saudi nuclear weapons progress and status not clear [While the
announcement that the Saudis may soon develop nuclear weapons with the
help of Israel and other regional players will likely cause concern
throughout the international community, it is hardly the first
indication of Saudi ambition to acquire weapons of mass
destruction.]{.underline} Indeed, Saudi interest in developing nuclear
weapons dates back to the 1970s, when the kingdom learned of major steps
taken by both Israel and India in the development of nuclear armaments.
Not long after financing the Pakistani program, the Saudis procured a
Chinese ballistic missile system capable of carrying nuclear warheads
--- warheads that Pakistan had made for the Saudis in 2013 and were
awaiting delivery, according to [a BBC
report](http://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-24823846) published at
the time. Three years later in 2016, former CIA Operations Officer Duane
Clarridge [confirmed this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qt3trHKqdiM)
to FOX News --- stating that, through their financing of the Pakistani
nuclear program, the Saudis had access to several nuclear bombs.
Clarridge declined to comment on whether those nuclear weapons that had
been "sitting ready for delivery" in Pakistan a few years prior had
since been delivered to Saudi Arabia. More recently, Saudi Crown Prince
Muhammad bin Salman [publicly
announced](https://edition.cnn.com/2018/03/15/middleeast/saudi-arabia-iran-nuclear-weapons-intl/index.html)
this March, during an interview with CBS News, that the country would
seek to develop nuclear weapons, were Iran to do so. In that interview,
the Crown Prince stated that "Saudi Arabia does not want to acquire any
nuclear bomb; but, without a doubt, if Iran developed a nuclear bomb, we
will follow suit as soon as possible." However, he did not make
reference to the claim that the Saudis had already acquired access to
such weapons years prior. Furthermore, around the same time as the Crown
Prince's interview, [reports
surfaced](http://www.presstv.com/Detail/2018/03/02/554086/Saudi-Arabia-US-nuclear-deal-missiles-Trump-Salman-Iran)
claiming that the Saudis had asked the United States for permission to
enrich uranium with the goal of producing a nuclear weapon.

## Impacts -- Russia

### Arms Sales Key -- Internal Link

#### US arms sales are key to deter Russian expansion - Russia has displayed they have the will and the capability

Time,\" Belfer Center for Science and International Affairs,

In recent years [Russia has staged a comeback in the Mideast, big
time,]{.underline} to the extent that [it may replace the United States
as the leading foreign power in the region.]{.underline} Russia\'s
[success has been a combination of both deft diplomacy as well as
weapons and nuclear reactor sales to states throughout the
region,]{.underline} from Iran to Morocco. The weakness of U.S. regional
policy under the Obama administration, followed by the total [chaos
under Trump,]{.underline} have [further contributed to Russia\'s
success.]{.underline} **[Russian policy has]{.underline}** been
sophisticated, but has also **[benefited from the void left by the
United States.]{.underline}** President Putin\'s fundamental strategic
objective is to restore Russian global leadership, or to put it somewhat
less delicately, to stick it to the United States wherever possible. His
primary problem is that [Russia does not have that much to offer
today,]{.underline} it cannot compete with the United States and Western
countries on an economic level, or alternatively on a diplomatic one,
and [**all it does have to offer is weapons, nuclear technology,** and
energy. The Middle East is one of the primary regions in the world in
which Russia can pursue its ambitions]{.underline} today. [Most global
weapons sales are with Middle Eastern states, and a race is underway
among them to procure nuclear power reactors.]{.underline} Moscow\'s
willingness to sell them weapons and reactors, and to maintain close
relations with rogue regimes such as those in Damascus and Teheran,
provide it with a degree of influence that it does not have in much of
the rest of the world. [In Syria]{.underline}, with a minimal deployment
of two fighter squadrons, [Russia succeeded in turning the tide in the
civil war, stabilized the Assad regime]{.underline}, and defended it
from accusations that it had repeatedly used chemical weapons, despite
the clear proof that it has done so. [Russia]{.underline} allowed Iran
and its affiliated militias to do the bleeding on the ground in Syria,
while it [hardly paid any price at all for intervening.]{.underline} In
so doing, it has put paid to Obama\'s fears of intervention, lest the
United States become mired in the Syrian quagmire, and his prophecy that
Syria would become the Russian Vietnam. The fact that Russia is the only
player in Syria today that maintains relations with all of the sides
involved has turned it into the leading actor there and the only one
that just may be able to bring about a diplomatic resolution of the
domestic crisis and prevent a direct conflict between Iran and Israel.
Russia has also succeeding in ensuring that its presence in Syria, in
the Hamimim airbase and Latakia naval base, will be for the long-term.
Advanced S300 and S400 air defense systems --- manned so far solely by
Russian personnel --- have been deployed in Syria to defend these bases,
which provide Russia with the ability to project power throughout the
Middle East. [**In Egypt,** after four decades in which Cairo has been
aligned entirely with the United States, **Putin succeeded in using the
regime\'s anger towards Washington, following**]{.underline} Mubarak\'s
ouster and [U**.S. sanctions on arms sales, in order to deepen
relations.**]{.underline} [Military ties have been renewed, including
the sale of approximately fifty MIG 29 fighters and a similar number of
attack helicopters, S300 missiles, and joint military exercises. **The
two countries are now cooperating**]{.underline} in Libya, including the
deployment of a small Russian military force in western Egypt. Last year
**[a deal was concluded for]{.underline}** the provision of [**four
Russian nuclear power reactors to Egypt.** **Saudi
Arabia**]{.underline}, which has long lived under an American security
umbrella, is now afraid to continue placing all of its \"strategic
eggs\" in the American basket and [**has also improved ties with
Russia.** The first visit ever of a Saudi king in Russia took place last
year, and the crown prince has also visited since then.]{.underline}
**[A deal for the sale of]{.underline}** S400 and [**antitank missiles
has been signed, as well as a nuclear cooperation agreement**, in
preparation for Russian participation in a Saudi tender for the first
two out of sixteen planned nuclear power reactors]{.underline}. Saudi
Arabia and Russia, which jointly account for some 20 percent of the
world\'s oil production, **[have also begun investing in joint energy
projects and,]{.underline}** more importantly**[, to coordinate moves in
order to bring about a cut in the global supply of oil and a price
hike.]{.underline}** For decades Russia has maintained a strategic
relationship with Iran. A Security Council resolution prevents
resumption of arms sales to Iran until 2020, but [talks are underway
regarding the sale of fighter aircraft, tanks, and artillery,
and]{.underline} [Russia has already supplied Iran with S300
missiles.]{.underline} The U.S. withdrawal from the nuclear agreement
and the resumption of sanctions on Iran, make it even more dependent on
Moscow and both strategic and economic cooperation between the two,
including a possible free-trade zone, is expanding further. Turkey is
going ahead with the purchase of S400 missiles, over the protestations
of its NATO allies and despite the threat the deal poses to the future
of the alliance. Morocco, Bahrain, and Qatar are also interested in the
S400[**. Russia has concluded large arms sales with the UAE and a
nuclear cooperation agreement with Tunisia. Russia is now interested in
naval bases in Libya**.]{.underline} Lebanon, too, has become a focus of
Russian interest, in the attempt to reduce U.S. influence in that
country. Russia has offered Lebanon a large arms sale at zero interest
and expressed interest in air and naval bases. Russian firms have also
competed for oil and gas exploration tenders in Lebanese territorial
waters. Russian weapons have reached Hezbollah, apparently through Syria
and/or Iran, without Moscow making a major effort to prevent this. At
the same time that it has deepened ties with Arab states, Russia has
also succeeded in establishing a strong relationship with Israel and
creating growing Israeli dependence on it. Iranian entrenchment in Syria
and the prospects of a direct Israeli-Iranian conflict, with Hezbollah
as well, depend to a large extent today on Moscow. As the only power
that has strategic relations with Iran, the crisis over its nuclear
program, following the U.S. withdrawal from the nuclear agreement, may
provide Russia with a unique role in the efforts to bring the sides back
to the table and to reach a \"better\" deal[. It is not for nothing that
Prime Minister Netanyahu has repeatedly made urgent visits to Moscow
every few months.]{.underline} The United States is Israel\'s strategic
ally, but it has adopted a diminished role on issues of vital importance
for Israel's national security, making Israel increasingly dependent on
Moscow. There have been conflicting reports so far regarding Moscow\'s
willingness to take Israel\'s security concerns into account. Trump has
sought to disrupt long-established strategic realities everywhere. In
the Middle East, he has succeeded in causing mayhem, clearing the way
for Russia and Iran.

#### Strong Saudi-US relations are necessary to stave off Russian influence -- ending arms sales plays right into the hands of Russia.

This is exactly what Erdogan wants. Erdogan is pushing for rapid
Islamization and rollback of Western influences in Turkish schools, with
women being strongly encouraged if not pressured into covering their
hair and dressing increasingly more conservatively from young ages and
in schools. None other than Washington Post published an article to that
effect just in February 2018, discussing the spread of Shari'a through
Turkish institutions. But there was no widespread outrage. WaPo has
devoted as much space to Khashoggi's disappearance and apparent demise
as to the entirety of Erdogan's attacks on his own citizens, ranging
from Kurdish civilians to social and civic institutions. Mohammed bin
Salman's incremental social progress threatens to bring Saudi Arabia in
exactly the opposite direction, undermining Erdogan's vision of an
Islamic "caliphate" under his leadership. Attacks on apolitical entities
such as MiSK are not random or coincidental. The Saudis have made a
strategic mistake in not responding to these political attacks
assertively and through Western media outlets, rather than through
Twitter wars, where they are at the mercy of the company's policies, or
through Gulf-based media conglomerates, which enjoy a very limited
audience in the West. Turkey, however, is not the only beneficiary of
Saudis' poor grasp of PR or Western intransigence. [Russia and Qatar
have teamed up to attack US-Saudi relations in what increasingly appears
to be a coordinated series of moves]{.underline}. For instance, Deutsche
Welle, a German government-funded outlet, reprinted the Middle East Eye,
a Qatari press which frequently coordinates its content with the
government-funded Al Jazeera. The article claims that the United States
looks to interfere with the Saudi governance by forcing the Royal Family
to replace Mohammed bin Salman with his uncle, King Salman's younger
brother Ahmad bin Abdulaziz, who, supposedly, spent 45 days grooming
himself for that role by touring the US and EU this past year. If no one
has ever heard of it the reason might be because whether or not he has
traveled anywhere, not one in the Western press outlets at the time
deemed his visit worthy of coverage. Indeed, Prince Ahmad is likely very
low on the totem pole in the line of succession, whatever it is. But
accuracy is irrelevant when it comes to stirring up outrage. Why would
DW reprint this baseless conspiracy theory? The outlet's politics may
reflect the German government's. The outgoing Chancellor Angela Merkel
has investments in Russia, which has taught this method of information
warfare first to Iran, and now, apparently, to Qatar. She is also bitter
about the major German banks and companies affected by US reimposition
of sanctions on Iran after the withdrawal of nuclear deal. German
government was the first in Europe to cancel its arms deal with KSA,
even though the investigation of Khashoggi's death has not been
completed yet. In other words, the German government has a pro-Russia,
pro-Iran, anti-Saudi agenda -- so its outlets will gladly turn a blind
eye to the quality of reporting so long as it fits the agenda. [In
Russia, reporting itself is a branch of government, and information
warfare is taken to an art form]{.underline}. [RT reported a similar
story -- that supposedly the Crown Prince is isolated within his own
family, abandoned, and struggling. It dragged down a former Pentagon
official as "witness" of such developments]{.underline}, though the
likelihood that some former midlevel official would have access to the
inner sanctum of the secretive family is quite low. Russia's Channel 1,
which is geared towards internal consumption, produced an entire program
focused on what evidence Erdogan allegedly has against the Crown Prince,
and how Mohammed bin Salman is allegedly is on his way out. As its star
analyst, Channel 1 produced a former Reagan national security official,
now with the pro-Russia Center for National Interest, Geoffrey Kemp.
Most of this "analysis' was based on pure speculation, as, of course,
none of the talking heads actually has any access to the Saudis, or, for
that matter, the upper echelons in Turkey. But [the game underfoot is
pretty obvious: to portray the Saudi government as divided, conflicted,
and on the verge of falling]{.underline}. More importantly, [from
Russia's and Qatar's perspective, this is an opportunity to show that
Mohammed bin Salman no longer has the White House's backing, and in
fact, that President Trump's recent criticism of the Crown Prince show
that the administration is pushing for him to be replaced]{.underline}.
Indeed, [President Trump's recent comments play right into this
information warfare campaign]{.underline}. For instance, recently he
claimed the Saudis misused American bombs in their attacks on the
Iran-backed Houthi rebels in Yemen, which led to significant civilian
casualties -- in part due to fluidity of intelligence, and in part due
to Houthi hostage taking of entire populated areas. Even if the
administration has no intention of halting arms sales or taking any
other punitive measures, the damage of such public statements is obvious
and extensive. Trump just publicly demonstrated he has no confidence in
the ally the United States is supporting in Yemen. Worse, however, is
the fact that such statements ultimately boomerang at the United States:
why was the intelligence US sharing with its allies so flawed? Why was
the US not training Saudi pilots to aim better? Why weren't there any
significant joint Air Force training operations throughout the aerial
campaign? Who, if anyone, is monitoring the scope of Houthis' actions on
the ground? Where did the United States THINK those bombs were going?
And why, if the Saudis were being so bad, did Secretary Mattis praise
Mohammed bin Salman in an unusual move during his visit to the United
States in March? President Trump's comments invite more questions than
they answer. In what way did the Saudis misuse the bombs? Were they
being deliberately malicious? Reckless and negligent? Were they using
excessive, disproportionate force -- according to military experts? Were
they using them for campaigns that were not coordinated with the United
States? Were they using them in places other than what was agreed upon?
And how on earth did the US military miss the fact that a key member of
the coalition in Yemen was doing something it wasn't supposed to, and
failed to take appropriate measures when it could have made a
difference? In other words, why aren't we talking with our "friends"?
All these are very interesting questions, which hopefully will be
answered in due time. However, even without having that information at
hand, there is a couple of easily observable factors. First, President
Trump made those comments likely under the influence of someone who
wanted to bring attention to whatever the issues may be with the Saudis
right before the midterms. That someone is very likely to be Senator
Rand Paul, who has been championing US pullout from Yemen for at least a
year. [These comments again seem aligned with a different campaign to
withdraw from Yemen, organized in the media, likely with the assistance
of political operatives and foreign intelligence agencies,]{.underline}
as Lee Smith explains in his recent column**. [Anything that weakens
US-Saudi alliance]{.underline}**[, or that makes the Saudis look like a
weak, bad, and unneeded ally **plays right into the hands of its enemies
-- Russia**]{.underline}, Qatar, Turkey, and Iran. [Russia understands
well that despite an occasional entente with KSA over oil related
matters, it has always been a traditional Western ally. It is also fully
aware, however, that Alwaleed bin Talal, one of Jamal Khashoggi's
backers, is the son of "The Red Prince ", who sympathized with the
Soviet Union and leftist positions]{.underline}. These relationships and
rivalries are not new. [Doing business with the West is one thing.
Gaining a geostrategic advantage whenever possible is
another]{.underline}. [**The ideal outcome for Russia in this matter is
the** significant **weakening in the relations between the Saudis and
the US,** **with an eye to either woo the Saudis into its own sphere of
influence and gain support for Russian presence in the Middle
East**]{.underline}, or to cause the downfall of the Crown Prince in
favor of the old guard, with the likelihood of exploiting arising
divisions. Bin Talal, who sold New York's famed Plaza hotel to the
Qataris, perhaps as an act of vengeance for his detention by bin Salman,
has no issues with Qatar, and certainly places his personal interests
above the family's agenda, as represented by its current leadership. The
presence of such figures is no doubt advantageous to external
adversaries of the Crown Prince, even if they are not in direct contact.
That said, under Mohammed bin Salman's predecessor, former Crown Prince
Mohammed bin Nayef, Turki al Faisal, [Khashoggi's other backer had a
significant interest in managing the Yemen situation with
Russia]{.underline}. [Khashoggi even made an appearance at the Valdai
International Discussion Club, where President Putin often makes an
appearance.]{.underline} That took place in the spring of 2017, shortly
before the then-Deputy Crown Prince displaced bin Nayef. [One of the
speeches directly referenced upcoming discussions of Yemen between
Moscow and Riyadh. Thus, both Khashoggi himself and his backers had
significant ties to Russia.]{.underline} Whether or not bin Talal ended
up working with either Russia or is with Qatar in fueling anti-Crown
Prince propaganda is unclear, but he very likely backed Jamal
Khashoggi's role in breeding such sentiments in the West. Bin Talal and
Turki Al Faisal were both part of bin Nayef's inner circle, and likely
shared same views on policy. Khashoggi, if we recall, was particularly
obsessed with the war in Yemen, and wrote about it, very badly, in
multiple comments. It's unclear if his alternative views on Saudi
Arabia's and Russia's role in Yemen went behind suggestions and talking
points in article -- or whether he continued to perform the role of a
middleman even after his boss was displaced. What is clear, however, is
that [Russia's interests in Yemen are best served when the United States
is not involved there in any capacity]{.underline}. And Qatar, which was
forced out of the coalition with the imposition of the blockade, is said
to have switched sides and providing intelligence and other forms of
assistance to the Houthis. [Russia's and Qatar's joint interests don't
end with weakening the Saudis wherever possible]{.underline}. [The two
countries, along with Iran, are part of a gas cartel and see real
business opportunities at stake]{.underline}. [Rivalry over access to
natural gas is the economic side of the tensions pitting Iran and Qatar
against Saudi Arabia.]{.underline} New oil sanctions on Iran further
inhibit its activities; Iran is forced to share a vast gas field with
Qatar, and to rely in Qatar on exploiting the field. Weakening Saudi
Arabia through continuous terrorism from Yemen, international
opprobrium, and arms sanctions would, in Tehran's view, balance out its
own deplorable position. [Russian and Qatari information warfare
campaign is peaking up steam, thanks to happy collaboration from the
Western press and other institutions]{.underline}. For instance, [the
Gates Foundation severed ties with a charity started by Mohammed bin
Salman]{.underline}. The rationale is reputational damage and
appearances; whether or not anyone's actual interests are being served
here -- such as people who could have benefited from joint work -- do
not seem to concern Bill Gates and his wife. [Each such incident
contributes to the overall impression that the Crown Prince is isolated
and that no one needs him or wants anything to do with him. Appearance
of powerlessness makes it easier for others to make the choice of
abandoning the Saudis]{.underline}, creating a self-fulfilling prophecy.
Furthermore, by signaling that the United States has a particular policy
outlook on Saudi governance, which, in fact it clearly does not (in a
stark example of disinformation), while simultaneously pushing other
angles within the US government through various channels to make it seem
like the administration is moving away from full support of the KSA, the
adversaries of the Saudis are pushing an insidious agenda in creating a
discontent in Saudi Arabia, and suspicion towards its counterparts in
the West. Under the flow of this information, as well as an influx of
investors, running for the exit, this disinformation campaign is also
designed to apply additional psychological pressure on the Crown Prince,
and to make him feel more isolated and friendless than he actually is.
It is a fairly standard Cold War active measure. Turkey plays an
important role in that regard by supplying an endless array of
disinformation and half truths as the closest entity with access to the
events on the ground. Turkey and Russia have their differences, but
Qatar has essentially become Erdogan's financial patron. For the time
being, all these countries share the same narrow goal in isolating and
weakening Saudi Arabia, though individual interests in the downfall of
its dynamic and pro-Western government may differ. The creation of
internal paranoia inside the Saudi echelons further the impression that
Mohammed bin Salman is unfit to lead or has lost the trust of the White
House. That in itself creates pressure inside the royal family, which
his enemies are free to exploit through moles, "anonymous" leakers to
the Western press, and others who smell blood and are angling for a
potential role in any future government. For now, many are angry with
the Western press, however, for taking an anti-Saudi stand that goes far
beyond criticizing the Crown Prince. In the last few days, Washington
Post alone has published dozens of anti-Saudi articles, not one of them
focusing on the lives of average citizens or providing a balanced
outlook on governance and achievements under Mohammed bin Salman. All of
them are conspiratorial, and largely inspired by Turkish talking points.
In turn, many Saudis are now pushing for the boycott of Amazon, which
bought up WaPo. Up until this point many particularly younger Saudis
were under impression that Americans are pro-Saudi and are generally
welcoming of the reforms. Few have realized that suspicions of Middle
Easterners, monarchies, and Saudi Arabia's Wahhabist past run deeper
than government-level commercial and defense interests, which seem
transient to most people. [To counter the influx of Russian and Qatari
propaganda, the Saudi government should engage in open conversations
with its American counterparts]{.underline}. [Both governments should
engage in joint confidence building measures, such as the recent joint
sanctions against Hizbullah, which would dispell the negative
perceptions formed by Russian and Qatari efforts]{.underline}. The Saudi
government should also push for greater people-to-people engagement
between the two nations, to ensure that bonds are build that will ensure
the continuation of a strong alliance despite all challenges, and which
will outlast the most pervasive of information wars that are being
conducted by mutual enemies[. As for the administration, it should
strongly consider the appearances, and before seeking to humiliate its
own allies, it should **ask itself whether perhaps building them up
instead may serve us all better in the end**]{.underline}

#### Curbing arms sales bolsters Russia-Saudi alliance

**Mammadov, 19** \[Rauf, resident scholar on energy policy at The Middle
East Institute. 2-5-2019, \"Growing ties with Russia could strain
Saudi-US relations,\" Middle East Institute,
https://www.mei.edu/publications/growing-ties-russia-could-strain-saudi-us-relations/7-27-19///ra\]

With more of their geopolitical goals aligning, [ties between Riyadh and
Moscow are growing closer]{.underline}, and the kingdom plans to invest
billions of additional dollars in Russian petroleum and other projects.
One of the clearest signs that the world's two largest crude exporters
were putting their rivalry behind them came in 2017, when [King Salman
became the first reigning Saudi monarch [to visit
Russia](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/oct/05/saudi-russia-visit-putin-oil-middle-east).]{.underline}
Rising oil and gas prices have accelerated the Saudi-Russia detente,
even though the Trump administration removed a major point of contention
with the kingdom in 2018 by scrapping the Obama administration's 2015
Iran nuclear deal. Saudi Arabia deeply resented the deal, which removed
U.S. sanctions that hurt the economy and limited the geopolitical clout
of its biggest regional rival. [Moscow's pivot to the Arabian Gulf has
meshed neatly with the Saudis' decision after the nuclear deal was
implemented to]{.underline} rely not just on their longtime strategic
partner --- the United States --- but to [hedge their bets between
Washington, Moscow, and Beijing.]{.underline} [Although the Trump
administration scrapped the Iran nuclear deal,]{.underline}
[the]{.underline} [Saudis remain wary and have decided to continue
cultivating political and economic ties with Russia]{.underline} and
China. An important result was that [Riyadh and Moscow skirted their
geopolitical differences over Iran and Syria]{.underline} to focus on
stabilizing the price of oil, the lifeline of their two economies. The
OPEC+ deal that Saudi Arabia and Russia spearheaded has surprised the
skeptics by keeping oil prices stable for two years. Moscow proved how
indispensable it was to the agreement by convincing Iran and 11 non-OPEC
producers to stick with the production cuts it required. In a way, [the
Kremlin was reciprocating for help that Saudi Arabia had provided in
2016, when U.S. sanctions against Russia worsened an
economy]{.underline} already reeling from low oil prices. The sanctions,
which Washington imposed for Moscow's takeover of Crimea and support for
eastern Ukrainian separatists, prevented state-owned Russian energy
companies from obtaining long-term financing from Western banks. To
avoid becoming too dependent on Chinese money, Russia turned to the
cash-rich Gulf states. Most Gulf investments in Russia are funneled
through the Russian Direct Investment Fund. Saudi Arabia's sovereign
wealth fund ([SWF]{.underline}), known as the Public Investment Fund,
has already pumped \$2.5 billion into the Russian fund for joint
projects. It [plans to invest another [\$10
billion](http://www.arabnews.com/node/1440521/business-economy)
later.]{.underline} The Saudi SWF, run by Crown Prince
[M]{.underline}ohammad [bi]{.underline}n [S]{.underline}alman, [is
considering financing additional Russian projects in]{.underline} a
range of sectors, including [petrochemicals, power,
logistics]{.underline}, transport [infrastructure,]{.underline} [and
retail]{.underline}. In return, the [Russia]{.underline}n fund [has
pledged to line up a ["significant"
number](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-russia-sarabia-novatek/russian-fund-builds-investors-pool-for-saudi-aramco-ipo-idUSKCN1FZ0PV)
of Russian buyers for Saudi Aramco shares if the oil giant goes public
as part of a potential \$100 billion offering.]{.underline} On the flip
side of the coin, the Saudis have shown interest in acquiring
substantial stakes in Sibur, Russia's largest petrochemicals operation,
and Eurasia Drilling Company, its largest independent drilling concern.
Another intriguing development was Saudi Energy Minister Khalid
al-Falih's announcement that an agreement for the Saudis to [acquire
shares](https://www.constructionweekonline.com/168493-saudi-arabia-oil-company-aramco-finalises-russia-deal)
of the Russian oil and gas equipment manufacturer Novomet will be
finalized this month. In conjunction with the deal, Novomet will supply
the first Russian-made oil and gas equipment to Saudi Aramco and other
companies in the kingdom. Meanwhile, a partnership between Saudi Aramco,
Japan's Mitsui, and the Russian Direct Investment Fund is considering
acquiring a 30 to 40 percent stake in Novatek's \$25-billion [Arctic
LNG-2
project](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-russia-novatek-lng-mitsui-exclusive/exclusive-mitsui-saudi-aramco-russias-rdif-in-talks-to-buy-arctic-lng-2-stakes-sources-idUSKCN1OK1GR).
A deal would go a long way toward helping Russia achieve its ambitious
goal of becoming a major competitor of Qatar and Australia, the world's
two largest liquefied natural gas exporters. Although [Saudi-Russian
relations]{.underline} are nascent, there is no question they [are
growing]{.underline}. This may be [in part because the two regimes'
tradition of authoritarianism has helped them find a common
language.]{.underline} While stabilizing oil markets has been their
major achievement, the embattled Russian economy has also benefited from
Saudi investment. The Trump administration has criticized OPEC's
production cuts, but it has been quiet about Saudi Arabia's
rapprochement with Russia. The development certainly has not gone
unnoticed, however. Although [the]{.underline} [Saudis]{.underline} are
enjoying much warmer relations with the Trump administration than with
the Obama administration, and still recognize the strategic importance
of ties with the United States, they have [show]{.underline}n [no signs
they will stop cozying up to the Russians. This could create a serious
strain with Washington down the road.]{.underline}

### Russia Alliance -- Internal Link 

#### Stressing the alliance causes Russia to fill in

strategist, \"Let's be clear: Vladimir Putin will be happy to welcome
Saudi Arabia into Moscow's orbit if the U.S. cuts Riyadh loose. (Here

mmv)

A ferocious debate over this question is raging in Washington at this
very moment, and the stakes are high.

[On one side of the debate are many in the media]{.underline}, along
with numerous former advisors to President Barack Obama. [They have
never liked how close Washington has been with Riyadh and they are
freshly determined to smash the Saudis in the mouth because of the
murder of Jamal Khashoggi, the Saudi journalist]{.underline}.

Most of these voices had no problem with President Obama cutting a
nuclear deal with Iran --- one of America's most dangerous enemies and
certainly the worst terrorist state on the planet. Despite Iran's
history of murdering thousands of their own people and others throughout
the Middle East (now especially in Syria and Yemen), these voices saw no
problem with providing the ayatollahs with \$150 billion in cash,
removing economic sanctions from Iran, or legitimizing Tehran's
previously illegal enrichment of uranium. They never once during the
process seriously tried to require Iran to stop funding terrorism,
building longer range missiles, or sowing seeds of revolution and
destruction throughout the Middle East. But the Saudis, oh the Saudis,
these folks claim, these are the blood-thirsty despots who really need
to be punished.

[What's more, a growing number of Republicans on Capitol Hill are also
ready to impose severe punishments on the entire Saudi government over
the Khashoggi affair. Some are calling into question the nature of the
alliance itself]{.underline}.

[On the other side of the debate are those who fully agree that the
Khashoggi murder was despicable and must be punished, but are calling
for cooler heads to prevail when it comes to upending American policy in
the Gulf region]{.underline}. They make the case that [we need the
Saudis to help us counter Iran and Russia in the Middle
East]{.underline}, to help us fight the Radicals like al Qaeda, ISIS and
the Muslim Brotherhood, to keep oil flowing, [and hopefully to advance
Arab-Israeli peace]{.underline}.

[They make the case that the 33 year-old Saudi Crown Prince is making
bold, serious, and important reforms at home, and wants to work more
closely with the U.S. and the West. Yes, he has made mistakes, even
serious ones. But he should be helped, coached, encouraged, not cut
loose]{.underline}.

What's more, [these voices caution that punishing the entire Saudi
government --- rather than targeting the operatives responsible for the
crime --- would be a serious mistake, one that could rupture the
alliance. Some worry that if Washington hits the Saudis too hard, this

### Russia Bad -- War

[As U.S. President Donald Trump's administration ratchets up pressure on
Iran, **the U.S. Defense Department is warning Moscow and Tehran against
cooperating in the Middle East, a relationship that a senior Pentagon
official said could further destabilize the region.**]{.underline}
During a May 30 event in Washington, D.C., [Kathryn Wheelbarger, the
acting assistant secretary of defense for international security
affairs, warned of Russia and Iran's creeping influence in the Middle
East, saying **both have "revisionist ambitions" that will negatively
impact U.S. partners in the region.**]{.underline} "Even understanding
historical mistrust between Moscow and Tehran, [the United States and
the region must be mindful when revisionist powers
cooperate,"]{.underline} Wheelbarger said. "We are watching this
relationship closely." She also harshly criticized Russia, continuing
the administration policy of delivering rhetorical blows to Moscow even
as Trump has often been reluctant to criticize Russian President
Vladimir Putin personally[. Wheelbarger painted Russia as an unreliable
and dishonest partner and said Moscow's relationship with Iran in
particular is an example of this duplicity. "Russia's attempts to be
amenable to all regional players---irrespective of regional animosities
and conflicting national interests---is a strategy likely to create
implicit distrust and distance]{.underline}," Wheelbarger said. "By
striving to accommodate all sides in regional disputes[, Russia shows it
cannot be trusted when true choices need to be made or friends need to
be known." Wheelbarger's comments, which appear designed to drive a
wedge between Iran and Russia, an influential player in the Middle East,
come as the Trump administration aims to squeeze Tehran economically and
militarily.]{.underline} One year after withdrawing from a landmark 2015
nuclear deal, the United States has in recent weeks reimposed sanctions,
blacklisted Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps as a terrorist
group, and deployed additional troops and military equipment to the
Persian Gulf in response to an unspecified threat[. U.S. National
Security Advisor John Bolton]{.underline}, who has previously called for
the overthrow of the "mullahs' regime" in Tehran, [claimed]{.underline}
without evidence [this week that Iran was behind a May 12 attack on four
commercial ships in the Gulf of Oman. Tehran has repeatedly denied any
involvement in the incident]{.underline}. Russia appears mindful of U.S.
concerns about its relationship with Iran. Moscow reportedly rejected
Tehran's request to buy the S-400 missile defense system over worries
the sale would stoke more tension in the Middle East. Mark Katz, a
professor at George Mason University, warned that U.S. regional partners
that are hoping that Moscow will limit Tehran's actions in the Middle
East will likely be disappointed. The two nations are already working
together in the region, he stressed. "[We need to convince both our
Middle Eastern allies and also elsewhere that Russia and Iran together
are a problem for us,"]{.underline} Katz said. "Those in the Middle East
concerned about Iran need to understand that working with Russia is not
necessarily going to help them with Iran." Wheelbarger also noted that
Russia's military has significant limitations, pointing out that even
for those countries it has promised to defend, Moscow avoids "real
military confrontation." For example, Israel's military strikes in Syria
continue to degrade Iranian positions; meanwhile, Russia failed to
contest U.S. strikes on Syria in response to the regime's use of
chemical weapons. Ukrainian Prime Minister Arseniy Yatsenyuk and
government ministers react prior to the voting of the government
resignation at the parliament in Kiev on Feb. 16, 2016. By comparison,
[the United States maintains tens of thousands of troops in the region
at multiple bases, she stressed. Wheelbarger also cautioned allies
against buying arms from Russia,]{.underline} saying that unlike
military sales with the United States, these transactions do not come
with long-term commitments such as maintenance, training, and
interoperability. She highlighted a U.S. law imposing sanctions on
countries that engage in significant arms deals with Russia, the
Countering America's Adversaries Through Sanctions Act, or CAATSA. "This
law exists for good reason---[Russia seeks to exploit partner
vulnerabilities and regional challenges for its own advantage," she
said, noting that the United States will continue using the CAATSA
sanctions if necessary.]{.underline} Wheelbarger seized the opportunity
to issue an implicit warning to Turkey that the United States could
impose CAATSA sanctions if Ankara follows through on a plan to purchase
Russia's S-400 missile system, [which U.S. officials say is a threat to
the F-35 fighter jet. "Completion of this transaction would be
devastating,"]{.underline} she said. "Let's be clear---[the S-400 is a
Russian system designed to shoot down aircraft like the F-35, and it is
inconceivable to imagine Russia not taking advantage of the collection
opportunity."]{.underline}

### Russia Bad -- Syria War

#### Russian influence in the Middle East allows for Syrian war to escalate and go global 

**Axe, 19** \[David, 6-14-2019, \"Russian Air Raids Signal Bloody
Escalation in Syria,\" Daily Beast,
<https://www.thedailybeast.com/russian-air-raids-signal-bloody-escalation-in-syria>/7/28/19//ra\]

The Syrian civil war had seemed to grow quieter in early 2019 as battle
lines stabilized and air raids became less frequent. Now, with Russia
targeting a rebel-controlled area this week[, the air war is back on. A
ground assault]{.underline} soon [could follow]{.underline}. Syria has
all but disappeared from the news in many countries. Perhaps for that
reason it's a low priority for the administration of President Trump.
But the [fighting and the dying are getting worse as the war drags into
its eighth year.]{.underline} Monday's [air raids are an extension of a
bombing campaign that began in April and reportedly has killed more than
1,500 people. Monitors in Syria told Reuters that Russian Sukhoi
warplanes]{.underline} on Monday [dropped bombs on Jabala and Khan
Sheikhoun and other towns in Idlib province.]{.underline} Rescuers
reported pulling at least 25 bodies from the rubble. **[Despite
territorial gains]{.underline}** [in recent years by a combined force of
Syrian troops and Syrian- and Iranian-led militias, **all backed by
Russian missiles and air power,** part of Hama and Idlib **provinces**
in northwest Syria, just south of Turkey, **largely remain under the
control of rebel and militant groups.** **As many as 3 million people
live in opposition-controlled communities in Idlib and
Hama.**]{.underline} Around 270,000 of them have fled since Russian air
attacks intensified in April, according to the Century Foundation, a New
York City think tank. Since **[Russia's intervention]{.underline}** in
2015 **[tipped the balance of power]{.underline}** in the region **[in
favor of the regime of]{.underline}** Syrian strongman **[Bashar
al-Assad]{.underline}**, pro-regime forces have pursued the same
strategy. **[Russian warplanes bomb opposition forces as well as
civilians in opposition-controlled towns, softening up resistance for an
eventual ground assault by Syrian forces and Iranian-backed
militias.]{.underline}** "I think anyone who is following Syria closely
realises that the battle for Idlib will be one of the final major
actions of the conflict," Eliot Higgins, a Syria expert and founder of
Bellingcat, told The Daily Beast. [After]{.underline} heavy rebel losses
and mergers and [abortive attempts by the United States]{.underline} and
its allies [to train anti-regime fighters,]{.underline} two groups have
come to dominate what remains of the Syrian opposition. Hay'et Tahrir al
Sham is an affiliation of Islamic militants. Jaysh al Izza includes the
survivors of the U.S.-backed Free Syrian Army. Both groups rely on
financing from Turkey and the Gulf states. Money and manpower are short.
"Right now, both appear to be receiving only enough supplies and
reinforcements only to maintain their front lines \[and\] sporadically
launch counterattacks," Tom Cooper, an author and independent military
expert, told The Daily Beast. [Hospitals and clinics are among the
Russians' favorite targets.]{.underline} Air raids since April have
damaged or destroyed around two dozen medical facilities, the Century
Foundation claimed. The Russian Defense Ministry did not respond to a
request for comment. The Kremlin's goal, Cooper said, is to "make life
for the remaining population in rebel- \[or\] insurgent-controlled areas
impossible \[and\] drive that population out so as to destroy the local
support for the enemy combatants and deny their legitimacy." [Don't
expect world powers or international bodies to do anything to stop the
attacks on medical facilities.]{.underline} "The international community
has done nothing about these sort of air strikes for the past eight
years of conflict," Higgins said. "There's currently a lack of interest
and leadership from the White House," Higgins added. "Trump's actions on
Syria seems to be fueled by Fox News coverage and whatever world leader
has recently given him the nicest compliments." The U.S.-led Combined
Joint Task Force Operation Inherent Resolve, which oversees operations
targeting ISIS militants in Syria and Iraq, told The Daily Beast the
Russian air raids are none of its business. "CJTF-OIR remains focused on
the enduring defeat of Daesh," the coalition stated, using a slang term
for ISIS. Tragically, the United Nations inadvertently might have helped
the Russians. Some hospitals in opposition-controlled areas voluntarily
shared their GPS coordinates with the Russians as part of the United
Nations' "humanitarian deconfliction" initiative, all in the hope that
Moscow would order its warplanes to steer clear. "It doesn't seem to be
helping," analyst Aron Lund wrote for the Century Foundation. "Some
officials and activists now wonder if the 'no-strike list' is being used
to locate and destroy hospitals---the very opposite of what the U.N.
intended." Russia Moscow justifies the attacks by mischaracterizing the
Syrian opposition. "Moscow's official position is Idlib and Hama became
a safe haven for terrorists and need to be liberated from them," Pavel
Luzin, a professor of international relations at Russia's Perm
University, told The Daily Beast. The scale of the Russian air war
belies the Kremlin's desperation. Russian President Vladimir Putin as
far back as 2017 declared victory in Syria, underscoring his eagerness
to extricate his country from the Syrian quagmire. But **[Putin wants to
exit the war]{.underline}** on favorable terms for Russia, **[with a
strong ally]{.underline}** firmly in power **[in Syria
and]{.underline}** diplomatic [**leverage over the United**
States]{.underline} and its allies, according to Luzin.

### Russia Bad -- Oil 

#### Saudi-Russian consolidation over OPEC is fading away -- the plan causes Russian control of the oil market 

**Cunningham** 2/6/**19** (Nick Cunningham is a freelance writer on oil
and gas, renewable energy, climate change, energy policy and geopolitics
at oilprice.com; "How Washington Could Spoil The OPEC+ Alliance" ;

; Accessed 7/27/2019)

[OPEC and Russia are officially working to establish a formal alliance
that would allow for the indefinite management of the oil
market.]{.underline} The OPEC/non-OPEC coalition, often referred to as
["OPEC+", has presided over two rounds of production cuts since early
2017]{.underline}. The deals were one-off affairs, viewed as temporary
emergency measures to erase a painful glut of supply that was draining
the coffers of all oil producers alike. [But why not make the
partnership official?]{.underline} The Wall Street Journal
[[reports](https://www.wsj.com/articles/opec-pursues-formal-pact-with-russia-11549394604)
that such negotiations are underway]{.underline}. This is not the first
time we have heard about a formal OPEC+ partnership. [Last year, the two
sides, led by Saudi Arabia and Russia, discussed such an eventuality,
but ultimately backed off.]{.underline} The idea of a formal OPEC+
architecture has an obvious logic. Together[, OPEC+ controls over 40
percent of global oil supply. Combining their production volumes to
tweak output levels here and there in order to achieve stability -- or,
rather to obtain a desired price level -- is much more easily achieved
by coordinating their actions. They are stronger together rather than
apart.]{.underline} Moreover, [the idea of a formal alliance has been
predicated on the strengthening of strategic ties between Russia and
Saudi Arabia]{.underline}. The two governments have grown closer over
the past few years. The Saudis see the upside of moving closer to
another global power, particularly after they grew suspicious of the
U.S. government following the 2015 Iran nuclear deal**. [From Moscow's
perspective, they can peel off an American ally and strengthen their
position in the Middle East]{.underline}**[. There are also growing
economic ties between the two countries aside from the oil
sector.]{.underline} Nevertheless, [managing the oil market is the main
attraction of this formal pact. If completed, it would mark the endpoint
of a dramatic change that got underway a little over two years
ago]{.underline}. OPEC, which has been a critical fixture of the oil
market for several decades, is giving way to a new entity. But
[OPEC]{.underline}, whose members were not always cordial but worked to
at least put forth some semblance of cooperation, [has ceased to be a
body in which each of its members is an active participant
in]{.underline}, and has influence over, official oil policy for the
entire cartel. There have always been certain power dynamics; [Saudi
Arabia has always been the most powerful member]{.underline}. But with
[Iran hobbled by sanctions, and more than a few others dealing with
instability and declining output, it is really Riyadh that calls all of
the shots.]{.underline} Riyadh and Moscow, that is. Saudi Arabia's
partnership with Russia has already supplanted OPEC as the main venue
where oil policy is made. Look no further than the past few OPEC
meetings, where the world watched the awkward scene in Vienna in which
no decisions could be made [until the Russian energy minister
arrived](https://oilprice.com/Energy/Oil-Prices/Oil-Prices-Crash-As-OPEC-Scrambles-At-11th-Hour.html).
Thus, [it makes sense to formalize an arrangement that has already
become the de facto decision-making architecture. The WSJ reports that
the proposal will be discussed by OPEC+ later this month]{.underline} in
Vienna, and could make a final decision by April[.]{.underline} [The
problem is that the same hiccups that tripped up negotiations last year
remain. Russia has reservations about truly cutting its oil production
by significant volumes]{.underline}. Russia, unlike Saudi Arabia, has
multiple oil companies that are opposed to curtailing output. Also,
[much of the rest of OPEC aside from Saudi Arabia opposes the proposal
because it could lead to a domineering alliance between Riyadh and
Moscow]{.underline}. In fact, [the proposal from last year would have
granted relatively more power to the larger producers -- Saudi Arabia
and Russia -- ending the long-established decision-making process via
consensus]{.underline}. The rest of OPEC panned the proposal. Yet
another hurdle to fully establishing an official OPEC+ alliance is the
brewing antipathy towards the cartel in Washington. The [U.S. Congress
has threatened to push anti-trust regulation that would allow the
Justice Department to take action against OPEC]{.underline} countries
for colluding to manipulate the oil market. T[he so-called "NOPEC"
legislation has been considered at times in the past, but ultimately has
been shelved because multiple presidents from both political parties
opposed the move, mostly due to fear of damaging the U.S.-Saudi
alliance.]{.underline} NOPEC legislation received renewed attention
because President Trump is a bit more unpredictable and has lambasted
OPEC for engineering price spikes. The murder of Saudi journalist Jamal
Khashoggi also fueled momentum for the NOPEC legislation. Now, with the
Democrats in power in the House of Representatives, there is yet another
push for the bill. The House Judiciary Committee is set to
[[vote]{.underline}](https://www.eenews.net/eenewspm/2019/02/05/stories/1060119709)
on the bill on Thursday, and there is a degree of bipartisan support for
it. The OPEC+ alliance was scrapped late last year precisely because the
parties involved feared punitive action from the U.S. Justice
Department. NOPEC legislation could conceivably pass into law this year.
[Saudi Arabia and Russia want to formalize the OPEC+ partnership, but
Washington could yet spoil those plans.]{.underline}

### Russia Bad -- Prolif 

#### Russian expansion sparks nuclear arms race

[The danger of a Middle Eastern nuclear arms race in the near future is
casting a shadow over the long-term future of a region that already has
its fair share of security problems.]{.underline} While such a race has
yet to break out, former Israeli [security officials]{.underline} have
told JNS that several Sunni states in the region [are watching Shi'ite
Iran's nuclear project with concern and could in future set up their own
nuclear programs to counter the threat of a "Shi'ite bomb." Recent
reports]{.underline} [about]{.underline} an alleged [new Saudi
ballistic-missile base have served as a reminder of a vow
by]{.underline} Crown Prince [M]{.underline}ohammed [b]{.underline}in
[S]{.underline}alman, [who warned in 2018 that if Iran acquires nuclear
weapons, Saudi Arabia would follow suit.]{.underline} For now, a number
of [Sunni states are creating civilian nuclear-energy
programs]{.underline}. But such [programs could in the future act as
"shortcuts to military projects,"]{.underline} said Shaul Shay, a former
deputy head of the National Security Council of Israel. "[Russia is the
main supply source for the technology and the building of cores, as part
of its economic and strategic interest,"]{.underline} he said. [A key to
avoiding the outbreak of runaway nuclear proliferation in the Middle
East is to stop Iran]{.underline}'s atomic ambitions, he argued. "Israel
must activate its influence to curb the Iranian nuclear project, in
cooperation with the U.S. and Arab states," Shay stated. "There also
needs to be tight supervision of the civilian projects in Arab states,"
he added. The international community, for its part, must plays its role
in restraining Tehran's nuclear program, Shaul said, noting that "[there
are states like Saudi Arabia that declare that if Iran will have nuclear
weapons, it, too, will obtain this capability."]{.underline} Ultimately,
he said, Israel has a "limited ability to influence the situation, and
most of the burden is on the U.S., which must lead the processes." In a
report published by Shay in February 2018 for the Institute for Policy
and Strategy at the Herzliya Interdisciplinary Center, he wrote that
countries in the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) "have legitimate
reasons to develop nuclear energy programs, but the nuclear initiative
among the MENA countries can be also viewed as a response to the Iranian
nuclear program in the context of their strategic competition with
Iran." Shay warned that "the Middle East is in the process of going
nuclear ... several countries including Egypt, Jordan, Saudi Arabia and
UAE have announced plans to build nuclear power plants and over the next
decade." "Iran's program has already triggered a number of civilian
nuclear programs in other Sunni Arab countries," he stated. 'A strategic
nightmare, but not the end of humanity' Chuck Freilich, a former deputy
Israeli national security adviser and author of Israeli National
Security: A New Strategy for an Era of Change, told JNS that prospects
of a multilateral nuclear Middle East do not form "an immediate threat."
"The Iranians, who are more advanced and sophisticated, certainly in
nuclear scientific studies, have been working on this for 30 years and
still don't have nuclear weapons. Israel has prevented it. The other
candidates---the Saudis, Egyptians and Turks---are 10, 20, perhaps 30
years away from reaching a capability. Maybe only the Saudis can do it
faster, if they buy turnkey technology from Pakistan. But it is not
simple," explained Freilich. While not immediate, prospects of a nuclear
arms race in the Middle East would be a "strategic nightmare" if they
materialized, he cautioned. "These are not the capabilities that the
Soviets and the U.S. had; it would not be the end of humanity. But the
chances that someone might use these weapons in the Middle East are much
higher," Freilich argued. The kind of deterrence and de-escalation paths
that were available to Washington and Moscow during the Cold War, or
"even to India and Pakistan," are not present in the Middle East, warned
Freilich. "Here, at least one state is calling for the destruction of
others. The Americans, Soviets, Indians or Pakistanis never had that
objective," he noted. "The Americans wanted to end communism; the
Soviets wanted to topple capitalist democracy. No one wanted to destroy
the other." The Shi'ite theocratic regime in Tehran is "a very rational
player, \[but\] its rationality is different from others. Its
willingness to take risks is higher." Freilich said "[the Saudis
disconnected diplomatic relations with the Iranians. The Egyptians and
the Iranians have not had links for decades. How do you manage a nuclear
crisis without communications, and when you have seconds or minutes to
act?"]{.underline} And he echoed Shaul's call that the key to avoiding a
nuclear arms race rests, first and foremost, with stopping Iran from
going nuclear. At the same time, if Iran did end up going nuclear,
[there would be "no real solution" to a Middle East with multiple
nuclear states]{.underline}, Freilich said. Israel ending its nuclear
ambiguity would not have a major effect, he assessed, since all regional
actors already assume that Israel is a nuclear state. Freilich said he
wouldn't be surprised if the [Syrians are trying to renew their nuclear
program under the regime of Syrian President Bashar Assad.]{.underline}
Israel destroyed the nuclear-weapons production site in eastern Syria in
a 2007 airstrike. In his report, Shaul noted that in 2017, Egypt and
Russia's Rosatom energy cooperation signed a document to launch an
Egyptian nuclear power plant west of Alexandria. Saudi Arabia announced
in 2011 that it planned to build 16 nuclear-power reactors by 2030 at a
cost of \$100 billion, which would generate around 20 percent of the
country's electricity needs. Jordan, which currently imports more than
95 percent of its energy needs, plans to create nuclear power to
generate 30 percent of its electricity needs by 2030. South Korean
constructors built the Kingdom's first nuclear reactor in 2013. The UAE
has built the first nuclear power plant in the Arab world. A further
three South Korean-designed reactors are under construction.

[Do Iran's Russian-made arms pose a major security threat? They could,
experts predict. **"Sales of advanced military equipment to Iran by
Russia and others has been an issue of intense interest to U.S.
policymakers for some time,"**]{.underline} writes Richard F. Grimmett,
author of the CRS report. "[Iran appears to be interested in air-defense
systems, which would pose a challenge to U.S. combat strikes in
Iran,"]{.underline} Boese says. Not all experts agree. \"It's been a lot
more smoke than fire," says Eisenstadt. "In terms of Iranian air
defenses, \[the Iranians are\] still pretty weak given the size of the
land mass they have to defend[." Does Iran funnel arms from Russia to
terrorist groups? It's unclear. During its month-long war with Hezbollah
last summer, Israel found Russian-made anti-tank weapons, including
RPG-29s, which proved highly effective against Israel's Merkava
tanks.]{.underline} "It was largely the transfer of Iran's military
technology and its asymmetric capabilities to Hezbollah that made it
difficult for the high-tech-oriented Israeli military to 'eradicate' the
fighting capabilities of that organization during the thirty-four-day
war in July-August," writes Ehsan Ahrari, CEO of Strategic Paradigms, a
Virgina-based defense consultancy, in the Asia Times. Most experts,
however, say these rocket-propelled grenades were likely transferred to
Hezbollah by Syria, not Iran. "[It is very difficult for those of us
looking from the outside to say with any certainty that Iran bought
weapons from Russia and sold them to Hezbollah]{.underline}," says
Matthew Schroeder, manager of the Federation of American Scientists'
Arms Sales Monitoring Project. [Part of the problem]{.underline}, he
says[, is that much of Russia's weaponry is widely proliferated, meaning
that dozens of countries have imported it, and a number of them have
produced their own variants, with and without Russia's consent. End-user
agreements typically prohibit states from transferring arms to third
parties]{.underline}; moreover, states are prohibited from funneling
arms to Hezbollah by UN Security Council Resolution 1559, passed in
2004. Interestingly, experts point out that a major weakness in
Hezbollah's capabilities demonstrated last summer was the group's lack
of sophisticated air-defense missiles.

ABU DHABI---[**Russia and China are stepping up their efforts to woo
Persian Gulf arms buyers**, encroaching on a market long dominated by
the U.S. and Europe and raising security concerns in Washington. The
market is crucial for the global defense industry, with Saudi Arabia's
\$7.7 billion in 2018 deals making it the Mideast's top arms buyer, and
the United Arab Emirates and Qatar also in the world\'s top 10,
according to market-research firm IHS Markit. Saudi Arabia and the
U.A.E. spent \$40 million each on Chinese arms in 2018, according to the
Stockholm International Peace Research Institute, a nonprofit that
tracks global arms deals.]{.underline} That is still a small amount, but
a big jump over previous years. The U.A.E. also plans to develop weapons
with a Chinese company. Russia has sold missile systems to the U.A.E.
and military rifles to Saudi Arabia in return for the right to produce
the weapons in the kingdom. Saudi Arabia and the U.A.E. have also bought
Chinese military drones. [China and Russia are willing to sell arms and
equipment, such as drones, to some Mideast countries when other
countries are reluctant to do so because of weapons-proliferation
concerns, or, in the case of the U.S., a policy of giving its ally
Israel a military edge. The arms competition reflects growing tensions
between the U.S. and its strategic rivals China and Russia over trade,
security and other matters in a region the U.S. has long considered its
sphere of influence.]{.underline} The U.S. Department of Defense isn't
only concerned about the threat to U.S. arms sales but also that China
and Russia are trying to gain know-how about advanced military equipment
and commercial technologies by working with U.S. allies, Pentagon
officials said. These officials say the shift complicates future deals
with Washington's Persian Gulf allies since the competing hardware may
be incompatible with Western systems. [Russia and China have been laying
down both military and economic roots in the region. In the past couple
of years, China set up a military base in the East African nation of
Djibouti, across the Gulf of Aden from Yemen, in proximity to a U.S.
facility the Pentagon uses for sensitive military operations, including
drone strikes and special operations missions. Beijing has also pressed
for closer economic ties, hosting Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman
in February and announcing a flurry of agreements ranging across energy,
investment and counterterrorism.]{.underline} Last year Chinese
President Xi Jinping visited the U.A.E., signing 13 deals. "In terms of
technology \[the Chinese\] are incredibly good, and they have more
financial strength" than many rivals, said Alessandro Profumo, chief
executive of Italian aerospace and defense equipment maker Leonardo SpA,
which has sold combat aircraft and military helicopters in the Middle
East. Such strength allows China to offer flexible payment terms for its
customers, helping it to clinch deals particularly in less wealthy
countries. [Russia, the world's second-biggest arms exporter after the
U.S., has made its own push for influence in the Middle East following
its military action in Syria since 2015 to keep President Bashar
al-Assad in power. Russian oil companies like PAO Rosneft have struck
deals from Iraq to Libya, while Kremlin-connected firms have pushed for
Syrian reconstruction business.]{.underline} The Trump administration
has made arms sales to Persian Gulf allies, particularly Saudi Arabia, a
centerpiece of its foreign policy. President Trump has resisted U.S.
senators' calls to restrict arms transfers to Saudi Arabia following the
killing of journalist Jamal Khashoggi, which the Central Intelligence
Agency said was likely ordered by Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin
Salman. Saudi Arabia denies that. U.S. officials say they believe
American technology gives its contractors an edge in the region. They
have warned their Middle East allies not to become too enamored with the
Chinese and Russian partnerships, saying it could threaten cooperation
with the U.S. military, industry officials said. The pressure has had
mixed results. [Washington failed to persuade Turkey to abandon the
purchase of Russia's S-400 air- and missile-defense system. Its
manufacturer, Rostec State Corp., says it can shoot down aircraft at a
range of up to 240 miles. Saudi Arabia has held talks with Russia over
buying the system, too.]{.underline} Sergey Chemezov, Rostec's chief
executive, recently told reporters he wouldn't discuss the status of
those talks because of the pressure Washington has placed on prospective
buyers of Russia equipment. Representatives for Saudi Arabia didn't
respond to requests for comment. Mr. Chemezov said Rostec is in talks
with the U.A.E. about the company's new warship-based antiaircraft
system. China North Industries Group Corp., known as Norinco, meanwhile,
announced plans in February to join forces with U.A.E. defense company
International Golden Group PJSC to set up a research joint venture.
Financial terms of the deal weren't disclosed. Under the pact, the two
partners will open a facility in Abu Dhabi staffed by Chinese and
Emirati engineers. The program will develop weapons and training with
the help of Chinese and Emirati universities and in cooperation with the
U.A.E. armed forces. The center's first project will focus on drones
that can be used for both surveillance but also offensive purposes, an
Emirati official said.

#### Alliances with Saudi Arabia are Key to Deter Terrorism in the Middle East

**Byman 2016,** - \[Daniel Byman is a senior fellow in the Center for
Middle East Policy at Brookings, where his research focuses on
counterterrorism and Middle East security, and a Georgetown University
Professor; "Saudi Arabia and terrorism today;" 9/29/16;
https://www.brookings.edu/blog/markaz/2016/09/29/saudi-arabia-and-terrorism-today/\]

Congress' override of President Obama's veto to allow Americans to sue
Saudi Arabia for links to the 9/11 plot raises many questions, not least
of which is the relationship between Saudi Arabia and terrorist groups
today. As I testified earlier this year, **[Saudi Arabia has made
considerable progress on counterterrorism in the last 15
years]{.underline}** but still has a long way to go. Before the
September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks, and really until al-Qaida began to
attack the Kingdom directly in May 2003, Saudi Arabia was often
uncooperative on counterterrorism and more part of the problem than part
of the solution. Since 2003**[, the Saudi regime has emerged as a vital
counterterrorism partner, and several important successes against
al-Qaida in particular are due in large part to Saudi
cooperation.]{.underline}** Yet it's not a simple story of progress: the
Kingdom engages in many troubling behaviors today that make the
terrorism problem worse. In the end, **[policymakers would do well to
remember that Saudi Arabia is a key partner]{.underline}** but not a
friend: **[the United States and Saudi Arabia share many common
interests,]{.underline}** but they do not share common values or a
common worldview. Understanding Saudi Arabia's relationship with
terrorists, however, is far more difficult than assessing Iran's backing
of terrorism, which is open, extensive, and state-sponsored. Much of
Saudi support is done by non-state actors. Yet being "non-state" does
not absolve the Saudi government of responsibility. These non-state
actors enjoy a range of relationships to the Saudi regime. Some receive
or did receive official patronage. Others, particularly those tied to
leading clerics in the Kingdom, are embraced indirectly by the regime's
self-proclaimed role as Defender of the Faithful. And still others are
truly private, acting independently of the government and in times in
opposition to it. In addition, the Saudi royal family itself occupies an
unusual role. In one sense, the royal family---with its tens of
thousands of princes---is not the government. However, the family's and
the government's finances are interwoven, and if a prince supports a
group it has an unofficial imprimatur of approval. King Salman himself,
for example, helped raise money for the mujahedin in Afghanistan and the
Balkans. Many of these voices are responsible for indoctrination rather
than direct violence. That is to say they might propagate views on the
Satanic nature of Jews, the apostasy of Shiites, or the heretical nature
of the Ahmadiyyas, as well as the legitimacy of using violence to fight
foreign occupiers of Muslim lands---be it Indian forces in Kashmir, U.S.
forces in Iraq, or Israeli forces in historic Palestine. Such support,
in the United States, would often be considered distasteful but part of
protected free speech. For terrorists, however, it can prove invaluable
as it provides theological legitimacy for their actions, enabling them
to attract recruits and funds. **[Washington's ability to influence the
Kingdom is limited, however, given the Saudi domestic sensitivities of
these issues. U.S. pressure under the Bush and Obama administrations has
moved Saudi Arabia away from many dangerous activities and has helped
transform Saudi capacity in fighting terrorism.]{.underline}** Even if
the key motivation was the change in the perceived threat to the Kingdom
itself rather than U.S. influence, these are considerable successes that
deserve recognition. Changing Saudi policy still further is difficult.
Although the United States has sold the Kingdom almost \$100 billion in
arms during the Obama administration, the Saudi media remains critical
of the president as unreliable and hostile to the Kingdom. Riyadh,
moreover, is frustrated with U.S. policy regarding Iran in particular,
but also in the region in general. Saudi Arabia backed the coup in
Egypt, in opposition to U.S. policy, and Saudi leaders were previously
outraged that the United States abandoned the Mubarak regime. The Obama
administration has largely abandoned criticizing the Saudi regime on
human rights grounds, but it is important to remember that most Saudis
do not share U.S. values regarding women's and homosexual rights,
religious liberty, and other basic freedoms that are fundamental to
American society. Many issues regarding counterterrorism---particularly
the promotion of extremism abroad via sectarianism and criticism of
non-Muslims---touch on core domestic political issues vital to the
regime's legitimacy and very survival. **[Change in these areas will at
best be slow, and the United States should expect progress to end or
even reverse should the regime's domestic situation face
challenges.]{.underline}** Quiet pressure is almost always best when
trying to change Saudi policy. The small circle of decisionmakers in
Saudi Arabia does not take well to public embarrassment, and they
believe strongly in the value of close personal relationships. To be
effective, U.S. pressure must involve top officials, including the
president. Otherwise, it will simply be ignored or may even prove
counterproductive**[. Saudi Arabia is a vital partner in the struggle to
defeat the Islamic State, al-Qaida, and other groups.]{.underline}** But
it is not a friend. **[Demonizing Saudi Arabia does not help advance
U.S. interests,]{.underline}** but nor should critics of U.S. policy in
the region see Washington and Riyadh as fully aligned given the profound
difference in values.

#### Alliance with Saudi Arabia is helping stop terrorism in the region

**Jenkins**, Brian Michael, **2016**, (M.A. in history, University of
California, Los Angeles; B.A. in fine arts, University of California,
Los Angeles) A Saudi-Led Military Alliance to Fight Terrorism Could
Benefit U.S. Interests, No Publication,
https://www.rand.org/pubs/perspectives/PE189.html, 7-27-2019, updog

Saudi Arabia recently announced that it was creating a "military
alliance" of 34 Muslim-majority nations to fight terrorism.1 A Saudi-led
military alliance could change the shape of the conflicts in Syria and
Iraq, but what does it mean? Is it real? Can it work? And is it a good
idea for the United States to embrace and encourage, or should the
United States stay well clear of it? The December 15, 2015, announcement
used only the word "terrorism" to identify the threat, but at the
accompanying press conference, Saudi Deputy Crown Prince and Defense
Minister Mohammad bin Salman was more explicit. [The coalition, he said,
was aimed at the disease of Islamic extremism, specifically that
exemplified by Daesh (the defense minister used the Arabic acronym for
the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant---ISIL or ISIS) and its
affiliates in the Middle East and beyond.]{.underline}2 [Saudi Arabia is
a long-standing ally of the United States, although circumstances in
both countries require that the relationship always remain discreet. The
United States has defended Saudi Arabia, as it did when the kingdom was
threatened by the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait.]{.underline} It was the
Saudi monarchy's decision to invite U.S. forces into Saudi Arabia that
infuriated Osama bin Laden and led to his later terrorist campaign
against the Saudi rulers. The United States has supported Saudi military
actions against rebels in Yemen, although with growing misgivings. The
United States would probably defend Saudi Arabia if the kingdom were
openly invaded by Iran. The Saudis assist U.S. counterterrorist efforts
in a variety of ways and currently participate, albeit minimally, in the
U.S.-led air campaign against ISIL. Saudi Arabia also helps finance U.S.
programs to train and arm Syrian rebels.3 [The United States would
prefer that Saudi Arabia be more committed to defeating the Islamic
extremists represented by al Qaeda and ISIL and would welcome Saudi
Arabia stepping up its efforts against terrorism.]{.underline} If it
became a real military force, a Saudiled alliance could fundamentally
alter the dynamics of the current conflict with ISIL. But few in either
the West or the Arab world believe that the Saudis can deliver.
Historically, it has proved difficult to assemble any Arab or Muslim
coalition. The alliance seems too unwieldy, its mission too unfocused.
The reactions in the West, however, go beyond skeptical assessments of
the prospects of implementation of a "military alliance." [The very
concept of a Saudi-led coalition against violent extremism has been met
with aversion in many quarters]{.underline}. Some American critics
consider Saudi Arabia aggressive and determined to impose its own
intolerant brand of Islamic law on the rest of the world. Some
detractors see in Saudi Arabia the ideological and financial roots of
the terrorists that most threaten U.S. security. For others, the
kingdom's record of internal repression makes it an unsuitable ally.
These critics point to Saudi Arabia's single-day beheading of 47 men
condemned as terrorists in January 2016, including prominent Shia cleric
Nimr al-Nimr, as a demonstration of just how far the kingdom diverges
from American values. While Saudi-American cooperation can sometimes be
difficult to defend, recent Saudi actions and the current political
atmosphere in the United States have made it even more difficult for the
U.S. government to publicly support Saudi initiatives right now.

Outside the obvious Saudi dependency on the United States to come to its
defense in the highly unlikely scenario of a direct attack by Iran,
counterterrorism collaboration is a double edged sword. [The kingdom is
much more vulnerable to terrorist attacks than the United
States]{.underline}, being in the neighborhood where al Qaeda has long
operated and where ISIS now remains, not only in Syria and Iraq, but
more importantly next door in Yemen. [All this to say that raising the
specter of a cut-off of economic, military, and security cooperation by
Saudi Arabia is bogus. It would be the equivalent of the proverbial
cutting off one's nose to spite one's face. Saudi Arabia is much more
dependent on the United States than the other way around. In weighting
how much pressure to apply to affect Saudi behavior in the region, the
Trump administration should not be overly concerned with losing
significant equities, as has been repeatedly implied by Trump and by
other administration officials]{.underline}.

### Alliance Key -- ISIS

#### US-Saudi coop key to counter ISIS

**Mitchell 2017** -- \[Ellen Mitchell is a defense reporter for the
Hill; "Saudi Arabia offers to contribute troops to ISIS fight;" 3/16/17;
https://thehill.com/policy/defense/324391-saudi-arabia-offers-to-contribute-troops-to-isis-fight\]

A top Saudi Arabia official said the country is considering contributing
to the ISIS fight in Syria, following a Pentagon meeting with national
security leaders**[. Saudi Arabia\'s deputy crown prince]{.underline}**
and minister of Defense, Mohammed bin Salman**[, told reporters Thursday
his country would consider sending ground troops to fight inside
Syria]{.underline}**. Bin Salman made the remarks following a meeting
with Defense Secretary James Mattis and other national security leaders.
**[\"We are ready to do anything that will eradicate terrorism, anything
without limits,]{.underline}**\" he said following a reporter's
question. Saudi Arabia has regularly offered to send troops to Syria
since at least 2016, although some experts have worried that a Saudi
effort in Syria could make the fight into more of a proxy battle with
regional rival Iran, which backs Syrian President Bashar al-Assad\'s
government. It\'s also not clear how effective the Saudi military, which
is already involved in a war with Iranian-tied rebels in Yemen, would be
against the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria (ISIS). During an opening
statement**[, bin Salman also said Saudi Arabia must work and cooperate
with its allies, including the U.S., as it faces extremists and
terrorists in the region. \"We in Saudi Arabia are on the front line in
facing these challenges,]{.underline}**" he said, adding that **[the
country is "very optimistic under the leadership of President Trump, and
we believe these challenges will be easy to tackle under the leadership
of the president.]{.underline}**\" The United States recently deployed
400 Marines and Army Rangers on the ground in Syria to help prepare
ahead of the fight to retake the city of Raqqa from ISIS. There are also
approximately 500 U.S. special operators already in Syria to train,
advise and assist local forces. The new troops are considered a
temporary deployment and are not being counted against the 500-troop cap
set by the Obama administration that has yet to be changed by the Trump
administration. Rep. Barbara Lee (D-Calif.) last week introduced a bill
to block additional U.S. forces from being sent to Syria. Her bill has
15 Democratic co-sponsors and one Republican, Rep. Walter Jones (N.C.).
The administration is also considering deploying as many as 1,000
American soldiers to Kuwait as a \"reserve\" force to support the U.S.
offensive against ISIS in Syria and Iraq, according to a Reuters report
last week.

### Alliance Key -- Terror Financing 

#### The Saudi and American alliance is key to countering terror cash flows

**Arab News 18**

(Arab News, 9-20-2018, \"US highlights Saudi Arabia's key role in global
fight against terrorism,\"
<http://www.arabnews.com/node/1374946/saudi-arabia>; accessed 7/27/19)

The US State Department has praised Saudi Arabia for its efforts to
combat terrorism, describing the Kingdom as an active and key member in
the global coalition to defeat Daesh. "[Saudi Arabia has continued to
maintain a strong anti-terrorism relationship with the United States and
has supported the strengthening of bilateral cooperation between the two
countries]{.underline}," the State Department noted in its annual report
on the global state of terrorism. [It also highlighted the joint
strategic vision between the two countries and a number of new
initiatives to counter terrorist messages and disrupt the financing of
terrorism launched last year during US president Donald-Trump's visit to
the Kingdom]{.underline}. The report said Saudi Arabia has implemented
systems to follow UN Security Council sanctions on groups and
individuals linked to Daesh and Al Qaeda, and has expanded existing
counterterrorism programs and projects to rehabilitate terrorist
fighters who leave extremist groups. [It has also adopted laws to
counter the financing of terrorist groups. The State Department pointed
out that the Kingdom has achieved a high level of accuracy in its
counterterrorism operations, and has carried out a number of arrests and
disrupted active terrorist cells throughout the country]{.underline}.
[The report referred to terrorist plans that were thwarted in the
Kingdom, noting the efforts being made in legislation, law enforcement
and border security, as well as the country's positive contribution as a
member of the Financial Action Task Force for the Middle East and North
Africa]{.underline}, a regional body that [imposes financial sanctions
on individuals and groups that help to fund terrorism. \"The Kingdom has
maintained strict control over the banking sector and tightened
sanctions on the financing of terrorism,\" the report said]{.underline}.
It also pointed out that the Kingdom provided 100 million euros (\$117
million) to fight terrorism in the Sahel countries in Africa, as the
Kingdom is a founding member of the Global Counter-Terrorism Forum.

### Arms Sales Key -- General

#### Saudi Arabia counterterrorism efforts rely on US arms support

Kathy **Gilsinan**, 10-16-20**18**, (Kathy Gilsinan is a staff writer at
The Atlantic, covering national security and global affairs. She was
previously an editor at World Politics Review.) Why the U.S. Can't Quit

https://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2018/10/jamal-khashoggi-american-saudi-counterterrorism-relationship/573148/,
7-27-2019, updog

At stake is the nature of a 75-year-old relationship, launched under
President Franklin D. Roosevelt, that has spanned presidencies and
kingships and rested on a fundamental bargain: access to oil, and
regional stability, in exchange for security guarantees. [In its modern
incarnation, that means the U.S. gets a stable partner in a roiled
region and cooperation on counterterrorism and countering
Iran.]{.underline} This bargain has long troubled critics of Saudi
Arabia's human-rights record. But now even traditionally sympathetic
lawmakers are turning on the Saudi leadership; Senator Lindsey Graham
directly accused Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman of having Khashoggi
murdered. All of this implicitly raises a question about the U.S.-Saudi
partnership: Is it worth it? "[The relationship has always been founded
on shared interests ... It has never been founded on shared
values]{.underline}. And we have no values in common," said Bruce
Riedel, a 30-year CIA veteran now at Brookings who recently wrote a book
on the history of the U.S.-Saudi relationship. "They're an absolute
monarchy married to a theocracy." The gap in values was glaring even
before Khashoggi disappeared about two weeks ago; Riedel argued it
widened with the crown prince's ascent to power, which has been
accompanied by, among other things, a crackdown on internal dissent and
a humanitarian disaster in Yemen alongside his promises of
modernization. "That and other frictions have made the relationship
quite brittle in the last five years or so," said Riedel. "And the
Khashoggi affair has now put all that fragility into public view in a
very dramatic way." [Yet the shared interests remain powerful, and have
sustained the relationship]{.underline} through numerous crises in the
past---including a 1973 oil embargo during the Arab-Israeli war and the
revelation in the wake of the September 11 attacks that 15 of the 19
hijackers were Saudi. Since then, [the Saudis have positioned themselves
as a key ally in the fight against al-Qaeda and then isis]{.underline}
(albeit too slowly for many officials and analysts), in particular when
terrorists targeted the kingdom itself. The 9/11 Commission Report noted
in 2004 that "cooperation had already become significant, but after the
bombings in Riyadh in 2003"---in which more than 30 people died when
Islamic militants attacked residential compounds in the city---"it
improved much more. [The Kingdom openly discussed the problem of
radicalism, criticized the terrorists as religiously deviant, reduced
official support for religious activity overseas, and publicized
arrests."]{.underline} The report added that in 2004, the Saudi
ambassador to the United States called for a "jihad" against terrorists.
The period highlighted what the counterterrorism expert Daniel Byman has
called in congressional testimony the "paradox" of U.S.-Saudi
counterterrorism cooperation: "On the one hand, [the Saudi government is
a close partner of the United States on counterterrorism]{.underline}.
On the other hand, Saudi support for an array of preachers and
nongovernment organizations contributes to an overall climate of
radicalization, making it far harder to counter violent extremism." "The
Saudis were undergoing a period of significant domestic threat," said
Frances Townsend, who was assistant to President George W. Bush for
homeland security and counterterrorism from 2004 to 2008. "\[They\]
began to work and develop a much deeper, closer relationship with our
intelligence and law-enforcement communities, including the Treasury
Department. We pushed them very hard on combating financial support for
terrorism. And there were tremendous gains made." By 2006, Saudi Arabia
had largely contained its own terrorism problem---at times using methods
that highlighted the difference between American interests in
counterterrorism and values of rule of law, including arbitrary
detention and torture, as Amnesty International detailed in a 2011
report. The success of day-to-day counterterrorism cooperation between
the United States and the kingdom (which consists, among other things,
of intelligence sharing about threats as well as training, countering
terrorist financing, and Saudi funding for efforts like the counter-isis
campaign in Syria) is difficult to measure, though former
national-security officials from the Bush, Obama, and Trump
administrations told me it was useful. "They gained tremendous
experience and capability," said Townsend. The most notable public
evidence of a payoff was when, as Riedel has detailed, then-Crown Prince
Mohammed bin Nayef tipped off U.S. officials in 2010 that al-Qaeda had
smuggled bombs into printer cartridges on UPS and FedEx planes already
in flight, disrupting the plot. In another high-profile instance, The
Washington Post reported (though the administration has never confirmed)
that the CIA began operating a drone base in Saudi Arabia around 2011 to
target Yemen's al-Qaeda affiliate, al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula;
the newspaper said that the drone mission flown to kill the
American-born radical cleric Anwar al-Awlaki was flown in part from that
base. Yet Obama was famously skeptical of what the Saudis brought to the
table---at one point before becoming president labeling the Saudis
"so-called allies," and as president telling The Atlantic's Jeffrey
Goldberg that Saudi Arabia needed to "share" the region with its
archrival, Iran. But the Trump administration, according to Riedel, made
[Saudi Arabia the cornerstone of its regional strategy.]{.underline} Bob
Woodward recounts in his book Fear that it was Trump's son-in-law and
adviser Jared Kushner who encouraged the president to bet big on the
young crown prince, though this wasn't an unusual affinity in Washington
at the time; Mohammed bin Salman's reformist drive looked promising to
many, and he got approving headlines for his economic vision and his
decision to lift the driving ban on women in the kingdom. "I think all
of us were very optimistic on the president's first trip," said
Christopher Costa, who previously served as senior director for
counterterrorism on Trump's National Security Council and is now the
executive director of the International Spy Museum. ["My focus was
narrowly on counterterrorism, and it was very promising ... I was very
optimistic, but I took a wait-and-see attitude with the
Saudis."]{.underline} As more time passes, it looks more doubtful that
Khashoggi will reappear. Yet at the same time it looks more likely that
the U.S. and Saudi Arabia will avoid a major rupture in their
relationship. But that doesn't mean the Khashoggi affair won't harm the
relationship in subtler ways. Michael Hayden, who served as CIA director
from 2006 to 2009, noted that U.S. intelligence sharing is bound by U.S.
law. "If you think the Saudis are going to put your information to a use
you could never do, you're not allowed to give it to them," he told me.
"If ... you have information on somebody you're interested in, too, but
you have reason to believe if you told the Saudis what his route of
travel was, they'd go kill him---if you didn't have the authority to
kill him, you couldn't tell the Saudis where he was. And so the more
they act in a way that's inconsistent with our policy and law and
approaches, the more our intelligence sharing with them has to be
constrained." [The fundamental bargain, however, remains in place, even
as the relationship has grown more complex. As Riedel has pointed out,
even though the U.S. has reduced its own Saudi oil imports, the global
economy depends on stability in the oil markets that Saudi Arabia, as
one of the world's largest oil producers, could crater on its
own.]{.underline} "If Saudi oil exports came off the markets, the global
economy would collapse," Riedel said. "This is not the relationship of
the '70s and '80s, where it was really all about oil," Townsend said.
It's much deeper and more complicated than that. But the Khashoggi
incident is an inflection point, she said. "It is so shocking to our
sensibilities that there's a recognition we can't treat human rights
generally as an entirely separate issue. It has to be a considered part
of the entire portfolio. I think the lesson here is, when it is not
treated as a considered part of the portfolio of issues in a bilateral
relationship, it may not get due weight and reference that it deserves."

### Terrorism Bad -- Laundry List

#### Laundry list of impacts to Middle East terror -- oil prices, econ collapse, and regional spill over 

**Moeller 2016** -- \[Hans Mathias Moeller is a contributor at Global
Risk Insight; "Assessing the impact of Saudi Arabia's suicide bombings;"
7/17/16;
https://globalriskinsights.com/2016/07/impact-saudi-arabia-suicide-bombings/\]

On July 4th, **[three suicide attacks occurred across Saudi Arabia,
including one in Medina near the Prophet's Mohammad's Mosque, one failed
attack in the vicinity of the U.S. Consulate in Jeddah, and another
failed attack at a Shiite mosque in Qatif in the Eastern
Province]{.underline}**. No group has claimed responsibility for the
attacks to date, but stated intentions, objectives, a history of recent
attacks, and the tactics and procedures of the attacks point towards the
Islamic State in Iraq and the Levant (ISIS). How have markets reacted to
the attacks? **[The nearly coordinated suicide attacks in Saudi Arabia
are unusual and should at least in theory have impacted the global
financial markets.]{.underline}** However, no significant impact was
noticed on the global stock market index, and there was no change in
global oil prices. A likely explanation is that the suicide attacks
occurred the week of Eid al-Fitr or the celebration of the end of
Ramadan. Most stock market trading in the Middle East was closed for
days during this week. Another explanation is that the three attacks in
Saudi Arabia, two of which failed, were overshadowed by spectacular
terrorist attacks in Istanbul, Turkey, Bagdad, Iraq, and Dhaka,
Bangladesh that garnered more media attention. **[Previous terrorist
attacks in Saudi Arabia did affect oil prices]{.underline}**.
Commerzbank notes in response to **[the three attacks]{.underline}**
that similar attacks only a few years ago **[would have resulted in oil
prices rising sharply]{.underline}**. The global oil markets now appear
to have accepted that ISIS is attacking Saudi Arabia without it
impacting oil prices. How might the bombings impact Saudi's tourism
industry? The impact of the recent suicide attacks on the tourism sector
will likely be low to insignificant. One-off events such as the attack
near the Medina mosque tend to fade from the public memory over time,
and government incentives and advertisement for the tourist industry
will help preserve Saudi tourism. **[The situation could be very
different if ISIS sustains a campaign against foreigners and soft
targets in the tourism sector such as hotels, shopping malls, airport
terminals, and religious tourist destinations, including Medina and
Mecca.]{.underline}** A sustained terrorist campaign would taint the
image of these locations, as it could significantly undermine Saudi
efforts to expand the tourist sector if tourists opt for safer
destinations. The reality is that, over the past two years, ISIS has
primarily targeted police and security forces across Saudi Arabia as
well as Shiite civilians and religious targets in the Eastern Province.
The Saudi Interior Ministry reported in June 2016 that 26 ISIS-related
terrorist attacks have occurred since the beginning of 2015.
Nonetheless, the attack near the holy site in Medina is unprecedented in
recent history in that Salafi Jihadists in Saudi Arabia have never
attacked such a holy site. **[The attack can be seen as an attempt to
undermine the religious legitimacy decreed by the royal family. Another
possibility is that the attack signifies a target shift to religious
tourist sites.]{.underline}** From the ISIS perspective, such a target
shift would make sense if the strategic objective is to undermine the
Saudi economy and the House of Saud. The Medina attack is timely in that
it occurred approximately two months after Saudi Arabia's Deputy Crown
Prince Mohammed bin Salman revealed a blueprint titled, "Saudi Vision
2030." The blueprint aims to transform the Saudi oil-dependent economy
to a more diversified economy, focused on increasing the number of
religious tourists making the annual pilgrimage to Saudi Arabia. The
blueprint also calls to open doors to tourism from all nationalities.
**[An ISIS campaign against tourist sites and foreigners could deliver
an economic setback for the kingdom, particularly at a time when oil
revenues are dropping.]{.underline}** If the Medina attack is the
beginning of a new ISIS campaign against religious tourist targets in
Saudi Arabia, then terrorist attacks in Medina and Mecca during the time
leading up to the annual pilgrimage in September with up to 2 million
tourists, cannot be ruled out. What challenges remain for Saudi's
security situation? **[The latest strings of terrorist attacks are only
one of many security concerns for Saudi Arabia]{.underline}**. The
kingdom is facing a potential outbreak of sectarian violence between the
Saudi government and Shiite Muslims in its Eastern Province. The Eastern
Province has a strategic economic significance, as it is a vital
industrial hub and home to critical oil infrastructure and gas and oil
fields**[. Economic activity in the Eastern Province accounts for
roughly 60% of Saudi Arabia's GDP. Any form of civil unrest and
intrastate conflict would likely undermine the Saudi economy. It is,
therefore, no coincidence that ISIS has focused many of its attacks on
the Saudi Shiite community and mosques in Qatif and al-Hasa in the
Eastern Province in an attempt to drive a wedge between Shiites and the
government to fuel sectarian violence, which ISIS tried most recently in
Qatif on July 4th]{.underline}**. The stability inside the kingdom is
intertwined with the current security situation in Iraq and the future
of ISIS. Saudi Arabia is bordered by Iraq to the north and is a member
of the U.S. led coalition fighting ISIS. In June 2016, the U.S. State
Department estimated that ISIS had lost 47 percent of the territory
previously controlled in Iraq. If ISIS continues to lose territory and
suffer losses in Iraq and Syria, it could morph itself from a terror
state into a terrorist organization after which foreign fighters would
return home to pursue ISIS's objectives. For example, **[Saudi fighters
could return to Saudi Arabia and target the Saudi royal family and the
Shiite community, which is a stated objective of Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi,
the leader of ISIS]{.underline}**. The Soufan Group estimates that 2,500
Saudis have joined the conflict in Syria and Iraq. **[If Saudi fighters
decide to return to Saudi Arabia, equipped with battlefield experience,
leadership and bomb-making skills, the number of terrorist attacks could
increase along with the level of sophistication of the
attacks.]{.underline}** **[Saudi Arabia is also facing spillover
violence from the civil war in Yemen, which lies along its southern
border.]{.underline}** On July 4th, Saudi air defense intercepted a
ballistic missile fired over its southern border by Houthi Shiite rebels
towards the southern city of Abha. The Houthi Shiite rebels, a Zyadi
Shia movement, overthrew the former Yemeni government in September

#### Saudi counter terror efforts work -- but only with US arms sales 

**Byman 2016** -- \[Daniel Byman is a senior fellow in the Center for
Middle East Policy at Brookings, where his research focuses on
counterterrorism and Middle East security, and a Georgetown University
Professor; "The U.S.-Saudi Arabia counterterrorism relationship;"
5/24/16;
https://www.brookings.edu/testimonies/the-u-s-saudi-arabia-counterterrorism-relationship/\]

Much changed **[in 2003]{.underline}**, when Al Qaeda began to attack
the Kingdom directly, targeting expatriates there and also security
forces. This led to a sustained terrorism campaign that claimed over a
hundred lives and hundreds more injured between 2003 and 2006.\[8\]
**[The current Crown Prince led the campaign against Al Qaeda,
ultimately devastating its organization in the Kingdom]{.underline}**.
As a result of these attacks**[, the Kingdom embraced intelligence
cooperation with the United States and began to see Al Qaeda as a deadly
threat. Writing in 2004, the 9/11 Commission declared, "The Kingdom of
Saudi Arabia is now locked in mortal combat with al
Qaeda."\[9\]]{.underline}** Indicative of this change, **[in 2008 the
United States and Saudi Arabia signed a bilateral agreement on technical
counterterrorism cooperation]{.underline}**. Under the agreement, **[the
U]{.underline}**nited **[S]{.underline}**tates **[provides
advisors]{.underline}**, funded by Saudi Arabia**[, to assist on
security measures. The U.S. military also assists in training Saudi
forces.\[10\] Saudi officials are now vital counterterrorism allies.
They are playing a leading role in trying to stop funding to the Islamic
State and the Al Qaeda core]{.underline}**.\[11\] The shift in the Saudi
approach and the importance of Saudi Arabia's role in counterterrorism
can be seen in several successes against Al Qaeda's affiliate in Yemen,
Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula (AQAP). One of the more notable
examples of **[Saudi Arabia's increasingly important role in combatting
terrorism was the foiled 2010 AQAP cargo plane bomb plot]{.underline}**.
According to a story in the New York Times, Saudi intelligence provided
the critical tipoff to the American and European intelligence officials
that allowed British and Emirati security personnel to intercept the
expertly concealed bombs that were already en route to the United
States.\[12\] The last minute intelligence was the product of
long-running Saudi intelligence operations to infiltrate AQAP.\[13\] The
Saudi connection was probably decisive as the concealed explosives had
already cleared multiple security screenings before the timely Saudi
warning initiated the successful multilateral worldwide search.\[14\] In
addition to these human intelligence capabilities within jihadist
circles (not easily matched by Western intelligence), **[Saudi Arabia
also plays a central role in the U.S. campaign against AQAP in Yemen by
hosting a base for drone and other attacks in Yemen according to the
BBC.\[15\]]{.underline}** The Islamic State, like Al Qaeda, is also
considered a top security threat by the Saudi regime. The Islamic State
has declared Saudi Arabia to be its enemy, and its propaganda shows its
black flag flying above Mecca. Islamic State terrorists have attacked
Shi'a Muslim mosques in the Kingdom and Saudi security officials. The
Islamic State also called on Saudi subjects to assassinate senior Saudi
leaders. More broadly, the Islamic State threatens the regime's
legitimacy, claiming that it -- rather than the Kingdom -- is the true
embodiment of a state under God's law. It has called the royal family
"slaves of the Crusaders and allies of the Jews" and derided them for
abandoning Muslims around the world.\[16\] The Saudi government response
to the Islamic State has been strong. The government has taken steps to
stop Saudis from travelling abroad to support the Islamic State and
other groups, including the arrest of those who traveled abroad to fight
with radical groups**[. In addition, it has arrested more than 1,600
suspected Islamic State supporters in the Kingdom and reportedly foiled
several attacks.]{.underline}**\[17\] **[U.S. Treasury officials have
declared the Saudis see "eye to eye" with the United States in stopping
Islamic State fundraising, and the Kingdom has stepped up its monitoring
of social media.\[]{.underline}**18\] Senior religious officials with
close ties to the royal family have also denounced the Islamic State
(and Al Qaeda).\[19\] The Kingdom announced it was forming an "Islamic"
military alliance, headquartered in Saudi Arabia, to fight terrorism.
**[The Kingdom has grown far more effective in stopping terrorist
financing]{.underline}**. Al Qaeda long drew on financial supporters in
the Kingdom, and the Saudi government's capacity for stopping this was
initially poor even after it began to go after the problem
seriously.\[20\] (Part of the problem was that the Kingdom did not have
an elaborate taxation system, so the government lacked knowledge of how
much money its citizens had or how they spent it). **[The Kingdom
invested heavily in fighting terrorist financing with considerable U.S.
help]{.underline}**. As a result, it is far harder to send money to
terrorist groups from Saudi Arabia. In 2014, money going to fighters in
Syria was often channeled via Kuwait to avoid Saudi
countermeasures.\[21\] Despite these more aggressive measures and
considerable progress, financial support for Sunni extremist groups from
Saudis remains a significant problem.\[22\] Groups in Pakistan and
elsewhere often benefit from the support of wealthy Saudis, and it is
not clear how hard the Saudi government is trying to stop these flows.
Saudi Arabia also has initiated a terrorist rehabilitation program. This
well-funded program gives terrorists a chance to reintegrate into Saudi
society. Religious leaders are involved to dissuade participants from
radical views. Participants also receive a job and family support. Some
of those who have gone through the program, however, have returned to
extremism, including several important members of AQAP.\[23\]
Considerable problems remain. As former senior CIA official Bruce Riedel
contends, "Saudi sources remain major funders of groups like the Afghan
Taliban and Lashkar­e Taiba in Pakistan. Some accounts suggest Saudi
money has gone to al­Qaida's affiliate in Syria, the al­Nusra
Front."\[24\] Although Riyadh opposes the Islamic State, it sees the
Syrian regime, with its close ties to Iran, as a far greater danger and
has focused its energies accordingly. Despite greater regime efforts to
reduce the flow of fighters abroad, Saudis still have found it easy to
travel and fight on behalf of the Islamic State -- they are perhaps the
largest source of foreign fighters for the group.\[25\] Perhaps most
important, Saudi Arabia is home to many preachers and religious
organizations that embrace sectarianism and oppose a U.S. role in the
Middle East. A number of prominent Saudi preachers regularly condemn
Shi'a Muslims, thus validating the Islamic State's sectarian campaign
and otherwise increasing its legitimacy. Some also blame the United
States for a host of ills, embracing conspiracy theories such as the
Bush administration being behind the 9/11 attacks. There is relative
progress, however, in that many senior religious leaders do urge Saudis
not to be foreign fighters or otherwise participate in conflicts abroad,
arguing instead that local Muslims or state authorities should be the
ones to respond.\[26\] Saudi Arabia considers Al Qaeda to be a mortal
enemy, yet its military campaign in Yemen has indirectly assisted the
group. By targeting and pushing back the Houthis in Yemen, which Riyadh
considers (largely erroneously) to be a pawn of Tehran, Saudi Arabia has
given breathing space to AQAP, which also is fighting the Houthis.
Recently, however, Saudi-backed forces have focused on AQAP as well as
the Houthis, forcing AQAP to retreat in several areas.\[27\]

**[Those who accuse Saudi Arabia of supporting violent extremism not
only fail to acknowledge the kingdom\'s leadership in combating
terrorism around the world but also do not see that it is illogical and
irrational for Saudi Arabia to be anything less than at the forefront of
nations combatting this scourge]{.underline}**. Multiple
**[actors]{.underline}**---each with their own motives---**[have
targeted the kingdom, seeking to destabilize the country and terrorize
the Saudi people]{.underline}**. So it is in our national interest to
defeat terrorism---and a national priority. Whether non-state actors
like Al-Qaeda or the Islamic State militant group (ISIS), or
state-sponsored extremism from Iran and its proxies, **[Saudi Arabia
has]{.underline}**, as much as any other country, a national security
**[incentive to stop]{.underline}** the men, the money and **[the
mindset that foments terrorism and violent extremism]{.underline}**.
Some try to malign Saudi Arabia by reciting that \"15 of the 19\" 9/11
hijackers were Saudi. They should know that the mastermind of the 9/11
attacks, Khalid Sheikh Mohammed, told U.S. interrogators that the
initial plan was to have 20 hijackers from different nationalities, but
late in the planning Osama bin Laden directed him to use as many Saudis
as possible to give the attack a Saudi face. This was likely designed to
drive a wedge between the kingdom and the U.S. If this was Osama bin
Laden\'s plan, it almost succeeded, as we saw from the wave of criticism
the kingdom experienced after 9/11**[. In 2003, the Saudi capital was
targeted with simultaneous suicide bombings at three residential
compounds.]{.underline}** These bombings killed more than 30 persons,
including Saudis, Lebanese, Americans, British and Australians. Other
attacks followed, seeking to destabilize the kingdom and shake the
confidence of expatriates to cause them to leave. It did not succeed.
Faris al-Zahrani, a top Al-Qaeda strategist whose death sentence was
recently carried out, along with other convicted terrorists,
masterminded a 2004 attack on the U.S. Consulate in Jeddah, killing four
security guards and five staff members**[. The murderers of ISIS have
publicly proclaimed the taking of the Saudi state as one of their
goals.]{.underline}** Throughout 2015, ISIS militants struck four
mosques in Dammam, Qatif, Abha and Najran, killing 38 and wounding 148.
In August 2015, Saudi authorities arrested 421 suspects from four
different extremist cells in connection with these crimes. Another 15
suspects were arrested while planning a suicide operation against the
U.S. Embassy in Riyadh using a truck loaded with explosives. ISIS
operatives in Saudi Arabia have been caught trying to free terrorists
from prison, recruit young people to their cause and spread ISIS
propaganda. Iran has used terrorism as an instrument of its foreign
policy since the 1979 Revolution. Saudi Arabia has long been a target of
terrorism perpetrated by Iranian proxies. In 1987, the Iranian sponsored
Hezbollah al-Hejaz set fire to an oil facility in Ras Tanura in eastern
Saudi Arabia. That same year, Saudi authorities foiled a plot by Iranian
pilgrims to smuggle explosives into the kingdom. In 1988, Hezbollah
al-Hejaz attacked a petrochemical company facility in Jubail. Most
despicable was Iran\'s involvement in the 1996 Khobar bombings, which
resulted in the deaths of 120 people, including 19 Americans. **[Faced
with such diverse and dangerous adversaries, Saudi Arabia has spared no
effort or expense to combat terrorism. The kingdom is committed to
uprooting extremism at the source and draining militant groups of
resources. Saudi Arabia has arrested extremists within its borders,
tried them before specialized courts and imposed the ultimate penalties
on those convicted.]{.underline}** The kingdom has implemented one of
the world\'s strictest financial control systems to combat terrorism
financing. Donations in mosques and public places are prohibited, and
Saudi charities are prohibited from transferring money outside the
country to ensure that charitable funds do not find their way to violent
extremists. In 2005, the kingdom launched a national public awareness
campaign against extremism that is still ongoing to counter the
extremist narrative and educate our public about the dangers of violent
extremism. In 2008, it launched a global interfaith dialogue to promote
harmony among the world\'s religions and cultures. A global center was
established in Vienna to continue this effort. In addition to actions,
**[Saudi Arabia has worked with other nations to combat terrorism---both
diplomatically and militarily.]{.underline}** Through a \$110 million
grant, Saudi Arabia helped establish the United Nations
Counter-Terrorism Center to combat terrorism, address the mindset of
extremism that foments terrorism and build the capacity of U.N. member
states to fight against terrorism. **[Saudi Arabia has established
\"fusion cells\" where law enforcement and intelligence officials from
Saudi Arabia, the United States and other partners work closely together
to investigate and interdict terrorism plots and
finances.]{.underline}** Saudi Air Force planes were one of the first to
fly sorties over Syria as part of the military actions against ISIS, and
Saudi Arabia is leading a coalition of 38 Islamic countries to fight
terrorism and extremism.

Among the most magical urban myths floating around the Trump
administration is that [Saudi Arabia]{.underline} is
[America]{.underline}\'s strategic partner and the relationship is
simply too big to fail. Sadly, that [relationship is already
failing.]{.underline} Indeed, under the leadership of Crown Prince
Mohammed bin Salman (also known as MBS), [Saudi Arabia has willfully
pursued policies that have undermined both American interests and
values]{.underline}. Worse still, the [Trump]{.underline} administration
[envisions a role for Saudi Arabia in its Middle East strategy that can
only disappoint.]{.underline} In recent weeks, Turkish authorities have
accused the Saudi regime of responsibility for the murder of Washington
Post journalist Jamal Khashoggi inside Saudi Arabia\'s consulate in
Istanbul. The Saudi government has blamed rogue operatives for the
killing and dismissed a number of high-ranking officials. There\'s no
doubt that Saudi Arabia is important to the United States. Preserving
global access to its oil, avoiding the chaos that would be unleashed if
the kingdom collapsed or became a failed state, and cooperation on
counter-terrorism are clearly core US interests. But to concede these
interests doesn\'t mean Saudi Arabia is a reliable security partner of
the United States or that Riyadh is America\'s strategic ally. [Saudi
Arabia is]{.underline} in fact [a repressive police state that has long
exported a strain of Islam supportive of Islamic jihadi terrorist
activity and that ideologically has been hostile to]{.underline}
America, [the West]{.underline}, Jews and Christians. [MBS]{.underline}
has made an effort to restrain religious extremism. But he\'s also
[launched a major crackdown to concentrate absolute power]{.underline},
repress civil society and journalists and jail or intimidate his
opponents. As for promoting US interests, the past year and a half reads
like a DIY manual in undermining them. The detention of the Lebanese
Prime Minister, in an apparent bid to force his resignation, has only
strengthened Hezbollah. [Bin Salman]{.underline}\'s disastrous boycott
of Qatar [made it more difficult]{.underline} for the Gulf Cooperation
Council [to stand up to Iran]{.underline} and has driven Doha and Tehran
closer together, [and his failed military campaign in Yemen has created
instability, polarized the region and expanded rather than contracted
Iranian influence]{.underline} (and given ISIS more room to maneuver).
[Saudi Arabia has]{.underline} proven to be too weak and incompetent to
be a bulwark against Iran; on the contrary, it has [been an enabler of

DUBAI: [Although US-Saudi relations may have been shaky]{.underline} in
recent times, [Prince Turki Al-Faisal,]{.underline} chairman of the
board at the King Faisal Center for Research and Islamic Studies,
[expressed optimism about their future]{.underline}
evolution[.]{.underline} Appearing at the Milken Institute MENA Summit
in Abu Dhabi on Wednesday, Prince Turki spoke of the history of the
relationship, which dates back to the 19th century. "In perspective,
they go back a long time and, in that time, we have had our ups and
downs, and we have agreed on some things and disagreed on others," he
said. "[It's one of those times when there has been a lot of hype about
the relationship, especially in the media and in the US following issues
like (the killing of Jamal) Khashoggi, the war in Yemen and
others."]{.underline} From a Saudi perspective, he argued that the
strategic interest of both countries would override whatever current
issues have risen. "From that context, [the Kingdom's steadfast and very
rock-solid engagement with the US in the last 70-odd years has weathered
equally difficult times,"]{.underline} he said. "Not only on the
Palestinian issue, the Ramadan War in 1973 and the oil embargo, but also
9/11 and Bin Laden, and yet, we've had a constant number of American
expatriates living in Saudi, from 25,000 to 30,000 over the years."
Today, [**the US hosts more than 100,000 Saudis as a result of the
education program** that the late King Abdullah launched a few years
ago.]{.underline} Aside from business interests -- and the
**[US']{.underline}** position as **[Saudi's largest
investo]{.underline}r** --- Prince Turki described such links as equally
strategic and important because they brought people together. He
expressed hope that representatives in the US Senate and Congress would
see Saudi "for what it is," and not for what the media made it out to
be. Speaking on the Khashoggi investigation, he said the Kingdom had
taken those considered responsible for the "vicious and heinous crime"
to court. "The court procedures in Saudi are well-defined, and they are
known to US representatives in Riyadh. Let that take its course. For
many years, Americans and others used to (say) the Kingdom did not have
a sound system and now, they ask us to interfere in the judicial system,
so make up your mind." He said Saudi respected its system as well as the
system of others, adding that the courts would decide and, whatever they
decided, the Executive Authority would implement it. "It could have been
handled better, and there have been mistakes committed," he explained.
"We have admitted those mistakes, we clarified our position on that, we
arrested the people suspected of doing those mistakes, and we can go on
from there." In terms of the US policy in the Middle East, Prince Turki
said that the US had defined important objectives in the region. "From
day one, US President Donald Trump declared he wanted to reach a
solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, and he described it as the
deal of the century. And I hope he comes through with that. I don't know
the terms of the deal or if anyone else knows, but there have been
engagements with leaders of the Arab world on the issue." He mentioned
[**Trump's** declaration of **identifying Iran as the major instigator
of unrest in the region**]{.underline}**, [and]{.underline}** his will
to change its course of action through **[sanctions]{.underline}** and
other measures, [including the withdrawal from the nuclear
deal.]{.underline} "Those [**are things that Saudi definitely
supports**]{.underline} and would like to see happen," he said. "On
other issues, I wouldn't want to see the US withdrawing from our part of
the world because it has interests here, not just financial and
business, but also on humanitarian terms. The long history of US
engagement goes back to the 19th century, and it's for everybody to
see." From the American University in Beirut to the American University
in Cairo, the launch of some of these institutions from the 19th century
was said to reveal the amount of interaction between the US and the Arab
world. Prince Turki said Arab countries felt at rest and developed a
trust for the US when it stood by them during Saddam Hussein's invasion
of Kuwait in 1990. "It was with the US' help and support that we managed
to get that issue settled positively. The US shed blood in our part of
the world, sometimes positively, sometimes negatively, but the positives
are there to see, so we'd like to keep the US engaged in our part of the
world and a withdrawal only allows for malevolent forces to come in." A
US withdrawal from Syria, he said, would entail Iran's expansion of its
influence in the country, which contradicted the Trump administration's
intention of pushing Iranians out of Syria. "It's a huge disappointment
on a personal level. I remember when the US invaded Iraq, and the same
applies to Syria. It will have worse consequences." Asked about Iran's
presence in the nuclear deal, he said it made no difference as its
actions on the ground were very negative and have not changed. "(The
expansion) of [Iran's nuclear program]{.underline} would be a concern
for Saudi. And [the only way you can deal with that is to continue to
sanction Iran as Trump has done."]{.underline} But issues across the
region at large remained. Although Prince Turki did not foresee any
potential Saudi-Israeli engagement, he said the Palestinian issue was at
the top of the agenda for the Kingdom. "There is a much broader issue of
problems in the Middle East, and the Palestinian one is a big issue. A
solution to the crisis must be a priority for the region and the world."
Prince Turki described himself as a realist, taking issues in the region
on a "day-to-day" basis. Some potential achievements he named for this
year could include a breakthrough with the deal of the century and Iran
changing its course in the region. His main optimism, however, lay with
Saudi's Vision 2030 reform plan and the transformations taking place
across the Kingdom. "With all of the criticism that it has acquired
since its announcement (in 2016), it has proven to be a very viable and
durable look into the future. When the king and crown prince announced
the vision, they clearly said it was a not divine revelation. It can be
altered, reviewed, diminished and increased, and that's what has been
happening. Timetables have changed." His main take from it was that it
had enthused Saudi citizens --- and not just the 70 percent under the
age of 30. "I'm not of that demographic, and I'm equally enthused on
what the vision has promised and what I see the government is doing. The
two aspects that give me hope are that government departments have
become more accountable on what they do in the Kingdom than ever before,
and our financial institutions, especially the Ministry of Finance and
the budgeting system in Saudi, have become much more transparent." He
described the presence of quarterly reports on how government
departments were performing, in terms of spending funds allocated to
them by the ministry. "That, to me, is an indication that there is
seriousness in wanting to accomplish what Vision 2030 has promised.
Overall, Prince Turki said he was optimistic about the relationship
between Saudi Arabia and the US in the year ahead. "We're much closer
than ever before, and we're setting an example as two countries,
especially in the Gulf, that have overcome the challenges that have kept
us apart in the past, and we're seeking to come together. Hopefulness
will include issues of resolving the difference we have in the GCC (Gulf
Cooperation Council) especially with the leadership in Qatar that has so
far refused to engage on a positive scale with complaints placed on the
table. "In terms of human relations, I'm very hopeful that my
grandchildren will have a much better world to look up to because they
have the tools, which is the mobile phone -- it has everything in it
and, when I was growing up, we had to aspire to get to libraries, listen
to teachers and read books, but you can get it all from that little
machine today, and I hope it will be a positive factor in allowing my
grandchildren in having a better life."

#### The alliance is unbreakable

[The shocking allegations of Jamal Khashoggi's killing and dismemberment
in the Saudi Arabian consulate in Istanbul have led to a rare open
debate among politicians, pundits, and business leaders about the
strategic wisdom of U.S.-Saudi relations. When the debate subsides,
however, it's unlikely to have transformed America's long-standing
relationship with Saudi Arabia, and the Gulf kingdom's regional allies,
in any substantial way. The reason is simple: geography---more
specifically, the U.S. military's peculiar relationship to
it.]{.underline} For decades, the United States has professed several
vital (and lesser) national interests in the Middle East. These
interests include assuring the free flow of oil and natural gas,
preventing the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, preventing
the emergence of ungoverned areas that terrorist organizations can
utilize, containing Iran, and enhancing the capacity of regional
militaries to defend their own territory. American political and
military officials have consistently contended that the military should
have the predominant role in achieving these interests. And, to ensure
that military forces and assets can operate with sufficient latitude in
the region to achieve said interests, those forces need reliable and
predictable access to the airfields, ports, facilities, and airspace
located on the sovereign territory of Persian Gulf countries.
Cyber-capabilities or smaller, less-lethal units operating from naval
assets in international waters are not an adequate or reliable
substitute. Across Democratic and Republican administrations, direct and
stable military access to the Middle East has been a far higher
foreign-policy priority than any competing moral or ethical
consideration in the region. This is the conclusion I reached over the
past year researching U.S. military policy in the Middle East, the
results of which were recently published by Chatham House. This included
speaking with dozens of current and former military officials,
diplomats, and executives from contractors that provide security
services to regional militaries. I also reviewed the best publicly
available information from government and nongovernmental sources,
compiled data on U.S. military deployments and security cooperation
programs, and applied the latest academic findings on the measurable
impact of deployments and operations. [My central finding was that the
United States' regional alliances consisted of a relatively simple
exchange: Washington provides security cooperation, weapons, and
logistical support, and in return, regional governments offer assured
access to their territory for the U.S. military. This might seem
unsurprising---but the biggest revelation of my conversations was the
depth, breadth, and scope of this reciprocal relationship. It isn't
simply transactional and temporary, but built upon decades of close
personal contacts between U.S. military leaders and their regional
interlocutors. These relationships extend beyond the Americans'
active-duty service and have allowed Middle Eastern governing regimes to
receive a pass from human and political rights concerns. To some extent,
the relationships now exist to serve themselves, rather than U.S.
interests.]{.underline} Security cooperation programs are the routine
touchpoints between U.S. military forces (and contractors) and their
Middle East counterparts. For example, in 2017, 9,007 officers from
Middle East countries received instruction---on subjects including
tactical combat skills and civil-military relations---at Defense
Department educational institutions, primarily within the United States.
[Weapons and munitions sales are also an enormous and visible element of
Washington's collaboration with regional militaries. For two decades,
the United States has been the largest weapons exporter to the Middle
East, and from 2013 to 2017, 49 percent of all U.S. weapons by value
went to countries in the region.]{.underline} Security cooperation also
includes numerous examples of U.S. logistical and analytical aid for
operations conducted by local militaries: America's expedited munitions
and fuel shipments to Israel five days into its war against Hezbollah in
2006, a joint surveillance and intelligence cell to support Turkish
airstrikes against forces associated with the Kurdistan Workers' Party
(PKK) in northern Iraq, and, most notoriously, the combat search and
rescue, in-air refueling, and intelligence analysis that the U.S.
military has provided to the Saudi-led bombing campaign in Yemen. There
are also less-recognized, informal cooperation activities that retired
military officers provide to Middle East governments. After stepping
down as the commander of U.S. Central Command, now-Secretary of Defense
James Mattis, while also on the board of directors for defense
contractor General Dynamics, served as an unpaid military advisor to the
United Arab Emirates, from June 2015 until August 2016. Retired Gen.
James Jones worked at Ironhand Security LLC with the Saudi Ministry of
Defense, while retired Maj. Gen. Thomas Moore Jr. consulted for Stark
Aerospace Business Development, based in Israel. More shocking is
Stephen Toumajan, who retired from the U.S. Army as a lieutenant colonel
in 2007 and is now a two-star general within the UAE military's Joint
Aviation Command. These activities enhance the capacity of local
security services, which, in turn, enables and sustains the close
relations that reliably permit U.S. military access. [As a result, U.S.
military policy is not based on any objective evaluation but is
immensely influenced by regional governments.]{.underline} These
distortions are intensified by U.S. public relations firms. These firms
arrange meetings to represent the interests of regional governments with
members of Congress, administration officials, research fellows at think
tanks, editorial boards, journalists, corporate executives, and any
other influencer. (Trust me, if you publish columns that run counter to
the perceptions they seek to promote, these firms will reach out
directly and repeatedly in an effort to change your mind.) As of June,
according to the Foreign Agents Registration Act website, Saudi Arabia
was being represented within the United States by 28 PR firms; Qatar,
24; the UAE, 16; Iraq, 15 firms and individuals; Israel, seven; and
Egypt, three. [President Donald Trump repeatedly decries the cost and
futility of America's role in the region, declaring in June: "I say it
so much and it's so sad, but we have \$7 trillion in the Middle East.
You might as well throw it out the window." Despite Trump's strident
belief that Middle East governments are "ripping off" taxpayers, and
that the United States should be reimbursed for its troop presence, he
has ordered no noticeable shift in military policy toward the region. In
fact, the military's footprint has only increased since he entered of
office, from 40,517 troops in the Middle East in June 2017 to 54,180
four months later]{.underline}. Moreover, despite rhetorically pushing
for them, the Trump administration has received no reimbursements from
Middle East governments in exchange for U.S. forces being stationed in
the region[. While nobody can predict how the domestic political fallout
of the Khashoggi slaying will unfold, it is improbable that Trump will
take any steps that risk U.S. military access and, by extension, the
vast number of missions that U.S. forces have been tasked to fulfill in
the region.]{.underline} Indeed, late last week, just as the gruesome
allegations of Khashoggi's death were being revealed, Chairman of the
Joint Chiefs of Staff Gen. Joseph Dunford met with his Saudi
counterpart, Chief of the General Staff Gen. Fayyad Al-Ruwayli, in
Washington. The Pentagon announced alongside the meeting notice, "[The
U.S. and Saudi Arabia share a long-standing partnership and are
committed to peace and security in the Middle East region." Due to
America's many vital national interests that presidents have declared in
the region, that partnership, and those with neighboring allies and
neutrals, are a military necessity---no matter how implicated the United
States has become in the actions of those partners]{.underline}.

### Alliance Defense

#### Saudi Arabia not key to any US strategy 

**Editorial Board 18**

(Editorial Board, 10-15-2018, \"Who needs Saudi Arabia?,\" Washington
Post;
<https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/global-opinions/who-needs-saudi-arabia/2018/10/15/3ebe473c-d0a1-11e8-8c22-fa2ef74bd6d6_story.html>;

SAUDI ARABIA, so far, has tried bluster and bullying to silence the
questions about journalist Jamal Khashoggi, who disappeared in the Saudi
Consulate in Istanbul two weeks ago Tuesday. On Sunday, [a regime
statement threatened to "respond with a larger action" to any sanction
stemming from the case]{.underline}; Saudi-owned media floated such
steps as cutting back oil production, buying arms from Russia and
holding back counterterrorism intelligence. On Monday, King Salman told
President Trump in a phone call that he "denies any knowledge of what
took place," according to Mr. Trump, who added "it sounded to me like
maybe it could have been rogue killers." That preposterous suggestion
may have anticipated a change in the Saudi story; CNN reported that the
regime was preparing to admit that Mr. Khashoggi died in an
interrogation gone wrong. If so, there must be consequences not just for
those who supposedly erred in killing the journalist but also for
whomever ordered the illegal operation in the first place. U.S.
intelligence intercepts suggest the order came from Mohammed bin Salman,
the reckless crown prince whose excesses had been criticized by Mr.
Khashoggi in columns for The Post. We expect to learn more soon:
Whatever happened to Mr. Khashoggi appears to have been recorded on
video or audiotape. In the meantime, [it's worth considering just how
much the United States might have to lose if its relationship with Saudi
Arabia ruptured.]{.underline} What about that oil, and the \$110 billion
in arms purchases Mr. Trump keeps talking about? What about the war on
terrorism? Start with the oil. [Saudi Arabia, according to the U.S.
Energy Information Administration, supplied 9 percent of U.S. petroleum
imports in 2017, or about 960,000 barrels a day. But thanks to the shale
revolution, the United States is essentially energy
independent:]{.underline} It, not Saudi Arabia, is now the world's
largest crude-oil producer. Last year, U.S. daily oil exports averaged
6.38 million barrels, or nearly seven times the Saudi imports. [If the
Saudis cut back production or boycotted the United States, they could
temporarily drive up prices, but the beneficiaries would be U.S. shale
companies, which over time would fill the gap --- and deal a devastating
blow to the Saudi oil industry.]{.underline} As for arms sales, someone
needs to brief Mr. Trump on the actual results of the promises made to
him when he visited Riyadh last year. As Bruce Riedel of the Brookings
Institution sums it up, "[The Saudis have not concluded a single major
arms deal with Washington on Trump's watch." Moreover,]{.underline} [an
end to supplies of U.S. spare parts and technical support, something
Russia cannot provide, would quickly ground the Saudi air
force.]{.underline} That would have the welcome effect of ending a
bloody bombing campaign in Yemen that a U.N. investigation concluded was
probably responsible for war crimes. [Saudi Arabia does supply the
United States with counterterrorism intelligence. But as Andrew Miller
of the Project on Middle East Democracy points out, stopping it "would
be a colossal error . . . when there's already a strong perception in
Congress and with Americans that Saudi Arabia has fueled
extremism."]{.underline} Mr. Miller notes that a law passed by Congress
in 2016 opens the way for civil suits against the Saudi government for
any terrorist acts it enables. [The reality is that Saudi Arabia, which,
as Mr. Trump himself has crudely pointed out, would not survive without
U.S. security support, has everything to lose from a break in relations,
while the United States no longer needs the kingdom as much as it once
did. Mr. Trump has overvalued the relationship and encouraged Saudi
leaders to believe they can behave recklessly and even criminally
without consequence.]{.underline} Whatever the outcome of the Khashoggi
case, a fundamental reshaping of the relationship --- mandated by
Congress, if necessary --- is imperative.

#### US-Saudi alliance decks progress on climate change -- there's only a yearlong window to act

[Reasons to be fearful?]{.underline} With exquisite timing, the likely
UK COP in 2020 could also be the moment the US finally pulls out of the
Paris agreement. But if Donald Trump doesn\'t prevail in the
presidential election that position could change, with a democrat victor
likely to reverse the decision. Either step could have huge consequences
for the climate fight. Right now [a number of countries seem keen to
slow down progress.]{.underline} Last December the US, Saudi Arabia,
Kuwait and Russia blocked the IPCC special report on 1.5C from UN talks.
Just a few weeks ago in Bonn, further [objections from Saudi Arabia
meant it was again dropped from the UN negotiations]{.underline}, much
to annoyance of small island states and developing nations. **[The US
and Saudi Arabia have joined forces to restrict the use of IPCC science
reports in climate talks]{.underline}** There will be significant
pressure on the host country to ensure substantial progress. But if
there\'s ongoing political turmoil around Brexit then the government may
not have the bandwidth to unpick the multiple global challenges that
climate change presents. \"If we cannot use that moment to accelerate
ambition we will have no chance of getting to a 1.5 or 2C limit,\" said
Prof Michael Jacobs, from the University of Sheffield, a former climate
adviser to Prime Minister Gordon Brown. \"Right now [there\'s nothing
like enough understanding of, or commitment to, this among leading
countries.]{.underline} That\'s why the UN Secretary General is holding
a summit in September. \"It\'s great that the COP might be in UK because
we have a big civil society ecosystem and much higher climate awareness
than in most other countries. But the movement here has barely started
to think about how to apply sufficient pressure.\" There\'s also been a
strong warning shot from the UK\'s Committee on Climate Change (CCC). At
the launch of their review of progress made by the UK government on
tackling climate change, the country was found not to be on track
despite legislating for net zero emissions by 2050. \"The government
must show it is serious about its legal obligations...\[its\]
credibility really is at stake here,\" said CCC chief executive Chris
Stark. \"**[There is a window over the next 12-18 months to do something
about this.]{.underline}** If we don\'t see that, I fear the government
will be embarrassed at COP26.\" And it\'s not all about climate change
While the decisions taken on climate change in the next year or so will
be critical, there are a number of other key gatherings on the
environment that will shape the nature on preserving species and
protecting our oceans in the coming decades. Earlier this year a major
study on the losses being felt across the natural world as result of
broader human impacts caused a huge stir among governments. The IPBES
report showed that up to **[one million species could be lost in coming
decades.]{.underline}** To address this, governments will meet in China
next year to try to agree a deal that will protect creatures of all
types. The Convention on Biological Diversity is the UN body tasked with
putting together a plan to protect nature up to 2030. Next year\'s
meeting could be a \"Paris agreement\" moment for the natural world. If
agreement is found it\'s likely there will be an emphasis on sustainable
farming and fishing. It will urge greater protection for species and a
limit on deforestation. Next year, the UN Convention on the Laws of the
Sea will also meet to negotiate a new global oceans treaty. This has the
potential to make a real difference, according to UK Environment
Secretary Michael Gove. \"We have been convinced by the evidence of
[environmental degradation]{.underline} which [occurs without adequate
protection]{.underline},\" he said in a speech last week. \"And that is
why the United Kingdom has taken the lead in ensuring at least 30% of
the ocean we are responsible for is protected by 2030 - a trebling of
the present target. We will be asking all nations to sign up to that
goal.\" [If all this comes to pass, the world might have a fighting
chance of preserving our natural environment. **But the challenges are
huge, the political involvement patchy.**]{.underline} So don\'t hold
your breath!

It seems every week there\'s a scary new report about how [man-made
climate change is going to cause the collapse of the world\'s ice
sheets, result in the extinction of up to **1 million animal
species**]{.underline} and --- if that wasn\'t bad enough --- make our
beer very, very expensive. This week, a new policy paper from an
Australian think tank claims that those other reports are slightly off;
the [risks of climate change are]{.underline} actually [**much, much
worse** than anyone can imagine.]{.underline} According to the paper,
[climate change poses a]{.underline} \"near- to mid-term [**existential
threat** to human civilization]{.underline},\" and there\'s a good
chance **[society could collapse as soon as 2050 if serious mitigation
actions aren\'t taken in the next decade.]{.underline}** Published by
the Breakthrough National Centre for Climate Restoration in Melbourne
(an independent think tank focused on climate policy) and authored by a
climate researcher and a former fossil fuel executive, the paper\'s
central thesis is that climate scientists are too restrained in their
predictions of how climate change will affect the planet in the near
future. \[Top 9 Ways the World Could End\] Advertisement The current
climate crisis, they say, is larger and more complex than any humans
have ever dealt with before. General climate models --- like the one
that the United Nations\' Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) used in 2018 to
predict that [a global temperature increase of]{.underline} 3.6 degrees
Fahrenheit ([2 degrees Celsius) could put **hundreds of millions** of
people at risk]{.underline} --- fail to account for the sheer complexity
of Earth\'s many interlinked geological processes; as such, they fail to
adequately predict the scale of the potential consequences. The truth,
the authors wrote, is probably far worse than any models can fathom. How
the world ends What might an accurate worst-case picture of the
planet\'s climate-addled future actually look like, then? The authors
provide one particularly grim scenario that begins with world
governments \"politely ignoring\" the advice of scientists and the will
of the public to decarbonize the economy (finding alternative energy
sources), resulting in a global temperature increase 5.4 F (3 C) by the
year 2050. At this point, the world\'s **[ice sheets
vanish]{.underline}**; brutal **[droughts kill]{.underline}** many of
the **[trees in the Amazon rainforest (removing one of the world\'s
largest carbon offsets); and the planet plunges into a feedback loop of
ever-hotter, ever-deadlier conditions]{.underline}**. \"Thirty-five
percent of the global land area, and 55 percent of the global
population, are subject to more than 20 days a year of **[lethal heat
conditions, beyond the threshold of human
survivability]{.underline}**,\" the authors hypothesized. Meanwhile,
droughts, floods and wildfires regularly ravage the land. Nearly
**[one-third of the world\'s land surface turns to
desert]{.underline}**. **[Entire ecosystems collapse,]{.underline}**
**[beginning with]{.underline}** the planet\'s **[coral reefs, the
rainforest and the Arctic ice sheets.]{.underline}** The world\'s
tropics are hit hardest by these new climate extremes,
**[destroying]{.underline}** the region\'s **[ag]{.underline}**riculture
**[and turning more than 1 billion people into refugees.]{.underline}**
This **[mass movement of refugees]{.underline}** --- **[coupled with
shrinking coastlines and severe drops in food and water
availability]{.underline}** --- begin to **[stress the fabric of the
world\'s largest nations, including the U]{.underline}**nited
**[S]{.underline}**tates. **[Armed conflicts over
resources,]{.underline}** perhaps **[culminating in nuclear war, are
likely.]{.underline}** The result, according to the new paper, is
\"outright chaos\" and perhaps \"the end of human global civilization as
we know it.\" How can this catastrophic vision of the future be
prevented? Only with the people of the world accepting climate change
for the emergency it is and getting to work --- immediately. According
to the paper\'s authors, **[the human race has about one decade left to
mount a global movement to transition the world economy to a
zero-carbon-emissions system]{.underline}**. (Achieving [zero-carbon
emissions requires either not emitting carbon or balancing carbon
emissions with carbon removal.]{.underline}) The effort required to do
so \"would be akin in scale to the World War II emergency
mobilization,\" the authors wrote. The new policy paper was endorsed
with a foreword by Adm. Chris Barrie, a retired Australian defense chief
and senior royal navy commander who has testified before the Australian
Senate about the devastating possibilities climate change poses to
national security and overall human well-being. \"I told the \[Senate\]
Inquiry that, after nuclear war, **[human-induced global warming is the
greatest threat to human life on the planet,\"]{.underline}** Barrie
wrote in the new paper. \"Human life on Earth may be on the way to
extinction, in the most horrible way.\"

The meeting held in Katowice, Poland, last week to discuss the further
implementation of the Paris climate agreement was hailed by the
participants as a success. A complete breakdown was avoided; the
appearance of multilateralism was preserved. But it was a triumph of
process over substance. [The **alliance** of the **U**nited **S**tates,
**Saudi Arabia**, and Russia blocked adequate recognition of the
apocalyptic findings of the latest report by the U.N.
I]{.underline}ntergovernmental [P]{.underline}anel on
[C]{.underline}limate [C]{.underline}hange, [and Brazil has withdrawn
from hosting the next meeting]{.underline}. More important, no decisions
were taken on emissions. The governments of Poland and
**[the]{.underline} [U]{.underline}**nited **[S]{.underline}**tates
**[even used the meeting to reaffirm their commitment to
coal]{.underline}**. In due course this blindness may be overcome. But
time is of the essence. It is commonly said that **[climate
change]{.underline}** is a global risk that affects everyone. But that
truism hides an essential difference. It **[is far riskier for some
populations than for others.]{.underline}** The current targets put the
world on track for a 3.5-degree Celsius temperature rise; **[that is
enough to doom the island nations in the Caribbean, Pacific, and
elsewhere whose very existence is called into question by rising sea
levels.]{.underline}** Inhabitants of **[coastal areas around the world
face mass displacement.]{.underline}** In delta regions like Bangladesh
that will involve tens of millions of people. But they at least have a
hinterland to retreat to. [For islanders, there is no
retreat.]{.underline} In addition to practical contingencies, this
crisis has raised new and fundamental questions about international
politics. [What does sovereignty mean when global risks are so
unequal]{.underline}? How will countries with a finite life expectancy
conceive of politics? And what is the world's responsibility when the
first nations begin to disappear under water? **[The answers will likely
add up to a revolution in global order.]{.underline}** This will become
especially apparent for the United States. The conservative wing of
American politics is the global leader in climate change
denialism---indeed, it is the credo of the Trump administration. But,
given the consequences for the international order that the United
States has underwritten and the responsibilities that will soon be
forced upon the country by its immediate neighborhood, this is an
increasingly untenable position for the American government machinery to
uphold. The most vulnerable island states tend to be small. In the blunt
economic calculus of climate change, as specified by one of this year's
economic Nobel laureates, William Nordhaus, the fate of **[the Maldives,
Jamaica, or the Bahamas barely weighs in the balance]{.underline}**.
Their small scale also means that they are powerless to affect what
happens. No renewable energy policy they might adopt will make any
difference. [It will be the consumption and]{.underline} production of
fossil fuel by the great population centers of the West and Asia and the
[fossil fuel economies of the giant producers---the United States, Saudi
Arabia, Russia---that will **decide their fate.**]{.underline} The big
states have their own economic and political reasons for their
reticence. The governments in Brazil and the United States that are
boycotting climate change diplomacy are democratically elected. But the
violence they are threatening to smaller states is radical. One might
shrug. The **[archipelago nation-states are fragile
entities.]{.underline}** The history of human settlement on many of them
is not continuous. But the fact is that during the 20th century they
were **[cast as nation-states.]{.underline}** Sovereign equality may be
a hypocritical fiction. But one of the core assumptions of nation-state
sovereignty is permanence. The only legitimate way to dismantle a
sovereign is for it to spawn others. **[The extinction of
sovereignty]{.underline}** as, for instance, in the partition of Poland
in 1939 between Nazi Germany and Stalin's Soviet Union, **[is the
definition of international crime]{.underline}**. The Soviets at least
incorporated the population of eastern Poland as citizens. There is
little discussion today of compensating for the impending widespread
loss of sovereignty. This development will also have affect the basic
structure of international relations. **[Sovereign permanence is a basic
assumption of our present global order.]{.underline}** Internationally,
the assumption that nations have infinite time horizons is the
foundation of all ideas of a stable and lasting international community,
**[which structures all international cooperation]{.underline}**.
Domestically, in any given country, this assumption structures all
policy discussions by distinguishing states from the individuals who are
their citizens; in extremis, it's the legitimacy of the state's
permanence that entitles governments to call on their citizens to make
the ultimate sacrifice. In mundane terms, it is what gives states their
ability to sustain enormous debts on an essentially permanent basis.
These basic unquestioned features of our political order are now in
jeopardy. Rich countries worry about "dying out" due to demographic
decline. But that can be fixed by migration. Climate change faces island
nations with something even more elemental. They will cease to be viable
as territorial states. They will literally disappear from the map.
Relatively affluent island states like the Bahamas talk boldly about
mitigation. But 80 percent of the Bahamas is one meter or less above sea
level. What can mitigation possibly mean in that case? And what of
Haiti, whose impoverished population lives crowded in the flood plain
that borders deforested and infertile mountains? The
**[weakening]{.underline}** of the basic assumption of **[sovereign
permanence will inevitably have political and financial knock-on effects
that have yet to be reckoned with.]{.underline}** The world must decide
how to treat sovereign states when their time horizon becomes limited.
What kind of investment can be justified in a state whose life span is
numbered in decades? When does lending money for reconstruction after
the latest devastating hurricane no longer make sense? These are already
questions for sovereign debt markets and ratings agencies. But they will
also become basic political questions for the entire international
community. And if there is no reinvestment and reconstruction, what
then? **[How will the political systems of post-colonial states react
when it becomes evident that they have been doomed to extinction by
decisions taken by more powerful and far larger actors in the rest of
the world? One might speculate darkly that the existential crisis of the
island nations might produce a radical response. It's possible to
imagine they would resort to some type of threat to force more urgent
policy change in the rest of the world.]{.underline}**

Asia W. Patrick Murphy made the comments in Canberra at the end of a
three-day Australian visit for talks with officials in the newly
re-elected government on expanding their security alliance. Six
**[Pacific island nations]{.underline}** officially recognise Taiwan,
accounting for a third of Taipei's diplomatic allies around the world.
But they **[are under growing pressure from Beijing to switch allegiance
as it builds influence in the region.]{.underline}** Murphy said
diplomatic decisions should not be influenced by mainland China. "China
is attempting to reduce Taiwan's diplomatic relations in the region and
that's kind of heavy-handed," he said. "It gives rise to tensions by
changing the status quo and then the possibility of conflict." Taiwan
says freezing it out of WHO summit could backfire Solomon Islands Prime
Minister Rick Hou had promised to review the nation's relations with
Taiwan before he lost power at elections last month. Switching
recognition to Beijing, the Solomons' biggest export market, remains a
live issue. Murphy said the United States had "strong diplomatic
relations" with the Solomons, and had congratulated new Prime Minister
Manasseh Sogavare. He declined to say whether he discussed with
Australian officials concerns of some security analysts that [Beijing
wanted to construct a deep water military base somewhere in the Pacific.
**Chinese militarisation in the Pacific would be as destabilising as its
militarisation of disputed islands in the South China
Sea**]{.underline}, he said. "**[A growing military presence anywhere in
the region of a country like China that doesn't work on a rules-based
approach or adhere to international standards is and should be of
concern]{.underline}**," Murphy said. "[We have a lot of national
interests in the region that are built on freedoms of commerce,
navigation and overflight. We have key partners and the establishment of
a military presence there, the notion, the concept is indeed quite
troubling." Pacific islanders feel squeeze as Beijing bans tour
groups]{.underline} Murphy is expected to fly to Australia's nearest
neighbour, [Papua New Guinea]{.underline}, on Saturday where Prime
Minister Peter O'Neill [backs Beijing's territorial claims in the
S]{.underline}outh [C]{.underline}hina [S]{.underline}ea. **[The US and
Australia have committed to redevelop a Papua New Guinea naval base on
Manus Island]{.underline}**. Murphy said the Lombrum Naval Base
expansion was about "partnership with Papua New Guinea and meeting its
needs", not denying China a military presence in the poor nation of
about 8 million people. When Australia and Papua New Guinea announced
the upgrade in October, China cautioned both countries to discard "cold
war" thinking, referring to an era when the world was less integrated.
"[The Pacific island countries should not be the sphere of influence of
any country,]{.underline}" [Chinese foreign ministry
spokesman]{.underline} Lu [Kang said]{.underline} at the time.

### Alliance Bad -- Stability 

**Ending our commitment to Saudi Arabia is good -- stabilizes the middle
east, oil prices, reduces terror and deters iran threat.**

**Walt 2018** (Stephen Walt, IR @ Harvard, \"The Islamic Republic of
Hysteria\", Foreign Policy, January 16 2018,
<https://foreignpolicy.com/2018/01/16/the-islamic-republic-of-hysteria-iran-middle-east-trump/>

Fortunately, no state inside or outside the Middle East was then --- or
is today --- in a position to control it. As a result, the United States
does not have to do much to maintain a regional balance of power.
**[Instead of giving Saudi Arabia]{.underline}** or **Israel [a blank
check to counter some mythical Iranian hegemon, Washington should seek
more balanced relations with all states in the region, Iran
included]{.underline}**[. This more equitable approach would facilitate
cooperation on issues where U.S. and Iranian interests align, such as
Afghanistan.]{.underline} The prospect of better relations with the
United States [would give Tehran an incentive to moderate its
behavior]{.underline}. Past U.S. efforts to isolate the clerical regime
encouraged it to play a spoiler's role instead, with some degree of
success. This approach [would also discourage America's present allies
from taking U.S. support for granted and encourage them to do more to
retain its favor]{.underline}. America's current regional allies (and
their domestic lobbies) would surely protest vehemently [if Washington
stopped backing them]{.underline} to the hilt and sought even a modest
détente with Iran. But that is ultimately their problem, not America's.
**[Excessive U.S. support encourages allies to behave
recklessly,]{.underline}** as Israel does when it expands illegal
settlements and **[as Saudi Arabia is doing with its military campaign
in Yemen]{.underline}**, its diplomatic squabble with Qatar, and its
bungled attempt to reshape politics inside Lebanon. [If U.S. allies
understood that Washington was talking to everyone, however, they would
have more reason to listen to America's advice lest it curtail its
support and look elsewhere]{.underline}. Having many options is the
ultimate source of leverage. Playing balance-of-power politics in the
Middle East does not require Washington to abandon its current allies
completely or tilt toward Tehran. Rather, it means using U.S. power to
maintain a rough balance, discourage overt efforts to alter the status
quo, and prevent any state from dominating the region while helping
local powers resolve their differences. Lowering the temperature in
[this way would safeguard access to oil, dampen desire in the region for
weapons of mass destruction, and give these states less reason to fund
extremists and other proxies.]{.underline}

Even in the unpopular 2003 invasion of Iraq, the Bush administration
cobbled together a small coalition of willing countries to join America
in combat. At best, should the U.S. go to war against Iran, it will be
able to muster the diplomatic and perhaps military support of four
countries: the United Kingdom, Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates
and Israel. Otherwise, the rest of the world has been completely put off
by the Trump administration\'s unilateralism, belligerent nationalism,
its decision to leave the nuclear agreement without a compelling cause

with Iran. **[A war with Iran without significant international support,

America\'s experiences with the use of military force in Afghanistan,
Iraq and even Syria. When a president is deciding whether to put
Americans in harm\'s way, it\'s critical to ask not just can we, but
should we, what will it cost and what\'s the exit strategy? We hope
those are under consideration. Because **[of all the plausible military
conflicts confronting America today, we cannot think of one that\'s more
unnecessary, counterproductive and fraught with greater uncertainty and
risk than stumbling or willfully heading into war with

Almost two decades ago, I went to dinner at a restaurant called Peking
in the Zamalek neighborhood of Cairo to celebrate the Chinese New Year.
During what I vaguely remember being a raucous dinner, the crowd at the
restaurant was asked to hush because a special guest had arrived. It was
China's ambassador to Egypt, who took the floor with a young Chinese
woman---his translator---who effortlessly turned Mandarin into flawless
classical Arabic. My dinner companions, a mix of American grad students,
Egyptians, and Egyptian-Americans, were blown away at the translator's
skills. After all, few Americans could accomplish a similar feat. We
then resumed celebrating the Year of the Rabbit. Looking back, the young
Chinese woman's beautiful Arabic symbolized Beijing's long term
investment in building China's regional role. The country's leaders at
the time understood that at some point they would want a greater voice
in the region. Back in the late 1990s, this idea seemed plausible, but
well over the horizon. When China came up in conversation, Egyptian
officials would often declare, "China is not a replacement for the
United States." Then they would wait two long beats and with add with a
smirk, "Yet." Have we now arrived at that moment? [On July 10, China's
President Xi Jinping opened the Eighth Ministerial Meeting of the
China-Arab Cooperation Forum with a lengthy and rousing speech about
collaboration, cooperation, and "win-win" solutions for Beijing and the
Arab world. A few weeks later he flew to Abu Dhabi for a three day state
visit to the United Arab Emirates, the first by a Chinese leaders in
almost three decades, and signed a raft of mostly economic agreements.
The conference and Xi's trip come at a time when there is a lot of
interest in the Middle East and beyond in President Xi's Belt and Road
Initiative---an amorphous plan to put China at the center of global
governance and in the process reverse the flow of goods, services, and
ideas that have made the West paramount over the last few
centuries.]{.underline} If you are an economic determinist, the Chinese
have indeed become players in the Middle East. **[But broaden the scope
of analysis and Chinese's grand plans haven't moved much beyond the
beautiful-Arabic stage.]{.underline}** No doubt China's economic
state-craft is real and has the potential to be profoundly consequential
for the Middle East. In his July speech before about 300 attendees
---including at least one Arab head of state and a handful of Middle
Eastern foreign ministers---in Beijing, Xi committed \$20 billion worth
of loans to the region, an additional almost 90 million in aid to Syria,
Yemen, Jordan, and Lebanon for reconstruction and care for displaced
people, and another billion dollars to the Arab world toward building
"social stability." This comes on top of major Chinese investment in
Egypt, Saudi Arabia, and the UAE, where about 60 percent of China's
exports are re-exported Africa, the Middle East, and Europe. China has
also targeted non-Arab Turkey and Saudi Arabia as central pieces to the
Belt and Road that will provide access to the Mediterranean and Persian
Gulf, respectively. There has been some backlash to the Chinese in
Southeast Asia and Africa about a 'new colonialism,' but less so in the
Arab world and certainly not among officials there. In the early and
mid-2000s, Egyptian diplomats would get misty eyed when talking about
China. This wasn't surprising. The Chinese Communist Party had solved a
riddle that had proven beyond the apparatchiks of Egypt's National
Democratic Party---how to generate long term economic growth without
upending social cohesion and maintaining the power of the party. More
recently, a senior official from a Gulf country noted that Washington's
political polarization made it an unreliable and even risky partner in
the Arab world's quest for economic development and declared, "If you
sat where we sit, you too would base your economic future on partnership
with China." The Chinese can bring a lot of resources to bear for what
they call "win-win" cooperation in the Middle East. The new ports,
airports, logistics "hubs," and economic zones that are being planned or
are under construction stand to benefit these countries (unless they are
saddled with huge debt like a number of Beijing's client states in
Africa) while China gets to enjoy the benefits of new infrastructure and
the copious energy resources of the region that will facilitate its
continued development. [Yet to infer, as a fair of amount of reporting
and analysis suggests, that China's financial investment in the Middle
East means that Beijing will become a geo-strategic player in the region
may be getting out ahead of even the Chinese. Of course, there is
historical precedent for this evolution]{.underline}: The British
occupation of Egypt came about in part to collect Khedive Ismail's debts
to European banks. Still, the Chinese seem more interested in
opportunistic mercantilism than becoming a problem solver and provider
of regional security[. A close look at Xi's July speech or China's 2016
policy statement on the Middle East reveals a detailed discussion of
economic statecraft, but the barest minimum of boilerplate on politics,
diplomacy, and security in the region. Reflecting these official

given China's dependence on Middle Eastern hydrocarbons, it will have to

to Moscow or taken it upon themselves to secure their interest in Syria
and Yemen. Contrary to the often breathless commentary about China as a
rising power in the Arab world, Beijing's minimalist approach to the
dramas and traumas of the Middle East in favor of economics issues is
shrewd in terms of China's broader ambitions. A day after the United
States launched 59 cruise missiles at Syria, while Presidents Trump and
Xi were enjoying chocolate cake at Mar a Largo, I called a friend in
Beijing to get a sense of the Chinese reaction. He laughed and told me
that no one in the Chinese capital was impressed with the American
display of 1980s-era technology. "Besides," he said, "anything that
keeps the United States bogged down in the crises of the Middle East is
good for China. It's less resources Washington can spend on the South
China Sea." That makes sense---and it's time the rest of the world
realizes it.

#### China Won't Fill Sales Gap

US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo meets Saudi Foreign Minister Adel
al-Jubeir in Riyadh on Tuesday over the disappearance and alleged
slaying of Jamal Khashoggi[. China may continue to engage more with
Saudi]{.underline} Arabia if Washington imposes sanctions over the
disappearance and presumed murder of Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi,
[but it cannot supplant US arms sales]{.underline} as President Donald
Trump believes, [analysts say.]{.underline} US Secretary of State Mike
Pompeo arrived in Saudi Arabia on Tuesday as Washington weighs actions
against Riyadh over the fate of Khashoggi, a US resident and vocal
critic of the Saudi regime who vanished two weeks ago. But [Trump has
been reluctant to support sanctions,]{.underline} citing the impact to a
US\$110 billion arms deal he helped broker last year. "I don't like the
concept of stopping an investment of US\$110 billion into the United
States because you know what they're going to do?" [Trump told reporters
last week. "They're going to take that money and spend it in Russia or
China or someplace else]{.underline}." Saudi Arabia has long sought to
diversify away from its reliance on the US and has increasingly stepped
up its engagement with China, its largest trading partner with US\$42.36
billion in bilateral trade in 2017. Last March, the two countries also
signed US\$65 billion worth of deals in areas ranging from energy to
space technology. The Arab nation could turn to countries such as China
and Russia to help fulfil its military needs if US sanctions were
imposed, a step that would "create an economic disaster that would rock
the entire world", according to a widely cited opinion piece by the
general manager of the Saudi-owned Al Arabiya news channel. In the
editorial, Turki Aldakhil said Saudi Arabia -- the world's largest oil
exporter -- was considering more than 30 countermeasures to be taken
against the US, including trading oil in yuan instead of the US dollar.
[But]{.underline} in the military realm, [China's arms exports to Saudi
Arabia lag far behind those of the US and its European
allies.]{.underline} [Beijing exported only around US\$20 million in
arms last year compared to US\$3.4 billion from Washington]{.underline},
according to data from the Stockholm International Peace Research
Institute, a Swedish think tank. Jonathan Fulton, assistant professor of
political science at Zayed University in Abu Dhabi, said China had grown
more serious in its regional arms relationships with Gulf states in
recent years, with the potential to serve as a "wedge" as US-Saudi
relations frayed. Along with Riyadh's previous indications that it was
willing to consider funding in yuan, increased arms sales would be a
"natural progression" of their relationship, he said. "Part of the
reason why \[Saudi Arabia\] is diversifying is there's been so many
kinds of structural changes in the relationship with the US," Fulton
said. "Another important part is just obviously the commercial
relationship and economic relationship between these Gulf states and
China, with these energy exports. We're seeing a lot more engagement
both ways." But as evidence piles up that Saudi Arabia ordered
Khashoggi's assassination, which the government denies, the backlash is
getting louder. A bipartisan group of US senators have pressured Trump
to enact sanctions and key corporate sponsors have pulled out of the
high-profile "Davos in the Desert" investment forum to be held in Riyadh
this month. "I would expect to see some kind of ... Saudi-led way to
ease the tensions between the US and Riyadh because I don't think they
can afford to let the US relationship deteriorate," Fulton said. Simone
van Nieuwenhuizen, an Australia-based researcher of China-Middle East
relations at the University of Technology Sydney, said China would be
"extremely unlikely" to follow US sanctions if they were levelled
against Saudi Arabia, but may not necessarily increase trade with the
country either. "I think China is likely to keep a low profile on this
issue and see how it plays out before directly addressing it," she said.
"While its technology is developing, China still lags behind the US in
the sophistication and capability of its military equipment. It simply
can't fill the gap." Robert Mason, director of the Middle East Studies
Centre at the American University in Cairo, said China would not want to
get involved at this stage to avoid further tensions with the Trump
administration. "I'm sure China will be interested to expand relations
if and when US-Saudi ties deteriorate. However, Saudi policy looks set
to shift to admitting to the accidental killing of Jamal Khashoggi
inside its consulate in Istanbul, and I'm sure they will try to
de-escalate during Secretary Pompeo's visit," he said. "It is unlikely
the US will change a decades-old policy favouring close economic and
security ties with the Kingdom, including considerable counterterrorism
cooperation and the containment of Iran, over this one incident." Sun
Degang, a Middle East expert at Shanghai International Studies
University, said that if the US and Saudi Arabia were to part ways, it
would be possible for China to develop deeper economies ties with the
Arab nation, including using the yuan to trade oil. "But from what we
see now, US-Saudi tensions have remained at a diplomatic level and
haven't deteriorated at a fundamental level," he said.

On January 18, Chinese Ambassador to Saudi Arabia Li Huaxin praised
Saudi Arabia's Vision 2030 project and called for tighter integration
between Saudi Arabia's economic diversification efforts and the Belt and
Road Initiative (BRI). Li also expressed enthusiastic support for Saudi
Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman's anti-corruption campaign, claiming
that his efforts to strengthen the rule of law in Saudi Arabia would
increase the country's attractiveness as an investment destination for
Chinese businesses. While Li's praise for Saudi Arabia's economic
reforms suggests that the Beijing-Riyadh partnership is on firm footing,
growing concerns in the United States about the implications of Chinese
investments for the Washington-Riyadh alliance and uncertainties
surrounding the nature of the Saudi privatization process could limit
the scope of China-Saudi Arabia economic cooperation. These factors
could cause Beijing to eventually pivot more firmly toward Riyadh's
regional rivals, Iran and Qatar. Even though Washington did not react
strongly to China's emergence as Saudi Arabia's largest trade partner in
2010, many U.S. policymakers are concerned that China will make Saudi
Arabia an unwitting pawn in its efforts to erode U.S. hegemony over
global financial markets. These concerns have risen sharply since Saudi
Arabia's Vice Minister of Economy and Planning Mohammed al-Tuwaijri
announced on August 24 that Saudi Arabia planned to partially cover its
budget deficit in Chinese yuan to reduce its financial dependency on the
U.S. dollar. Many American economists have expressed alarm at Saudi
Arabia's willingness to borrow in Chinese yuan, as Riyadh's decision
could cause other oil-exporting countries to abandon the U.S. dollar in
favor of the "petro-yuan." A marked decline in the use of the U.S.
dollar as the preferred credit-issuing currency by oil-producing
countries would greatly weaken the U.S. dollar's long-term viability as
a global reserve currency. [As the United States views its alliance with
Saudi Arabia as the lynchpin of its Middle East strategy, Washington
will likely react strongly if Riyadh uses its influence within OPEC to
strengthen the Chinese yuan. As Saudi Arabia remains dependent on U.S.
arms sales to pursue its geopolitical objectives in the Middle East and
counter Iran, intense U.S. pressure would likely cause Riyadh to
distance itself from Beijing, limiting economic integration between the
two countries. In addition to setting informal limits on the scope and
nature of Saudi Arabia's economic partnership with China, Riyadh's
dependence on U.S. military equipment restricts its ability to purchase
large quantities of Chinese arms. Historically, Saudi Arabia has only
purchased arms from China to pressure the United States into selling
Riyadh highly sophisticated weaponry. Saudi Arabia's purchases of DF-3
missiles from China in 1987, and current procurements of Chinese stealth
weaponry for military use in Yemen, exemplify its tactical approach to
arms deals with Beijing. As U.S.-Saudi Arabia relations have improved
considerably under Donald Trump, the need for Saudi Arabia to purchase
arms from China will likely decrease in the years to come.]{.underline}
As Qatar has been able to covertly purchase Chinese SY-400 missiles with
little U.S. scrutiny, and China has a long-standing defense partnership
with Iran, the Chinese government is likely to forge stronger defense
links with Saudi Arabia's chief rivals, straining the Beijing-Riyadh
partnership. [Even though Saudi Arabia has historically been able to
cooperate with China in the nuclear energy sphere without U.S.
criticism, the Trump administration's depiction of China as an adversary
in its 2018 National Security Strategy will increase U.S. government
scrutiny over nuclear cooperation deals signed between Beijing and
U.S.-allied countries.]{.underline} As U.S. Secretary of Energy Rick
Perry has held negotiations with Saudi Arabia on a nuclear agreement, a
hawkish tilt in Washington's China policy could convert these
discussions into a nuclear deal. The ratification of Perry's proposed
agreement would greatly expand the United States' leverage over Riyadh's
nuclear policy and dilute the impact of China's \$2.43 billion nuclear
manufacturing equipment investment pledge.

Canal. Even so, [Chinese corporations---with full backing from
Beijing---are **investing tens of billions of dollars in infrastructure
projects, acquisitions, and other initiatives** in most countries of the
Middle East.]{.underline} The main issue for China these days is the
trade war with the United States. Underneath the party line of "hitting
back" at American pressure lies a growing concern that escalating
tariffs will seriously damage the global economy, which could in turn
harm China's GDP and domestic stability. Officials in Beijing are also
closely monitoring attempts by other Asian powers to contain China's
rapid rise, especially as Washington and other players cultivate the
Indo-Pacific system of cooperation first proposed by Japan. Against this
backdrop, [China measures its influence and presence in the Middle East
mainly in terms of securing energy supplies, trade ties, and business
benefits. Beijing is comfortable with its current policy of **avoiding
political involvement** in the region's myriad disputes, and any
isolated statements that run contrary to this
posture]{.underline}---such as an ambassador's 2018 claim that his
government would consider helping the Syrian regime fight rebels in
Idlib---are abruptly dismissed. China likewise steers clear of taking
sides in the Iran-Saudi Arabia showdown or intra-Arab disputes such as
the Qatar embargo, preferring to deal with the Arab League as its main
address for dialogue. This includes consistently supporting the league's
positions on the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. One of China's voting
habits at the UN is to back all anti-Israel resolutions. Beijing is
fully aware that Gulf governments are quietly pursuing cooperation with
the Israeli government on several fronts, but as long as their formal
public stance remains frosty, China will keep voting accordingly.

#### No US-China war -- intervening actors

[The Soviet Union was an expansionist power. Its objective was to spread
its communist system of political economy throughout the
globe.]{.underline} It was truly a strategic competitor to the U.S.
everywhere. [The Soviet Union, of course, imploded. Both Russia and
China want to increase their influence in their region, while reducing
that of the United States. But they are regional competitors, not global
ones. And arguably not even that.]{.underline} It\'s hard to describe
Russia\'s political economy. Crony capitalism, or kleptomaniac
capitalism, comes the closest. In any event, it\'s not a political
economy other countries will be tempted to emulate. Russia\'s GDP per
capita is less than a third that of the European Union. It\'s in the
midst of a demographic meltdown that its export-driven resource economy
is ill-suited to handle. Things aren\'t going to get better. [At one
point, China\'s state capitalism was considered a potential alternative
for other developing countries. But that view has dimmed.]{.underline}
In reality, other countries have rapidly developed through the creation
of a state-driven export economy featuring manufactured goods. But
taking the next step, to a higher-producing consumer-driven economy, is
incompatible with state control and authoritarian rule. [China\'s GDP
per capita is a fourth that of Japan\'s. Without changes that shake the
foundations of China\'s system]{.underline} [of political economy,
bridging that gap is likely to stall. Other countries are more
capable]{.underline} This illustrates another fundamental difference
from the Cold War. [After World War II, there was no one able to thwart
the Soviet Union\'s expansionism except the U.S.]{.underline} Today,
Europe has a population nearly four times larger than Russia\'s and an
economy 10 times bigger. Britain and France have sufficient nuclear
weapons to serve as a deterrent, even without the U.S. nuclear umbrella.
[China is so big that the regional capitalist democracies ---
principally Japan, South Korea and Australia --- don\'t overwhelm it.
But they have enough resources to protect their own. The U.S. shouldn\'t
be blind to the character of the Russian and Chinese regimes or their
ambitions. But we also shouldn\'t overestimate the extent to which they
pose a threat to us, or underestimate the extent to which closer
neighbors can contain and manage them]{.underline}

#### China wants to avoid any military conflict

First, [China is pursuing hegemony in East Asia, but not an exclusive
hostile hegemony]{.underline}. It is not trying to extrude the United
States from the region or deny American access there. The Chinese have
long recognized the utility---and the benefits to China itself---of U.S.
engagement with the region, and they have indicated receptivity to
peaceful coexistence and overlapping spheres of influence with the
United States there. Moreover, [China is not trying to impose its
political or economic system on its neighbors, and it does not seek to
obstruct commercial freedom of navigation in the region]{.underline}
(because no country is more dependent on freedom of the seas than China
itself). In short, [Beijing wants to extend its power and
influence]{.underline} within East Asia, [but not as part of a
"winner-take-all" contest]{.underline}. [China does have unsettled and
vexing sovereignty claims]{.underline} over Taiwan, most of the islands
and other features in the East and South China Seas, and their adjacent
waters. [Although Beijing has demonstrated a willingness to use force in
defense or pursuit of these claims, it is not looking for excuses to do
so]{.underline}. [Whether these disputes can be managed or
resolved]{.underline} in a way that is mutually acceptable to the
relevant parties and consistent with U.S. interests in the region [is an
open, long-term question]{.underline}. [But that possibility should not
be ruled out on the basis of]{.underline}---or made more difficult
by---[false assumptions of irreconcilable interests]{.underline}. On the
contrary, [it should be pursued on the basis of a recognition that **all
the parties want to avoid conflict**]{.underline}---and that the
[**sovereignty disputes** in the region ultimately **are not military
problems requiring military solutions.**]{.underline} Of course, China
would prefer not to have forward-deployed U.S. military forces in the
Western Pacific that could be used against it, but [Beijing has long
tolerated and arguably could indefinitely tolerate an American military
presence in the region]{.underline}---unless that presence is clearly
and exclusively aimed at coercing or containing China. It is also true
that [Beijing disagrees with American principles of military
freedom]{.underline} of navigation in the region; and this constitutes a
significant challenge in waters where China claims territorial
jurisdiction in violation of the UN Commission on the Law of the Sea.
[But this should not be conflated with a Chinese desire or intention to
exclusively "control" all the waters within the first island chain in
the Western Pacific]{.underline}. [The Chinese almost certainly
recognize that exclusive control or "domination"]{.underline} of the
neighborhood [is not achievable at any reasonable cost]{.underline}, and
that [pursuing it would be counterproductive by inviting pushback and
challenges that would negate the objective]{.underline}. So [what would
Chinese "hegemony" in East Asia mean or look like]{.underline}? Beijing
probably thinks in terms of something much like American primacy in the
Western Hemisphere: [a model in which China is generally recognized and
acknowledged as the de facto central or primary power in the region, but
has little need or incentive for militarily adventurism]{.underline}
because the mutual benefits of economic interdependence prevail and [the
neighbors have no reason]{.underline}---and inherent disincentives---[to
challenge China's vital interests or security]{.underline}. And as a
parallel to China's economic and diplomatic engagement in Latin America,
Beijing would neither exclude nor be hostile to continued U.S.
engagement in East Asia. [A standard counterargument to this relatively
benign scenario is that Beijing would not be content with it for
long]{.underline} because China's strategic ambitions will expand as its
capabilities grow. [This is a valid hypothesis, but it usually overlooks
the greater possibility that China's external ambitions will expand not
because its inherent capabilities have grown, but because Beijing sees
the need to be more assertive in response to external challenges to
Chinese interests or security]{.underline}. Indeed, much of China's
"assertiveness" within East Asia over the past decade---when Beijing
probably would prefer to focus on domestic priorities---has been a
reaction to such perceived challenges. Accordingly, [Beijing's
willingness to settle for a narrowly-defined, peaceable version of
regional preeminence will depend heavily on whether it perceives other
countries]{.underline}---especially the United States---[as trying to
deny China this option and instead obstruct Chinese interests or
security in the region]{.underline}.

### Not a Threat

#### China is not a revisionist power or dangerous

What kind of world order will this bring? [Contrary to what more
alarmist voices have suggested, a bipolar U.S.-Chinese world will not be
a world on the brink of apocalyptic war.]{.underline} This is in large
part because [China's ambitions for the coming years are much narrower
than many in the Western foreign policy establishment tend to
assume]{.underline}. Rather than unseating the United States as the
world's premier superpower, [Chinese foreign policy in the coming decade
will largely focus on maintaining the conditions necessary for the
country's continued economic growth]{.underline}---[a focus that will
likely push leaders in Beijing to steer clear of open confrontation with
the United States or its primary allies]{.underline}. Instead, the
coming bipolarity will be an era of uneasy peace between the two
superpowers. [Both sides will build up their militaries but remain
careful to manage tensions before they boil over into outright
conflict]{.underline}. And [rather than vie for global supremacy through
opposing alliances, Beijing and Washington will largely carry out their
competition in the economic and technological realms]{.underline}. At
the same time, U.S.-Chinese bipolarity will likely spell the end of
sustained multilateralism outside strictly economic realms, as the
combination of nationalist populism in the West and [China's commitment
to national sovereignty will leave little space for the kind of
political integration and norm setting that was once the hallmark of
liberal internationalism. At the top of Beijing's priorities is a
liberal economic order built on free trade]{.underline}. China's
economic transformation over the past decades from an agricultural
society to a major global powerhouse---and the world's second-largest
economy---was built on exports. The country has slowly worked its way up
the value chain, its exports beginning to compete with those of highly
advanced economies. Now as then, these exports are the lifeblood of the
Chinese economy: they ensure a consistent trade surplus, and the jobs
they create are a vital engine of domestic social stability. [There is
no indication that this will change in the coming decade]{.underline}.
Even amid escalating trade tensions between Beijing and Washington,
China's overall export volume continued to grow in 2018. [U.S. tariffs
may sting, but they will neither change Beijing's fundamental incentives
nor portend a general turn away from global free trade on its
part]{.underline}. Given this enthusiasm for the global economy, [the
image of a revisionist China that has gained traction in many Western
capitals is misleading]{.underline}. Beijing relies on a global network
of trade ties, so it is loath to court direct confrontation with the
United States. [Chinese leaders fear]{.underline}---not without
reason---[that such a confrontation might cut off its access to U.S.
markets and lead U.S. allies to band together against China rather than
stay neutral, stripping it of important economic partnerships and
valuable diplomatic connections]{.underline}. As a result, [caution, not
assertiveness or aggressiveness, will be the order of the day in
Beijing's foreign policy in the coming years]{.underline}. Even as it
continues to modernize and expand its military, [China will carefully
avoid pressing issues that might lead to war with the United
States]{.underline}, such as those related to the South China Sea,
cybersecurity, and the weaponization of space.

### Impact Turn -- Stability 

#### Chinese intervention in the Middle East creates stability and will lead to regional support

EEC\]

China has had an active presence in the Middle East for the past two
decades. Historically however, China's presence in the Middle East has
been primarily "soft," implementing humanitarian aid, infrastructure
projects, and since 2013, economic development enterprises, to fulfill
the One Belt One Road initiative. In the past three years however,
[China's approach to the Middle East has shifted, and the country seems
intent on having a military footprint in the Middle East.]{.underline}
[This shift in Chinese foreign policy towards the Middle East might have
a stabilizing effect on the Middle East]{.underline}, and in turn might
symbolize another step towards the decline in the United States
hegemony. In 2016, China provided military assistance to Syria in
addition to humanitarian aid. There are currently approximately 1,000
Chinese troops in Southern Lebanon carrying out a peacekeeping mission
between Hezbollah and Israeli forces. And it was reported by
AviationWeek.com on October 24th, 2017, that the United States'
reluctance towards providing unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) to
particular Middle Eastern countries has led to big win for Chinese
manufacturers in the region. [This shift towards a more military-heavy
approach in the Middle East should pay China some
dividends.]{.underline} This shift can also be observed in the
orientation of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization (SCO) towards
particular issues. While in the past the SCO has primarily been a
multilateral economic entity, today the organization seems to be
pivoting towards a having larger scope, especially in the Middle East.
After the Arab Spring, and especially with the advent of the Islamic
State, issues of peacekeeping, access to resources, and
counter-terrorism have become larger matters on the organization's
radar. The SCO will look to increase its political clout in the Middle
East as it navigates the entry of Iran into its ranks with the GCC. As
part of their military shift, China has also identified a critical
window of opportunity[. The United States has had its hand in the Middle
East for a number of years, and has failed to gain any semblance of
control or stability in the region]{.underline}. In fact, [the United
States can be seen as a cause for much of the instability in the Middle
East today]{.underline}. The United States' sanctions on Iran through
the 2015 Iran Nuclear Deal pushed the country towards China, whose
economic support helped to offset the sanctions of the US. Furthermore,
as of 2015, [China was the second-largest oil consumer in the world only
behind the United States, making countries like Iran and Saudi Arabia
attractive targets as allies.]{.underline} The SCO has lined up Iran and
Turkey as potential members, and it increases its ability to combat
similar entities like NATO. Finally, American's reluctance to use Iraqi
oil after the invasion of 2003 led to the positive relationship between
China and Iraq with respect to natural resources that still exists
today. [If China is able to match their economic support with military
might and commitment, their hold in the region will be substantial,
long-lasting, **and stabilizing as well**.]{.underline} China has also
committed incredible economic vigor to the Middle East. On October 19th,
2017, it was reported that [China had written off \$100 million of debt
that Yemen was bearing, as cholera and the civil war posed economic
strains on the country]{.underline}. The Middle East Monitor reported in
September that China had sent \$46 million to Egypt to help modernize
its public transportation system. Furthermore, China plans to increase
its trade with Iran by \$600 billion over the next 10 years. [China has
taken the approach that establishing strong economic and cultural ties
with Middle Eastern countries, and following that up with military
force, can be a very effective method to creating healthy relationships
in the region]{.underline}. Finally, at the 19th National Congress of
the Communist Party of China earlier this month, Xi Jinping stressed the
importance of China's growing role on the world stage in a notably long
speech. In his address at the event, Xi Jinping touched on the
relationship between Chinese expansion and increasing China's capacity
for national security endeavors. Xi Jinping's One Belt One Road
initiative as well as the SCO and other multilateral organizations that
China is a part of will be working towards this end in the foreseeable
future as well. [As terrorism continues to ravage the Middle East,
China's influence in the region will continue to increase.]{.underline}
The SCO will become a greater counter-terrorism force as more countries
opt to join the organization. [China will increase their military
presence in the region, showing commitment and intent for long-lasting
control]{.underline}. And this is no surprise. Since the Comprehensive
Test Ban Treaty in 1996, China has been aligned with Iran, Egypt, and
other Middle Eastern countries. The Middle East has long been an arena
for the United States and Russia to inject their own predilections into
the region. The advent of Chinese power, and arrival of the SCO as a
real economic and political force, will provide stability to the Middle
East and will challenge NATO and the United States hegemony. [China is
ready to disrupt the status quo bias that exists in the Middle East and
it may very well be what is needed in the region.]{.underline}

#### Saudi Arabia influence over the US causes regional war with Iran

It's another Trump affair --- this time without the allegations of
sexual harassment (and worse), the charges and counter-charges, the
lawsuits, and all the rest. So it hasn't gotten the sort of headlines
that Stormy Daniels has garnered, but when it comes to influence,
American foreign policy, and issues of peace and war, it couldn't matter
more or be a bigger story (or have more money or lobbyists involved in
it). Think of it as the great love affair of the age of Trump, the one
between The Donald and the Saudi royals. And if there's any place to
start laying out the story, it's naturally at a wedding, in this case in
a tragic ceremony that happened to take place in Yemen, not Washington.
On Sunday, April 22nd, planes from a Saudi Arabian-led coalition dropped
two bombs on a wedding in Yemen. The groom was injured, the bride
killed, along with at least 32 other civilians, many of them children.
In response, the Saudis didn't admit fault or express condolences to the
victim's families. Instead, they emphasized that their "coalition
continues to take all the precautionary and preventative measures" to
avoid civilian casualties in Yemen. [This disconnect between Saudi
rhetoric and the realities on the ground isn't an anomaly --- it's been
the norm. For four years, the Saudis and their allies have been
conducting airstrikes with reckless abandon there, contributing to a
staggering civilian death toll that now reportedly tops 10,000. The
Saudis and their close ally, the United Arab Emirates (UAE), have
repeatedly reassured American policymakers that they're doing everything
imaginable to prevent civilian casualties, only to launch yet more
airstrikes against civilian targets, including schools, hospitals,
funerals, and marketplaces. For example, last May when Donald Trump
landed in Saudi Arabia on his first overseas visit as president, Saudi
lobbyists distributed a "fact sheet" about the prodigious efforts of the
country's military to reduce civilian casualties in Yemen. Five days
after Trump landed in Riyadh, however, an air strike killed 24 civilians
at a Yemeni market. In December, such strikes killed more than 100
Yemeni civilians in 10 days.]{.underline} The Saudi response: condemning
the United Nations for its criticisms of such attacks and then offering
yet more empty promises. [Through all of this, President Trump has
remained steadfast in his support, while the U.S. military continues to
provide aerial refueling for Saudi air strikes as well as the bombs used
to kill so many of those civilians. But why? In a word: Saudi Arabian
and UAE money in prodigious amounts flowing into Trump's world --- to
U.S. arms makers and to dozens of lobbyists, public-relations firms, and
influential think tanks in Washington]{.underline}. Trump's Love Affair
with the Saudi Regime Saudi Arabia's influence over Donald Trump hit an
initial peak in his first presidential visit abroad, which began in
Riyadh in May 2017. The Saudi royals, who had clearly grasped the nature
of The Donald, offered him the one thing he seems to love most:
flattery, flattery, and more flattery. The kingdom rolled out the red
carpet big time. The fanfare included posting banners with photos of
President Trump and Saudi King Salman along the roadside from the
airport to Riyadh, projecting a five-story-high image of Trump onto the
side of the hotel where he would stay, and hosting a male-invitees-only
concert by country singer Toby Keith. According to the Washington Post,
"The Saudis hosted the Trumps and the Kushners at the family's royal
palace, ferried them around in golf carts, and celebrated Trump with a
multimillion-dollar gala in his honor, complete with a throne-like seat
for the president." In addition, they presented him with the Abdul-Aziz
al-Saud medal, a trinket named for Saudi Arabia's first king, considered
the highest honor the kingdom can bestow on a foreign leader. The Saudis
then gave Trump something he undoubtedly valued even more than all the
fawning --- a chance to pose as the world's greatest deal maker. For the
trip, Trump brought along a striking collection of CEOs from major
American companies, including Marillyn Hewson of Lockheed Martin, Jamie
Dimon of JPMorgan Chase, and Stephen Schwarzman of the Blackstone Group.
[Big numbers on the potential value of future U.S.-Saudi business deals
were tossed around, including \$110 billion in arms sales and hundreds
of billions more in investments in energy, petrochemicals, and
infrastructure, involving projects in both countries]{.underline}. The
new president was anything but shy in claiming credit for such potential
mega-deals. [At a press conference, he crowed about "tremendous
investments in the United States... and jobs, jobs, jobs." On his return
to the U.S., he promptly bragged at a cabinet meeting that his
deal-making would "bring many thousands of jobs to our country... In
fact, will bring millions of jobs ultimately."]{.underline} Not
surprisingly, no analysis was offered to back up such claims, but it's
already clear that some of these deals may never come to fruition and
many ofthose that do are more likely to create jobs in Saudi Arabia than
in the United States. Still, President Trump's love affair with that
country's royals only intensified, leading to a triumphant U.S. visit
last month by Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, the power behind
the throne in that nation. He is also the architect of its brutal Yemeni
war, where, in addition to those thousands of civilians killed thanks to
indiscriminate air strikes, millions have been put at risk of famine due
to a Saudi-led blockade of the country. But neither of these activities
that, Democratic Congressman Ted Lieu has noted, "look like war crimes"
nor Saudi Arabia's abysmal internal human rights record drew a
discouraging word from Trump or anyone in his cabinet. First things
first. There were business deals to be touted --- and so they were.
Mohammed bin Salman's visit to the White House took place on the very
day that the Senate was considering a bill to end U.S. support for Saudi
Arabia's Yemeni bombing campaign. While senators debated the
constitutional authority of Congress to declare war and the human-rights
impact of U.S. support for the Saudi war effort, Trump was boasting yet
again about all those jobs that arms sales to Saudi Arabia would create,
adding --- in a sign of the total success of the Saudi charm offensive
--- that the relationship between the two countries "is now probably as
good as it's really ever been" and "will probably only get better." The
centerpiece of Trump's meeting was a show-and-tell performance focused
on how Saudi arms sales would boost American jobs. As he sang the
praises of those Saudi purchases, he brandished a map of the United
States with the legend "KSA \[Kingdom of Saudi Arabia\] Deals Pending"
above a red oval that said "40,000 U.S. jobs." Prominent among them were
jobs in the swing states that put Trump over the top in the 2016
elections: Pennsylvania, Ohio, Michigan, and Florida. Score another
point for Saudi influence in the form of Trump's firm belief that his
relationship with that regime will bolster his future political
prospects. So the public courtship of Trump by the Saudi royals is
already paying large dividends, but public flattery and massive arms
deals are just the better-known part of the picture. The president has
been heavily courted privately as well, both through personal
connections and through an expansive lobbying operation, which it's
important to map out, even if there's no administration show-and-tell on
the subject. The Personal Courtship As a start --- as has been widely
publicized --- Jared Kushner, the president's son-in-law and officially
anointed point man on Middle Eastern peace (an outcome he is uniquely
ill-equipped to deliver), has struck up a beautiful friendship with
Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman. Their relationship was
solidified at a March 2017 lunch at the White House, followed by
numerous phone calls and several Kushner visits to Saudi Arabia,
including one shortly before the prince cracked down on his domestic
rivals. Though that crackdown was publicly justified as an
anti-corruption move, it conveniently targeted anyone who could
conceivably have stood in the way of bin Salman's consolidation of
power. According to Michael Wolff in Fire and Fury, after bin Salman's
power play, Trump joyfully told Kushner, "We've put our man on top!" ---
an indication that Kushner had offered a Trump stamp of approval to the
prince's political maneuver during his trip to Riyadh. The friendship
has clearly paid off handsomely for the Saudis. Kushner was reportedly
the main advocate for having Trump make his first foreign visit to that
country --- over the objections of Secretary of Defense James Mattis,
who felt it would send the wrong signal to allies about Trump's
attitudes towards democracy and autocracy (as indeed it did). Kushner
also strongly urged Trump to back a Saudi-UAE blockade and propaganda
campaign against the Gulf state of Qatar, which Trump forcefully did
with a tweet: "So good to see the Saudi Arabia visit with the King and
50 countries already paying off. They said they would take a hard line
on funding extremism and all reference was pointing to Qatar. Perhaps
this will be the beginning of the end to horror of terrorism!" Trump
later changed his mind on this issue --- after learning that Qatar hosts
the largest U.S. military air base in the Middle East and after Qatar
launched a PR and lobbying offensive of its own. That small,
ultra-wealthy state hired nine lobbying and public relations firms,
including former Attorney General John Ashcroft's, in the two months
after the Saudi-UAE blockade began, according to filings under the
Foreign Agents Registration Act. [Most notably, the Qataris agreed to
spend \$12 billion on U.S. combat aircraft just weeks after Trump's
tweet]{.underline}. Wherever Trump ultimately ends up on the campaign
against Qatar (driven in part by a Saudi belief that its emir hasn't
sufficiently toed a tough enough line on Iran), Kushner's role in the
affair gives new spin to the old phrase "The personal is the political."
According to a source who spoke toveteran reporter Dexter Filkins,
Kushner's antipathy toward Qatar may have been driven in part by anger
over its unwillingness to bail his father out of a bad Manhattan real
estate investment with a massive loan. Another snapshot of the Saudi-UAE
urge to get up close and personal with The Donald lies in the strange
case of George Nader, a political operative and senior advisor to the
UAE, and Elliott Broidy, who reportedly can get face time with President
Trump as needed. Nader evidently successfully persuaded Broidy to
privately press Trump to take positions ever more in line with Saudi and
UAE interests on Qatar and in their urge to see Secretary of State Rex
Tillerson head for the exit. Whether or not Broidy's appeals were
instrumental in Trump's decisions, he can't be faulted for lack of
effort. [His exploits underscore how far both countries are willing to
go in their efforts to bend U.S. foreign policy to their needs and
interests.]{.underline} In his campaign to win over Broidy, Nader gave
him a cool \$2.7 million to fund an anti-Qatar conference sponsored by
the Foundation for Defense of Democracies, a sum that was also followed
bymore than \$600,000 in donations for Republican candidates. The
keynote speaker at that conference was House Foreign Affairs Committee
Chairman Ed Royce, who then crafted a sanctions bill against Qatar and
--- miracle of miracles --- shortly thereafter received a campaign
contribution from Broidy. Wherever those funds came from, it strains
credulity to believe that this was all coincidental. To sweeten the
deal, Nader also dangled the prospect of major contracts for Broidy's
private security firm, Circinus. One deal with the UAE, for \$200
million, has already been sealed, while a Saudi one is in the works. At
this point, who knows whether any of this was illegal, but in the world
of Washington influence peddling, what's legal is often as scandalous as
what's not. The Lobbying Courtship If such deep connections between
Saudi Arabia and the Trump administration sometimes seem to surface out
of nowhere, they all too often stem from an extraordinarily influential,
if largely unpublicized, Saudi lobbying and public relations campaign.
Following the November election, the Saudis wasted no time in adding
more firepower to their already robust influence operation in this
country. In the less than three months before Trump was sworn in as
president in January 2017, the Saudis inked contracts with three new
firms: a Republican-oriented one, the McKeon Group (whose namesake,
Howard "Buck" McKeon, is the recently retired chairman of the House
Armed Services Committee); the CGCN Group, a firm well connected to
conservative Republicans whose clientele also includes Boeing, which
sells bombs to Saudi Arabia; and an outfit associated with the
Democrats, the Podesta Group, which later dissolved after revelations
about its work with Paul Manafort, Trump's former campaign manager, and
Russian banks under sanction. Before Trump even made it to Riyadh that
May, according to an analysis of Foreign Agents Registration Act
records, the Saudis signed contracts with six more public relations
firms and then added two more immediately after severing diplomatic ties
with Qatar in early June. All told, in just the first year of the Trump
administration, the Saudis spent more than a million dollars monthly on
more than two dozen registered lobbying and public relations outfits.
The UAE was not far behind, boasting 18 registered lobbying and public
relations firms in 2017, including more than \$10 million dollars that
year alone that went to just one of them, the Camstoll Group. All this
lobbying firepower gave those two countries an unparalleled ability to
steer U.S. foreign policy on the Middle East. [Among other avenues of
influence, their campaign included a steady stream of propaganda flowing
to policymakers about the war in Yemen.]{.underline} Large foreign
lobbies of this sort also enjoy an even more direct path to influence
through campaign contributions. [While it's illegal for foreign
nationals to make such contributions in U.S. elections, there's an easy
workaround for that --- just hire lobbyists to do it for
you.]{.underline} Such firms and figures have, in the past, admitted to
serving as middlemen in this fashion and are known to have sometimes
given handsomely. For example, a study by Maplight and the International
Business Times found that registered lobbyists working at just four
firms hired by the Saudis gave more than half a million dollars to
federal candidates in the 2016 elections. [Another important avenue of
influence for the Saudis and Emiratis: their financial contributions to
Washington's think tanks]{.underline}. The full extent of their reach in
this area is hard to grasp because think tanks and other non-profits
aren't required to disclose their donors and many choose not to do so.
However, an eye-opening New York Times exposé in 2014 revealed an
expansive list of think tanks that received money from the Saudis or
Emiratis, including the [Atlantic Council, the Brookings Institution,
the Center for Strategic and International Studies, and the Middle East
Institute.]{.underline} In the age of Trump, it's a reasonable bet that
it has only gotten worse. A War Alliance? There is more at stake in
Washington's present web of ties to those two lands than just business.
[The uncritical embrace of such reckless, extreme, and undemocratic
regimes by President Trump and many members of Congress has far-reaching
implications for the future of American foreign policy in the Middle
East. Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman has asserted that Iranian
leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei "makes Hitler look good" and **has
suggested military action against Iran on a number of
occasions**.]{.underline} Add to this the prince's successful efforts to
keep the Trump administration on board in supporting his war in Yemen,
plus Riyadh's political interference in Qatar and Lebanon, and **[there
is a real danger that Trump's uncritical embrace of the Saudi regime
could spark a regional war]{.underline}**. The indiscriminate killing of
Yemenis by the Saudi coalition, with the help of U.S. weapons, has
already contributed to the world's largest humanitarian crisis, while
reportedly making the al-Qaeda franchise in Yemen "stronger than ever."
There is much concern in official Washington about Trump's seemingly
cavalier attitude towards longstanding U.S. alliances, but in the case
of Saudi Arabia, a major change of course would undoubtedly be
advisable. The least we can do is help make sure that the people of
Yemen don't fear for their lives at their own weddings.

#### American intervention in Saudi Arabia causes an empowered Iran.

**Reisener 2/23**

Matthew Reisener, a program associate at the Center for the National
Interest 2-23-2019, \"America Must Question Ally Actions in Yemen,\"
National Interest,
https://nationalinterest.org/blog/middle-east-watch/america-must-question-ally-actions-yemen-45112

[America's]{.underline} controversial [relationship with Saudi Arabia
was thrust into the spotlight once again in the wake of]{.underline}
Monday night's CNN report that [Saudi Arabia]{.underline} and the United
Arab Emirates, "[have used the US]{.underline}-manufactured [weapons as
a form of currency to buy the loyalties of militias or tribes," in
Yemen, many of which are affiliated with Al Qaeda.]{.underline} CNN
found that U.S.-made weapons have become widely available through the
growing black-market arms trade and that American arms have even fallen
into the hands of Iranian-supported Houthi rebels. If CNN's report is
accurate, then [Saudi Arabia]{.underline} and the UAE [have violated the
terms of their arms agreements with the U]{.underline}nited
[S]{.underline}tates, [which prohibits the transfer of U.S. weapons to
third-parties within Yemen]{.underline}. This report naturally [sparked
outrage on Capitol Hill, where many members have already soured on the
U.S.-Saudi relationship]{.underline} in the wake of Saudi involvement in
the murder of journalist Jamal Khashoggi. On Wednesday, House Democrats
approved H.J.Res.37, a bill that invokes the War Powers Resolution to
end American participation in Yemen's civil war. The House is expected
to approve this resolution, while the Senate approved a similar proposal
last December and could very well do so again. With Congress finally
poised to consider the merits of America's military involvement in
Yemen, the decision of its ostensible allies to transfer American-made
weapons to its enemies should be viewed as the last straw. [The
Saudi-led and U.S.-backed military campaign in support of]{.underline}
beleaguered Yemeni president Abdrabbuh Mansur [Hadi]{.underline} has
[failed to materially improve the conditions on the ground and has
instead contributed to what the UN labeled the world's most dire
humanitarian crisis. America should end its support for the coalition
and condition further arms sales to Saudi Arabia]{.underline} and the
UAE on both countries ceasing their offensive military operations in
Yemen [and aggressively pursuing a negotiated peace]{.underline}
settlement between the warring parties. Saudi Arabia entered the Yemen
conflict in March of 2015 driven by its desire to roll-back the growing
influence of the Houthis (a Zaydi Shia rebel faction supported by the
Iranians) and prevent Tehran from establishing a foothold in Yemen. The
United States, attempting to solidify its relationship with the Saudis
in preparation for its then-pending nuclear deal with [Iran, began
offering intelligence sharing, targeting assistance for munitions, and,
until recently, midair refueling for Saudi warplanes.]{.underline}
America has also conducted its own air strikes and special forces
operations against terrorist groups operating inside Yemen. Saudi Arabia
initially labeled its intervention efforts as "Operation Decisive
Storm," betraying confidence in its ability to quickly dispatch of
anti-government forces. Unfortunately, the Saudi coalition's entry into
the conflict proved anything but decisive. Between January 2016 and
November 2018, the Armed Conflict Location & Event Data (ACLED) Project
recorded 60,223 conflict-related fatalities, a number over six times
larger than the United Nations' original estimate. The violence also
sparked a nation-wide famine. Save the Children estimates that
eighty-five thousand children have died of starvation, while the UN
warns of a nearly unfathomable fourteen million Yemenis who exist on the
brink of starvation. The Saudi coalition, while far from the only cause
of violence, has been a leading driver of the mounting civilian
casualties. The aforementioned ACLED study found that Saudi Arabia and
its allies were responsible for 4,614 civilian deaths since 2016 (over
four times as many casualties as the 1,027 attributed to the Houthis and
their allies), while the Yemen Data Project notes that a substantial
number of Saudi air strikes are directed at nonmilitary targets. [The
Saudi military is responsible for egregious errors such as bombing a
funeral that it mistook for a rebel gathering, and its targeting of
agricultural infrastructure and lengthy blockade of Yemeni ports greatly
contributed to the creeping famine. Ironically, Saudi Arabia's
involvement in the conflict seems to be have strengthened the positions
of the forces it sought to oppose.]{.underline} At an event hosted by
the Center for the National Interest last December, Daniel Byman of the
Brookings Institute argued that [while Iran offered limited support to
the Houthis during the early stages of the conflict, the ties between
the two Shia forces have deepened as a result of Saudi intervention,
strengthening Iran's position on the Arabian Peninsula]{.underline}.
Furthermore[, in addition to benefiting from increased access to
American-made]{.underline} weaponry, terror groups like Al Qaeda [have
capitalized on the chaos brought]{.underline} about by the near-collapse
of the Yemeni state and solidified their foothold in the war-torn
country. The longer the conflict rages and the more American-made bombs
are dropped on civilians, the easier it becomes for groups like the
Houthis and Al Qaeda to recruit new generations of militants into their
ranks. The Saudi campaign has become self-defeating. Ending American
support for the coalition and threatening to suspend arms sales to its
leading members would force Saudi Arabia and the UAE to end or
dramatically reduce their military operations in Yemen. "The Saudi
military is heavily dependent on U.S. weapons and support, and could not
operate effectively without them," according to a report from the Center
for International Policy. Additionally, while the UAE's offensive is
largely ground-based and relies more on the daily cooperation of
mercenaries than it does the United States, America can still influence
Emirati policy due to the UAE's strong reliance on American arms sales.
Saudi Arabia and the UAE depend broadly on American military support to
guarantee their regional security and would be far more likely to
begrudgingly comply with American demands than risk alienating their
most important ally. If nothing else, ending weapon sales would
drastically disrupt their ability to conduct military operations in the
short-term while putting at risk the supply of weapons they need on to
continue the war in the long-term. Furthermore, while the United States
has a vested interest in eliminating Al Qaeda's foothold in Yemen, it
can continue its solo campaign against the terror group even while
withdrawing support for the fight against the Houthis. If nothing else,
a strong U.S. response to the revelations of Saudi and Emirati
mishandling of American arms coupled with a threat to stop future arms
sales would reduce the likelihood that American weapons would be
transferred to these militias in the future, imperiling the
survivability of these groups in the face of America's counter-terror
offensive. The United States must also demand greater Saudi and Emirati
leadership in the pursuit of peace in Yemen. Yemen's rival factions made
some progress in recent peace talks in Stockholm, but no long-term peace
can be attained without participation from the outside powers
responsible for turning an internal conflict into a regional proxy war.
Any political settlement must include Iran, Saudi Arabia, and the UAE,
and pushing the coalition to initiate this process and offer a mutual
cessation of violence could open the door for such negotiations. Even if
a comprehensive end to the fighting remains unattainable now, a real
contract among these outside actors to reduce their military involvement
in Yemen, facilitate humanitarian aid efforts, and agree in principal to
accept a future power-sharing agreement between the internal combatants
would still markedly improve the daily realities of millions in Yemen.
This strategy is certainly not without risk; [ending American
participation and undercutting Saudi and Emirati efforts in Yemen's
civil war could result in greater Iranian empowerment through the
success of the]{.underline} Houthis or could, as former Defense
Secretary James Mattis warned, [result in the loss of civilian life if
Saudi Arabia continues its bombing campaigns absent the support of
American intelligence or targeting assistance. However, both of these
scenarios are happening now even with America's involvement, and
Saudi-led efforts to broker a political settlement could only stand to
improve the deteriorating conditions on the ground. American military
support has proven insufficient to prevent Iranian influence from
spreading into Yemen or spare civilians from the horrors of the
conflict, and there is no reason to suspect that continuing these
failing policies will eventually bring about a different
end.]{.underline} The revelation that American-made weapons are being
transferred to the very forces in Yemen that the United States actively
opposes is emblematic of the broad failings of the coalition's efforts
in this war. For far too long, America has allowed its allies to operate
with impunity at the expense of the Yemeni people and its own national
interest, and the United States must leverage its influence over the
coalition leaders to change their behavior for the better. America in no
way benefits from the destruction of Yemen, the spread of American
weaponry to militants affiliated with Al Qaeda or Iran, or the
reputational damage caused by its association with this humanitarian
disaster. America must act accordingly to reduce the violence in Yemen
and promote a peaceful resolution to the conflict, even if doing so
means standing up to its allies.

### No Impact 

#### Iran is checked by US diplomacy for now

**Roule 6/13**

(Norman T. \-- Norman T. Roule served for 34-years in the Central
Intelligence Agency, managing significant programs relating to the
Middle East. He served as the National Intelligence Manager for Iran
(NIM-I) at the Office of the Director of National Intelligence from
November 2008 until September 2017; "How the US Can Constrain Iran Yet
Avoid Escalation"; Arabia Foundation; 06/13/2019;

Accessed 07/28/2019; JY)

After months of warnings, and spurred by Iran's regional aggression,
Washington announced that its policy of "maximum pressure" would mean
the termination of oil sanction waivers on May 2, ending Iran's ability
to export the oil that provides the country with 40% of its revenue.
[The US also imposed sanctions against Iran's iron, steel, aluminum, and
copper sectors, which together comprise 10% of Iran's export economy.
Iran's response aimed for three goals: posture defiance and protect
domestic unity using rhetoric; demonstrate strength and deterrence
against the United States and regional adversaries through proxy
operations; and employ diplomacy to influence sympathetic international
partners while simultaneously threatening to undermine global security
and economies. For Tehran, the results were disappointing. World energy
prices have, until just now, remained stable, and neither the United
Nations, the European Union, Russia, nor China gave the crisis the
attention Iran sought. This reflects a general trend of Iranian
diplomatic failure. Europe's efforts to undermine US sanctions have
failed. China looks ready to sacrifice Iran for better relations with
the Gulf and perhaps as a lever in US trade talks. Russia has proven to
be a reliable partner on Syria and in fending off action against Tehran
by the United Nations Security Council. But Moscow is a weak economic
partner and also looks to the richer markets of the Arab Gulf states.
Rhetoric aside, the Trump administration's reactions to the Iranian
threat were measured and thus effective, responding to the threat of
Iranian proxy and missile attacks with an intensive diplomatic campaign
and the deployment of military forces to demonstrate resolve. Despite
wild rumors of a massive troop deployment to the region, the Trump
administration deployed only nine hundred additional personnel to
augment force protection.]{.underline} The administration also
infuriated Congress by approving a major arms sale to Riyadh and Abu
Dhabi. Together, these actions reportedly compelled Iran to "step back
and recalculate." Despite its reputation for eschewing diplomacy, the
administration's diplomatic engagement on Iran involved multiple
partners. Prior to the expiration of the oil waivers, [Washington
coordinated with Riyadh and Abu Dhabi to ensure that sufficient oil
would be produced to satisfy Iran's former clients. In response to proxy
threats, US officials issued multiple statements to dissuade Iran and to
alert the international community of the impending crisis. Secretary of
State Pompeo then met with European partners, Iraq's president, and
Russian foreign minister Lavrov in Sochi to discuss the threat. These
meetings spurred Germany, Kuwait, Japan, Iraq, Oman, and Switzerland to
engage Iran]{.underline}. It is likely that their message to Tehran was
that while the US does not seek a military conflict, it will respond
forcefully to any Iranian attack. Washington's decision to conduct B-52
exercises in the region while keeping the aircraft carrier outside the
Gulf reinforced this message. The Saudis and Emiratis quickly organized
three consecutive summits in Mecca with the leadership of the Gulf
Cooperation Council (GCC), the Arab League, and the Organization of
Islamic Cooperation in Mecca to build regional and international
pressure against Iran. Unusually, Doha attended the conferences,
although their foreign minister's postconference statement shows that
Qatar remains unenthusiastic about any anti-Iran coalition. Riyadh,
which has accelerated its ballistic missile program, and Abu Dhabi,
which has rapidly expanded its military capabilities, appear done with
enduring Iranian proxy and unconventional attacks while Iran escapes
unscathed and the United Nations and Europe ignore what has become a
one-sided missile conflict. The West may well wish to prevent missile
buildup in the region, but Iran's actions may make this inevitable if
Riyadh decides it must count on its own forces for deterrence and
protection. Iran's diplomacy during this period covered an array of
themes that included an offer to engage in prisoner exchanges with the
US and Britain, a nonaggression pact with the GCC states, and bizarre
threats to use "top secret weapons" to sink US warships "with everything
and everyone on board." Yet in response to the Trump administration's
willingness to engage in talks, Tehran claimed it would not negotiate
until Washington "showed respect" and lifted sanctions. Iran's supreme
leader---and ultimate decision maker---rejected talks with Washington
"because negotiation has no benefit and carries harm." Iran's
Revolutionary Guard directly ruled out negotiations on Iran's missile
program. Iran's peripatetic foreign minister and other officials
traveled to foreign capitals where they denied Tehran's involvement in
terrorism but also threatened to withdraw from the nuclear deal unless
more was done to oppose US sanctions. The political divisions within the
United States offer Tehran another weapon. The hyperpartisan nature of
the US policy debate on Iran and US friction with Europe have challenged
the development of the bipartisan approach demanded by this issue.
Members of Congress instead publicly argue over the interpretation of
alleged intelligence on Iran's actions. Elsewhere, some pundits claim
that the current approach to Iran mirrors that undertaken against Iraq
before the 2003 conflict. However, and in stark contrast to 2003, the
evidence of Iran's support for terrorism, role in the deaths of hundreds
of Americans, responsibility for missile and drone attacks against
Israel and Saudi Arabia, and past nuclear weaponization program is
extensive and a matter of public record. Nonetheless, concerns that
tensions could erupt into another costly Middle Eastern war guarantee
that this debate will continue. Tehran follows our politics closely, and
Iran's foreign minister Zarif will continue to use our media and
sympathetic interlocutors to broadcast Iran's narrative. Zarif also
knows that some in the West believe that engagement with pragmatic
conservatives is a worthy cause and respond well to his complaints that
pressure empowers hard-liners. Iran has also copied Moscow's social
media information operations to twist our debate. [In coming weeks,
Washington's challenge will be to maintain a robust diplomatic and
sanctions campaign to keep Iran on the defensive without provoking Iran
to action. Iran has no choice but to strike while it retains the
economic and political strength to do so. Iran's extraterritorial
actions continue to be useful tools of pressure and retaliation, albeit
with less impact than in past years. Domestic unrest remains muted, and
sanctions-induced economic problems have yet to destabilize the regime
to the point where Tehran would feel compelled to compromise on the
regional, missile, or nuclear issues. **But time is not on Iran's
side**, although Iran no doubt still hopes it can outlast the Trump
administration and find relief---and perhaps even compensation---from a
successor administration prepared to return to the nuclear
deal]{.underline}. For the average Iranian, sanctions and decades of
mismanagement mean a hard life. Annual inflation is approaching 40%.
Poultry prices have risen 57%, vegetables by 47% and milk, cheese, and
eggs by 37%. Medicine is costly and sometimes unavailable. Iran's
overall unemployment rate exceeds 12%, and youth unemployment is far
higher. Iran's economy is likely to contract by as much as 6% in 2019
after falling almost 4% in 2018. [At a time when Iran's leadership needs
political stability, Iran's economy will be at its worst since 1989,
guaranteeing unrest. Budget problems have allegedly forced Tehran to cut
its offensive cyber unit's budget]{.underline}. Even the Revolutionary
Guard's Quds Force has reportedly lost 17% of its funding. Sanctions
have reportedly required cuts in Iranian aid to Lebanese Hezbollah to
the point where the group is begging Yemeni supporters for cash. It is
likely that other proxies are enduring similar budget blues. The
reported decision by Iran's leaders to consider a US-approved "oil for
goods" program to obtain foodstuffs and medicine is good news for Iran's
people but a blow against the supreme leader's longtime assertion that
Iran could survive through a resistance economy. For all the talk of
diplomacy, a successful process would require significant concessions
from either Washington or Tehran (more likely both[). The US will need
to offer Iran concessions on its regional adventurism and missile
program. Tehran must relinquish regional gains, accept international
limitations on its missiles and offer new concessions on its nuclear
program. The former **would require that the US abandon its regional
allies**, and the latter would upend long-held positions by the supreme
leader and Revolutionary Guard. I]{.underline}mportantly, diplomacy also
requires Iran to negotiate core security programs directly with the
United States. The supreme leader has routinely rejected such a concept,
the only exceptions being the nuclear and detainee talks under the Obama
administration. However, these talks occurred after years of biting
sanctions and the release of a large number of Iranians who had engaged
in sanctions-busting activities on behalf of Iran's military and
security forces, amid a sense that the US was prepared to acknowledge
Iran's right to a domestic enrichment program. Iran has repeatedly
denied proposals to establish a hotline between US and Iranian naval
forces in the Gulf as well as any suggestion that its regional presence
or domestic missile programs are up for discussion with the US. Further,
Iran's supreme leader is of an age where he is unlikely to agree that
Tehran needs to alter the foundation of its relationship with the Great
Satan he has so ardently opposed over several decades. Those in Tehran
who wish to replace him---and this will require the support of the
hard-line Revolutionary Guard---would commit political suicide by
advocating such negotiations with Washington[. Washington's diplomacy
has produced a raft of intermediaries willing to engage Iran, which
represents a positive step.]{.underline} However, the countries
allegedly acting as intermediaries can convey messages and possibly even
act as a host for US-Iran diplomatic discussions, but absent an ability
to press Tehran to restrain its regional and missile programs, their
utility will be limited. Iraqi engagement, for example, will be
complicated. Iran's proxies are deeply embedded in Iraq's polity, and
the Iranian ambassador is reported to be a former Quds Force officer.
Iraqi officials can message a spectrum of Iranian actors, doing so as a
fragile party unable ever to bring pressure on Iran. Russia's regional
stature and relationship with Iran actually benefits from increased
tensions.

#### US not key to check Iran- China already doing it

**Mcgrath 19**(Ciaran mcgrath, reporter, April 24 2019, Tehran pursueing

Rear Admiral Hossein Khanzadi is on an official visit to China to mark
the 70th anniversary of the founding of the Chinese People\'s Liberation
Army Navy. And [he took the opportunity to stress the close diplomatic,
economic, trade and energy ties between Tehran and
Beijing]{.underline} - while taking a swipe at \"trans-regional
states\", a clear reference to the USA. He told Iranian news agency
Fars: \"Given the strategic geopolitical situation of both states,
today, we are witnessing a leap in marine civilisation in the Pacific
Ocean by China and Northern Indian Ocean by Islamic Iran, which will
force the arrogant powers to leave our naval zones and the regional
powers will certainly fill the security vacuum and there will be no need
to foreigners\' presence. \"The world should know that the
trans-regional states\' deployment in Northern Indian Ocean is
meaningless, and that collective security will be achieved only by the
regional states.\" Prior to his trip, Mr Khanzadi said he was keen to
strengthen links between the navies of the two countries. He said: \"The
navies of the regional countries can provide security of the Indian
Ocean.\" Speaking at AJA University of Command and Staff in Tehran, he
referenced Supreme Leader Ayatollah Seyed Ali Khamenei to as having said
that \"the presence of power in the sea per se is a sign of power, so if
we want to be in the sea, we need knowledge, technology, specialist
human forces and very advanced equipment". In another clear reference to
the US, he added: \"if we have a political and defensive diplomacy, we
can defeat the enemies' strategy of imposing sanctions.\" The US has
imposed stringent sanctions on Iran after President Donald Trump took
the decision to pull out of the Joint Plan of Comprehensive Action
(JPOCA) agreement aimed at preventing Iran from developing nuclear
weapons last year - a move which has enraged Tehran. China\'s naval
celebrations are being held in the waters off the Eastern Chinese city
of Qingdao in Shandong Province. [Three years ago, Iran and China signed
an agreement to enhance defence cooperation. Iran and China have
maintained close diplomatic, economic, trade and energy ties, and in
2016 the defence ministers of the two countries signed an agreement
aimed at improved defence cooperation]{.underline}. In June 2017, the
two navies staged a joint maritime drill in the Strait of Hormuz and the
Sea of Oman with an Iranian destroyer, two Chinese destroyers and 700
Iranian navy personnel. Speaking last September after a meeting with
Iranian counterpart Amir Hatami, Chinese Defence Minister Wei Fenghe
said: "The relations between the armed forces of China and Iran are
developing positively. [\"Beijing is ready to strengthen the strategic
communication with Tehran, expand the spheres of cooperation, achieve
new fruitful results of cooperation between the two armies and thereby
contribute to the development of a comprehensive strategic partnership
of the two states.]{.underline}\" China supplies much of Iran's advanced
weaponry, having exported equipment worth almost £245 million to the
Islamic Republic between 2007-2016. Naval equipment told by Beijing to
Tehran includes tactical ballistic and anti-ship cruise missiles,
advanced anti-ship mines, and Houdong fast-attack boats. China buys
large quantities of Iranian oil, which may explain the cordial relations
between the two countries, as well as Beijing's opposition to the
ongoing US sanctions. In a press briefing on Monday, Chinese foreign
ministry spokesman Geng Shuang said: \"China opposes the unilateral
sanctions and so-called \'long-arm jurisdictions\' imposed by the US.
\"Our cooperation with Iran is open, transparent, lawful and legitimate,
thus it should be respected."

In February, as a Middle East meeting hosted by the Poles and
orchestrated by the Trump administration kicked off, Israeli Prime
Minister Benjamin Netanyahu posted an ominous tweet, saying that the
gathering was to \"advance the common interest of war with Iran.\" The
tweet was soon after deleted and reposted to read \"combatting Iran\"
\-- but the implication remained. Meanwhile, a recent Saudi news outlet
reportedly close to Saudi Crown Prince Mohammad bin Salman (MBS) urged
the US to launch surgical strikes against Iran after the kingdom accused
Tehran of a drone strike that closed down a Saudi oil pipeline. At
present, the US-Iranian relationship is balanced precariously between
situations of no peace and no war. The Trump administration\'s
unilateral withdrawal from the 2015 Iran nuclear deal and its campaign
of maximum economic pressure on Iran has ushered in a period of
uncertainty that leaves both sides in a potentially dangerous cycle,
each taking escalatory steps that increase the odds of a military
conflict, particularly in the absence of a direct channel for
deescalation. When it comes to Iran, Jerusalem and Riyadh are hardly
objective observers; while both would be at risk in a US war with Iran,
they have consistently advocated hardline US policies. That\'s precisely
why the **[US should reject]{.underline}** their advice. We should not
follow Israeli and **[Saudi policies that raise risks of war with
Iran]{.underline}**, especially since **[their interests don\'t always
align with our own]{.underline}**. They believed the Iran nuclear deal
was a disaster. It wasn\'t. The nuclear deal with Iran would have
prevented Tehran from developing a nuclear weapon until at least 2030
and subjected its nuclear program to the most stringent verification
regime in the history of arms control. Like many arms control
agreements, it was flawed but highly functional and probably the best
agreement that could have been negotiated at the time. It served
America\'s paramount objective of preventing a nuclear-armed Iran from
dominating the region, and thus heading off US or Israeli military
strikes on Iran\'s nuclear infrastructure. The Israeli and Saudi
governments, however, hated the agreement and did everything they could
to tank it. Saudi Arabia seemed more concerned with Iran\'s geopolitical
ambitions in the Gulf while Israel focused on the existential threat of
a nuclear-armed Iran. In short, for Jerusalem and Riyadh the US outreach
to Iran heralded an increase in Iran\'s threatening influence and a
growing US-Iranian reconciliation that would have jeopardized their
clout with Washington and their influence and security. In successfully
helping to persuade the Trump administration to leave the nuclear deal
in 2018, Saudi Arabia and Israel took care of their own needs and
interests. The US, in contrast, left itself with no alternative
framework to constrain Iran\'s nuclear program and no dialogue to engage
Tehran. The default option became a campaign of sanctions that, while
successful in squeezing Iran\'s economy, has not offered a way to rein
in Iran\'s nuclear ambitions or regional influence, let alone
renegotiate a new deal. The dangerous tensions we are witnessing with
Iran today are direct outgrowths of the unraveling of the nuclear
agreement. **[Saudi Arabia]{.underline}**and Israel **[aren\'t ideal
allies for countering Iran]{.underline}**Last November President Trump
applauded Saudi Arabia as a \"great ally in our very important fight
against Iran.\" What exactly was Trump talking about? Far from taking
coherent steps to combat Iran\'s influence in the region, the
**[reckless policies of MBS, the de facto architect of Saudi foreign
policy,]{.underline}**has **[expanded Iran\'s influence]{.underline}**,
**[not contracted it]{.underline}**\-- all **[with the help of the Trump
admin]{.underline}**istration. The Saudi-led MBS economic war against
Qatar has actually deepened Iran\'s influence there; and the Saudis\'
inhumane war against Iranian-backed Houthi rebels with US military
support has helped to devastate Yemen, hand Iran a propaganda victory,
strengthen al Qaeda and the Islamic State in Yemen, [and blacken the US
image]{.underline}\-- all without constraining Tehran\'s influence. The
[**Israelis have been** much**more disciplined and effective than Saudi
Arabia**]{.underline} when it comes to **[checking Iran\'s influence in
Syria without precipitating a larger conflict.]{.underline}**But the
situation there remains fraught. Iran is increasing its influence on the
ground not only with the Assad regime but also through its proxies and
has no intention of leaving Syria. And the Israeli government\'s
policies toward the Palestinians in Gaza have played a role in
increasing Iran\'s influence there, especially empowering Palestine
Islamic Jihad, a pro-Iranian group that was responsible for triggering
the recent escalation. They face an existential threat from Iran \-- we
don\'t **[Iran doesn\'t present an existential threat to the
U]{.underline}**nited **[S]{.underline}**tates. Israel and Saudi Arabia,
on the other hand, have legitimate reasons to worry about Iran\'s
nuclear program and its activities in their neighborhood. It should not
be surprising, therefore, that both countries want the US to take the
point in confronting Iran, although neither Jerusalem nor Riyadh want to
be dragged into a US-Iranian war that might put them at risk. Saudi
Arabia is extremely vulnerable to Iranian ballistic missiles and
sabotage of its oil facilities, and Israel doesn\'t want to fight a war
against Iranian- backed Hezbollah and its 130,000 high trajectory
weapons The US shouldn\'t want to instigate a conflict either, not only
for our sake but for Israel, Saudi Arabia and Iran\'s, too. America
should avoid a war with Iran at all costs unless Tehran threatens core
American interests: preventing terrorism against Americans abroad or
against the homeland, preserving the uninterrupted flow of oil from the
Persian Gulf, and preventing Iranian acquisition of a nuclear weapon.
Israel and Saudi Arabia have understandable fears and insecurities about
Iran, even though they are often inflated. But it\'s dangerous to signal
that the US shares these concerns, which only emboldens both countries,
especially the Saudis, to engage in reckless and irresponsible behavior
that inflames tensions and increases the risk of war. Unlike Netanyahu
and MBS, who have little interest in engaging Iran, the **[Trump
administration should make the effort to open direct contacts with
Iran.]{.underline}**And Trump has, in fact, expressed that he wants Iran
to give him a call, but no such call has been received. If a
conversation were to lead to a serious and sustained dialogue, **[it
could help avoid escalating the tension]{.underline}**or even probe
other areas of possible negotiation, although prospects for any
agreement are slim. **[The administration needs to stop
taking]{.underline}**Israel and **[Saudi advice on Iran
and]{.underline}**instead **[look to its own needs and
interests]{.underline}**. If the Trump administration can engage North
Korea\'s Kim Jong Un, the world\'s most brutal dictator, it can
certainly start talking to Iran.

#### No risk of Iran causing oil shocks

began his additional role as a contributing op-ed columnist for CNBC in

Many cynics have long contended that the real reason the U.S. entered a
slew of recent wars was only to protect American oil interests. But now
**[it's beginning to look like oil may be a major reason why the U.S.
isn't getting into a war with Iran]{.underline}**. Believing that flies
in the face of a common sentiment that the need for oil costs lives,
especially when discussing the first and second Persian Gulf Wars. That
sentiment was helped along by the fact that President George H.W. Bush
and his son President George W. Bush had both been oilmen before
embarking on their political careers. **[No matter how convincing the
non-oil arguments for those wars coming from Washington were at the
time, a significant number of voters and politicians continue to believe
American lives were sacrificed to either protect or expand oil company
interests in the region.]{.underline}** But the first Gulf War ended so
quickly with what was widely considered to be a resounding U.S. victory
that the first President Bush never really bore the brunt of that
specific criticism. However, it's hard to forget all those "No Blood for
Oil" bumper stickers that sprouted up across the country around 2005 and
2006 when popular support for the second Gulf War began to disappear.
Those who thought that anger was only felt by liberals and Democrats
were disabused of that notion during the 2016 Republican presidential
primaries when Donald Trump's frequent criticism of the second war in
Iraq clearly resonated with GOP voters and helped him sweep to the
nomination. **[But no matter how much President Trump bashed the war in
Iraq as a candidate, those hoping to avoid a Persian Gulf war against
Iran have something else going for them: and it's the price and supply
of that same oil they blame for the previous wars. Iran appears to be
committing a different act of harassment every week in the vital oil
shipping lanes in the Strait of Hormuz.]{.underline}** But U.S. crude
oil prices remain relatively tame at the \$56 a barrel level. Even the
[national average gasoline price is holding below the \$3 level at
\$2.76](https://gasprices.aaa.com/). That \$56 number is well under the
all-time high of \$147.30 a barrel price we hit in July of 2008. The
\$2.76 number is far below the \$4.11 per gallon national average peak
we hit at the same time 11 years ago. Of course, those lower prices are
even lower when adjusted for inflation**[. Prices are just half the
story, because oil prices similarly did not spike to much higher levels
in the periods before either war with Iraq. What did spike was the fear
that the bulk of the existing supply of the oil the U.S. needed would be
blocked or even destroyed by Saddam Hussein.]{.underline}** That's where
the most dramatic, and now most potent current anti-war factor comes
into play**[. The U.S. is now the world's number one crude oil
supplier.]{.underline}** That doesn't mean shutting off the spigot of
oil from allies like Saudi Arabia would be easy, but at least now it's
possible. That means the myriad of voices from oil lobbyists, to
concerned manufacturers, to worried American drivers, can remain
relatively silent in the face of any rising threats to oil traffic in
the Gulf. **[In short, it's hard to compare how much less pressure that
puts President Trump to go to war right now compared to both Presidents
Bush years ago]{.underline}**. All thanks to oil. Even if President
Trump doesn't want to completely sit on the sidelines, this situation
opens up the possibility of one or a series of smaller pinpointed
attacks against Iran. The argument against those kinds of smaller
attacks on Iraq was that Saddam Hussein could massively disrupt the
global oil supply for any reason in response. So it didn't make sense to
attack him without using the massive force needed to severely handicap
his regime's ability to respond. Now, the Trump team can injure Iran and
not worry that every small gesture will send crude prices skyrocketing
overnight. U.S. advantage of course, there's one more added bonus.
Iran's mischief in the Gulf is a de facto argument for more foreign
countries to buy more U.S. crude and even natural gas. President Trump
may not be nearly as close to the oil industry as the Bushes were, but
he's certainly an ally and would certainly enjoy seeing the economic
boost that would come from more demand for American energy. **[That
leaves global terrorism by Iran and the threats to our allies,
especially Israel, as the only real reasons to confront Iran head-on at
this time. But it's [not even clear that Israel supports such a
confrontation at this
time](https://www.jpost.com/Breaking-News/Netanyahu-convinced-Trump-not-to-attack-Iran-after-drone-downing-report-596226),
and the threat of increased Iranian-backed terror has been greater ever
since the U.S. withdrew from the Iran nuclear deal.]{.underline}** Just
a decade ago, it seemed like every move in the Gulf, every Saudi
production change, and every pipeline disruption in Nigeria could send
prices at the pump back to \$4 a gallon and increase violence at any
time. Now it's undeniable, even if hard to believe, that oil is giving
peace a chance.

## Impacts -- Oil

[For 45 years Saudi Arabia has stuck to a mantra of never using its
power as the world's largest oil exporter to threaten its western
allies]{.underline}. But [in a sign of the pressure it is feeling over
the disappearance of journalist Jamal Khashoggi, it came close over the
weekend to challenging that decades-old stance]{.underline}, warning it
could retaliate if targeted by the US through its "influential and vital
role" in the world economy. For an oil market beset by worries --- from
renewed US sanctions on Iran to the collapse in Venezuela's crude
production --- the comments from Saudi Arabia came as a stark reminder
of its outsized role in energy markets, but also raised a question mark
over the stability of its oil policy at a time of flux in the kingdom.
While Saudi Arabia quickly went into damage-limitation mode on Monday,
with energy minister Khalid al-Falih reiterating the country's
commitment to keeping markets well supplied, some in the industry were
still unsettled by an impetuous statement they see coming from the very
top. "It's quite extraordinary as the Saudis have historically tried to
keep politics and economics separate, but right now [they are trying to
remind the world of their strength]{.underline}," said Gary Ross, a
seasoned oil watcher who runs Black Gold LLC. "It's uncharacteristic but
it reflects the new leadership of the kingdom," he added, referring to
Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, widely known as MBS. Prince Mohammed,
who has cemented himself as next in line to the throne behind his father
King Salman, has tried to cultivate a reputation as a reformer, while
becoming the primary decision maker for everything from oil to military
policy. But while few doubt Prince Mohammed's ability to hold sway over
oil markets --- the kingdom pumps more than 11 per cent of crude
globally and exports at least 7.5m barrels a day --- most observers
believe wielding oil as a weapon overtly would be a step too far.
"[While pump prices in the US would spike if Saudi Arabia were to cut
oil supplies, the **use of oil as a weapon would**]{.underline} also
[**hurt the Saudis themselves**,]{.underline}" said Jason Bordoff, a
former adviser to President Barack Obama, who founded of the Center on
Global Energy Policy at Columbia University. ["\[It would\] accelerate a
transition toward alternatives likes electric vehicles, and undermine
the reputation Saudi Arabia has built in the decades since 1973 as a
reliable supplier]{.underline}." [The history of 1973 looms large for
the kingdom. Back then it joined an oil embargo against countries seen
as supporting Israel in the Yom Kippur war. While the resultant jump in
energy prices is painfully remembered in the west, the long-term damage
was much worse for producers, with conservation measures ultimately
lowering demand for crude in many countries.]{.underline}

### No Impact -- US Stability

#### Saudi Arabia doesn't set oil prices, the US does -- marginal producer sets the commodity price 

**Watts 2019** (William Watts, MarketWatch's senior markets writer,
\"Why the oil rally is more about U.S. shale than Saudi Arabia's output
cuts\", Market Watch, April 4 2019,
<https://www.marketwatch.com/story/why-us-shale-and-not-powerhouse-saudi-arabia-is-setting-global-oil-prices-2019-04-04>,
mmv)

[Saudi Arabia is often described as the global oil market's "swing
producer." But the main driver for oil prices right now is coming from
the world's "marginal producer," and that happens to be the
U.S.,]{.underline} says one commodity analyst.

But first, what's the difference between "swing" and "marginal"
production?

[A swing producer is one with ample spare capacity that can ramp up or
curtail production virtually at will]{.underline}, without regard to
price, something that almost requires a command economy, said John
LaForge, head of real asset strategy at Wells Fargo Investment
Institute, in a phone interview Wednesday. [The U.S. can't really do
that, but the Saudis can]{.underline}, given that its oil company, Saudi
Aramco, is owned by the state.

[The marginal producer]{.underline}, on the other hand, [is more
sensitive to price swings. It produces extra, or marginal, barrels of
oil when the price is high enough to make its higher-cost wells
profitable.]{.underline}

[That's important because commodity prices are often set on the
margin]{.underline}, LaForge explained in a note to clients earlier this
week. [That means they are set "by the country that is producing that
extra barrel of oil, ounce of gold, or pound of copper. In the case of
oil, the U.S. is producing that extra barrel of oil for the world to
consume]{.underline}," he said.

[While production curbs by Saudi Arabia]{.underline} and Russia, as part
of a pact by Saudi-led OPEC and its Russian-led allies, [played a role
in driving the U.S. benchmark]{.underline}, West Texas Intermediate,
[from \$45 to more than \$60 a barrel by the end of the first quarter,
the most important factor was the fear of a drop-off in U.S. shale
output]{.underline}, LaForge said.

[U.S. oil output remains at a record level but the Energy Information
Administration is forecasting production to grow more slowly than the
agency had previously expected]{.underline}. The EIA last month said it
expects 2019 U.S. crude production of 12.3 million barrels a day versus
its previous estimate of 12. 4 million barrels.

Year-to-date WTI futures US:CLK9 are up more than 37%, trading Thursday
near \$62.45 a barrel. The global benchmark, Brent crude UK:LCOM9 is up
29% over the same stretch, trading just below \$70 a barrel.

[With the U.S. serving as the world's marginal producer, the cost of
producing U.S. oil is crucial in setting global oil prices]{.underline},
LaForge said. [That means shale costs matter most as it's the source of
the extraordinary rise in U.S. oil productio]{.underline}n. And those
costs have been falling, dropping from the low \$70s per barrel as
recently as five years ago to the mid-\$40s now (see chart below).

### No Impact -- Intervening Actors

#### No risk of an impact -- price spiking doesn't work and intervening actors check

**Kemp 18** (John Kemp leads a group of specialist energy and
commodities analysts for Reuters. His expertise lies in oil and gas,
refining, energy policy, international trade, and the financial and
foreign policy aspects of energy. Before joining Reuters in 2008, John

accessed 7/27/19)

[Experience from the last time Saudi Arabia tried to use oil sales as a
diplomatic instrument in 1973/74 shows such action does not work and the
kingdom itself would be the biggest victim.]{.underline} Despite some of
the impassioned rhetoric in Saudi media, self-interest makes it
improbable the government will retaliate by reducing oil sales or trying
to drive up prices. That has not stopped some veiled threats to
weaponise oil production and prices, but they should be interpreted as
an urgent plea for support and understanding rather than a serious
threat. "If U.S. sanctions are imposed on Saudi Arabia, we will be
facing an economic disaster that would rock the entire world," according
to one heated editorial ("U.S. sanctions would mean Washington is
stabbing itself", Al Arabiya, Oct. 14). "Riyadh is the capital of
(global) oil and touching this would affect oil production before any
other vital commodity," the editorial warned. If the price of oil
reaching \$80 a barrel angered U.S. President Donald Trump, "no one
should rule out the price jumping to \$100, or \$200, or even double
that figure", the author said bluntly. The government's official
response has been more circumspect but it nonetheless warned that it
would respond to any action with even greater retaliation and pointed to
the kingdom's "influential and vital role in the global economy". OIL
EMBARGO In October 1973, Saudi Arabia and the other Arab oil producers
announced that they would start cutting production by 5 percent per
month until Israeli forces evacuated from occupied Arab territories. In
addition, Saudi Arabia and the other Arab producers announced an embargo
on oil sales to the United States and a number of other countries
("OPEC: 25 years of prices and politics", Skeet, 1988). Global oil
supplies had already become tight even before the decisions to cut
production and embargo the United States, mostly as a result of low real
prices during the 1950 and 1960s. Spare production capacity in the
United States, which had been as much as 4 million barrels per day in
1968, had been used up by March 1972. In this context, the production
cuts and embargo made an already tight market worse, sent oil prices
surging, and produced a huge, short-term revenue windfall for Saudi
Arabia and other oil producers. But [the policy was a failure in its own
terms, was reversed a few months later, and caused immense long-term
damage to Saudi Arabia and OPEC that took decades to
reverse]{.underline}. POLICY FAILURE [At the most basic level, the
policy failed to achieve its stated objective of changing U.S. support
for Israel or forcing Israel to withdraw from the occupied Palestinian
territories. More seriously for Saudi Arabia and other Arab oil
producers, the surge in prices, which rose again after the Iranian
revolution in 1979, resulted in permanent demand destruction and
encouragement of alternative suppliers.]{.underline} Rising prices
helped spur the development of new supplies in Alaska, the North Sea,
the Soviet Union and China, which came onstream and flooded the oil
market in the 1980s. [Rising prices also encouraged a wholesale switch
away from the use of crude oil and heavy fuel oil in residential and
commercial heating boilers as well as in power generation]{.underline}.
Homes and offices in the United States and many other advanced economies
switched from heavy fuel oil to cheaper and more reliable heating using
natural gas or electricity generated from coal or nuclear. Crude oil and
fuel oil were replaced by a new generation of coal-fired power plants in
the United States in the late 1970s and the 1980s (ironically the same
coal plants that are now being closed and replaced by natural gas). The
oil shock also provided the impetus to develop a new generation of
nuclear power plants in the United States, France, Japan, Britain and
other countries to reduce the reliance on imported crude. Cheap oil had
been on the way to becoming the dominant fuel for power generation in
the 1950s and 1960s, putting the coal industry under pressure. By the
late 1980s, however, expensive and unreliable oil had been largely
pushed out of the power sector by cheaper and more secure coal, gas and
nuclear, a permanent loss of markets from which it has never recovered.
Policymakers in the United States, Europe and Japan also enacted new
fuel-economy standards for motor vehicles to reduce reliance on imports
for the transport sector, taking another enduring bite out of demand. In
the long term, the oil embargo created the conditions for the oil price
slump that hit Saudi Arabia and other producers in the 1980s and 1990s,
and from which they did not recover until the 2000s. WEAPON MALFUNCTION
**[The oil weapon does not work]{.underline}**, which is why Saudi
Arabia is unlikely to employ it in the dispute over the disappearance of
Washington Post journalist Jamal Khashoggi. In the short term, [Saudi
Arabia might gain more revenue from a rise in prices than it lost from a
reduction in sales. But rising prices would hit the global economy and
consumption hard and threaten a renewed oil market slump within a
year]{.underline}. [The **weapon cannot be wielded** in a targeted way
against specific consuming countries because the oil market is global
and fully integrated.]{.underline} Restricting supplies to punish some
countries pushes up oil prices for all consumers. Wielding the oil
weapon to pressure the United States would impose bigger costs on China
and India, which are the largest and fastest-growing oil importers and
crucial markets for the future. [Saudi Arabia has spent decades
marketing itself as a reliable oil supplier, especially to customers in
Asia, and any attempt to employ the oil weapon would destroy that
carefully crafted reputation.]{.underline} Saudi Arabia's refining
customers would instead turn to Iran, Russia and the United States for
additional supplies and likely reconsider their long-term dependence on
the kingdom. If Saudi Arabia nonetheless attempted to weaponise oil
production and sales, the resulting surge in prices would prompt another
round of conservation measures cutting long-term demand for its main
product. Sharp rises in oil prices would put a renewed focus on vehicle
fuel economy standards as well as accelerating the deployment of
electric vehicles. Rising prices and concerns about unreliable supplies
would speed the diffusion of electric vehicles and push oil out of the
transport market just as it was pushed out of heating and power
generation in the 1980s. [Saudi Arabia has spent years urging
oil-consuming countries to remember it needs "security of demand" just
as much as they need "security of supply". But weaponising oil
production would break that understanding and provoke a backlash from
consuming countries with a concerted effort to reduce their oil imports.
Finally, Saudi Arabia relies heavily on the United States for
security]{.underline} (including the provision of advanced weapons
systems, training, intelligence and thousands of U.S. personnel and
aircraft stationed in and around the Gulf). [There is no way to wield
the oil weapon which would not shake the foundations of the U.S.-Saudi
alliance]{.underline} on which the kingdom's defence depends, leaving it
vulnerable to regional rivals, including Iran. For all these reasons,
the oil weapon is essentially useless, an unreliable blunderbuss more
likely to blow up the user than its intended target, which is why Saudi
Arabia is unlikely to deploy it.

### No Impact -- Populism

#### No scenario for war as a result of populism -- mutually assured destruction solves

**Cooper 16** (Louis F. -- His online writing includes "Reflections on
U.S. Foreign Policy" at the U.S. Intellectual History Blog (July 16,

Accessed 7/28/19)

Several reasons present themselves. First, [**nuc**lear weapon**s** have
given the prospect of a global war, or any great-power war, a
possibility of **civilization-ending finality** that it did not have in
the past]{.underline}. Second, [the security architecture created under
U.S. leadership after World War II has arguably worked to **reduce the
likelihood of major armed conflict**]{.underline} among the great
powers. Third, [the existence of a network of **international
institutions**]{.underline}, both inside and outside the UN system, [has
pushed in the same direction]{.underline}. Fourth, it is very possible
that, as John Mueller and Christopher Fettweis have argued,
[decision-makers have to come see great-power war as "**subrationally
unthinkable**, or not even part of the option set]{.underline} for the
great powers."\[ii\] The extreme destructiveness of the twentieth
century's world wars, fueled partly by developments in technology, might
well have produced long-term effects on how leaders and publics think
about global or great-power war, in a way, for instance, that the
Napoleonic Wars, for all their horror and bloodiness, did not. Phil
Arena's recent contribution to this series argues that if the U.S. under
a Trump administration signals an unwillingness to defend its allies,
then Putin might be tempted to gamble on an invasion of the Baltics or
Kim Jong-Un similarly might gamble on an invasion of South Korea (and
that would drag in China). Putting aside Kim Jong-Un for the moment as a
special case, let's consider Putin. As long as NATO exists -- and Trump,
despite his statements about the unfairness of the distribution of cost
burdens, has not suggested, as far as I'm aware, that he wants to
dissolve the alliance -- then Putin would have to assume that an attack
on the Baltics would trigger a NATO response. Even if Putin does not see
great-power war as unthinkable or outside his "option set," one would
assume that for reasons of pure self-interest he would not want to risk
a nuclear war. Nor, one might think, would he want to jeopardize the
prospect of better (from his standpoint) relations with a U.S.
administration less concerned with, among other things, his commission
of war crimes in Syria or his annexation of Crimea than the Obama
administration has been. For these reasons, I'm not too worried that the
advent of the Trump administration will lead to a war with Russia over
the Baltics. The Korean peninsula is, perhaps, a more worrisome
situation. Chances are, however, that Trump, after taking office, will
be prevailed upon to make reassuring noises about the U.S. commitment to
South Korea, and that should suffice to deter Kim Jong-Un from doing
anything too rash. The cautionary point here, admittedly, is that it's
not clear whether Kim can be counted on to behave in a minimally
rational fashion. Putin, whatever one might think of him, is rational.
It's not entirely clear whether Kim is. However, if Kim is irrational
then all bets are off regardless of what U.S. policy pronouncements are
forthcoming. [World politics is not invariably cyclical and states can
**learn from experience**]{.underline} (as even Gilpin acknowledged).
[If one admits this and pays **due attention to history**, then it is
plausible to think that **the force of populist
nationalism**]{.underline}, [as expressed in more erratic and/or less
'internationalist' official policy, will **not**, whatever its **other
effects may be**, **increase the low likelihood of a global
war**.]{.underline}

#### No impact to populism -- it can't gain enough support and is always doomed to fail

Immigration and terrorism crises, which aided [populism's world-shaking
rise in 2016, have waned]{.underline}. [Populists have faced
disappointing election results in Germany, the United States and even
Poland, shattering the image of the movement's
inevitability]{.underline} and its claims to represent true popular
will. Why would that be happening? A few quotes from Fisher point to the
answer. ...[without a crisis to justify populism's hard-line policies,
its message has been stripped down to its most core element: opposition
to liberal ideals of pluralism, multiculturalism and international
cooperation... Many Western populists are falling back to their message
of besiegement and threat, as much out of the paranoid worldview that is
central to populism as out of any conscious strategy]{.underline}... But
dividing the world into us versus them works only if voters want to
belong to "us" and oppose "them," typically establishment elites and
cultural outsiders. [As we saw prior to the 2018 midterm elections in
this country, Trump and the Republicans attempted to create a crisis
about the caravan of migrants heading towards our southern border. That
is because the only way populism survives is by inventing an existential
threat. When the crisis fails to materialize, populists lose their
appeal. We're watching that unfold now with the lack of support, even
among some Republicans, for the president's government shutdown over a
wall]{.underline}. [Eventually populist energy dissipates (it is
difficult to maintain anger and fear over the long term), and might even
swing against those who promulgated the fake crisis in the first
place]{.underline}. Fisher isn't claiming that populism is dead, or even
in its death throes. Instead, he forecasts that, while [populist appeal
will never attract a majority]{.underline}, "they will remain in a
strong position to challenge liberalism's postwar hold over Western
democracies." That could be more disruptive in countries with
parliamentary systems. In this country, it simply means that Republicans
will continue to try to scare people by suggesting that "those people"
are a threat to "us." Same as it ever was.

## Impacts -- Prolif 

### No Link

#### Ending arms sales prevents prolif through cooperation

[The first benefit from reducing arms sales would be greater diplomatic
flexibility and leverage]{.underline}. Critics might argue that even if
arms sales are an imperfect tool, forgoing arms sales will eliminate a
potential source of leverage. We argue that, on the contrary, the
diplomatic gains from forgoing arms sales will outweigh the potential
leverage or other benefits from arms sales. Most importantly, by
refraining from arming nations engaged in conflict, the United States
will have the diplomatic flexibility to engage with all parties as an
honest broker. [The inherent difficulty of negotiating while arming one
side is obvious today with respect to North and South
Korea]{.underline}. After decades of U.S. support for South Korea, North
Korea clearly does not trust the United States. Similarly, U.S. attempts
to help negotiate a peace deal between the Israelis and Palestinians
have long been complicated by American support for Israel. [To stop
arming one side of a contentious relationship is not to suggest that the
United States does not have a preferred outcome in such cases. Rather,
by staying out of the military domain the United States can more readily
encourage dialogue and diplomacy. Forgoing arms sales is likely to be a
superior strategy even in cases where the United States has an
entrenched interest]{.underline}. In the case of Taiwan, for example,
though it is clear that Taiwan needs to purchase weapons from other
countries to provide for its defense, those weapons do not have to be
made in the United States. Having Taiwan buy from other suppliers would
help defuse U.S.-China tensions. Even if Taiwan's defenses remained
robust, China would clearly prefer a situation in which American arms no
longer signal an implicit promise to fight on Taiwan's behalf. This
could also promote more productive U.S.-China diplomacy in general, as
well as greater stability in the Pacific region. Most important,
breaking off arms sales would also reduce the likelihood of the United
States becoming entangled in a future conflict between Taiwan and China.
This is not to say that unilateral American action will put an end to
the problems of the global arms trade. States would still seek to ensure
their security and survival through deterrence and military strength.
Other weapons suppliers would, in the short run, certainly race to meet
the demand. [But history shows that global nonproliferation treaties and
weapons bans typically require great-power support]{.underline}. In
1969, for example, Richard Nixon decided to shutter the American
offensive-biological-weapons program and seek an international ban on
such weapons. By 1972 the Biological Weapons Convention passed and has
since been signed by 178 nations.98 In 1991 President George H. W. Bush
unilaterally renounced the use of chemical weapons. By 1993 the United
States had signed the Chemical Weapons Convention, which now has 192
signatories.99 Both of these efforts succeeded in part because the
United States took decisive early action in the absence of any promises
about how others would respond.100 [Without U.S. leadership, any effort
to limit proliferation of major conventional weapons and dangerous
emerging technologies is likely to fail. The second major benefit of
reducing arms sales is that it would imbue the United States with
greater moral authority. Today, as the leading arms-dealing nation in
the world, the United States lacks credibility in discussions of arms
control and nonproliferation, especially in light of its military
interventionism since 2001. By showing the world that it is ready to
choose diplomacy over the arms trade, the United States would provide a
huge boost to international efforts to curtail proliferation and its
negative consequences. This is important because the United States has
pursued and will continue to pursue a wide range of arms control and
nonproliferation objectives.]{.underline} The United States is a
signatory of treaties dealing with weapons of mass destruction, missile
technology, land mines, and cluster munitions, not to mention the flow
of conventional weapons of all kinds. The effectiveness of these
treaties, and the ability to create more effective and enduring arms
control and nonproliferation frameworks, however, depends on how the
United States behaves. So far we have argued that arms sales lack a
compelling strategic justification, amplify risks, and generate a host
of unintended negative consequences. These factors alone argue for
significantly curtailing the arms trade[. But the case for doing so is
made even stronger by the fact that greatly reducing arms sales would
also produce two significant benefits for the United States that cannot
otherwise be enjoyed.]{.underline}

#### Saudi won't prolif -- US checks

door to Saudi Arabia building nuclear weapons, deputy energy secretary
says," CNBC, 2/16/19,

**[A representative of the United States government said Saturday that
it would not help Saudi Arabia develop nuclear technology]{.underline}**
without guarantees that it would only be used for civilian purposes.
Saudi Arabia has put the U.S. on a shortlist with China, Russia and
others to bid for nuclear power projects in the country. [Washington
sees Saudi Arabia as a big customer of American nuclear expertise and
hardware, but lawmakers from both U.S. political parties are demanding a
deal be based on tough controls]{.underline}. [Section 123 of the United
States Atomic Energy Act of 1954, titled "Cooperation With Other
Nations," sets an agreement for cooperation as a prerequisite for
nuclear deals between the U.S. and any other nation.]{.underline} Under
a "123 measure," [any U.S. nuclear deal with Saudi Arabia would prohibit
routes toward the making of nuclear weapons by banning enrichment of
uranium or the reprocessing of plutonium.]{.underline} Speaking to
CNBC's Hadley Gamble at the Munich Security Conference on Saturday, the
U.S. Deputy Energy Secretary Dan Brouillette, said such an agreement was
imperative to any nuclear deal with Riyadh. **["We won't allow them to
bypass 123 if they want to have civilian nuclear power that includes
U.S. nuclear technologies."]{.underline}** The senior energy official
said as countries pursued more environmentally friendly and
emissions-free technologies, nuclear had to be a part of the
conversation. **[And while countries should pursue nuclear energy
technologies they must do so under a U.S. regime that prevents the
proliferation of nuclear weapons.]{.underline}** "As you know this
technology has a dual use and in the wrong hands it becomes a dangerous,
dangerous world," said Brouillette. The Saudis have so far refused to
rule out their right to enrich uranium for nuclear weapons, pointing to
neighboring Iran's ability to do so under the 2015 nuclear agreement
that world powers struck with Tehran. In an interview in March on [CBS's
"60
Minutes"](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/saudi-crown-prince-talks-to-60-minutes/)
Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman said the country wasn't
interested in developing weapons but would develop nuclear capability
should Iran ever develop a working nuclear bomb. On Sunday, Saudi
Arabian Prince Turki Al-Faisal responded directly to Brouillette's
words, saying the country had more options than just U.S. technology.
"Well the nuclear energy market is open. It is not just the United
States that is providing nuclear technology," he told CNBC's Hadley
Gamble in Munich. "We have France, we have Russia, we have China. We
have our friends in Pakistan and in other places as well, so if they
want to remove themselves from that market, well, that's up to them."

### Inevitable

#### Saudi prolif is inevitable -- foreign tech providers and secret cooperation

DS) \*note: not in this card, but a good empirical example of Saudi
Arabia secretly buying weapons was them purchasing Chinese missiles in
1988

[Yet this misses the point when it comes to **Saudi Arabia**: it is
going to get nuclear reactor technology **one way or another**, whether
it comes from the United States or other eager suppliers listed
earlier]{.underline}. An international embargo on nuclear cooperation
with Saudi Arabia is simply not a viable political option; indeed, much
of the nonproliferation regime is premised on the notion that states
that make nonproliferation commitments should be able to benefit from
peaceful nuclear technology (Article IV). [As aparty to the
Nonproliferation Treaty since 1988, Saudi Arabia is likely to find
willing sellers of nuclear reactors, so long at it appears to be
devoting its program to peaceful purposes]{.underline}. [With Saudi
officials]{.underline} carefully [laying the groundwork to
justify]{.underline} the aboveboard [peaceful pursuit of nuclear
reactors, **uranium ore** extraction, and]{.underline} perhaps even
**[enrichment tech]{.underline}**nology, Washington should be under no
illusions about its unilateral ability to inhibit Riyadh's nuclear
trajectory in the absence of a nuclear cooperation framework. The
subsequent evolution of the Saudi nuclear program will depend upon the
[geostrategic interests of the suppliers that rush in to fill the
vacuum]{.underline}. To be sure, [**Russia** and **China** may want to
sell the Kingdom complete packages of nuclear fuel cycle
services]{.underline} that would undercut the need for indigenous
enrichment. But it is hard to anticipate the level of influence Moscow
or Beijing would be willing and able to wield over Riyadh's nuclear
ambitions; the same goes for South Korea. If Saudi Arabia finds itself
with few constraints over the pursuit of enrichment technology, it could
even seek out offers from foreign suppliers to openly build fuel
enrichment plants in the Kingdom. Nuclear nonproliferation expert and
former U.S. government official Fred McGoldrick points out that for
almost four decades, no member of the venerable Nuclear Suppliers Group
(NSG) has "transferred enrichment or reprocessing technologies to
countries that did not already possess these capabilities." 62 Although
it currently adheres to NSG guidelines, [Pakistan may be willing to
supply centrifuge technology]{.underline} down the road (as it has in
the past) if it fails to gain NSG membership.63 In September 2015, for
instance, [a former Pakistani official suggested]{.underline} that
Islamabad should offer "[civilian nuclear cooperation to developing
countries, including]{.underline} Islamic countries \[e.g., [Saudi
Arabia]{.underline}\]," by setting up procurement channels outside of
the NSG.64 Once Saudi Arabia builds up its nuclear reactor base and
uranium extraction program, it would then be in a prime position to
integrate Pakistani centrifuge technology into the front end of the
nuclear fuel cycle. Indeed, there are longstanding rumors to the effect
that [Pakistan and Saudi Arabia might engage in **secret nuclear
cooperation**]{.underline}; and while the possibility of an outright
transfer of Pakistani nuclear weapons to Riyadh may be far-fetched,
[aboveboard collaboration on dual-use nuclear technology like enrichment
certainly is plausible]{.underline}.65

### No Prolif

#### Saudi will not be able to proliferate because of section 123 under the AEA 

**Powell 2019** (Jacob Powell, news editor for Middle East Eye, "Nuclear
weapons proliferation: Fears to increase if US sells technology to Saudi
Arabia", Middle East Eye, February 24 019,

Speaking at an event hosted by the Arab Center Washington DC last week,
[Robert Jordan, former US ambassador to Saudi Arabia under President
George W Bush, Said: "If the transfer has already occurred, or is being
discussed, it's likely in violation of the Atomic Energy Act section
123.]{.underline}" [The Atomic Energy Act]{.underline}, which came into
law in 1954[, stipulates that a US president must obtain congressional
approval of nuclear trade agreements. Within that law is a section known
as 123, which prohibits recipient countries from using purchased nuclear
technology to develop weapons programmes]{.underline}. "[To put it more
simply, congressional approval is]{.underline} generally [required
before these deals can enter into force, and without a nuclear
cooperation agreement, you can't engage in nuclear commerce with the
recipient country,"]{.underline} said Fuhrmann. On Saturday, US Deputy
Energy Secretary Dan Brouillette said the US will require Saudi Arabia
to agree to section 123. \"[We won\'t allow them to bypass 123 if they
want to have civilian nuclear power that includes US nuclear
technologies,]{.underline}\" Brouilette told CNBC.

["Saudi Arabia does not want to acquire any nuclear bomb, but without a
doubt, if Iran developed a nuclear bomb, we would follow suit as soon as
possible," Crown Prince Muhammad bin Salman told CBS News during an
interview last week]{.underline}. That remark set off alarm bells in the
West, and media ran with stories about a "nuclear arms race," with
headlines like "Saudi nukes on Chinese rockets" and "Can America prevent
Saudi Arabia from going nuclear?" Now, members of Congress are throwing
cold water on any deal the Trump administration might make with Saudi
Arabia about enriching uranium for nuclear power generation. [There's
one problem with all the hype: Saudi Arabia is years from getting
anywhere close to a nuclear weapon. The crown prince's discussions about
a nuclear weapon to counter Iran is not the first time the Saudis have
been pressed on this issue. ]{.underline}Prince Turki al-Faisal, a
diplomat, said in 2014 that the kingdom needed nuclear "know-how" to
counter Iran. In 2015, during the lead-up to the Iran deal, there was
buzz about a Riyadh "arms race" with Iran. Saudi ambassador to the US
Adel Al-Jubeir was asked about his country building a bomb. "This is not
something we would discuss publicly," he told CNN. "The Kingdom of Saudi
Arabia will take whatever measures are necessary to protect our
security[." Pundit Fareed Zakaria pointed out in 2015 that Riyadh's
plans were smoke and mirrors. "Saudi Arabia hasn't even built a car," he
noted. "The country's education system is backward and dysfunctional,"
he asserted, claiming that it relies on foreign workers for most
things.]{.underline} The kingdom first began exploring a nuclear power
program in August 2009 and it set up the King Abdullah City for Atomic
and Renewable Energy in 2010 to develop plans for the future. In 2011,
Riyadh announced plans to build 16 nuclear reactors over 20 years.
Construction was supposed to begin in 2016, according to an article by
the World Nuclear Association[. Saudi Arabia is a signatory of the
Treaty on the Nonproliferation of Nuclear Weapons and has met the
safeguards related to the treaty. While it envisioned its first nuclear
power plants providing electricity by 2032, according to reports,
estimates now think they wouldn't be ready until
2040.]{.underline} Nevertheless, according to an article by the Nuclear
Threat Initiative last year, Saudi Arabia has made agreements with
France, Argentina, South Korea and Kazakhstan regarding nuclear
cooperation. ["There is no credible evidence that Saudi Arabia has ever
seriously pursued a nuclear weapon program," the Nuclear Threat
Initiative wrote. Therefore, the stories about a "nuclear arms race,"
are largely an illusion. There is no race.]{.underline} Iran has a
sophisticated nuclear program at numerous sites which goes back decades.
It has uranium mines, three uranium-enrichment plants and a nuclear
reactor. Construction at the Bushehr-1 reactor in Iran first broke
ground in 1975 but wasn't opened until 2011. Iran has plans for numerous
more reactors. [Other countries' nuclear programs generally took years
to build a weapon.]{.underline} Pakistan's began in 1972 and the first
test was in 1998; North Korea's took from 1963 to 2006; India's from
1967 to 1998; UK's from 1940 to 1952; China's from 1958 to 1964;
France's from 1945 to 1960[. Saudi Arabia is mostly paying lip service
to the Iran nuclear arms race issue as a way to get the US to take the
Iranian threat seriously. ]{.underline}This may have backfired a bit,
because Saudi Arabia's enemies in the region, including Iran and
increasingly Qatar as well, have sought to portray the crown prince as
stoking "instability," "unrest" and removing "consensus" in the kingdom.
After the nuclear issue came up on the eve of the crown prince's major
visit to the US, Rep. Ileana Ros-Lehtinen, the chairwoman of the House
Foreign Affairs Subcommittee, said that "the idea of Saudi Arabia having
a nuclear program with the ability to enrich is a major national
security concern." [But long before Saudi Arabia gets anywhere close to
a nuclear weapon there would be serious ramifications in the region. Any
concerns that countries might have with the threat would therefore only
exist in a matter of years, if not a decade.]{.underline}

#### Saudi Arabia lacks the resources to proliferate

**NTI 2016**, Saudi Arabia,
https://www.nti.org/learn/countries/saudi-arabia/nuclear/, 7-28-2019,
updog

[Saudi Arabia possesses only a rudimentary civil nuclear infrastructure,
and currently lacks the physical and technological resources to develop
an indigenous nuclear weapons capability.]{.underline} Allegations that
Saudi Arabia has sought to acquire nuclear weapons in the past have
never been substantiated publicly. Saudi Arabia acceded to the Treaty on
the Nonproliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT) as a non-nuclear weapon
state in 1988 and since 1999 has expressed its support for the
establishment of a WMD-free zone in the Middle East. While the last
decade has witnessed growing speculation about how Saudi Arabia might
respond to Iran's controversial nuclear program, most [experts agree
Riyadh remains unlikely to pursue nuclear weapons for the foreseeable
future, even if a nuclear-armed Iran were to emerge]{.underline}. In
recent years Saudi Arabia has expressed interest in an ambitious agenda
to expand its civil nuclear power program, but it remains unclear
whether its plans will come to fruition.

### No Impact

#### Saudi will only proliferate for defensive purposes preventing any chance of Saudi starting war.

Physical Society,

Indeed, members of [the Saudi]{.underline} regime have, on other
occasions, [made it clear that their interests in nuclear energy derive
from the idea that it would help **them acquire the capability to make
nuclear weapons and match Iran**]{.underline}, [whose regional status is
seen to have risen as a result of its uranium enrichment program, even
though it is now apparently limited by the Iran nuclear
deal.]{.underline} When confronted with the economic superiority of
solar energy, some nuclear power advocates argue that the comparison is
not relevant because solar energy is intermittent, i.e., it can only be
generated when the sun is shining. But this argument is misleading,
especially in the case of Saudi Arabia, for three reasons. First,
intermittency begins to affect cost of maintaining the reliability of
the grid even mildly only when the fraction of electricity being
generated by such intermittent sources of energy becomes significant,
say around 20 percent. Given that solar energy generated a mere 0.04
percent of all the electricity generated in Saudi Arabia, its capacity
can expand by a factor of about 500 before any investment has to be made
in balancing for intermittency. Second, for the foreseeable future,
Saudi Arabia will be generating electricity from natural gas and diesel
based plants, and these are flexible enough for their outputs to be
increased and decreased according to whether solar plants are not
producing or generating electricity at any given time. Thus, the
fraction of solar can be considerably higher before intermittency begins
to pose an economic problem. Finally, the costs of storage technologies,
such as batteries, are falling rapidly and might already be becoming
cheap enough that solar energy will be economically competitive even
after the addition of storage. Given this clear economic advantage for
solar energy, the question to ask is: If Saudi officials are indeed
interested in reducing reliance on hydrocarbons and meet growing
electricity requirements, why are they not aggressively investing in
solar energy? Another reason for Saudi interest in nuclear technology.
Saudi officials have made it clear on more than one occasion that there
is another reason for being interested in nuclear energy technology,
which was not captured by the royal decree on the Saudi nuclear program:
the relationship of that program to nuclear weapons. [In March 2018,
Prince Mohammed bin Salman told CBS News, "Saudi Arabia **does not
want** to acquire any nuclear bomb, but]{.underline} without a doubt
**[if Iran developed a nuclear bomb, we will follow]{.underline}** suit
as soon as possible." The key phrase is "as soon as possible."
Developing nuclear weapons quickly will require that Saudi Arabia put in
place the necessary wherewithal. This is where nuclear energy seems to
come in.

#### No link and turn -- no prolif from US pull out, and US presence encourages latent Iranian prolif which is inherently more destabilizing 

**Porter 2018** (Patrick Porter, professor of International Security and
Strategy, \"Desert Shield of the Republic? Realism and the Middle East

mmv)

[A further rationale for staying is the fear that withdrawal would lead
to a nuclear proliferation cascade, involving at a minimum both Saudi
Arabia and Iran, along with a general arms race]{.underline}. This
argument draws on the logic that U.S. security guarantees -- and the
threat of withdrawal- dampen down fears and thus inhibit allies from
pursuing the bomb, while its forward presence enables it to suppress the
proliferation efforts of adversaries. Withdrawal would lead to reactive
proliferation. This possibility cannot be dismissed. Allies may be
motivated to seek the ultimate self-help in the event that their
protector retires. And, in an action-reaction cycle, Iran might seek the
same protection. [Two major aberrations confront this argument. As we
have seen, Israel disobeyed U.S. demands that it refrain from crossing
the threshold. Secondly, U.S. and allied hostility is a major driver of
Iranian nuclear proliferation, whether latent or
full-blown]{.underline}. [Sanctions, threats and negotiations may have
made possible the JCPOA with Iran, but as with terrorism, this was
action to suppress a threat that forward presence helped
create]{.underline}. Furthermore, recent scholarship77 suggests that
[U.S. guarantees are not necessarily a decisive inhibitor, and it is not
clear that distancing would make a great difference]{.underline}. [Even
after withdrawing, the U.S. would still have access to a range of tools
to inhibit proliferation, with sanctions, economic carrots and sticks,
and threats of force]{.underline}. Furthermore, [a common objection to
abandonment would be increased Russian or Chinese encroachment. If so,
proliferation activity would likely attract their attention, and
preventive efforts]{.underline}. The cure of putting up with all else in
order to constrain proliferation may be worse than the disease. As the
work of Nuno Monteiro and Alexandre Debs demonstrate, [a mere security
commitment is not enough to prevent proliferation]{.underline}.78 The
weaker ally must be confident enough that the ally would not abandon it.
Alternatively, threats of abandonment could work but would have to be
credible. The kinds of commitments that are needed to reassure Riyadh
enough to prevent it proliferating would need to be even stronger than
Washington's current relationship, to the point of tolerating all of the
pernicious behaviours above. [That very tolerance would then strain the
credibility of threats to withdraw. That existing commitments are not
enough is demonstrated by the fact that Saudi Arabia is already
accelerate its civilian nuclear development as a hedge to possible
Iranian nuclearization]{.underline}.79 Alternatively, [an unmistakable
threat of withdrawal would be needed to coerce client states away from
proliferation]{.underline}. [But Washington would have to mean it to
make it credible, precisely the real threat of unreliability that
primacists warn against in their enthusiasm for steadfast alliance
commitment]{.underline}. This is not the equivalent of iron-clad
commitments to more stable, responsible allies like West Germany or
Japan. It is rather an iron-clad commitment to a regime whose interests
-- as it defines and pursues them -- are sharply at odds with America's.
Possible proliferation is important but not all-important. [It is
conceded that abandonment would raise the odds of increased interstate
competition, thereby raising the odds of reactive proliferation
attempts, even while abandonment and counter-proliferation are not
necessarily mutually exclusive. If so, the question is whether staying
put in order to lower the probability of proliferation further is worth
the considerable costs that the United States pays, up front and in the
course of staying. The verdict here is negative]{.underline}. If it
comes down to it, [a more nuclearized Middle East would be a reality
Washington and probably the regional states could learn to live
with]{.underline}, [as with Central Asia]{.underline}, another
nuclearized region that hegemonic efforts failed to avert. Indeed,
[there is every possibility of proliferation under U.S. hegemony, a
phenomenon we have seen before, as opposed to proliferation as a
consequence of withdrawal]{.underline}. If anything, [arguments for
proliferation in Tehran will now be stronger rather than weaker, given
the abrogation of the JCPOA, an agreement that was coerced out of Iran
at significant costs and concessions]{.underline}. [America's
willingness to topple regimes that have either disarmed or not acquired
a nuclear weapon, along with the dumping of this nuclear agreement, and
mounting hostility will all tilt the debate at least towards latent if
not actual proliferation]{.underline}. [If so, it is not hard to imagine
Saudi Arabia doubting U.S. guarantees, and seeking insurance in its own
nuclear deterrent, possibly from a Sunni donor state like
Pakistan]{.underline}. The dividend for taking the risks of abandonment
would be a step towards solvency, and a greater ability to preserve the
republic, to which we now turn.

### Pakistan Alliance

#### Pakistan - Saudi relations are not reliable and are doomed to collapse

The former Saudi intelligence chief Prince Turki bin Faisal once
described [ties between Pakistan and Saudi Arabia]{.underline} as
["probably one of the closest relationships in the world between any two
countries without any official treaty." The]{.underline} intimate
[friendship goes back decades.]{.underline} In 1969, Pakistani pilots
flew Saudi jets to thwart Yemeni incursions into the kingdom. Islamabad
and Riyadh closely coordinated support for the mujahideen in the war
against the Soviet occupation of Afghanistan in the 1980s; and during
that decade, Pakistan stationed upwards of 15,000 troops in the kingdom.
Pakistani troops returned to Saudi Arabia during the first Gulf War to
protect it from an Iraqi invasion. And Saudi Arabia reportedly donated
oil supplies to Pakistan after Islamabad was hit by sanctions for
conducting nuclear tests in 1998. Last week, [Pakistani Prime
Minister]{.underline} Nawaz Sharif [assured Saudi King]{.underline}
Salman bin Abdulaziz [that the full resources of Pakistan's army are
behind him as the kingdom attempts to quash Yemen's Houthi
rebellion]{.underline}, which receives some support from Iran. But don't
expect Pakistan to go all-in on Saudi Arabia's war. Sharif understands
that he must walk a tightrope when it comes to this particular regional
conflict. [News reports]{.underline}, particularly from the Saudi-owned
Al Arabiya, [have claimed active Pakistani involvement in]{.underline}
Operation Decisive Storm, as [the anti-Houthi operation]{.underline} is
called. [Pakistan is said to have already dispatched jets and naval
ships to take part in the operations.]{.underline} These reports may be
part of a Saudi strategy to compel Pakistani involvement. Alternatively,
some elements of the Pakistani government may have brashly made specific
pledges of support to the Saudis, either due to Riyadh's pressure or a
desire to keep it happy. But if Islamabad did indeed assent to Saudi
requests, domestic and regional realities may have forced it to
backtrack, with the Pakistani defense minister stating just days later
that his government has not made a decision to send troops to Saudi
Arabia. That reversal may have been something Islamabad, which has been
reluctant to involve itself in Saudi Arabia's wars, desired anyway.
Sharif's moral support for the Saudis is clear. And he has tilted his
country toward the regional Saudi-led Sunni bloc. But the costs for
direct involvement are greater for Pakistan than for any other coalition
member. Pakistan shares a 565-mile-long border with Iran and relations
between the two countries have long been rocky. If Iran starts to view
Pakistan as an active adversary, it has many opportunities to cause
trouble across the border that Sharif cannot afford. Sharif chaired a
five-and-a-half-hour-long meeting of senior civilian and military
officials last Thursday to discuss his country's role in the Yemen
conflict. After the meeting, Defense Minister Khawaja Asif, who, along
with National Security Advisor Sartaj Aziz, visited Riyadh on Tuesday,
said that Pakistan would defend Saudi Arabia against any threat to its
territorial integrity. But he also claimed that Pakistan is not joining
any war. Earlier in the day, Sharif said in a statement that there is no
room for sectarianism in Pakistan, comments which were likely influenced
by the reports of his country's involvement in the Yemen war. This is
all part of Sharif's now well-established pattern of accommodating some
Saudi demands, while also wisely resisting actions that would further
antagonize Iran or strain Pakistan's resources. In recent years,
Islamabad has balked at Saudi requests for assistance, including for the
deployment of 15,000 Pakistani troops to the kingdom in 2014. This is in
part because roughly 30 percent of Pakistan's active-duty troops have
been deployed in the country's northwest since 2009 fighting against the
Taliban insurgency. Troop levels along the Afghanistan border will
remain constant until 2019, leaving Pakistan with a reduced presence
along its tense eastern border with India --- and few troops to spare
for anywhere else. But [even if the officials in Riyadh were able to
convince Sharif and his generals to dispatch Pakistani forces to the
Persian Gulf, such a force would likely be limited in its
mandate.]{.underline} Pakistan could send a modest contingent of
soldiers and even pilots to Saudi Arabia, but [any Pakistani assistance
will be likely restricted to Saudi territory.]{.underline} It is
difficult to imagine Pakistan engaging in any activity on sovereign
Yemeni territory. In recent years, [Pakistan has been responsive to
Saudi inducement --- but only up to a point.]{.underline} Last year,
after a flurry of visits by Saudi and Pakistani officials to their
respective capitals, Pakistan received a grant of \$1.5 billion ---
described by the Pakistani finance minister as "gift" with no strings
attached. Islamabad initially kept the source of the aid secret, but
later revealed that the donor was Riyadh. The donation was made after
Pakistan, in a joint statement with Saudi Arabia, abandoned its policy
of non-interference in Syria, calling for the formation of a
"transitional government" in the civil war-ravaged country. Subsequent
media reports claimed that Pakistan provided anti-aircraft and anti-tank
weapons, including the Chinese-made FN-16, to Syrian rebels via Saudi
Arabia and dispatched small numbers of trainers at the request of
Riyadh. There have also been claims, mainly attributed to unnamed Saudi
officials, that Pakistan could transfer a nuclear weapon to Saudi
control or include Riyadh under Pakistan's nuclear umbrella should Iran
near or cross the nuclear threshold. Such reports, not so
coincidentally, have appeared during negotiations between Iran and the
West, and are likely part of a Saudi policy of nuclear ambiguity
designed to compel Washington to take a harder line against Tehran. The
first senior Pakistani official to meet King Salman after he took the
throne in January was Gen. Rashad Mahmood, the chairman of the Joint
Chiefs of Staff, who has operational control over Pakistan's nuclear
weapons. Mahmood briefed Sharif before the president embarked on his
visit to Saudi Arabia to meet with the new king. Whether or not nuclear
cooperation was actually on the agenda, the meeting was likely meant to
signal to Tehran and Washington that the Saudis could be interested in a
nuclear weapon of their own. [Pakistan,]{.underline} which obtained
nuclear weapons in the late 1990s, [is unlikely to ever transfer a
warhead to Saudi soil.]{.underline} Islamabad has assiduously worked
toward becoming recognized as a legitimate, responsible nuclear power
and has sought membership in the Nuclear Suppliers Group.\* Giving
nuclear technology to Saudi Arabia would undermine these efforts. Still,
[Islamabad has and will continue to allow itself to be used in Riyadh's
posturing toward Tehran and Washington with exaggerated claims of
Pakistani nuclear and conventional military assistance.]{.underline} In
all of these cases, it becomes clear that **[Pakistan will aid Saudi
Arabia but only in ways that will not distract from or exacerbate
Islamabad's primary security threats.]{.underline}** And that's
precisely why Sharif and his government cannot afford to provoke Iran
right now. Tehran has a number of levers it can use vis-à-vis Islamabad.
It could, for example, charge Pakistan penalties for failing to complete
construction of a gas pipeline the two countries agreed to build in
2013. The accord mandated that Pakistan complete its portion of the
pipeline by the end of 2014 and includes daily penalty charges of around
\$3 million in case of failure to do so. Islamabad, due to pressure from
Washington, has yet to construct its portion of the pipeline. Fines
haven't been levied, though Iran has rejected Pakistani claims that they
have been formally waived. More worrisome is Tehran's ability to play
the sectarianism card. Pakistan, with over 4,000 deaths from
Sunni-Shiite violence since 2007, is struggling to put the genie of
sectarianism back in the bottle. [Iran could add to Pakistan's woes by
using its proxies inside Pakistan to step up the targeted killings of
Sunni militants and religious scholars, some of whom have come out in
support of Saudi Arabia in recent days.]{.underline} Iran could also
increase its clandestine operations in Pakistan and Afghanistan. In
recent years, Iranian assets have reportedly assassinated a Saudi
intelligence official and Pakistani Sunni leaders in Karachi, But
Iranian activity in Pakistan today is characterized by relative
restraint compared to the 1980s, when Iran sought to export its
revolution to Shiites across the world, including in Pakistan, where
upwards of 20 percent of the population comes from Islam's smaller sect.
Iranian agents could also play a more active role in sectarian conflicts
inside Pakistan and Afghanistan, where there has been an uptick in
sectarian violence in recent months. Or Iran could partner with India to
support political forces in Afghanistan hostile toward Pakistan. Sharif
understands the dangers. His government must attempt to defuse relations
with Tehran in order to have stability at home. The prime minister
visited Iran last May and declared that he was ready to "open a new
page" in relations between the two countries. That might be a bit
ambitious. The close relationship between Sharif, the Pakistan Army, and
Riyadh means that they can never fully gain the trust of Tehran. But
Sharif can at least hope to keep relations with Iran drama-free. [The
Saudis have been there for Pakistan through thick and thin, and
Islamabad has little choice but to provide limited assistance to Riyadh
in response to its perceived threat from the Houthis in Yemen. But it
can assuage Iranian concerns by continuing to engage it on securing
their shared border, opening up a bilateral dialogue on stabilizing
Afghanistan, and perhaps even positioning itself as an intermediary
between Iran and Saudi Arabia. Pakistan, ravaged by terror for more than
a decade, can ill-afford to become the next playground for an
Iranian-Saudi proxy war. Nearly everyone in Pakistan, including the
major Sunni parties, realizes this and opposes Pakistani intervention in
Yemen. And so the Pakistani premier will continue to walk this
tightrope.]{.underline}

### Impact Turn

#### Saudi prolif prevents nuclear war and caps regional escalation in the Middle East

DS)

Moreover, if Iran achieved nuclear capability, the situation in the
region would exceed the model of extended deterrence. Over the past year
President Obama has repeatedly warned that nuclear weapons in Tehran's
hands could create an incentive for other countries in the region to
develop military nuclear capabilities. The Saudis have stated publicly
that if Iran acquires nuclear weapons, they will be forced to obtain
similar capabilities. According to Dennis Ross, President Obama's former
advisor on Iran, the Saudis have conveyed the same message in closed
talks with US representatives.1 Since [**Saudi Arabia** has a close
connection with the regime in Pakistan]{.underline} and a nascent
nuclear infrastructure, the main risk is that [it will **purchase**
Pakistani **nuclear weapons**]{.underline} or that it will be covered by
the Pakistani nuclear umbrella, and within a short time the Middle East
will become a region that has three countries believed to possess
nuclear capabilities. In this scenario, there will be simultaneous
deterrence regimes between Saudi Arabia and Iran, Saudi Arabia and
Israel, and Iran and Israel. Joining this would be the impact of US
deterrence policy during a crisis. This dynamic is complicated, and the
traditional bilateral analysis, including use of the extended deterrence
model, is not sufficient to explain it. There are both threats and
opportunities inherent in this multilateral deterrence regime, which
have not yet been discussed in depth. A Nuclear Iran: Threats and
Opportunities In classic deterrence, the main challenge for the
defending party is to convey a clear and consistent message to the
attacking party about the forbidden action and the price for carrying it
out. In multilateral deterrence, on the other hand, the challenge for
the defending party is to convey this message simultaneously to a number
of countries with different, and sometimes contradictory, world views
and interests. This is particularly important because any message will
be examined by the other actors in the arena. Any Saudi statements for
example, will be interpreted at the same time in Washington, Tehran, and
Jerusalem, although not necessarily in the same way. Each party will
seek to threaten with the intention of deterring the other three
parties, but without causing them an excess of insecurity, which is
liable to push them into a preemptive strike in order to damage the
enemy\'s capabilities. Thus, for example, a conciliatory message from
one country could be interpreted by a second country as weakness or by a
third country as manipulation intended to camouflage a plan to attack.
[As a result of crossed wires and mixed signals, the risk of escalation
will increase, even though none of the parties is interested in
escalation. This challenge becomes more complicated]{.underline} in the
Middle East, [where there is poor communication between
states,]{.underline} and especially between Israel and Iran, [which do
not have diplomatic relations. In a nuclear Middle East, the **lack of**
direct and effective channels of **communication** between countries
could encourage them to receive mistaken assessments of enemy
intentions, **read the situation incorrectly**, and attack the enemy out
of fear that will attack first]{.underline}. Another problem is
connected to the relativity of the threat. In the bilateral model of
deterrence, the credibility of the defending party's deterrent messages
depends on its ability to cause intolerable damage to the attacking
party. [**In multilateral deterrence** regimes, however, the threat is
not absolute, but is measured against the other threats in the
arena]{.underline}. Tehran would compare the Israeli threat with the
Saudi threat and the American threat. This equation could have a
decisive impact, for example, in the event of a conventional conflict
between the United States and Iran. The challenge for Israel would be to
present a threat of significant damage, in addition to the damage that
could be inflicted by the impressive US military capabilities, in order
to influence the decisions in Tehran and prevent it from dragging Israel
into the conflict. Saudi Arabia could encounter a similar challenge in
the event of a conflict between Iran and Israel. [Along with threats
that undermine strategic stability, this complex environment could
provide]{.underline} a number of [opportunities that,]{.underline} if
used correctly, [would make it possible to **reduce the
instability**]{.underline} somewhat. The different countries' fear of a
common enemy could encourage them to cooperate and increase their
independent deterrence capability. Thus, for example, [Israel and Saudi
Arabia could cooperate against Iran]{.underline}, with each capitalizing
on its respective advantages. Israel has a modern army and stronger and
more precise firepower than Saudi Arabia, while [Saudi Arabia has a
geographic and political advantage in a military operation]{.underline}
against Iran. If the two countries decided to join together, they could
present a significant threat to Iran, greater than the threat that
either could present by itself Another opportunity is to cooperate in
developing "deterrence by denial," primarily active protection
capabilities. [In the context of **deterrence**, these **capabilities**
are supposed to reduce the benefit to the attacking party and as such,
to influence its considerations]{.underline}. It receives legitimacy and
broad international support because it enables coping with threats using
methods that are defensive and not offensive. Active protection
capabilities are not only a deterrent tool; they also make it possible
to address the threat and reduce the pressure on decision makers in
formulating a response when deterrence fails. [They can thus help **keep
escalation limited** and controlled and prevent all-out **war** between
**nuclear** states, which could be a **regional disaster**]{.underline}.
The Arrow system, for instance, [could be a critical restraining factor
in]{.underline} the event of [escalation]{.underline} between Jerusalem
and Tehran if Iran possesses nuclear weapons.

#### Saudi Arabia uses weapons to balance out regional instability 

**Lippman 2008** (Thomas W. Lippman, journalist specializing in Saudi
Arabian affairs, former Middle East bureau chief of the Washington Post.

Although it was a longtime strategic partner of the United States and a
Cold War bulwark against communism, [Saudi Arabia incurred the wrath
of]{.underline} the administration of President Ronald [Reagan by
clandestinely acquiring at least 36 CSS 2 intermediate range ballistic
missiles from China.]{.underline} (Some estimates put the number as high
as 60.) The missiles, behemoths weighing nearly 70 tons with a range of
about 1900 miles, were stationed in remote areas of the Kingdom and
maintained by Chinese crews. Washington was not informed, and learned of
the deployment only by accident. The Saudis declined to permit American
officials to inspect the missiles. [From the Saudi perspective the
acquisition made sense. Elsewhere in the Gulf region, the ballistic
missile era had already arrived. The Kingdom's neighbors, Saddam
Husayn's secular, anti-monarchical Iraq and Ayatollah Ruhollah
Khomeini's anti-Saudi revolutionary Iran, were at the time hammering
each other with missiles in their long war; Egypt, Syria, Yemen, and of
course Israel also had surface-to-surface missiles. Saudi Arabia, always
insecure and fearful of encirclement, had no comparable
capability.]{.underline}There was no prospect of purchasing intermediate
range missiles from Saudi Arabia's preferred military supplier, the
United States, because missiles that could strike Tehran also could
reach Israel. The Saudis knew from the hostile reaction in Congress to
their earlier efforts to acquire sophisticated weaponry that a ballistic
missile sale would never be approved by Congress even if the Reagan
administration endorsed it. China was under no such constraints as a
vendor; and while the Chinese were communists and at that time not
welcome even to visit vigorously anti-communist Saudi Arabia, they had
no record of armed invasion of a Muslim country, as did the Soviet
Union. As usual in Saudi Arabia, strategic self-interest trumped taboo.
From the American perspective, the Chinese missile deal appeared
dangerous and destabilizing in several ways, even apart from the
potential menace to Israel. It accelerated the Middle East missile race.
[It demonstrated a streak of independence and duplicity that Washington
did not anticipate from Riyadh.]{.underline} It introduced China as an
arms supplier to a country that had made opposition to communism a
cornerstone of its long relationship with the United States. And most
alarming, in all other known deployments, the CSS 2 carried nuclear
warheads. Because of the CSS 2's inaccuracy, it is of little use in
striking specific targets, and therefore has military value only as a
delivery system for nuclear, chemical, or biological warheads, for which
precision targeting is much less important than it is for conventional
weapons. The arrival of such missiles in Saudi Arabia was seen in
Washington as an indication that the Saudis might be secretly pursuing
nuclear weapons --- perhaps even planning to allow other Arab countries
to use them to attack Israel, deploying the feared "Islamic bomb." The
Israelis warned that they might attack the missiles to preclude any
possibility that they would face a nuclear-armed Arab foe --- a serious
concern for Washington, given that Israel had bombed a nuclear reactor
(Osirak) in Iraq a few years earlier. American diplomats scrambled to
pursue a complicated agenda with several moving parts: persuading the
Israelis not to attack; making clear their displeasure with Saudi Arabia
without disrupting an important strategic and commercial relationship;
and persuading Congress not to cut off arms sales to the Saudis.
According to the late Hume Horan, who was US ambassador in Riyadh at the
time, "The Israelis told us, let it be known, that we better do
something about those missiles or they would. We told the Saudis that
there are nations in the area that are very concerned and threatening to
take matters into their own hands."\[1\] Discovery of the missiles
ignited a predictable storm in Congress. Within a few weeks, bipartisan
majorities in the House and the Senate had approved resolutions opposing
the sale of ground support equipment for Airborne Warning and Control
System (AWACS) planes the United States had sold to Saudi Arabia in
1981. The administration postponed formal notification to Congress of a
new sale of \$450 million worth of military equipment. Secretary of
State George P. Shultz traveled to Riyadh to seek a gesture that would
quell the anti-Saudi clamor --- namely, accession to the NPT. The United
States was "highly concerned" about Saudi deployment of the CSS 2,
Assistant Secretary of State for Near East Affairs Richard Murphy told
Congress at the time, because "We had known it only in its nuclear
capable mode in China." [According to Murphy, who had previously served
as US ambassador to Saudi Arabia, "The Saudis took what was available in
deciding to join the group of missile-possessing states in the region
that included Iran, Iraq, Syria, as well as North Yemen and Egypt, among
others. Iran's repeated use of missiles against Kuwait and the firing of
a Scud missile at Kuwait's oil facilities on April 20, 1988, as well as
attacks upon Iraq and reports about possible attacks upon Saudi targets
simply underscored the justification in Saudi eyes for their acquistion
of a system to counter missiles in unfriendly hands."]{.underline}Murphy
told the House Foreign Affairs Committee that the Saudis "have assured
us, at the level of the King, that they do not have and they have no
intention of acquiring either nuclear or chemical warheads." The
assurances took the form of a letter from King Fahd to President Reagan,
Murphy said. The decision to sign the NPT represented "a change in
longstanding Saudi policy and a serious international commitment which
should further assure neighboring countries of Saudi Arabia's ultimate
interest in stability in the region," Murphy told the committee.\[2\]

Concerted international efforts to keep Iran a non-nuclear weapon state
might seem to constitute good news for Saudi Arabia, Tehran's top rival
for leadership in the Middle East. Instead, [the Saudi government is
deeply disturbed by a recent interim agreement between Iran and the
so-called P5 + 1 countries---the United States, Russia, China, the
United Kingdom, France, and Germany]{.underline}. The six-month
agreement freezes Iran's enrichment of nuclear fuel above the level
needed for commercial nuclear power, halts development of the
plutonium-production-capable Arak nuclear plant, and gives International
Atomic Energy Agency inspectors greater access to Iran's declared
nuclear facilities. [In return, the P5 + 1 has agreed to lift some of
the sanctions that have nearly crippled Iran's economy]{.underline}.
[The reason for Saudi anger is complex]{.underline}: [Riyadh fears a
US-Iran détente at least as much as an Iranian bomb, and those concerns
have led some prominent Saudis to talk openly about the possibility the
kingdom will obtain nuclear weapons.]{.underline} This is talk that the
United States should take seriously. [The kingdom has embarked on a
commercial nuclear power program that makes little economic sense, but
could, if it becomes reality, aid a Saudi nuclear weapons program. It is
vitally important to the security of the Middle East that Iran not gain
access to nuclear weapons. It is just as important that Saudi Arabia
remain a non-nuclear-weapon nation.]{.underline} Saudi unease, nuclear
hints.The Saudi leadership has witnessed major regional shifts over the
last decade: the fall of Saddam Hussein's regime in Iraq; Iran's
expanding power in Iraq, Syria, and Lebanon; and, more recently, the
successive waves of an Arab Spring that has challenged and sometimes
deposed leaders across the Middle East. Rapprochement between the United
States and Iran would further strengthen Iran's position in the region.
[The Saudi leadership, therefore, feels the need for a long-term
security solution that is in their hands and under their
control]{.underline}. [The first public hint by Saudi officials that the
kingdom would consider acquiring a nuclear weapon as a counterweight to
Tehran's nuclear program came in June 2011]{.underline}. Speaking at the
Molesworth Royal Air Force Base in England, Prince Turki Al-Faisal, the
former head of Saudi intelligence, said: "[It is in our interest that
Iran does not develop a nuclear weapon, for their doing so would compel
Saudi Arabia, whose foreign relations are now so fully measured and well
assessed, to pursue policies that could lead to untold and possibly
dramatic consequences]{.underline}." In May 2012, Dennis Ross, a senior
US diplomat and a former envoy to the Middle East, confirmed that in
April 2009 King Abdullah explicitly told him, "[If they get nuclear
weapons, we will get nuclear weapons]{.underline}." Meanwhile,
**[balancing Iran's power]{.underline}**, even if it means developing a
nuclear weapon, is increasingly mentioned in the Saudi and Arab media.
Abdul-Rahman Al-Rashed, a prominent Saudi journalist, recently wrote:
"[If the United States allowed Iran to develop a nuclear weapon**, it is
our right then to protect ourselves by means that would preserve the
balance of power between the two countries,** as Pakistan did to face
the Indian nuclear threat]{.underline}." Questions about Saudi Arabia's
nuclear intentions were greatly magnified in November when the BBC
published a lengthy investigative report about an alleged, implicit
agreement between Pakistan and Saudi Arabia, in which a variety of
sources---including Pakistani and Western government
officials---concluded that [the kingdom "could obtain a bomb at
will."]{.underline} That report quoted Amos Yadlin, a [former head of
Israeli military intelligence, as saying that Saudi Arabia has "already
paid for the bomb" through its investments in Pakistani nuclear
projects.]{.underline} Israeli voices have often expressed their fear of
a Saudi nuclear weapon, giving more force to Riyadh's warnings and
exerting pressure on Washington and the international community to stop
Iran's nuclear program. Yoel Guzansky, a researcher at the Institute for
National Security Studies at Tel Aviv University, wrote: "[The kingdom
may conclude that its security constraints as well as the attendant
prestige and influence generated by having a bomb outweigh the political
and economic costs it will pay]{.underline}." The US-Saudi relationship
is a major factor in Riyadh's calculations of its security needs. The
United States has maintained a strategic military presence in Saudi
Arabia since Iraq's invasion of Kuwait in 1990. Added to the continued
American supply of weapons to the kingdom, this presence has created
what was once perceived as an unshakable alliance and partnership.
Recent differences over Syria, Egypt, and Iran's nuclear program have,
however, led to serious strains in that relationship. Prince Bandar Bin
Sultan, a well-connected former Saudi ambassador to Washington and one
of the kingdom's foreign policy makers, indicated that the kingdom would
make a "major shift" in relations with the United States in protest for
its inaction over Syria and overtures to Iran. Despite 34 years of
increasingly stringent economic sanctions and diplomatic pressure, Iran
today is a stable country of expanding power in the region. The Saudis
are surely contemplating what would happen if stringent economic
sanctions were fully lifted, and Iran became a country with friendly
ties to the United States and other major powers. Saudi Arabian
officials have said the country would seek nuclear weapons if Iran
acquired them. [There is also an unfortunate but real possibility that
t**he kingdom would seek the bomb to counterbalance the influence of
Tehran**,]{.underline} even if Iran and the P5 + 1 came to a permanent
agreement that purported to force Iran to give up nuclear weapons
efforts. Where would a Saudi bomb come from? [If Saudi Arabia were to
acquire a nuclear weapon, many observers have suggested that it would
come from Pakistan, on which the Saudis have lavished billions of
dollars in aid since the 1960s. More important, the kingdom has
allegedly contributed to financing Islamabad's nuclear program and
maintains strong links with the Pakistani military and
intelligence]{.underline}. Despite the close ties between the two
countries, however, Pakistan is unlikely to supply Saudi Arabia directly
with a nuclear weapon. Islamabad is quite aware of the diplomatic and
economic sanctions it would incur, if the international community
discovered that it had provided the Saudis with a working bomb. Although
it is unlikely that nuclear weapons sit in Pakistan, waiting to be
shipped to Saudi Arabia, [the kingdom could turn to nuclear power as a
path toward nuclear weapons]{.underline}. With access to sensitive parts
of the nuclear fuel cycle, the kingdom would be able to obtain
weapon-grade uranium and plutonium to serve a clandestine nuclear weapon
program. Then, the help of Pakistani scientists and engineers would come
in handy. Pervez Hoodbhoy, a renowned Pakistani physicist and defense
analyst, argues: "Saudi Arabia will likely find engineering and
scientific skills from Pakistan particularly desirable. As Sunni
Muslims, Pakistanis would presumably be sympathetic with the kingdom's
larger goals." Saudi Arabia has had a longstanding, although limited,
interest in nuclear technology. Over the decades, the arguments by
nuclear power advocates typically stressed the country's growing demand
for electricity and desalinated water. The Saudi nuclear program took
physical form in 2010, with the establishment of King Abdullah City for
Atomic and Renewable Energy (KA-CARE) in Riyadh. In 2012, the
organization came out with its first set of projections, which
envisioned that by 2032, out of a total 123 gigawatts of electricity
generation capacity in the country, 18 would be contributed by nuclear
power. The country also has ambitious plans to develop alternative
energy sources, particularly solar. An ongoing study conducted by M.V.
Ramana and the author at Princeton University showed that the economics
of nuclear-generated electricity in Saudi Arabia is questionable.The
presence of large reserves of natural gas---even though only 15 percent
of Saudi Arabia has been explored for gas---and the promising prospects
for solar power, given the kingdom's obvious geographic advantage in
that field, make nuclear power an economically unsuitable option in
Saudi Arabia. Hence, the ambitious projections laid out in 2011 may not
be realized. In other words, [Saudi Arabia\'s motivation for pursuing
nuclear technology is not based on a careful economic assessment of
energy options, but on more complex security and political
calculations.]{.underline} We note, also, that it is quite common for
countries to start with very ambitious nuclear construction plans, but
these are seldom realized. Despite the traditional and deliberate
ambiguity in the rationale of decision-making in the kingdom, [the Saudi
leadership is serious about acquiring a nuclear weapon if Iran succeeds
in developing one]{.underline}. The implications of the recent agreement
between the P5+1 and Iran will certainly intensify Saudi's insecurity.
The continuation of the Iranian nuclear program, be it under the
international umbrella or not, is perceived by Riyadh as a major, and
perhaps existential, threat. Consequently, the risk of nuclear
proliferation and an arms race in the Middle East must not be dismissed
during talks with the Saudis about their nuclear power program.

the other. On foreign policy, too, Putin seems to have two faces. The
pragmatic [Putin wants to work with the US in dealing with common
problems. But]{.underline} [another]{.underline} Putin [views the US as
a hostile power that is trying to destabilize]{.underline} Russia, and
is happy to do things -- like sheltering the fugitive Edward Snowden --
that infuriate it.¶ [In Moscow, both opposition leaders and the more
liberal government officials agree that the need for political and
economic change is greater than ever]{.underline}, but that the chances
of serious reform are close to zero. After mass demonstrations in the
winter of 2011-12, optimists thought the regime would attempt to win
back the support of the middle classes by modernising the country's
governance. But these days nobody expects much to change. ¶ [Russia's
leaders worry that big economic or political reforms could upset vested
interests,]{.underline} create losers and perhaps strengthen the
opposition. The government has in fact attempted some reforms of the
university, school and healthcare systems, in order to save money, but
these have been unpopular. Reform of the pension system -- which would
mean curbing pension rights -- has been mooted for over a decade but
frequently put off. There always seems to be an excuse for postponing
major reform.

#### Russia seeks alliance with, not displacement of, the West in the Middle East -- no transition wars

On Nov. 20, 2017, Russian President Vladimir Putin and Syrian President
Bashar al-Assad issued a joint statement from the Black Sea resort town
of Sochi about the end of Russia's military operations in Syria. The two
leaders stood calmly together in a conference room flanked by men in
uniform whom Putin introduced as those who "played a decisive role in
saving Syria." Putin reassured his audience that he and Assad had
discussed all the relevant aspects of "the normalization of the
situation" in Syria; the leaders then took turns thanking the Russian
troops for their bravery and sacrifices in the fight against terrorism
and for creating the conditions for sustained political dialogue. Putin
and Assad's statement from Sochi, reinforced by Putin's
highly-publicized triumphant tour of Russia's Middle Eastern allies in
Syria, Egypt, and Turkey this week, was meant to be yet another rebuttal
to former U.S. President Barack Obama's 2015 warning that a limited
bombing campaign in Syria would suck Russia into a "quagmire." But it
also produced a shift in the Western media coverage of a conflict that
for years had emphasized Assad's culpability for, and Putin's complicity
in, the bombarded buildings, sarin gas attacks, mass displacement of
refugees, and torture hospitals that have been a feature of Syria's
civil war. Now that the war has turned decisively in Assad's favor, it
has become permissible to portray the Syrian and Russian presidents as
symbols of some sort of stability. No such shift was necessary for
Russian state-controlled television, which for years has propagated the
Kremlin's preferred "clash of civilizations" justification for military
intervention in Syria. Political commentators like the influential
Channel One host Vladimir Posner have emphasized Syria's proximity to
Russian and Central Asian borders as well as the potential threats posed
by the large Muslim population inside Russia. Speaking in October 2015
to a group of fans at his Moscow restaurant, Posner warned, "Let's not
wait until the fire comes home to us.... ISIS is not a country that can
be occupied ... it has a strong ideology, and we need to show them that
God is not on their side." The Russian media treatment of Syria has
remained too insulated for too long from the larger international
dialogue about the war and Russian-American relations[. The West would
clearly benefit from a better understanding of the Russian perspective
--- which is not to suggest that the Russian media's portrayal of the
country's Middle East strategy should be taken at face
value]{.underline}. Fortunately, a far more sober and comprehensive
account of the Russian government's objectives in the region, and its
blind spots, is available in form of Dmitri Trenin's short new book,
What Is Russia Up to in the Middle East? Trenin is well positioned for
the job of explaining Russia to the West. During the Cold War, he served
for 21 years in the Soviet military, five of those years in military
intelligence as a liaison officer in the "external relations" branch of
the Group of Soviet Forces in East Germany and as member of the Soviet
delegation to the nuclear arms talks in Geneva in the late 1980s. Since
his retirement at the rank of colonel, he became the first Russian
director of the Carnegie Moscow Center, a regional affiliate of the
Carnegie Endowment for International Peace and the first major Western
think tank to open in Russia after the breakup of the Soviet Union.
Since its inception, the Carnegie Moscow Center has been committed to
improving U.S.-Russian relations through promoting greater knowledge in
the West of Russia's policy interests, goals, and developments. Its
secondary goal has been to set forth a model for independent policy
research and debate in Russia. (Both aspects of its mission seem to have
the tacit approval, if not endorsement, of the Russian government: A new
law passed in 2012 requires all nonprofits receiving donations from
abroad to publicly declare themselves "foreign agents," but despite
receiving generous foreign grants, the center has been left off the
official lists of "undesirable organizations.") [To explain what Russia
is up to in the Middle East, Trenin first criticizes the Cold War
"prism" that is favored by Russia critics such as American consultant
Molly McKew, who has argued, "We won the last Cold War. We will win the
next one too." As Trenin cautions, this viewpoint creates misleading
expectations in a new world characterized by the absence of an iron
curtain, the peripheral rather than pivotal global importance of the
U.S.-Russia relationship. It also creates misleading expectations about
Russia, which is no longer the ideological revolutionary regime it once
was. Rather, Trenin argues, Russia must be regarded as a country that is
integrated into the global capitalist economy and global information
space.]{.underline} There, it fights for survival as a major independent
geopolitical entity against the far superior forces of its competitors.
Above all else, Trenin suggests using language borrowed from U.S.
President Donald Trump: **[Moscow today is interested in "making
deals."]{.underline}** In the new world order, history matters. Not only
do "historical legacies" shape the context of current policymaking but,
as Trenin further argues, contemporary Russia is also "becoming
increasingly conscious of its historical roots." The history that Trenin
brings to bear on the current crisis in the Middle East ranges from the
Christianization of Kievan Rus in the 10th century to Russia's betrayals
by the West after 9/11. This story is mostly one of Russia's
unapologetic expansion guided by the need to gain access to the sea in
the south as well as the north. Peter the Great engaged the Ottomans in
the Black Sea; Nicholas II entered World War I motivated by a desire to
extend Russia's control to the Bosphorus and the Dardanelles; Stalin
demanded special privileges in the Turkish Straits after the end of
World War II, a miscalculation that Trenin concludes "helped throw
Ankara into Washington's arms." This history contains some disturbing
omissions. He suggests a causal link, for example, between Israel's
failure to fulfill Soviet diplomatic expectations and Stalin's
anti-Jewish campaign of the early 1950s. This is troubling, not least
because it flagrantly overlooks the documented purges of Jewish
intellectuals during the Soviet Union's anti-cosmopolitanism campaigns
of the 1940s, among many other earlier expressions of anti-Semitism.
Trenin is correct, however, in suggesting that the most relevant
historical experience for understanding Moscow's present approach was
the "blunder" of the Soviet Union's 1979 invasion of Afghanistan. [That
war, Trenin argues, indelibly shaped Russian views about the
interconnectedness of Russia's domestic and foreign Muslim populations:
The Afghan War for the first time demonstrated to Moscow the strength of
Islamist radicalism and the power of cross-border Muslim solidarity. It
also taught it to regard alliances and alignments in that part of the
world as essentially tactical and easily shifting, with no permanent
friends and no eternal enemies.]{.underline} That experience would come
in handy soon, as the Soviet Union began to unravel.... In Tajikistan
and then in the North Caucasus, Russia confronted an enemy that bore
close resemblance to the Afghan mujahedeen. It is understandable why
Trenin focuses on the lessons of the "foreign" war instead of the
"domestic" wars in Chechnya. History of the latter has now been
rewritten as a decisive victory for Putin culminating in the passage of
a Moscow-backed constitutional referendum and the election in 2003 of a
pro-Moscow regional president, Akhmad Kadyrov. Yet despite that powerful
narrative of victory, Trenin's portrayal of the essential porousness of
foreign and domestic politics in "that part of the world" --- like
Russian pundits' insistence on drawing attention to domestic threats
when talking about Syria --- suggests that anxieties about hijackings,
car bombings, kidnappings, and other ghosts of the Chechen wars continue
to haunt contemporary Russian politics. [These anxieties about the
Muslim world, both "internal" and "external," become sublimated in
Russia's obsession with using foreign policy to promote and defend its
sense of civilization]{.underline}. This does not always take the form
of strictly military intervention. In May 2016, the Mariinsky Orchestra
performed Bach, Prokofiev, and Rodion Shchedrin amid the ruins of
Palmyra shortly after Assad's forces pushed the Islamic State out of the
area. (The iconic concert was conducted by Putin's longtime associate
Valery Gergiev; the premier cellist was another billionaire friend of
Putin's whose banking details came under scrutiny in the Panama Papers,
Sergei Roldugin.) According to the New York Times, the version of the
concert broadcast on Russian television was spliced with footage of
Islamic State atrocities and concluded with Putin thanking the musicians
from his vacation home on the Black Sea for offering "hope that our
contemporary civilization will be relieved from this horrible disease,
international terrorism." To some observers, this performance seemed
like an encore of Gergiev's 2008 concert in Tskhinvali, the devastated
capital of South Ossetia. There, against a backdrop of bombed-out
buildings, the Mariinsky performed Tchaikovsky's Fifth Symphony and
Shostakovich's Seventh Symphony, which had been previously broadcast
during the Nazi siege of Leningrad. The Palmyra concert reclaimed
another destabilized eastern territory in the name of Russia's
civilization. The Russian Embassy in Washington made the same argument
explicitly in October 2016[. After then-U.S. Secretary of State John
Kerry expressed his concerns about Russian fighter jets' bombardment of
Aleppo as harking back to a similar strategy used by the Kremlin in
Chechnya, the embassy tweeted images of Grozny rebuilt with billions of
dollars from Moscow and the Gulf above the caption: "Ain't that a
solution we're all looking for?" The projection of Russian civilization
into new spaces, both domestic and international, serves also to
heighten the Kremlin's concerns about reaction by the West's own
political civilization]{.underline}. Moscow's interpretations of the
protests in Tunisia and Egypt as the continuation of the "color
revolutions" that swept through Belgrade, Georgia, Ukraine, and
Kyrgyzstan in the 2000s, and the association of these revolutions with
the protests in Russia in 2011 and 2012 and Kiev in 2013 and 2014,
certainly informed Putin's calculations in Syria. Yet what finally
pushed him to intervene, as Trenin suggests, was Libya. There, Russia
had retained several post-Soviet contracts for arms sales and
infrastructure projects totaling around \$7 billion. [Hoping to partner
with the West, Russia refrained from blocking a United Nations Security
Council resolution declaring a no-fly zone just as Muammar al-Qaddafi
was mounting a counteroffensive.]{.underline} These actions resulted in
regime change and the disintegration of the Libyan state, an outcome
that confirmed to Russia that the United States had no compunctions
about going beyond the limits set by U.N. resolutions, and that
Americans were unable to foresee even the most immediate consequences of
their actions. [After this betrayal, according to Trenin, Russia started
blocking any resolution that might have constituted a pretext for
foreign military intervention in Syria and supplying Assad with
arms.]{.underline} It was not until August 2013, after the chemical
attack in Syria that forced Obama to accept Putin's proposal to rid
Syria of chemical weapons, that America finally started to deal with
Russia as an equal. [What would it take to build trust? If we take Putin
and Trenin at their word, Moscow is seeking an alliance with the United
States that would require a fundamental shift in Western perceptions of
Russia from that of competitor to that of a partner in the fight against
global terrorism]{.underline}. [What Russia has to offer to this
partnership is outlined in the remaining chapters of Trenin's book: its
"stunning" ability to **build coalitions and negotiate** across the
"seemingly unbridgeable divides" of Middle Eastern politics]{.underline}
--- [between Sunnis and Shiites; Israel and the Palestinians; Israel and
Iran; Iran and Saudi Arabia; Turkey and the Kurds; and the rival
governments in Tripoli and Tobruk in Libya]{.underline}. Yet taking this
deal would require a show of good faith in Putin's definitions of
terrorism and civilization, and in his narrative of what happened in
Syria as the safeguarding of the state and of political dialogue. This
dialogue, like Trenin's book, shows little interest in Syria's internal
dynamics, let alone in the voices of the many Syrians who had opposed
the Assad regime. Perhaps instead of looking at Syria as a "microcosm,"
as Trenin does, of a world order being reconfigured from U.S. hegemony
to a multipolar system that includes Russia, we might see it as place
defined more by the interests of the Syrians themselves, including those
of returning refugees. That would mean approaching the future not as a
process of Washington's "normalization" of the Kremlin, as Trenin
suggests, but rather difficult, long-term reconciliation on the part of
the United States and Russia both.

### No War

#### **Russia has no interest in escalating tensions in the Middle East.**

Accuses the US of Escalating Tensions in the Middle East"; 6/20/2019;

[Russia slammed on Thursday the U.S. decision to send additional Patriot
missile systems and unmanned aerial vehicles]{.underline} (UAV) [to the
Middle East]{.underline}. Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Sergei Ryabkov
told reporters in Sochi that this move meant escalation of the situation
in the region. \"This is a reflection of the line on conscious
escalation,\" [Ryabkov said.]{.underline} [\"We have no doubt that the
political and military leadership of the United States does not stop at
any action in order to complicate the situation to the maximum and, most
importantly, to increase pressure on Iran,]{.underline}\" he said.
Ryabkov called on to strengthen the security measures in the Persian
Gulf region. [The region may be plunged into a new conflict and it would
be \"absolutely unacceptable, given the severity of the consequences of
such a development,\" he warned. He said: \"We have taken an interest in
the recent proposal of the Iranian foreign minister, Mr. \[Javad\]
Zarif, to conclude a **non-aggression pact between the Gulf countries.**
\"This is a productive idea,\"]{.underline} he said. Tensions are high
between the U.S. and Iran since Washington unilaterally withdrew last
year from a nuclear pact between the Islamic Republic and the five
permanent members of the UN Security Council plus Germany. President
Donald Trump\'s administration has pursued a number of actions meant to
scuttle the agreement, including the re-imposition of U.S. sanctions on
Iranian oil. In response, Tehran vowed to continue exporting oil despite
the U.S. sanctions and threatened to close the Strait of Hormuz if it is
prevented from using the strategic waterway.

#### No US-Russia war 

**O'Hanlon and Zeigler, 7/13** \[Michael E. and Sean, senior

Increasingly in U.S. national security circles, it has become common to
hear talk of a new Cold War with great-power rivals. But [this way of
thinking is imprecise]{.underline} at best, [dangerous]{.underline} at
worst. A distinguished group of American experts has just warned against
such thinking in regard to China, lest it create a self-fulfilling
prophecy. However unbecoming Vladimir Putin's rule may be in Moscow, [we
need]{.underline} a similar [corrective for how we think about
Russia.]{.underline} The Trump administration's 2018 National Defense
Strategy, like the second-term Obama administration's "Third Offset"
concept, usefully reemphasizes deterrence of great-power conflict. There
can be no doubt that Russia and China have both behaved in a much more
assertive and threatening manner in recent years. But the United States
has a tendency to overdo such policies. In the case of Russia, while
NATO's modernization efforts, and its modest military reinforcements in
places like the Baltic states and Poland are welcome, we must avoid a
pervading mentality that anticipates a struggle with the Kremlin at
every turn. COLD WAR RHETORIC ABOUT RUSSIA IS MISCONCEIVED The dangers
and fallacies of thinking in Cold-War, zero-sum, and military-first
policies towards Russia are several-fold. First, today's
[Russia]{.underline}, while both vindictive and ambitious, [has nothing
like the global ambitions of the Soviet Union.]{.underline} While it
expresses a sense of betrayal by the West[, it evinces no grandiose
concept for worldwide conquest.]{.underline} As authors such as Timothy
Snyder and Robert Kagan rightly argue, there can be a sort of
authoritarian contagion that leaders like Putin could spread. But
[this]{.underline} is hardly akin to the Kremlin's Marxist-Leninist
ambitions for conquest during the Cold War. Second, a Cold-War-like
[attitude ignores how much we are still working with Russia on key
global security concerns. Russia's role is]{.underline} especially
[important given its veto powers at the United Nations Security Council,
crucial for policies such as imposing sanctions on threatening nations.
If there is someday to be a new deal with Iran to supersede the 2015
Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, or if there is to be a negotiated
denuclearization plan of some sort with North Korea, Russia's support
will be crucial.]{.underline} Despite troubled relations in recent
years, [Moscow generally has supported American policy at the United
Nations]{.underline} in regard to these countries. [Even in places where
Russian policy is distasteful, or even reprehensible, such as in Syria,
it will be far easier to solve problems if we can de-conflict our
approaches with Moscow]{.underline} --- and in fact, certain types of
military deconfliction have been taking place for some time there,
making possible the defeat of the ISIS caliphate. Third, for all the
debate about NATO's lack of adequate seriousness when it comes to
defense burden-sharing, the alliance remains impressive. Although only 7
countries meet the official goal of spending at least 2 percent of GDP
on their armed forces, NATO collectively accounts for more than half of
all world military spending. Most members have significantly increased
their defense budgets since the Crimea crisis of 2014. NATO has also
deployed enhanced forward presence battalions to the Baltic states and
Poland. They do not constitute a robust defensive perimeter, but they at
least represent a stronger tripwire than before. NATO would do well to
make its reinforcement capabilities for this region more robust, but it
is hard to see Mr. [Putin]{.underline} really believing he could get
away with an all-out invasion, even today. So far, he has [cautiously
avoided any military excursions into NATO countries]{.underline}.
Fourth, European nations do not get enough credit for the sustaining
their [sanctions]{.underline} [on Russia]{.underline} as a result of its
aggressions against Ukraine. Over the last half decade, largely as a
[result]{.underline}, [the]{.underline} [Russian economy has essentially
gone flat.]{.underline} Gross domestic product and foreign direct
investment in Russia have both declined since its Crimean invasion. Not
only has this outcome delivered a useful punitive blow against Putin and
many of his cronies, [it has quite possibly helped dissuade any further
Russian aggression,]{.underline} be it against Ukraine or Georgia or
even a Baltic state, adding another dimension of deterrence to what NATO
is doing militarily. A greater integration of economic and military
measures of deterrence should be pursued in the United States and NATO,
as one of us has recently argued in a new book, The Senkaku Paradox.
More credible policies are needed in particular for limited and
grey-area conflict zones. Such scenarios do indeed remain worrisome, as
Russia continues to engage in disinformation campaigning and election
meddling --- but these efforts should not be confused with the
existential risks of the Cold War.

#### No risk of Russia conflict or expansion 

**DePetris 2/22**

(Daniel; "Russia is weak, contrary to popular belief"; The National
Examiner; 02/22/2019;
<https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/opinion/russia-is-weak-contrary-to-popular-belief>;
Accessed 07/28/2019; JY)

The rhetoric from Vice President Mike Pence and Secretary of State Mike
Pompeo in Poland on Feb. 13 was part ritual solidarity to NATO and part
warning to Russian President Vladimir Putin that any aggression in
Eastern Europe will be met with a unified response from the 29-member
alliance. "Russia has grand designs of dominating Europe and reasserting
its influence on the world stage," Pompeo said during his tour of a NATO
battle group in Orzysz, Poland. "Vladimir Putin seeks to splinter the
NATO alliance, weaken the United States, and disrupt Western
democracies." This is precisely the kind of language the foreign policy
elite in Washington love to hear. Outside of politics, however, this
kind of talk reeks of desperation, not strength, and gives Russia far
more credit than it deserves. In the Beltway, U.S. policy on Russia is
one subject that unites almost everyone. Putin is caricatured as half
strategic genius, half big, bad wolf. The reality is far different.
Sure, Putin is not rooting for America's success. A skepticism and
cynicism of U.S. motives is ingrained in Putin's mentality regardless of
who occupies the Oval Office. On everything from Ukraine and
Afghanistan, to election meddling and assassinations of Russian
dissidents in the West, the Russian leader has no problem breaking
international law and treaty commitments if it's in Russia's national
security interest, and his self-interest, to do so. [But to equate the
Russia of today to the Soviet Union of yesterday, as so many U.S.
officials and lawmakers are quick to do, is absurd on its face. It **is
pure threat inflation**]{.underline}. Is Russia a bully in its region?
The answer is self-evident. But is Moscow getting ready to colonize the
Baltics and Eastern Europe as Pompeo seemed to allege during his trip to
Poland? Of course not. [Despite Putin's machismo, Russia is a state
resting on a brittle foundation. The Russians are still recovering from
a three-year recession, driven in large measure by U.S. and EU sanctions
and lower crude oil prices. Moscow remains beholden to selling its
natural resources in order to raise cash for a budget increasingly
weighed down by pensions, mandatory entitlements, and
welfare]{.underline}. As the World Bank wrote in a December report on
the Russian economy, "progress in export diversification is limited,
with the share of oil/gas products still totaling a high 59 percent in
exports of goods in 2017; about 25 percent of fiscal revenue." Another
World Bank report published in January finds that net capital outflows
reached \$72 billion, the highest they've been since 2014. In a bid to
save money, Putin signed a law that reforms the pension system by
raising the retirement age by five years for both men and women.
Protests inevitably broke out from Moscow and St. Petersburg to cities
along the Black Sea. [Russia's public infrastructure and social services
are an embarrassment.]{.underline} Entire sections of the Russian
countryside don't have access to basic medical care. [Putin's Ukraine
adventure, which the Washington establishment typically considers a
Russian achievement, is a drag on Moscow's finances as well; the
separatists he supports have no economy to speak of, which means Russian
taxpayers are required to pick up the tab and supply the area with
everything from food kits to electricity]{.underline}. [None of these
expenses help Russia's GDP, which at \$1.58 trillion is smaller than
Italy's, the third largest economy in the European Union.]{.underline}
As far as that mighty Russian military we are supposed to be scared
about? Turns out it's not all that mighty. [Russian military spending in
2017 was \$66.3 billion, 7 percent of NATO's total defense expenditures
during that same year. Taking the U.S. share of the pot out of the
question, the rest of NATO still spent four times what Moscow allocated
on its military.]{.underline} If all NATO members actually met the 2
percent of GDP threshold each committed to, the ratio would be even more
lopsided. [What this shows is that Russia is a weak state compared to
the U.S., and in semi-desperate straits when compared to France,
Germany, the U.K., and even Italy.]{.underline} [Moscow is incapable of
posing a real threat to Europe. **Our allies, especially with U.S.
military backing, can easily contain Russia,** a declining power, even
if it is able to cause mischief and act out in ways we don't
like]{.underline}. Rather than deliberating over how many additional
U.S. troops should be sent to Europe, whether the U.S. should build a
permanent base in Poland, or whether Washington should add even more
resources into programs that seek to deter Russian intervention in
Europe, the Trump administration should continue to cajole and press its
partners in Europe to take more responsibility for their own security.
Some European countries are finally moving in this direction (although
it took some browbeating from the U.S. president to set the trend), but
they're not doing nearly enough. The shifting of the defense burden
should not only continue, but also accelerate. Europe is more than
capable of keeping Russia in check and defending itself, thanks to
decades of U.S. support. But the current path is a drag on the United
States while weakening Europe's political will to build up its own
self-defense capability. The more U.S. taxpayer money spent on
reassuring Europe, the less incentive European leaders will have to take
their security more seriously. The American public would be better off
if their political leaders assessed Russia through clear eyes and
appropriately shifted more of the burden of defending Europe to our
wealthy European allies, especially at a time with greater strategic
threats and \$22 trillion in debt.

#### Putin guarantees Russia's stable economy 

**Hobson, 15**

(Peter Hobson; "Putin Says Russian Economy Stabilizing"; Published:

[President Vladimir Putin on Tuesday strove to deliver a **positive
message on the economy**, even as output continues to shrink. "We have
**generally reached the peak of the crisis and overall our economy is
gradually adapting to these new economic circumstances,"**]{.underline}
Putin said during a speech at the VTB Capital "Russia Calling!"
international investment forum in Moscow. The Russian economy has been
wrestling since last year with sharp falls in the price of oil, its main
export, and Western sanctions over Ukraine. [Despite slumping output
across large swathes of the economy, Putin said **the situation was
stabilizing and showered praise on government and Central Bank
officials.**]{.underline} "Our management team in the economy has
demonstrated a high degree of responsibility, consistency and the
ability to achieve results," he said, **[adding that this was a sign of
Russia\'s investment attractiveness.]{.underline}** He reiterated that
Russia\'s economy would remain open, and there would be no capital
controls. [Putin pointed to a capital inflow of \$5.3 billion in the
third quarter --- Russia\'s first quarterly inflow for five years --- as
proof of the economy\'s strength. However, according to Central Bank
data, more than \$400 billion has flooded out of the economy since the
last inflow in 2010, and officials expect another net capital outflow in
the last quarter of this year.]{.underline} Putin also used his speech
at the forum to sound a soothing note on international issues, at a time
when Moscow\'s support for Ukrainian separatists and intervention in the
Syrian civil war have put many countries on edge. He said Nord Stream
II, a planned gas pipeline under the Baltic Sea to Germany, was not
aimed at undermining the role of any country in transiting gas to Europe
--- a reference to Ukraine --- and reiterated his commitment to imposing
the Minsk peace deal for eastern Ukraine, according to the Reuters news
agency. Meanwhile, he said Russia was not looking to take control in
Syria and called Turkey one of Russia\'s most important partners. Moscow
and Ankara have taken opposite sides in the Syrian conflict, where
Russian is using air strikes to support President Bashar Assad, and
Turkey has protested Russian violations of its airspace. [Putin\'s
bullish outlook on the economy echoed his speech at Russia\'s last major
investment forum in St. Petersburg in May, when he announced**, "We have
stabilized the situation**, absorbed the negative short-term
fluctuations, and are **now making our way forward confidently through
this difficult patch.\"**]{.underline} But while the initial shock of
sanctions and a falling oil price has passed, with Russia staving off a
currency collapse or meltdown of the banking system late last year, many
economic indicators have worsened in recent months. **[The county\'s
economic contraction accelerated from 2.2 percent year-on-year in the
first quarter to 4.6 percent in the second,]{.underline}** according to
official data, with investment, consumer spending and industrial output
falling sharply. The price of oil --- Russia\'s most important export
and the source of about 40 percent of budget revenue --- has decreased
from around \$65 per barrel in early summer to about \$50. The Central
Bank expects the economy to shrink by 4 percent this year, and contract
again in 2016.

(which is only a relatively small part of the economy) **to supposedly
be true for the whole economy.**]{.underline} These analysts completely
failed to recognize the glaring facts that on the other side of the
equation Russia's imports were the lowest in the world (in proportion to
size of population and economy). [The extraordinary low levels of
imports in a global comparison obviously signifies that Russia produces
domestically a much higher share of all that it consumes (and invests),
this in turn means that the economy is superbly diversified contrary to
the claims of the failed experts and policymakers. In fact, **Russia is
the world's most self-sufficient and diversified economy.**]{.underline}
Our argument that Russia's economy is the most diversified in the world
is easily proven by World Bank statistics on the share of imports of
goods and services as a percentage of the GDP. This is illustrated by
Table 2, which compares the levels of import of Russia with a sample of
countries[. It shows that Russia's imports as a share of GDP was as low
as 7.2%, while the corresponding level for Western European countries
was between 30 to 40%. However, to arrive at these figures we have
corrected a major flaw in the World Bank statistics. For some
incomprehensible reason the World Bank uses the nominal GDP as the
denominator, when the correct method would obviously require the PPP
adjusted GDP. (PPP for purchasing power parity). **The PPP adjusted GDP
indicates the size of a national economy in terms of its volume, while
the nominal GDP merely reflects its US dollar value at a given
date**]{.underline}. If we want to know what is the share of imports of
the total economy, we therefore must compare the imports with the volume
based PPP indicator. In keeping with the above, we have therefore
adjusted the data vis-à-vis Russia with the PPP GDP figure for the
relevant year. However, we have not gone through the exercise of doing
the adjustment for all the presented countries. By definition the
nominal and the PPP value of the U.S. economy is the same (as that is by
convention the country against which all others are compared), therefore
there obviously is no need to change anything for the U.S[. For the
other countries listed the nominal and PPP values were much closer with
a 0 to 10 % mark-up and therefore the given numbers fairly accurately
reflect the import share without any adjustments. This expecting Poland,
which we also adjusted for PPP with a ratio of 2 to 1. Even with the
flawed nominal GDP comparison, Russia's imports stood at the globally
low 21.1%.]{.underline}

### No Alliance

#### Saudi-Russia relations will never grow stronger because of competing geopolitical objectives in the Middle East -- Iran, Assad, and more.

The [combination of low oil prices, high US output and stagnant demand
seems to have brought together one of the most unlikely [diplomatic
pairings](http://www.reuters.com/article/us-oil-opec-russia-saudi-idUSKBN18S3Y3)
in recent years: Russia and Saudi Arabia]{.underline}. Earlier this
month, top officials including Saudi Deputy Crown Prince Mohammed bin
Salman and Russian President Vladimir Putin [held several
meetings](https://www.wsj.com/articles/russia-saudi-arabia-explore-expanding-oil-alliance-to-middle-east-troubles-1496344400)
in Moscow and St. Petersburg to discuss business deals and joint
ventures in Asia and also Middle Eastern political and security matters.
These meetings came after Russia and Saudi Arabia
[played](http://www.cnbc.com/2017/05/15/russia-and-saudi-arabia-have-more-reasons-to-extend-deal-than-just-oil.html)
a critical role in extending an agreement to prop up crude oil prices
between OPEC and non-OPEC producers. [All of this would have been an
unthinkable shift just two years ago when Russia was refusing to
cooperate with OPEC and even openly questioned its value]{.underline}.
The new collaboration between Moscow and Riyadh has been portrayed in
[some
corners](http://www.cnbc.com/2017/06/02/long-term-us-ally-saudi-arabia-fast-becoming-firm-friends-with-russia.html)
as more than just a shared need to drive up crude prices. Considering
how fluid the international order seems to have become, **[could there
be a major shift in relations between the world's two biggest oil
producers]{.underline}?[Probably not]{.underline}.** [Shared dependence
on oil is hardly a foundation for trust, let alone a budding
alliance]{.underline}. In truth, this month's meetings and the OPEC deal
are the exception, not the norm. [Fierce Saudi-Russian competition in
other key areas and Moscow's ties with Riyadh's sworn enemies -- above
all, Bashar Al-Assad and Iran -- have created a complex and understated
rivalry between the two nations.]{.underline} To be sure, there are
strong incentives for at least a limited détente between Riyadh and
Moscow. American shale has been
[hammering](http://oilprice.com/Energy/Crude-Oil/Saudi-Arabia-Surrenders-To-US-Shale.html)
the economies of Saudi Arabia, Russia, and other key oil producers. For
Saudi Arabia in particular, the twin blows of the shale revolution and a
failed strategy to exploit a plunge in oil prices forced a major rethink
in geopolitical and economic statecraft. The result was a new diplomatic
initiative that focused on diversifying commercial ties while
re-kindling old relationships and alliances. [Riyadh's teamwork with
Moscow on the latest OPEC deal is one concrete result of this
initiative, but the two sides are still in direct competition over key
markets]{.underline}. For instance, the
[competition](http://money.cnn.com/2017/06/02/news/economy/russia-china-energy-defterios/index.html)
between both countries to supply China's voracious appetite for oil is a
critical sticking point. The late King Abdullah's 2006 visit led to a
joint venture between Saudi Aramco and China National Petroleum
Corporation; since then, the desert kingdom has continuously worked to
increase oil sales to China. Most recently, King Salman's latest visit
to Beijing in March produced \$65 billion in [trade and
investment](http://www.reuters.com/article/us-saudi-asia-china-idUSKBN16N0G9)
agreements. Saudi Arabia has been courting China, among others, as a
possible investor for the upcoming
[sale](https://theconversation.com/how-the-aramco-ipo-will-make-history-and-transform-saudi-arabias-economy-75759)
of a 5% stake of Saudi Aramco's \$2 trillion worth of shares. That IPO
is a major part in the kingdom's efforts to diversify its economy. And
yet, Saudi Arabia's efforts to court China haven't caught up with
Russia's first-mover advantage. Moscow reached out in earnest to Beijing
after being hit with Western sanctions over the conflict in Ukraine in
2014. That year, Russia and China signed a 30-year deal worth an

\$400 billion to supply natural gas to the world's biggest emerging
market. Russia can claim the upper hand in China, but Saudi Arabia's
commercial diplomacy with traditional allies like the United Kingdom and
the United States has produced major successes by any measure. Britain,
for one, is in dire need of diversified commercial ties and clarity over
its place in the global economy as it prepares to exit the European

### Non-Unique

#### Russia already controls the Middle East -- US withdrawal would just be the icing on the cake -- impacts terminally non-unique

Four decades after the United States largely succeeded in sidelining the
Soviet Union in the Middle East and becoming the leading regional,
Russia is resurrecting its long-lost standing. The process of partial
American disengagement from the region that began under President Barack
Obama has further increased under President Donald Trump. [Indeed, if
things continue as is, Russia may soon supplant the United States.
Russia's growing influence is manifest across the region, from Morocco
to Iran]{.underline}. [This remarkable turnabout, part of Vladimir
Putin's overarching strategy of restoring Russia's standing as a great
power, has been the result of deft diplomacy combined with a willingness
to sell arms and nuclear power reactors to all askers]{.underline}.
While international attention has been focused on the Iranian nuclear
program, Russia has been playing an increasingly important role in two
other dangerous trends underway in the region: a massive conventional
arms race---\$1.3 trillion of arms bought by the Gulf states alone
between 2000 and 2014---and a dramatic push to procure nuclear power
reactors. All of the reactor programs reflect legitimate energy needs,
but "civil" nuclear programs in the Middle East have a nasty tendency to
morph into military ones. 10 SECONDS Do You Know What Happened Today In
History[? U.S. allies in the region today have become hesitant to
continue placing all of their strategic faith and security in American
hands. While they uniformly welcome President Trump's more hardline
approach, the scars of American weakness during the Obama years, as they
perceive it, have yet to heal. Moreover, Trump's unique character has
**engendered ongoing doubts regarding American trustworthiness**. For
the meantime, U.S. allies are hedging their bets. Egypt's anger over
what it viewed as insufficient American support for the Mubarak regime,
and subsequent sanctions on arms sales, led to a significant improvement
in its relations with Russia. A deal for four Russian nuclear power
reactors was concluded in 2017. Military ties have been restored,
including the sale of some dozens of advanced fighters, attack
helicopters and S-300 missiles, along with new joint military
exercises]{.underline}. Egypt has been the linchpin of American policy
in the region ever since it evicted the Soviets in the early 1970s. In
so doing, it created the basis for the three mutually reinforcing
pillars of U.S. Middle East policy to this day: the establishment of a
moderate, pro-American Arab camp with Egypt and Saudi Arabia at its
center; countering regional rogues such as Iraq, Iran and Libya with the
moderates' support; and the promotion of Arab-Israeli peace---again,
with moderate support. [An Egyptian-Russian rapprochement constitutes a
severe blow to American standing. For decades, an unwritten deal has
governed U.S.-Saudi relations; security for an assured supply of oil. In
1991, the United States even went to war in defense of Saudi Arabia.
Today, however, the Saudis are skittish. In 2017, King Salman bin
Abdulaziz Al Saud conducted the first ever visit of a Saudi monarch to
Russia. A deal was signed for highly advanced S-400 and anti-tank
missiles. A nuclear cooperation agreement was also signed, and Russia
hopes to provide at least two of the planned sixteen Saudi
reactors.]{.underline} Russia and Saudi Arabia---who together make up
approximately 20 percent of international oil production---have also
coordinated policy to raise the global price. [Russia's minimalistic
military intervention in Syria, with just two fighter squadrons, has
been remarkably successful, saving the Assad regime at virtually no cost
to Russia, which left the bloody ground fighting to Iran and
Hezbollah.]{.underline} Obama's self-enervating prognosis that Syria
would become Russia's Vietnam has been proven baseless. Russia has
become the primary player in Syria today, ensuring its long-term
presence there with a Syrian commitment to grant it air and naval
bases---from which it projects region-wide power---for forty-nine more
years. A country of little importance in and of itself to the United
States, [Syria has become the focal point of the most critical regional
issues, including the Sunni-Shiite confrontation, the war against ISIS,
Iranian expansionism, and a possible Iranian-Israeli conflict. Russia's
position in Syria provides it with **influence over all**. The U.S.
withdrawal from the Iran nuclear deal has driven Tehran even closer to
Russia, its longtime ally.]{.underline} Iran is counting on Russia to
help defeat the American sanctions regime and prevent any possibility of
military action against it. Russia has already supplied Iran with S-300
missiles, and sales of fighter aircraft, tanks and artillery once
Security Council mandated limitations expire have been mooted. [Russia
provided Iran with its sole nuclear reactor, and may sell a few more.
Turkey, for decades a virulently anti-Russian NATO ally, has been
cozying up to Moscow and appears to be going ahead with the purchase of
S-400 missiles over the vehement protests of its NATO allies. Morocco,
Bahrain and Qatar are also interested in the S-400. Russia signed a
large arms deal with the UAE and is exploring the possibility of gaining
access to naval bases in Libya.]{.underline} [A nuclear cooperation
agreement was signed with Tunisia]{.underline}. [Russia has also offered
Lebanon a large arms deal and is interested in air and naval bases there
too.]{.underline} Russia has cooperated overtly with Hezbollah in the
fighting in Syria, and Hezbollah itself now has Russian arms, presumably
supplied indirectly by Syria and/or Iran "without Russian knowledge."
Concomitantly, Russia has also succeeded in developing an increasingly
close relationship with Israel. [U.S. disengagement from Syria and its
withdrawal from the nuclear deal have had the practical effect of making
Russia a critical player for Israel. The prospects of an Israeli
conflict with Iran/Hezbollah in Syria, or with Iran over its nuclear
program, hinge significantly on the role played by Russia. Premier
Benjamin Netanyahu has now visited Putin in Moscow ten times in the last
two years alone.]{.underline} The diplomatic world, much like nature,
abhors a vacuum, and Russia has rushed to fill the void left by the
United States. A restoration of American primacy is possible, and would
be welcomed by allies, but would require three important changes in U.S.
policy. First, that the United States finally develop a strategy for
Syria. Certainly a hard call, but as Russia has proven, the United
States could be playing a far more effective role without risking major
involvement. Second, the adoption of a coherent U.S. policy towards
Iran. Not just a capricious withdrawal from the nuclear agreement,
followed by the enunciation of welcome but unrealistic objectives,
without preparing any policy options other than sanctions, or anything
that appears like a plan B---or even a plan A. Finally, maintaining the
close alliance with Israel, but also either pursuing an all-out attempt
to reach a breakthrough with the Palestinians, or a decision to make do
with conflict management in a way that does not further inflame matters.
Unfortunately, the prospects of any of this happening under Trump are
low. In the Middle East, [the Russians are back---and likely to
stay.]{.underline}

#### Their internal link scenario is non-unique -- Russia is making large investments in Saudi Arabia and Saudi Arabia is moving towards Russia already.

Russia and Saudi Arabia never enjoyed a cordial relationship. Back in
the early Cold War era, while the Soviets sided with Gamal Abdel
Nasser's Egypt and other secular nationalist regimes, the Saudis led a
rival coalition of conservative monarchies in league with the west.
Later, the Saudis, together with the Pakistani security services,
bankrolled and assisted the mujahedeen fighting the Soviet army in
Afghanistan. In more recent times, Russian authorities have viewed Saudi
Arabia, with whom they re-established diplomatic ties in 1990 after a
hiatus of 52
years,[\[1\]](https://research.sharqforum.org/2017/10/13/russia-and-saudi-arabia-at-a-turning-point/#_edn1)
as the exporter of extremist Islam to Muslims in the Northern Caucasus
and other parts of the federation. The pro-Kremlin media never miss an
opportunity to blast the U.S., the self-proclaimed advocate of democracy
and human rights, over its longstanding alliance with the Saudis. Not to
forget the war in Syria, in which Moscow and Riyadh are on opposite
sides. Furthermore, Russia's direct military involvement since September
2015 on the side of the struggling Assad regime has strengthened its
security links with Iran, Saudi Arabia's archrival in a contest
straddling the Middle East. When confronted with the grave humanitarian
consequences of the Russian campaign, the Kremlin propagandists point at
the civilian deaths and devastation caused by the Saudi-led coalition's
actions in
Yemen.[\[2\]](https://research.sharqforum.org/2017/10/13/russia-and-saudi-arabia-at-a-turning-point/#_edn2)
There is speculation that Russian hackers and fake news triggered Saudi
Arabia's spat with Qatar, driving a wedge within the Sunni bloc that is
opposed to
Assad.[\[3\]](https://research.sharqforum.org/2017/10/13/russia-and-saudi-arabia-at-a-turning-point/#_edn3)
In short, there are a legion of contentious issues. Now, however, [with
an unprecedented three-day visit by King Salman bin Abdulaziz to Moscow,
it seems]{.underline} [we have arrived at a turning point]{.underline}.
King Salman had been to Russia before -- as a governor of Riyadh in
2006. Putin, too, travelled to Saudi Arabia in 2007. But, as then--king
Abdullah never returned the
gesture,[\[4\]](https://research.sharqforum.org/2017/10/13/russia-and-saudi-arabia-at-a-turning-point/#_edn4)
Salman's visit is the first of its
kind.[\[5\]](https://research.sharqforum.org/2017/10/13/russia-and-saudi-arabia-at-a-turning-point/#_edn5)
To mark the occasion, Moscow hosted a week of Saudi cultural events.
Salman was welcomed by Putin, Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev and even
Chechen President Ramzan Kadyrov, the self-appointed leader of all
Muslims in the Russian
Federation.[\[6\]](https://research.sharqforum.org/2017/10/13/russia-and-saudi-arabia-at-a-turning-point/#_edn6)
[The visit broke news about major deals: a \$1.1 billion project for the
Russian petrochemical company Sibur to build a plant in Saudi Arabia, a
\$1 billion joint technology investment fund, and another \$1 billion
financing vehicle geared towards energy projects. Saudi investment to
the tune of \$200 million may flow into Russian toll roads, including a
new one in Moscow. There is also talk of Islamic banking projects to
benefit the large Muslim population of the Russian
Federation.]{.underline}[[\[7\]](https://research.sharqforum.org/2017/10/13/russia-and-saudi-arabia-at-a-turning-point/#_edn7)
Last but not least, a spokesman for Russia's Federal Service for
Military and Technical Cooperation declared that an agreement had been
reached for the sale of S-400 surface-to-air missile systems to Saudi
Arabia]{.underline}. This trip to Moscow did not come out of the blue.
It had been in the works since the first time King Salman and President
Putin talked on the phone in April 2015. Much of the groundwork of was
laid by Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, the Saudi family go-between
with the
Kremlin.[\[8\]](https://research.sharqforum.org/2017/10/13/russia-and-saudi-arabia-at-a-turning-point/#_edn8)
In September 2016, months before Mohammed's promotion to first place in
the line of succession, he and Putin negotiated Russia's accession to
the OPEC-agreed oil production limits. [A preliminary arms deal,
estimated at \$3.5 billion by state-owned industrial corporation Rostec,
followed suit in July
2017]{.underline}.[\[9\]](https://research.sharqforum.org/2017/10/13/russia-and-saudi-arabia-at-a-turning-point/#_edn9)
In parallel, the Saudis and the Russians have been chalking up progress
over Syria. A meeting between Russia and Saudi-backed Syrian opposition
in Cairo yielded agreements over the rebel-held enclaves of East Ghouta
and
Rastan.[\[10\]](https://research.sharqforum.org/2017/10/13/russia-and-saudi-arabia-at-a-turning-point/#_edn10)
[As Mohammed bin Salman, who is also the Defence Minister, put it some
time ago, "relations between Saudi Arabia and Russia \[were\] going
through one of their best moments
ever]{.underline}."[\[11\]](https://research.sharqforum.org/2017/10/13/russia-and-saudi-arabia-at-a-turning-point/#_edn11)
His father's presence in the Kremlin presents the ultimate proof of
this. **The Energy Dimension** [Russia and Saudi Arabia's interests have
partially converged. Both suffer from the low prices of crude oil,
putting their fiscal health at risk. That is why the original agreement
struck by Putin and Prince Mohammed in September 2016, whose aim is to
keep the price above \$50 per barrel, has held on]{.underline}. In May,
the two countries' energy ministers, Alexander Novak and Khalih
al-Falih, extended the deal for another nine months during a meeting in
Beijing. King Salman's visit broke the news that the "OPEC Plus"
arrangement could run until the end of 2018. The investment projects
announced during these visits suggest that cooperation is geared towards
the long term[. Russia is keen to attract investment from the Gulf. In
2016, the Qatar sovereign fund paid €2.5 billion together with natural
resources company Glencore for a 19.5 percent stake in the Russian
state-owned giant Rosneft]{.underline} (Putin happily remarked at the
time that Rosneft's shares had shot up by 18 percent as a
result).[\[12\]](https://research.sharqforum.org/2017/10/13/russia-and-saudi-arabia-at-a-turning-point/#_edn12)
In September, the Qataris and Glencore sold their shares to a Chinese
conglomerate, so Russia is no longer hostage to Saudi--Qatari
squabbles.[\[13\]](https://research.sharqforum.org/2017/10/13/russia-and-saudi-arabia-at-a-turning-point/#_edn13)
But fresh funding from the Saudis will be more than welcome given the
difficulties besetting Russian state-owned energy firms due to EU and
American sanctions (recently beefed up by the U.S.
Congress).[\[14\]](https://research.sharqforum.org/2017/10/13/russia-and-saudi-arabia-at-a-turning-point/#_edn14)
Minister Novak mentioned that Novatek, controlled by Putin's personal
friend Gennady Timchenko (who is on the western blacklist), would be
willing to partner with Saudi companies in a liquefied natural gas (LNG)
project in the Arctic. Saudi Aramco and Gazprom Neft (both state-owned)
are reportedly in talks to set up a joint research and technology
center.[\[15\]](https://research.sharqforum.org/2017/10/13/russia-and-saudi-arabia-at-a-turning-point/#_edn15)
**Shifting Geopolitics** [Money and oil help smoothen relations, but
what has really brought Putin and King Salman closer is the fluctuating
politics of the Middle East. Saudi Arabia has seen Russia's military and
diplomatic clout increasing with its intervention in Syria and its
closer ties with two other regional powers, Iran and
Turkey.]{.underline} At the same time, [**relative withdrawal of the
U.S. from the region has given Riyadh extra incentives to diversify
security ties** beyond those with its long-standing ally. Obama's
reluctance to step into Syria, the nuclear deal with Iran, and the
uncertainty surrounding Donald Trump's foreign policy have all had an
impact on the Saudis' strategic thinking]{.underline}. Russia, whose
quasi-alliance with Iran is not problem-free, could act as a
counterweight to it in Syria[.]{.underline} According to Moscow experts,
Riyadh might solicit Russian mediation in
Yemen.[\[16\]](https://research.sharqforum.org/2017/10/13/russia-and-saudi-arabia-at-a-turning-point/#_edn16)
[Last but not least, both]{.underline} [Russia and Saudi Arabia are
allies of the al-Sisi regime in Egypt.]{.underline} For his part,
Vladimir Putin knows the time is ripe to fold his Syrian
operation.[\[17\]](https://research.sharqforum.org/2017/10/13/russia-and-saudi-arabia-at-a-turning-point/#_edn17)
It has delivered benefits: Assad is secure in his position, the U.S. is
willing to engage with Russia, and Moscow is now a key player in the
Middle East. However, the costs of are becoming more and more apparent
as well. In September, the deadliest month since the battle for Eastern
Aleppo in December 2016, Russia suffered its most high-profile loss when
General Valery Asapov, seconded to the Syrian Army's Fifth Corps, was
killed by ISIS mortar fire near the city of Deir al-Zour. Assad's troops
and Russia are coming dangerously close to the Syrian Democratic Forces
(SDF), which are allied with America, including embedded commandoes and
artillery units under the command of the U.S. Marine Corps. The risks of
an undesired escalation are not to be overlooked. The Russian air force
has already bombarded the
SDF.[\[18\]](https://research.sharqforum.org/2017/10/13/russia-and-saudi-arabia-at-a-turning-point/#_edn18)
The Russian Ministry of Defence blamed Asapov's death on the U.S.'s
"two-faced policy", hinting that the Americans are covertly sharing
information with
ISIS.[\[19\]](https://research.sharqforum.org/2017/10/13/russia-and-saudi-arabia-at-a-turning-point/#_edn19)
They are also alleging that a patch of land on the Jordanian border at
al-Tanf has become a "black hole" through which jihadis enter
Syria.[\[20\]](https://research.sharqforum.org/2017/10/13/russia-and-saudi-arabia-at-a-turning-point/#_edn20)

supplier to African states. Over the past two decades it has pursued
military ties with various African countries]{.underline}, such as
Ethiopia, Nigeria and Zimbabwe. [Military ties are linked to bilateral
military agreements as well as providing boots on the ground in UN
peacekeeping operations.]{.underline} Combined, China and Russia
outnumber the other permanent members of the UN Security Council in
contributing troop to UN peacekeeping efforts[. Russia has also been
actively supporting Zimbabwe. Shortly after it was reported in 2018 that
China had placed new generation surface-to-air missiles in Zimbabwe,
Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov announced that his country was
pursuing military cooperation. Significantly, Zimbabwe's President
Emmerson Mnangagwa has said that his country may need Russia's help with
the modernization of its defense force during a recent visit to
Moscow.]{.underline} [Both Russia and China are keen to play a future
role in Africa.]{.underline} The difference between these two major
powers is that China forms part of the Asian regional economy. This will
surpass North America and Europe combined, in terms of global power --
based on GDP, population size, military spending and technological
investment. China and India have sustained impressive economic growth
over many years. And, their enormous populations make them two world
powers of extraordinary importance. [Growth prospects for the Russian
economy, on the other hand, remain modest -- between 1.5% and 1.8% a
year for 2018-2010, against the current global average rate of 3.5% a
year. Still, Russia remains a major power in global politics. For
African leaders, the key word is agency and the question is how to play
the renewed Russian attention to their countries'
advantage]{.underline}, and not to fall victim to the contemporary

## Impacts -- Terrorism 

### No Terrorism

#### No risk of an impact -- terrorism is declining worldwide -- don't believe their fearmongering

Justice, University of Maryland, 2-27-2019, \"Will terrorism continue to

[Lost in the headlines]{.underline}, rapidly accelerating news cycles
and the pervasive fear generated by terrorist threats [is the fact that
terrorist attacks worldwide have actually been declining -- in some
areas substantially.]{.underline} Terrorism researchers like me have
long noted that the number of terrorist attacks rises and falls in waves
-- generally lasting several decades. I'm the founding director of the
National Consortium for the Study of Terrorism and Responses to
Terrorism, or START, and one of the original creators of the Global
Terrorism Database. My colleagues Laura Dugan, Erin Miller and I define
terrorism as "the threatened or actual use of illegal force and violence
by non-state actors to attain a political, economic, religious or social
goal through fear, coercion or intimidation." The database shows that
[the world has been gripped by a wave of terrorist attacks that began
shortly after the 9/11 attacks]{.underline}. My research using the START
database shows the extent of this spike. From 2002 through 2014,
worldwide terrorist attacks increased by 12 times and terrorist
fatalities increased by more than eight times. Especially hard hit were
Iraq and Afghanistan in the Middle East, India and Pakistan in South
Asia, and Nigeria in sub-Saharan Africa. [The most active terrorist
organizations driving this worldwide boom were the Taliban, Al-Shabaab,
the Islamic State Group]{.underline} (also known as IS), [the Communist
Party of India--Maoist and Boko Haram. But since 2014, the picture has
changed dramatically -- a development that has gone largely unreported
in the media.]{.underline} Let's examine that change. A downward trend
[In 2015 total terrorist attacks decreased by 11.5 percent]{.underline}
and total terrorism-related deaths by 12.7 percent. [In 2016, we saw a
further 9.2 percent decrease]{.underline} in attacks and 10.2 percent
decline in total terrorism-related deaths. [The downward trend continued
in 2017, the most recent data available, with a 19.8 percent
drop]{.underline} in attacks and a 24.2 percent decline in fatalities.
Taken together, [these 36 months have witnessed the single largest
three-year decline in attacks]{.underline} and fatalities since the
Global Terrorism Database began in 1970 -- nearly a half century ago.
The recent declines are geographically dispersed. In the peak year of
2014, five countries -- Iraq, Pakistan, Afghanistan, Ukraine and Somalia
-- accounted for 57.2 percent of the world's total terrorist attacks and
more than half of the worldwide terrorism-related fatalities. By the end
of 2017, all five of these countries had experienced sizable declines in
attacks. Three of these countries also experienced a dramatic decline in
fatalities: a 53.6 percent drop in Iraq, a 55.4 percent drop in
Pakistan, and a 97.1 percent drop in Ukraine. The violence in Ukraine
was concentrated in 2014 and 2015 and associated with the rapid rise of
the Euromaidan revolution and culminated in the overthrow of the
Russian-backed Ukrainian president. During the same period, fatalities
increased by 12.5 percent in Afghanistan and 203 percent in Somalia, but
these increases weren't big enough to offset the declines in Iraq,
Pakistan and Ukraine. Major groups less active [Attacks and fatalities
claimed by the world's most active and dangerous terrorist organizations
have also declined]{.underline} during the last three years. In 2014,
the five most active terrorist organizations in the world were the
Islamic State Group, or IS, the Taliban, Al-Shabaab, Boko Haram and the
Donetsk People's Republic -- a separatist organization operating in
Ukraine and receiving military backing from Russia. [By the end of 2017,
attacks by the Taliban, Al-Shabaab, Boko Haram and the Donetsk People's
Republic had all declined. Total attacks by IS decreased by 2.2
percent]{.underline} from 2014 to 2015 but then increased by 7.7 percent
from 2015 to 2017.

written 12/5/18; accessed 7/28/19)

Is the world starting to get to grips with the scourge of terrorism?
There are at least some hopeful signs. [**Last year, the number of
deaths caused by terrorist groups was 18,814, 27% less than the year
before and the third consecutive year of improvement.** At the same
time, **the number of attacks fell by 23%.**]{.underline} These numbers
come from the Global Terrorism Index 2018, compiled by the Institute for
Economics & Peace (IEP) and published today. According to the index,
[most countries saw their situation improve last year, with 94 countries
showing a decline in the impact of terrorism, compared to 46 countries
where the problem got worse.]{.underline} The countries with the
greatest improvements were Iraq and Syria where the number of deaths
fell by 5,500 and 1,000 respectively. The situation was also markedly
better in Europe, where the number of deaths fell by 75%. France,
Belgium and Germany all saw significant improvements, although Spain
deteriorated. [The positive developments in these regions is in large
part a consequence of the decline of Islamic State (also known as ISIL
or ISIS), which has now been largely defeated in its home territory of
Iraq and Syria and is, as a consequence, less able to mount deadly
attacks in Europe. "ISIL has lost much of its attractiveness due to its
military defeats and weakened capabilities to mount attacks in
Europe,"]{.underline} says Steve Killelea, chairman of IEP. ["Increases
in counter-terrorism funding, combined with better surveillance
techniques, have also contributed to the steep reduction of deaths in
Europe from terrorism. ISIL is losing its ability to plan and coordinate
larger scale terrorist attacks, as a result of lessened capabilities and
increased counterterrorism measures."]{.underline}

**[The Threat is not Existential]{.underline}** [In the sixteen years
after 9/11, jihadists have killed 103 people inside the
U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates. Each of those deaths is a
tragedy. The attack in Orlando was the deadliest terrorist attack in the
United States since 9/11 and the deadliest mass shooting in American
history. However, **[the attacks are not national
catastrophes]{.underline}** **[of the type]{.underline}** the United
States experienced **[on 9/11]{.underline}**. Instead the death toll has
been quite similar to other forms of political---and even
non-political---violence Americans face today. America's Layered
Defenses While the United States has seen a series of deadly attacks by
individuals and pairs inspired by jihadism, **[the United States today
is a hard target for foreign terrorist organizations, which have not
directed and carried out a successful deadly attack in the country since
9/11.]{.underline}** **[This is the result of a layered set of
defenses]{.underline}** including tips from local communities, members
of the public, and the widespread use of informants. A deadly attack
directed from abroad cannot be ruled out. For example, the 2009
Christmas Day bomb plot by Umar Farouk Abdulmuttalab---who was trained
and directed by Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula---failed only because
the explosive didn't work. The Times Square bomb plot by Faisal Shahzad,
who in 2010 managed to place a car bomb in Times Square undetected after
training with the Pakistani Taliban, which again did not detonate
properly, is another example. Despite these cases, **[the most likely
threat continues to be lone individuals]{.underline}** or pairs inspired
by jihadist ideology **[without the]{.underline}** type of extensive
plotting, communication, or travel **[activity that would tip off the
layered counterterrorism defense system.]{.underline}**

**[If nuclear terrorism is such a serious possibility, why have

appears to be that there are a number of obsta cles?from acquiring
enough nuclear material]{.underline}** to fabricating it into a
bomb?**[that make]{.underline}** such **[an attack difficult to
accomplish.]{.underline}** But it would be foolish to rest the worlds

to make nerve gas weapons by relying on the group\'s own expertise had
\"resulted in a waste of effort and money\" (Cullison and Higgins 2001;
Albright 2002). Though limited, available evidence does suggest a rather
modest level of sophistication in al Qaeda\'s nuclear efforts (Bunn,
Wier, and Friedman 2005). But a number of top al Qaeda personnel are
technologically literate (Gunaratna 2003), and they may well succeed in
recruiting other technically skilled individu als.10 The most detailed
unclassified analysis of al Qaeda\'s nuclear program con cludes that it
posed a serious threat while under way in Afghanistan and could still
succeed elsewhere (Albright 2002). Others assert that **[a group with al

for]{.underline}** an arguably large, long-term project like [making a
nuclear bomb, particularly given]{.underline} the substantial
operational disruptions sustained since 9/11. This would undoubtedly

### Aff Solves

#### Turn -- US arms sales to Saudi Arabia make AQAP stronger

[**AQAP is easily exploiting the situation in Yemen**. Despite U.S. and
Saudi efforts, experts have argued that the campaign against AQAP in
Yemen **may have actually helped the group prosper** by destabilizing
the region and providing new gaps for the terrorist group to exploit. Al
Qaeda has been able to further capitalize on the fact that many Yemeni
civilians are turning against both the U.S. and Saudi Arabia as they
watch the actions of the two countries deepen Yemen's humanitarian
crisis.]{.underline} Despite this, both the U.S. and Saudi Arabia have
continued their strikes upon AQAP, though their imprecision has resulted
in numerous civilian deaths. Over the course of just two days in January
2017, the U.S. military performed a ground operation in Al Bayda
Province that resulted in the death of 24 civilians. Just a few months
later, 30 U.S. airstrikes against AQAP killed a few dozen more. The U.S.
declared these actions a success---but [to Yemeni civilians, these
events were further proof that the U.S. is not a benevolent actor, but
would continue to steer the fate of the Middle East to ensure its own
national security interests]{.underline}. Naturally, the number of
civilian casualties has brewed distaste for the U.S. in the Yemeni
psyche, a feeling that is rapidly replacing their once pro-U.S.
attitudes. As stated by Dafna H. Rand, a representative of the U.S.
State Department, [the continuity of the war and U.S. involvement in
Yemen will potentially foster anger against the U.S. that could
encourage radicalization and increase AQAP membership.]{.underline}
[AQAP's anti-Saudi Arabia and anti-Western stance has resonated with
some Yemeni civilians who feel that the Saudi-U.S. partnership has
devastated their country]{.underline} and deteriorated their quality of
life. Eventually, [larger numbers of **Yemeni civilians may see AQAP as
the only secure and stable option** for their country.]{.underline}

### No AQAP

#### AQAP is not a threat -- their evidence conflates domestic insurgency and international terrorism

**Johnsen 18** (Gregory D. Johnsen is a resident scholar at the Arabia
Foundation and the author of The Last Refuge: Yemen, al-Qaeda, and
America's War in Arabia. From 2016 to 2018 he was a member of the Yemen

<https://warontherocks.com/2018/10/the-two-faces-of-al-qaeda-in-the-arabian-peninsula/>,
accessed 7/28/19, //Guyer-HasanM)

Over the past 10 years, AQAP has become one of al-Qaeda's most worrisome
affiliates, carrying out attacks at home and abroad, from seizing
territory in Yemen to putting bombs on planes bound for the United
States. In 2010, shortly after the group was founded, the State
Department estimated that AQAP had "several hundred" members. That
number jumped to a "few thousand" in 2011 and then to "four thousand" in
2015. This year, the department put that estimate in the "low
thousands," although the United Nations put the number of AQAP fighters
at 6,000 -- 7,000. The upward trend largely holds true for the number of
attacks the group has claimed. For the past two years, I tracked AQAP as
part of the U.N. Security Council's Yemen Panel of Experts. In both 2016
and 2017, AQAP claimed more than 200 attacks, a significant increase
from the group's early years when Yemen was relatively stable and AQAP
was more focused on striking the West. But the numbers are misleading.
[AQAP may be bigger now, but it isn't stronger. It may be carrying out
more attacks, but it isn't more of a threat. At issue is]{.underline}
what I call [the two faces of AQAP: the domestic insurgency and the
international terrorist organization. These two strands have always
coexisted]{.underline} in AQAP, as they have for most terrorist groups.
[But the two are often conflated into one overall picture]{.underline}
of the group. [We hear AQAP and think of international
terrorism,]{.underline} not the domestic insurgency. [This
failure]{.underline} by journalists, analysts, and officials [to
distinguish between AQAP's two sides leads to a mistaken impression of
the threat the group represents to the West.]{.underline} This is why
numbers don't tell the whole story. [AQAP's domestic reach and recruits
have grown significantly]{.underline} in recent years[, but the
international terrorist side has withered.]{.underline} The group might
look and sound more dangerous than ever, but it is actually a much
different organization today than it was a decade ago. Like most
terrorist groups, AQAP is a complex organization doing multiple things
at once, laying sewer pipes and building bombs. When we only look at one
aspect of the organization we risk misunderstanding who they are, how
they operate, and what they can accomplish. A Two-Front Campaign Within
a year of the 2008 video release, AQAP had nearly assassinated Saudi
Arabia's then-deputy interior minister and managed to smuggle an
underwear bomb onto a U.S.-bound flight that, but for a soggy fuse,
could have been disastrous. Next came a pair of parcel bombs, rumors of
surgically implanted explosives, and fears of laptop bombs on airplanes.
Full-body scanners at airports and laptop bans on some international
flights last year were the result. But AQAP was also active inside
Yemen, fighting the local government and working to connect with tribes.
Twice in the past few years, the group has seized and attempted to
administer territory in Yemen, essentially creating its own mini-states,
complete with police forces and ruling councils. Both times AQAP lasted
about a year before withdrawing in the face of government or
international military offensives. In an effort to deny AQAP a sanctuary
from which to plot and launch attacks against the West, the United
States initiated an extensive bombing campaign. Using naval warships,
planes, and drones, the United States has conducted more than 300
strikes in Yemen over the past 10 years, resulting in hundreds of
deaths. Of the four men featured in that late 2008 video, only one is
still active in the organization. Two, the former head of AQAP and his
deputy, were killed in U.S. strikes, while a third recanted and returned
to Saudi Arabia not long after recording the video. The United States
has killed Anwar al-Awlaki and, if recent reports are to be believed,
Ibrahim al-Asiri, the group's most widely known bomb-maker, as well.
There have been successes in the war against AQAP but no lasting
victory. AQAP has been weakened, but it hasn't been destroyed. AQAP's
Overseas Activities Dwindle [The]{.underline} first [reason the group's
international terrorist side has been weakened is the rise of Islamic
State]{.underline}, or ISIL. As I describe in my book, at the height of
Anwar al-Awlaki's popularity in 2011, [Yemen was a destination for
international recruits looking to join a jihad. But ISIL and its
caliphate stole much of AQAP's thunder]{.underline} --- and many of its
potential recruits --- and the organization is now feeling that
shortfall. Combine the lack of skilled recruits with the dramatic
increase in U.S. strikes over the past few years, which appear to be
much more targeted than they once were, and AQAP is losing more top
leaders than it is capable of replacing. In 2015, for example, the
United States killed the then-head of AQAP, Nasir al-Wihayshi, who was
once Osama bin Laden's aide-de-camp in Afghanistan. Wihayshi's
replacement, Qasim al-Raymi, also has experience in Afghanistan but
lacks both his predecessor's leadership skills and his strategic
patience. Al-Raymi is an understudy, better suited to carrying out
orders than giving them. Absent an influx of new talent, this is what
AQAP's leadership increasingly looks like: backups forced into starting
roles. The third factor is [what AQAP does have: foot soldiers. These
are the local Yemenis who bolster the domestic insurgency side of the
organization but do little to help the international terrorist
side]{.underline}. AQAP has always had a lot of local fighters in its
ranks, but after the Houthis --- a Zaydi Shi'a group supported by Iran
--- took control of the state in 2015, that number jumped significantly.
(In a sign of how messy the current war in Yemen is, AQAP is also
fighting both Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates, which entered
the war to fight the Houthis.) When the war started, [many outside
observers]{.underline} --- myself included --- [believed that the longer
the fighting lasted, the more recruits AQAP would gain and the greater a
threat it would become. We were half-right. The fighting has increased
AQAP's numbers but hasn't made the group more of a threat to the
West]{.underline}. The domestic insurgency side of AQAP is thriving, but
the international terrorist side has withered. This is also why the
U.N.'s estimate of 6,000-7,000 members is accurate but misleading. [By
conflating AQAP's two sides into a single snapshot, we misrepresent the
group as well as the threat it represents.]{.underline} Conclusion AQAP
is both a domestic insurgency and an international terrorist
organization, and it has to be combated as such. U.S. strikes and the
allure of ISIL have combined to weaken the international side, but as
ISIL retreats and the fighting in Yemen continues, these losses can
easily be regained. In a sense, one of the two streams feeding AQAP has
been cut off, but what is needed now is to shut down the other. Without
eradicating what is left of AQAP, its domestic insurgency side, there
remains a risk that the group will be able to resurrect its
international terrorist side. In many ways, [defeating the domestic
insurgency requires more nuance and tact]{.underline} than ~~crippling~~
the international terrorist side. [It can't be done through drone
strikes and SEAL raids]{.underline}. Many of the Yemenis who have joined
AQAP are also members of local tribes. Rather than simply taking these
local fighters out, what is needed is the creation of off-ramps to get
them out of the organization. The Associated Press recently reported
that the United Arab Emirates has been either paying members of AQAP not
to fight or hiring them to fight alongside U.A.E.-backed forces. Giving
cash to the organization would be problematic, but assuming the United
Arab Emirates was only handing out money to local foot soldiers to flip
allegiances, that is something different and worth examining more
closely. In a cash-strapped society like Yemen, particularly one in the
midst of multiple overlapping wars, armed men often gravitate to the
highest bidder. Flipping those who can be flipped will go a long way
toward shutting down AQAP's local recruiting stream. Contrary to the
picture painted by the numbers, **[AQAP is the weakest it has ever
been]{.underline}**. Decimated by drone strikes and challenged by
rivals, [its international terrorist side is a shadow of its former
self.]{.underline} Only its domestic insurgency side --- bolstered by
Yemen's messy war --- is growing. If this side can be reduced and
contained, AQAP can be defeated. But if it is allowed to remain and
continue to grow, the group may be able to resurrect the international
side of its organization and become a global terrorist threat once more.

### No ISIS

#### ISIS is not a threat -- their authors are super biased and massively overstate the threat

**Cottee 19** (Simon Cottee, Senior lecturer in criminology at the
University of Kent, UK, 3-1-2019, \"What the Media Won't Tell You About
ISIS,\" Atlantic,
<https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2019/02/what-media-wont-tell-you-about-isis/583702/>,
accessed 7/28/19, //Guyer-HasanM)

That's what will happen, at least, if past is prologue. [Since ISIS came
to global prominence in mid-2014, the Western media have consistently
overestimated the group, attributing to it extraordinary technical
savvy, awesome powers of strategic foresight, and a Terminator-like
ability to keep reconstituting itself and coming back from the
dead]{.underline} to terrorize and destroy all who stand in its path. Of
course, before the Western media overestimated the group, the Western
political establishment underestimated it. President Barack Obama
famously told The New Yorker's David Remnick in early 2014 that ISIS was
al-Qaeda's "JV team." He was wrong about that. Once ISIS captured Mosul,
however, and then started beheading Western hostages, the freak-out
commenced in earnest. By September 2014, [Democratic Senator Dianne
Feinstein was insisting that the "threat ISIS poses" could not "be
overstated." It could and it was. Soon it was hard to turn on the TV or
read a newspaper without coming across some lurid story about the
group's latest depravity,]{.underline} which was also taken as evidence
of its prowess. [The Western tabloid press was particularly egregious in
this regard, liberally disseminating clips from actual ISIS propaganda
videos and publishing truly preposterous stories.]{.underline} One
fake-news headline in the Daily Mail ran, "ISIS using bombs containing
live SCORPIONS in effort to spread panic, in tactic used 2,000 years ago
against Romans." But it wasn't just the tabloid press. [Serious
journalists and commentators were also bewitched by the theater of the
Islamic State's cruelty and deeply impressed by the supposed
sophistication of ISIS propaganda videos.]{.underline} In a September
2014 column for The New York Times, the late David Carr wrote, "Anybody
who doubts the technical ability of ISIS might want to watch a
documentary of Fallujah that includes some remarkable drone camera
work." He added, "While the videos convey barbarism on an elemental
level ... ISIS clearly has a sophisticated production unit, with good
cameras, technically proficient operators and editors who have access to
all the best tools." He was referring to the opening shot of the
ultraviolent Clanging of the Swords, Part 4. [Countless other
journalists praised the Islamic State's masterly use of social media,
pointing out how "slick" and on-point its message was.]{.underline}
[These fawning appraisals helped burnish the group's invincible image
and might have spurred ISIS to create yet more videos]{.underline},
ramping up the shock quotient as it went. As the Spanish photographer
Ricardo Vilanova, who spent eight months in an ISIS jail, told the BBC,
"I think the West is also to blame because [we became a loudspeaker for
the Islamic State. Every time there was an execution, anything related
with the Islamic State would get the front pages.]{.underline} I
believed [that encouraged them to get crueler and amplify their
message]{.underline}." I count two problems with the media's response to
ISIS videos: [It was ethically dubious to praise what was often
straight-up snuff, and the videos were not really all that good. Many
were no good at all.]{.underline} Take, for example, the Islamic State's
first English-language video, There Is No Life Without Jihad, released
on June 19, 2014. The video features a group of young British and
Australian men, sitting together with their legs crossed, reading a
pre-prepared script. They are trying to explain, in their thick regional
accents, why they left their lives in the West for jihad in Syria and
Iraq. A man identified as Abu Bara' al-Hindi says, "Are you willing to
sacrifice the fat job you have got, the big car you have got, the family
you have? Are you willing to sacrifice this for the sake of Allah?" Abu
Bara' al-Hindi is wearing what appears to be an Emporio Armani T-shirt,
which is scarcely a strong look for a jihadist warrior, especially one
at war with Western imperialism. The man to his immediate right has a
lazy eye under his thick balaclava. And the third man sits silently for
long periods of time with his mouth ajar. Needless to say, these were
not particularly rousing audio-visual feats. [Other ISIS videos were not
just bad, but utterly cringeworthy, such as the homoerotic one featuring
ISIS fighters frolicking in a swimming pool, or the ones with
voice-overs so portentous and hyperbolic that they were simply beyond
parody.]{.underline} No doubt ISIS videos were an advance on the
tedious, hour-long video-speeches of al-Qaeda's Ayman al-Zawahiri, and
no doubt they were more arresting than the counter-messaging mash-up
videos disseminated by the U.S. State Department. But they hardly
warranted all the accolades that were showered on them by the Western
media. [Once the media decided ISIS was unstoppable, they couldn't let
the idea go]{.underline}. For the past two years, [ISIS has been getting
pummeled in Syria and Iraq]{.underline}, and is now close to losing the
last sliver of its territory, and thus of its caliphate. [Yet many
observers are reluctant to acknowledge the scale of this
defeat]{.underline} for ISIS, [convinced that it will shape-shift into
something even more fearsome. Some can't even bring themselves to use
the word defeat, perversely sounding like ISIS propagandists who spin
every loss as but a temporary setback on the path to inevitable
triumph]{.underline}. They focus on the fact that the group has
strongholds elsewhere---in Afghanistan, for instance---and argue that it
will return at some later stage, revitalized. Read: The hell after ISIS
The New York Times journalist Rukmini Callimachi cautioned last month
that ISIS "has been declared vanquished before, only to prove
politicians wrong and to rise stronger than before." Also last month,
Tim Lister, in a CNN story, insisted that "there are signs that \[ISIS
is\] regenerating in Iraq." (CNN's headline: "ISIS Is Far From Being
Defeated as a Fighting Force or Ideology.") The jihadist expert and
Atlantic contributor Hassan Hassan has argued repeatedly that ISIS is
set to reinvent itself as a regional insurgency in Syria and Iraq and
that, despite territorial losses, "its ability to function as an
organisation remains intact." In its guise as an insurgency, he
suggested on Twitter, ISIS will be able to entrench itself locally in
ways it couldn't at its zenith.\* No doubt it's true that ISIS has some
life left in it. Journalists and experts ought to counter Trump's
bombastic rhetoric that "we have defeated ISIS" and point out nuances
and complexity in the ongoing fight against the group. But they are also
under an obligation to concede the glaringly obvious: [ISIS will not be
able to replicate the scale of violence and chaos it unleashed when it
had large areas of land and all the resources and potential income that
went with it. Loss of territory will also]{.underline}, as Georgetown's
Bruce Hoffman has pointed out, [reduce the Islamic State's global
appeal, making it difficult to recruit and retain
supporters.]{.underline}
