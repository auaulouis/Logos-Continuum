As it turns out, these are often poor assumptions. Although arms sales
certainly enhance the military capability of the recipient nation, the
fundamental problem is that **[arms sales]{.underline}** often
[**initiate** a **long chain of responses**]{.underline} [that the
U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates generally **[cannot
control]{.underline}**. [The U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates,
after all, [is not the only country with interests in regional balances,
especially where]{.underline} the [survival and security of local actors
is at stake]{.underline}. [The U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates
[is neither the only major power with a keen interest in critical
regions like]{.underline} Asia and [the Middle East, nor the only source
of weapons]{.underline} and other forms of assistance. Nor can it
dictate the perceptions, interests, or actions of the other nations
involved in a given region. For example, though [a nation receiving arms
**from the**]{.underline} **[U]{.underline}**nited
**[S]{.underline}**tates may enjoy enhanced defensive capabilities, it
is also likely to enjoy enhanced offensive capabilities. With these, a
nation's **[calculations]{.underline}** [about the potential benefits of
war, intervention]{.underline} abroad, [or]{.underline} even the [use of
force against its own population may shift decisively]{.underline}.
[Saudi Arabia's recent behavior illustrates this dynamic]{.underline}.
[Though the Saudis explain their arms purchases as necessary for defense
against Iranian pressure, Saudi]{.underline} Arabia [has also
spent]{.underline} the past [two years embroiled in a military
intervention in Yemen.]{.underline} Likewise, [arms sales]{.underline}
can **[heighten regional security dilemmas]{.underline}**.
[**Neighbors** of nations buying major conventional weapons
will]{.underline} also [worry about what this enhanced military
capability will mean. This raises the chances]{.underline} that [**they
too** will]{.underline} seek to [**arm themselves further**, or take
other steps to **shift the balance of power back** in their favor,
or,]{.underline} in the extreme case, [to launch a **preventive
war**]{.underline} before they are attacked. Given these dynamics, [the
consequences of arms sales to manage regional balances of power are
**far less predictable** and]{.underline} often much less [positive than
advocates assume.]{.underline}54 This unpredictability characterizes
even straightforward-seeming efforts to manage the balance of power.
[The most basic claim of arms sales advocates is that U.S. arms sales
to]{.underline} friendly governments and [allies should make them better
able to deter adversaries]{.underline}. [The **best available
evidence**]{.underline}, however, [suggests a more complicated
reality]{.underline}. [In a study of arms sales from 1950
to]{.underline} 19[95]{.underline}, [major-power arms sales
to]{.underline} existing [allies had **no effect** on the chance that
the recipient would be the target of a military attack]{.underline}.
[Worse, recipients of U.S. arms that were not treaty allies were
significantly more likely to become targets]{.underline}.55 [Nor is
there]{.underline} much [evidence]{.underline} that [arms
sales]{.underline} can help the United States [promote peace and
regional stability by **calibrating** the **local balance of
power.**]{.underline} On this score, in fact, [the evidence suggests
that the default assumption should be the opposite]{.underline}. **[Most
scholarly work concludes that arms sales exacerbate instability and
increase the likelihood of conflict]{.underline}**.56 [One
study]{.underline}, for example, [found that during the Cold War, U.S.
and Soviet arms sales to hostile dyads]{.underline} (e.g.,
India/Pakistan, Iran/Iraq, Ethiopia/Somalia) ["contributed to hostile
political relations and imbalanced military relationships" and were
"profoundly destabilizing."]{.underline}57 There is also good reason to
believe that several factors are making the promotion of regional
stability through arms sales more difficult. The shrinking U.S. military
advantage over other powers such as China and the increasingly
competitive global arms market both make it less likely that U.S. arms
sales can make a decisive difference. As William Hartung argued as early
as 1990, "the notion of using arms transfers to maintain a carefully
calibrated regional balance of power seems increasingly archaic in
today's arms market, in which a potential U.S. adversary is as likely to
be receiving weapons from U.S. allies like Italy or France as it is from
former or current adversaries."58 In sum, the academic and historical
evidence indicates that although the United States can use arms sales to
enhance the military capabilities of other nations and thereby shift the
local and regional balance of power, its ability to dictate specific
outcomes through such efforts is severely limited.

#### Middle East hegemony [fails]{.underline} and is terminally [unsustainable]{.underline} -- failure to [rebalance]{.underline} makes [military overstretch]{.underline}, [economic collapse]{.underline} and terrorist [blowback]{.underline} inevitable 

**Porter 18** (Patrick Porter is the Chair of Strategic Studies at the
University of Exeter, Academic Director of Strategy and Security
Institute and Senior Associate Fellow at RUSI, PhD in history from
Oxford, "Desert Shield of the Republic? Realism and the Middle East,"
<https://cpb-us-w2.wpmucdn.com/u.osu.edu/dist/5/66008/files/2018/12/Desert-Shield-of-the-Republic-Porter-new-22klvgd.pdf)//CMR>

Firstly, [the U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates [is
**overstretched**]{.underline}, and needs to cut back. [Great powers
can]{.underline} sustain themselves, or [adjust]{.underline} better [to
a shifting environment, by rebalancing]{.underline} means and ends.40
[Washington faces a deteriorating fiscal position, and an altered
position of relative power]{.underline}. [Its position as "global
leader" is premised on]{.underline} a set of [impermanent and atypical
conditions]{.underline} from the earlier postwar era. Measured on
Purchasing Power Parity, studies estimate that the U.S. produces 15-24%
of global GDP, compared to the relative share of wealth in enjoyed in
1960, of 40%, an era when the ambition of world leadership arose. 41
This trendline is reversible to a degree -- a Chinese contraction or
Indian crash is also possible, and the U.S. could recover some ground as
it did under the Reagan administration -but [the overall balance has
likely passed an **inflection point**]{.underline}. True, [the U.S.
remains the largest power]{.underline} on many metrics,
[but]{.underline} it also [shoulders the most commitments, and must
split its resources and energy among more theatres than its
rivals]{.underline}. Can it afford them?

[This]{.underline} is not a choice between a sound and safe status quo
and an "experiment" with alternatives, as detractors suggest. Rather, it
is a choice about the experiment currently being run, an
[experiment]{.underline} that [is profligate and
**unsustainable**]{.underline}. [The U]{.underline}nited
[S]{.underline}tates [is accumulating record deficits and growing,
**unsustainable debts**]{.underline}. [Current debt levels exceed the
size of the U.S. economy]{.underline}. According to the Congressional
Budget Office, federal debt will reach 150 percent of GDP by 2047.42
[America's deficit has grown]{.underline} to \$895 billion a year,
[as]{.underline} extravagant tax cuts, [interest on debt, defence
build-ups and rising domestic costs outstrip economic
growth]{.underline}. The CBO warns that [debts that get harder to
service **threaten solvency**]{.underline}, that "the prospect of [large
and growing debt poses substantial risks for the nation]{.underline}."43
[Heavy fiscal burdens]{.underline} beyond a certain proportion of
debt-to GDP tend to **[choke economic growth]{.underline}**, [while a
growing debt load directly impedes]{.underline} the country's [ability
to sustain]{.underline} its way of life alongside its extensive
[international commitments]{.underline}. [This leaves open the
possibility of another **fiscal crisis**]{.underline}, [but without the
reserves this time to combat it]{.underline}. Historically,
military-security build-ups trigger boom-busts in the business cycle.44
Of course, there is always the argument that deficits don't matter, that
the U.S. enjoys exceptional trust in international investment markets
which will not take fright, and can sustain its deficit-financed model.
While that could be true, the hazards of making that wager and being
wrong are unacceptable, as the last Global Financial Crisis
demonstrated. It would be imprudent to conduct the experiment.

[While the material base of its power erodes, Washington faces a more
hostile external environment, one of competitive multipolarity, in an
era of increasing great power competition.]{.underline} This is an era
where access/area-denial \[A2/AD\] military technology are making it
easier for determined weaker sides to inflict prohibitive costs on great
powers. Even in its pomp, before weaker states had their hands on
long-range precision munitions and cheap sensors, the United States was
not able to defeat a number of weaker challengers, from China in the
Korean War to communists in Vietnam to Islamist insurgents in
Afghanistan. **[The days of unipolarity are over, and cannot be wished
back]{.underline}**. [The question is how well the U]{.underline}nited
[S]{.underline}tates [can adjust to competitive multipolarity, in order
to remain solvent]{.underline}.

At the same time as resources become more scarce and economic dangers
mount, the [U.S.]{.underline} is expanding its [commitments in the
Middle East]{.underline}, and doubling down on its effort to remain the
dominant power. Means and ends are increasingly misaligned. The United
States is in mounting danger of what "rise and fall" realists in the
tradition of Walter Lippmann called "insolvency", where its commitments
[exceed its power, to the point of **physical exhaustion** and
**domestic political discord**, through which division at home and
incoherence abroad feed off one another]{.underline}.45 [It has too many
commitments, for resources that are **increasingly
scarce**]{.underline}, [and cannot proceed on its present course without
the imbalance of means and ends getting worse.]{.underline} While
forward garrisoning is not in itself especially expensive compared to
repatriated forces, [commitments in the Gulf drive up demands on the
size of defence budget, to maintain capabilities to operate in the
region]{.underline}.

Estimates vary on the savings, ranging from \$75billion a year to \$121
billion.46 [Drawing down in the Middle East would be one important step
on the road to **redressing the fiscal imbalance**]{.underline}.
Secondly, this is a problem not only because of the balance sheet of
material power. It also threatens the republic's way of life. The
purpose of American statecraft should be, as Graham Allison argues, to
\"preserve the U.S. as a free nation with our fundamental institutions
and values intact.\"47 Primacy realism pays much attention to the
question of economic prosperity but too little attention to the ultimate
objective of U.S. grand strategy, which is to ensure the health of
America's domestic order: its institutions, its constitution, and its
liberties. This issue will be addressed below.

Thirdly, given the need to cut back, the United States should revise the
value of its commitments in [the Middle East]{.underline}. The region
[is losing its grand strategic salience as a power center]{.underline}.
It boasts only 6% of global GDP, and only 5% of the world's population.
Its oil output remains important but is decreasingly so, in the oil and
gas revolutions taking place elsewhere. This region is also,
increasingly, unrewarding. [Compared to America's other]{.underline} two
major [theatres of commitment, Asia and Europe, the Middle East is
especially unworthwhile]{.underline}. It loads too much trouble on
Washington's shoulders. A set of [interlocking historical forces and
prior choices made the region a wildly complex one to manage as an
external power.]{.underline}48 This is not due to any primordial
"essence." Rather, it lies in the interactions of other path- dependent
forces: imperial settlements, indigenous divide-and-rule politics,
authoritarian regimes' strategies of deflection, using Islamist causes
and movements to fragment opposition and channel demands for change, the
"resource curse" of petro-politics and resulting economic stagnation, an
explosion of sectarian identity linked to the rival power bids of Saudi
Arabia and Iran, and the additional pressures created by the application
of U.S. power, not only in the Iraq misadventure or in support for
Israel, but in a longstanding collaboration with the very Islamist
forces against which it does battle. As a result, the region the U.S.
waded into is one of seething populations, a choice of bad allies for
whom the superpower and its main ally, Israel, are a ready alibi.

[Involvement in the Middle East played a central part in bringing on the
9/11 attacks]{.underline} and making possible the subsequent War on
Terror and America's most disastrous war since Vietnam. It embroils
America in a set of violent geopolitical storms -- namely the civil wars
within the Arab Islamic world- that it does not have the power to
control or extinguish, as well as more localised conflicts that deliver
a bad bargain of complicity with little influence. **[Salafist-jihadist
terrorism is energised by U.S. presence and patronage]{.underline}**.
[America's most pressing security interest, the need to suppress
terrorism, is largely generated by **being there in the first
place**]{.underline}. It also turns out that **[the region is not
amenable to the kind of affordable hegemonic influence that "primacy
realists" assume it wields]{.underline}**. [Not only does Washington
repeatedly fail to get its way. Its clients and allies behave,
persistently, in ways that infringe its interests]{.underline}. Even
worse, [the anxiety to maintain alliances]{.underline}, bases [and a
structure of hegemonic power creates **"reverse
leverage",**]{.underline} [whereby]{.underline} the [Gulf
monarchies]{.underline} in particular [exploit American anxiety about
losing its position]{.underline}. [The main]{.underline} economic and
geopolitical [interest]{.underline} that [the U.S. does have in the
region]{.underline} -- the [stability of the oil market and the threat
of a hostile hegemon -- can be secured and hedged against enough from a
remove, while garrisoning the region would do little to shore up this
interest and could jeopardise it.]{.underline} And the reaction to
violent disorder in the region has induced a state of near-permanent war
that corrupts the republic, creating unchecked executive and state
power, makes foreign policy ever more militarised and praetorian,
damages the Congress' constitutional authority, increases risks of
boom/bust cycles, and widens inequality at home. The net result? [For
considerable investment of treasure and blood, the status quo binds the
U.S. to a region in ways that **divert resources**]{.underline}, [leave
it open to **manipulation**]{.underline}, corruption [and at **greater
menace** of **terrorist blowback**]{.underline}.

**Sieber 13** (Lieutenant Colonel Matthew M. Sieber, United States Army
War College, "An Approach to Forward Presence in a Resource-Constrained
Environment," Strategy Research Project, March 2013)

[A]{.underline} review and [reduction of permanent overseas bases
is]{.underline} particularly [appropriate]{.underline} [when the
U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates [is simultaneously exploring
force reductions]{.underline}. The 2010 National Security Strategy
describes United States interests as security, prosperity, values, and
international order.7 The Secretary of Defense's Priorities for 21st
Century Defense describes the emerging twenty-first century security
environment, and calls for robust forward United States presence and the
ability to project power around the globe to protect those interests.8 A
problem emerges in strategy formulation during a period of declining
resources. With fixed ends and declining means, the ways to achieve the
ends may have to change. [The **status quo** of a large overseas-based
force does not appear **sustainable** due to costs, **reduced force
structure**, and **readiness**]{.underline}. [The]{.underline} combined
[benefit of reducing overseas facilities]{.underline} while reducing
troop strength [helps to eliminate concerns expressed by a]{.underline}
congressional overseas basing [commission over costs associated with
returning forces to CONUS bases.]{.underline}9 Further, the challenging
fiscal environment provides a stimulus and opportunity to make wholesale
adjustments to the entire military apparatus. If done correctly, the
United States will be positioned for continued relevance and influence
in a period of significant change in the world's strategic environment.
This paper will propose an approach to resolve the requirement for
forward presence in a period of declining resources. To do this, the
paper will examine the environment that the United States can expect to
face in the twenty-first century. Further, this paper makes the case
that **[force reduction is inevitable]{.underline}** [under the strain
of the economic landscape.]{.underline} The proposed approach to forward
presence should help to [balance a sustainable]{.underline}
ends-ways-means strategic [formula for national defense]{.underline}.
This paper will propose an approach to resolve the requirement for
forward presence in a period of declining resources. To do this, the
paper will examine the environment that the United States can expect to
face in the twenty-first century. Further, this paper makes the case
that force reduction is inevitable under the strain of the economic
landscape. The proposed approach to forward presence should help to
balance a sustainable ends-ways-means strategic formula for national
defense. The Twenty-first Century Environment In order to develop an
approach to United States forward presence, one must first understand
the strategic environment expected in the twenty-first century. The 2010
Joint Operating Environment includes the following four points that the
United States should consider when posturing forces around the globe. 1.
[The world will experience a rapidly growing population of dissatisfied
youth with few prospects for the future who are easily influenced by the
promise of anything but poverty, disease, and pain]{.underline}. 2.
Growing [globalization]{.underline} and easy access to media will
portray a significant division between the prosperous and the poor. 3.
The means to reach and influence large populations will improve around
the globe. 4. A [rising China]{.underline} presents a potential, if not
actual, change in the economic and political world leader.10 A holistic
view of the emerging environment suggests that [the
**U**]{.underline}nited **[S]{.underline}**tates [should be prepared to
**rapidly respond** to **low**]{.underline} to mid[**intensity**
conflict over a **wide expanse** of the **globe**]{.underline}.
[**Simultaneously**, the United States should be prepared to deter and
defend against a rising near-**peer competitor** in high intensity
conflict]{.underline}. The 2011 National Military Strategy explains that
[the twenty-first century will include a host of failing or failed
states that provide a **breeding ground** for hate and discontent by
non-state actors who can affect influence]{.underline}.11 One has only
to look at recent world events to see how effectively a group of
non-state actors were able to foment violent protests following the
killing of United States diplomats in Benghazi, Libya on September 12,
2012. 12 While this event appears to have been a targeted terrorist
attack, the perpetrators were able to capitalize on the event to fuel
anti-American protests spanning multiple states from Libya to Sudan and
into Lebanon.13 The "Failed States Index" study conducted by
collaboration between Foreign Policy and Fund for Peace lists these six
states as "critical" or "in danger," the two highest ratings for risk of
failure.14 This example points to a trend that typifies the environment
we can expect for the twenty-first century. President Bush's 2002
National Security Strategy summarized this trend as follows: "[America
is]{.underline} now [threatened]{.underline} less by conquering states
than we are by failing ones. We are menaced less by fleets and armies
than [by **catastrophic technologies** in the hands of the embittered
few]{.underline}." 15 The United Nations' Department of Economic and
Social Affairs published in their 2010 revision of the "World Population
Prospects" that **[rapid population growth]{.underline}** coupled with
**[unemployment]{.underline}** and competition for limited resources [is
driving instability in failing states]{.underline}. In most failed or
failing states, populations are projected to explode during the next
century. The population of the 48 least developed states is growing
fastest. The population in developed countries remains fairly stable,
despite fertility rates below that required for replacement. Developed
states can expect to maintain their current population through migration
from undeveloped states. While the population over the age of 60 is
expected to double in developed countries, underdeveloped countries can
expect close to half of their population to be less than 24 years of age
during the next century. 16 The United Nations' 2010 revision of the
"World Population Prospects" also explains that [the increasing world
population will be moving quickly to urban areas.]{.underline} The urban
population is expected to grow by seventy-two percent by 2050, from 3.6
billion to 6.3 billion. More concerning is that [the rural population,
the sustaining force for **food**]{.underline} and other resources,
[is]{.underline} only [expected to]{.underline} grow slightly until
2021and then begin a **[decline]{.underline}** through the remainder of
the century, from 3.4 billion to just over 3 billion.17 Simultaneously,
the Central Intelligence Agency's "World Fact Book" reflects steadily
climbing unemployment rates. The high-risk states referred to above have
unemployment rates ranging from 12.2% to over 30% and growing. The
population of those countries that fall below the poverty line is
increasing rapidly and is above 45% for Sudan and Yemen.18 Dramatic
[globalization with the widespread development of
communication]{.underline} through the use of cell phones, social media,
and news media provides easy access to huge portions of the population.
We [can]{.underline} expect this powerful resource to be exploited by
ill-intentioned actors. Readily available media can be used to reveal
the disparity in prosperity worldwide, [generat]{.underline}ing
[hostility]{.underline} and instability. To complicate the environment
even further, [we see a **rising power in China**]{.underline}. In an
otherwise shaky world economy, theirs has grown from ninth in Gross
Domestic Product (GDP) in 1985 to second in the world behind the United
States, surpassing Japan, Germany, United Kingdom, France, Italy, and
Brazil.19 Some sources project that China will surpass the United States
in GDP by 2026 -- signaling a potential change in world leadership
economically and politically.20 China's defense budget grew by 14.9% in
2009 and is now the second largest in the world.21 [While China openly
announced a 2009 defense budget of \$70.6 billion, the United States
Department of Defense estimates actual Chinese military-related spending
may have been closer to \$150 billion, or more]{.underline}. As an
example of the ambiguity of China's sophisticated defense development,
in 2007, they conducted a test of an anti-satellite weapon.22 The United
States, Japan, and many other countries requested an explanation of that
test, but have yet to receive a satisfactory answer. This lack of
transparency causes concern within the international community. [We can
expect continued **military modernization** and expansion of Chinese
interest within and **beyond the Pacific region**]{.underline}.23 The
2011 National Military Strategy suggests that [we can expect both state
and non-state actors to increasingly **challenge** free access
to]{.underline} and freedom of maneuver within **[the global
commons]{.underline}** and globally connected domains such as space and
cyberspace. The rapid spread of [technology will]{.underline} likely
[provide]{.underline} much more affordable anti-access and area-denial
[capabilities to]{.underline} states, [**criminals**, **traffickers**,
and **terrorist groups**]{.underline}. The proliferation of anti-access
and area denial capabilities could hinder United States and
international partner freedom of action. Non-state actors will likely
seek to capitalize on these weakening and corrupt failing states as
potential safe havens. The low barriers to entry into cyber and weapons
technologies, previously only held by states, will become available to
non-state actors to breed conflict and endanger stability.24 The 2011
National Military Strategy stipulates that **[deterrence]{.underline}**
[and **assurance**]{.underline} of free global commons in this
environment [will depend on the "ability to rapidly and globally project
power]{.underline}" through a posture that is "geographically
distributed, operationally resilient, and politically sustainable
through persistent partnering efforts."25 The 2005 Strategy for Homeland
Defense and Civil Support identifies key characteristics of the future
security environment as "the risk of wide-spread, diverse, rapidly
developing, and asymmetric challenges to the United States, our allies,
and interests." 26 [The most **immediate** and **likely threat**
to]{.underline} United States interests [is]{.underline} likely to be
**[terrorist groups]{.underline}** actively seeking to inflict mass
casualties, potentially [with]{.underline} the use of
**[w]{.underline}**eapons of **[m]{.underline}**ass
**[d]{.underline}**estruction, at vulnerable locations around the globe.
**[Simultaneously]{.underline}**, a powerful state such as [**China** or
an **alliance of hostile states**]{.underline} may present the most
dangerous threat of an uncertain, high-tech, sophisticated force of
growing capacity requiring continued United States modernization to
balance. 27 The combination of these most likely and most dangerous
threats requires a United States force that is postured to respond
quickly to crisis around the world while maintaining a sufficiently
modernized force necessary to defeat a near-peer adversary. The Fiscal
Landscape and **[Force Reduction]{.underline}** While the National
Security Strategy and National Military Strategy unconstrained ends
include global security with freedom of access to the global commons,
one must consider the available means when developing the ways to those
ends. 28 The world economy is presenting challenges to most of the
developed countries of the world. The United States has experienced more
than a decade in which spending has far exceeded revenue. 29 [In the
**U**]{.underline}nited **[S]{.underline}**tates, [nearly all of the
collected revenue can be expended on programs mandated by
law]{.underline}, such as Social Security, Medicaid, Medicare, and
interest on debt.30 [The **D**]{.underline}epartment
**[o]{.underline}**f **[D]{.underline}**efense spending [falls
within]{.underline} the portion of the budget that is negotiated
annually between the President and Congress, known as
**[discretionary]{.underline}** **[spending]{.underline}**. Within our
national discretionary spending, the Department of Defense budget makes
up the largest slice.31 Therefore, as lawmakers consider ways to reduce
spending, they will surely look to the Department of Defense for the
largest slice of savings. As the Secretary of Defense explores options
for budget reductions, he has the unenviable challenge of balancing
modernization, readiness, and capacity to ensure the military of the
future is postured to meet the requirements of the National Security
Strategy. According to the Department of Defense Comptroller, nearly a
third of defense spending is designated for personnel and related
programs.32 Research and development and a portion of procurement
dollars are being spent for modernization, totaling just over 18% of
defense spending. Simultaneously, operations and maintenance and the
remainder of procurement dollars being spent for readiness make up 47%
of defense spending.33 Therefore, [the **largest portion** of military
spending is used to maintain a **ready capacity** --
personnel]{.underline}. Simply surrendering all modernization efforts
would make a very small impact to the overall United States deficit
spending. In order to find savings that the nation needs within the
Department of Defense, reductions in all areas will be necessary. The
Department of Defense 2012 Defense Budget Priorities and Choices warns
that our military will likely face increased budget pressures. 34
Secretary of Defense Leon Panetta reminded an audience at the U.S.
Institute of Peace in June 2012 that in past defense drawdowns, which
occurred after almost every major conflict, the threats facing the
country, appeared to diminish. Unlike past post-conflict drawdowns,
today we continue to have significant threats. Terrorism, weapons
proliferation, cyber intrusion, and destabilizing behavior of nations
like Iran and North Korea continue to threaten the interests of United
States. 35 The 2011 National Military **[Strategy]{.underline}** [warns
against]{.underline} becoming [a **hollow force** with a large force
structure lacking **readiness**, training, and
**modernization**]{.underline}.36 Further, the Secretary of Defense in
his January 2012 updated priorities stated that this [**reduction in
resources** will]{.underline} "require innovative and creative solutions
to **[maintain]{.underline}** support for allied and partner
[**interoperability** and **build**]{.underline}ing **[partner
capacity]{.underline}**;" with particular emphasis on "thoughtful
choices required regarding the location and frequency of these
operations". 37 As resources diminish, it becomes more important to
precisely balance capacity, modernization, and readiness to preserve
United States' national interests. The Secretary of Defense's January
2012 Defense Budget Priorities and Choices clearly conceded that
**[overall]{.underline}** United States [**military capacity** will be
reduced in the]{.underline} face of the [current]{.underline} fiscal
[environment]{.underline}. [The **D**]{.underline}epartment
**[o]{.underline}**f **[D]{.underline}**efense [must]{.underline}
continue to **[reduce operating costs]{.underline}** [by reducing the
growth of manpower costs and finding further efficiencies in overhead
and headquarters]{.underline}. The Secretary of Defense further [noted
a]{.underline} requirement for [reduction in]{.underline} military
**[facilities]{.underline}** infrastructure [commensurate with **force
reductions**]{.underline}. This document clearly states, "[We cannot
afford to sustain infrastructure that is excess to our needs in this
budget environment]{.underline}."38

Food Crisis and what we can do to avoid it, University of California
Press, 2010, p. 20-26)

Three elements have changed in recent times, however. First, a good half
of all **[refugees]{.underline}**, even if they originate in rural
areas, now **[head for cities]{.underline}** as their
haven-[which]{.underline} in turn [puts]{.underline} great indirect
**[pressure on]{.underline}** the land and water
**[resources]{.underline}** that support the city and hence on the local
farmers who feed it. Second, the number of emigrants from the mon- eyed
and educated classes of countries facing scarcity of food, land, and
water and potential instability has risen sharply since the start of the
twenty-first century. Canada has regularly accepted close to a quarter
million migrants each year since 2000 and the United States around a
million.\"\' About 200 million people around the world each year foresee
trouble brewing in their homelands-including conflicts over food, land,
and water-and are moving with their families to avoid it. The refugee
wave, in other words, is often preceded by a far more orderly tide of
far- sighted emigrants. The third thing that has changed is the media.
When the great famines struck Russia and China during the middle of the
twentieth cen- tury, there were not only armed guards between the
refugees and escape but also, thanks to censorship, a generally low
awareness of the prosper- ity and personal opportunities afforded by the
outside world. Many people died where they lived rather than risking the
unknown. This no longer holds true: today television, magazines, and the
Internet are bursting with the charms of affluence, the prodigal lives
of celebrities, and the houses, luxury cars, consumer goods, and
sumptuous meals that one-third of humanity enjoys; these media are
ubiquitous and have pen- etrated to even the remotest corners of the
world. Potential refugees now know, at some level, that there is a far
better life to be had elsewhere if they have the strength, courage, and
means to reach for it. Abetted by modern transportation and people
smugglers, they now flee farther and more swiftly than ever to obtain
it. In 1845-51 lreland\'s staple potato crop was blighted, casting the
country into starvation and misery. The nation was critically dependent
on the potato because in Ireland a farmer could grow three times as much
food from potatoes as from grain, from the same area of land. When the
ensuing famine ended after ten years, 750,000 Irish had died and two
million had emigrated to the United States, Canada, and Great Britain.\"
The Great Irish Famine may belong to the nineteenth century, but it
carries undeniable messages for the twenty-first. It reveals the effect
of overreliance on a major food source, and even though few countries
to- day are as dependent on a single crop, [many crops around the world
are vulnerable to the loss of critical inputs such as water, fuel, or
fertilizer, to disease, or to weather disaster.]{.underline} Any of
these can unleash a local or re- gional famine-and the famine, in turn,
will release an outpouring of refugees. In a world as heavily populated
as ours, it is not hard to imag- ine how **[refugee
tsunamis]{.underline}** could result [from]{.underline} a general food
failure in the **[India]{.underline}**n subcontinent, **[Central
Asia]{.underline}**, China, sub-Saharan or [**North Africa**, or
Southeast or East Asia]{.underline}. Events of this scale are beyond all
previous human experience for the simple reason that [the world has
never been so populous]{.underline} or its resources so fragile. The
possibility of **[regional crises]{.underline}** [involving]{.underline}
twenty, fifty, even as many as two hundred or [**three hundred million**
refugees must now be seriously contemplated.]{.underline} Such floods
are unlikely to be stemmed by mili- tary force. They will alter the
politics, demography, and culture of entire regions. They will change
history. This is the most likely means by which the coming famine will
affect all citizens of Earth, both through the direct consequences of
refugee floods for receiving countries and through the effect on global
food prices and the cost to public revenues of redressing the problem.
Coupled with this is the [risk]{.underline} of **[wars]{.underline}**
breaking out over local disputes about food, land, and water and the
dangers that the [**major military powers** may be **sucked into these
vortices**]{.underline}, that [smaller nations]{.underline} newly
[**nuclear-armed** may become embroiled]{.underline}, and that shock
waves propagated by these conflicts will jar the global economy and
disrupt trade, sending food prices into a fresh spiral. Indeed, [an
increasingly **credible scenario** for **World War III** is]{.underline}
not so much a confrontation of superpowers and their allies as
[a]{.underline} festering, self- perpetuating [chain of **resource
conflicts**]{.underline} [driven by]{.underline} the widening gap
between food and energy supplies and [peoples\' need to secure
them]{.underline}.

#### Economic decline causes war -- best studies 

**Royal 10** (Jedediah, Director of Cooperative Threat Reduction at the
U.S. Department of Defense, 2010, "Economic Integration, Economic
Signaling and the Problem of Economic Crises," in Economics of War and
Peace: Economic, Legal and Political Perspectives, ed. Goldsmith and
Brauer, p. 213-214)//CMR

Less intuitive is how periods of [economic decline]{.underline} may
[increase]{.underline} the likelihood of external
[conflict]{.underline}. Political science literature has contributed a
moderate degree of attention to the impact of economic decline and the
security and defence behaviour of interdependent states.
**[Research]{.underline}** in this vein [has been considered at
**systemic**, dyadic and national **levels**.]{.underline} Several
notable contributions follow. [First, on the systemic level,
**Pollins**]{.underline} (2008) [advances]{.underline} [Modelski and
Thompson\'s]{.underline} (1996) [work on leadership cycle theory,
finding]{.underline} that [rhythms in]{.underline} the global [economy
are associated with the **rise and fall** of a **pre-eminent power** and
the often **bloody transition**]{.underline} from one pre-eminent leader
to the next. As such. exogenous shocks such as economic
[crises]{.underline} could usher in a redistribution of relative power
(see also Gilpin. 1981) that [lead]{.underline}s [to uncertainty about
power balances, increasing the **risk of miscalculation**]{.underline}
(Fearon. 1995). Alternatively, even a relatively certain redistribution
of power could lead to a permissive environment for conflict as a rising
power may seek to challenge a declining power (Werner, 1999).
Separately, Pollins (1996) also shows that global economic cycles
combined with parallel leadership cycles impact the likelihood of
conflict among major, medium and small powers, although he suggests that
the causes and connections between global economic conditions and
security conditions remain unknown. Second. on a dyadic level,
[Copeland]{.underline}\'s (1996. 2000) theory of trade expectations
[suggests]{.underline} that \'future expectation of trade is a
significant variable in understanding economic conditions and security
behaviour of states. He argues that [interdependent states
are]{.underline} likely to [gain]{.underline} pacific [benefits from
trade so long as they have an **optimistic view**]{.underline} of future
trade relations. However, [if]{.underline} the
[expectations]{.underline} of future trade [decline]{.underline}.
particularly for difficult to replace items such as energy resources,
the [**likelihood for conflict increases**, as states will be inclined
to **use force** to **gain** access to]{.underline} those
[**resources.** Crises]{.underline} could potentially be the
[trigger]{.underline} for decreased trade expectations either on its own
or because it triggers [**protectionist moves**]{.underline} by
interdependent states.\' Third, others have considered the link between
economic decline and external armed conflict at a national level.
Blomberg and [Hess]{.underline} (2002) [find a **strong correlation**
between **internal**]{.underline} conflict **[and external
conflict]{.underline}**, particularly [during periods of **economic
downturn**]{.underline}. They write, The linkages between internal and
external conflict and prosperity are strong and mutually reinforcing.
Economic conflict tends to spawn internal conflict, which in turn
returns the favour. Moreover, the presence of a recession tends to
amplify the extent to which international and external conflict
self-reinforce each other. (Blomber & Hess,. 2002. p. 84) Economic
decline has also been linked with an increase in the likelihood of
terrorism (Blomberg. Hess. & Weerapana. 2004). which has the capacity to
spill across borders and lead to external tensions. Furthermore, crises
generally reduce the popularity of a sitting government.
[**\'Diversionary theory\'** suggests]{.underline} that, [when facing
unpopularity]{.underline} arising [from economic decline, sitting
governments]{.underline} have increased incentives to
[fabricate]{.underline} external [**military conflicts** to create a
**\'rally around the flag\'** effect]{.underline}. Wang (1996). DeRouen
(1995), and Blomberg, Hess, and Thacker (2006) find supporting evidence
showing that economic decline and use of force are at least indirectly
correlated. Gelpi (1997), Miller (1999). and Kisangani and Pickering
(2009) suggest that [the tendency towards diversionary tactics are
greater for democratic states than autocratic states]{.underline}, due
to the fact that democratic leaders are generally more susceptible to
being removed from office due to lack of domestic support. DeRouen
(2000) has provided evidence showing that periods of weak economic
performance in the United States, and thus weak Presidential popularity,
are statistically linked to an increase in the use of force. In summary,
recent economic scholarship positively correlates economic integration
with an increase in the frequency of economic crises, whereas
[**political science scholarship** links **economic decline** with
**external conflict** at systemic. dyadic and national
level,]{.underline} This implied connection between integration, crises
and armed conflict has not featured prominently in the economic-security
debate and deserves more attention.

#### The risk of WMD terror has never been greater -- ISIS has [means]{.underline} and [motive]{.underline} 

**Johnson 18** (Bridget, senior fellow specializing in terrorism
analysis at the Haym Salomon Center, Senior Risk Analyst for Gate 15, a

Difficult' to Keep Terror Groups from Getting WMD," 2-13,
<https://www.hstoday.us/subject-matter-areas/counterterrorism/terror-groups-keen-wmd-never-been-more-difficult-prevent/)//CMR>

[Terrorist groups are **as interested as ever** in
acquiring]{.underline} weapons of mass destruction \[[WMD\] in a global
landscape where]{.underline} chemical, biological, radiological and
nuclear [\[CBRN\] agents have grown more difficult to
track]{.underline}, senators heard from Defense officials last week.
Assistant Defense Secretary for Homeland Defense and Global Security
Kenneth Rapuano told the Senate Armed Services Subcommittee on Emerging
Threats and Capabilities that "[rapid tech]{.underline}nological
[advancements and increased access to dual use
tech]{.underline}nologies, [expertise, and materials that can be used
for both peaceful and military purposes heighten the risk that
adversaries can more easily seek or acquire WMD]{.underline}." "It has
never been more difficult to prevent adversaries from acquiring the
materials or expertise necessary to develop WMD or use CBRN materials in
intentional attacks," he said. "Additionally, the speed, volume, and
coverage of international travel means that naturally occurring
pathogens of security concern can spread worldwide in days, potentially
having the same catastrophic consequences of a deliberate biological
attack." The Intelligence Community, State Department, Department of
Homeland Security, Department of Energy and Justice Department "all play
critical roles in detecting threats, preventing attacks on the homeland,
and working with foreign partners to stop and respond to incidents," he
added. Rapuano noted that best efforts at prevention only go so far,
thus the agency coalition "must be prepared to contain and reduce CBRN
threats once they have developed." "DoD is postured to isolate,
identify, neutralize, and dispose of CBRN threats before they can reach
our borders," he said. That includes concern about reports of ongoing
use of chemical agents by the regime of Bashar al-Assad in Syria, where
"the U.S. and our coalition partners continue to exploit opportunities
on the ground to better understand and disrupt their CW networks." "We
must anticipate that [our adversaries will continue to evolve and
develop increasingly sophisticated methods to pursue, develop, or deploy
CBRN weapons]{.underline}," Rapuano stressed. Marine Corps Lt. Gen.
Joseph Osterman, deputy commander of United States Special Operations
Command, emphasized the importance of increased integration of
intelligence, planning and assessments in a counter-WMD fusion center
"dedicated to coordinating information flow and planning, fusing
intelligence and operations, and providing the WMD community of action a
single point of contact for DOD operational capability." Chairwoman Joni
Ernst (R-Iowa) asked Rapuano which WMD threat concerned him most at this
point. Rapuano picked biotechnology, due to the "rapid advances and
ubiquitous availability" today. "[Things that you can buy on the web now
and essentially do a paint-by-numbers instruction were the province of
Nobel Prize-winning scientists only decades ago, and that really levels
the playing field for any actor looking to develop biotechnology,
biological agents and novelly engineered agents that can present a real
threat,"]{.underline} he added. The assistant secretary confirmed that
"[both Al-Qaeda and ISIS are interested in chemical, biological,
nuclear," and "certainly would be if they had opportunity to acquire the
materials and know-how."]{.underline} He wouldn't elaborate in open
session.

#### \--Nuclear terror's [likely]{.underline} and causes [extinction]{.underline} -- it makes every conflict more escalatory, spurs global econ depression, and drives a state of emergency -- prefer [recent]{.underline}, [well-developed]{.underline} studies over [generic defense]{.underline}

Scientists, 2018, <https://doi.org/10.1080/00963402.2018.1436812)//CMR>

Though hard to accept, the [detonation of a nuclear device -- by
**states** or **non-state** actors -- is]{.underline} today a
**[plausible]{.underline}** scenario. And while much of the world's
focus has been on the current nuclear weapons arsenals possessed by
states -- about 14,550 warheads, all of which carry the risk of
intentional or unintentional use -- [the **threat of nuclear terrorism**
is here and **increasing**. For more than a decade, **Al Qaeda**, **Aum
Shinrikyo**, and]{.underline} other **[terrorist groups]{.underline}**
have [expressed]{.underline} their [desire to acquire fissile material
to build and detonate an improvised nuclear bomb. None]{.underline} of
them [could fulfill that goal -- so far.]{.underline} But [that does not
mean that they will not succeed in the future.]{.underline}

Making matters [worse, there is evidence of an illicit market for
nuclear weapons-usable materials. There are **sellers in search** of
potential **buyers**, as shown by]{.underline} the dismantlement of a
[nuclear **smuggling**]{.underline} network [in **Moldova**]{.underline}
in 2015. [There]{.underline} certainly [are plenty of sites]{.underline}
from which [to obtain nuclear material. According to the 2016 Nuclear
Security Index]{.underline} by the Nuclear Threat Initiative, [**24
countries** still host inventories of nuclear weapons-usable materials,
stored in facilities with **different degrees of
security**.]{.underline}

And in terms of risk, [it is not necessary for a given country to
possess nuclear weapons, weapons-usable materials, or nuclear facilities
for it to be useful to nuclear terrorists: **Structural** and
**institutional weaknesses** in a country may make it **favorable**
for]{.underline} the [illicit trade]{.underline} of materials.
[**Permeable boundaries**, high]{.underline} levels of [**corruption**,
**weaknesses** in **judicial systems**, and **consequent
impunity**]{.underline} may [give rise to]{.underline} a series of
[transactions]{.underline} and other events, [which]{.underline} could
**[end in]{.underline}** a **[nuclear attack]{.underline}**. The truth
is that, at this stage, [**no** country]{.underline} in possession of
nuclear weapons or weapons-usable materials [can
**guarantee**]{.underline} their [full protection]{.underline} against
nuclear terrorism or nuclear smuggling.

Because [we live in a world of **growing insecurity**]{.underline},
where [explicit and tacit agreements between]{.underline} the [relevant
powers -- which **upheld global stability** during the post-Cold War --
are **giving way** to **increasing mistrust** and
**hostility**]{.underline}, a question arises: How would our lives be
affected if a current terrorist group such as the Islamic State (ISIS),
or new terrorist groups in the future, succeed in evolving from today's
Manchester style "low-tech" attacks to a "high-tech" one, involving a
nuclear bomb, detonated in a capital city, anywhere in the world?

We attempted to answer this question in a report developed by a
high-level multidisciplinary expert group convened by the NPSGlobal
Foundation for the Latin American and Caribbean Leadership Network. We
found that there would be multiple harmful effects that would spread
promptly around the globe (Arguello and Buis 2016); a more detailed
analysis is below, which highlights the need for the creation of a
comprehensive nuclear security system. The consequences of a terrorist
nuclear attack A small and primitive 1-kiloton fission bomb (with a
yield of about one-fifteenth of the one dropped on Hiroshima, and
certainly much less sophisticated; cf. Figure 1), detonated in any large
capital city of the developed world, would cause an unprecedented
catastrophic scenario. An estimate of direct effects in the attack's
location includes a death toll of 7,300-to-23,000 people and
12,600-to-57,000 people injured, depending on the target's geography and
population density. Total physical destruction of the city's
infrastructure, due to the blast (shock wave) and thermal radiation,
would cover a radius of about 500 meters from the point of detonation
(also known as ground zero), while ionizing radiation greater than 5
Sieverts -- compatible with the deadly acute radiation syndrome -- would
expand within an 850-meter radius. From the environmental point of view,
such an area would be unusable for years. In addition, radioactive
fallout would expand in an area of about 300 square kilometers,
depending on meteorological conditions (cf. Figure 2).

But the [consequences]{.underline} would go far beyond the effects in
the target country, however, and [**promptly propagate worldwide**.
Global and national security, economy and finance, international
governance and its framework, national political systems,
and]{.underline} the [behavior of governments and individuals would all
be put under severe trial.]{.underline} The severity of the effects at a
national level, however, would depend on the countries' level of
development, geopolitical location, and resilience.

[Global security and regional/national defense schemes would be
**strongly affected**]{.underline}. An [increase in **global distrust**
would **spark rising tensions** among countries and **blocs**, that
could]{.underline} even [lead to the brink of **nuclear weapons
use**]{.underline} by states (if, for instance, a sponsor country is
identified). The consequences of [such a shocking scenario
would]{.underline} include a **[decrease]{.underline}** in [states'
**self-control,** an **escalation** of **present conflicts**
and]{.underline} the [**emergence** of **new ones,** accompanied
by]{.underline} an [**increase** in **military unilateralism** and
**military expenditures.**]{.underline}

Regarding the economic and financial impacts, [a **severe global
economic depression** would rise]{.underline} from the attack, likely
**[lasting for years]{.underline}**. Its duration would be strongly
dependent on the course of the crisis. The main results of such a crisis
would include a 2 percent fall of growth in global Gross Domestic
Product, and a 4 percent decline of international trade in the two years
following the attack (cf. Figure 3). In the case of developing and
less-developed countries, the [economic impacts would]{.underline} also
[include a shortage of **high-tech**nology **products** such as
**medicines**, as well as a fall in]{.underline}
**[f]{.underline}**oreign **[d]{.underline}**irect
**[i]{.underline}**nvestment [and]{.underline} a [**severe decline** of
international **humanitarian aid**]{.underline} toward low-income
countries. We expect an increase of unemployment and poverty in all
countries. [**Global poverty** would raise]{.underline} about **[4
percent]{.underline}** after the attack, which implies that at least
[**30 million** more]{.underline} people [would be living in **extreme
poverty**]{.underline}, in addition to the current estimated 767
million.

In the area of international relations, we [would]{.underline} expect a
**[breakdown]{.underline}** [of key doctrines involving politics,
security, and relations among states.]{.underline} These international
[tensions]{.underline} could [lead to]{.underline} a **[collapse of the
nuclear order]{.underline}** as we know it today, [with a consequent
**setback** of nuclear disarmament and **nonproliferation**]{.underline}
commitments. In other words, [the **whole system** based on]{.underline}
the Nuclear [Non- Proliferation]{.underline} Treaty [would be put under
severe trial.]{.underline} After the attack, there would be a
reassessment of existing security doctrines, and a deep review of
concepts such as nuclear deterrence, no-first-use, proportionality, and
negative security assurances.

Finally, the behavior of governments and individuals would also change
radically. [**Internal chaos** fueled by the media and social
networks]{.underline} would **[threaten governance at all
levels]{.underline}**, with greater impact on those countries with weak
institutional frameworks. [Social turbulence would emerge]{.underline}
in most countries, [with consequent attempts by governments to impose
restrictions on]{.underline} personal [freedoms]{.underline} to preserve
order -- possibly by [declaring a state of siege or **state of
emergency**]{.underline} -- and legislation would surely become tougher
on human rights. [There would also be a **significant increase** in
**social fragmentation** -- with a **deepening** of **antagonistic
views**, **mistrust**, and **intolerance**,]{.underline} both within
countries and towards others -- and a resurgence of large-scale social
movements fostered by ideological interests and easily mobilized through
social media.

#### \--Bioterror attack risks extinction

**Myhrvold 13** (Nathan Myhrvold, PhD in Theoretical and Mathematical
Physics @ Princeton, "Strategic terrorism," July 2013, The Lawfare
Research Paper Series research paper no. 2)

As horrible as this would be, such a pandemic is by¶ no means the worst
attack one can imagine, for several reasons. First, most of the classic
bioweapons are based¶ on 1960s and 1970s technology because the 1972
treaty halted bioweapons development efforts in the United states and
most other Western countries. second, the rus- sians, although solidly
committed to biological weapons long after the treaty deadline, were
never on the cutting edge of biological research. [Third and most
important, the **science and tech**nology of **molecular biology** have
made **enormous advances**, utterly **transforming the field** in the
last few decades]{.underline}. high school biology students routinely
perform molecular-biology manipulations that would have been impossible
even for the best superpower-funded pro- gram back in the heyday of
biological-weapons research.¶ [The **biowarfare** methods of the 1960s
and 19**70s** are now]{.underline} as **[antiquated]{.underline}** as
the lumbering mainframe computers of that era. tomorrow's terrorists
will have vastly more deadly bugs to choose from.¶ consider this
sobering development: in 2001, australian researchers working on
mousepox, a nonlethal virus that infects mice (as chickenpox does in
humans), accidentally discovered that a simple genetic modifica- tion
transformed the virus.10, 11 instead of producing mild symptoms, the new
virus killed 60% of even those mice already immune to the naturally
occurring strains of mousepox. The new virus, moreover, was unaffected¶
by any existing vaccine or antiviral drug. a team of researchers at
saint louis University led by mark Buller picked up on that work and, by
late 2003, found a way to improve on it: Buller's variation on mousepox
was 100% lethal, although his team of investigators also devised
combination vaccine and antiviral therapies that were partially
effective in protecting animals from the engineered strain.12, 13
another saving grace is that¶ the genetically altered virus is no longer
contagious. of course, it is quite possible that future tinkering with
the virus will change that property, too.¶ strong reasons exist to
believe that the genetic modi- fications Buller made to mousepox would
work for other poxviruses and possibly for other classes of viruses as
well. might the same techniques allow chickenpox or another poxvirus
that infects humans to be turned into a 100% le- thal bioweapon, perhaps
one that is resistant to any known antiviral therapy? i've asked this
question of experts many times, and no one has yet replied that such a
manipulation couldn't be done.¶ This case is just one example. many more
are pouring out of scientific journals and conferences every year. [Just
last year, the journal Nature published a controversial study done at
the University of Wisconsin--madison in which virologists enumerated the
changes one would need to make to a highly lethal strain of bird flu to
make it easily transmit- ted from one mammal to another]{.underline}.14¶
[Biotechnology is **advancing so rapidly** that it is hard to keep track
of all the new potential threats]{.underline}. nor is it clear that
anyone is even trying. in addition to lethality and drug resistance,
many other parameters can be played with, given that the infectious
power of an epidemic depends on many properties, including the length of
the latency period during which a person is contagious but asymptomatic.
delaying the onset of serious symptoms allows each new case to spread to
more people and thus makes the virus harder to stop.¶ This dynamic is
perhaps best illustrated by hiv, which is very difficult to transmit
compared with smallpox and many other viruses. intimate contact is
needed, and even then, the infection rate is low. The balancing factor
is that hiv can take years to progress to aids, which can then take many
more years to kill the victim. What makes hiv so dangerous is that
infected people have lots of opportu- nities to infect others. This
property has allowed hiv to claim more than 30 million lives so far, and
approximately 34 million people are now living with this virus and
facing a highly uncertain future.15¶ [**[a virus]{.mark}** genetically
**[engineered to infect]{.mark} its host [quickly]{.mark}**, to
[generate symptoms slowly]{.mark}---say, only after weeks or
months---**[and]{.mark}** to **[spread]{.mark}** easily
**[through]{.mark} the [air]{.mark}** or by casual contact would be
vastly more devastating than HIV. It **[could silently penetrate the
population]{.mark}** to unleash its dead- ly effects
suddenly]{.underline}. This type of epidemic would be almost impossible
to combat because most of the infections would occur before the epidemic
became obvious.¶ [[a]{.mark} technologically sophisticated [terrorist
group could develop]{.mark} such [a virus]{.mark} and kill a large part
of humanity with it. Indeed, terrorists may not have to develop it
themselves: some scientist may do so first and publish the details.¶
given the rate at which biologists are making discoveries about viruses
and the immune system, at some point in the near future, someone may
create **artificial pathogens** that could **drive the human race [to
extinction]{.mark}**]{.underline}. indeed, a detailed
species-elimination plan of this nature was openly proposed in a
scientific journal.¶ The ostensible purpose of that particular research
was to suggest a way to extirpate the malaria mosquito, but similar
techniques could be directed toward humans.16 When i've talked to
molecular biologists about this meth- od, they are quick to point out
that it is slow and easily detectable and could be fought with biotech
remedies. if you challenge them to come up with improvements to the
suggested attack plan, however, they have plenty of ideas.¶ [modern
biotechnology will soon be capable, if it is not already, of bringing
about the demise of the human race]{.underline}--- or at least of
killing a sufficient number of people to end high-tech civilization and
set humanity back 1,000 years or more. That terrorist groups could
achieve this level of tech- nological sophistication may seem
far-fetched, but keep in mind that [it takes only a handful of
individuals to accom-plish these tasks]{.underline}. never has lethal
power of this potency been accessible to so few, so easily. even more
dramatically than nuclear proliferation, modern biological science has
frighteningly undermined the correlation between the le- thality of a
weapon and its cost, a fundamentally stabilizing mechanism throughout
history. access to extremely lethal agents---lethal enough to
exterminate Homo sapiens---will be available to anybody with a solid
background in biology, terrorists included.

It's the totally unthinkable question that Americans find themselves
confronting this week: **[What would]{.underline}** President Donald
**[Trump]{.underline}** **[do in a genuine national
crisis?]{.underline}** After a series of overseas terror attacks and
some startling statements about nuclear weapons and torture, the world's
attention has turned to Trump's foreign policy---an area where [he has
few advisers, no experience and a tendency to fire off answers and deal
with the fallout later]{.underline}. The reality of a Trump candidacy
has begun to set in: If Trump is elected and a major national crisis
hits, he'll be the one with his hands on the button. He'll be at the
head of the table in the Situation Room. His decisions would steer
America's immediate response and could set the course of American policy
for years. What's hard to project with a normal politician is nearly
impossible to guess with Trump. He has no foreign policy or public
service experience, which means there's no official record to consult,
and his public statements, while extreme, have been vague. The
saber-rattling statements that excite his supporters also suggest he has
disregard for linchpins of the global order like NATO, the Geneva
Conventions and the hard-won global nuclear-weapons limits. Politico
Magazine asked foreign policy and counterterrorism experts, historians,
Trump biographers, even psychologists to take a serious guess at how
he'd handle the days after a terrorist attack in the United States---all
based on what they know about Trump the candidate and what he'll be
facing if he gets elected. The responses were at times surprising, and
at times unsettling. Some focused on Trump's apparent hesitancy about
sending troops into combat, and predicted he'd act more like President
Barack Obama than President George W. Bush. Others looked at his
immigration rhetoric and foresaw a country newly divided, with patrols
stalking Muslim neighborhoods and religious hatreds bubbling to the
surface. One biographer, familiar with Trump's primal response to any
perceived insult, drew a frightening picture of a quickly escalating set
of attacks and responses, with major cities caught in the crossfire.
But, then again, another predicted that Trump would simply withdraw to
his Twitter account, riding out the threat with a lot of talk and little
action. \*\*\* "[He invites]{.underline} President Vladimir [Putin to
the White House]{.underline} ... [announces]{.underline} that [America
is withdrawing from NATO]{.underline} and ... [visits Tehran to open up
a new]{.underline} American [embassy]{.underline}." Jacob Heilbrunn is
editor of the National Interest. Donald [Trump]{.underline} has already
made it clear that he [regards]{.underline} much of [the global
order]{.underline} that was established by Harry S. Truman and Dean
Acheson after World War II [as]{.underline} impotent and
[obsolete]{.underline}. Almost as soon as he's sworn the oath to serve
as commander-in-chief, Trump will go to work to create a new one based
on the exercise of American military power and cooperation with
Washington's traditional adversaries such as Russia. So the real
question may be this: How would **[a 9/11 event]{.underline}**
**[accelerate]{.underline}** **[his]{.underline}** already **[existing
efforts to upend the American national security
establishment]{.underline}**? Following the attack, President Trump
builds upon his initial attempts to restore relations with Russia, which
included nuclear arms-control negotiations. He now invites President
Vladimir Putin to the White House---complete with a state dinner in his
honor. Trump, the consummate dealmaker, says that it's imperative to let
bygones be bygones in the interest of a united front with Russia to
defeat the Islamic peril. At the same time, [Trump
announces]{.underline} that [America is withdrawing from NATO and
concedes Russia's sphere of influence (SOI) in]{.underline} Eastern
[Europe]{.underline}. [England]{.underline}, which has already withdrawn
from the European Union, [joins the U.S-Russia alliance]{.underline}. In
following this course, **[Trump invokes World War II]{.underline}** to
declare that he's simply following in Franklin Roosevelt's footsteps.
All of this is [music to the Kremlin's ears]{.underline}, which has
consistently bemoaned the fact that the Obama administration has spurned
its offers of cooperation. British, Russian and American warplanes bomb
targets in Syria and Iraq that served as staging grounds for the Islamic
State's assault on America. In addition, **[Trump pivots
from]{.underline}** America's traditional alliance with **[Saudi Arabia
to]{.underline}** working with **[Iran]{.underline}**; to general
astonishment, he visits Tehran to open up a new American embassy. Trump
says that the only predictable thing about his presidency is that he
will always seek to be unpredictable. **[Domestically]{.underline}**,
**[Trump]{.underline}** takes a hard line, arguing that it's time to
take the handcuffs off the FBI and CIA. He **[embarks]{.underline}**
upon **[a program to place]{.underline}** American **[Muslims in
camps]{.underline}**, a program overseen by the Justice Department as it
was during the Roosevelt administration in World War II, when
Japanese-Americans were interned. The Washington Post and New York Times
editorial pages denounce Trump's new policy, but it meets with general
approbation among the American population, a number of [Democratic
Senators and Congressmen in swing states sign off]{.underline} on the
measure, and [the Supreme Court upholds it in an 8-1
decision]{.underline}. With his decisive moves, Trump enrages liberal
and conservative elites but his approval ratings soar to over 80 percent
in numerous polls. The era of Trump has begun. \*\*\* "Tweet after tweet
congratulating himself on foreseeing the attack and ridiculing the
terrorists' masculinity, their intelligence, their family members, their
ethnic identity and/or religion" Gwenda Blair is author of The Trumps:
Three Generations That Built an Empire. Twitter would be Trump's
front-line counter-attack. Tweet after tweet congratulating himself on
foreseeing the attack and ridiculing the terrorists' masculinity, their
intelligence, their family members, their ethnic identity and/or
religion---along with any civil libertarian or moderate voices asking
for caution, consultation with allies, or more operational and regional
intelligence before initiating counter-offensives against targets either
inside or outside the United States. Next would be live streamed
appearances on CNN, Fox, MSNBC, etc. in which Trump denounced the
terrorists, their supporters, and any opposition to the use of any and
all tactics against captured terrorist suspects. Then he would change
into Donald Trump Menswear 100% silk PJs with gold-embroidered POTUS
seal on front pocket, stretch out on a super-luxury top-grain leather
Trump Home Furnishings chaise, chow down on a prime-cut Trump steak, and
turn on WWE. In the event the attacks continued, he might be moved to
more action. Potential steps might include **[curfews, quarantines
and]{.underline}**/or **[internment]{.underline}** in certain
communities, required [loyalty oaths]{.underline} for government
employees, teachers, uniformed services, etc., civil defense drills in
schools, factories, offices, and other large installations such as
airports, train stations, subway systems, and the adoption and frequent
testing of alerts through texts and loudspeakers. \*\*\* "There would be
no rallying around the idea of America and what it stands for because
Americans will be fighting about just that" Ian Bremmer is president of
Eurasia Group and a global research professor at New York University.
It's not an easy thing to say, but [America was fortunate that 9/11
happened when it did]{.underline}. [The United States was in great shape
back then, as was its economy. There was no serious social discontent
bubbling]{.underline} beneath the surface, and inequality was nowhere
near the wedge issue it is today. [Washington's alliances around the
world were strong]{.underline} back then, and [China was still
weak]{.underline}. Washington even had [decent relations with
Moscow]{.underline}---and they improved after the tragedy. So when 9/11
happened, the entire country---and the world---rallied around the
president. That's **[a far cry from]{.underline}** where the United
States is **[today]{.underline}**. And let's be honest---[Trump in the
White House during a real national security crisis is as close to a
near-dystopian]{.underline} America as can be imagined. If terrorists
were to hit the United States, America's political response would be
closer to what France went through following its November attacks, with
Trump playing the reactionary role called for France's ex-President
Nicolas Sarkozy. [He'd push for overall surveillance and monitoring of
Muslims]{.underline} in the United States. I'd imagine there would be
[house arrests and deportations]{.underline} for many. And while some
Americans would cheer this knee-jerk response, most will be horrified to
find themselves living in a country where nothing more than your
religion makes you suspect. Europe will be horrified as well, and won't
be near the steadfast ally it was in 2001. There would be no rallying
around the idea of America and what it stands for because Americans will
be fighting about just that. \*\*\* "A president with that personality
would experience a large terrorist event as an enormous narcissistic
injury ... and **[his rage would be white-hot]{.underline}**" Martha
Stout is a psychologist and author of The Sociopath Next Door. As a
psychologist who has spent her career studying human personality and its
variations, I can tell you that personalities don't have an off switch,
not even for dire emergencies. If we suffered another brutal terrorist
attack, I fear that President [Trump would exhibit the same bombast,
rage and impulsivity]{.underline} that he has shown in the campaign
trail and imperil his fellow human beings, perhaps with even more
lasting effects than those of the disaster itself. The personality that
underlies Trump's observable behaviors---a demeanor of personal
superiority, a focus on being admired, immediate heated anger when
challenged, an emphasis on unlimited success, and an apparent
expectation of automatic compliance---would be problematic in a U.S.
president at any time, and **[plainly dangerous]{.underline}** should
our nation experience another terrorist atrocity. A president with such
a personality would experience a large terrorist event as an attack on
him personally, **[an enormous "narcissistic
injury"]{.underline}**---what psychologists call a perceived threat to
self-worth---and his rage would be white-hot. The anger we have seen
directed at protesters during Trump rallies would be multiplied by an
unknowable factor. That whisper in the ear from an aide, telling him
that an event had occurred, would instantly evoke **[a need for
reprisal]{.underline}**, a desire **[to attack]{.underline}** and to do
so **[right away, using airstrikes]{.underline}**, **[boots on
the]{.underline}** **[ground, torture in interrogations and any
other]{.underline}** "powerful" **[tactic]{.underline}** that occurred
to him. If there is a positive thread in this psychologically predicted
scenario, it is that such a huge perceived injury to Trump's sense of
self-worth would compel him to focus utterly on the source of that
injury. He would be single-mindedly intent on destroying the terrorists
and would have no tolerance for those who might wish to refashion the
country's pain and anger into a willingness to attack a different
target. In the aftermath of our waking nightmare in 2001, we might have
benefited from some portion of that single-mindedness. Still, with a
President Trump, the surge of bigotry and the resulting deportation and
internment efforts would do their own inestimable damage. [Given a
re-terrorized nation, Trump's famous skill at gaining allegiance from
people through]{.underline} their heightened [fears]{.underline}
[might]{.underline} very well **[sway Congress]{.underline}** and result
**[in]{.underline}** the actual implementation of some of his ideas:
**[a wholesale military response]{.underline}**, a **[lockdown of Muslim
communities]{.underline}**, and **[attempts to deport]{.underline}**
large groups of people. With an unapologetically self-involved and
rage-prone commander-in-chief---which is what we evidently would be
getting with a President Trump---**[nothing]{.underline}** would be
**[off the table]{.underline}**. \*\*\* "We must also hope that a
President Trump, unlike candidate Trump, would show some signs of
awareness of the nature of the threat" Ambassador Dennis Ross is a
long-time U.S. Mideast negotiator and author of the recently published
Doomed to Succeed: The US-Israeli relationship from Truman to Obama. If
such an attack takes place, it would be clear that Trump's
ill-considered readiness to stop Muslims from gaining entry to the
country has not worked---no surprise here, as he is playing to the ISIS
playbook that seeks polarization and needs the image of a war on Muslims
to attract followers. The fact that Trump has little use for our
alliances like NATO also means in the first instance, his response would
likely be to go it alone. But against whom? Did the attackers come from
ISIS and had they gone to Syria? Was al Qaeda competing with ISIS to
show it remains relevant and capable of producing larger mass casualty
acts of terror than ISIS? Should it be ISIS, we know from candidate
Trump that when it comes to ISIS he will listen to the military. But the
military has not been notably more inclined than President Obama to
commit forces on the ground. However, should ISIS prove to be
responsible for a 9/11 type attack---and clearly the events in Brussels
show its leaders are trying---we will need a far more dramatic effort
against them on the group to demonstrate they are losing, and will lose
further from any such attacks. Perhaps Trump, who has made it clear he
is reluctant to use ground forces, will call for carpet-bombing as a
punishment for ISIS. That will shift the onus onto us without removing
ISIS from Mosul or Raqqa---the key symbols of their success to date. In
the aftermath of a 9/11 type attack we need to inflict real and symbolic
setbacks on ISIS to blunt its appeal and to restore confidence among our
own citizenry and that of those very Sunnis we would want to partner
with us. Are they likely to partner with us if we can't offer
unmistakable signs of success and of our resolve? They won't take a new
president's word for it---or buy his "believe me" declarations. Will
Trump change and see the value of working with others? Let's hope so,
but there is little in his posture to date that suggests he will do so.
We must also hope that a President Trump, unlike candidate Trump, would
show some signs of awareness of the nature of the threat. Show some
signs of awareness that actually having alliances like NATO helps with
partners, helps with intelligence, and helps legitimize our actions. A
President Trump will need to frame the challenge clearly and spell out
the mission and objective in a way that does not walk away from the
values that we embody. And a President Trump would have to show he will
act not impulsively but effectively, recognizing that a longer-term
strategy for the Middle East will be necessary, a strategy that is
designed to shore up the state system. That system is under attack and
restoring it is necessary to prevent ISIS or its successors from having
the operational space in which to thrive and develop. Withdrawing from
the Middle East will only foster a vacuum that allows the most extreme
forces to emerge and pose more threat to states in the region. Candidate
Trump's instinct toward isolation can hardly be reassuring in this
regard. \*\*\* "Let us imagine that when the new president enters the
Situation Room to talk over the latest disaster, he's got Steve Hadley
and Eric Edelman and Meghan O'Sullivan around the table" Stephen
Sestanovich is a professor at Columbia University and a senior fellow at
the Council on Foreign Relations. In the national-security business, we
are often asked to think the unthinkable---nuclear war, chaos,
pestilence. Contemplating a Donald Trump presidency should be all in a
day's work. Even so, I find myself wanting to dodge the worst-case
scenario. Perhaps this unlikely chief executive will prepare for his day
of reckoning by surrounding himself with solid advisers and by tending,
however belatedly, to America's most important global relationships?
It's not absurd to hope that long before taking office President Trump
will have reached out to the Republican foreign-policy establishment and
that, by playing on personal ambition and patriotism, he will have
convinced those who hoped to work for President Rubio or President Jeb
Bush to serve him instead. Nor is it absurd to think that, before a new
9/11, he will have realized that the United States cannot get much done
in the world unless key allies are with us. So let us imagine that when
the new president enters the Situation Room to talk over the latest
disaster, he's got Steve Hadley and Eric Edelman and Meghan O'Sullivan
around the table. (And maybe vice president Condi Rice ready to fly off
to Brussels to represent him at the next day's emergency session of
NATO.) Like I say, none of this is absurd. But I don't expect it.
Whatever you think of the results, the Republican Party's A-team was
across the table from George W. Bush on September 11, 2001. On September
11, 2017, by contrast, we are likely to have a foreign-policy line-up
that reflects the party's nervous breakdown in the 2016 campaign. The
administration will be thinly staffed and often inexperienced, divided
against itself, suspicious of the professional bureaucracy, struggling
to develop coherent policies, and never sure what the president wants.
Donald Trump's own ideas and instincts have to be part of the picture we
draw in our minds of how the United States would respond to a major new
terrorist attack. But the mind of the president is not the only thing to
worry about. When one of the central institutions of the American
political system simultaneously cracks up and wins the White House, the
country's ability to formulate and implement effective policy will
inevitably be damaged. The same will be true of our ability to call on
support from others. On September 10, 2001, no one thought that America
was in a profound internal crisis, much less fighting for its political
sanity. Apart from kooks, no one thought America deserved---or was
somehow asking---to be attacked. No one doubted the value of being our
friend. In 2017, in the early days of a Trump administration, all this
will have changed. A president who has made hostility to Muslims and
other minorities his calling card, who has suggested NATO may be
"obsolete," who boasts that we have our own problems to solve, may find
the rest of the world ready to let us do so. Around the table in the Sit
Room, no one may say this to the boss. But everyone will know it. \*\*\*
"I'm betting the Trumpian response would be a lot closer to what Barack
Obama might do than Bush 43" Aaron David Miller is vice president for
new initiatives and a distinguished scholar at the Woodrow Wilson
International Center for Scholars. His most recent book is The End of
Greatness: Why America Can't Have (and Doesn't Want) Another Great
President. Politics during a presidential campaign is about telling
folks what they'd like to hear; governing is about what they're likely
to get. And Donald Trump the candidate operates in a fantasy world on
foreign policy bringing to the debate on America's role in the world a
fantastical mix of isolationist and muscular nationalist rhetoric.
Meanwhile back on planet earth, Donald Trump as president will confront
the same gap between words and deeds that faced his predecessors and the
constraints that impinge on any president at home and abroad. I fear the
unpredictability of a Trump presidency. (I can barely utter those words
in close proximity.) Still if I had to wager, I'd bet that in Trump's
case---as for most bullies, and this one highly inexperienced in foreign
policy---risk aversion rather than risk readiness will prevail in
response to an ISIS style Paris or Brussels attack in the United States.
I know it's going to come as a shocker, but I'm betting the Trumpian
response would be a lot closer to what Barack Obama might do than Bush
43. We've seen that movie before Iraq; Patriot Act; waterboarding,
torture; tens of thousands of ground forces deployed; trillions
expended. Outside of the torture he's endorsed, Trump has opposed
wasting money in the Middle East nation-building; sending large numbers
of U.S. troops, etc. I'd expect more air and missile strikes, maybe more
special operators to Iraq and Syria in a stepped up campaign to deprive
ISIS of territory. Where I do worry greatly is what Trump might do on
the domestic side in the wake of such an attack---his rhetoric on Arab
and Muslim Americans, and policies on surveillance and immigration.
Remember Denzell Washington in "The Siege" where the U.S. military takes
over New York City and rounds up thousands of Arab and Muslims
Americans? There's a Constitution and institutions in this country that
will prevent him from going as far as that, but Trump has so far proved
to be a divider not a uniter or a reassurer. In the wake of a
significant terror attack by, say, ISIS, we need a president who's tough
and wise and who can bring us together not drive us apart; and not play
into or fuel the inevitable anger and fear that's going to be directed
at Muslims. Lee Atwater said it best. There's this small boat which
includes a small group of individuals who have the character and stature
to be president. That applies doubly during a crisis. And Trump's not in
it. \*\*\* "Trump, a thin-skinned malignant narcissist who can leave no
slight unavenged ... is the candidate most likely to overreact to a
terrorist event" John Gartner is a private-practice psychologist,
part-time assistant professor of psychiatry at Johns Hopkins University
Medical School and author of In Search of Bill Clinton: A Psychological
Biography. Trump, a thin-skinned malignant narcissist who can leave no
slight unavenged, no matter how slight (God help us if Kim Jong-un makes
fun of his hands), is the candidate most likely to overreact to a
terrorist event or threat in an impulsive, misguided and heavy-handed
way that would win us enemies and influence people around the world to
hate us. For example, his proposal to "register" all Muslims in America
will humiliate a proud people and radicalize scores of young people.
Malignant narcissists are not your garden-variety narcissists. They
combine narcissism with paranoia, anti-social traits and a propensity
for aggression. Trump sees threats where they don't exist---like Mexican
immigrants who "might be ISIS"---and feels no compunctions about
breaking rules, such as those against torture or collective punishment,
to lash out at those imaginary threats. The Geneva Convention is for
politically correct suckers. The law of the jungle, not the rule of law,
is the organizing principle of malignant narcissists. And **[if they
can't rule the jungle they'll burn it down]{.underline}**. Malignant
narcissism is an untreatable personality disorder, for the simple reason
that no one can ever tell the malignant narcissist he is wrong. Anyone
who questions a malignant narcissist's judgment is immediately dismissed
as an idiot or attacked as a threat. Anyone who questions their ruthless
tactics is belittled as soft and naive. It's not accidental that Trump
has said "my primary consultant is myself." The appeal of narcissistic
leaders is real and understandable. In America we've had a history of
charismatic hypomanic narcissists, warm narcissists if you will, like TR
and FDR, who were positive forces of nature, leading the country out of
hard times by using their larger than life personalities to inspire a
faith in America that made us feel larger against our enemies, while
single handedly pushing the nation in a more progressive direction that
broadened democracy to include the needs and voices of the many. But
even malignant narcissists, who concentrate all the power in themselves,
can lend strength, inspire confidence and chart a collective direction
for their country. [Hitler took a dispirited defeated nation in the
throws of depression]{.underline} and with the promise [to make Germany
great again]{.underline} turned it into a world power. But the downsides
are unimaginable: Hitler also [replaced democracy with dictatorship,
tolerance with genocide, and sowed the seeds of his nations
destruction]{.underline} with his ruthless will to conquer. In short, a
president [Trump]{.underline} is one of the biggest threats imaginable
to our national security. His need to appear strong will make us weak. A
malignant narcissist is much like a malignant tumor. Sooner or later it
[will kill the body politic]{.underline}. \*\*\* "The nihilistic Trump,
who regards human beings as brutish children, might well react to a
terror attack like a brutish child" Michael D'Antonio is author of more
than a dozen nonfiction books, including Mortal Sins and Never Enough,
Donald Trump and the Pursuit of Success. Within moments of our first
meeting, Donald Trump told me that if he is guided by any principle it
is this: "**[If you hit me, I'll hit back, ten times
harder]{.underline}**." (I came to think of this as the Trump Rule of
Ten.) In subsequent meetings he added to what might be called a personal
philosophy with references to how much he enjoyed conflict---"**[I
always loved to fight]{.underline}**"---and his belief that people are
"inherently dishonest." Add Trump's frequent references to the
viciousness that dwells in the human heart and his belief that character
is fixed at roughly age six, and you can imagine of way Trump could
respond to a terror attack on America. The nihilistic Trump, who regards
human beings as brutish children, might well react to a terror attack
like a brutish child. President [Trump would pressure intelligence
agencies to immediately identify the source]{.underline} of the attack.
[Civil liberties may be suspended]{.underline} in the emergency pursuit
of information, suspects and conspirators. Those taken into custody
would be tortured, if Trump deemed it necessary. **[Speed would
be]{.underline}** an **[important]{.underline}** part of the Trump
response to terror, so [we should not expect]{.underline} much
[deliberation]{.underline} or consultation [with Congress or
allies]{.underline}. And given his penchant for disproportional warfare,
**[he would order a massive military response]{.underline}** just as
soon as he felt confident about a target. In such a scenario, **[the
destruction of an office tower in New York would be answered with the
annihilation of a city]{.underline}** controlled by those Trump deemed
to have sponsored the attack. To get a sense of how this might work,
**[imagine the Bush]{.underline}** administration's **[tragedy in Iraq
carried out in]{.underline}** a matter of **[weeks, not
years]{.underline}**. If **[the targets of such a crude and violent
response]{.underline}** follow the established script, they
**[would]{.underline}** then **[attack the West on a scale that would
make Brussels, and Paris, and San Bernardino seem like
rehearsals]{.underline}**. As the fight escalates, according to the
Trump Rule of Ten, Americans would truly experience the terror the
attackers intend. If the actions of the President Trump that I describe
above seem too awful to consider, hope resides in the idea that much of
what the man says and does is, to echo a term he recently used on CNN,
"show business." If this is true, then we might discount the bellicose
rhetoric and the marginal figures he has named as advisers. However,
this wish, that Trump doesn't mean what he says, is a poor foundation on
which to place our confidence in the future. We shouldn't have to guess
about our president's temper. \*\*\* "As a self-professed America
Firster, Trump seemingly thinks of statecraft in terms of
profit-and-loss. Yet with apologies to Clausewitz, international
politics is not the continuation of business by other means" Andrew
Bacevich is author of the new book America's War for the Greater Middle
East: A Military History, to be published on April 5. Unmoored to
principles and precedents, possessing a remarkably shallow grasp of
history, Donald Trump is unlikely to demonstrate much by way of the cool
calculation that successful crisis management requires. True, the actual
exercise of power can educate, as it did in the case of John F. Kennedy,
for example. By the time of the Cuban Missile Crisis, JFK's "pay any
price, bear any burden" inclinations had given way to let's make a deal:
my nukes in exchange for yours and let's not do this again. Whether
Trump is similarly educable stands as an open question. Confronted with
some unexpected threat, would he pause to evaluate the precipitating
factors? Kennedy did, and it served him well. Or would he give in to an
impulse to lash out? That describes the George W. Bush administration's
response to 9/11. To put it another way, would intellect or emotion
shape Trump's approach to making decisions? More than anything else, of
course, Trump prides himself in being the dealmaker par excellence. Yet
based on his recent pronouncements---casually proposing to revive the
practice of torture, for example, or speculating that Japan and South
Korea might consider acquiring nuclear weapons---he appears all but
incapable of appreciating the possibility of adverse second order
consequences. True, for anyone running for president, a certain amount
of shooting from the hip is to be expected. Trump is hardly the only
candidate making bold statements---carpet bomb ISIS, move the U.S.
embassy in Israel to Jerusalem on day one. But in most cases such
promises are offered less as a serious basis for action than as a way of
currying favor with particular constituencies. In Trump's case,
unfortunately, it's hard to tell if he's striking a pose or making
statements that he intends to be taken seriously. (To be fair, it's just
as hard to interpret various off-the-wall statements made by Trump's
immediate rival Ted Cruz). As a self-professed America Firster, Trump
seemingly thinks of statecraft in terms of profit-and-loss. Yet with
apologies to Clausewitz, international politics is not the continuation
of business by other means. The object of the exercise is not simply to
gain some immediate advantage at the expense of others, but to enhance
the freedom, abundance, and security enjoyed by the American people
while at the same time promoting conditions that others---allies and
adversaries alike---find tolerable. Surrounding himself with advisers
who are somewhat more---what's the word? seasoned? sane?---might
encourage Trump to curb his wilder inclinations. But who in their right
mind would sign up to serve in his administration? Probably people who
think like Trump. Now there's a scary prospect. \*\*\* "**[A 9/11-style
attack on U.S. soil would mean]{.underline}** that **[any remaining
restraints to the use]{.underline}** of **[weapons of mass
destruction]{.underline}** ... **[would likely be swiftly swept
aside]{.underline}**" Elizabeth Borgwardt is a history professor at
Washington University and the author of The Nuremberg Idea, forthcoming
from Knopf. Donald Trump's March 21 interview with the Washington Post
editorial board should make every potential voter's blood run cold.
After noting that ISIS should be knocked out flat, yet indicating that
large numbers of U.S. troops should not be involved, Mr.
[Trump]{.underline} [suggested]{.underline} that [it was better to be
"unpredictable" in the face of U.S. enemies]{.underline}, before twice
dodging a question about whether he would advocate the use of tactical
nuclear weapons against ISIS. (To be fair, the interview transcript
indicates that much more time was spent discussing Mr. Trump's hand size
than anything to do with nuclear weapons.) All this was before the
attacks in Belgium; my sense is that a 9/11-style attack on U.S. soil
would mean that any remaining restraints to the use of weapons of mass
destruction---**[including nuclear weapons]{.underline}**---would likely
be swiftly swept aside. General Douglas MacArthur had notoriously
floated the idea of using nuclear weapons against China in the Korean
conflict (1950-53) when he was concerned about Chinese moves to support
North Korean aggression. In posthumously published interviews, MacArthur
said that he could have won the war in ten days: "I would have dropped
30 or so atomic bombs ... strung across the neck of Manchuria. For at
least 60 years there could have been no land invasion of Korea from the
North." Part of MacArthur's logic was that the United States would have
needed to fight communist China eventually, so it would be best to nuke
them while they were still weak, recovering from World War II and the
Chinese Revolution (1949), as opposed to fighting them later after they
had become much stronger. "That makes sense to me!" opined a Trump
backer with whom I recently spoke on this topic. And yet, I offered,
most Americans today are probably pretty happy that we didn't use
nuclear weapons against China in the Korean war, or would be if they
knew anything about that historical interlude. "I guess," he said. "But
[why not press your advantage when you have one?]{.underline}" I offer
this example because my sense is that **[in a putative Trump
administration, "the gloves would be off" and all
barriers]{.underline}**---including public
opinion---**[to]{.underline}** the **[first use]{.underline}** of
various kinds of weapons of mass destruction **[would]{.underline}**
likely **[be at an all-time low]{.underline}**. Bruce Cumings, the
leading U.S. historian of Korea, has commented on the MacArthur incident
in an analysis from back in 2004. Cumings noted that "MacArthur sounds
like a warmongering lunatic" for advocating the use of nuclear weapons,
but also explained that, astonishing as it might seem, the general
actually had some support for his outlandish proposal. Cumings also
noted that MacArthur's conduct, quite appropriately, contributed to the
celebrated war hero's dismissal by President Truman. But that was then.
\*\*\* "[Trump's foreign policy inexperience]{.underline} and the proven
tendency of one thing to lead to another in military [interventions
could easily mean a protracted U.S. involvement in a **ground war in
Syria**]{.underline}" Paul Pillar is nonresident senior fellow at the
Brookings Institution and at the Center for Security Studies at
Georgetown University. From 2000 to 2005, as the national intelligence
officer for the Near East and South Asia, he was in charge of the
analysis of those regions for the CIA and all other American
intelligence agencies. In a Trump presidency, the potentially moderating
influence of the national security establishment will be far less
powerful than Trump's own ideas and the political demands of a scared,
fired-up public in the aftermath of a terrorist attack like 9/11. If we
know one thing about Trump, it's his talent for providing an outlet for
cruder, simpler and more emotional demands of the general public---and
we will likely see that talent in his counterterrorism policies in the
days following an attack on the scale of 9/11. Trump's statements about
the use of torture have been specific enough that after an attack he
would feel almost obliged to re-institute it in the military and
intelligence agencies if he had not done so already. There would be
significant resistance to doing so, of course, and given how the issue
has been viewed and discussed in the past couple of years it may seem
unlikely that Trump would succeed in making this change. But current
public and congressional views of the issue are much different from the
views that prevailed in the immediate aftermath of 9/11. In the
aftermath of another 9/11-type attack, public moods and thus tolerance
of torture are likely to revert to what they were back then. Assuming
any connection at all could be made between the attack and a foreign
location---such as the ISIL-controlled enclave in Syria---a Trump
administration would launch a major military assault on the ostensibly
relevant foreign targets. Although some of Trump's statements during the
campaign suggest an aversion to large ground wars and to anything that
smacks of nation-building, the subsequent political and operational
momentum may overtake the aversion. Trump's foreign policy inexperience
and the proven tendency of one thing to lead to another in military
interventions could easily mean a protracted U.S. involvement in a
ground war in Syria. President Trump's relations with allies and other
foreign states in the aftermath of an attack would resemble the "for us
or for the terrorists" attitude of the George W. Bush administration but
with the addition of a generous dose of Trumpian bombast. There would be
much wincing in foreign capitals as governments tried to strike a
balance between supporting an America that had just been attacked and
not appearing to be bullied by the man in the White House. The rest of
what would be a distinctively Trump response to an attack would be felt
domestically. This would be the occasion for a President Trump to do
whatever he had not already done in restricting immigration. Beyond
that, candidate Trump has given us little specific to go on, but it is
likely that the status of Muslims in America and their relations with
fellow citizens would become as delicate and fraught as they ever have
been. Islamophobia will likely surge and relationships between Muslim
communities and police will likely worsen. A President Trump would be
more likely to exacerbate than to smooth the fears and suspicions
involved. \*\*\* "As president, Mr. Trump would indeed project strength
... But he would be incapable of ... thoughtful self-restraint" Joe
Burgo is the author of several books, including The Narcissist You Know:
Defending Yourself Against Extreme Narcissists in an All-About-Me Age.
If he were president, Mr. Trump would respond to a 9/11-type terrorist
attack much as he has responded to personal attacks throughout the
campaign. He would be preoccupied with his self-image and the need to
come across as a "winner" and not a "loser" upon the world stage. On
some level, he would experience the attack as an assault on his own
stature, a blow to his grandiose self-image, and would likely respond
with reflexive violence, as he usually does when attacked. In this case,
rather than verbal assaults, it might involve massive "carpet bombings"
without adequate intelligence, and an immediate declaration of war. In
times of crisis, frightened citizens need their president to project an
image of strength and confidence; at the same time, they need him to
remain thoughtful and not respond in a reactionary, thoughtless way that
might make matters worse. As president, Mr. Trump would indeed project
strength by presenting himself as a take-charge strongman who knows how
to deal with terrorists. But he would be incapable of the kind of
thoughtful self-restraint we need from our president in a time of
crisis: For Trump, an attack requires an immediate and overwhelming
assault on the perceived source of the attack. When Megyn Kelly
criticized him, he responded with outsized contempt, indignation and
blame, the "weapons" he consistently uses to annihilate his enemies.
It's frightening to imagine what he would do to annihilate the source of
a terrorist attack were he to have a nuclear arsenal at his disposal.
\*\*\* "Trump has given no suggestion that he would be more prudent
\[than Bush\]. Nor, for that matter, has Ted Cruz" Stephen Kinzer is a
visiting fellow at the Watson Institute for International Studies at
Brown University. His books include All the Shah\'s Men: An American
Coup and the Roots of Middle East Terror and Reset: Iran, Turkey, and
America\'s Future. Even imagining the craziness that might seize
President Trump in the wake of a terror attack is frightening. Most
likely, his response would be at least as irrational as what George W.
Bush did after 9/11. Bush took radical steps that ultimately harmed the
United States far more profoundly than the attack itself. Trump has
given no suggestion that he would be more prudent. Nor, for that matter,
has Ted Cruz. More interesting is the effect that Trump's rhetoric might
have in attracting an attack. Wise terror strategists---and there
evidently are some---realize that over-reaction to an attack on the
United States would be in their interest. A crackdown that restricted
the civil liberties of American Muslims would allow militants to paint
the United States as a relentless enemy of Islam. So would an American
military assault in the Middle East, especially if it were carried out
with ground troops. These would be godsends to terrorist recruiters. If
the next American president projects an air of measured calm, and does
not seem ready to lash out wildly if provoked by a terror attack, such
an attack will be less likely. But if President Trump were in **[power,
setting off a bomb on the Washington Mall]{.underline}** would be a
great temptation. Terror groups in the Middle East, especially ISIS, are
eager **[to]{.underline}** **[bait the United States into another
self-defeating disaster like]{.underline}** the **[Iraq]{.underline}**
War. Trump seems ready to be baited---so why not try? \*\*\* "If history
is any lesson, Trump would alienate American allies ... undermining U.S.
efforts to work together with other countries to combat transnational
terrorism" Mary Dudziak is professor of law at Emory University and
chair in American law and governance at the Library of Congress. In
light of Donald Trump's tendency to react to problems by blaming
minority groups, including Muslims, and promoting torture, we might
expect more of the same, perhaps at a greater volume, than we've seen so
far. That would serve Trump and the nation poorly. The way the United
States treats minority groups has had an impact on U.S. foreign
relations in the past, and would be a problem in a Trump presidency.
President Dwight D. Eisenhower was just one president who had to
confront the impact of prejudice against African Americans, and civil
rights-related unrest, on America's image around the world. When white
mobs protested the integration of nine African American students at
Little Rock, Arkansas' Central High School in 1957, it became a major
international story. American discrimination was condemned around the
world. It was also used against American interests, as the Soviet Union
featured U.S. racism as a principal theme in its anti-U.S. propaganda.
Eisenhower had not supported judicial action to integrate schools; but
prodded by his secretary of state and others, he sent federal troops to
Little Rock. One of the reasons for his turnabout was his hope to
restore the global image of American democracy, and keep American racism
from harming the nation's Cold War mission. The Trump campaign has
already generated international criticism for its hostility to Muslims
and Mexican immigrants. His inflammatory calls for the use of torture
would damage U.S. credibility on human rights. If history is any lesson,
**[Trump would alienate American allies]{.underline}** with these
policies, [undermining U.S. efforts to work together]{.underline} with
other countries [to combat transnational terrorism]{.underline}. \*\*\*
"There would be no telegraphing of policy decisions to allow those
responsible to adjust. And there would be public justifications about
'limits' and 'proportionality'" Stanley Renshon is a political science
professor at the City University of New York, is a certified
psychoanalyst and the author of 15 books, most recently National
Security in the Obama Administration: Reassessing the Bush Doctrine.
Trump would be angry, much as George W. Bush was after the 9 /11
attacks, but much less methodical. He would order all available
assistance to the victims, take to the airwaves to assure the American
people that the attack would not go un-avenged and then proceed to do
something dramatic, public and lethal. There would be with Mr. Trump no
publically drawn red lines that he takes pride later in not crossing.
There would be no telegraphing of policy decisions to allow those
responsible to adjust. And there would be public justifications about
"limits" and "proportionality." **[At minimum]{.underline}**, the
response would involve **[dramatic airstrikes against previously
off-limit targets]{.underline}**---[oil rigs, training grounds
and]{.underline} even targets within [urban]{.underline} areas, if
necessary---and ramped-up commando raids against those enemies and their
supporters, primarily **[in Syria, but world-wide as
well]{.underline}**. If the attacks were committed by immigrants or
Americans, I wouldn't rule out his [asking Congress for much tighter
controls on immigration and even the loss of legal status and
citizenship]{.underline} for any supporters found to be involved. The
intended message would be stark: attack us and you and those who support
you will pay an unbearable price. This rough response would very likely
provide some comfort to Americans, as George W. Bush's strikes against
the Afghan government and his subsequent strategy of preemptive attacks
against imminent threats did after 9/11. It would also signal to
America's allies and opponents that Mr. Trump's view that the United
States should fight back against being taken advantage of were not mere
words, but reflected a real emotional conviction. Though kumbaya
internationalists might think differently, this might have a sobering
and therefore salutary effect on both free-riding allies and
ever-watchful enemies. That said, an important question that will follow
is this: after his display of resolve and revenge, what better policies
will he put into to place, domestically and with our allies abroad, to
lessen the risks of further attacks going forward? That, not his first
and understandable impulse, will be a true measure of his presidency and
his maturity as a leader and a president. \*\*\* "Trump appears to
employ **[a much more externalizing style]{.underline}**. ... When he is
threatened his primary response seems to be to fight back" W. Keith
Campbell is the head of the Department of Psychology at the University
of Georgia In the case of threat, people have two general patterns of
responding---externalizing and internalizing. Externalizing involves
[responding boldly and aggressively to the source of the
threat]{.underline}; internalizing involves responding by turning
inward, including feeling depressed or blaming oneself for the threat.
Trump appears to employ a much more externalizing style. (A caveat: My
answer is highly speculative and based on general psychological models
and my observations of Donald Trump on the campaign trail alone.) When
he is threatened his primary response seems to be to fight back. He does
this even in the case of threats that seem purely adolescent---when the
size of his fingers were challenged, for example. If, in fact, his
aggressive style applies to threats to himself, the next question is
whether that style would apply to threats beyond him. We saw a recent
incident where supporters of an opposing campaign used Trump's wife in a
hostile campaign message. Trump's response on Twitter was to make what
appeared to be a veiled threat against the opposing candidate's wife.
So, in this case he acted aggressively against a threat to his wife. It
is plausible, then, that he would act in the same way if America were
attacked or threatened and he were president. His reaction would be to
attack the source of the threat. We saw that with his Brussels response,
when he immediately called for tougher border control and anti-terror
measures. Both internalizing and externalizing have a place in good
leadership. Internalizing can be seen as thoughtful but also feckless.
Externalizing can be seen as strong but also impulsive. Outside forces
know that if they provoke an externalizing leader they are likely in for
a fight. Ideally, this will lead to less provocation (this is part of
the "peace through strength" model). But while this approach works well
when dealing with other nations, [it is less certain when dealing with
nationless terrorists who might actually be looking to provoke an
aggressive military response]{.underline}.

The Mirage of Influence

A general difficulty with [primacy realism]{.underline} is its
incuriosity. Too readily, it [presumes]{.underline} that [U.S.
commitments generate influence]{.underline}, at least significant enough
influence to make the investment worth it. In [the argument]{.underline}
that "the [U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates' overseas [presence
gives it]{.underline} the [leverage to restrain partners]{.underline}
from taking provocative action", [there is an embarrassing,
Middle-Eastern sized hole]{.underline}.53 To show commitment is not to
demonstrate influence. This is a problem that afflicts International
Relations more broadly. [The U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates
[exerts far less influence on its allies in the region than proponents
assume]{.underline}. [Time and again, despite the posture that is
supposed to generate attraction and coercive leverage, and despite
actively exerting pressure, the superpower has not gotten its
way]{.underline}. Short of all-out brute force to topple regimes,
hegemony with its many parts of close diplomatic relations, **[arms
sales]{.underline}**, and security commitments **[does not translate
into enough diplomatic weight to prevent "provocative" behaviour,
or]{.underline}** worse, **[behaviour that actively injures U.S.
interests]{.underline}**. [External powers have at best played only a
secondary role, while Middle Eastern regimes have stubbornly asserted
themselves]{.underline}. If anything, [the overall pattern of regional
states has been to resist or limit the demands and impositions of
external actors]{.underline}. 54

A long series of failed summits testify to the limits of American power,
from Madrid to Oslo, from Annapolis to Warsaw recently. External powers
could not prevent the fall of the prowestern Iraqi Hashemite dynasty in
1958. U.S. hegemony was neither strong nor prescient enough to forestall
the fall of one of its major allies, the Shah of Iran in 1979. It could
not prevent Israel's anticipatory war in June 1967. Neither could
Washington prevent Israel acquiring nuclear weapons, despite the
ultimatum from President John F. Kennedy and the follow-up demands of
Lyndon Johnson and Richard Nixon. 55 President Ronald Reagan's angry
demands for Israel to cease its assault on Beirut in the summer of 1982
came to naught. A series of Israeli Prime Ministers have ignored U.S.
calls for settlement freezes or anti-terror operations in Gaza or the
West Bank. Decades of being the armourer and backer of the Saudi regime
have not led it to cease its support for Wahhabist and jihadist
preaching, nor its indoctrination of children in violent antisemitism.
[The U.S. demanded in April 2018]{.underline} that the
[Saudi]{.underline}-led quartet [end its blockade of Qatar]{.underline}
(which it blockaded despite Qatar being a fellow U.S. ally with a major
air base, the largest US facility in the Middle East), [and it has yet
to do so]{.underline}, while it also actively campaigned against the
JCPOA agreement with Iran. During [the Arab Spring]{.underline}
uprisings, [Washington's appeals failed to stop Saudi]{.underline} and
Emirati [forces violently suppressing protest by the Shia majority
population in Bahrain.]{.underline} Consider also the recent revelation
that [Saudi Arabia]{.underline} and the UAE [transferred U.S. military
equipment,]{.underline} including armored vehicles, [to Al
Qaeda-linked]{.underline} (hardline Salafi) [militias]{.underline} to
buy their loyalty in the Yemen war56, [in violation of agreements with
Washington]{.underline}.57

Even in Baghdad during the "surge" of 2006-8, with 150,000 troops
stationed in Iraq, Washington only had limited influence. The newcomers
were consistently outflanked by Iran, which had the advantages of being
permanently next door and preferences closely aligned with central
forces in Iraqi politics. General David Petraeus and Ryan Crocker could
not curb the sectarian abuse that then led to the rise of the Islamic
State. The Iraqi army that the U.S. funded and trained then collapsed in
the face of ISIL's offensive. Today, observers warn that a planned
drawdown from Syria may lead to Turkey attacking Kurdish forces,
possibly even committing genocide. That possibility restages the
problem. Turkey is both a NATO ally and the host of US bases, two
factors that are supposed to be inhibiting.

To be sure, limited influence is not the same as zero. The question is
how much influence, on who, relative to the costs. Wohlforth and Brooks
select cases where the U.S. did successfully exert a stabilising
influence, namely efforts to terminate conflicts involving Israel and
the US Israel/Egypt Camp David accords and settlement in 1978. We should
note, too, that this was before the U.S. had forward operating bases in
the region, therefore cannot be evidence of the influencing power of
garrisons. These are also "easy" tests of their argument, where U.S.
preferences coincided with the prior preferences of the actors involved,
who independently wanted the settlement anyway, as opposed to cases
where the U.S. persuaded actors to behave in ways that they otherwise
might not. So these are a case of modest influence from a distance, not
major, game-changing influence from a foothold ashore.

[A problem for U.S. diplomacy in the Middle East is "perilous
partners",]{.underline}58 [and the lack of political actors whose
interests consistently align with the superpower,]{.underline} actors
who are also domestically powerful enough to seize command. With the
lack of that "vital center", [too often the choice of partners
is]{.underline} a dismal one, [between unreliable client regimes and
chaos]{.underline}, between [Islamist movements]{.underline} who have
grown [increasingly hostile to American paramountcy, and authoritarian
regimes whose bad governance creates fundamental economic and political
failures in the first place]{.underline}. These rulers both incite and
repress Islamist movements. At the same time, they present themselves as
the only conceivable bulwarks against greater chaos. This difficulty
arose during the Syrian civil war, when the U.S. attempted to shape the
opposition with targeted funding and weapons, with 1/15th of the CIA's
annual budget, yet due to the fragmented quality of the opposition and
its Gulf partners aiding Islamist militias, was unable to strengthen the
moderate rebels sufficiently, while inadvertently empowering Islamist
groups. This points to a wider issue, the general assumption that
military presence backed with guarantees stabilises the region, or
reduces political instability. To take one regular measure assumed to be
benign: military training. According to a recent study, of military
training programs from 1970 to 2009, countries receiving such training
were twice as likely to experience a military-backed coup attempt as
countries with no comparable training.59 Well-intentioned efforts at
improving allies' capacity to govern does not reliably realign their
interests with the United States.

Not only does the U.S. struggle to obtain enough leverage. [There is
also an unfortunate pattern]{.underline}, that resurfaced particularly
during the Arab Spring revolutions and counter-revolutions, whereby the
U.S. failed to exercise much restraining influence because it dared not
try. This is the case across countries [from Turkey and Saudi Arabia to
Pakistan and Egypt, where the anxiety to retain basing access and a
cooperative host **hinders** Washington's willingness to **criticise**
or **coerce** governments]{.underline}.60 In the Bahrain case, the U.S.
refrained from stronger action over violent crackdowns against protest
for fear of straining relations with Saudi Arabia.61 Recent revelations
from U.S. officials and a UN investigation62 reveal that [Saudi
Arabia]{.underline} and the United Arab Emirates [have ignored American
efforts to refine its bombing campaign in]{.underline} northern
[Yemen]{.underline} against Houthi rebels [and minimise harm to
civilians]{.underline} -- whitewashing investigations of errant air
strikes, ignoring a no-strike list -- **[despite high dependency on
American]{.underline}** support, from **[weapons sales]{.underline}** to
technical maintenance of aircraft and its software, air-to-air
refuelling, tactical and intelligence advice, and training of pilots.
[The Kingdom's cavalier disregard for U.S. counsel flies in the face of
a longstanding assumption, that American security provision contains the
behaviour of allies]{.underline}. [Striking at targets **they were told
not to strike**]{.underline}, "...we concluded that **[they were just
not willing to listen]{.underline}**" according to the former assistant
secretary of State Tom Malinowski. Fearful of Saudi opposition to the
Iran nuclear settlement, Obama muted criticism from the White House,
while **[Trump's drive for increased arms sales overshadowed concern for
Yemeni civilian casualties]{.underline}**. Likewise in Egypt, Washington
initially tried to constrain military strongman General el-Sisi whose
coup it assisted, by initially withholding arms deliveries. But it then
yielded to Egyptian complaints. The \$1.5 billion annual budget is
supposed to generate leverage, but the belief endures that Cairo is too
important to coerce strongly.63

[The tail wags the dog]{.underline}, in other words, [because the
alliance works not as a basis for leverage but as a precious asset that
the patron fears losing]{.underline}. America has alliances for the most
basic purpose of augmenting its power, its reach and the totality of its
presence. From this perspective, it is in Washington's interests to have
militarily proficient friends. But its alliances have other rationales
that cut against that simple desire. Another central historical purpose
of American alliances in the post-war period is to contain its allies.
By providing security, Washington in theory removes incentives for its
allies to rearm and reassert themselves as challengers. This imperative,
to restrain allies' defence expenditure, requires in turn that
Washington must establish a reputation for being a reliable security
provider. Failure to maintain that baseline of confidence could lead the
client to pursue belligerent self-help, or even other allies. Yet
[establishing a reputation for reliable security provision creates a
**moral hazard**]{.underline}. [Allies' confidence in American
backing]{.underline} can **[embolden them]{.underline}** [to behave
recklessly]{.underline} in ways that Washington dislikes. Conversely,
[the dependency Washington forms on the alliance]{.underline}, as an
indispensable platform for its power projection, [creates **reverse
leverage**, making Washington reluctant to attempt to impose itself with
threats of abandonment or even public criticism]{.underline}.64 Rather
than achieving influence through complicity, the U.S. receives
complicity without influence.

Primacy realists don't deny the misbehaviour of client states. They
attribute it, however, almost exclusively to the absence of, or
insufficiency of, U.S. hegemony, and the rumour of U.S. withdrawal. If
only the U.S. would fortify rather than revise its commitments, they
assume, there is enough leverage to be had, that is worth the cost of
preserving. Yet they also -- relentlessly -- encourage the baseless
suggestion that America is about to leave. Consider Hal Brands' argument
for staying, in October 2018, even though as he admits that Saudi
behaviour "is reckless in the extreme":

> Much of Saudi Arabia's recent behavior has been linked to the rise of
> MBS, who seems driven by a combination of ambition, arrogance and
> recklessness. Yet it is not a coincidence that Saudi misdeeds have
> accumulated at a time when the U.S. is widely seen to be drawing down
> in the Middle East.65

In no way, though, is the U.S. drawing down from the region, as we have
seen. So it cannot be the case that a withdrawal is causing Saudi
Arabia's recklessness. In fact, [U.S. hegemonic commitment
has]{.underline}, if anything, **[emboldened]{.underline}** them
\[**[Saudi Arabia]{.underline}**\], and Yemen, and [the years of support
for the]{.underline} Emiratis and [Saudis in that humanitarian disaster
is the most graphic demonstration]{.underline}. More broadly, [we are
witnessing what even increased U.S. hegemonic ties are **failing to
prevent**]{.underline}, namely the **[increasing geopolitical
competition]{.underline}** today [that US allies and adversaries are
conducting, which Washington has a difficult time
inhibiting.]{.underline} [This renewed competition is]{.underline}
partly [owed to the]{.underline} long-term [effects of allied behaviour
-- **deliberately stoking sectarian tensions**]{.underline} -- and the
fallout from the invasion of Iraq. And as a vacuum opened up in Syria,
there wasn't much the U.S. could safely do to prevent a realist Russian
intervention to prevent the fall of Damascus.

There's a second problem that Brands' rationale raises. [If Saudi Arabia
does in fact fear a U.S. withdrawal, despite the U.S.
pouring]{.underline} resources [in]{.underline}to the region
increasingly that Riyadh desires ([record arms sales]{.underline},
bombings, an increased on-the-ground presence and an openly hostile
campaign against Iran), then [this is]{.underline} demonstrably [one
more reason]{.underline} why it [is now too difficult to stabilise the
region at acceptable cost]{.underline}. To be forever suspected of
imminent abandonment, even while ramping up commitment, with the result
that client states persistently violate U.S. interests at will, means
that the bargain is ever more dysfunctional.

[There is an **alternative**]{.underline}, more ruthless
**[option]{.underline}** here: [to harness unreliability not as a
liability but as **a tool of U.S. statecraft**]{.underline}. [Not only
would]{.underline} **[abandonment]{.underline}** of the GCC [free up
precious **resources** and **time**]{.underline}. [It would send a
**salutary example**]{.underline} [to **other third parties** that
American reliability is not,]{.underline} in fact, [infinite,
and]{.underline} that [its partnership is **conditional** on **prudent
behaviour**]{.underline}. This flies in the face of primacy arguments,
however, which fetishize alliances almost as sacred objects, and now
largely take for granted the need to signal resolve and reassure allies
that Washington has their back.

It could be objected that the failure to translate hegemony into enough
influence is attributable to incompetence, the inefficient exercise of
coercive leverage. Certainly, if the U.S. is to persistently attempt to
dominate the Middle East, it would be advised at least to exert greater
alliance discipline, if it can.66 [It is hard to accept]{.underline},
though[, that forty years of disappointment is reducible to poor
execution]{.underline}. The superpower has attempted a wide range of
postures and approaches. With expert advisors, policymakers have lent
the area their sustained attention, time and resources. The consistently
disappointing results suggest that the level of strategic skill required
to exercise "enough" influence in this unruly region must be stupendous.
The complexity of the region is such that even a standing committee of
Machiavelli, Metternich and Kissinger would struggle to successfully
order the region at acceptable cost.

#### Arms suspension will [compel]{.underline} Saudi moderation and reverse reckless behavior 

**Larison 19** \-\-- PhD in history from U Chicago (Daniel, "End the
Noxious U.S.-Saudi Relationship Now," 3-12,

Shihabi is right that the U.S. cannot separate the Saudi government from
the crown prince, but he draws all the wrong conclusions from this.
Mohammed bin Salman \[[MBS\] is the de facto ruler in the kingdom and
heir to the throne, and it is obviously not within our government's
power and]{.underline} it is none of our [business to
change]{.underline} any of [that. It doesn't follow that the U.S. has to
maintain the same relationship with Saudi Arabia while]{.underline}
Mohammed bin Salman \[[MBS\] is in power]{.underline}. [The idea that
the U.S. would be harming its "vital interests" if it held the crown
prince to account for his crimes assumes that continuing to indulge the
reckless crown prince has something to do with securing those interests.
That's not true]{.underline}. **[Saudi Arabia isn't our
ally]{.underline}**, [and Saudi Arabia under]{.underline} Mohammed bin
Salman \[[MBS\] is a **regional menace** and a **liability**. The sooner
that the U.S. **cuts off** its reckless client, the better it will be
for U.S. interests.]{.underline} Shihabi grants that the crown prince is
inexperienced, but [the bigger problem is that Mohammed bin Salman **has
not learned anything** from his many failures and crimes]{.underline}.
[The crown prince]{.underline} seems to [**take for granted** that he
will always have U.S. backing no matter how many people his government
starves and bombs in Yemen]{.underline} and no matter how many
dissidents and critics he has tortured and killed. [The Trump
administration has given him **every reason to believe** that he can do
**whatever he likes** without jeopardizing ties with Washington, and
that guarantees that there will be **more of the same reckless and
destructive behavior**]{.underline} [that we have seen over **the last
four years**. Shihabi's prediction that "Saudi Arabia should have a more
measured and thoughtful foreign policy in the future" is based on
nothing more than **wishful thinking.**]{.underline} If it is true that
"his future and the future of Saudi Arabia are indissolubly
intertwined," that makes the case for disentangling the U.S. from Saudi
Arabia even stronger. Mohammed bin Salman will likely be in charge of
the kingdom for a long time to come, and [unless the U.S. wants to be
implicated in many more crimes and abuses committed by the crown prince
and the Saudi government the time to **downgrade** the relationship with
Riyadh is **right now.**]{.underline}

### U -- Unsustainable 

#### US Middle East heg is [unsustainable]{.underline} & [declining]{.underline}

east: America's role in a changing region", September 2018, PDF,

The arc of American influence started rising through President Jimmy
Carter's successful efforts to broker the Israel-Egypt Peace Treaty that
took Egypt out of the conflict with Israel and in effect ended the
state-to-state conflict between Israel and its Arab neighbors. [The Oslo
Accords and the Israel-Jordan Peace Treaty under President Bill Clinton
represented the high point of America's engagement in the peace
process]{.underline}. At the same time, as Natan alluded to, the
collapse of the Soviet Union at the end of the Cold War and the eviction
of Saddam Hussein's army from Kuwait led to a dramatic boost to
America's stature in the region. [By the 1990s, the United States was
the dominant power of the Middle East.]{.underline}

[The arc started to bend downward at the end of the Clinton
administration with the failure to achieve a breakthrough between first
Israel and Syria, and then between Israel and the Palestinians at Camp
David.]{.underline} And that was then followed by the outbreak of the
intifada, which looked like anything but peace between Israel and the
Palestinians, and by [the American-led invasion of Iraq]{.underline}.
And that [is when American influence began to decline]{.underline}
rather [precipitously]{.underline}.

The [failure of the peace process]{.underline}, the [opening of the
gates of Babylon to Iran's influence, and the Arab
revolutions]{.underline} really [combined]{.underline} in a perfect
storm [to dramatically reduce America's influence in the
region]{.underline} to the point that when Obama comes along, there's a
war weariness on the part of the American public and a deeply held
conviction by Obama that he was elected to end wars, not get involved in
new ones. Therefore the United States only got involved in the opening
of the conflict in Libya and avoided any kind of serious engagement in
Syria, opening the way for Russia to come back into the region.

What's important to understand in this process is, first of all, the
decline in American influence also coincides, not coincidentally, with a
failure to get any traction toward resolving these rather costly
conflicts. [It's been 20 years since the last Israeli-Palestinian
agreement, notwithstanding every president, including President Trump,
trying their hand at resolving this]{.underline}. And I believe [that
this is directly related to the decline in overall U.S.
influence.]{.underline}

The second point is that [along the way, the United States']{.underline}
strategic [interest in the region changed]{.underline} rather
dramatically [because of the natural gas revolution in the United
States, which made us no longer dependent on Middle Eastern
oil.]{.underline} And so one of the most important strategic interests
we had in the region, which was to ensure the free flow of oil from the
Persian Gulf area at reasonable prices, remains an interest, but is no
longer a vital strategic interest to the United States. [Combined with
the failure of our efforts in Iraq, and more broadly in Afghanistan,
this leads to a lack of will to commit American forces to the region
amid a pivot to Asia, where our strategic interests are greater. This
combination leaves the United States in the situation where it is in
effect withdrawing from the region and no longer willing or even able to
play the major role that it once did.]{.underline}

### U / IL -- Overstretch/Econ 

#### Overstretch makes US [economic growth]{.underline} *unsustainable* -- causes [dollar]{.underline} *transition* and *quick* [collapse of commitments]{.underline} 

**Layne 12** (Christopher, "This Time It\'s Real: The End of Unipolarity
and the Pax Americana," *International Studies Quarterly*, 56.1, 2012,
203-213)

[[Because of]{.mark}]{.underline} the
**[[combined]{.underline}]{.mark}** costs of federal government
**[[expenditures]{.underline}]{.mark}**---[[on]{.underline}]{.mark}
**[[stimulus]{.underline}]{.mark}**, **[[defense]{.underline}]{.mark}**,
Iraq and Afghanistan, [and **[entitlements]{.mark}**]{.underline}---in
2009 the Congressional Budget Office forecast that [[the
**U**]{.underline}]{.mark}nited [**[S]{.mark}**tates [will run
**unsustainable**]{.mark} annual [**budget deficits** of **\$1
trillion**]{.mark}]{.underline} or more until at least the end of this
decade, and observed that, "[Even if the recovery occurs as
projected]{.underline} and the stimulus bill is allowed to expire, [the
country will face the highest debt/GDP ratio in 50 years]{.underline}
and an increasingly urgent and unsustainable fiscal problem" (CBO
2009:13). In a subsequent 2010 report, the CBO noted that [if
[the]{.mark}]{.underline} United States stays on its
**[[current]{.underline}]{.mark}** fiscal [**[trajectory]{.mark}**, the
ratio of US government debt to GDP [will be]{.mark} 100% by
2020]{.underline} (CBO 2010). Economists regard a 100% debt-to-GDP ratio
as critical indicator that a state will
**[[default]{.underline}]{.mark}** on its financial obligations. In an
even less sanguine 2011 analysis, the International Monetary Fund
forecast that the United States will hit the 100% debt-to-GDP ratio in
2016 (IMF 2011). If these estimates are correct, over the next decade
[the [growing]{.mark} US national [debt]{.mark}]{.underline}---and the
budget deficits that fuel it---[[could]{.mark} **[imperil the
dollar]{.mark}**]{.underline} [by [undermining]{.mark} foreign
**[investors\' confidence]{.mark}**]{.underline} in the United States\'
ability to repay its debts and keep inflation in check. This is
important because, for the foreseeable future, [the United States will
depend on capital inflows from abroad both to finance its deficit
spending]{.underline} and private consumption and to maintain the
dollar\'s position as the international economic system\'s reserve
currency. America\'s geopolitical [[**preeminence** hinges on the
dollar]{.underline}]{.mark}\'s reserve currency role. [If the dollar
loses that status, US **[hegemony will]{.mark}** literally **[be
unaffordable]{.mark}**.]{.underline} The dollar\'s reserve currency
status has, in effect, been a very special kind of "credit card." It is
special because the United States does not have to earn the money to pay
its bills. Rather, [when the bills come due, the United States borrows
funds from abroad]{.underline} and/or prints money to pay them.
[The]{.underline} **[[U]{.underline}]{.mark}**nited
**[[S]{.underline}]{.mark}**tates [[can]{.underline}]{.mark} get away
with this and [[live beyond its means]{.underline}]{.mark}, spending
with little restraint on [[maintaining]{.underline}]{.mark} its
[[**military dominance**, preserving]{.underline}]{.mark} costly
domestic [[entitlements]{.underline}]{.mark}, and indulging in
conspicuous private consumption, as long as foreigners are willing to
lend it money (primarily by purchasing Treasury bonds).
[[Without]{.underline}]{.mark} the use of the "credit card" provided by
[[the dollar\'s reserve]{.underline}]{.mark} currency [[status, the
**U**]{.underline}]{.mark}nited **[[S]{.underline}]{.mark}**tates
[[would have to]{.mark} pay]{.underline} for its extravagant external
and internal ambitions [by [rais]{.mark}ing [**taxes** and **interest
rates**]{.mark}]{.underline}, and by consuming less and saving more;
**[[or]{.underline}]{.mark}**, tightening its belt and dramatically
**[[reducing]{.underline}]{.mark}** its
**[[military]{.underline}]{.mark}** and domestic
**[[expenditures]{.underline}]{.mark}**. In other words, the United
States would have to learn to live within its means.9 As a leading
expert on international economic affairs observed just before the Great
Recession kicked in, the dollar\'s vulnerability "presents potentially
significant and underappreciated restraints upon contemporary American
political and military predominance" (Kirshner 2008). Although [doubts
about the dollar\'s]{.underline} long-term health predated the Great
Recession, the events of 2007--2009 [have amplified them in two key
respects]{.underline} (Helleiner 2008; Kirshner 2008). First, the other
big players in the international economy now are either geopolitical
rivals like China or ambiguous "allies" like Europe, which has its own
ambitions and no longer requires US protection from the now-vanished
Soviet threat. Second, [[the **dollar** faces an **uncertain
future**]{.mark} because of concerns that its value will diminish over
time.]{.underline} Indeed, China, which has vast holdings of American
assets (more than \$2 trillion), is worried that America\'s fiscal
incontinence will leave Beijing holding the bag with huge amounts of
depreciated dollars. China\'s vote of no confidence in the dollar\'s
future is reflected in its calls to create a new reserve currency to
replace the dollar, the renminbi\'s gradual "internationalization," and
in the lectures China\'s leaders regularly deliver telling Washington to
get its fiscal house in order. **[[Alarm bells]{.underline}]{.mark}**
about the dollar\'s uncertain status now **[[are
ringing]{.underline}]{.mark}**. In April 2011, Standard & Poor\'s warned
that in the coming years there is a one-in-three chance that the United
States\' triple A credit rating could be reduced if Washington fails to
solve the fiscal crisis---and in August 2011 S& P did downgrade the US
credit rating to AA. In June 2011, [the IMF said]{.underline} that
unless [[the **U**]{.underline}]{.mark}nited
**[[S]{.underline}]{.mark}**tates enacts a credible plan to reign in its
annual deficits and accumulating national debt, it
[[could]{.underline}]{.mark} [[face a **sovereign risk
crisis**]{.underline}]{.mark} in the next several years. In a May 2011
report, the World Bank declared that [[the dollar]{.underline}]{.mark}
probably [[will lose its status]{.underline}]{.mark} as the primary
reserve currency by 2025 (World Bank 2011). In the coming years, [the
United States will have to defend the dollar by reassuring foreign
lenders]{.underline} (read: China) both [that there will be no runaway
inflation and that it can pay its debts]{.underline}. This will require
some combination of budget cuts, entitlements reductions, tax increases,
and interest-rate hikes. Because exclusive reliance on the last two
options could choke off growth, [[there will be **strong pressure** to
slash the federal budget]{.mark} in order to hold down taxes and
interest rates]{.underline}. [It will be almost impossible to make
meaningful cuts in federal spending without deep reductions in defense
expenditures]{.underline} (and entitlements), because, as Figure 6
shows, that is where the money is. [With US defense spending currently
at such high levels, domestic [political pressures to make **steep
cuts** in]{.mark} [**defense spending** are bound to
increase]{.mark}]{.underline}. As the Cornell international political
economist Jonathan Kirshner puts it, the absolute size of US defense
expenditures is "more likely to be decisive in the future when the U.S.
is under pressure to make real choices about taxes and spending. When
borrowing becomes more difficult, and adjustment more difficult to
postpone, choices must be made between raising taxes, cutting
non-defense spending, and cutting defense spending" (Kirshner 2008:431).
In the spring of 2011, the Obama administration proposed to cut US
defense spending by \$400 million over eleven years. But that is a drop
in the bucket, and cuts of a much larger magnitude almost certainly will
be needed.10 Big [[defense cuts mean]{.underline}]{.mark} that during
the next ten to fifteen years, [[the **U**]{.underline}]{.mark}nited
**[[S]{.underline}]{.mark}**tates [[will]{.underline}]{.mark} be
compelled to [[**scale back** its **overseas military
commitments**]{.underline}]{.mark}. This will have two consequences.
First, as the United States spends less on defense, China (and other new
great powers) will be able to close the military power gap with the
United States. Second, the United States\' ability to act as a regional
stabilizer and a guardian of the global commons will diminish. In this
respect, [[America\'s fiscal crisis]{.underline}]{.mark} and the
dollar\'s uncertain future [are [important drivers of American
decline]{.mark}]{.underline}.

#### Kills global [economic]{.underline} *openness* -- ensures [collapse]{.underline} of US led order

**Berg 16** (Manfred Berg, Curt Engelhorn Chair in American History at
Heidelberg University, "America, United States of: 3. 20th century to
the present," [The Encyclopedia of Empire]{.underline} (2016).

[[The **costs** of **maintaining a large military**]{.mark} [and
waging]{.mark} armed [interventions]{.mark} on a regular basis
[are]{.mark} often seen as [a key factor]{.mark} in]{.underline} the
process known as "imperial [[overstretch]{.underline}]{.mark}."
**[[Imperial overstretch]{.underline}]{.mark}** [[occurs when the
burdens]{.mark} of empire permanently [outweigh]{.mark} its [benefits
and the **constant drain** of resources leads to a **relative decline**
in power]{.mark}]{.underline}[.]{.mark} The economic profitability and
dynamics of empire have therefore been central themes of academic
debates. Marxist theories, in particular, have identified the need for
the expansion of capitalism, that is, its insatiable quest for raw
materials, new markets, and investment opportunities, as the driving
force of imperialism. In addition, the promise of economic profit, based
on the exploitation of colonized peoples, is supposed to stabilize
capitalism at home by making the lower classes stakeholders in the
empire. An influential historiographical school, spawned by the
diplomatic historian William A. Williams, argues that [the history of
[American foreign policy is best understood as the]{.mark} ongoing
[pursuit of]{.mark} an informal capitalist empire of **[trade]{.mark}**,
[**finance**, and **consumer markets**]{.mark}]{.underline} (Williams
1972). While [[American leaders]{.underline}]{.mark} have sought to
avoid the costs of direct imperial rule and instead pressed for free
trade and open markets, they have [[never hesitat]{.mark}ed [to use **US
power** to make the **world safe** for]{.mark}]{.underline} capitalism,
according to this school of interpretation. Its antagonists, however,
deny that economic prowess and free trade are tantamount to imperialism
and contend that the global spread of US-style democratic capitalism
"brought down the world order known as empire" (Cobbs Hoffman 2013:
12--13). In this perspective **[[democratic
capitalism]{.underline}]{.mark}** [has]{.underline} benefited [[the
**economic development** of]{.mark} those [nations]{.mark} that opened
themselves to its principles,]{.underline} while their populations have
eagerly embraced American consumerism. Even historians who lament that
the "Americanization" of Europe has buried venerable cultural traditions
concede that America\'s consumer empire was "irresistible" (De Grazia
2005). There is no question that economic interests have played a key
role in US foreign relations and that [lobby groups have exerted
considerable influence in employing American power to open markets and
safeguard investments]{.underline}. One may also argue that [American
[consumers and workers have profited from a **global commercial
empire**]{.mark} [that provided]{.mark} them with [cheap]{.mark}
imported [goods and stimulated the creation of]{.mark} manufacturing
[jobs]{.mark} at home]{.underline}, at least for some time. However,
imperialism, colonialism, and the pursuit of an informal economic empire
have never had an American mass following based on expectations of
material benefits. Most Americans have rejected empire and imperialism
as "un-American." Foreign commitments have usually been viewed as
unwelcome burdens on US taxpayers to be justified only in the name of
national security. American labor unions have traditionally advocated
protectionist policies, which are at odds with the vision of a boundless
capitalist empire of free trade. Since the early 20th century [the
United States has been the world\'s largest and dominant economy, and US
foreign policymakers have worked incessantly to create friendly
environments for American capitalism wherever possible.]{.underline} In
the Caribbean and in South America, in particular, economic penetration
by American business interests at times resembled colonial rule, while
America\'s economic relations with the developed industrial world have
generally been more balanced. [[The **chief economic incentive**]{.mark}
for building an empire, some historians argue]{.underline} (Maier 2006:
57--59), [[is]{.underline}]{.mark} not colonial exploitation but [[the
desire to **ensure stability**]{.mark} and reliability.]{.underline} For
the modern United States that objective [has best been served by a
liberal capitalist world order dominated by American principles and the
sheer weight of the US economy]{.underline}. Charges of American
imperialism from the left notwithstanding, [[many]{.underline}]{.mark}
other [[nations have accepted America]{.underline}]{.mark}\'s "market
empire" [[because it promised **prosperity** and
**stability**]{.underline}]{.mark} and appeared preferable to its major
historical competitors, notably communism.

### UQ / IL -- Arms Sales Key to Balance of Power 

#### US arms sales to Saudi Arabia fuel [regional power imbalances]{.underline} that statistically increase the risk of Middle East [instability]{.underline} and [conflict]{.underline} 

**Thrall & Dorminey 18** (A. Trevor Thrall is an associate professor at
the Schar School of Policy and Government at George Mason University and

MIT, and \*Caroline Dorminey is a policy analyst at the Cato Institute,

Regional Effects. [Arms sales]{.underline} do not just affect the
recipient nation; they also [affect the local balance of power, often
causing **ripple effects** throughout the region]{.underline}. Though
advocates of arms sales trumpet their stabilizing influence, as we have
noted above, [arms sales]{.underline} often [lead to greater tension,
less stability, and more conflict]{.underline}. Because of this --- and
the complementary problem of weapons dispersion --- the regional impact
of arms sales is less predictable and more problematic than advocates
acknowledge. Instability, Violence, and Conflict. First, [arms sales can
make conflict more likely]{.underline}.79 This may occur because
[recipients of new weapons feel **more confident** about **launching
attacks** or because changes in the local balance of power can **fuel
tensions** and promote **preventive strikes** by others]{.underline}. [A
study of arms sales from 1950 to]{.underline} 19[95]{.underline}, for
example, [found that although arms sales appeared to have some
restraining effect on major-power allies, they had the opposite effect
in other cases,]{.underline} and concluded that "[increased arms
transfers]{.underline} from major powers [make states significantly more
likely to be militarized dispute initiators]{.underline}."80 Another
study focused on sub-Saharan Africa from 1967 to 1997 found that "arms
transfers are significant and positive predictors of increased
probability of war."81 Recent history provides supporting evidence for
these findings: since 2011, [Saudi Arabia, the leading buyer of American
weapons, has intervened to varying degrees in **Yemen**, **Tunisia**,
**Syria**, and **Qatar**.]{.underline} Second, [arms sales]{.underline}
can also [prolong and intensify ongoing conflicts and erode rather than
promote regional stability]{.underline}. [Few governments]{.underline},
and fewer insurgencies, [have large enough weapons stocks to fight for
long without resupply]{.underline}.82 [The tendency of external powers
to arm the side they support]{.underline}, however understandable
strategically, [has the **inevitable result** of allowing the conflict
to continue at a **higher level of intensity** than would otherwise be
the case.]{.underline} As one study of arms sales to Africa notes,
"Weapons imports are essential additives in this recipe for armed
conflict and carnage."83 Third, this dynamic appears to be particularly
troublesome with respect to internal conflicts. Jennifer Erickson, for
example, found that recipients of major conventional weapons are 70
percent more likely to engage in internal conflicts than other states.
Though halting arms sales alone is not a panacea for peace and
stability, arms embargoes can help lessen the destructiveness of combat
in both civil and interstate wars simply by restricting access to the
means of violence.84 Finally, because of their effects on both
interstate and internal conflict, [arms sales]{.underline} can also
**[erode]{.underline}** rather than promote **[regional
stability]{.underline}**. As noted in the previous section, where the
United States seeks to manage regional balances of power, arms sales
often [**create tension**, whether because **the**]{.underline} American
**[\[U.S.\] role in the region threatens others]{.underline}**
[or]{.underline} because American **[\[U.S.\] clients feel
emboldened]{.underline}**. [The Middle East]{.underline}, for example,
[has seesawed between violence and tense standoffs for the past many
decades]{.underline}, at first because of Cold War competition and more
recently because of the American war on terror. [The notion that
increased U.S. arms sales]{.underline} since 9/11 [made the Middle East
more stable is far-fetched to say the least]{.underline}. Similarly,
though many argue that American security commitments to countries like
Japan, Taiwan, and South Korea have produced greater stability, there is
a strong case to be made that the opposite is now true. American support
of South Korea has driven North Korea to develop nuclear weapons; the
presence of U.S. missile defense systems in South Korea has aggravated
China, and American support of Taiwan produces continual tension between
the two powers.85

#### US influence in the Middle East is failing now -- Saudi Arabia's privileged status on arms sales will encourage reckless behavior and disrupt regional balance of power 

**Lucas 18** (Russell E. Lucas is the director of global studies in the
arts and humanities and an associate professor of international
relations at Michigan State University, "Arms and influence in the
Khashoggi affair," 10-16,
<https://www.pri.org/stories/2018-10-16/arms-and-influence-khashoggi-affair)//CMR>

President Donald [Trump's reaction to]{.underline} the disappearance and
death of Saudi journalist Jamal [Khashoggi]{.underline} in Istanbul
[reveals]{.underline} important details about [the **declining
influence** of US in the Middle East.]{.underline} As a scholar who
follows the links between international and domestic politics in the
Middle East, it is not hard to see that [what]{.underline} President
Donald [Trump has said]{.underline} so far [about]{.underline} the
[Khashoggi]{.underline} affair [will **accelerate** the **diminishing
power** of the US in the Middle East.]{.underline} New dynamic for an
old alliance [American influence in the Middle East --- especially over
Saudi Arabia --- was **already waning** before Trump]{.underline}'s
election. After the Bush administration's failure to turn post-invasion
Iraq into a model of pro-American democracy in the Middle East, the
Obama administration attempted to avoid Middle East military quagmires.
Instead, it tried to use diplomacy to negotiate with Iran on its nuclear
program. But [asking the Saudis to share their neighborhood
with]{.underline} their [Iran]{.underline}ian rivals [was]{.underline}
instead [seen by Saudis as asking for Arab acquiescence to Iranian
power.]{.underline} The recent rise of Saudi Crown Prince Mohammad bin
Salman pushed Saudi Arabia from a country that preferred to work in the
background in international affairs into a nation that stepped up its
activity as the US stepped back. [The Saudis took Trump's election as an
opportunity to push the US for a harder line on Iran]{.underline}. They
wanted the US to reverse the nuclear deal and do more to block Iran's
clients in Syria, Yemen, Iraq and Bahrain. The Saudis also wanted to arm
themselves with more modern weapons systems. Trump and the art of the
arms deal [Trump's vision of Saudi-US relations has arms sales by the US
to Saudi Arabia **at its center**]{.underline}, which is an example of
**[how his "America First" foreign policy works.]{.underline}** In
Trump's first foreign visit as president, he flew to Saudi Arabia and
signed a deal to sell \$110 billion worth of arms to the Saudis. Trump
emerged from that trip with a close relationship to Crown Prince Salman,
who drives much of Saudi government policy for his aged father, King
Salman. Since then, the prince has developed a strong relationship with
Trump's son-in-law, Jared Kushner, who serves as a regular liaison
between the U.S. and Saudi Arabia. Recently, Trump rejected the idea of
Congress imposing sanctions on Saudi Arabia if the Saudis were found
responsible for killing Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi. Trump said, "I
don't like stopping massive amounts of money that's being poured into
our country on --- I know they're talking about different kinds of
sanctions, but they're spending \$110 billion on military equipment and
on things that create jobs, like jobs and others, for this country." In
another interview, Trump said that he told the King of Saudi Arabia
"King, you've gotta pay" for American protection. Arms or influence?
[Trump's transactional foreign policy is primarily concerned with money
and American jobs]{.underline}. [Previous]{.underline} bipartisan
[cornerstones of US foreign policy have fallen to the wayside,
including]{.underline} promoting human rights and democracy or [seeking
a **strategic balance of power**]{.underline} [favorable to American
interests. This policy risks pushing US influence in the Middle East
**further to the margins**.]{.underline} In Trump's calculations, the US
cannot sanction or chastise Riyadh (Saudi Arabia\'s capital) because it
would hurt the US more than it would Saudi Arabia. American jobs would
be lost if the Saudis turned to purchasing arms from Russia or China.
While Trump may believe his own accounting of the \$110 billion in arms
sales, there are questions as to whether the sales are really worth far
less. Moreover, some observers have remarked that the US arms sales were
trading human rights for profit. In addition to concerns about the lack
of freedom within Saudi Arabia, others have worried that these arms will
aid what has become a shockingly deadly Saudi intervention in Yemen. The
Saudis have threatened "that if it receives any action, it will respond
with greater action, and that the Kingdom's economy has an influential
and vital role in the global economy." The exact nature of these actions
remains unclear. These threats, however, play on fears that the Saudis
would cancel the arms purchase or raise the price of oil. And late on
Monday, reports emerged that Saudi Arabia was going to admit
accidentally killing Khashoggi in an interrogation. President [Trump has
**emboldened Saudi Arabia**]{.underline} [by relying on his personal
diplomacy and focusing on jobs rather than broader American interests or
ideals.]{.underline} If the Saudis are able to keep the US out of the
Khashoggi affair, then [Trump has opened the door to **further limits on
US influence** in the Middle East.]{.underline}

### Heg Bad -- Catch-All\* 

#### Middle East heg is [unsustainable]{.underline} -- decline ensures [regional balancing]{.underline} and solves [US overstretch]{.underline} 

**Walt 18** -- IR Prof @ Harvard, PhD (Stephen M, Robert and Renée
Belfer professor of international relations at Harvard University, "What
Sort of World Are We Headed for?," 10-2,

One obvious implication: [No country is going to be able to "dominate"
the Middle East. The U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates
[**couldn't** manage the region **at the peak of the unipolar moment**,
and it is risible to claim]{.underline} (as some hawks do), [that Iran
is]{.underline} in the process of [taking over. Tehran lacks the
economic and military capacity to dominate the Middle East]{.underline},
particularly because it faces so many opponents in so many places.
[That's true of the other regional players, too, including Egypt,
Israel, Saudi Arabia, Turkey, and the U]{.underline}nited
[A]{.underline}rab [E]{.underline}mirates. [With **no potential hegemon
in sight**, expect the U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates [to
revert back to the approach it followed from the end of World War II
through the early 1990s]{.underline}. Back then, [the
U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates [had a strategic interest in
Middle Eastern oil and security commitments to different countries,
but]{.underline} it kept its own military presence to a minimum.
Instead, [it relied on **other states** or **local allies** to **uphold
the regional balance of power**]{.underline}. That policy shifted with
Operation Desert Storm in 1990 and the adoption of "dual containment" in
1993, and even more so with the invasion of Iraq in 2003 and the
ill-fated attempt at regional transformation that followed. Die-hard
neoconservatives may not have learned the right lesson from that
debacle, but the rest of the country did. [Looking ahead, the
U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates [will **continue** to draw down
its military presence]{.underline}---as it is already doing today. [It
will rely instead on local clients, backed up by U.S. airpower, drones,
or special forces when absolutely necessary. But barring a major threat

[[Multiple Middle Eastern disputes are threatening to spill out of
control. This is largely due to the]{.mark} changed [role of the
U]{.mark}]{.underline}nited [[S]{.underline}]{.mark}tates.

Perceptions of U.S. unreliability were initially sparked by former U.S.
president Barack Obama's Middle East policies. This included his
declared pivot to Asia, support of the 2011 Arab popular revolts,
criticism of Israel as well as willingness to engage with Iran.

Trump's partisan approach

Donald Trump has proven to be more partisan than Mr. Obama in his
backing of the UAE, Saudi Arabia and Israel and his confrontational
approach of Iran.

Although Trump appears to have granted Middle Eastern partners near
carte-blanche, his mercurial unpredictability has made him no less
unreliable even in the perception of the foremost U.S. allies in the
region.

Mr. [[Trump's]{.mark} partisan [approach as well as his refusal to reign
in U.S. allies has led to potential escalation of multiple
conflicts.]{.mark}]{.underline} This in[[cludes the war in Yemen,
mounting tension in Gaza between Israel and Hamas, a race for
control]{.mark}]{.underline} of ports and military facilities
[[in]{.underline}]{.mark} the Horn of [[Africa, Israeli challenging of
Iran's presence in Syria as well as confrontation with
Iran.]{.underline}]{.mark}

At the same time, the fact that nations in the region need to fend more
for themselves has had some real consequences. For example, the UAE,
driven by a quest to control ports in the Horn of Africa and create a
string of military bases, together with Saudi Arabia, played a key role
in reconciling Ethiopia and Eritrea after more than two decades of cold
war.

Looming threat of conflict

More often however[[, U.S. allies appear to be increasingly locked into
pathways that threaten]{.mark} mounting violence, if not outright
[military confrontation.]{.mark}]{.underline}

[[The recent escalation of the Yemen war]{.underline}]{.mark} that
threatens the free flow of oil with Saudi Arabia halting oil shipments
through the Bab el Mandeb strait and an unverified claim by Houthi
rebels to have targeted Abu Dhabi's international airport [[constitutes
the latest fallout of U.S. failure.]{.underline}]{.mark}

Analysts see the halt in oil shipments as an effort to get major
military powers, including the United States, Europe and Muslim allies
like Pakistan and Egypt who have shied away from sending troops to
Yemen, to intervene to defeat the Houthis.

Many of those powers depend on oil shipments through Bab el Mandeb. The
bid to suck them into the Yemen war is an effort to secure a victory
that neither Saudi Arabia or the UAE have been able to achieve in more
than three years of fighting that has devastated Yemen.

Little wonder that external powers responded cautiously to the Saudi
halt of oil shipments. U.S. and EU spokespeople said they were aware of
the Saudi move.

U.S. support for Israel

Elsewhere in the region, [U.S. recognition of Jerusalem as Israel's
capital as well as unqualified support for Israel's hard-handed efforts
aided by Egypt and the Palestine Authority to squeeze Hamas and suppress
sustained protests along the Gaza-Israel border have emboldened Israeli
hardliners.]{.underline}

[It has prompted Palestinians to refuse U.S. mediation and]{.underline},
together with Hamas moves to capitalize on the mounting tension[,
threaten to spark renewed military confrontation that neither side
wants.]{.underline}

[The United States and Iran are locked into an escalating war of
words.]{.underline} This threatens further interruptions of the flow of
oil as well as doom and gloom against a backdrop of the imposition of
harsh U.S. sanctions.

[[The U]{.underline}]{.mark}nited [[S]{.underline}]{.mark}tates [[and
Saudi Arabia]{.mark}, in an effort to topple the regime in Tehran, [even
toy with attempting to spur ethnic unrest in Iran.]{.mark}]{.underline}

[None of these moves will help stabilize a region that desperately needs
it.]{.underline}

More than any other region in the world, the Middle East is defined not
by commercial ties, diplomatic interaction, or regional organizations,
but by hard power and military might. This has been the case for the
region's modern history and will remain so for the foreseeable future.
But [[not since the collapse of the Ottoman Empire]{.underline}]{.mark}
a century [ago [has the Middle East been so convulsed by regional
turbulence and internal conflict.]{.mark}]{.underline}

Amid this crumbling regional order, the [[ongoing civil wars,]{.mark}
especially in Syria and Yemen but also in Libya [and]{.mark} Iraq, have
become apparently intractable. [Regional power struggles]{.mark}, such
as the rivalry between Saudi Arabia and Iran,]{.underline} are widely
understood to be complicating factors. But while such rivalries are
indeed consequential[[, broader dynamics have also made these conflicts
particularly long and ugly.]{.underline}]{.mark}

[[Four factors in particular have served to escalate and perpetuate
conflicts.]{.underline}]{.mark} [First, the [regional balance of power
has been]{.mark} highly [uncertain following]{.mark} the 2011
uprisings]{.underline} as well as [the aftermath of the 2003 [U.S.
invasion of Iraq]{.mark}]{.underline}. Second, local disputes have
become the stage on which ever-present regional rivalries are playing
out in larger, more lethal conflicts[. Third, [arms imports to the
region have skyrocketed---sales]{.mark} for which [the
U]{.mark}]{.underline}nited [[S]{.underline}]{.mark}tates [[and its
European allies actively compete]{.underline}]{.mark}. And fourth, the
Middle East suffers from a notable dearth of norms of warfare and
dispute resolution mechanisms in comparison with other regions of the
world. The result is a complicated hornet's nest of military
interventions across the region.

[[Overcoming these factors is a daunting task for regional and
international policymakers]{.mark}. Even in optimistic scenarios,
progress toward deescalation and stability is likely to be incremental,
slow, and uneven]{.underline}. Nonetheless, there are concrete steps
that regional and international actors can explore to mitigate the
dangers of these conflict escalators.

Beyond these broad factors, the particularities of each conflict as well
as the interests of the intervening parties must be considered, and they
are treated at the end of this chapter in a series of
question-and-answer commentaries with experts from the countries under
discussion.

Conflict Escalator 1: Shifting Regional Power Dynamics

[Among the casualties of the turbulence following the 2011 Arab Spring
was the status quo regional power distribution.]{.underline} Countries
formerly seen as regional authoritarian anchors, such as Zine el-Abidine
Ben Ali's Tunisia, Hosni Mubarak's Egypt, Bashar al-Assad's Syria, and
Muammar Qaddafi's Libya proved to be brittle shells that succumbed to
domestic turmoil or conflict. [Scarred by its Middle East forays since
the September 11 terrorist attacks, Washington has been unable---or
unwilling---to sustain the prevailing regional order.]{.underline} The
successive U.S. presidential administrations of Barack Obama and Donald
Trump have played a less vigorous role than their predecessors in
attempting to mediate conflicts; they have also pursued policies toward
Iran and Israel, respectively, that Arab states have found alarming in
various ways.

[Iran, Syria, and Hezbollah have long proclaimed an "axis of resistance"
in opposition to the U.S.-led regional security order and have been
united in their animus against Israel.]{.underline} Iran had little
direct involvement with the initial turbulence in Syria and Yemen, but
it certainly sought to take advantage of the institutional fractures and
sectarian cleavages that followed. Alarmed at these developments,
Israel, Saudi Arabia, and the United Arab Emirates have found their
threat perceptions steadily converging in recent years.

But it has been the actions of two global powers---[[the United States
and Russia]{.underline}]{.mark}---that [[have solidified these nascent
alignments into something resembling regional
blocs]{.underline}]{.mark}. Russia's September 2015 military
intervention on behalf of the Assad government brought it into a
military partnership with Iran, Syria, and Hezbollah.1 [[The Obama
admin]{.underline}]{.mark}istration had [[sought to straddle this
regional division]{.underline}]{.mark}---continuing security cooperation
with Israel, Saudi Arabia, and the United Arab Emirates while leading
negotiations on the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA) for
Iran's nuclear program. [[But the administration's
inability]{.underline}]{.mark} to translate the JCPOA into a new modus
vivendi with Iran on its regional activities [[coupled with the more
hawkish Trump admin]{.underline}]{.mark}istration---including its May
2018 exit from the JCPOA---[[have further solidified the anti-Iran
bloc.]{.underline}]{.mark}

[Each of these blocs has its own contradictions]{.underline}. Syria is
the fulcrum of Russian-Iranian cooperation. Yet Russia has sought to
work through the nominally nonsectarian Syrian military, while Iran
employs sectarian militias that undermine the state's coherence.
Moscow's muted reaction to Israel's wide-ranging May 2018 airstrikes
against Iranian assets inside Syria---compared to its vociferous
protests to the United States' far more limited airstrikes against
suspected chemical weapons facilities a month earlier---suggests it is
not troubled to see Iranian military capacity in Syria reduced.

Meanwhile, the U.S.-led bloc is an inchoate alignment of shared
antipathy toward Iran rather than a proper military alliance. Absent a
Palestinian state, Israel will continue to lack even basic diplomatic
relations with Saudi Arabia or the UAE.

There is also cross-fertilization between the blocs. Despite its
partnership with Iran in Syria, Russia has maintained serviceable
relations with most regional states, including U.S. security partners.2
Turkey remains a North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) member and a
member of the U.S.-led coalition to combat the self-proclaimed Islamic
State. But relations between Washington and Ankara have become severely
strained, in part because of continued U.S. support for Syrian Kurdish
rebels. Turkey has also participated with Russia and Iran in the Astana
process, which has supported a series of ceasefire agreements between
pro-Assad Syrian forces and rebel groups while allowing Russia to expand
its political influence inside Syria. Meanwhile, Saudi Arabia and the
UAE have pursued counterproductive ideological and power struggles with
Turkey and Qatar, further pushing these former partners to flirt with
Iran.

[Against this complicated backdrop, [four competitive
dyads]{.mark}]{.underline}---Saudi Arabia--Iran, Israel-Iran, U.S.-Iran,
and U.S.-Russia---[seem [especially critical to shaping a new regional
security balance. The likelihood of resolving any of these is
low.]{.mark}]{.underline} Some of these struggles are viewed in
near-existential terms, while leaders in others appear to derive
significant political benefits from the rivalries.

While reconciliation among the most contentious of these axes may not be
possible for the foreseeable future, there is an urgent need to explore
whether these inevitable competitions for influence can be made less
lethal. This would spare states such as Syria and Yemen their wholesale
destruction, and allow Middle Eastern governments the opportunity to
focus on providing for the social and economic well-being of their
citizens.

Scholars of international security policy warn of security dilemmas, in
which steps taken by one state to increase its security result in
countermeasures from an adversary who in turn feels less secure, thus
risking a chain reaction leading to conflict.3 This dynamic well
describes today's Middle East. To observers in Israel or Saudi Arabia,
it is self-evident that Iran is playing a highly destructive role in
places such as Lebanon, Syria, and Yemen. Israeli security officials
point to the importance of creating credible military deterrence given
decades of Iranian hostility.4 [From an Iranian perspective, however,
such actions are justified as a defensive response to Israeli threats of
military strikes and the U.S. military installations in close proximity
to Iran's borders.]{.underline}5

The Trump administration has recently announced efforts to create a
Middle East Strategic Alliance (MESA) with the Gulf Cooperation Council
states, Egypt, and Jordan.6 Although the prospects for success seem low
given inter-Arab divisions and the track record of previous initiatives,
such an alliance could certainly produce tangible security benefits for
its members in coordinating counterterrorism efforts and countering
Iranian influence. But in so doing it would likely to harden divisions
in the Middle East.

In comparison with almost every other geographical region, the Middle
East suffers from a lack of both regional dispute resolution mechanisms
and diplomatic protocols that might reduce the scope for regional
conflict. While the Cold War was defined by the antagonism between NATO
and the Warsaw Pact, both sides increasingly felt the need for inclusive
institutions and mechanisms to reduce tensions. Every U.S. president
during the Cold War, from Dwight D. Eisenhower to George H. W. Bush, met
with his Soviet counterpart. During the tensest moments, high-level
U.S.-Soviet channels of communications were especially important. Over
time, a number of confidence-building institutions and
transparency-enhancing measures were created, including the Organization
for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE), successive arms control
agreements, and later the Treaty on Open Skies, which allows for unarmed
surveillance flights over signatory countries to promote military and
nuclear weapons openness.

In the Middle East, however, the absence of any similar mechanisms or
organizations, particularly amid proliferating military conflicts, feeds
security dilemmas across multiple vectors, so that steps justified by
one state as necessary to its security---military intervention, arms
procurement, alliance formation, and so on---are perceived by its rivals
as threatening.

During the Israeli-Palestinian peace efforts of the 1990s, there were
attempts to build mechanisms for regional communication and cooperation.
Participants at the 1991 Madrid Conference set up five multilateral
working groups to address regional challenges, each involving Israel and
a range of Arab states. The centerpiece was the Arms Control and
Regional Security (ACRS) working group, which marked the first bid to
create a formal multilateral framework for regional security issues. Six
ACRS plenary sessions, co-hosted by the United States and Russia, were
held and a series of regional confidence-building measures were outlined
before the working group slowly broke down by 1995 under the weight of
regional animosities and implementation challenges. While all of the
working groups have long been defunct, one tangible result survives: the
Middle East Desalination Research Center in Oman, created in 1995. The
center conducts transboundary water research and development projects,
and its membership includes Israel, Jordan, Oman, Palestine, and Qatar
as well as several Western nations.

**Chengde 10/9** (Yin Chengde, a researcher for the China Foundation for
International Studies, "The US' Pursuit of Hegemony Has Harmed the
Middle East", October 9, 2018,

Lowell-JS

At this year's United Nations General Assembly, US President Donald
[Trump launched a]{.underline}n unprecedentedly [strong attack on
Iran,]{.underline} pledging to impose more, and harsher, sanctions on
it, and [threatened to punish countries and companies doing business
with it. This]{.underline} is [reflects the US' ultra-strong anti-Iran
policy,]{.underline} as well as a [plan to extend US hegemony in the
Middle East.]{.underline}

In the post-Cold War era, [[the US has adopted a Middle East strategy
aiming at exclusive US domination]{.underline}]{.mark}, helping Israel
grow stronger, [[orchestrating regime change in various countries, and
promoting all-round Westernization]{.underline}]{.mark}. [It doesn't
even hesitate to topple governments of sovereign countries by
force]{.underline}. During Barack Obama's second term as US president,
in order to shift its strategic focus eastward to the Asia-Pacific, the
US' Middle East strategy contracted somewhat, and policies tended to be
pragmatic. For instance, it withdrew partially from Iraq, ending the
Iraq war that had lasted nearly a decade; loosened relations with Iran,
signing the Iran nuclear deal; and kept a certain distance from the
ultra-rightist Israeli government. Such moves eased tensions in the
turbulent Middle East. Conditions have changed abruptly since
[[Trump]{.underline}]{.mark} assumed the presidency. He [[reversed
Obama's approaches, and redoubled endeavors to promote US
hegemony]{.underline}]{.mark}. [He withdrew from the Iran nuclear
deal]{.underline}, and [restored]{.underline} and enhanced comprehensive
[sanctions]{.underline}. He [[supported Israel]{.underline}]{.mark} and
[[suppressed Palestine]{.underline}]{.mark}, recognizing Jerusalem as
the Israeli capital and moving the US embassy there,
[[cancelling]{.underline}]{.mark} various [[aid programs for
Palestine]{.underline}]{.mark}, including humanitarian assistance to
Palestinian refugees, closing the PLO office in Washington, proposing an
"ultimate solution" to the Israel-Palestine conflict that is completely
in favor of the former. He [[carried out multiple rounds of
indiscriminate bombing in Syria]{.underline}]{.mark}, increased US
troops stationed there to more than 2,000, and [[opened a de facto
exclusive US "enclave" there]{.underline}]{.mark}. More importantly, the
Trump administration is racing against time to [[organize an anti-Iran
alliance amongst]{.underline}]{.mark} mostly [[Arab Sunni
countries]{.underline}]{.mark} in the Gulf area [[against Shiite nations
like Iran and Syria]{.underline}]{.mark}, in order [[to more
forcefully]{.mark}]{.underline} and effectively [[strike and bring down
the Iranian and Syrian governments, check Russia influence, and,
consolidate its position in the Middle East]{.mark}. No other US
administration in the past three decades has pursued such a tough
strategy of hegemony in the region.]{.underline}

[[The Trump administration has seriously disturbed and worsened regional
conditions, sinking it in tensions, turmoil]{.mark}, even [wars]{.mark}
not seen for many years. [First, it discontinued the Israel-Palestine
peace process, and re-started their conflict.]{.mark}]{.underline} The
problem with Trump's Middle East policy is not just being partial to
Israel, but bullying Palestine, disqualifying itself as a mediator, with
Palestine angrily rejecting the US' mediating role, and suing it for
violations of international law. Second, it instigated and worsened
confrontations between two groups in the region. [By persuading Saudi
Arabia-led Arab Sunni countries to intervene in the Syria war and act
against Iran, the US will inevitably worsen relations between Saudi-led
Sunni nations and Iran-led Shiite ones.]{.underline} The US strategy of
fighting Arabs with Arabs and fighting Muslims with Muslims has turned
the two religious denominations' into a major source of conflicts.
[[Third, it seriously undermined the nuclear non-proliferation regime
and global security.]{.underline}]{.mark} The Iran nuclear deal was
achieved through difficult, protracted negotiations by six parties. [The
Trump administration's withdrawal and re-imposition of sanctions has
created uncertainty for the future of the agreement. If Iran can't
receive the practical benefits it deserves for forsaking nuclear
weapons, it may withdraw from the agreement and restart its nuclear
program. [The US move may open the "Pandora's box" of nuclear
proliferation in the Middle East.]{.mark}]{.underline} [[Fourth, it
amplified risks of conflict between major
countries.]{.underline}]{.mark} The Middle East is the focus of
US-Russia geo-political competition. The US sees Iran and Syria as the
only hostile and alien countries threatening US interests in the Middle
East. The main goal of its regional policy is to suppress them and
prompt regime change in the two countries. Russia, on the other hand, is
offering strong support for both, preventing the US from fulfilling that
goal. Syria is Russia's sole strategic foothold in the Middle East,
which it will do everything to preserve. With the civil war in Syria
reaching its last juncture, the Russia-led Syria-Iran camp will try hard
to liberate the country's entire territory, and the US-led anti-Syria
camp will not back down. [The US' illegal direct military intervention
in Syria will very likely lead to military conflict with
Russia.]{.underline}

### Heg Bad -- Overstretch 

#### US middle east heg leads to overstretch 

**Buchanan 19** (Patrick Buchanan, writer for *The American
Conservative*, "The Face of Imperial Overstretch", February 22, 2019,
<https://www.theamericanconservative.com/buchanan/the-face-of-imperial-overstretch/>)
//Lowell-JS

Still, the lead role that Trump has assumed in the crisis raises a
question. [[Does the reflexive interventionism]{.mark}---America is "the
indispensable nation!"---that propelled us into the forever war of the
Middle East, [retain its hold on the American mind?]{.mark}]{.underline}

Next week, Trump meets in Hanoi with North Korea's Kim Jong Un.

While Kim has not tested his missiles or nuclear warheads in a year, few
believe he will ever surrender the weapons that secure his survival and
brought the U.S. superpower to the negotiating table.

Is Trump prepared to accept a deal that leaves a nuclear North but
brings about a peace treaty, diplomatic relations and a withdrawal of
U.S. troops from the Korean Peninsula? Or are American forces to be in
Korea indefinitely?

Nancy Pelosi's House just voted to cut off U.S. support for the Saudi
war against the Houthi rebels in Yemen. The Senate may follow.

Yet [[Trump is prepared to]{.mark} use his first veto to kill that War
Powers Resolution and [retain the right to help the Saudi war
effort]{.mark}.]{.underline}

[What is our vital interest in Yemen's civil war? [Why would Trump not
wish to extricate us from that moral and humanitarian
disaster?]{.mark}]{.underline}

Answer: Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman and his regime would sustain a
strategic defeat should the Houthis, supported by Iran, prevail.

Before the Warsaw conference called by the U.S. to discuss the Middle
East, Bibi Netanyahu's office tweeted: "This is an open meeting with
representatives of leading Arab countries, that are sitting down
together with Israel in order to advance the common interest of war with
Iran."

The "war-with-Iran" tweet was swiftly deleted, replaced with a new tweet
that spoke of "the common interest of combating Iran."

Like many Americans with whom he is close, Bibi has never hidden his
belief as to what we Americans must do to Iran.

Early this week came leaks that Trump officials have discovered that
Shiite Iran has been secretly collaborating with the Sunni terrorists of
al-Qaida. This could, headlined The Washington Times, provide "the legal
rationale for U.S. military strikes" on Iran.

At the Munich Security Conference, however, NATO allies Britain, France
and Germany recommitted to the Iran nuclear treaty from which Trump
withdrew, and to improved economic relations with Tehran.

[Trump pledged months ago to bring home the 2,000 U.S. troops in Syria
and half of the 14,000 in Afghanistan. But he is meeting resistance in
his own party in Congress and even in his own
administration.]{.underline}

[Reasons: A U.S. pullout from Syria would abandon our Kurdish allies to
the Turks, who see them as terrorists, and would force the Kurds to cut
a deal with Syria's Bashar Assad and Russia for their security and
survival.]{.underline}

[This week, Britain and France informed us that if we leave Syria, then
they leave, too.]{.underline}

As for pulling out of Afghanistan, the probable result would be the fall
of the Kabul government and return of the Taliban, who hold more
territory now than they have since being overthrown 18 years ago. For
Afghans who cast their lot with the Americans, it would not go well.

U.S. relations with Russia, which Trump promised to improve, have
chilled to Cold War status. The U.S. is pulling out of Ronald Reagan's
INF treaty, which bans land-based nuclear missiles of 300 to 3,000 mile
range.

Putin has said that any reintroduction of land-based U.S. missiles to
Europe would mean a new class of Russian missiles targeted on
Europe---and on the United States.

[Today, the U.S. maintains a policy of containment of Russia and China,
which are more united than they have been since the first days of the
Cold War. We are responsible for defending 28 NATO nations in Europe,
twice as many as during the Cold War, plus Japan, South Korea, the
Philippines, Australia and New Zealand.]{.underline}

[[We have troops in Syria, Iraq and Afghanistan, and appear on the cusp
of collisions with Venezuela and Iran.]{.mark} [Yet]{.mark} we field
[armed forces a fraction of the size they were in the 1950s]{.mark} and
1960s and the Reagan era.]{.underline}

And [[the U.S. national debt is]{.underline}]{.mark} now [[larger than
the U.S. economy.]{.underline}]{.mark}

[[This is imperial overstretch. It is
unsustainable.]{.underline}]{.mark}

#### US presence in Middle East hurts readiness for China and Russia Threats

fellow at the Lowy Institute and strategic risk consultancy the
Cognoscenti Group and a non-resident fellow at the Lowy Institute. "West
at Risk as U.S. Loses Military Edge." January 26, 2019.) \\\\ RM

China and Russia pose a growing challenge to American dominance The West
is slowly losing the contest for pre-eminence in the emerging
international order. Brexit is just one manifestation of the crisis of
confidence enveloping liberal democracies beset by a rising tide of
dissent, self-doubt, identity pol­itics and a loss of trust in the
foundational institutions of the post-World War II order. But the steady
erosion of US military cap­abilities is of even greater concern because
the West's traditional ­ad­vantage in hard power has ­under­pinned these
institutions and their guiding norms. If we lose our military edge, what
will prevent illiberal adversaries from under­­min­­ing our societies and
taking what they want by stealth or force? By the end of the 1980s,
Ronald Reagan had transformed the US military into a technologically
­superior force by exhausting Moscow in an arms race it could never win,
leading to the collapse of the Soviet Union. But in the years that
followed, the [US **frittered away** its]{.underline} conventional
[military superiority in the global war on terror and in draining
conflicts in Afghanistan and the Middle East,]{.underline} while failing
to recap­italise and innovate for the wars of the future or to prepare
for the ­inevitable rise of ­authoritarian competitors. Although they
include hostile regional powers like Iran and ­nuclear-armed North Korea,
[the greatest challenge is from China and Russia. Both have poured
enormous resources into]{.underline} decades-long defence modernisation
programs, dramatically [improving their military capabilities and
strategic reach]{.underline}. The result is a potentially game-changing
shift in the global balance of power in favour of autocracies. China
will soon ­attain military parity with the US in Asia. Most defence
experts ­believe this is ­likely to occur around 2025. Others, like former
NATO supreme commander James Stavridis, ­believe the People's Liberation
Army has ­already achieved effective parity. And Russia, although clearly
outmatched by the US globally, is well placed to achieve local
superiority over NATO in any short-duration regional crisis that might
develop along its Eurasian periphery. This shift in the military balance
is at the point where it is doubtful the US could prevail in a
conventional conflict with China and Russia at the same time. And it
might not be able to defeat either in ­regional conflicts close to home,
such as Ukraine and Taiwan, without risking losses that would be
­unacceptable to a war-weary and politically divided electorate. How did
it come to this? [American hubris, overstretch, complacency, division
and triumph­alism have all played a role along with a resolute
determination by China and Russia to]{.underline} redress humiliating
past defeats and [reassert themselves as major powers.]{.underline} US
military power peaked at the end of World War II. From 1939 to 1945 the
army transformed from a force of 187,000 to nearly 8.3 million ­active
duty soldiers. The navy and air force also ­expanded exponentially. By
war's end the navy's 6768 ships ­included 28 aircraft carriers and 23
battleships while the air force fielded 80,000 planes, 41 per cent of
them combat aircraft. And the US was the sole nuclear power until the
Soviet Union tested its first atomic bomb in 1949. These numbers were
­obviously unsustainable for a peacetime force. But for most of the Cold
War US military strength, particularly its ability to project power
globally, was superior to that of its nearest rival, the Soviet Union,
and dwarfed that of every other nation. This disparity was even more
pronounced at the turn of the century, when the US led in just about
every significant measure of military power. However, the seeds of
decline were sown at the end of the Cold War when the US began to lose
its advantage in key military and dual-use technologies. From the 1950s
to the mid-80s, the US was the dominant player in computer chips,
precision-guided ­munitions and space. Defence ­research in these areas
stimulated advances in the private sector, ­reducing costs, making the
technology widely available and ­reducing the Pentagon's control and
leading role. Today most new defence technologies come out of the
private sector and have proliferated ­widely. [China and Russia have
­invested heavily in emerging technologies with military applications
such as robotics, cyber, electromagnetic propulsion, hypersonic vehicles
and artificial intelligence]{.underline}, enabling them to close the
military-technology gap with the US. Russian President Vladimir Putin
believes the country that succeeds in dominating the field of AI "will
become ruler of the world", a sentiment his Chinese counterpart, Xi
Jinping, appears to share. [The]{.underline} evangelising,
nation-building [zeal of]{.underline} George W. [Bush's neocons, who
wrongly ­believed they could democratise the Middle East, and the
distracting global war on terror consumed much of the budget surplus
built up under previous administrations.]{.underline} [Precious defence
resources were redirected towards hugely expensive counter-terrorism and
counter-insurgency operations in ungoverned spaces around the world,
wearing out much of the military's equipment and draining inventories of
materiel and expensive smart munitions.]{.underline} Between 2002 and
2017 the US spent a staggering \$US2.8 trillion on funding the war
against terror and counter-insurgency wars in Iraq, Afghanistan and
Syria, equivalent to 16 per cent of the government's entire
discretionary budget. By comparison, World War II is estimated to have
cost about \$US4 trillion in today's dollars. For nearly two decades
America took its eye off the main game as China, Russia and other
potential adversaries built up their arsenals and sought to neutralise
US advantages. Compounding this error of judgment, the Bush and Obama
administrations ­under­estimated the determination of China and Russia to
­reassert themselves in Asia and Europe. [Overuse and underspending on
conventional weaponry have weakened]{.underline} the sinews of [this
once peerless military]{.underline}, a worrying ­development for allies
like Australia because of our defence reliance on the US. The US defence
budget flatlined under Barack Obama. Forced defence cuts by congress,
known as sequestration, exacerbated the Pentagon's funding problems from
2013. In 2017 exasperated former US defence secretary Jim Mattis
declared: "No enemy in the field has done more to harm the combat
readiness of our military than sequestration." The signs of American
military decline are unmistakable. Two-thirds of the navy's strike
fighters can't fly and more than half the navy's total aircraft are
grounded. Ships, including aircraft carriers and submarines, are
spending more time in maintenance and less time at sea. There are
serious shortages of key personnel and spare parts. The sealift fleet
faces the prospect of an imminent collapse because of the advanced age
of the ships that would be used to transport up to 90 per cent of army
and marine corps equipment in the event of a major conflict overseas.
Only three of the army's 10 divisions are combat-ready. Less than half
of marine corps aircraft are flyable. The air force is also in trouble.
Barely half the service was mission capable in 2016 against the required
level of 80 per cent. The US is also running out of smart bombs and
munitions that it has been expending at a rapid rate in Afghanistan and
other operational theatres. Despite plans to ­invest more than \$US20
billion (\$28bn) in their replenishment, the shrinking defence
industrial base may not be able quickly to replace them and other vital
components such as solid rocket [motors]{.underline}, thermal batteries,
fuses and small turbine ­engines. A White House report in October
identified more than 300 specific vulnerabilities in the defence
industrial base ranging from the mundane (sourcing material to make
tents and uniforms) to the strategic (rare earths critical for high-end
military equipment like radars, directed energy weapons, laser weapons,
smart bombs and drones). In many cases the main or sole suppliers are
Chinese, which puts the US in the untenable position of relying on a
potential adversary for minerals and compo­nents critical to operations.
Donald Trump has begun to address these shortfalls by authorising the
two largest defence budgets in US history --- \$US700bn in 2018 and
\$US716bn this year. But sustaining these increases will be difficult as
the annual US budget deficit approaches an eye-watering and
unsustainable \$US1 trillion. Trump's enhanced defence budgets will be
stretched by rising personnel costs and the need to ­replace ageing
legacy systems ­(including US nuclear and missile forces) concurrent with
the equally pressing need to invest in new capabilities to meet the
Chinese and Russian challenges. [Washington's problem is that it does
not have the resources to outmatch China's and Russia's combined
military capabilities and continue to play the role of global
cop]{.underline}. Trump recognises this ­dil­emma, which is one reason he
wants to withdraw from Afghanistan and other expensive overseas
commitments and return to a traditional offshore balancing role
­requiring allies and proxies to do more of the heavy regional lifting.
[China's rapid military strides are bringing a new urgency to the
task.]{.underline} The [PLA has transformed]{.underline} from a
backward, antiquated force [into a near peer rival]{.underline} in the
space of 20 years and is on the threshold of becoming a full-spectrum
military power. This has been achieved on the back of a massive and
sustained infusion of money and a shrewdly conceived, well-implemented
strategy that promises to realise President Xi's dream of a fully
modernised PLA by 2035 able to dominate the western Pacific and project
power globally. While the headline figures show that Trump's defence
budget is bigger than that of the next seven countries' combined,
outspending China by more than three to one, the actual difference is
far less ­because China gets considerably more operational bang for the
yuan. It has been able to leapfrog old technologies, learn from others'
mistakes, buy or steal the latest technology and avoid debilitating and
expensive foreign conflicts. Moreover, its official 2018 defence budget
of \$US175bn does not include many items that are routinely included in
the US equivalent, such as the cost of purchasing foreign weapons and
equipment, and defence research and development. What we do know is that
China increased ­defence spending by 356 per cent between 2001 and 2017,
and that it intends to spend a further \$US2 trillion on defence
modernisation over the next decade. As a result, the country already
boasts the world's largest force of conventionally armed ballistic and
cruise missiles. On present trends, China's navy will have roughly the
same number of warships as the US by 2021 but with a higher proportion
of modern ships. Its submarine fleet is already larger than the US's and
the navy is on track to have six aircraft carriers by 2030, which would
enable it to deploy four powerful carrier groups to support Beijing's
territorial claims in the East and South China seas. The army has been
downsized and modernised while the air force, which still lags behind
America's, is rapidly acquiring advanced capabilities. This means that
forward-­deployed US forces in Japan, South Korea, Guam and even ­Hawaii
are now vulnerable to ­attack from Chinese bombers and missiles launched
from the mainland, garrison islands in the South China Sea and the
Chinese fleet. Darwin is one of the few places in the western Pacific
where US ­forces can operate in relative ­safety. But the same cannot be
said of Taiwan, which is the focal point of China's rearmament. Many
­analysts believe China's military advances will make it ­extremely
difficult for the US to defend Taiwan from a Chinese ­attack without
recourse to nuclear weapons. Perhaps the greatest threat to US military
pre-eminence is China's single-minded, strategic approach to developing
the ­enabling technologies and capabilities crucial to future great power
status in contrast to the disjointed and domestically contested US
approach. Space is illus­trative. Once a space neophyte, the recent
landing of a lunar ­explorer on the dark side of the moon was an
impressive demonstration of China's determination to become this
century's space power. Conversely, the US President's much trumpeted
space force is unlikely to get off the launch pad due to congressional
opposition. The Chinese moon landing is the product of clear goals,
sustained funding and programmatic stability while US space policy lacks
focus and waxes and wanes with the political tide. Besides, Trump can't
just focus on China. He also has to deal with a rejuvenated,
­nuclear-capable Russian military. With an economy the size of Texas and
a shrinking, ageing population, Russia no longer poses a global threat
to the US. But Putin has beefed up military co-operation with China as a
means of balancing against the US and NATO in Europe, leveraging off
China's growing military strength. Taking a leaf from the Chinese play
book, Putin has also assiduously rebuilt a military decimated by the
Soviet Union's collapse, concentrating his limited resources on
exploiting perceived US and European vulnerabilities and selectively
developing hi-tech capabilities such as hypersonic missiles and
cyber-weapons. Between 2000 and 2016 Russian annual defence spending
rose from \$US20bn to \$US69bn (measured in 2016 dollars). At its high
point, this accounted for more than 4 per cent of GDP. Much of this
money has been spent in strategically astute ways, causing problems for
US and ­European defence planners. ­Despite a hit to the budget over the
past three years because of falling oil and gas revenues, Moscow still
plans to spend another \$US700bn over the next decade. Like a small cat
arching its back to scare off larger cats and dogs, Putin regularly
boasts about his country's military capabilities and rattles the cage of
adversaries by threatening to use nuclear weapons if Russia's core
interests are threatened. This has made the US and its NATO partners
more cautious in responding to Russian provocations in Ukraine and the
Caucasus. For many years the bluff succeeded as US politicians
customarily characterised Russia as a greater threat than China, a
flawed judgment that has only now been rectified by the Trump
adminis­tration's designation of China as its principal rival. None of
this is to suggest that the Chinese and Russian military are 10 feet
tall or that the US military is on the verge of collapse. America still
leads on most ­important indicators of military strength. David Ochmanek,
a former senior US defence official, ­believes many of the problems
confronting the Pentagon could be fixed with a modest and sustained
increase in targeted ­defence spending of about \$US55bn a year,
equivalent to no more than 0.3 per cent of GDP. But [the gap with China,
and to a lesser extent Russia, has narrowed to the point
where]{.underline}, short of all-out war, [US and Western military
­supremacy can no longer be assumed in several regional flashpoints,
especially in the maritime reaches of the western Pacific where the US
navy once ruled the waves.]{.underline} The harsh reality is that if all
the recommendations for ­improving the military contained in the 2018
national defence strategy were implemented, they would not restore the
overwhelming conventional military superiority Washington once enjoyed.

Terrorism and the War on Terror

To put it bluntly, [being in the Middle East as the "anchor of
stability" attracted 9/11 and the subsequent War on Terror]{.underline}.
It is true that the United States has an interest in countering
terrorism that flows from the Middle East. But that interest is largely
endogenous to being there in the first place. Its presence plays a large
role in generating that interest. While [the waves of jihad]{.underline}
are unlikely to be spent in the medium term, the menace is mostly
second-order, and [can be contained with a]{.underline}n unspectacular
[mix of international counter-terrorism, intelligence sharing,
espionage, and occasional targeted airstrikes]{.underline}. It would be
simplistic to dismiss the entire war effort as futile, given that it has
suppressed threats by destroying talented cadres and making havens
unsafe. The better critique is that [disruption and containment could be
achieved over the long haul at a lower price tag with patient police
work and more selective violent suppression, **without creating a
furnace of radicalisation and military training** under live fire that
war has provided.]{.underline}

[The causes of international terrorism are manifold and complex. It
remains the case, though, that the U]{.underline}nited
[S]{.underline}tates' [presence in the Middle East is a **central
generating cause** of violent hostility directed against
it]{.underline}. [This is a **causal claim**,]{.underline} not a moral
one. As **[a wide body of scholarship]{.underline}** on terrorism
[demonstrates]{.underline}, the horrific [attacks of 9/11
flowed]{.underline} primarily [from America's embroilment in the
politics of the Middle East, and in]{.underline} what had become [a
civil war within the Arab-Islamic world]{.underline}, centered on the
Gulf. 49 [That embroilment is inherent to America's "stabilising"
mission in the Gulf]{.underline}. The United States stepped into a
region afflicted by an interlocking set of governance problems -- a
growing Islamist movement, regimes that winked at or sponsored such
movements, and a set of conflicts that galvanised resentment: the
containment of Saddam Hussein's Iraq with sanctions, the
Israel-Palestine conflict, and growing resentment of oppressive Gulf
monarchies.

Contrary to a widespread received wisdom amongst primacists, the attacks
were not primarily the result of an absence of American power from
Afghanistan and Central Asia. In fact, [the **deeper driver** was
American **entanglement** and presence in **Saudi Arabia**,]{.underline}
a legacy from the Gulf War of 1990. While international Salafist-jihadi
ideology can never be reduced to one thing, and is adept at finding
grievances, its heartland of concern is the Middle East and its violent
nostalgia for a lost empire, or caliphate. [Al Qaeda and its affiliates
associate the plight of their sacred lands to rule by corrupt apostate
regimes, who are the clients of]{.underline} the "far enemy", [the
U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates. [Most of its potential
recruits are galvanised primarily by grievances related to the Middle
East]{.underline} -- and a fusion of struggles from Palestine and Iraq
to the Balkans and Kashmir- [rather than]{.underline} more distant
[cultural grievances about American democratic society]{.underline},
from unveiled women to consumerist profanity. Al Qaeda and its
descendants prey primarily on a fusion of region-specific grievances. As
just one of many cases, Osama Bin Laden trafficked on rage at the
brutality of international sanctions against Iraq, a centrepiece of
containment of a "rogue state", and what he, the B'aath Party, peace
activists and even Secretary of State Madeleine Albright agreed was
infanticide. Even though this charge was overblown, it made for
effective propaganda and eventually helped the case for war. 50

### Heg Bad -- Terror -- AT: No Lashout/War 

#### Nuclear terrorism causes extinction---misattribution errors, miscalc and high tensions spark global nuclear conflict 

**Hayes 18** (Peter Hayes, Director of the Nautilus Institute and
Honorary Professor at the Centre for International Security Studies at
the University of Sydney, "Non-State Terrorism and Inadvertent Nuclear
War", January 18, 2018,
https://nautilus.org/napsnet/napsnet-special-reports/non-state-terrorism-and-inadvertent-nuclear-war/)

We now move to our conclusion. [Nuclear-armed states]{.underline} can
[place themselves on the **edge of nuclear war**]{.underline} by a
combination of threatening force deployments and threat rhetoric.
Statements by US and North Korea's leaders and supporting amplification
by state and private media to present just such a lethal combination.
Many observers have observed that the risk of war and nuclear war, in
Korea and globally, have increased in the last few years---although
no-one can say with authority by how much and exactly for what reasons.
However, states are restrained in their actual decisions to escalate to
conflict and/or nuclear war by conventional deterrence, vital national
interests, and other institutional and political restraints, both
domestic and international. It is not easy, in the real world, or even
in fiction, to start nuclear
wars.[\[19\]](https://nautilus.org/napsnet/napsnet-special-reports/non-state-terrorism-and-inadvertent-nuclear-war/#_ftn19)
Rhetorical threats are standard fare in realist and constructivist
accounts of inter-state nuclear deterrence, compellence, and
reassurance, and are not cause for alarm per se. States will manage the
risk in each of the threat relationships with other nuclear armed states
to stay back from the brink, let alone go over it, as they have in the
past. This argument was powerful and to many, persuasive during the Cold
War although it does not deny the hair-raising risks taken by nuclear
armed states during this period. Today, [the multi-polarity of nine
nuclear weapons states interacting in a four-tiered nuclear threat
system means that the practice of sustaining nuclear threat and
preparing for nuclear war is no longer merely complicated, but is now
enormously complex in ways that may exceed the capacity of some and
perhaps all states to manage]{.underline}, even without the emergence of
a fifth tier of non-state actors to add further unpredictability to how
this system works in practice. The possibility that **[non-state
actors]{.underline}** may [attack]{.underline} without advance warning
as to the time, place, and angle of attack [presents another layer of
uncertainty to this complexity as to how inter-state nuclear war may
break out]{.underline}. That is, non-state actors with nuclear weapons
or threat goals and capacities do not seek the same goals, will not use
the same control systems, and will use radically different
organizational procedures and systems to deliver on their threats
compared with nuclear armed states. If used tactically for immediate
terrorist effect, a non-state nuclear terrorist could violently attack
nuclear facilities, exploiting any number of vulnerabilities in fuel
cycle facility security, or use actual nuclear materials and even
warheads against military or civilian targets. If a persistent,
strategically oriented nuclear terrorist succeed in gaining credible
nuclear threat capacities, it might take hostage one or more states or
cities. If such an event coincides with already high levels of tension
and even military collisions between the non-nuclear forces of nuclear
armed states, then [[a]{.underline}]{.mark} non-state **[[nuclear
terrorist attack]{.underline}]{.mark}** [[could impel a **nuclear armed
state**]{.underline}]{.mark} [[to **escalate**]{.underline}]{.mark} its
threat or even [[military actions]{.underline}]{.mark} [**[against other
states]{.underline}**, [in]{.underline}]{.mark} [the [belief]{.mark}
that [this]{.mark} targeted [state]{.mark} may have
**[sponsored]{.mark}** [the]{.mark} non-state
[attack]{.mark},]{.underline} or was simply the source of the attack,
whatever the declared identity of the attacking non-state entity.
[[This]{.underline}]{.mark} outcome [[could]{.underline}]{.mark}
**[[trigger]{.underline}]{.mark}** these states to go onto one or more
of the pathways to **[[inadvertent nuclear war]{.underline}]{.mark}**,
especially if the terrorist attack was on a high value and high risk
nuclear facility or involved the seizure and/or use of fissile material.
[Some]{.underline} experts [dismiss this possibility as]{.underline}
**[so remote]{.underline}** as to be not worth worrying about. **[Yet
the history]{.underline}** [of nuclear terrorism]{.underline} globally
and in the Northeast Asian region [suggests]{.underline}
**[otherwise]{.underline}**. Using the sand castle metaphor, once built
on the high tide line, sand castles may withstand the wind but
eventually succumb to the tide once it reaches the castle---at least
once, usually twice a day. Also, theories of organizational and
technological failure point to the coincidence of multiple, relatively
insignificant driving events that interact or accumulate in ways that
lead the "metasystem" to fail, even if each individual component of a
system works perfectly. Thus, the potential catalytic effect of a
nuclear terrorist incident is not that it would of itself lead to a
sudden inter-state nuclear war; but that [[at a time of
**crisis**]{.underline}]{.mark} [when]{.underline} **[[alert levels
are]{.mark} already [high]{.mark}]{.underline}**, [when control systems
on nuclear forces have already shifted from primary emphasis on negative
to positive control, when [**decision making** is]{.mark} already
**[stressed]{.mark}**]{.underline}, [when [the potential
for]{.mark}]{.underline} [[miscalc]{.underline}]{.mark}ulation
[[is]{.underline}]{.mark} already **[[high]{.underline}]{.mark}** due to
shows of force indicating that first-use is nigh, when rhetorical
threats promising annihilation on the one hand, or collapse of morale
and weakness on the other invite counter-vailing threats by nuclear
adversaries or their allies to gain the upper hand in the "contest of
resolve," and when organizational cybernetics may be in play such that
purposeful actions are implemented differently than intended, then [a
**terrorist nuclear attack**]{.underline} [may shift]{.underline} a
coincident combination of some or all of these [factors to a **threshold
level**]{.underline} [where they]{.underline} collectively [lead
to]{.underline} [a **first-use decision**]{.underline} [by **one or more
nuclear-armed states**]{.underline}. If the terrorist attack is timed or
happens to coincide with high levels of inter-state tension involving
nuclear-armed states, then some or all of these tendencies will likely
be in play anyway---precisely the concern of those who posit pathways to
inadvertent nuclear war as outlined in section 2 above. The critical
question is, just as a catalyst breaks some bonds and lets other bonds
form, reducing the energy cost and time taken to achieve a chemical
reaction, how would a nuclear terrorist attack at time of nuclear
charged inter-state tension potentially shift the way that nuclear
threat is projected and perceived in a four or five-way nuclear-prone
conflict, and how might it affect the potential pathways to inadvertent
nuclear war in such a system? Such a pervasive incremental effect is
shown in Figure 6 below. Any one or indeed all of these starting nuclear
control profiles may be disputed, as might the control profile at the
end of the response arrow. (In Figure 6, each nuclear state responds to
a terrorist nuclear attack by loosening or abandoning negative controls
against unauthorized use, and shifts towards reliance mostly on positive
procedural controls biased towards use). But each nuclear armed state
will make its moves in response to the posited terrorist nuclear attack
partly in response to its expectations as to how other nuclear armed
states will perceive and respond to these moves, as well as their
perception that an enemy state may have sponsored a terrorist nuclear
attack---and considered together, it is obvious that they may not share
a common image of the other states' motivations and actions in this
response, leading to cumulative potential for misinterpretation and
rapid subsequent action, reaction, and escalation. It is also
conceivable---although intuitively it would seem far less likely--that a
terrorist nuclear attack at such a conjuncture of partly or fully
mobilized nuclear armed states might induce one or more of them to stand
down, slow down its decision making or deployments, establish new
communication channels with potential nuclear enemy states, and even
make common cause to hunt down and eliminate the non-state nuclear
terrorist entity, or coordinate operations to respond to the threat of a
second terrorist nuclear attack---the credibility of which would be high
in the aftermath of a successful initial non-state nuclear attack. As
Robert Ayson concluded: In considering the ways in which [[a **terrorist
nuclear attack**]{.underline}]{.mark} [[could]{.underline}]{.mark}
(wittingly or unwittingly) [[spark off a **wider nuclear
exchange**]{.underline}]{.mark} government leaders are entitled to be
just as worried about their own actions---how they would respond to a
terrorist nuclear attack and how that response might get very
catastrophically out of control---as about the terrorist act per se. If
so, [states need to do more than consider the best ways to prevent
terrorists from acquiring, deploying and then detonating a nuclear
weapon]{.underline}. They also need to think about how they can control
themselves in the event of a nuclear terrorist attack (even if some
might suggest this risks handing the terrorist a premature and
unnecessary victory by giving them indirect influence over the choices
states
make).[\[20\]](https://nautilus.org/napsnet/napsnet-special-reports/non-state-terrorism-and-inadvertent-nuclear-war/#_ftn20)

What made the false alarm all the more frightening is just how plausible
the prospect of a nuclear strike has become. The U.S. and Russia, both
of which maintain massive nuclear arsenals, are increasingly at odds.
Iran has announced plans to ramp up its production of enriched uranium.
North Korea may already have nuclear missiles capable of striking
anywhere in the U.S., and there is no way to know whether Trump's
negotiations with Kim Jong-un will wind up increasing or decreasing the
prospect of nuclear war. But the current state of dread, while entirely
understandable, has overshadowed two crucial realities about the threat
of a nuclear calamity. First, **[a nuclear attack on the
U]{.underline}**nited **[S]{.underline}**tates **[could]{.underline}**
well **[come not from the skies but from the streets]{.underline}**.
Experts warn that **[[it would be]{.mark} relatively [easy for
terrorists to build a]{.mark}n "improvised [nuclear bomb" and smuggle it
into America]{.mark}]{.underline}**. [Building a ten-kiloton bomb nearly
as destructive as the one dropped on Hiroshima would require little more
than some technical expertise and 46 kilograms of highly enriched
uranium --- a quantity about the size of a bowling ball.]{.underline}
The second reality we have failed to understand is what a nuclear
detonation and its aftermath would actually look like. In our
imaginations, fueled by apocalyptic fictions like The Road and The Day
After, [the scale and speed of nuclear annihilation seem too vast and
horrific to contemplat]{.underline}e. If nuclear war is considered
"unthinkable," that is in no small part because of our refusal to think
about it with any clarity or specificity. In the long run, the best
deterrent to nuclear war may be to understand what a single nuclear bomb
is capable of doing to, say, a city like New York --- and to accept that
the **[reality would be even worse than our fears.]{.underline}** The
Bomb [[There are]{.underline}]{.mark} currently [at least [**2,000
tons** of]{.mark} weapons-grade nuclear [material]{.mark} stored in some
40 countries]{.underline} **[--- enough [to make]{.mark} more than
[40,000 bombs]{.mark}]{.underline}** approximately **[the size of the
one that devastated Hiroshima]{.underline}**. [**[Stealing the material
would be]{.mark} challenging but [far from impossible]{.mark}**[. Russia
stockpiles]{.mark} numerous bombs [built before]{.mark} the use of
[electronic locks]{.mark}]{.underline} that disable the weapons in the
event of tampering. [[Universities]{.mark} that handle uranium often
[have lax security]{.mark}.]{.underline} And [insiders at military
compounds]{.underline} sometimes [steal radioactive material and sell it
on the black market]{.underline}. [**Since 1993, [there have been
762]{.mark} known [instances in which]{.mark} radioactive [materials
were lost or stolen]{.mark}, and more than 2,000 cases of trafficking
and other criminal activities.** Once terrorists obtained the uranium,
they would need only a small team of sympathetic engineers and
physicists to build]{.underline} what is known as [a gun-type nuclear
bomb,]{.underline} like the one dropped on Hiroshima. A gun-type nuke
uses traditional explosives to fire a slug of uranium through a tube
directly into another chunk of uranium, fracturing huge numbers of atoms
and unleashing a massive amount of energy. Compared to modern nuclear
missiles, which are far more powerful and complex,
**[[constructing]{.mark} a crude gun-type [nuke is]{.mark} fairly
[straightforward]{.mark}]{.underline}**. In 2002, when Joe Biden was
chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, he asked several
nuclear laboratories whether a terrorist group could construct an
off-the-shelf nuclear weapon. Several months later, they gave their
answer: **[Without resorting to any illegal activities or drawing on
classified information, and [using only commercially available
parts,]{.mark} they had built a nuclear bomb that was "bigger than a
breadbox but smaller than a dump truck."]{.underline}** To underscore
the danger, Biden had them bring the device to the Senate. The last step
in the process --- **[[smuggling]{.mark} the weapon [into the
U]{.mark}]{.underline}**nited **[[S]{.underline}]{.mark}**tates ---
**[[would be]{.mark} even [easier]{.mark}.]{.underline}** [A ten-kiloton
bomb]{.underline}, which would release as much energy as 10,000 tons of
TNT, [would be only seven feet long and weigh about 1,000
pounds.]{.underline} [It would be simple to transport such a device to
America aboard a container ship,]{.underline} just another unseen object
in a giant metal box among millions of other metal boxes floating on the
ocean. Even a [moderate]{.underline} amount of [shielding would be
enough to hide its radioactive signature from]{.underline} most
[detectors]{.underline} at shipping hubs. [Given all the naturally
radioactive items that frequently trigger false alarms]{.underline} ---
bananas, ceramics, Brazil nuts, pet deodorizers --- [a terrorist group
could even bury the bomb in bags of Fresh Step or Tidy Cats to fool
inspectors]{.underline} if a security sensor was tripped. In 1946, a
senator asked J. Robert Oppenheimer, the physicist who played a key role
in the Manhattan Project, what instrument he would use to detect a
nuclear bomb smuggled into the United States. Oppenheimer's answer: "A
screwdriver." Amazingly, our detection systems have still not caught up
to this threat: One would essentially have to open and visually inspect
every single crate and container arriving on America's shores. [Once the
container ship reached a port like Newark, terrorists would have no
trouble loading the concealed bomb into the back of an unassuming white
van and driving it]{.underline} through the Lincoln Tunnel [directly
into Times Square.]{.underline}

### Heg Bad -- US Cred 

#### US involvement in the Middle East destroys US cred, status and makes the US more vulnerable

**Chengde 10/9** (Yin Chengde, a researcher for the China Foundation for
International Studies, "The US' Pursuit of Hegemony Has Harmed the

Trump assumes his extremely tough Middle East policy is the best way to
demonstrate his commitment to "America First", and is in the US'
interests, but he is actually wrong. [His irrational actions have done
severe harm to the interests of all stakeholders, and the US has ended
up being the foremost victim.]{.underline} Since US withdrawal from the
Iran nuclear deal has invited unanimous opposition from the
international community, especially the other five signatory countries,
[[the US threat to punish any country that does business with Iran and
suffocate the Iranian economy will not succeed.]{.underline}]{.mark} On
the contrary, [[the US' image and credibility have suffered a great
blow]{.underline}]{.mark}. The US finds itself in such unprecedented
isolation that [[some international media have branded it an
"international Pariah".]{.underline}]{.mark} [The [US withdrawal from
the deal]{.mark} may [also worsen nuclear prolif]{.mark}eration, [posing
a challenge to its own security]{.mark}]{.underline}. [By suppressing
Palestine and supporting Israel, the US has led to the discontinuation
of the peace process, prolonged and acerbated the suffering of the
Palestinians,]{.underline} which [[will inevitably sow seeds of
hostility against the US in Palestinians and Arab Muslims, and
international terrorism against the US may stage a
comeback]{.underline}]{.mark}. [Trump's reckless moves, which
he]{.underline} believes are smart, [may end up hurting the US itself.
It is thus hoped that the US government will learn from its past
failures and wake up from its obsession with hegemony.]{.underline}

### Heg Bad -- AT: Turns -- Top-Shelf 

#### Middle East heg is unsustainable and net-worse for stability -- err aff on probability and empirics

As with most issues, [there are tradeoffs]{.underline} involved
[in]{.underline} the question of [U.S. engagement in the Middle
East]{.underline}. The best realist case for withdrawal would not deny
that an abandonment would result in some increased disorder, and forego
some benefits. That would include the possible [loss of]{.underline}
some [influence]{.underline}, though it [is]{.underline} often
**[exaggerated]{.underline}**, some bases that afford striking power,
some resurgence of Islamist activity, and domestically, an increase in
domestic strife over foreign policy that most breaks from the status quo
entail.

[It is a question of **net assessment**, linked to America's wider grand
strategy]{.underline}. [Increasing disorder is already a feature of the
region's condition]{.underline}. It is already [a source of violent
blowback]{.underline}. Under the aegis of a U.S. client state in
Baghdad, the black flags of ISIL rose up. [Attempts to reimpose
order]{.underline} while on the front foot [have had **mixed
results**]{.underline}, to put it politely, [including spiralling debt,
wasted life, war without end]{.underline}, and Trump. The question is
whether [the U.S. could better secure its way of life by **tolerating
the risks of withdrawal** and any further disorder that would
follow]{.underline}. The analysis here suggests that it can, and [in
order to **bolster itself elsewhere**]{.underline}, it should. [The
**alternative**]{.underline} on offer [is]{.underline} not the status
quo, but **[a deteriorating version of the status quo]{.underline}**,
[driven]{.underline} in part [by the increasingly unrealistic pursuit of
unrivalled hegemony]{.underline}. To put it another way, the choice is
the likeliest path of least regret.

### Heg Bad -- AT: Iran 

#### Iran threat is hype -- [regional balancing]{.underline} and [naval power]{.underline} checks

It is unclear how military presence on the ground prevents oil
disruption. To begin with, [the proposition of an Iranian
hegemony]{.underline}, where an ascendant Iran seizes control of major
oil terminals or goes further and seizes whole state territories, [is
wildly exaggerated]{.underline}. [Iran simply lacks the
economic/military capacity to dominate its region]{.underline}. [Its GDP
is 439]{.underline}.51 \$US [billion, compared to the combined GDP of
its GCC enemies of]{.underline} \$[1.505 trillion]{.underline}.
[According to]{.underline} the Stockholm International Peace Research
Institute \[[SIPRI\], it devotes just "three percent of its gdp on its
military, less than the proportions spent by Saudi Arabia]{.underline}
(ten percent), [Israel]{.underline} (six percent), [Iraq]{.underline}
(five percent), [and Jordan]{.underline} (four percent), [putting Iran
in eighth place in the Middle East in terms of defense spending as a
percentage of gdp. Iran's spending lags in absolute terms, as
well]{.underline}. In 2016, for example, Saudi Arabia spent \$63.7
billion on defense, five times Iran's \$12.7 billion."75 As Anthony
Cordesman notes, "**[Trends sharply favor Arab states even if U.S. and
European spending on power projection is ignored]{.underline}**."76
[Israel, too, is more than capable of deterring any Iranian aggression,
with a secure second strike nuclear capability and a demonstrated
capacity to align and bargain with Arab states]{.underline}. As things
stand, [Iran's efforts to extend its presence and influence have
provoked **counter-balancing** by informal Saudi-Israel
coalition]{.underline}. [There is **no realistic possibility** in the
decades ahead of a successful Iranian bid for hegemony.]{.underline}

Should an external power make a bid for hegemony in the region, the long
and difficult U.S. experience after experiments with a number of
different methods suggests that the new interloper would be taking on a
world of trouble, that would divert resources and distract its
attention, attract increased hostility, and entangle it in the intrigues
of the region, to the extent that the United States' relative position
elsewhere would be bolstered.

That in itself would not necessarily stop Iran trying, and withdrawal
could result in even more increased interstate competition than is
already happening under the current dispensation. [In an
**emergency**]{.underline}, though, [US military presence]{.underline}
on the ground [could **increase** rather than negate oil-related
instability]{.underline}. It would not necessarily be a stabilising move
to station troops in the land of Mecca, in extremis, in the event of a
war or civil uprising. Short of fears of Iranian conquest, the kinds of
[nightmare scenarios that primacy rationales envisage, such as a
blockade of the Straits of Hormuz or the seizure of oil facilities, can
be **readily reversed** with the swift application of seaborne
airpower.]{.underline}

### Heg Bad -- AT: Oil 

#### US security guarantees [empirically fail]{.underline} to shape Saudi/OPEC oil decisions -- but [no impact]{.underline}

From the other side of the equation, while Washington has some
influence, [U.S. presence has]{.underline} demonstrably often [not
resulted in the levels of price stability that Washington
desires]{.underline}. [There is a history of Saudi Arabia **rebuffing
U.S. preferences** on price]{.underline}.71 To return to a theme, [Saudi
Arabia and OPEC members have **consistently disobeyed** U.S. and OPEC
demands]{.underline} -- and OPEC's own targets- [on oil
production]{.underline}. [They have cheated on their production targets
**96% of the time**,]{.underline} according to one study.72
[OPEC]{.underline}, despite claims otherwise, [exerts little constraint
as a "cartel" on its members' actual production]{.underline}. [The main
drivers of oil price lie elsewhere]{.underline}. "Most of the credit or
blame for rising oil prices in recent years rests with Asian
customers."73 [Saudi Arabia individually does have capacity to influence
supply levels]{.underline}. Yet **[despite increased security
ties]{.underline}** [with the U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates,
[the Kingdom has explicitly threatened to punish its patron with
decreased production and increased rises, in retaliation to U.S.
sanctions]{.underline} over the Khashoggi disappearance.74 [This open
threat]{.underline}, alongside the many other Saudi activities that
violate U.S. interests, [demonstrates the limits on]{.underline} the
[U.S. coercive leverage]{.underline} that military presence supposedly
buys. To persist with this set of arrangements invites humiliation. Is
it worth it?

#### No oil shocks -- multiple checks and alliances irrelevant 

**Porter 18** (Patrick Porter is the Chair of Strategic Studies at the

Oil and the Balance of Power

What about the oil? In relation to the oil question, what about the
prospect of an altered (and worse) balance of power in the even of a
U.S. departure? The U.S. still has an interest in Gulf oil, though that
resource and the interest are gradually declining. Direct reliance on
Middle Eastern oil imports is falling. Moreover, [the linkage between
military presence and the interest in oil price is not obvious. Oil is a
fungible commodity, not a resource to be "controlled." Access to
oil]{.underline}, then, [is not determined by being the dominant power
in the Middle East]{.underline}.67 Rather, the argument is about
indirect effects. The U.S. remains subject to changes in price that
result from any alteration in global supply and demand, and which in
theory could be effected by a hostile hegemon manipulating supply.
[There are more **efficient** and **cost effective** ways to secure
those interests than alliances and military presence.]{.underline}68
[The oil market itself is changing and becoming more resilient. Western
economic exposure to Gulf oil shocks is reduced, thanks to increases in
efficiency, and with North American shale and gas
developing]{.underline}.

These include [the use of spare capacity and strategic petroleum
reserves]{.underline} to [**moderate supply shocks**.]{.underline} [The
U.S. already has adaptive mechanisms, **apart from security guarantees
and bases**, that it can use to mitigate disruptions]{.underline}.
Indeed, [in every oil shock since]{.underline} 19[73, these mechanisms
have been used, increasing production from other sources, the
redistributing capacity of the I]{.underline}nternational
[E]{.underline}nergy [A]{.underline}gency, [rerouting shipping transport
and calling on public and private inventories]{.underline}.69 [Further
developments]{.underline} [also create increased
**resilience**]{.underline}, [such as the development of spot and
futures markets that enable consumers to hedge risks, as opposed to the
reliance on longterm contracts]{.underline}. [Even the]{.underline}
severe 19[73 oil embargo crisis was created not primarily by the drop in
production, which only fell]{.underline} by 2-4%, but [by]{.underline}
the [Nixon]{.underline} administration['s]{.underline} imposition of
[price controls]{.underline}.

One point of division between primacy and restraint realists is the
estimate of the severity of disruption. Primacy realists tend to accept
a priori the assumption that the world is so globalised and
interdependent that the U.S. is dangerously vulnerable, to the extent
that the burden of proof lies firmly on the argument for retrenchment.
Restraint realists, by contrast, argue that the globalisation thesis
overstates such vulnerability. [**Even large-scale disruptions** to oil
markets]{.underline} -- for instance the Iran-Iraq war of the 1980's -
[historically lead to **rapid adaptation** by third
parties]{.underline}.70

### Heg Bad -- AT: Prolif 

#### Heg doesn't solve, makes Iran/Saudi prolif inevitable 

**Porter 18** (Patrick Porter is the Chair of Strategic Studies at the
University of Exeter, Academic Director of Strategy and Security
Institute and Senior Associate Fellow at RUSI, PhD in history from
Oxford, "Desert Shield of the Republic? Realism and the Middle East,"

Two major aberrations confront this argument. As we have seen, Israel
disobeyed U.S. demands that it refrain from crossing the threshold.
Secondly, [U.S. and allied hostility is a **major driver** of
Iran]{.underline}ian nuclear [prolif]{.underline}eration, [whether
latent or full-blown.]{.underline} [Sanctions, threats and
negotiations]{.underline} may have made possible the JCPOA with Iran,
but as with terrorism, this [was action to suppress **a threat that
forward presence helped create**]{.underline}. Furthermore, [recent
scholarship]{.underline}77 [suggests that U.S. guarantees are
not]{.underline} necessarily [a decisive inhibitor, and it is not clear
that distancing would make a great difference]{.underline}. [Even after
withdrawing, the U.S. would still have access to a range of tools to
inhibit prolif]{.underline}eration, [with sanctions, economic carrots
and sticks, and threats of force]{.underline}. Furthermore, a common
objection to abandonment would be increased Russian or Chinese
encroachment. If so, [prolif]{.underline}eration activity [would likely
attract]{.underline} their \[[Russian, Chinese\] attention, and
preventive efforts]{.underline}.

The cure of putting up with all else in order to constrain proliferation
may be worse than the disease. As the work of Nuno Monteiro and
Alexandre Debs demonstrate, **[a mere security commitment is not enough
to prevent prolif]{.underline}**eration.78 The weaker ally must be
confident enough that the ally would not abandon it. Alternatively,
threats of abandonment could work but would have to be credible. [The
kinds of commitments that are needed to reassure Riyadh enough to
prevent it proliferating would need to be even stronger than
Washington's current relationship, to the point of tolerating
all]{.underline} of the [pernicious behaviours]{.underline} above. That
very tolerance would then strain the credibility of threats to withdraw.
[That existing commitments are not enough is demonstrated by the fact
that Saudi Arabia is already accelerate its civilian nuclear development
as a hedge to possible Iranian nuclearization]{.underline}.79

Alternatively, an unmistakable threat of withdrawal would be needed to
coerce client states away from proliferation. But Washington would have
to mean it to make it credible, precisely the real threat of
unreliability that primacists warn against in their enthusiasm for
steadfast alliance commitment. This is not the equivalent of iron-clad
commitments to more stable, responsible allies like West Germany or
Japan. It is rather an iron-clad commitment to a regime whose interests
-- as it defines and pursues them -- are sharply at odds with America's.

Possible proliferation is important but not all-important. It is
conceded that abandonment would raise the odds of increased interstate
competition, thereby raising the odds of reactive proliferation
attempts, even while [abandonment and counter-prolif]{.underline}eration
[are **not**]{.underline} necessarily **[mutually
exclusive]{.underline}**. If so, [the question is whether staying put in
order to lower the probability of prolif]{.underline}eration further [is
worth the considerable costs]{.underline} that the United States pays,
up front and in the course [of staying]{.underline}. The verdict here is
negative. If it comes down to it, a more nuclearized Middle East would
be a reality Washington and probably the regional states could learn to
live with, as with Central Asia, another nuclearized region that
hegemonic efforts failed to avert. Indeed, there is every possibility of
proliferation under **[U.S. hegemony]{.underline}**, a phenomenon we
have seen before, as opposed to proliferation as a consequence of
withdrawal. If anything, [arguments for prolif]{.underline}eration [in
Tehran will]{.underline} now [be **stronger** rather than
weaker]{.underline}, given the abrogation of the JCPOA, an agreement
that was coerced out of Iran at significant costs and concessions.
[America's willingness to topple regimes]{.underline} that have either
disarmed or not acquired a nuclear weapon, along with the [dumping of
this nuclear agreement, and mounting hostility will all tilt the
debate]{.underline} at least [towards latent if not actual
prolif]{.underline}eration. [If so, it is not hard to imagine Saudi
Arabia **doubting U.S. guarantees**,]{.underline} [and seeking insurance
in its own nuclear deterrent]{.underline}, possibly from a Sunni donor
state like Pakistan.

Finally, [[MbS is the principal architect]{.underline}]{.mark}, along
with UAE, [[of the]{.mark} disastrous [attack on
Yemen]{.mark}.]{.underline} [The latter has suffered through almost
continual civil war and violent strife for a half century.]{.underline}
At one point Egyptian and Saudi soldiers intervened on opposite sides.
In 2014 the long-time obstreperous Houthis, religiously Zaydis borrowing
from both Shiites and Sunnis, joined with their former antagonist,
recently ousted President Ali Abdallah Saleh, to defenestrate his
successor, Abdrabbuh Mansur Hadi. [Iran played only a minimal role in
the Yemeni saga. However, the Saudis desired to ensure a puppet
government in Sanaa and intervened on Hadi's behalf.]{.underline} Since
then Riyadh and Abu Dhabi have diverged in their aims, with UAE
abandoning Hadi and promoting separatism in what had once been the
nation of South Yemen. [[The Obama admin]{.mark}istration intervened to
[back the KSA, providing munitions, aerial refueling and targeting
assistance.]{.mark} [The conflict has been a human horror]{.mark}.
Humanitarian groups figure the [Saudi]{.mark}-led coalition [is
responsible for at least three-quarters of the civilian deaths]{.mark},
which [top ten thousand]{.mark}. [Riyadh]{.mark}]{.underline} and Abu
Dhabi [have destroyed Yemen's health care system, [triggered a cholera
epidemic, and created widespread malnutrition and starvation]{.mark}. As
a public-relations exercise the Kingdom offered "aid" to the country
that it systematically destroyed.]{.underline} Again, MbS's policy
backfired. Tehran offered modest support to the Houthis, bleeding Saudi
Arabia, which discovered that tens of billions of dollars in
sophisticated weapons do not a competent military make. Observed Peter
Salisbury of London's Chatham House, "The Yemen war was meant to be a
demonstration of Saudi Arabia's ability to push back against Iran's role
in the region. The opposite has happened though." [The KSA's
international reputation suffered as it murdered helpless civilians for
no serious geopolitical purpose. [Why does Washington continue to
embrace the Saudi royals?]{.mark} Its relationship with the KSA is
embarrassing, counterproductive and unnecessary.]{.underline} America is
moving ahead of Saudi Arabia in oil production. New sources elsewhere
have reduced the Kingdom's once dominant role as a supplier. Israel and
the Gulf States easily can constrain Iran without U.S. backing. That
doesn't mean the United States should treat Riyadh as an enemy. Rather,
[Americans should deal with the Kingdom when convenient, without the
pretense of friendship. [Washington should freely criticize]{.mark} what
is one of [the world's most repressive regimes, applying the same
standards]{.mark} to the Kingdom [as to Iran]{.mark}, for
instance.]{.underline} Noted Sarah Leah Whitson of Human Rights Watch:
"[Mohammed bin Salman's well-funded image as a reformist falls flat in
the face of Yemen's humanitarian catastrophe and scores of activists and
political dissidents languishing Saudi prisons on spurious
charges.]{.underline}" [[U.S. policy should reflect the fact that MbS is
impulsive, reckless and authoritarian,]{.mark} despite his willingness
to liberalize Saudi social life. If he is serious about reform, then his
agenda must include]{.underline} allowing greater freedom of expression
and religious worship by non-Muslims, advancing the rule of law over
that of men, and [restraining international adventurism. Until then, the
KSA will be as much foe as friend of American principles and
interests.]{.underline}

[The bad is really bad: domestic political and religious
repression.]{.underline} Human-rights groups consistently find the
Kingdom of Saudi Arabia to be one of the world's most oppressive
nations. For instance, Freedom House rates [[the
KSA]{.underline}]{.mark} unfree. [The Kingdom, reported Freedom House,
"[restricts]{.mark} almost all [political rights]{.mark} and [civil
liberties through]{.mark} a combination of [oppressive laws]{.mark} and
the use of [force]{.mark}." The rulers "rely on [extensive
surveillance]{.mark}, the [criminalization of dissent]{.mark}, appeals
to [sectarianism]{.mark}, and public spending supported by oil revenues
to maintain power."]{.underline} Amnesty International came to a similar
conclusion: "[The authorities severely restricted freedoms of
expression, association and assembly. Many [human-rights
defenders]{.mark} and critics [were detained]{.mark} and some were
[sentenced to lengthy prison terms after unfair trials]{.mark}. Several
Shia [activists]{.mark} were [executed]{.mark}, and many more were
sentenced to death following grossly unfair trials." [AI]{.mark} went on
to [report torture]{.mark}, other [ill-treatment, sexual
violence]{.mark}, and more against those held.]{.underline} The State
Department's fifty-seven-page human-rights report cited ["citizen's lack
of the ability and legal means to choose their government; restrictions
on universal rights, such as freedom of expression, including on the
internet, and the freedoms of assembly, association, movement, and
religion; and [pervasive gender discrimination]{.mark} [and lack of
equal rights]{.mark} that affected most aspects of women's
lives."]{.underline} There was no judicial independence or due process.
There was "[arbitrary interference with privacy, home and
correspondence,"]{.underline} and much more. Those who oppose the regime
feel the lash. [In January 2016 [the KSA executed twenty-seven
Shia]{.mark}, mostly protesters against Sunni tyranny in 2011. Among
them was the noted cleric Sheikh Nimr al-Nimr,]{.underline} who backed
the demonstrators. All were convicted of "terrorist" offenses, meaning
opposing the absolute Sunni monarchy. Imams, columnists and bloggers
were arrested last year for simply saying nothing, that is, failing to
back the regime's attack on Qatar. [Another noted victim is Raif Badawi,
[a dissident blogger]{.mark} who criticized religious repression and
mistreatment of women, who in 2014 [was sentenced to ten years]{.mark}
imprisonment [and one thousand lashes]{.mark}]{.underline}. His lawyer
subsequently was sentenced to fifteen years, while his wife fled to
Canada. The list of victims continues to lengthen on MbS's watch. For
instance, [in January the [founders of the Union for Human
Rights,]{.mark} Abdullah al-Attawi and Mohammed al-Otaibi, [were
sentenced to seven years and fourteen years]{.mark}, respectively, in
prison]{.underline}. More broadly, reported Human Rights Watch, last
year "[Saudi authorities continued their arbitrary arrests, trials, and
convictions of peaceful dissidents. Dozens of human-rights defenders
amid activists continued to serve long prison sentences for criticizing
authorities or advocating political and rights reforms.]{.underline}
Authorities continued to discriminate against women and religious
minorities." In December Amnesty International observed that "in the
months since the Crown Prince's appointment, we have seen little to
believe that his overtures are anything more than a slick PR exercise.
In fact, the dire rights record in the country has far from improved.
Witness the ongoing wave of arrest targeting journalists, critics and
religious scholars. [Virtually all the country's prominent civil society
activities and human rights defenders, including many who had been vocal
on corruption, are currently behind bars]{.underline}. Just like his
predecessors, the [[Crown Prince]{.mark} seems [determined to crush the
Kingdom's h]{.mark}uman [ri]{.mark}ghts [movement."]{.mark}]{.underline}

not clear how that will be achieved unless [things are allowed to
slide]{.mark} and it\'s accepted that there will be some fall guys that
the Saudis will blame.\"]{.underline} Trump underlined the economic
relationship when he said on Saturday that if the Saudis \"don't buy it
from us, they're going to buy it from Russia or they're going to buy it
from China,\" referring to an arms deal he helped broker. \"Think of
that, \$110 billion. All they're going to do is give it to other
countries, and I think that would be very foolish." Oil has also linked
the two countries since before World War II, when America oil companies
helped the kingdom develop the sector. [The relationship between the
United States and Saudi Arabia has always been likened to a marriage of
convenience: the [U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates [provides
security]{.mark} in return [for Saudi Arabia]{.mark}, the world\'s
largest oil exporter, ensuring affordable oil supplies for the global
economy.]{.underline} With U.S. sanctions on Iran, a fellow oil exporter
and fierce Saudi regional rival, set to deepen in November, the Trump
administration was planning to rely on Riyadh to make up for the
shortfall. [When [Trump]{.mark} came to power he [focused on Saudi
Arabia]{.mark} [and]{.mark} [made the [kingdom his first visit overseas
as
president](https://www.nbcnews.com/slideshow/president-trump-s-royal-saudi-welcome-n762616)]{.mark}.]{.underline}
At the time, White House officials told reporters that Saudi leaders
would help drive a Palestinian-Israeli peace deal, as well as develop a
long-term plan to cut Islamic State funding and get those in the region
to contribute more to the fight. In spite of the ties, [U.S. lawmakers

that the crown prince had Khashoogi \"murdered\" in the Saudi consulate
in Istanbul and that he has \"tainted\" his country as a result. Graham
added that the crown prince \"has got to go\" and that he now plans to
\"sanction the hell out of Saudi Arabia.\"]{.underline} The Senate's
foreign policy lawmakers have signaled bipartisan support for punishing
the Saudis with sanctions. Last week, more than 20 senators triggered
the Global Magnitsky Human Rights Accountability Act, which prohibits
extrajudicial killings, torture and other egregious rights violations.
Under the law, Trump must report within 120 days as to whether gross
rights violations have occurred, and if so, who in Saudi Arabia should
be held responsible and targeted with sanctions. Even before Khashoggi's
case, lawmakers expressed increasing frustration with Saudi Arabia,
condemning Riyadh over its military campaign in Yemen that has claimed
thousands of civilian lives and helped cause a humanitarian catastrophe.
Congress has only narrowly approved recent arms sales to Saudi Arabia
and has demanded the Trump administration certify whether the Saudi-led
coalition is abiding by the laws of war in Yemen. [For all the hostility
directed at the Saudis, however, [lawmakers are reluctant to
back]{.mark} drastic [steps that could jettison the]{.mark} longstanding
[partnership with the kingdom]{.mark}, according two Senate staffers,

identified because they were not authorized to speak on the record.
[Instead, [Congress wants to]{.mark} see punishment meted out while
[preserv]{.mark}ing [the strategic alliance]{.mark}, and the Trump
administration appears to be pushing in that direction]{.underline}, the
staffers said. [[Asked about]{.mark} the possibility of
[sanctions]{.mark} on specific sectors of the Saudi economy, or those
that target major Saudi state companies, [the Democratic staffer told
NBC News:]{.mark} "It's [too early]{.mark} for that."]{.underline} [The
two economies have an array of connections and "[we have to make sure we
don't shoot ourselves in the foot]{.mark}."]{.underline} There is also

[[Prince Mohammed]{.underline}]{.mark} is likely to weather the crisis
over the killing of Khashoggi, a Washington Post columnist critical of
the de-facto ruler, and could rule Saudi Arabia for the next half
century. [The kingdom [appears emboldened by Trump\'s support]{.mark}.
Its top diplomat said the fate of the crown prince is a \"red line\" and
that [calls for him to be held accountable would not be
tolerated]{.mark}.]{.underline} \"In Saudi Arabia our leadership is a
red line,\" Foreign Minister Adel al-Jubeir told the BBC. [\"We will not

peppered with heart emojis. [\"[There\'s a feeling]{.mark} that we can

Riyadh told AFP]{.underline} following Trump\'s statement. Shrugging off
the global pressure, Prince Mohammed is expected to attend the Group of
20 summit this month, raising the electrifying prospect of face-to-face
encounters with world leaders who have strongly condemned the murder.
[\"I think in some ways this typifies [the crown prince\'s
approach]{.mark}, which [is\... to say \'no, we\'re going to double

orders for Khashoggi\'s killing came from \"the highest levels\" of the
Saudi government, appears unlikely to follow Trump\'s lead. The same for
the CIA. In leaking its assessment that Prince Mohammed authorised the
murder, the CIA showed it was willing to \"take on Trump\", said James
Dorsey, a fellow at Singapore\'s S. Rajaratnam School of International
Studies. The move also suggested \"the agency does not believe Prince
Mohammed\'s survival as king-in-waiting is crucial to US national
security or the stability of the kingdom,\" he added.

### War Unwinnable 

#### The Yemen war is militarily unwinnable for either side, and will continue for eternity as civilians are slaughtered.

What They Must." Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, 4/10/19,
https://carnegieendownment.org/sada/78838).

[Already the poorest Arab state, Yemen has been facing nothing but more
destruction and starvation since the Saudi-led coalition's military
intervention began in 2015 following the takeover of Sanaa by the
Houthi-Saleh alliance in 2014.]{.underline} Between Saudi Arabia's
disastrous strategies, the UAE's divergent hidden agenda, and Houthis'
aggression, [[civilians in Yemen are paying the]{.mark} heaviest [price
of an unwinnable war]{.mark}.]{.underline} [The fact that [Houthis are
neither outsiders nor easy to identify, as well as the]{.mark} rough
[nature of Yemen's geography make]{.mark} this [war impossible for
either side to win militarily]{.mark}.]{.underline} After about four
years of world leaders' apathy over the atrocities in Yemen, at the end
of 2018 the international community truly pressured the warring parties
to come and sit at the table for the first peace talks in two years.
[The tragic killing of Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi represented a
tipping point in the drive toward [peace]{.mark} talks. The result was a
moment of hope that there could be an end in sight to the war. As the
weeks passed however, it became clear that the [talks]{.mark} were [a
result of international will]{.mark} but [not]{.mark} necessarily a
[local or]{.mark} a [regional one. Hope]{.mark} slowly
[vanished.]{.mark}]{.underline} It might take another major event with
an international echo to bring that hope back. [Contemplating the fourth
year of the [war]{.mark} in Yemen and the question of what [has]{.mark}
been [achieved]{.mark} so far, I am at a loss in finding anything but
further [fragmentation and destruction]{.mark} of an already enfeebled
state of Yemen.]{.underline} The Saudi attempt to restore the presidency
of Abed Rabbo Mansour Hadi has only increased the possibility of [a
[permanent division of Yemen]{.underline}]{.mark}. Saudi Arabia's fight
against the Houthis has also involved the unnecessary bombing of
historical sites across Yemen. And the UAE, Saudi Arabia's partner, now
occupies Yemen's remote island of Socotra and controls UAE-funded
militias and armed groups in south of Yemen outside the control of the
Yemeni government. It is unsettling how these two rich monarchies are
doing such damage to world's poorest Arab country. Being caught between
these warring parties is a hell Yemenis must deal with. Our ordeal is
summed up in Thucydides' saying: "the strong do what they can, and the
weak suffer what they must."

### War Unwinnable, Diplomacy Key 

#### Now that the UAE has withdrawn, the only way to end the war is through negotiations. Fighting is no longer an option.

From Yemen in Blow to Saudi War Effort." The New York Times, 7/11/19,

[For four years[, the **U**]{.mark}nited **[A]{.mark}**rab
**[E]{.mark}**mirates [have been the military linchpin of]{.mark} the
[Saudi-]{.mark}led [war in Yemen]{.mark}, providing weapons, money and
thousands of ground troops to a campaign to drive out Yemen's Houthi
rebels. [Emirati forces led]{.mark} almost [every]{.mark} major [advance
the coalition]{.mark} [made]{.mark}. Now they have decided [they can go
no further]{.mark}. The Emiratis are withdrawing their forces at a scale
and speed [that]{.mark} all but [rules out]{.mark} [further]{.mark}
ground [advances,]{.mark} a belated recognition that a grinding war that
has killed thousands of civilians and turned [Yemen]{.mark} into a
humanitarian disaster [is **no longer winnable**]{.mark}.]{.underline}
Emirati officials have been saying for several weeks that they have
begun a phased and partial withdrawal of forces estimated at 5,000
troops a few years ago. But Western and Arab diplomats briefed on the
drawdown say a significant reduction has already occurred, and that the
Emiratis are driven mostly by their desire to exit a war whose cost has
become too high, even if it means angering their Saudi allies. [In the
past month, the Emiratis have cut their deployment around Hudaydah, the
Red Sea port that was the war's main battleground last year, by 80
percent to fewer than 150 men, according to four people briefed on the
drawdown. They have pulled out their attack helicopters and heavy guns,
effectively precluding a military advance on the city. A senior Emirati
official, speaking on the condition of anonymity in accordance with his
[government's policy]{.mark}, said the drawdown was [intended to support
a]{.mark} shaky [U]{.mark}nited [N]{.mark}ations-brokered
[cease-fire]{.mark} in Hudaydah that came into effect in December. "Our
commitment to Yemen remains," the official said, adding that Emirati
forces have trained 90,000 Yemeni soldiers to fill the [vacuum]{.mark}
after their departure.]{.underline} Saudi Arabia and the United Arab
Emirates intervened in Yemen in 2015 to roll back an attempted takeover
by the Houthis, a faction supported by Iran, and to restore Yemen's
fragile, internationally recognized government. The war, the signature
initiative of Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman and backed by the United
States, would be over in a matter of months, they said. Four years
later, [the war has failed to oust the Houthis and turned Yemen into
what the United Nations has called the world's worst humanitarian
crisis. Mike Hindmarsh, a retired Australian major general who commands
the Emirati presidential guard, recently told Western visitors that
[Yemen]{.mark} had become [a quagmire where the Houthis were the "Yemeni
Viet Cong]{.mark}." The drawdown "is going to expose the Saudis to the
reality that [this war is a failure]{.mark},"]{.underline} said Michael
Stephens of the Royal United Services Institute, a research group in
London. "It tells us the two main protagonists on the coalition side,
Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates, don't have the same idea of
what success looks like." Diplomats said the Saudis were deeply
disappointed by the Emirati decision. Top officials with the royal court
personally intervened with the Emirati leaders to try to dissuade them
from the drawdown, said a Western diplomat familiar with the matter.
Several people briefed by the Emiratis said that they have avoided
announcing their decision publicly in part to minimize the unhappiness
of the Saudis. But an official in the Saudi embassy in Washington denied
that the kingdom's leaders were "unhappy." The leaders of the two
countries "remain strategically aligned on the goals for Yemen," the
official said, speaking on condition of anonymity according to Saudi
rules. "Tactical or operational changes during campaigns are natural and
are done in coordination with the coalition," the official said, adding
that any void left by the Emirati drawdown would be filled by Yemeni
forces who had been trained to stand on their own[. Emirati officials
stress that they are not leaving Yemen entirely. A counterterrorism
mission focused on hunting Al Qaeda militants, a core American concern
in Yemen, remains untouched.]{.underline} The Emiratis will maintain a
reduced presence in Aden, the main city in the south, and will continue
to support a coalition of about 16 Yemeni militias, estimated to number
about 20,000 men, who have been doing most of the fighting along the Red
Sea coast in the Hudaydah area. But command of the fractious Yemeni
forces is passing to Saudi Arabia. A senior Yemeni official said
Thursday that Saudi officers had taken charge at the two main Emirati
bases on the Red Sea, at Mokha and Khokha. Emirati officials say they
will continue to support a coalition of about 16 Yemeni militias,

coalition of about 16 Yemeni militias, estimated to number about 20,000
men. Emirati officials say they will continue to support a coalition of
about 16 Yemeni militias, estimated to number about 20,000 men. The
Saudis have little experience on that front, and the sudden changes have
stoked fears that without the heavily armed Emiratis to keep the peace,
the Yemenis could start to feud among themselves. "The only thing
stopping the Houthis from taking over Yemen was the U.A.E. armed
forces," said Michael Knights, a senior fellow at the Washington
Institute. "Now the glue that was holding Yemen together is being
withdrawn." The drawdown could prompt the Houthis to take advantage of
the vacuum and launch new attempts to capture ground they lost to the
Emirati-led battle group last year. Fighting has already surged in
several strategic towns on the plains south of Hudaydah, threatening
supply lines to Saudi-led forces positioned around the city. Aid
officials warn the fighting could deepen an already grave humanitarian
situation in those areas, threatening a fresh spike in disease and
malnutrition levels in a country that has been threatened with famine
for the past year. The Saudis and Emiratis have endured growing
international criticism for the consequences of their air campaign,
which has killed about 8,000 civilians, according to the Armed Conflict
Location & Event Data Project, and for policies of economic warfare that
have constricted the food supply in much of the Houthi-controlled north.
The Houthis have also been accused of contributing to the problem by
diverting or manipulating international aid. As pressure has mounted,
Saudi and Emirati interests in Yemen have openly diverged. The Emiratis
have largely achieved their objective of protecting shipping routes in
the Gulf of Aden and elsewhere around Yemen. The Saudis, however, have
become bogged down in protecting their long border with Yemen. Since the
fighting began in 2015, the Houthis have continually harassed Saudi
Arabia with missiles, drones and other incursions into Saudi territory,
raising the stakes for Riyadh. The Houthis have recently fired missiles
at Saudi airports in retaliation for the Saudi blockade of airport in
Sana, the Houthi-controlled capital. In June, a missile hit the arrivals
terminal of an airport in Abha, Saudi Arabia, wounding 26 people. Last
year the Emiratis led a sweeping military advance up the Red Sea Coast
to the outskirts of Hudaydah, the main channel for food imports to
Yemen. But the drive was halted by Houthi resistance and an
international outcry over fears that Hudaydah could be cut off,
endangering food supplies to millions of Yemenis threatened by famine.
American support for the Saudi-led coalition, including intelligence and
logistical support as well as the sale of planes and bombs, has grown
increasingly controversial in the United States as the war's civilian
toll has mounted. In the United States, opposition to the war mushroomed
after Saudi agents killed the dissident journalist Jamal Khashoggi last
fall. Congress passed a bipartisan resolution to end American
involvement, but it was vetoed by President Trump, a strong supporter of
the Saudi crown prince[. Despite its role in the war, [Pentagon]{.mark}
leaders have for years [warned]{.mark} that [military victory is not
possible]{.mark}, urging the Saudi-led coalition to negotiate a
political settlement.]{.underline} American officials who encouraged the
Emiratis to withdraw from Hudaydah included former Defense Secretary Jim
Mattis, former Secretary of State John Kerry, and Senator Lindsey
Graham, Republican of South Carolina. [The Emiratis "have simply tired
of the stalemate and dim prospects for victory on the
battlefield,]{.underline}" said one American official, who spoke on
condition of anonymity to discuss internal government assessments. The
Saudis, though, may still believe in a military victory. "There are
voices in Riyadh who think the Houthis can be caused enough pain to do
what Saudi Arabia wants," said Peter Salisbury of the International
Crisis Group. "But that feels like wishful thinking, which is not a good
substitute for strategy." There are signs though that recent tensions
with Iran are shifting Saudi calculations. The prospect of a conflict
with Iran while fighting a rear-guard action against Houthi missiles
coming across Saudi Arabia's southern border may have persuaded Saudis
to reach for peace with the Houthis, according to a Western official who
has met with the Saudis. The Saudi official said that the kingdom's
goals had always been "a political solution to the conflict, one that
will provide a sustainable peace and stability." The military objective,
the official said, was "to pressure the Houthi militia to return to the
negotiating table." But Yemen's government, currently based in the
southern city of Aden, may be less interested in reaching a peaceful
settlement. And in a conflict closely tied to Prince Mohammed's legacy,
any political settlement would require finding a means of saving face
for both sides[. "The **[best way to end the war is for both sides to
break bread]{.mark}**," said Mr. Salisbury. "But the cost of ending the
war might be too high for the Saudis, in terms of saving face. And it
could be blocked by the government of Yemen."]{.underline}

[[Under the leadership]{.mark} of Crown Prince [M]{.mark}ohammed
[b]{.mark}in [S]{.mark}alman, [the Saudi-led
coalition]{.mark}]{.underline} and its Yemeni allies have [i[mposed a
raft of punitive economic measures aimed at]{.mark} undercutting the
[Houthi rebels]{.mark}]{.underline} who control northern Yemen. [[But
these actions]{.mark} --- including periodic blockades, stringent import
restrictions and withholding the salaries of about a million civil
servants --- have [landed on the backs of civilians]{.mark}, [laying the
economy to waste]{.mark} and [driving millions deeper into
poverty]{.mark}]{.underline}[.]{.mark} Those measures have inflicted a
slow-burn toll[: [infrastructure destroyed]{.mark}, [jobs lost]{.mark},
a [weakening currency]{.mark} [and soaring prices]{.mark}]{.underline}.
But in recent weeks the economic collapse has gathered pace at alarming
speed, [causing]{.mark} top United Nations [[officials to revise their
predictions of famine]{.underline}]{.mark}. "There is now a clear and
present danger of an imminent and great, big famine engulfing Yemen,"
Mark Lowcock, the under secretary for humanitarian affairs, told the
Security Council on Tuesday. [[Eight million Yemenis]{.mark} already
depend [on emergency food aid]{.mark} to survive, he said, [a figure
that could]{.mark} soon [rise to 14 million]{.mark}]{.underline}, or
half Yemen's population. "People think famine is just a lack of food,"
said Alex de Waal, author of "Mass Starvation" which analyzes recent
man-made famines. "But in Yemen it's about a war on the economy." [[Ali
al-Hajaji and his wife, Mohamediah Mohammed, lost one son to hunger. Now
they]{.mark} fear losing a second.]{.underline} When Shaher became ill,
[Mr. Hajaji [tried a folk remedy and burned him]{.mark}]{.underline},
leaving scars on his chest. Shaadi, 4 years old, lies in a grave marked
by a single broken rock. The signs are everywhere, cutting across
boundaries of class, tribe and region. [[Unpaid]{.mark}

[appeals]{.mark} for help [on]{.mark} [s]{.mark}ocial

their gold, land or cars to feed their families. On the streets of the
capital, Sana, an elderly woman begs for alms with a loudspeaker. "Help
me," the woman, Zahra Bajali, calls out. "I have a sick husband. I have
a house for rent. Help." And in the hushed hunger wards, ailing infants
hover between life and death. [Of nearly [two million malnourished
children in]{.mark} [Yemen, 400,000]{.mark} are [considered critically
ill]{.mark} --- a figure projected to rise by one quarter in the coming
months]{.underline}. "We are being crushed," said Dr. Mekkia Mahdi at
the health clinic in Aslam, an impoverished northwestern town that has
been swamped with refugees fleeing the fighting in Hudaydah, an
embattled port city 90 miles to the south. Flitting between the beds at
her spartan clinic, she cajoled mothers, dispensed orders to medics and
spoon-fed milk to sickly infants. For some it was too late: the night
before, an 11-month old boy had died. He weighed five and a half pounds.
Looking around her, Dr. Mahdi could not fathom the Western obsession
with the Saudi killing of Jamal Khashoggi in Istanbul. "[We're surprised
the Khashoggi case is getting so much attention while millions of Yemeni
children are suffering]{.underline}," she said. "[Nobody gives a damn
about them]{.underline}." She tugged on the flaccid skin of a drowsy
7-year-old girl with stick-like arms. "Look," she said. "No meat. Only
bones." [The embassy of Saudi Arabia in Washington did not respond to
questions about the country's policies in Yemen]{.underline}. But Saudi
officials have defended their actions, citing rockets fired across their
border by the Houthis, an armed group professing Zaidi Islam, an
offshoot of Shiism, that Saudi Arabia, a Sunni monarchy, views as a
proxy for its regional rival, Iran. The Saudis point out that they,
along with the United Arab Emirates, are among the most generous donors
to Yemen's humanitarian relief effort. Last spring, the two allies
pledged \$1 billion in aid to Yemen. In January, [[Saudi Arabia]{.mark}
deposited \$2 billion in Yemen's central bank to prop up its currency.
But those efforts have been overshadowed by the [coalition's]{.mark}
[attacks on Yemen's economy]{.mark}, including [the denial of salaries
to civil servants]{.mark}, a partial blockade that has driven up food
prices, [and the printing]{.mark} [of]{.mark} vast amounts of [bank
notes]{.mark}, which [caused the currency to plunge]{.mark}. And the
[offensive to capture Hudaydah,]{.mark} which started in]{.underline}
[June, has [endangered the main lifeline for imports to northern]{.mark}
[Yemen]{.mark}, [displaced 570,000 ]{.mark}]{.underline}[people]{.mark}
and edged many more closer to starvation. A famine here, Mr. Lowcock
warned, would be "much bigger than anything any professional in this
field has seen during their working lives." [Last year a [young woman
died of cholera]{.mark}, part of [an]{.mark} [epidemic that infected 1.1

airstrike]{.underline}. Bassam Mohammed Hassan, who suffers from severe

its coalition of mainly Sunni Muslim nations. [[The U.S]{.mark}. and
U.K. [support the coalition with weapons sales and logistical
help]{.mark}.]{.underline} Its leaders say [they feared that Houthi
control of Yemen would give Iran a foothold in the Arabian peninsula
that would threaten Saudi interests]{.underline}. Iran and Saudi Arabia
are engaged in a larger battle for dominance in the Arab world. The
recorded [[civilian death]{.mark} toll from fighting was
estimated]{.underline} in August [at [about 7,000]{.mark},
[although]{.mark} UN [officials believe the]{.mark} actual [number is
substantially higher]{.mark}]{.underline}. Most [casualties have been
the result of coalition air strikes]{.underline}, according to the Aug.
28 report of investigators commissioned by the UN Human Rights Council.
The panel reviewed [[coalition air strikes]{.mark}]{.underline} that
[[hit residential areas in 60 cases]{.mark};
[marketplaces]{.mark}]{.underline} [[in 11]{.underline}]{.mark} cases;
[[civilian boats in 11]{.mark}]{.underline} cases; [[and medical,
educational, cultural or religious sites in 32]{.underline}]{.mark}
cases. It said [such strikes]{.underline} may [amount to war
crimes]{.underline}. The investigators said they gathered reports of
shelling into civilian areas by Houthi forces that required further
investigation. According to the UN's Food and Agriculture Organization,
as many as [[20 million Yemenis, out of]{.underline}]{.mark} a
population of about [[29 million, are food insecure,]{.underline}
[including]{.underline}]{.mark} [some [1.8 million
children]{.underline}]{.mark} [who [are]{.mark} acutely
[malnourished]{.mark}.]{.underline} [Humanitarian workers]{.underline}
have [discovered parts]{.underline} of the country [where [people are
eating leaves to survive]{.mark}]{.underline}. [The aid group [Save the
Children estimates]{.mark} that as many as [85,000 children
under]{.mark} [five]{.mark} may have [already died]{.mark} during the
war [from extreme hunger and disease.]{.mark}]{.underline} Yemen relies
heavily on imports for its food supplies. The country grows only about 5
percent of the wheat it consumes. That's because freshwater for crops is
scarce, and farmers increasingly have turned to cultivating the more
profitable qat, a narcotic leaf that 90 percent of Yemeni men chew on a
daily basis. [The Saudi-led coalition has disrupted food and other
supplies coming into Yemen by imposing a naval blockade on
ports]{.underline} [in the]{.underline} Houthi-controlled
[north]{.underline}, notably Hodeidah and Salif, which normally handle
about 80 percent of imports. [Coalition ships]{.underline} have [held up
vessels]{.underline} bound for the ports [for significant
periods]{.underline} or diverted them to other countries. At times
they've stopped all traffic. [A battle for control of
Hodeidah]{.underline} that began this summer [further
disrupted]{.underline} the [[food supply]{.underline}]{.mark}; the two
sides reached a cease-fire agreement in the city in December. To some
extent. Commercial [[imports fell 30 percent]{.underline}]{.mark} from
May to August. [But elevated prices are]{.underline} as much of [a
challenge]{.underline}. The Houthis contribute to the problem by
extracting payments on goods that are trucked through the areas they
control. [A sharp [depreciation of]{.mark} the national
[currency]{.mark} has [pushed prices higher]{.mark} still]{.underline}.
[Civil servants]{.underline}, [who]{.underline} with their families
[make up]{.underline} about [a quarter of the population]{.underline},
[haven't received regular pay]{.underline} since August 2016. [The [2.3
million people]{.mark} in Yemen who've been driven from]{.underline}
their [homes by the war [are especially
cash-strapped]{.mark}]{.underline}. Many have had to sell their
possessions to meet their most basic needs. [[Yemen]{.mark} [was hit by
the worst epidemic of cholera]{.mark} ever recorded]{.underline}
starting in April 2017. [More than [1.2 million people]{.mark} have been
[sickened]{.mark} [and]{.mark} about [2,500]{.mark}]{.underline} have
[[died]{.underline}]{.mark}. [A third wave of infections began this
summer]{.underline}. [Cholera]{.underline}, an acute diarrheal disease,
[is bred by poor sanitation and a lack of clean water]{.underline},
conditions created when wastewater treatment plants reduced operations
because of fuel shortages caused by import disruptions. The infection is
normally easily treated by replacing lost fluids, but that requires
clean water. The UNHCR's investigation concluded that [[there are
"reasonable grounds]{.mark}"]{.underline} to conclude [[that it violates
the proportionality rule of international humanitarian
law]{.underline}]{.mark}. Under that convention, a blockade is
illegitimate if its impact on civilians is disproportionate to its
military benefits. The investigators reported that searches of ships by
the blockading forces had turned up no weapons. For these reasons, the
advocacy group Human Rights Watch earlier called on the UN Security
Council to impose travel bans and asset freezes on coalition leaders,
including the Saudi crown prince and defense minister, Mohammed bin
Salman.

[[Since the Saudi-led coalition]{.underline}]{.mark} (Coalition) began
its military campaign [[in Yemen in March 2015]{.underline},]{.mark}
upwards of [[13,000 Yemen civilians have been killed, including nearly
2000 women and 3000 children]{.underline}. Additionally[, Coalition

### S -- Plan Stops Conflict 

#### Arms embargo immediately grounds the war -- zero risk of fill-in

[The U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates [must]{.underline} stop
looking at Riyadh as a strategic ally and [start viewing the
Kingdom]{.underline} [for what it]{.underline} really [is]{.underline}
[--- a purveyor of extremist ideology across multiple continents, a
country that feels entitled to U.S. protection but often provides
Washington with half-hearted gestures of support, and one whose foreign
policy has led to humanitarian crises and disaster.  ]{.underline}

The Trump administration will attempt to draw a fine-line between
retaliating for Khashoggi's murder and maintaining a relationship it
deems essential in containing Iran. It would be the height of
irresponsibility, however, for the White House to give Riyadh what
amounts to a slap on the wrist.  

Washington holds far better cards than the Saudis could ever hope to
acquire. [Saudi Arabia is **entirely dependent** on U.S. military
training, maintenance, and spare parts in order to keep its fleet of
F-15 fighter jets in the air.]{.underline}

[U.S. defense manufacturers produce the world's most technologically
sophisticated and effective weapons systems, platforms Riyadh **would
not be able to access** if they decided to purchase more equipment from
Russia or China. And while the Saudis could technically decrease crude
oil production and raise gas prices at the pump for American consumers
in retaliation to U.S. pressure, such a move would be unsustainable for
the Kingdom.]{.underline} Saudi Arabia has yet to diversify its economy
away from energy and its budget is financed through the sale of oil.
Saudi Arabia simply can't afford to lose market share over the
long-term.

As Sen. [Rand
Paul](https://thehill.com/people/rand-paul) (R-Ky.) [astutely put
it](https://www.foxnews.com/politics/saudi-crown-prince-is-gonna-have-to-be-replaced-amid-insulting-explanation-for-khashoggis-death-rand-paul-says) on
Fox News Sunday, \"The Saudis need us \[the U.S.\] much more than we
need them."

The White House has a number of options at its disposal to reprimand the
Saudis for the murder of a journalist.

It could do what Sen. Dick Durban
(D-Ill.) [recommended](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/white-house/democratic-sen-durbin-calls-expulsion-saudi-ambassador-n922536) and
officially expel the Saudi ambassador back to the Kingdom, but this move
would be tantamount to a symbolic expression of anger.

The administration could utilize the Magnitsky Act or issue a standalone
executive order in which sanctions are placed on Saudi officials it
believes are involved in Khashoggi's murder. The White House could also
enact U.S. travel restrictions on senior Saudi royals or ministers. 

But while these measures would be satisfying on an emotional level, it
is an open question whether a few blocked bank accounts or VISA
limitations would force Riyadh to engage in the comprehensive
retrospection that is ultimately required; according to an
analysis [conducted](https://piie.com/summary-economic-sanctions-episodes-1914-2006) by
the Peterson Institute for International Economics, sanctions are hardly
a foolproof policy response in terms of effectiveness.

[If the administration wishes to get Saudi Arabia's
attention]{.underline}, President Trump [could]{.underline} take a page
out of Chancellor Angela Merkel's playbook and **[[indefinitely end arms
sales](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=newssearch&cd=1&cad=rja&uact=8&ved=0ahUKEwjf-LTcx5reAhVMqoMKHQWSALMQu4gBCCooAjAA&url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2018/10/22/germany-its-allies-well-halt-future-arms-sales-saudi-arabia-until-we-have-clarity-khashoggi-so-should-you/&usg=AOvVaw2La14URZjKnzET3pTovnXJ) to
the Kingdom.]{.underline}**

In fact, the president can go further than that by calling King Salman
and Crown Prince MbS and telling both that the U.S. will no longer be
providing military or intelligence assistance to the Saudi-led coalition
in Yemen, a conflict which has decimated the country's infrastructure
and contributed to what U.N. officials have long described as the
world's [most acute humanitarian
emergency](https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2018/oct/16/enormity-yemen-famine-initially-underestimated).

[Withdrawing the U.S. from Yemen\'s proxy war would **kill two birds
with one stone**---it would lift some of the stain on America's
reputation by disassociating from the war crimes that have been
committed since Riyadh entered the conflict more than three years, and
it allow the U.S. to leave a sectarian quandary that has no bearing
whatsoever on U.S. national security.]{.underline} Such a decision would
also be a victory for the American people, whose taxpayer dollars are
being used to pay for a war that their elected representatives in
Congress have never voted on.  

In sum, a [U.S. departure would be]{.underline} a [highly rewarding and
relatively cost-free]{.underline} response.

The Senate's failure to override President Trump's veto of its effort to
end U.S. military support for the Saudi-led war in Yemen is not the end
of the story. [A way can and must be found to stop U.S. assistance in
refueling, targeting, and other activities that bolster the
Saudi]{.underline}/United Arab Emirates (UAE) [war effort, which has
killed tens of thousands of civilians and left millions of Yemenis at
risk of famine and fatal, war-induced diseases]{.underline}. For
starters, [Congress should work to close off the other main avenue of
U.S. support for the Saudi-led coalition---the sale of bombs, combat
aircraft, armored vehicles, attack helicopters, and other equipment to
Saudi Arabia]{.underline} and the UAE, [the]{.underline} two [primary
perpetrators of the humanitarian crisis]{.underline} in Yemen. According
to statistics from the Security Assistance Monitor, [the United States
has offered over \$68 billion in weaponry]{.underline} to those two
nations [since the start of the current Yemen conflict]{.underline} in
March 2015. As Bruce Riedel of the Brookings Institution has noted,
these [U.S.-supplied systems are the backbone of the Saudi military, and
without those weapons and related maintenance and support **they could
not sustain their intervention in Yemen**]{.underline}. The [Trump
administration, the U.S. arms industry, and the]{.underline}
[Saudi]{.underline} and UAE [lobbies have made numerous arguments in
favor of keeping U.S. weapons flowing]{.underline} to its Gulf allies,
[but none of them holds up to scrutiny]{.underline}.

BRUCE JONES: If I were an informed but not expert foreign policy

somebody saying]{.underline}, "Wash our hands, [why on earth are we in
this place, it's like Game of Thrones, we don't succeed, our allies are
not always reliable]{.underline}." What is the counter-argument to
that[?]{.underline} BRUCE RIEDEL: The reality is that you can't get away
from the tar baby once you've stuck yourself in it. MARTIN INDYK: [What
happens in the Middle East doesn't stay in the Middle East]{.underline}.
It comes after you. AMANDA SLOAT: We only have to look at the refugee
crisis in Europe to see that [American inaction in the Middle
East]{.underline}, particularly in the Syrian case, also [has
consequences]{.underline}. Europe was flooded with refugees, which apart
from the devastating humanitarian situation has contributed to
heightened populist sentiments there and the corresponding rise of
far-right political parties. MARTIN INDYK: And [the United States has
viable diplomatic options]{.underline}. [U.S. diplomatic leadership can
play a positive role in the conflicts between]{.underline} Israel and
Iran in Syria, and between [Saudi Arabia and Yemen]{.underline}. In
Syria, Israel has no choice but to deal with Moscow because we are
absent from the game. And, as Kemal pointed out, Turkey, Iran, and
Russia are trying to influence the political and diplomatic outcome
there, and we're not playing. Israel will quickly come to realize the
limits to its ambitions in Syria because of the absence of the United
States. [In Yemen, the Saudis need an active American effort to get
them]{.underline} the hell [out of there]{.underline}. It's the only way
it's going to work. [And yet we're not willing to do anything but supply
weaponry]{.underline}. BRUCE RIEDEL: I want to underscore this point. If
you think about smart American politics in this region, [helping the
Saudis get out of the morass that they've created in Yemen is probably
the biggest thing we could do in the near term to help stabilize the
Kingdom and stabilize the Arabian Peninsula]{.underline}. And it's
doable. We have the means[. If we call the Saudis up tonight and say,
"Cease fire tomorrow at 6:00 or no arms deliveries starting at
6:01,"]{.underline} they'll say, "Yeah, okay, we got it." [**They would
have no choice**.]{.underline}

As for arms sales, someone needs to brief Mr. Trump on the actual
results of the promises made to him when he visited Riyadh last year. As
Bruce Riedel of the Brookings Institution sums it up, "The Saudis have
not concluded a single major arms deal with Washington on Trump's
watch." Moreover, [an end to supplies of U.S. spare parts and technical
support, something Russia cannot provide]{.underline},
[would]{.underline} [quickly]{.underline} [ground]{.underline} the
[Saudi air force]{.underline}. [That would]{.underline} have the welcome
effect of [end]{.underline}ing [a bloody bombing campaign in

Like the Obama administration before it, the Trump administration has
tried to keep its distance from the Saudi campaign while simultaneously
supporting it through the sales of bombs, targeting intelligence and
refueling for planes. [Meanwhile, a promised cakewalk --- [the
Saudi]{.mark}s and their United Arab Emirates allies [promise]{.mark}d
[to quickly defeat Houthi rebels]{.mark} who had driven a Saudi-backed
government out of the capital --- [has turned into a quagmire]{.mark}.
The tangible result has been tens of thousands of deaths and what the
United Nations calls the world's worst humanitarian crisis, with 8
million people on the brink of famine and more than 1 million infected
with cholera. [It is long past time to end U.S. support for this

[A U.N. mediator has called the various parties to Geneva]{.mark} early
next month [to discuss a peace process]{.mark}]{.underline}. Among the
first steps would be a cease-fire, along with the transfer to U.N.
control of the Houthi-held port of Hodeida, through which flows 70
percent of Yemen's food and aid supplies. [U.N. sources say [the
Houthis]{.mark}, who have the support of Iran[, are ready to strike
these accords, but the Saudi and UAE regimes]{.mark} have been
resistant. The U.S. allies [will accept a peace process **only if it is
clear** that they will not have Washington's support for more
war.]{.mark}]{.underline} Because President Trump remains in thrall to
the Saudi princes, it's fortunate that Congress has applied some
pressure. Amendments added to the defense authorization bill that Mr.
Trump signed this week require the Pentagon to investigate whether
U.S.-backed air operations resulted in violations of human rights. The
bill conditions further military support on a State Department
certification that the Saudi coalition is working to prevent civilian
deaths. The Dahyan bombing should make such certification unthinkable.

concerns that fighting in the Arabian Peninsula between a Saudi-led
coalition and Houthi rebels in Yemen could disrupt
supplies]{.mark}**]{.underline}[.]{.mark} While Yemen is a minor-league
oil producer, [[the fact that Saudi Arabia]{.underline}]{.mark}, the
country's northern neighbor and [[**one of the world's leading oil
exporters**, had become embroiled in an armed conflict **roiled the
market**]{.underline},]{.mark} [even though analysts said there was very
little near-term chance of a disruption in petroleum
production.]{.underline} [What might matter more, they said, is the
**longer-term market impact of rising geopolitical tensions in the
Middle East.**]{.underline} "[[This is a subset of a broader regional
conflict, and as it intensifies, **the odds of it affecting a major oil
producer continue to rise**]{.mark}," said Seth Kleinman, an analyst at
Citigroup in London.]{.underline} Those general jitters could explain
why [oil prices spiked in early European trading on Thursday **after
news that Saudi Arabia had bombed targets in Yemen**.]{.underline} The
price of West Texas intermediate crude, the main American benchmark,
rose about 4.5 percent in morning trading, while Brent crude, the widely
used international reference, rose about 4 percent. [In early afternoon
trading in New York, [the West Texas benchmark was **up 4.5
percent**]{.mark} on the day, to \$51.40[, and Brent crude was up **4.9
percent**]{.mark}, to \$59.27.]{.underline} Both benchmarks are up more
than 10 percent from the multiyear lows they reached in mid-March ---
although they are still down about 40 percent from their prices a year
ago. "I think it's a very minimal risk to oil supplies," said Rachel
Ziemba, a Middle East analyst at Roubini Global Economics, a financial
research firm, said of the Saudi strikes. "It is important to remember
that Yemen is not a major producer; in fact, that there is a Saudi-led
operation in Yemen, which has been a failed state for some time, should
not be a surprise." But Ms. Ziemba and other analysts said that the
Saudi intervention came as a reminder that geopolitical tensions in the
Middle East --- still the world's most important oil producing region
--- remain high, and appear to be rising. The civil war in Syria is
showing little sign of winding down, and parts of Iraq remain conflict
zones. A theme that runs through these conflicts is the jockeying for
power between Saudi Arabia and Iran, two of the most powerful countries
in the region, as well as in the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting
Countries. In Yemen, for instance, Iran backs the rebels, while Saudi
Arabia has tried to prop up the beleaguered president. Iran and other
OPEC countries are unhappy with the recent Saudi policy of declining to
cut production to prop up prices. In fact, the Saudis appear to be
increasing their output, analysts say. "The market has begun to react to
geopolitical supply risks once again, a trend that has been largely
absent in recent months, underscoring how fundamentals have shifted,"
said Richard Mallinson, an analyst at Energy Aspects, a London-based
market research firm. Saudi-Backed Forces Gain Momentum Annotated maps
showing the Houthi rebels' drive south, U.S. airstrikes and historical
divisions. Still, most analysts say there is a strong possibility that
oil prices will head down again. The market remains oversupplied,
although there is debate about the magnitude of the glut. Demand usually
weakens in the second quarter of the year as winter winds down in the
northern hemisphere and refineries shut down for maintenance. In
addition, oil supplies have built up to high levels in storage tanks in
the United States, partly because, as a matter of government policy,
American companies are not allowed to export surplus crude. A deal
between the United States and Iran over Tehran's nuclear program would
lead eventually to a rise in Iranian oil exports, adding to levels of
crude. Analysts say that in the coming weeks, the oil markets may be
whipsawed as participants try to reconcile the continuing oversupply
with Middle East turmoil. "It is always a funny congruence when you have
high political risk but also very weak market fundamentals," said
Michael Lynch, president of Strategic Energy and Economic Research, an
information and consulting service in Massachusetts. "It is the kind of
thing that makes traders happy because they see volatility ahead." The
Saudi bombing, which continued on Thursday, began as Yemen slid toward
civil war, and the Houthi rebels, who have received support from Iran,
were close to seizing the southern port of Aden, where Yemen's
president, Abdu Rabbu Mansour Hadi, has been hiding. Although the Saudis
said they were suspending civil aviation in the southern part of the
kingdom near Yemen, the fighting is a long way from the main Saudi oil
production centers in the east and poses little threat to the huge oil
industry there, analysts said. The conflict could further reduce Yemen's
modest oil production, which, because of disruptions and lack of
investment, dropped to 130,000 barrels a day last year, less than a
third of what the country produced at a peak in 2001. But Yemen's
production is a tiny fraction of world output and is unlikely to be
missed. Of greater concern is Yemen's location on the Bab el-Mandeb
Strait, a narrow choke point between Yemen and Africa through which
tankers and other ships pass as they head around the Arabian Peninsula
and up the Red Sea toward the Suez Canal. According to the Energy
Information Administration, an arm of the United States government,
about 7 percent of world maritime oil trade went through that passage in
2013. If the route were closed, ships would need to go around Africa, a
much longer journey.

DUBAI --- [**[Oil prices rose sharply]{.mark} Tuesday morning [on
reports of a drone attack at oil pumping stations in Saudi
Arabia]{.mark}**[.]{.mark} The incident is an "act of terrorism," Saudi
Energy Minister Khalid al-Falih said according to the Saudi state news
agency SPA, describing attacks on two oil pumping stations near Riyadh
for the country's East-West pipeline carried out with bomb-laden
drones**. Brent crude futures were up 1.7% at \$71.39 a barrel. U.S.
West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures settled at \$61.86 per
barrel, up 1.2%**]{.underline}. The fire has since been contained,
according to the SPA. Al-Falih asserted that oil production was not
interrupted. State oil company Saudi Aramco said that its oil and gas
supplies to Europe have not been affected, and that no one was injured.
"This act of terrorism and sabotage in addition to recent acts in the
Arabian Gulf do not only target the Kingdom but also the security of
world oil supplies and the global economy," the SPA described al-Falih
as saying. No one has yet been directly accused of carrying out the
attack, but [[a Yemeni Houthi-run TV channel announced]{.mark} on
Tuesday morning [it had **launched drone attacks on several Saudi
installations**]{.mark}]{.underline}[. The channel Masirah TV, [citing a
**Houthi military official, reported that "seven drones carried out

according to the SPA statement, said: "These attacks prove again that it
is important for us to face terrorist entities, including the Houthi
militias in Yemen that are backed by Iran." Yemen's Houthi rebels, who
are supported by Iran, have been fighting Saudi Arabia in their country
since the kingdom launched an offensive against it in early 2015 in

had overthrown. [The more than four-year long conflict **has been deemed

Fujeirah. [Fears over potential for]{.underline} accidental [conflict
The series of incidents have ramped up tensions in the oil-rich region,
where the reported sabotage attack on the commercial vessels Sunday has
spiked fears of possible conflict with regional rival Iran. The
escalation could threaten the Strait of Hormuz, a critical choke point
for some 30% of the world's seaborne oil.]{.underline} The news also
follows a week of increasingly provocative language exchanged between
Washington and Tehran. Citing "very real" threats coming from Iran, but
withholding specific details, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo emphasized
during an interview with CNBC on Sunday that all options --- military
and otherwise --- were on the table in case Iran "makes a bad decision."
Tehran announced last week that it would return to higher levels of
uranium enrichment, breaching the 2015 Iranian nuclear deal, if Europe
did not protect it from the impact of U.S. sanctions, which have
crippled Iran's economy. This followed the White House pushing news of a
U.S. strike group carrier in the Gulf to send an "unmistakable" message
to Iran. Although the ship was on a routine deployment, the
administration's announcement signaled its preparedness for
confrontation. With the growing volume of military hardware occupying
the Persian Gulf, analysts and foreign officials fear a miscalculation
or misunderstanding could spark a serious conflict. British Foreign
Minister Jeremy Hunt told reporters on Monday: "We are very worried
about the risk of a conflict happening by accident with an escalation
that is unintended."

#### The Yemen War is undeniably terrible for oil prices.

Crisis Out Of Proportion,\" OilPrice,
https://oilprice.com/Energy/Oil-Prices/Oil-Markets-Blow-Yemen-Crisis-Out-Of-Proportion.html//SK)

[Saudi Arabia launched airstrikes in Yemen, causing oil prices to jump
on fears over Middle East instability.]{.mark} The markets clearly
reacted with concern over the rising violence in the Arabian Peninsula,
which pits Saudi Arabia against Iran in a proxy war. Saudi Arabia is
targeting Shia rebels seeking to topple the Saudi-backed Yemeni
government. Reuters reports that Saudi bombs targeted an airport and
airbase held by the Houthis, which seized Yemen's capital of Sanaa last
September. "We will do whatever it takes in order to protect the
legitimate government of Yemen from falling," Adel al-Jubeir, the Saudi
ambassador to the United States, said in Washington DC. A Saudi official
told Reuters that a "land offensive might be needed to restore order."
The conflict involves a convoluted set of regional rivalries. [The U.S.
is supporting Saudi Arabia with "logistical and intelligence
support."]{.mark} Iran has denounced Saudi Arabia's attack. The United
Arab Emirates has denounced Iranian influence in the region. Meanwhile
the U.S. and Iran find themselves on the same side with their attacks on
ISIS in Iraq, although their campaigns are not coordinated. The
overnight surprise attack by Saudi Arabia caused oil prices to spike.
WTI has surged over \$50 for the first time in several weeks. [Oil
prices are now up 13 percent]{.mark} in the last week alone. The surge
comes amid growing concerns of oil overflowing storage tanks in the U.S.
and around the world, which threaten a new round of weakness in oil
prices. But oil markets have a tendency of becoming swept up by
unforeseen geopolitical events. Oil traders are apparently concerned
about Yemen's instability sucking in one of the world's largest oil
producers. However, the markets are overreacting. Yemen is a negligent
oil producer, and any disruption to its output would hardly be noticed
on the global market. Not only does Yemen produce very little oil, but
its production has been declining for much of the last 15 years. Yemen
is now producing less than 150,000 barrels of oil per day, or around
one-twentieth of what the state of Texas produces each day. Yemeni Oil
Production Not only that, but Yemen has been rife with conflict for
quite some time. There were somewhere between 10 and 24 major attacks on
oil and natural gas pipelines in Yemen in 2013. The Houthis seized
control of much of Sanaa months ago in what has been labeled a
"half-coup." Violence at the bottom of the Arabian Peninsula is not new.
Perhaps the markets are concerned over Yemen's strategic location? Yemen
is a neighbor to the most important oil producer in the world, and is
also located along the oil trading chokepoint of Bab el Mandeb, a sliver
of water that connects the Red Sea to the Gulf of Aden. In other words,
it connects oil tankers from the Mediterranean to the Indian Ocean. An
estimated 3.8 million barrels of oil travel through these narrow straits
each day. While, in theory, violence could lead to a supply disruption
at the 18-mile wide strait, that is highly unlikely to happen. After
all, the U.S. Navy routinely patrols the region. Moreover, Houthi rebels
do not exactly have a strong maritime presence. The violence will likely
remain onshore. That means that after the initial shock of Saudi
Arabia's attack wears off, oil prices will likely pare back their gains
as traders focus on the fundamentals that have kept them up at night in
recent weeks. Crude oil storage at Cushing is three-quarters full.
China's strategic petroleum reserve is nearly full. U.S. refineries are
temporarily closing for Spring maintenance. All of these things will
push the price of oil back down. That has to be weighed against falling
rig counts and perhaps the beginning of oil production declines in
several key shale areas in the United States. The violence in Yemen is
very much a serious geopolitical and humanitarian concern, but unless
the conflict between Saudi Arabia and Iran transforms from a proxy war
into a broader and more direct military clash, there is little
justification for oil markets to be so rattled.

are]{.underline} as [unlikely to protect themselves]{.underline} today
as they ever have been in the past. [Growing Russian influence, Iran's
hegemonic ambitions, the potential resurgence of key terrorist
organizations, and the massive political instability and violence that

other geopolitical priorities. [If America goes home from the Middle
East, it will sooner or later face pressures to go big.]{.underline}
Whatever policies the Trump administration pursues in the Middle East,
then, the United States will continue to face the same conflicting
imperatives that have long shaped its approach to that region. [America
will be drawn toward the Middle East by enduring interests and pressing
threats]{.underline}. But it will be tempted to depart the region
because of the dangers and costs U.S. engagement causes. In these
circumstances, a responsible strategy would focus on minimizing the
dangers and costs of engagement by suppressing the most serious threats
at the lowest expenditure of resources. This might entail using a select
subset of capabilities---special operations forces, tactical airpower,
support for local forces---to keep the pressure on the most dangerous
terrorist groups and prevent them from mounting major external attacks.
(This was, in essence, the strategy the United States was following
prior to Trump's Syria withdrawal announcement.) Likewise, it might
focus on empowering---with intelligence, diplomatic, and military
support---anti-Iran actors in the region and thereby maintaining a
tolerable balance of power. In Afghanistan, this might mean continuing
to push for a negotiated peace deal, but only with adequate assurances
that an American withdrawal would not turn that country into a terrorist
playground---and without telegraphing a near-term retreat that will only
make such assurances harder to obtain. [The worst

Today, calls for the United States to disengage militarily from the
Middle East are commonplace. Those calls reflect deep frustration with
the travails of American interventions over the past two decades, as
well as the belief---entirely correct---that the United States faces
greater challenges elsewhere. Yet [U.S. interests in the region have not
disappeared, and the prospect that Middle Eastern troubles will impact
America if left unattended is **as high as ever**]{.underline}. [If the
U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates [rushes for the exits, it may
find that it is **pulled back** under **worse circumstances**, and at
**higher costs**, in the future]{.underline}. President Trump is giving
voice to a powerful and understandable urge to cut cleanly and get out
of the Middle East. The best approach, however, may be one that reflects
America's longstanding ambivalence about the region. The interests that
have long kept the United States involved in the Middle East are fairly
clear. Coming out of World War II, American strategists resolved that
[the U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates [must prevent any hostile
force from dominating a region of critical geopolitical or geo-economic
significance]{.underline}. The Middle East, [with its vast oil
reserves]{.underline}, certainly fit that description. True, America
never got a particularly large portion of its oil from Middle Eastern
sources. But its allies did: "The Marshall Plan for Europe," noted
Truman's first Secretary of Defense, James Forrestal, "could not succeed
without access to the Middle East oil." Moreover, the fact that oil was
traded on a global market meant that [a disruption of price or supply in
one region would cause disruption on a far larger scale.]{.underline} At
present, the United States is again becoming a net energy exporter and a
swing producer in the global oil market. Yet [so long as the countries
of the Middle East sit atop huge energy reserves that confer great
wealth and power on whoever controls it, the strategic importance of the
Middle East---and the imperative of keeping it out of hostile
hands---will remain]{.underline}. [Other issues have]{.underline} also
[kept the U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates
[engaged]{.underline}. Since the 1970s, [America has]{.underline} had [a
critical interest in preventing or combating international
terrorism]{.underline}, much of which emerges from the Middle East.
American policymakers have been properly concerned with [confronting
aggression against friendly nations and preventing the spread of
**w**]{.underline}eapons of **[m]{.underline}**ass
**[d]{.underline}**estruction [to rogue states or non-state
actors]{.underline}. Then there is the American interest in promoting
peace, democracy, and human rights in the Middle East---one that has
never been as important as the other U.S. interests, that has affected
how even the most cynical, "realist" administrations have approached the
region.

What about [the purported security benefits of offshore
balancing]{.underline}? Here too, those benefits [are exaggerated and
the costs understated]{.underline}. When it comes to terrorism, for
instance, [offshore balancers are]{.underline} actually [right that the
U.S. troop presence in Saudi Arabia]{.underline} after 1990 [was a
principal cause of al-Qaeda's attacks]{.underline} against American
targets, and that the U.S. invasion and occupation of Iraq also acted as
a magnet for terrorist attacks. In this sense, there is something to the
claim that onshore presence in the Persian Gulf has sometimes attracted
extremist violence. **[Yet the corollary---[that offshore balancing
would]{.mark} largely [solve]{.mark} the problem---[remains
dubious]{.mark}, for two reasons]{.underline}**.

**[[First]{.underline}]{.mark}**, [the [stationing of U.S.
troops]{.mark} in Muslim countries [is only one of many causes
of]{.mark} anti-American [terrorism. Others include]{.mark} anger at
[U.S. support for authoritarian]{.mark} Middle Eastern [regimes]{.mark},
[Washington's relationship with Israel,]{.mark} and Western "[cultural
imperialism]{.mark}" in the Middle East]{.underline}. [U.S. military
[withdrawal]{.mark} from the Middle East [would not ameliorate
these]{.mark} other [grievances]{.mark}, and [it might]{.mark} actually
**[inflame them further]{.mark}**]{.underline}. For [[if the
U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates [embraced offshore balancing, it
would]{.mark} presumably [become more reliant on friendly Arab
dictators]{.mark}---[as well as Israel]{.mark}---[as bulwarks of
stability]{.mark} in a volatile region]{.underline}.

**[Second]{.underline}**, [offshore might undercut counter-terrorism in
other ways, as well. [Forsaking U.S.]{.mark} forward [presence would
deprive]{.mark} the country of the [overseas bases and
contingents]{.mark} that [American forces have repeatedly used in
counter-terror]{.mark}ism operations]{.underline} over the past 30
years. [[It would]{.underline}]{.mark} also [[deprive]{.mark} the
country of [crucial **diplomatic and intelligence
leverage**]{.mark}]{.underline}. [[U.S. forward
deployments]{.underline}]{.mark} and commitments [[have long provided
influence]{.mark} that [Washington has used to evoke greater
coop]{.mark}eration on]{.underline} what Robert Art calls the "quieter
phase of fighting terrorism"---[intelligence-sharing, diplomatic
partnerships, and other behind-the-scenes measures that are [crucial to
fighting terrorist groups]{.mark}]{.underline}.\[8\] [Were America to
slash its security posture, this influence would presumably shrink, as
well.]{.underline} **[[Offshore balancing]{.mark}, then, [is no
