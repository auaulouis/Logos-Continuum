**AbdulKareem, Yemeni journalist, 5/31** -- (Ahmed, Mint Press News,
"Mass Demonstrations Against Saudi Summit and US "Deal" Mark Quds Day in
Yemen," <https://www.mintpressnews.com/258916-2/258916/>) /ncp-aw

SANA'A, YEMEN --- [Massive demonstrations took place across
Yemen]{.underline}'s major provinces on Friday [to oppose a meeting of
leaders of Arab and Islamic countries who gathered in Saudi]{.underline}
Arabia. Demonstrators **[also rallied against the Trump administration's
"Deal of the Century"]{.underline}** --- as Friday is also international
"Quds Day," when protests are held across the world to show solidarity
with Palestinians. Saudi Arabia hosted Arab leaders for three summits in
the holy city of Mecca in a bid to rally support against Yemen, and to
curb what they claim is Iranian-backed terrorism. The summits come amid
escalating tensions between the United States and Iran and follow a
series of Houthi retaliatory attacks against a Saudi oil pipeline deep
inside Saudi territory, which resulted in the temporary shutdown of the
pipeline. In Yemen's capital city of Sana'a, [hundreds of thousands of
residents]{.underline} from the suburbs of the city and from neighboring
provinces [gathered on Airport Street carrying Yemeni flags and holding
banners emblazoned with messages challenging the Saudi regime and
encouraging Yemen's Army to continue to target the K]{.underline}ingdom
of [S]{.underline}audi [A]{.underline}rabia [and the U]{.underline}nited
[Ar]{.underline}ab [E]{.underline}mirates. [In Hodeida province in
western Yemen, hundreds of thousands of protesters took to the streets
despite the ever-present threat of incoming artillery shells, snipers'
bullets, and Saudi warplanes hovering above]{.underline}. Saudi
warplanes are ever-present in the skies over Hodeida but intensified
their presence as residents began preparations for the upcoming rallies.
The demonstrations, which were [organized by the Houthis with the
support of local residents]{.underline}, featured a military parade of
Houthi armored vehicles, tanks, military crews, and weapons, as well as
infantry forces. The move was [an intentional message to the Saudi-led
Coalition]{.underline}, who has beefed up its military presence in the
port city in violation of the UN-brokered Stockholm Agreement. In the
Sada'a province in northern Yemen, hundreds of thousands rallied in Ibb,
Taiz, al-Jawf, Reimah, Dhamar, Amran, the northwest province of Hajjah,
and the central province of al--Mahweet. The protests drew crowds from
across Yemen's deceleration divides: Shaafa'is, Salafis, Zaydis, and
Twthis, as well as most major national parties, were among the protests.
The Grand Mufti of Yemen --- Shams al-Din Sharaf al-Din, the highest
religious authority in Yemen --- was the keynote speaker at the rally in
Sana\`a, where he derided the gathering of Arab leaders in Saudi Arabia,
and [said that the summit was little more than cover for the Coalition's
hideous crimes]{.underline} and would serve as a pretext to mobilize
more mercenaries to Yemen under the pretext of protecting Mecca. For
more than four years Saudi Arabia, backed by the collective military
might of the world's most powerful nations, has sparked the world's
worst humanitarian crisis in Yemen, leaving tens of thousands of
civilians dead and causing the collapse of the country's health
services. According to Yemeni military leaders who spoke to MintPress,
the recent attacks on Saudi Arabia and the U.A.E. are a direct response
to the crimes committed Saudi-led Coalition airstrikes in Yemen, which
have been repeatedly criticized by the United Nations and human rights
groups for intentionally targeting civilians. [Demonstrations also
focused heavily on solidarity with Palestinians]{.underline} on
international "Quds Day." Quds Day falls on the last Friday of every
Ramadan and rallies are held across the globe in a show of support for
the Palestinian cause. Demonstrations [condemned the so-called U.S. Deal
of the Century and vowed to support Palestinians]{.underline} facing the
prospect of losing their rights under the U.S.-brokered plan. On
Thursday, the leader of Yemen's Houthi Ansarullah movement reiterated
his country's support for Palestine in the face of Israeli occupation,
calling on the Yemeni people to express their solidarity with
Palestinians by partaking in International Quds Day rallies. This year's
Quds Day rallies come weeks before a high-profile summit to be held in
the Bahraini capital Manama, where the Trump administration is expected
to unveil its so-called "Deal of the Century" to end the
Israeli-Palestinian conflict. Protesters in Iran, Iraq, Palestine, Syria
and Bahrain also took to the streets on Friday to mark Quds Day, in an
impassioned show of opposition to the "deal." [Saudi]{.underline} Arabia
[recently accused the Houthis of launching ballistic missiles towards
Mecca]{.underline}, which hosts millions of Muslim pilgrims around the
year, especially in the month of Ramadan. [However, the Kingdom provided
no evidence]{.underline} to back its claims and [the accusation is being
seen by many as an attempt to rally the support of the Muslim world
against Yemen]{.underline}. Any attack on Mecca would be seen in the
Muslim world as a sacrilegious act and would serve to galvanize popular
support for the Saudi-led Coalition war in Yemen, which has drawn
international condemnation and engendered support for the Yemeni people.
In fact, from the very first moment that Saudi Arabia made the claim of
a Houthi attack on Mecca, Arab social media was hit with a wave of posts
rife with sectarian hatred and praise for the Saudi royal family. "[The
claims that we targeted Mecca seem like a desperate attempt to gain
justification for a war which has killed thousands of
civilians]{.underline}," Mohammed al-Houthis told demonstrators in
Yemen. Indeed, as Arab leaders arrived at the International Airport in
Jeddah, Saudi Arabia, they were greeted by a government-organized
exhibition that included a number of fragments of the wreckage of Yemeni
missiles and drones. Mohammed Abdulsalam, spokesman for the Houthi
movement, said in response to the exhibition that it is a Saudi attempt
to divert attention from its brutal crimes, which it couldn't cover with
a thousand exhibits. He added: **["You are the ones who ignited the
aggression against Yemen, so stop your aggression and our response will
be stopped."]{.underline}** On March 26, 2015, Saudi Arabia, supported
by the United States, launched a large-scale attack on Yemen under the
pretext of reinstating ousted former President Abdrabbuh Mansur Hadi and
defeating the Houthi Ansar Allah movement, which had gained popular
support following the Arab Spring. After four years of war, the Saudi
Coalition has been unable to defeat the Houthis, nor to restore the
popularly-ousted Hadi to power. The Houthis, who comprise a major
component of Yemen's resistance to Saudi interference in their country,
have recently begun a series of retaliatory attacks on Saudi Arabia and
the United Arabia Emirates.

#### Debate should focus on technical details of military policy. This is crucial to activating and training a left IR contingent to challenge the far right.

In his essay on what a progressive national security agenda should look
like, Van Jackson proposes to stretch the common progressive position of
anti-militarism to a more realist platform of military "sufficiency." In
doing so, he brings attention to a serious gap in current defense
politics. The stilted and [superficial dialogue that passes
for]{.underline} national **[security debate]{.underline}** in American
politics [includes an active constituency for a "military
first"]{.underline} (or military friendly[) fo]{.underline}reign
[po]{.underline}licy, reflexively applying military tools to problems
abroad and inflating defense spending. [There is also a weaker
constituency]{.underline}, most present outside government, [for a
"military last]{.underline}" or "anti-militarist" [policy]{.underline},
which would cut defense spending and end wars with similar reflexivity.
[Outside the]{.underline} apolitical "[blob"]{.underline} of Washington,
[there is little interest in]{.underline} publicly
[debating]{.underline} the prudence or **[effectiveness]{.underline}**
[of these agendas. The left]{.underline}, regardless of its broader
"theory of security," [could]{.underline} [fill]{.underline} some of
**[this vacuum]{.underline}** --- and [it is better situated to do so
than]{.underline} conventional [wisdom might suggest]{.underline}.70
Democrats Drowning at the Water's Edge [For]{.underline} the last two
[decades]{.underline}, there has been little political opportunity to
question America's role in the world. With some exception, relevant
defense and [security policies have been open to]{.underline} even [less
scrutiny]{.underline}. [Questions about the ethical or effective
application]{.underline} of force, the [size of the]{.underline} defense
[budget]{.underline}, the [success]{.underline} of a given military
strategy, the utility of specific weapons platforms, and the return on
investment from security cooperation [are]{.underline}, at best,
[diversions]{.underline}. [Anyone who attempts to challenge the status
quo risks]{.underline} being greeted with [political
attacks]{.underline} about lacking patriotism or not supporting American
troops.71 [But at a time of **frequent missteps abroad**]{.underline} on
the part of the Trump administration, [the space to question America's
fo]{.underline}reign [po]{.underline}licy traditions [may be
widening]{.underline}. The inability to pose legitimate questions about
security policy is a particular flavor of political correctness, and
because of it, the Democratic Party has all but disappeared in defense
policy and politics.72 [The last two years have seen more than a dozen
pieces on the left's lack of]{.underline} branded national [security
ideas]{.underline}.73 Michael Walzer has attributed this gap to an
intentional abstention: [The]{.underline} default [position of the left
is]{.underline} that "[the best]{.underline} [fo]{.underline}reign
[po]{.underline}licy [is]{.underline} a **[good domestic
policy."]{.underline}**74 Jackson highlights modest resourcing and
under-representation as justifications for the left's notable lack of a
"theory of security" and the general subsuming of the debate under a
big-tent "third way" liberalism. Traditional Democrats in the national
security community (including me) have bristled at these criticisms, but
would be hard-pressed to offer a distinctive and coherent political
viewpoint. Some see the Democratic Party's lack of a defined national
security policy as something to celebrate. Declaring that politics
"stops at the water's edge" of national security is a winning Bingo
option at any think tank event. But this dictum stifles debate about the
national interest and the proper application of national resources.
Consequently, [there are moral and political questions on
defense]{.underline} [and interventions abroad that have **no meaningful
forum**.]{.underline} [This gap is **particularly felt** on Capitol
Hill,]{.underline} where in the past security-minded Democrats have
found political safe-harbor in a Republican-lite national security
agenda --- essentially blank-check support for Republicans on defense
with, at most, a raised eyebrow from time to time. These policy
positions require little analytical effort or political capital, and let
Democrats occasionally posture as morally superior by emphasizing
"non-military tools" of foreign policy. The opposite alternative of a
more rigid pacifism and [anti-militarism, though common in]{.underline}
the [grassroots]{.underline} progressive community, **[has no
consistently organized political presence]{.underline}** on the Hill
[and thus also escapes thorough interrogation]{.underline}.75 For those
outside the Beltway, [opposition to all things military offers the
refuge of **principle without critical justification or
analysis.**]{.underline} For many Democrats, the Obama model was a
strangely tolerable middle ground: a bipartisan budget mess made while a
"responsible" president ramped up security interventions in enough
secrecy to avoid nagging scrutiny or self-examination. Re-Politicizing
Defense Despite the valiant efforts of some individuals, there is no
political home for responsible defense debate, oversight, and
accountability.76 Yet, [with determination, the left might find
a]{.underline} real [foothold in defense policy]{.underline} --- without
compromising progressive values. To be clear: [There is substantial work
to be done]{.underline} on [figuring out]{.underline} what cohesive view
of [America's role]{.underline} in the world the left can tolerate and
advance. There is even greater work to be done on determining how to
renew, reuse, and reform international institutions.77 But [any such
agendas would be]{.underline} well [served by embracing]{.underline} a
set of principles that make **[clear-eyed debate and evaluation of
defense policy]{.underline}** and execution an asset, not an
unforgiveable sin. [Critical analysis]{.underline} of defense affairs
[is too often left to the technocratic]{.underline} and comparatively
powerless ["blob," which can write a mean op-ed]{.underline} or tweet,
[but has limited ability to engage]{.underline} the [American
people]{.underline} on its will and interests. And although Congress has
willfully declawed itself so that it cannot maintain meaningful
oversight of national security,78 its ability to stage and amplify
policy debate for the American people is without parallel, and it has
tremendous latent potential to restore greater balance in civil-military
relations. Congress's absence and the associated de-politicization of
national security affairs is costly. For instance, the American public
is deeply ambivalent about the 17-year conflict in Afghanistan and
generally ignorant of the widespread activities of the war on terror.79
This is unsurprising: Congress, too, is disaffected, often ignorant of
where the U.S. military is even engaged,80 and has made little headway
into questioning or shaping this intervention. The most substantive and
serious debate about executive war authorities and the effectiveness of
U.S. counterterrorism strategy has resulted in little more than a
reauthorization proposal that still failed to move forward.81 Too many
examples of political leaders' stand-off or superficial approach to
defense policy and execution abound. [Military superiority
is]{.underline} generally [viewed as sacrosanct]{.underline}, placed on
"so high a pedestal **[as to render real debate
meaningless]{.underline}**."82 That [reverence infantilizes defense
budget debates]{.underline}. Thanking troops for their service is a
politicized ritual that divorces politicians and their constituents from
the intent and costs of that service. With decisions on the needs of the
U.S. military and sustaining legacy systems openly linked to the
economies of congressional districts, it's understandable that skeptics
of utilizing military tools have been unwilling to evaluate their
merits. These must all change. While, at its worst, the political right
treats the use of force abroad as a metric of patriotism and the size of
the force as the measure of one's love of America, [the]{.underline}
political [left ought to draw from]{.underline} its [skepticism toward
intervention and]{.underline} its **[faith in
institutions]{.underline}** [to advance a more]{.underline} rational and
**[accountable]{.underline}** [approach]{.underline} to national
security. For years, Robert Farley has highlighted that "[progressives
consistently **underestimate the importance** of discussions about
military doctrine]{.underline} and technology,"83 [taking]{.underline}
what Michael Walzer calls "**[shortcuts]{.underline}**"84 [in their
critiques]{.underline} of defense policy [that **relieve them** from
contributing to key debates]{.underline}. Instead of excusing
themselves, the left should instead propose legitimate questions about
major shifts in force employment and development: Will it work? What are
its goals? What is the U.S. national security apparatus learning? Why
didn't it work? Were U.S. objectives wrong? What did America change when
it didn't work? Will America do it again? What could be improved? What
should America do now? Joining the Conversation Jackson's notion of what
a progressive "wager" on national security might look like in practice
is useful, filling the gap between the "Republican-lite" default and the
stubbornness of anti-militarism. But [the left's diversity of thought
can accommodate a wider playing field of]{.underline} potential
**[alternative approaches]{.underline}** to security than even he
proposes. A true pacifist movement on the Hill and on the campaign
trail, dedicated to the advancement of non-military approaches but
premised on analysis and logical arguments, would be a serious
advancement in national security and should be welcomed by the most
ardent military advocates. Likewise, [a more **prudent middle
ground**]{.underline} approach --- one that is [skeptical of, but open
to, military might]{.underline} and intervention [and demands a better
**return on investment**]{.underline} of national security tools ---
[should play a more **prominent political role**]{.underline}. The full
range of the left's national security spectrum should forcefully engage
in oversight of the rationale for and quality of American forces and
interventions abroad. The left should therefore consider adopting a
series of principles on defense matters --- including criteria for the
use of force --- that apply to the military-friendly and anti-militarist
left alike. In practice, this means acknowledging that there are valid
political positions on matters of defense that lie somewhere in between
"yes, and" and "no never" and that trivializing them is harmful to
America's national security. There are alternatives to today's
counterterror strategy and it would not be an insult to the military to
debate them. It's entirely legitimate to study whether the military is
equipped to face today's threats without being accused of retreating
from the world or starting with an artificial budget cut. It's sensible
to consider whether the planned growth of ground forces, a 350-ship
Navy, or a 386-squadron Air Force are the right investments or political
benchmarks.85 These [questions involve choices]{.underline} and values
[and should not be avoided under the umbrella of]{.underline} a supposed
[technocratic]{.underline} bipartisan [agreement]{.underline}. Just as
important, [it's essential that the left avoid becoming a **caricature
of itself** that promotes simplistic and superficial positions that set
rigid, unserious standards]{.underline}. [The left may not agree
on]{.underline} the [size or purpose]{.underline} of the military, [but
it can agree]{.underline} America should strive [for]{.underline}
informed **[oversight and accountability]{.underline}**. The bumper
sticker of such principles is simple: Ask informed questions,86
illuminate and demand accountability for failures, encourage fresh
thinking, and bring the American people into the discussion without
fear. That this is so simple is an embarrassment to the present state of
the "debate." In detail, these principles should include: Building the
right force driven by security interests, not an inherently smaller
force driven by an allergy to size. [Arguing that the U.S. military is
too large without clarifying what it should **be expected to
do**]{.underline} and how [is, at best, a lazy and]{.underline} an
[ill-informed]{.underline} reaction to sticker shock. There are valid
questions --- and a range of plausible answers --- about the appropriate
mission and scope of America's forces, and a worthwhile dialogue to be
had on where risks in force structure should reside. Exploring fully how
threat assessments impact military roles, missions, and investments. A
[rigid antipathy]{.underline} to conflict and intervention, or to the
military itself, [**leaves the left out** of conversations that
determine how and where America spends its **blood and treasure**, and
precludes the defense establishment from tackling questions important to
the left]{.underline} (e.g., what does a world of accelerating climate
change require of the U.S. military?). [The left's absence from attempts
to **set the analytic agenda** for defense policy is
**dangerous**]{.underline}. Engaging in more practical conversations
about how military capabilities might be used, where, and why. Military
platforms carry within them assumptions about the nature of U.S.
strategy and interests that are poorly articulated in today's defense
authorizing environment. Most detailed political debate today emphasizes
the cost of military platforms, or their associated acquisition
processes, or, for legacy systems, the industrial base. As Robert Farley
noted in 2011, "Analysts, institutions, and [politicians tend to
**respond to the arguments they see**, rather than those that they
don't]{.underline}."87 Recruiting, retaining, and promoting the military
and civilian skill sets and imagination necessary for today's and
tomorrow's security challenges. [The mish-mash of human capital and
talent management processes of today's Department of
Defense]{.underline}, paired with a legacy focus on capacity, the
booming costs of military personnel, a growing civil-military divide,
and a growing gap in the military's high-technical skills, [spell a
looming disaster]{.underline} for future military manpower. [The left
must treat this as a **strategic priority**]{.underline} rather than a
mere bureaucratic matter. Increasing transparency to the public on the
manner, costs, risks, intent, and success or failure of military
interventions. As I wrote with Alice Friend, the current approach of
military secrecy and unwillingness to pursue an "airing of grievances"
about past strategic and operational failure "assumes that domestic
support for U.S. military engagements can be sustained in an information
vacuum. It draws on a reservoir of public faith in the military while
also limiting the public's ability to make an informed decision. This is
a losing gamble."88 The left should reset this dynamic. Deliberately
connecting debates on America's capabilities and political investments
in preventing and resolving conflicts to the more mature debates on how
to prepare to fight the nation's wars. Diplomacy, development,
economics, and intelligence demand modernization just as military forces
do, and they need to be far better at measuring and communicating their
value. The left should push the political dialogue on these matters
beyond mere talking-points. Ensuring that any military action America
does engage in has clear goals, is limited in scope, is sustainable for
the duration, and is assessed in terms of fully-burdened costs to the
military, the broader national security community (intelligence
analysts, diplomats, aid workers, contractors, and more), U.S. allies,
and local populations. Exploring these matters is not pedantic or risky
in the face of threats. It is the only responsible option, and the left
should force these discussions. Sustaining engaged and thoughtful
interest, oversight, and civil skepticism of all military and
non-military intervention activities abroad. The beginning of an
intervention should not be the high point of political energy. It is
shameful that the progress of the war in Afghanistan, the viability of
the U.S. counterterrorism strategy, the occasional airstrikes in Syria,
and much more escape serious oversight. Advancing civil-military
relations with respectful skepticism of military employment;
unconditional support for service members, families, and veterans; and
resolve to right wrongs of past failures. [The left]{.underline} --- in
all its forms --- [should embrace the necessity of active participation
and serious debate beyond the water's edge]{.underline}. [That's how to
make national security more **democratic, transparent, and therefore
accountable.**]{.underline} What could be more progressive than that?

#### The aff is "culturally" left- recourse to abstract philosophy/jargon and denigration of policy/institutions are more naively optimistic than pragmatic political engagement 

**McClean, PhD, 14**

(David E., [RICHARD RORTY, LIBERALISM AND COSMOPOLITANISM]{.underline})

Yet for some reason, at least partially explicated in AOC, many [leftist
critics continue to cite]{.underline} and refer to the
[eccentric]{.underline} and often [a priori ruminations of thinkers such
as **Bataille, Lacan and Ricoeur,**]{.underline} [and]{.underline} so
**[are dismissed by policy pros]{.underline}** [doing serious
work]{.underline} aimed at curing the ills of society. Rorty thought it
was high time for these culture critics to recognize that they have a
disease. [The disease is]{.underline}, in part, [the need for elaborate
theoretical 'remedies' wrapped in neological and multi-syllabic
jargon]{.underline} that makes no contact with the world, other than the
world of books in which they are cross-referenced and cited. These
[elaborate theoretical remedies]{.underline} can [**seem**
more]{.underline} '[philosophically interesting']{.underline} (a
locution, sometimes employed by Rorty himself, over which I have long
puzzled) **[than pragmatic questions about policy]{.underline}**. As
Rorty put it, somewhat famously: [When]{.underline} one of [today's
academic leftists say]{.underline}s that [some topic has been
'inadequately theorized,' you can be]{.underline} pretty
[certain]{.underline} that he or she is going to drag in either
philosophy of language, or [Lacan]{.underline}ian psychoanalysis,
[or]{.underline} some neo-Marxist version of economic
[determinism]{.underline} \... These **[futile attempts to philosophize
one's way into political relevance]{.underline}** [are a symptom of what
happens when a Left retreats from activism and adopts a **spectatorial
approach**]{.underline} to the problems of its country. [Disengagement
from practice produces **theoretical hallucinations**]{.underline}?
Rorty thought that [leftist culture critics might put]{.underline} their
**[considerable talents]{.underline}** [to better use if they
bury]{.underline} some of **[their cynicism]{.underline}** about their
country's social and political prospects [and help forge public and
political possibilities]{.underline} in a spirit of determination to,
indeed, 'achieve our country' - the country of Thomas Jefferson and
Martin Luther King, Jr; of John Dewey and Malcom X; of Franklin
Roosevelt and Bayard Rustin; of Margaret Fuller and Susan B. Anthony;
ofJack Welsh and Mary P. Follett; and of Harvey Milk and Barack Hussein
Obama. To invoke the words of Martin Luther King, Jr, and with reference
to the American context, the time is always ripe to seize the
opportunity to help create the 'Beloved Community', one woven with the
thread of agape into a conceptually single yet diverse tapestry that
shoots for nothing less than a true cosmopolitan ethos, one wherein both
same-sex unions and faith-based initiatives will be unremarkable
features of the social landscape, one wherein business interests and the
interests of universities are not seen as belonging to two separate
realms but rather as part of the same answer to the threat of social and
ethical nihilism. [People who fancy themselves]{.underline} to be
[intellectuals,]{.underline} Rorty seemed to be saying, [would do well
to create]{.underline} from within their ranks **[a new kind of public
intellectual]{.underline}**, one that has [both a hungry and able
theoretical mind yet]{.underline} is **[capable of seeing the need to
move past high theory to address practical and perplexing
problems]{.underline}**, problems which require discussion and treatment
that are less bedazzling and 'philosophically interesting' but more
important to the prospects for human flourishing. [The engaged public
intellectual]{.underline} does more listening and less pontificating,
and [seeks to understand]{.underline} labour **[law]{.underline}**
[and]{.underline} the [complexities of]{.underline} managerial decision
making as much as [theories]{.underline} of surplus value and the
fact-value dichotomy, [the logic of international markets]{.underline}
and trade agreements [as much as critiques of
commodification]{.underline}, and [the politics of complexity as much as
the **politics of power.**]{.underline} [This means **diving deeply into
the guts of social institutions**]{.underline}, [**into the grimy
pragmatic details** where many intellectuals **are loathe to
go**]{.underline} or to dwell [but where the officers and
bureaucrats]{.underline} of those institutions [take difficult and often
**unpleasant, imperfect decisions** that affect other people's
lives]{.underline}, and it means [making honest attempts to **truly
understand how those institutions** actually]{.underline} [function
i]{.underline}n the actual world **[before howling for their
erasure]{.underline}** or reconstitution. [It means taking the risk of
honest mistakes]{.underline} where mistakes have consequences, and may
be uncovered in the glaring light of practical application,
[something]{.underline} with which [too few on the cultural Left bother
themselves as they stand on the sidelines as critical spectators,
bearing no ultimate consequences for their proffers, and doing
so,]{.underline} as Rorty saw it, **[somewhat priggishly]{.underline}**
at times. [Is it really possible to]{.underline} philosophize by
[hold]{.underline}ing [Lacan or Bataille in one hand]{.underline} (for,
to be clear, there is nothing wrong with reading and employing the works
of either of them) **[and the Code of Federal Regulation in the
other?]{.underline}** Given that whatever it has meant to be a
philosopher has been under siege at various levels, Rorty believed that
[referring to the]{.underline} way things are actually done in the
**[actual world]{.underline}** [as one thinks through issues of public
morality]{.underline} and solidarity [**should be considered a viable
alternative** to]{.underline} the way [culture critique]{.underline} is
undertaken on the cultural Left. [Intellectuals **who want to be taken
seriously**]{.underline} [should become more like social and cultural
auditors and less like removed]{.underline} and disconnected [culture
critics]{.underline}. They might then be able [to]{.underline} recast
themselves as thinkers who take up questions of social justice in a
serious way, as the ones in society able to [traverse the distances
between the ivory towers of the academy and the street]{.underline}. We
do have examples of such persons, of various political bents. John
Dewey, Mary War- nock, Mary P. Follett, Paul Krugman, George Soros,
William James, Sheila Bair and Jane Addams come to mind, as but a few
examples, all using insights gained from living a life of the mind to
shape (or to help shape) better public policies and better ways to run
institutions. If philosophers seek to remain what the public thinks we
are anyway, a class of persons of whom it can be said, as Orwell put it
in another context, 'One has to belong to the intelligentsia to believe
things like that; no ordinary man could be such a fool', we will only
become more and more irrelevant to the task of forging solutions that
have a chance to adequately address the many problems of various
publics.10 [There are]{.underline} probably **[very few unscrupulous
optimists]{.underline}** - [reformers who plunge ahead without counting
the cost]{.underline}. [The closest group]{.underline} of people [I can
think of]{.underline} who might meet the requirements to belong to such
a class of persons [are]{.underline} some members of **[the disengaged
cultural Left]{.underline}**, just described. But to brand such a group
with the appellation 'unscrupulous optimists might be to brand them
inappropriately, for they are not known for optimism, but rest content,
too often, with cynicism. For that reason, [a better appellation might
be **'desiderative utopians'**]{.underline}. [Desiderative]{.underline}
utopians, [as opposed to Pragmatic utopians]{.underline}, [are
perennially dyspeptic]{.underline}, though they can and often do sketch
a vision of an ideal state of political and social affairs. [They have
concluded that cash-backed power always wins]{.underline}, that money
will always get the last word, and **[so they retreat to their
seminars]{.underline}**, books and conferences **[that seem more like
orgies of wishful thinking and pessimism]{.underline}** [than places to
think through ways to coopt the oligarchs]{.underline} and the
plutocrats or, failing that, to beat them back. [Desiderative
utopians]{.underline}, in the context of this discussion, are those who
**[think that erudite complaint exhausts their
responsibilities]{.underline}** to their country - the country
concerning which they have articulated aspirations to finish the work
that is required to transform it into a pluralist civilization in which
the worst sorts of cruelty, including the cruelties of invidious types
of social distance, are eradicated. **[They tend not to be guilty of
'the best case fallacy' because they are not engaged enough with real
politics or the workings of real institutions to bring about any
case.]{.underline}** It is not hard to understand why conservatives and
those who consider themselves politically engaged abjure desiderative
utopian visions. [Desiderative utopians and those engaged in unceasing
dyspeptic critique have given the words 'utopia' and 'utopian' a
negative connotation]{.underline}. But [while utopian
sketches]{.underline} of possible futures [can be construed as
unrealistic]{.underline} social velleities, as possible to bring into
reality as unicorns, [they may also be construed, as the Pragmatist
utopian does, as the amalgamation of desirable social and political
**goals**]{.underline} that are [assumed to come about only through
**successive meliorative and reformist moves**]{.underline}, moves made
in what Rorty refers to as cultural politics as well as in ordinary
power politics. This is how Rorty understood the word 'utopia', on my
reading. [For Rorty's liberal/pragmatist/cosmopolitan utopia is a sketch
of a social order that has at least **some reasonable chance of coming
about if**]{.underline} (and this is a big if, as Rorty well knew) [the
right moves get made]{.underline}, **[and if there is enough hopeful and
optimistic political engagement to bring it about.]{.underline}**
[Rorty's utopia is deeply rooted in the traditions and habits of mind
that attend **Western liberalism**]{.underline}, and so it is no mere
velleity. It rests upon what 'we' have already achieved, which gives
license to think about what can come next, even if we must assume, as
with Josiah Royce, that the future society we envision and about which
we concern ourselves is one that may not be achieved in our lifetimes,
or even in our children's lifetimes - may even be seen as a 'lost cause'
when viewed in the short run. But Royce reminds us, as well: [Loyalty to
lost causes is]{.underline} \... not only a possible thing, but [one of
the most potent influences]{.underline} of human history. In such cases
**[the cause comes to be idealized through its very failure to win
temporary and visible success ..]{.underline}**. All the more, in
consequence, does this cause demand that its followers should plan and
work for a far-off future, for whole ages and aeons of time; should
prepare the way for their Lord, the cause, and make his paths straight
\... All this larger and broader devotion of those loyal to a lost cause
is colored and illuminated by \[their\] strong \[emotional commitment to
that cause\].11 [Royce did not assume that the lost cause is lost
because it is impossible]{.underline} to attain, but [**it is simply
lost for any practical purposes for some time,** perhaps]{.underline}
for some **[generations.]{.underline}** Thus [there is a conception of
utopia that is grounded in the **realistic assessment of the probability
of its outcome**,]{.underline} and [that attends the impassioned
reformers' understanding that nothing comes about without work, risk,
intelligence, sacrifice, sometimes blood, and always faith.
This]{.underline} notion of [utopia is useful]{.underline} because
[it]{.underline} serves to capture collections of ideals that reflect
our noblest hopes and sentiments in view of the distance we have already
travelled in our social and political development, and so **[serves as a
light to guide the political community]{.underline}** or **[the 'ship of
state' on its way toward achieving them]{.underline}**. [This is the
purpose of any political theorizing that does not object to its ideals
being cast as utopian]{.underline}. As James reminded us in the
Postscript to his Varieties of Religious Experience: No fact in human
nature is more characteristic than its willingness to live on a chance.
The existence of the chance makes the difference, as Edmund Gurney says,
between a life of which the keynote is resignation and a life of which
the keynote is hope.12 The tension between this attitude of social hope
and Scrutonian conservatism is the boundary from where Rorty's political
and social reflections took shape. Rorty worked within the tensions that
exist and will always exist between Jamesian hope, risk and chance, on
the one hand, and the need to embrace and defend the values of a
particular 'we' that, on Scruton's account, must be defended, and which
in fact provides the realism for the venture. The utopian sketch that
derives from this tension has a far better chance of becoming a reality,
for what it provides us with is a rooted, historicist vision, a
utopianism that looks to past success as it 'muddles' forward toward
ever-improving social conditions. (76-9)

Yet for some reason, at least partially explicated in Richard Rorty\'s
Achieving Our Country, a book that I think is long overdue, leftist
critics continue to cite and refer to the eccentric and often a priori
ruminations of people like those just mentioned, and a litany of others
including Derrida, Deleuze, Lyotard, Jameson, and Lacan, who are to me
hugely more irrelevant than Habermas in their narrative attempts to
suggest policy prescriptions (when they actually do suggest them) aimed
at curing the ills of homelessness, poverty, market greed, national
belligerence and racism. I would like to suggest that it is time for
American social critics who are enamored with this group, those who
actually want to be relevant, to recognize that they have a disease, and
a disease regarding which I myself must remember to stay faithful to my
own twelve step program of recovery. The disease is the need for
elaborate theoretical \"remedies\" wrapped in neological and
multi-syllabic jargon. These elaborate theoretical remedies are more
\"interesting,\" to be sure, than the pragmatically settled questions
about what shape democracy should take in various contexts, or whether
private property should be protected by the state, or regarding our
basic human nature (described, if not defined (heaven forbid!), in such
statements as \"We don\'t like to starve\" and \"We like to speak our
minds without fear of death\" and \"We like to keep our children safe
from poverty\"). As Rorty puts it, \"When one of today\'s academic
leftists says that some topic has been \'inadequately theorized,\' you
can be pretty certain that he or she is going to drag in either
philosophy of language, or Lacanian psychoanalysis, or some neo-Marxist
version of economic determinism. . . . These futile attempts to
philosophize one\'s way into political relevance are a symptom of what
happens when a Left retreats from activism and adopts a spectatorial
approach to the problems of its country. Disengagement from practice
produces theoretical hallucinations\"(italics
mine).[(1)](file:///C:\WINDOWS\Temporary%20Internet%20Files\Content.IE5\OTKXU3YH\the%20city.htm#N_1_)
Or as John Dewey put it in his The Need for a Recovery of Philosophy,
\"I believe that philosophy in America will be lost between chewing a
historical cud long since reduced to woody fiber, or an apologetics for
lost causes, . . . . or a scholastic, schematic formalism, unless it can
somehow bring to consciousness America\'s own needs and its own implicit
principle of successful action.\" Those who suffer or have suffered from
this disease Rorty refers to as the Cultural Left, which left is
juxtaposed to the Political Left that Rorty prefers and prefers for good
reason. Another attribute of the Cultural Left is that its members fancy
themselves pure culture critics who view the successes of America and
the West, rather than some of the barbarous methods for achieving those
successes, as mostly evil, and who view anything like national pride as
equally evil even when that pride is tempered with the knowledge and
admission of the nation\'s shortcomings. In other words, the Cultural
Left, in this country, too often dismiss American society as beyond
reform and redemption. And Rorty correctly argues that this is a
disastrous conclusion, i.e. disastrous for the Cultural Left. I think it
may also be disastrous for our social hopes, as I will explain. Leftist
American culture critics might put their considerable talents to better
use if they bury some of their cynicism about America\'s social and
political prospects and help forge public and political possibilities in
a spirit of determination to, indeed, achieve our country - the country
of Jefferson and King; the country of John Dewey and Malcom X; the
country of Franklin Roosevelt and Bayard Rustin, and of the later George
Wallace and the later Barry Goldwater. To invoke the words of King, and
with reference to the American society, the time is always ripe to seize
the opportunity to help create the \"beloved community,\" one woven with
the thread of agape into a conceptually single yet diverse tapestry that
shoots for nothing less than a true intra-American cosmopolitan ethos,
one wherein both same sex unions and faith-based initiatives will be
able to be part of the same social reality, one wherein business
interests and the university are not seen as belonging to two separate
galaxies but as part of the same answer to the threat of social and
ethical nihilism. We who fancy ourselves philosophers would do well to
create from within ourselves and from within our ranks a new kind of
public intellectual who has both a hungry theoretical mind and who is
yet capable of seeing the need to move past high theory to other
important questions that are less bedazzling and \"interesting\" but
more important to the prospect of our flourishing - questions such as
\"How is it possible to develop a citizenry that cherishes a certain
hexis, one which prizes the character of the Samaritan on the road to
Jericho almost more than any other?\" or \"How can we square the
political dogma that undergirds the fantasy of a missile defense system
with the need to treat America as but one member in a community of
nations under a \"law of peoples?\" The new public philosopher might
seek to understand labor law and military and trade theory and doctrine
as much as theories of surplus value; the logic of international markets
and trade agreements as much as critiques of commodification, and the
politics of complexity as much as the politics of power (all of which
can still be done from our arm chairs.) This means going down deep into
the guts of our quotidian social institutions, into the grimy pragmatic
details where intellectuals are loathe to dwell but where the officers
and bureaucrats of those institutions take difficult and often
unpleasant, imperfect decisions that affect other peoples\' lives, and
it means making honest attempts to truly understand how those
institutions actually function in the actual world before howling for
their overthrow commences. **[This might help keep us from being slapped
down in debates by true policy pros who actually know what they are
talking about but who lack awareness of the dogmatic assumptions from
which they proceed, and who have not yet found a good reason to listen
to jargon-riddled lectures from philosophers and culture critics with
their snobish disrespect for the so-called \"managerial
class.\"]{.underline}**

[The Saudi-led campaign,]{.underline} which has also included Kuwait,
Qatar, Egypt, and Sudan[, has been calamitous for the Arab world's
poorest country]{.underline}. It was launched in 2015 after a coalition
of Houthi rebels from the northern part of the country and forces loyal
to Ali Abdullah Saleh, the former president who was ousted from power in
2012, expelled the now-exiled Saudi-backed president, Abdrabbuh Mansur
Hadi, from the capital, Sana'a. In addition to weapons, Washington has
provided logistical support and intelligence backing to the Saudis and
their allies. The Saudi air war, however, became so destructive and
indiscriminate, that the Obama administration suspended the sale of some
\$350 million in precision-guided weapons to Saudi Arabia in December.
In March, the Trump administration announced it intended to continue
sales despite the deteriorating humanitarian situation in Yemen.
Congress was formally notified that the sale was going forward last
month. Under U.S. law, Congress has 30 days to block major weapons sales
from the notification date. [Peace activists are **calling on U.S.
citizens to pressure Congress** to stop Washington's sales of weapons to
Saudi Arabia]{.underline}. "[Saudi airstrikes have completely destroyed
Yemen with U.S.-sold weapons," said]{.underline} Kate [Kizer, from the
Yemen Peace Project]{.underline}, one of the activist groups leading the
effort. "[We are literally sending Yemen weapons of mass
starvation."]{.underline} The World Food Program reported that as of
2017, 3.3 million children and pregnant or nursing women are severely
malnourished. Additionally, 60 percent of the population is food
insecure, 24 percent critically so. Amnesty International disclosed that
about 18.8 million people in Yemen depend on humanitarian aid. The war
has aggravated the scarcity of food, water, and shelter in the region.
Human rights organizations say that [arms sales to Riyadh by the United
States]{.underline}, Great Britain, [and other nations have greatly
worsened the situation inside Yemen]{.underline}, a nation of 25
million. In a June 8 statement, Joanne [Lin, senior managing
director]{.underline} for advocacy and government affairs at Amnesty
International, [stated that "by selling arms to Saudi Arabia, knowing
that they may well be used to kill civilians in Yemen, the U.S.
government may be **complicit in serious violations of international
law, including war crimes."**]{.underline} "The Trump Administration has
repeatedly indicated a willingness to partner with Saudi Arabia despite
its appalling human rights record. It is up to the Senate to stop this,"
she added. Kate [Kizer linked U.S. weapons sales to Saudi Arabia to what
human rights groups say are the deaths of more than 10,000 Yemeni
civilians,]{.underline} injuries to at least 50,000 others, and tens of
thousands more lost to preventable diseases as a result of the
destruction of health and sanitation facilities and the breakdown in
health services. In a telephone interview with The New York Times,
UNICEF regional director of Yemen, Geert Cappelaere, said that cases of
cholera could rise to 300,000 by the end of June, and that half of these
cholera cases afflict children. Only 40-45% of existing hospitals still
stand, according to the Yemen Peace Project and the Friends Committee on
National Legislation. [Saudi Arabia and its allies]{.underline},
including the United States, [charge that Iran is backing the Houthi
rebels]{.underline} in Yemen. Many U.S. lawmakers have aligned with
Saudi Arabia while arguing that Iran is complicit with the Yemeni
rebels, whom they regard as Iranian proxies. Although Tehran has
expressed sympathy for the Houthi cause, it has denied arming the rebels
and denounced the Saudi intervention as having caused a humanitarian
catastrophe. [The security vacuum in Yemen since the start of the civil
war has strengthened the growing extremism in the region. Among the
groups fighting the Houthi rebels in Yemen are affiliates of al-Qaeda in
the Arabian Peninsula, regarded as one of the most powerful al-Qaeda
factions.]{.underline} Senate Vote The upcoming votes constitute "one of
the most consequential war-and-peace votes to go through Congress this
year," said Kate Gould of the Friends Committee on National Legislation.
"This U.S.-backed Saudi war has to end." [Activists are trying to
encourage a grassroots campaign, urging constituents to contact their
representatives by various means.]{.underline} These include direct
email messages, phone calls via a toll-free number: 1-855-68-NO WAR,
lobbying visits to congressional offices, and in-person attendance at
town hall meetings with lawmakers---all [to raise awareness about arms
sales to Saudi Arabia and the effects of U.S. bombs and missiles dropped
on Yemen. Many lawmakers have yet to decide how to vote]{.underline} on
the measures targeting arms sales to Saudi Arabia. "[They haven't made
up their minds yet, and they don't have firm positions yet on the
bills," said Gould. "**Every constituent action can make a
difference."**]{.underline} In an interview with LobeLog, she affirmed
the importance of exposing the high level of U.S. involvement in the
Yemen conflict. "Just having this bill on the Senate floor shines a
spotlight on a country so often ignored in the U.S.," she said. ["The
Saudi-led coalition is dropping the bombs, but the US is making the
bombs, refueling the planes, providing logistics support and otherwise
enabling the coalition's war crimes. As President Trump gives the Saudis
a blank check for more war, every vote sends the message that it's time
for the Saudis to end this carnage and get to the negotiating
table."]{.underline}

Yemen,\" American Conservative, 3-28-2019
https://www.theamericanconservative.com/articles/saudi-arabia-is-losing-the-war-in-yemen/

As the war in Yemen marks the end of its fourth year this week, it is
clear that, **[with the aid and complicity of the U]{.underline}**nited
**[S]{.underline}**tates and United Kingdom, **[Saudi Arabia and
the]{.underline}** United Arab Emirates (**[UAE]{.underline}**) **[have
savaged an impoverished country]{.underline}**. Yemen's infrastructure
has been laid waste to, as has some of its most productive farmland.
**[The result has been the worst humanitarian crisis on the
planet]{.underline}**. Yet despite this destruction, **[Yemen has turned
into Saudi Arabia's Vietnam. Ditto for the UAE]{.underline}**. The two
countries have sunk billions of dollars and countless troops and
mercenaries into what has become a quagmire of catastrophic proportions.
**[What they had hoped would be a decisively quick war has turned into
an albatross]{.underline}**, with the rest of the world now questioning
their motivations and urging their Western helpmates to withdraw support
immediately. The overt reason for Saudi and Emirati involvement is to
defeat the Houthi rebels, a Zaidi Shia group with deep roots in Yemen.
Yet this hasn't been achieved. **[The two Gulf States claim that the
Houthis are proxies for Iran, but it has become increasingly clear that
they are fiercely independent]{.underline}**, and while they receive
limited aid from Tehran, they do not take orders. Saudi and Emirati
leaders would do well to learn from Yemen's 2,000-year history of
draining the blood and coffers of imperial and lesser powers. **[The
Yemenis defeated the Romans, the Ottoman Turks twice, and evicted the
British in 1967]{.underline}**. They also defeated the Egyptians who
invaded in 1962. Much like the U.S. in Vietnam more than 40 years ago
and more recently in Afghanistan, **[the goliath invaders are fighting a
war of attrition, bleeding their resources, and losing whatever moral
and political authority they might have had in the
process]{.underline}**. But were they ever being honest about their real
intentions in Yemen? **[Saudi Arabia and the UAE have armed and
supported a mushrooming number of Yemeni militias and factions, some of
which have ties to al-Qaeda]{.underline}**. These policies have
purposefully turned Yemen into a patchwork of warring fiefdoms. This is
because the covert purpose of the "intervention" has less to do with
perceived Iranian influence than it does with securing access to Yemen's
strategic real estate and its natural resources. **[Saudi Arabia and the
UAE are engaged in a neo-colonial war for power, resources, and
territory. The two countries]{.underline}**, which are increasingly in
competition with one another, **[are trying to carve Yemen up into
spheres of influence]{.underline}**. Because it has a slightly more
competent mercenary army, **[the UAE has the lead over Saudi Arabia in
this regard. It's set up military bases throughout southern Yemen where
it supports separatists of various stripes who want everything from an
independent south Yemen to an Islamic emirate]{.underline}**. Not
content with just occupying the mainland, the UAE has also established
bases on the once pristine Yemeni island of Socotra---a UNESCO world
heritage site---and the island of Perim. **[Saudi Arabia is playing
catch-up with its ally and is laying claim to the governorate of
al-Mahra in eastern Yemen]{.underline}**. There, **[Riyadh hopes to
build a pipeline]{.underline}** that will allow it to bypass the Strait
of Hormuz. However, as in other parts of Yemen, the people are fighting
to stop what many view as a land grab by a foreign power. Residents of
al-Mahra protested the construction of a Saudi-funded madrassa that
would have undoubtedly used Saudi schoolbooks, the same schoolbooks that
were used by the Islamic State. Residents are also blocking the
construction of a Saudi military base. Both countries have much to learn
from America's costly misadventures after 9/11. **[Despite fielding the
world's most capable armed forces and spending several trillion dollars,
the U.S. failed to achieve its aims in Iraq or Afghanistan, a country
that is in many respects similar to Yemen. In Iraq, the invasion
destroyed much of that country and paved the way for the rise of the
Islamic State, as well as driving Baghdad into Iran's open
arms]{.underline}**. In both nations, **[new and deadlier strains of
extremism grew out of the power vacuums that were
created]{.underline}**. Saudis Find Out Hard Way: Yemen Is Another
Graveyard of Empires **[The war in Yemen will have similar
results]{.underline}**. By continuing to fight the Houthis, **[Saudi
Arabia and the UAE are paradoxically strengthening their enemies and
providing Iran with more fertile ground for its influence
operations]{.underline}**. The Houthis are superb fighters, but have
shown less competence with regard to governance. **[The war and Saudi
and Emirati airstrikes have enhanced the Houthis' legitimacy by allowing
them to do what they do best: fight]{.underline}**. It may be years
before Yemen is a unified country with a functioning government again.
In fact, **[Yemen may never again be unified]{.underline}**. However,
the UAE and Saudi Arabia are unlikely to ever see a return on their
investment. Even a cursory reading of Yemen's history would have told
them this. And failing that, an examination of America's failed wars
should have dissuaded them from becoming involved in the first place.
**[Without sustained international pressure on Saudi Arabia, the UAE,
and Iran, the war in Yemen will continue for years to
come]{.underline}**. All the while, **[it will drain both the UAE and
Saudi Arabia of billions of dollars, spawn new militant groups, and
ironically provide Iran with more opportunities to expand its
influence]{.underline}**. Most critically, **[the war will continue to
kill, maim, starve, and impoverish tens of thousands of Yemeni
civilians]{.underline}**.

The Trump administration's official position, based on the notion that
"limited support to member countries of the Emirati and Saudi-led
coalition, including intelligence sharing, logistics, and, until
recently, aerial refueling" did not constitute being "engaged in
hostilities," was that the resolution had no legal effect**[. But the
activists and congressional staff who worked on the resolution are
convinced that the administration's frantic efforts to prevent its
passage reveal just how powerful it will prove.]{.underline}** One
Democratic congressional strategist involved in promoting the resolution
acknowledged as much in an interview with Truthdig. "At the same time
the Pentagon and the Trump administration were saying it would have no
impact, they were scrambling to change the facts on the ground by
unilaterally suspending air refueling," the strategist said. [The
strategist]{.underline} also [admitted **this "first assertion of war
authorities by Congress" would "force the administration to retreat,**
and when the U.S. is no longer the steadfast patron of the Saudi
coalition campaign, the Saudi coalition will be compelled to seek an
urgent and immediate peace settlement."]{.underline} Robert Naiman,
policy director at Just Foreign Policy, an activist membership
organization that has been working to support the eventual passage of
the Yemen resolution in both houses of Congress, agrees the resolution
is bound to push the Saudis toward ending the war. "I've always believed
any kind of congressional vote that says no in a toothy way like the war
powers resolution would be enough to force the administration and the
Saudis to change policy," he told Truthdig[. Naiman called the
administration's gambit to head off passage of the resolution "a
political signal the whole world sees."]{.underline} [He said he
believes "the political-diplomatic signal is even more important than
direct military participation." **The war's swift conclusion appears all
but inevitable.**]{.underline} While Crown Prince Mohammed may be
committed to final victory, the Saudi regime remains heavily dependent
on U.S. political-diplomatic cover, as it has since the beginning of the
bombing campaign in Yemen. Ironically, that political reality could now
tip the balance toward peace.

When the Senate voted in March on a resolution to withdraw American
military support for Saudi Arabia's war in Yemen, Crown Prince Mohammed
bin Salman personally visited Capitol Hill to urge senators to oppose
it. Now the resolution has returned, but the crown prince has not.
**[Saudi Arabia's typically formidable lobbying operation has gone quiet

kingdom's diminished influence in Washington after the killing of the
journalist and Saudi dissident Jamal Khashoggi two months
ago]{.underline}**. The Saudi embassy has emailed Senate offices touting
what it says are humanitarian efforts in Yemen, but lobbyists for the
kingdom have largely disengaged since Khashoggi was killed in October at
the Saudi consulate in Istanbul[. The Saudi ambassador to the U.S.,
Prince Khalid bin Salman, only returned to Washington last week after
nearly two months away.]{.underline} [And the offices of three
Republican senators who joined with Democrats late last month to advance

kind of environment for the Saudi government to be welcomed on the
Hill,"**]{.underline} said Kate Gould, a lobbyist for the Friends
Committee on National Legislation, a Quaker nonprofit that's been
advocating for the resolution. The Central Intelligence Agency's
conclusion that Mohammed bin Salman likely ordered Khashoggi's death,
along with growing international outrage over the humanitarian crisis in
Yemen, have curtailed Saudi Arabia's influence in Washington[. Five of
the small army of lobbying firms that worked for the kingdom quit after
the death]{.underline} of Khashoggi, who lived in Virginia and wrote for
The Washington Post. [One Trump administration official, speaking on
condition of anonymity, suggested the Saudis had been slow to appreciate
how much their position in Washington had eroded]{.underline}. "I don't
think they quite understand how strong the feelings are here in this
town, how significant \[Khashoggi's killing\] is for the reputation and
credibility of Saudi Arabia," the official said. [But one person

anonymity because he wasn't authorized to talk to reporters, said **the
Saudis "are self-aware" and realized that "direct advocacy on Yemen is
made more difficult" by the anger over Khashoggi's
killing.**]{.underline} The Trump administration, meanwhile, is working
to defeat the Yemen resolution, which is widely seen as a way to rebuke
Saudi Arabia. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and Defense Secretary Jim
Mattis met with senators the day of a vote on the resolution last month
to talk up the importance of the American alliance with Saudi Arabia.
Pompeo cautioned that pulling back in the region would strengthen Iran
--- which is backing the Houthi rebels the Saudis are fighting --- as
well as the Islamic State and al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula. While
senators voted to advance the resolution anyway, "it's still more
effective for Secretary Mattis and Mike Pompeo to be lobbying on it"
than anything the Saudi government could be doing, the person familiar
with the Saudi lobbying efforts said. [The Saudi embassy has made some
limited efforts to burnish the kingdom's image among senators by
emailing Senate staffe]{.underline}rs. One email sent last week, which
was obtained by POLITICO, touted the "King Salman Humanitarian Aid and
Relief Center\'s on going \[sic\] efforts to reduce risks associated
with landmines that have been indiscriminately planted in Yemen by the
Iran-backed Houthi militia." [But lobbyists for the Saudis don't appear
to be making more substantial efforts to help derail the resolution.
Every Democratic senator voted to advance the resolution.]{.underline}

### UQ -- 2020 

#### Saudi Arabia understands its arms sales are [contingent on a 2020 win for Trump]{.underline} -- [they won't survive if he loses]{.underline}

WASHINGTON, D.C. -- [The Kingdom of Saudi Arabia has agreed to provide
material and logistical assistance to President Donald J. Trump's
re-election campaign as part of a deal brokered by]{.underline} the
president's son-in-law, [Jared Kushner,]{.underline} a spokesperson for
the Trump 2020 re-election campaign confirmed on Thursday. According to
the terms of the deal[, intel]{.underline}ligence [assets operating out
of the Saudi embassy in Washington, D.C. **will do "whatever necessary
within the confines of Saudi law" to ensure a Trump victory in
2020**]{.underline}. [In exchange, the Trump administration will grant
Saudi Arabia **a twenty-five percent discount on arms sales through
2050** -- a move that is sure to strengthen President Trump's
increasingly intimate relationship with Crown Prince
M]{.underline}ohammed [b]{.underline}in [S]{.underline}alman. While
campaign officials declined to elaborate on the nature of Saudi support,
an aide to White House National Security Advisor John Bolton, who was
present during talks with Saudi officials, told Real News Right Now that
agents from the General Investigation Directorate, or Mabahith, have
already begun providing campaign officials with information on Mr.
Trump's opponents in the U.S. media. ["They've been instructed to
neutralize any potential troublemakers before they can exercise their
potential to spread disinformation about the president,"]{.underline}
the aide explained, adding that Crown Prince Mohammad bin Salman
fulfilled a personal request from President Trump to use the team tasked
with silencing Saudi journalist and Washington Post contributor Jamal
Khashoggi in October of 2018. "[This isn't your run-of-the-mill
opposition research team; we're talking about an extremely capable group
of individuals,"]{.underline} the aide said. Tim Murtaugh, who serves as
communications director for the Trump 2020 presidential campaign, told
The Washington Times that campaign officials working in conjunction with
Saudi embassy staff have established an "unofficial joint operations
center" at the Trump International Hotel on Pennsylvania Avenue. [A
short walk from the White House, the luxurious 5-star hotel is
considered a "safe haven" for administration officials, Trump
supporters, and like-minded diplomats. The communications director said
hotel security has gone "above and beyond the call of duty" to prevent
audio and video surveillance. "]{.underline}It's probably the only hotel
in the world that is completely unbuggable," Murtaugh noted. In an ABC
News interview airing this week, President Trump said he would not
report election assistance from a foreign adversary to the FBI. "It's
called oppo research," he told ABC's George Stephanopoulos. He later
clarified his statement, saying he would report it if the information
provided turned out to be "incorrect.

### UQ -- Activists 

#### Activists have been [empirically successful]{.underline} at blocking arms shipments

**Monier, reporter for RT, 5/13** -- (Jean-Francois, RT, "'Why do we
fuel the war?' French peace activists manage to stop arms shipment to
Saudis -- report,"
<https://www.rt.com/news/458983-france-protest-arms-saudis/>) /ncp-aw

[A ship that was set to carry arms to Saudi]{.underline} Arabia [has
apparently left France without them, a day after a protest at
port]{.underline}. [Activists rallied to stop the delivery]{.underline},
saying the weapons could be used to slaughter civilians in Yemen. The
Bahri-Yanbu, a cargo ship that was meant to deliver the latest shipment
of French weapons to the Gulf kingdom arrived in the port Le Havre on
Thursday. Protesters gathered there [to denounce their government's
refusal to stop arms trade with Saudi Arabia]{.underline} after reports
revealed that French weapons have been used by Riyadh in its
four-year-long military campaign in neighboring Yemen. "Why do we
continue to feed countries that have a disrespectful international
behavior and why do we continue to fuel the war? The question should be
put to the President of the Republic," said National Assembly member
Jean-Yves Lecoq, who took part in the protest. **[On Friday, the ship
left the French coast and set sail to Spain without loading
arms]{.underline}** at Le Havre, Reuters reported citing local officials
and ship tracking data. [This]{.underline} apparently
[gives]{.underline} at least [a]{.underline} temporary [win for the
protesters.]{.underline} Earlier French Defense Minister Florence Parly
said the shipment did not pose a threat to people in Yemen and was
purely defensive. "As far as the French government is aware, we have no
proof that the victims in Yemen are the result of the use of French
weapons," Parly said in an interview with BFM. She wouldn't detail which
weapons the ship is to carry to the Saudis. The French government has
been criticized by rights activists for continued arms trade with the
Saudis despite a report by the investigative news site Disclose last
month. The site leaked a classified military memo, which said French
tanks and artillery were used in the war against Yemen's Houthi rebels.
Disclose said the upcoming shipment included eight truck-mounted Caesar
howitzers, but AFP news agency cited a government source as denying this
claim. Saudi Arabia led a coalition of Arab nations supported by the US
and the UK to intervene in Yemen in March 2015, after the Houthi ousted
a Riyadh-allied president from the country. The Saudis say the rebels
are backed by their archenemy Iran and have to be defeated to curb
Tehran's regional influence. The war led to what the UN calls the
largest humanitarian disaster in the world today, with coalition
airstrikes and blockades being a major contributing factor. Yemeni
civilians are suffering from shortages of food, medicine and fuel and
the devastation of infrastructure. They are also regularly killed or
injured by coalition airstrikes, which the Saudis insist to be
unintended collateral damage.

#### Empirically, political movements have challenged U.S. imperialism in Yemen

**Alwazir, researcher, human rights activist, citizen journalist,
co-founder of the media advocacy group Support Yemen,** **2016** --
(Atiaf Z., Mediterranean Politics, 21:1, "Yemen's enduring resistance:
youth between politics and informal mobilization," 170-191,
DOI:10.1080/13629395.2015.1081446,
<https://doi.org/10.1080/13629395.2015.1081446>) /ncp-aw

Although [the Marib Cause and al-Watan]{.underline} were not able to
directly influence Yemen's transformation process, their [potential
impact on the long-term polit-ical, social and cultural environment is
significant]{.underline}. Through their **[sustained alteration between
disruptive and peaceful actions]{.underline}**, these mobilized publics
**[pushed for concrete demands, pointed to neglected policy areas and
initiated socio-cultural changes]{.underline}**, such as in power
relations between tribal leaders and their constituencies, and advanced
the introduction of youth as new political actors. They also insisted on
the need to focus on socio-economic priorities. [These
mobilizations]{.underline} occurred in an environment where direct
intervention by the GCC, notably Saudi Arabia, and the United States had
been prevalent (durac, 2012: 168) and by so doing, they [challenged the
political processes and insti-tutions perceived to have been imposed
rather than home-grown and called into question attempts to control and
channel bottom-up pressure for change.]{.underline} The two cases
represent levels of popular mobilization specific to an excep-tional
time. The Marib Cause may not be sustainable over the long term and will
remain subject to elite dynamics. Still, the urge for self-realization
and the vision of a just social order that defined the spirit of the
2011 and the original Marib Cause protests have been preserved through
contentious action that sustained a collective identity by [shaping a
new political environment in which contention was normalized, engraved
in the culture and communicated socially.]{.underline} As this
collective experience pushes on, and [as the model of a new kind of
political party develops]{.underline}, epitomized by al-Watan, [ideals
of transparency, inclusion and justice will be shared and further spread
and hence embedded in the memories of those calling for
change]{.underline}. This will create a permanent repository of
resistance and repertoires of contention with which political elites
will have to reckon. The rise of Ansarullah through armed struggle has
led to questioning of the effectiveness of peaceful resistance and a
larger debate on the legitimate use of violence, but the toll of the
armed conflict on individual citizens, families and their livelihoods
will lead many to hold on to [peaceful struggle as the only means of
long-term sustainable transformation.]{.underline} In the end, **[the
possibility of genuine transformation through structural reform and
social pacts will depend on sustained pressure by mobilized publics on
political elites.]{.underline}**

#### The anti-war movement is gaining momentum -- but it's [uniquely vulnerable]{.underline} to being coopted by right-wing isolationists

**May, organizer with ACORN, the IAF, and the SEIU, 17** -- (Daniel, The
Nation, 03-16-17, "How to Revive the Peace Movement in the Trump Era,"
<https://www.thenation.com/article/how-to-revive-the-peace-movement-in-the-trump-era/>)
/ncp-aw

The rhetoric of [anti-imperialism has come to signal a politics confined
to the academy, anarchist bookstores, and the drum circles at various
protests]{.underline}. The question of whether a country could rule over
others without cost to its democratic principles used to be hotly
contested. **[Opposition to American empire, however, has deep roots in
our politics]{.underline}**. [The Anti-Imperialist League was founded in
1898]{.underline} to oppose American annexation of the Philippines and
featured a former governor of Massachusetts as its president[. Abraham
Lincoln, William Jennings Bryan, and Mark Twain were all avowed anti-
imperialists---as were W.E.B. Du Bois and Martin Luther King
Jr.]{.underline} (and The Nation). Before the two world wars and the
Cold War, the question of whether a country founded on self-rule could
rule over others without cost to its democratic principles was hotly
contested. American empire today functions through subtler means than
annexation, [but the future of the antiwar movement]{.underline} (or the
peace movement, or whatever it comes to be called) [will be determined
by whether this tradition can be revived]{.underline}. While this might
strike some as naive, **[the shifting sands of our politics should
unsettle those tempted to dismiss the possibility]{.underline}**. The
[assault on corporate globalization]{.underline} that provided much of
the energy behind both Donald Trump's and Bernie Sanders's campaigns
[carried with it an implicit critique of the military
infrastructure]{.underline} upon which much of the global economy
depends. [Sanders]{.underline} used a primary debate stage, amazingly,
to [attack Henry Kissinger]{.underline} for working to overthrow
Cambodia's Prince Sihanouk. And though he was a loathsome vehicle for
the message, [when Trump asked whether the United States should provide
defense services for Germany, Japan, and South Korea, when he questioned
whether we should remain in NATO, and when he lamented the disaster of
the Iraq War, **he raised issues familiar to critics of American
empire**]{.underline}. [Among the many alarming lessons of this election
was that **strong criticism of a globalized
military**]{.underline}---[traditionally the ground of the
left]{.underline}---**[can be manipulated by a shrewd right-wing
demagogue. If progressives do not seize such ground, they will cede it
to the isolationist right.]{.underline}** Antiwar Organizing and the New
Movements Anyone who has spent time in the antiwar movement quickly
finds that [the tension that bedevils all progressive
politics]{.underline}---the one between policy-minded institutional
leaders and more radical activists driven by ideological
commitments---[is particularly acute in the realm of foreign
policy.]{.underline} The brutality of violence and repression in places
like Syria, for example, leads some to sympathize with what has come to
be called "humanitarian intervention," while others see in those same
circumstances evidence of the catastrophic results of a misconceived
prior entanglement. The upshot is that apart from opposition to
large-scale wars like the one in Iraq, progressives as a whole have
little shared agenda when it comes to America's role in the world. In
speaking with organizers and activists about the future of the peace
movement, these tensions were ever-present. Many older activists
lamented that issues of militarism had become marginal to the broader
progressive agenda. And yet most of the younger leaders with whom I
spoke described the target of their struggles as inseparable from
America's global policy. The reason for this gulf, it became clear, is
that each defines the problem differently. [The traditional antiwar left
defines itself in opposition to, well, war]{.underline}. [Many younger
leaders, on the other hand, are challenging the brutality of an empire
that serves the interests of capital and perpetuates white
supremacy]{.underline}. "We know the same companies that are building
our prisons are the ones building our bases," said Ahmad Abuznaid,
co-founder of the Dream Defenders, a Miami-based racial-justice
organization. "**[If one wanted to organize folks in the US that
understand the destructive impact of American militarization, immigrants
would be a good place to start]{.underline}**," [said]{.underline} Sofia
[Campos, former board chair of United We Dream.]{.underline} Max
[Berger]{.underline}, an organizer in the Occupy movement who is
[currently helping to launch #AllOfUs, a project to organize millennials
behind a radical progressive agenda]{.underline}, captured the
perspective of many young activists: "Do we want to be a country where
people can go to college without being in debt their whole lives, or do
we want to have hundreds of military bases around the world that protect
the corporate interests of the elites that own our government? **[Do we
want an empire, or a democracy?"]{.underline}** This orientation
challenges the prevailing liberal consensus. The platform released last
year by more than 50 organizations involved in [the Movement for Black
Lives]{.underline}, and the response it provoked, is indicative of the
dynamic. "America is an empire that uses war to expand territory and
power," the platform declares. It calls for a cut in the military budget
by 50 percent, the closing of all foreign US military bases, and an end
to military support for Israel's "genocide." In tying the struggle for
racial justice locally with America's global military policy, the
platform [inspired those seeking to connect domestic injustice with
global issues]{.underline}. (It also outraged some who wondered why a
movement to achieve racial justice was addressing the Israeli
occupation.) **[The perspective of these new movements creates both
opportunities and challenges for those committed to
demilitarization.]{.underline}** If a mass movement to combat militarism
emerges, it will likely do so in the same manner as other contemporary
movements shaking and shaping progressive politics: not by any existing
advocacy institutions, but by a groundswell of grassroots organizing
energy. As Heather Hurlburt, director of the New Models of Policy Change
initiative, put it, in striking words from a leader at a DC think tank,
"The progressive foreign policy agenda will not be shaped by us here in
DC. It will be made by those young folks organizing in the streets." Yet
today, engagement between the peace camp and the millennial movements
follows a coalition model, as antiwar organizers reach out to other
movements for support. Rashad Robinson, director of Color of Change,
reflected that in the wake of the 2014 protests in Ferguson, Missouri,
"you had all these folks jump on the anti-militarization bandwagon---as
if the problem was just the military equipment, and not the police using
them." For people in the Movement for Black Lives, "that just confirmed
that these activists care more about their pet issue than about actual
black bodies that are getting brutalized." Moving forward, the agenda
will emerge with the relationships. "We know the same
companies...building our prisons are the ones building our bases."
---Ahmad Abuznaid, Dream Defenders In the work of building those
relationships, the leadership of those hit hardest by America's foreign
policy will prove particularly important: military veterans, some 20 of
whom commit suicide every day; refugees, many of whom have fled
countries decimated by US attacks or invasions; and Muslim Americans,
who suffer the humiliations of Islamophobia on a daily basis. Groups
like Military Families Speak Out, Veterans for Peace, Iraq Veterans
Against the War, VoteVets.org, and more recent initiatives like Beyond
the Choir need to be supported and strengthened. The same goes for
organizing in the Arab-American and refugee communities. So far, the
lens of anti-imperialism provides a paradigm for many movements, but not
yet a program. A strong case can be made that in fighting the violence
unleashed on black bodies over the past four decades by the War on Crime
and the War on Drugs---wars fought with some of the same equipment with
which we have fought more distant conflicts---the Movement for Black
Lives has become the most powerful antiwar movement in America. But on
its own, that movement will not dismantle a structure that demands such
an oversupply of MRAPs (mine-resistant, ambush-protected vehicles) that
they end up parked in the lots of over 500 police departments. Such an
effort will require that some of the younger leaders coming up in
contemporary justice movements make the struggle against militarism
central to their program, not just their analysis. Those organizers who
make this their life's labor will find ways of exposing the cost and
waste of imperialism, organizing against those who profit from it, and
offering a clear choice between global military expansion and a
democracy that serves its citizens. Perhaps their work will be framed by
the profit made from killing, or by the costs of our globalized
military, or by the disastrous consequences of foreign entanglements.
Perhaps it will target particular institutions that benefit from the
corrosive connections between racism, militarism, and oil; perhaps it
will expose how a culture of violence abroad is manifested in a culture
of violence at home. Perhaps it will be led by veterans, or by refugees,
or by women, who bear the brunt of so much American violence. All of
these directions, and more, will have to be attempted, tested,
grown---and supported by funders, many of whom, after Obama's election,
turned away from a focus on war and militarism. (For its part, the
Colombe Foundation is launching a new fund to support such organizing
and inviting other funders to join. The fund will support, among other
projects, a series of trainings on militarism for movement leaders
across the country and a coordinated campaign to address police
militarization.) **[Whatever shape this organizing takes, it will run
into the question that faces all oppositional politics: What alternative
is on offer?]{.underline}** [This dilemma is particularly acute when it
comes to American empire, opposition to which can easily devolve into a
nativist isolationism.]{.underline} There is a long history to that
trend---many leaders in the Anti-Imperialist League of the late 19th
century were as racist as the imperialists, arguing that the browner
populations of the Philippines and Puerto Rico didn't have the racial
composition required for liberty. There are two possible alternatives to
American global hegemony, whose decline has perhaps been prematurely
declared but is nonetheless on the wane. In one, the nativist impulse
prevails and we have an even larger military, contained in a nation
surrounded by walls and protected by travel bans. In the other, the
United States embraces a true internationalism, working to build
institutions to which it will also be accountable. At the moment, it may
be difficult to imagine this latter path. But these past months have
given us a glimpse of the consequences that await us if we fail to
capture the anger that so many harbor toward an American empire that
exacts such terrible costs and benefits so few. Nothing is promised in
politics. Movements rise and fall, truth-tellers often lose, xenophobic
nationalists sometimes gain power, cowards frequently prevail. There is
no determined arc to our history; no guaranteed results have been
foretold. But **[at no moment over the past half-century has there been
such an opportunity to ask whether our empire serves our democracy or
undermines it]{.underline}**. The question is whether those committed to
a less brutal, less violent, more just, more equal country can muster
the imagination, anger, courage, and energy to seize it. .

### UQ -- Congress

#### Even if political activism doesn't change politicians' minds, it [holds them accountable]{.underline} and prevents [abuses of power]{.underline}

**Appy, history professor at MIT, 95** -- (Christian, John Hopkins
University Press, *Reviews in American History* Vol. 23 No. 1 (Mar.
1995), pp. 137-143, <https://www.jstor.org/stable/2703249>) /ncp-aw

[The most convincing evidence Wells presents on the impact of the
antiwar movement is the internal memoranda and oral histories of
administration officials,]{.underline} **[demonstrating that they viewed
the antiwar movement as a serious threat,]{.underline}** however much
they sometimes tried to trivialize it in public. Few policymakers were
led to question the essential legitimacy of the American war, but th**[e
movement made virtually all officials perceive a compelling need to
reduce the war\'s political costs]{.underline}**. Both Johnson and Nixon
viewed [domestic dissent as a **fundamental challenge to their ideology,
policy, and power**]{.underline}. It also posed specific political
problems (e.g., eroding Johnson\'s liberal base and undermining Nixon\'s
promise to restore \"law-and-order\"). Both presidents realized that
deceit was essential if they were to prolong and expand the war and
contain popular opposition. To be sure, a \"bombing pause\" here and
\"negotiations\" there were not enough to clear the streets of
protesters. But the government did cynically regard such measures as
ways to buy time and to \"prepare\" the general public for further
escalations. As Daniel Ellsberg put it in the documentary film \"Hearts
and Minds\" (1974): \"It is a tribute to the American people that their
leaders perceived that they had to be lied to. It\'s no tribute to us
that it was so easy to fool the public.\" The anguish and
disillusionment reflected in Ellsberg\'s comment is consistent with the
wartime feelings of many of the activists profiled in The War Within.
Wells does a nice job conveying their mounting frustration as the war
continued, year after year, and the relationship between demoralization,
sectarianism, and the development of more radical ideologies and
tactics. In some ways, however, [this book is intended as an antidote
for cynicism and resignation]{.underline}. A central element of Wells\'s
thesis is that **[the antiwar movement was much more effective than it
realized]{.underline}**. Had activists simply understood the impact they
were having inside the White House, he suggests, they might have avoided
a good deal of divisive factionalism, time-wasting debate, and
spirit-sapping discouragement. Wells is there on the sidelines, his
interpretation serving as a kind of quiet cheerleading, not yelling, but
chanting, in effect: \"[Don\'t get down. Keep it up. You\'re making a
difference. **The White House is feeling the pressure. Stick together
and stop squabbling about tactics. Everything is useful-letter writing,
vigils, mass rallies, civil disobedience-it all helps. Change takes
patience and time**]{.underline}.\" Some will find this too sunny a view
to place alongside the vast wreckage of the war, yet Wells\'s [idealism
is]{.underline}, in some measure, [vindicated by the movement\'s own
surprising resilience]{.underline}. Just when it seems sure to implode,
a victim of the government\'s counteroffensive, internal strife, and
demoralization, a new burst of antiwar energy emerges (e.g., the general
campus strike of 1970 following the invasion of Cambodia, the Vietnam
Veterans Against the War protest of 1971-Operation Dewey Canyon III-and
the May Day demonstration that followed, and the various protests that
arose in response to Nixon\'s escalations in the spring of 1972).
Particularly welcome is the skillful way Wells weaves together the
history of the war and the history of the antiwar movement. Sometimes he
settles for mere juxtaposition rather than sufficient analysis of the
relationship, but he nonetheless conveys a strong visceral sense of the
inextricable connection between the war abroad and the war at home.

#### The state is key to effectively engage and protect the Yemeni professional diaspora

**Abdoueldahab, visiting fellow at the Brookings Doha Center researching
transitional justice in the Arab region, 4/26** -- (Noha, Brookings Doha
Center, "Reclaiming Yemen: The Role of the Yemeni Professional
Diaspora,"

/ncp-aw

Whether through the production of scholarly research at think tanks in
Lebanon, the United States, Turkey, and the United Kingdom, or through
art exhibits in Berlin and Paris, [the Yemeni professional diaspora has
unparalleled access to international policymakers, governments,
organizations, media, and cultural institutions]{.underline}.
**[Unfortunately, this access has rarely translated to
influence]{.underline}**. International [policymakers]{.underline} in
foreign governments, the United Nations, and the European Union [must
meaningfully partner with Yemeni professional diaspora
members]{.underline} to formulate policies. These partnerships should
not just aim to end the war, but also [to ensure that post-conflict
governance building is conducted in a way that addresses the needs and
wishes of Yemenis in all their diversity]{.underline}. The impact of the
war in Yemen is not confined to the country. The war's devastating
humanitarian toll, the vast grievances endured by Yemenis, and the high
level of insecurity have all had dire regional and international
consequences. The proxies that have thrived in the power vacuum created
by the war have succeeded in exploiting the rampant corruption and war
economy from which all parties to the conflict benefit. [The process of
addressing these political and economic voids can and should involve
Yemenis]{.underline} both inside and outside of Yemen, [and particularly
those who have sustained an active engagement with their country's
affairs]{.underline}. As this paper has demonstrated, there is no
shortage of such Yemenis, but, **[unfortunately, they continue to be
marginalized, and they struggle to effectively mobilize in policymaking
that affects Yemen]{.underline}**. Despite a certain level of
disillusionment with the United Nations' past political mediation role,
many Yemenis agree that Griffiths, the U.N. special envoy for Yemen,
continues to play an important role. This belief has primarily to do
with ending the current war. It is unclear, however, who could take on a
domestic leadership role to bring Yemen back on its feet, especially
given the "breakdown of Yemen's social fabric," and the perceived
weakness of Hadi, who runs his presidency in exile.80[It is]{.underline}
therefore [imperative that Yemenis inside and outside of Yemen are
provided with safe spaces in which they can address their differences,
identify areas of agreement, and begin working toward rebuilding their
state and society immediately, without having to wait for the war to
end]{.underline}. Donors and international institutions that are not
involved in the current war are well placed to make such spaces
available on a continuous basis. These institutions include foreign
ministries, as well as research institutes and cultural organizations.
The dialogue that such spaces generate must not be confined to
high-level political actors, who are often not representative of the
diverse identities and socioeconomic backgrounds of Yemenis.
Participants should include local actors from all parts of the country,
women from rural and urban areas, Yemeni civil society members,
scholars, former politicians, and artists.81Christian Testot, the French
ambassador to Yemen, characterizes the way in which many diplomatic
missions to Yemen operate outside of the country for security reasons as
a far-from-ideal form of "nomadic diplomacy." He warns that "The risk
is, as the conflict lasts, of losing contact with reality in the form of
'hotel lobby diplomacy' which only the resumption of negotiations
between all the parties, a condition of a return to the country, could
avert."82 While this may be true for high-level negotiations, it does
not necessarily have to be the case for much-needed engagement at the
professional and grassroots levels. Finally, [foreign governments must
work to prevent illicit intelligence gathering that targets Yemenis
abroad]{.underline}. Such global surveillance has created a climate of
fear, pushing some Yemeni diaspora members to retreat from activism in
order to avoid violent repercussions. As discussed, [this presents a
serious obstacle to the effective mobilization of Yemenis, thereby
aggravating the lack of Yemeni decision-making power]{.underline}. It
also restricts their ability to practice the constitutional rights
afforded them by their host countries. Major differences aside, none of
the Yemenis interviewed expressed a belief that the war requires a
military solution.83 **[All interviewees stressed the need for an
immediate ceasefire, followed by an inclusive state-building process
that is led by Yemenis without foreign meddling.]{.underline}** [They
deemed partnerships with]{.underline} international donors,
[governments, and policymaking institutions as crucial]{.underline}, but
emphasized that these must not trump the needs identified by Yemenis
embedded in their country as well as by those in the diaspora who have
been actively engaged in Yemeni politics.Accessibility to Yemen remains
severely limited by the ongoing war. Yemenis outside of Yemen, however,
are an immediately accessible and indispensable resource for
international policymakers to enhance their impact during the conflict,
transitional, and post-conflict periods. Rather than present policy
recommendations for conflict resolution in Yemen, this paper instead
foregrounds a largely overlooked set of actors---the Yemeni professional
diaspora---whose political engagement continues to be overshadowed by a
misinformed and disinterested international community. It is their
policy recommendations, informed by locally-based Yemenis and supported
by partnerships with international actors, that should be at the center
of reclaiming Yemen

#### "Homeland repression" prevents members of the Yemeni diaspora from political engagement now -- the state's key to stop it

While tensions within diasporas are common, political divisions among
the Yemeni diaspora are compounded by a number of factors. Dana M. Moss
explains that Yemeni communities outside of Yemen experience challenges
in mobilizing to send humanitarian aid to their home country. This is
because of disagreements concerning "who has the right to speak and
mobilize for the relief effort and where aid should be directed," in
addition to counterterrorism measures that prevent effective
humanitarian mobilization.23 For example, Yemenis who reside in the
United States fear that financial remittances to their relatives in
Yemen will be "mistaken as support for terrorism," especially following
[the Muslim travel ban]{.underline} imposed by President Donald Trump,
which [includes a ban on Yemenis wishing to enter the
U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates.24 Moss argues that the
[curtailment of minority rights in the name of the war against terrorism
has directly impacted "Yemenis' collective abilities and willingness to
resource relief efforts across borders."]{.underline}25 For one of the
world's worst humanitarian crises, this presents a significant obstacle
to the delivery of much-needed aid. Since the anti-government Arab
uprisings of 2011, the literature on Arab diaspora mobilization has
grown significantly.26 In addition to analyzing political divisions and
tensions among diaspora community members, scholars have identified a
number of other challenges that these individuals face in effectively
mobilizing to improve the situations in their home countries. For
example, "[**homeland repression" often extends across borders in the
form of global surveillance and threats**, pushing diaspora members to
refrain from engaging in any kind of mobilization or political
activity.]{.underline}27 In her discussion of extraterritorial
authoritarian practices, Marlies Glasius examines the inclusion of
diaspora actors "as subjects," rather than as "citizens," of
authoritarian states.28 The result is that authoritarian states extend
the reach of their repressive practices to such "subjects"
transnationally, as a way for governments to assert "authority 'as if '
the subject\[s\] were still on \[their\] territory."29As Emma Lundgren
Jörum observes in her discussion of the Syrian diaspora in Sweden, one
consequence of this transterritorial repression is that "citizens with
roots in certain authoritarian states are effectively discouraged from
exercising their constitutional rights."30 This means that [diaspora
members wishing to influence policies affecting their home countries
must first weigh the consequences of doing so]{.underline}, particularly
if the home state regimes engage in this sort of transnational
repression. Most troubling, however, is that the increasing use of
[threats, global surveillance, and illicit intelligence
gathering]{.underline} to monitor the activities of diaspora members
**[restricts the ability of these individuals to fully engage in
political mobilization, no matter how peaceful]{.underline}**. Attempts
to coordinate and influence policies that affect their home countries
thus become exceedingly difficult. Such surveillance also directly
threatens the lives of the relatives of diaspora members who still
reside in the home country.31 The Yemeni professional diaspora has not
been immune to this kind of global surveillance and
intimidation.Moreover, intra-diaspora distrust and polarization
exacerbate this lack of mobilization.32 Cecilia Baeza and Paulo Pinto's
discussion about the pro-Bashar Assad Syrian diaspora in Argentina and
Brazil demonstrates how [layers of intimidation, sectarian polarization,
and political division complicate prospects for effective mobilization
of the anti-Assad diaspora]{.underline}. Pro-Assad Syrians in Argentina
and Brazil have, to a certain extent, succeeded in soliciting support
from Brazilian and Argentinian government officials for the Syrian
regime. This part of the Syrian diaspora, Baeza and Pinto contend,
[exploited anti-imperialist sentiment in Latin America as a catalyst for
pro-Assad mobilization]{.underline}. The "'anti-imperialist' struggle of
the Syrian regime," they continue, "found eager interlocutors in the
Argentinean and Brazilian political landscapes."33 This argument was
made in the context of the impending U.S. military intervention in Syria
in 2013, following the chemical attack in the Ghouta area surrounding
the Syrian city of Damascus. [By framing Western military intervention
as imperial, pro-Assad Syrians won the sympathy of powerful individuals
in their host countries' governments.]{.underline}Baeza and Pinto's
illuminating discussion focuses on the more established Syrian diaspora
in Argentina and Brazil, which exerted significant influence over the
political views of these countries' governments. Still, Moss' empirical
study on Syrian diaspora mobilization found that other diaspora members
were supportive of Western military intervention. Such intervention (in
the form of no-fly zones, as opposed to the ground troops and invasion
that characterized the U.S. military intervention in Iraq) was deemed
necessary to help address the immediate urgency of saving lives.34 Moss
demonstrates that [many of those who supported Western military
intervention in Syria also professed their anti-imperialist
dispositions, with Western intervention perceived "as the best bad
option" to help the revolution's cause]{.underline}.35 Divisions within
diasporas, then, emerge on different social and political levels. They
can shift depending on the length of time individuals within the
diaspora have resided outside their home countries, as well as on the
strength of their relationships with host country governments. The media
is another factor that influences policymaking. Literature on the
relationship between the media's issue-framing role and policymaking is
robust.36Scholars believe that the media can have a powerful impact on
the policy process, especially as it "can establish the nature, sources,
and consequences of policy issues in ways that fundamentally change not
just the attention paid to those issues, but the different types of
policy solutions sought."37 Indeed, as Stuart Soroka et al. argue,
"Policymakers are not simply affected by issue framing in the media, but
they actively engage in policy framing."38 Less prevalent is research on
how diaspora members engage with the media to influence policies
affecting their home countries. The next section aims to address this
gap in the literature by outlining how the Yemeni professional diaspora
has prioritized the use of media in order to shape its agenda-setting
and issue-framing roles regarding the conflict in Yemen.

#### Congressional sentiment against the war in Yemen is growing -- key to ending U.S. complicity and rebuilding Yemen

**Malley and Pomper, President and CEO of the International Crisis Group
and Director of Crisis Group's U.S. program, 4/5** -- (Robert and
Stephen, The Atlantic, "Yemen Cannot Afford to Wait,"
<https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2019/04/us-culpable-yemens-tragedy/586558/>)
/ncp-aw

For an American who had a hand in shaping U.S. Mideast policy during the
Barack Obama years, [coming to Yemen has the unpleasant feel of visiting
the scene of a tragedy one helped co-write]{.underline}. It is a scene
whose most heartrending aspects are not easily accessible to a visitor.
It is still possible to travel north, to the war-battered capital,
Sanaa, now controlled by the Houthi insurgent group, or up the Red Sea
coast, where a catastrophic struggle for control over the port city of
Hodeidah still looms, but it's a challenge. So when one of us recently
ventured into the country, the journey went no farther than Aden, the
southern port city over which the internationally recognized government
regained control early in the conflict with the help of a Saudi-led
coalition. Aden does not bear wounds witnessed elsewhere: the spread of
cholera, 80 percent of the population requiring humanitarian assistance,
and a large number threatened with famine. Yet even there, signs of war
abound. Aden today is faring better than many other Yemeni cities, and
security there is much improved compared with even six months ago, but
the bar is low. Many buildings were hit, some completely destroyed, only
very few repaired after the Houthis were pushed out. Along with the
physical scars are security ones. Rival forces and militias man
checkpoints. Parts of the city are controlled by government forces,
others by the Security Belt, a separatist-leaning armed group backed by
the United Arab Emirates nominally falling under the Yemeni government;
the two sides fought a brief but bitter battle a little over a year ago,
which concluded with an uneasy truce. And along with the physical and
security scars are political ones. Southern separatists chafe under a
government that they see as an obstacle in the way of their ultimate
goal. Asked whom they consider their most dangerous long-term enemy,
they are more likely to mention Islah, the Islamist movement that is
part of the government with which they are nominally allied, than the
Houthis, the group with which they are formally at war. Some hint that
they could not care less who rules the north as long as they are left
alone in the south; if the Houthis were to extend a hand, they might
find takers. The separatists bide their time but leave no doubt: They
will regain the independence the south enjoyed between the eviction of
the British in 1968 and unity with North Yemen in 1990 peacefully, or
they will achieve it by force. [Much of the world is focused on the
conflict unfolding farther north]{.underline}, and with good reason;
it's the one generating today's worst humanitarian catastrophe, and the
one that still could plunge millions into famine. [But ending that war
will not end Yemen's war]{.underline}. The U.S. contribution to this
tragedy has been a step removed from the battlefield. The task of
fighting and bombing has been carried out by locals, America's Gulf
allies, and others paid by the coalition for their labors. But
**[however indirectly the U.S. might be culpable for the calamity
befalling Yemen, it is culpable nonetheless]{.underline}**. The roots of
the country's failure go deep: from Sanaa's repeated neglect of Houthi
and southern grievances, to Yemeni elites' betrayal of the promises of
the 2011 uprising, to President Abdu Rabbu Mansour Hadi's ineffective
and corrupt governance before the war, to the Houthis' toppling of the
government in late 2014 and subsequent conquest of the rest of the
country, and finally to the Saudi-led coalition's reaction to that move
in the aftermath. At so many of these turns, [the U.S. arguably
mishandled its response. From the outset, it focused on the fight
against al-Qaeda. That blurred its vision of Hadi's
failings]{.underline} and helped it miss the fact that, however obliging
a counterterrorism partner he might have been, he widely was perceived
by Yemenis as having let them down as their nation's leader. But at none
of those turns was the price ultimately to be paid higher than in [the
American decision to support the coalition's battle]{.underline}. Why
the U.S. got entangled in this war---and why a president so determined
to keep the country out of another Mideast military mess nonetheless got
caught in this one---makes for a painful story. In March 2015, Saudi
Arabia came to the U.S. with a request for support in a campaign it
vowed to conduct regardless. After that, and although events took place
a mere four years ago, memories blur. In our conversations, [many former
U.S. officials found it hard to recall what precisely the Saudis asked
for, what specific commitments the administration made in response, and
when certain types of assistance started to flow.]{.underline} Some,
including one of us who attended the deliberations, recall a deeply
ambivalent president who green-lit U.S. support but insisted it be
confined to the defense of Saudi territory and not extend to the war
against the Houthis. Others don't recall hearing about that instruction,
and struggle to reconcile it with what the U.S. actually did during the
war---including refueling coalition sorties and replenishing weapons
stocks. Yet all agree [the decision ultimately came without much
debate]{.underline}. The reason, at bottom, was straightforward: Here
was a partner (Saudi Arabia) seeking help in restoring a government
(President Hadi's) that the U.S. regarded as legitimate and a loyal ally
in the war against al-Qaeda. That government had been toppled by an
insurgent group (the Houthis or Ansar Allah); although the extent of its
ties to Iran was debatable and debated, their existence was
indisputable. Plus, all this came at a time when relations between
Washington and Riyadh already were deeply damaged by disagreements over
the Obama administration's response to the Arab uprisings and, even more
so, its negotiations over a nuclear deal with Tehran. As Riyadh saw it,
doing nothing would mean permitting control by a Hezbollah-like
organization of its southern border, ensconcing a perpetual threat.
Rebuffing the Saudi request at any time likely would have provoked a
serious crisis in Saudi-U.S. bilateral relations. Doing so while the
U.S. was seeking a landmark agreement with the kingdom's sworn enemy
could have brought them to a breaking point. That was a risk even a
president skeptical of the wisdom of Saudi policies and willing to call
into question elements of the relationship was not prepared to take. Had
he known how long the war would last, and how costly it would be,
perhaps Obama would have reached a different decision. As his presidency
came to a close, the U.S. took a limited and belated step to mark its
distance, halting the provision to Saudi Arabia of certain weapons. Even
these modest qualms are not, apparently, shared by his successor. If,
under Obama, support assumed the form of enabling the campaign, under
President Donald [Trump]{.underline}, it [has taken the costlier shape
of encouraging and emboldening those who prosecute it, framing the
conflict as just one more front in the battle against Iran.]{.underline}
Secretary of State Mike Pompeo has claimed that the deaths in Yemen are
not "because of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia." Days later, the Saudi Air
Force hit a Save the Children--backed hospital in northern Yemen,
killing seven. While some members of [Congress]{.underline} initially
criticized the Obama administration for not doing more to help the
coalition, the legislature [has since lost its patience for the
war.]{.underline} With each congressional vote, the clamor for an end to
U.S. backing for the coalition (which includes intelligence sharing,
arms sales, the sustainment of weapons systems, and---until it was
recently suspended---refueling aircraft) becomes louder. Both houses of
Congress have passed with bipartisan support a bill that would require
the U.S. to withdraw its forces from hostilities in Yemen, the first
time this has happened since Congress enacted the War Powers Resolution
in 1973. It will almost certainly face a presidential veto, so it likely
will go no further. Still, it would be hard to argue that it was for
naught. **[Congressional sentiment was a principal reason
that]{.underline}** then--Defense Secretary Jim [**Mattis pressured
Saudi Arabia and the UAE to get their Yemeni allies to sign on to the
United Nation--brokered Stockholm Agreement**, halting what would have
been a catastrophic coalition-backed attack]{.underline} to retake the
Red Sea port of Hodeidah from the Houthis. Judging from our
conversations in Aden and Riyadh, the message sent by Congress has not
been well received. In both places, it is simultaneously dismissed as a
symptom of anti-Trump fervor and denounced as counterproductive.
Officials in those countries don't understand how Americans cannot
comprehend that such signals will embolden the Houthis and Iran,
convincing them that they need only wait for U.S. pressure to force an
end to the coalition's military effort, thereby handing Tehran a victory
when it was on the cusp of a major defeat. Sitting around qat chews in
Aden, Yemenis speak angrily of the Houthi threat and of their zeal to
eliminate it. They say this with the intent of persuading their American
guests to stay the course and help them destroy their enemy, when their
every word conjures the sort of bloodbath that most Americans would find
abhorrent. As Saudi officials see it, to let the Houthis prevail would
send shock waves across the Arab world; to repulse them would hand Iran
a major military defeat. But they can't explain how continuing the war
will bring them any closer to that goal, when four years of fighting has
only solidified and deepened the partnership between Tehran and the
Houthis. They find it hard to accept that, [for many Americans, enabling
"victory" in this country]{.underline} where 20 million already are food
insecure and 80 percent live below the poverty line [looks a lot like
provoking mass starvation]{.underline}. And they have trouble
understanding that **[a growing number in Congress no longer wish to be
complicit]{.underline}**. The question today is less how the U.S. got
into this mess than how it can end this war even if the coalition's
original ambitions (militarily defeating the Houthis, eliminating all
Iranian influence in the country) will not be achieved. Step one is to
avoid a battle for Hodeidah. The coalition long has believed that
seizing the port city would deal the insurgents a decisive blow,
depriving them of the money they collect in taxes and of smuggled
weapons. But the most crushing blow would be to Yemeni civilians, 10
million of whom depend on goods arriving in the port city. In December
2018, under international pressure and still reeling from the
aftershocks of the Saudi murder of Jamal Khashoggi, the coalition
assented to a pause; the UN special envoy negotiated an agreement
between the Houthis and the Yemeni government in Stockholm, with both
sides committing to withdraw from the port city and its environs. Today,
that agreement is on life support, as all sides exploit ambiguities in
the text as to who would run the city once military forces evacuate. The
same pressure that was used to reach the Stockholm Agreement in the
first place will be needed to ensure that the parties immediately
implement its most important part---getting fighters to withdraw so that
humanitarian goods can flow and the risk of a confrontation ebbs, if
need be postponing the question of who will rule the city and the port
until later. A deal on Hodeidah would mitigate the war's impact, but it
would not end the conflict between the coalition and the Houthis. That
would require, for starters, an understanding between Saudi Arabia and
the insurgent group on principles governing their future relationship.
Is it possible? To listen to some Houthis, the answer is: Yes. Their
response may well be deceptive, but they sound a remarkably reassuring
note. Asked about Saudi concerns regarding their ties to Iran and
threats to Saudi territory, they don't miss a beat; those ties are an
outgrowth of the war and will loosen once the war with Riyadh is over,
they insist, and any attacks they waged on Saudi Arabia are a direct
reaction to Saudi operations and will end the moment the airstrikes do.
They acknowledge the kingdom's special role as Yemen's neighbor and say
they are prepared to forge privileged ties with it. To listen to the
Saudis, the answer is a skeptical no, at least for now. They have heard
Houthi promises before, they say, far too many of which were not kept.
They feel that a different balance of power first needs to be
established---by pressuring the Houthis militarily and politically; by
turning some of their supporters against them---before talks might yield
fruit. They say the time is not right. [Houthis expect cracks within the
coalition. Saudis anticipate cracks among the Houthis. They both can
afford to wait**. Yemen cannot**.]{.underline} The Houthis may well be
dissembling about how they view the kingdom, but this much seems true:
The long-term future of their northern Yemeni stronghold will depend on
Saudi Arabia's contribution, not Iran's. When guns fall silent, Riyadh
will possess the benefits of geographic proximity, abundant financial
resources, and tribal and familial ties. A proxy war between Iran and
Saudi Arabia plays to Tehran's advantage; it can invest little and, so
long as the Houthis survive, enjoy handsome returns as it watches Riyadh
expend blood, treasure, and reputation on a protracted conflict. An
economic tug-of-war between the two, though, plays to Riyadh's benefit.
It can dangle before the Houthis and their constituents the prospect of
reconstruction in a way that Tehran simply cannot. If the Saudis want
more pragmatic Houthis to stand up to more militant ones, they are far
likelier to achieve that goal through their economic leverage than by
waging a battle that unites the insurgent group in opposition. Alliances
fluctuate. In the 1960s, the kingdom helped the Zaydi-Shiite rulers of
northern Yemen against Egyptian-backed revolutionaries who sought to
overthrow their rule. In war, Iran has the advantage; in peace, it
cannot compete. Alongside a Saudi-Houthi negotiating track will need to
be an intra-Yemeni one. The Houthis will need to relinquish control over
areas presently under their sway, in exchange for a political and
security role disproportionate to their modest demographic weight. Those
talks cannot be reduced to a Yemeni government--Houthi tête-à-tête. The
southerners one of us recently met in Aden are not going away, nor are
the political parties and members of civil society shoved aside after
the 2011 uprising. They, too, will have to be part of inclusive peace
negotiations. A relatively loose, federal, decentralized Yemen likely
lies at the other end. There are echoes of Afghanistan in these imagined
Yemeni negotiations, with Saudis playing the U.S. role and Houthis cast
as the Taliban. In both cases, the insurgents do not wish to negotiate
with a local government they deem puppets of a foreign master (never
mind the irony of the Houthis vehemently rejecting the notion that they
are Iranian proxies while labeling all their Yemeni opponents stooges).
In both, they want to talk with the more powerful country they claim
pulls the strings. But in neither case can those talks be a substitute
for negotiations among national parties. Perhaps the smartest thing
Saudi Arabia could do would be to spearhead such a process, talking with
the Houthis, convening broader intra-Yemeni discussions, and together
with the UN and others, steering those toward a compromise outcome. And
[the smartest thing the U.S. could do would be to press the kingdom to
take that route, making]{.underline} plain that while it is prepared to
help defend Saudi Arabia against threats of sufficient gravity, [it will
have no more part of this conflict.]{.underline} The war will not end
the way Saudi Arabia envisaged it, but it can still end in a way that
Saudi Arabia can live with. The United States is left with painful
questions: What would have happened if it had rejected the Saudis'
original pleas, or set tighter limits on its support, or exerted earlier
and more meaningful pressure on its partners? Whatever the answers, it
has now become party to a terrible war, and it is past time for the U.S.
to do all it can to stop it.

#### Political activism empirically [works]{.underline} to constrain, de-escalate, and end wars -- Vietnam proves

**Appy, history professor at MIT, 95** -- (Christian, John Hopkins
University Press, *Reviews in American History* Vol. 23 No. 1 (Mar.
1995), pp. 137-143, <https://www.jstor.org/stable/2703249>) /ncp-aw

On November 15, 1969, a half-million people gathered in Washington,
D.C., to demand an end to the Vietnam War. This \"Mobilization\" was, at
the time, the largest demonstration in American history.\'
[Earlier]{.underline} in the fall, President Richard [Nixon had insisted
that antiwar protest would change nothing]{.underline}. \"Under no
circumstances will I be affected whatever by it\" (p. 352). The only
college students he would acknowledge during the November \"Mobe\" were
the ones playing football on the tube. [His indifference was just
pretense.]{.underline} **[In fact, the White House was in a state of
emergency]{.underline}**. Outside, a solid ring of buses, parked
bumper-to-bumper, barricaded the Executive Mansion. Under- neath and
overhead, dozens of National Guardsmen and army troops filled the
tunnels and catwalks. From his command post in the White House bomb
shelter, \"Field Marshall\" John Ehrlichman was in direct communication
with police, FBI agents, and intelligence officers throughout the city.
And, as always, [Nixon wanted a steady stream of dispatches from the
antiwar front]{.underline}.2 White House preoccupation with the antiwar
movement is amply documented in The War Within, Tom Wells\'s
fascinating, well-researched, though somewhat bloated, chronicle of the
antiwar movement. [Under Johnson and Nixon alike, that preoccupation
frequently became obsessive and paranoid]{.underline}. \"The communists
are taking over the country,\" Johnson ranted in 1967 (p. 205), and
Nixon once demanded that a single picketer be removed from Lafayette
Park because he was annoyed by the protester\'s sign. [Both
administrations concocted hundreds of plans, not always executed, to
attack, spy on, infiltrate, sabotage, harass, imprison, smear, divide,
counteract, provoke, and placate the antiwar movement.]{.underline}
According to Wells, the movement was large and broad-based, dedicated
and bold, mostly nonviolent, ideologically diverse, and fully
indigenous. [From the outset, however, the government belittled its
size, denied its political and moral seriousness, exaggerated its
violence, and attributed its very existence to cowards, crazies, and
commies.]{.underline} The government\'s \"counteroffensive\" involved
methods that ranged from the base and criminal (e.g., the CIA\'s
Operation CHAOS-an illegal domestic spying program that lasted from 1967
to 1974) to the ludicrous (e.g., \"special consultant\" Bud Wilkinson,
former Oklahoma football coach, was hired by Nixon to provide advice on
wooing American youth). Prowar front groups such as Citizens Committee
for Peace with Freedom in Vietnam were established and funded to trumpet
the government\'s war policies. And if \"decent kids\" could not easily
be found to speak up and \"Tell it to Hanoi\" (the name of another
administration front group) there was always that older \"silent
majority\" of Americans for the White House cynically to court. While
some of the government\'s programs were no doubt merely feckless and
silly, [the counteroffensive as a whole probably broadened public
animosity toward the antiwar movement]{.underline} and is part of the
explanation for why opinion polls in the late 1960s found that a
majority of Americans opposed both the war and the antiwar protesters.
Although Wells offers excellent material on the federal government\'s
battle against the antiwar movement, he does not fully evaluate either
its impact on the movement or on public opinion. Of greater interest
here is the effect of the activists on the government. This brings us to
the core of Wells\'s thesis, one that is sometimes buried by the sheer
weight of narrative detail and oral history reminiscence. He contends
that [the antiwar movement did more than induce a bunker mentality in
the administrations of Johnson and Nixon. It did more, even, than prompt
the illegal surveillance, sabotage, and thuggery]{.underline} that, long
before the 1972 break-in at Democratic National Headquarters, was the
true origin of Watergate. Indeed, Wells claims **[the antiwar movement
was largely responsible for preventing a longer, bloodier, and more
far-reaching war. It \"played a major role in constraining,
de-escalating, and ending the war\"]{.underline}** (p. 4). His judgment
of the movement\'s success is slightly more qualified than that of Todd
Gitlin, who supplies a forward to this volume and advised Wells on his
Ph.D. thesis in sociology (this book is an expanded version of that
thesis). Even so, Wells concludes that \"the American Movement against
the Vietnam War was perhaps the most successful antiwar movement in
history\" (p. 579).3

#### Topic debate turns their offense- academic criticism has a time and place but this is the *war room*- even K authors agree policy relevant scholarship is crucial to avoid being ignored

**Newell and Stavrianakis, PhDs (neg hacks), 17**

(Peter, IR@Sussex and Anna, IR@Sussex) BEYOND THE "IVORY TOWER"? IR in
the world in What's the Point of International Relations ed. Dyvik,
Selby, and Wilkinson)

Several of the same themes emerge in [Stavrianakis' work on arms
transfer]{.underline} control. She, too, has worked with NGOs and
campaign organizations and [faced]{.underline} some of the same
[dilemmas]{.underline} and tensions. In her case, it was the process of
doing PhD research on NGO strategies in relation to the arms trade that
pushed her politically more toward the critical, "outsider" end of the
activist spectrum. The more she learnt about the arms trade, the more
oriented toward activism she became. Yet her experience has been that
academia provides the freedom and autonomous space to say things that
cannot be said in an NGO or campaigner capacity. In this sense, her
research is not directly for NGOs or campaigners. During interview work
for her research, for example, she was repeatedly struck by not only the
variety of opinions among NGO staffers, but how radical and critical the
views often were of those who worked within "insider" organizations. Yet
those "personal" views could not be translated into their organizations'
policy and strategy. This led her to think increasingly about the
structural disciplining of NGOs and about the ways that academic and
NGO/campaign research can be made to complement each other. [Over the
past decade or so, she has moved between oppositional activism and
questioning the **binary between theory and activism.**]{.underline} She
has experienced this as a recursive move in and out of engagement and in
and out of theory, in which activism and scholarship inform each other,
but remain distinct as social activities. This highlights the importance
of translation (Stavrianakis 2006) but also is suggestive of how varied
the political space is. Some arguments can be heard politically and are
thus ripe for direct policy activism, whereas others are beyond the
pale. For example, [a]{.underline} term's [sabbatical]{.underline} spent
in Saferworld's China team [led directly to **policy-relevant** briefi
ng papers]{.underline} -- welcomed, in part, because of the way the UK
government's Foreign and Commonwealth Offi ce has effectively outsourced
its research capacity to insider NGOs, given funding cuts and changes to
the character of the civil service. [Meanwhile, academic articles that
explore]{.underline} the ramifi cations of the [Arms Trade
Treaty]{.underline} for liberal states' arms transfer practice (e.g.,
Stavrianakis 2006, 2010, 2016) grew out of, and also shaped, engagement
with practitioners (diplomats, NGO staffers, experts) through
participant observation at NGO and diplomatic meetings. This sort of
work [has policy ramifications]{.underline}, **[but does not readily
lead to policy-relevant recommendations.]{.underline}** This is in
contrast to her research on the imperial relations of racialized gun
control and the problem of methodological nationalism. This sort of
research is too far removed from where the policy debate is to have any
practical application: the battle is so politicized that there is very
little space for engagement that broadens the boundaries. Hence, it is
harder to trace the impact of the latter on policy (whether of the
state, corporations, or NGOs): it is not obvious who the target audience
is or what immediate change might be possible. [There are
several]{.underline} key [practice-based issues]{.underline} that
[Stavrianakis]{.underline} has [found repeated]{.underline} over the
years. [These include]{.underline} [the importance of **paradigm
compatibility**]{.underline}, or [speaking **the same language** as
those with whom **scholars are engaging**]{.underline}. Given her
research trajectory and political orientation, this has been easier with
NGOs than with government departments, and within government, easier
with elements of the Foreign and Commonwealth Offi ce (FCO) and DfID
than the Ministry of Defence (MoD) or Department for Business,
Innovation and Skills (BIS), now split into International Trade, and
Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy. Relatedly, she has been faced
with the question of whether she is engaging with practitioners (whether
NGO or government) to infl uence them, to share knowledge with them, or
to conduct research on them. With some NGOs it has ended up being the
former two elements; with the MoD it has ended up being the latter. Even
with NGOs and campaign groups **[there are lines of argument beyond the
political pale or strategically beyond the bounds of what can usefully
be said.]{.underline}** [NGOs are often seen as the "good guys" against
governments, but their positions are **also circumscribed by
politics**]{.underline}. [This puts academics in a difficult position
when they are seen to criticize or not be on board with more progressive
actors]{.underline}. This often results in **[an "ivory
tower]{.underline}**" criticism. But to return to the model of
scholarship as practice outlined earlier, there remains a value in
academics' autonomous positioning to articulate uncomfortable positions
based on their research. On the other hand, [it is important to reflect
on the ways]{.underline} [academics are disciplined in a variety of
ways. For Stavrianakis, her experience has been one of wanting to be
seen as reliable, respectable, or reasonable]{.underline}: not only to
get access to the MoD, FCO, and other "hard" elements of the state, but
also **[to be able to talk to them]{.underline}**, for us to hear each
other. [Yet any listening or hearing is **always on their
terms**]{.underline}. Here the fiction of objectivity is useful but
troublesome and limited -- it is shot through with power relations.
[Attempting to use her position as an academic]{.underline} by acting
[as an expert witness]{.underline} in an Information Tribunal case
brought by an anti--arms trade activist, [she was repeatedly
accused]{.underline} by government barristers [of being a
mouthpiece]{.underline} for Campaign Against Arms Trade -- an anti-arms
group with whom she has developed a relationship over the years. Her
expert knowledge has been generated in part through involvement with
activists; but when she used that knowledge as an ostensibly
disinterested expert (the precondition for being called as an expert),
there was [an attempt to discredit her by more powerful
actors]{.underline}. [This **illustrates the challenges of engagement**:
as academics we are autonomous **but not disconnected** and have to
**negotiate the political terrain** at each turn.]{.underline}
Conclusion Reflecting on similarities and differences across these two
case studies and how they relate to the three types of interaction
outlined, it is evident that [there are **practical issues** that
resonate with the **policy engagement** model.]{.underline} [**Timing,**
windows of opportunity, serendipity, **speaking in the same terms** as
interlocutors]{.underline}, and so on [are all significant practical
challenges]{.underline}. There are also larger political issues at stake
that speak to the second and third models of activism and scholarship as
practice. These include the useful but troublesome fiction of
disinterested scholarly neutrality, the role of research in generating a
sense of crisis, the potential to bolster the position of weaker actors
that require support, and the diffi culties of creating openings for
articulating different views in policy debate. These challenges give a
different slant to the way we evaluate the impact of research beyond the
university. [Rather than valorizing research that is **useful to state
policy**]{.underline} or enhances competitiveness (the explicit aim of
the ESRC, for example), **[the key criterion]{.underline}** [could be
whether research **holds power**]{.underline} (be it states or capital
or civil society) **[to account]{.underline}**. [As UK citizens and
UK-based academics, **the key question is how to hold state power in the
core of the international system to account.**]{.underline} In both
cases, that state power is allied to the power of capital -- and at
times to the power of NGOs. For example, in the case of the arms trade,
while the MoD and BIS operate in tandem with military capital, DfID and
parts of the FCO have (weaker) alliances with NGOs, so NGOs are
integrated into the operation of state power (Stavrianakis 2010). So the
question of whom to hold to account, and for what, is more complicated
than we might initially think. [These issues mean we require a more
nuanced view of where and how impact happens and with or to whom, taking
into account all of the contingencies earlier about available spaces,
risks involved, and the nature of the issue]{.underline}. Understanding
the nature of the relationship between academia and the world beyond the
university is inherently political. [**Failure to address the politics
of engagement means we run the risk of powerful academics having
powerful voices with powerful people, creating a self-reproducing
dynamic and diminishing the prospects of progressive change.** Thinking
about where power is located and how it operates requires us to **go
beyond homogenizing accounts of key actors**]{.underline} (be they
states, corporations, international organizations, or NGOs) [without
being naive about the scope for autonomy and the willingness of powerful
actors to engage with researchers and act on their
findings]{.underline}. (212-14)

#### The Link outweighs any turn: This short-term conflict makes transition to their alternative impossible \---- only realism can provide a pragmatic bridge

**Murray '97**(Alastair J.H, Prof Political Theory, U Edinburgh,
[Reconstructing Realism: Between Power Politics and Cosmopolitian
Ethics]{.underline}, p. 194)

[Given that, in the absence of a resolution of such difficulties,
longer-term objectives are liable to be **unachievable**, realism would
seem to offer a **more effective strategy of transition** than
reflectivism]{.underline} itself. Whereas, in constructivism, such
strategies are divorced from an awareness of the immediate problems
which obstruct such efforts, and, in critical theoretical perspectives,
they are divorced from the current realities of international politics
altogether, [realism\'s emphasis on first addressing the immediate
obstacles to development ensures that it at least generates strategies
which offer us a **tangible path to follow**. If these
strategies]{.underline} perhaps lack the visionary appeal of
reflectivist proposals, emphasising simply the necessity of a
restrained, moderate diplomacy in order to ameliorate conflicts between
states, to foster a degree of mutual understanding in international
relations, and, ultimately, to develop a sense of community which might
underlie a more comprehensive international society, they at least [seek
to take advantage of the possibilities of **reform** in the current
international system **without jeopardising the possibilities of
order**. Realism\'s gradualist reformism]{.underline}, the careful
tending of what it regards as an essentially organic process,
[ultimately suggests the basis for a **more sustainable strategy** for
reform than reflectivist perspectives, however dramatic, can
offer.]{.underline}

Yet, ironically if not tragically, [dissident IR]{.underline} also
[paralyzes itself]{.underline} into non-action. While it challenges the
status quo, [dissident IR fails to transform]{.underline} it. Indeed,
[dissident IR claims that a "coherent" paradigm]{.underline} or research
program --- even an alternative one --- [reproduces the stifling
parochialism and hidden power- mongering of sovereign
scholarship.]{.underline} "Any agenda of global politics informed by
critical social theory perspectives," writes Jim George "must forgo the
simple, albeit self-gratifying, options inherent in ready- made
alternative Realisms and confront the dangers, closures, paradoxes, and
complicities associated with them. Even [references to a "real
world]{.underline}, dissidents argue, [repudiate the very meaning of
dissidence]{.underline} given their sovereign presumption of a
universalizable, testable Reality. What [dissident scholarship opts
for]{.underline}, instead, is a sense of [disciplinary
crisis]{.underline} that "resonates with the effects of marginal and
dissident movements in all sorts of other localities."
[Despite]{.underline} its [emancipatory intentions]{.underline}, [this
approach]{.underline} effectively [leaves the]{.underline} prevailing
[prison of sovereignty intact]{.underline}. It doubly incarcerates when
[dissident IR highlights]{.underline} the layers of [power that oppress
without offering]{.underline} a heuristic, not to mention [a program,
for emancipatory action]{.underline}. [Merely politicizing]{.underline}
the supposedly non-political [neither guides emancipatory action nor
**guards it against demagoguery**]{.underline}**.** At best, [dissident
IR sanctions a detached criticality]{.underline} [rooted (ironically) in
Western modernity]{.underline}. Michael [Shapiro]{.underline}, for
instance, [advises the dissident]{.underline} [theorist to take "a
critical distance]{.underline}" or "position offshore' from which to
"see the possibility of change." But [what becomes of those who know
they are burning in the hells of exploitation]{.underline}, racism,
sexism, starvation, [civil war, and the like while the esoteric
dissident observes "critically]{.underline}" from offshore? What hope do
they have of overthrowing these shackles of sovereignty? [In not
answering these questions, dissident IR ends up reproducing]{.underline}
despite avowals to the contrary, [the sovereign outcome of discourse
divorced from practice, analysis from policy]{.underline},
deconstruction from reconstruction, [particulars from universals, and
critical theory from problem-solving]{.underline}.

#### Vote Negative to write back to imperialism- intellectuals should focus criticism at their own government/material policies 

**Ashcroft and Ahluwalia, PhDs, 99**

(Bill, English@SouthWales, Pal, Politics@Adelaide, [Edward
Said]{.underline})

[Once we take criticism out of the professional domain]{.underline} of
the literary critic, [we discover its **transformative
possibilities**]{.underline}. Ultimately, criticism is important to Said
because [criticism is the **key function** of the concerned
intellectual. Criticism locates the intellectual in the
world,]{.underline} for [the]{.underline} ultimate [function of such a
person is not to advance]{.underline} complex [specialised 'theologies'
but to **'speak truth to power',**]{.underline} the title of an essay in
Representations of the Intellectual (1994). 'How does one speak truth?
What truth? From whom and where?' (1994:65). There is no way of
providing a global answer, but the intellectual must strive for freedom
of opinion and expression. [The power of resistance comes in the ability
of the author to '**write back' to imperialism**]{.underline}, to speak
'truth' to injustice. [Not only do human]{.underline}
being[s]{.underline} [construct their truths, but 'the so-called
objective truth of the white man's superiority built and maintained by
the classical European colonial empires also rested on a violent
subjugation of African and Asian peoples']{.underline} (1994:67).
[Despite a proliferation of the liberal rhetoric of
equality]{.underline} and justice, [injustices continue]{.underline} in
various parts of the globe. [The task for the intellectual is to apply
these notions and bring them to 'bear on **actual
situations'**]{.underline} (1994:71). [This means taking a stand
**against one's own government**]{.underline}, as Said does in the Gulf
War, or against one's own people, as he appears to be doing in speaking
out against the Oslo peace accord at a time when there was considerable
euphoria that it might have ended the long-running battle between Israel
and the Palestinians. In retrospect, Said's position appears to have
been vindicated (1994a). [The point]{.underline} of speaking the truth
to power in contemporary societies [is to effect better conditions to
achieve peace, reconciliation and justice]{.underline}. The intellectual
follows such a path not for personal glory but to change the moral
climate. '[Speaking the truth to power]{.underline},' says Said, '[is no
panglossian idealism: it is **carefully weighing the alternatives**,
picking the right one, and **then intelligently representing it** where
it can do the most good and cause the right change']{.underline}
(1994:75). (39)

#### We avoid the "local education disad." "Putting this room first" is net worse for those lacking privilege

**Hoff '6**

(et al, Dr. Dianne Hoff, professor in the College of Education and Human
Development and president of Faculty Senate, University of Maine,
Journal of Educational Administration, 44:3 -- available via Emerald
Management 120 database).

There is no question that helping educational leadership students become
self-analytical and reflect upon the areas where their own leadership
and decisions can be improved is an important aspect of self and school
improvement[. If, however, an educational leadership program fails to
push students to reflect beyond their individual actions and
their current setting, it can actually reinforcetheir tendency both to
think and act locally. This confines their actions to the norms of
their local schools and communities, which can only result in the
maintenance of the status quo. More problematic, local thinking can mask
deep prejudice that exists to sustain a system that advantages the
dominant culture. School leaders who hesitate to challenge local
norms may perpetuate a system of schooling that marginalizes people who
are considered different. As Counts reminds us, all education includes
the imposition of ideas and values, but educators have an obligation to
be clear about what assumptions shape their practice. A narrow focus on
local concerns may involve "the clothing of one\'s own deepest
prejudices in the garb of universal truth" ([Counts,
1932](https://urldefense.proofpoint.com/v2/url?u=http-3A__www.emeraldinsight.com_Insight_ViewContentServlet-3FFilename-3DPublished_EmeraldFullTextArticle_Articles_0740440304.html-23b6&d=DwMFaQ&c=nE__W8dFE-shTxStwXtp0A&r=ekDMR_A59MNVtNI4tcIYNg&m=zgi_voEzGED8nuMUH54jBWDeFfYT6qwY5IHS0EgF5Ok&s=fPHEsJHmbv1xAEIRdG5OKSTgvwxKFIZXNApELL0Cy_0&e=),
p. 180).There is an alternative. Educational leaders have to decide in
big and small ways every day whether to let local or global contexts
shape their actions]{.underline}. School leaders who go out of their way
to welcome immigrant students, hire openly gay teachers, support a
multi-cultural curriculum, honor a variety of religious holidays, and
routinely examine school practices that might reinforce privilege (to
list just a few examples), perhaps even in the face of local
disapproval, contribute to the important task of creating an arena for
expanding local and parochial weltanschauungen. Exemplary acts by school
leaders speak even louder than exemplary words. They send messages about
the inclusiveness of the schools\' social and intellectual environments.
They quite literally set up a level playing field for the arena of ideas
and beliefs. This is an arena from which a new social order can emerge.

#### Rejecting our impact [reverses the error]{.underline} and links to their argument [worse]{.underline}: it's a form of [prioritization]{.underline} that devalues and denies real forms of violence\-\--turns the K.

**Sunstrom 8 --** Ronald R. Sunstrom, Associate Professor of Philosophy
at the University of San Francisco, Ph.D. in Philosophy from the
University of Minnesota Twin Cities, BA in Philosophy from the
University of Minnesota-Duluth, The Browning of America and the Evasion
of Social Justice, p. 3-4

[It would be odd and troubling for the nation to **merrily work toward
justice at "home**]{.underline}," all the [while neglecting the demands
of those whom the nation regarded as perpetual foreigners]{.underline}
(and not really being at "home" in the nation) [and the demands of
global justice.]{.underline} **[Such a vision of justice is self-serving
and morally hollow]{.underline}**. [Long-existing civil rights claims
should not delimit the nation's moral boundaries and its conception of
civil rights, thus **ipso facto severing them from internationally**
determined human rights]{.underline}. The reactions of some citizens to
the browning of America, unfortunately, open up this possibility, which
is yet another evasion of social justice.7 When I broach these issues,
or any of the particular issues discussed in this book, **[the response
I frequently receive is that these issues are red herrings that divert
our attention away from the real enemy]{.underline}**, [that of white
supremacy]{.underline}.8 **[I am dubious about this
complaint]{.underline}**; [after all, focusing on "white supremacy" does
not directly address the particulars of the interethnic conflicts that
arise]{.underline} from the browning of America. Perhaps, though, these
critics mean that we should focus on how "white supremacy," in the form
of institutionalized racism or white power, divides minority groups, so
as to conquer them and leave them to fight over a limited set of
resources. Alternatively, these critiques would have us focus on how
Latinos, Asian Americans, Americans who identify as multiracial, and
immigrants adopt anti-black racism and the privileges of whiteness as
they assimilate into American society. I think the latter argument is
bogus, and chapter 3 is devoted in part to explaining why. As for the
former, I think "[white supremacy" is too broad and vague a category to
be helpful, and that focusing on such a flawed category of power can be
positively harmful. Such moves simply **sidestep the particular issues**
that are raised in interethnic confl icts and may even contribute to the
evasions I outlined earlier.]{.underline} The people of the United
States, as they experience and participate in the browning of America,
should resist both types of evasions. The Browning of America and the
Evasion of Social Justice argues, in contrast, that the people of the
United States should see in its demographic change the transformation of
social justice. They should welcome that transformation and view it as
an opportunity to satisfy old debts and expand in a cosmopolitan
direction the very idea of social justice.

### 2NC Turn Shield 

#### Politics supplements rather than supplants cultural theory- we don't say ignore racism/sexism etc, use theory to inform political praxis. We object to their refusal of politics, not their concern for difference

**Illing, sw, 17**

(Sean, former prof of politics and philosophy "at a university"-
seriously vox you suck,
http://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2017/2/9/14543938/richard-rorty-liberalism-vietnam-donald-trump-obama)

[America was viewed]{.underline}, increasingly, [as a failed
promise]{.underline}, a malevolent empire **[beyond
redemption]{.underline}**. Of what use is reformist politics in such a
context? Rorty elaborates: For [if you turn out to be living in an evil
empire]{.underline} (rather than, as you had been told, a democracy
fighting an evil empire), **[then you have no
responsibility]{.underline}** to your country; you are accountable only
to humanity. If what your government and your teachers are saying is all
part of the same Orwellian monologue -- if the differences between the
Harvard faculty and the military-industrial complex, or between Lyndon
Johnson and Barry Goldwater, are negligible -- then you have a
responsibility to make a revolution. [It's not that these sentiments
were wrong; America was, for much of the country, a failed
promise.]{.underline} The racial divide was real and socially
engineered. The war in Vietnam was an inhuman sham. There was something
deeply troubling about the structure of American society. Rorty disputed
none of this. From his perspective, **[the problem was the total
rejection of pragmatic reform]{.underline}**. The belief [that there was
nothing in America that could be salvaged,]{.underline} no institutions
that could be corrected, no laws worth passing, **[led to the complete
abandonment of conventional politics. Persuasion was replaced by
self-expression; policy reform by recrimination]{.underline}**. [There
was a shift away from economics towards a "politics of
difference]{.underline}" or "identity" or "recognition." If the
intellectual locus of pre-'60s leftism was social science departments,
it was now literature and philosophy departments. And the focus was no
longer on advancing alternatives to a market economy or on the proper
balance between political freedom and economic liberalism. Now the focus
was on the cultural status of traditionally marginalized groups. [In
many ways, this was a good thing]{.underline}. The economic determinism
of the pre-'60s left was embarrassingly myopic. Most of the gains made
by the left in the early and mid-20th century went to white males. "The
situation of African-Americans was deplored," as Rorty notes, "but not
changed by this predominantly white Left." The plight of minorities and
gay Americans and other oppressed groups was an afterthought. This was a
moral failure the cultural left sought to correct. And it did this by
"teaching Americans to recognize otherness," as Rorty put it.
Multiculturalism, as it's now called, was about preserving otherness,
preserving our differences; it doesn't oblige us to cease to notice
those differences. There's nothing morally objectionable about that.
**[As a political strategy, however, it's problematic]{.underline}**.
[It reinforces sectarian impulses and detracts from
coalition-building.]{.underline} The pivot away from politics toward
culture spawned academic fields like women and gender studies,
African-American studies, Hispanic-American studies, LGBTQ studies, and
so on. These disciplines do serious academic work, but they don't
minister to concrete political ends. Their goal has been to make people
aware of the humiliation and hate endured by these groups, and to
alienate anyone invested in that hate. Rorty doesn't object to these
aims; indeed, he (rightly) celebrated them. The cultural left succeeded
in making America a better, more civilized country. The problem, though,
is that that [progress came at a price.]{.underline} "There is a dark
side to the success story I have been telling about the post-sixties
cultural Left," Rorty writes. "**[During the same period in which
socially accepted sadism diminished, economic inequality and economic
insecurity have steadily increased.]{.underline}** [It's as if the
American Left **could not handle more than one initiative at a time**
--- as if it either had to ignore stigma in order to concentrate on
money, or vice versa." The left's focus on cultural issues created an
opening for the populist right]{.underline}, for people like Pat
Buchanan and Donald Trump, who galvanize support among the white working
class by exploiting racial resentment and economic anxiety. Rorty
explains: While the Left's back was turned, the bourgeoisification of
the white proletariat which began in WWII and continued up through the
Vietnam War has been halted, and the process has gone into reverse.
America is now proletarianizing its bourgeoisie, and this process is
likely to culminate in bottom-up revolt, of the sort \[Pat\] Buchanan
hopes to foment. [**Racial animus is baked into the founding of America;
it exists regardless of what the left does. But Rorty's point holds: By
divorcing itself from class and labor issues, the left lost sight of its
economic agenda and waged a culture war that empowers the right and has
done little to improve the lives of the very people it seeks to defend.
Rorty's advice to the left was to pay attention to who benefits from
such a strategy:** The super-rich will have to keep up the pretense that
national politics might someday make a difference]{.underline}. Since
economic decisions are their prerogative, [they will encourage
politicians of both the Left and the Right, to specialize in cultural
issues]{.underline}. The aim will be to keep the minds of the proles
elsewhere -- to keep the bottom 75 percent of Americans and the bottom
95 percent of the world's population busy with ethnic and religious
hostilities, and with debates about sexual mores. If the proles can be
distracted from their own despair by media-created pseudo-events...the
super-rich will have little to fear. [Big business benefits most from
the culture wars]{.underline}. If the left and the right are quarreling
over religion or race or same-sex marriage, nothing much changes, or
nothing that impacts wealth concentration changes. Rorty is particularly
hard on Presidents Jimmy Carter and Bill Clinton, both of whom he
accuses of retreating "from any mention of redistribution" and of
"moving into a sterile vacuum called the center." The Democratic Party,
under this model, has grown terrified of redistributionist economics,
believing such talk would drive away the suburbanite vote. The result,
he concludes, is that "the choice between the major parties has come
down to a choice between cynical lies and terrified silence." [Rorty's
concern was not that the left cared too much about race relations or
discrimination (it should care about these things); rather, he warned
that **it stopped doing the hard work of liberal democratic
politics**]{.underline}. He worried that **[it's retreat into academia,
into theory and away from the concrete, would prove politically
disastrous.]{.underline}** Immediately after the now-famous passage
about a future "strongman," Rorty offered yet another disturbing
prophecy: **[One thing that is very likely to happen is that the gains
made in the past forty years by black and brown Americans, and by
homosexuals, will be wiped out.]{.underline}** [Jocular contempt for
women will come back into fashion]{.underline}. The words 'nigger' and
'kike' will once again be heard in the workplace. **[All the sadism
which the academic Left has tried to make unacceptable to its students
will come flooding back]{.underline}**. All the resentment which badly
educated Americans feel about having their manners dictated to them by
college graduates will find an outlet. If this were to happen, Rorty
added, it would be a calamity for the country and the world. People
would wonder how it happened, and why the left was unable to stop it.
[They wouldn't understand why the left couldn't "channel the mounting
rage of the newly dispossessed" and speak more directly to the
"consequences of globalization]{.underline}." They would conclude that
the left had died, or that it existed but was "no longer able to engage
in national politics." And they would be right in at least one sense: On
a purely political level, the left would have failed.

### XT: Policy Inevitable 

#### Policy involvement is inevitable- we need to proactively engage in the language of policy making for movements to be effective

**Themba-Nixon,** Makani. Executive Director of The Praxis Project,
Former California Staffer, Colorlines. Oakland: Jul 31, 20**00**.Vol.3,
Iss. 2; pg. 12

\"[This is all about policy,\" a woman complained]{.underline} to me in
a recent conversation. \"[I\'m an organizer]{.underline}.\"[The flourish
and passion with which she **made the distinction** said
everything]{.underline}. [**Policy is for wonks, sell-out politicians,
and ivory-tower eggheads.** Organizing is what real, grassroots people
do.]{.underline} Common as it may be, [this distinction doesn\'t bear
out in the real world.]{.underline}

[Policy is more than law]{.underline}. It is any written agreement
(formal or informal) that specifies how an institution, governing body,
or community will address shared problems or attain shared goals. [It
spells out the terms and]{.underline} the [consequences]{.underline} of
these agreements and is the codification of the body\'s values-as
represented by those present in the policymaking process. Given who\'s
usually present, [most policies reflect the political agenda of powerful
elites. Yet, policy can be a **force for
change-**]{.underline}especially when we bring our base and community
organizing into the process.

In essence, [policies are the codification of power
relationships]{.underline} and resource allocation. Policies are [the
rules of the world we live in. Changing the world **means changing the
rules.**]{.underline} So, [if organizing is about changing the rules and
building power, how can organizing be separated from
policies?]{.underline} [Can we really speak truth to power, fight the
right, stop corporate abuses, or win racial justice without **contesting
the rules and the rulers, the policies and the
policymakers?**]{.underline}

**[The answer is no]{.underline}**-**[and double no for people of
color]{.underline}**. Today, [racism subtly dominates nearly every
aspect of policymaking]{.underline}. From ballot propositions to city
funding priorities, policy is increasingly about the control,
de-funding, and disfranchisement of communities of color.

What Do We Stand For?

[Take]{.underline} the public conversation about [welfare
reform]{.underline}, for example. Most of us know [it isn\'t really
about putting people to work]{.underline}. [The right\'s message was
framed around racial stereotypes]{.underline} of lazy, cheating
\"welfare queens\" whose poverty was \"cultural.\" [But the new welfare
policy was about moving billions of dollar]{.underline}s in individual
cash payments and direct services from welfare recipients to other, more
powerful, social actors.

[Many of us were **too busy to tune into the welfare policy drama** in
Washington]{.underline}, [only to find it **washed up right on our
doorsteps**]{.underline}. [Our members are suffering]{.underline} from
workfare policies, new regulations, and cutoffs. Families who were
barely getting by under the old rules are being pushed over the edge by
the new policies. **[Policy doesn\'t get more relevant than
this]{.underline}**. And **[so we got involved in policy-as
defense.]{.underline}**

[Yet **we have to do more than block their punches**]{.underline}. [We
have to start the fight with initiatives of our own]{.underline}. [Those
who do are finding offense a bit **more fun**]{.underline} [than defense
alone]{.underline}. [Living wage ordinances, youth development
initiatives, even gun control and alcohol and tobacco policies are
finding their way onto the public agenda, thanks to focused community
organizing that leverages power for community-driven
initiatives]{.underline}.

\- Over 600 local policies have been passed to regulate the tobacco
industry. Local coalitions have taken the lead by writing ordinances
that address local problems and organizing broad support for them.

\- Nearly 100 gun control and violence prevention policies have been
enacted since 1991.

\- Milwaukee, Boston, and Oakland are among the cities that have passed
living wage ordinances: local laws that guarantee higher than minimum
wages for workers, usually set as the minimum needed to keep a family of
four above poverty.

[These are just a few of the examples that demonstrate how]{.underline}
[organizing for local policy advocacy has made inroads in areas where
positive national policy had been stalled by conservatives]{.underline}.
Increasingly, the local policy arena is where the action is and where
activists are finding success. Of course, corporate interests-which are
usually the target of these policies-are gearing up in defense. Tactics
include front groups, economic pressure, and the tried and true: cold,
hard cash.

Despite these barriers, grassroots organizing can be very effective at
the smaller scale of local politics. At the local level, we have greater
access to elected officials and officials have a greater reliance on
their constituents for reelection. For example, getting 400 people to
show up at city hall in just about any city in the U.S. is quite
impressive. On the other hand, 400 people at the state house or the
Congress would have a less significant impact. Add to that the fact that
all 400 people at city hall are usually constituents, and the impact is
even greater.

Recent trends in government underscore the importance of local policy.
Congress has enacted a series of measures devolving significant power to
state and local government. Welfare, health care, and the regulation of
food and drinking water safety are among the areas where states and
localities now have greater rule.

Devolution has some negative consequences to be sure. History has taught
us that, for social services and civil rights in particular, the lack of
clear federal standards and mechanisms for accountability lead to uneven
enforcement and even discriminatory implementation of policies. Still,
there are real opportunities for advancing progressive initiatives in
this more localized environment. Greater local control can mean greater
community power to shape and implement important social policies that
were heretofore out of reach. To do so will require careful attention to
the mechanics of local policymaking and a clear blueprint of what we
stand for.

Getting It in Writing

**[Much of the work of framing what we stand for takes place in the
shaping of demands]{.underline}**. [By getting into the policy arena in
a proactive manner, we can take our demands to the next
level.]{.underline} Our [demands can become law, with real
consequences]{.underline} if the agreement is broken. After all the
organizing, press work, and effort, a group should leave a decisionmaker
with more than a handshake and his or her word. Of course, this work
requires a certain amount of interaction with \"the suits,\" as well as
struggles with the bureaucracy, the technical language, and the
all-too-common resistance by decisionmakers. Still, if it\'s worth
demanding, it\'s worth having in writing-whether as law, regulation, or
internal policy.

From ballot initiatives on rent control to laws requiring worker
protections, organizers are leveraging their power into written policies
that are making a real difference in their communities. Of course,
policy work is just one tool in our organizing arsenal, but it is a tool
we simply can\'t afford to ignore.

Making policy work an integral part of organizing will require a certain
amount of retrofitting. We will need to develop the capacity to
translate our information, data, and experience into stories that are
designed to affect the public conversation. Perhaps most important, we
will need to move beyond fighting problems and on to framing solutions
that bring us closer to our vision of how things should be. And then we

[**Participation in government matters.** Although people may not get
all that they want, they can achieve many goals and improve their lives
through civic engagement.]{.underline} According to the pluralist
theory, government cannot function without active participation by at
least some citizens. **[Even if]{.underline}** we believe [**the elite**
make political decisions, participation in government through **the act
of voting** can **change** **who** the members of **the elite
are**]{.underline}. Are fewer people today active in politics than in
the past? Political scientist Robert Putnam has argued that [civic
engagement is **declining**]{.underline}; although many Americans may
report belonging to groups, these [groups are usually large, impersonal
ones with thousands of members]{.underline}. People who join groups such
as Amnesty International or Greenpeace may share certain values and
ideals with other members of the group, but they do not actually
interact with these other members. These organizations are different
from the types of groups Americans used to belong to, like church groups
or bowling leagues. Although people are still interested in volunteering
and working for the public good, they are more interested in either
working individually or joining large organizations where they have
little opportunity to interact with others. Putnam considers a number of
explanations for this decline in small group membership, including
increased participation by women in the workforce, a decrease in the
number of marriages and an increase in divorces, and the effect of
technological developments, such as the internet, that separate people
by allowing them to feel connected to others without having to spend
time in their presence.\[1\] Putnam argues that [a decline in social
capital---"the collective value of all 'social networks' \[those whom
people know\]]{.underline} and the inclinations that arise from these
networks to do things for each other"---[accompanies this decline in
membership]{.underline} in small, interactive groups.\[2\] [Included in
social capital are such things as networks of individuals, a sense that
one is part of an entity larger than oneself, concern for the collective
good and a willingness to help others, and the ability to trust others
and to work with them]{.underline} to find solutions to problems. This,
in turn, has hurt people's willingness and ability to engage in
representative government. If Putnam is correct, this trend is
unfortunate, because becoming active in government and community
organizations is important for many reasons[.**Civic engagement can
increase the power of ordinary people** to influence government actions.
Even those without money or connections to important people can
influence the policies that affect their lives and change the direction
taken by governmen]{.underline}t. U.S. history is filled with examples
of people actively challenging the power of elites, gaining rights for
themselves, and protecting their interests. F[or example, slavery was
once legal in the United States and large sectors of the U.S. economy
were dependent on this forced labor. Slavery was outlawed and blacks
were granted citizenship because of the actions of abolitionists.
Although some abolitionists were wealthy white men, most were ordinary
people, including men and women of both races.]{.underline} White women
and blacks were able to actively assist in the campaign to end slavery
despite the fact that, with few exceptions, they were unable to vote.
Similarly, the right to vote once belonged solely to white men until the
Fifteenth Amendment gave the vote to African American men. [The
Nineteenth Amendment extended the vote to include women, and the Voting
Rights Act of 1965 made exercising the right to vote a reality for
African American men and women in the South]{.underline}. [None of this
would have happened, however, without the efforts of people who marched
in protest, participated in boycotts, delivered speeches, wrote letters
to politicians, and sometimes risked arrest in order to be
heard.]{.underline} [The tactics used to influence the government and
effect change by abolitionists]{.underline} and members of the women's
rights and African American civil rights movements [are still used by
many activists today.T]{.underline}he rights gained by these activists
and others have dramatically improved the quality of life for many in
the United States. Civil rights legislation did not focus solely on the
right to vote or to hold public office; it also integrated schools and
public accommodations, prohibited discrimination in housing and
employment, and increased access to higher education. Activists for
women's rights fought for, and won, greater reproductive freedom for
women, better wages, and access to credit. Only a few decades ago,
homosexuality was considered a mental disorder, and intercourse between
consenting adults of the same sex was illegal in many states. Although
legal discrimination against gays and lesbians still remains, consensual
intercourse between homosexual adults is no longer illegal anywhere in
the United States, and same-sex couples have the right to legally marry.
Activism can improve people's lives in less dramatic ways as well.
Working to make cities clean up vacant lots, destroy or rehabilitate
abandoned buildings, build more parks and playgrounds, pass ordinances
requiring people to curb their dogs, and ban late-night noise greatly
affects people's quality of life. [The actions of individual Americans
can make **their own lives better** and improve their neighbors' lives
as well. Representative democracy cannot work effectively without the
participation of informed citizens,]{.underline} however. [Engaged
citizens]{.underline} familiarize themselves with the most important
issues confronting the country and with the plans different candidates
have for dealing with those issues. Then they vote for the candidates
they believe will be best suited to the job, and they may join others to
raise funds or campaign for those they support. They inform their
representatives how they feel about important issues. Through these
efforts and others, engaged citizens let their representatives know what
they want and thus influence policy. Only then can government actions
accurately reflect the interests and concerns of the majority. [Even
people who believe **the elite rule government** should recognize that
it is **easier for them** to do so if ordinary people make **no effor**t
to participate in public life]{.underline}.[People can become civically
engaged in]{.underline} many ways, either as individuals or as members
of groups. Some forms of individual engagement require very little
effort. One of the simplest ways is to stay informed about [**debates

nation. [Awareness is the first step toward engagement]{.underline}.

#### Pessimism emboldens conservatives and destroys possibilities for political change.

**Teixeira 17 --** (Ruy Teixeira, senior fellow at the Center for
American Progress, "The Left Is Killing Itself With Pessimism",
<https://time.com/4692486/left-donald-trump-pessimism-optimism/>,
Published MARCH 9, 2017, Accessed July 13, 2019, njt)

The words "optimism" and "the left" do not seem to go together very well
these days. [The dominant view on the left --- reinforced by Trump's
victory --- is as follows: (1) progress in today's world has largely
stopped and in many ways reversed; (2) the left is weak and at the mercy
of a rapacious capitalism and a marauding right; and (3) the outlook for
the future is bleak, with ordinary citizens suffering even more
deprivation and the planet itself sliding inexorably toward
catastrophe.]{.underline}

It is not the case that progress has stopped. Today, we live in a freer,
more democratic, less violent and more prosperous world than we ever
have before.

[It is not the case that the left is at the mercy of the right. The form
of the left is changing but its numbers are strong and growing. It
remains a vital force --- the vital force --- for reforming
capitalism.]{.underline}

And it is not the case that the future of humanity is bleak. [The
problems we face today are solvable and, moreover, are likely to be
solved in the coming decades. Life for ordinary citizens should improve
dramatically over the course of the twenty-first century.]{.underline}

[It is also staggeringly obvious that pessimism dramatically undermines
the appeal of the left. Why on earth would anyone sign up with a
movement that believes the situation is so hopeless?]{.underline} What's
so inspiring about that?

Nothing. Yet the left persists in promoting a viewpoint that leads to
paralysis and inaction rather than robust action and positive change.

The left wasn't always like this. Historically, the left has been
identified with a belief in the future and the feasibility of dramatic
improvements in human welfare.

But something went wrong in the 1970s. The great hopes of the 1960s went
aground on the harsh realities of stagflation and then rising inequality
and a resurgent right. It was indisputable that progress in important
ways was slowing down rather than speeding up as most on the left had
hoped.

Various significant electoral defeats for the left followed --- most
famously the rise of Reagan in America and Thatcher in the U.K. And
anti-government ideology thrived, both in politics and economics. The
idea that government was the problem, not the solution, gained political
credibility that would have seemed unimaginable in previous decades, and
economics became dominated by theories that glorified the results of the
untrammeled market.

If that wasn't bad enough, new threats like global warming emerged that
cast doubt on the future of humanity writ large. Scientific progress,
which once spurred visions of flying cars and lives of abundance and
leisure, now seemed powerless to stop the apocalypse (if not complicit
in bringing it on).

On the left, optimism went out of fashion, where it has remained to this
day. Instead, the left concentrated on reminding voters just how
terrible things were becoming. And there was certainly a lot of
plausible material along these lines, as Western capitalism continued to
underperform in terms of both growth and the distribution of benefits
from growth. Data has accumulated over time documenting this poor
performance --- particularly in the early twenty-first century and in
the aftermath of the Great Financial Crisis --- and has been duly
promulgated by the left.

Even the great victories of the left in the social realm tended to get
lost in this litany of despair. Not to mention concrete policy victories
such as those secured by President Obama. In short, when the left was
winning, it often acted as if it was losing. Not surprisingly, the
desired surge in left support has not materialized.

It is time to recognize that [pessimism convinces no one. Marx was wrong
about the immiseration of the proletariat, and contemporary leftists are
wrong about the immiseration of the middle class. What is correct is
that progress has slowed down, not that it has stopped or reversed. What
is correct is that people want to move up from their current life, not
that they believe there is nothing good about their current life. What
is correct is that pessimism makes people less likely to believe in
positive change, not more likely.]{.underline}

#### **Liberal optimism is key to stop Trump.**

**Foran 17** -- (Claire Foran interviewing Ruy Teixeira, senior fellow
at the Center for American Progress, "Is There a Case for Liberal
Optimism in the Trump Era?",
<https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2017/03/trump-democrats-liberals-progressives-optimism/518142/>,
Published March 7, 2017, Accessed July 13, 2019, njt)

There's no shortage of reasons why Democrats in the United States might
feel demoralized. The party is shut out of power in the White House and
Congress, and its hold on state legislatures is at the weakest point in
decades.

Despite, or perhaps because, of those circumstances, Ruy Teixeira, a
senior fellow at the left-leaning think tank the Center for American
Progress, wants liberals to embrace optimism. In a new book, The
Optimistic Leftist: Why the 21st Century Will Be Better Than You Think,
he argues that liberal conventional wisdom---which he describes as
marked by beliefs like "the left is weak" and the planet is "sliding
inexorably toward catastrophe" in the face of threats like climate
change---is not only deeply pessimistic, but also mistaken.

In the short-term, Teixeira believes the president and Republicans in
Congress will have a hard time delivering on their promises, either
because of voter pushback or because some, like reviving a coal industry
hurt more by market forces than government regulation, won't be possible
to fulfill.

The Optimistic Leftist also makes the case that even developments that
currently look like setbacks for the progressive movement are bound up
in long-term trends that ultimately advantage liberals. Take Trump's
election. Teixeira argues that Trump's campaign for infrastructure
investment without regard to deficit reduction signals "the beginning of
the end for austerity economics, formerly the linchpin of conservative
policy." And he sees the Democratic Party's loss of white-working class
voters as a manifestation of economic and social changes, including a
transition away from manufacturing, that are "powering the emergence of
new left coalitions" that will strengthen the political left.

The Optimistic Leftist builds on The Emerging Democratic Majority, a
book Teixeira co-authored with journalist John Judis in 2002, which
argued that increasing demographic diversity would create an enduring
advantage for Democrats in the United States. The Emerging Democratic
Majority has been held up as a cautionary tale in making sweeping
political predictions. But Teixeira argues that it has been
oversimplified and misunderstood, saying in an interview that \"it was
not an argument that demographic change guarantees electoral success,\"
but rather that [demographic shifts create favorable political terrain
for Democrats if they can find a way to make the most of
it.]{.underline}

Part of the message of The Optimistic Leftist seems to be that
[underlying advantages aren't enough to deliver political victory if
liberals succumb to complacency or are paralyzed by fear.]{.underline}
The book emphasizes that [optimism about the future of the political
left is not only warranted, but also strategic. An optimistic outlook
will help liberals enact their political agenda and win
elections]{.underline}, Teixeira believes, [while wallowing in pessimism
will hurt the progressive cause.]{.underline}

I recently spoke with Teixeira about those arguments, and their
potential limitations. A transcript of our conversation, lightly edited
for clarity and length, appears below.

Clare Foran: Your book argues that pessimism "dramatically undermines
the appeal of the left," and "does not motivate the typical person"
while "optimism, by contrast, mobilizes people." Why do you think
pessimism won't mobilize Democrats? [Reporting on town hall protests
that have taken place in the aftermath of the presidential election
suggests that people are motivated by anger and fear, and that many had
not engaged in political activism previously. Doesn't that cut against
your claim that optimism is a better motivator than
pessimism?]{.underline}

Ruy Teixeira: [Outrage can be powerful, but I think there's a difference
between bursts of protest driven by anger, and long-term movement
building. Fear and anger can motivate people to show up and protest, but
that could lead to burnout if political situation they are protesting
doesn't change the way they want it to overnight. Anger is ultimately
demoralizing. If you want to sustain a political movement over the
long-term then optimism is essential.]{.underline} It's what will keep
people from throwing up their hands and giving up.

### **[L -- Deleuze]{.underline}** 

#### **Deleuze's ideas preclude effective political action.**

**Gilson 09** -- (Erinn Cunniff Gilson, Associate Professor, Philosophy,
Skidmore College, Ph.D. in Philosophy, University of Memphis, "Peter
Hallward: Out of this world: Deleuze and the philosophy of creation",
Published in Continental Philosophy Review August 2009, Volume 42, Issue
3, pp 429--434, Accessed July 13, 2019, njt)

In certain respects, Peter Hallward's Out of this World: Deleuze and the
Philosophy of Creation is a tour de force, an all-encompassing montage
surveying Deleuze's thought in a certainly novel fashion. Hallward's
book appears promising and original because it aims to give equal
consideration to the role of thought and the incorporeal in Deleuze's
work, reading Deleuze as a philosopher of "spiritual sobriety" rather
than as one of "material exuberance" as is more common (86). Indeed[,
Hallward's central thesis that Deleuze's philosophy comprises an attempt
to escape the world and the present, and thus "inhibits any
consequential engagement with the constraints of our actual world,"
sustains an implicit critique of much Deleuzian scholarship]{.underline}
(7, 161). While such a shift in focus has potential, Hallward misses
this opportunity by taking the domain of the virtual out of this world.
By endeavoring to deal only with what he deems to be the central problem
of Deleuze's work, Out of This World becomes overly concerned with the
big picture, with an overarching narrative, at the expense of the minor
threads that lend Deleuze's work depth and nuance. This point is
conceded on the first page when Hallward frames his project as an
attempt "to chart one broadly consistent course" through Deleuze's work,
following its "dominant movement" "on the basis of a single
presumption," namely, "that being is creativity" (1, 7).

The theme of creativity structures the text and Hallward's understanding
of Deleuze's philosophy, which is condensed into the tripartite
conceptual framework of creation-creatings-creatures (27). The whole of
being is creation, which includes creative processes or creatings and
creatures, the products of these processes. This schema suffices to
explain the complexity of Deleuze's ontology for Hallward: virtual
differentiation and becoming are creatings, and the domain of the actual
is the domain of creatures who are limited by their physical structure
and organization. While Hallward acknowledges that creation "is the
immanent combination of both creature and creating," he ranks creatings
above the creatures they generate (28). The greater part of his account
of Deleuzian ontology is oriented toward demonstrating this point, which
is crucial to the central claim of the book: Deleuze is an other-worldly
philosopher whose work fails to provide useful resources with which to
engage the political realities of this world.

[The first chapter presents an overview of Deleuze's ontology through an
examination of six principal features of being: univocity, the ability
to be intuited, continuity, intensity, hierarchy of creative potential,
and virtuality. This explication of Deleuze's ontology is performed
primarily through a treatment of Bergson, and Hallward's deliberate aim
is to render the difference between the two indiscernible in order to
represent Deleuze as a mystical thinker]{.underline}. The second chapter
turns directly to the priority of virtual creatings over actual
creatures. The primary concern of this chapter, and of the two
subsequent chapters, is how Deleuze manages to circumvent the inevitable
limitations inherent in actual creatures. Because "creatural opacity is
an immanent and unavoidable obstacle to the expression or development of
being itself \[,\]" Deleuze's philosophy focuses on endeavoring "to
think the principle of its own creating"; it must determine the
conditions of the reality of creativity (30). It does this by positing
both a distinction between virtual and actual, and also, on Hallward's
account, an inexorable and perfect power of creation. This latter
supposition is the product of Hallward's desire to read Deleuze in a
theophanic manner, conceiving of all creatings as expressions of a
perfect whole (for instance, God or the unity of creative potential as
in the plane of immanence) (4). Accordingly, the conceptual schema of
creation-creatings-creatures shifts to one of
creator-creatings-creatures in which the creator is an infinite power of
creation (37--38). The creative power is a given, Hallward contends;
therefore, the focus of Deleuze's philosophy remains creatings rather
than creatures. Indeed, if creatures simply "get in the way of creation"
then the only avenue for creation is one that leads out of the domain of
the creatural and actual, out of this world (55).

A crucial point in Hallward's interpretation is his insistence that the
distinction between virtual and actual corresponds not only to that
between creating and creature but also to that between active and
passive: "only one of these two terms is active. It is only the creating
that differs or produces..." (28, cf. 29, 49, 97). Actual creatures can
only serve as the passive media of creating; they are not themselves
creative. The third chapter explicates the various forms taken by
"creatural confinement," from the organic form and its limited
orientation toward the demands of necessity to the constitution of the
human subject through habit to the dictates of representation. Hallward
formulates the problem to which Deleuze's philosophy seeks to respond in
this way: "Our only problem ... is that we generally live in ignorance
or denial of what we are" (55). The second half of the book is devoted
to a consideration of how Deleuze responds to this problem of creatural
confinement and ignorance. Deleuze's solution, Hallward specifies,
consists of "creative subtraction" (Chap. 4), a process that is at work
both in art and literature (Chap. 5) and in philosophy (Chap. 6).

The concept of subtraction is an important one in Hallward's reading of
Deleuze, thus it is worth dedicating some time to clarifying exactly
what he means by the term. Subtraction is a process of excising
everything that makes a creature overly stable, rigidly organized and
fixed; the dissolution of subjectivity is an instance of subtraction.
Accordingly, it is through subtraction that becoming can take place.
Subtraction is, perhaps most importantly, a dematerializing method. A
rhizome "embodies ... its tendential disembodiment" and becomes "the
vehicle of a purely virtual creative force" (83). Whereas a process of
actualization is oriented toward the solidification of virtual
potentials in existent entities (substances and subjects) in this world,
this process of subtraction is defined by the way it is oriented out of
this world, away from this "closure" of the virtual in the actual
(ibid).1

In his treatment of the role of literature and art in Deleuze's
philosophy, Hallward continues to advance the thesis that Deleuze's
philosophy leads us away from the concerns of this world, claiming that
"art enables the full spiritualisation or dematerialisation of life"
(105). Thus, he emphasizes how the physical materials of art become
expressive, but does so only by deemphasizing the fundamental
indiscernibility of material and sensation that is key to Deleuze's
aesthetics (106). In the work of art, the material becomes expressive
but, at the same time, "sensation is realized in the material and does
not exist outside of this realization."2 Consequently, Hallward
determines that Deleuze's ontology leads to a hierarchy of adequate
expression in which philosophy is superior because it is the most
dematerialized mode of expression, hence expressing being most
completely, and, indeed, is itself a line of pure thought and becoming
(128).

[Hallward's brief concluding remarks are an unequivocal statement of his
belief that Deleuze's philosophy is useless for practical endeavors. He
writes, "As Deleuze understands it, living contemplation proceeds at an
immeasurable distance from what is merely lived, known or decided. Life
lives and creation creates on a virtual plane that leads forever out of
our actual world]{.underline}" (164). [The aforementioned claims
regarding Deleuze's ontology lead him directly to a dismissal of the
importance and relevance of Deleuze's thought for politics and
ethics.]{.underline}

### L: No Demands 

#### The left fetishizes stylistic resistance to paper over crushing political defeats- the demand for academic difference is at root the imperative of the marketplace

**Alvarez, PhD Candidate, 17**

(Maximillian, 3-8,
https://thebaffler.com/blog/circulate-now-mobilize-later)

Basically, [it's crowded]{.underline} "in here," which is [not, on its
own, a bad thing]{.underline}. [The more leftism the
merrier]{.underline}, and it's all the better that [there are distinct
flavors]{.underline} and ideological shadings to choose from. [But
something sticks in the teeth]{.underline} when you look at lists like
these; [there seems to be an inverse relation between how well the left
is doing]{.underline} [in]{.underline} the [journalism]{.underline}
world **[and how much we're getting our asses kicked everywhere
else]{.underline}**. There's a host of different and intersecting
reasons for this, but I want to talk about the one that is most present,
the one that has to do with you reading this article right now. Here's
my first claim: for too long, **[we've collectively and individually
allowed leftism to become a loose cluster of critical positions orbiting
around a general sense of intellectual and consumeristic
self-satisfaction as opposed to pressure-cooking it down to a core of
concerted political actions and commitments]{.underline}**. [The market
for leftist ideas and criticism is something akin to a concentrated
mist**: refreshing in the moment, but ungraspable, and perhaps hazardous
over the longer term**.]{.underline} Second claim[: this has largely
been the result of fundamental changes to the ways we write, share, act,
and think]{.underline} that have occurred [under]{.underline} the system
called "**[communicative capitalism]{.underline}**"---[a system that
encourages us to communicate more even as the rapid proliferation of new
platforms and outlets **sucks away the potential for our communications
to have any sort of political impact**.]{.underline} Third claim: [while
the]{.underline} writing and publishing [left may be "succeeding" by the
standards set by communicative capitalism, we're **actively feeding**
the mechanisms by which communicative capitalism makes us
**obsolete.**]{.underline} The left has always relied on "organs" for
basic functions of its many political bodies (here we'll stick to print
and typed media, but this also includes radio, video, illustrations,
art, etc.). There's a beautiful and dusty history to publications like
New Masses, The Militant, The Daily Worker, and The Partisan Review in
the days of the "Old Left, succeeded by the New Left Review (itself the
product of a 1960 merger between The New Reasoner and Universities and
Left Review), politics, Dissent, Socialisme ou Barbarie, The Socialist
Register, Monthly Review, The National Guardian, In These Times, Mother
Jones, etc., to say nothing of anarchist zines and liberal pillars like
The Nation and The New Republic. [Take a cursory glance at]{.underline}
some of [the older issues]{.underline} of these and many more
publications, and note our recent intellectual lineage. Some of the
writing is incredible, some of it sucks, but one thing stands out
immediately. [These]{.underline} media outlets, representing different
ideological factions and causes, **[never let you forget how
impressively goal-oriented they are]{.underline}**. Their communicative
goals include, but aren't limited to: [introducing a working left agenda
to moldable "publics";]{.underline} cultivating ways of viewing the
world consistent with core leftist principles[; providing a public forum
for key arguments and strategies to be debated]{.underline}; organizing
targeted readerships (specific geographic, class, employment-based, etc.
demographics) and [mobilizing resistance movements with urgent
objectives]{.underline} (strikes, unionization, congresses, positions to
take on elections and wars, "the revolution," etc). Please [resist the
urge to write this question off as the ignorant burbling of an
idealistic wag: What are the goals]{.underline} of the typing and
publishing left [today]{.underline}? If we are, independently or
collectively, organs of a political body, what is our function? Even as
a minor participant in written leftism, [I have the same knee-jerk
responses to this question that most would have. Our function is **to
critique**]{.underline}: [to expose the unseen workings]{.underline} of
unjust power, [to]{.underline} enlighten and "sway public opinion." Our
organs **[take in the world's faults and explain them through a mode of
political criticism]{.underline}** that, for all its variations, is
informed by more-or-less shared notions of anti-capitalist resistance.
We in the left publishing world largely agree that the capitalist
political economy is far-reaching, evil, and violent, and that forms of
injustice (like discrimination, persecution, exploitation, etc.) are
perpetuated by broad social-historical forces whose traces are present
in many institutions and traditions today. This core critique feels
pretty consistent with the work done by radical publications of the
past. But [this]{.underline} hard [work,]{.underline} the work of
critique, [doesn't really qualify]{.underline} us as organs. Even if
they were entirely unrealistic, the [critiques from]{.underline} organs
in **[bygone eras were oriented toward targeted groups achieving
tangible goals]{.underline}**. [Today,]{.underline} by contrast,
[it's]{.underline} seemingly **[a given that critique is an end in
itself]{.underline}**. [The implied, intangible goal]{.underline} of
"raising public [awareness" is enough]{.underline}, and we generally
assume all the [conventional measures of media
success]{.underline}---popularity, **[traffic]{.underline}**, virality,
circulation boosts---[are a useful stand-in metric for attaining that
goal]{.underline}. And [with an abundantly supplied market for left
critique, achieving this goal inherently depends on **strategies of
product differentiation**]{.underline}---or, to borrow an ever-apt
phrase from the Freudian lexicon, **[the narcissism of small
differences]{.underline}**. The leading [venues for political
criticism]{.underline} all [seek to differentiate themselves
through]{.underline} rhetorical s[tyle]{.underline}, layout aesthetic,
and, to some extent, theoretical affiliations. And [they have every
market incentive to push these second-order distinctions **over the
advancement of any clear and overarching visions of what the world
should be and how to go about changing it**]{.underline}. And [as
producers and consumers in this **marketplace of political
criticism**]{.underline}, [we're encouraged]{.underline} not to tie
ourselves down to one look, but [to explore and cherry-pick arguments
from all]{.underline} over **[in a way that expresses the depth and
variation of our leftism while confirming that leftism itself has become
just that---a marketplace.]{.underline}** The function of an organ is
defined by the body it serves. Without a body, it's just greasy tissue.
So, perhaps the better question is: what body (or bodies) are we
serving? Is there a body at all, or has that question become, in an
all-too literal sense, immaterial to us? Behind the thousands of
faceless "likes" and "favorites" and shares and subscriptions, is there
a thunderous thing with teeth and fists? Is there, at this moment, for
instance, a discernible body of and for socialism that we, as organs,
are helping to sustain? I suspect not. [Almost all twenty-first-century
evidence suggests]{.underline}, instead, t[hat the bodies we like to
think we're commanding are disjointed, dispersed, and
shapeless]{.underline}. In fact, they're not bodies at all, just a
thousand points of light trying to outshine each other in cold, dead
space. [Which means we are not organs. At best, we're organs in vitro,
suspended on our own, connected to nothing, taking in raw material
through one rubbery ventricle and passing through another some smart,
different-looking sludge that falls on the floor, splotch]{.underline}.

possible.]{.underline} Many people noted that Hillary's appearance on
the trendy show Broad City simply played to the precise kind of cultured
urbanites who would never have voted for her opponent in the first
place. Meanwhile all of the "yas kweens" and Game of Thrones mashups
served merely to distract from the potent weaknesses of her candidacy.
But [what would happen if that same potent microscope was turned on the
left, post-election]{.underline}? Could the obsession with Richard
Spencer and Milo Yiannopoulos survive the same sorts of questions? It
seems perfectly plain to me that [setting the Spencer punch to the tune
of "Never Gonna Give You Up" is precisely as therapeutic as porting
Hillary into Dr. Who]{.underline}. **[Both do far more to identify the
people creating these memes with a particular social caste than they do
to spread a plausibly constructive political message]{.underline}**.
[Neither is connected to any coherent narrative of political
victory]{.underline}. And [yet the same people who mocked the Hillary
memes now while away long hours delicately adjusting Photoshop layers
for yet another meme of that punch]{.underline}. **[I cannot comprehend
of a consistent, internally-coherent philosophy that sees the former as
worthless and the latter as worthwhile.]{.underline}** Liberals, too,
said "just let us have this," and the answer from the left was a loud
"no." What right does the left now have to demand otherwise for
themselves? "**[Politics is not therapy," it turns out, is a statement
that applies to everyone or no one.]{.underline}**

### L: Protest 

#### Campus protests are a form of "obedient dissidence"- inculcates learned helplessness

**Lee 1-29-16**

(Harold, http://thefutureprimaeval.net/the-obedient-rebel/)

Back [in the 60s, one group of protesters tried a novel
strategy]{.underline} to attack the big banks that they hated. They
distributed flyers around town [telling everyone to withdraw their
entire savings from one particular bank at a preordained
time.]{.underline} In effect, they were trying to create an artificial
run on the bank, with a small core of ideologically committed people
helping to set off a mass panic and withdrawal. For various reasons,
this protest ended up not working -- maybe there weren't enough people
on board, or maybe the bank got wind of this ahead of time and built up
enough reserves that triggering the run became unfeasible. But [what's
remarkable about this story is that these protesters had **a specific
plan to gain power**]{.underline}. They were not just pamphleting and
picketing because that's what protesters are expected to do; rather,
they started with a goal in mind and used in their understanding of the
financial system to actually try to achieve those goals for themselves.
[Compare that to the recent spate of campus protests,]{.underline} from
Oberlin students protesting cultural appropriation in their cafeteria
food to Princeton students demanding that Woodrow Wilson's name be
swapped out for a leftist of more recent provenance. [They do hold a few
rallies, likely because rallies have become part of the grammar for any
political group.]{.underline} But **[beyond that, they're taking no
direct action to actually try to achieve those goals]{.underline}**.
**[Instead, these \"protesters\" act more like
petitioners.]{.underline}** [They write blog posts, look for signatures
on petitioners, and entreat with professors.]{.underline} Rather than
trying to take what is theirs from the hands of an illegitimate
authority, they try to persuade authorities, who they view as entirely
legitimate, to see things their way. Bradley Campbell and Jason Manning
wrote an insightful paper contrasting three different moral regimes. In
an honor culture, you're supposed to defend your honor through your own
personal efforts. In a dignity culture, insults have less impact, and
you're supposed to delegate enforcement to agreed-upon civic
institutions. **[In a victim culture, insults matter a great deal once
again, but the correct response is to assume a powerless victim role and
basically passively request that powerful other people, usually
institutions, step in and do something about it.]{.underline}** Now, I
think [for student protesters, this is usually the objectively correct
strategy in that it implicitly recognizes that universities are both way
more powerful than the protest movements, and have large internal
factions that are likely to be sympathetic to their
petition.]{.underline} So **[assuming a victim role is an efficient way
to get things done.]{.underline}** **[But at the same time, it speaks to
a student culture that has internalized powerlessness]{.underline}**,
cowardice, and lack of agency. [The world is way bigger than you, and
your only hope to get things done is to passively broadcast your
grievances and hope that some other institution takes up your fight.
These are the kids at elite schools in one of the richest countries in
the world]{.underline} [-- if anyone should feel like they have
agency]{.underline}, it should be these guys. Perhaps they're insulated
in a bubble that's force-feeding them signals to conform. Perhaps
they're reacting to a real phenomenon of elite overproduction, so they
are correctly insecure about their future and pessimistic about their
abilities. But it should be a remarkable fact that our future elites
have internalized the idea that taking action on their own is futile,
and that they can only do something remarkable if they make the proper
petitions to vast formless institutions.

### L -- Silver Bullets

#### Overfocus on 'silver bullet' solutions precludes effective organization -- instead, we should learn from [black radical tradition]{.underline} to [anticipate shortcomings]{.underline}, [avoid utopianism]{.underline}, and [improvise while organizing]{.underline} 

**Lennon,** Grad Student @ Yale, **04-22-19** (Myles, Environmental
anthropologist and a former sustainable energy policy practitioner, "No
Silver Bullets," Jacobin,
<https://jacobinmag.com/2019/04/green-new-deal-black-radical-tradition)//EF>

It's no secret that we need to rapidly decarbonize the US economy to
respond to the threat of catastrophic climate change[. But the Green New
Deal's (GND) greatest promise isn't the goal of 100 percent renewable
energy and net-zero carbon emissions by 2030]{.underline}. Its promise
lies instead in the grassroots organizing that's pushed a leftist pipe
dream to the center of congressional politics in a matter of months.
[That activist energy will be key to implementing the underlying
policies that will transform our inequitable, exploitative,
carbon-intensive energy system. Even seemingly technocratic policies to
expand energy efficiency upgrades in buildings --- which Rep. Alexandria
Ocasio-Cortez's GND resolution goes all in on --- require political
struggle on the ground]{.underline}. Take the case of New York State. A
decade ago, working with broad social justice coalitions, the state's
government tried to generate the same upgrades that the GND now proposes
--- and failed. I was a member of the coalition that drove New York's
building upgrade experiment. I saw up close how technocratic policy
divorced from on-the-ground organizing undermined the bold vision laid
out in the legislation. An obsession with targets and timetables
distracted from the imperative to continuously organize for a just and
sustainable tomorrow**[. Instead of chasing silver bullet solutions,
we'd be wise to follow the Black radical tradition: the recognition that
justice is always elusive, that the fight never stops, and that our
movements are, to a degree, ends in and of themselves.]{.underline}**
[Sunrise,]{.underline} a [grassroots movement led by young
people]{.underline} that is fighting for aggressive decarbonization and
green jobs policies, [has propelled the GND into the political
mainstream]{.underline} over the last year. **[In doing so, the movement
has built on years of local and national organizing for an egalitarian,
green economy across the country.]{.underline}** A decade ago I worked
with a statewide coalition of labor unions, environmental justice
organizations, and environmentalists that organized on the ground and
advanced the Green Jobs Green New York Act (GJGNY) --- an ambitious
piece of legislation that established a statewide energy efficiency
program with the same name. Much like the GND resolution, GJGNY aimed to
create quality jobs for workers and communities --- particularly those
plagued by environmental injustice --- while significantly reducing
greenhouse gas emissions through a rapid, state-driven expansion of
sustainable energy. And much like Sunrise, the GJGNY coalition advanced
ambitious legislation by mobilizing communities on the ground while
coordinating with and pressuring elected officials in the halls of
power. Perhaps unwittingly, we took a "silver bullet" approach to social
change, focusing our time, funds, and energy on the single goal of
spurring massive public investments in green jobs and sustainable energy
in a very short timeframe. In other words, our plan to transform the
economy and fight climate change hinged solely on getting legislators to
take bold action; other work toward these ends took a backseat to the
legislative prize. We were obviously jubilant when the governor signed
the GJGNY Act. The legislation established a goal of generating one
million energy efficiency retrofits in just five years while creating
sixty thousand quality green jobs in the process --- exactly the targets
we'd championed. In addition to directing funds toward these bold
objectives, it also codified our vision for an equitable and just green
economy --- a direct product of our aggressive ground game.
Specifically, it prioritized investments in "environmental justice"
communities, namely places "which have been designated as a
nonattainment area for one or more pollutants pursuant to section 107 of
the federal Clean Air Act" (most of which are low- and moderate-income
communities of color); funded green job training and placement for
workers in affected industries; mandated that representatives of unions
and grassroots community groups be involved in the design of the
program; created funds to empower community groups to enable their
communities to access energy efficiency upgrades; and mandated the
creation of an innovating sustainable energy funding mechanism to ensure
that low-income people could access energy efficiency upgrades without
paying a dime. [With the power of the state behind our vision, the
silver-bullet strategy seemed to be working]{.underline}. **[And then it
didn't]{.underline}**. Why New York State's Green Jobs Push Failed When
it was all said and done, GJGNY generated less than twenty-five thousand
retrofits in five years --- a miniscule fraction of our one million goal
--- with scant job creation impacts. The program was a failure for
numerous reasons; this isn't the space to do a comprehensive autopsy,
but I do want to call attention to two of our overarching challenges to
inform today's fight for a GND. First, [the bureaucracy, entrenched
neoliberal interests, and material complexities of our industrial
infrastructure and built environment made rapid transformation far more
complicated than our codified quantitative goal suggested]{.underline}.
**[We found that even when oppressed communities and organized labor
have a seat at the table, and even when progressive legislation is in
place, the agencies and elites that have always governed our energy
system continue to exert their influence]{.underline}**. And the
material process of infrastructural transformation is hard work. [Our
ambitious plans often butted up against human idiosyncrasies,
administrative incompetence, and considerable physical variation in the
built environment we sought to upgrade, creating constant hurdles no
matter how tirelessly we worked to realize our]{.underline} job and
climate [agenda]{.underline}. Just because you have a legislative
commitment to an ambitious goal (and public investments behind it)
doesn't mean that the social, political, and material structures are in
place to actually achieve that goal. The second overarching challenge we
faced was sustaining the incredible ground game that we'd marshaled in
support of the legislation. While the law funded community groups to
help with on-the-ground implementation, the state agency in charge of
the program severely restricted what these groups could and could not
say as formal program ambassadors. These groups were integral to
organizing low-income communities of color to pressure the state to act,
and we had envisioned that they would leverage the program's official
channels and funding to continue their grassroots organizing in support
of community-driven green economy transformations after the GJGNY Act
was signed into law. But [the state's restrictions on organizing
eviscerated the program's activist spirit, sapping the political power
of our coalition's key base-building members.]{.underline} The state
agency in charge of GJGNY made participating community groups sign
contracts that pledged they would only market the program according to
delimited criteria --- which forbade them from prioritizing energy
efficiency companies that promised to hire locally and empower their
communities, and that forbade their energy efficiency outreach workers
from engaging in any political mobilization or organizing involving
homeowners and tenants who they targeted for energy efficiency upgrades.
So when the program encountered bureaucratic, political, and
infrastructural hurdles, we did not have the on-the-ground organizing
presence necessary to continue our fight for a just, sustainable
economy[. Instead, committed, hard-working activists were told that they
could not exercise their organizing muscle if they wanted to continue
participating in the implementation of the program they had worked so
hard to create]{.underline}. Beyond Technocracy [In narrowly focusing on
achieving a silver-bullet solution --- a piece of ambitious legislation
that codified clear quantitative goals --- **we overlooked the reality
that implementation is often far more complicated than
codification.**]{.underline} **[In the process, we lost sight of the
imperative to organize for the long-term, and thus lacked the momentum
to challenge the status quo when things didn't work as we
planned.]{.underline}** As we continue to agitate for GND legislation
with similar, albeit more ambitious quantitative goals, we should heed
the lessons of GJGNY. Decarbonization and energy transitions are
infinitely more complex than the rhetoric of "100 percent renewable
energy" and "millions of green jobs" suggests. When we consider the
extractive, fossil-fueled industries that produce "green" technologies
like solar panels and wind turbines, the often exploitative labor
conditions under which these technologies are made, the carbon footprint
of the commodity markets that bring these technologies to our
communities, and the vast amount of physical space that must be
committed to these technologies to achieve the visionary goals that the
GND lays out, we begin to get a glimpse of the magnitude of the
challenges before us --- challenges that would persist even if we were
able to push through our climate and jobs agenda. Of course, we should
still be doing everything in our power to move toward the goals we've
laid out. We know that we have no choice but to fight urgently and
ambitiously in the face of climate crisis. Through GJGNY, I witnessed up
close the power of bold ideas to inspire people to feel a sense of
possibility and take action. We should not abdicate our radical goals in
the interest of short-term pragmatics. [We can't pin all of our hopes on
a single piece of legislation that promises to move
mountains.]{.underline} While we agitate like hell in the coming years
to get a GND bill signed into law, we must be simultaneously developing
a ground game and organizing apparatus to continually agitate, innovate,
and iterate when we invariably fall short of our wildest dreams**[. In
this spirit, I'm proposing that we move from silver-bullet solutions to
the Black radical tradition. As Gaye Theresa Johnson and Alex Lubin
explain, this tradition "is about questing for freedom" --- "the
necessity of recognizing the importance of struggle regardless of
outcomes." The Black radical tradition reminds us to anticipate
shortcomings, to avoid utopianism, and to embrace the process of
organizing, even as we continue to uphold the vision of the future we're
organizing for.]{.underline}** In doing so, we don't lose momentum or
become disillusioned when a single strategy or policy fails --- we
instead shift gears and navigate the roadblocks that we always face in
fighting for justice. As Black freedom struggles teach us, we cannot
have faith that even the most radical piece of legislation will solve
our intersecting crises --- and we cannot put all of our personal energy
and focus into a sole utopian remedy. And as we organize for a GND, we
can learn the great lesson of GJGNY: the struggle for large-scale
transformation doesn't end when the ink dries on the legislation. We
must build something bigger and more flexible than a congressional
strategy. While many of us fret that the science suggests we have only a
decade to overhaul our entire social, political, and economic system,
the Black experience in this country reminds us of the unthinkable
depths of human resilience. **[We don't have the luxury of deferring
action until tomorrow, but our capacity to fight will endure when we
face the dire circumstances that will unfold if we don't achieve our
most utopian targets. Ultimately, the struggle is all we
have.]{.underline}**

### AT: Bad for Us 

#### Assessing practices only according to their participants ensures there is no ground for criticizing ANY practice. The logic of their position leaves us powerless in the face of fascism. 

Bruce **[ROBBINS]{.underline}** English @ Columbia **['13]{.underline}**
"Why I am not a postsecularist" *boundary 2* 40:1 p. 57-64

However, the project involved a lapse in historical memory, or perhaps
in moral imagination. We neglected to consider that many of history's
worst atrocities, including America's war against the Vietnamese, have
been popular, and not just among the populations committing them. This
is a point that Doug Henwood raises about Naomi Klein's The Shock
Doctrine.4 As Henwood notes, Klein's [journalistic conspiracy-of- the-
elites model of history treats victim and victimizer as if they could be
neatly separated]{.underline}. In fact, neoliberal economic policies
could be instituted in times of disaster not merely because the
government lent its ear to the Chicago-style champions of deregulation
but because belief in the free market was broadly pervasive. More
precisely, free market ideology was embraced by social groups that were
not, objectively speaking, beneficiaries of the free market. It's the
tired old story of false consciousness. Unfortunately, without that
story, history is incomprehensible. [If you look closely at the beliefs
of the victims, you will find nothing that effectively prevents them
from victimizing in their turn]{.underline}**.** [Consider the Boers or
the Israelis. Not only is there no guarantee that the downtrodden will
not go on to tread on others, but there is a well-documented history of
them having already done so while they were victimized]{.underline}.
[Consider the chummy relation between Christian fundamentalism,
widespread among the American poor, and the projects of American
militarism]{.underline}, [to which the American poor are often too
willing to sacrifice themselves]{.underline}. Consider, to return to our
immediate subject, any of the religious beliefs that are now being
brought to light as "new" and "counterhegemonic." In a paper presented
at a conference at Columbia University in 2006, Sarah
[Bracke]{.underline} [and]{.underline} Maggie [Schmitt]{.underline}
[traced]{.underline} the postsecular to "[affirmations of new
subjectivities, knowledges, and understandings of the
world.]{.underline}"5 [The familiar-sounding phrase slips by without
setting off any alarms]{.underline}. There are, of course, religious
beliefs that are new. But their newness offers no certainty that they
will be better than what they succeed, and in any case the new ones seem
to represent a small portion of what is being celebrated by Bracke and
Schmitt, or by the academy's religious revival generally. In fact, "new"
in the sentence quoted mainly refers to beliefs that are not new but
old. Many of these subjectivities, knowledges, and understandings of the
world belong to official or well-established religions, religions that
have long existed in the world and have often wielded considerable power
in it. Indeed, they are arguably responsible for a nonnegligible portion
of the world's suffering and injustice---evidence will not be slow to
suggest itself. [To think of them as "countersubjectivities" is to
pretend they have not yet had a chance to show what they can do and that
given such a chance, they would improve considerably on the existing
historical record]{.underline}. But they have already had quite a lot of
chances, and if you look at the historical record, the results are not
good. To think of them as "resistance" seems less plausible on the face
of it than to think of opposition to them as resistance. For the
postsecularist, what these beliefs are to be honored for resisting is
presumably secularism. Some credit might be awarded to this notion if it
could be established (a) that secularism has had its way in America and
(b) that its presence has been a bad thing for America. Neither of these
propositions can be simply assumed. The best case that can be made for
the second, I think, is William E. Connolly's pragmatic and somewhat
oblique one: that given the force of Christian fundamentalism in
American politics, the Left has no choice but to learn to talk to these
people if it wants to see Tea Party--style energies pushing back against
Tea Party politics. The best case that can be made for the first
proposition is that the separation of church and state---secularism in a
sense that does not absolutely require disbelief in supernatural
agency---is indeed a historical reality, though an imperfect one. In
this sense, yes, of course, s[ecularism is indeed part of the structure
of power in the United]{.underline} [S]{.underline}tates. [Whether you
think this makes it an abomination will depend on your understanding of
power,]{.underline} confusion about which seems to underlie much of the
fuss over the postsecular. 6 For example, [the idea that secularism is
hegemonic depends on the simple mistake that in any given situation,
there exists a single hegemon, a single, quasi-omnipotent, purely
malevolent source for everything in the world that needs to be fought
and changed, from the credit rating agencies to homophobia. Here is
secularized theology with a vengeance. Things are not so
simple]{.underline}. As the prefix post suggests, [one of postsecular's
selling points is novelty.]{.underline} [It lays claim to being the
latest thing, and does so in the very act of taking modernity as its
prime object of reproach]{.underline}. The slipperiness here is worth
attending to. [The real problem]{.underline} of the post in postsecular,
as with the post in postmodern, [is]{.underline} not the misleading
implication that the break with the secular or the modern past is a
clean one (though it never is), but rather [the implication that what
existed before was modern or secular---that those adjectives offer the
best descriptions of that past, that modernity or secularism is
triumphantly central, having beaten out all competitors for the right to
occupy the ground]{.underline}, and can be taken as the decisive term
for how things are. This would have to be shown, and I don't think it
ever could be. [The same holds for terms like Enlightenment or
rationality. It's not that these concepts refer to nothing. But how much
do they refer to?]{.underline} [Do they really deserve the]{.underline}
privilege---a necessarily [rare privilege---of defining the way we live
now]{.underline}? [The way we live now is largely defined, for example,
by the flows of financial capital]{.underline}. [As a means of
allocating resources, is the stock market rational]{.underline}? [Is the
conduct of Standard & Poor's or the Pentagon enlightened]{.underline}?
[No, and no, and most of us would probably prefer for there to be more
rather than less enlightenment and rationality in these
domains]{.underline}. [These are among the considerations that are
shunted aside when rationality]{.underline} or secularism [is assumed to
represent how we are, or were, and when a break with]{.underline}
secularism or [rationality is therefore taken as the defining criterion
of political resistance]{.underline}. Even more crucial to the
postsecular than the new is what I would call the populist, or respect
for the popular as such. Rabbinical authorities in Israel recently
ordered a dog to be stoned to death on the grounds that the dog was the
reincarnation of a lawyer, deceased, who had once insulted the
rabbinical court. (The sentence was disputed by an animal rights group
in New York.)7 Those rabbis have a lot of devoted followers. Supposing
they had even more, it would still not follow that the rabbis' sentence
should be carried out. Only a very misplaced sense of democracy would
lead people to think that because a majority of people believe X, it is
a good thing that they believe X. You can't conclude from the spread of
religion that religion is a good thing any more than you can draw this
conclusion about the spread of AIDS, or poverty, or capitalism. If a
triumphal or providential view of history was a mistake when the secular
Left embraced it, it's just as much of a mistake when the
postsecularists congratulate themselves on the most recent demographics.
Why is it that the wind of postsecularism that is now a large and
unsettling fact of our intellectual weather has been blowing with such
strength and regularity from the cultural disciplines, and in particular
from departments of anthropology? The answer, I have been suggesting, is
[the implicit populism that underlies the anthropological concept of
culture]{.underline} and that [has]{.underline} now [extended
itself,]{.underline} even in that concept's apparent absence, from the
equation "everything is culture" to something like "everything is
religion." You can see the continuity in the work of anthropologist Saba
Mahmood. Mahmood has become a major spokesperson for postsecularism,
largely because she yanks the pilings out from under secular
liberalism's favorite global rhetorical weapon: look how they treat
their women. Her 2005 book, Politics of Piety: The Islamic Revival and
the Feminist Subject, tries to win respect for Egyptian women who
participate in the "piety movement" by showing that there is
self-conscious agency in their submission to the divine will, their
willing embrace of an extremely patriarchal theology.8 In a global
perspective, she suggests, freedom is overrated, a sort of fetish of
Western modernity. [Mahmood may be a severe critic of Western modernity,
but methodologically speaking, she is also very modern.]{.underline} She
is much too modern to invest in such creaky, embarrassingly outdated
technology as the culture concept. [The conceptual apparatus to which
she refers is that of]{.underline} Michel [Foucault]{.underline}, where
the proper name Foucault signifies both "up-to- date" and "not
cultural." Thus [Mahmood describes her subject as "different
configurations of personhood]{.underline} . . . [with each configuration
the product of a specific discursive formation rather than of the
culture at large]{.underline}" (PP, 120--21; my emphasis). [But how far
does a terminology like "specific discursive formation" actually take
her from the distinctive emphases and limitations of
culture,]{.underline} including its impulse to end up in a
self-annihilating abdication to religion? When Mahmood talks of ethics,
calling on Foucault by name, [she defines ethics as "founded upon
particular forms of discursive practice, instantiated through specific
sets of procedures, techniques, and exercises, through which highly
specific ethical-moral subjects come to be forme]{.underline}d" (PP,
120; my emphasis). Forms of discursive practice are not, like culture,
reified essences, frozen in time. Nor do they preclude
self-consciousness, though [there]{.underline} [are]{.underline} other
[postsecularists]{.underline}, [like]{.underline} Colin
[Jager]{.underline}, [who seem to embrace the term practice precisely
because it does make unselfconsciousness into a virtue, or rather a
right that can be demanded]{.underline}**.** Yet [all this repetition of
"specific" and "particular" could certainly be read, symptomatically, as
a compulsive reinscription of another of culture's
characteristics]{.underline}. Here, as elsewhere, Mahmood repeats the
founding gesture of anthropology as a discipline based on the concept of
culture: [the local and the particular are asserted against the
universal and the general.]{.underline} In the same way[, the autonomy
of the subjective is asserted against material explanation or ethical
evaluation.]{.underline} "[An inquiry into ethics from this perspective
requires that one examine not simply the values enshrined in moral
codes, but the different ways in which people live these
codes]{.underline}---something anthropologists are uniquely situated to
observe" (PP, 120). To put it crudely: [what is decisive is how things
look to the participants themselves, without regard to how things might
look to anyone else.]{.underline} Aligning herself with Talal Asad,
[Mahmood]{.underline} [translates tradition as "discursive formation."
She takes the discursiveness seriously,]{.underline} [trying as hard as
possible to credit the vocabulary]{.underline} of religion [deployed by
the subjects themselves as the privileged means]{.underline} [of access
to their self-understanding and to identify that self-understanding as
the true meaning of their actions]{.underline}. In this sense, too, one
might say that her use of Foucault's terminology, though it seems to go
behind the backs of her subjects, does the work of the culture concept.
And more of that work is done by the equally Foucauldian term practice.
To say religion should be considered as a practice is to say that it is
best not considered as, say, a set of statements about the world. This
means that it cannot be judged by its theology or the truth value of its
beliefs. Like culture, it enters into the domain of incorrigibility. No
practice can claim the authority to correct or admonish any other
practice. If they were uncomfortable with this conclusion, Mahmood and
her allies might ask what is excluded by the formula "everything is
practice." Mahmood says explicitly that "[practice]{.underline}"
excludes political questions that are separate from ethics (PP, 119).
That is, it [excludes any exterior judgment on these practices in terms
of their comparative meaning or political ends]{.underline}. I apologize
in advance for the rhetorical overkill here, but it gets us right to the
point: [the kind of case made by Mahmood for her pious women could be
made as easily for, say, a fascist youth movemen]{.underline}**t**.
[From the perspective of the participants, a fascist youth movement,
too, might have to be positively valued for what it gives them: for
example, a sense of self-discipline, belonging, purposefulness, and
collective agency.]{.underline} [When and where does one get to ask
about the larger political meaning of these locally meaningful
practices]{.underline}? Larger political meanings don't seem to have any
place on Mah mood's agenda. [The strategy of the postsecularists can
sometimes appear to involve maneuvering their fellow scholars into a
situation in which such issues need not and cannot be
raised.]{.underline} That takes something off the to-do list of the
specialists, [but to anyone who cares what the humanities looks like to
a larger public, it seems]{.underline} a bit
[irresponsible]{.underline}. [The postsecularists are
antiauthoritarians. But their anti-authoritarianism is disingenuous,
since its effect is to make room for appeals to divine authority, which
outranks all others]{.underline}. Still, they challenge their secular
opponents to concede their own dependence on authorities of some sort,
and I would like to accept that challenge[. Let us consider the actual
procedures by which intellectual authority is exercised in the
academy]{.underline} (which it is). [In my experience, these procedures
are rarely acknowledged, perhaps because they are embarrassingly out of
sync with our democratic self-image]{.underline}. We know, though we are
not eager to say so, that the academy is not, in fact, a perfectly open,
perfectly democratic space where all opinions can always be expressed
and/or are offered equal time. Far from it. [There exists a slow,
mysterious, but more or less efficacious process whereby certain
opinions are little by little dismissed as indefensible and unworthy of
any time at all on our overcrowded syllabi and conference
programs.]{.underline} [This involves neither the brutal extermination
of the dissenters nor tolerant, helplessly uncritical cohabitation with
them.]{.underline} [What happens is that certain beliefs are sidelined
and then silenced. Verbs like sideline and silence are usually assumed
to be academic misdemeanors or worse]{.underline}, [but they stand for
operations that I think most scholars would eventually be ready to
endorse]{.underline}. Those who believe that the world is flat have not
been rounded up and done away with; they have merely lost the
pre-argument about which arguments are worth spilling ink over, and thus
they are no longer heard from. The same for [believers in the inherent
superiority of men to women, or the coming corruption of the white race
by immigrants from Asia, or the idea that the Palestinians exiled in
1948 left their homes voluntarily]{.underline}. [These propositions have
had their glory days; many scholars have held to them fiercely; a few
still do. But now these ideas are nonstarters, and who can regret
it?]{.underline} Is it a scandal that neither their proponents nor their
critics can win funding from foundations? Is it a scandal that there is
no "balance" where they are concerned? "We" are a functional consensus,
at least in the minimal sense that no one insists too loudly that we
should waste our precious waking hours on these ideas anymore. It is to
be hoped that divine intervention in the affairs of men will similarly
subside as an active hypothesis both inside the academy and, above all,
beyond it. If this happens, it will not have been as a result of the
worst tyranny ever exercised by human beings over their fellows. [In the
academy, disinterestedness remains a working rule, and despite much
ideological discord, there is considerable agreement concerning
standards of argument and evidence]{.underline}. The same cannot be said
everywhere.

racialized groups). Whether the issue is the fate of affirmative action
in California at the close of the twentieth century, police brutality in
the inner cities, the treatment of women under the Taliban in
Afghanistan, or the role of the World Trade Organization in maintaining

[Is there such a thing as a leftist foreign policy?]{.underline} [What
are the characteristic views of the left about the world
abroad?]{.underline} When have leftists, rightly or wrongly, defended
the use of force? The arguments about what to do in Syria have led me to
ask these questions, but I am after a more general answer, looking not
only at the left as it is today but also at the historical left. The
questions aren't easy---first, because there have been, and there are,
many lefts; and second, because left views about foreign policy change
more often than left views about domestic society. Relative consistency
is the mark of leftism at home, but that's definitely not true abroad.
Still, it's possible to make out a kind of default position and then to
describe the various alternative positions and the argu - ments for and
against them. I want to join those arguments and suggest why they have
gone well, sometimes, and very badly at other times. The basic position
appears early in recorded history. I first discovered it when reading
the biblical prophets, who have often been an inspiration to Western
leftists. The prophets argued that if the Israelites obeyed the divine
commandments, stopped grinding the faces of the poor, and established a
just society, they would live in their land forever, safe against
Assyrian and Babylonian imperi - alism. Justice would bring
security---and also serve a higher purpose: Israel would be "a light
unto the nations." All that was necessary was to sit still and shine.
This is what I will call [the default position of the left:]{.underline}
[the best foreign policy is a good domestic policy.]{.underline} How
many times have [we argue]{.underline}d [against foreign
adventures]{.underline} and unnec - essary wars [by insisting
that]{.underline} our fellow [citizens would do better to focus
energy]{.underline} and resources **[on injustice at
home]{.underline}**? The class war is often described as an inter -
national conflict, but the battles are almost always local, and the
victories, when they occur, are celebrated at home and only then held up
as examples to be imitated abroad---as Swedish social democracy often
is. Sweden's neutrality is a nice way of having a foreign policy that
doesn't require a foreign policy and leaves maximum room for domestic
advance. The left is most successful in creating decent societies when
it is most intensely engaged at home. Here in the United States, the New
Deal was an American effort to make America a better place; it had
little global resonance, though some American liberals recommended it as
an alternative to fascism and Stalinism. Immediately after 1945, there
was something like a New Deal foreign policy, most visible in the
political reconstruction of Japan, but this did not go along with an
ambitious liberalism at home. Domestic ambition tends to expand in the
(relative) absence of foreign commit -- ments. From the time of the
Russian Revolution, however, this narrow domestic focus has been
challenged by leftists who argued that there couldn't be "socialism in
one country." No left victory would be secure unless it was followed by
many more left victories. This hasn't been an argument only about
socialism. Democracy too is a political formation that won't finally be
"safe" until there are many more democracies. The effort to incite
communist or socialist revolutions in neigh - boring countries or to
promote democracy abroad---by force, but also in other ways---is
probably the most frequent departure from the default position. Consider
the Red Army marching on Warsaw in 1919 to bring communism to Poland.
This was Lenin's war; according to Isaac Deutscher, Trotsky sensibly
opposed it, preferring political rather than military support for
foreign revolutionaries, but since he led the army, he is commonly
identified with the policy of forcibly exporting revo - lution. The
American army marching on Baghdad to bring democracy to Iraq is another
example of the same impulse. This was a war supported by ex-Trotskyist
Iraqi exiles (like Kanan Makiya), by European '68ers (like Adam Michnik
and Bernard Kouchner), and by an odd mix of American leftists and
neoconservative intellectuals. The neocons can plausibly be described as
Trotsky's political descendants, though they have forgotten entirely
about socialism (and even democracy) at home. Most European and American
leftists opposed the Iraq War, an indication that they were engaged in a
different left politics. In the aftermath of the Second World War, there
were significant American efforts to promote democracy abroad---which
can be read as efforts to internationalize the New Deal. The
democratization of Germany is one example, but Japan is a more
interesting case, for there the writing of a democratic consti - tution
was the work of American liberals and leftists (recruited, amazingly, by
Douglas MacArthur), who literally made a revolution in Japanese politics
and society. The new constitution even included a clause about gender
equality, which was not yet a major issue at home. The Marshall Plan is
another example of democratic, though in this case anti-revolu -
tionary, politics abroad. One of its purposes was to strengthen the
democracies of Western Europe against the perceived threat of a
communist takeover. The plan was adopted by a Republican Congress, but
it had strong support on what we might think of as the near-left: the
CIO (after a fierce internal fight) and the newly formed Americans for
Democratic Action. Irving Howe writes in his autobiography that "only
the most doctrinaire Marxists" could dismiss the Marshall Plan as an
imperialist scheme. But Henry Wallace and a host of American
"progressives" insisted that it was exactly that. In fact, as George
Lichtheim argued in 1963 and Nicolaus Mills in 2010 (both of them
regular contributors to Dissent ), the Marshall Plan enhanced the
independence of the countries it helped, even their independence from
the United States. Support for revolutions abroad has obvi - ously not
been a feature of American foreign policy since the Second World War.
Some American leftists have argued that the United States should be
quick to provide assistance, including military assistance, to men and
women fighting against tyrannical govern - ments---as required by the
doctrine of revo - lutionary war. But the more standard left position is
simply that the United States should not help the tyrants, as American
administrations have done so often in Central and South America. As long
ago as 1912, Victor Berger, one of the two Socialists elected to
Congress, argued against an anti- revolutionary intervention in Mexico.
There have been many such arguments since, and they provide at least
passive support to leftist opponents of tyranny abroad---while also
leaving them to win their own battles. Even after the uprisings in
Hungary in 1956 and Czechoslovakia in 1968, I don't think that any
leftists joined the right-wing demand for a forceful "rollback" of the
Soviet empire. Indeed, it took some people on the left a long time to
recognize tyranny in Eastern Europe. But communist dissidents found good
friends, and moral and material support, on the European and American
near-left. As the extent of left opposition to the Iraq War suggests,
the readiness to use force abroad is only an intermittent version of
left politics. A [wholesale rejection of]{.underline} the [use of
force]{.underline} (and a reflexive refusal to vote for the military
budget) [is the]{.underline} more [usual position]{.underline}. [On the
farther left, especially, there is a deep suspicion of anything that
smacks of mili - tarism]{.underline}, and almost all leftists are eager
to support the peacemakers, whenever peace is a real possibility (and
sometimes when it isn't). Hence one standard argument, which is another
version of the default position: it is only militarists and imperialists
who go to war in other people's countries; leftist men and women
understand that it is better to keep the "boys" (as all soldiers once
were) at home. William Appleman Williams, who greatly influenced New
Left attitudes toward foreign policy, argued that "The truly essential
need is to re-examine our conception of saving other people and
societies." The New Left, he wrote, should pursue instead a vision
"based on self-containment and community. . . ." Anti-militarism isn't,
or isn't necessarily, an isolationist politics. It is consistent with
strong support for foreign aid and for inter - national organizations
like the League of Nations, the United Nations, and the World Court. But
it commonly goes along with one or another version of the default
position. Consider Randolph Bourne's fierce critique of pro-war
intellectuals in 1917: "Never having felt responsible for labor wars and
oppressed masses and excluded races at home, they had a large fund of
idle emotional capital to invest in the oppressed nationalities and
ravaged villages of Europe." But the investment, Bourne thought, was a
mistake. So long as "the promise of American life is not yet achieved. .
. . there is nothing for us but stern and intensive cultivation of our
garden." This is an argument that has echoed over the years. Writing in
the aftermath of the Iraq War (which he strongly opposed), Andrew
Bacevich invoked Bourne's line about "our garden" and argued that if we
"live up to our professed ideals . . . we may yet become, in some small
way, a model worthy of emulation"---which is Bacevich's version of
Isaiah's "light unto the nations." This kind of leftism has produced
many fine moments. One of my favorites is the appearance in 1898 of the
Anti-Imperialist League, which campaigned against the American war in
the Philippines. The league's members included Jane Addams, Ambrose
Bierce, John Dewey, Samuel Gompers, Henry and William James, Carl
Schurz, and Mark Twain, all of them arguing that democracy at home could
not endure alongside empire abroad---yet another example of the default
position, though it's probably not true; we held the Philippines for
many years while maintaining something close to democracy at home.
Anti-militarism also produced the campaign of British radicals against
the Boer Wars, the arguments of Bourne and Eugene Debs against America's
entry into the First World War, and the early New Left opposition to the
Vietnam War (later left support for the Viet Cong exemplified a
different politics). All these were wars, so government officials told
the world, to save other people or improve their societies, and in all
these cases the wars' opponents had good reasons to refuse the mission.
But [anti-militarism]{.underline} also [produced one of the worst
moments in left history]{.underline}---the [opposition]{.underline} of
many, though not all, British and French leftists [to rearmament against
Nazi Germany]{.underline} in the 1930s. (For the American version of
this politics, see Norman Thomas and Bertram Wolfe's book, Keep America
Out of War , published in 1939, calling for a "reduction of the size of
the military-naval budget.") The argument for appeasement was mostly a
right-wing argument, but [it was one that many people on the left
supported because they were]{.underline} or thought they were
[anti-every-war]{.underline}. Clement Atlee, leader of the Labour Party,
criticized the Munich Agreement in parliamentary debates; it was, he
rightly said, the betrayal of an ally. But since Atlee's party had
opposed rearmament throughout the thirties, he could not argue in 1938
for a war on behalf of the Czechs---Britain was radi - cally unprepared.
On the Labour Party left, Sir Stafford Cripps opted for the pure default
position, preferring a war against the British ruling class to a war
against Nazi Germany. He thought that the best defense against the Nazis
was a socialist revolution at home. A minority of Labourites were
committed pacifists, but [most]{.underline} party [members would have
supported a war of national defense]{.underline}---[as they later did.
But they refused on principle to anticipate such a war or prepare for
it.]{.underline}

The second shortcut, perhaps even more popular than the first, is to
stand up always against "imperialism"---or, a shortcut inside the
shortcut, always to oppose American policies abroad. Anti-Americanism is
a common left politics, which, again, sometimes gets things right, and
sometimes doesn't. I believe that it got things right in Vietnam in
1967; it mostly got things right from the beginning of the twentieth
century to the end in Central and South America; it got Iran right in
1953 (when leftists criticized the anti-Mossadegh coup), and Iraq in
2003; it gets NAFTA right, and the IMF, too. But that's still not enough
to make it a reliable shortcut. Remember that the defeat of Nazism and
Stalinism, the two most brutal political regimes in world history, was
in significant ways American work. This was work that many people on the
left supported, as we should have. In 1967 Dwight Macdonald wrote to
Mary McCarthy that the American war in Vietnam proved "that despite all
the good things about our internal political-social-cultural life, we
have become an imperialist power, and one that, partly because of these
domestic virtues, is a most inept one." We have continued to be inept:
in December 2005, with 100,000 American soldiers in Iraq, we organized
an election---and our man came in third. This is a result, I think,
without precedent in imperial history. Macdonald's understanding of U.S.
imperialism reflects a political intelligence and a moral balance that
is mostly missing in contemporary anti-American writing. The
anti-American shortcut sometimes produces a short-circuited
politics---as in the Syrian case where leftist writers predicted
terrible consequences if the Americans inter - vened on the side of the
anti-Assad forces. The predictions have come true even though the United
States didn't intervene, but once it was clear that the awfulness was
not America's fault, many leftists simply lost interest--- except for an
ongoing but not very effective engagement on behalf of the war's
victims. [Who was responsible for]{.underline} the ongoing war, for [the
killing]{.underline}, the terror, [and the refugee crisis; what social
forces were involved; what should we (on the left) make of
them]{.underline} **[and how should we respond]{.underline}** to
them[?]{.underline} [This kind of analysis]{.underline}, [standard in
left critiques of impe - rialism]{.underline}, [has]{.underline} mostly
[been missing.]{.underline} [One reason for its absence is that it
offers no opportunity to criticize America;]{.underline} a second reason
is that it would require a close reading and sharp critique of Islamist
politics. Another much-used shortcut (though it doesn't work in the
Syrian case) is to oppose everything Israel does and to blame it for
much that it hasn't done, since it is the "lackey" of American
imperialism or, alternatively, the dominant force in shaping American
foreign policy. The policies of the current Israeli government require
radical criticism---the occupation, the settlements, the refusal to
suppress Jewish hooliganism on the West Bank. Nonetheless, the
anti-Israel shortcut is an example, to paraphrase August Bebel, of the
leftism of fools. The last shortcut is simply to support every
government that calls itself leftist or anti-imperialist and sets itself
against American interests. This is different from the old Stalinist
shortcut: support the Soviet Union whatever it does because it is the
first proletarian dictatorship and the first workers' paradise. That
kind of politics is, I think, definitively finished, though it had a
brief afterlife, focused on China and then, with very few believers, on
Albania and North Korea. The more recent version celebrates Maximal
Leaders like Nasser, Castro, or Hugo Chávez--- along with occasional
short-lived infatuations, as in the case of Michel Foucault and the
future Ayatollah Khomeini. Leftist enthusiasm for populist dictatorships
is one of our sad stories, which ends when resources run out, the
failure to build the economy is suddenly apparent, and the military
takes over. But often the Maximal Leader is a military man himself, and
the repressive role of the army simply becomes more obvious over time.
In Latin America today, the better left is repre - sented by socialists
and social democrats who reject demagogic populism and struggle to
produce economic growth, greater equality, and a stronger welfare
state---and who attract less enthusiasm from American leftists than they
deserve. Most [leftists]{.underline} are idealists, and so we [tend to
idealize other people and to imagine that the world is more hospitable
to our ideas than it actually is.]{.underline} At the same time, we know
better; so I call this the politics of pretending. Consider the response
of many leftists to the al Qaeda attack of 9/11. They argued that the
United States should call the attack a crime and look to the UN and the
International Criminal Court to deal with the criminals. That was the
"Dial 911" response to 9/11 (it has been repeated again and again in
response to later terrorist attacks), and it would have made sense if we
lived in a world that was actually run by the UN and the ICC. But, as I
argued in Dissent at the time, there was no one answering the phone at
911. Self-help isn't, indeed, the only effective and justified response
to criminal attacks; different forms of mutual assistance and collective
security are possible, and the left should take a forward position in
exploring them. But self-help has to be part of the story, given the
world we live in, and it isn't a good idea to pretend otherwise. Another
example: some leftists who opposed the Kosovo intervention argued that
it didn't have what every legal and justified use of force requires: UN
authorization. Indeed, it didn't. The UN Security Council is incapable,
almost all the time, of acting in a timely way. Think of the Vietnamese
invasion of Cambodia to shut down the killing fields; or the Indian
invasion of East Pakistan, now Bangladesh, to end the terror there; or
the Tanzanian invasion of Uganda to overthrow the murderous regime of
Idi Amin. None of these had or could have gotten UN approval. Many
leftists opposed each of these interventions, pretending that the UN was
already what leftists want it to be, an effective political agent. It
isn't that, and so the unilateral use of force is often, as Jürgen
Habermas said of the Kosovo case, "illegal but morally necessary." [The
best]{.underline} and last example [of left]{.underline}ist [pretending
is]{.underline} the [insistence on the reason - ableness of people who
give no sign of being reasonable.]{.underline} Paul Berman writes of the
[large numbers of French socialists who supported the Munich Agreement
that "they gazed across the Rhine and simply refused to believe that
millions of upstanding Germans had enlisted in a political movement
whose animating principles were paranoid conspiracy theories \[and\]
blood-curdling hatreds.]{.underline} . . ." In the same spirit, many
leftists were eager to describe the Chinese communists as "agrarian
reformers." And many today have been quick to grant the legitimacy of
Islamist opposition to American bases in Saudi Arabia, say, or to the
exis - tence of Israel---and to ignore the demand for a shari'a state
and the radical subordination of women. [I am fairly sure that most of
the people involved in all these cases knew, deep down, that they were
pretending.]{.underline} There is a lot to be said for the default
position. We should work in the place we know best to make things
better. The improvement of humanity begins at home. This argument has
special force for Americans, who live in an increasingly inegalitarian
society that is also a near-hegemonic world power: we need to be wary of
adventures abroad that make our work at home more difficult. Still,
[good leftists can't avoid internationalism.]{.underline} [We can't
escape]{.underline} what Václav Havel in 1993 called "the
[feeling]{.underline} of [co-responsibility for the world]{.underline}."
Our deepest commitment is solidarity with people in trouble, and **[some
of the worst troubles]{.underline}**---poverty, [hunger, tyranny, and
mass murder]{.underline}---[are being experienced right now in other
people's countries.]{.underline} So we are going to be engaged again and
again in arguments about what we can do to help. [There is no
magic]{.underline}al way of [getting these argu - ments right.
But]{.underline} certain [ideological positions, rigidly
held]{.underline}, [are]{.underline} almost [**certain to get them
wrong**:]{.underline} [that the use of force is never
justified]{.underline}; [that "imperial" powers]{.underline}, like the
[U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates, [can **never** act
well]{.underline} in the world; and that revo - lutionaries and fighters
for liberation, populist leaders and political vanguards, must never be
criticized. In all these cases, ideological commitment [means that we
will only get things right by accident.]{.underline} Political
intelligence and moral sensitivity work much better than ideology, and
it is these two that should guide our choice of comrades and our
decisions about when and how to act abroad. Dictators and terrorists are
never our comrades, but only those men and women who really believe in,
and who practice, democracy and equality. We should act abroad only with
those who share our commitments, and we should act only in ways
consistent with those commitments. Leftists have done that often in the
past, but often also, we have not: we have mistaken or betrayed our
comrades and acted in ways that did not serve either democracy or
equality. We need to learn from our history---and the first lesson is
this: no more shortcuts, no more pretending.

#### They separate between inside/outside in explaining the effects of colonialism. Starting with the "inside" of the U.S. as the *core* for explaining techniques of social control reproduces Eurocentric histories. 

Alexander **[BARDER]{.underline}** Politics & IR @ Florida Int'l
**['15]{.underline}** *Empire Within: International Hierarchy and its
imperial laboratories of governance* p. 4-6

To be sure, such a question has been posed by [anthropologists, imperial
historians, sociologists and literary critics]{.underline} for some
time. Many [have shown]{.underline} how [imperial spaces constituted
important \"laboratories of modernity]{.underline}**.\"** They have also
shown how there were significant \"tensions of empire\" in which
European imperial powers were historically as much constituted by their
imperial projects as by intra-European or domestic developments.15
Colonial laboratories emerged for various reasons: either because
[colonial domains allowed imperial officials much greater leeway in
enacting policies perceived to be \"modern\" (i.e. particularly in the
realm of urban planning and public health)]{.underline} or because
imperial officials were faced with significant local resistance, a lack
of knowledge about the spatial and population identity or generalized
lack of administrative capabilities that required innovations in
colonial governance. However, as I will argue, international relations
[theorists have not]{.underline} sufficiently [grappled with the
implications of seeing imperial spaces and the transnational relations
that emanate from them as central features of international
politics.]{.underline} This should be considered surprising and
unsurprising at the same time. In an era of so-called globalization, the
material and ideational flows of capital, knowledge, and technological
innovations circulate at increasing speeds, cutting across nation-state
boundaries. Such flows continuously affect the sociopolitical and
cultural formations imbricating the developed and developing world under
conditions of unequal exchange. 16

Yet, [canonical approaches to international theory continue to be wedded
to a specific representation of the international system that obfuscates
the reverberating impacts of such hierarchical relations]{.underline}.
This representation takes as central the shifting patterns of great
power interactions as the dominant features of the international, while
leaving to the side histories involving asymmetric or hierarchical
relations of rule. The persistence of this representation reflects two
ontological commitments. First, is the continued predominance of the
concept of anarchy and a notional image of equal sovereign states.
Second, [is a commitment to a Eurocentric understanding of how norms
constitute the international social world.]{.underline} [IR theories
continue to privilege a certain Western historical moment and reify it
into the fulcrum of sociopolitical modernity without taking into account
the reverse impacts of norms and practices that emerge within the
historical crucibles of Western empires]{.underline}. My purpose in this
book is to question these two central working assumptions of mainstream
approaches to international theory. Here I would like to justify this by
making three central claims.

First, I claim that international hierarchy is historically and today a
significant feature of international life. The concept of anarchy in
international theory typically refers to the lack of a centralized
governmental apparatus that allows for the adjudication of international
disputes between states. It is often conceived as a transhistorical
condition, particularly in neorealist accounts of international
politics, and governs state identity as intrinsic security maximizers.
However, [the prevalence of forms of international hierarchy can be
observed by the ubiquitous feature of empire-building in
history]{.underline}.17 Indeed, David [Lake and]{.underline} John
[Ikenberry take seriously the hierarchies between states to explain the
prevalence of international orders]{.underline}. 18

Their work focuses on describing how international hierarchy operates
according to relations of authority and legitimacy. Lake, for example,
defines hierarchy in relational terms as \"the extent of the authority
exercised by the ruler over the ruled.\" 19 Authority becomes a central
facet of international politics; its exercise being predicated on the
establishment of legitimacy whether in the form of international
\"rules\" (preferable for Lake) or coercion. In other words, we should
understand the history of international relations as a patchwork of
various forms of hierarchical relations embodying aspects of authority
and gradated or disaggregated forms of sovereignty. However, in this
work I consider in greater detail the particular cases of formal and
informal empire as examples of international hierarchy. Second, I claim
that [this condition of international hierarchy is characterized by a
diffusion of norms, practices, knowledge and culture that is
multidirectional]{.underline}. Here I [wish to contest the predominant
perceptions within much of international theory, including the
approaches to hierarchy]{.underline} established by Lake and Ikenberry,
t[hat such patterns of international hierarchy are
unidirectional]{.underline}.

[Their work implies a process of diffusion that occurs from the great
powers or core imperial or hegemonic states to a passive and receptive
periphery]{.underline}. Instead, I wish to show that [imperial domains
are important staging grounds for the innovation, experimentation and
implementation of techniques of state practice.]{.underline} In essence,
[they are \"laboratories of normalization\" that create new objects or
targets of governmental practice]{.underline}. Significantly, some of
these practices are repatriated in ways that influence and constitute
how states govern their own populations.

Third, I claim that state formation is a combination of diffuse and
heterogeneous elements and practices about governing various kinds of
populations (domestic, subaltern, elites, etc.) that coalesce
historically into various apparatuses of control. Here I am motivated by
Michel Foucault\'s concept of governmentality.2° Foucault\'s histories
of governmentality are circumscribed within a European territorial
space; I internationalize the applicability of Foucault\'s concept by
looking specifically at the ramifications of transnational and imperial
hierarchical relations of governance.2 1 My argument is that imperial
history cannot remain \"outside\" the history of international politics
and thus inconsequential to an understanding of the development of
modern state practice. By contrast, I want to emphasize, following Gary
Wilder, the idea that [the]{.underline} state, the dominant unit of
analysis in international relations theory, was and is in fact an
[\"imperial nation-state]{.underline},\" one that [is \"an artifact of
colonial modernity]{.underline}.\"22 \"\[I\]mperialism,\" Wilder
continues, \"created novel sociopolitical formations that were
irreducibly different from those in the West yet were incontestably
modern and inseparable from their European counterparts.\"23

To summarize then, I make three arguments in this work: International
relations of hierarchy (specifically imperial or hegemonic relations)
constitute significant circuits for the multidirectional flow of norms,
practices and technologies of governance. These [norms, practices and
technologies of governance emerge out of imperial laboratories that
pioneer new forms of violence, social control]{.underline}
and[,]{.underline} more generally, disciplinary practices. [These new
forms of violence, social control and disciplinary practice are central
for understanding the manner in which modern Western states emerge and
govern]{.underline}.

While I began this introduction with a discussion of the recent American
foray into Iraq as a way of highlighting how innovations accrued in such
neoimperial domains can reverberate back into the domestic sphere (more
on this in the concluding chapter), by no means is the United States the
main focus in my work . As I attempt to show, what I am emphasizing are
processes of imperial experimentation and innovation that are part of
these international hierarchical relations. If I return to the US in
various chapters it is mainly for two reasons. First, the focus of this
work is mainly tied to specific developments in the late nineteenth
century and mid-to-late twentieth century. My interest in the nineteenth
century in particular is that many significant developments - such as
empire-building - are often not accorded the same importance as
intra-European politics. As Barry Buzan and George Lawson argue,
international theorists often construe the nineteenth century as simply
a data set for constructing parsimonious theories of IR . 24 Moreover,
it was during these time periods when the emergence of American power
either began to rise substantially or was fundamentally called into
question by the set of hegemonic crises of the 1960s and 1970s. In other
words, the past century or so marked the US as a significant global
power that ultimately had important ramifications for the trajectory of
its own domestic sphere. Second, if I turn to the US at multiple points
in the book it is because [I wish to]{.underline}, in a sense, [disabuse
\"American IR \" of an often implicit assumption about the particular
uniqueness of American international political development]{.underline},
[and to problematize the rigid separation between its own \"inside\" and
\"outside.\"]{.underline} Instead, as I wish to show, [the practice of
international hierarchy through American hegemony makes it just as prone
to patterns of disciplinary innovations and experimentation in the
periphery as other imperial powers that have normative ramifications for
American liberal democracy.]{.underline} This is something, I believe,
that is missing in many discussions of American unipolarity or concerns
with the longevity of American hegemony.

### AT: K of Impact 

#### Our moralistic framing is crucial to grab attention and drive media coverage- more nuanced depictions get ignored 

**Schoen 18**

[Over 10,000 civilians are dead, and 17 million more are in
crisis]{.underline} or emergency food situations [in Yemen]{.underline},
according to the World Food Program. The banking system has fallen
apart, the nominal government remains powerless, and the World Health
Organization estimates that 14.8 million people lack access to basic
health care. [The Yemeni Civil War is possibly the largest humanitarian
crisis in the world right now]{.underline}. [However]{.underline}, as
air strikes and effective port blockades persist and innocent civilians
continue to die, [Google search data suggests that relative **world-wide
interest tilts heavily towards the Syrian Civil War**]{.underline},
[with little thought given to the Yemeni Civil Wa]{.underline}r. Huge
spikes in the former's search prevalence occurred during instances like
the exchange of missile fire between Israel and Syria in March of 2017,
but significant developments in the Yemen situation have not generated
as much interest based on the Google data. Connor_Graph2The [lack of
coverage on and interest in the Yemeni Civil War can be explained by the
international context]{.underline} in which this battle is being fought.
[Whereas the Syrian conflict can be portrayed as a group of oppressed
rebels rising up a]{.underline}gainst a corrupt Assad regime, [the
Yemeni war cannot be reduced to such a revolutionary
dichotomy]{.underline}. Moreover, the reduced prevalence of terrorism in
the Yemeni crisis, along with numerous journalistic obstacles, inhibit
increased reporting on this subject. While some news sources like the
New York Times have increased their coverage of the war in recent
months, many observers continue to describe the conflict as a "forgotten
war." The Ethical Dilemma [The Yemeni Civil War cannot be framed within
the context of preexisting models of triumphant rebellions or positive
American interventionism]{.underline}. On the ground level, the Yemeni
Civil War is a fight between the Hadi Regime, supported by Saudi Arabia,
and members of the Houthi movement, supported by Iran. Thus, the war is
not painted as an oppressed group of rebels rising up against a corrupt
government, but rather, as a fierce, violent insurgency attacking a
well-established government, threatening Middle Eastern stability. Both
the Houthis and the Saudi-led coalition are guilty of murdering innocent
civilians and escalating the point of humanitarian crisis. While the
Saudis have essentially blockaded Hodeidah --- a crucial port through
which people in eastern Yemen receive food and other key resources ---
the Houthis have fired a ballistic missile that came very close to
hitting the Saudi capital of Riyadh. Thus, it is not easy to fully
support one side over the other with complete moral certainty. Compare
this situation to Syria, where U.S.-backed rebels are fighting the
Iranian- and Russian-backed Assad regime. This story, of the United
States supporting underdogs in an unfair battle against a brutal
government, is much easier to sell than the one of the United States
backing a weak, corrupt government to protect its alliance with Saudi
Arabia. [What results from this dichotomy is a pragmatic, tacit
avoidance of the issue, both in terms of media coverage and public
interest.]{.underline} The ISIS Factor One other factor that might
contribute to differences in public interest around Yemen and Syria is
the greater prominence of ISIS in Syria. While ISIS has been losing
significant ground in Syria, the terrorist group still remains a
prominent point of discussion within the context of this issue. Although
al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula is exploiting territorial disputes for
its own advantage in Yemen, discussion of its activities in Yemen is a
lot less common than that of ISIS in Syria. Google search trends
indicate that the public's interest in the "Islamic State of Iraq and
the Levant" far outstrips their concern for the "Al-Qaeda Insurgency in
Yemen." Ultimately, the terrorism of the Syrian Civil War has grabbed
public attention in a way that the situation in Yemen has not. With the
tragedy of September 11 and many recent attacks fresh in the minds of
Western audiences, the atrocities in Syria seem to have been more
emotionally resonant. The Saudis and Other Practical Difficulties Beyond
the ethical dilemmas in covering Yemen and the lack of a significant
ISIS presence there, other more practical obstacles have prevented
reporting on this humanitarian crisis. Namely, Yemen is an extremely
hard country to gain access to, especially with recent bombings and an
overall increase in violence. Additionally, the Saudis have impeded
journalists' access to and coverage of unraveling events. Over the
course of the summer, the Saudi government blocked several prominent BBC
journalists from entering Yemen, despite the fact that they had all the
necessary paperwork. Some have even speculated this is due to the United
States' close alliance with Saudi Arabia. The Humanitarian Factor
[Despite]{.underline} all three of these major [obstacles, coverage of
the Yemeni Civil War has increased over the past few months]{.underline}
--- potentially due to the increased severity of the humanitarian crisis
--- **[which has spurred greater public interest in the
issue.]{.underline}** [Similar to the effect that the images of ISIS
killings had on viewers and consumers, pictures of millions of starving,
innocent Yemenis have been **emotionally resonant**]{.underline}. Thus[,
publications have been able **to turn more towards reporting on this
atrocity, avoiding the complicated international context and framing it
within a humanitarian context.**]{.underline} The [Yemen]{.underline}i
Civil War **[is a prime example of how the inability to present a clear,
moralistic narrative on a given conflict deters media
coverage]{.underline}**. [Such nuance obscures public interest and
eliminates the possibility of a quick, easy, catch-all headline for
readers. Only by reframing the conflict as a humanitarian crisis has the
media been able to raise public awareness of the issue.]{.underline}

#### We'll straight turn this- discussing body counts is the ONLY way to hold perpetrators responsible for imperial violence-rejecting them erases the victims from history 

**Chernus, PhD, 03**

(Ira, Religion@Boulder,"Bring Back the Body Count,",
http://www.commondreams.org/views03/0401-12.htm4-1)

[\"We don\'t do body counts,\"]{.underline} says America\'s
soldier-in-chief, Tommy Franks. [That\'s a damn shame. During the
Vietnam war]{.underline}, the body count was served up every day on the
evening news. While Americans ate dinner, they watched a graphic visual
scorecard: how many Americans had died that day, how many South
Vietnamese, and how many Communists. At the time, [it seemed the height
of dehumanized violence]{.underline}. Compared to Tommy Franks\' new way
of war, though, the old way looks very humane indeed. [True, the body
count turned human beings into abstract numbers. But it required
soldiers to say to the world, \"Look everyone. I killed human beings
today]{.underline}. This is exactly how many I killed. I am obliged to
count each and every one.\" [It demanded that the killers look at what
they had done]{.underline}, think about it (however briefly), [and
acknowledge their deed. It was a way of taking responsibility. Today\'s
killers]{.underline} avoid that responsibility. They [perpetuate the
fiction so many Americans want to believe-that no real people die in
war, that it\'s just an exciting video game. It\'s not merely the dead
who disappear; it\'s the act of killing itself]{.underline}. When the
victim\'s family holds up a picture, U.S. soldiers or journalists can
simply reply \"Who\'s that? We have no record of such a person. In fact,
we have no records at all. We kill and move on. No time to keep records.
No inclination. No reason.\" This is not just a matter of new
technology. There was plenty of long-distance impersonal killing in
Vietnam too. But back then, the U.S. military at least went through the
motions of going in to see what they had done. True, the investigations
were often cursory and the numbers often fictional. [No matter how
inaccurate the numbers were, though, the message to the public every day
was that each body should be counted. At some level, at least, each
individual life seemed to matter.]{.underline} The difference between
Vietnam and Iraq lies partly in overall strategy. In Vietnam, there was
no territory to be conquered and occupied. If U.S. forces seized an
area, they knew that sooner or later the Viet Cong would take it back.
The only way to measure \"victory\" was by killing more of them than
they killed of us. In Iraq, the goal is control of place. U.S. forces
can \"take\" Basra or Nassiriya and call it a victory, without ever
thinking about how many Iraqis had to be killed in the process. So the
body count matters less. However, the end of body counts can not be
explained simply by the difference in strategy. The old-fashioned body
counts disappeared during the first war against Iraq, when the goal was
still defined by territory: pushing Iraqi forces out of Kuwait. So It\'s
much more likely that \"we don\'t do body counts\" because Vietnam
proved how embarrassing they could be. As the U.S. public turned against
that war, the body count became a symbol of everything that was inhumane
and irrational about that war. The Pentagon fears that the same might
happen if the Iraq war bogs down. How much simpler to deny the
inhumanity and irrationality of war by denying the obvious fact of
slaughter. [What I fear is a world where thousands can be killed and no
one is responsible, where deaths are erased from history as soon as they
happen. The body count was more than an act of responsibility. It was a
permanent record. It made each death a historical fact]{.underline}. You
can go back and graph those Vietnam deaths from day to day, month to
month, year to year. [That turns the victims into nameless, faceless
abstractions. But it least it confirms for ever and ever that they lived
and died, because someone took the time to kill and count them. In Iraq,
it is as if the killing never happened. When a human being\'s death is
erased from history, so is their life. Life and death together vanish
without a trace]{.underline}. The body count has one other virtue. It is
enemy soldiers, not civilians, who are officially counted. Antiwar
activists rightly warn about civilian slaughter and watch the toll rise
at www.iraqbodycount.org. It is easy to forget that the vast majority of
Iraqi dead and wounded will be soldiers. Most of them were pressed into
service, either by brute force or economic necessity. As the whole world
has been telling us for months, there is no good reason for this war, no
good reason for those hapless Iraqi foot-soldiers to die. They are
victims of brutality-inflicted by their own government and by ours-just
as much as the civilians. They deserve just as much to be counted [So
let us bring back the body count. If we must kill, let us kill as one
human being to another, recognizing the full humanity of our victims.
Without a body count, our nation becomes more of a robotic killing
machine. As we dehumanize Iraqis, we slip even further into our own
dehumanization. Let us bring back the body count. if only to recover our
own sense of responsibility to the world\'s people, to history, to our
own humanity]{.underline}.

### AT: Powerless/Political Exclusion 

#### Belief in powerless is persuasive because it alibis past failures

**Berman, PhD Harvard, 82**

(Marshall, All That is solid Melts Into Air)

Just about the only writer of the past decade who has had anything
substantial to say about modernity is Michel [Foucault]{.underline}. And
what he [has]{.underline} to say is [an endless, excruciating series of
variations on the Weberian themes of the iron cage and the human
nullities whose souls are shaped to fit the bars]{.underline}. [Foucault
is obsessed with prisons, hospitals, asylums]{.underline}, with what
Erving Goffman has called \"total institutions.\" Unlike Goffman,
however, [Foucault denies the possibility of any sort of
freedom]{.underline}, either outside these institutions or within their
interstices. [Foucault\'s totalities swallow up every facet of modern
life.]{.underline} [He develops these themes with **obsessive
relentlessness** and, indeed, with **sadistic flourishes**]{.underline},
clamping his ideas down on his readers like iron bars, [twisting each
dialectic into our flesh like a new turn of the screw. Foucault reserves
his most savage contempt for people who imagine that it is **possible
for modern mankind to be free**]{.underline}. Do we think we feel a
spontaneous rush of sexual desire? We are merely being moved by \"the
modern technologies of power that take life as their object,\" driven by
\"the deployment of sexuality by power in its grip on bodies and their
materiality, their forces, their energies, sensations and pleasures.\"
[Do we act politically, overthrow tyrannies, make
revolutions,]{.underline} create constitutions to establish and protect
human rights? [Mere juridical regression\" from the feudal ages, because
constitutions and bills of rights are merely \"the forms that \[make\]
an essentially normalizing power acceptable]{.underline}.\"�6 Do we use
our minds to unmask oppression-as Foucault appears to be trying to do?
Forget it, because all forms of inquiry into the human condition
\"merely refer individuals from one disciplinary authority to another,\"
and hence only add to the triumphant \"discourse of power.\" Any
criticism rings hollow, because the critic himself or herself is \"in
the panoptic machine, invested by its effects of power, which we bring
to ourselves, since we are part of its mechanism.\" �7 [After being
subjected to this for a while, we realize that there is no freedom in-
Foucault\'s world, because his language forms a seamless web, a cage far
more airtight than anything Weber ever dreamed of]{.underline}, **[into
which no life can break]{.underline}**. **[The mystery is why so many of
today\'s intellectuals seem to want to choke in there with
him.]{.underline}** [The answer]{.underline}, I suspect, [is that
Foucault offers a generation of refugees from the 1 960s a
world-historical alibi for the sense of passivity and helplessness that
gripped so many of us in the 1 970s. There is no point in trying to
resist the oppressions and injustices of modern life, since even our
dreams of freedom only add more links to our chains; however, once we
grasp the total futility of it all, at least we can relax]{.underline}.

### AT: Race= Root Cause 

#### Race [isn't the root cause]{.underline} of nuclear weapons or war, but the case [does]{.underline} turn their impact

**Horgan 14 --** John Horgan, Director of the Center for Science
Writings at Stevens Institute of Technology, "To End War, Focus on
Culture Rather than \"Root Causes\"", Scientific American, 8-18,
https://blogs.scientificamerican.com/cross-check/to-end-war-focus-on-culture-rather-than-root-causes/

When I started researching war, [I]{.underline} also [assumed that to
get rid of war, we have to get rid of its root causes. The trouble is,
scholars have identified countless causes of war. One
pseudo-explanation]{.underline} (which I\'m glad Kloor does not mention,
and which I rebut early on in my book and in posts such as this) [is
that war stems from]{.underline} a compulsion bred into our ancestors by
natural selection. [Biology]{.underline} underpins war, as it underpins
all human behaviors. The crucial question is, why does war break out in
certain places and times and not others?

[The most popular non-biological explanations]{.underline} of war
[are]{.underline} what I call [the **Malthusian** and **Marxist**
hypotheses. The first]{.underline} posits [that war stems from our
tendency to over-reproduce and hence fight over land and other
resources. The second holds that war stems from inequality, the tendency
of societies (especially capitalist ones) to divide into haves and
have-nots]{.underline}.

[Scholars have]{.underline} also [blamed wars on **religion**,
**racism** and **nationalism**]{.underline}, which Kloor mentions above,
[as well as such **fundamental social traits** as hierarchy, sexism and
injustice. If you **cherry pick**, you **always find evidence** to
support your favorite theory]{.underline}.

[But as scholars]{.underline} such as Lewis Fry Richardson (whom my
friend David Berreby recently profiled) [have shown]{.underline},
neither the Malthusian and Marxist theories **[no]{.underline}**r any of
the other **[explanations above can account for the vast diversity of
wars]{.underline}**. Moreover, [some factors that provoke
conflict]{.underline}, such as religion, [can also inhibit
it]{.underline}. Religion has inspired some of our greatest antiwar
leaders, notably Gandhi and Martin Luther King.

I have found [only one theory of war that fits the facts]{.underline}.
The theory holds [that war is a self-perpetuating, contagious meme,
which can propagate **independently of other social and environmental
factors**]{.underline}. As anthropologist Margaret Mead put it in a
famous 1940 essay, \"Warfare Is Only an Invention---Not a Biological
Necessity.\"

In other words, the major cause of war is war itself, which has a
terrible tendency to spread even to societies that would prefer to
remain peaceful. I make this point in my book and in a 2010 blog post,
\"Margaret Mead's war theory kicks butt of neo-Darwinian and Malthusian
models.\" Here is an edited excerpt:

In his 1997 book War Before Civilization, anthropologist Lawrence Keeley
notes that war among North American Indians often stemmed from the
aggression of just a few extremely warlike tribes, \"rotten apples that
spoiled their regional barrels.\" He added, \"Less aggressive societies,
stimulated by more warlike groups in their vicinity, become more
bellicose themselves.\"

Societies in a violent region, the political scientist Azar Gat
emphasizes in his 2006 book War in Human Civilization, have a strong
incentive to carry out preemptive attacks. Societies may \"attack the
other side in order to eliminate or severely weaken them as a potential
enemy. Indeed, this option only makes the other side more insecure,
rendering the security dilemma more acute. War can thus become a
self-fulfilling prophecy. The fear of war breeds war.\"

[Many people are **pessimistic** about ending war because they assume it
will require **radical social engineering**. World peace will require
eliminating poverty, inequality, sexism, **racism** or **\[fill in the
blank\]**.]{.underline} We will need to eradicate religion, or all
embrace the same religion. We will need to get rid of all nation states
and become anarchists, or form a single global government.

[My analysis]{.underline} of war [suggests that if we want to end war,
**we don\'t need to create a society radically different** from our own,
let alone a utopia. If we want to end war, we should focus on ending
war]{.underline} and the culture of war [rather than on **supposed
causal factors**. If we can do that, we will **take a major step toward
solving many**]{.underline} of our **[other social
problems]{.underline}**, as I argued in my previous post.

And that brings me to Keith Kloor\'s final challenge to me. He devotes
much of his column to a discussion of how extremists on both sides of
the conflict between Israel and Palestine have \"hijacked the peace
process. Horrific spasmodic cycles of violence and death is the
result.\" He asks me how we can \"rid the world of extremist groups that
sow the seeds of war.\"

[Kloor has]{.underline} his [**causation backwards**. Just as war
promotes poverty, tyranny, inequality and resource depletion **at least
as much as vice versa**]{.underline}, so war promotes fanaticism. Once
militarism seizes hold of a society, it can transform vast populations
into virtual sociopaths. It turns decent, ethical, reasonable people
into intolerant fanatics capable of the most heinous acts.

[Breaking out of]{.underline} what Kloor calls \"spasmodic [cycles of
violence]{.underline} and death\" [can be]{.underline} extraordinarily
[difficult, but history offers many examples of societies that have done
just that. Germany and France were bitter, bloody rivals for centuries.
But it is now inconceivable that Germany and France]{.underline}---or
any members of the European Union\--[would go to war]{.underline}
against each other.

[One of my favorite examples of a nation that has renounced militarism
is Costa Rica]{.underline}. Like many of its neighbors in Central
American, Costa was once wracked by terrible violence. But [after a
bloody civil war in the 1940s, Costa Rica disbanded its
army]{.underline}, freeing up more funds for education, health care,
transportation and tourism. It is often ranked as one of the most
peaceful, healthy, \"happy\" nations in the world.

## Impacts 

### I: Politics Matter- Epistemology 

#### Rejecting politics makes their project flawed epistemologically- it unbalances the equation resulting in fetishization of representational practice 

**Kellner, PhD, 95**

(Douglas, [Cultural studies, identity and politics between the modern
and the postmodern]{.underline})

While emphasis on the audience and reception was an excellent correction
to the one-sidedness of purely textual analysis, I believe that in
recent years [cultural studies has overemphasized]{.underline} reception
and [textual analysis]{.underline}, [while underemphasizing]{.underline}
the production of culture and its **[political economy]{.underline}**.34
While earlier, the Birmingham group regularly focused attention on media
institutions and practices, and the relations between media forms and
broader social forms and ideologies, this emphasis has waned in recent
years, to the detriment of much current work in cultural studies, I
would argue. For instance, in his classical programmatic article,
"Encoding/Decoding," Stuart [Hall began his analysis by using Marx's
Grundrisse]{.underline} as a model to trace the articulations of "a
continuous circuit," encompassing---
production---distribution---consumption---production" (1980b:128ff.). He
concretizes this model with focus on how media institutions produce
messages, how they circulate, and how audiences use or decode the
messages to produce meaning. [Hall claimed that]{.underline}: The
[**abstraction of texts from the social practices** which produced them
and the institutional sites where they were elaborated was a
**fetishization...**]{.underline}. [This obscured how a particular
ordering of culture came to be produced and sustained: the circumstances
and conditions of cultural reproduction which the operations of the
'selective tradition' **rendered natural, 'taken for
granted**]{.underline}.'But the process of ordering (arrangement,
regulation) is always the result of concrete sets of practices and
relations. (Hall 1980a:27) Against the erasure of the system of cultural
production, distribution, and reception, Hall called for problematizing
culture and "making visible" the processes through which certain forms
of culture became dominant (ibid.).35 Raymond Williams, one of the
formative influences on British cultural studies, called for a "cultural
materialism...the analysis of all forms of signification...within the
actual means and conditions of their production" (1981:64--5), focusing
attention on the need to situate cultural analysis within its
socio-economic relations. Moreover, in a 1983 lecture published in
1985/6, Richard Johnson provided a model of cultural studies, similar to
Hall's earlier model, based on a model of the circuits of production,
textuality, and reception, parallel to the circuits of capital stressed
by Marx, illustrated by a diagram that stressed the importance of
production and distribution. Although Johnson emphasized the importance
of analysis of production in cultural studies and criticized Screen for
abandoning this perspective in favor of more idealist and textualist
approaches (pp. 63ff.), much work in cultural studies has replicated
this neglect. One could indeed argue that [most recent cultural studies
have tended to neglect analyses of the circuits of political economy and
production in favor of text- and audience-based analyses.]{.underline}
Furthermore, [there is a danger that cultural studies]{.underline} in
various parts of the world **[might lose the critical and political
edge]{.underline}** of earlier forms of British cultural studies.
[Cultural studies could easily **degenerate into a sort of eclectic
populism**]{.underline} of the sort evident in some of the work of the
Popular Culture Association [which is **largely celebratory and
uncritical of the textual artifacts** that it deals with.]{.underline}
[Neglecting political economy, celebrating the audience and the
pleasures of the popular]{.underline}, neglecting social class and
ideology, and [failing to analyze or criticize the politics of cultural
texts will make cultural studies merely another academic
subdivision]{.underline}, **[harmless and ultimately of benefit
primarily to the culture industries themselves]{.underline}**. [Avoiding
such a conservative development]{.underline} of cultural studies, I
submit, [requires a multiperspectival approach that pays attention to
the production of culture, to the texts themselves, and to their
reception by the audience. This requires a variety of disciplinary and
critical perspectives **linking cultural studies**, ultimately, to
critical social theory and **radical democratic
politics**]{.underline}.(41-2)

Political identities aren't exactly falling off the tree, either. [The
problem with the liberal default]{.underline} [is]{.underline} that it
[its]{.underline}elf is [built on a kind of studied and indifferent
cosmopolitanism t]{.underline}hat disdains traditional meaning.
[That]{.underline} in turn [is why liberals are so often associated with
consumptive choices --- the Prius, the latte, the quinoa]{.underline}.
[To the degree that conventional liberalism offers an identity choice at
all, it is loud wokeness]{.underline}. I acknowledge that some people
reject expressive wokeness because they actually reject the underlying
opposition to various bigotries, and fuck those people, right. But there
are other issues; the most committed egalitarian, these days, is likely
to express exhaustion with public displays of wokeness, at least in
private. [The Great Pandering has come upon us,]{.underline} and so that
**[identity has become marketable and thus a magnet for some of the most
cynical opportunists]{.underline}** in the world. The world does not
need more Jamie Kilsteins. Besides, [central to the woke identity is the
forceful rejection of persuasion --- "it's not my job to educate
you,"]{.underline} etc. **[The problem with making your political
program the assembly of a moral aristocracy is that hierarchy always
requires exclusivity]{.underline}**. **[A fundamental, structural
impediment to liberal political victory is that their preferred kind of
moral engagement necessarily limits the number of adherents they can
win]{.underline}**. [It's just math: you can't grow a mass party when
the daily operation of your movement involves finding more and more
heretics to ostracize from the community]{.underline}. [It's not that I
think there's throngs of people who would be waxing intersectionally
about the theme of decolonization in Kendrick Lamar's Damn if only they
hadn't gone Pepe. But in a very real sense political progress is always
and only about pulling the edge cases into a particular orbit and hoping
that in time they will come to circle closer and closer to your
goals]{.underline}.

### AT: Traditional Politics Fail 

#### Resistance divorced from politics fails- they fetishize a mode of powerlessness that occludes important questions about systems of power

to]{.underline} the [widening]{.underline} of [our definition

me that [because they are]{.underline} ultimately [more concerned with
**finding resistors** and explaining resistance than with examining
power]{.underline}, [they do not explore]{.underline} as fully as they
might [the **implications of the forms of resistance they
locate**]{.underline}. In some of my own earlier work, as in that of
others, [there is]{.underline} perhaps **[a tendency to romanticize
resistance]{.underline}**, [to read all forms of resistance as signs of
the **ineffectiveness of systems of power** and of the resilience and
creativity of the human spirit in its refusal to be
dominated]{.underline}.5 [By reading resistance in this way, we
**collapse distinctions between forms of resistance** and **foreclose

#### Politics isn't magic, its complicated -- we need to be ready when the moment arises 

**Maisano, Editor, 17**

(Chris,
<https://www.jacobinmag.com/2017/11/hegemony-how-to-gramsci-organizing>,
11-28)

What Marx called [the "silent compulsion of economic relations" performs
a disciplinary function]{.underline} somewhere [between the poles of
coercion and consent that define Gramsci's theory of
hegemony]{.underline}. [This "habituation]{.underline}," as Harry
Braverman calls it in his classic book, Labor and Monopoly Capital, [is
always conditional and may suddenly come undone when circumstances
favorable to collective action present themselves. Smucker is compelled
to acknowledge this]{.underline} reality at various points in the book.
"[When the landscape dramatically shifts]{.underline} and people can
intuit potential political openings," he writes, "[the thick fog of
popular resignation can evaporate in an instant]{.underline}" [as
previously immobilized people flood into organizations and
movements]{.underline}. [This is **precisely** how such upheavals have
tended to happen historically,]{.underline} [which explains the
**episodic and discontinuous** timing of mass movements.]{.underline} My
own organization, Democratic Socialists of America ([DSA), has
experienced something like this dynamic over the last year. For years,
our membership remained stagnant at a few thousand.]{.underline} Of that
number, only a very small percentage was actively engaged in building
the organization on an ongoing basis. [In the last year, DSA has grown
dramatically, but not because we finally hit on the right
narrative]{.underline} or figured out the secret recipe for successful
organizing. [DSA was in a good position to grow]{.underline} partly
[because our leaders made sound political judgments]{.underline} --- our
strong support for the Bernie Sanders campaign above all else. But it
was ultimately the force of events that brought so many new people into
the organization. [Smucker consistently downplays the need to build
independent political organizations with their own perspectives and
cultures. But the explosive growth of DSA]{.underline} (and the broader
socialist left) in the last year [shows just how important it is to do
so --- especially during periods of popular **quiescence and
inactivity.** While organizers can't bring a mass movement into
existence on their own, organized groups of radicals have played a key
role in **guiding and supporting these upsurges whenever they've
occurred**.]{.underline} [Their importance]{.underline}, as Robert
Brenner puts it, [lies in the ways they have "helped provide continuity
between temporally disconnected struggles, offered historically grounded
analyses of the current moment, and, above all, **suggested strategies
for action."**]{.underline} Whether we make good on the opportunities in
front of us is an open question[. Four decades of defeat and
marginalization means that a new generation of socialists is now joining
a Left in serious need of inspiration and guidance. **We would be well
served to mine our own tradition's rich vein of history, theory, and
practice, including that of Gramsci himself. The alternative is a
politics without politics, the substitution of technique for
strategy.**]{.underline}

### 1NC -- Mass Incarceration 

#### Combatting the prison-incarceration system must utilize policy platforms -- foregoing them [cedes decisionmaking to right-wing hardliners]{.underline} -- current movements include [the Movement for Black Lives, the 2018 national prison strikes, and the Green New Deal]{.underline} 

**Berger,** PhD, **02-2-19** (Dan, Truthout, School of Interdisciplinary
Arts and Sciences, Founder & CEO at Social Tables, "Prison Reform" Is
Not Enough. In 2019, Let's Fight for De-carceration"
<https://truthout.org/articles/prison-reform-is-not-enough-in-2019-lets-fight-for-decarceration/)//EF>

[Radical critics of the prison system, including abolitionists and
grassroots organizers in and out of prison, have a difficult---but
familiar---task in 2019.]{.underline} It involves at least three
simultaneous efforts. [First, we need to advance our own policy
platforms that can supplant the narrowness of the current prison reform
agenda with an emphasis on mass decarceration]{.underline}, community
reinvestment, full civil and human rights for currently and formerly
incarcerated people, and non-punitive approaches to harm. Doing so means
growing across movements as well as bringing new people into the fold.
[Second, we need to expose and exploit the fault lines within the
extreme center in the hopes of channeling sincere efforts into
transformative change and undermining the cynical and **failed policies
of right-wing prison reform. That requires monitoring and challenging
the contemporary reform agenda. Finally, we need to both push for a seat
at the table---especially for currently and formerly incarcerated
people---while changing the table itself. Now is the time to hold
people's feet to the fire, not genuflect at the halls of
power.**]{.underline} It is all easier said than done, of course, but
[it is also already in process]{.underline}. [**The Movement for Black
Lives** platform]{.underline} (as well as a recent robust critique of
the First Step Act) [and the demands from the 2018 national prison
strike are both excellent models]{.underline} of crafting the kind of
policy platforms we need. [So too is the push for a **Green New
Deal**]{.underline}, which remains the most promising example of federal
criminal legal reform, even though it does not (yet) make any mention of
criminal legal issues[. The full employment and just transition vision
of the Green New Deal offer far more promising avenues to reduce the
country's reliance on policing and incarceration than much of what
transpires under the mantle of prison reform.]{.underline} Local, rural
jail expansion threatens to grow the number of people incarcerated while
many people fawn over the passage of a tepid federal reform package. The
federal government is likely to remain a lost cause for the foreseeable
future[. There's little chance of enacting progressive legislation
regarding criminalization in a sphere governed by people so fully
committed to the carceral state]{.underline}. More to the point, the
most significant action remains at the state and local level, where
almost 90 percent of those incarcerated are held, and where people are
most likely to encounter police or other agents of the carceral state.
That is why local, rural jail expansion---often funded by the federal
government---threatens to grow the number of people incarcerated while
many people fawn over the passage of a tepid federal reform package.
**[As always, the path toward decarceration, reinvestment and
transformation requires fighting on multiple fronts simultaneously:
pushing back against the hardliners, pushing beyond what the extreme
center will allow and pushing for the changes we really need. While this
stance may seem familiar, it will require greater urgency and clarity as
"prison reform" occupies center stage.]{.underline}**

#### We must engage in an unflinching [dissection of the racial biases]{.underline} integrated within the American incarceration system -- these institutions [perpetuate a litany of domestic]{.underline} harms-- [surveillance, violent crackdowns]{.underline}, and [disproportionate prosecution of black communities]{.underline}

[High rates of incarceration in the contemporary United States are also
unique in comparison to incarceration rates in other
countries.]{.underline} **[Even after recent declines in the total
number of people held in prisons and jails, the United States continues
to incarcerate a much higher fraction of its population than any other
wealthy nation in the world]{.underline}**. People living in the United
States are more than 10 times as likely to be in prison or jail as
people living in Denmark, Sweden, or the Netherlands and four times as
likely compared to residents of the United Kingdom (Aebi, Mélanie, and
Burkhardt 2016; Coyle et al. 2016; Hartney 2006; Kaeble and Cowhig
2018). Mass incarceration, or the widespread incapacitation of people in
prisons and jails, does not randomly or equally affect all subgroups in
the population. [Rather, mass incarceration is characterized by its
systematic targeting of particular segments of the population
(]{.underline}Garland 2001). Indeed, like other forms of criminal
justice contact, [incarceration is disproportionately concentrated among
men, African Americans, and those with low levels of formal
schooling]{.underline}. No other group suffers the overwhelming
likelihood of imprisonment experienced by young black males in the
United States who do not complete high school (Pettit and Western 2004;
Western and Wildeman 2009; Pettit 2012; Travis et al. 2014: ch. 2).
Despite the concentrated incarceration of young black men, the effects
of mass incarceration extend well beyond the individuals living behind
bars. [**Mass incarceration has generated not only direct implications
for inequality through the systematic removal of young black men from
free society but also indirect consequences for inequality as a result
of its impacts on children, families, and communities that
simultaneously suffer**. Mass incarceration, and other forms of criminal
justice contact, from police stops to community‐based supervision,
generate consequences related to employment, wages, political
engagement, health, neighborhood stability, and a host of other
considerations]{.underline} (Clear 2007; Kling 2006; Lee, Porter, and
Comfort 2014; Massoglia, Firebaugh, and Warner 2013; Massoglia and
Pridemore 2015; Pager 2003, Pager 2007; Sampson and Loeffler 2010;
Schnittker and John 2007; Uggen and Manza 2002; Weaver and Lerman 2010;
Western 2002, 2006 ; Western and Pettit 2000). In this article, we
discuss research on the consequences of incarceration and the other ways
the criminal justice system disrupts people's lives and how exposure to
the system and its effects collectively impact social equality. Trends
in Exposure to Mass Incarceration and Criminal Justice Contact [After
steadily rising for nearly 40 years, the number of people incarcerated
in the United States has hovered close to 2.2 million throughout the
last decade]{.underline} (Kaeble and Cowhig 2018). [Other forms of
criminal justice supervision such as probation and parole have also
grown to the extent that an additional 4.7 million people are under the
surveillance of probation or parole agencies]{.underline} (Kaeble 2018).
Far more commonly than either incarceration or community supervision,
however, people encounter the criminal justice system for misdemeanor,
or other relatively minor, infractions. Estimates suggest that nearly 20
million people have a felony conviction (Shannon et al. 2012). Around 70
million Americans, or slightly more than one‐third of adults, have a
criminal record (Sentencing Project 2014a). Nearly 25 million people are
pulled over each year for routine traffic stops that can carry criminal
sanctions, like fines and fees, which may widen the net of criminal
justice involvement (Langton and Matthew 2013[). A growing body of
research considers how misdemeanor offenses, or other relatively minor
infractions against the law, shape the way people interact with the
police and the judicial system even in the absence of spending time in
prison or jail]{.underline} (Comfort 2016; Kohler‐Hausmann 2013, 2018;
Lageson 2016; Napatoff 2015; Uggen et al. 2014). **[Excessive and
unnecessary traffic stops uniquely concentrated among African Americans
can fuel racial inequality in experiences with a maze of criminal
justice procedures and their consequences (]{.underline}**Baumgartener
et al. 2018). Simple counts of the number of people incarcerated, under
criminal justice supervision, arrested, or stopped by the police do not
fully reveal the extent to which different forms of contact with the
criminal justice system are stratified by gender, race, ethnicity, or
education and thus represent a critical axis of inequality. Table 1
presents estimates of adult men's exposure to the criminal justice
system by race and ethnicity. Consistent with accounts that emphasize
racial differences in surveillance, policing, prosecution, and
sentencing, racial disproportionality in exposure to the criminal
justice system varies in relation to types of contact.

#### Crafting effective [disease policy]{.underline} must include [a deconstruction of the mass incarceration system]{.underline} 

Hamblin, MD, 16 (James, "Mass Incarceration Is Making Infectious
Diseases Worse,"
<https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2016/07/incarceration-and-infection/491321/)//EF>

In the medical journal The Lancet this week, [researchers at Johns
Hopkins cite this as one factor in the spread of infectious diseases in
prisons. The researchers argue that this spread amounts to a
human-rights abuse and a violation of international law---a cruel and
inhuman failure to ensure humane prison conditions]{.underline}. **[The
penal system remains a source of diseases that spread among prisoners at
rates far exceeding those in the communities from which they
came]{.underline}**. Of more than 10 million incarcerated people in the
U.S. alone, 4 percent have HIV, 15 percent have hepatitis C, and 3
percent have active tuberculosis. [These diseases are]{.underline} part
of our criminal justice system, then, **[metered out and sanctioned
implicitly by the state]{.underline}**. The penal system is also a
primary reason that these diseases can't be eliminated globally, and the
problem goes well beyond condoms, [according to Chris Beyrer, the
Desmond Tutu Professor of Public Health and Human Rights at
Hopkins]{.underline}, who edited the Lancet research series. He spoke
with me by phone from South Africa, where he is co-chairing the
International AIDS Conference in Durban. He sounded distraught over the
fact that HIV infections stopped declining years ago in the United
States, and are now stable around 45,000 every year. In his findings,
[the spread of disease within prisons is a small factor compared to the
effects of releasing inmates into the community with no access to
treatment. Even]{.underline} in prison systems where people have
antiviral medications, the primary problem is really the lack of care
once they go back into the community. When a person with HIV, for
example, has an interruption in their treatment regimen, the virus comes
roaring back. Those people are infectious again, and often highly so.
That creates a serious risk for their sexual partners, and anyone with
whom they may share needles. The scale of the problem is due to the fact
that so many people are incarcerated in the first place, which Beyrer
traces to the war on drugs. "It's abundantly clear that incarceration is
a failure in terms of reducing substance abuse, but it also has these
consequences for HIV, hepatitis, and TB," he said. "We\'ve been
promoting this language around an 'AIDS-free generation,' but, in fact,
failing ourselves." [A practical approach to all of this is a new idea,
but one that is supposed to be guaranteed by a recent international
agreement. In 1955, the UN adopted a set of guidelines for the rights of
prisoners, known as the Standard Minimum Rules for the Treatment of
Prisoners.]{.underline} While they represented a major advance at the
time, they were still minimal, lacking an understanding of how
infections spread, and of substance abuse, and mental illness among
prisoners, among myriad other roads that lead to prison and out of it.
It took 60 years for the world to espouse more comprehensive standards,
but the General Assembly finally agreed on an update to the rules in
December of 2015. Now known as the Mandela Rules---for the man who was
effectively given tuberculosis as part of his sentence---they start from
the basic premise that prisons must protect human rights and dignity.
People need adequate food, sanitation, ventilation, and to be protected
from violence. [Basic as that may sound, former UN Special Rapporteur on
Torture Nigel Rodley called this a "real deontological reorientation of
the philosophy of penal institutional management"---a move toward
understanding prisons as places of preparation for reintegration into
society]{.underline}. With that came a focus on health, which may be the
most striking advance in the rules: They guarantee a full range of
diagnostic, prevention, and treatment services, including mental health
and drug-dependency treatment. They say that prisoners "should enjoy the
same standards of health care that are available in the community, and
should have access to necessary health-care services" and be organized
in a way that ensures continuity of treatment and care after release.
And this is yet, in many places, not happening. Cutting off basic
treatments as soon as a person walks out of their cell is a failure to
protect the public health and, really, a failure to provide care at
all---a violation of the Mandela Rules. [And it perpetuates inequality
in individual communities. As black men are disproportionately
incarcerated, **infectious disease spreads disproportionally in black
communities**]{.underline}. [Among transgender women of color in the
U.S., the rate of HIV infection is 27 percent, inextricably linked to
the incarceration rate, and some 35 percent of transgender prisoners in
the U.S. report sexual victimization while incarcerated]{.underline}.
"The unfortunate reality is that when heroin and other injected drug use
was largely confined to minority, inner city populations, all the
approaches were about law, zero tolerance, mandatory minimum
sentencing," said Beyrer. "Now that heroin is a problem of rural and
suburban white communities, suddenly we\'re talking about compassion and
managing overdose and drug treatment, and less about policing." For
decades, many Republicans insisted, for example, on maintaining the
federal ban on needle and syringe exchange---despite clear evidence that
needle and syringe exchange is a safe, cheap, and effective way to
prevent HIV and hepatitis. That decision was reversed in December by
none other than Mitch McConnell, in the wake of HIV and hepatitis
outbreaks in Indiana and Kentucky. **[So an approach to infectious
diseases must involve reform in criminal law, toward justice systems
that do not treat substance abuse with imprisonment]{.underline}**.
**[For people who do make it to prison, care of infectious diseases is
not care if it does not continue upon leaving. These policies will come
from an emphasis on the penal system as a tool of rehabilitation, and an
institution where human rights demand protection.]{.underline}**

### 1NC -- Russiagate 

#### Political energy is key to end Russiagate-it's the only way to resolve its bureaucratic preservation by forcing accountability

**Smith,** 3-8-20**18**

(Lee, Tabletmag, "WHO BELIEVES IN RUSSIAGATE?"
<https://www.tabletmag.com/jewish-news-and-politics/256899/left-right-russiagate>,
LASA-IZP)

Half the country hates Donald Trump, and even the half that thinks he's
doing a good job often flinch from his boorishness, his nasty public
attacks, sometimes even on his own aides. For all the top talent he says
he's surrounded himself with, the president repeatedly attracts among
the worst that Washington---and New York---have to offer. No doubt
that's one reason why whatever is thrown at him seems to stick. At the
same time, [there is a growing consensus among reporters and thinkers on
the left and right---especially those who know anything about Russia,
the surveillance apparatus, and intelligence bureaucracy---that the
Russiagate-collusion theory that was supposed to end Trump's presidency
within six months has sprung more than a few holes]{.underline}. Worse,
[it has proved to be a cover for U.S. intelligence and law-enforcement
bureaucracies to break the law, with what's left of the press gleefully
going along for the ride.]{.underline} [Where Watergate was a story
about a crime that came to define an entire generation's oppositional
attitude toward politicians and the country's elite, Russiagate, they
argue, has proved itself to be the reverse: It is a device that the
American elite is using to define itself against its enemies---the rest
of the country.]{.underline} Yet for its advocates, the questionable
veracity of [the Russiagate story seems much less important than what
has become its real purpose---elite virtue-signaling.]{.underline} [Buy
into a storyline that turns FBI and CIA bureaucrats and their
hand-puppets in the press into heroes while legitimizing the use of a
vast surveillance apparatus for partisan purposes, and you're in.
Dissent, and you're out, or worse---you're defending Trump]{.underline}.
Recently, a writer on The New Yorker blog named Adrian Chen gave voice
to the central dilemma facing young media professionals who struggle to
balance their need for social approval with the demands of fact-based
analysis in the age of Trump. In an article pegged to special counsel
Robert Mueller's indictments of the Internet Research Agency, Chen
referenced an article he had written about the IRA for The New York
Times Magazine several years ago. After the Mueller indictments were
announced, Chen was called on to lend his expertise regarding Russian
troll farms and their effect on the American public sphere---an offer he
recognized immediately as a can't-win proposition. "Either I could stay
silent," wrote Chen, "and allow the conversation to be dominated by
those pumping up the Russian threat, or I could risk giving fodder to
Trump and his allies." In other words, [there's the truth, and then
there's what's even more important---sticking it to Trump. Choose wrong,
even inadvertently, Chen explained, no matter how many times you deplore
Trump, and you'll be labeled a Trumpkin]{.underline}. That's what
happened to Facebook advertising executive Rob Goldman, who was obliged
to apologize to his entire company in an internal message for having
shared with the Twitter public the fact that "the majority of the
Internet Research Agency's Facebook ads were purchased after the
election." After Trump retweeted Goldman's thread to reaffirm that
Vladimir Putin had nothing to do with his electoral victory, the
Facebook VP was lucky to still have a job. Chen's article serves to
explain why Russiagate is so vital to The New Yorker, despite the many
headaches that each new weekly iteration of the story must be causing
for the magazine's fact-checkers. According to British court documents,
The New Yorker was one of the publications that former British
intelligence officer Christopher Steele briefed in September 2016 on the
findings in his now-notorious dossier. In a New Yorker profile of Steele
this week---portraying the spy-for-corporate-hire as a patriotic hero
and laundering his possible criminal activities---Jane Mayer explains
that she was personally briefed by Steele during that time period. The
New Yorker has produced tons of Russiagate stories, including a small
anthology of takes on the Mueller indictments alone. Of course there's
one by the recently-hired Adam Entous, the former Washington Post and
Wall Street Journal reporter who broke the news that the Washington firm
Fusion GPS, which produced the Steele dossier, had been hired by the
Clinton campaign and the Democratic National Committee---a story that
helped Fusion GPS relieve some of the pressure congressional inquiries
had put on the firm to release its bank records. No doubt Entous will
continue to use his sources, whoever they are, to break more such
stories at The New Yorker. One person at The New Yorker who won't get on
board with the story is Masha Gessen. Born in Moscow, Gessen knows
first-hand how bad Putin is and dislikes Trump only a little less than
she dislikes the Russian strongman. Yet in a recent New Yorker piece,
Gessen mocked Mueller's indictments: "Trump's tweet about Moscow
laughing its ass off was unusually (perhaps accidentally) accurate," she
wrote[. "Loyal Putinites and dissident intellectuals alike are
remarkably united in finding the American obsession with Russian
meddling to be ridiculous."]{.underline} Another native Russian-speaking
reporter, Julia Ioffe, formerly with The New Republic and more recently,
The Atlantic, has some similar reservations. In a September 2016 article
for Politico, she threw cold water on the legend of Carter Page, master
spy and wheeler-dealer. As Ioffe reported, virtually no one in Moscow
had ever heard of Page. [From the beginning, Gessen saw **the collusion
story as dangerous**, not because she supported Trump but **because it
fed into a fantasy that convinced Trump's opponents that they need not
bother with the difficult and boring work of procedural
politics.**]{.underline} And [who were the would-be agents of America's
salvation? Spies]{.underline}---the former British spy allegedly
responsible for the dossier and countless American intelligence
officials using anonymous press leaks to manipulate the American public.
"The backbone of the rapidly yet endlessly developing Trump-Putin
story," Gessen wrote in The New York Review of Books nearly a year ago,
"is leaks from intelligence agencies, and this is its most troublesome
aspect." [The specter of an intelligence bureaucracy working in tandem
with the press to preserve the prerogatives of a ruling clique is the
kind of thing that someone who knows Russia from the inside and actually
fears the specter of authoritarian government would naturally find
worrying]{.underline}. And [not surprisingly, concerns over the role of
the intelligence community and its increasingly intrusive methods
motivate other Russiagate critics on the left,]{.underline} like Glenn
Greenwald at the Intercept, historian Jackson Lears writing at the
London Review of Books, and Stephen Cohen at The Nation. "**[One of the
most bizarre aspects of Russiagate]{.underline}**," writes Lears, "**[is
the magical transformation of intelligence agency heads into paragons of
truth-telling---a trick performed]{.underline}** not by reactionary
apologists for domestic spying, as one would expect, but **[by people
who consider themselves liberals."]{.underline}** Cohen, a distinguished
if often overly sympathetic historian of the Soviet Union, was even more
alarmed. "[Was Russiagate produced by the primary leaders of the US
intelligence community]{.underline}?" asks Cohen, referring to former
CIA director John Brennan as well as ex-FBI chief James Comey. "[If so,
it is the most perilous political scandal in modern American history and
the most detrimental to American democracy."]{.underline} Yes, the left
hates Trump. I didn't vote for him, either. But what Gessen, Greenwald,
Lears, and Cohen all understand is that [Russiagate isn't about Trump.
He's just a convenient proxy for the real target]{.underline}. Their
understanding is shared by writers on the right, like Andrew McCarthy, a
former lawyer at the Department of Justice, who has unfolded the
Russiagate affair over the last year in the pages of National Review,
where he has carefully explained how [the DOJ and FBI misled the Foreign
Intelligence Surveillance Court in order to spy on Carter Page and
violate the privacy of an American citizen.]{.underline} [What unites
Gessen, Greenwald, Lears, and McCarthy obviously isn't
politics---rather, it's the recognition that the Russiagate campaign
represents an attack on American political and social
institutions]{.underline}, an attack on our liberties, an attack on us.
[Russiagate is a conspiracy theory, weaponized by political operatives,
much of the press, as well as high-level intelligence and law
enforcement bureaucrats to delegitimize an American election and protect
their own interests, which coincide with those of the country's larger
professional and bureaucratic elite.]{.underline} \*\*\* [The story of
how the Russiagate collusion myth was made and marketed is much easier
to understand---it's social. Imagine a map of professional, academic,
and family networks that connect people across professions like law,
journalism, public relations, and lobbying, which intersect with
political institutions, like the permanent bureaucracies that staff
places like the FBI, CIA, Congress, and the White House.]{.underline}
That map is largely blue, but there's lots of red there, too. The story
of how spies and journalists came to collaborate on a disinformation
campaign is also, as the left may not be surprised to find, partly
explained by economics. With the rise of the internet and social media,
and the resulting collapse of print advertising, it was no longer
necessary for the media to mass so close to New York City ad firms.
Surviving old-media outlets and their new-media cousins moved much of
their operations to Washington, which offered one-stop shopping for
"national" stories. Having insulated itself from the 2008 economic
collapse, the capital thrived. Ambitious and inexperienced young
journalists flocked to where the jobs were, staffing startup news and
social media operations---which were often simply partisan war rooms
that produced and solicited opposition research---just in time to cover
Obama's historic presidency. For those like Gessen, Cohen, Lears, and
others on the left who don't understand how and when American
journalists got in bed with the country's spies, it started several
years before Trump or Russiagate. [It was while reporting on the Obama
administration that the press came to rely on the White House's
political operatives, including intelligence officials, for sources and
stories about American foreign policy]{.underline}. [It got worse when
the Obama administration started spying on its domestic opponents during
the Iran deal, when the Obama administration learned how far it could go
in manipulating the foreign-intelligence surveillance apparatus for
domestic political advantage.]{.underline} As Adam Entous, then of The
Wall Street Journal, wrote in a December 2015 article, "the National
Security Agency's targeting of Israeli leaders and officials also swept
up the contents of some of their private conversations with U.S.
lawmakers and American-Jewish groups." [Obama administration officials
had leaked the story to Entous in order to shape its reception. After
all, the real news was pretty bad---Obama had spied on Americans and the
Americans he spied on, Congress and Jewish community leaders, knew
it.]{.underline} But [in Entous' account, it was only by accident that
the National Security Agency had listened in on Americans opposed to the
Iran deal, opponents whose communications had simply been "swept
up."]{.underline} While [Entous' evident lack of skepticism]{.underline}
about that account was hardly good reporting, it [was perfectly in
keeping with the maxim of not biting the hand that feeds
you]{.underline}. What the White House really wanted to know, on Entous'
telling, was what the Israeli prime minister and his ambassador to
Washington were doing to contest the Iran deal. Except, neither Benjamin
Netanyahu nor Israeli Ambassador Ron Dermer makes U.S. policy: Congress
does. As I explained in an April Tablet article, [the purpose of the
spying campaign was to help the White House fight U.S. legislators and
other Americans critical of the deal---i.e., to win a domestic political
battle]{.underline}. A pro-Israel political operative who was deeply
involved in the Iran deal fight told me last year, "[The NSA's
collections of foreigners became a means of gathering real-time
intelligence on Americans." With the Iran deal, as would later happen
with Russiagate, the ostensible targets of intelligence
collection---Israel, then Russia---were simply instruments that the
Obama administration used to go after the real bad guys, namely its
enemies at home]{.underline}. [The same process of weaponizing
foreign-intelligence collection for domestic political purposes that the
Obama administration road-tested during the Iran-deal fight was used to
manufacture Russiagate and get it to market.]{.underline} Except instead
of keeping a close hold of the identities of those swept up during
"incidental collection" of U.S. persons, departing Obama White House
officials leaked the names to friendly reporters. Leaking classified
intelligence is a felony, which means that Obama officials, many in the
intelligence community, who leaked the names of Americans whose
communications were intercepted to the press, were breaking the law. A
crucial concern, then, was the trustworthiness of the intermediaries
chosen to publish classified intelligence. It is to those intermediaries
that anyone seeking to understand how the press became an instrument of
the U.S. intelligence bureaucracy's information war must now turn.
Entous, now The New Yorker's man in Washington, had already proved his
trustworthiness by shaping the story about Obama administration spying
on congressional and American Jewish-community leaders in a way that was
favorable to the administration, and disguised blatant abuses of power.
More stories would now come his way, courtesy of the U.S. intelligence
community. One of Entous' most famous Russia-related scoops was a Dec.
31, 2016, Washington Post article reporting that "according to US
officials," Russians hackers had penetrated the computer system of a
Vermont dam. As it turns out, the story was entirely wrong. A statement
from Burlington Electric released shortly after the Post's story
explained that a laptop unconnected to the company's grid was affected
by malware. There was no threat to the dam, never mind "the nation's
electrical grid," as the anonymous U.S. officials quoted in the Entous
story had claimed. In other words, there was no story---which Entous or
his co-writer would have discovered had they contacted the electricity
company. They didn't, because the story was not sourced to original
reporting---i.e. discovering from sources on location in Vermont that
the state's electrical grid had in fact been compromised. In support of
reporting like that, the journalists might well have sought supporting
information or quotes from government officials, named or even
anonymous. Instead, their story started with anonymous U.S. officials,
who leaked to Entous and his colleague for the evident purpose of
advancing the Russiagate narrative. Russia was everywhere---from a dam
in Vermont to 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue. If Entous' story about the Obama
administration's spying on Congress and U.S. Jewish leaders showed that
the reporter was trustworthy, the Vermont-dam article showed he wasn't
going to ask many questions of the officials who pointed him toward a
nonexistent story, whose purpose appeared to have less to do with the
health of the state of Vermont than with fear-mongering about Russia.
Clearly, someone noticed. In the March 1, 2017, Washington Post, Entous
was lead byline on an article breaking the news that Attorney General
Jeff Sessions met twice with Russian Ambassador Sergey Kislyak. A July
21, 2017, Post story on which Entous had the lead byline alleged that
Sessions had discussed campaign-related matters with Kislyak. The latter
story provides evidence of how the March and July articles were
produced---U.S. officials leaked classified intelligence regarding
intercepts of Kislyak's communications with Moscow, in which he
discussed Sessions. Officials then unmasked the identity of the attorney
general and leaked it to Entous and the other reporters on the story.
Following close on the heels of those two pass-through DC-based
"scoops," Entous was lead byline on an April 3, 2017, story reporting a
meeting in the Seychelles between Blackwater founder Erik Prince and a
Russian banker, reportedly to set up a back channel between Trump and
Putin. After publication of the story, Prince said he was shown
"specific evidence" by sources from the intelligence community that his
name was unmasked and given to the paper. "Unless The Washington Post
has somehow miraculously recruited the bartender of a hotel in the
Seychelles," Prince told the House Intelligence Committee in December,
"the only way that's happening is through SIGINT \[signals
intelligence\]." Recent news reports suggest that Prince's meeting has
become a key focus of the Mueller investigation. If those reports are
accurate, it seems even more likely that classified intelligence was
purposefully being leaked to put pressure on Prince. A week later, on
April 11, 2017, Entous is bylined on yet another story based on a leak
of classified intelligence that once again violated the privacy rights
of an American citizen when the Post broke the news that the FBI secured
a Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act warrant on Carter Page. If you
think Russiagate is real, then you will probably conclude that Sessions,
Prince, and Page are all part of a single, monstrous criminal
conspiracy---and that Adam Entous is one of the most important
journalists in American history, an indefatigable shoe-leather reporter
who helped whistleblowers inside the federal government put the truth
before the American public, like Bob Woodward, Carl Bernstein, and Neil
Sheehan combined. If you think the collusion story is nonsense, then
Entous is just a political operative with a convenient byline. And [if
you think Russiagate is a campaign of political warfare waged in the
shadows by bureaucrats who violated the privacy of American citizens in
order to undo election results they disagreed with, then Entous is
something worse---an asset whom sectors of the intelligence community
have come to rely on in order to manipulate the public.]{.underline}

#### Russiagate turns the aff-association between radical movements and Russian propaganda breeds public opposition to the aff and forces the left into a spectator role which empowers the very structures they critique and ensures continuation of Russiagate

What democracy? [[Russiagate]{.mark} has]{.underline} even
[[painted]{.mark} entire [opposition]{.mark} [movements in the US as
Russian agents]{.mark} or dupes]{.underline}. [[When]{.mark}
[Facebook]{.mark} [turned]{.mark} [over]{.mark} '[Russian-bought
ads']{.mark}]{.underline} (which, by the way, have never been linked to
Putin or a pro-Putin force), [[they found ads for]{.mark} [B]{.mark}lack
[L]{.mark}ives [M]{.mark}atter [events]{.mark}]{.underline}. Now,
\$150,000 of Facebook ads can't exactly swing an election, but that
didn't stop the speculation. Valle (2017) correctly argued that [this
[speculation]{.mark} only [serves to discredit activist
organizations]{.mark}. [They]{.mark} also [smeared the legacy of the
Black liberation movement]{.mark} in the US [by painting]{.mark} [Black
communist organizers]{.mark} in the early twentieth century [as]{.mark}
nothing but [Soviet spies]{.mark}]{.underline}. In her takedown of this
anti-Black Russiagate campaign, Lindsay (2017) notes: [[These
assertions]{.mark} [deny]{.mark} the [agency of African
Americans]{.mark}, many of whom were amongst the most prominent Black
intellectuals of their time, [who looked to the Soviet system]{.mark}
[as an alternative]{.mark} to American racism and exploitation. [This
interpretation]{.mark} also [denies]{.mark} [the]{.mark} real
[solidarity]{.mark} [and support]{.mark} that [the Soviet Union
expressed in]{.mark} their [assistance to]{.mark} [liberation movements
of]{.mark} many Black, brown and [oppressed people]{.mark} all over the
world.]{.underline} Lindsay goes on to relay the facts about the
tremendous cooperation between the Soviet Union and the heroics of the
Black liberation struggle (see Kelley, 1990, for starters). [The
narrative of Russiagate is that the US is a democracy]{.underline}, a
free society that is [threatened by Russia and the evil
Putin]{.underline}. [But,]{.underline} as Lindsay argues powerfully in
the opening to her article, '[Black Bolsheviks, White Lies:' A lot of
nonsense has been written about the role of Putin's Russia in subverting
"our democracy]{.underline}." [As though our democracy had been
functioning perfectly]{.underline} (even reasonably) well, [until these
shadowy Russian forces purchased a few Facebook ads that sent us all
into the streets]{.underline}. It's a laughable concept. I'm sorry, did
Putin acquit George Zimmerman or Jason Stockley? Did Putin shoot
12-year-old Tamir Rice? Russia did not carry out the drug war against
African Americans or implement policies of mass incarceration, or pass
voter ID laws in the U.S.---all of which have contributed to
disenfranchising millions of African Americans over the years[. [The
U.S. has a lot to answer for with regard to systematically
denying]{.underline}]{.mark} [the democratic [rights]{.mark} of African
Americans [and this is not the first time they've tried]{.mark} [to
deflect criticism]{.mark} for that [by blaming
Russia]{.mark}]{.underline}. Can one interfere in a democracy if such a
democracy doesn't exist? Can one have sovereignty on stolen land? And
what counts as interference? Was it interference when US election
consultants helped an unpop- ular Boris Yeltsin get re-elected in 1996?
After his election, TIME magazine ran a cover which read 'Yanks to the
Rescue: The Secret Story of how American Advisers Helped Yeltsin Win'
(Gardner, 2017). Was it interference when, right before the Brexit vote,
then-US President Barack Obama held a press confer- ence saying that, if
Brexit passes, Britain would 'move to the back of the queue' for US
trade agreements (Palmer, 2016)? Was it interference when the US invaded
Panama and kidnapped its president, Manuel Noriega? Was it interference
when the US trained and armed sectarian rebels in Syria? Or when they
bombed Libya to overthrow Gadda ? This should be the role of critical
education in the present moment (and it's really no different from the
previous moments): critique everything. Critique Trump, but also
critique Russiagate and its pro- ponents; critique RT but also critique
The New York Times; critique Russia but also critique the US, and do so
with some perspective (e.g. what is Russia's military budget compared to
the US's? How many Russian military bases surround the US, and how many
US bases surround Russia?). And what exactly is the Russian Federation?
What is Putin's relationship to it? Does he single-handedly control
every institution there? Or is there also mass opposition to him from
within and without the halls of power? [Opponents of Putin in Russia, by
the way, have said that [Russiagate makes Putin look much]{.mark} [more
powerful]{.mark} than he actually is, [which hurts their chances at
defeating him]{.mark}]{.underline} (Higgins, 2017). And **[[don't just
critique]{.underline}]{.mark}**, of course, **[but
[organize]{.mark}]{.underline}**! The real resistance [Because Trump is
such an odious figure, many have been swept up in
Russiagate]{.underline}. I would suggest that [[one of the motivations
behind Russiagate is to move people out of the streets and into their
homes]{.mark}. [This is what]{.mark} the [Watergate]{.mark} scandal
[did]{.mark} [in the 1970s]{.mark}, according to leading anti-Trump
organizer Becker]{.underline} (2017): **[[Rather than leading a mass
movement]{.mark} [against]{.mark} Nixon and [the system]{.mark}, [the
progressive sector]{.mark} of society [was reduced to the status of
spectators watching]{.mark} the sanctimonious, [corrupt]{.mark}ed,
reactionary, [elite politicians]{.mark} of both parties [rant]{.mark}
and rave [about Nixon's wrongdoings]{.mark}]{.underline}**[. **[Liberals
could sit at home and cheer]{.underline}**]{.mark} **[on [as
pro-imperialist]{.mark} and racist [politicians]{.mark}
(]{.underline}**aka "elected officials") **[[united to topple]{.mark}
the hated [Nixon]{.mark}]{.underline}**. **[[The radical
left]{.underline}]{.mark}**, those who had been in the forefront of the
struggles for peace and justice, **[[completely lost]{.mark} the
[leadership of the]{.mark} anti-Nixon [movement]{.mark}]{.underline}**.
There is a resistance out there, but it's not located in Congress, let
alone in the CIA or the FBI (insti- tutions that were set up to destroy
resistance groups), and it's not led by the Democratic Party. The
Democratic Party is known on the left as the 'graveyard of social
movements.' It's where people's power goes to die. If critical education
is truly oriented toward critiquing the present and inventing a better
future--- which I maintain it is and must be---the our task is to
utilize our educational resources and knowledges to build the real
resistance, which is a resistance not to Trump the person, but to the
systems that he represents: imperialism, white supremacy and
anti-Blackness, sexism and misogyny, capitalism, heter- onormativity,
ableism, and settler-colonialism.

#### Continuation of Russiagate ruins democracy and triggers a cycle of political withdrawal

**Cohen**, Professor emeritus of Russian studies and politics at New
York University and Princeton University, 3-27-20**19**

(Stephen F., "The Real Costs of Russiagate"
<https://www.thenation.com/article/the-real-costs-of-russiagate/>
,LASA-IZP)

The very few of us who publicly challenged and deplored Russiagate
allegations against candidate and then President Donald Trump from the
time they first began to appear in mid-2016 should not gloat or rejoice
over the US attorney general's summary of Robert S. Mueller's key
finding: "The Special Counsel's investigation did not find that the
Trump campaign or anyone associated with it conspired or coordinated
with Russia in its efforts to influence the 2016 US presidential
election." (On the other hand, those of us repeatedly slurred as Trump
and/or Putin "apologists" might feel some vindication.) But what about
the legions of [high-ranking intelligence officials, politicians,
editorial writers, television producers, and other opinion-makers, and
their eager media outlets that perpetuated, inflated, and prolonged this
unprecedented political scandal in American
history]{.underline}---[those who did not stop short of accusing the
president of the United States of being a Kremlin "agent," "asset,"
"puppet," "Manchurian candidate," and who characterized his conduct and
policies as "treasonous"?]{.underline} (These and other examples are
cited in my book War with Russia? From Putin and Ukraine to Trump and
Russiagate, and in a recent piece by Paul Starobin in City Journal.)
[Will they now apologize, as decency requires, or, more importantly,
explain their motives so that we might understand and avoid another such
national trauma]{.underline}? Shortly after Mikhail Gorbachev became
leader of the Soviet Union, in 1985, he released a banned film,
Repentance, that explored the underlying institutional, ideological, and
personal dynamics of Stalinism. The film set off a nationwide media
trial and condemnation of that murderous era. [Though Russiagate has
generated in America some Soviet-like practices and ruined a number of
lives and reputations, it is, of course, nothing even remotely
comparable to the Soviet Stalinist experience]{.underline}. By
comparison, therefore, [some introspective repentance on the part of
Russiagate perpetuators should not be too much to ask]{.underline}. But
as I foresaw well before the summary of Mueller's "Russia investigation"
appeared, [there is unlikely to be much, if any. Too many personal and
organizational interests are too deeply invested in
Russiagate]{.underline}. Not surprisingly, [leading perpetrators instead
immediately met the summary with a torrent of denials, goal-post shifts,
obfuscations, and calls for more Russiagate
"investigations]{.underline}." Joy Reid of MSNBC, which has been a
citadel of Russiagate allegations along with CNN, even suggested that
Mueller and Attorney General William Barr were themselves engaged in "a
cover-up." Contrary to a number of major media outlets, from Bloomberg
News to The Wall Street Journal, nor does Mueller's exculpatory finding
actually mean that "Russiagate...is dead" and indeed that "it expired in
an instant." Such conclusions reveal a lack of historical and political
understanding. [Nearly three years of Russiagate's toxic allegations
have entered the American political-media elite bloodstream, and they
almost certainly will reappear again and again in one form or another.
**This is an exceedingly grave danger, because the real costs of
Russiagate are not the estimated \$25--40 million spent on the Mueller
investigation but the corrosive damage it has already done to the
institutions of American democracy---damage done not by an alleged
"Trump-Putin axis" but by Russsigate's perpetrators
themselves**]{.underline}. Having examined this collateral damage in my
recently published book War with Russia? From Putin and Ukraine to Trump
and Russiagate, I will only note them here. § [Clamorous allegations
that the Kremlin "attacked our elections" and thereby put Trump in the
White House, despite the lack of any evidence, cast doubt on the
legitimacy of American elections everywhere]{.underline}---national,
state, and local. [If true]{.underline}, or even suspected, [how can
voters have confidence in the electoral foundations of American
democracy]{.underline}? Persistent [demands to "secure our elections
from hostile powers"--- a politically and financially profitable
mania]{.underline}, it seems---can [only further abet and perpetuate
declining confidence in the entire electoral process]{.underline}. Still
more, [if some crude Russian social-media outputs could so dupe voters,
what does this tell us about what US elites, which originated these
allegations, really think of those voters,]{.underline} of the American
people? § [Defamatory Russiagate allegations that Trump was a "Kremlin
puppet" and thus "illegitimate" were aimed at the president but hit the
presidency itself, degrading the institution, bringing it under
suspicion, casting doubt on its legitimacy]{.underline}. And [if an
"agent of a hostile foreign power" could occupy the White House
once]{.underline}, a "Manchurian candidate," [why not again? Will
Republicans be able to resist making such allegations against a future
Democratic president]{.underline}? In any event, Hillary Clinton's
failed campaign manager, Robby Mook, has already told us that there will
be a "next time." [Mainstream media are, of course, a foundational
institution of American democracy, especially national ones, newspapers
and television, with immense influence]{.underline} inside the Beltway
and, in ramifying synergic ways, [throughout the country. Their
Russiagate media malpractice]{.underline}, as I have termed it, [may
have been the worst such episode in modern American history. No
mainstream media did anything to expose,]{.underline} for example, [two
crucial and fraudulent Russiagate documents]{.underline}---the so-called
Steele Dossier and the January 2017 Intelligence Community
Assessment---[but instead relied heavily on them for their own
narratives]{.underline}. Little more need be said here about this
institutional self-degradation. Glenn Greenwald and a few others
followed and exposed it throughout, and now Matt Taibbi has given us a
meticulously documented account of that systematic malpractice,
concluding that Mueller's failure to confirm [the media's Russiagate
allegations "is a death-blow for the reputation of the American news
media." Nor]{.underline}, it must be added, [was this entirely
inadvertent or accidental]{.underline}. On August 8, 2016, the
trend-setting New York Times published on its front page an astonishing
editorial manifesto by its media critic. Asking whether "normal
standards" should apply to candidate Trump, he explained that they
should not: "You have to throw out the textbook American journalism has
been using for the better part of the past half-century." Let others
decide whether this Times proclamation unleashed the highly selective,
unbalanced, questionably factual "journalism" that has so degraded
Russiagate media or instead the publication sought to justify what was
already underway. In either case, this remarkable---and
ramifying---Times rejection of its own professed standards should not be
forgotten. Almost equally remarkable and lamentable, we learn that even
now, after Mueller's finding is known, top executives of the Times and
other leading Russiagate media outlets, including The Washington Post
and CNN, "have no regrets." § For better or worse, [America has a
two-party political system, which means that the Democratic Party is
also a foundational institution. Little more also need be pointed out
regarding its self-degrading role in the Russiagate fraud. Leading
members of the party initiated, inflated, and prolonged it.]{.underline}
[They did nothing to prevent inquisitors like Representatives Adam
Schiff and Eric Swalwell from becoming the cable-news face of the party.
Or to rein in or disassociate the party from the outlandish excesses of
"The Resistance]{.underline}." [With very few exceptions, elected and
other leading Democrats did nothing to stop---and therefore further
abetted---the institutional damage being done by Russiagate
allegations]{.underline}. As for Mueller's finding,the party's virtual
network, MSNBC, remains undeterred. Rachel Maddow continues to hype "the
underlying reality that Russia did in fact attack us." By any reasonable
definition of "attack," no, it did not, and scarcely any allegation
could be more recklessly warmongering, [a perception the Democratic
Party will for this and other Russiagate commissions have to endure, or
not]{.underline}. (When Mueller's full report is published, we will see
if he too indulged in this dangerous absurdity. A few passages in the
summary suggest he might have done so.) § Finally, but potentially not
least, [the new Cold War with Russia has itself become an institution
pervading American political, economic, media, and cultural life.
Russiagate has made it more dangerous, more fraught with actual war,
than the Cold War we survived]{.underline}, as I explain in War with
Russia? Recall only that [Russiagate allegations further demonized
"Putin's Russia," thwarted Trump's necessary attempts to "cooperate with
Russia" as somehow "treasonous," criminalized détente thinking and
"inappropriate contacts with Russia"]{.underline}---in short, [policies
and practices that previously helped to avert nuclear war.]{.underline}
Meanwhile, the [Russiagate]{.underline} spectacle [has caused many
ordinary Russians who once admired America to now be "derisive and
scornful" toward our political life.]{.underline} The scarce good news
it is that some Russian officials hope Mueller's Russiagate exoneration
of Trump will enable the president to resume his attempts to cooperate
with Moscow. The bad institutional news is that Congress has invited, on
House Speaker Nancy Pelosi's initiative, NATO's secretary general to
address it on April 3. That figurehead has announced a renewed attempt
to bring the former Soviet republic of Georgia into the military
alliance. The last such attempt led to the US-Russian proxy war in
Georgia in 2008. When it was tried in Ukraine in 2013, it produced the
still ongoing Ukrainian civil and proxy war. The editor of The New
Yorker, itself an ardent Russiagate publication, asks whether "the moral
and material corruption \[Trump\] has inflicted will be with us for a
long while." Perhaps. But [the institutional costs of Russiagate are
likely to be with us for even longer.]{.underline}

#### Russiagate greenlights expanded militarism and leads to war

**Becker,** member of the Central Committee of the Party for Socialism
and Liberation, 4-7-20**18**

(Brian, "Past a point of no return: "Russiagate" and the reorientation
of U.S. imperialism"
<https://www.liberationnews.org/past-point-no-return-russiagate-reorientation-u-s-imperialism/>,
LASA-IZP)

What I want to talk about is to identify where we are right now in this
political process. It is our belief in the PSL Central Committee that we
have now passed a point of no return with respect to [the "Russiagate"
controversy]{.underline}. It is not going to go away, it [is going to
expand and deepen, and it has a profound implication for U.S. politics
and for global politics]{.underline}. [What we are witnessing
is]{.underline} two convergent phenomena coming together, running in
parallel but now intersecting. One is [a profound, political civil war
going on within the summits of the capitalist political establishment,
the ruling class centers of power in the intelligence
agencies]{.underline}. [The second is a qualitative re-orientation of
U.S. foreign policy and the gearing up for "major power" conflict with
Russia and China as the targets. The goal of this foreign/military
re-orientation is to apply severe pressure of all types on Russia and
China with four identifiable goals: 1) to encircle Russia, weaken it
economically and hem it in on all sides, 2) to compete with China for
dominance in Asia, which is now the most dynamic part of the world
economy, 3) to weaken or end the alliance that China and Russia have
forged in recent years, and 4) to carry out regime change in China and
Russia.]{.underline} Let us start first by examining the first
phenomenon: the intra-class class struggle that is going inside the U.S.
capitalist establishment Multiple ruling class centers of political
power did not expect Donald Trump to win the presidency and they want
his administration to end. This opposition to Trump includes: the
intelligence agencies; the foreign policy establishment cadres from both
ruling class parties; the core of the State Department professional
staff; the Washington think-tank establishment that provides cadres who
come in and out of the capitalist government and in many ways constitute
the professional enduring government in the country; and the leading
capitalist mass media outlets. Their opposition to Trump is not simply
or mainly because he is a bigot, not because he is a misogynist. It is
not because he is a xenophobe, anti-immigrant and anti-Muslim. It is not
because he is an anti-Black racist. Of course, he is all those things,
and he is different from other ruling class politicians in that he
speaks openly and takes the mask off the bigotry that so permeates the
ruling class in America and thus embarrasses the ruling class. This is
considered tasteless. The political leaders of the U.S. capitalist state
have learned that it is discrediting to the system for such blatant,
open displays of reactionary bigotry to take place. But there is another
reason that big sectors of the ruling class and their operatives
considered Donald Trump to be unfit and one of the principal reasons why
the FBI and the intelligence agencies were targeting Trump even in 2016.
If we think back to what Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels wrote in the
Communist Manifesto in 1848, they summarized very succinctly the
different features of modern bourgeois society, the bourgeois system and
capitalism. They used this formulation right at the beginning of the
Communist Manifesto: "The executive of the modern state is but a
committee for managing the common affairs of the whole bourgeoisie." I'm
going to say it again: "The executive of the modern state is but a
committee for managing the common affairs of the whole bourgeoisie."
[Donald Trump is perceived to be unwilling or incapable of representing
or managing the common affairs of the entire bourgeoisie. He is in fact
a unique figure only in this sense; he suddenly became the CEO of the
most powerful executive state apparatus in the world]{.underline}.
Trump's personal background leaves him trained only to be the leader,
the dictator if you will, of a mid-sized, semi-bankrupt real estate
company and a reality TV show personality to boot, whose "star" actually
had been in eclipse for some time. [Donald Trump only cares about Trump
and does not care at all --- as we can see by his conduct in the last
year --- about the common affairs of the bourgeoisie. He is unfit
because he doesn't fit the mold of what the CEO of the dominant
capitalist and imperialist state in the world is required to be. They
want to bring him down and the Mueller investigation has become the
vessel for those in the ruling class who want to end Trump's
presidency]{.underline}. The Mueller investigation only came into being
as the consequence of Trump's political stupidity, as evidenced by his
firing of James Comey as FBI director. Trump ridiculously believed that
since the Democrats hated Comey for his re-opening of the FBI
investigation of Hillary Clinton's personal email use, the Democrats
would applaud Trump's decision to fire him. After all, the FBI
investigation was reopened just eleven days before the Nov. 8, 2016
election, casting a shadow on her campaign. Instead, the Democrats and
anti-Trump liberals embraced the fallen FBI Director as the champion of
"our democracy." [The "Russiagate" probe has two principal objectives
The Russiagate propaganda and agitation campaign is designed to smear
Trump.]{.underline} [It is also being used to build a consensus in the
U.S. for confrontation with Russia, for a sharp acceleration of
militarism and a massive shift of public resources into the coffers of
the Pentagon and war contractors. Russiagate is also being used to smear
the Left, to smear the Black liberation movement, to attack independent
third political parties,]{.underline} to smear our own Party. Mueller
doesn't really have evidence of collusion between Trump and the Russians
that allowed him to become president in 2016. After all, he lost the
popular vote by 3 million votes, and except for the continued existence
of the archaic slave-based electoral college system, Hillary Clinton,
not Trump, would be President. The Russians did not, nor did anyone
else, expect Trump to become the President of the United States. They
did not put their eggs in the Donald Trump basket even if they thought
he would be slightly softer on Russia and less bellicose than Hillary
Clinton and the neo-conservative establishment that supported her.
Clinton and the Neocons were the tip of the spear for a reoriented
foreign policy that explicitly targeted Russia as a consequence of the
events in Ukraine and Syria. Nobody, or very few within the ruling
class, expected in 2016 that Trump would win the presidency. Nobody
counted on it and the ruling class was surprised --- shocked would be
more accurate --- by Trump's victory. The Mueller investigation's broad,
open-ended mandate, as one can see with the recent subpoenas, will be
able to get hold of the Trump organization's financial records. And in
them there will be plenty of corruption, of criminality. There will be
indictments certainly to come against Trump and unless there's a sharp
change in the political situation, a big part of the ruling class will
remain absolutely determined to bring him down. I want us to hear the
words of John Brennan, the former CIA director under Barack Obama.
Brennan, by the way, had a hard time getting the top post in 2009 when
Obama wanted to bring him into that position. But Brennan's main problem
was his deep connection to George W. Bush's torture program. Obama had
to wait and let him sit it out with a secondary position for a few years
until they figured that people (the media) would start to forget what
Brennan and Cheney and Gina Haspel and all the other torturers did. Now,
ironically, liberals love Brennan. But to stay with our main point:
here's what Brennan said about the President of the United States.
Again, the former CIA director until a year ago, he writes these words:
"When the full extent of your venality, moral turpitude and political
corruption becomes known you will take your rightful place as a
disgraced demagogue in the dustbin of history." He goes on to declare
that Donald Trump is one of the biggest liars and leakers in Washington.
Relegated to the dustbin of history? I mean, this is the language that
is normally reserved for Saddam Hussein, or Muammar Qaddafi, or Kim Jong
Un or earlier Fidel Castro, but this is the former CIA director talking
about the President of the United States. It shows the temper and mood
within the ruling class in America and this will be a fight that will
continue. Eventually one side or the other will win. I think that
[within the state apparatus and media, many are determined to find one
way or another to end the Trump presidency, which would then be the
presidency of Mike Pence. So it is really foolhardy, ridiculous, bizarre
and politically wrong for any wing of the Left, certainly in the
working-class, socialist and Marxist movement, to affix itself
politically to one wing or another wing of these ruling class factions
that are involved in deep struggle. The sharp splits and divisions
within the ruling class are not new phenomena. In fact, it is a feature
of what happens to U.S. imperialism within the pinnacle of the political
establishment when the U.S. empire seems to be in decline or in
crisis.]{.underline} Let's start with some recent history: Between 1960
and 1980 there was not one U.S. president who could finish a second term
in office. Just think of what actually happened at that time. The United
States appeared to be losing the misnamed Cold War. Socialism and
national liberation were on the ascension. Cuba was able to fend off a
U.S.-led Bay of Pigs invasion in 1961 that was meant to overthrow the
revolution. Liberation fighters in South Vietnam had launched an
offensive against the U.S. puppet regime. Kennedy was blamed for not
doing enough to overthrow the Cuban government. Kennedy and his brother
had been the main restraining voices within the emergency war council
during the October 1962 Cuban Missile Crisis. Kennedy was deeply
disliked by the Pentagon brass and the CIA. He was perceived by the
Dixiecrats as a "race traitor" because he seemed to favor the end of
apartheid (segregation) in the South and his Justice Department had some
connection to the southern civil rights movement. One year after the
Cuban Missile Crisis, John F. Kennedy was gunned down, assassinated. His
replacement was Lyndon Johnson. Johnson couldn't run for a second term
because of the growing opposition in the streets and within the summits
of the establishment about the failure of the U.S. to win the war in
Vietnam. Johnson would have been replaced by Bobby Kennedy who ran on a
platform of ending the Vietnam War. But Bobby Kennedy was shot dead in
June 1968 on the night that he won the California primary, thus
clinching the Democratic nomination. Absent Kennedy's participation you
have Richard Nixon able to ascend to the White House. Nixon, too, faced
a great struggle within and from the ultra-right in 1972 led by the
campaign of George Wallace. That effort came to an end when Wallace was
felled by a would-be assassin's bullet. Nixon won 49 states in the 1972
election. Wall Street and the military-industrial complex were 100
percent opposed to McGovern assuming the presidency. Nixon was unable to
finish the second term of his time in office because of Watergate. But
Watergate was really the bringing down of Richard Nixon by the FBI. The
so-called "Deep Throat" in the Watergate investigation was none other
than Mark Felt, the number-two man after J. Edgar Hoover in the FBI.
After Nixon was brought down, again because of the intra-class struggle
within the bourgeoisie, Gerald Ford and Nelson Rockefeller became
president and vice president, but without an election; they were
appointed. Ford lost to Jimmy Carter in 1976. And yet,
[Carter]{.underline}, too, [was unable to win re-election in 1980
because of an even more profound, unprecedented schism within the ruling
class. The Pentagon became the spearhead of this incredible clash. More
than 120 retired generals and admirals created the Committee on the
Present Danger. They took out huge full page advertisements blaming
Carter and "weak" leaders for undermining the status of the United
States as the number one super-power in the world. Their message was one
of the most brazen calls for extreme militarism and the ramping up of
virulent anti-Sovietism. Ronald Reagan's 1980 campaign was the vessel
for the Committee on the Present Danger. It was a ruling class coalition
of Generals and Big Oil. The immediate context at that time of the open
split in the ruling class was the 1979 Iranian Revolution and the 1978
socialist revolution/coup in Afghanistan. The loss of Iran via a
people's revolution had a staggering impact on ruling class politics in
the U.S., for Iran had been, along with Israel, the principal agent for
U.S. control over the oil-rich Middle East. The CIA had carried out the
coup in 1953 that returned the Iranian monarchy to the
throne.]{.underline} The Iranian Revolution succeeded in taking power in
February 1979 and in November 1979, Iranian students took over the U.S.
Embassy in Tehran. U.S. hostages were seized from the embassy. As we saw
later, the Iranians refused to release those hostages until January
20th, on that very day, and just a few minutes after Ronald Reagan
became president of the United States. The Reagan campaign had been
colluding with the new Iranian government. There was obviously an
agreement or arrangement between the Reagan campaign, the Republicans
and the Iranian government to not release the U.S. hostages. Failure to
win the release of the American hostages and a botched military effort
to rescue them made Jimmy Carter appear to be a weak leader lacking the
resolve to overcome this so-called Iranian aggression. [Looking back one
can see this great instability of 20 years within the ruling class in
America. The schisms, splits, divisions and toxic struggles within the
ruling class have to be understood as a consequence of
setbacks.]{.underline} It wasn't just Iran, of course. The setbacks that
the U.S. was suffering were on a global scale. Almost all of Southeast
Asia had gone socialist, the African Revolution was on the march,
revolutions in Mozambique, Guinea Bissau, Angola. There was the
Ethiopian revolution in 1974 and an even deeper socialist revolution in
1977. The Afghanistan revolution took power in 1978. The Sandinistas
took power in Nicaragua through an armed struggle in 1979. [The summits
of the U.S. ruling class became toxic with intra-class struggle, not
primarily because of the internal class struggle between the
working-class and the bourgeoisie at home. It was within the bourgeoisie
over how to manage their defeats and setbacks in the global class
struggle.]{.underline} In some respects [we are now in a similar
situation although for different reasons. It is a toxic, fractured
ruling class. Politically, the stakes are very high in terms of the
outcome. Trump represents a current within U.S. politics that believes
the U.S. is a formerly "great" country that is now in decline. The
repeated military interventions in the Middle East provided no new
advance for the United States. These interventions have bogged the
United States down in the Middle East which allowed China to rise as the
new dominant power in Asia.]{.underline} [At the same time, Russia got
back on its feet and resumed a Russia-China strategic relationship that
serves as a buffer against the organic and constant drive for world
domination by U.S. imperialism. The second phenomenon: The
re-orientation of U.S. foreign and military policy **The struggle inside
the ruling class coincides with another major development, the
reorientation of U.S. foreign policy to prepare for a major power
confrontation with Russia and with China.**]{.underline} That is
explicitly stated in the recently released Nuclear Posture Review and
the new National Security Strategy that was released in January. [It is
not about ISIS, it is not about Al-Qaeda, it is not the war on terror.
The Pentagon is now preparing actively, with all of its contingency
planning and budgeting, for what is described as major power
confrontation with Russia or China.]{.underline} Just a few days ago the
Americans sent destroyers twelve nautical miles from Chinese territory.
The Chinese said this was an act of war. This morning, China's Air Force
conducted major exercises, which the Chinese military press-release of a
few hours ago said was a "dress rehearsal for war." The events in
Ukraine and Syria have turned the tide and led to a qualitatively
different assessment within the heights of the U.S. foreign policy
establishment, and in the Pentagon and the CIA, regarding Russia. In
1991 when the Soviet Union collapsed, the United States promised the new
Russian leadership, Boris Yeltsin, that the United States would not take
advantage of the new weakness of Russia to move NATO eastward. But of
course, as we all know that is exactly what happened. All the former
socialist governments had fallen in Eastern and Central Europe. The
socialist governments in former Soviet republics that were not Russia,
Ukraine, for instance, Latvia, Estonia and Lithuania also fell. All of
them with the exception of Ukraine had been incorporated into NATO by
2014, a U.S. multilateral military alliance targeting Russia. NATO has
gone from being located in central or Western Europe right up to
Russia's border. When the government of Viktor Yanukovych was overthrown
in a February 2014 coup d'état led by Neo-Nazis --- and that is not a
rhetorical flourish, they were in fact Nazis and neo-Nazis --- the U.S.
government heralded that as a great "new day" for Ukrainian freedom. The
Russian Black Sea Fleet and the largest naval base of the Russian
military is located in Crimea. It is an area that has been part of
Russia since the 1700s, is majority Russian ethnically and was only
transferred administratively from Russia to Ukraine in 1954 when Ukraine
and Russia were still one country, when they were both parts of the
Soviet Union. When the U.S.-backed coup seized power in Ukraine in 2014,
Putin made it clear Crimea would remain Russian and so the referendum
was allowed to take place in Crimea. And of course the people there
being mainly Russians voted to be part of Russia rather than be ruled
over by an anti-Russian, fascist government in Ukraine, which it was at
that time. It has moderated somewhat now but is still very rightwing. It
was at that time that the U.S. said: "This is it, how dare Russia stop
the unilateral adoption or embrace of all these former Soviet
territories, or former Soviet allies, into an American-led military
alliance?" Ukraine had been the second largest Soviet republic and it
has a very large military. There was no way Russia was going to allow
Ukraine to station a NATO base on its territory. This was precisely
where the Nazis came into Russia in 1941. Of course as we know, they
were defeated, but 27 million Soviet people died. This is a big part of
Russian history, Russian culture, the Russian psyche. I don't know what
the United States thought they could do in Ukraine, but whatever they
thought there was no way Putin or any Russian government would allow
that. At the same time, the United States, having overthrown the
government in Iraq and Libya in 2003 and 2011, was certain that it would
be able to do the same in Syria. Instead of placating the U.S.
government once again, as Russia did in 2011 during the run-up to the
Libya bombing --- when Russia abstained on Resolution 1973 that
authorized the use of military force to "protect civilians" --- this
time Russia said "No." At the invitation of Syrian President Bashar
al-Assad, Putin moved the Russian military decisively into the Syrian
conflict to make it clear that the Assad government would not be toppled
by U.S. imperialism, or Turkey, or its proxy forces ISIS and Al-Qaeda.
And they are their proxies in the case of Syria. [**We have moved into a
new new stage of history, a new stage in the post Cold War era, where
U.S. imperialism is now gearing up for major power confrontations with
Russia and China. We have to see the Russiagate phenomenon and this
witch-hunt, this new cold war, in the larger context of the change in
global politics, and a change in the orientation of U.S. imperialism.**
Even if it started it as such, it is not simply a Democratic Party
excuse for why they were doing badly, or why the DNC leadership demanded
people "shouldn't read those WikiLeaks emails that came from the
Russians."]{.underline} Whatever its origin, [this Russiagate propaganda
witch-hunt has intersected with a reorientation of U.S. foreign policy
that targets Russia and targets China]{.underline}. As a consequence it
must be taken seriously. If you had asked people in Europe, say, 106
years ago, in 1912, "Is it likely that in two years the entire world
will be at war? Is it possible that there could be a world war with a
magnitude of violence between major powers and that 18 million people
could be killed in less than four years?" That had never happened before
in human history. Most people at that time would have thought, "No,
that's inconceivable." But it did happen and 19 years after the end of
World War I, came World War II. [World war happened again because
inter-imperialist and inter-capitalist rivalries became unmanageable.
They became unrestrained. They had their own life. The propaganda
combined with nationalism and populism and economic dislocation created
a situation where a whole new political arrangement came into existence.
Even though none of the parties may have wanted a war, each one kept
taking steps in the direction of war --- each and all took steps to
climb the escalation ladder. Once on the escalation ladder it required
the other side to take countermeasures. It is easy to get on an
escalation ladder, it is very hard to get off an escalation
ladder.]{.underline} My final point is that Donald Trump has replaced
Rex Tillerson, Gary Cohn and now HR McMaster, who were somewhat
"moderating forces" from within the traditional bourgeoisie. Who would
have thought they would be the moderates? They have been replaced with
people like John Bolton who is absolutely committed to war in Iran and
was Dick Cheney's agent for that in 2005. It is important to remember
that the only reason the U.S. did not go to war with Iran in 2005 was
that its war machine became bogged down by the unanticipated armed
resistance of the Iraqi people following the invasion. Look at the
line-up: John Bolton is the replacement as National Security Advisor.
Mike Pompeo will be Trump's Secretary of State. Pompeo is an extreme
right-wing Tea Party Republican. He is not just an Islamophobe, an
extreme racist, but he also wants to rip up the Joint Comprehensive Plan
of Action, the agreement with Iran, in order to set the stage for
confrontation with Iran. [We have entered a new, extremely dangerous
moment. Trump has created a cabinet that is "his" cabinet. It is a war
cabinet. He is now free from previous restraints within the ruling
class, those he considered to be somewhat disloyal, not completely
partisan in the context of this fierce, venomous struggle within the
bourgeoisie. Now that he has loyalists around him it means there will be
a sharpening of the intra-class struggle within the bourgeoisie and a
sharpening of the U.S. war danger]{.underline}. For the moment, it is
General Mattis and the Pentagon that are the voices opposed to ripping
up the JCPOA. [A war with Iran would quickly lead to a regional war and
possibly a global conflagration drawing in major power allies on
competing sides. Militarism and repeated wars are an enduring and
inherent feature of the imperialist epoch of capitalism. We must not
ignore this reality.]{.underline}

### 1NC -- #ClosetheCamps

#### Reports of inhumane conditions at migrant detention centers have sparked targeted protests against Congress- demands by #ClosetheCamps movements are key to create accountability and change along the border

[Immigration advocacy groups will hold nationwide protests]{.underline}
on Tuesday [to demand the closure of detention centers]{.underline}
along the U.S.-Mexico border [amid reports of inhumane and unsanitary
conditions. Over 170 demonstrations are scheduled to take place across
the country, including in border communities and cities]{.underline}
like New York and Los Angeles. [The #CloseTheCamps mobilizations were
organized within the last 72 hours by public policy organizations like
MoveOn, United We Dream, American Friends Service Committee, and
Families Belong Together. \"It\'s not okay to let this go on for a
minute longer while thousands of children and families are
suffering,]{.underline}\" Emma Einhorn, the campaign director for
MoveOn, told Newsweek. [\"We\'re really calling on every member of
Congress to use every power and every tool in their toolbox in order to
make sure that we get relief to these families right now.\" Protesters
are demanding three things from lawmakers on Tuesday: to close the
camps, to stop funding all family detention and to reunite families.
They also want members of Congress to bear witness to detention
conditions and personally visit facilities this week while they are on
recess.]{.underline} Unlike prior rallies against the Trump
administration\'s immigration policies, [these demonstrations are going
to be smaller and more heavily focused on individual members of
Congress. Protests will largely occur at the offices of lawmakers
because participants want to deliver demands in person.]{.underline}
According to Einhorn, the [protests are focused on Republicans who
\"seem to never stand up to the racist and xenophobic policies of Donald
Trump.\"]{.underline} Though [they are also targeting Democrats who
voted last week to give more funds to Immigration and Customs
Enforcement and Customs and Border Protection. The House of
Representatives approved the Senate version of supplemental aid
legislation for border agencies. The \$4.5 billion bill did not include
any of the restrictions sought by House Democrats, including preventing
funds from going toward immigration enforcement or additional bed space
in detention centers.]{.underline} While Tuesday\'s demonstration is not
advocating for specific policy changes, [Einhorn said they are calling
on Congress to find some solutions to the crisis at the southern
border.]{.underline} \"We don\'t need to be holding anyone in detention
if we put our resources and use the knowledge that we already have to
create an immigration system that treats people with dignity and
respect,\" she added. [People call out words of encouragement to
detainees held inside the Metropolitan Detention Center after marching
to decry Trump administration immigration and refugee
policies]{.underline} on June 30, 2018 in Los Angeles, California. On
Tuesday, over 170 protests have been planned to demand the closure of
migrant detention centers amid reports of unsanitary and inhumane
conditions. DAVID MCNEW/GETTY [News reports highlighting the grim and
unsanitary conditions at migrant detention centers have emerged over the
past few weeks.]{.underline} The Associated Press
[reported](https://www.apnews.com/46da2dbe04f54adbb875cfbc06bbc615) in
late June that a Texas facility was neglecting migrant children,
describing how a 2-year-old boy was handed off to be cared for by a
group of young girls. [Attorneys also warned the outlet that there was
inadequate food and water for detained kids.]{.underline} One doctor who
visited detention camp in Clint, Texas,
[told](https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/doctor-compares-conditions-immigrant-holding-centers-torture-facilities/story?id=63879031)
ABC News that the conditions for migrants were comparable to \"torture
facilities.\" [Children were forced to sleep on concrete floors with the
lights on and had no access to hygiene products.]{.underline} As these
reports were being released, [the Trump administration was arguing in
court that migrant children being held in U.S. custody did not require
basic hygiene products like toothbrushes and soap in order to be in a
\"safe and sanitary\" environment. Lawyers with the Department of
Justice claimed that forcing children to sleep on concrete floors in
crowded cells also met safety requirements.]{.underline} On Monday,
[more than a dozen House members visited detention centers in Texas in a
trip organized by the Congressional Hispanic Caucus.]{.underline}
Freshman Democrat Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, who has made headlines for
comparing detention facilities to concentration camps, claimed in a
series of tweets that CBP officials displayed \"inhumane behavior.\"

#### Movements exposing the reality of migrant detention centers are valuable- knowledgably engaging the state enables the public to criticize the government and is a prerequisite to the overthrowing the state.

[When freedom of information and transparency are stifled,]{.underline}
then [bad decisions are often made and heartbreaking tragedies occur --
too often on a breathtaking scale that can leave societies
wondering:]{.underline} how did this happen? [Think about the recent
debates on]{.underline} torture, assassination by unmanned aircraft,
secret warrants and detentions, intelligence and surveillance courts,
[military commissions, immigration detention centers and the conduct of
modern warfare.]{.underline} [These policies affect millions of people
around the world every day and can affect anyone]{.underline} -- wives,
children, fathers, aunts, boyfriends, cousins, friends, employees,
bosses, clergy and even career politicians -- at any time. [It is time
that we bring a healthy dose of sunlight to them.]{.underline} I believe
that when the public lacks even the most fundamental access to what its
governments and militaries are doing in their names, then they cease to
be involved in the act of citizenship. [There is a bright distinction
between citizens, who have rights and privileges protected by the state,
and subjects, who are under the complete control and authority of the
state. In the past decade or so there have been an increasing number of
clashes -- both in the public and behind the scenes -- between the US
government, the news media and those in the public who want fair access
to records that pertain to the implementation of policies by their
government.]{.underline} After the establishment of the National
Security Division of the Department of Justice in 2006, there have been
more national security and criminal investigations into journalists and
prosecutions of their sources than at any other time in the nation's
memory. Eight people have been charged under provisions of the Espionage
Act of 1917 for giving documents and information to the media by this
administration alone -- including me, former
[CIA](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/cia) officers Jeffrey Sterling
and John Kiriakou, and the former Department of State analyst Stephen
Jin-Woo Kim. The roots of this crackdown seem to have begun before the
administration took office: Steven Rose and Keith Weissman were
prosecuted for sharing information about classified foreign policy
issues to members of the media, analysts, and officials of a foreign
nation, though neither man worked for the government or had a security
clearance. The lawyers who prosecuted Rose and Weissman successfully
established their broad interpretation of the Espionage Act before Judge
TS Ellis III; though he ruled in their favor, he also warned that "the
time is ripe for Congress to engage in a thorough review and revision of
\[the Espionage Act of 1917\] to ensure that they reflect \...
contemporary views about the appropriate balance between our nation's
security and our citizens' ability to engage in public debate about the
United States' conduct in the society of nations. And, when I was
court-martialed for providing government documents and information that
I felt were in the public interest to a media organization, the
government charged me with "aiding the enemy" -- a treason-related
offense under the US constitution and military justice system that even
civilians may be charged with. During one of my pre-trial hearing in
January 2013, the military judge in my case, US Army Colonel Denise
Lind, [asked](https://freedom.press/bradley-manning-transcripts) the
government lawyers: "Does it make any difference -- if we substituted
Wikileaks for The New York Times, would the government still be charging
this case in the manner that it has and proceeding as you're doing?" An
assistant trial counsel for the government answered a straightforward
"Yes, Ma'am"; the lead trial counsel elaborated with a reference to a US
Civil War era court-martial, in which the soldier was sentenced to six
months imprisonment without a trained lawyer representing him, or any
post-trial appeals process: "This isn't the first time that Article 104
has been charged for a service member providing information to the enemy
through a member of the news media." The government further argued that
there was no distinction to be made between any media organizations that
provided information to the public, if the government felt would "aid"
the enemy: whether such information was published by a small-time blog,
a controversial website like Wikileaks, a national newspaper like the
Washington Post, or an international one like the Guardian, to the
government, they can all be "aiding the enemy". After 9/11, a dedicated
office of lawyers specializing in novel applications of law for national
security issues, the National Security Division (NSD), was created and
now, with a small caseload and an enormous amount of resources, this
division of the Department of Justice has been waging a quiet war
against the media, their sources and the right to free speech and a free
press, using the growing national security and surveillance apparatus to
prosecute various cases and, occasionally, target the media. Consider
the Department of Justice's admission in May 2013 that they had secretly
seized sensitive office, home and cellular telephone records from more
than 20 reporters working for the Associated Press while investigating a
leak leading to a 2012 AP news story reporting on an operation foiling a
terrorist plot. The president of the AP, Gary Pruitt, called the actions
a "massive and unprecedented intrusion" and noted that the government's
actions were creating a profound chilling effect on sources and members
of the press. The president personally defended the actions of the
Department of Justice, saying: "I make no apologies". The US needs
legislation to protect the public's right to free speech and a free
press, to protect it from the actions of the executive branch and to
promote the integrity and transparency of the US government. We need to
create a media "shield" law with teeth and substance that creates an
effective federal privilege for communications between a journalist and
her sources, preventing the government from compelling testimony from
the journalist and to protect the documents, records and other
information created by the journalist and the actual communications
between the journalist and her sources. The privilege should be in
effect unless the government can prove with clear and convincing
evidence that very clear and dangerous circumstances should merit an
exception. We also need to narrow the murky and awkward military offense
of "aiding the enemy" into a time of war offense and restrict its
application to military personnel. [It can be replaced through the
creation of an explicit "treason" and "misprision of treason" offense
under military law -- based on existing US civilian law -- for those who
openly wage war and attempt to overthrow the US government.]{.underline}
It is also long past time for the government to live up to its
commitment to transparency [by enacting the changes to the Freedom of
Information Act
(Foia)](https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2015/mar/10/republicans-hillary-clintons-emails-pass-foia-reform)
and records retention rules that were in the Foia Improvement Act of
2014, which nearly passed in the US Congress at the end of last year and
were re-introduced this year. It should also amend the Espionage Act and
the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act to require that the government prove a
clear intent to harm the government or anyone else and to make the
motive of the accused relevant at trial. [These changes would go far --
but certainly not all the way -- toward ensuring that future citizens
under future administrations can continue to be able to question and
criticize their government without fear of being publicly humiliated and
prosecuted by their government. It would also set a clear example to the
rest of the world that, in a truly modern democratic republic, the
suppression of the press and sources by criminal prosecutions cannot be
tolerated.]{.underline} Then [the US could no longer be used as an
excuse by repressive governments around the world]{.underline} to say:
"Well, they do it in America, too."

#### Governmental activism is effective in bridging gaps between officials- it creates a "shadow network" to resist national policies and "break down the state"- they preclude that alliance.

[Federal immigration policies in the US require local authorities to
find, detain and collaborate in the deportation of unauthorized
migrants]{.underline} (Daamen & Doomernik, 2014; Ridgley, 2008). [These
practices have been challenged and resisted by urban SMOs in
collaboration with local authorities who have declared themselves
Sanctuary cities that obstruct immigration enforcement. The number of
Sanctuary cities has grown]{.underline} from about 45 in 2008 to more
than 200 in 2016.4 [Similar developments can be found]{.underline} in
the Netherlands [where municipal governments, together with SMOs and
NGOs, contest and resist national policies by creating a 'shadow
network' that provides so-called 'bed-bathbread'
arrangements]{.underline} in the form of temporary housing, schooling,
food and medical support (Kos, Maussen, & Doomernik, 2015, p. 8). [A
striking feature of these cases is the role of politicians, civil
servants and governmental organizations in organizing protest and
resistance against policies proposed by other levels or branches of
government.]{.underline} We would actually expect them to alter or
redress policies through political parties, alumni networks, lobby
activities or negotiations to which they have ample access, but surely
not to stage protest and collaborate with SMOs or NGOs. Nevertheless,
[this mimicking of SMO behaviour is widespread.]{.underline} As the
three cases indicate, we find it across different policy domains and
countries. Other examples can be found in bans on fracking in the US,
France, Germany and the Netherlands, in protests against wind farms, the
siting of mobile phone antennas, the storage of nuclear waste, processes
of municipal amalgamation or protests against new airports. [We argue
that this mimicking of SMO behaviour by politicians and civil servants
is a relevant occurrence in and of itself, and that it is currently
neglected and under-theorized.]{.underline} It is an orphan that suffers
from the disciplinary boundaries between the social movement and
political science literatures. To mark it as an object of study, [we
propose to call it 'governmental activism', which we define as
'politicians, civil servants and governmental players engaging with
citizens, SMOs/NGOs and sometimes businesses in contentious claim-making
to alter or redress policies proposed by other governmental players'.
'Activism' is, as we will also demonstrate below, the correct noun for
the phenomenon because it carries both the unconventional aspects of
government behaviour as well as ostensibly conventional aspects such as
lobbying, negotiation and litigation, which become protest tools under
the umbrella of a contentious claim.]{.underline} Governmental activism
is a layered and dynamic phenomenon that cannot be reduced to a single
characteristic. Based on our three examples, we can find some
commonalities and some differences. First of all, [governmental activism
may start in political parties or governmental players (as in the
Barendrecht or TTIP cases), but it may also be triggered by SMOs (as in
the Sanctuary cities cases). Second, the activism may take forms that
are highly unconventional for governments (organizing demonstrations,
stimulating legal action groups as in the Barendrecht case), they may
employ more conventional forms such as drafting a declaration, lobbying
for their point of view (both TTIP) and create alternative arrangements
(bed-bath-bread).]{.underline} Over time, instances of unconventional
action may be preceded or followed by conventional action (as we will
illustrate below with another case). Third, the activism may be
primarily performed by government (the Green Left party in Barendrecht)
or it may be a form of governance based on mutual dependencies between
government and SMOs (all three cases). Fourth, the collaboration with
SMOs may be very overt (all three cases) or it may be covert (parts of
the Barendrecht case). Fifth, [governmental activism may be highly
symbolic (TTIP) or it is very tangible]{.underline} (Barendrecht,
Sanctuary cities). Sixth, and finally, it may be widespread within the
whole governmental organization (all three cases), or it may be more
isolated within a few political parties or a group of civil servants
(early stages of Barendrecht). In this article, we seek to conceptualize
governmental activism by drawing on social movement and political
science literatures. More specifically, our question is: How do social
movement and political science literatures help us understand
governmental activism? To answer this question, we will first lay a
theoretical foundation for understanding governmental activism. Building
on this, we conceptualize the particulars of governmental activism,
illustrated with empirical examples from the case of municipal
amalgamation of The Hague and its environs in the Netherlands.
Theoretical foundations of governmental activism Being an orphan of two
literatures implies that governmental activism is not properly rooted
and conceptualized. Our aim here is to make a modest start with theory
development that metaphorically lays the foundations for this new object
of study. To do so, we first need to discuss some key assumptions in
both literatures that hamper our understanding and then show what
helpful elements can be picked up and assembled to gain theoretical
traction. Problematic assumptions in social movement and governance
literature Numerous scholars (e.g. Jasper, 1997, pp. 103--129; Kriesi,
Koopmans, Duyvendak, & Giugni, 1995, p. 40) have shown that the state
can induce collective action by producing unwanted policies and threats.
In general, social movement scholars have approached these threats by
applying Tilly's (1978) influential distinction between
states/authorities and SMOs/challengers that situates SMOs outside of
the state. This rather strict divide has caused a social
movement-centric focus on mobilization (McAdam & Boudet, 2012, p. 2),
which ignores the possibility of protest and resistance by governmental
actors. [Governmental activism crosses these boundaries as parts of
government become a challenger of unwanted policies and threats produced
by other parts of government. Some authors do not make the sharp
distinctions between states and SMOs. The new social movement literature
demonstrates governmental agency in protest via temporary affiliations
between oppositional political parties and specific SMOs, but it still
sees SMOs as the prime vehicle for protest mobilization]{.underline}
(Kriesi et al., 1995; Stearns & Almeida, 2004[). The institutional
activism literature shows connections between governments and SMOs via
politicians or civil servants who are also activists and vice versa, but
it remains very movement-centric as well, and focuses on individual ties
instead of collective action by governmental players]{.underline}
(Banaszak, 2005; Pettinicchio, 2012). [The issue coalition literature
indicates governmental mobilizing capacity in engaging civil society
actors in achieving policy goals,]{.underline} for example in the war on
drugs in the US, but it does not pit governmental players against each
other (McCarthy, 2005[). Governmental activism also problematizes the
idea of the state as a 'context' that provides political opportunities
or threats to SMO mobilization]{.underline} (Jasper, 2011). In this
context perspective, [political opportunities are seen as 'consistent --
not necessarily formal or permanent -- dimensions of the political
environment']{.underline} (Tarrow, 1998, pp. 76--77[), or as more
volatile dimensions that change with events, policies and political
actors, such as media access, policy changes and shifts in political
alliances]{.underline} (Gamson & Meyer, 1996, p. 277). [Governmental
activism indicates that there is no 'government' as a whole that engages
with SMOs; instead, we encounter a plethora of governmental players
engaged in contentious interactions with each other, with SMOs and
sometimes with businesses. To appreciate governmental activism from a
social movements' perspective, we thus need to 'break down the
state',]{.underline} as has been argued recently by Duyvendak and Jasper
(2015). This does not imply that governmental players no longer provide
political opportunities, but require a more agency-focused approach to
political opportunities, as we will argue below. [In political science,
the state has been broken down, at least in the vast literature on
governance processes. One common understanding in this divergent
literature is that governmental players become increasingly dependent on
civil society and business players to achieve their goals in relation to
complex problems]{.underline} (Hoppe, 2010; Klijn, 2008). Hence, they
engage with these players in 'governance networks' in which they share
the activity of governing (Bevir, 2011, p. 2; Stoker, 1998, p.1).
[Governance networks are assumed to involve new modes of coordination,
often dubbed 'network governance'. The main claim of network governance
is that processes of governing rely less on authority and sanctions of
government (Stoker, 1998, p. 17) and more on reaching a shared public
purpose through deliberation]{.underline} (Hajer & Wagenaar, 2003;
Klijn, 2008), network management (Klijn, 2008), negotiation,
communication, nudging and other 'soft' policy instruments (Bevir, 2010,
p. 186).

#### Detention has a long-term impact on children that leads to serious mental health problems and trauma

**HRF 18**

(Human Rights First, "Long-Term Detention of Mothers and Children in
Pennsylvania,"
<http://www.humanrightsfirst.org/sites/default/files/HRF-Long-Term-Detention-Brief.pdf>,
DG)

In response to the increasing numbers of women and children requesting
asylum at the southern border in the summer of 2014, [the U.S.
government massively increased so-called family detention.]{.underline}
Rather than adopting a refugee protection and child protection approach,
the Obama Administration implemented an "aggressive deterrence strategy
focused on the removal and repatriation of recent border crossers."1
[That approach has been deeply criticized by a wide array of voices,
including the American Academy of Pediatrics, the American Bar
Association, 178 Representatives of the House and 35 Senators, the
Inter-American Commission on Human Rights, and numerous faith
groups.]{.underline} [Detention, even for a short time, hurts children's
long-term health and development.]{.underline} Aside from the
devastating effect on families, former government officials---among many
others---say deterrence has been ineffective, as evidenced by the
continued arrival of women and children seeking protection from the
violence and persecution plaguing Central America.2 The Pennsylvania
Department of Human Services announced in an October 22, 2015 letter
that it would not renew a license to operate the Berks County
Residential Center as a child residential facility because it was, in
fact, operating "for the detention of immigrant families, including
adults."3 The license expired on February 21, 2016, and an appeal filed
by Berks County is pending before an administrative agency. The facility
continues to operate and detain approximately 80 asylum seeking mothers
and children. [On July 25, 2016, Human Rights First visited Berks with a
delegation of mental health and legal professionals and met with
officials]{.underline} from ICE, the facility director, facility medical
staff, and most of the detained mothers. The visit followed over a year
of working closely with a network of lawyers, nonprofit legal
organizations, community-based organizations, pro bono law firms, and an
on-the-ground pro bono legal services coordinator who visits the
families each week. [Most families at Berks have been there for upwards
of six months. This prolonged detention has had serious negative
consequences for children, including suicidal gestures and ideation,
anxiety, sleeplessness, behavioral regressions, and lack of appetite.
Moreover, the facility has failed to provide adequate health and mental
health care to children and their mothers, has been accused of
institutional neglect, and employs staff members who make children feel
unsafe.]{.underline} Human Rights First reaffirms many of the
recommendations in our 2015 report, Family Detention in Berks County,
Pennsylvania. First, the Obama Administration should reverse its
misguided policy of detaining asylum-seeking mothers and children and
instead implement a refugee protection BRIEF Human Rights First 2
approach. Second, now that the operating license has been revoked, the
Pennsylvania Department of Human Services should order the Berks County
Residential Center to cease operations and issue emergency removal
orders for the families detained there. Families Are Held in Long-Term
Detention, Including Some for Over a Year On September 18, 2015,
Secretary of Homeland Security Jeh Johnson announced that family
detention was "becoming short-term in most cases" and that family
detention centers were becoming "processing centers" where families
would not be detained for prolonged periods of time. Such a transition,
however, didn't take place at Berks, which has become a long-term
detention facility, with release nowhere in sight for many mothers and
children. At the time of our visit, 36 families were detained at Berks.
All families were mothers held with one or, in a few cases, multiple
children, ranging in age from two to 16 years old. (Earlier this year,
the facility also detained fathers with children despite complaints that
young girls were forced to sleep in rooms with unrelated male adults.)
Several families had been held for nearly a year, with at least four
families reaching the one-year mark in August. In our meeting with the
mothers, they explained that about 20 of them had been held for a
prolonged period of more than six months. "We have spent birthdays here,
Christmas, the New Year, Mother's Day, Father's Day It's difficult to
explain \[to our children\] why we are still here." [The uncertainty of
prolonged, indefinite detention weighed heavily on the mothers and, in
turn, on their children. On August 8, 22 mothers announced in an open
letter to Secretary Johnson that they had begun a hunger strike to
protest their long-term detention and its effect on their children.4 The
mothers described their children's emotional distress, which has led
some to consider suicide.]{.underline} Our children, who range in age
from 2 to 16, have been deprived of a normal life. We are already
traumatized from our countries of origin. We risked our own lives and
those of our children so we could arrive on safe ground. [While here,
our children have told us they sometimes consider suicide, made
desperate from confinement. The teenagers say that being here, life
makes no sense. One of our children said he wanted to break the window
to jump out and end this nightmare. Many of these mothers had issued a
statement in February of this year to protest their long-term detention
and request release. At that time, they stated similar concerns and
emphasized their poor treatment at the hands of facility staff and ICE
agents: \[Our\] children have suffered psychological damage, and many of
them have suffered health-wise, because of this confinement, and not to
mention the racist abuse and poor treatment from certain members of the
staff in this detention center,]{.underline} but especially by the
agents of ICE that play and mock our dignity as immigrants. We came here
seeking refuge. We came to this country to save our lives and the lives
of our children. Some of the mothers in long-term detention at Berks are
class members in a constitutional case before the Third Circuit to seek
federal court review of their asylum screening interviews, which they
claim did not include proper procedural protections. The U.S. Commission
on International Religious Freedom, as well as Human Rights First and
other groups, have long raised concerns about the lack of effective
implementation of protection screening safeguards in the expedited
removal process. It is unclear how long that case will carry on. Lee
Gelernt, deputy director of the ACLU Immigrants' BRIEF Human Rights
First 3 Rights Project, which is representing the women in this case,
recently stated, "It is becoming increasingly hard to conclude that
there is not some punitive element to keeping these women in detention
simply because they exercised their right to bring a constitutional test
case."5 [Detention at Berks Has Had Severe Negative Impacts on Children,
Including Suicidality There is clear evidence that detention for
immigration purposes is harmful to the health and wellbeing of children
and families. Studies show that children in immigration detention can
have high rates of psychiatric symptoms, including self-harm, suicidal
ideation, depression, developmental regressions, and post-traumatic
stress disorder, and may suffer physical health problems, such as weight
loss and frequent infections.]{.underline}6 The American Academy of
Pediatrics wrote in a July 2015 letter to Secretary Johnson---in
response to the recent massive expansion of family detention--- that
[detention unnecessarily exposes families with high rates of previous
trauma, physical and sexual abuse, and exploitation to additional
psychological trauma, putting children and their parents "at greater
risk for physical and mental health problems.]{.underline}" The letter
explained that [the "act of detention or incarceration itself is
associated with poorer health outcomes, higher rates of psychological
distress, and suicidality making the situation for already vulnerable
women and children even worse."]{.underline} Even brief periods in
immigration detention are harmful for children. [A recent study found
that families detained for less than two weeks suffered detrimental
effects, which mirrored the negative impacts suffered by children
detained for much longer periods, and noted that any incarceration, even
under relatively safe conditions, is damaging for immigrant children,
especially those with high levels of previous trauma.7 However, the
negative impacts of detention often increase in direct relation to the
period of time in detention, putting children in prolonged detention at
even greater risk of long-term harm.8]{.underline}

### 1NC -- Democracy 

#### The democratic movement is [crumbling]{.underline} in the face of the authoritarian right.

I don't how concerned you are, my friends, about a certain report
investigating a certain President (or it's lack thereof), but you should
be**. [You should be very concerned]{.underline}** indeed. I want to
state a few simple facts, and you are most welcome to disagree if you
like. For almost two years, [a very great deal hung on this
report]{.underline}. It's outcome. It's veracity. It's tenacity. Not
just a Presidency. But [democracy, in a very real sense]{.underline}.
And yet this much vaunted report --- [**the last check and balance on
abuse of power**]{.underline} --- on which so much depended, so far as
we kno**w, [amounts to something less than a wet cough]{.underline}**
[in a thunderstorm]{.underline}. What the? Through the reports' utter
impotence, we can infer two facts which, to me, suggest the worst.
[America's judiciary and its rule of law]{.underline} effectivel**y
[belong to its authoritarians]{.underline}** [at this
point.]{.underline} But [those were **the last functioning institutions
of democracy l**eft.]{.underline} What does that imply? [America's
authoritarians are now **free** to do whatever they like,]{.underline}
and laugh, [since **they know they won't be held to
account**]{.underline} --- just like they do in the authoritarian states
that, ironically Americans have long loved to decry. [Harass and hound
and punish opponents, intimidate and bully adversaries, humiliate them,
try and jail them, parade them, make examples out of them, control
society through fear and a kind of authoritarian terror people from such
collapsed societies know]{.underline} all too well. (If you think I'm
kidding, consider for a fact that [the torture of kids in camps is
already **a daily reality**]{.underline} in 2018's America...that nobody
really cares about.) So "now [they can do whatever they like"
will]{.underline} surely [include using both the judiciary and the rule
of law in abusive ways.]{.underline} Maybe they really will lock her up
(I'd guess much worse is to come, but I'll get to that). It's obvious to
see that opponents and [adversaries will face a vicious revenge campaign
--- one conducted through the organs and powers of the state, which
America's authoritarians, cranks, lunatics, and fascists now fully
control,]{.underline} because all three branches of government are in
their grip. And [that]{.underline}, my friends, [is something like **a
death sentence for a democracy**.]{.underline} Because when you don't
have a functioning judiciary, and you don't have a rule of law , and you
don't have a functioning executive or legislature --- even of the most
minimal kind, which can check the most egregious abuses of power ---
bang! Do you really have a democracy at all anymore? Or something more
like [a state in which any power at all can be abused to its **maximum**
with zero accountability,]{.underline} with impunity, with delight and
for whatever whim strikes the cadre at the top --- and therefore will be
abused? A polity where power has been so concentrated in a single
leader, group, cadre --- executive, legislative, judicial --- isn't
called a democracy. It's called authoritarianism. To put it another way,
the last branch of government that didn't belong to the bad guys was the
judiciary. But now they effectively control all three[. Where does that
leave democracy? **Nailed shut in its coffin,**]{.underline} so far as I
can see. Let me explain, and I'll explain the long way, because I think
it's merited --- so you can skip to the around three quarters of the way
down if you want the conclusions. [America is already a collapsing
democracy]{.underline} --- and I don't just mean a stagnating economy,
or an imploding society, one in which the middle class has become a
minority, reflecting the emergence of a new caste system. Let me say it
again. America is a collapsing democracy. Yes, really. What does that
mean? It means that America's democratic institutions do not work. [But
for institutions "not to work" can mean]{.underline} many things. It can
mean dysfunction, which is to say anarchy and chaos. Or it can mean
[malfunction --- negative function, malice, maliciousness, the inversion
and perversion of good function]{.underline}. When democratic
institutions malfunction, they don't just --- as Americans often think,
so poorly educated by their media and their intellectuals --- "stop
working." That is what dysfunction is. Nor do they "stop reflecting the
will of the majority" and so forth --- simple populist, majoritarian
conceptions of democracy, which still sadly, foolishly rule America's
decrepit public sphere. [When democratic institutions malfunction, they
actively subvert, sabotage, and deny democracy]{.underline}. They invert
and pervert it. Such institutions are used to destroy democracy ---
which is a strange and curious thing, almost unique in the world. A
hammer can't be used to destroy itself. Nor can a river, a meadow, or a
book. But democracy can. In that respect, [democracy is very much like a
living thing.]{.underline} "Malfunction", remember, isn't just the
absence of "good function" --- it is the presence of "bad function",
which is to say it isn't just incompetence, ineptitude, inadequacy, but
malice, antipathy, destructiveness. Now. Where would you say America's
institutions are? Are they dysfunctional --- or malfunctioning? To
answer that question well, we need to first answer the question: what is
democracy, anyways? As I've said, Americans are led to believe that
democracy is something naive, simple, trivial: an algorithm, which
executes "the will of the people." But democracy is no such thing.
Democracy, first and foremost, is the assignation and possession of
inalienable rights. [**The "will of the people" isn't going to matter
very much if the people don't have rights.**]{.underline} Democracy is
therefore grounded in constitutions, which "institutionalize"
institutions, such as courts and laws and parliaments and so forth ---
the point of this whole exercise is simply to bring rights to life.
Voting and whatnot comes a distant second. To put that in perspective,
think for a moment about how rights had to precede --- by centuries ---
the birth of modern democracies. [Democracies **only** really came to
exist when people had rights]{.underline} --- after, for example, great
turning points in history, like Magna Carta --- [because there was
nothing to allocate, exercise, or interpret otherwise. That brings us to
another understanding]{.underline} --- just as necessary, just as absent
from American public discourse --- [of what democracy really is.
**Modern democracy is in that way a process --- not a
state**.]{.underline} "[Democracy", if we're to take the word seriously
at all, is something that only arrived in mature form a few decades
ago.]{.underline} Until 1920, women didn't have the right to vote. Until
1971, America was segregated. And so forth. Democracy wasn't born on
1776 or 1862. Democracy has had a long, difficult, terrible birth ---
which has spanned the millennia and the centuries. What has that battle
for "democracy" really been intending to grant, to expand, to bestow?
Three things, fundamentally. Freedom, justice, and equality. When
America was segregated, [most white Americans would have proudly said
they lived in a "democracy." But it makes a mockery of the word for an
apartheid state to call itself a "democracy", doesn't it?]{.underline}
Today, we know what a grave error that was. And yet we haven't quite
understood the lesso[n. Democracy is a process, a way, an attitude ---
something that is ever being created and reborn and forged.]{.underline}
A process of what, precisely? [Not just voting, to express the "popular
will."]{.underline} Remember, most Americans were very happy living in
their apartheid state --- so happy, they were deluded enough to call it
a democracy. But it wasn't --- or if it was, democracy means
subjugation, take your pick. [Democracy is therefore the process of
assigning and expanding rights. Very certain kinds of rights. Rights to
freedom, justice, and equality.]{.underline} Now. If democracy is the
process by which rights of freedom, justice, and equality expand, then
if these rights are receding or shrinking --- or if they cannot be
exercised by groups --- then we cannot really say a society is a
democracy at all. The most that we can say is that it is a collapsing
democracy, an autocracy, or an authoritarianism. I know that was a lot.
But I want you to understand this stuff in ways that the foolboys on CNN
and Faux News won't discuss, precisely because they don't understand it
themselves. Finally, we can answer our question. Is American democracy
dysfunctional --- or is it malfunctioning? If it's just dysfunctional,
we probably won't see much at all --- just a sense that things are
stuck. [But if it's malfunctioning, we'd see evidence of the democratic
process]{.underline} --- which by now we've defined as the expansion of
rights to freedom, justice, and equality --- diminishing and declining.
We'd see democracy used, in other words, to destroy itself --- like a
great fire, burning itself right down to ashes. If you ask me, all the
above leads me to suggest in no uncertain terms that American democracy
has crossed the line from dysfunctional to malfunctioning. Dysfunctional
was New Gingrich and Paul Ryan cynically gumming up the works of
Congress, to prove how tough and macho they were, to grind the gears of
procedure and law down to dust. But malfunction is what we see now: the
emergence of institutions of the state used in genuinely repressive,
toxic, and increasingly violent ways. Some of these malfunctions are
loud and easy to spot. Concentration camps. Little kids put on trial.
Families being "separated", which is to say, children being abducted by
a state, and given to those of "pure" blood. Malfunction --- the
institutions of democracy being used for authoritarian purposes. This
should remind you of Nazi Germany because it is precisely what happened
there. Basic democratic institutions --- laws, courts, police forces,
property rights --- were all perverted and turned upside down. Instead
of assigning inalienable rights to all, they took them away from some.
All those democratic institutions were used to first unemploy, then
exclude, then dispossess, then expropriate, then finally exterminate,
Jews and other "impure" peoples. Note the point: democratic malfunction
is a far more severe problem than democratic dysfunction. It is the use
of democratic institutions for deeply harmful purposes, which deny the
very purpose of democracy, expanding freedom, justice, and equality. And
yet some of America's democratic malfunction is hidden in plain sight.
And chief among these examples is the report that a nation was waiting
for...which seems to be something like Schrodinger's report. Does it
exonerate or impllcate? Does it vindicate or vilify? The answer appears
to be both. But the answer cannot be both, in a democracy. For the
answer to be both is a form of democratic malfunction, which sets the
stage for further democratic malfunction. Either a leader is obeying the
rules of democracy --- or he is not. He is not "sort of" or "kind of"
obeying the rules. And if no such verdict can be delivered --- well,
then, my friends, the rules don't matter. And if the rules don't matter,
they can be bent and twisted to suit any purpose. What a report without
a meaning, verdict, or purpose says is this: the rule of law belongs to
the authoritarians now, too. The judiciary belongs to the bad guys. But
those were the last two things between America --- and full on
democratic collapse. How do you think the next election will go, for
example, if the judiciary's controlled by the authoritarians? Think
about it. Which gives us pretty clear indications of what is to come
next --- if a brief glimpse at authoritarian regimes the world over
already doesn't. It's about to be open season. On opponents, on
adversaries, on everybody and anybody that the bad guys don't like,
don't won't, won't tolerate. Such people will now begin to meet the full
force of the institutions of the state. They will be hounded and pursued
using the "law" as a tool of repression and subjugation and harassment
and worse. [All the things that are typical in authoritarian regimes, in
other words, will soon enough become **typical in
America**.]{.underline} But that should come as no surprise --- they
already are, from camps to indecent trials (for kids) to bizarre
scandals to a media packed with sycophants that don't seem to know what
democracy even is, or ever was. Still, that's no excuse. These things
should happen in no country --- but soon enough, my guess, is that
political opponents will begin being harassed and jailed on trumped up
(LOL) charges, made examples of, to intimidate and bully, in the ways
that mafias so love, because abuse of power is the only logic they know.
Americans should expect the worst now --- America is about to become the
kind of country, marked by flagrant abuse of ultra-concentrated power,
in tyrants, that Americans long held in contempt. Their democracy is
dead. [The loss of the judiciary and the rule of law was the final nail
in its coffin]{.underline}. Maybe it'll be revived in two years, but I
doubt it. [The judiciary is often **the last bulwark** of democracy in
failing states.]{.underline} If you have impartial courts and tough
prosecutors to enforce even a vaguely impartial law --- perhaps, one
day, you can bring the wrongdoers to account. But if you do not have
those things, my friends, you don't have anything standing between you
and the bottom of the abyss anymore. The process of democracy, expanding
rights to freedom, justice, and equality, turns on itself, in situations
like the ones Americans have got themselves into. That's where Americans
are now. Their democracy is dead, and for all intents and purposes, they
have something as close to a tyranny as a modern rich country can hope
to get. They don't know it, and they're not told it, and they won't get
it, until it's too late, though it already is I suppose. By that I mean
the pattern of shock and surprise over every transgression of the
authoritarians and the fascists will continue --- right down, in this
case, to the abuse of legal powers, for transparently political
purposes. Americans will be alarmed and startled when all that begins
--- when she really is locked up. But they shouldn't be. Maybe that's
America's fate now, to be a collapsed democracy. After all, it spent the
last fifty years collapsing everyone else's. After all, many of them
seem to revel in it, to love it. Maybe there's a kind of rough justice
in that --- the fact that Americans still don't know they're living in a
society that's gone so far past the point of no return, the desert looks
like the ocean.

First, [**individual citizens can hold power to account b**y bringing
new and relevant facts into the public light. People can serve as
watchdogs, activists for truth, and monitors of governance.]{.underline}
[Individual people can serve as more credible truth tellers than other
parts of society]{.underline} that are viewed as beholden to special
interests or lobbying. From photographing police violence to tracking
public documents online (e.g., through the Freedom of Information Act)
to ensuring that elected officials maintain their campaign promises**,
[individuals can become purveyors of truth]{.underline}** [and put
pressure on institutions and elected officials.]{.underline} Take, for
example, India's Mumbai Votes, where information crowdsourced by
students and activists on elected officials is viewed as credible and
reliable information, often in contrast to biased paid news. In an
environment of declining institutional trust, there is a vacuum of
facts. [Individual people empowered with a smartphone or even a
microphone can be the purveyors of **truth** and can]{.underline}
leverage that information to [**hold government
accountable**.]{.underline} Second, [citizens can **revitalize** the
power of diverse community-based organizations.]{.underline} For a long
time, these organizations weaved the vibrant fabric of America civic and
communal life. Alexis de Tocqueville's writings about early American
life included the potency of civic associations for strengthening
democracy. One component of these organizations was the ability for
people to come together across different ideologies and beliefs. Today
these organizations are no longer as vital, diverse, or powerful as they
once were, and [American democracy has suffered]{.underline} as a
result. There has been much scholarship on the decline of civic
associations in the United States. **[Now is the moment to reengage with
civil society organizations --- not just passively]{.underline} d**onate
every year. Instead[**, actively participant** in local chapters of a
national group or a neighborhood association]{.underline}. [Civic
organizations are not a monolith.]{.underline} There are some that are
filled with people who share the same preconceived views, while others
may have less homogeneous ideology. Given the changing relationship
between citizens and government, [**now is the critical moment** to form
nontraditional alliances and more deeply engage with people with
dissenting viewpoints.]{.underline} [The goal is to strengthen critical
civil society institutions, not just to feel reaffirmed.]{.underline}
Building tolerance for peaceful dissent and [**disagreement** toward
shared democratic goods,]{.underline} which transcend any one person,
[**is a critical building block** for reinventing the relationship
between citizens and the state.]{.underline} Finally, across our 3,007
counties there are participatory options and new partnerships between
government and the people to work collaboratively as co-producers of
public goods. For example, Central Falls, Rhode Island, which is Rhode
Island's only majority-Hispanic community, was the first city in Rhode
Island to declare Chapter 9 bankruptcy. The city government decided to
try something new to engage the community around a shared project. It
partnered with Citizinvestor, a crowdfunding and civic engagement site
that is similar to "Kickstarter for governments," to launch a civic
crowdfunding campaign, one of the first in the United States. [Local
residents were active participants in every part of the
process]{.underline}: identifying the area for fundraising; pledging
their own dollars; and collaborating. Examples like this are occurring
across the country wher**e [citizens are empowered not]{.underline}**
[merely **in a consultative or advisory role,** but are given a real
role in public decision-making]{.underline}. Another process gaining
momentum across the country is participatory budgeting, a World Bank
"best practice" in democratic reform to give residents a portion of
public money to decide how to allocate. Last year, community residents
allocated more than \$60 million across the United States through
discretionary funds of local officials, since the process started in
2009 with \$1 million in discretionary funds in a Chicago ward. Perhaps
we can learn from instructive international examples in Brazil or in
Paris, where €100 million per year is allocated through the process.
Strengthening the relationship between citizens and their government
requires tireless energy, vigilance, and creativity. By design this
requires new experiments. Charlotte, North Carolina, won a Knight Cities
Challenge for a project called Crown TownHall, which offers direct
one-on-one opportunities for local public city officials to have an
in-person conversation with a member of the community. This requires
time on behalf of both citizens and their public officials. Deepened
relationships can develop even with just a 10-minute conversation. [It
is going to take unprecedented work to rebuild the civic fabric and
reignite the civic associations that have been the hallmark of
America]{.underline}. Many of us feel fired up, angry, or worried about
the direction of our country. [The way to move forward begins with
sustained civic activity, one conversation at a time.]{.underline}

the word means to them.]{.underline} The path dependencies of the brain
become deeply ingrained in our neural circuitry through a lifetime of
repetition. As such, [these words will continue to be used, but they are
**highly problematic** for describing political positions]{.underline}
because as deeply held personal identifiers they tend to immediately
evoke strong emotions and sets of assumptions in our brains simply upon
hearing or reading them, which can put us in an agitated state and blind
us to the content of an argument. [Emotions are an important part of
discourse because they signal passion and commitment, but **too often we
focus on the identity labels and don't take the time to understand where
our views actually converge and diverge**]{.underline}. Given that
people bring their own specific sets of assumptions to the terms and
there is no widely understood definition of them, without clarification
they serve primarily as empty rallying cries. And throwing a "neo" in
front of "liberal" or "conservative" does not make them any clearer as a
means of explaining mental frameworks, policy agendas, identities, or
life philosophies. Our highly interactive, globalized communications
environment further complicates an already muddled American
understanding of what these words mean. [The complexity of today's world
can be overwhelming and scary.]{.underline} The technological,
ecological, and associated social changes we are collectively
experiencing are highly disruptive and deeply unsettling, even as there
is great potential for a better future. In order to confront the
challenges of today, we would benefit from a renaissance of thought,
especially in our public life. Many are not aware of it, but [we are
living through **a paradigm shift** in science based on deeper
understanding of ourselves and the world around us --- which tends to be
articulated in terms such as "complex systems" and "emergent
properties"]{.underline} (for my fellow nerds out there, this is what
Thomas Kuhn talked about in The Structure of Scientific Revolutions).
Our language must adapt to better account for the complexity and nuance
that we know to be present from meticulous observation, measurement,
experimentation, and perceptual attentiveness, but which we struggle to
communicate with each other in words. The call for improving our lexicon
has been made by people such as renowned neuroscientist Mike Gazzaniga,
whose 2011 book, Who's in Charge? Free Will and the Science of the
Brain, is one of many works that illustrate this paradigm shift. As
Casey Schwartz has summarized his argument, **"[Gazzaniga is calling for
a new 'vocabulary' --- one that doesn't yet exist]{.underline}** [---
that captures the dynamism between the brain and the mind, between the
individual and the group, between the group and the
environment.]{.underline} All of these [relationships are two-way
streets; none a matter of simple, linear cause and effect." Political
spectrums are useful analytical frameworks for where one's views fall
relative to the rest of society on specific political issues such as
different aspects of the climate change debate;]{.underline} the
importance of material social equity as an absolute and when weighed
against incentives to innovate and work hard; [the different mechanisms
government should use to shape the structure of our economic system; how
broad our notion of social inclusion should be]{.underline}; how much we
should allow predictive computer algorithms to guide policing and other
government decision-making; the degree to which we should regulate
electronic data collection and processing by corporations and
government; and how to adapt our policies to the rapid social
reconfigurations and displacement brought about by modern networked
electronics and computer-robotics, such as increased automation, the
"sharing economy," and the "gig economy." [On questions such as when it
is appropriate to genetically engineer human beings, we have not begun
to scratch the surface]{.underline}. It seems fraught with risks of
unintended consequences and nefarious uses as well as significant
benefits, but how many of us have weighed all of the different arguments
for and against?

**retreated from** those **principles**, and the world has become much

You can never guarantee a positive outcome--- not in chess, not in war,
and certainly not in politics. The best you can do is to do what you
know is right and to try your best. I speak from experience when I say
that the citizens of unfree states do not expect guarantees. They want a
reason to hope and a fighting chance. People living under dictatorships
want the opportunity for freedom, the opportunity to live in peace and
to follow their dreams. [From the **Iraq War** to the **Arab Spring**
to]{.underline} the current battles for liberty from [**Venezuela** to
**Eastern Ukraine**, people are fighting for]{.underline} that
[opportunity]{.underline}, giving up their lives for freedom. [The

U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates and the rest of the free world
[has an **unprecedented advantage** in economic and military
strength]{.underline} today. [What is lacking is the will]{.underline}.
The will to make the case to the American people, [the will
to]{.underline} take risks and [invest in]{.underline} the **[long-term
security]{.underline}** of the country, and the world. This will require
investments in aid, in education, in security that allow countries to
attain the stability their people so badly need. [Such]{.underline}
investment [is **far**]{.underline} more moral and far [**cheaper** than
the cycle of **terror, war, refugees, and military
intervention**]{.underline} that results [when America leaves a vacuum
of power. The best way to help refugees is to prevent]{.underline} them
from becoming [refugees in the first place. The Soviet Union was an
**existential threat**]{.underline}, and this focused the attention of
the world, and the American people. There [\[The\]]{.underline}
existential [threat today is not]{.underline} found [on a map,
but]{.underline} it is [very real]{.underline}. The forces of the past
are making steady progress against the modern world order. [**Terrorist
movements** in the Middle East, **extremist parties**]{.underline}
across Europe, a paranoid tyrant in **[North Korea]{.underline}**
threatening nuclear blackmail, [and]{.underline}, at the center of the
web, [an aggressive KGB dictator]{.underline} in Russia. They all want
to turn the world back to a dark past because [their survival is
threatened by]{.underline} the values of [the free world, epitomized by
the U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates. And [they are thriving as
the U.S. has **retreated**. The global freedom index]{.underline} has
[declined for **ten consecutive years**]{.underline}. No one like to
talk about the United States as a global policeman, but this is what
happens when there is no cop on the beat. [American leadership **begins
at home**]{.underline}, right here. [America **cannot
lead**]{.underline} the world **[on democracy]{.underline}** and human
[rights if there is no unity on]{.underline} the meaning and
[importance]{.underline} of these things. [Leadership is
required]{.underline} to make that case clearly and powerfully. Right
now, Americans are engaged in politics at a level not seen in decades.
It is an opportunity for them to rediscover that making America great
begins with believing America can be great. The Cold War was won on
American values that were shared by both parties and nearly every
American. Institutions that were created by a Democrat, Truman, were
triumphant forty years later thanks to the courage of a Republican,
Reagan. [This]{.underline} bipartisan consistency [created]{.underline}
the [**decades of strategic stability** that is the great strength of
democracies. Strong institutions]{.underline} that **[outlast
politicians]{.underline}** allow for long-range planning. In contrast,
[dictators]{.underline} can [operate only tactically, not strategically,
because they are not constrained]{.underline} by the [**balance of
powers**, but cannot]{.underline} afford to [think beyond]{.underline}
their own [survival. This is why]{.underline} a dictator like [Putin has
an **advantage in chaos**]{.underline}, the ability [to move
quickly]{.underline}. This can only be met by strategy, by long-term
goals that are based on shared values, not on polls and cable news. [The
fear of making things worse has]{.underline} paralyzed [\[prevented\]
the U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates [from]{.underline} trying
[to make things better]{.underline}. There will always be setbacks, but
the United States cannot quit. [The spread of democracy is the **only
proven remedy** for nearly **every crisis** that plagues the
world]{.underline} today. [**War, famine, poverty, terrorism**--all are
generated and exacerbated by authoritarian regimes. A policy of America
First]{.underline} inevitably [puts]{.underline} American [security
last]{.underline}. American [leadership is required because **there is
no one else**]{.underline}, and because it is good for America. There is
no weapon or wall that is more powerful for security than America being
envied, imitated, and admired around the world. Admired not for being
perfect, but for having the exceptional courage to always try to be
better. Thank you.

### 1NC -- 2020

#### Trump will lose the 2020 election.

**Bitecofer 19** -- (Rachel Bitecofer, political-science professor at
the Wason Center for Public Policy at Christopher Newport University,
"Why Trump Will Lose in 2020",
<https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/24/opinion/trump-2020-election.html>,
Published January 24, 2019, Accessed July 13, 2019, njt)

With several major Democratic primary candidates having declared, the
palace intrigue of America's 2020 presidential election is already in
nearly full swing. But what if I were to tell you that barring a
significant unforeseen shock to the system, the outcome of 2020 is
already set in stone?

[The high levels of hyperpartisanship and polarization in the electorate
have profoundly affected the political behavior of Americans and, by
extension, made the outcome of our elections highly
predictable.]{.underline}

Always powerful, partisanship has become the be-all and end-all for
American voters. With these political dynamics, a person accused of
sexual misconduct against teenage girls and young women can run for and
win upward of 90 percent of his party's vote --- as the Republican Roy
Moore did, according to exit polls, in the special Senate election in
Alabama in 2017.

Yet [a key aspect of polarization has been somewhat overlooked: negative
partisanship. Voters with this attitude are mobilized not by love of
their own party so much as by hatred of the opposition party. Negative
partisanship especially benefits the party that doesn't hold the
presidency, because out-party voters find themselves living in a world
where their political preferences are under constant assault, or at
least appear to be so.]{.underline}

[For the midterms, I devised a new forecasting model informed partly by
this new paradigm of voter behavior. It was as accurate as the best in
the forecasting business, and my predictions were made months ahead of
the others.]{.underline} That's important, because it is already telling
us what we can expect from the 2020 election.

For the 2018 midterms, [my model predicted a large partisan surge for
Democrats]{.underline}. I identified America's suburbs as ground zero
for a political realignment away from Republican House candidates. [The
realignment was fueled by two things: One was conventional --- the
movement of disaffected independent, or swing, voters away from the
president's party,]{.underline} which has happened in every midterm
election since 2006.

[The other can be tracked to the mobilization of negative partisanship
in driving turnout from Democrats who usually sit out midterm elections.
By identifying Republican-held districts with both a reasonably
competitive partisan electorate and a large number of college-educated
voters who could form a Democratic turnout swell, I predicted --- in
July 2018 --- that negative partisanship would allow Democrats to pick
up 42 House seats and sweep "Reagan country" in Orange County,
Calif.]{.underline} At first, my model was an outlier, but by Election
Day, the FiveThirtyEight "classic" forecast, Sabato's Crystal Ball and
the Cook Political Report all agreed with my forecast.

Motivated by the threat posed by the Trump administration, casual
Democratic voters, especially college-educated women, have been
activated since Mr. Trump's election and will remain activated so long
as the threat he presents to them remains. And the complacent Democratic
electorate of the 2010 and 2014 congressional midterms as well as the
2016 presidential election is gone (for now). It has been replaced by a
galvanized Democratic electorate that will produce the same structural
advantage for Democrats that manifested in the 2018 midterms.

The surge won't be uniform. Democrats will win big in more urban, more
diverse, better-educated and more liberal-friendly states and will
continue to lose ground in other states like Missouri. [Although Mr.
Trump may well win Ohio and perhaps even Florida again, it is not likely
he will carry Michigan, Wisconsin and Pennsylvania in 2020. Look at the
midterm performance of statewide Democrats in those states. And his
troubles with swing voters, whom he won in 2016, will put Arizona, North
Carolina and perhaps even Georgia in play for Democrats and effectively
remove Virginia, Colorado, Nevada and New Hampshire from the list of
swing states.]{.underline}

In short, [the 2020 presidential election is shaping up as a battle of
the bases, and the Democrats' base is simply bigger. When their
demographic advantage combines with an enthusiasm advantage and
heightened party loyalty fueled by negative partisanship, they hold a
significant structural advantage]{.underline}. Turnout in 2018 was about
12 points higher than 2014 turnout and higher than any midterm in
decades. Midterm turnout can sometimes trail presidential-election-year
turnout by 20 points. It was just 10 points in 2018, when it hit nearly
50 percent, versus 2016[. It is not infeasible that turnout in 2020 will
exceed 65 percent. Presidential-cycle electorates are better for
Democrats than midterm electorates are]{.underline}, and the third-party
share in 2018 was also at its lowest levels in decades. In congressional
midterms, the average third-party balloting rate in recent elections is
about 3.5 percent; in 2018, it was just half that.

We'll spend the next 21 months captivated by an election whose outcome
may already be determined because of polarization and negative
partisanship. [Democrats have a clear path to recapturing the White
House]{.underline}. It is hard to imagine any other president facing
these conditions running for re-election. But needless to say, Mr. Trump
isn't just any other president.

#### Democratic opposition to Trump's arms sales to Saudi Arabia are key to their campaign strategy -- the aff's move away from a political approach to demilitarization tanks that.

Democrats see a path to unseat Trump in 2020",

[Congress is poised to pass its first war-powers resolution ordering an
end to U.S. involvement in hostilities overseas, rebuking President
Trump's embrace of Saudi Arabia and handing Democrats what they consider
a vital component of their strategy for challenging him in
2020.]{.underline} Trump's strained relations with traditional allies in
Europe, his warm words for Russia and his unpredictable approach to the
Middle East have triggered broad bipartisan efforts to blunt his
actions. But Democrats and Republicans remain mostly divided over
restraining U.S. military support for the Saudi-led bombing campaign in
Yemen, where a humanitarian crisis has raised questions about the moral
and strategic costs of seeking lucrative weapons deals and enabling
foreign wars, even as lawmakers appear set to send Trump their
resolution. Foreign policy is not traditionally a marquee campaign
issue, nor is Congress usually the forum to forge presidential
platforms. But with seven currently serving Democratic lawmakers hoping
to replace Trump, such votes on Capitol Hill matter and could set the
agenda for the party as a whole. "[National security is a huge
opportunity for Democrats in 2020 because of how ham-handed President
Trump has been in his relationships with the world," said
Sen]{.underline}. Chris [Murphy]{.underline} (D-Conn.), who was among
the earliest and most vocal agitators for a new approach to Saudi
Arabia. "If we don't run a candidate who wants to talk about foreign
policy," he added, "we're missing an opportunity." The United States has
provided Saudi-led forces with logistical support and intelligence since
2015, aid aimed at beating back the rise of Iran-aligned Houthi rebels
in Yemen's civil war. Critics say the campaign has targeted civilians
and choked off desperately needed humanitarian supplies, leaving more
than 20 million Yemenis at risk of starvation. Under pressure, the Trump
administration announced late last year that it would stop refueling
Saudi aircraft. But [lawmakers in the House and the Senate have since
secured votes on Yemen-focused resolutions to cease everything but
intelligence sharing with the Saudis,]{.underline} a rebuke inspired in
part by the killing of Saudi journalist and Washington Post contributor
Jamal Khashoggi. Thus far, seven Republicans have supported those
efforts in the Senate, and 18 in the House, along with the full roster
of Democrats in both chambers. It took a few years for these efforts to
challenge U.S. activity in Yemen --- a mission begun under the Obama
administration --- to move from a fringe issue in Democratic politics to
one that party lawmakers fully support. Most Democrats made the shift in
response to Trump's early and unapologetic embrace of Saudi Arabia even
as Yemen's humanitarian crisis worsened. Khashoggi's killing last fall,
and Trump's subsequent defense of Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman
despite intelligence assessments indicating he had ordered the slaying,
fully solidified Democratic opposition to the Yemen venture. The subject
has been thornier for Republicans, who have condemned Saudi leaders over
Khashoggi's killing but wavered on whether to pull support for the
military campaign as the president is expected to veto any congressional
attempt to do so. Even those critical of the fight in Yemen have balked
at endorsing a war-powers resolution because there are no U.S. ground
troops there backing Saudi-led efforts against the Houthis --- and
because bipartisan efforts to limit arms sales to Saudi Arabia don't
have buy-in from party leaders. [As Republicans wrestle with the issue,
Democrats have taken it to the campaign trail.]{.underline} Within days
of Khashoggi's disappearance in Turkey last October, Sen. Bernie
[Sanders]{.underline} (I-Vt.), who wrote the Senate's war-powers
resolution, listed Yemen --- along with Afghanistan and Iraq --- as the
United States' most troubling military boondoggles. In a speech at Johns
Hopkins's School of Advanced International Studies, he [declared that
"Saudi Arabia is a country clearly inspired by Trump" and that it
pursued the "catastrophic" war in Yemen, along with Khashoggi's killing
and other controversial ventures because its crown prince "feels
emboldened by the Trump administration's unquestioning
support."]{.underline} The next month, Sen. Elizabeth
[Warren]{.underline} (D-Mass.) delivered a foreign policy speech at
American University in which she [said that Trump "refused to halt arms
sales to Saudi Arabia in part because he is more interested in appeasing
U.S. defense contractors than holding the Saudis
accountable."]{.underline} "American security and American values should
come ahead of the profit margins of these private companies," she
continued. "Foreign policy should not be run exclusively by the
Pentagon." Though other congressional Democrats running for president
have yet to make similar speeches outlining their foreign policy vision,
they have --- in tweets and in votes --- expressed exasperation with and
called for reexamining the alliance with Saudi Arabia. [Experienced
Democratic strategists are urging party candidates to make Trump's
dealings with Riyadh a litmus test on the president's
character.]{.underline} "It puts on display what so many Americans
across the country really detest about the Trump administration: It's
rejection of American values, it's putting the interest of an autocratic
kingdom ahead of our own," said Ned Price, a spokesman for National
Security Action, a group of former Obama administration and Hillary
Clinton campaign officials who have offered foreign policy advice to
2020 candidates. Politically, Trump's closeness to Saudi leaders is
comparable to his praising Russian President Vladimir Putin, Price said,
in that it's "a question of what, precisely, is the motivation of people
--- including the president and his son-in-law" Jared Kushner, a senior
adviser to the president, whose closeness with the Saudi crown prince
has aroused suspicion among the administration's critics, given reports
that businesses tied to Kushner and his relatives have sought investment
from Saudi Arabia and other Persian Gulf nations. [Democrats believe
they can use the party's stance on Yemen and Saudi Arabia to pitch a new
foreign policy vision for the country --- one that prioritizes diplomacy
and economic engagement over a heavy reliance on the military and
related industries.]{.underline} Moving away from global military
engagement has been a longtime rallying cry for far-left and far-right
outside groups advocating for withdrawal from Yemen long before Sanders
and Sen. Mike Lee (R-Utah) drafted the Senate's version of the
war-powers resolution. Most congressional Democrats making presidential
runs also embrace the idea of scaling back America's global military
engagement. Earlier this year, as some in the party warned that a Middle
East policy bill admonishing Trump for seeking to abruptly withdraw
troops from Syria and Afghanistan might be construed as an endorsement
of "endless war," only one Democrat running for the White House voted
for it: Sen. Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota. But [even staunchly antiwar
Democrats are aware that the party's voters are not all as progressive
on foreign policy matters as its current headliners or its activist base
--- and that simply being antiwar, when Trump is being excoriated for
his proposed military drawdowns, is a losing strategy. "Withdrawal can't
be what binds Democrats together heading into 2020," said Murphy, one of
the Senate's most outspoken Democrats on military disengagement. "If all
we are about is pulling out of Afghanistan, pulling out of Yemen, then
we will not attract conservative Democrats," many of whom have favored a
hawkish approach to international affairs.]{.underline} Democrats have
not made a successful opposition foreign policy pitch since the Iraq War
was at its height, when Barack Obama was running for president. With
that in mind, Murphy has tried over the past few years to connect
lawmakers with experts to study issues such as Saudi policy, and
brainstorm new approaches to global threats. Several presidential
hopefuls, including Sanders, Warren, and Sens. Cory Booker (D-N.J.) and
Kamala D. Harris (D-Calif.), have participated in those discussions,
according to people familiar with them. [Although most Democrats are
still designing their foreign policy platforms, a few themes have
emerged as candidates stump for prioritizing economic and humanitarian
investment over weapons sales, diplomatic engagement over military
deployments, and climate change as a means of rebalancing alliances with
oil-rich nations such as Saudi Arabia. "Democrats should be
interventionists," Murphy said. "I just think we should be proposing
different tools for intervention than the U.S. Army."]{.underline}

announcement in a speech to the National Rifle Association. The move
comes as pro-gun legislation is largely stalled in Congress and Trump is
imploring the NRA to rally behind his re-election bid. President Barack
Obama signed the pact, which has long been opposed by the NRA, in 2013.
But it has never been ratified by U.S. lawmakers. \_\_\_ 4:20 p.m. [The

Trump that he is asking the Senate to halt ratification of the treaty.
It is the first legally binding treaty to regulate the international
trade in conventional arms and was overwhelmingly approved by the
193-member U.N. General Assembly in April 2013. It has been ratified by
101 countries. Dujarric says the treaty "is the only global instrument

arms trade." Man tosses cellphone, removed from Trump speech He says,
"This is particularly important in present times, when we witness

audience at President Donald Trump's speech to the National Rifle
Association after tossing his cellphone toward the stage. The phone flew
toward one side of the lectern as Trump was approaching from the other
side. The president proceeded with his speech without delay. Witnesses
said the man appeared to be a supporter of the president. \_\_ 1 p.m.
President Donald Trump says the U.S. has decided to withdraw its support
for a treaty regulating the multibillion-dollar global arms trade. It's
the latest example of the Trump administration's dislike of
international pacts. [Trump said Friday that he has decided to revoke
the United States' status as a signatory of the Arms Trade Treaty
regulating international trade in conventional weapons, including small
arms, battle tanks, combat aircraft and warships.]{.underline} He says
America is "rejecting this treaty" and "taking our signature back." [He

[Trump says gun owners should get ready to vote for Republicans. He told
the National Rifle Association]{.underline} [Friday that his political
opponents "want to take away your guns. You better get out there and
vote."]{.underline} He spoke at the gun rights group's annual convention
for the third year in a row. The event comes as longtime observers say
the group is at its weakest moment in memory, due to serious infighting,
financial issues and shifting public sentiment after a series of mass
shootings. Trump said the 2020 presidential and congressional elections
are around the corner. "It seems like it's a long ways away. It's not,"
he said.

#### Trump second term causes extinction -- climate change and global war.

**Starr 19** -- (Paul Starr, professor of sociology and public affairs
at Princeton and a winner of the Pulitzer Prize for General Nonfiction,
"Trump's Second Term",

So far, much of the concern about the long-term effects of Trump's
presidency has centered on his antidemocratic tendencies. But even if we
take those off the table---[even if we assume that Trump continues to be
hemmed in by other parts of the government and by outside institutions,
and that he governs no more effectively than he has until now---the
impact of a second term would be more lasting than that of the
first.]{.underline} In normal politics, the policies adopted by a
president and Congress may zig one way, and those of the next president
and Congress may zag the other. The contending parties take our system's
rules as a given, and fight over what they understand to be reversible
policies and power arrangements. But some situations are not like that;
a zig one way makes it hard to zag back. This is one of those moments.
[After four years as president, Trump will have made at least two
Supreme Court appointments, signed into law tax cuts, and rolled back
federal regulation of the environment and the economy. Whatever you
think of these actions, many of them can probably be offset or entirely
undone in the future. The effects of a full eight years of Trump will be
much more difficult, if not impossible, to undo.]{.underline} Three
areas---[climate change, the risk of a renewed global arms
race]{.underline}, and control of the Supreme Court---[illustrate the
historic significance of the 2020 election.]{.underline} The first two
problems will become much harder to address as time goes on. The third
one stands to remake our constitutional democracy and undermine the
capacity for future change. In short, [the biggest difference between
electing Trump in 2016 and reelecting Trump in 2020 would be
irreversibility. Climate policy is now the most obvious example. For a
long time, even many of the people who acknowledged the reality of
climate change thought of it as a slow process that did not demand
immediate action. But today, amid extreme weather events and worsening
scientific forecasts, the costs of our delay are clearly mounting, as
are the associated dangers. To have a chance at keeping global warming
below 1.5 degrees Celsius---the objective of the Paris climate
agreement---the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change says that by
2030, CO2 emissions must drop some 45 percent from 2010 levels. Instead
of declining, however, they are rising. In his first term, Trump has
announced plans to cancel existing climate reforms, such as higher
fuel-efficiency standards and limits on emissions from new coal-fired
power plants, and he has pledged to pull the United States out of the
Paris Agreement. His reelection would put off a national commitment to
decarbonization until at least the second half of the 2020s, while
encouraging other countries to do nothing as well]{.underline}. And
[change that is delayed becomes more economically and politically
difficult]{.underline}. According to the Global Carbon Project, if
decarbonization had begun globally in 2000, an emissions reduction of
about 2 percent a year would have been sufficient to stay below 2
degrees Celsius of warming. Now it will need to be approximately 5
percent a year. If we wait another decade, it will be about 9 percent.
[In the United States, the economic disruption and popular resistance
sure to arise from such an abrupt transition may be more than our
political system can bear. No one knows, moreover, when the world might
hit irreversible tipping points such as the collapse of the West
Antarctic Ice Sheet, which would likely doom us to a catastrophic
sea-level rise. The 2020 election will also determine whether the U.S.
continues on a course that all but guarantees]{.underline} another kind
of runaway global change---[a stepped-up arms race, and with it a
heightened risk of nuclear accidents and nuclear war. Trump's "America
first" doctrine, attacks on America's alliances, and unilateral
withdrawal from arms-control treaties have made the world far more
dangerous.]{.underline} After pulling the United States out of the Iran
nuclear agreement (in so doing, badly damaging America's reputation as
both an ally and a negotiating partner), [Trump failed to secure from
North Korea anything approaching the Iran deal's terms, leaving Kim Jong
Un not only unchecked but with increased international standing. Many
world leaders are hoping that Trump's presidency is a blip---that he
will lose in 2020, and that his successor will renew America's
commitments to its allies and to the principles of multilateralism and
nonproliferation. If he is reelected, however, several countries may opt
to pursue nuclear weapons, especially those in regions that have relied
on American security guarantees, such as the Middle East and Northeast
Asia.]{.underline} At stake is the global nonproliferation regime that
the United States and other countries have maintained over the past
several decades to persuade nonnuclear powers to stay that way. That
this regime has largely succeeded is a tribute to a combination of
tactics, including U.S. bilateral and alliance-based defense commitments
to nonnuclear countries, punishments and incentives, and pledges by the
U.S. and Russia---as the world's leading nuclear powers---to make
dramatic cuts to their own arsenals. EDMON DE HARO In his first term,
Trump has begun to undermine the nonproliferation regime and dismantle
the remaining arms-control treaties between Washington and Moscow. In
October, he announced that the U.S. would withdraw from the
Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces (INF) Treaty signed in 1987 by Ronald
Reagan and Mikhail Gorbachev. While the Russian violations of the treaty
that Trump cited are inexcusable, he has made no effort to hold Russia
to its obligations---to the contrary, by destroying the treaty, he has
let Russia off the hook. What's more, he has displayed no interest in
extending New START, which since 2011 has limited the strategic nuclear
arsenals of Russia and the United States. If the treaty is allowed to
expire, 2021 will mark the first year since 1972 without a legally
binding agreement in place to control and reduce the deadliest arsenals
ever created. The prospect of a new nuclear arms race is suddenly very
real. [With the end of verifiable limits on American and Russian nuclear
weapons, both countries will lose the right to inspect each other's
arsenal, and will face greater uncertainty about each other's
capabilities and intentions]{.underline}. Already, rhetoric has taken an
ominous turn: After Trump suspended U.S. participation in the INF Treaty
on February 2, Vladimir Putin quickly followed suit and promised a
"symmetrical response" to new American weapons. Trump replied a few days
later in his State of the Union address, threatening to "outspend and
out-innovate all others by far" in weapons development. The treaties
signed by the United States and Russia beginning in the 1980s have
resulted in the elimination of nearly 90 percent of their nuclear
weapons; the end of the Cold War seemed to confirm that those weapons
had limited military utility. Now---as the U.S. and Russia abandon their
commitment to arms control, and Trump's "America first" approach causes
countries such as Japan and Saudi Arabia to question the durability of
U.S. security guarantees---[the stage is being set for more states to go
nuclear and for the U.S. and Russia to ramp up weapons development. This
breathtaking historical reversal would, like global warming, likely feed
on itself, becoming more and more difficult to undo.]{.underline}

VII\. "Go Back to Their Huts" [In office, Donald Trump followed through
on his promise to curb immigration from majority-Muslim
countries]{.underline}. He created a commission to investigate voter
fraud (virtually nonexistent, according to state election officials),
claiming that he would have won the popular vote but for millions of
ballots cast by people in the U.S. illegally. He shut down the
government for 35 days in an attempt to secure funding for a wall on the
U.S.-Mexico border. [He reportedly referred to African countries as
"shithole" nations---asking why the U.S. can't have more immigrants from
Norway instead---and complained that, after seeing America, immigrants
from Nigeria would never "go back to their huts."]{.underline} The
administration favored victims of Hurricane Harvey, which hit Houston,
over those of Hurricane Maria, which hit Puerto Rico, sending three
times as many workers to Houston and approving 23 times as much money
for individual assistance within the first nine days after each
hurricane. SAM NUNBERG: Remember in 2011 he was criticized when he said,
"I've always had a great relationship with the blacks"? I think he just
doesn't speak "politically correct." It's not in his vernacular, or
consciousness. It's generational. It's also probably---not to play
psychiatrist---it's growing up where he grew up, in Queens, New York,
and dealing with union members, dealing in a crime-riddled New York
City. I think it's just the way things were thought of as different
then. TIMOTHY L. O'BRIEN: This is the same debate we have about whether
or not he's a liar. And I get the journalistic need to be really clear
about how we use terms. You know, lying implies volition and knowledge.
But I'm very comfortable saying I think he's got a pathology around
lying. And [when it comes to race, I don't think it's merely using
racial animosities or race-baiting as tools to promote his business. I
think it's a deep-seated reflection of what he thinks about how the
world works.]{.underline} KWAME JACKSON: [America's always trying to
find this gotcha moment that shows Donald Trump is
racist]{.underline}---you know, let's find this one big thing. Let's
look for that one time when he burned a cross in someone's yard so we
can now finally say it. [People refuse to see the bread crumbs that are
already in front of you, leading you to grandma's house.]{.underline}

[Kids]{.underline}, farmers, fishermen, cities, and states [are suing

In 1998, 46 states and the District of Columbia signed on to the largest
civil litigation settlement in US history, the tobacco [Master
Settlement
Agreement](https://publichealthlawcenter.org/sites/default/files/resources/master-settlement-agreement.pdf).
Stunning in its scope and scale, the agreement forced the four largest
tobacco companies to stop advertising to youth, limit lobbying, restrict
product placement in media, and fund anti-smoking campaigns. It also
required them to pay out more than \$206 billion over 25 years. [Tobacco
companies had in previous decades successfully swatted down hundreds of
private lawsuits. But states found an opening by suing companies for the
harm they caused to public health.]{.underline} "This lawsuit is
premised on a simple notion: You caused the health crisis, you pay for
it," said then-Mississippi Attorney General [Michael

said last year from atop a seawall, announcing his state's suit against
companies like Exxon Mobil, Chevron, BP, and Royal Dutch Shell.
["Instead of working to reduce that harm, these companies chose to
conceal the dangers, undermine public support for greenhouse gas
regulation, and engage in massive campaigns to promote the
ever-increasing use of their products and ever-increasing revenues in
their pockets."]{.underline} [With so many lawsuits filed across so many
jurisdictions, the likelihood of a climate case getting to a trial is
growing.]{.underline} Outside the courtroom, [[public
opinion](https://www.vox.com/2019/1/28/18197262/climate-change-poll-public-opinion-carbon-tax)
is starting to shift, with a majority of Americans wanting the
government to address climate change, according to several recent
polls]{.underline}. The hope among the plaintiffs is that one of the
suits could lead to comprehensive action on climate change that the
political process has failed to provide. However, the plaintiffs are in
uncharted legal territory, and opponents say these cases hinge on
radical, unprecedented expansions of existing laws. The litigation also
circumvents the legislative process, which is arguably where climate
change policies should be implemented in the first place. As federal
appeals courts weigh whether some of these lawsuits should be allowed to
go to trial, it's helpful to understand the background of environmental
litigation, the arguments being made, and what they could mean for the
fight against climate change. Here's what you need to know.
Environmental lawsuits have a long history, but climate liability and
climate rights are a new frontier "Litigation has been a crucial
strategy for environmental activism since the '60s and the '70s," said
Sabin, the Yale professor. In fact, we've already seen a successful
lawsuit centering on climate change. The Environmental Protection Agency
was forced to regulate carbon dioxide to fight climate change as the
result of a 2007 Supreme Court decision in a lawsuit, [Massachusetts v.
EPA](https://www.oyez.org/cases/2006/05-1120). It's the most significant
example of a climate change mitigation policy established through the
courts. One of the earliest cases to invoke harm caused by greenhouse
gases dates back to 1986. In the [City of Los Angeles v. National
Highway Traffic Safety
Administration](https://www.eenews.net/climatewire/stories/1060111059/)
lawsuit, the city and environmental organizations challenged NHTSA's
rollback of a vehicle emissions law. An appeals court ruled in favor of
the federal government. But the current wave of litigation is bringing
up new legal questions in the context of climate change for the first
time. [For local governments suing fossil fuel companies, the fight is
over who's on the hook for paying for the damages stemming from rising
average temperatures. In the youth lawsuits, the key issue is whether a
stable climate is a civil right.]{.underline}

working to ensure that our transition to clean energy advances equity
and justice for those communities impacted most by climate change. And
we're partnering with states on the frontlines of our climate fight that

[Climate Policy Can Help Avert Modern Liberalism's \'Doom Loop\'
Liberalism's "doom loop" is inextricable from the global-warming
crisis.]{.underline} What new responsibilities should a rich and liberal
democracy take on in the 21st century? If you ask almost any American
progressive, they will talk about the need to regulate greenhouse-gas
emissions and lessen the blow of climate change. Lately, a growing
number of conservatives have glommed onto another policy. They suggest
that such a democracy should also be pronatalist: It should take
children as a virtue and a public good (even a blessing), and it should
direct its welfare state toward encouraging human reproduction. starting
today. Given that some environmentalists seem to treat low population
growth as just one more variable in the climate equation, the two
policies may seem incompatible. In fact, they support each other; they
may even need each other. Aggressive climate policy is pronatalist.
[I've been thinking about this because two writers have gone back and
forth lately on what they call modern liberalism's "doom loop." Derek
Thompson [identified the idea first, here at The
Atlantic](https://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2017/10/immigration-modern-liberalism/543744/),
describing a three-step process. Step one: Liberal and richer
democracies tend to have lower birth rates and aging populations, which
strains their respective welfare states. Step two: Those same
democracies admit more immigrants, in order to reinforce their welfare
state and beef up their working-age population. But---step three---as an
increasing amount of a state's population becomes foreign-born, its
aging population becomes more xenophobic and less supportive of the same
welfare state. And that "leads to stratification, further discontent and
an authoritarian turn, which presumably slows growth further, etc.,
etc., until liberalism goes kaput,"]{.underline} [writes Ross
Douthat](https://douthat.blogs.nytimes.com/2017/10/25/liberalism-and-the-politics-of-low-fertility/?module=BlogPost-Title&version=Blog%20Main&contentCollection=Opinion&action=Click&pgtype=Blogs&region=Body),
picking up the idea at The New York Times. Part of [what makes the loop
so insidious is that---much like [a plane's real-life death
spiral](https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2017/10/death-spirals/542304/)---a
polity's knee-jerk instinct to escape the loop only reinforces
it.]{.underline} Thompson names the loop but doesn't quite describe a
way out of it, though he suggests that guiding people out of bigotry is
a possible exit in the long term. "The liberal cause," he says,
"requires Americans learning to break the catch-22 of diversity and
equality." Douthat, seizing on that sentence, says that maybe nations
should consider trying to tinker with another variable: [It could also
be that there's a policy mix that would make that combination a little
less of a catch-22, and require less in the way of eliminating the
inherent human bias in favor of one's own posterity in order to succeed.
Maybe, for instance, if you cut immigration rates modestly while also
spending heavily to encourage old-fashioned procreation, you would have
a better chance of getting faster growth while also creating a
socioeconomic environment---youthful, future-oriented, optimistic---that
makes assimilation easier.]{.underline} "[Youthful, future-oriented,
optimistic"---who wouldn't want a country like that?]{.underline} It
even sounds like the United States, once upon a time. How do we get back
there? By addressing the full scope of the problem. Americans have to
talk about climate change---because climate change will simply be
happening in the background of all of this. [If liberalism's doom loop
is one condition of the 21st century, then the accumulating degradation
of Earth's only climate is another. Its political economy is as specific
to this century as the unusually high number of old people kicking
around is. And it specifically informs the issues here in two ways.
First, the warming of the world will set off more waves of mass
migration. No matter how the doom loop churns, global warming will very
likely increase the foreign-born population of the northern and richer
democracies all by itself.]{.underline} The immigration reporter Dara
Lind has argued [that there's a tendency to take diversity's threat to
nationalism for granted, even though racism corrodes democratic
solidarity at least as much as a foreign-born population
does:]{.underline} [I would love to read a defense of nationalism that
takes the threat racism poses to it at least as seriously as the threat
diversity does.]{.underline} The point holds for climate migration as
well. [As I argued last
year](https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2016/10/trump-the-first-demagogue-of-the-anthropocene/504134/),
reducing racism and neutralizing the threat it poses to democratic
solidarity constitutes climate adaptation as much as raising a seawall
or protecting a coastal wetland does. But here Douthat would insert that
racism isn't the only variable at play in the doom loop; there's also
"the inherent human bias in favor of one's own posterity." He proposes
pronatalist policy---that is, incentives for procreation and family
formation---as a solution. I think it's good to have kids; I think
taking care of kids gives rise to responsibility, generosity, and
selflessness among adults and communities; and I agree that the longer
horizons of child-rearing promote a "youthful, future-oriented,
optimistic" politics. I also suspect that pronatalist policy will soon
make for good U.S. electoral politics: By the time of the next
presidential election, the biggest single-age cohort in America---[that
is, my own, the
1991-er](https://www.wsj.com/articles/americas-retailers-have-a-new-target-customer-the-26-year-old-millennial-1507559181)---will
be narrowing in on prime parental age. Perhaps our progeny-concerned
parents could even be converted into a new and coveted bloc. [But if you
want to make American politics more future-oriented, you first need to
fill the climate-shaped hole in our future-oriented-ness. As a polity,
we have little collective vision for the future, and little public
determination to make sure it's a better place to live.]{.underline}
When you talk to people about why they don't want kids, they don't
always talk about their aversion to children or child-rearing; they
often talk about how bleak they think the future will be. [Between the
breakdown of the global liberal order and the ongoing degradation of the
planet's climate, the next few decades don't seem like a particularly
sociable place, for them or their hypothetical children]{.underline}. To
many potential parents, it feels like older folks are pressing down the
accelerator, trying to burn all the gas in the engine before the car
goes careening straight off the side of the canyon.

#### Climate Change disproportionately affects marginalized groups and re-entrenches the logic of militarism

**Baird**, xx-xx-xxxx, (Rachel Baird is..... "The Impact of Climate
Change on Minorities and Indigenous Peoples"
https://minorityrights.org/wp-content/uploads/old-site-downloads/download-524-The-Impact-of-Climate-Change-on-Minorities-and-Indigenous-Peoples.pdf//SR)

[Climate change is attracting ever more attention from the media,
academics, politicians and even businesses, as evidence mounts about its
scale and seriousness, and the speed at which it is affecting the that
benefits all of us]{.underline}. They also underscore the critical role
of states in solving our climate crisis, especially at a time when
politicians in D.C. are letting us down At Earthjustice, we're fighting
the Trump administration's attempts to [gut environmental
protections](https://earthjustice.org/features/erasing-democracy) with
more than 100 lawsuits filed in federal court --- many of which attempt
to protect communities. [But rarely does its impact on minorities and
indigenous groups get a mention, even though they are among the worst
affected. The effects of the changing climate are bad enough in
themselves -- more frequent hurricanes and droughts, burning
temperatures, new plagues of diseases and worse floods, for instance.
But the general failure to recognize and respond to minorities'
resulting problems greatly exacerbates their suffering. Disadvantage and
discrimination affect them at every stage, including in the immediate
aftermath of climate-related disasters and during official planning at
local, national and international levels for coping with the current and
future impacts of climate change.]{.underline} The close relationship of
some indigenous peoples and minorities with their natural environments
makes them especially sensitive to the effects of global warming. [In
some cases, peoples' ways of life and even their very existence are
being threatened by climate change, and by the rapidly increasing
cultivation of biofuels, which are being touted as part of the
'solution'. This briefing sets out some of the evidence on how
minorities and indigenous people are being affected by climate change.
It shows how discrimination against them means that they are not getting
the help they need, or influence over governments' plans for combating
and adapting to climate change.]{.underline} Finally, it highlights some
of the opportunities for change. The briefing uses the term 'minority'
to refer to groups that are normally numerically smaller, and who share
a common religious, ethnic or linguistic identity. Examples are the Roma
across Europe, Dalits and Muslims in India and Afro-descendants in
Colombia. 'Indigenous peoples' refers to groups who have a special
connection with the natural environment and who are often seen as the
'first people' to inhabit a particular territory. Examples include the
Sami of the Arctic and the Miskitu of Nicaragua. When groups working
with minorities were contacted as part of the research for this briefing
paper, it was striking that, in three countries, they were caught up in
weatherrelated crises. In India, the National Campaign on Dalit Human
Rights was urging greater attention to the plight of Dalits, Muslims and
Adivasis in India, following unusually severe monsoon floods in 2007. In
Nicaragua, Oxfam staff were tackling the devastation left by Hurricane
Felix on the Atlantic coast, while in the Czech Republic, staff at the
Roma rights group Life Together feared major floods in the north-east of
the country following three days of rain. In the event, the rivers
carried the water away safely. It is impossible to attribute any single
instance of extreme weather to climate change, so none of these examples
can be blamed on it. However, the world's climate is clearly changing.
As the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) states in its
latest Synthesis report, published in November 2007: 'Warming of the
climate system is unequivocal, as is now evident from observations of
increases in global average air and ocean temperatures, widespread
melting of snow and ice, and rising global average sea level.' 1 In
addition to these relatively gradual changes, climate change also has
sudden impacts, in the form of more weather-related disasters. The toll
of emergencies caused by hurricanes, floods, droughts and other forms of
extreme weather has more than doubled over the last decade, from 175 in
1996 to 391 in 2005, according to the International Federation of the
Red Cross and Red Crescent's World Disasters Report. 2 Mind the gap:
climate change, minorities and indigenous peoples [Despite consulting
with climate change and development specialists within NGOs, academia
and intergovernmental organizations, we failed to find any
English-language research about how global warming is affecting minority
groups and indigenous peoples in different countries around the world.
The only exception to this was the recent Tyndall Centre for Climate
Change conference report on indigenous peoples (but not minorities) and
climate change.3 Where minorities are mentioned in reports on climate
change, it tends to be incidentally, during studies of particular
countries]{.underline}. In addition, some academic, [nongovernmental
organization (NGO) and media reporting of specific disasters has clearly
acknowledged that minority communities have fared worse than
others.]{.underline} Examples are the reporting of the New Orleans
floods which followed Hurricane Katrina in August 2005, and of the
Indian floods in the summer of 2007, in [which African-Americans and
Dalits respectively suffered especially badly.]{.underline}4 Part of the
problem is that climate change research tends to focus on economic
sectors -- water, infrastructure, agriculture, settlements and so on --
rather than human groups, says Rachel Roach, Climate Change Policy
Officer at the development agency Tearfund. 'Often, climate change is
thought of sectorally, in terms of agriculture, water and so on, rather
than in terms of a people, group or livelihood.' 5 This is evident in
major reports on climate change, such as those by the IPCC, as well as
in countries' National Adaptation Programmes of Action. [The recent
Tyndall Centre conference report6 begins by stating that indigenous
peoples 'are only rarely considered in academic, policy and public
discourses on climate change'. However, indigenous peoples have won more
attention than other minorities for the ways in which climate change is
harming them. One reason for this is that indigenous peoples are
relatively well organized at national and international levels, through
organizations that represent them to politicians, bureaucrats and
journalists.]{.underline} The Inuit, who live in the fastmelting Arctic,
have gone so far as to launch a precedentsetting case against the United
States in the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights. It is making
slow, if any, progress, but has greatly increased awareness of the
Inuits' plight. The United Nations Permanent Forum on Indigenous Issues
will further highlight the issue for all indigenous peoples in 2008,
when it holds a session on 'climate change and the stewardship role of
indigenous people: bio-cultural diversity, livelihoods and new
challenges'. In addition to the session, the Forum has also appointed
two of its members to produce a report on the 'impact of climate change
mitigation measures on the territories and lands of indigenous peoples'.
The activism of the indigenous lobby provides lessons for campaigners
for minority rights. They might wonder why -- given the host of
disadvantages their communities face -- they should take on this issue
too. The answer is clear: [not only is global warming changing our world
-- but, as we shall see from the following sections, minorities and
indigenous people are among the worst off at every stage in the climate
change story. Minorities tend to live in places that are worst hit by
the impacts of climate change -- their poverty exacerbates their
vulnerability]{.underline} John Magrath, programme researcher at Oxfam,
says: 'Minorities tend to live in the more marginal areas, exposed
areas, that seem to be seeing more climate changes and are more
susceptible to climate impacts because they have got less, and get less,
from governments.... It is a characteristic of all the studies that I
have seen, that the ethnic communities are the people who suffer most
from climate impacts and are the most vulnerable.'

#### Oops- causes extinction too

**ScienceDaily**, 11-29-20**18**, (\"Climate change risks \'extinction
domino effect\': Loss of animal or plant species to climate change
causes global \'extinction domino effect\',\"
https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2018/11/181129122506.htm//SR)

[New research reveals the extinction of plant or animal species from
extreme environmental change increases the risk of an \'extinction
domino effect\' that could annihilate all life on Earth. This would be
the worst-case scenario of what scientists call \'co-extinctions\',
where an organism dies out because it depends on another doomed
species]{.underline}, with the findings published today in the journal
Scientific Reports. [Think of a plant\'s flower pollinated by only one
species of bee \-- if the bee becomes extinct, so too will the plant
eventually. \"Even the most resilient species will inevitably fall
victim to the synergies among extinction drivers as extreme stresses
drive ecosystems to collapse.\"]{.underline} says lead author Dr
Giovanni Strona of the European Commission\'s Joint Research Centre
based in Ispra in northern Italy. Researchers from Italy and Australia
simulated 2,000 \'virtual earths\' linking animal and plant species.
[Using sophisticated modelling, they subjected the virtual earths to
catastrophic environmental changes that ultimately annihilated all life.
Examples of the kinds of catastrophes they simulated included runaway
global warming, scenarios of \'nuclear winter\' following the detonation
of multiple atomic bombs, and a large asteroid impact.]{.underline}
\"What we were trying to test is whether the variable tolerances to
extreme global heating or cooling by different species are enough to
explain overall extinction rates,\" [\"But because all species are
connected in the web of life, our paper demonstrates that even the most
tolerant species ultimately succumb to extinction when the less-tolerant
species on which they depend disappear.\" \"Failing to take into account
these co-extinctions therefore underestimates the rate and magnitude of
the loss of entire species from events like climate change by up to 10
times,\"]{.underline} says co-author Professor Bradshaw of Flinders
University in South Australia Professor Bradshaw and Dr Strona say that
their virtual scenarios warn humanity not to underestimate the impact of
co-extinctions. [\"Not taking into account this domino effect gives an
unrealistic and exceedingly optimistic perspective about the impact of
future climate change,\" warns Professor Bradshaw. It can be hard to
imagine how the demise of a small animal or plant matters so much, but
the authors argue that tracking species up to total annihilation
demonstrates how the loss of one can amplify the effects of
environmental change on the remainder]{.underline}. \"Another really
important discovery was that in the case of global warming in
particular, the combination of intolerance to heat combined with
co-extinctions mean that 5-6 degrees of average warming globally is
enough to wipe out most life on the planet,\" says Dr Strona. [Professor
Bradshaw further warns that their work shows how climate warming creates
extinction cascades in the worst possible way, when compared to random
extinctions or even from the stresses arising from nuclear
winter.]{.underline}

### 1NC -- HR1 

#### Public opinion is overwhelmingly in favor of HR1 and that's key to pressure Republican lawmakers into making concessions -- solves voter discrimination and corruption

**Nilsen, political reporter for Vox, 1/4** -- (Ella, Vox, 01/04/19,
<https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2018/11/30/18118158/house-democrats-anti-corruption-bill-hr-1-pelosi>)
/ncp-AW (edited for gendered language)

House Democrats will unveil full details of their first bill in the new
Congress on Friday --- [sweeping anti-corruption measures aimed at
stamping out the influence of money in politics and **expanding voting
rights**]{.underline}. This is HR 1, the first thing House Democrats
will tackle now that a new Congress has been sworn in. To be clear, this
legislation has little to no chance of passing the Republican-controlled
Senate or being signed by President Donald Trump. Senate Majority Leader
Mitch McConnell already bluntly stated, "That's not going to go
anywhere." But **[by making anti-corruption their No. 1 priority, House
Democrats are throwing down the gauntlet]{.underline}** for Republicans.
A vast majority of Americans want to get the influence of money out of
politics, and want Congress to pass laws to do so. New polling from the
PAC End Citizens United found [82 percent of all voters and 84 percent
of independents said they support a bill of reforms to tackle
corruption]{.underline}. Given how popular the issue is, and Trump's
multitude of scandals, [it looks bad for Republicans to be the party
opposing campaign finance reform --- **especially going into 2020. "Our
best friend in this debate is the public,"**]{.underline} House Speaker
Nancy Pelosi told reporters recently. "We believe it will have great
support." The issue is being spearheaded by Maryland Rep. John Sarbanes,
a longtime advocate of campaign finance reform who has disavowed
corporate PAC money for years. Sarbanes and other House Democrats have
been working with progressive heavy hitters in the Senate including
Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren, whose own wide-ranging
anti-corruption Senate bill was recently introduced in the House by
Sarbanes and progressive Washington Rep. Pramila Jayapal. He is also
working with Sen. Tom Udall (D-NM) to introduce a companion HR 1 bill in
the Senate, which will likely not even be brought to the floor. Sarbanes
and [Democrats know McConnell is refusing to work with them]{.underline}
on their anti-corruption bill, [and they believe it's good politics for
them.]{.underline} "You could stamp on this thing, 'McConnell rejected
it,' and it would immediately give it more credibility," Sarbanes told
reporters recently. "We built this not for McConnell\...**[this was
built for the public. He's going to get knocked over by where the
sentiment of the country is right now]{.underline}**." What this
anti-corruption bill aims to do HR 1 will be formally introduced later
today by Pelosi, Sarbanes, and chairs of the committees of jurisdiction
for the bill: Reps. Elijah Cummings (D-MD), Zoe Lofgren (D-CA), and
Jerry Nadler (D-NY). The bill will make its way through their committees
in the coming weeks; Sarbanes hopes to have a final floor vote done
later this month or early February. [The bill covers three main planks:
campaign finance reform, strengthening the government's ethics laws, and
expanding voting rights]{.underline}. Here's the important part of each
section. Campaign finance [Public financing of campaigns, powered by
small donations]{.underline}. Under Sarbanes's vision, the federal
government would provide a voluntary 6-1 match for candidates for
president and Congress, which means [for every dollar a candidate raises
from small donations, the federal government would match it six times
over]{.underline}. The maximum small donation that could be matched
would be capped at \$200. "If you give \$100 to a candidate that's
meeting those requirements, then that candidate would get another \$600
coming in behind them," Sarbanes told Vox this summer. "The evidence and
the modeling is that most candidates can do as well or better in terms
of the dollars they raise if they step into this new system." [Support
for a constitutional amendment to end Citizens United. Passing the
DISCLOSE Act]{.underline}, pushed by Rep. David Cicilline and Sen.
Sheldon Whitehouse, both Democrats from Rhode Island. This would
[require Super PACs]{.underline} and "dark money" political
organizations [to make their donors public]{.underline}. [Passing the
Honest Ads Act]{.underline}, championed by Sens. Amy Klobuchar (MN) and
Mark Warner (VA) and introduced by Rep. Derek Kilmer (D-WA) in the
House, which would [require Facebook and Twitter to disclose the source
of money for political ads]{.underline} on their platforms
[and]{.underline} share [how much money was spent]{.underline}.
[Disclosing any political spending by government contractors and slowing
the flow of foreign money]{.underline} into the elections by targeting
shell companies. [Restructuring the F]{.underline}ederal
[E]{.underline}lection [C]{.underline}ommission to have five
commissioners instead of the current four, in order to break political
gridlock. [Prohibiting any coordination between candidates and Super
PACs]{.underline}. Ethics [Requiring the president and v]{.underline}ice
[p]{.underline}resident [to disclose 10 years of]{.underline} ~~his or
her~~ [(their) tax returns]{.underline}. Candidates for president and
vice president must also do the same. [Stopping members of Congress from
using taxpayer money to settle sexual harassment or discrimination
cases]{.underline}. [Giving the Office of Government Ethics]{.underline}
the [power]{.underline} to do more oversight and enforcement and put in
[stricter lobbying registration requirements]{.underline}. These include
more oversight into foreign agents by the Foreign Agents Registration
Act. Creating a new ethical code for the US Supreme Court, ensuring all
branches of government are impacted by the new law. **[Voting
rights]{.underline}** [Creating new national automatic voter
registration]{.underline} that asks voters to opt out, rather than opt
in, ensuring more people will be signed up to vote. [Early voting,
same-day voter registration, and online voter registration]{.underline}
would also be promoted. [Making Election Day a holiday]{.underline} for
federal employees and encouraging private sector businesses to do the
same, [requiring poll workers to provide a week's notice if]{.underline}
poll [sites are changed]{.underline}, and making colleges and
universities a voter registration agency (in addition to the DMV, etc),
among other updates. [Ending partisan gerrymandering]{.underline} in
federal elections and [prohibiting voter roll purging]{.underline}. The
bill would [stop the use of non-forwardable mail]{.underline} being used
as a way to remove voters from rolls. [Beefing up elections
security]{.underline}, including requiring the director of national
intelligence to do regular checks on foreign threats. [Recruiting and
training more poll workers]{.underline} ahead of the 2020 election to
cut down on long lines at the polls. HR 1 is intended to be a large
package, but Sarbanes said in addition to passing it as the first bill,
members will likely break out pieces of it into smaller bills that
individually could get bipartisan support from Republicans in the Senate
--- things including the Honest Ads Act and boosting election security.
"We're seeing more political spending go to the internet and we have
clear evidence that foreign actors tried to influence the election
through the internet," said Kilmer, the Democrat who introduced the
Honest Ads Act in the House. "The last Congress, you saw a committee
hearing grilling the Facebook CEO but \[it\] didn't really do anything
to fix the problem." Although Kilmer believes the Republican Senate
should take HR 1 as a whole package, he's glad to see individual
elements being broken out. "**[The combination of having some \[bills\]
like that plus having a powerful push out of the gate the public
responds to in a positive way creates political pressure]{.underline}**
for Republicans to get on board," Sarbanes told Vox. "They are going to
discover this sort of thing is popular back in their district."
Democrats want to "walk the walk" The anti-corruption reform effort is
nothing new for Sarbanes, who stopped accepting PAC money seven years
ago and once joined a frigid walk in zero-degree weather across part of
New Hampshire to commemorate Doris "Granny D" Haddock, the late activist
who trekked across the entire nation to make a point about campaign
finance reform. The influence of lobbying and money has been entrenched
for years on both sides of the aisle, but Republicans especially have
been in the news for it. Vox's Tara Golshan and Dylan Scott noted a
total of four House Republicans who were embroiled in corruption
scandals before the midterms --- two, Chris Collins and Duncan Hunter,
were reelected despite those scandals. But even though they have a good
foil in House Republicans, Sarbanes has long said his party needs to
undergo a serious reckoning of its own. "Walk the walk, and we've got to
walk it quick," he told Vox. "A lot of \[voters\] don't believe it can
happen because the system is rigged. That's why when you come with a
plan for that, too, it sort of caffeinates everything else. It makes
them feel like, okay, now you're talking." "It's not until you come here
and begin to serve that you understand how woven it is into the fabric
of how Washington operates," Sarbanes continued. The Congress member
compared his own refusal of PAC money to putting on "night-vision
goggles that have you then see how money flows everywhere here."
Democrats know they don't actually have a shot of passing HR 1 through
the Senate, or getting it past the president's desk. But they recognize
[they need to get serious about the issue, even if Republicans
won't]{.underline}. [**"To say to the public,** from this point
forward**, if you give the gavel to lawmakers who are interested in
being accountable to you, this is the kind of change you can expect to
see,"**]{.underline} Sarbanes said. **["If you like this, give us a
gavel in the Senate and give us a pen in the White
House."]{.underline}** Expect to hear this argument well into 2020.

#### The state is [inevitable]{.underline} -- they ignore that even by not engaging the state [it engages us]{.underline} -- outweighs the risk of [co-option]{.underline} and avoids creating a [void]{.underline} that the [right fills]{.underline}

**Choat, 16**

PhD in Political Science at Queen Mary University of London, member of
the Political Studies Association, Senior Lecturer in the School of
Economics, Politics, and History (Simon, "Marxism and anarchism in an
age of neoliberal crisis,"
<http://eprints.kingston.ac.uk/32233/1/Choat-S-3223-AAM.pdf>, dml)

The anarchist critique of Marxist organisational forms is unconvincing,
then, because it does not acknowledge the diversity of Marxist
approaches and it tends towards a theoreticism that sees a linear,
causal, and continuous line from theory to practice. Nonetheless, there
are significant differences of strategy between anarchism and Marxism:
it is just that these are less to do with organisation as such, and are
much more broadly to do with differing attitudes toward politics and the
state. Although [some]{.underline} (though by no means all) anarchists
have supported formal political organisations, with rules, membership
criteria, and even internal discipline (Schmidt and van der Walt 2009:
247-263), they [have]{.underline} traditionally [**rejected any
engagement with the state** -- whether it be **voting**, **demanding
legal rights** or protections, **forming political parties**, or
attempting **the revolutionary seizure of government** -- on the basis
that such engagement **can only end up replicating the oppressive
hierarchies** that they are fighting: either it will lead to **new forms
of dictatorship** and **bureaucracy**]{.underline} (such as developed in
the Soviet Union); [or]{.underline} it will lead to parliamentary
[**reformism** and]{.underline} hence [merely **reinforce existing
structures** and relations of power. If Marxists support]{.underline}
(qualified) [engagement with the state and even the formation of
political parties]{.underline}, however, [it is **not** because they
think that centralised hierarchies are **desirable** or **inevitable**,
but because they begin from a **different understanding of
politics**]{.underline}. They argue that [the]{.underline} anarchist
[abstention from state politics **denies us the most effective means of
political action**: we **disempower ourselves rather than the state**
when we refuse to engage with it. Making demands on the state **does not
necessarily entail an endorsement of the state**, any more than the
demands that are made by employees during a strike are an endorsement of
the employer or of the system of wage-labour]{.underline} (Marx 1988).
Anarchists themselves have at least implicitly recognised the efficacy
of political engagement by occasionally supporting the policies of
certain governments and even participating in elections (Engels 1988;
Franks 2012: 216). More than this, [abstention from state politics is
**not a genuine option**: **whether we like it or not**, we are all
**already involved in state politics**, because we are all **always
already submitted to state power**, **control**, and **oppression**.
Anarchists are concerned that participation in conventional politics
will lead to]{.underline} parliamentary [reformism. But this concern is
itself ultimately **premised on a tacit acceptance of the
liberal-parliamentary understanding of politics**: to claim that we can
safely repudiate state politics simply by refusing ever to enter a
polling booth **is to assume that 'the state' stops at the door of
Parliament**]{.underline}. Marxists, in contrast, have argued that the
state apparatus includes educational institutions, the media, churches,
the family, and so on (e.g. Althusser 1971): [simply in going about our
daily lives we are **all therefore implicated in state politics**. Given
our necessary involvement within politics, the question is **not whether
we engage with it**, but **how we do so**]{.underline}; even libertarian
Marxists like Holloway argue that engagement with the state is
inevitable (Holloway 2005: 40). In contrast, [the]{.underline} anarchist
[recommendation of disengagement from the state **risks a politics of
withdrawal** and **isolation**]{.underline}. There are two related
reasons why under our current conditions in particular [the]{.underline}
Marxist [willingness to engage in state politics is
preferable]{.underline} to an anarchist position. The first is the
dominance of neoliberalism today. [Given the strength of neoliberalism
since the crisis that it created, there is a **strong case** for a
**certain pragmatism** in our response]{.underline}. A danger of the
[prefigurative politics]{.underline} favoured by anarchists is that it
[**dogmatically dictates** an **a priori exclusion** of certain forms of
political action]{.underline}. For Marxists, on the other hand,
[political strategies must be decided **according to particular
conditions** and **within a certain context**]{.underline}. In a context
in which private companies are increasingly undertaking tasks previously
performed by the state, [the active defence of state services and
institutions]{.underline} can be viewed as a radical position to adopt:
defending welfare provision, public pensions, universal healthcare, and
free higher education [should be seen **not as a reformist compromise**
with the existing order but as **safeguarding the gains of class
struggle** against capitalist processes of accumulation by
dispossession.]{.underline} This leads to the second reason for doubting
the refusal of state politics as a viable tactic under current
conditions, which concerns the specific role of the state under
neoliberalism. [The anti-state politics of anarchism may have made sense
during eras in which the state could plausibly be presented as the main
threat to freedom]{.underline} and equality: during the period of
nation-building and imperialistic expansion in the mid- to late-19th
century, of the rise of fascism in the early-20th century, or even of
the development of welfare capitalism after WWII. But [it has **far less
purchase** in an era in which neoliberalism, as both the official
ideology and a form of everyday common sense, is
anti-statist.]{.underline} Put simply, [the **attack on state power too
easily echoes the rhetoric of neoliberalism itself**]{.underline}
(Taylor 2013: 735). [When government actors themselves are **explicitly
endorsing the retreat of the state**, then]{.underline} anarchist
[attacks on state power have **limited efficacy** either as a tactical
call to arms or as a convincing analysis of our present
conjuncture]{.underline}. In practice, of course, it is true that
neoliberalism has not dissolved state power. But nor has the relation
between state and capital remained the same under neoliberalism, such
that our analyses, strategies, or rhetoric need not alter. The nature of
this relationship between state and capital will be examined in the next
section.

#### Anti-militarist movements have [empirically]{.underline} disconnected the left from political reality -- critiques of imperialism only [trap us in a mirror]{.underline}

**Gitlin, professor of journalism and sociology and chair of the Ph.D.
program in Commuications at Columbia University, 2005 --** (Todd, *The
Intellectuals and the Flag*, 2005,
http://www.ciaonet.org.proxy1.cl.msu.edu/book/git01/git01_05.pdf)

From the late New Left point of view, then, [patriotism]{.underline}
meant obscuring the whole grisly truth of the United States. It couldn't
help [spilling over into what Orwell thought was the harsh, dangerous,
and distinct phenomenon of nationalism]{.underline}, with its aggressive
edge and its implication of superiority. Scrub up patriotism as you
will, and nationalism, as Schaar put it, remained "patriotism's bloody
brother."3 **[Was Orwell's distinction not, in the end, a distinction
without a difference]{.underline}**? [Didn't his
patriotism]{.underline}, while refusing aggressiveness, [still insist
that the nation he affirmed was "the best in the world"?]{.underline}
What if there was more than one feature of the American way of life that
you did not believe to be "the best in the world"---the national
bravado, the overreach of the marketplace. Patriotism might well be the
door through which you marched with the rest of the conformists to the
beat of the national anthem. Facing these realities, **[all the left
could do was criticize empire]{.underline}** and, on the positive side,
unearth and cultivate righteous traditions. The much-mocked "political
correctness" of the next academic generations was a consolation prize.
[We might have lost politics but we won a lot of the
textbooks.]{.underline} **[The tragedy of the left is that, having
achieved an unprecedented victory in helping stop an appalling war, it
then proceeded to commit suicide.]{.underline}** [The left helped force
the United States out of Vietnam,]{.underline} where the country had no
constructive work to do---either for Vietnam or for itself---[but did so
at the cost of disconnecting itself from the nation.]{.underline} Most
U.S. intellectuals substituted the pleasures of condemnation for the
pursuit of improvement. [The orthodoxy was that "the system" precluded
reform]{.underline}---**[never mind that the antiwar movement had
already demonstrated that reform was possible.]{.underline}** Human
rights, feminism, environmentalism--- these [worldwide
initiatives]{.underline}, American in their inception, flowing not from
the American Establishment but from our own American movements, [were
noises off, not center stage. They were outsider tastes, the stuff of
protest, not national features, the real stuff]{.underline}. Thus when,
in the nineties, the Clinton administration finally mobilized armed
force in behalf of Bosnia and then Kosovo against Milosevic's genocidal
Serbia, **[the hard left only could smell imperial motives, maintaining
that democratic, antigenocidal intentions added up to a paper-thin
mask]{.underline}**. In short, [if the United States seemed
fundamentally trapped in militarist imperialism, its opposition was
trapped in the mirror]{.underline}- image opposite. By the seventies the
outsider stance had become second nature. Even those who had entered the
sixties in diapers came to maturity thinking patriotism a threat or a
bad joke. But [anti-Americanism was, and remains, a mood and a
metaphysics more than a politics]{.underline}. **[It cannot help but see
practical politics as an illusion]{.underline}**, entangled as it is and
must be with a system fatally flawed by original sin. Viewing the
ongoing politics of the Americans as contemptibly shallow and
compromised, [the demonological attitude naturally rules out patriotic
attachment]{.underline} to those very Americans. [Marooned]{.underline}
(often self-marooned) [on university campuses, exiled in left-wing media
and other cultural outposts]{.underline}---all told, an archipelago of
bitterness---what sealed itself off in the postsixties decades was what
Richard Rorty has called "**[a spectatorial, disgusted, mocking Left
rather than a Left which dreams of achieving our

#### Lack of voting reform causes a 2020 Trump victory

**Ford, staff writer at *The New Republic*, 18** -- (Matt, *The New
Republic*, 11-09-18, "The 2020 Election Could Come Down to Voter
Suppression,
<https://newrepublic.com/article/152141/2020-election-come-voter-suppression>)
/ncp-AW

Donald [Trump]{.underline}'s 2016 presidential campaign scrambled the
electoral map, as he [won several states that some considered reliably,
even irrevocably, blue]{.underline}. This week's midterms, blue wave or
not, reversed some of those unexpected gains. While Republican
candidates held the line in Ohio and apparently squeaked out narrow
victories in Florida, voters turned leftward in three key states in the
Upper Midwest. [Some political observers now see a map that's favorable
to Democrats]{.underline} as they seek to topple Trump in two years. "If
Trump has lost the benefit of the doubt from voters in Pennsylvania,
Wisconsin and Michigan, he may not have so much of an Electoral College
advantage in 2020," election guru Nate Silver wrote on Thursday. New
York magazine's Gabriel Debenedetti pointed to [resounding Democratic
victories in some former purple states as a positive sign]{.underline}
for Democrats: "It's now hard to see how Virginia or Colorado,
traditional swing states, begin 2020 anywhere but in the blue column,
with Nevada leaning that way, too." **[What's striking about both
analyses]{.underline}**, each written by sharp and well-informed
observers, **[is the absence of discussion about the potential impact of
voter suppression.]{.underline}** While Americans will decide which
presidential candidate to support based on the economy, immigration, and
other issues, it's increasingly clear that [state election laws and
rules will govern whether they can translate those decisions into actual
votes]{.underline}. From Ohio to Georgia, Republicans have sought to
constrain the electorate to their benefit. If they do so in several key
states over the next two years, **[it may well decide the 2020
election]{.underline}**. Trump loves to talk about his Electoral College
landslide, partly because it obscures his shellacking in the national
popular vote and partly because it was a genuinely impressive victory.
[His path to the White House effectively ran through five
states]{.underline}---Florida, Michigan, Ohio, Pennsylvania, and
Wisconsin---though he did not need to win them all. Pennsylvania,
Florida, and just one more would have sufficed. Clinton, meanwhile,
could have lost Florida and still won, narrowly, by taking Pennsylvania
and Ohio. Instead, [Trump won all five]{.underline} states and sailed
into the White House with 306 electoral votes. [Can he do it again in
2020?]{.underline} Trump has defied the odds before, but running the
board in the Great Lakes region will be even harder the second time
around. In 2016, Trump won by extraordinary close margins in three of
the five key states: 10,704 votes in Michigan, 44,292 votes in
Pennsylvania, and 22,748 votes in Wisconsin. Thanks to America's
peculiar system, [a presidential election in which 138 million people
cast their ballots came down to fewer than 78,000 voters]{.underline} in
three states. There's evidence that **[voter-suppression laws may have
helped tip the balance towards Trump]{.underline}**. Wisconsin Governor
Scott Walker, who was ousted by voters on Tuesday, oversaw a series of
[changes]{.underline} that [structurally tilted]{.underline} the state's
[electoral contests toward Republicans]{.underline}. Shortly after
taking power in 2011, Walker and state Republican leaders oversaw a
gerrymandering process that ensured the GOP could win two-thirds of the
state legislature's seats even if they only won a majority of the total
vote. He also signed a bill in 2015 that dismantled the state's
nonpartisan ethics and elections commission and replaced it with two
commissions staffed by political appointees. Walker's most decisive
legislation was a voter ID law passed in 2011, which required voters to
present a government-issued photo identification when casting a ballot.
Federal judges blocked the law from going into effect for years, citing
the disproportionate impact it would have on black voters who often
lacked the necessary IDs. When it went into force during the 2016
election, however, **[it appeared to have a critical
impact]{.underline}**, as Mother Jones' Ari Berman reported: After the
election, [registered voters]{.underline} in Milwaukee County and
Madison's Dane County were surveyed about why they didn't cast a ballot.
[Eleven percent cited the voter ID law]{.underline} and said they didn't
have an acceptable ID; of those, [more than half said the law was the
"main reason" they didn't vote]{.underline}\.... \[T\]hat finding
implies that between 12,000 and 23,000 registered voters in Madison and
Milwaukee---and as many as [45,000 statewide---were deterred from voting
by the ID law]{.underline}. In two of the five key states, voting rights
are relatively secure. Republicans in Pennsylvania passed a voter ID law
in 2012, but state judges blocked its implementation two years later.
(The state's supreme court also won a showdown with state GOP lawmakers,
striking down gerrymandered maps in favor of more balanced ones earlier
this year.) Voters in Michigan, meanwhile, passed a measure on Tuesday
that will enact automatic voter registration, same-day voter
registration, and no-excuse absentee ballots. Democratic control of the
state governorships in both states makes it unlikely that Republicans
will pass new restrictions before 2020. The same can't be said for the
two major perennial swing states on the list. [Ohio Republicans won
big]{.underline} on Tuesday at all levels, save for a U.S. Senate seat
successfully defended by incumbent Democrat Sherrod Brown. The defeats
of gubernatorial contender Richard Cordray and secretary of state
candidate Kathleen Clyde leave Democrats with scant influence over the
state's election laws headed into 2020. Clyde's loss in particular is
stinging: As a state lawmaker, she championed reforms like automatic
voter registration and opposed Republican efforts to impose new
restrictions. Ohio has a reputation for stringent measures aimed at its
own electorate. Earlier this year, the Supreme Court narrowly upheld
[Ohio]{.underline} Secretary of State Jon Husted's controversial purge
of the state's voter rolls. The state [purged more than two million
voters]{.underline} from its rolls between 2011 and 2016, removing
voters who had died or moved as well as thousands who had simply not
cast a ballot in recent elections and failed to return a notice. Ohio
lawmakers also passed strict voter ID laws, which the courts blocked,
and sharply cut early voting access, which the courts didn't. [In
Florida]{.underline}, where Republicans have controlled the levers of
power for a quarter-century, [restrictive voting laws are a persistent
threat]{.underline}. In 2012, under Governor Rick Scott, state officials
brawled with the federal government over a campaign to remove suspected
noncitizens from the state's voter rolls by using flawed data that
disproportionately targeted nonwhite voters. He imposed new barriers on
Floridians who sought to regain their voting rights after completing
their sentences---changes that favored white and Republican applicants
over those from other backgrounds. In 2011, he signed a controversial
law that cut early voting days in half and made it harder for
third-party groups to register new voters. Will Republican
governor-elect Ron DeSantis, assuming he survives a potential recount,
pick up where Scott left off? [Republicans often justify strict voter
laws by pointing to the illusory threat of voter fraud. In many cases,
however, we know that the real motives are more sinister.]{.underline}
Former Florida GOP officials, including former Governor Charlie Crist
and former party chairman Jim Greer, admitted to the Palm Beach Post in
2012 that state lawmakers used voter fraud as an excuse to pass laws
that would make it harder for Democratic voters to cast a ballot.
Republican officials elsewhere have given up the game from time to time:
The leader of Pennsylvania's state House predicted in 2012 that the
state's voter ID law would help Mitt Romney win there over Barack Obama,
while Wisconsin Attorney General Brad Schimel openly credited their
version with electing Trump in 2016. [In a healthy democracy, there
would be no need to worry about whether the 2020 election will reflect
the will of the American people]{.underline}. Thanks to the Supreme
Court's recent aversion to protecting voting rights, and a decade of
manipulation by state GOP officials, **[that basic principle can't be
guaranteed]{.underline}**. One party is trying to win elections, and the
other is trying to make winning impossible for anyone else.

#### Trump victory in 2020 exacerbates the practice of [social exclusion]{.underline} which includes mass incarceration, employment and housing discrimination, xenophobia, Islamophobia, environmental racism, and welfare cuts

**Austin, former first Director of the Economic Policy Institute's
Program on Race, Ethnicity, and the Economy, 18** -- (Algernon, Demos,
06-15-18, "Social Exclusion: Black People Have Everything to Lose Under
Trump,"
https://www.demos.org/research/social-exclusion-black-people-have-everything-lose-under-trump)

"Juneteenth"---June 19th---is celebrated by many African Americans as
"Independence Day." On June 19, 1865, the Union Army reached Texas, the
last corner of the former Confederate states, and announced the end of
slavery. While on July 4, 1776 most black Americans were enslaved, on
June 19, 1865 they were all officially free. Juneteenth is normally a
time for rejoicing, but this year, Demos has chosen to consider the
[rights, opportunities, and commitments to racial redress that black
people are losing because of the Trump administration]{.underline}. (Of
course, numerous communities, including all of the American working
class, are being harmed by Trump administration policies, but for
Juneteenth we are focusing on the impact on African Americans.)
Repeatedly during his 2016 presidential campaign, Donald [Trump appealed
to black voters by asking, "What do you have to lose?"]{.underline} A
year and a half into the Trump administration, [we have enough evidence
to answer the question definitively: **everything**]{.underline}. **[In
nearly every major federal agency, the Trump administration has pursued
policies harmful to black people.]{.underline}** Here, we highlight some
of the more egregious instances. The discussion below also illustrates
[the practice of social exclusion]{.underline} by the Trump
administration. As Connie M. Razza states, "Social exclusion is [a set
of decisions and actions" by the "economically and politically powerful"
to "\[deploy\] white supremacist and racist ideas to further concentrate
their wealth and power. They have deputized others---including people
who are not white---to enforce the social exclusion of black people
through simple and seemingly individual acts, as well as through
sweeping rules."]{.underline}1 While the Trump administration has fanned
the flames of xenophobia, Islamophobia, and racism, convincing many
white, Christian Americans that they need to fear immigrants, Muslims,
and African Americans,2 the richest 1 percent of Americans continue to
amass wealth at a rapid pace.3 **[Ramping Up Mass Incarceration and
Suppressing Civil Rights]{.underline}** It is better for families,
communities, and society as a whole that we use incarceration
judiciously, since incarceration reduces the ability of a person to be a
productive citizen. After decades of racially biased mass incarceration
policies,4 the Obama administration had begun to move away from policies
that would incarcerate non-violent offenders and that would
disproportionately harm African Americans. The Trump administration has
reversed many of these approaches and [promises to ramp up policies that
would lead to the mass incarceration of black people]{.underline}.
Attorney General Jeff Sessions is doubling down on the [failed war on
drugs]{.underline}. He has instructed federal prosecutors to pursue
mandatory minimum sentences for low-level, non-violent drug offenses and
pushed them to pursue marijuana cases in states that have legalized the
drug.5 Sessions' Department of Justice (DOJ) has reversed policies to
prevent people from being jailed or imprisoned simply because they are
poor, 6 and opposed sentencing reforms that would reserve the harshest
punishments for the most dangerous criminals.7 The [Civil Rights
Division]{.underline} of the Department of Justice, meanwhile, [has gone
from protecting civil rights to assaulting them]{.underline}. On voting
rights, the Division now [supports unlawful voter purges]{.underline} in
violation of the National Voter Registration Act.8 Sessions' DOJ has
signaled that it [may sue states to coerce them into purging more
voters]{.underline}.9 In education, DOJ [launched an investigation of
Harvard]{.underline} for its affirmative action policy 10---even though
the Supreme Court ruled in 2016 that race can be one factor of many to
ensure diversity in colleges. And DOJ proposed a budget that would
defund the Community Relations Service, an office created by the Civil
Rights Act of 1964 to help reduce racial tensions around the country.11
Troublingly, Sessions' DOJ has been [actively hostile to]{.underline}
the [police reform]{.underline} mandate Congress gave it in 1994. In
April 2017, DOJ tried unsuccessfully to back out of a consent decree to
reform the Baltimore Police Department---an agreement that the city's
mayor and police chief welcomed. 12 The Attorney General also initiated
a review of all "existing or contemplated consent decrees." 13 DOJ
abandoned its efforts in Chicago, where a 13-month investigation found
"a culture in which officers expect to use force and not be questioned
about the need for or propriety of that use." 14 In addition, the agency
abruptly transformed its Community Oriented Policing Services'
Collaborative Reform process for police departments, withholding
recommendations from baffled city officials who had been counting on
receiving them.15 Jeff Sessions' DOJ is [working to roll back all of the
criminal justice, voting rights, and police-reform advances made in
recent decades]{.underline}. **[Failing to Address the Black Economic
Recession]{.underline}** Donald Trump has celebrated the historically
low black unemployment rate.16 But he has failed to mention that the
strong decline in the black unemployment rate began during the Obama
administration in 2011, years before he entered office.17 More
importantly, since the 1960s, [the black unemployment rate has been
twice the white unemployment rate]{.underline},18 and it continues to be
so today. If the white unemployment rate were where the black
unemployment rate is today, no one would be celebrating. The level of
unemployment black people are experiencing today is **[typical of what
whites experience as a result of a recession.]{.underline}**19 During
recessions, policymakers enact economic stimulus measures to reduce
unemployment. If Donald Trump were to unveil a realistic plan to create
a million jobs for black workers---what is needed to create full
employment for black Americans---then there would be a reason to
celebrate.20 **[Taking Money Away from Black Workers]{.underline}**
Recent research indicates that [we are making no progress in combatting
anti-black racial discrimination in the labor market]{.underline}.21
"**[Black-white wage gaps are larger today than they were in
1979]{.underline}**," reports the Economic Policy Institute, and, "Wage
gaps are growing [primarily because of discrimination]{.underline}."22
Instead of working against these trends, the [Trump]{.underline}
administration [is striving to make it easier for employers to
discriminate against black workers]{.underline}. The administration has
suspended a rule from the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission that
would have compelled large companies to report confidentially
information about what they pay their employees by job category, sex,
race, and ethnicity. Collecting the data would have enabled employers to
identify and address discriminatory pay practices, which continue to
suppress the pay of African-American workers. By halting data
collection, the administration discarded an important tool to address
these growing disparities. The Trump Department of Labor has cost
African-American workers hundreds of millions of dollars. The Trump
administration refused to defend in court the Obama administration's
rule on overtime pay. The overtime pay rule would have benefitted 1.5
million black workers, nearly a third of all African Americans who are
paid a salary.23 Had the rule gone into effect, covered workers would
either have been paid more for working overtime or would have worked
fewer hours for the same salary they currently earn. Yet because the
Trump administration chose not to fight for the rule, working people of
all races are losing out on an estimated \$1.2 billion per year.24 In
addition to rolling back Obama-era rules, Trump's Department of Labor
promotes new regulations that harm African-American workers. For
example, the administration [proposed a rule that would enable
restaurants and other businesses that employ tipped workers to legally
appropriate the tips]{.underline} paid to their workers. The rule would
allow employers to pocket an estimated \$480 million a year in tips from
black workers alone.25 The Department of Labor suppressed its own data
finding that the rule change would cost working people billions of
dollars.26 **[Workers and their advocates mobilized against the proposal
and succeeded in pressuring Congress to protect workers' tips through
legislation.]{.underline}**27 Each black worker cheated out of the
minimum wage loses approximately \$2,900 a year. Additionally, the
president [repealed an executive order that required businesses that
profit from federal contracts to demonstrate that they follow laws on
worker pay and benefits]{.underline}.29 African Americans have decades
of labor market advances to lose under the Trump administration. Ending
Protection from Predatory Lenders In the aftermath of the 2008 financial
crisis that devastated African-American wealth, Congress established the
Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) to guarantee basic standards
of fairness for consumer financial products and services such as
mortgages, credit cards, car loans, checking accounts, debt collection,
and student loans. Since 2011, the CFPB has won nearly \$12 billion
dollars for consumers cheated by the financial industry, successfully
holding big banks and other financial companies accountable for
predatory practices that strip wealth from black communities.30 Yet the
Trump administration has worked to weaken the agency, appointing an
acting director, Mick Mulvaney, who is hostile to the agency's core
mission (and is simultaneously heading another government agency) and
proposing that Congress withdraw the agency's independent funding and
much of its regulatory authority.31 In one particularly brazen move, the
administration stripped enforcement powers from the CFPB's Office of
Fair Lending and Equal Opportunity, which had played a key role in the
agency's civil rights work, winning hundreds of millions of dollars for
African-American consumers harmed by discriminatory lending.32 Under the
Trump administration, the CFPB has rolled back a range of rules that
protect African-American consumers and communities from abusive and
discriminatory lending. For example, the Trump CFPB has dropped cases
and halted rules that would have reined in payday lenders that prey on
black communities with interest rates exceeding 400 percent to consumers
who are largely excluded from opportunities to access fair credit and
accrue wealth.33 Under Trump, the agency also delayed its rules on
prepaid cards,34 preparing to weaken a regulation that would have
curtailed abusive fees and interest rates and established key
protections against fraud, unauthorized charges, and errors for the 2.9
million African-American consumers who rely on prepaid cards for
financial transactions.35 In another move, the president signed
legislation eliminating the CFPB's forced arbitration rule, meaning that
consumers who are illegally discriminated against by a financial
services companies can be prohibited from joining together to hold
companies accountable in court, and will instead be bound by an
arbitration process stacked in favor of the company.36 African American
consumers are losing their protector in the federal government. Helping
Predatory For-Profit Colleges Rip Off Black Students The Obama
administration sought to rein in colleges that loaded up students with
debt without providing them any value in the labor market. His
administration also worked to provide loan forgiveness to students who
were deceived into enrolling in, and borrowing thousands of dollars
from, schools that eventually collapsed (such as ITT Tech and Corinthian
Colleges). The Trump administration is reversing these protections and
making ripping off low-income students of color easier for predatory
for-profit colleges. Betsy DeVos's Department of Education has weakened
a critical consumer protection known as the Borrower Defense rule,
designed to help student loan borrowers seek forgiveness when they have
been defrauded by predatory colleges.37 The Department of Education has
also delayed and attempted to rewrite a rule known as Gainful
Employment, which was put in place to prevent unscrupulous career
colleges from receiving federal funding.38 These rules were originally
designed to restrain the worst actors among for-profit colleges and
universities, which account for an outsized share of student loan
delinquencies and defaults and often explicitly target students of
color. And in its budget, the Trump administration has proposed cuts to
the Department of Education's Office of Civil Rights.39 In education as
in lending, the Trump administration is working to make it easier for
bad financial actors to prey on the African American community.
**[Ignoring the Affordable Housing Crisis and Segregation]{.underline}**
Although [black people]{.underline} make up only 12 percent of the total
population, they [make up 41 percent the homeless
population]{.underline}.40 While it is generally recommended that
families spend no more than 30 percent of their income on housing, more
than half of black renters spend above this percentage (and most black
households are renters). [Nearly a third of black renters spend more
than 50 percent of their income on rent]{.underline}.41 Additionally,
the United States currently has a [shortage of over 7 million affordable
rental homes]{.underline}.42 In spite of these stark facts, Trump's
Department of Housing and Urban Development has only worked to make
finding affordable housing more difficult for low-income families. Most
recently, [HUD has been considering tripling the rents of poor
tenants]{.underline} in public housing.43HUD also has [weakened its
commitment to fighting racial discrimination]{.underline} in housing
[and to fighting housing segregation]{.underline}.44These policy changes
position HUD to be responsible if black homelessness increases**[.
Starving Poor Families]{.underline}** In its budgets, the Trump
administration has proposed [deep cuts (]{.underline}totaling over \$200
billion over 10 years) [to]{.underline} the Supplementary Nutrition
Assistance Program ([SNAP]{.underline}), as well as cuts to the Special
Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children
([WIC]{.underline}).45 **[Over 4 in 10 WIC recipients are people of
color.]{.underline}**46 The administration has also proposed to
[reorient the program so that SNAP chooses and sends recipients food,
robbing families of the ability to shop for food on their own, further
stigmatizing recipients and perpetuating dangerous stereotypes that poor
Americans are unable to make beneficial decisions for themselves or
their families]{.underline}.47 As with other areas of public assistance
programs, the Trump administration has also begun the process to enable
states to add work requirements to the food stamp program in areas that
have had consistently high unemployment.48 Proposals to restructure SNAP
would [disproportionately impact the recently incarcerated, those with
mental illness, and teenagers aging out of foster youth
programs]{.underline}. The Administration has [also considered proposals
to drug-test SNAP recipients]{.underline}, adding a costly layer of
bureaucracy to the SNAP program and potentially chilling the ability of
people to achieve food security.49 [These policies will likely increase
hunger in black America]{.underline}. **[Worsening the Health of Black
Communities]{.underline}** Since Trump's election, his administration
has been [dismantling the power of the]{.underline} Environmental
Protection Agency ([EPA]{.underline}) to regulate polluting industries
and protect people's health. Environmental deregulation
[disproportionately harms African Americans]{.underline}, who are
already more exposed to pollution due to a long history of racially
discriminatory policies. For example, black Americans are 1.54 times
more likely to be exposed to pollution particles associated with heart
and lung disease than the overall population.50 More than 1 million
African Americans live within a half mile of existing natural gas
facilities and experience elevated risk of cancer due to toxic emissions
from natural gas development. Under the leadership of Scott Pruitt, the
agency has stalled, weakened, or retracted regulations across multiple
polluting sectors, including the power sector, chemicals manufacturing,
the oil and gas sector, and transportation. The Trump EPA's attacks on
environmental regulation are attacks on the health and safety of black
communities across the country. Homeland Insecurity for Black Immigrants
and Black Muslims **[Xenophobia and Islamophobia are also black
issues]{.underline}**. Ten percent of the black population in America is
foreign-born and as much as an additional 6 percent identify with
countries such as Haiti and Nigeria although they were not born there.51
One-fifth of American Muslims are African American.52 The xenophobia and
Islamophobia expressed by the Trump administration directly affects the
black population. The Trump administration's Department of Homeland
Security ([DHS) threatens the security of black people]{.underline}.
Rather than continue the Obama administration policy of focusing on
people convicted of violent crimes for deportation, Trump's DHS is
[deporting individuals who have been productive members of American
society for many years]{.underline}.53 Additionally, DHS policies are
increasingly [tearing families apart]{.underline} because some family
members are authorized and some do not have documents.54 During the
presidential campaign, Trump demanded a "total and complete shutdown of
Muslims entering the United States." It is not entirely surprising
therefore that Trump's DHS has pursued [an "extreme
vetting"]{.underline} policy following the president's call for stronger
screening and immigration restrictions for individuals from several
majority-Muslim countries.55 The Congressional Black Caucus warns that
"extreme vetting" [goes hand-in-hand with unconstitutional targeting of
African American communities]{.underline}, including through continued
discriminatory surveillance.56 DHS also terminated a program created
after Hurricane Matthew to afford visas to Haitian workers. This
occurred just days after Trump reportedly referred to Haiti and African
countries as "s\*\*\*hole countries."57 Although [white supremacist
terrorism]{.underline} is a greater threat to the country---and
specifically to black Americans---than Islamist terrorism,58 the Trump
administration largely ignores the former and engages in hyperbole and
distortion around the latter.59 Not only is the Trump administration
[lax on policing, preventing, and condemning white supremacist
terrorism]{.underline}, Trump and his policies actually encourage white
supremacist terrorism. A recent analysis of anti-Muslim hate found a
[dramatic rise in anti-Muslim violence and hate speech]{.underline}
since the election of Donald Trump. The study finds that 20 percent of
people involved in documented instances of hate violence "referenced
Trump, a Trump policy, or a Trump slogan."60 **[Here we see a clear
example of social exclusion at work]{.underline}**. As Razza states, the
processes of social exclusion ["\[draw\] the lines of who belongs---in
the broad national community and in very particular places---and how
they belong there. It deliberately deploys racist ideas to justify and
naturalize ... economic disadvantage, democratic disqualification, and
even further social deprivation---in order to distract the public from
who is responsible for inequality]{.underline}."61 While the individuals
attacking Muslims are conjuring up nightmarish fantasies about Muslims
with instigation from the Trump administration, they are not paying
attention to how they are actually being harmed by the administration's
policies favoring billionaires. The Trump Administration Harms African
Americans The Trump administration's policies hurt African Americans.
Sometimes the harm is because of indifference to the plight of black
people, sometimes because the policies are designed to hurt the American
working class and to help Wall Street, and sometimes because they seem
designed specifically to harm African Americans. Much of the work of the
Justice Department falls in this last category. On this Juneteenth, it
is appropriate to remember the history of the black freedom struggle,
because the future of health, safety, and prosperity of black America
depends on the commitment of people to join in and continue that
struggle.

#### Independently, re-election collapses the liberal order and causes global war 

**Rosendorf, Associate Professor of International Relations at New
Mexico State University, Ph.D Harvard University, 17 --** (Neal, CPD
Blog, 02-27-17, "ÜBERMAN AMERICA: THE SINISTER SOFT POWER OF TRUMP'S
FOREIGN POLICY",
https://uscpublicdiplomacy.org/blog/%C3%BCberman-america-sinister-soft-power-trump%E2%80%99s-foreign-policy)

Hence [soft power, undergirded by American values, has]{.underline}
correctly [been seen as a preponderantly positive force in
**i**nternational **r**elations, in which transparent, free-market,
representative democracies that are open to the world have a baked-in
advantage over repressive autocratic regimes]{.underline}. But [what
happens if the U.S. becomes one of the world\'s leading bad guys? Can
the U.S. still maintain soft power if it is extolling hard-edged
nationalism and xenophobia, **disdaining longstanding alliances** and
**fomenting the breakup of the entire post-World War II system** that
America put in place seven decades ago?]{.underline} What would it look
like? Who would it attract? And where will it take the world? In fact,
although a number of prominent figures have warned against the American
abdication of liberal world order leadership and the related erosion, or
even the end, of American soft power, I would argue that [in hewing to
the Trump foreign policy line the US will in fact continue to maintain a
considerable "ability to shape the preferences of others".]{.underline}
[But it won't be via]{.underline} the sort of [attraction]{.underline},
persuasion, ideas and ideals that analysts and policy formulators weaned
on postwar bipartisan consensus U.S. internationalism (this writer
included) will be remotely comfortable with, nor will they (we)
celebrate the sort of leaders, activists and publics who respond
positively to this version of American soft power. They (we) won't like
the results, to put it exceedingly mildly. [With]{.underline} the
[Trump]{.underline} administration violently casting off U.S. fealty to
such watchwords of the exceptionalist American faith as "Life, Liberty,
and the pursuit of Happiness," "the last best hope of earth," "Give me
your tired, your poor, Your huddled masses yearning to breathe free," or
"a tall, proud city built on rocks stronger than oceans, windswept,
God-blessed, and teeming with people of all kinds living in harmony and
peace," [it can be hard to imagine that the U.S. could still hold soft
power]{.underline}, albeit of a dramatically different cast, attractive
to a disturbingly different audience. As an aid to the (nightmare)
imagination-challenged, an apt metaphor for what lies ahead for U.S.
soft power, should the Trump Administration succeed in its radical
recasting of American values and policies at home and abroad, can be
found in the Classics---of comedy, that is: Saturday Night Live, and a
hilarious, terrifying sketch featuring "Überman." No, this has nothing
to do with a car ride service. Überman was the brainchild of Al Franken,
an SNL writer-performer before his election to the U.S. Senate. In 1979
Franken posed the counterfactual question, "What If....Superman Grew Up
in Germany instead of America?" In Franken's re-imagination of
Superman's origin story, young Kal-El's rocket lands during the interwar
years in Prussia rather than Kansas, where he is raised by ardent Nazis
who, as his adoptive father reminds him, "taught you how the Fatherland
was stabbed in the back at Versailles, how Jews are parasites, how
Germany will one day bring order to the world!" Thus inspired, Klaus
Kent, "a mild-mannered clerk for the Ministry of Propaganda," becomes
Überman, proudly declaring to Adolf Hitler his fight for "Untruth,
Injustice and the Nazi Way," saving Der Führer from a hidden bomb he
discovers with his X-ray vision, and denouncing Jimmy Olsteyn as a
Jew---whose secret he also uncovers with his X-ray vision (get it?).
After depositing the hapless Jimmy at Auschwitz Überman wins the Battle
of Stalingrad in five minutes, singlehandedly rounds up two million
Jews, and "Kills Every Person in England---U.S. Next", as the headline
blares in Der Daily Planet. [**The longer Donald Trump holds on to
power**, and hence the longer the sinister soft power Trumpism manifests
is projected around the world, the greater the encouragement to, and
impact on, the unsavory populist nationalist movements and authoritarian
regimes to which America is now perversely offering
inspiration]{.underline}. Donald Trump's unabashed "America First"
foreign policy is the metaphorical equivalent of Überman's gruesome
reversal of Superman's biography and principles. Al Franken's sketch
encapsulates the unfolding Up-Is-Down, Black-Is-White, Good-Is-Evil and
Evil-Is-Good disjunction and the [**global havoc** the U.S. is in the
process of wreaking]{.underline}. It isn't necessary to rehearse at
length the list of the Trump administration's head-snapping,
system-shattering statements and policy shifts that is by now painfully
well-known to readers even as it grows daily like The Blob (Steve
McQueen's, not Ben Rhodes'). The last time influential Americans and
their supporters among the public unapologetically embraced unpalatable
policies and values like immigration restriction, racism and
anti-Semitism, the results included Adolf Hitler sending a fan letter to
the anti-immigrant "scientific" eugenicist Madison Grant, a Nazi medal
for Henry Ford in honor of his vicious published attacks on Jews, and
the modeling of the Nuremberg Laws on Jim Crow segregation codes
---indeed, there was more than a touch of Überman to the United States
even at the dawn of the Age of Superman. But at least at America's helm
during most of the decade prior to U.S. entry into World War II was
Franklin D. Roosevelt, his wife Eleanor and a host of New Dealers, who
endorsed, if disappointingly imperfectly at times, equality and
inclusiveness for African-Americans, Jews and recent immigrants
---rather than far-right incubus counterfactual presidents like Buzz
Windrip in Sinclair Lewis's It Can't Happen Here and Charles Lindbergh
in Philip Roth's The Plot Against America. However, with Donald Trump in
the White House there is no presidential moral counterpoise, but rather
a celebration of some of the most disturbing pathologies embedded deep
in American politics and society, raging back in the open after many
decades of disreputability. And as Überman doesn't cease to be, well,
super, because of his malevolent predilections, [Trumpian America will
not]{.underline} not ce[ase to possess soft power. But it will be of a
**dark, sinister cast**: Lionizing, legitimating and inspiring populist
nationalist leaders]{.underline} (Austrian far-right party head Harald
Vilimsky preened after Trump's inauguration, "He is a winner, we are
winners: Frauke Petry, Marine Le Pen, Geert Wilders, all of us here are
winners"); [Providing moral cover for foreign publics'
xenophobia]{.underline}; [Setting an example for would-be strongmen of
delegitimizing the press]{.underline} ("the enemy of the American
people") and demonstrating the efficacy and impunity of pedaling the
most brazen disinformation; Confirming longstanding extreme left- and
right-wing accusations that the U.S. has no special redeeming qualities,
even vis-à-vis the autocratic, sanguinary Putin regime ("We've got a lot
of killers---you think our country is so innocent?"); [Encouraging and
steering the weakening or even the **break-up of the European Union,
NATO and the WTO**]{.underline}; [Legitimating]{.underline} Vladimir
[Putin's Russia as a defender of Western values]{.underline}; [And
stoking a racial-ethnic-religious Western civilizational antipathy
toward Islam]{.underline} in toto [and the broader non-Western
world]{.underline}. If you think all of this is dispiriting to read,
imagine what it was like to write it---Sad! (Utterly heartbreaking,
actually.) But is all in fact lost? [Is American soft power destined to
henceforth be a malign, **destabilizing force** in the **world**?
Perhaps not. **If Donald Trump rapidly falls out of favor with the bulk
of the American electorate**]{.underline}---and remember, he's already
rather more than halfway home in this regard---[he could be **rendered a
political loser in short order** and tossed out of the White House,
**taking foreign policy Trumpism down** with him. The]{.underline} 2018
and especially [**2020 elections will be pivotal** in this
regard]{.underline}. [It would be essential for the **speediest possible
resuscitation** of U.S. soft power]{.underline} that Trump as a
one-termer (or less) be succeeded by a president, whether Republican or
Democratic, dedicated to a firm re-commitment to the traditional
American values, ideas and ideals that Trump & Co. have so blithely cast
aside. In this scenario, the U.S. would still be dealing with long-term
fallout from its misadventure in international illiberalism. As Warren
Buffett famously noted, "It takes 20 years to build a reputation and
five minutes to ruin it. If you think about that, you\'ll do things
differently." Still, while it would indeed probably take a couple of
decades to well and truly live down the damage done even in four years
(or less) by the Trump administration, [it would not be the most
difficult national reputation-rebuilding effort ever
undertaken]{.underline}---think of what West Germany faced in the years
following World War II. [However, **if Donald Trump is re-elected in
2020** and is thus **given a mandate** by the American public to
continue the radical recasting of U.S. foreign policy---and with it the
**overturning of the extant international order**---then the fundamental
shift in the nature and effects of American soft power is likely to be,
in practical terms, **permanent** for a half-century or more. This will
be especially so if this shift is accompanied by an incremental domestic
turn toward authoritarianism and the concomitant erosion of the
political opposition\'s ability to reclaim power]{.underline}. There\'s
another factor to reckon with as well: [the longer]{.underline} Donald
[Trump holds on to power, and hence the longer the sinister soft power
Trumpism manifests is projected around the world, the greater the
encouragement to, and impact on, the **unsavory populist nationalist
movements** and **authoritarian r**egimes to which America is now
perversely offering inspiration]{.underline}. Even if [the
U.S.]{.underline} were to rapidly regain its ideological bearings once a
hypothetical two-term Donald Trump has left office and go back to
manifesting its traditional values-based soft power, it [could find
itself up against a bevy of formerly pro-liberal internationalist states
that have **metastasized**]{.underline} into Trumpian soft
power-inspired illiberal democracies or cold-out dictatorships now
cleaving to Russia and/or China---which will remain autocracies [seeking
to **undermine U.S. global power**]{.underline}. Thus, a resuscitated
Superman America might well end up facing the daunting threat of Überman
World.
