#### Arms sales are a [symptom]{.underline} of capitalism, and [liberal half measures]{.underline} can [only]{.underline} enable capitalist expansion. The alternative is a socialist conversion of the arms industry into publicly owned facilities dedicated to production for human needs instead of mass slaughter.

**van Auken, 12** -- Bill Van Auken, politician and activist for the
Socialist Equality Party. \"The tripling of US arms sales,\" World
Socialist, <https://www.wsws.org/en/articles/2012/08/pers-a30.html> \--

[The tripling of [US arms sales]{.mark} abroad to a record \$66.3
billion is an accurate barometer of the accelerating drive to
war]{.underline} in the Persian Gulf and on a world scale. [This one
violently surging sector of American exports **[reflect]{.mark}**s [**a
diseased capitalist economy and society**, whose financial-corporate
elite **resorts to militarism as a means of offsetting**]{.mark} the
overall **[economic decline]{.mark}** of the United States]{.underline}.
[The annual survey of global arms sales]{.underline} released this week
by the Congressional Research Service (CRS), the policy research arm of
the US Congress, [places the United States number one]{.underline} in
the provision of advanced weaponry to the world [by an overwhelming
margin]{.underline}. "In 2011, the US led in arms transfer agreements
worldwide, making agreements valued at \$66.3 billion (77.7 percent of
all such agreements), an extraordinary increase from \$21.4 billion in
2010. The US worldwide agreements total in 2011 is the largest for a
single year in the history of the US arms export program," according to
the report prepared for Congress. [[In an earlier period, Washington
justified]{.mark} such [weapons deals as part of its Cold War
strategy]{.mark} of countering the influence of t he Soviet Union and
propping up regimes aligned with the West [against Moscow]{.mark} and
its allies]{.underline}. This was under conditions where Soviet arms
sales to the so-called Third World rivaled and even surpassed those of
the United States. Today, however, as the CRS report makes clear, the US
accounts for more than three quarters of global arms deals, with the
share of its closest competitor, Russia, amounting to just 5.6 percent.
[[The]{.mark} massive [rise in]{.mark} US [arms sales is driven
by]{.mark} the accelerating turn toward aggressive war as a means of
achieving the strategic global objectives of US imperialism, combined
with **[the insatiable drive for profit]{.mark}** and power by America's
bloated military-industrial complex. The lion's share of the rise in
arms exports is directed to Saudi Arabia]{.underline} and the United
Arab Emirates (UAE), which together account for \$38.2 billion of the
\$66.3 billion total. The other major sales were \$2 billion worth of
antimissile batteries to Taiwan---a provocative move aimed against
China---and \$6.9 billion in arms to India, ratcheting up tensions with
its regional antagonist, Pakistan. The Saudi monarchy's purchase of 84
advanced F-15 fighter planes together with dozens of military
helicopters and other weapons yielded super profits for Boeing and
United Technologies. The regime in the UAE obtained a \$3.5 billion
sophisticated missile defense system, providing rich returns for
Lockheed Martin. The CRS report includes the observation: "[Whereas the
principal motivation for arms sales by key foreign suppliers in earlier
years might have been to support a foreign policy objective, today [that
motivation may be based as much**, if not more, on economic
considerations as**]{.mark} those of foreign or national
**[security]{.mark}** policy."]{.underline} In reality, these foreign
policy objectives and economic interests feed each other. The
military-industrial complex that the former general Dwight D. Eisenhower
warned against at the end of his presidency a half-century ago has grown
to gargantuan proportions, dominating the US government and both major
parties and playing a grossly disproportionate role in the American
economy. It provides a powerful impetus to both militarism abroad and
the assault on democratic rights at home. The purchases by the
monarchical regimes in the Arab world stem, on the one hand, from their
reaction to the popular upheavals that were dubbed the "Arab Spring"
and, on the other, from the buildup by the US and its allies for another
war, this time against Iran. The House of Saud, which runs Saudi Arabia
as a family fiefdom, saw in the events in Tunisia, Egypt and
particularly Bahrain, where its troops were used to suppress mass
protests, a mortal threat to its absolutist rule. An essential part of
its response is the dramatic expansion of its military apparatus. The
buildup to war against Iran, just as the one that preceded the war of
aggression against Iraq a decade ago, has been publicly justified as a
response to the supposed threat posed by "weapons of mass destruction."
The US and its allies have claimed that Iran's nuclear program is
directed at producing nuclear weapons, a charge repeatedly denied by the
government in Iran, which insists the program is for peaceful purposes.
The hypocrisy of these charges against Iran, which have provided the
pretext for crippling sanctions, the deployment of a US air and sea
armada in the Persian Gulf, and threats by Israel and the US of an
unprovoked military assault, is evident in the figures provided by the
US arms sales report. The amount of weaponry Washington sold to the
Saudi and UAE regimes alone last year amounted to nearly six times
Iran's entire military budget. The US geo-strategic objective in
sponsoring these weapons sales is to create potently armed regional
proxies for a war for regime-change in Iran. This process is already
playing out in Syria, where Washington's major arms customers---Saudi
Arabia and the UAE---are openly sponsoring the so-called rebels seeking
the overthrow of Iran's principal Arab ally, the government of Bashar
al-Assad. This sponsorship has extended to the creation of a \$100
million fund to pay the salaries of the militias challenging the Syrian
government, as well as the provision of weapons, which is being
coordinated by the CIA in Turkey and undoubtedly on the ground in Syria
itself. The preparations for war against Iran are directed at tightening
US hegemony over the energy-rich regions of the Persian Gulf and the
Caspian Sea, which the landmass of Iran spans. In that sense, the
aggression being prepared against Iran and its people under Obama is in
pursuit of the same aims that underlay the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq
launched under Bush. The arms industry is massively subsidized by the
American taxpayer. While the political establishment and media insist
"there is no money" when it comes to jobs, decent wages, education and
vital public services, endless billions are lavished on America's
merchants of death. [[American working people neither share in this
industry's]{.mark} state-subsidized [profits nor have any say over its
sale]{.mark} of powerful weapons systems to reactionary
regimes]{.underline}. Just as mass opposition emerged to the wars in
Afghanistan and Iraq, there is similar popular hostility to arming the
Saudi and UAE monarchs to the teeth, not to mention being dragged into
yet another war, this time against Iran. [[The disappearance of]{.mark}
any [mass protest]{.mark} against war [is a reflection]{.mark} not of
popular sentiment, but rather of the reactionary politics of [a
privileged]{.mark} middle class [layer of pseudo-lefts that]{.mark}
deliberately [worked to channel anti-war sentiment behind]{.mark} Obama
and [the Democratic Party. A new mass movement against war can be built
**only through an irreconcilable break with the**]{.mark} Democratic
Party and the **[US]{.mark}** two-party system. [What is required is the
**independent political mobilization of the working class on the basis
of a socialist program**, including the **conversion of the arms
industry into publicly owned facilities dedicated to production for
human needs rather than mass slaughter.**]{.mark}]{.underline}

#### Capitalism causes extinction. 

William I. **Robinson 16**. Professor of sociology, global studies and
Latin American studies at U.C. Santa Barbara. "Sadistic Capitalism: Six
Urgent Matters for Humanity in Global Crisis," Truth-out, April 12,
2016,
http://www.truth-out.org/opinion/item/35596-sadistic-capitalism-six-urgent-matters-for-humanity-in-global-crisis.

[In]{.underline} these mean streets of [globalized
capitalism]{.underline} in crisis, [it has become profitable to turn
poverty and inequality into a tourist attraction]{.underline}.

The South African Emoya Luxury Hotel and Spa company has made a
glamorized spectacle of it. The resort recently advertised an
opportunity for tourists to stay \"in our unique Shanty Town \... and
experience traditional township living within a safe private game
reserve environment.\" A cluster of simulated shanties outside of
Bloemfontein that the company has constructed \"is ideal for team
building, braais, bachelors \[parties\], theme parties and an experience
of a lifetime,\" read the ad. The luxury accommodations, made to appear
from the outside as shacks, featured paraffin lamps, candles, a
battery-operated radio, an outside toilet, a drum and fireplace for
cooking, as well as under-floor heating, air conditioning and wireless
internet access. A well-dressed, young white couple is pictured
embracing in a field with the corrugated tin shanties in the background.
The only thing missing in this fantasy world of sanitized space and
glamorized poverty was the people themselves living in poverty.

[The "luxury shanty town" in South Africa is a fitting metaphor for
global capitalism as a whole. Faced with a stagnant global economy,
[elites]{.mark} have managed to turn [war, structural violence and
inequality into **opportunities for capital**]{.mark}, pleasure and
entertainment]{.underline}. It is hard not to conclude that [unchecked
capitalism has become]{.underline} what I term ["sadistic capitalism,"
in which the suffering and deprivation generated by capitalism become a
source of aesthetic pleasure]{.underline}, leisure and entertainment for
others.

I recently had the opportunity to travel through several countries in
Latin America, the Middle East, North Africa, East Asia and throughout
North America. I was on sabbatical to research what the global crisis
looks like on the ground around the world. Everywhere I went, [social
polarization and political tensions have reached explosive
dimensions]{.underline}.

Where is the crisis headed, what are the possible outcomes and what does
it tell us about global capitalism and resistance? [This crisis is not
like earlier structural crises of world capitalism]{.underline}, such as
in the 1930s or 1970s. [This one is]{.underline} fast becoming
[systemic]{.underline}. The crisis of humanity shares aspects of earlier
structural crises of world capitalism, but [there are]{.underline} six
[novel, interrelated dimensions to the current moment]{.underline} that
I highlight here, in broad strokes, as the \"big picture\" context in
which countries and peoples around the world are experiencing a descent
into chaos and uncertainty.

1\) [The level of global social polarization and **[inequality is
unprecedented]{.mark}** in the face of out-of-control, over-accumulated
capital]{.underline}. In January 2016, the development agency Oxfam
published a follow-up to its report on global inequality that had been
released the previous year. According to the new report, now just [62
billionaires]{.underline} \-- down from 80 identified by the agency in
its January 2015 report \-- [control as much wealth as one half of the
world\'s population, and the top 1% \[[one percent]{.mark}\] [owns
more]{.mark} wealth than the other \[[ninety-nine]{.mark}\] 99%
combined]{.underline}. Beyond the transnational capitalist class and the
upper echelons of the global power bloc, [the richest 20 percent of
humanity owns some 95 percent of the world\'s wealth, while the bottom
80 percent has to make do with]{.underline} just [5
percent]{.underline}.

This 20-80 divide of global society into haves and the have-nots is the
new global social apartheid. [It is evident not just
between]{.underline} rich and poor [countries, but within each
country]{.underline}, North and South, [with the]{.underline} rise of
new affluent high-consumption sectors alongside the downward mobility,
["precariatization," destabilization and expulsion of
majorities]{.underline}.

[Escalating [inequalities fuel]{.mark} capitalism's **chronic problem of
[over-accumulation]{.mark}**: The transnational capitalist class cannot
find productive outlets to unload the enormous amounts of surplus it has
accumulated, leading to stagnation]{.underline} in the world economy.
The signs of an impending depression are everywhere. The front page of
the February 20 issue of The Economist read, \"The World Economy: Out of
Ammo?\"

[Extreme levels of social polarization present a challenge to dominant
groups. They strive to purchase the loyalty of that 20 percent, while at
the same time dividing the 80 percent, co-opting some into a hegemonic
bloc and repressing the rest. Alongside the spread of frightening new
systems of social control and repression is heightened dissemination
through the culture industries and corporate marketing strategies that
depoliticize through consumerist fantasies]{.underline} and the
manipulation of desire.

As \"Trumpism\" in the United States so well illustrates, [another
strategy of co-optation is the **[manipulation of fear and
insecurity]{.mark}** among the downwardly mobile so that social anxiety
[is channeled toward **scapegoated communities**]{.mark}. This
psychosocial mechanism of displacing mass anxieties is not new, but it
appears to be increasing around the world in the face of the structural
destabilization of capitalist globalization. Scapegoated communities are
under siege, such as [the Rohingya]{.mark} in Myanmar, the Muslim
minority in India, the [Kurds]{.mark} in Turkey, southern African
immigrants in South Africa, [and]{.mark} Syrian and Iraqi
[refugees]{.mark}]{.underline} and other immigrants [in
Europe]{.underline}.

As with its 20th century predecessor, [21st century fascism hinges on
such manipulation of social anxiety at a time of acute capitalist
crisis. [Extreme inequality requires]{.mark} **extreme [violence and
repression]{.mark}** [that lend to]{.mark}]{.underline} projects of 21st
century **[[fascism]{.underline}]{.mark}**.

2\) [The system is fast reaching the ecological limits to its
reproduction. We have reached several]{.underline} tipping points in
what environmental scientists refer to as nine crucial [\"planetary
boundaries.\" [We]{.mark} have]{.underline} already [[exceeded]{.mark}
these [boundaries in]{.mark}]{.underline} three areas \-- [[climate
change]{.mark}, the [nitrogen cycle and diversity
loss]{.mark}]{.underline}.

There have been five previous mass extinctions in earth\'s history.
While all these were due to natural causes, for the first time ever,
human conduct is intersecting with and fundamentally altering the earth
system.

We have entered what Paul Crutzen, the Dutch environmental scientist and
Nobel Prize winner, termed the Anthropocene \-- a new age in which
humans have transformed up to half of the world\'s surface. [We are
altering the composition of the atmosphere and [acidifying the
oceans]{.mark} at a rate that [undermines]{.mark} the [conditions for
life]{.mark}]{.underline}. The ecological dimensions of global crisis
cannot be understated.

\"We are deciding, without quite meaning to, which evolutionary pathways
will remain open and which will forever be closed,\" observes Elizabeth
Kolbert in her best seller, The Sixth Extinction. \"No other creature
has ever managed this \... The Sixth Extinction will continue to
determine the course of life long after everything people have written
and painted and built has been ground into dust.\"

Capitalism cannot be held solely responsible. The human-nature
contradiction has deep roots in civilization itself. The ancient
Sumerian empires, for example, collapsed after the population
over-salinated their crop soil. The Mayan city-state network collapsed
about AD 900 due to deforestation. And the former Soviet Union wrecked
havoc on the environment.

However, [given capital's implacable impulse to accumulate profit and
its accelerated commodification of nature, it is difficult to imagine
that the environmental catastrophe can be resolved within the capitalist
system. "Green capitalism" appears as an **oxymoron**, as **sadistic
capitalism's** attempt to turn the ecological crisis into a
**profit-making opportunity**]{.underline}, along with the conversion of
poverty into a tourist attraction.

3\) [[The]{.mark} sheer [magnitude of]{.mark} the means of [violence is
unprecedented]{.mark}, as is the concentrated control over
the]{.underline} means of global communications and the production and
[circulation of knowledge, symbols and images. We have seen the spread
of frightening new systems of social control and repression that have
brought us into the panoptical surveillance society and the age of
thought control]{.underline}. This real-life Orwellian world is in a
sense more perturbing than that described by George Orwell in his iconic
novel 1984. In that fictional world, people were compelled to give their
obedience to the state ("Big Brother") in exchange for a quiet existence
with guarantees of employment, housing and other social necessities.
Now, however, the corporate and political powers that be force obedience
even as the means of survival are denied to the vast majority.

Global apartheid involves the creation of \"green zones\" that are
cordoned off in each locale around the world where elites are insulated
through new systems of spatial reorganization, social control and
policing. \"Green zone\" refers to the nearly impenetrable area in
central Baghdad that US occupation forces established in the wake of the
2003 invasion of Iraq. The command center of the occupation and select
Iraqi elite inside that green zone were protected from the violence and
chaos that engulfed the country.

Urban areas around the world are now green zoned through gentrification,
gated communities, surveillance systems, and state and private violence.
Inside the world\'s green zones, privileged strata avail themselves of
privatized social services, consumption and entertainment. They can work
and communicate through internet and satellite sealed off under the
protection of armies of soldiers, police and private security forces.

Green zoning takes on distinct forms in each locality. In Palestine, I
witnessed such zoning in the form of Israeli military checkpoints,
Jewish settler-only roads and the apartheid wall. In Mexico City, the
most exclusive residential areas in the upscale Santa Fe District are
accessible only by helicopter and private gated roads. In Johannesburg,
a surreal drive through the exclusive Sandton City area reveals rows of
mansions that appear as military compounds, with private armed towers
and electrical and barbed-wire fences. In Cairo, I toured satellite
cities ringing the impoverished center and inner suburbs where the
country\'s elite could live out their aspirations and fantasies. They
sport gated residential complexes with spotless green lawns, private
leisure and shopping centers and English-language international schools
under the protection of military checkpoints and private security
police.

In other cities, green zoning is subtler but no less effective. In Los
Angeles, where I live, the freeway system now has an express lane
reserved for those that can pay an exorbitant toll. On this lane, the
privileged speed by, while the rest remain one lane over, stuck in the
city\'s notorious bumper-to-bumper traffic \-- or even worse, in
notoriously underfunded and underdeveloped public transportation, where
it may take half a day to get to and from work. There is no barrier
separating this express lane from the others. However, a near-invisible
closed surveillance system monitors every movement. If a vehicle without
authorization shifts into the exclusive lane, it is instantly recorded
by this surveillance system and a heavy fine is imposed on the driver,
under threat of impoundment, while freeway police patrols are
ubiquitous.

[Outside of]{.underline} the global [green zones, [warfare and police
containment]{.mark} have become **[normalized]{.mark}** and sanitized
for those not directly at the receiving end of armed aggression.
\"Militainment\" \-- portraying]{.underline} and even glamorizing [war
and violence as entertaining spectacles]{.underline} through Hollywood
films and television police shows, computer games and corporate \"news\"
channels \-- [may be the epitome of sadistic capitalism. It
desensitizes, bringing about complacency]{.underline} and indifference.

[In between the green zones and outright warfare are prison industrial
complexes, immigrant and refugee repression and control systems, the
criminalization of outcast communities and capitalist schooling. The
omnipresent media and [cultural apparatuses]{.mark} of the corporate
economy]{.underline}, in particular, aim to [**[colonize the
mind]{.mark}** \-- [to undermine the ability to **think
critically**]{.mark} and outside the dominant worldview. A [**neofascist
culture** emerges through militarism]{.mark}, extreme masculinization,
racism and racist mobilizations against scapegoats]{.underline}.

4\) We are reaching limits to the extensive expansion of capitalism.
[Capitalism is like riding a bicycle: When you stop
pedaling]{.underline} the bicycle, [you fall over. [If the]{.mark}
capitalist [system stops expanding]{.mark} outward, [it enters
crisis]{.mark} and faces collapse. In each earlier structural crisis,
the system went through a new round of extensive expansion \-- from
waves of colonial conquest]{.underline} in earlier centuries, [to the
integration]{.underline} in the late 20th and early 21st centuries
[of]{.underline} the [former socialist countries]{.underline}, China,
India and other areas that had been marginally outside the system.
[There are no longer any new territories to integrate into world
capitalism]{.underline}.

Meanwhile, the privatization of education, health care, utilities, basic
services and public land are turning those spaces in global society that
were outside of capital\'s control into \"spaces of capital.\" [Even
poverty has been turned into a commodity. What is there left to
commodify? Where can the system now expand? [With]{.mark} the
[limits]{.mark} to expansion [comes]{.mark} a turn toward **[militarized
accumulation]{.mark}** \-- [making wars of endless destruction]{.mark}
and reconstruction and expanding the militarization of social and
political institutions so as to continue to generate new opportunities
for accumulation in the face of stagnation]{.underline}.

5\) [There is the rise of a vast surplus population inhabiting a
\"planet of slums,\" alienated from the]{.underline} productive
[economy, thrown into the margins and subject to]{.underline} these
sophisticated systems of [social control and destruction. Global
capitalism has no direct use for surplus humanity]{.underline}. But
indirectly, [it holds wages down everywhere and makes [new systems
of]{.mark} 21st century [slavery]{.mark} possible. These systems include
[prison labor]{.mark}, the [forced]{.mark} recruitment of
[miners]{.mark} at gunpoint by warlords contracted by global
corporations to dig up valuable minerals]{.underline} in the Congo,
[[sweatshops and exploited immigrant communities]{.underline}]{.mark}
(including the rising tide of immigrant female caregivers for affluent
populations).

Furthermore, the global working class is experiencing accelerated
\"precariatization.\" [The \"new precariat\" refers to the proletariat
that faces capital under today's unstable and precarious labor
relations]{.underline} \-- informalization, casualization, part-time,
temp, immigrant and contract labor.

As communities are uprooted everywhere, there is a rising reserve army
of immigrant labor. The global working class is becoming divided into
citizen and immigrant workers. The latter are particularly attractive to
transnational capital, as the lack of citizenship rights makes them
particularly vulnerable, and therefore, exploitable.

[The challenge for dominant groups is how to contain the real and
potential rebellion of surplus humanity, the immigrant workforce and the
precariat]{.underline}. How can they contain the explosive
contradictions of this system? The 21st century [megacities become the
battlegrounds between mass resistance movements and]{.underline} the new
systems of [mass repression. Some [populations]{.mark} in these
cities]{.underline} (and also in abandoned countryside) [are [at risk of
**genocide**]{.mark}, such as those in Gaza, zones in Somalia and Congo,
and swaths of Iraq and Syria]{.underline}.

6\) [There is a disjuncture between a globalizing economy and a
nation-state-based system of political authority. Transnational state
apparatuses]{.underline} are incipient and [do not wield enough power
and authority to]{.underline} organize and [stabilize the
system]{.underline}, much less to impose regulations on runaway
transnational capital. In the wake of the 2008 financial collapse, for
instance, the governments of the G-8 and G-20 were unable to impose
transnational regulation on the global financial system, despite a
series of emergency summits to discuss such regulation.

Elites historically have attempted to resolve the problems of
over-accumulation by state policies that can regulate the anarchy of the
market. However, in recent decades, [transnational capital has broken
free from the constraints imposed by the nation-state]{.underline}. The
more \"enlightened\" elite representatives of the transnational
capitalist class are now clamoring for transnational mechanisms of
regulation that would allow the global ruling class to reign in the
anarchy of the system in the interests of saving global capitalism from
itself and from radical challenges from below.

At the same time, the division of the world into some 200 competing
nation-states is not the most propitious of circumstances for the global
working class. Victories in popular struggles from below in any one
country or region can (and often do) become diverted and even undone by
the structural power of transnational capital and the direct political
and military domination that this structural power affords the dominant
groups. In Greece, for instance, the leftist Syriza party came to power
in 2015 on the heels of militant worker struggles and a mass uprising.
But the party abandoned its radical program as a result of the enormous
pressure exerted on it from the European Central Bank and private
international creditors.

The Systemic Critique of Global Capitalism

A growing number of transnational elites themselves now recognize that
any resolution to the global crisis must involve redistribution downward
of income.

However, in the viewpoint of those from below, a neo-Keynesian
redistribution within the prevailing corporate power structure is not
enough. [What is [required is]{.mark} a redistribution of power downward
and transformation toward [a system in which social need trumps private
profit]{.mark}]{.underline}.

[A [global rebellion]{.mark} against the transnational capitalist class
[has spread]{.mark} since]{.underline} the financial collapse of [2008.
Wherever one looks, there is popular, grassroots and leftist struggle,
and the rise of new cultures of resistance: the [Arab
Spring]{.mark}]{.underline}; the resurgence of [[leftist politics
in]{.mark} Greece, Spain and elsewhere in [Europe]{.mark}; the tenacious
resistance of [Mexican social movements]{.mark}]{.underline} following
the Ayotzinapa massacre of 2014; [the favela [uprising in
Brazil]{.mark}]{.underline} against the government\'s World Cup and
Olympic expulsion policies; [the [student strikes in Chile]{.mark}; the
remarkable surge in the Chinese workers' movement; the shack dwellers
and other poor people\'s campaigns in South Africa; [Occupy]{.mark} Wall
Street, the immigrant rights movement, [B]{.mark}lack [L]{.mark}ives
[M]{.mark}atter, fast food workers\' struggle]{.underline} and the
mobilization around the Bernie Sanders presidential campaign in the
United States.

[This global revolt is spread unevenly and faces many challenges. A
number of these struggles]{.underline}, moreover, [have suffered
setbacks]{.underline}, such as the Greek working-class movement and,
tragically, the Arab Spring. What type of a transformation is viable,
and how do we achieve it? How we interpret the global crisis is itself a
matter of vital importance as politics polarize worldwide between a
neofascist and a popular response. [The [systemic critique]{.mark} of
global capitalism [must]{.mark} strive to
[influence]{.mark}]{.underline}, from this vantage point, [the discourse
and practice of [movements for]{.mark} a more [just distribution]{.mark}
of wealth and power. Our [survival may depend on
it]{.mark}]{.underline}.

2014). [[These]{.mark} six [dimensions]{.mark}]{.underline}, in broad
strokes, [[present a]{.underline}]{.mark} "[big picture]{.underline}"
[[context in which a **global police state** is
emerging]{.underline}]{.mark}. First, [[the system]{.mark} is
fast [reaching the **ecological
limits** of]{.mark} its **[reproduction]{.mark}**]{.underline}[. **[We
have already passed tipping points]{.underline}**]{.mark}[ in climate
change]{.underline}, [the nitrogen cycle]{.underline}, [and diversity
loss]{.underline}. [For the first time ever]{.underline}, [[human
conduct]{.mark} is intersecting with and fundamentally altering the
earth system in such a way that [threatens to bring]{.mark} about a
sixth **[mass extinction]{.mark}**]{.underline} (see, e.g., Foster et
al., 2011; Moore, 2015). These ecological dimensions of global crisis
have been brought to the forefront of the global agenda by the worldwide
environmental justice movement. Communities around the world have come
under escalating repression as they face off against transnational
corporate plunder of their environment. While capitalism cannot be held
solely responsible for the ecological crisis, [[it is difficult
to]{.mark} imagine that the environmental catastrophe can be [resolved
within]{.mark} the [capitalist system given]{.mark} capital's implacable
impulse to accumulate and [its]{.mark} accelerated **[commodification of
nature]{.mark}**]{.underline}[.]{.mark} Second, [the level
of [global]{.mark} social [polarization and inequality
is **unprecedented**]{.mark}]{.underline}. The richest one percent of
humanity in 2016 controlled over half of the world's wealth and 20
percent controlled 95 percent of that wealth, while the remaining 80
percent had to make do with just five percent (Oxfam,
2017). [These [escalating inequalities fuel capitalism's]{.mark} chronic
problem of [overaccumulation]{.mark}]{.underline}: [the TCC [cannot
find]{.mark} productive [outlets to unload]{.mark} the enormous amounts
of [surplus]{.mark} it has accumulated]{.underline}, [[leading
to]{.mark} chronic [**stagnation** in
the]{.mark} world [economy]{.mark}]{.underline} (see next section).
Such [extreme levels of social [polarization present a
challenge]{.mark} of social control [to dominant
groups]{.mark}]{.underline}. As Trumpism in the United States as well as
the rise of far-right and neo-fascist movements in Europe so well
illustrate, [[cooptation]{.mark} also [involves]{.mark} the **[manipulation
of fear]{.mark}** and insecurity [among the downwardly mobile
so]{.mark} that **[social anxiety is channeled towards scapegoated
communities]{.mark}**]{.underline}. [This psychosocial mechanism of
displacing mass anxieties]{.underline} is not new, but it [appears to be
increasing around the world in the face of the structural
destabilization of capitalist
globalization.]{.underline} Extreme [[inequality requires extreme
violence and repression that lend themselves to projects of 21st
century **fascism**]{.underline}]{.mark}. Third, [the sheer magnitude of
the means of violence and social control is
unprecedented]{.underline},[as well as the magnitude and [concentrated
control over]{.mark} the means of [global communication]{.mark} and the
production and circulation of symbols, images, and
knowledge.]{.underline} Computerized wars, drone warfare, robot
soldiers, bunker-buster bombs, a new generation of nuclear weapons,
satellite surveillance, cyberwar, spatial control technology, and so
forth, have changed the face of warfare, and more generally, of systems
of social control and repression. [[**We have arrived at the
panoptical** surveillance **society**]{.underline},]{.mark} a point
brought home by Edward Snowden's revelations in 2013, and the age of
thought control by those who control global flows of communication and
symbolic production. [[If global capitalist crisis leads to a new
world war the destruction
would simply be **unprecedented**]{.underline}]{.mark}. Fourth, [**[we
are reaching limits]{.mark}** to the extensive expansion of
capitalism]{.underline}, in the sense that [there are no longer any new
territories of significance to integrate into world capitalism and
new [spaces to commodify are drying up]{.mark}]{.underline}[.]{.mark}
The capitalist system is by its nature expansionary. In each earlier
structural crisis, the system went through a new round of extensive
expansion -- from waves of colonial conquest in earlier centuries, to
the integration in the late 20th and early 21st centuries of the former
socialist countries, China, India and other areas that had been
marginally outside the system. [**[There are no longer]{.mark}** any
[new **territories to integrate**]{.mark} into world
capitalism.]{.underline} [At the same
time]{.underline}, [the [privatization]{.mark} of
education]{.underline}, health, utilities, basic services, and public
lands [[is]{.mark} [turning]{.mark} those spaces in [global
society]{.mark} that were outside of capital's
control [into]{.mark}]{.underline}[ "[spaces of
capital]{.underline}]{.mark}," [so that intensive expansion is reaching
depths never before seen]{.underline}. What is there left to commodify?
Where can the system now expand? New spaces have to be violently cracked
open and the peoples in these spaces must be repressed by the global
police state. Fifth, there is the rise of a vast surplus population
inhabiting a "planet of slums" (Davis, 2007) pushed out of the
productive economy, thrown into the margins, and subject to
sophisticated systems of social control and to destruction, into a
mortal cycle of dispossession-exploitation-exclusion. Crises provide
capital with the opportunity to accelerate the process of forcing
greater productivity out of fewer workers. The processes by which
surplus labor is generated have accelerated under globalization. Spatial
reorganization has helped transnational capital to break the
territorial-bound power of organized labor and impose new capital--labor
relations based on fragmentation, flexibilization, and the cheapening of
labor. These developments, combined with a massive new round of
primitive accumulation and displacement of hundreds of millions, have
given rise to a new global army of superfluous labor that goes well
beyond the traditional reserve army of labor that Marx
discussed. [[Global **capitalism has no** direct **use for surplus
humanity**]{.underline}]{.mark}. But indirectly, it holds wages down
everywhere and makes new systems of 21st century slavery possible.
Dominant groups face the challenge of how to contain both the real and
potential rebellion of surplus humanity. In addition, surplus humanity
cannot consume and so as their ranks expand the problem of
overaccumulation becomes exacerbated. Sixth, [there is an acute
political contradiction in global capitalism: economic [globalization
takes places within a nation-state system]{.mark} of political
authority]{.underline}. [[Transnational state apparatuses]{.mark} are
incipient and [have not been able to]{.mark} substitute for a leading
nation-state with enough power]{.underline} and authority [to organize
and **[stabilize the system]{.mark}**]{.underline}, much less to impose
regulations on transnational capital. In the age of capitalist
globalization governments must attract to the national territory
transnational corporate investment, which requires providing capital
with all the incentives associated with neoliberalism -- downward
pressure on wages, deregulation, austerity, and so on -- that aggravate
inequality, impoverishment, and insecurity for working classes.
Nation-states face a contradiction between the need to promote
transnational capital accumulation in their territories and their need
to achieve political legitimacy. As a result, states around the world
have been experiencing spiraling crises of legitimacy. This situation
generates bewildering and seemingly contradictory politics and also
helps explain the resurgence of far-right and neo-fascist forces that
espouse rhetoric of nationalism and protectionism even as they promote
neo-liberalism.

### Framework---2NC 

#### Academic spaces like debate have been recalibrated as spaces for the creation of human capital -- the scholarship of the 1AC is tied to a desire for profit and productivity, which means that the knowledge they produce in this space can only go toward bolstering capitalism -- the only ethical solution is to use this space as a chance for critique and counternarratives of knowledge production

**Hall 19 (**Richard Hall is Professor of Education and Technology at De
Montfort University, and a National Teaching Fellow. He is a Director of
Leicester Vaughan College, a trustee of the Open Library of Humanities,
and a co-operator at the Social Science Centre in Lincoln, UK. "On
authoritarian neoliberalism and poetic epistemology", VR)

Both the [process of reproducing higher education]{.underline} (HE) [and
the meaning of academic institutions in the global North is framed by
the secular crisis of capitalism]{.underline} (Hall 2015). Across a
global terrain, the [failure to reinstate stable forms of accumulation
and to counteract the tendency of the rate of profit to fall has
catalysed educational policy focused upon discourses of]{.underline}
entrepreneurship, employability, excellence, and [impact]{.underline}.
[Education has been recalibrated as a site]{.underline} for the
extraction of rents, the generation of surpluses, and [the creation of
new human capital, grounded in a desire for productivity]{.underline}
(McGettigan 2015). One result has been that [academic practices, such as
public engagement and the production of scholarship, have been tied to
the imposition of value-for-money]{.underline} (Newfield 2016[), behind
which hides the labour theory of value. This tends to reduce both
academic autonomy and knowledge production to their exchange-value as
representative of their social utility]{.underline}. One critical
terrain for analysing this reduction is through the policy- and
practice-based framings of authoritarian neoliberalism, as a mode of
control. [Authoritarian neoliberalism emerges from forms of governance
that normalise hegemonic modes of behaviour and discourses, by
disciplining non-co-operative individuals and groups]{.underline}
(Johnson 2018). [Such forms of non-co-operation include]{.underline}:
first, [dissent and opposition]{.underline} to the commodification of
social goods like welfare, healthcare and education; and second, [the
failure to generate new forms of human capital]{.underline} or to
maintain well-being in the face of precarious employment or performance
management. Such symptoms are a function of an individual's failure to
manage their own risk in relation to the market and the value of their
own labour in the reproduction of existing social norms. This [tends to
increase the marginalisation of specific individuals and groups, based
upon their relationship to dominant, authoritative positions rooted in
the intersection of whiteness, heterosexuality, maleness and
ableism]{.underline} (Steinþórsdóttir at al. 2017). The technocratic
practices, policies and ideas that are associated with authoritarian
neoliberalism as a mode of disciplinary governance [enable an analysis
of knowledge production at the level of society]{.underline} (Bruff
2014; Bruff and Tansel 2018; Tansel et al. 2017). [Knowledge production
is recalibrated by audit technologies that correct performance through
corporate governance, national and international league tables,
excellence frameworks, competition for student numbers and fees, and
tenure arrangements. This is not a smooth or uncontested terrain, but it
places the academic in sharp, disciplinary relief to her own labour
process, knowledge production, academic communities and her sense of
Self]{.underline} (Hall 2018). Here, there is a powerful relationship
between audit technologies and commodification processes, which both
[proletarianise academic labour by instantiating a precarious, gig
economy, and also connect knowledge production and dissemination to
techniques that enable learning analytics about those activities to be
captured in near real-time. This allows institutions and corporations to
finesse educational performance]{.underline}, through performative,
audit cultures (Pasquale 2018). However, [there are counter-narratives
of ways in which knowledge production might be reimagined]{.underline},
and through which that knowledge might be reproduced as a movement of
becoming across a social terrain (Braidotti 2017; Motta 2018). The
[potential for new forms of humanism related to the functions of
intellectual knowledge at the level of society critique the imposition
of a prosaic, epistemic starting point for life. Instead, they imagine
life reflected and refracted by a poetry of illumination, or a quality
of light that enables us to see how understanding is born of a
collective, visceral, emotional, cognitive and philosophical
experience]{.underline} (Lorde 2013). [Here, engagement with indigenous
and decolonising studies in education enable us to turn these processes
that erupt in the global North back upon themselves, by holding a mirror
up to commodification and objectification, and instead revealing the
power of stories and narratives that de-centre the world as it is
projected hegemonically]{.underline} (Bhambra et al. 2018; Tuhiwai Smith
et al. 2018).

### Rt Cause (Oppression) 

#### Capitalism is the root cause of oppression and violence -- movement building to challenge and change the system are a prerequisite 

**Sell**, H., **2015**, Socialist Party of England and Wales, sister
party of Socialist Alternative, "IDENTITY POLITICS AND THE STRUGGLE
AGAINST OPPRESSION"
http://www.socialistalternative.org/2015/11/02/identity-politics-struggle-oppression/

[Over recent years there has been a growth in support for]{.underline}
what can broadly be described as ['identity politics' among]{.underline}
many mainly [young people who are]{.underline} rightly angry about and
[radicalised by, their experience of sexism, racism, homophobia,
prejudice against disabled people]{.underline} and other forms of
oppression. In one sense, identity politics is an inevitable part of the
political awakening of many members of oppressed groups within society.
Recognising that you are oppressed, and that you can fight against your
oppression through a common struggle with others who share the same
oppression, is a vital first step.¶ However, **[the history of struggle
against oppression shows that]{.underline}**, on the basis of
experience, **[those participating tend to go beyond identity politics
as they recognise [the root cause of]{.mark} their [oppression lies in
the structure of society.]{.mark}]{.underline}** The highest point of
the vast rebellion against racism in the US in the 1950s and 1960s, for
example, was reached by [[the Black Panthers]{.underline}]{.mark}, who
[[were founded]{.underline}]{.mark} in 1966 [[with the]{.mark}
magnificent [concept:]{.mark}]{.underline} "We do not fight racism with
racism. We fight racism with solidarity. We do not fight exploitative
capitalism with black capitalism. **[[We fight capitalism with basic
socialism]{.mark}".¶]{.underline}** Today, [both]{.underline} the
\#[[B]{.mark}lack[L]{.mark}ives[M]{.mark}atter]{.underline} rebellion
[[and]{.mark} the [movement for]{.mark} \$[15]{.mark} Now [are the first
stages of a new mass uprising]{.mark}]{.underline} against poverty and
racism in the US. [However, the pushing back of consciousness globally
over the decades following the collapse of Stalinism in the late 1980s
and the capitalist triumphalism that accompanied it, mean that the **new
movements did not begin where the Panthers left off**, with a socialist
outlook.]{.underline} Nonetheless, there is a growing anti-capitalist
mood among young people in the US, which is a first step to drawing
socialist conclusions.¶ At the same time, [[identity politics is many
activists' **starting point**]{.mark}. While those involved in struggle
may see this mainly as a means to fight back, the form of identity
politics that has emanated from the universities and has dominated over
recent decades **[concentrates]{.mark} overwhelmingly [on discussing
personal experience]{.mark} of oppression [rather than]{.mark} trying to
find the [means to end it.¶ ]{.mark}**This includes]{.underline} all the
strands of identity politics that have become more prominent in recent
years, such as [intersectionality and privilege theory.]{.underline} [In
Britain these concepts remain little known in wider society]{.underline}
but have become commonplace in, for example, university feminist
societies. Intersectionalists argue that different oppressions
'intersect'. Indeed, they do: a black working-class woman is triply
oppressed, for example. But [**intersectionalists often [see their role
as]{.mark} cataloguing and [describing oppressions]{.mark} and their
intersections [rather than abolishing them]{.mark}.¶** Supporters of
'privilege theory' are best known for telling people to 'check their
privilege']{.underline} during (often online) debates. The founder of
privilege theory, Peggy [McIntosh]{.underline}, [argued that a white,
upper-class, heterosexual man]{.underline}, for example, [is carrying
around an 'invisible knapsack' full of unearned privileges.]{.underline}
The argument goes that power is not concentrated in the hands of one
class, or in the state, but is spread throughout society and therefore
exists in all social and interpersonal relationships. Privilege theory
states that every individual is part of a multiplicity of oppressive
relationships. It concentrates overwhelmingly on exhortations to
individuals to change, to check their privilege.¶ [But **[it is not
possible to eliminate either oppressions or privileges merely by
exhorting individuals to change their behaviour]{.mark}.**]{.underline}
In fact, in many countries there have been significant improvements in
social attitudes to different forms of oppression in recent decades, but
they have not resulted in the ending of the oppressions concerned.¶
Racism ingrained¶ [In Britain, for example,]{.underline} while racist
prejudices are still widespread, [crude racist ideas are far less
socially acceptable than]{.underline} they were [30 years ago. This has
come about for a number of reasons, above all]{.underline} the
determination and increased [confidence of black and Asian people to
fight discrimination]{.underline} and racism. [Another important factor
was]{.underline} the [widespread involvement of black and Asian workers
in]{.underline} the [trade unions]{.underline} in a common struggle
alongside white workers. Both of these factors helped to foster a strong
feeling among a large section of the white population, especially youth,
that racism is wrong and should be combated.¶ [Nonetheless, racism
remains deeply ingrained]{.underline} in British society. The police are
up to 28 times more likely to stop and search you if you are black or
Asian. The gap between average pay for white workers and those from
ethnic minorities has actually increased over recent years despite an
improvement in social attitudes. Over half of young black men are
unemployed, more than double the unemployment rate for young white men.¶
[In the US the situation is even starker.]{.underline} While deep-rooted
racism remains there has also been an improvement in social attitudes.
There has been the development of a black middle class and even a small
black elite. Both processes are reflected in the election of a black man
as US president. The vast majority of the black population, however,
remain among the poorest and most oppressed in society, facing violent
state repression. One hundred and thirty five African Americans were
killed by the police in the first half of 2015 alone.¶ [**[Racism does
not just stem from individual prejudices but]{.underline}**]{.mark} from
something more fundamental: **[[the nature of capitalism as it
has]{.mark} actually [developed]{.mark}.]{.underline}** Malcolm X
correctly declared that, "you can't have capitalism without racism".
[Capitalism]{.underline}, as Karl Marx famously said, [came into being
"dripping from head to foot, from every pore, with blood and
dirt".]{.underline} (Capital, Volume 1, Chapter 31) He was referring,
particularly, to the role of slavery in the accumulation of capital.
With slavery came the development of all kinds of pseudo-scientific
racist theories designed to justify the enslavement of African peoples.
Racist ideas were then adapted to justify the colonial oppression of
large parts of the world.¶ [[Capitalism was forced to abandon direct
colonial rule as a result of]{.mark} the magnificent [revolutionary
movements]{.mark} that took place against it. **[Economic
exploitation]{.mark}**]{.underline}, however, **[[is more brutal than
ever]{.mark}.]{.underline}** Two hundred and fifty years ago the gap
between the richest and poorest countries was around five to one. Today
it is 400 to one. [Racism is used to justify this vast gulf
and]{.underline} also [that black workers are usually among the poorest
and most oppressed sections of the working class even in the 'rich'
countries.¶]{.underline} Women's oppression¶ [Similarly, blatant sexism
is no longer acceptable in the way it would have been in the
past]{.underline}, particularly in the economically advanced capitalist
countries. Women have won greater rights in recent decades. There are
different factors that have led to this, including the development of
improved and widely available contraception. However, many of these
gains can be traced back to the growing confidence of women as a result
of many more women working rather than being isolated in the home.¶
**[Nonetheless, women continue to be oppressed.]{.underline}**
[This]{.underline} oppression [stems]{.underline}, [not]{.underline}
merely [from the attitudes of men]{.underline}, [but from the role of
women and the family in capitalist and earlier class
societies.]{.underline} Most of us think of 'the family' as the
individuals who make up our own family, who are often the people who are
closest to us. Historically, however, the family as an institution has
also acted within class societies as an agent of social control with the
father as 'head of the household' having responsibility for disciplining
women and children. While this concept has been weakened in the modern
era by the growing confidence of women, it is far from eliminated. The
idea remains deeply ingrained that women are possessions of men and that
we need to be loyal and obedient to our partners, and that violence and
coercion are acceptable means for men to achieve that, both towards
'their' women and 'their' children.¶ It is no longer socially acceptable
to openly state that women are the possessions of men, yet these ideas
were enshrined in law until relatively recently. Marital rape only
became illegal in Britain in 1991, Spain in 1992, and Germany in 1997.
While no longer legal or openly acceptable, marital rape is still
widespread and rarely punished. It is estimated that in Britain only 15%
of all rapes are reported to the police, and only 7% of those result in
conviction. According to the UN, of all the women killed globally in
2012 almost half were killed by their partners or family members. In
contrast, only 6% of killings with male victims were committed by
intimate partners or family members.¶ At the same time, women continue
to bear the brunt of domestic responsibilities despite increasingly also
going out to work. In many cases women are still, as the Russian
revolutionary Leon Trotsky put it, the 'slaves of slaves'. While in
Britain, for example, most studies show men accepting that they should
do an equal amount of domestic chores as women, there is still a
considerable gap between intentions and reality. One survey showed that
on average women did 17 hours a week of domestic chores (excluding
childcare) whereas men did less than six.¶ [It is true]{.underline},
therefore, [that men get some gain from women's disproportionate bearing
of the domestic burden]{.underline}, in having a few more hours leisure
time. **[The main gain, however, is for capitalism.]{.underline}** By
putting the main burden of domestic life, the bringing up of the next
generation (from which the future workforce is drawn), and caring for
the sick and elderly on women, they are removed from the responsibility
of society as a whole.¶ Power concentrated in the capitalist class¶ [To
suggest that power is not concentrated in one class is to completely
misunderstand the nature of capitalism.]{.underline} **[Today, wealth
and power is concentrated in fewer hands]{.underline}** -- the owners of
the major banks and corporations -- **[even than when Marx was
writing.]{.underline}** According to Oxfam, the richest 85 people on
earth -- a double-decker bus full -- have as much wealth as the poorest
half of the world's population. The richest 85 include five women and
one African, although white men predominate. Their role in society,
however, does not stem primarily from their colour or gender but that
they are part of a tiny super-wealthy ruling elite.¶ [**[The world's 100
biggest companies now control 70% of global trade.]{.underline}** [Even
if their boards of directors included]{.underline} ]{.mark}[many [more
black people]{.mark} or women [it would not make any material difference
to the exploitation suffered by the working class]{.mark} and poor
worldwide]{.underline}, **[[not least black
women]{.underline}]{.mark}**. Look at South Africa, where the
incorporation of a tiny minority of blacks into the capitalist class has
made no difference to the dire poverty suffered by the majority. And
capitalism is increasingly incapable of taking society forward. [**Many
of the [rights]{.mark}** partially **taken for granted by previous
generations in Europe**, [like a]{.mark} relatively [secure job, home
and pension, **are now things of the past.¶** ]{.mark}To say that
[**social relations**]{.mark} in modern society [are **capitalist
relations**]{.mark} is not to take an 'economic determinist' view of
society]{.underline}: arguing that every aspect of the 'superstructure'
of society -- the state, politics, culture, social attitudes and so on
-- are rigidly determined by the character of the economy. [On the
contrary, there is an inter-relationship between the two.]{.underline}
At the same time, [politics and social attitudes reflect not only the
current character of capitalism but also remnants of the past
and]{.underline} -- particularly in mass struggles of the working class
and the oppressed -- [the seeds of a potential better
future.]{.underline} Nonetheless, **[it is clear that [as long as we
live in a capitalist society]{.mark}]{.underline}**, where wealth and
power rests with the tiny elite who own and control industry, science
and technology, then **[[the superstructure of that society
will]{.underline}]{.mark}** also [**ultimately [reflect and act in the
interests of that]{.mark} [ruling elite.¶]{.mark}** [No amount of
demanding that people 'check their privilege' will eliminate social
attitudes generated and sustained by capitalism]{.mark}.]{.underline}
[While determined mass struggle can force capitalism to adapt to a
certain extent -- as]{.underline} has been the case [with LGBT rights,
equal pay legislation]{.underline} and other measures -- **[[permanent
and deep-rooted change]{.underline}]{.mark}**, particularly where it
threatens the functioning of capitalism, [**[will only be achieved by
the socialist transformation of society.¶]{.mark}** The horrific
bureaucratic degeneration and]{.underline} then [collapse of the Soviet
Union have obscured the importance of the Russian
revolution]{.underline} in giving a glimpse of what socialism would mean
for those suffering oppression. In Russia in 1917 the working class led
a movement of the oppressed which successfully overthrew capitalism for
the first, and so far, the only time. Russia's extreme poverty and the
isolation of the new workers' state led to its degeneration.
Nonetheless, in the early days it gave a glimpse of how a new society
could overcome oppressions that had existed for millennia.¶ [In
'backward' Russia, legal changes were introduced very quickly which were
many decades ahead of any capitalist country.]{.underline} These
included [universal suffrage, civil marriage and divorce]{.underline}
when requested by either partner, [equal pay, paid maternity leave, the
right to abortion and the legalisation of homosexuality.]{.underline}
[Oppressed nationalities were given the genuine right to
self-determination.]{.underline} Measures were taken to encourage
nationalities and cultures oppressed under tsarism, including the
development of a written form of some languages for the first time.¶ Of
course, legal or formal measures do not in themselves end oppression.
Decades after the passing of equal pay legislation in Britain, for
example, women still earn an average of £5,000 a year less than men.
Addressing women's oppression in the Soviet Union, Trotsky described how
legal equality was a step forward but actual equality in social
relations required a far more "deep-going plough", capable of providing
real economic equality and lifting the domestic burden from women, and
transforming social attitudes ingrained over millennia. A whole number
of measures began to be introduced in the aftermath of the Russian
revolution (including free childcare, communal restaurants and public
laundries) which, while never fully implemented due to the degeneration
of the Soviet Union, gave a glimpse of how the domestic burden could be
lifted. That, in turn, could have laid the foundations for the building
of a society based on women's equality.¶ [Many intersectionalists put
very little emphasis on campaigning for economic and practical measures
to lift the burden on women]{.underline}, instead [concentrating
overwhelmingly on social attitudes, and trying to create
spaces]{.underline} within society [that are free of
oppression.]{.underline} Yet **[freeing women from the heavy load of
being the carers, cooks and cleaners for the whole of society is an
essential prerequisite for ending women's oppression.]{.underline}**
[Twenty-first century capitalism]{.underline}, far from taking steps
towards this, [is driving in the opposite direction.¶ Austerity affects
women severely.]{.underline} It includes huge cuts in public services
that partially lifted some of the responsibilities that fall on women.
David Cameron's big society could be summed up as demanding that women
compensate for the cuts to health, child and elderly care by taking the
burden on themselves. This is a demonstration that under capitalism,
even where oppressed groups make gains, they are never guaranteed to be
permanent. [This also applies to the devastating, sometimes
life-threatening, consequences of austerity for disabled
people.¶]{.underline} Combating prejudice¶ [Pointing out the need for
fundamental change in society does not]{.underline} in any way
[downgrade the importance of combating oppressive]{.underline} and
reactionary [ideas]{.underline} and practices while we live in this
society, including within the workers' movement. **[However, [this
will]{.mark} by necessity [be a constant battle.]{.mark}]{.underline}**
[Intersectionalists call for 'safe spaces']{.underline} with zero
tolerance for anything considered an oppressive view. But it is utopian
to try and create a safe space which is sealed off from the society in
which we all live and are affected by[. [Turning inwards]{.underline}
]{.mark}[in order to concentrate on doing so -- [rather than turning out
to build a movement]{.mark} capable of winning real change -- [is
**doomed to** ]{.mark}**frustration and
[failure]{.mark}**[.]{.mark}]{.underline} Far from creating safe spaces,
this can often lead to an undemocratic environment, where the
individuals dominant in a particular 'space' assert that they feel
oppressed by ideas and opinions they disagree with.¶ [[There
is]{.underline}]{.mark} also [[a **dangerous tendency**]{.mark} to
suggest [that the **value of someone's contribution**]{.mark} to a
discussion [should be based]{.mark} **primarily [on what oppressions
they as an individual suffer from. This is completely
false]{.mark}.**]{.underline} Britain's first and only female prime
minister, [Margaret [Thatcher]{.mark}]{.underline}, [undoubtedly
[suffered]{.mark}]{.underline} individual oppression [[as a woman,
but]{.mark} the neo-liberal programme]{.underline} she drove through
[[was completely against the interests of working-class
women]{.mark}.]{.underline} Recently, Jeremy [Corbyn]{.underline}, the
new left leader of the Labour Party, [has been attacked]{.underline}
supposedly [for not having enough women in his shadow
cabinet]{.underline}, although his front bench is the first that has
been majority women. More women voted for Corbyn than for the other
right-wing candidates (two of whom were women) in the leadership
election because he stood against austerity. [Had he chosen a
pro-austerity woman]{.underline} as shadow chancellor rather than the
left MP, John McDonnell, [most]{.underline} of the women [who voted for
him would have]{.underline} correctly [been deeply
disappointed.]{.underline}¶ The issue of safe spaces also relates to
intersectionalists' views on gender: that the concept of two genders is
a social construct and, in reality, gender is more like a spectrum.
[Emphasis is often put on supporting transgender people]{.underline} and
all those who rebel against societal gender constraints. This includes
some who do not identify as either male or female but as
'gender-non-conforming'. [This reflects a positive rejection of current
gender relations]{.underline} and homophobia by a growing number of
young people. Socialists, of course, support the democratic right of
individuals to define both their own gender and sexuality. [However,
while there is radicalisation among an important layer on this issue,
that does not mean it is possible to create, as some intersectionalists
attempt, spaces within capitalist society completely free from societal
pressures regarding gender.¶ **[Cap]{.mark}italism [shapes the outlook
of all of us from the time we are born]{.mark}**]{.underline}, with all
of the distortions of the human personality that creates. [This includes
how we are expected to behave appropriately for our given
gender.]{.underline} It is not possible to fully escape this; in this
society capitalist gender roles are an objective reality. Even rejecting
capitalist gender norms means reacting to, and therefore being affected
by, those norms. It is not possible to prescribe exactly how human
relations, including the role of gender, would flower in the future when
freed from the rigid straitjackets imposed by capitalism.¶ The role of
the working class¶ **[[The crucial issue for anyone determined to end
oppression]{.underline}]{.mark}**, therefore, **[[is how to end
cap]{.mark}italism [and begin to build a world that is free of
oppression]{.mark}]{.underline}**: a 'safe space' for all. Today, just
as when Marx described [the working class]{.underline} as the 'grave
digger of capitalism', it [is the key force on the planet capable of
ridding us of this bankrupt system.]{.underline} [Both privilege theory
and [intersectionality would list social class]{.mark}]{.underline}
[]{.mark}-- what they would describe as 'classism' -- [as **one form of
oppression**.]{.underline} However, [it features [as one item on a
list]{.mark} and is often discussed in terms of the prejudice people
face because of having a working-class accent or postcode.]{.underline}
**[[The centrality of class]{.mark} in the structure of society [is not
recognised. The basic idea that a Nigerian worker would have more in
common with a worker in Britain]{.mark}]{.underline}** []{.mark}or the
US [**[than]{.underline}** t]{.mark}hey would **[with [Aliko
Dangote]{.mark}]{.underline}**, the only African to make it on to the
list of the richest 85 on the planet, **[[would not be
understood]{.mark}.]{.underline}** The fact that it is the working class
that is ultimately responsible for the creation of the capitalists'
profits and that by collective action it is capable of bringing
capitalist society to a halt is discounted as outmoded.¶ Yet [the
working class is not 'disappearing'.]{.underline} In fact, [it is
potentially stronger today than it was at the time of the Russian
Revolution.]{.underline} Many countries where workers were a tiny
minority of society a century ago now have large and powerful working
classes. In the economically advanced countries, like Britain,
deindustrialisation has meant that the industrial working class is much
smaller. However, there still remain groups of workers with enormous
power to bring society a halt when they strike -- anyone who lives in
London and witnessed the recent London Underground strikes knows that.
Deindustrialisation has not led to young people becoming 'middle class',
but has forced them into low paid, temporary work, often in the service
sector. At the same time, large sections of the population -- including
teachers and civil servants -- who would have previously considered
themselves middle class have been driven down into the ranks of the
working class in their living conditions and social outlook.¶ [The
history of the 20th century repeatedly demonstrated the preparedness of
working-class people to fight for socialism.]{.underline} [However, it
also demonstrated that **[the capitalist class]{.mark}** does all it can
to cling to power, not least by **[attempt]{.mark}ing [to divide and
rule by turning different sections of the working class against each
other]{.mark}.¶** In recent years, there has been increasing
radicalisation and struggle globally, including revolutionary
movements.]{.underline} Out of these, largely unsuccessful, struggles
conclusions will begin to be drawn about **[what is
necessary]{.underline}** to change society. That **[requires a mass
revolutionary movement]{.underline}**, bringing together different
sections of the working class -- with different experiences and outlooks
-- **[in a mass party with a clear programme and a determined and
accountable leadership.¶]{.underline}** Such a party would not be a
model of a new society, but a tool to bring it about. Nonetheless, it is
crucial that such a mass party would include in its ranks all of the
most oppressed sections of the working class and that it is a vibrant
and democratic force in which all participants feel able to express
their views. Its programme, as was the case with the Bolsheviks in
Russia, has to fight for the rights not just of the working class in
general but also for different specifically oppressed groups.¶
Undoubtedly, such a movement would also win the support of wide sections
of the middle class and even individuals from the capitalist class who
saw the need for a break with capitalism. This would particularly
include those who suffer oppression under capitalism and who recognise
that the only way to end homophobia, racism or women's oppression is to
join the struggle for a new society.¶ Struggle itself unifies¶ [It would
be ludicrous and deplorable to argue that those fighting their
particular oppression should hold back and 'wait' for a unified
struggle]{.underline} of the whole working class. **[[Mass struggle is a
thousand times more effective than exhortations to individuals to change
their attitudes]{.mark} in winning social progress.]{.underline}** It is
always the case that [[a movement has]{.mark} a [greater chance of
success if it]{.mark} is able to [reach out to other sections of the
working class]{.mark}]{.underline}, and that therefore it is important
that the programme put forward by a particular movement attempts to do
this. However, that is in no way to suggest that any group should
artificially delaying fighting back until they, for example, convince
more white or male workers of their cause.¶ [Nonetheless, [to
permanently end racism in the US]{.mark}]{.underline}, for instance,
[[will require ending capitalism and]{.mark} will]{.underline} therefore
[have to involve a struggle [uniting different sections of the working
class]{.mark}]{.underline} []{.mark}-- black, Hispanic, Asian and white.
[This is a practical question.]{.underline} [The African American
population]{.underline}, who suffer the worst police racism, are 13% of
the population and [will not be able to win alone. The capitalist class
will try to increase divisions]{.underline} between different sections
of the oppressed, particularly at times of heightened struggle. The
oppressed need to increase their strength by trying to maximise unity.
The \$15 Now movement in the US, and the election of Socialist
Alternative member Kshama Sawant in Seattle, give a glimpse of the
growing possibilities in the US to build a united workers' movement.¶
Achieving unity does not mean downplaying the importance of combating
the specific oppressions different groups in society face. On the
contrary, it is vital that socialists campaign for the workers' movement
to fight to take up every aspect of oppression. The Socialist Party has
a proud history of doing this -- for example, spearheading the Campaign
Against Domestic Violence in the 1990s which was central to getting the
trade unions to take the issue up.¶ Intersectionality on university
campuses in Britain has had a tendency to turn campus feminist societies
inwards, focusing on a fruitless attempt to grade degrees of oppression
rather than fighting to end it. However, many of those initially
attracted to these ideas are searching for a way to change society and
will quickly come up against the limits of identity politics in all its
forms.¶ One small indication of this is the popularity among young
people of the film Pride, which tells the true story of Lesbians and
Gays Support the Miners (LGSM). LGSM recognised the common ground
between their struggle against the Tories and that of the 1984/85
miners' strike. Their attempt to support the miners was not without
difficulties -- with prejudices on both sides -- but ultimately forged a
real unity. LGSM understood that a victory for the miners would have
been a massive defeat for Thatcher, the Tories and the capitalist class
-- and that was in the interests of LGBT people. They never once
responded to white, straight miners, who were often initially
homophobic, by telling them to 'check their privilege'. One result of
their heroic efforts was big parts of the workers' movement
wholeheartedly taking up the struggle for LGBT liberation, including
National Union of Mineworkers lodges from across the country leading the
1985 Pride demonstration.¶ The miners' strike was a major event in the
class struggle in Britain, but it will be dwarfed by events that will
take place in the future against the background of a crisis-ridden
capitalism trying to drive the living standards of the majority into the
dirt. [For some intersectionalists it will require witnessing the power
of the working class in action in order for them to draw the conclusion
that the route to ending their specific oppression is not as part of
fragmented separate groupings but by throwing their lot in with the
class struggle. However, growing numbers of young people, particularly
when they become active in concrete struggles, are already being
attracted to socialist ideas as the only way to achieve real liberation
for all humanity.]{.underline}

### Rt Cause (AB)

#### Critical readings of anti-Blackness can't explain the world \-\-- only a [capitalist analysis]{.underline} can explain the production and perpetuation of racism.

**Camfield 16** -- Associate Professor of Labour Studies & Sociology at
University of Manitoba and a PhD in Social and Political Thought at York
University \[David, "Elements of a Historical-Materialist Theory of
Racism," *Historical Marxism*, Vol. 24, Issue 1 16, p. 31-70, Emory
Libraries\]

[The key question]{.underline} in dealing with the persistence of racism
is not how racial oppression is reproduced, though it is vital to be
able to show this in order to avoid falling into functionalism; 124
racism is reproduced in a myriad of ways in various situations, as has
been demonstrated in detail by anti-racist researchers. Nor is it a
question of locating a 'material basis' for racism, since such a framing
of the problem assumes that racism is an ideology rather than a social
relation. Rather, the question [is why does racial oppression remain a
major feature of matrices of social relations in the contemporary
world?]{.underline}

Some [critical [race analysis]{.mark}]{.underline}, influenced by
poststructuralism, does not go beyond [identifying the pervasiveness of
'race thinking']{.underline} -- [as]{.underline} Sherene Razack puts it,
'[a structure of thought that divides up the world between the deserving
and the undeserving according to descent']{.underline}. 125 While this
phenomenon is both real and significant, naming it does not explain the
persistence of racism in a way satisfactory to defenders of any kind of
materialism. Eduardo Bonilla-Silva offers a materialist explanation that
is widely shared among contemporary anti-racist researchers:

> Racial structures remain in place for the same reasons that other
> structures do. Since actors racialised as 'white' -- or as members of
> the dominant race -- receive material benefits from the racial order,
> they struggle (or passively receive the manifold wages of whiteness)
> to maintain their privileges. In contrast, those defined as belonging
> to the subordinate race or races struggle to change the status quo (or
> become resigned to their position). Therein lies the secret of racial
> structures and racial inequality the world over. They exist because
> they benefit members of the dominant race. 126

This explanation has more than a grain of truth to it, as I will argue.
However, it [[is inadequate]{.mark} because [it **fails to
identify**]{.mark} **any [connection between]{.mark} specific features
of [capitalism and]{.mark} the persistence of [racism]{.mark}** or to
make distinctions about who benefits from racism and how]{.underline}.
But some historical materialists deny that this kind of explanation has
any validity whatsoever. Callinicos argues that 'the Marxist claim' is
that 'the forces and relations of production, a complex set of
historically developed and changing powers, explain relations of
domination.' 127 [There are two problems with this
approach]{.underline}. The [first]{.underline} is that [it equates an
explanation of the origins of a form of oppression with an explanation
of its persistence]{.underline}. I believe that **[the [genesis of
racial oppression can be explained by historical analysis of forces and
relations of production]{.mark}]{.underline}**. However, as Mills
argues, 'genealogy does not necessarily translate into continuing causal
pre-eminence'. 128 The **[second]{.underline}** is that [it treats forms
of oppression as generating no properties that contribute to their own
persistence]{.underline}. However, there is considerable evidence that
they do. This is why Esch and Roediger contend that 'understanding
racism necessitates a separate and distinct perspective on power
relations beyond the terms of class'. For example, they suggest that
'racist acts are sometimes or maybe often acts of racial empowerment,
rather than of class disempowerment' 129 -- an insight that many Marxist
accounts of racism and white workers do not acknowledge because they
lack a concept of racial privilege. While it is better to treat such
acts as often being about both 'racial empowerment' and 'class
disempowerment' rather than one or the other, Esch and Roediger's point
about the limits of treating racism as explicable solely with reference
to the forces and relations of production is clear. In their spirit, I
suggest that racism's persistence today can be explained as flowing from
three deeply-rooted features of contemporary society that are interwoven
in reality but analytically distinguishable: imperialism, the profits of
racism, and efforts to defend or enhance racial privilege.

Imperialism

[[Imperialism is an essential dimension of]{.mark} the
[capitalist]{.mark} mode of [production]{.mark}]{.underline}. [[The
system develops]{.mark} in an uneven and combined manner]{.underline}
both in time and space, [[with 'spatial cycles of development]{.mark} at
one pole and underdevelopment at another']{.underline}. 130 [This is a
consequence of differential profits, which can lead to 'a
self-reinforcing process that gives rise to privileged concentrations of
high-productivity capital']{.underline}. 131 [The [ensuing
**domination**]{.mark} **of the globe [by capitalist
imperialism]{.mark}** [has been interwoven with racism]{.mark} almost
from its inception]{.underline}. 132 A result of this fact has been
histories in which, as Susan Ferguson has argued,

> **[[People become \[negatively\] racialised]{.underline}]{.mark}**
> insofar [[as they are **associated**]{.underline}]{.mark}. . .
> **[[with]{.mark} other [socio-geographic
> spaces]{.mark}]{.underline}**. [[The 'other,']{.underline}]{.mark} of
> course, [[is relative -- and]{.mark} determined]{.underline} largely
> [by]{.underline} the historical configuration of
> [geo-political]{.underline} and social [relations]{.underline}. . . .
> So while [people]{.underline} are necessarily 'territorialised' by
> matter of their birth (we are all born and live somewhere), they [are
> **[only racialised as a function of how their location figures in
> the]{.mark} broader [socio-geo-political ordering of
> capitalism]{.mark}**]{.underline}. 133

Today [[imperialism]{.mark} reproduces]{.underline}, Winant writes, '[a
worldwide pattern of employment discrimination, violence, morbidity,
impoverishment, pollution, and unequal exchange]{.underline}'. [**This
[is 'a global system of social stratification' that 'correlates]{.mark}
very well [with racial criteria]{.mark}**: the darker your skin is, the
less you earn; the shorter your life span, the poorer your health and
nutrition, the less education you can get]{.underline}.' 134 Even if we
set aside the contentious issue of unequal exchange and assert the huge
importance of class divisions within imperialised countries, 135
Winant's correlation still matters. Even when explicitly racist ideology
is absent today, [imperialism reproduces 'an already racialised
structural distribution of property and economic power]{.underline} . .
. [which is the product of the long history of global racialised
dispossession']{.underline}. 136 Moreover, imperialism today frequently
operates in ways that treat the populations of imperialised countries as
different in inherent and unalterable ways. This makes their oppression
by imperialism racial in character. While in the twenty-first century
the differences used to mark imperialised populations are not always
posited explicitly as ones of inferiority, [[imperialised populations
are]{.mark} in practice routinely [treated as]{.mark} essentially
[culturally deficient]{.mark}]{.underline}. [This can be seen in the
**neoliberal ideology** of international development's depiction of the
people of imperialised countries as mired in irrational
culture]{.underline}. 137 [The treatment by imperialist state officials
of Muslims and Arabs as essentially pre-modern, religious and irrational
is another case in point.]{.underline} 138 Such racialised imperialist
practices and ideologies are also influential within the borders of
imperialist countries; [they powerfully condition how state managers
structure immigration controls and politically administer the portions
of their populations who have migrated from imperialised countries or
who are descended from such migrants or enslaved ancestors]{.underline}.
139 This in turn has a broad influence on the ideological environment in
advanced capitalist countries.

The Profits of Racism

The mediation of capitalism by racism almost from its very beginning 140
that was registered in the preceding paragraph can also be seen in the
history of how production has been socially organised. The massive use
of racialised African slavery and Asian indentured migrant labour was
succeeded in the twentieth century by new flows of immigration from
imperialised countries. Today these flows increasingly involve migrants
from imperialised countries engaging in unfree or highly precarious wage
labour. As Ferguson and David McNally note,

> What is unique about the neoliberal period, therefore, is not that
> \[negatively\] racialised labour-power is appropriated from the
> peripheries of the global system. That has been a constant of the
> capitalist mode of production. Instead, [the key development has been
> the massive expansion of the global labour reserve as a result of the
> most accelerated and extensive processes of primitive accumulation in
> world history]{.underline}. 141

[Across the history of capitalism]{.underline}, then, [employers have
often dealt with [working classes stratified by racial
hierarchies]{.mark}]{.underline} (and simultaneously by divisions rooted
in patriarchal and other forms of oppression), which they have
frequently cultivated directly or indirectly. 142 They have done so and
often continue to do so in large part **[[because racism is conducive
to]{.mark} higher [profitability]{.mark}]{.underline}**. This is true in
a number of ways. [First, a workforce divided by racism is [less able to
resist managerial control]{.mark}, which allows employers to extract
more effort from workers]{.underline}. [Second, labour-market
competition among workers divided by racism can result in workers placed
lower in a racial hierarchy being willing to work for lower wages and/or
in ways preferred by employers than workers ranked above them in the
racial order]{.underline}. 143 [This can extend to workers at the bottom
of a racial hierarchy being willing to take jobs that other workers are
unwilling to do because the work is seen as so undesirable]{.underline}.
[It is possible for [employers]{.mark} to successfully ['use
race]{.mark} as a sorting mechanism [in]{.mark} their **[pursuit
of]{.mark} increased [productivity']{.mark}**]{.underline}, with
particular skills or capacities linked to specific racial groups,
thereby reducing training costs. 144 Finally, [the weakening of the
social power of the working class]{.underline} (not simply solidarity at
the point of production) **[by racism facilitates capitalist
profitability]{.underline}**. 145 It is admittedly easier to argue
convincingly that the existence of racism contributes to profit-making
than to show that this in part actually explains the contemporary
perpetuation of racial oppression; the latter is important in order to
avoid functionalist explanations of racism's persistence. Nevertheless,
the frequency with which employers use perceived racial identity as a
sorting mechanism in dealing with job applications and play workers off
against each other along racial lines lends support to this claim. So
too does the [widespread opposition of capitalists]{.underline} and
their political advocates [to measures that would substantially improve
the bargaining power of racially oppressed workers in labour markets,
such as granting citizenship or permanent-resident status to non-status
migrants]{.underline} and those with temporary residency rights and
instituting effective anti-racist reforms to employment law. 146

### AT: Cap Inevitable---2NC

#### the aff's justification of capitalism is founded in pointing to the evil of the alternative as a reason for the status quo which normalizes crisis and precludes imagining any world outside capitalism 

**Fisher 9** (Mark, cultural theorist and professor at Department of
Visual Cultures at Goldsmiths, University of London, *Capitalist
Realism*, chapter 1)

What is unique about the dystopia in Children of Men is that it is
specific to late capitalism. This isn\'t the familiar totalitarian
scenario routinely trotted out in cinematic dystopias (see, for example,
James McTeigue\'s 2005 Vfor Vendetta). In the P.D. James novel on which
the film is based, democracy is suspended and the country is ruled over
by a self-appointed Warden, but, wisely, the film downplays all this.
For all that we know, the authoritarian measures that are everywhere in
place could have been implemented within a political structure that
remains, notionally, democratic. **[The War on Terror has prepared us
for such a development: [the]{.mark} [normalization of crisis]{.mark}
[produces a situation in which the repealing of measures]{.mark}
[brought in to deal with]{.mark} an [emergency becomes
unimaginable]{.mark} (when will the war be over?)]{.underline}**
Watching Children of Men, we are inevitably reminded of the phrase
attributed to Fredric Jameson and Slavoj Žižek, that **[[it is easier to
imagine the end of the world than]{.mark} it is to imagine [the end of
capitalism]{.mark}]{.underline}**. [That slogan captures precisely what
I mean by [\'capitalist realism\']{.mark}: [the]{.mark} widespread
[sense]{.mark} [that]{.mark} [not only is capitalism the only viable
political and economic system, but also that it is]{.mark} now
[impossible]{.mark} even [to imagine]{.mark} [a]{.mark} coherent
[alternative to it]{.mark}.]{.underline} Once, dystopian films and
novels were exercises in such acts of imagination - the disasters they
depicted acting as narrative pretext for the emergence of different ways
of living. Not so in Children of Men. The world that it projects seems
more like an extrapolation or exacerbation of ours than an alternative
to it. In its world, as in ours, ultra-authoritarianism and Capital are
by no means incompatible: internment camps and franchise coffee bars
co-exist. In Children of Men, public space is abandoned, given over to
uncollected garbage and stalking animals (one especially resonant scene
takes place inside a derelict school, through which a deer runs).
Neoliberals, the capitalist realists par excellence, have celebrated the
destruction of public space but, contrary to their official hopes, there
is no withering away of the state in Children of Men, only a stripping
back of the state to its core military and police functions (I say
\'official hopes since neoliberalism surreptitiously relied on the state
even while it has ideologically excoriated it. This was made
spectacularly clear during the banking crisis of 2008, when, at the
invitation of neoliberal ideologues, the state rushed in to shore up the
banking system.)

[The catastrophe in Children of Men is neither waiting down the road,
nor has it already happened. Rather, it is being lived
through]{.underline}. **[[There is no punctual moment of
disaster]{.mark}; [the world]{.mark} doesn\'t end with a bang, it winks
out, [unravels]{.mark}, [gradually falls apart]{.mark}.]{.underline}**
[[What caused the catastrophe to occur]{.mark}, who knows; its cause
[lies long in the past]{.mark}, so absolutely [detached from the
present]{.mark} as to seem like the caprice of a malign being: a
negative miracle, a malediction which no penitence can ameliorate.
**[Such a blight can only be eased by an intervention that can no more
be anticipated than was the onset of the curse]{.mark} in the first
place**]{.underline}. Action is pointless; only senseless hope makes
sense. Superstition and religion, the first resorts of the helpless,
proliferate.

But what of the catastrophe itself? It is evident that the theme of
sterility must be read metaphorically, as the displacement of another
kind of anxiety. I want to argue this anxiety cries out to be read in
cultural terms, and the question the film poses is: how long can a
culture persist without the new? What happens if the young are no longer
capable of producing surprises?

Children of Men connects with the suspicion that the end has already
come, the thought that it could well be the case that the future harbors
only reiteration and re-permutation. Could it be that there are no
breaks, no \'shocks of the new\' to come? Such anxieties tend to result
in a bi-polar oscillation: the \'weak messianic\' hope that there must
be something new on the way lapses into the morose conviction that
nothing new can ever happen. The focus shifts from the Next Big Thing to
the last big thing - how long ago did it happen and just how big was it?

T.S. Eliot looms in the background of Children of Men, which, after all,
inherits the theme of sterility from The Waste Land. The film\'s closing
epigraph \'shantih shantih shantih\' has more to do with Eliot\'s
fragmentary pieces than the Upanishads\' peace. Perhaps it is possible
to see the concerns of another Eliot - the Eliot of \'Tradition and the
Individual Talent\' - ciphered in Children of Men. It was in this essay
that Eliot, in anticipation of Harold Bloom, described the reciprocal
relationship between the canonical and the new. The new defines itself
in response to what is already established; at the same time, the
established has to reconfigure itself in response to the new. Eliot\'s
claim was that the exhaustion of the future does not even leave us with
the past. Tradition counts for nothing when it is no longer contested
and modified. A culture that is merely preserved is no culture at all.
The fate of Picasso\'s Guernica in the film - once a howl of anguish and
outrage against Fascist atrocities, now a wall-hanging - is exemplary.
Like its Battersea hanging space in the film, the painting is accorded
\'iconic\' status only when it is deprived of any possible function or
context. No cultural object can retain its power when there are no
longer new eyes to see it.

We do not need to wait for Children of Men\'s near-future to arrive to
see this transformation of culture into museum pieces. [[The power of
capitalist realism derives]{.mark} in part [from the way]{.mark} that
[capitalism subsumes]{.mark} and consumes [all of previous
history]{.mark}: one effect of its \'system of equivalence\' which can
assign all cultural objects, whether they are religious iconography,
pornography, or Das Kapital, a monetary value]{.underline}. Walk around
the British Museum, where you see objects torn from their lifeworlds and
assembled as if on the deck of some Predator spacecraft, and you have a
powerful image of this process at work. [In the conversion of practices
and rituals into merely aesthetic objects, the beliefs of previous
cultures are objectively ironized, transformed into artifacts.
[Capitalist realism is]{.mark} therefore not a particular type of
realism; it is more like [realism in itself]{.mark}.]{.underline} As
Marx and Engels themselves observed in The Communist Manifesto,

\[Capital\] has drowned the most heavenly ecstasies of religious fervor,
of chivalrous enthusiasm, of philistine sentimentalism, in the icy water
of egotistical calculation. It has resolved personal worth into exchange
value, and in place of the numberless indefeasible chartered freedoms,
has set up that single, unconscionable freedom --- Free Trade. In one
word, for exploitation, veiled by religious and political illusions, it
has substituted naked, shameless, direct, brutal exploitation.

[Capitalism is what is left when beliefs have collapsed at the level of
ritual or symbolic elaboration, and all that is left is the
consumer-spectator, trudging through the ruins and the relics. Yet this
turn from belief to aesthetics, from engagement to spectatorship, is
held to be one of the virtues of capitalist realism]{.underline}. In
claiming, as Badiou puts it, to have \'delivered us from the \"fatal
abstractions\" inspired by the \"ideologies of the past\'[\",
[capitalist realism presents itself as a shield protecting us
from]{.mark} the [peril]{.mark}s posed by belief itself.]{.underline}
The attitude of ironic distance proper to postmodern capitalism is
supposed to immunize us against the seductions of fanaticism. [[Lowering
our expectations, we are told, is a small price to pay for being
protected]{.mark} from terror and totalitarianism]{.underline}. \'We
live in a contradiction,\' Badiou has observed:

a brutal state of affairs, profoundly inegalitarian - where all
existence is evaluated in terms of money alone - is presented to us as
ideal. [[To justify their conservatism]{.mark}, the [partisans]{.mark}
of the established order cannot really call it ideal or wonderful. So
instead, they have decided to [say that]{.mark} all [the rest is
horrible]{.mark}. Sure, they say, [we may not live in]{.mark} a
condition of [perfect Goodness]{.mark}. [But we\'re lucky that we don\'t
live in]{.mark} a condition of [Evil]{.mark}. Our [democracy is not
perfect]{.mark}. [But it\'s better than]{.mark} the bloody
[dictatorships]{.mark}. [Capitalism is unjust]{.mark}. [But
it\'s]{.mark} [not]{.mark} criminal like [Stalinism]{.mark}. We let
millions of Africans die of AIDS, but we don\'t make racist nationalist
declarations like Milosevic. [We kill Iraqis with]{.mark} our
[airplanes]{.mark}, [but we don\'t cut their throats]{.mark} with
machetes like they do in Rwanda,]{.underline} etc.

[The [\'realism\']{.mark} here [is analogous]{.mark} [to the]{.mark}
deflationary perspective of a [depressive]{.mark} [who believes that any
positive state]{.mark}, any hope, [is a dangerous
illusion]{.mark}.]{.underline}

back [into **disempowered singularities**]{.mark}]{.underline}.3 [The
movement's decline]{.underline} (which began well before Occupiers were
evicted) [exposes the impasse confronting the Left]{.underline}. The
**[[celebration of autonomous individuality prevents us from
foregrounding]{.mark} our [commonality and organizing]{.mark} ourselves
[politically]{.mark}]{.underline}**.

At the same time and together with the global wave of popular unrest,
[the collective energy of Occupy at its height nevertheless points to an
"idea whose time has come]{.underline}." [[People are moving together
in]{.mark} growing [opposition to]{.mark} the
**[policies]{.mark}**]{.underline} and practices of states [**organized
[in the interest of capital]{.mark} as a class**. [Crowds are forcing
the Left to return]{.mark}]{.underline} again [[to]{.mark} questions of
**[organization, endurance, and scale]{.mark}**. Through what political
forms might we advance?]{.underline} For many of us, **[[the party is
emerging as]{.mark} the site of [an answer]{.mark}]{.underline}**.

**[[Against]{.mark} the [presumption]{.mark} that [the individual is the
fundamental unit of politics]{.mark}]{.underline}**, I focus on the
crowd. Across the globe, [[crowds are]{.mark} pressing their opposition
and **[rupturing the status quo]{.mark}**]{.underline}, the actuality of
their movement displacing the politics of identity. Bringing together
thinkers such as Elias Canetti and Alain Badiou, I highlight the
"egalitarian discharge" of the crowd event as an intense experience of
substantive collectivity. I make fidelity to this event the basis for a
new theory of the communist party. [Because global movements
are]{.underline} themselves [pushing us to consider the possibilities in
and of the party form, we have to **recommence imagining the party of
communists**]{.underline}.4 Who might we be and become as an
international revolutionary party again, in our time? To think clearly
about these questions, we need to consider the party form unfettered by
the false concreteness of specific parties in the contingency of their
histories. Liberals and democrats are not the only political theorists
who can reflect on their modes of association in the abstract.
Communists must do this as well.

As a means of breaking out of the binaries of reform or revolution, mass
or vanguard party that historically have inflected discussions of the
party form, I approach the function and purpose of the communist party
psycho-dynamically. I draw from Robert Michels and Jacques Lacan to
think through the affects the party generates and the unconscious
processes it mobilizes. The role of the party isn't to inject knowledge
into the working class. Nor is it to represent the interests of the
working class on the terrain of politics. Rather, [[the function of the
party is to]{.mark} hold open a gap in our setting so as to **[enable a
collective desire for collectivity]{.mark}**]{.underline}.5 ["Through
such a gap or moment]{.underline}," Daniel Bensaïd writes, "[can arise
the unaccomplished fact, which contradicts the fatality of the
accomplished fact]{.underline}."6 [[The crowd's breach of the
predictable]{.mark} and given **[creates]{.mark} the
[possibility]{.mark} that [a political subject might appear]{.mark}**.
The party steps into that breach and fights to keep it open for the
people]{.underline}.

Canetti makes a point I return to throughout the book: **[[crowds come
together for the sake of]{.mark} an [absolute
equality]{.mark}]{.underline}** felt most intensely in a moment he
refers to as the "discharge." Akin to Lacan's notion of "enjoyment"
("jouissance," the only substance known to psychoanalysis), the
discharge provides a material ground for the party. [[The party]{.mark}
is a body that [can carry the egalitarian discharge after]{.mark} the
[crowds disperse]{.mark}]{.underline}[, [channeling
its]{.underline}]{.mark} [divisive [promise of justice into **organized
political struggle**]{.mark}]{.underline}.

**Khan '16** (Abraham Iqbal, Assistant Professor of Communication @
University of South Florida, "A rant good for business: Communicative
capitalism and the capture of anti-racist resistance," *Popular
Communication: The International Journal of Media and Culture*, Volume
14.1)

[The problem with [neoliberalism]{.mark} is not that it asks us to be
anti-racist]{.underline} as such, [but that it [demonizes collective
action]{.mark}, occludes class consciousness, and forestalls the
formation of plausible solidarities.]{.underline} The critical move that
connects anti-racism to anti-capitalism is to account for the mechanisms
that help anti-racism depoliticize the marketplace. **[[Opposing
neoliberalism requires attention to]{.underline}]{.mark}** what Jodi
Dean calls **[[communicative capitalism, an enticement to play politics
without doing it, to delight in political speech
without]{.underline}]{.mark}** the work involved in organizing and
**[[forming coalitions]{.mark}.]{.underline}** As Dean (2009) puts it,
communicative capitalism is defined by "the materialization of ideals of
inclusion and participation in information, entertainment, and
communication technologies in ways that capture resistance and intensify
global capitalism" (p. 2). Marxist critics like Adolph
[Reed]{.underline} (2013) [worry that the hunt for institutional racism
works to "graft more complex social dynamics onto a simplistic and
frequently psychologically inflected racism/anti-racism political
ontology"]{.underline} (p. 12). Reed's concern is that anti-racism
centers oppositional politics around the wrong antagonism by promoting
the racial diversification of capital. At the same time, anti-racist
critics of neoliberalism notice the ways in which those very same
complex social dynamics are deeply racialized. The idea of communicative
capitalism resolves this impasse in oppositional politics by recognizing
that **[[legitimation and obfuscation are opposite sides of the same
coin.]{.underline}]{.mark}** [By promising universal access and
unfettered mobility, [communication technologies deliver participation
to]{.mark} previously [excluded social groups]{.mark} and then
[register]{.mark} the fact of [participation as politics
itself.]{.mark}]{.underline} []{.mark}Anti-racist grievances are easily
heard, but also quickly evaporate. Participation validates market wisdom
and effaces the market's racial effects. This point addresses the gap
between racism as it was diagnosed and racism as it was practiced in the
aftermath of Sherman's postgame rant. A handful of hateful tweets
offered the sports media the opportunity to exhibit their anti-racist
credentials in torrents of self-referential speech. The sheer amount of
media attention paid to Sherman after his postgame interview was itself
the subject of media attention, a kind of meta-attention expressed in
the suggestion that Sherman had "broken the internet."1 Dean (2009)
observes that on the internet, "media circulate and extend information
about an issue or event, amplifying its affect and seemingly its
significance. This amplification draws in more media, more commentary,
and more opinion, more parody and comic relief, more attachment to
communicative capitalism's information and entertainment networks such
that the knot of feedback and enjoyment itself operates as (and in place
of) the political issue or event" (p. 32). Sports media illustrated this
dynamic relative to the way audiences were invited to interpret
Sherman's rant. As Tommy Tomlinson (2014) admitted in Forbes, "raw
emotion---whatever form it takes---is exactly what I hope for."
ThinkProgress's Travis Waldron (2014) agreed that "it might be a little
unfair to expect anything else than raw, honest emotion right after that
game is finished." Beyond simply circulating a burst of anti-racist
indignation, this commentary distilled Sherman's display into pure
affect. Dean (2009) contends that [[communicative capitalism "reformats"
political energy "to speaking and saying]{.mark} and exposing and
explaining, a reduction key to a democracy conceived of in terms of
discussion and deliberation"]{.underline} (p. 32).
**[[This]{.underline}]{.mark}** kind of **[[discourse produces the
illusion that something political is going on, while "reinforcing the
hold of neoliberalism]{.underline}]{.mark}**'s technological
infrastructure" (Dean, 2009, p. 32). This is not to say that racist
epithets are undeserving of rebuttal, but that the [disproportionate
response performs neoliberalism's injunction to reduce politics to
"dialogue" and "awareness."]{.underline} ESPN's Ian O'Connor interviewed
Sherman for an article one week after the NFC championship game.
Insisting that "Richard Sherman did us all a favor," O'Connor (2014)
argued that "by raging against the stereotype of the black athlete, he
encouraged a helpful discourse on the language of race in sports. And by
informing those who wouldn't guess otherwise that he's really a nerd, at
heart, with a Stanford degree, Sherman showed kids in Compton, Calif.,
and other American cities like it that they should never let anyone hang
a low ceiling over their dreams." At a basic rhetorical level, O'Connor
illustrates how the definition of a "helpful discourse" about race
requires the associated fantasy of social mobility that sustains
neoliberal hegemony. O'Connor asked Sherman if "he felt he'd inspired a
healthy conversation about the language of black and white in sports."
Sherman's reply animated the fantasy through an unmistakable cultural
trope: "I think it did have some effect on opening up the channels of
communication and conversation and dialogue \[...\] I want people to
understand that everybody should be judged by their character, and who
they are as a person, and not by the color of their skin." The echo of
Martin Luther King in this context evokes the idea that the barrier
impeding the path out of America's iconic ghetto assumes the form of
race as such, located in a culture of race, distorting colorblind
judgment. Colorblindness, of course, here tells its paradigmatic lie,
but "when communication serves as the key category of left politics,
whether communication be configured as discussion, spectacle, or
publicity, this politics ensures its political failure in advance: doing
is reduced to talking, to contributing to the media environment" (Dean,
2009, p. 32). However "helpful," O'Connor's line of reasoning misses the
investment that anti-racism makes in dialogue as such. Put differently,
Richard Sherman is good for the dialogue business. Deadspin revealed a
lively conversation about thug-ness, but their failure to provide any
meaningful context to the 625 televised utterances of "thug"
subordinated the content of any argument to the ongoing accumulation of
contributions. Sherman's defenders were quick to discredit Twitter as
both inimical to meaningful dialogue and inclined to abet racist
expression. Despite Twitter's insipid work as a "dry brush," said Paola
Boivin (2014) of the Arizona Republic, "the sheer volume of discussion
catapults the story into a stratosphere that suggests greater
importance." The discussion, in other words, alerts us to itself.
Twitter may trivialize and oversimplify but it also activates a
determination to drown racist talk in an ocean of conversation. Zirin
placed Sherman's intervention into the historical context that marks the
horizon of race politics in sport. Regarding Sherman's hypothesis that
"thug" is a stand-in for "the n-word," Zirin (2014b) said, "Richard
Sherman said something that has needed to be said since Jack Johnson
commented that he would be Jim Jeffries's 'master' a mere 40 years after
the end of slavery \[...\] It has needed to be said since Muhammad Ali
said, 'I don't have to be what you want me to be.'" The comparison was
meant to reveal Sherman's "ability to use words as weapons and spit
arguments as easily as he spits insults. That makes him interesting.
That makes him provocative. That makes him dangerous" (Zirin, 2014b).
Even if "danger" here refers to a multicultural platitude about
colorblindness, Sherman is said to have resonated within a furious
political buzz. [Dean]{.underline} sees somewhat less disruptive
potential. She [claims that the transformation of messages into
contributions is homologous to the distinction between use value and
exchange value in capitalism]{.underline} (Dean, 2009, p. 27).
**[[Messages are oriented to]{.mark} the [understanding, whereas
contributions are oriented to circulation]{.mark}, their value derived
from their movement through the communication network, where only "the
popularity, the penetration and duration of a contribution, marks its
acceptance or success"]{.underline}** (Dean, 2009, p. 27). Decodings of
"thug" traveled through the "rapidly moving and changing flow of
content" as contributions carrying the exchange value required for our
attention, interest, and energy (Dean, 2009, p. 28).

Hardt and Negri turned left defeat into [an opportunity to reimagine
[communist politics]{.mark}]{.underline}. This reimagining **[[needs to
go further]{.underline}]{.mark}**. It can go further [[by highlighting
**division**]{.mark}**, antagonism, [and]{.mark} political
[organization]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Nearly forty years after the
collapse of the Soviet Union, the wide array of politicized issues and
identities enables a [[communism]{.underline}]{.mark} that, more fully
than ever before, [can **take the side of the oppressed**]{.underline},
indeed, that [[can]{.underline} **[make]{.underline}**]{.mark} [**the
[multiple struggles of the oppressed into a side]{.mark}**[. It's
imperative]{.mark} that **[multiplicity not replace class but be
understood as a class characteristic]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Let me
explain.

[The vision of [a multitude of incommunicable
struggles]{.mark}]{.underline} theorized by Hardt and Negri and held up
in appeals to democracy [**[replaces]{.mark} the [antagonism of class
struggle with pluralization]{.mark}**, creativity, [and
becoming]{.mark}, thereby **[flattening]{.mark} out and immediatizing
the [terrain of struggle]{.mark}**. Such a rendering of each strike as
equivalent **obliterates differences** in resources, histories, and
opportunities]{.underline}, [effacing the uneven development of
capitalism]{.underline}. It obscures the dimension of time, as if
struggles occurred in discreet bursts rather than building, unfolding,
advancing, and retreating. [And it disavows the tensions within
struggles]{.underline}, as if histories of oppression left no trace on
those who organize to dismantle the arrangements of power that continue
them. In effect, **[[the goal becomes]{.underline}]{.mark}**, as in
communicative capitalism itself, [**the [production of]{.mark} the many,
the multitude of [singularities]{.mark}**[. The political effect
is]{.mark} a **[failure to build a concentrated]{.mark} political
[force]{.mark}** [with]{.mark} the sustained [capacity to]{.mark}
**confront and [replace]{.mark} the [capitalist]{.mark} mode of
[production]{.mark}**. [Instead, there are **small
battles**]{.mark}]{.underline}, policy options, [[and **cultural
interventions**]{.mark}, **[victories that can be absorbed]{.mark}** and
defeats that can be forgotten]{.underline} [(when they aren't fetishized
as yet another instance of inevitable left failure). [To the
extent]{.mark} that **[pluralization]{.mark}**]{.underline}---and the
moves to fragment and individuate that accompany it---[**[is a
left]{.mark} political [priority]{.mark}**[, politics becomes]{.mark}
**passionately [attached to the small and weak]{.mark}**. This gives us
the shape of the Left we have in the long tail of
micro-initiatives]{.underline}.

The new cycle of struggles has demonstrated the [political
[strength]{.mark}]{.underline} that [[**comes from collectivity**.
Common]{.mark} names, [tactics]{.mark}, and images are
**[bringing]{.mark} the [fragments together]{.mark}**, making them
legible as many fronts of one struggle against capitalism.
[Where]{.mark} the **[proliferation of]{.mark}**]{.underline} issues and
**[[identities disperses and weakens
us]{.underline}]{.mark}**---[inciting]{.underline} the snark that
glorifies itself as [critique even as it **undermines
solidarity**]{.underline}--- [the [crowd events]{.mark} of the last
decade [are forcing a new sense of collective
power]{.mark}]{.underline}. Th

ey have pushed expectations of multiplicity into experiences of
collectivity. [The question]{.underline} that emerges from these
experiences [is how they might endure and extend]{.underline}, how the
momentary discharge of equality that crowds unleash might become the
basis for a new process of political composition.

[**[The party]{.mark}** suggests itself as a mode of association
appropriate to such a process. It [offers a political form that
spans]{.mark} multiple [levels and domains]{.mark}]{.underline}.
Typically, parties scale across local, regional, national, and sometimes
international levels. Rather than stuck in the local or confined to the
abstractions of the global, [the party is an organizational form
operative on different scales]{.underline}; indeed, its
success---electorally or otherwise---depends on this capacity. Further,
[parties are carriers of the knowledge that comes with political
experience]{.underline}. Whether this knowledge is local---histories of
relationships, of practices, of who knows whom, what, where, and
how---or larger---knowledge of resource extraction and the structure of
industry, of civil wars in far off places, of racial histories, of the
challenges of social reproduction, of programming, database
construction, and design---parties recognize the breadth and depth of
knowledge important for political struggle and rule. Providing a body
for a knowledge that exceeds what any one person can know, the party
takes a position on that knowledge. [[It fits issues into]{.mark} a
platform such that they are not so many contradictory and individual
preferences but]{.underline} instead **[[a]{.mark} broader [vision for
which it will fight]{.mark}]{.underline}**. What is sometimes dismissed
as [[party bureaucracy]{.underline}]{.mark} thus [[needs to be]{.mark}
revalued as an **[institutional capacity]{.mark} necessary [for
political struggle and rule]{.mark}**]{.underline} in a complex and
uneven terrain.

The [electoral success of Syriza, Greece's coalition of the radical
Left, points to the new relevance of the party form]{.underline}. The
Greek legacy of intense party politics is a unique feature of its
political culture. Nevertheless, Syriza's initial victories stemmed in
part from innovations in communist party organizing: commitment to
social movements, respect for movements' autonomy, support of local
solidarity networks, and enough involvement in institutions "to seem
capable of transforming the balance of forces at the level of national
political life."43 For some Lefts, particularly in the US and UK, it is
this last feature that has been conspicuously absent. Hence, our actions
fail to gain momentum. Crowds amass, but they don't endure. In contrast,
Syriza's initial achievements demonstrated a dynamic relation between
crowd and party: the crowd that pushes the party to exceed expectations,
the party that finds the courage of the people in the haste of the
crowd.

Three additional aspects of Syriza's political opening contribute to
rethinking the party today. The first concerns the limits of political
victory confined to the level of the nation-state. The institutions not
only of Europe but of global finance and governance restrict national
governments' range of maneuver. This poses challenges to the Left
internationally, suggesting, at a minimum, the necessity of strong left
alliances and coordinated institutional strategies. More maximally it
directs us toward the party as an infrastructure for such alliances and
strategies. The second aspect involves defeat. [No party will be
everything to everyone]{.underline}. Just as individuals are internally
divided and contradictory, split among conscious and unconscious
desires, so is a party---like any institution---a body that is not
self-identical. Political forms aren't pure. [To expect perfection is to
displace politics into an imaginary realm sheltered from difference and
disappointment. Despite Syriza's inability to deliver on its
promises]{.underline} (or, more strongly, despite its betrayal of the
very supporters who mobilized in its behalf), [it nevertheless **shifted
the terrain of the possible**]{.underline}. Because of Syriza, the
European, British, and North American Left have a sense of political
possibility they previously lacked. Common sense has shifted, as is
apparent in the political rise of Jeremy Corbyn in the UK and Bernie
Sanders in the US. The third aspect of Syriza's political opening
instructive for the Left concerns political will. Kouvelakis writes,
"The Podemos experience in Spain as well as Syriza in Greece shows that
[**[if the radical Left makes suitable proposals]{.mark}**, then [it
can]{.mark} arrive at an understanding with these movements and [provide
a credible]{.mark} political ['condensation' of]{.mark} their
[demands]{.mark}."]{.underline} The [[making]{.underline}]{.mark} of
"[suitable [proposals" **depends on political will, a Left able to put
aside**]{.mark} **its [differences]{.mark}, organize, [and think]{.mark}
strategically [about]{.mark} the [pursuit of political power]{.mark}**.
The problem posing itself today concerns less the details of party
organization]{.underline} (membership requirements, centralization
versus networked structure, mechanisms for accountable leadership) [than
it does **solidary political will**. Can the Left's wide array of
associations come together in a way that will achieve a real political
advance?]{.underline}

The supposition of Crowds and Party is that **[we have no choice but to
answer "yes]{.underline}**." To help us get to yes, to make a party of
communists seem compelling to more of us again, I offer an approach to
the party inspired by the crowd. Faithful to the egalitarian rupture of
the crowd event, [the communist party holds open the gap through which
the people appear as the political subject]{.underline}. Readers
anchored in the classics of revolutionary socialism might balk at what
seems at first glance to be an abandonment of Marxist terms. They
shouldn't. The "people" has a rich legacy in Marxism-Leninism- Maoism:
the "people" are the revolutionary alliance of the oppressed (in
contrast to the populist rendering of the people as an organic unity).
Under conditions of communicative capitalism, crowds are the
proletarianized many, those whose communicative engagements are
expropriated from them in processes of accumulation and dispossession
that benefit capital as a class. [Readers]{.underline} inspired by
radical democratic, anarchist, and post-Marxist theories [might balk at
a return to the party. They shouldn't. **The party is a basic form of
political struggle**]{.underline}. If innovation is necessary for
finding our way out of the current political impasse, then the party,
too, can be a site for experimentation and change.

Typically, socialist and communist discussions of the party gel around
the themes of reform or revolution, mass or vanguard, factory or state.
These discussions are too limiting. Missing is the affective dimension
of the party, the way that the perspective of the party operates through
different organizational terrains. [The party knots together unconscious
processes across a differential field to enable a communist political
subjectivity]{.underline}. To think through these processes as the
effects of collectivity back upon itself, I draw out the psychodynamics
of the party. [**Providing a strength and direction we would otherwise
lack**, the party generates the practical optimism through which
struggles endure]{.underline}.

**[[Many eschew the party]{.mark} as a form for political
power]{.underline}**, decision, and organization. [**[They fall back
into]{.mark} the [affirmation of individual autonomy, reasserting
capitalist ideology]{.mark}**. Discarding the party form, [they
**jettison**]{.mark} **the [possibility of building collective
power]{.mark}**]{.underline}. I demonstrate how [the power the party
unleashes is the power we already have to change the world]{.underline}.

**Fisher 9** (Mark, cultural theorist and professor at Department of
Visual Cultures at Goldsmiths, University of London, *Capitalist
Realism*, chapter 2)

**[What if you held a protest and everyone came?]{.underline}**

In the cases of gangster rap and Ellroy, capitalist realism takes the
form of a kind of super-identification with capital at its most
pitilessly predatory, but this need not be the case. In fact,
[capitalist realism is very far from precluding a certain
anticapitalism]{.underline}. After all, and as Žižek has provocatively
pointed out, **[[anti-capitalism is]{.mark} widely [disseminated in
capitalism]{.mark}]{.underline}**. [Time after time, [the villain
in]{.mark} Hollywood [film]{.mark}s [will turn out to be the \'evil
corporation\']{.mark}. Far from undermining capitalist realism, this
[gestural anti-capitalism]{.mark} actually [reinforces it.
Take]{.mark}]{.underline} Disney/ Pixar\'s [[Wall-E]{.underline}]{.mark}
(2008). The film [shows an earth so despoiled that human beings are no
longer capable of inhabiting it. We\'re left in no doubt
that]{.underline} consumer capitalism and corporations - or rather [one
mega-corporation, Buy n Large - is responsible for this depredation; and
when we see eventually see the human beings in offworld exile, they are
infantile and obese, interacting via screen interfaces, carried around
in large motorized chairs, and supping indeterminate slop from cups.
What we have here is a vision of control and communication much as
**Jean** **Baudrillard understood it, in which [subjugation]{.mark} no
longer takes the form of a subordination to an extrinsic spectacle, but
rather [invites us to interact and participate]{.mark}**[.]{.mark} It
seems that the cinema audience is itself the object of this
satire]{.underline}, which prompted some right wing observers to recoil
in disgust, condemning Disney/Pixar for attacking its own audience. [But
this kind of **irony feeds rather than challenges capitalist
realism.**]{.underline} A film like [[Wall-E
exemplifies]{.underline}]{.mark} what Robert Pfaller has called
[[**\'interpassivity\': the film performs our anti-capitalism for us,
allowing us to continue to consume with impunity**. The role of]{.mark}
capitalist [ideology is]{.mark} not to make an explicit case for
something in the way that propaganda does, but [to conceal]{.mark} the
fact [that]{.mark} the [operations of capital do not depend on]{.mark}
any sort of [subjectively assumed belief]{.mark}]{.underline}. It is
impossible to conceive of fascism or Stalinism [without
propaganda]{.underline} - but [[capitalism can proceed perfectly
well]{.mark}, in some ways better, [without anyone making a case for
it]{.mark}.]{.underline} Žižek\'s counsel here remains invaluable[. \'If
the concept of ideology is the classic one in which the illusion is
located in knowledge\', he argues,]{.underline}

[then today\'s society must appear post-ideological: the prevailing
ideology is that of cynicism; people no longer believe in ideological
truth; they do not take ideological propositions seriously. The
fundamental level of ideology, however, is not of an illusion masking
the real state of things but that of an (unconscious) fantasy
structuring our social reality itself. And at this level, we are of
course far from being a post-ideological society. **Cynical distance is
just one way \... to blind ourselves to the structural power of
ideological fantasy**: even if we do not take things seriously, even if
we keep an ironical distance, we are still doing them.]{.underline}

[[Capitalist ideology]{.mark} in general]{.underline}, Žižek maintains,
**[[consists]{.mark} precisely [in the overvaluing of]{.mark} belief -
in the sense of [inner subjective attitude -]{.mark}]{.underline}** [[at
the expense of]{.mark} the [beliefs we exhibit and externalize in our
behavior**. So long as we believe (in our hearts) that capitalism is
bad, we are free to continue to participate in capitalist
exchange**]{.mark}**.**]{.underline} According to Žižek,
**[[capitalism]{.mark} in general [relies on this structure of
disavowal.]{.mark} We believe that money is only a meaningless token of
no intrinsic worth, yet we act as if it has a holy value. Moreover, this
behavior precisely depends upon the prior disavowal - we are able to
fetishize money in our actions only because we have already taken an
ironic distance towards money in our heads.]{.underline}**

[[There is]{.mark} of course a close [relationship]{.mark}]{.underline}
[[between]{.mark} bureaucracy - the discourse of [officialdom - **and

examples of the big Other at work: a low-level official who, having not
been informed of a promotion, says \'Sorry, I have not yet been properly
informed about this new measure, so I can\'t help you\...\'; a woman who
believed that she was suffering bad luck because of the number of her
house, who could not be satisfied by simply repainting a different
number herself, because \'it has to be done properly, by the responsible
state institution\...\']{.underline} **[[We are]{.mark} all [familiar
with bureaucratic libido]{.mark}, with [the enjoyment that certain
officials derive from this position of disavowed responsibility (\'it\'s
not me, I\'m afraid, it\'s the regulations\').]{.mark}]{.underline}**
[The frustration of dealing with bureaucrats often arises because they
themselves can make no decisions; rather, [they are permitted only to
refer to decisions that have alwaysalready been made (by the big
Other)]{.mark}.]{.underline} Kafka was the greatest writer on
bureaucracy because he saw that [**this structure of [disavowal was
inherent to bureaucracy]{.mark}**[. The quest to reach the ultimate
authority]{.mark} who will finally resolve K\'s official status [can
never end,]{.mark}]{.underline} **[[because the big Other cannot be
encountered in itself]{.mark}: there are [only officials,]{.mark} more
or less hostile, [engaged in]{.mark} acts of [interpretation

of interpretation, [these deferrals of responsibility, are all that the

change **is not because we are deceived, but [because we enact apathy
despite ourselves]{.mark}.**]{.underline} In other words, the
relationship between the resistive subject and ideology is not one of
false consciousness, but one of cynicism: [[we are]{.mark} not
misdirected by shallow spectacles, but instead somehow [distracted by
our cynical belief that we are being "distracted"]{.mark}.]{.underline}
In this section, I begin by outlining the concept of cynicism as it has
been theorised by Peter Sloterdijk and Slavoj Žižek. This then leads us
to an analysis of the cynical position adopted by Brand's critics, which
I argue actually demonstrates more political problems on the part of the
left than those suggested by Brand himself.¶ For Sloterdijk, cynicism is
an attitude that emerges right at the centre of the enlightenment
project, where, in contrast to a modernist illumination of truth, "a
twilight arises, a deep ambivalence" (1987, p. 22). Rather than the
promised heightened consciousness of science that would allow us to see
the hidden essential truths behind appearances, the very conception of
truth as unconcealedness (aletheia)3 instead creates a widespread
mistrust and suspicion of every appearance. Subsequently, ["[a new form
of realism bursts forth]{.mark}]{.underline}[,]{.mark} a form that is
[[driven by the fear of becoming deceived or overpowered]{.underline}
...]{.mark} [everything that appears to us could be a deceptive
manoeuvre of an overpowering evil enemy"]{.underline} (Sloterdijk, 1987,
p. 330). The surface becomes suspect and the subject therefore retreats
from all appearances: judging them to be spectacles that are seeking to
oppress through falsity. The result is cynicism.¶ Subsequently, [[this
leads]{.underline}]{.mark} Sloterdijk [to]{.underline} his well-known
paradoxical definition of [cynicism as "enlightened false
consciousness"]{.underline} which he describes as [a "modernized,
unhappy consciousness on which enlightenment has laboured both
successfully and in vain ... it has learned its lessons in
enlightenment, but it has not, probably was not able to, put them into
practice"]{.underline} (1987, p. 5). In other words, **[in the search
for a higher consciousness behind appearances, [the subject is
paradoxically "duped" by their very suspicion of being
duped.]{.mark}]{.underline}** Furthermore, **[[because the subject
thinks they "know" that appearances are just a mask, they disbelieve the
truth when it does appear]{.mark}.]{.underline}** Like the story of the
Emperor's New Clothes, [they fancy themselves to know what is right in
front of their eyes (that the emperor is nude and vulnerable) yet they
choose "not to know" and don't act upon it]{.underline} (they still act
as if the emperor is all-powerful). As such,¶ cynical reason is no
longer naïve, but is a paradox of enlightened false consciousness: one
knows the falsehood very well, [one is well aware of a particular hidden
interest hidden behind the ideological universality, but still one does
not renounce it.]{.underline} (Žižek, 1989, p. 23)¶ [The audience to the
parade of power can see that the emperor is not divine]{.underline} --
just a fragile human body like the rest of us -- yet they cynically
choose not to know and objectively retain his aura. **[[They
congratulate themselves on "knowing"]{.mark} that Brand is a trivial
spectacle, [yet they choose to remain apathetic towards]{.mark} his
[calls for action]{.mark}.]{.underline}**¶ As such, [the dismissive
reaction to Brand **reveals a regressive interpassive tendency of the
left to subjectively treat ourselves as "enlightened" to authentic
politics and yet objectively render ourselves passive.** In a kind of
defence mechanism, the left believes that it]{.underline}¶ [can avoid
becoming the dupe of the latest fashion or advertising trend by treating
everything as]{.underline} a matter of [fashion and advertising,
**reassuring ourselves** as we flip through television
channels]{.underline} or browse through the shopping mall [that **at
least we know what's really going on.**]{.underline} (Stanley, 2007, p.
399)¶ [The critics disbelieve Brand, distrusting his motives and seeing
him as inauthentic, yet they continue to "believe" objectively in their
own marginalisation.]{.underline} As such, **[[the cynical left believe
they are dismissing shallow spectacle in the direction of a stronger
authentic radicalism, yet what their "doing believes" is the maintenance
of their apathetic position.]{.underline}]{.mark}** More precisely,
**[it maintains the attitudes of left melancholy and
anti-populism.]{.underline}**¶ [The problem of "left melancholy" points
towards the forever-delayed search for authenticity]{.underline} on the
part of a cynical left that is in mourning. Coined by Walter Benjamin
(1998), [the concept points towards "the revolutionary who
is]{.underline}, finally, [attached more to a particular political
analysis or ideal]{.underline} -- even to the failure of that ideal --
[than to seizing possibilities for radical change]{.underline} in the
present" (Brown, 1999, p. 19). [Suffering from a history of defeat and
embarrassment, **the left persist in a narcissistic identification with
failure**]{.underline}, fetishising the "good old days" and remaining
faithful to lost causes. As Benjamin himself points out, the cynical
kernel of this attitude is clear, as "melancholy betrays the world for
the sake of knowledge ... but in its tenacious self-absorption it
embraces dead objects in its consumption in order to redeem them" (1998,
p. 157). In other words, [the sentiment is a deliberate self-sabotage
that takes place even before politics proper has a chance to
begin]{.underline} or "the paradox of an intention to mourn that
precedes and anticipates the loss of the object" (Žižek, 2001, p. 146).¶
[This]{.underline} then [leads us to the second problem]{.underline} of
leftist cynicism: [anti-populism.]{.underline} As a result of
melancholia, [the left has developed the bad habit of prejudging all
instances of popular radical expression]{.underline} (such as Brand's)
[as necessarily flawed.]{.underline} However, to return to Dean again,
she points out that **[this aversion to being popular and successful is
a defining feature of a contemporary left, who prefer to adopt an
"authentic" underdog position in advance than take risks towards
political power.]{.underline}** As she argues, ["we" on the left see
"ourselves" as "always morally correct but never politically
responsible"]{.underline} (Dean, 2009, p. 6) **[prepositioned as
righteous victims and proud political losers from the
outset.]{.underline}** What this cynicism towards instances of popular
radicalism ultimately means, therefore, is that any concern for
authenticity is ultimately a regressive one, a defence mechanism for a
left that "as long as it sees itself as defeated victims, can refrain
from having to admit is short on ideas" (Dean, 2009, p. 5). [[Such an
attitude means never risking potential failure and residing in the
safety of marginal righteousness.]{.underline}]{.mark}¶ It is the
contention here, therefore, that both melancholia and anti-populism can
be seen in the cynical reaction to Brand's radicalism. Somewhat
ironically, Brand (2013) even recognised these problems himself when he
wrote in his *New Statesman* piece that¶ the right seeks converts while
the left seeks traitors ... this moral superiority that is peculiar to
the left is a great impediment towards momentum ... for an ideology that
is defined by inclusiveness, socialism has become in practice quite
exclusive.¶ Automatically, then, the left denounce Brand and
self-proclaimed "radical left-wing thinkers and organisers" bitterly
complain how he is getting so much attention for the arguments they have
been making for years (for example, Park & Nastasia, 2013). The left
maintain distance and label Brand trivial, yet such a distance only
renders these critiques even more marginal and prevents them from
becoming popular, effective or counter-hegemonic.¶ As Žižek has pointed
out, [the political issue of cynicism is "not that people 'do not know
what they want' but rather that cynical resignation prevents them from
acting upon it]{.underline}, with the result that a weird gap opens up
between what people think and how they act", adding that "today's
post-political silent majority is not stupid, but it is cynical and
resigned" (2011, p. 390). In terms of Brand, [this blanket cynical
melancholy is typical of the left's distrust of anything popular,
rendering them "like **the last men" whose "immediate reaction to
idealism is mocking cynicism"**]{.underline} (Winlow & Hall, 2012, p.
13). [[Proponents of a radical alternative]{.mark} immediately adopt
caution with the effect of [forever delay]{.mark}ing [change, holding
out for that real and authentic (unbranded) struggle and therefore
denying it indefinitely.]{.mark}]{.underline}

### Accountability Measures

#### state and capital are like that big spherical robot from the Incredibles- direct action insurrection makes the government more flexible and fosters biopolitical control

[[With the militarization of]{.mark}]{.underline} municipal, regional
and national [[police forces in the USA]{.underline}]{.mark} and other
OECD countries (one here can think about the overly aggressive display
of military-grade weaponry in response at Ferguson, Missouri or Keene,
New Hampshire to civil rights protest or student mayhem that was not
wholly unlike that of Egyptian military and police forces in Tahrir
Square), [[new global trends of social control and organization, rooted
in resilient styles of governance, are gelling in the turbulence of
insurrectionality]{.underline}]{.mark}. [Add to these rapid response
forces, [the securitized surveillance system of closed-circuit
television, cybertracking, biometric scanning, and addressable
individual tracking devices]{.mark}; and, the withering away of many
other streams of popular ideological resistance as corrective feedback
loops, the powers that be, have been, and will be seem, if they are
truly sophisticated, to be adding insurrection to their risk society
calculi]{.underline}. Indeed, these new integers for innovation justify
building and enforcing a potent mix of resilience tactics, which are
tested as ideology and practice for continued elite empowerment.
[[Rising up in the streets against authority in the fury of intense
insurrection is acceptable]{.mark}, but standing up slowly to truly
assume power has become much less likely.]{.underline} Still, the
collapse of economic growth, the decay of middle and working class job
opportunities, civic infrastructure decay, loss of public goods, and
degradation of private markets are all generating and maintaining a high
level of insurrectional energy (Luke, 2012 Luke, T. W. (2012).
"Informatic spatiality, electronic agency, cybernetic structure and the
new people power: Occupy movements at play in network systems," Fast
Capitalism, 9(1). Retrieved from www.fastcapitalism.com. ). [Now the
elite discourses embedded in the reproduction of existing power
structures knowingly accedes to insurrection, and even can concede
conceptually, its justifiable bases, which endorses its existence as
'insurrectionable development\'. Instead of a 'clash of
civilizations\']{.underline} (Huntington, 1996 Huntington, S. (1996).
The clash of civilizations and the remaking of order. New York, NY:

recurrent anarchy are the nuts and bolts needed for 'governing the
present\']{.underline} (Miller & Rose, 2008 Miller, P. & Rose, N.
(2008). Governing the present: Administering economic, social and
personal life. Cambridge: Polity. ). [**[Governance games on this scale
harness legitimate corrective impulses from the outsiders, underclasses,
and superfluous populace to make improvements in some state and
non-state services, which usually enhance systemic resilience, regime
stability, and the sustainability of ruling alliance/elite/bloc/class
power]{.underline}** (]{.mark}Guattari & Negri, 2010 Guattari, F. &
Negri, A. (2010). New lines of alliance, new spaces of liberty.
Brooklyn, NY: Automedia. ). Are insurrections---both peaceful and
violent instances of direct action---crucial opportunities for policy
innovations? They seem to appear as fluid zones of indeterminate
determination where layers of opposition and acceptance arguably are 'at
once economic, political, and cultural---and hence they are biopolitical
struggles, struggles over the forms of life ... creating new public
spaces and new forms of community\' (Hardt & Negri, 2000 Hardt, M. &
Negri, A. (2000). Empire. Cambridge, MA: Harvard University Press. , p.
56). Likewise, do insurrections reconfigure 'the organization of the
social worker and immaterial labor\' in which 'bodies are on the front
lines of this battle, bodies that consolidate in an irreversible way the
results of past struggles and incorporate a power that has been gained
ontologically\' (Hardt & Negri, 2000 Hardt, M. & Negri, A. (2000).
Empire. Cambridge, MA: Harvard University Press. , p. 410) stand ready
to OWS, but are they also truly unable to ever manage Wall Street? Along
these lines, [insurrection becomes yet one more reflexive dimension of
modernity\'s disciplinary modulations of individual and collective human
life]{.underline}. State authority rationally maps, and then manages the
degrees of freedom allowed in the life of its subjects or citizens
through the dispositifs at work in many embedded institutions woven into
the territorial fabric of states. [The command and control containments
of these degrees of unruly freedom, which are clearly allowed to human
life by state power, unevenly meld sovereignty, territoriality, and
population as new resistant-and-resilient coproductions of
governmentality]{.underline} (Foucault, 1978 Foucault, M. (1978). The
history of sexuality, volume I: An introduction. New York, NY: Random
House. ). Hence, [[resilience-ready rulers often use popular direct
action effectively to ensnare the population in 'apparatuses of
security\', like those created by various police forces, homeland
security units, public health measures]{.mark}, etc., [in a manner such
that these events also address 'health, education and social welfare
systems and the mechanisms of the management of the national
economy\']{.mark}]{.underline} (Dean, 1999 Dean, M. (1999).
Governmentality: Power and rule in modern society. London: Sage. , p.
20). In turn, can these governmentalizations of insurrectionable
developments settle into 'the juridical and administrative apparatuses
of the state in all of the ways that optimize the health, welfare and
life of populations\' as biopolitical formations (Dean, 1999 Dean, M.
(1999). Governmentality: Power and rule in modern society. London: Sage.
, p. 20)? Quite clearly, this complex style of resilient response must
be studied, since the emergent regimentations of governance practices
have 'a technical or technological dimension\' with new adaptive
strategies that display 'characteristic techniques, instrumentalities
and mechanisms through which such practices operate, by which they
attempt to realize their goals, and through which they have a range of
effects\' (Dean, 1999 Dean, M. (1999). Governmentality: Power and rule
in modern society. London: Sage. , p. 21). Seeing insurrectionality as a
tactical move for the defense of fluid, global and unstable public order
follows from Foucault\'s vision of the apparatuses of government. The
problematization of insurrectionable developments as constructive
moments of collective purpose seconds his sense of the world today,
namely,  ... not that everything is bad, but that everything is
dangerous, which is not exactly the same as bad. If everything is
dangerous, then we always have something to do. So my position leads not
to apathy but to hyper- and pessimistic activism. (Foucault, 1997
Foucault, M. (1997). The essential works, 1954--1984, vol. 1 ethics,
subjectivity and truth (Paul Rabinow, Ed.). New York, NY: The New Press.
, p. 256) The division of social forces into 'insurrectionists\' that
are continuously tracked by 'anti-insurrectionist\' security assessment
experts, working as 'threat assessment teams\' to assay 'teeming
assessable threats\' confirms this consciousness of everything merely
being dangerous, and thereby producing a fluid new social order out of
constant flexible imperatives that assure all they will have 'something
to do\'. Strangely, 'endangerment\' becomes a new operational baseline
assumption for making the advances of 'development\'. Are these
strategies leading to more secure order, or only securitizing everyday
life to accustom citizens to living on the minimal basis they appear to
accept? They are unruly wards protected by quasi-police state power, who
permit the public to protest the conditions of their confinement in
advocacy networks within and across borders, but always remain at the
mercy of the same resilient power practitioners (Keck & Sikkink, 1998
Keck, M. & Sikkink, K. (1998). Activists beyond borders: Advocacy
networks in international politics. Ithaca, NY: Cornell University
Press. ). Ironically, [[insurrectionality]{.underline}]{.mark} serves
multiple purposes; but, most importantly, its practices [[sustain
resilient state networks for ruling elites, and this]{.mark} link
[cultivates]{.mark} the expected outcomes---a barely passable life for
the masses trapped in shells of [passivity, dependency, and inaction
that remarkably are regarded by far too many citizens, clients or
consumers as the freedoms of insurrectional agency.]{.mark}]{.underline}

### Analysis 

#### The aff's intra-local "disruptive analysis" of contemporary social hegemony sounds appealing, but it forecloses debates about difficult institutional choice -- their suspicion about using the state to create social change means they make checking neoliberalism impossible

**Barnett 10**

(Clive, Professor of Geography and Social Theory at the University of
Exeter in the UK, "The politics of behaviour change", September 3, 2010,
http://clivebarnett.wordpress.com/2010/09/03/the-politics-of-behaviour-change-2/)

Another plug, this time for a Theme Issue of the journal Environment and
Planning A, on the topic of Ethical Foodscapes. I was asked to write a
short commentary on the papers in this collection, and ended up using
this an excuse to try to say something coherent about 'the politics of
behaviour change' - the papers in the collection all engage, in
different ways, with ongoing attempts to influence individual patterns
of consumption by fiddling with the backgrounds of food practices. This
is just one field in which [the issue of how and whether to influence
people's conduct to achieve various [']{.mark}public goods' has become
central to contemporary politics]{.underline} and governance. There is a
great research project investigating this phenomenon, based at
Aberystwyth, on the time-spaces of soft paternalism. **[Behaviour change
is all over]{.underline}** the place these days -- in **[climate change
debates]{.underline}**, in obesity agendas, amongst the Research
Councils who fund science and social science in the UK - it's all the
rage in policy circles, not just in government but also amongst
think-tankers and NGOs. The House of Lords Select Committee has just
announced an inquiry into how ideas about behaviour change are working
in government. [What I find most interesting]{.underline} about all this
[is the challenge this seems to present to styles of 'critical' social
science analysis]{.underline} -- Elizabeth Shove has an interesting
reflection on this issue, also in Environment and Planning A earlier
this year, which focusses on how 'attitude-behaviour-change' models of
governance tend to marginalise insights of social theory. It is
interesting, certainly, to track the ways in which certain [scientific
and social scientific fields are being 'sourced' for authoritative
models of how to intervene to bring about social change]{.underline} --
[the most obvious example being]{.underline} the [selective use of
neuroscience]{.underline}, along with the popularisation of behavioural
economics by Thaler and Sunstein's Nudge. There is a cross-over here
between academic research fields and popular discourse too; think of
Malcolm Gladwell's books, the success of Freakonomics, or my favourite,
Simon Kuper and Stefan Szymanski's Soccernomics - a book which uses
simple statistical analysis to develop some interesting explanations and
make some entertaining predictions about how success in national and
international football is determined (interestingly, this book was
published in the UK under the title Why England Lose: And other curious
phenomena explained -- the difference in the title between the UK and US
version is indicative of the current popularity of this style of popular
social science beyond any particular specialised interest).¶ [[There is
an easy default position that]{.mark} this style of [thinking about
influencing people is inherently sinister]{.mark}, since it explicitly
seeks to get at people through less-than-fully-rational
means]{.underline} -- [by]{.underline} either [designing change into
infrastructures, or by deploying affective styles of
communication]{.underline}. This seems to circumvent a basic principle
of persuading people of the reasons to change through rational argument.
[Behaviour change initiatives are all about 'manipulating' the contexts
in which people exercise choice and discretion. They seem to be designed
to confirm]{.underline} the model of ['governmentality']{.underline}
developed by Michel Foucault, of a mode of power which works by shaping
the contexts of individuals' conduct without directly intervening in
that conduct. Of course, the question that Foucault doesn't necessarily
help us with is how to know when it is a problem that your conduct is
being configured, 'nudged', in certain ways, and when it isn't. There is
a tendency of course to read Foucault as a theorist of social control,
but **[I think the proliferation of behaviour change initiatives is one
occasion to re-visit the 'politics' of using Foucault]{.underline}**.
The anthropologist James Ferguson has recently argued that [there is a
real political stake at play in]{.underline} seemingly arcane
[differences between conceptualisations of neoliberalism as a hegemonic
project of class-power, informed by Marxist theorists]{.underline} such
as David Harvey, [and neoliberalization as a contingent assemblage of
varied 'arts of government', informed by governmentality
theory]{.underline}, in the work of Aihwa Ong for example. **[One reason
not to reconcile these approaches]{.underline}** -- not to think that
Foucault provides a nice micro-analysis of the 'how' of neoliberalism,
while Marxism still holds the secrets to explaining the real interests
driving the 'why' (an argument made by Bob Jessop) -- [is because [the
governmentality approach draws into view the 'critical' imperative to
think through **the possibilities of alternative 'arts of
government'**]{.mark}]{.underline}. Quite **[[a lot of sexy
theory]{.mark} these days [doesn't]{.mark} like to [do this, preferring
stylized images of contestation and disruption]{.mark}]{.underline}**.
This is why [the default reading of behaviour change, as a sinister way
of controlling people's actions in the interests of]{.underline} more
[neoliberalism]{.underline}, more [consumerism]{.underline}, more
[responsibilization]{.underline}, [doesn't seem convincing]{.underline}
to me -- **[it seems to close down the more difficult form of [analysis
which would ask about]{.mark} the possibility of [using devices and
discourses of 'behaviour change' for different
purposes]{.mark}]{.underline}**, or **[[in more democratically
accountable fashion]{.mark}.]{.underline}**

### Anti-Governmentality 

#### **The 1AC's reading of governmentality mystifies power relations that are formulated on the basis of labor. Their understanding of power as productive is a self referential theory of power that has no way of offering an alternative relationship between the oppressed and the oppressor, makes revolution impossible.** 

**Schulman 11** (Jason\[on the editorial board of New Politics and the
editor of Rosa Luxemburg: Her Life and Legacy. His new book is
Neoliberal Labour Governments and the Union Response: The Politics of
the End of Labourism\], 3/26/11, "In Defense of Grand Narratives",
Jacobin,
<https://www.jacobinmag.com/2011/03/in-defense-of-grand-narratives>)

However, [the "productivist" version of Marxism so often attacked by
postmodernists cannot be said to have been purely the invention of
the]{.underline} Second and Third [Internationals]{.underline}. Various
[writings by Marx give the impression that he considers material
production to be the sole and autonomous motor force of history, and
consciousness a mere "reflex]{.underline}" and "echo": "In this
framework, relations of authority and the ideational forms of social
intercourse can be analyzed solely in terms of whether they foster or
fetter the development of the forces to the progressive technological
self-objectification of the species."8 Marx writes in The German
Ideology that [These various conditions]{.underline}, which appear first
as conditions of self-activity, later as fetters upon it, [form in the
whole evolution of history a coherent series of forms of
intercourse]{.underline}, the coherence of which consists in this: in
the place of an earlier form of intercourse, which has become a fetter,
a new one is put, corresponding to the more developed productive forces
and, hence, to the advanced mode of the self-activity of individuals ---
a form which in its turn becomes a fetter and is then replaced by
another. [Since these conditions correspond at every stage to the
simultaneous development of the productive forces, their history is at
the same time the history of the evolving productive forces taken over
by each new generation, and is, therefore, the history of the
development of the forces of the individuals themselves]{.underline}.9
[It is not difficult to see how such texts could be interpreted as "a
kind of technological evolutionism, where socialism becomes the enforced
result of the irresistible advance of the capitalist productive forces
themselves]{.underline}, and revolution becomes simply the moment of
transition . . . to the unfettered development of the productive
capacity of the species."10 Jean [Baudrillard aims his barbs in The
Mirror of Production at precisely this "Marxist"
productivism]{.underline}. His fundamental argument is put forth in the
book's first chapter, "The Concept of Labor": Radical in its logical
analysis of capital, Marxist theory nonetheless maintains an
anthropological consensus with the options of Western rationalism in its
definitive form acquired in eighteenth century bourgeois thought.
Science, technique, progress, history --- in these words we have an
entire civilization that comprehends itself as producing its own
development and takes its dialectical force toward completing humanity
in terms of totality and happiness. Nor did Marx invent the concept of
genesis, development and finality. He changed nothing basic: nothing
regarding the idea of man producing himself in his infinite
determination, and continually surpassing himself toward his own end.11
[Baudrillard is correct to challenge the assumption that liberating
productive forces equals liberating humanity]{.underline}. [It is a
logic that led Marx to write articles]{.underline} for the New York
Daily Tribune [that come close to apologias for British rule in
India]{.underline}, "progressive" in its development of the productive
powers. [It led Lenin to praise German]{.underline} capitalism's
productive [infrastructure]{.underline} and Taylorist scientific
management, [to claim that ultimately "productivity of labor is the most
important]{.underline}, the principal thing for the victory of the new
social system. Capitalism created a productivity of labor unknown under
serfdom. Capitalism can be utterly vanquished by socialism creating a
new and much higher productivity of labor."12 [It led Trotsky to define
Stalinist Russia as a "workers' state]{.underline}," albeit a
"degenerated" one, precisely [because it was developing productive
forces while capitalism had entered its stage of "decline" and
"decay]{.underline}."13 But **[Marx himself can hardly be said to be an
unambiguous productivist]{.underline}**. Since the publication of
"Theses on Feuerbach," the Grundrisse and the 1844 Economic and
Philosophical Manuscripts, and the unearthing of the Hegelian influence
on Capital, it has been clear that **[Marx's desire to maximize
production is subservient to his goal to establish a world society in
which all people can develop their talents and abilities to their
fullest.]{.underline}** Dreams of transcending scarcity aside, **[it
became obvious that Marx did not see human beings as mere production
machines]{.underline}**. [Baudrillard has nothing to say on this tension
in Marx's work]{.underline}; for him, Marxism invariably "assists the
cunning of capital."14 Baudrillard contends, in the chapter "Historical
Materialism and Primitive Societies," that Marxism is incapable of
understanding primitive societies. It "rewrit\[es\] History through the
mode of production."15 Failing to break from the framework of political
economy, Marxism cannot see primitive societies' irreducibility to
production: "The magical, the religious, and the symbolic are relegated
to the margins of the economy. And even when the symbolic formations
expressly aim, as in primitive exchange, to prevent the emergence with
the rise of economic structures of a transcendent social power . . .
things are arranged nonetheless to as to see a determination by the
economic in the last instance."16 [Baudrillard locates Marxism within
the history of Western notions of science being used to oppress the
primitive]{.underline}: Western culture was the first to critically
reflect upon itself (beginning in the 18th century). [But the effect of
this crisis was that it reflected on itself also as a culture in the
universal, and thus all other cultures were entered in its museum as
vestiges of its own image.]{.underline} It "estheticized" them,
reinterpreted them on its own model, and thus precluded the radical
interrogation of these "different" cultures implied for it. [The limits
of this culture "critique" are clear: its reflection on itself leads
only to the universalization of its own principles]{.underline}. Its own
contradictions lead it, as in the previous case, to the world-wide
economic and political imperialism of all modern capitalist and
socialist Western societies.17 [Marxism is therefore supposedly as
guilty as its bourgeois opponents in miscomprehending societies "without
history," trying to place them within the context of political economy
and therefore just as guilty of racism and ethnocentrism.]{.underline}
But **[Baudrillard draws no distinction between thought and
practice]{.underline}**. [It was not the ideas of the classical
political economists that led to colonialism]{.underline}. Their
theories were generated after colonialism was already a long-established
fact. [Colonialism sprang from capitalism's expansionary dynamic, its
need to force "all nations, on pain of extinction, to adopt the
bourgeois mode of production," and would have done so even if Adam Smith
had never put pen to paper]{.underline}.18 Baudrillard fails to note
that [Marx and Engels both considered the communal forms of organization
of peoples such as the North American Iroquois to be forerunners of
communism]{.underline}, as Marx's Ethnological Notebooks make clear.19
More famously, between 1878 and 1881 [Marx considered that Russia might
be able to "jump over" the capitalist stage of history through its
communes]{.underline} (obshchina) and "pass directly to the higher form
of communist common ownership."20/sup\> The "stage" theory of history of
"official Communism," an easy target for Baudrillard and postmodernists
in general, cannot be reconciled with Marx's hopes for the Russian
communes. Class Reductionism? Michel Foucault's dispute with Marxism
rests less on its supposed productivism and more with what he considers
its inability "to go beyond the mode of production to make intelligible
the forms of domination that emerge at other points in social space and,
in addition, to regard these forms of domination as conceptually
distinct from the relations of production."21 Echoing Nietzsche,
[[Foucault sees the class struggle as only one example of a more
fundamental impulse in humanity, the "will to power]{.underline}." [He
refuses to "take sides" between repression and the "power" wielded by
social movements that resist it]{.underline}]{.mark}[.]{.underline}
Moreover, he refuses to classify those power relationships politically,
socially or morally. [[Foucault specifically rejects the idea of the
human subject]{.underline}:]{.mark} "The individual is not a pre-given
entity which is seized on by the exercise of power. The individual, with
his identity and characteristics, is the product of a relation of power
exercised over bodies, multiplicities, movements, desires, forces."22
The Marxist response to Foucault begins with the question "where does
the will to power originate?" If it is a biologically determined human
trait, and it underpins all social conflict, then humanity is
genetically damned to suffer oppression. Foucault, and
[[postmodernism]{.underline}]{.mark} in general, [offer little more than
a reworked version of the religious theory of original sin]{.underline}.
[But if the will to power has social roots, then it is already called
into question as the essential category]{.underline}. [[What in society
produces and reproduces this will? What exists before it? Where does the
"power struggle" come from?]{.underline}]{.mark} [[Foucault sees the
effects of the rise of capitalism on human
relations]{.mark},]{.underline} not just at the level of class struggle,
but [[in the]{.mark} [sphere of]{.mark}]{.underline}
[p]{.mark}unishment, training, social oppression and sexual repression.
He argues that while feudalism had imposed a political power
relationship from above, rising capitalism imposed "[[self-discipline"
through a variety of new social institutions]{.mark}:]{.underline} This
new mechanism of power is more dependent upon bodies and what they do
than upon the earth and its products. It is a mechanism of power which
permits time and labour, rather than wealth and commodities, to be
extracted from bodies. It is a type of power which is constantly
exercised by means of surveillance rather than in a discontinuous manner
by means of a system of levies or obligations distributed over time. It
presupposes a tightly knit grid of material coercions rather than the
physical existence of a sovereign. It is ultimately dependent on the
principle that one must be able simultaneously both to increase the
subjected forces and to improve the force and efficacy of that which
subjects them.23 [[These observations are raised to the position of a
theory, explicitly opposed to the class struggle as an explanation of
historical change]{.underline}]{.mark}: "One should not assume a massive
and primal condition of domination, a binary structure with 'dominators'
on one side and 'dominated' on the other, but rather a multiform
production of relations of domination."24 But who is the "one" who must
be able to increase the numbers of those dominated while increasing the
force that dominates them? Who are the dominated[? [Foucault's argument
against Marxism rests on the allegation that Marxism reduces history to
just one set of power relationships --- class structure --- whereas
"power" itself is a more elemental category]{.mark}]{.underline}. But
[Marx himself, at least, did not do this]{.underline}. **[[For Marx the
fundamental human category is not class struggle, nor power, but
labor]{.underline}]{.mark}**. [Because people have to labor to
live]{.underline} (regardless of what Baudrillard may write), and
[because their labor is social, they create societies as a means to
implementing labor. Marxism does not have to disregard or reject a
connection between power structures and human biology, as Foucault
does.]{.underline} [Marxism sees human beings as social animals and can
comprehend power relationships in relation to the most fundamental human
activity --- social labor.]{.underline} [Marxism]{.underline} ---
intelligent Marxism, at least --- does not reduce all power struggles to
class. It "[merely" asserts that social struggles can be defined in
relation to class]{.underline}. Carol A. Stabile explains: . . . the
three main charges leveled against \[Marxism\] . . . \[are\] that it is
"reductive," that it is "too universalistic," and that it fails to
consider female labor. On the first point, the general claim is that
historical materialism reduces structures of oppression to class
exploitation, thereby ignoring or minimizing sexism, racism, and
homophobia. While it is certainly true that historical materialism
places relations of production at the foundation of society, there is
nothing simple or reductive about how these relations structure
oppression. Rather, historical materialist analyses, instead of
examining only one form of oppression . . . would explore the way they
all function within the overarching system of class domination in
determining women's and men's life choices. Sweatshop workers in New
York City, for example, experience sexism and racism in quantitatively
and qualitatively different ways than do middle class women. The racism
directed at poor African-American youths occurs in a different context
than that directed at African-American women in the academy . . . by
situating both forms \[of oppression\] within the material context and
historical framework in which they occur, we can highlight the variable
discriminatory mechanisms that are central to capitalism as a system.25
[In [the end, not only is Foucault's critique of Marxism a failure, but
his "reduction" of all inequalities to the concept of power is not a
reduction at all, but a mystification]{.mark}]{.underline}[.]{.mark}
**[It [cannot explain the reasons for power without reference to power.
And unlike Marx, Foucault does not offer an alternative to the
relationship of oppressors and oppressed]{.mark}]{.underline}**.
Conclusion The [[postmodernist attack on Marxism conflates the crudities
of "Marxism]{.mark}-[Leninism" with the thought of Marx
himself]{.mark}.]{.underline} Its critique of Enlightenment rationality
fails on its own terms, but it also fails to discern Marx's break with
his Enlightenment forebearers. [Marx's goal ---]{.underline} the
emancipation of the human individual from need and the flowering of
"rich individuality" --- [is not that of rationalism, Hegelianism or
classical political economy. It is not assured by the rationality and
all-knowing totality of the theoretical system, but can only be
accomplished through struggle. It was chiefly the]{.underline}
(anti-Stalinist) [Marxist Left that actively opposed the truly
reactionary "metanarratives" of the twentieth century:]{.underline}
Social Darwinism, national chauvinism, fascism, Cold War liberalism,
even Stalinism. Marxism provides a more lucid critique of
"metanarratives" where they serve as justification for oppression than
does postmodernism, including where --- as in the case of Stalinism ---
that "metanarrative" is a degeneration originating in the Marxist
movement itself. Whether the world's workers fulfill what Marx had hoped
was their "historic destiny" --- to overthrow capitalism and usher in
communism --- remains to be seen. The teleological aspects of Marxism
are open to critique. But Marx's work still provides, simultaneously,
the only coherent critique of Enlightenment rationality with the notion
that the Enlightenment was, in fact, a good thing.

A method for overcoming melancholia (97), potentiality is a way of
bouncing back from the damage wrought by modern white supremacist
patriarchy. For [[white men]{.mark}, this [damage manifests as]{.mark}
what Robert GoodingWilliams calls "[skeptical melancholy]{.mark}" (54),
or alienation from embodied receptivity; [for women and
nonwhites]{.mark}, it [manifests as melancholic muteness]{.mark},
immanence rather than alienation]{.underline}.8 The women writers Ziarek
studies [rework this damaging immanence into ecstatic incandescence,
effecting "an aesthetic transformation of loss into art's own shining
possibilities" (115). This incandescence is a two-step process: the
artist first performs her damage]{.underline} (sparking a fire) [so that
she can then be seen to overcome it]{.underline} (radiating beyond her
past inertia). [[Neoliberalism co-opts this
incandescence]{.mark}]{.underline} (or at least the most visible,
legible part of its spectrum), [[domesticating]{.mark} its [critical
force into]{.mark} the [means of]{.mark} producing [aesthetic pleasure
and reproducing social normativity]{.mark}.]{.underline} Potentiality
has been "upgraded" into resilience.9 In resilient art, [formal
experimentation cultivates]{.underline}, or incites (to use a more
Foucaultian term), [shocks and feeds the resultant shockwaves back into
the system]{.underline}.10 [This feedback supports rather than
destabilizes hegemonic institutions]{.underline}. The aesthetic damage
through which modernist art established its heteronomous/ autonomous
position of critique---stuttering, fragmented, degraded, aleatory,
dissonant---is now the very medium of normalization.11 [[Neoliberal
resilience]{.underline}]{.mark}, in other words[, [is a method]{.mark}
or process [of recycling modernist damage]{.mark}]{.underline}. For
example, if modernist art invested aesthetic pleasure in the
objectification of women (what Laura Mulvey famously calls scopophilia),
[[neoliberal art invests]{.mark} aesthetic [pleasure in women's
spectacular assumption of subjectivity]{.mark}---what Ziarek calls
[incandescence]{.mark}. If in modernity we liked doing damage to women,
[we now like to see women overcome that damage]{.mark}.]{.underline}12
This means that [we expect women [to]{.mark} [perform]{.mark} their
[damage as a baseline from which "good" women then
progress]{.mark}.]{.underline} That damage is the fuel for incandescent
fires, so it must be constantly incited and invoked so that there's
something for incandescent women to ignite. In this way, [resilience
discourse normalizes traditional patriarchal damage]{.underline} (e.g.,
the damage of exclusion and objectification) [as a systemic or
background condition that individual women are then responsible for
overcoming.]{.underline} "Undoing \[. . .\] feminism while
simultaneously appearing to be engaging in a wellinformed and even
well-intended response to feminism" (McRobbie 1), resilient
incandescence is quintessentially postfeminist. We, the audience, use
our identification with the resilient heroine as a way to disidentify
with and (supposedly) transgress the imperatives of modernist
patriarchy. This is why, as Ziarek explains, audiences have a
"sympathetic identification with subversive femininity, with the mother
avenging the murderous sacrifice of her daughter for political ends,
rather than with the murderous father/king" (104). [We enjoy women's
spectacular subjectivization]{.underline} (i.e., their overcoming of
scopophilic objectification) [because this distances us from
unfashionable patriarchal formations and tastes]{.underline} (i.e., this
latter scopophilia). In postfeminist neoliberalism[, "bearing witness to
both the destruction of women's artistic capacities and women's
revolutionary aspirations" (5) becomes a source of aesthetic pleasure
not because it's revolutionary, but because it's normative.]{.underline}
To use Jack Halberstam's term, we like our women to "go gaga" because
this incandescence, [this "unpredictable feminine" (114) methodology
allows us to eke even more light out of otherwise exhausted
enlightenment modernity. If we've reached]{.underline}, as Ziarek
discusses, [the so-called end of art and the end of history]{.underline}
(and the end of tonality and the end of representation and, well, the
end of modernity), then [[the only way to find more resources
is]{.mark}, like Pixar's wall-e, by [sifting through our vast piles of
waste]{.mark}]{.underline}. And in that waste heap is abject femininity
(what musicologist Susan Cook calls the feminized "abject popular").
[[Femininity is abject because its exclusion from patriarchy is what
constitutes patriarchy as a coherent system]{.underline}]{.mark}. In
both Ziarek's aesthetics of potentiality and in resilience discourse,
women artists do the cultural work of remaking abjection or constitutive
exclusion into ecstatic radiance.13 In the former case, that work is
revolutionary; in the latter case, that work normalizes. Resilience
discourse transposes feminist revolution into a nationalist,
patriarchal, white supremacist practice. [Take, for example, Katy
Perry's "Firework," in which the lyrics trace the affective journey from
dejection to radiant exceptionality.]{.underline} The song begins by
asking listeners to identify with feelings of irrelevance, weakness,
loneliness, and hopelessness; it posits and affirms damage, suffering,
and pain. But then Perry's narrator argues that in spite and perhaps
because of this damage, the listener has precisely the means to connect
to others, to make a difference, to have hope: "\[T\]here's a spark in
you / You just gotta ignite the light and let it shine." She uses the
metaphor of fireworks (and their association with u.s. Independence Day
celebrations) to describe the listener's self-transformation from black
dust to shining light: you may feel like trash, but if you can just
light yourself on fire, that trash will burn with a dazzling radiance
that lights up the sky, just as it lights up audiences' faces. [Here,
Perry transforms abjection---feeling like trash, unmoored, socially
dead---into incandescent triumph. In the song, the addressee's personal
triumph evokes u.s. nationalist narratives of overcoming
colonization]{.underline} (i.e., the Declaration of Independence,
celebrated on the Fourth of July). [[Feminine
incandescence]{.mark}---the transformation of waste and melancholy into
glowing potential---[is no longer revolutionary.]{.mark}]{.underline}
Not only parallel to u.s. nationalism, it is the very means for
reproducing normativity. [In resilience discourse, wild and crazy
femmes]{.underline}---like, say, Ke\$ha--- [reproduce normativity in the
same way that deregulatory economic practices do]{.underline} (see
Cardenas). Unlike Kant's genius, who gives laws and generates order
(i.e., regulation, giving a law) out of unruly materiality[, the
incandescent, "gaga" femme amplifies what feels like disorder by
"resignif\[ying\] damaged bodies and objects previously expelled from
the realm of meaning"]{.underline} (6). And to do this, incandescent
femme geniuses use a specific type of experimentation, what Ziarek calls
"a dynamic model of interrelation between literary form and material
elements of the work of art" (6). [This "dynamic interaction" between
large-scale form and material details produces "effects" that are
"unpredictable and unforeseeable" (]{.underline}Adorno qtd. in Ziarek
114). Experimental methods produce aleatory results.14 [Neoliberalism,
however, has systematized the aleatory; deregulatory practices are
designed to control background conditions so that "dynamic interactions"
between form and material produce a range of superficially random
outcomes.]{.underline}15 Deregulation turns experimentation into the
means of capitalist/hegemonic production. Brilliant gaga ecstasy is what
fuels economic and social reproduction.16 So even though incandescent
potentiality might be "the very opposite of the traffic in women"
(Ziarek 119) figured as the exchange of commodities (e.g., in Irigaray
and Rubin), it is quite consistent with neoliberal political and
aesthetic economies. [Who radiates with potentiality more than the
resilient, entrepreneurial postfeminist woman? In the same way that
feminized, blackened receptivity was the solution to modernist anxieties
about alienation]{.underline} (e.g., the aforementioned
Gooding-Williams[), feminized, racially nonwhite resilience is taken as
a solution to the problem of the "end of art."]{.underline} Having
transgressed all limits and prohibitions---for example, emancipating
dissonance, making music out of noise---modernist art had no means of
establishing its opposition to society/social normativity. [Similarly[,
capitalism had colonized the globe]{.mark}, exhausting its ability to
profit through simple expansion; with no new markets, with nothing else
new to conquer, [it needed a new method for generating surplus
value]{.mark}. As Jeffery Nealon and others argue, capitalism has become
a logic of investment and intensity. Instead of expanding and
assimilating, [it recycles waste and increases
efficiencies]{.mark}.]{.underline} Thus, [traditionally non- or devalued
["women's work" becomes the fastest growing sector]{.mark} of the
service-and-care-work economy. And women's art-making practices become
the hottest new thing in the art world: think of all the "feminist art"
retrospectives and exhibits that have taken place in the past five or so
years.]{.underline} Modernism's constitutive outside becomes
neoliberalism's bread and butter; or, [the [abject]{.mark} is [now
central to the means of capital, political, and aesthetic
production]{.mark}.]{.underline}17 Because it so clearly describes what
gets co-opted and domesticated, [Ziarek's account of [modernist feminist
aesthetics provide]{.mark}s the [foundation for]{.mark} theorizing
[neoliberal postfeminist art and politics]{.mark}. But it [also
provides]{.mark} a possible [avenue for contemporary feminist
aesthetic]{.mark} and political [responses to resilience]{.mark}. It
points us to some of the feminist frequencies that resilience discourse
obscures: the melancholic end of the spectrum, so to speak, rather than
the incandescent]{.underline}. How might we upgrade Ziarek's theory of
melancholic art so that it functions like a queered resilience,
resilience gone wrong, resilience that puts us "out of phase" with
social normativity?18 In Ziarek's text, [[melancholia]{.mark} is a
[symptom of abjection]{.mark}, or constitutive exclusion]{.underline}.19
But what if we rethink melancholy so that it's not pathological or
failed inclusion (i.e., abjection), but pathological or failed
resilience? [[Resilience]{.mark} [incites melancholic damage]{.mark},
feeding it back into the system as the raw material in a tale of
incandescent overcoming.]{.underline} But what if this melancholy isn't
overcome, but intensified? When plugged back into the system, would it
produce antisocial effects? (That is, effects that don't help reproduce
society.) Can melancholy be kindling that won't spark when lit or that
sparks and burns too cool or too hot, too fast or too slow? If classical
melancholy involves "hanging on" to what ought to be excluded (e.g.,
women's art), [[neoliberal melancholy]{.mark} would [manifest as
insufficient resilience]{.mark}, incandescence that radiates at the
wrong frequency, so that, for example, we couldn't hear or see
it.]{.underline} Instead of turning silence into speech and writing,
[melancholic art would queer silences]{.underline}. Jonathan Katz's
essay "John Cage's Queer Silences" begins with the line "John Cage never
quite came out of the closet." [Cage never positively claimed his
identity as a formerly damaged (closeted) but now unrepressed sexual
subject. In other words, he didn't transpose his homosexuality into the
terms that would interpolate him into resilient citizenship. Instead of
openly proclaiming his gay identity, he remained queerly silent. His
silence is "queer" because it doesn't conform to the in/out or
mute/vocal binaries that structure the closet's
epistemology.]{.underline} As Katz explains, "Cage himself, while never
denying his sexuality, preferred instead to duck the question: when
asked to characterize his relationship with Merce, he would say, 'I cook
and Merce does the dishes.'" Cage answers the question, but in terms
that aren't directly and efficiently legible as a response: cooking and
dishwashing seem to have little connection to sexuality. Cage's silences
aren't just a political response to sexual normativity; they're also
musical responses to increasingly deregulatory (read: neoliberal)
compositional methods like "open works" and chance processes. For
example, 4′33″ can be read doubly, as both resilience and queer silence.
Insofar as it recoups extraneous concert-hall noise and places it at the
center of the musical work/performance, 4′33″ is a paradigmatic example
of what Ziarek calls modernist experimentation and what I call
deregulatory resilience. As much as philosophers love to cite this work
as an example of something, however, it's hard to find examples of
people enjoying the work, at least at the level of affect, that is,
rocking out to it while exercising or driving down the highway. The
affective surplus value we expect from resilience (e.g., glowing
radiance) is absent here. The compositional practice of resilience fails
to adequately perform the cultural/affective labor with which it is
usually tasked. Instead of amplifying affective and aesthetic pleasure,
4′33″ completely undercuts them by giving us the wrong kind of excess.
Cage shows us that silence is full of sounds we can't hear because they
radiate at frequencies we can't (or won't) hear, that are queerly out of
phase with our ability to perceive them.20 [[Melancholic
practices]{.mark} don't accomplish the kind of work from which
neoliberal capital and white supremacist patriarchy can extract adequate
surplus value, so [we don't experience them as affectively profitable or
pleasurable]{.mark}. Neoliberal melancholy might feel superficially like
modernist ressentiment---the Nietzschean "bad conscience" that Ziarek
describes as a "reactive rather than creative affect \[. . .\], a
frustrated and powerless will riveted to past injuries rather than
engaged in the creation of new political or artistic forms of life"
(96). But [neoliberal melancholy]{.mark} is something quite different
from modernist ressentiment, and [more like]{.mark} (to use Sara Ahmed's
term) [killjoying]{.mark}---which is another way to think about "bad
vibes."]{.underline} In Nietzsche, ressentiment, or bad conscience, is
quintessentially modern: it is the Enlightenment's will-to-truth, what
Gooding-Williams calls the "skeptical melancholy," that Nietzsche's
perhaps all-too-neoliberal subject must overcome. [Neoliberal melancholy
is [not founded in skepticism,]{.mark} in mind/ body dualisms, or in
other such problematics; it isn't part of the Enlightenment episteme.
[Killjoying is invested in the same affective]{.mark}, aesthetic, and
political [episteme as resilience]{.mark} (e.g., what Ahmed calls "the
promise of happiness"), but it queers these investments.]{.underline}
"Riveted to past injury," modernist melancholics can't perform
resilience; in Nietzsche's terms, they say "no" instead of "yes."
[[Neoliberal melancholics perform resilience]{.mark}, but in a way [that
intensifies damage rather than overcomes it]{.mark}. They say "yes,"
they affirm, but this amplifies rather than overcomes
damage]{.underline}.21 For example, melancholy could be the affirmation
of the wrong frequencies, the frequencies resilience discourse tunes
out. In this way, [[melancholy isn't]{.mark} the [absence of
resilience]{.mark}, or the opposite of resilience, [but misfired
resilience]{.mark}; "transformation" is not "blocked" (Ziarek 96), but
unsuccessful. Neoliberal melancholy goes through the motions but doesn't
"glow" with joy]{.underline}.22 Instead of either accelerating or
decelerating, [[melancholy is the experience of being]{.mark}, as an
acoustician might put it, "out of phase" or "phased out" of social
normativity. In sum, feminist responses to resilience, or neoliberalism,
shouldn't try to seek an "outside" or a "new beginning"; modernist
critical strategies generally support neoliberalism. Instead, [they need
to figure out how to work within resilience discourse]{.mark}.
Melancholy might be one such way. I have tried to show how Ziarek's
book, because of its narrow focus on modernist feminist aesthetics,
provides a productive foundation for theorizing neoliberal feminist
aesthetics, the feminist aesthetics that respond to "capitalist
realism." The [central terms of her analysis]{.mark}---damage,
incandescence, melancholy---[are key factors in neoliberal politics and
aesthetics]{.mark}. What Ziarek's book shows us is [the gendered
dimension of these politics and aesthetics and]{.mark} how
[neoliberalism co-opts women's resistance strategies]{.mark}, plugging
them back into racist, patriarchal projects.]{.underline}

### Monolithic State 

**Writing off all institutional reform as the recapitulation of the
liberalist tropes of antiblackness forwards an ahistorical and deflating
understanding of the state- it is not a monolith but an unstable and
constantly shifting site of political struggle that is heavily reliant
on alliances that can be used against itself**

The Problem With the "Deep State" [The deep state concept is
harmful]{.underline} in two key ways. First, **[invoking [the deep state
implies a misleading view of the state as a monolithic, unitary
actor]{.mark}.]{.underline}** While the deep state is usually said to be
a network of individuals and agencies, [[it is assumed that
these]{.mark} component [parts are held together by a common
will]{.mark} or mission]{.underline} (in this case, something like
defending the "national interest" against Trumpism). [[This leads to a
reification of the state as]{.mark} an autonomous and [internally
coherent force]{.mark}]{.underline}[. **[Yet modern capitalist states
are more fragmented than they appear]{.underline}**]{.mark}. First,
[[they are composed of class fractions and coalitions that have
frequently clashing interests and are motivated by short-term
considerations]{.underline}]{.mark}. Often, [[these internal differences
arise from the pressure exerted by various economic
interests]{.underline}]{.mark} (such as the competition between the
financial, manufacturing, and small business sectors). In addition,
[[these]{.mark} class forces [are intersected by other factors,
including the different social bases of support behind the major
political parties]{.mark}]{.underline} (including voter cleavages based
on urban versus rural interests, racial and gender attitudes, and
"populist" appeal), [[the mass media's role in shaping certain
ideological narratives, and competing visions of foreign policy and
geopolitical strategy]{.underline}.]{.mark} As the Greek sociologist
Nicos Poulantzas wrote in State, Power, Socialism, we need to "discard
once and for all the view of the State as a completely united mechanism,
founded on a homogeneous and hierarchical distribution of the centers of
power moving from top to bottom of a uniform ladder or pyramid." [[**The
state is better understood as a temporary and historically contingent
crystallization of social forces**,]{.mark} a formation whose
institutions are as liable to come into conflict with each other in
times of political duress as they are to align seamlessly in times of
stability.]{.underline} It is not at all clear, then, that the leaks are
a power play by a unified deep state. The rivalry within the White House
between the Bannon and Priebus camps, and Trump's intent to govern by
executive order (with little consultation from Congress, the Justice
Department, or the federal agencies responsible for implementing these
orders) have disturbed the normal functioning of the bureaucracy. As
state personnel develop ways of coping with the unpredictable and ad hoc
nature of this administration, [the dissent within their ranks is a sign
of the uncertainty that they have been thrown into since the election,
rather than a well-coordinated, conspiratorial effort]{.underline}.
Second, [[**to talk of the deep state is to suggest that political power
is sealed off from broader social struggles**. The state--civil society
binary is one of the fundamental bases of liberal political
theory]{.underline}]{.mark}. But [[this]{.mark} distinction [is]{.mark}
largely [a byproduct of the way that political power has represented
itself, rather than a social fact.]{.mark}]{.underline} []{.mark}[Where
the state ends and civil society begins has always been permeable and
contested]{.underline} --- in other words, [subject to politics and
political struggle]{.underline}. **[[The state is not an entity standing
over and above society, but instead one premised upon the social forces
that bring it into being]{.underline}]{.mark}**. [Loose talk of the
"deep state" misses this]{.underline} crucial point, [advancing instead
a [facile vision of institutionalized power that constitutes its own
foundation, and is]{.mark}]{.underline} therefore [[opaque, mysterious,
and beyond the reach of citizens]{.mark}.]{.underline} The State and the
Struggle Rejecting the deep state framework is not an academic exercise.
**[[The way we think about the state shapes how we, as democratic
agents, conceive of and relate to organized political
power]{.underline}]{.mark}**. [[It affects how we organize and
participate in the growing movement against the Trump administration and
the GOP's agenda]{.underline}]{.mark}. [[Treating the state as a
nebulous substratum of bureaucratic networks and
institution]{.underline}s]{.mark} --- ones that really call the shots
behind visible electoral politics --- [[overlooks its potential as a
terrain for political struggle]{.underline}]{.mark}. To again quote
Poulantzas, "[[the State is]{.underline}]{.mark} not a monolithic bloc
but [[a strategic field.]{.mark}"]{.underline} [Through concerted
struggles inside and outside of political institutions, the opposition
can displace and alter the state's internal dynamics. [They can attack
the hegemonic coalition (currently headed by Trump) at the
core]{.mark}]{.underline}. What would this look in practice? What would
it entail for the movement against Trumpism to analyze, leverage, and
exploit for its own ends the various coalitions, fractions, and
hegemonic blocs within the state that are now publicly clashing? First[,
[it would mean embracing the plurality of political resistance, from
legislative pressure to marches and public demonstrations, economic
boycotts, and civil disobedience]{.mark}]{.underline}. Since the
election we have seen a new politicization of civil society, and the
proliferation of local initiatives seeking to stem the new
administration's onslaught. [Among these are the rapid growth of the
Democratic Socialists of America, and the movements for sanctuary cities
and campuses.]{.underline} These struggles in civil society always
reverberate within the state, turning the latter into a contested ground
where these new movements can push back, both directly within and
outside of state institutions, against the Trump agenda. Second, [it
would mean deepening the existing ties between the various popular
struggles fighting Trump and the GOP, including the movements for
women's and reproductive rights, immigrant rights, workers' rights, and
environmental justice.]{.underline} In the short term, [cultivating a
broad coalition around overlapping interests]{.underline} (and seeking
to fragment the support behind the Trump coalition, where possible)
[could encourage a further de-legitimization of the Trump
administration's far-right agenda, and thereby spur more refusals and
defections from within the ranks of the civil service]{.underline}.
Eventually, this movement building would go a long way in creating a
positive common agenda for an already-revitalizing ;eft. In sum, it
would mean challenging the state's ability to establish the new normal
envisioned in Trump's campaign agenda, and to inject popular struggles
into the heart of the ruling coalition, which cannot act without the
ongoing support of both major parties and the bureaucracy. But for any
of this to happen, [[we first have to abandon the idea of a coherent,
unitary deep state that is dictating politics behind the
scenes]{.underline}]{.mark}. Relying on an illusory deep state to save

### Movements 

#### only structural analysis solves -- movements are like theme parks that allow people to perform radicalism but ultimately fuel the same structures they critique

**Blühdorn 6** (Ingolfur, university of bath, uk, "Self-Experience in
the Theme Park of Radical Action? Social Movements and Political
Articulation in the Late-Modern Condition," European Journal of Social
Theory, 02/2006)

Thus, the analysis of contemporary social movements and new forms of
politi- cal articulation provides the incentive at least to outline a
theory of contempor- ary society, which can provide a framework of
reference within which contemporary social movements can then be
interpreted. Such a theory will endeavour to highlight the distinctive
problems and pathologies (structural strains) to which social movements
arguably respond -- without necessarily intending or being aware of
this. Of course, structural strains models are not new: for Marxists,
the all-important structural fault line that triggers social movements
runs between the classes of labour and capital. The post-Marxist
tradition of new social movement theory since Melucci (1980, 1989) and
Touraine (1981) locates the fault line between the primarily
identity-oriented post-materialist new politics and the more traditional
state-centred politics of material production and distri- bution. For
Habermas (1981), the structural strain originates from the conflict
between the rationality of the individual-centred lifeworld and the
function- centred logic of the political, administrative and economic
systems. And reflex- ive modernization theorists (Beck, 1992, 1997;
Giddens, 1991, 1994) believe it runs between the as yet insufficiently
modern and integrated institutions of contemporary society which
constantly produce unforeseen and undesirable sideeffects. So structural
strain approaches have always been around, but in each of these models,
the centre piece is ultimately the grievances of human individuals.
[Because these models are based on a social theory that centres on the
individual, they are,]{.underline} despite their focus on structures,
[always constructed from the perspective of actors]{.underline}. **[A
social movement theory that wants to reach beyond the limitations of
modernist-progressivist narratives about contemporary society, needs to
be based on a systems-centred rather than an individual-centred social
theory]{.underline}**. The structural strains it will highlight will,
first and foremost, be systemic problems and strains rather than
grievances perceived and articulated by human individuals.

[From a systems perspective, it will be possible to offer a
reconceptualization and reassessment of the role of social movements
that transcend the social movements' self-descriptions]{.underline} and
the modernist narratives which have been dominant so far. What is
envisaged is not so much conceptualizing social movements them- selves
as organizational or communicative systems (e.g. Luhmann, 1989, 1996;
Blühdorn, 2005, 2006) and investigating the ways in which these systems
estab- lish, stabilize and reproduce themselves. Instead, **[the
objective is to explore what contribution social movements make to the
overall system of advanced modern society; what societal function they
may fulfil rather than what self-declared goals they
pursue]{.underline}**. This function is not fixed. Historically, it has
changed more than once. More accurately: social theorists have
reconceptualized it more than once. At the transition from industrial to
post-industrial society, social movements changed from being the motor
of the anti-capitalist revolution to being the agent of post-material
identity politics (Inglehart, 1977). With the emergence of the risk
society (Beck, 1992) in the 1980s their function shifted -- or was
reconceptualized -- once again: from the agent of new politics to the
repository of societal capacities of reflexivity helping to manage new
risks emerging from technological progress and societal complexity. In
this same sense, the function of social movements may continue to
change, in particular when the ongoing process of modernization brings
about societal conditions which are in significant respects
categorically new.

In the next section I will argue that [the late-modern condition, or
denucleated modernity, represents such a new type of society which has
to cope with a very specific set of structural strains]{.underline}. On
this basis, the remainder of this article will then develop the
hypothesis that in this society **[post-conventional forms of political
articulation and participation fulfil a new function: they represent an
intra- societal physical and discursive space -- the theme park -- in
which individuals, social groups and society at large can perform and
experience key features of the traditional-modern condition which remain
indispensable even though late- modern society has clearly moved beyond
the traditional-modern phase.]{.underline}** It will be suggested that
in denucleated modernity **[this inner-societal performance of
traditional-modern features helps to stabilize the political and
economic systems which have become highly fragile because they are
functioning in an entirely self- referential manner and as purposes in
themselves]{.underline}**. Of course, this interpretation of social
movements as theme parks of traditional modernity is not supposed to
invalidate or replace existing analyses but merely to supplement them.

### Politics Good 

#### Speaking truth to power cannot create a new political organization that becomes powerful. Empirics prove radical black political organizing is effective when it targets governments strategically and pragmatically.

Politics, pp. 140-147)

All [four examples have a few things in common]{.underline}. First [[all
occurred at a moment where **all seemed lost.**]{.underline}]{.mark}
While I wouldn't go as far as to suggest that these events suggest that
neoliberalism is "naturally" contested---just as there is no "good
teaching gene" there is no "contest neoliberalism gene"---I would say
that [[while the neoliberal turn has]{.mark} signifcantly [altered our
ability to argue for public goods, it hasn't killed that
ability]{.mark}]{.underline}[. [It still exists]{.underline}]{.mark}. It
exists **[[in institutions]{.underline}]{.mark}** [we have written of
thinking they are **no longer relevant**]{.underline}---like teachers
unions. [It [exists in populations we've written of because we believe
they are incapable of **radical political
action**]{.mark}]{.underline}[--- **[black
youth]{.underline}**]{.mark}**[.]{.underline}** [[It exists in]{.mark}
cities that we don't think of as having a long history of radical
political struggle]{.underline} ---**[like [Jackson,
Mississippi]{.mark}]{.underline}**. Second all three recognized the
fundamental role politics played in their struggles. The [[black youth
organizers recognized that they had to **pressure Maryland state
legislators** to kill the prison]{.underline}]{.mark}. [The black
[radicals in the Malcolm X Grassroots Movement made
electing]{.mark}]{.underline} Chokwe [[Lumumba a component of their
organizing]{.mark}.]{.underline} [[The CTU chose to take the city head
on and to hold a series of town hall meetings **designed to inform
people** of the ways **political officials**,]{.underline}
**[philanthropists]{.underline}**, [and **corporations**]{.underline}
[are working together to neoliberalize and kill public
education]{.underline}]{.mark}. [The \#[blacklivesmatter]{.mark}
movement [recognized]{.mark} that [politics was at **the center** of
their struggle in **Ferguson**]{.mark}]{.underline}, Baltimore, and
elsewhere. [[All]{.mark} campaigns [used moral
language]{.mark}]{.underline} in making their arguments. In Jackson they
argued that the current way power was allocated in Jackson was immoral
because it largely concentrated all of the benefits into a few
(predominantly white) hands. In Baltimore they argued that putting \$104
million to the goal of incarcerating youth was immoral given the lack of
money being spent on youth in other areas, and later that Freddie Gray's
(and before him Tyrone West's) murder was immoral. In Chicago they
argued that closing 50 schools was immoral because it severely impacted
the ability of poor black parents and black students to get the same
degree of learning their white counterparts had.
[**[However]{.underline}**, [they didn't **rely** on those
arguments]{.underline}]{.mark}. [[They understood]{.mark} that
**[seizing power]{.mark}**]{.underline} ([[rather than **speaking truth
to it**]{.underline}), [that proposing **new
alternatives**]{.underline}, [would]{.underline}]{.mark} [at some level
have to **[involve political struggle]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Morality
wasn't enough. Even if we had a common defnition of morality, a
Christian-infuenced morality for example, that sense of morality could
still be interpreted in diferent ways based on material interest.
[Relying on [morality can make it hard to move against]{.mark} the
wealthy [charter school proponent who **sincerely
believes**]{.mark}]{.underline} that [[privatizing]{.mark} public
[schools]{.mark} [represent **the best hope**]{.mark}]{.underline} for
increasing positive outcomes among black children. Relying on morality
can make it very difficult to argue against the political bureaucrat who
says --- as they did in the case of Baltimore ---that the conditions of
youth currently held in adult prisons is so bad that the moral choice
would be to give them their own facility where they won't have to face
the risks associated with being housed with adults. [In deciding how we
go about making our arguments and how we go about choosing our
strategies and tactics we should **act morally**]{.underline}---I do
believe our politics have to be rooted in a certain sense of ethics.
[[We should **never**]{.underline}]{.mark}, **[however]{.underline}**,
[[ignore the **fundamental role politics plays**]{.underline} [and
**should play**]{.underline} i]{.mark}n our struggle. Not only did they
focus on politics, [[they all relied on **political
organizing**]{.underline}]{.mark}. Organizing [[that included long
discussions about political issues that mattered]{.underline}]{.mark},
[but also parties and other events designed to get people working with
each other and trusting one another]{.underline}. In general, [[people
do not come to a **common understanding** of the **structural
dynamics**]{.underline} [of the problem they face, and to a common
understanding of what the solution should be,]{.underline} [through
being exposed to]{.underline} ]{.mark}[a]{.underline} charismatic
speaker, or through "[[loving]{.underline}]{.mark} black people",
[[without having the space to talk about the issues **in depth** over a
**long period of time**]{.underline}]{.mark}. The CTU organized for
several years to be able to get a 90% vote. The infrastructure black
youth in Baltimore relied upon was by definition designed to inculcate
critical thinking skills as well as a sense of the way racism worked at
structuring black life chances. The Malcolm X Grassroots Movement worked
for years to build the critical capacity required to elect Chokwe, first
to the City Council, then Mayor, and to put the political platform into
action. There is no way to get around the fact that the type of work we
have to do to rebuild a sense of the public interest is going to take a
long time and has to start by building connections between people who
may not think of themselves as political, who may not think of the
various issues they struggle with as being the product of the neoliberal
turn, who may not know what neoliberalism is. What I am referring to
here is not the same as getting people to attend a rally or a march.
[[I'm referring to]{.mark}]{.underline} political organizing---
[[building the capacity of people to govern and make]{.mark} [important
**political decisions**]{.mark}]{.underline} for themselves ---**[[not
political "mobilizing".]{.underline}]{.mark}** [[Mobilizing]{.mark}
people for a protest act of one kind or another [may get people out to
engage]{.mark} [in a **specific act**]{.mark}]{.underline}[,
**[but]{.underline}** [unless combined with **organizing
work**,]{.underline} [will not cause those people to organize for
themselves]{.underline}]{.mark}. Tird in each case they were not only
reactive, they were not only being critical of the turn and its efects,
they proposed a positive alternative. **[[Protest is not
enough]{.underline}]{.mark}**. [Just as the neoliberal turn did not
simply occur when the welfare state was removed]{.underline}, [rather it
occurred when the welfare state was removed and then replaced **with a
new program**]{.underline}, [[we will not be able to build a sustainable
constituency for a new world]{.mark} **[without
articulating]{.mark}**]{.underline} as clearly as possible [**[what that
new world will look like,]{.underline}** [**what type of policies would
result**, **what the benefits of those policies would
b**]{.underline}]{.mark}**[e]{.underline}**. Fourth while each of these
instances represent responses against the neoliberal turn broadly
considered, they each began locally. Te Malcolm X Grassroots Movement
has several chapters throughout the country and has already held one
conference (planned before Lumumba's untimely passing) about the Jackson
model (which itself is partially based on ideas developed in Spain) and
how to export it to other cities. Te movement against the proposed youth
jail in Baltimore relied in part on data accumulated by the ACLU on the
schoolto-prison pipeline. And as I noted above the Chicago Teachers
Union have begun organizing events all across the country to get people
to understand how the privatization movement in education afects them.
And each of the #blacklivesmatter campaigns began with a specifc local
act of police brutality and used that act to organize locally. With this
said though each case represents a local struggle people could
experience directly. Mark Purcell (2006) argues that academics and
activists alike run the risk of falling into the "local trap" by arguing
that there is something inherently better and anti-neoliberal about
organizing locally. I agree with him a little. Te Civil Rights Movement
represented in large part a fght against white supremacy as embedded in
local and state politics ---the local was not the site of empowerment
but rather the site of profound disempowerment for black people
throughout the North and the South. However at the same time I argue
that sustainable organizing is more likely to occur in response to a
local issue (a local school closing, a rise in foreclosures in a local
neighborhood, a jail built up the road, a local referendum) that can
then be connected to other local issues and made national rather than
the other way around. And again the Civil Rights Movement represents the
best example of this ---people weren't interested in ending Jim Crow as
much as they were interested in desegregating the buses they took to
work everyday, desegregating the restaurants they passed on the way to
school, desegregating the schools themselves. Fifth they used a variety
of black institutions in their struggles. Te Baltimore youth all
attended black public schools in Baltimore. Tey used the public schools
to garner support for their work and to build relationships with black
adults and black children. While a number of Baltimore area churches do
promote the prosperity gospel, not all do. A few black churches in
Baltimore became critical spaces for organizing against the jail---in
fact I ended up fnding out about the movement against the jail in the
frst place through hearing a young progressive black nationalist
Baltimore pastor speak about the movement. And they used popular
culture. Tey used poetry, they used rap and hip-hop, they used parties,
understanding that while again the national terrain for hip-hop may move
with rather than against the neoliberal turn, they themselves could use
it to speak to their local condition. And later they used these same
institutions and spaces for their fght against police brutality.
Similarly in Jackson the Malcolm X Grassroots Movement did not operate
from a clean slate. Tey relied on professors from nearby Jackson State
University, they used connections with local churches to gain support
for their activities. And the CTU was itself located in one of the most
important institutions in black communities, schools. Lastly, they all
relied on the fundamental premise that black people had the capacity to
be the change they wanted to see in the world. Tey neither believed that
black people's fundamental condition was bruised and broken, nor did
they believe that black people because of the contemporary condition
didn't love each other. At the same time though they understood
explicitly and implicitly that love was not enough. And while each
organization does have a number of leaders they have largely (though not
fully) stayed away from the type of prophetic politics that have often
created problematic internal hierarchies. Again there are signifcant
diferences between these instances. And even though each of these
instances were victorious ones that helped to change the terrain of
political struggle, there is still much more to be done. In the case of
Baltimore they stopped the youth jail but were not able to stop the
privatization of Baltimore youth recreation centers, nor have they been
able to (as of yet) redirect the \$104 million to more progressive ends.
Jackson elected Lumumba mayor but after his untimely passing his son
ended up coming in second. Chicago teachers made substantial gains as a
result of the strike but they were not able to prevent the 50 schools
from being closed. Te #blacklivesmatter movement as it stands has not
gone without critique. Te most notable one is that even though the
project has increased the range of black lives that people are willing
to fght for, it still hasn't gone far enough. Although it's reasonable
to assume, based on the limited data we have, that black boys and young
men are victimized by police more than other populations (and to the
extent the zero-tolerance technology itself generates broader forms of
policing in places like schools), black boys and young men are not the
sole target. Black women have been victimized both directly and
indirectly by police, as have black transgender populations. These acts
have in many instances been as violent as those perpetrated against
their male counterparts, and they have been videotaped as well. But they
haven't garnered the same degree of support and/or outrage. Extending
the #blacklivesmatter movement to include the lives of black women and
transgender populations that are also the victims of police violence
would be more than simply a good thing. However there's a more systemic
problem at work. Te idea behind "black lives matters" represents an
opportunity to organize around and against a certain type of sufering, a
uniquely black sufering, made possible by the neoliberal turn. (It bears
repeating, this is not simply the "new Jim Crow" at work. Te odds that
someone like me would sufer the type of horrifc death someone like
Freddie Gray did is very slim.) However the politics of the
#blacklivesmatter movement do not quite match the phrase. Every single
time the #blacklivesmatters movement appears it does so in the presence
of either a horrifc instance of black death or a startling instance of
police brutality. One could argue given this that the real politics of
the movement refect the concept that (graphic) black death matters
rather than black life. Tis move makes a great deal of sense --- one way
to think about this move is to think about the way civil rights movement
activists used non-violence. Particularly when news cameras were
present, non-violent tactics of protest tended to really highlight how
violent and terroristic white supremacy in the South and other places
was. However, by privileging the graphic black death, the victim shot in
his back while running away, the victim who had his back violently
broken by police, it ends up ignoring the many forms of non-graphic
black death that occurs not because of police violence per se, but
because of economic violence. If Freddie Gray weren't murdered by the
police but rather experienced a slow death due to lead poisoning it's
unlikely we'd be talking about him right now. It'd be unlikely that
Baltimore would've had anything like an uprising. Following up, by
privileging black death, graphic black death, we privilege certain types
of tactics, strategies, and institutions. We counter the spectacle of
the murder with the spectacle of the mass assembly, in the form of the
protest march, or the spectacle of the mass disruption, in the form of
the highway stoppage, or even in the form of the type of violent actvity
the uprising hinted at. Actions in other words that are not only
designed to transform the event into a black-and-white catalytic moment
where people and the institutions around them feel forced to make a
choice for the status quo or against it. And the organizations and
institutions we call into being end up being those designed to generate
these types of activities and to generate support for these activities
(in order to grow the organizations and institutions themselves). As far
as solutions go, we also privilege anti-police legislation, and perhaps
more broadly, legislation designed to counter the school to prison
pipeline. Te political solution for black life matters is to reduce the
likelihood of a graphic singular black death--- a kid shot on the way to
the corner store, a young man shot while holding a BB gun he may have
planned on purchasing, a black couple driving a car with a tendency to
backfre. Te types of politics that generate change when the deaths come
slow, painfully, and in aggregates, or when the issue is an entire legal
framework (like the Maryland Law Enforcement Ofcers Bill of Rights) is a
diferent politics. It is not solely or primarily a politics of the
spectacle. Spectacle can work here in instances. It can be used to
mobilize support. It can be used to increase awareness and general
participation. And sometimes in combination with other tactics it can be
used to disrupt. To generate and prolong crises. Te types of crises that
engendered the same type of problems that caused the neoliberal turn.
Certainly in the case of Baltimore a range of institutions and elites
had no ready-to-roll-out solutions to the issues that the uprising
called up. But these aren't enough. It requires a politics attuned to
the type of long term institution building that builds the capacity of
individuals to govern and devise alternatives themselves. It also
requires a solution set that is more about combating the type of long
term institutional violence that doesn't necessarily have a Trayvon
Martin or a Freddie Gray at the center. Te types of violence that,
instead might have Freddie Gray at the center, but not at the moment of
his murder but at the moment he was found to have lead poisoning. I use
these examples in order to argue that we aren't starting from scratch
necessarily--- some of the work is already being done on the ground. [I
use these examples in order to show that [we already have the seeds for
a **new institutional framework** that **re-roots the economy** in
**politics** and in **the public interest**]{.mark}. To show that we
aren't alone, and that a number of people recognize another way of life
is possible.]{.underline} [[There aren't as many of us as we'd
like,]{.underline} **[but there are far more of us than we
think.]{.underline}**]{.mark}

#### Hollowed out institutions serve the interests of corporate power by removing checks on unfettered corporate capitalism. We need institutional starting points to reclaim the social and affirm a project of inclusivity and egalitarian redistrubtion

[[Any attempt to address]{.mark} the politics of the new [racism]{.mark}
in the United States [must begin by **reclaiming**]{.mark} the language
of [**the social**]{.mark} and affirming the project of an **inclusive**
and just **democracy**]{.underline}. This suggests [addressing how the
politics of the new racism are made invisible under the mantle of
neoliberal ideology]{.underline}, that is, [raising questions about how
neoliberalism works to hide the effects of power, politics, and racial
injustice]{.underline}. What is troubling and must increasingly be made
problematic is that [neoliberalism wraps itself in what appears to be an
unassailable appeal to common sense]{.underline}. As Jean and John
Comaroff (2000) observe: [there is a strong argument to be made that
[neoliberal capitalism]{.mark} in its millennial moment
[portends]{.mark} the [**death of politics** by]{.mark} hiding its own
ideological underpinnings in the dictates of economic
efficiency]{.underline}: in [the fetishism of the free
market]{.underline}, in the inexorable, expanding needs of business, in
the imperatives of science and technology. Or, if it does not conduce to
the death of politics, it tends to reduce them to the pursuit of pure
interest, individual or collective. (p. 322) Defined as [the paragon of
all social relations, neoliberalism attempts to eliminate an engaged
critique about its most basic principles and social consequences by
**embracing the market as the arbiter of social destiny**]{.underline}
(Rule, 1998, p. 31). More is lost here than neoliberalism's willingness
to make its own assumptions problematic. Also lost is the very viability
of politics itself. Not only does [neoliberalism]{.underline} in this
instance empty the public treasury, hollow out public services, and
limit the vocabulary and imagery available to recognize antidemocratic
forms of power and narrow models of individual agency, but it also
[undermines the socially discursive translating functions of any viable
democracy by undercutting the ability of individuals to engage in the
continuous translation between public considerations and the private
interests **[by collapsing]{.mark} the [public into]{.mark} the realm of
the [private]{.mark}**]{.underline} (Bauman, 2001). Divested of its
political possibilities and social underpinnings, freedom finds few
opportunities for rearticulating private worries into public concerns or
individual discontent into collective struggle (Bauman, 2001). Hence,
[the "first task in engaging neoliberalism is revealing its claim to a
bogus universalism and making clear how it functions as a historical and
social construction. Neoliberalism hides the traces of its own ideology,
politics, and history either by rhetorically asserting its triumphalism
as part of the end of history or by proclaiming that capitalism and
democracy are synonymous]{.underline}. What must be challenged is
neoliberalism's future tense narrative of inevitability, demonstrating
that the drama of world history remains wide open (Medovoi, 2002, p.
66). But the history of the changing economic and ideological conditions
that gave rise to neoliberalism must be understood in relation to the
corresponding history of race relations in the United States and abroad.
Most importantly, as the history of race is either left out or
misrepresented by the official channels of power in the United States,
it is crucial that the history of slavery, civil rights, racial
politics, and ongoing modes of struggle at the level of everyday life be
remembered and used pedagogically to challenge the historical amnesia
that feeds neoliberalism's ahistorical claim to power and the continuity
of its claims to common sense. [The struggle against racial injustice
cannot be separated from larger questions about what kind of culture and
society are emerging under the imperatives of neoliberalism, what kind
of history it ignores, and what alternatives might point to a
substantive democratic future]{.underline}. Second, [under neoliberalism
all levels of [**government have been hollowed out** and]{.mark} largely
[reduced]{.mark} either to their policing functions or [to
maintaining]{.mark} the privileges of the rich and the [interests of
corporate power,]{.mark} both of **[which are]{.mark} largely
[White]{.mark}**]{.underline}. In this discourse, [[not only is]{.mark}
**the [state absolved of]{.mark}** its traditional social contract **of
[upholding]{.mark} the [public good and providing]{.mark} crucial
[social provisions]{.mark}** and minimal guarantees for those who are in
need of such services, [but it also **embraces**]{.mark} a notion of
color-blind **[racelessness]{.mark}**]{.underline}. State racelessness
is built on the right-wing logic of rational racists such as Dinesh
DSouza (1995), who argue that What we need is a separation of race and
state (p. 545). As David Theo Goldberg (2002) points out, this means
that the state is now held to a standard of justice protective of
individual rights and not group results from. [This in turn makes
possible the devaluation of any individuals considered not white, or
white-like, the trashing or trampling of their rights and possibilities,
for the sake of preserving the right to private rational discrimination
of whites. \[Thus\] racist discrimination becomes
privatized]{.underline}, and in terms of liberal legality state
protected in its privacy. (p. 229) Defined through the ideology of
racelessness, [the [state removes itself]{.mark} from either addressing
or correcting the effects of racial discrimination, [reducing]{.mark}
matters of [racism to individual concerns to be]{.mark} largely [solved
through **private negotiations between individuals**]{.mark}, and
adopting an entirely uncritical role in the way in which the racial
state shapes racial policies and their effects throughout the economic,
social, and cultural landscape]{.underline}. [[Lost here is]{.mark} any
[**critical engagement with state power** and how it]{.mark} imposes
immigration policies, [decides who gets resources]{.mark} and access to
a quality education, defines what constitutes a crime, how people are
punished, how and whether social problems are criminalized, who is
worthy of citizenship, and who is responsible for addressing racial
injustices]{.underline}. As the late Pierre Bourdieu (Bourdieu & Grass,
2002) argues, **[[there is a political]{.mark} and pedagogical
[need]{.mark} not only to protect the social gains, embodied in state
policies, that have been the outcome of important collective struggles,
but also [to invent another kind of state]{.mark}]{.underline}** (p.
71). This means **[[challenging]{.mark} the [political
irresponsibility]{.mark} and moral indifference]{.underline}** which are
the organizing principles **[[at the heart of the neoliberal
vision]{.underline}]{.mark}**. As Bourdieu suggests, this points to the
need to restore a sense of utopian possibility rooted in a struggle for
a democratic state. [The racial state and its neoliberal ideology need
to be challenged as part of any viable antiracist pedagogy and politics.
[Antiracist pedagogy]{.mark} also [needs to]{.mark} move beyond the
conundrums of a limited identity politics and begin to include in its
analysis what it would mean to [imagine the state as a vehicle
for]{.mark} democratic values and a strong proponent for social and
[racial justice]{.mark}]{.underline}. In part, reclaiming the democratic
and public responsibility of the state would mean: arguing for a state
in which tax cuts for the rich, rather than social spending, are seen as
the problem; using the state to protect the public good rather than
waging a war on all things public; engaging and resisting the use of
state power to both protect and define the public sphere as utterly
White; redefining the power and role of the state so as to minimize its
policing functions and strengthen its accountability to the public
interests of all citizens, rather than to the wealthy and corporations.
[Removing the state from its subordination to market values means
reclaiming the importance of social needs over commercial interests,
democratic politics over corporate power, and addressing a host of
urgent social problems]{.underline} that include but are not limited to:
the escalating costs of health care, housing, the schooling crisis, the
growing gap between the rich and poor, the environmental crisis, the
rebuilding of the nation's cities and impoverished rural areas, the
economic crisis facing most of the states, and the increasing assault on
people of color. [The struggle over the state must be linked to a
struggle for a racially just, inclusive democracy.]{.underline}
**[Crucial to any viable politics of antiracism is the role the state
will play as a guardian of the public interest and as a force in
creating a multiracial democracy]{.underline}**. Third, it is crucial
for any antiracist pedagogy and politics to recognize that power does
not just inhabit the realm of economics or state power, but is also
intellectual, residing in the educational force of the culture and its
enormous powers of persuasion. This means that [any viable antiracist
pedagogy must make the political more pedagogical by recognizing how
public pedagogy works to determine and secure how racial identity,
issues, and relations are produced in a wide variety of sites including
schools]{.underline}, cable and television networks, newspapers and
magazines, the Internet, advertising, churches, trade unions, and a host
of other public spheres in which ideas are produced and distributed[.
This means becoming mindful of how racial meanings and practices are
created, mediated, reproduced, and challenged through a wide variety of
discourses, institutions]{.underline}, audiences, markets, and
constituencies [which help determine the forms and meaning of publicness
in American society]{.underline} (Brenkman, 1995, p. 8). [The crucial
role that pedagogy plays in shaping racial issues reaffirms]{.underline}
the centrality of a cultural politics that recognizes the relationship
between issues of representation and the operations of power, [the
important role that intellectuals might play as engaged, public
intellectuals, and the importance of critical knowledge in challenging
neoliberalism's illusion of unanimity]{.underline}. But an antiracist
cultural pedagogy also suggests the need to develop a language of
critique and possibility, and to wage individual and collective
struggles in a wide variety of dominant public spheres and alternative
counterpublics. Public pedagogy as a tool of antiracist struggles
understands racial politics not only as a signifying activity through
which subject positions are produced, identities inhabited, and desires
mobilized but also as the mobilization of material relations of power as
a way of securing, enforcing, and challenging racial injustices. [While
cultural politics offers an opportunity to understand how race matters
and racist practices take hold in everyday life, such a **pedagogical**
and cultural **politics must avoid collapsing into a romanticization of
the** symbolic, popular, or **discursive**]{.underline}. Culture matters
as a rhetorical tool and mode of persuasion, especially in the realm of
visual culture, which has to be taken seriously as a pedagogical force,
but [**[changing consciousness]{.mark}** is only a precondition to
changing society and **[should not be confused with what it means to
actually transform institutional relations of
power]{.mark}**]{.underline}. In part, this means contesting the control
of the media by a handful of transnational corporations (on this
subject, see McChesney & Nichols, 2002). [The social gravity of racism
as it works through the modalities of everyday language, relations, and
cultural expressions has to be taken seriously in any antiracist
politics, but such a concern and mode of theorizing must also be
accompanied by an equally serious interest in the rise of corporate
power and the role of state institutions and agencies in shaping
contemporary forms of racial subjugation and inequality]{.underline}
(Goldberg & Solomos, 2002, p. 231). [**Racist ideologies**, practices,
state formations, and institutional relations can be exposed
pedagogically and linguistically, but they **cannot be resolved** merely
**in the realm of the discursive**]{.underline}. Hence, any viable
antiracist pedagogy needs to draw attention between critique and social
transformation, critical modes of analysis and the responsibility of
acting individually and collectively on one's beliefs. [[An]{.mark}other
[important issue that has to be included in any]{.mark} notion of
[antiracist]{.mark} pedagogy and [politics is]{.mark} the issue [of
connecting matters of racial justice to broader]{.mark} and more
comprehensive political, cultural, and [social agendas.]{.mark}
Neoliberalism exerts a powerful force in American life because its
influence and power are spread across a diverse range of political,
economic, social and cultural spheres]{.underline}. Its ubiquity is
matched by its aggressive pedagogical attempts to reshape the totality
of social life in the image of the market, reaching into and connecting
a wide range of seemingly disparate issues that bear down on everyday
life in the United States. Neoliberalism is persuasive because its
language of commercialism, consumerism, privatization, freedom, and
self-interest resonates with, and saturates, so many aspects of public
life. Differences in this discourse are removed from matters of equity
and power and reduced to market niches. [Agency is privatized, and
social values are reduced to market-based interests]{.underline}. And,
of course, [a democracy of citizens is replaced by a democracy of
consumers]{.underline}. Progressives, citizens, and other groups who are
concerned about matters of race and difference need to maintain their
concerns with particular forms of oppression and subordination, but the
limits of various approaches to identity politics must be recognized so
as not to allow them to become either fixed or incapable of making
alliances with other social movements as part of a broader struggle over
particular freedoms and the more generalized freedoms associated with an
inclusive and radical democracy. I have not attempted to be exhaustive
in suggesting what it might mean to recognize and challenge the new
racism that now reproduces more subtle forms of racial subordination,
oppression, and exclusion, though I have tried to point to some
pedagogical and political concerns that connect racism and neoliberal
politics. The color line in America is neither fixed nor static. Racism
as an expression of power and exclusion takes many meanings and forms
under different historical conditions. The emphasis on its socially and
historically constructed nature offers hope because it suggests that
what can be produced by dominant relations of power can also be
challenged and transformed by those who imagine a more utopian and just
world. The challenge of the color line is still with us today and needs
to be recognized not only as a shameful example of racial injustice but
also as a reprehensible attack on the very nature of democracy itself.

#### B.) [Commodification]{.underline}-

#### Focus on sexuality creates a fetishized and commodified version of queerness that re-entrenches capitalism

**McNamara, 2k** (Liam, academic and philosopher of queer theory, "The
Political Economy of Sex" "Profit and Pleasure: Sexual Identities in
Late Capitalism," Culture Machine, Reviews, Rosemary Hennessey,
http://www.culturemachine.net/index.php/cm/rt/printerFriendly/229/210)\--CRG

[This leads Hennessey to question forms of [queer visibility in
commodity culture]{.mark}]{.underline}. She uses drag as an example,
which for Judith Butler is [a ludic form of sexuality which through
theatricality and parody exposes discursive forms of sexuality that
shape identity]{.underline}. However, [Hennessey points out [\'even the
option of drag as a flexible sexual identity depends on the availability
not only of certain discourses of sexuality, aesthetics, style, and
glamour but also of a global circuit of commodity production, exchange,
and consumption specific to industrialized economies\']{.mark}
(]{.underline}P&P, 120). Drag is not enabling for everybody, and since
this sexual identity is severed from general historical processes,
Hennessey feels [Butler has merely fetishized an emergent postmodern
sexuality.]{.underline} However, it is worth pointing out that Hennessey
is not suggesting Butler is wrong in celebrating drag, but that she has
overlooked how productive forces underpin such developments, and how
discourses of sexual liberation may merely be a source of \'relative
deprivation\' for the less affluent. Hennessey\'s theoretical stance is
interesting, because she is explicitly trying to link theories of
commodification with sexuality, and has resisted an uncritical
celebration of the new postmodern sexualities. Similarly, [Hennessey
displays scepticism for Foucaultian technologies of the self, since not
everybody has the money or consumer finesse to indulge in this
process]{.underline}. In fact, [[the discourse of heteronormativity that
is subverted]{.mark} in film and fashion can be linked to a less
gendered professional workplace that has emerged through an
aestheticization of everyday life, as opposed to a more general form of
liberation desired by Hennessey]{.underline}. The new postmodern
sexualities can be a means of disguising relations of production through
a spurious egalitarianism; such a process occludes the issue of class.
[A good example of this is the contemporary exploitation of the \'pink
pound\', since middle-class homosexuals tend to have a high disposable
income.]{.underline} In order to illustrate this point, and to oppose a
historical approach to cultural materialism, Hennessey examines the film
The Crying Game. The way she has addressed this point is by attempting
to show how both sexual and political themes have featured in
representations of the empire \-- Hennessey contends that cinema has a
mythic function because the political subtext of the film is repressed.
The Crying Game is one of these postmodern myths that suggests sexual
identity is a masquerade, but undercuts this radical suggestion by
turning the film into a simple \'unveiling of a secret\'; the putative
radical stance of the film emerges through the heterosexual imaginary,
that is, heterosexual forms of meaning making. Through a Lacanian
reading of desire Hennessey suggests that a fascination for transvestism
is due to its exposure of the illusory status of the phallus (i.e.
sexual difference emerges through the cultural matrix of language). The
Crying Game suggests that womanhood may not be determined biologically,
but is predicated on the presence/absence of the phallus. However,
because the film disapproves of and punishes the phallic woman and
valorizes the man who is in essence a woman (more woman than the phallic
woman), the film remains loyal to the heterosexual imaginary and
gendered sex roles. Hennessey deepens the analysis by linking this
sexual ambivalence to the aestheticization of everyday life \-- in a
commodified lifeworld the phallus may circulate more freely. [This also
uncovers a political subtext, where postcolonial anxieties about lost
phallic power are displaced onto a sexual ambivalence encoded by the
heterosexual imaginary]{.underline}. In turn, the issue of race is
repressed. Overall, Hennessey\'s reading of this film points out how the
issue of class and race has receded in the face of the twin hegemonies
of postmodern sexuality and postcolonial discourse, and The Crying Game
offers an essentialist and conservative view of the \'real woman\'. In
the final two chapters, [Hennessey turns to the subject of desire and
revolutionary love]{.underline}. [Critical analysis of sexuality in
political economy has been subsumed by an overly cultural approach,
shifting the area of thought from class to desire.]{.underline} An
example provided is the work of Gayle Rubin, [who switched focus from
commodity production to the role kinship relations play in the formation
of sexuality]{.underline}. Hennessey points out how kinship relations
are in fact mediated by political economy, and cannot be examined in
isolation. In the work of Dorothy Allison we see a move from Marxist
positions to a \'sex-radical\' stance, that tends to equate lust with
desire. It is in a similar vein that Hennessey criticizes the work of
Teresa de Lauretis and Elizabeth Grosz, where desire is valorized as a
revolutionary force that makes connections, which unfortunately seems to
share many of the aims of late capitalism. This conception of queer
desire is ultimately complicit with contemporary consumerist objectives.
Hennessey\'s work has interesting parallels with the work of
Baudrillard, [by uncovering a mirror of production beneath ostensibly
radical feminist theory]{.underline}. Also, these new desiring bodies
have emerged outside the historical generation of the needs of the
majority of women, and so have little connection with genuine everyday
experience. [This can be seen in American welfare reform, where the
sexuality of the poor is targeted by ideologies of \'personal
responsibility\']{.underline}. Hennessey has exposed an implicit
hierarchy of discrimination within bourgeois ideologies of sexual
liberation; the poor are seen as being promiscuous and a welfare state
burden, while the rich are merely \'experimenting\' or enjoying
themselves. [When applied to deprived groups, promiscuity may be
recognized as an imputed characteristic employed for the social
legitimation of bourgeois sexual mores.]{.underline}

#### C.) [Recentering sexuality]{.underline}-

#### The aff's discussion of heteronormativity re-entrenches sexuality norms which hold up the structure of capitalism 

**McNamara, 2k** (Liam, academic and philosopher of queer theory, "The

In Chapter Three, Hennessey [[attacks the current reigning ideology of
neoliberalism]{.mark}, which involves an increasing drive for profits,
globalization, and a general cultural turn in theory, [lead]{.mark}ing
[to the assimilation of critical theory by the
academy]{.mark}]{.underline}. **[[This has lead to the abandonment of
Marxism and its substitution by cultural
materialism]{.mark}.]{.underline}** Hennessey tries to turn the argument
back to theories of exploitation, ultimately rejecting overdetermination
in favour of commodity fetishism. She explicitly [[links
heteronormativity to the emergence of the commodity form, since it is
the division of labour that]{.mark} has [allowed]{.mark} [the formation
of new sexual subjectivities]{.mark} in the consumer
society]{.underline}. This liberation of productive forces has enabled
the emergence of new desiring subjects that escape the heterosexual
norm, but this development is underpinned by a new patriarchal hierarchy
ushering in a renascent form of heteronormativity. Hennessey points out
how in the nineteenth century sexology and psychoanalytic discourses
allowed for new divergent sexual identities that were swiftly
reterritorialized under the \'perversions\'. [Heteronormative paradigms
have gone on to manage desire by restricting queer desire to the
perversions]{.underline}. Basically Hennessey is trying to historicize
Cixous\' ideas of a \'patriarchal binary logic\' and the persistence of
gendered active/passive roles of sexuality.6 Hennessey [[links sexual
liberation to economic imperatives]{.mark} and the division of labour in
addition to the conventional cultural explanations, and [suggests that
desire has been managed and moved away from procreative norms due
to]{.mark} the demands of the [new productive forces found in mass
consumption]{.mark}]{.underline}. Hennessey\'s stance shows a critical
understanding of sexual liberation, by the introduction of the theory of
class. Hennessey points out: \'capitalism does not require
heteronormative families or even a gendered division of labour. What it
does require is an unequal division of labour\' (P&P, 105). [[Some gay
men have adopted the ideology of the famil]{.underline}y]{.mark}, but
this ideology is generally compulsory for the disadvantaged. At bottom,
what is needed is commodity exchange and surplus value for the few not
many. **[[Capitalism still relies on heterosexuality for the
poor]{.underline}]{.mark}**, and the new non-normative forms of
sexuality are generally reserved for the affluent consumer
subjectivities. [These [emergent \'postmodern sexualities\' are
compatible with the new liquescent forms of the commodity]{.mark},
possessing a fluidity that has an affinity with the new consumer
ethos.]{.underline}

#### Queering performances reinscribe the bourgeois fetishized identity. This forecloses the possibility of social transformation.

Critique, 29, 31-76

To sum up, [[my reading of Butler\'s work suggests several points about
the materiality of sexuality]{.mark} that are politically important to
queer theory and politics]{.underline}. First of all, if the materiality
of social life is taken to be an ensemble of economic, political, and
ideological production, [[we can]{.underline}]{.mark} still
[[acknowledge that the coherent sex-gender identities heterosexuality
secures may be fabrications]{.underline}]{.mark} always in need of
repair, [[but their fragility can be seen not as the property of some
restlessness in language itself but as the effect of social
struggle.]{.mark} Second, [the meanings that are taken to be \"real\"
are so because they help secure a certain social
order]{.mark}**,**]{.underline} an order that is naturalized as the way
things are or should be and that \"illegitimate\" meanings to some
degree threaten. [Because it is the social order-the distribution of
wealth, resources, and power-that is at stake in the struggle over
meanings, [a politics that contests the prevailing constructions of
sexual identity and that aims to disrupt the regimes they support will
need to address more than discourse]{.mark}]{.underline}. Third, the
naturalized version of sexual identity that currently dominates in the
United States as well as the oppositional versions that contest it are
conditioned by more than just their local contexts of reception. [Any
specific situation is made possible and affected by dimensions of social
life that exceed it. A social practice like drag**,**]{.underline} then,
[needs to be analyzed]{.underline} at several levels: in terms of the
conjunctural situation (whether you are looking at what drag means when
walking a ball in Harlem or turning a trick in the Village, performing
in a Hasty Pudding revue at Harvard or hoping to pass in Pocatello); in
terms of its place in the social formation (whether this local scene
occurs in an urban or rural area, in the United States, Germany,
Nicaragua, or India, at the turn of the 20th or of the 21st century);
and [[in terms of the global relations that this situation is tied
to-how even the option of drag as a flexible sexual identity depends on
the availability not only of certain discourses of sexuality,
aesthetics, style, and glamour, but also of a circuit of commodity
production, exchange, and consumption specific to industrialized
economies]{.underline}]{.mark}. Recognizing that signs are sites of
social struggle, then, ultimately leads us to inquire into the social
conditions that enable and perhaps even foster the slipping and sliding
of signification. [Is the subversiveness of a selfconsciously
performative identity like drag at risk if we inquire into certain of
the other social relations-the relations of labor, for instance- that
help enable it? What is the consequence of a theory that does not allow
this kind of question?]{.underline} I want to suggest that [[one
consequence is the risk of promoting an up-dated, postmodern,
reinscription of the bourgeois subject\'s fetishized identity]{.mark}.
Alienation of any aspect of human life from the network of social
relations that make it possible constitutes the very basis of
fetishization]{.underline}. By limiting her conception of the social to
the discursive, [[Butler unhinges identity from the other material
relations that shape it. Her performative identity recasts bourgeois
humanist individuality as a more fluid and indeterminate series of
subversive bodily acts, but this postmodern subject is severed from the
collective historical processes and struggles through which identities
are produced and circulate]{.mark}.]{.underline} Moreover, in confining
her analysis of the inflection of sexuality by racial, national, or
class difference to specific historical contexts, [[she forecloses the
possibility of marshalling collectivities for social transformation
across differences in historical positioning]{.underline}]{.mark}.

### Resistance (Individual)

failure to value black and brown life, the inability to conceive living
with and in diverse egalitarian communities, becomes the incapacity to
value human life at all. So long as the Left looks on in
despair]{.underline} (or averts its gaze), [capitalism determines the

out of those components of the state that promised to serve the
people.]{.underline} It reinforced strategies for private capital
accumulation, socializing risk and privatizing reward to produce new
forms of extreme inequality. At the same time, neoliberal governance
intensified the coercive power of the state, amping up the police, the
military, and the apparatuses of surveillance[. [Neoliberal ideology

power, institutions are sites of ideological struggle. The capitalist

[museums [to produce and reproduce the subjects it needs. Such subjects
are classed, sexed, raced, and gendered.]{.mark}]{.underline} They are
configured as primitive or civilized, exotic or everyday, foreign or
"like us." Underlying the complex of state projects that establish some
as backwards and others as advanced are political and economic
assumptions regarding natural development and balanced systems. Fossils
elide with fuel; some people are treated as nature; extractivism
signifies progress; and even systems driven by crisis and exploitation
are described in terms of equilibrium. Neoliberal capitalism's
intensified competition pushes the corporate sector to ratchet up this
war for hearts and minds. Museums and other [public institutions become
little more than apparatuses for public relations, resources for
reshaping common sense according to capitalist values and
priorities.]{.underline} [Institutions have been starved into submission
by private interests. No wonder much of the Left does not recognize
itself within them. But the practice deployed by neoliberals to seize
institutions is now being deployed against neoliberal purposes.
Co-optation goes both ways. This is the wager of the insurgent movement
to liberate institutions from the grip of capitalism.]{.underline}

### Resistance (Micro) 

#### **The 1AC's proliferation of micro resistances never spills up to level of social transcendence. their political strategies are inherently individualized. Any affirmative solvency is merely a move within the system of capitalism. Only a universalized theory of emancipation has the political potential to bring about revolution.** 

**Anderson 13** (Kevin\[Professor of Sociology, Political Science and
Feminist Studies at University of California, Santa Barbara\]//TB

[**[Hegel's concrete universal is undoubtedly related to Marx's own
concept of human emancipation]{.underline}**.]{.mark}  In 1859, Marx
famously described capitalism as merely a part of the "prehistory of
human society" (Introduction to the *Critique of Political Economy*, in
MECW, p. 264).  This of course rested upon a concept of socialism, and
of the emancipation of labor.  This theme can be found throughout his
work, as in his youthful *German Ideology* (co-authored by Engels) with
its vision of communist existence as one where the individual would
perform both mental and manual labor, gathering food and also
philosophizing. It marks as well his mature theorizing in *Critique of
the Gotha Program* (1875) about overcoming "the antithesis between
mental and physical labor" (MECW 24, p. 87).

Marx alludes to this notion of a fully emancipated human existence not
only in various shorter texts, but also throughout the central works of
his critique of political economy, from the *Grundrisse* to *Capital*,
as Peter Hudis has shown in his *Marx's Concept of the Alternative to
Capitalism *(Leiden: Brill, 2012).  In the *Grundrisse*, Marx writes:

**[["When the limited bourgeois form is stripped away, what is wealth
other than the universality of individual needs, capacities, pleasures,
productive forces etc., created through universal
exchange?]{.underline}]{.mark}** The full development of human mastery
over the forces of nature, those of so-called nature as well as of
humanity's own nature? The absolute working-out of his creative
potentialities, with no presupposition other than the previous historic
development, which makes this totality of development, i.e. the
development of all human powers as such the end in itself, not as
measured on a *predetermined yardstick? *Where he does not reproduce
himself in one specificity, but produces his totality? Strives not to
remain something he has become, but is in the absolute movement of
becoming?" (*Grundrisse*, p. 488).

**[[A decade later, in Capital, Marx elaborated his concept of commodity
fetishism, wherein human]{.mark} [relations are like those between
things, totally objectified and
instrumentalized]{.mark}.]{.underline}**  To be sure, this is a
distorting lens, but it is also a form of reality, for under capitalism,
that is what human relations "really are."  A most chilling passage. And
while Marx contrasts the subtle and hidden commodity fetish to the open
brutality of feudal domination over the peasantry, his most important
contrast is to the not-yet-society that is nonetheless pregnant within
capitalism itself.  This is where the veil of the fetish that hides the
reality of social relations is to be swept away by the self-activity of
the working class: "The veil is not removed," he writes, until the
production process changes, "until it becomes production by freely
associated human beings and stands under their conscious and planned
control" (Marx, *Capital*, Vol. I, trans. Ben Fowkes, NY: Penguin, 1977,
p. 173, trans. altered). This requires a "material foundation" that has
been developed through a long and painful process, over many centuries
(p. 173).

**[Free and associated labor is also the term Marx used to describe the
Paris Commune of 1871 in the Civil War in France. There, he wrote that
the Commune constituted "the political form as last discovered under
which to work out the economical emancipation of Labour]{.underline}**"
(MECW 22, p. 334).  Similarly, as early as 1843, he had written of the
difference between merely political and fully human emancipation:
"Political emancipation is not the completed contradiction-free form of
human emancipation" ("On the Jewish Question," in Marx, *Early Political
Writings*, edited by Joseph O'Malley, New York: Cambridge University
Press, 1994), p. 34; for a recent discussion of the early Marx's concept
of emancipation, see George Comninel, "Emancipation in Marx's Early
Work," in *Marx for Today*, edited by Marcello Musto, NY: Routledge,
2012, pp. 73-91; see also my *Marx at the Margins* for a discussion of
the limitations of this essay's characterizations of Jews and Judaism.)

Such a dialectical, prefigurative standpoint is a far cry from
Foucault's concept of a plurality of "resistances," a concept that fails
to present a vision of a future in which such resistances might no
longer be necessary.

To be sure, Marx also mentioned "resistance" from time to time, for
example, in his discussion of labor's struggle, against the voracious
demands of capital, for a shorter working day: "As soon as the working
class, stunned at first by the noise and turmoil of the new system of
production, had recovered its senses to some extent, it began to offer
resistance, first of all in England, the native land of large-scale
industry"  (*Capital*, Vol. I, p. 390).  But he tied it to a broader
concept of human emancipation.

Even Holloway, one of Foucault's most incisive critics from the Left,
does not fully elaborate such an emancipatory future at a philosophical
level, grounded as he is in a form of dialectical negativity, that of
Theodor Adorno, in which the positive in the negative is sidelined if
not rejected outright.  As Arvind Ghosh and Peter Hudis write:

"What Holloway fails to single out, however, is that for Marx mere
negativity by itself does not surmount the fetishism of commodities. In
chapter 1 of *Capital*, Marx does not say that that the spell of
commodity fetishism can be broken simply through 'everyday resistance'
or pure negativity. He instead says that the spell of fetishism is
broken when we have 'for a change, association of freely associated
men'" ("Can We Change the World without Taking Power?" *Open Space
Forum* \[India\], October 19,
2005 [[http://www.openspaceforum.net/twiki/tiki-read_article.php?articleId=49]{.underline}](http://www.openspaceforum.net/twiki/tiki-read_article.php?articleId=49) ).
This points to a limitation in Holloway's notion of the "scream," as
mentioned above.

(1[) **[The theories of resistance found in Foucault, and also in many
contemporary debates, exhibit several problems, among them notions of
resistance that fail to distinguish among different types of resistance
to power, whether reactionary or emancipatory.]{.underline}**]{.mark}

a sort of circularity or permanence of resistance -- and of power --
which occludes the possibility of an actual overcoming of capital and
the state in a positive, emancipatory manner.]{.underline}]{.mark}**

\(3\) The Great Refusal of Marcuse, which Foucault unjustly attacks, is
a key example of a truly emancipatory politics. At the same time,
however, Marcuse's Great Refusal is too abstra[c]{.mark}t, with vestiges
of Kantian formalism, thus providing an opening to the kind of critique
Foucault makes.

emancipation shows that his general dialectic -- rooted in Hegel --- is

race, ethnicity and nationalism in relation to class and to revolution
remains very relevant today, as seen for example in the British youth

forms of opposition to capital and their need to connect to the working
classes of more technologically developed sectors]{.underline}** (and
vice versa). **[The persistence of these issues can be seen most

### Refusal 

#### Refusal is a strategy which cedes institutions to neoliberal interests---this not only reproduces capitalist and colonial ideologies but ensures massive violence against the most disadvantaged communities. Reclaiming public institutions must become a central part of organizing.

**Not An Alternative 16** (New York-Based Collective and Non-Profit
Organization That Works at the Intersection of Art, Activism and
Pedagogy "Institutional Liberation" *E-Flux* 77) NIJ

[**[Refusal and subtraction have been disastrous as Left political
tactics.]{.underline}** [They have surrendered the power aggregated in
institutions to capital and the state.]{.underline}]{.mark} [The tactics
of institutional liberation treat institutions as tools, weapons, and
bases of political struggle. They take on and over the institution's
radical premise: the collectivity and futurity that underpins any
collection.]{.underline} The force that comes from organization,
collectivity, and institutionality, the symbolic power that accompanies
and exceeds aggregation, becomes a resource for the Left, a resource
that enables us to combine and scale. [**[Many can be more powerful than
few, but only when they are organized.]{.underline}** [Contemporary
capitalism]{.underline}]{.mark} relies on dispersing us into
powerlessness. It [[celebrates individualism]{.mark} and uniqueness, as
if one person alone could bring down the fossil fuel economy. [This
individualist dream entraps us in the nightmare of accelerating
inequality and ecological devastation. Institutional liberation claims
the power of collectivity, **the necessity of alliance, combination, and
commonality in struggle.**]{.mark}]{.underline} This is why we see today
the appearance and reappearance of common images, names, and tactics.
[The various projects we see combining into an emergent movement for
[institutional liberation **do not value critique qua
critique.**]{.mark}]{.underline} [They turn the institution against
itself, side with its better nature, and force others to take a side.
They look for allies, "double agents" already working within the
institution, reinforce them, and in so doing activate the power that is
already there. **[Institutional liberation is not reformist.]{.mark}**
It does not simply expose our complicities with state and capital. It
directs its critical perspective in the service of a broader political
movement, treating institutions as forms to be seized and connected into
a counterpower infrastructure. [The liberation of institutions]{.mark}
will not result from any singular procedure. **[It depends on sustained
pressure, a commitment to long-term struggle.]{.mark}**]{.underline}
More than a critique of institutions---because, face it, at this point
the inequality, oppression, and violence of the capitalist state is not
a mystery to be solved but a system to be abolished---[institutional
liberation affirms the productive and creative dimension of collective
struggle. [Our actions are not]{.mark} simply [against. They are for:
for emancipation, equality, collectivity, and the commons. Institutional
liberation]{.mark} is not a messianic event. It [is the building of
counterpower infrastructure.]{.mark} Once they take the side of the
common, institutions liberate themselves from capitalist interests
endeavoring to control and exploit them. So [institutional liberation
isn't about making institutions better, more inclusive, more
participatory. It's about establishing politicized base camps from which
ever more coordinated, elaborate, and effective campaigns against the
capitalist state in all its racist, exploitative, extractivist, and
colonizing dimensions can be carried out.]{.mark} This takeover will not
happen overnight. But it is happening now at an international scale,
accumulating force and momentum with every repetition of a common name
and image, every iteration of associated acts: red lines, red squares,
arrayed tents, money drops, blockades, occupations.]{.underline}

### Telos/Solvency 

#### Through the desire for productivity through solvency/impact scenarios, debate has become an activity where only those who are able to fulfill their neoliberal obligations can exist -- they are the state maintaining neoliberal hegemony over our discourse

**Hall 19 (**Richard Hall is Professor of Education and Technology at De
Montfort University, and a National Teaching Fellow. He is a Director of
Leicester Vaughan College, a trustee of the Open Library of Humanities,

Fifth, and crucially, this parasitisation reflects ideals of hegemonic
masculinity (Newman 2012) [and methodological whiteness]{.underline}
(Bhambra 2017), [which impose specific norms upon]{.underline} social
reproduction and [productive life. Specific bodies have to comply with
white, male, cisnormative and ableist norms in order to gain access to
and then progress inside institutions]{.underline}. Meanwhile, the
[everyday reproduction of this hegemony rests disproportionately upon
the labour of women and people of colour.]{.underline} Finally, this is
reinforced through a new, authoritarian normal at the level of society,
seen in the use of the C51 law in Canada to stifle protest and the use
of kettling as a method of crowd control against student and academic
protesters globally (Bruff 2012). These characteristics highlight how
the State is predicated upon governing 'the common affairs of the whole
bourgeoisie', such that no sector of the economy stands outside those
common affairs (Marx and Engels 2002, p. 82, emphasis in original). As
crisis is amplified, the [State takes on a more authoritarian role in
maintaining hegemony through a discourse that protects the circuits of
capital accumulation]{.underline} (Tansel 2017). Moreover, Aztlán (2017)
argues that authoritarian government instils a strategy of repression
rooted in a reinvigoration of oppressive tactics towards marginalised
groups. Thus, migrants and refugees, single parents, unemployed people,
those with disabilities and so on, find limited access to social goods
like welfare because they are economically unproductive. This imposes
conditions perceived to be optimal for the production, circulation and
accumulation of value because such disciplinary tactics encourage the
development of human capital (Azar 2015). Crucially, inside a totalising
economic structure prone to crisis, more individuals are thrown from the
core to the margins of society as work becomes precarious or outsourced,
and as labour market reforms redefine the relationship between the
individual and the market. Academic labourers have a key role in this,
including their responsibility for the production of knowledge that
reproduces hegemony. As knowledge is made productive of value and
commodified this increases the pressures of proletarianisation across an
educational terrain. For instance, the imposition of teaching and
research excellence metrics creates a field of performance management
that discipline academic work around fetishised ideas of impact. These
condition that work around the exploitation of existing human and
intellectual capital for particular economic ends. Equally, The
deployment of precarious labour conditions the labour-power of full-time
academics who may or may not be on permanent contracts, because it
creates a reserve army of surplus, cheap labour able to deliver
comparable teaching, assessment and scholarship. Moreover, there have
been an expansion in internationalisation strategies predicated upon
educational commodity-dumping in the global South, and the extraction of
commodity skills from the South to the North (Harris et al. 2012).

### University 

#### The affirmative's intellectual project doesn't simply become commodified by the university, it creates the desire to be commodified.

**Clarke 15** (Paul Clarke is a Lecturer in Performance Studies @ The
University of Bristol "The Impact Market: The complicity of
practitioner-researchers in 'the spread of the university beyond the
university'" *Performance Research* 20, no. 4, pp. 115-120)//NotJacob

[[The]{.underline} [university territorializes new
knowledges]{.underline}]{.mark}[, which can be taught and exploited as
cultural or economic capital;]{.underline} to use Harney and Moten's
analogy[, [it]{.underline}]{.mark} ['[encircle\[es them with\] war
wagons' (2013:34) in order to capitalize on them]{.mark}.]{.underline}
Looked at from this perspective, my 2003 paper played a role in the
discursive enclosure of 'expert practices' (Melrose 2007) in the
institution's unfolding encyclopaedia of knowledge and power[.
[Practical action and doing performance work, which once belonged to the
sphere of praxis]{.mark}, [have become part of the realm of knowledge
and belong to the university as intellectual
property]{.mark}.]{.underline} Practices that were felt to be 'just
intuitive' (Melrose 2005) have been named properly, as
'expert-performancepractitioner-centred modes of knowledge and models of
intelligibility' (Melrose 2007), embodied thinking or somatic knowing.
[With performance becoming valued as a subject, and with the
legitimation of practice-as-research, comes the ability to regulate its
unruly ways and imprecise languages -- [to bring those who make this
object of study within the university, its disciplines and
governance]{.mark}. In the 1980s and early 1990s it might have been
possible to work in the academy and borrow its resources to create
professional practice outside.]{.underline} But, since the admission of
practical research outcomes in HEFCE's 1996 Research Assessment Exercise
(RAE) and the embedding of practice-as-research in UK research culture,
the field of performance has been territorialized and work presented
professionally counts as university product. There are few
socio-cultural spaces beyond the scope of the REF and its new impact
agenda, and in order to be a practitioner in the university you must
demonstrate the excellence of work produced outside, plus evidence of
external recognition. While the intellectual 'worthiness' (Melrose 2002)
of practice-as-research and the counting of impact has strengthened the
position of practitioners in universities and their potential for
progression or promotion, this inclusion has undoubtedly influenced
their creative activities. The debt that the performancemaker 'owes to
the academy' for their entry is to 'incorporate\[, in their work,\] a
scholarly apparatus that enables \[their peers\] to assess \[its\] value
and significance ... as the results of ... research' (Cooper 2005, np).
The 'obligation' is to make art with a research imperative and to
produce excellence within the frame of the REF, which values practice if
'enhancements' are produced 'in knowledge and understanding in the
discipline' (ibid.). This transforms the aims and aspirations of
university practitioners, their ways of practising performance and the
form of artwork produced, the quality of which is assessed according to
criteria for research and impact rather than aesthetic judgements. In
spite of the above, in the hierarchy of knowledge, monographs and
peer-reviewed articles, like this one, still rule. Performance can only
pass as research when accompanied by framing discursive documents -- 300
word statements and questions, which are admittedly often written
retrospectively, after the practical research has concluded and its
outcomes are known. As Conquergood (2002) wrote thirteen years ago in
his article 'Performance studies: Interventions and radical research',
'knowing how' (146) remains a 'subjugated knowledge' (Foucault 1980:81),
struggling for its place. As he said then, 'promotion committees
dominated by the more institutionally powerful scholars \[... still\] do
not know how to appraise a record of artistic accomplishment
commensurate with traditional criteria of scholarly research and
publication' (Conquergood 2002:153). Despite doing the necessary labour
of teaching performance practice and producing impact, as a
practitioner-researcher my position continues to feel weak and at risk,
like an uninvited guest or imposter in the academy. In addition there is
an ongoing fight to maintain the hours allocated for workshops, to
justify the low staffstudent ratios necessary and the inefficiency of
practice-based teaching, which fails to produce more student
satisfaction in the National Student Survey (NSS) for less contact
hours. Having internalized the precarity that even those of us on
permanent contracts feel, I place an obligation on myself to fulfil all
aspects of my role professionally and responsibly, perform
self-assurance, compete effectively with other researchers (especially
in UOA 35, Music, Drama, Dance and Performing Arts) and continue my
professional development. I acknowledge the way that my subjectivity has
been fabricated by the university and shaped by our precarious positions
in it. Hence I cannot resist the desire to do well in the next REF,
feeling driven to attempt to produce research excellence and be
impactful. My subjectivity is one of the outputs of the institutional
apparatus and I reproduce the university, HEFCE and Arts Council
England's values and ways of thinking as my own aspirations, putting
myself into my work and wanting it to 'influenc\[e\] civil society and
quality of life', to believe in this vision and the need to capture such
contributions. For all this writing of subversion I may not have the
autonomous agency or self-determination to resist, or be 'disobedient'
in Virno's terms (Virno 2004; see also Lazzarato 2010). As well as the
good citizenship discussed above, the format of Bristol's academic CV
has a category for 'Entrepreneurship', a further academic responsibility
to determine routes to market for research outputs and develop their
competitiveness. Each institution's environment statement for REF 2014
and impact case studies also accounted for academic enterprise,
contribution 'to economic prosperity' (REF 2012) and scholars'
relationships with cultural and creative industries.6 I am an artistic
director of Uninvited Guests and this company limited by guarantee was
listed on the Environment Template along with its income. Here the
professional world, 'the industries of creativity' 6 The REF 2014
Environment Template provides an account of the university department,
or unit of assessment's research strategy, people and staff development,
income, statistical data, infrastructure and facilities, collaboration
with other institutions or industries and contribution to the discipline
or research base (see REF 2012). (Raunig 2013) and culture exterior to
the university are encircled or brought inside its expanded walls.
Uninvited Guests, its producers and those employed by it, become
university workers by proxy, as they transfer practiceframed-as-research
to wider audiences, whose number and diversity are measured. We may ask
whether Uninvited Guests therefore reproduces the university and
performs its social work in the private-public spheres beyond, whether
its performers are unwitting agents or representatives of the
university, marketing and distributing its knowledge, know-how and
vision. The Department of Drama's Environment Template measured the
quality of Uninvited Guests' performances by financial income,
transformed audiences and reception into figures and capital, and
quantified dissemination. It is worth noting that there is a double
counting of Uninvited Guests' output of impact and that Arts Council
England (ACE), who fund the work, also use the neoliberal language of
instrumentalization, social change and transformation. The company has
received project funding from Grants for the arts and ACE for a number
of research and development (R&D), production processes and national
tours. The Arts Council's website 'talk\[s\] about the value of arts and
culture to society', how -- in addition to art's 'intrinsic value' --
they 'cherish' the ways it 'can illuminate our inner lives and enrich
our emotional world', along with producing 'more measurable impact on
our economy, health and wellbeing, society and culture' (2014). ACE
encourages the professionalization of artists as entrepreneurs, uses the
terminology of the transformation economy (see Pine and Gilmore 2001),
and makes demands on publicly funded cultural labourers similar to those
asked of academic researchers -- that is, to account for and evidence
how their work is applied as an instrument of personal and social
change, its extrinsic use-value: excellence in impact translates into
investment as much as intrinsic aesthetic quality, and the latter may
only accrue cultural capital. It could also be argued that, as well as
art experiences, the Arts Council and state's ethos, ideology and
policies are disseminated or reproduced through touring to new
neighbourhoods and diversifying audiences. With Arts Council England and
funded venues operating within the same neoliberal conditions and
policies as the university, being required to evidence their efficiency
and efficacy, they subject arts producers to related impact agendas and
evaluative metrics -- apparatuses for accounting for interactions and
engagement. [While 'defection' from the university to the professional
or public context is an option, it does not 'modify the conditions
within which the struggle takes place', constitute an 'exit' or afford
further autonomy, as the professional practitioner remains in service to
the production of impact, in order to justify investment, and also to
art market forces]{.underline} (Virno 2004:70). Closely related
dispositifs -- management instruments, financialized languages and
evaluative frameworks -- determine artists\' drive to innovate and the
association of practices with capital, both within and beyond the
university. The business or profession of performance- making was once
resistant to the production of commodities or exchangeable objects.
Rather than producing material or durable goods, [the outputs of this
cooperative labour were cultural products that became themselves through
disappearance.]{.underline} For Marx (1990 \[1976\]), [in]{.underline}
the case of [teaching and performing, the product was inseparable from
the act]{.underline} of producing and the producer; they were
activities-without-end- product, like personal services. Performance, as
Virno (2004) writes, 'is an activity which finds its own ... purpose ...
in itself, without objectifying itself into ... a "finished product," or
into an object which would survive the performance' (52). For him,
theatre or performance 'requires the presence of others' (52) and
interactions, and is hence closely aligned to praxis, the vita activa
and political action. As I have noted, [[work has appropriated the
activities of]{.mark} [praxi]{.mark}s]{.underline}, [the political and
social interactions that took place in the territory of politics and
leisure[, turning these to the public good of the private
company]{.mark} -- or in this case the university -- [and its
ethos]{.mark}.]{.underline} [Our economic model has shifted from
'general intellect']{.underline} (Marx 1993 \[1972\]: 706), [in which
the common mode of labour is cognitive, to 'general
performance']{.underline} (Lütticken 2012), in which the majority of
[workers]{.underline} across diverse fields and forms are expected to
[perform themselves publicly, improve their performance and produce
immaterial goods, such as relationships with customers and colleagues,
positive feelings and affects]{.underline}. As Hardt and Negri (2004)
write, [contemporary labour 'from sales work to financial services, is
fundamentally a performance: the product is the act itself']{.underline}
(200). In our post-Fordist times, cultural industry, and specifically
performance, has become the 'industry of the means of production' (Virno
2004: 61). ['Performance has been put to work']{.underline} (Hardt and
Negri 2004: 200) and it is 'the special capabilities of \[the\]
performing artist' (Virno 2004: 52), their virtuosities, which are the
contemporary tools, techniques and procedures of the means of
production. If workers are generally expected to perform their labour,
then performance abilities appreciate as embodied assets in people as
'enterprises' (Lazzarato 2012: 56). How does studying performance
through practice resist the production of human capital and producing
graduates as virtuosic 'entrepreneurs of themselves' (Foucault 2008:
226)? The language of theatre and performance is prevalent in business
schools and management studies, with Pine and Gilmore (2001) writing of
companies staging unique events -- shopping and dining experiences -- in
which the work 'perishes upon its performance' but 'the value of the
experience lingers in the memories of individuals engaged by the event'
([80). This chimes with performance studies' thinking around the way
that performance both disappears and remain]{.underline}s (see Phelan
1993 and Schneider 2011[)]{.mark}. [What does this context of an economy
of experience, affects and transformation mean for the politics or
ethics of teaching practical performance -- producing students
well-trained in the means of production,]{.underline} for experiential
approaches to research and for the radical potential of companies like
Uninvited Guests, which stage experiences or market unique,
participatory performance events? In conclusion I will return to
Conquergood, whose 2002 article, subtitled 'Interventions and radical
research', was a foundational text for the inclusion of practice and
applied performance research in the academy. In it he proposed 'braiding
together disparate and stratified ways of knowing' (152), crisscrossing
between 'activity and analysis, ... thinking and doing, interpreting and
making (153), in order to challenge the academy's 'deeply entrenched
division of labor', hierarchy of value and organization of knowledge.
What I would ask now is whether his mission to triangulate 'practical
knowledge, ... propositional knowledge and politic\[al\]' action remains
resistant[, if these spheres are already hybridized as scholarly work
and part of the university's terrain. It]{.underline} i[s precisely
these hybrid modes that the academic institution currently seeks to
develop and capitalize upon, through enterprise and networking with
creative industries, and through engaging with diverse publics in order
to generate measurable impact.]{.underline} Conquergood writes
optimistically of research projects that reach outside the academy, of
performance studies' workers engaging with 'activism, outreach' (152),
making meaningful connections and social commitments to communities --
of political praxis. In the context of the contemporary university we
need to consider the territorializing as well as radical possibilities
of such articulations. [[How can creative practice fulfil its
transgressive promise when it is institutionalized, transformed into the
university's impact, enterprise and product mix?]{.underline}]{.mark}
[If these activities are in the university and part of the work that a
professional academic is contracted for, [they can be acquired,
commodified, managed and marketed by the
university.]{.mark}]{.underline} [[The academy has embraced different
ways of knowing, but to what end and are these modes of knowledge any
less subjugated?]{.underline}]{.mark} Under these late capitalist
conditions, [[can performance practice still generate fugitivity escape
capture as knowledge or unsettle the 'encyclopedic circle of the
\[state\] university']{.mark} (]{.underline}Harney and Moten 2013: 34)?
As Isabell Lorey (2010) proposes, can socio-political affects, impacts
and exchanges with others retain a 'capacity for refusal', resisting
being entirely measured or 'economicized' (5)? Are there 'surpluses'
that cannot be capitalized on, 'absorbed' or 'wholly determined' by the
institution, which produce 'potentialities of resistance'? Can
subversive intellectuals save some autonomous time for inconvenient
academic freedom, inefficient and unprofessional activities, including
study in Harney and Moten's terms, without 'knowledge production' (12),
output, credit or end? Can the 'refugee colony' of practitioner
researchers, of which I am one, retain the subversive potential 'to be
in but not of the university' (26), to steal into the academy and poach
its resources, to intervene, as Conquergood claimed[[? Or do we borrow
from the university solely for the university's benefit?]{.mark} [As a
virtue of being incorporated in the neoliberal institution, are our
subjectivities produced and shaped, such that, whether we are practising
inside or outside]{.mark}]{.underline}[, [we are of the university,
embodying ways of thinking, desires and aspirations that mimic
institutional drives, values and vision]{.underline}]{.mark}? Or, in
Lazzarato's terms, can immaterial and cognitive wage-labourers access
non- exploitative temporalities, in which antagonistic subjectivities
may form themselves or be created, politically, intellectually and
imaginatively independent of the interests of university and state
productivity: can our practices be dissociated from capital and returned
to common sense or collective knowledge, as public goods? (See Lazzarato
2010 and Chukrov 2010.)

### Black Women's Labor 

#### The question is not about degrees of shared concern, but the direction of our political energies. The affirmative's refusal to take up the Leninist question "what is to be done" isn't simply something missing from their project, but a negative stance which trades off with action. This is particularly true in context of Black women's labor.

**Russell 17** (Shana, ""I Wanted to See for Myself the First Land of
Socialism": Black American Women and the Russian Revolution"

NIJ

As a young Marxist and a member of the Science & Society Manuscript
Collective, I am almost ashamed to say that, until recently, [the
Russian Revolution]{.underline} had very little, if any, significance to
me. It [seemed far removed from the experiences of]{.underline} my
research subjects, [black working women in the United
States.]{.underline} It was European history and therefore tangential to
the history of the African Diaspora. The Soviet Union was nothing more
than the cause of nostalgia for my elder comrades. [I know
now]{.underline} how wrong [that]{.underline} perception was. [[The
revolution of 1917 was inextricably linked with the histories of
decolonization in Africa and black liberation in the United
States.]{.mark} It was the underexamined archives of black women labor
activists that showed me just how important the Revolution
was]{.underline}, and is, to me one century later. In the archives of
Esther Cooper and James Jackson, I discovered a document that would give
the Soviet Union real significance for me, as the daughter of four
generations of black domestic workers. [Esther [Cooper's Master's
Thesis]{.mark}]{.underline}, \"The Negro Woman Domestic Worker in
Relation to Trade Unionism\" [[posited the Russian Revolution as a
pivotal moment for domestic workers in the Soviet Union and an
achievable ideal for black women in the United
States]{.mark}.]{.underline} In the two decades after 1917, [[dozens of
black women made the pilgrimage to the USSR and returned to the United
States with a new vision of freedom for themselves as workers, as women,
and as African Americans.]{.mark}]{.underline} While the Revolution of
1917 raged on in Russia, George P. and Esther Irving Cooper welcomed
their daughter Esther into the world. The Coopers were quintessential
black progressives. [They embraced the kind of social justice that
centered on middle-class upward mobility, education, and racial
uplift]{.underline} (Haviland, 2015, 15; McDuffie, 2011, 100). Cooper's
family does arouse a certain scholarly curiosity. In historian Erik
McDuffie's words, what moves \"a young woman reared in a \'talented
tenth,\' southern black family towards the Left?" (2011, 11) Cooper's
answer: the Soviet Union through the eyes of domestic workers. Cooper's
prophetic vision for domestic workers came to her while she was a
graduate student at Fisk University, a historically black institution in
Nashville, Tennessee. She enrolled in 1938 after finishing her
undergraduate studies at Oberlin. While there, she was invited by a
professor into \"a little \'Anne Frank\'-type room at the back of his
house where he lifted up the curtains and it was just full of books by
Marx, Lenin, \[and\] the Communist international.\" While researching
her thesis Cooper was active in a Marxist study circle made up of mostly
professors. By the time she completed her studies at Fisk just two years
later, Cooper was officially a member of the American Communist Party
(CPUSA). (Kelley, 1990, 205; McDuffie, 2011, 103) I imagine Cooper
discovered the Revolution somewhere on that hidden bookshelf in
Nashville and that this discovery led her to the belief that the Soviet
Union represented a new vision for domestic workers in the United
States. The second chapter of her thesis, entitled \"Frontiers of
American Trade Unionism,\" briefly charted the experiences of domestic
workers in Russia before and after 1917. \"The change of the position of
domestic workers in Russia is a very impressive one,\" Cooper began. She
continued: [Before the Russian Revolution, domestic workers in the
cities often worked from dawn to darkness. [The living conditions of
workers living-in were inadequate]{.mark}]{.underline}: a cot in the
hallway, closet or kitchen was often the only place that the domestic
servant had to sleep. The food which the workers prepared was served to
the employer, while the worker ate food with little nutritive content.
The pay was little and vacations were unheard of. [[The working
conditions in Russia before the Revolution mirrored those of black
live-in domestic workers in the United States.]{.underline}]{.mark}
According to Cooper, after 1917 Soviet domestics were able to form trade
unions which led to more comprehensive labor rights and better working
conditions. But what mattered most to Cooper was the absence of the
stigma associated with household labor. \"[[The social standing of
domestic workers]{.mark},\" she stated, \"[is equal to any other
workers.\"]{.mark}]{.underline} (Cooper, 1940, 29--30) [Cooper's thesis
remains one of her most groundbreaking achievements]{.underline} and is
unlike anything written before or since. Historian Erik McDuffie argues
[that it is "the most thorough sociological and historical study written
on the working conditions and status of black women household workers
and their efforts to unionize during the Depres- sion."]{.underline}
(2008, 203) Yet, in America, [[the stigma attached to domestic work was
a racial one.]{.mark} The treatment of black household laborers and
their position on the social hierarchy was a carryover from
enslavement.]{.underline} In spite of this key difference, Cooper
remained hopeful. In her words: \"[The domestic workers' unions in the
United States have before them the experiences of unions of domestic
workers in European countries. . . . The outlook for domestic workers'
unions does not look so dark when we consider the struggles which other
unions have had."]{.underline} (Cooper, 1940, 30) In the decades since
the publication of Cooper's thesis, the demographics of domestic work
have changed, but the stigma still remains. [[The African, Caribbean,
Asian, and Latin American immigrant women who do household labor are the
most disenfranchised group of workers in the United States. They are
excluded from a number of basic labor protections granted to all
American workers]{.underline}]{.mark} by the Fair Labor Standards and
Social Security Acts. [Yet]{.underline}, like the subjects of Cooper's
thesis, [these women are also a part of an active resistance movement
that seeks to organize and empower domestic workers to demand their
rights.]{.underline} These contemporary activists honor Cooper as the
foremother of the current movement. [Her vision, inspired by the
achievements of Soviet domestic workers, has become theirs.]{.underline}
Six years after Cooper completed her thesis, she visited the Soviet
Union for the first time as a part of an all-female delegation hosted by
the Soviet Anti-Fascist Youth Committee. (Haviland, 2015, 115) During
her six-week stay, Cooper formed long-lasting relationships with

Desert of the Heart is also a novel about social reproduction from a
lesbian standpoint that extends the feminist argument for viewing
nonwage care work as a site of surplus accumulation. My reading, which
contextualizes lesbian reproduction within the story's wider setting of
Reno as a town built from the casino business, attends to the novel's
depictions of the unmet needs created the wake of enterprise. As a
worker, Ann is vital to Reno's casino economy. Ann's [[caring
labor]{.mark} inside [and]{.mark} outside of]{.underline} Frank's Club
where she [work]{.underline}s [and]{.underline} her [[search for
kinship]{.underline}]{.mark} within this framework

arguments of Maria Dalla Costa and Selma James on this point: "[the
ideology of the family [performs a]{.mark} kind of [mopping-up

provide for those capable of living up to its norms of family form and
responsibility]{.underline}" (Weeks The Problem with Work 121).

[[Neoliberal deregulation taps into cultural aspirations toward
nonconventional, nonheteronormative kinship in ways that re-code and

enterprise pulls every strand of Reno's social life into its orbit,
Ann's attentive labor outside of the casino functions to corroborate
sexual deregulation through the deregulation of her labor, which becomes
re-absorbed into the narrative as lesbian kinship. Sexual deregulation
in the form of nonheteronormative kinship reaches its crisis point in
moments where Ann confronts the hidden limits of the casino as an
economic enterprise, which invariably require the fixed yet flexible
compliance of its workers in exchange for the casino's regulation of
Reno's inhabitants.

Desert of the Heart is in many ways a literary counterpart to Betty
Friedan's The Feminine Mystique (1963), which made its critical point in
part through a differentiation between domestic and paid forms of labor.
Read together, Friedan's and Rule's writings document, respectively,
second-wave feminist and lesbian critical engagements with the working
subject-as-enterprising subject. The enterprising subject is one that
rests upon a late-capitalist ideological distinction between
"enterprise" and "labor." Most importantly, as Franco Berardi reminds
us, enterprise is a concept predicated upon the invisibility of
industrial relations in late-capitalist value production:

In its capitalistic meaning, the word enterprise acquires new nuances,
although it never loses its sense of free and constructive action. These
new nuances all pertain to the opposition of labor and enterprise.
Enterprise means invention and free will. Labor is repetition and
executing action. Enterprise is an investment of capital generating new
capital, thanks to the valorization that labor makes possible. Labor is
a wage-earning service that valorizes capital but devalues workers. (77)

Berardi's framework explains the late-capitalist notion that
[[enterprise]{.mark} -- as a category [connoting creativity and growth
as capital produces more capital -- is detached from]{.mark} its
concrete foundation in [labor]{.mark}, thereby [obscuring]{.mark} the
[material conditions upon which enterprise is established]{.mark}. As he
suggests, not only does this mystification compartmentalize capital's
material basis, but it also eclipses the very nature of capital,
[rendering invisible]{.mark} its perpetual [need to expand to new
markets and territories]{.mark}. In this light, enterprise names an
ideological development that masks capital's most insidious
precepts.]{.underline}

While Berardi begins his analysis with the digital industry of the
1980s, Betty Friedan's (1963) "left-conservatism" (Nancy Holmstrom 165)
documents a similar mystification of labor at an earlier point.
Published a year prior to Edge of Twilight, Friedan's Feminine Mystique
begins with the now-famous inquiry into "the problem that has no name"
to take aim at the limited possibilities for women exemplified in "the
domestic routine of the housewife" (Friedan 30). Friedan articulates
particular forms of women's work outside the home -- sometimes phrased
as "creative work of her own"-- as the primary means through which the
trapped woman may come to "know herself as a person" (344) As she
claims, "if a job is to be the way out of the trap as part of a life
plan, it must be a job that she can take seriously as part of a life
plan, work in which she can grow as part of society" (345).

[The enterprise in which Friedan is most interested is [an enterprise of
self-care and personal development]{.mark}]{.underline} through paid
work of a certain caliber. Notably, Friedan calls this process [[a way
for women to realize their full "capacities" as human
beings]{.underline}.]{.mark} Framing capacity as the [[ability for
personal growth]{.underline},]{.mark} The Feminine Mystique emphasizes
the affective component of labor as something that is [[achieved through
a feeling of satisfaction]{.underline}]{.mark} and is only
operationalized once women enter into waged work outside of the home. In
one respect, then, Friedan's argument recognizes that such capacities,
while constituting a form of labor, are nonetheless commonly unwaged (as
in unpaid housework). At the same time, once these labors are valued in
wage form, Friedan's logic reframes them as the means for a woman's
self-realization. In so doing, she overwrites her own tacit but crucial
understanding that domestic care work and paid labor constitute two
sides of the same coin in both the production of surplus value and the
devaluation of feminized labor.

With its near-militant heterosexual worldview, The Feminine Mystique
appears on the surface to have little in common with Desert of the
Heart, published the following year. Much as Friedan describes, however,
the service labor Ann performs in the casino reflects the reorientation
of her feminized capacities via the free market, even as value outside
of those environs remains obscured. As I will discuss below, Frank's
Club produces Ann's caring capacities as entities to be developed
through the market rather than those always at risk of being used up by
it. [[Framed in self-affirming terms]{.underline}]{.mark} evocative of
Friedan, Ann's [[service labor-as-enterprise
illustrates]{.underline}]{.mark} Riccardo Bellofiore's insight regarding
the nature of "[[the command of capital over labor \[to\] assume a
semblance of a control of workers over themselves. The valorization of
capital can masquerade as the self-valorization of
labor]{.underline}]{.mark}" (109). While it is likely that the
particular kinds of labor represented in Desert of the Heart would have
been left out of Feminine Mystique, it is nonetheless instructive to
consider Friedan's ideas as posing uneven but sometimes surprising
points of entry for a writer such as Rule.

To that end, [the casino's role as a place of reproduction establishes
the]{.underline} novel's [overall line of argument as it pertains to
non-heterosexual motherhood both within and beyond the
workplace]{.underline}. Scholarship on Desert of the Heart from the
early 1980s on has taken up various aspects of the novel's ["subtle
subversion" of heterosexuality through]{.underline} unsettling
psychoanalytic categories, [[surrender of poetic voice to deviant
desire]{.mark},]{.underline} or promotion of alternate, lesbian
non-reproductive models of maternity.23 \*BEGIN FOOTNOTE\* See, for
instance, Elaine T. Hansen's examination of "[[nonprocreative
motherhood]{.underline}]{.mark}" where Hansen claims, as Ann and Evelyn
come together in the plot, their respective childlessness [[is
revalued]{.underline}]{.mark}. In tandem they represent the possibility
of maternal feelings and experiences, detached from procreation, no
longer exclusively or essentially defining their womanhood but
nevertheless critical to the complex drives and choices that sustain
their relationship (40). Hansen argues that the novel's rendering of the
successful lesbian nonprocreative form challenges heterosexual
convention through the failure of biological reproduction, since "those
women \[in the story\] who try to care for children to whom they have
given birth seem doomed to fail and suffer" (Hansen 46). \*END
FOOTNOTE\* [Critical [acknowledgment of failed biological
kinship]{.mark}]{.underline} in Desert of the Heart [[is important,
but]{.mark}]{.underline} reading these moments apart from Ann's
attentive labor at the casino only tells half of the story. An
examination of Desert of the Heart's rendition of biological kinship in
conjunction with Ann's work reveals one of the novel's
[[overlooked]{.underline}]{.mark}, yet key, problematics:
[[that]{.underline}]{.mark} is, [[non-procreative kinship's
contradictory significance as something that is not only allowed but
increasingly mandated as an effect of]{.underline}]{.mark} the casino
industry's [[broadening regulation]{.underline} [of]{.underline}]{.mark}
Reno's [[economic and social existence]{.underline}]{.mark}. In this
light, Ann's [ability to perform the duties of the non-biological
caregiver [reveals the exacerbation of social need under deregulated
enterprise, which requires]{.mark}]{.underline} Ann's [[inattention to
the causes that demand her supplemental care for those who have been
disinherited]{.underline}]{.mark} from Reno's main enterprise. In these
moments, the novel's depiction of Ann's maternal role at work
constituting an alternative to blood-line kinship is both initiated by
and articulated through the regulatory framework of the casino.

These developments follow the logic of deregulation writ large: Ann's
formerly regulated care work at the casino increasingly becomes flexible
beyond its domain. In one example, Ann is assigned to be the relief
worker at Frank's for the night, a job, which requires her to rotate
from station to station and take over as each of her co-workers takes
their break. Even though it was a "foul job," Ann is willing to take it
because, as her boss tells her, Ann is "the easiest \[employee\] to
move" (93). Part of the foulness of the job entails the requirement that
Ann "sacrifice her own time off" if her co-workers' breaks run long. As
Frank's flexible surrogate for the evening, Ann carries her change apron
"like a fetus in its seventh month, careful to lift and turn the weight
as if it were her own flesh" (94). The image calls on readers to
register its irony obliquely through Ann's lesbianism, which the text
takes for granted as excluding her from biological motherhood: instead,
Ann's closest proximity to motherhood is through her capacity as a
caregiver at, and attentive supplement to, the casino's operation.

Even more poignantly, however, the passage positions Ann as [the subject
of [maternity without a signified object of care]{.mark}:]{.underline}
like the change that flows into and out of her apron, her attention is
exhaustively disseminated throughout the whole of Frank's Club. Her
[labors model a form of deregulated care, par excellence, because [her
caring]{.mark} is defined by her [a requirement to remain flexible and
accommodating toward whatever needs arise in the
moment]{.mark}.]{.underline} What is invoked here, then, is not a
portrayal of Ann's propensity for [[nonconventional
motherhood]{.underline}]{.mark}, but the casino's ability to [[absorb
the affective and figurative trappings]{.underline}]{.mark} of
conventional motherhood [[within]{.underline}]{.mark} its own
[[regulatory schema]{.underline}]{.mark}. The fact that Ann's
exploitation might register as the former and not the latter pivots on
her identity as a lesbian and the supposedly sympathetic notion that
Frank's allows her to exhibit her motherly tendencies, regardless.

**\[SHE CONTINUES\]**

As Edge of Twilight and Desert of the Heart demonstrate, early
neoliberal lesbian subjectivity depended upon forms of affective
regulation and social reproduction already in play in this period. In
their professional labor and desire, Val's and Ann's affective
capacities are de- and re-regulated, flourishing most when these women
come into close proximity with deregulation's disenfranchised others. In
The Feeling of Kinship, David L. [Eng describes "[queer
liberalism]{.mark}" as "[a product of late capitalist
rationalization]{.mark} \[that\] functions as a supplement to capital,
but in a desexualized, repackaged, and contained form]{.underline}." Eng
continues, "we might say that [neoliberalism enunciates]{.underline}
([homo)sexual difference in the register of culture -- a culture that is
freely exchanged (purchased) and celebrated (consumed]{.underline})"
(30). For Eng, homosexual difference and neoliberalism are complicit to
the extent that -- as recent consumable TV and fashion phenomena
demonstrate -- "queerness" has become an "aestheticized lifestyle
predicated on choice" and consumerism (29--30). As this chapter has
argued, however, sexual difference under neoliberalism extends beyond
these claims, which largely view its supplemental properties as
"contained" and primarily operational on the side of consumerism.
Christian's and Rule's representations of late-capitalist lesbian
identity go beyond the commodification of homosexual difference. In
their documentations of deregulated sexuality, [we see]{.underline}
lesbianism as [[a supplement to]{.mark} late-capitalist
[expansion]{.mark} [through]{.mark} the lens of [value production
and]{.mark} those [affective forms of labor]{.mark} at work [in a system
of exploitation with a vested interest in the versatile, non-contained
capacity freed up at the intersection of sexual and economic
deregulation.]{.mark}]{.underline}

My readings of Edge of Twilight and Desert of the Heart locate a point
where lesbian identity's supplemental operations entail more than
cultural capital in neoliberalism. Indeed, these novels suggest that
sexual deregulation's contemporary ideological force is an extension of
a historical development within and adjacent to the formalized
extraction of attentive labor required by the deregulated service
industry. Christian and Rule reveal is a historical juncture where [the
contradictory promises and pitfalls of]{.underline} professional
[[self-management]{.mark} and enterprise are enacted and [made legible
through]{.mark} their overlap with the [freeing up and re-regulating
of]{.mark} lesbian [identifications and desires]{.mark}]{.underline}. To
read Edge of Twilight and Desert of the Heart historically, then, is to
remain skeptical and ever vigilant of [modernity's promise]{.underline},
which [increasingly requires the implementation and erasure of flexible
laboring and desiring subjects to make good on its guarantee of
freedom]{.underline}. In what follows, I track contemporary culture's
absorption of this complex history.

come to represent, unequivocally, examples of insurgent possibility:

### Embodiment 

#### Exclusive focus on embodiment in relation to personal politics locks in *[juridical power]{.underline}*-- only joining embodiment with commitment to change at the [structural level]{.underline} can adequately remedy larger forms of injustice 

**Fixmer and Wood 5** (Natalie Fixmer, MA in Communications from UNC
Chapel Hill, \*Julia T. Wood, Linerberger Professor of Humanities and
Communications at UNC Chapel Hill, "The Personal is Still Political:
Embodied Politics in Third Wave Feminism," Vol 28, No 2, Fall 2005)

Conclusion Claiming that they were raised to believe they were entitled
to equality, the third wave feminists whose essays we analyzed are
angered to discover that structural changes have not been fully
integrated into daily interac- tions with family, clerks, friends,
romantic partners, neighbors, and co- workers. Their response is to
challenge sexism where they find it---on the job, in conversations with
friends and acquaintances, in their families, and on the streets. Their
goal is to notice and challenge \"the tiny, everyday\" (Foucault, 1984,
p. 211) practices of sexism and discrimination that persist despite
structural reforms. They claim to do this through embodied poli- tics,
which relies on communication to engage women\'s differences and
multiplicities in complex ways, build and work with coalitions, and
enact personal resistance. But [can embodied politics really instigate
substantial change in the ideologies that order everyday practices in
pervasive but often imperceptible ways? Can politics that do not demand
large, systemic changes achieve redress in ways that have been
accomplished by previous reformist movements?]{.underline} One answer
comes from third wave feminists themselves. Many contributors to the
anthologies explain that they came to feminism through conversations,
interactions, writings, and teachings of their fore- mothers---precisely
what Bowleg (1995) and, before her, hooks (1993) call \"door-to-door
feminism.\" The politics of third wave feminists, as articulated in the
texts we read, seem congruent with an era marked by postmodern awareness
of the contingency of social order(s) and the dispersed, fragmented
character of power. Yet Foucault\'s (1982) observation that, \"the
analysis of power relations within a society cannot be reduced to the
study of a series of institutions\" (p. 224) does not claim that an
adequate analysis of power can ignore institutions. [If b[oth structural
and personal forms of politics are **necessary**]{.mark} [and]{.mark},
in fact, **[complementary]{.mark}** in challenging and changing
relations of power, then third wavers\' [embodied politics]{.mark},
**however daring and bold,**]{.underline} [may ultimately [have
**limited impact**]{.mark}]{.underline}. Nonetheless, embodied politics
may be one important and integral, if not wholly sufficient, part of
overall change. Our reading of selected third wave texts invites
multiple, not entirely consistent conclusions. On the one hand, the
authors we read are histor- ically uninformed about much of second wave
feminism, particularly the radical branch that seems a direct ancestor
of many third wave goals and politics. This not only renders them
uninformed, but also jeopardizes the efficacy of their politics since
they have not studied what did and did not work in second wave feminism,
particularly radical feminism. At the same time, we appreciate third
wave feminists\' efforts to understand and deal with difference as more
complex and messy than previous generations recognized. In IEfusing to
confine women to discrete and mutually exclu- sive categories, they are
working to articulate something new and impor- tant about identity,
difference. and solidarity. This alone is a significant accomplishment,
especially for a movement so young. At this juncture, it seems wise to
balance sympathetic and critical assessments of the third wave. The
embodied politics they celebrate may be both rousing and naive, both
powerful and limited, both productive and reproductive. The same could
be said of second wave politics or, for that matter, any politics.
Perhaps [[the central insight into power is not that disciplinary power
is more important than juridical power]{.mark}, [but that neither
operates alone and neither on its own is capable of instigating and
sustaining changes]{.mark} in power relations as those are figured in
formal structures and practiced in everyday life]{.underline}. By
extension, this suggests that [it would be imprudent to dismiss embodied
politics for not focusing on structural change just as [it would be
unwise to dismiss structural politics for not emphasizing everyday
practices]{.mark}.]{.underline} In 1995, third waver Nomy Lamm wrote \"I
can go back to the old cliché about the personal being political, and no
matter how trite it may sound, it\'s true\" (p. 94). Five years later,
Baumgardner and Richards (2000) stated that third wavers\' \"politics
emerge from our everyday lives\" (p. 15) because \"the personal is still
political\" (p. 18). Despite reservations that we and others have
raised, the embodied politics advocated and practiced by some young
feminists may add additional layers of meaning to the intricate
intersections between the personal and the political. If we were invited
to meet with third wave feminists to discuss their movement and its
politics, we would begin by applauding the potential of the embodied
politics they advocate and enact. And then we would suggest to them that
**[[it is]{.underline}]{.mark}**, at best. unwise and. at worst.
**[dangerously [naive]{.mark} for a political movement that aims to
diminish oppression to ignore juridical power and, by extension, [to
limit its politics to only disciplinary, everyday acts of
resistance]{.mark}]{.underline}**.

### Fugitive Planning 

#### Fugitive "planning" cannot escape the inevitable violence of institutional positioning -- we should instead recognize our capacity for engagement and reconfiguration of existing structures 

**Love 15** -- R. Jean Brownlee Term Associate Professor at the
University of Pennsylvania (Heather, R. Jean Brownlee Term Associate
Professor at the University of Pennsylvania, "Doing Being Deviant:
Deviance Studies, Description, and the Queer Ordinary," differences Vol.
26.1, pp. 89-91)

Today, queer studies---prestigious but unevenly
institutionalized---still signals absolute refusal or criticality---all
anti- and no normativity. In their influential 2004 essay, "The
University and the Undercommons" (and in the 2013 book that followed
from it), Fred [[Moten and]{.underline}]{.mark} Stefano
[[Harney]{.underline}]{.mark} rely on such an understanding of queer (as
well as concepts borrowed from black studies, feminism, ethnic studies,
and anticolonial thought). They [[call for betrayal,
refusal]{.underline}]{.mark}, theft, and marronage [[as modes of
resisting the]{.mark} iron grip of the [academy]{.mark}]{.underline},
[[pointing to an]{.underline}]{.mark} uncharted, underground, and
collective space they call the [[undercommons]{.underline}]{.mark}. "To
enter this space," they write, "is to inhabit the ruptural and
enraptured disclosure of the commons that fugitive enlightenment enacts,
the criminal, matricidal, queer, in the cistern, on the stroll of the
stolen life, the life stolen by enlightenment and stolen back, where the
commons give refuge, where the refuge gives commons" (103). Moten and
Harney speculate whether the "thought of the outside" (105) is possible
inside the university and suggest that if there is an outside, it is
along the margins and at the bottom. **[[Yet their imagination of that
outside is indebted to the inside]{.underline}]{.mark}**, in particular
to the conception of deviance produced within sociology. [[Their account
of the undercommons reads like a rap sheet]{.mark}, a list [of the
traditional topics of deviance studies]{.mark}: theft, homosexuality,
prostitution, incarceration. Moten and Harney do not describe the
undercommons, but rather ask their readers to join it]{.underline}, to
participate in active revolt against profes- sional and disciplinary
protocols. [To offer an objective account of the social position of
radical academics would be to further business as usual in the
academy]{.underline}; dwelling in the undercommons requires giving up on
the usual protocols of description. Moten and Harney argue against the
traditional role of the "critical academic" (105), which they see as
just another turn of the professional screw, since work that opposes the
academy does not challenge its basic structure or everyday operations.
They argue that "to be a critical academic in the university is to be
against the university, and to be against the university is always to
recognize it and to be recognized by it, and to institute the negligence
of the internal outside, that unassimilated underground, a negligence of
it that is precisely, we must insist, the basis of the professions"
(105). In contrast to the figure of the critical academic, they forward
the image of the "subversive intellectual" who is "in but not of" the
academy (101). Without dismissing the galvanizing effect of such a call
to the undercommons, **[[it is important to consider the limits of the
refusal of objectification as a strategy]{.underline}]{.mark}**. [To be
unlocatable, to be nowhere, to be in permanent revolt]{.underline}:
[Moten and Harney describe the path that queer inquiry laid out for
itself]{.underline}.
[[Objectification]{.underline}]{.mark}---**[[recognition, description,
critique]{.underline}]{.mark}**---[**[can be]{.mark}** a way to
reinforce the status quo, but it is also **[a way of acknowledging one's
institutional position and the real differences between inside and
outside]{.mark}**]{.underline}. [[Even the most subversive intellectuals
in the academy are "on the stroll" in a metaphorical but **not a
material sense**]{.underline}]{.mark}. [The fate of those who came
"under false pretenses, with bad documents, out of love"]{.underline}
(101), [if they survive]{.underline}, [is to **become
"superordinates"**]{.underline} in Becker's sense. Whose side are we on?
Can we hold onto the critical and polemical energy of queer studies as
well as its radical experiments in style and thought while acknowledging
our implication in systems of power, management, and control? Will a
more explicit avowal of disciplinary affiliations and methods snuff out
the utopian energies of a field that sees itself as a radical outsider
in the university? To date, [[both the political and the methodological
antinormativity]{.underline}]{.mark} of queer studies [[have made it
difficult to address our implication in the violence of knowledge
production,]{.mark} pedagogy, and social inequality.]{.underline}
[**[Such violence is inevitable]{.mark}**, and critical histories of the
disciplines]{.underline}---and the production of knowledge about social
deviance---[are essential.]{.underline} **[[Undertaking such
work]{.underline}]{.mark}**, however, **[[will not allow escape into a
radically different relation to our objects because we
are]{.underline}]{.mark}** (as Moten and Harney also argue) part of that
history---we are **[[its contemporary
instantiation.]{.underline}]{.mark}** To imagine a social world in which
those relations are transformed---in what Moten and Harney refer to as
the "[[prophetic organization]{.underline}]{.mark}" (102)---[[may be
crucial for]{.underline}]{.mark} the achievement of [[social justice,
but **to deny our own implication in existing structures is**]{.mark}
**also [a form of violence]{.mark}.**]{.underline}

### Individualism 

#### Individualist understandings of racial identity formation are inexorably bound to the politics of the liberal elite. It removes the impetus for collective organization.

**Haider 18** (Asad, founding Editor of Viewpoint Magazine, an
investigative journal of contemporary politics, PhD candidate in the
History of Consciousness at UC Santa Cruz, and a member of UAW-2865, the
Student-Workers Union at the University of California, *Mistaken
Identity: Race and Class in the Trump Age*, Verso, 2018)

[Making sense of this bewildering history requires us to draw a line of
demarcation between the emancipatory mass movements of the past, which
struggled against racism]{.underline}, [and]{.underline} the
[[contemporary ideologies of identity]{.underline}]{.mark}, [which [are
attached to the politics of a **multiracial
elite**]{.mark}]{.underline}. The existence of this problem is widely
recognized, but discussing it constructively has turned out to be quite
difficult. [Criticisms of identity politics]{.underline} are often
voiced by white men who remain blissfully ignorant or apathetic about
the experiences of others. They [are]{.underline} also, [at times, used
on the left to dismiss any political demand that does not align with
what is considered to be a purely "economic" program]{.underline}---the
very problem that the Combahee River Collective had set out to address.

However, here [the term identity politics seems to **amplify the
difficulties**]{.underline}. Often [[contemporary radicals are reluctant
to criticize **even the most elitist expressions of racial
ideology**]{.underline}]{.mark}, [[because doing so seems to be
dismissing **any movement against racism and
sexism**]{.underline}]{.mark}. Others valiantly attempt to establish a
gradient of identity politics, as though there is a minimum effective
dose and problems arise only when it is taken to extremes. But this
logic of the gradient cannot possibly explain the emergence of
fundamentally opposed and antagonistic political positions: the
revolutionary grassroots politics of the CRC versus the ruling-class
politics of the Democratic Party elite.

[It is the haziness of our contemporary category of identity that has
blurred the boundaries]{.underline}. Its political pitfalls have been
forcefully demonstrated by Wendy Brown, who argues that "[what we have
come to call identity politics is partly dependent upon the demise of a
critique of capitalism and of bourgeois cultural and economic
values.]{.underline}" [When identity claims are put forth without a
grounding in a critique of capitalism]{.underline}, Brown suggests,

> [[identity politics concerned with race, sexuality, and gender will
> appear **not as a supplement to class politics**]{.underline}]{.mark},
> **[not as an expansion of left categories of oppression]{.underline}**
> and emancipation, [not as an enriching augmentation of progressive
> formulations of power and persons]{.underline}---all of which they
> also are---[[but as tethered to a formulation of justice that
> **reinscribes a bourgeois**]{.mark}]{.underline} (masculinist)
> **[[ideal]{.mark} as its measure]{.underline}**.26

In other words, [[by coding demands]{.mark} that come from marginal or
subordinate groups [as identity politics]{.mark}]{.underline}, [[the
white male identity is enshrined with the status of the **neutral**,
**general**, and **universal**]{.underline}]{.mark}. [We know that this
is false]{.underline}---in fact, [there is a white identity politics, a
white nationalism]{.underline}---and, as we shall see, [whiteness is the
prototypical form of racial ideology itself]{.underline}. [[Antiracist
struggles]{.underline}]{.mark} like those of the CRC [[reveal the
**false universality of this hegemonic identity**]{.underline}]{.mark}.

However, [when identity claims lose their grounding in mass
movements]{.underline}, [the bourgeois masculinist ideal rushes to fill
the void]{.underline}. This ideal, Brown writes, "signifies educational
and vocational opportunity, upward mobility, relative protection against
arbitrary violence, and reward in proportion to effort[." If it is not
questioned]{.underline}, [people of color, along with other oppressed
groups, have no choice but to articulate their political demands in
terms of inclusion in the bourgeois masculinist ideal.]{.underline}

[To demand inclusion in the structure of society as it is means
forfeiting the possibility of structural change]{.underline}. As Brown
points out, this means that [the enabling condition of politics is the
"renaturalization of capitalism that can be said to have marked
progressive discourse since the 1970s]{.underline}."27 It is the
equation of political agency with membership in a mythical "middle
class," which is supposed to characterize everyone in American society.
The middle class itself, Brown argues, is "a conservative identity," one
that refers to "a phantasmic past, an imagined idyllic, unfettered, and
uncorrupted historical moment (implicitly located around 1955) when life
was good." This was a historical moment ideologically centered on the
nuclear family, with the white male breadwinner at its head. Yet it
paradoxically comes to embody, Brown points out, "the ideal to which
nonclass identities refer for proof of their exclusion or injury."

Of course, the injury of exclusion from the benefits extended to the
white heterosexual middle class is a real injury. [[Job security,
freedom from harassment, access to housing]{.mark}---all of these [are
meaningful demands]{.mark}]{.underline}. [[But]{.underline}]{.mark} [the
problem is that "[**politicized identities**" **do not pose these
demands in the context of an insurgency from
below**]{.mark}]{.underline}. [[The]{.mark} very [structure of the
politicized identity is to make a **demand for restitution**]{.mark} and
inclusion]{.underline}; as Brown points out, "Without recourse to the
white masculine middle-class ideal, [politicized identities would
forfeit a good deal of their claims to injury and
exclusion]{.underline}, [their claims to the political significance of
their difference."]{.underline}28

I grew up in a world entirely shaped by this renaturalization of
capitalism. I sensed that there was something unsatisfactory about
politicized identity but could not quite find a way to deal with it,
beyond a sort of weak dialectical ambivalence. After all, I couldn't
possibly dismiss the fact that while "black faces in high places" might
not mean liberation, seeing them was still profoundly meaningful for
those who had suffered the psychological traumas of a racist society. In
my formative years, everyone I saw on TV who looked like me was a cab
driver or an Arab terrorist. (I still don't understand why they have
Indians play Arab terrorists. Why not at least a Pakistani terrorist?)
Every president had been white and, despite my lack of interest in
Obama, his electoral victory made me think of the black people who had
died fighting for just the right to vote; the thought moved me to tears.
Was the multicultural bourgeoisie with its ideology of identity a
necessary evil---a component of the cross-class alliance that would be
required to fight racism?

At times, I thought so. But as I continued to participate in social
movements, I was forced to change my mind. [By launching a critique of
identity politics]{.underline}, then, [I have no intention of deviating
from the legacy of the Combahee River Collective or the mass movements
against racism that have shaped our contemporary world]{.underline}. [It
is, rather, an attempt to deal with the **contradictory reality** that
we **cannot avoid confronting**]{.underline}.

In its contemporary ideological form, rather than its initial form as a
theorization of a revolutionary political practice, [[identity politics
is an **individualist method**]{.underline}]{.mark}. [It is [based on
the individual's demand for **recognition**]{.mark}]{.underline}, [and
it takes that individual's identity as its starting point.]{.underline}
It takes this identity for granted and suppresses the fact that **[[all
identities are socially constructed]{.underline}]{.mark}**. And [because
all of us necessarily have an identity that is different from everyone
else's]{.underline}, [[it **undermines the possibility of collective
self-organization**]{.underline}]{.mark}. [The framework of identity
reduces politics to who you are as an individual and to gaining
recognition as an individual,]{.underline} [rather than your membership
in a collectivity and the collective struggle against an oppressive
social structure]{.underline}. As a result,
[[identity]{.underline}]{.mark} [[politics]{.underline}]{.mark}
[paradoxically [ends up **reinforcing the**]{.mark} **very [norms it set
out to criticize]{.mark}**.]{.underline}

While this redefinition may seem drastic, this kind of shift in meaning
is typical of political language, which does not always clearly align
with political practice. A word like nationalism, for example, ends up
revealing irreconcilable divisions. It eventually requires modification,
and we may end up deciding that it has to be abandoned in favor of new
and more adequate terms. Indeed, nationalism was precisely the
epistemological obstacle that drove Barbara Smith to the kind of
politics that would frame the CRC. She recalled:

> I went to a major antiwar mobilization in Washington, D.C., in the
> fall of 1969 ... I thought it was the last demonstration I'd ever go
> to; one of the reasons being black people back at Pitt had so many
> nasty things to say about the fact that I was involved in what they
> say was a "white" entity, namely, the antiwar movement ... it was a
> very hard time to be a politically active black woman, who did not
> want to be a pawn ... I actually imagined that I would never be
> politically active again because nationalism and patriarchal attitudes
> within black organizing was so strong.29

[The CRC]{.underline}'s initiating [purpose]{.underline} [was precisely
to **overcome** these **degrading** and **depoliticizing
divisions**.]{.underline} "I firmly believe there has to be space for us
all in our myriad identities and dimensions," Demita Frazier would later
reflect. "You run the risk of having an identity become crystallized and
contained and requiring everyone to be conformists." This tension also
existed within the CRC. Class differences internal to the group were a
challenge in maintaining democratic forms of organization, Frazier
recalls:

> Class was another huge issue that we looked at and yet in some way
> could not come to grips with. We had an analysis based on our own
> socialist leanings and a socialist democratic view of the world, and
> yet, when it came right down to it, we had many women who felt
> excluded because they felt they didn't have the educational background
> and privilege of the leadership.

Just as significant was the question of relating to other groups,
especially other feminist groups. The women's liberation movement had
been perceived as white from the outset, and part of [the purpose of the
CRC was to insist that black women could articulate their own
feminism]{.underline}. But [this did not necessarily mean maintaining
rigid divisions from white feminists]{.underline}, [or]{.underline}
indeed **[forming a crystallized black identity.]{.underline}** In
Frazier's own words:

> One of the things that has always troubled me is that I wanted to be
> part of a multicultural feminist organization, a multicultural
> feminist movement, and I never felt that the feminist movement became
> fully integrated ... It isn't that Combahee didn't work in coalition
> with other groups, but we weren't able to make those linkages across
> culture and make them as firm as I hoped they could be.30

[The problem of coalitions is felt acutely by anyone who has experienced
the trials and tribulations of political practice]{.underline}. My own
experiences with the rise and fall of coalitions convinced me of the
perspective of the scholar of black British culture Paul Gilroy:
"[[Action against racial hierarchies can proceed more effectively when
it has been purged of]{.mark} any lingering respect for [the **idea of
'race**]{.mark}.']{.underline} "31

#### Moten and Harney's positioning of being always at war, always in hiding represents a reactive strategy that makes analysis of labor impossible

The Social Science Centre is part of a radical tradition of subversive
academic activity. One of the most compelling accounts of this activity
is contained in [[Harney and Moten's concept]{.underline}]{.mark} of
'the Undercommons' (Harney & Moten, 2013). The Undercommons [[is a
general antagonism]{.underline}]{.mark}, where [academics exist 'in and
against' the University]{.underline}. The Social Science Centre is when
this general antagonism is taken outside the University, as an
alternative site of collective resistance. The Undercommons and the SSC
are both built on the notion that academic work is a non-exceptional
form of capitalist work, where academics have become 'cyborgs of
knowledge production' (Moten & Harney, 1999). The Undercommons and the
SSC maintain that in order to challenge this automated arrangement it is
necessary to focus on the social relations of capitalist production on
which state strategy for higher education is based. [The Undercommons is
highly critical of the professionalization of academic life: the ways in
which surplus value is extracted by worker-against-worker surveillance
schemes, research targets, the increase in the numbers of students to be
taught, severe constraints on collegiality which is also undermined by
management structures, with academics lacking ownership of the means
through which their knowledge is produced]{.underline}. This is
exacerbated with pressure to find funding from state, military and other
donors whose interests may not coincide with those of academics, and who
may have no interest in alternative models for social development
(Harney & Moten, 1998: 165). [In this situation [Harney and Moten deny
the possibility for real critical intellectual activity in mainstream
higher education]{.mark}]{.underline}. [They argue that to be a critical
academic inside a capitalist university means 'recognising the
university and being recognized by it as an assertion of the
university's impeccable liberal credentials and the academic's bourgeois
individuality]{.underline} (Harney & Moten, 2013: 31). In this way
critical education gets to perfect higher education in its current form,
as 'professional education\... a counterinsurgency, coming for the
discredited, for those who refuse to write of or write up the
undercommons' (32). [Critical educators in this context are regarded as
\'harmless intellectuals, malleable, perhaps capable of some modest
intervention in the so-called public sphere']{.underline} (32). Harney
and Moten (2013: 30) discover the subversive intellectual in the
identity of radical students and faculty: Maroon communities of
composition teachers, mentorless graduate students, adjunct Marxist
historians, or queer management professors, state college ethnic studies
departments, closed down film programmes, visa-expired Yemeni student
newspaper editors, historically black college NEARY • EDUCATIVE POWER CM
16 • 2015 www.culturemachine.net • 18 sociologists and feminist
engineers. And what will the university say of them? It will say they
are unprofessional. How do those who exceed the profession, who exceed
and by exceeding escape, how do those maroons problematize themselves,
problematize the university, force the university to consider them a
problem, a danger? [[The Undercommons ... are always at war, always in
hiding]{.underline}]{.mark}. Faced with this predicament the only
rationale for radical faculty is to steal from the university (26) and
to teach, or, rather, not teach: the not visible other side of teaching,
a thinking through the skin of teaching toward a collective orientation
to the knowledge object as future project, and a commitment to what we
want to call the prophetic organisation. (27) [This means not finishing,
not passing, not graduating, but being driven by: a radical passion and
passivity that one becomes unfit for subjection\...]{.underline} It is
not so much the teaching as it is about the prophecy in the organisation
of teaching\... against its own deadening labour and the
professionalization of the critical academic. (28) This form of
teaching, they argue, is not only unethical, but becomes a security
breach (36). A key feature of the Undercommons view of the University is
an assertion about the non-exceptional nature of academic work, which
can only be done in collaboration with other academics, other university
workers, workers outside of the university and with students. This
highly collaborative model of academic work includes students as
co-workers and collaborators: 'student as producer' (Harney & Moten,
1998: 172), in fact, of knowledge as part of the teaching process.
Harney and Moten argue that any strategy where academics work alongside
students for radical social change based on a critique of capitalist
society must recognize students as coworkers as well as the material
conditions of capitalist production. NEARY • EDUCATIVE POWER CM 16 •
2015 www.culturemachine.net • 19 [Recognising the violence inherent in
state strategy they proclaim that the Undercommons is a declaration of
war against war, or the state's refusal of a new society]{.underline}.
[The Undercommons is a 'non-place']{.underline} (Harney & Moten, 2013:
39), or a 'prophetic organisation' (27) that works towards the abolition
of a society that relies on wages, prisons and slavery, and 'the
founding of a new society \[which\] would have the resemblance of
communism' (42). This is a powerful analysis, written with a highly
literary sensibility, sharing the SSC's commitment to the notion of the
student as co-worker in the production of communism. However, there are
significant differences between the Undercommons and the SSC[. **[The
Undercommons is an analysis of the capitalist labour process which
leaves out the dynamics of valorisation.]{.underline}** [Value is
discussed]{.underline}]{.mark} by Harney and Moten, but [[only as a
marketized medium of exchange]{.mark}, with no understanding being shown
of the violent law of abstraction by which value expands and social life
is brutalized.]{.underline} [[While Harney and Moten do use the term
'abstracting academic labour', they do so]{.mark} as a way of looking
more closely at work inside the academy, and with[out consideration
being given to it as the process of the abstraction of surplus
value]{.mark}]{.underline}[.]{.mark} [[The critique]{.mark}]{.underline}
of value on which the SSC relies [[recognizes the social world as the
totality of capitalist social relations, out of which social forms are
derived, whereas the Undercommons see society as already made: as a
place in which wages and slavery and prison exist]{.mark}]{.underline}
(Harney & Moten, 2013: 42). The critique of value on which the SSC is
based recognizes class struggle and ultimately communism as emerging
from the dynamic contradiction of the commodity-form: it is thus not
fixated on the identity politics of excluded faculty, whose oppositional
nature or otherwise is determined by the substance of their radical
Otherness, which for Harney and Moten has its defining moment in the
concept of Black Studies. [While [the Undercommons]{.mark} regard
stealing as a radical political act]{.underline}, the SSC does not
advocate theft, which [[does nothing to challenge property
relations]{.underline}]{.mark}; instead, the SSC endeavours to
appropriate the power of capitalist knowledge production in a
non-alienated form. The Undercommons' subversive model is also based on
a positive affirmation of worker solidarity, rather than a détournment
of the nature of work itself. In the end, then, [[the
Undercommons]{.mark} is passionate, rather than a negative critique, and
[is]{.mark} altogether [too certain, lacking any sense of critical
reflexivity or radical doubt or educative power, laying itself open to
its own critical analysis of the critical academic]{.mark}]{.underline}.
Stripped of any scopic vision by which it can reveal the foundation of
capitalist violence, the Undercommons provides no assurance on which to
launch a violent attack on police state power and its militarized
drones.

- K of ontology

[Oppression is not just an ideological tool to divide groups of workers,
but has real material consequences as well. Because of racism, for
example, the median household income for white families as of 2006 was
over \$50,000 a year. For Blacks, it was just under \$32,000. By every
measure of the quality of life in the U.S., whites are on the top and
Blacks are on the bottom.]{.underline}

[Marxists do not deny that these differences exist, nor do we deny that
oppression means the lives of some workers are actually worse than
others. **For Marxists, the question is the cause of the differences.**
Are the disparities the result of white workers benefiting directly from
the oppression of Black workers? That is, do white workers make more on
average because Black workers make less?]{.underline}

[To accept this explanation means to ignore the biggest beneficiary in
the disparity in wages\--employers and bosses. That employers are able
to use racism to justify paying Black workers less brings the wages of
all workers down\--the employers enjoy the difference.]{.underline}

[This is not to deny that white workers receive some advantages in U.S.
society because they are white in a racist society. If they did not get
some advantage\--and with it, the illusion that the system works for
them\--then racism would not be effective in dividing Black and white
workers.]{.underline}

[The distinctions and differences among workers function to create a
distorted view of reality that turns the traits attributed to the
oppressed into a kind of \"common sense,\" which in turn deepens those
divisions. African Americans are poorer, have worse housing, go to worse
schools, have a shorter life span and generally live in worse
conditions, which helps to perpetuate the image in the minds of white
workers that African Americans are inferior.]{.underline}

[But the problem with so-called \"common sense\" is that it is based on
surface appearances and information, and does not reach deeper to give a
systemic explanation for the disparities that exist in society. Instead,
it creates what Frederick Engels was the first to call \"false
consciousness.\"]{.underline}

[False consciousness is simply ruling-class ideology that is used to
explain away or cover up material reality. The point is that white
workers, to the extent that they accept white supremacy, contribute to
capitalism\'s ability to exploit them more effectively. The purely
\"psychological\" advantage obscures the very real material deficit that
racist oppression helps reinforce.]{.underline}

[Du Bois explained how \"false consciousness\" worked in the South and
why a labor movement never developed there in the aftermath of
slavery:]{.underline}

[The race element was emphasized in order that property holders could
get the support of the majority of white laborers and make it more
possible to exploit Negro labor. But the race philosophy came as a new
and terrible thing to make labor unity or labor class-consciousness
impossible. So long as the Southern white laborers could be induced to
prefer poverty to equality with the Negro, just so long was a labor
movement in the South made impossible.]{.underline}

[For Du Bois, racism wasn\'t metaphysical, nor did it exist autonomously
from class. Its development is a result of one class\' efforts to keep
power away from another. Du Bois did come up with a famous formulation
of poor whites gaining a \"psychological wage\"\--as opposed to a
material wage\--from racism. But the psychological wage was to make the
white worker feel superior because he wasn\'t Black, even though he
would have nothing material to show for it.]{.underline}

#### **The affirmative's claims that there is no discernable material is not only wrong but a neoliberal move to erase the nature of class contradictions and privileges. Abandoning Marxist tradition erases the legacy of black struggle against capitalism and perpetuates class violence and makes collective revolt impossible.**

Marxism in Ebony Materialist Philosophical Inquiry and Black Studies In
any academic discipline, there exist varying, oftentimes even
conflicting, conceptual frameworks, theoretical approaches, and methods.
Black Studies is no different. In light of the theoretical works
prominent today, however, a number of students in AAS might easily
conclude that philosophical idealism is the only school of thought. To
the contrary, [Black Leftist activists were significant players during
the early period of Black Studies.]{.underline} [The first introductory
textbooks in African American Studies were written by Marxist/socialist
scholars]{.underline} and activists; for instance, Peoples College\'s
Introduction to Afro-American Studies and Clarence Munford\'s Production
Relations, Class and Black Liberation: A Marxist Perspective in
Afro-American Studies. Communist like Jack O\'Dell and Robert Rhodes
taught African American Studies courses at the Antioch College branch
campus in Washington, D. C. And pioneering Black historian and
\"antibourgeois gadfly\" Earl Thorpe - chair of the history department
at North Carolina College - was recruited to teach courses on \"Marxism
and Black Liberation\" for the Black Studies program at Duke
University.23 However, [today, Leftist thought is marginal to the
politics and philosophy of Black Studies. **[Socialism and
Marxism-Leninism are integral parts of African American history and
culture]{.mark}.**]{.underline} Of course, [[Marxist]{.mark}
scholar/activists contributed [to African American intellectual history
and culture long before what is]{.mark}]{.underline}, in more formal
terms, [[considered]{.mark} the advent of [Black
Studies]{.mark}]{.underline} during the late 1960s. [In the tradition
of]{.underline} Hubert [[Harrison]{.mark},]{.underline} Susie Revels
[[Cayton]{.mark},]{.underline} Maude White Katz, Richard B. Moore, Paul
[[Robeson]{.mark},]{.underline} Oliver Cox, Eugene Holmes, Abram Harris,
Claudia Jones, Walter Rodney, Angela [[Davis, and]{.underline}]{.mark}
John [[McClendon]{.mark}, there is a need to bring the Black
working-class-men and women-back into AAS. A materialist philosophy
inquiry into Black Studies is grounded on three
presuppositions.]{.underline} **[[A materialist conception of
epistemology and ontology presumes that there is a reality independent
of]{.mark} our [consciousness]{.mark}.]{.underline}** **[[A materialist
ontology asserts the primacy of material reality]{.mark} over
consciousness.]{.underline}** **[[And]{.mark} a materialist
[epistemology posits that this reality is knowable and knowledge or what
is cognitive]{.mark}]{.underline}** (social consciousness)
**[corresponds to and]{.underline}** thus **[ideally approximates this
material reality.]{.underline}** Lastly, [a materialist philosophy
presupposes that [the social world is a stratified ontology of]{.mark}
which [class relations]{.mark}]{.underline} (i.e., social relations of
production) [form the ground for understanding social
processes.]{.underline} [The call for a materialist conception of
science and epistemology should not be seen as a call for an
essentialist ascription of AAS, wherein it is viewed only as a social
scientific enterprise devoid of cultural studies.]{.underline} **[The
current popularity of [cultural studies]{.mark}]{.underline}**, often in
collaboration with various species of historicism and postmodernist
trends, **[[fosters a separation between cultural studies and social
relations of production]{.mark}.]{.underline}** As a school of thought,
**[[it]{.mark} [gives less attention to the material conditions that
give rise to African American culture and relativizes the objective
character of the Black experience]{.mark}.]{.underline}** In my
estimation, **[[the Black working-class has become lost]{.mark} in the
whirlwind of cultural idealism.]{.underline}** [Contemporary Black
cultural theory -- [under the spell of poststructuralism]{.mark} and
Afrocentricity -- has declared: class is dead! **[All that exists is
intersectionality and a \"matrix of domination,\" in which everyone is
oppressed]{.mark}**]{.underline} -- women, men, capitalist, workers,
children, ad infinitum. [And there is a tendency in Black Studies to
transform the Black workingclass into some obscure gray matter known as
the consumer]{.underline}, the multitude, or -- my favorite from the
\"friends of the poor\" -- the Black underclass.24 [The relevance and
importance of **[the Black working-class must be brought to the
forefront]{.mark}** of Black Studies.]{.underline}25 **[This would
entail [discarding analytical notions such as]{.mark} \"cultural
deprivation,\" \"[human capital]{.mark},\" \"culture of poverty,\"
\"nihilism,\" \"feminization of poverty,\"
\"[intersectionality]{.mark},\" \"underclass,\" \"cultural pathology,\"
and \"menticide\" [that]{.mark}]{.underline}** have served to **[explain
the contemporary]{.underline}** and historical **[crisis that confronts
the Black working-class.]{.underline}** [We must discard the cultural
idealism of]{.underline} Maulana Karenga, Corne! West, Jawanza Kunjufu,
Marimba Ani, Patricia Hill Collins, Molefi Asante, and William Julius
Wilson who perceive [the \"Negro Question\'\' as an ideological or
axiological crisis]{.underline}, for example, as alienation from ancient
African values, the loss of a \"love ethic,\" or the lack of human
capital. [When we view]{.underline} the "Negro Question" [as
preeminently ideological, moral, or cultural, we ultimately [discount
the determinate role of]{.mark} material contradictions rooted in [class
contradictions]{.mark}.]{.underline} As Robert Allen astutely noted,
**[\" \... [the question is not politics or no politics; rather it is
which politics?]{.mark}]{.underline}** Whom will Black Studies serve?
**[Will it be truly democratic in its intellectual and political vision,
or will it become \'apolitical\' and acquiesce to a narrow, elitist and
bourgeois view of education?\"]{.underline}**26 Black Studies and the
Question of Western Civilization Revisited C. L. R. James wrote what
could be considered a Marxist manifesto for Black Studies in 1969.
Speaking at Federal City College, [James argues, at the level of theory,
that Black Studies should be anti-racist and anti-imperialist in
character, but not anti-white.]{.underline} From James\'s perspective,
there is no intellectual space in Black Studies for philosophies of
Blackness in which ancient African civilizations, values, and cultural
perspectives constitute a \"presuppositionless beginning\" for Black
Studies.27 [He parts company with Black nationalists and their
contemporary progeny]{.underline} (e.g., Afrocentrists) [who argue that
every culture rests on a metaphysical, permanent substratum that gives
rise to a particular system of thought.]{.underline} He cogently
proclaims: **[[We need a careful systematic building up of historical,
economic, political, literary ideas, knowledge and
information]{.underline}]{.mark}**, on the Negro question \... Because
**[[it is only where we have]{.underline}]{.mark}** Bolshevik ideas,
Marxist ideas, **[[Marxist knowledge]{.mark},]{.underline}** Marxist
**[[history]{.mark},]{.underline}** Marxist perspectives, **[[that you
are certain to drive out bourgeois ideas,]{.underline}]{.mark}**
bourgeois history, bourgeois perspectives **[which are so powerful on
the question of the races in the United States.]{.underline}**28
\[Italics Added\] For James, [the antithesis between bourgeois ideology
and proletarian ideology is essential to the development, direction, and
aim of Black Studies. James is often viewed as someone who was
head-over-heels in love with Western culture]{.underline} and/or
civilization. [Yet, it is important to note that dialectical and
historical materialism]{.underline} (or Marxism-Leninism) [constitutes
the conceptual and theoretical framework for his assessment of \"The
Fate of Humanity.\"]{.underline} In a 1939 article, \"Revolution and the
Negro\" James boldly avows, \"What we as Marxists have to see is the
tremendous role played by Negroes in the transformation of Western
civilization from feudalism to capitalism. It is only from this
vantage-point that we shall be able to appreciate (and prepare for) the
still greater role they must of necessity play in the transition from
capitalism to socialism.\"29 [James\'s classic works]{.underline} such
as *The Black \]acobins* and *A History of Pan-African Revolt* [[are
**ardently attentive to** the fact that **slavery, colonialism, and
imperialism** are part and parcel of capitalism]{.mark}.]{.underline}
Moreover, [the revolutionary resistance of people of African descent
ostensibly indicates the critical role of Black people as actors or
subjects of history and the dialectical development of Western
civilization.]{.underline} [In **unswerving disapproval of Hegel\'s
views**]{.underline} about Africans and their place outside of world
history, [James meticulously documents and effectively demonstrates
that-far from being removed from world historical event-African people
and their descendants in the diaspora transformed the landscape of world
history in a monumental fashion.]{.underline}3° **[Yet, James\'s
historiography is not some form of racial vindicationism]{.underline}**,
which claims that ancient African civilization is the real source of
Black historic magnitude and ultimately collective identity. Rather
[James offers insights into the Black struggles against slavery and
colonialism as manifestations of the antagonistic contradictions within
the modern]{.underline} (bourgeois) [stage of world
history.]{.underline} Cultural idealism has no place within James\'s
worldview and consequently his philosophy of history. **[James\'s
philosophy of history is not anti-European, anti-Western, or anti-white;
his philosophy of history is stridently anti-slavery, anti-imperialist,
anti-racist, and anticapitalist.]{.underline}**31 [James introduces **a
conceptual distinction between what is European and what is
Eurocentrism.**]{.underline} Moreover, [he did not accept the abstract
concept of the West as monolithic, devoid of internal class relations
and contradictory class interests.]{.underline} Black sociologist Alex
Dupuy points out that James\'s dialectical analysis takes into
consideration the tremendous value of European culture and its influence
on the African diaspora, and vice versa.32 Dupuy argues, [\"James was
redefining the meaning of Western culture away from its Eurocentric
understanding.]{.underline} For \[James\], West Indians were a modern
and Western people, though they were not European, a point \[James\]
made in many of his writings, e.g., his semiautobiography, Beyond a
Boundary (1963).\" 33 **[James resolutely rejected any outlook that
requires Black Studies to be grounded on a uniquely formulated Black
perspective]{.underline}** (e.g., Senghor\'s Negritude or Karenga\'s
Kawaida or Asante\'s Afrocentricity). Dupuy points out that [James does
not \"reject African culture in favor of Western culture.\"]{.underline}
34 Rather, [James\'s analysis is based on \"a historical materialist
understanding of culture\" and the recognition that \"the predominant
influences in the Caribbean were those of Western
Europe.\"]{.underline}35 As Dupuy insightfully notes, \"The Black
\]acobins remains \... one of the most succinct critiques of the
barbarism of Western European imperialism but also of the promise of
bourgeois civilization.\"36 [Any philosophy of AAS worth its salt should
follow in the \"Giant Steps\" of]{.underline} C. L. R.
[James.]{.underline} **[Embracing an ethnophilosophy that is
anti-European is as fruitful as masturbation. It may be pleasurable,
perhaps even therapeutic, but it won\'t give birth to a scientific
approach to Black Studies.]{.underline}** \"And that Black Fist becomes
a Red Spark\" Black Studies and Black Working-Class Studies37 [In a
post-Cold War world, the \"spectre of communism\" has apparently been
exorcised]{.underline} and laid to rest. [There is the widespread belief
that we have witnessed the death-knell of Marxism.]{.underline} So,
**[why argue for [the]{.mark} legitimacy of and [necessity for Marxism
in Black Studies]{.mark}?]{.underline}** No doubt this has been a hotly
debated question both in the Black Liberation movement and in Black
Studies for a considerable time. I tend to agree with Brian Lloyd: \"I
presume that **[we are witnessing, not the death of Marxism, but the end
of the first period during which Marxists managed to seize
and]{.underline}**, for a time, **[wield state power.]{.underline}**
That it has fewer adherents at the end than during other phases of this
period, and that as many of them can be found in universities as in
factories or fields, is neither disheartening as is imaged by some of
its proponents nor as amusing as is supposed by all of its
detractors.\"38 [It has become the custom to summarily dismiss Marxism
as a viable methodological approach and philosophical perspective for
Black Studies.]{.underline} [Most of the adversarial
postures]{.underline} toward Marxism-Leninism in Black Studies [have
discounted the value of a materialist dialectical philosophy of
liberation, class analysis, class struggle, proletarian
internationalism, and the scientific socialist principle of the
dictatorship of the proletariat.]{.underline} Despite the sharp
divergence of their political views, Harold [Cruse,]{.underline} Cedric
[Robinson,]{.underline} Cornel [West,]{.underline} Marimba Ani, Patricia
[Hill Collins, and]{.underline} Charles [Mills have condemned Marx and
Marxism for everything from economic determinism to class
reductionism]{.underline} to historical teleology and any number of
other \"conceits.\" [We]{.underline} even [find]{.underline} Asante
making such [puerile statements such as]{.underline} the following: \"In
fact, [we have no history of a communist movement in the United
States]{.underline} where communists put their bodies and l.ives on the
line as African Americans did.\"39 Contrary to Asante\'s claim, scholars
such as Mark Naison, Ted Vincent, Erik S. McDuffie, Gerald Horne, Carole
Boyce Davies, Robin Kelley, Minkah Makalani, and Mark Solomon in
addition to autobiographies by Harry Haywood, Hosea Hudson, and Michael
Hamlin offer a much more nuanced picture of communism, socialism, and
Marxism-Leninism in Black life and culture. **[Over the years,
scholarship in labor studies and Black Studies has [revealed the
historical legacy of Black worker militancy]{.mark}.]{.underline}** As
we travel through the annals of Black history, we unearth Peter Clark\'s
crucial involvement in **[[the Great Railway Strike]{.mark} of
1877,]{.underline}** Lucy Parsons\'s unflinching engagement in **[the
[Haymarket Square]{.mark} struggle,]{.underline}** the **[heroic efforts
of Ralph Gray, Tommy Gray, Eula Gray, Al Murphy, and scores of Black
[sharecroppers, tenant farmers, and agricultural laborers]{.mark} to
organize]{.underline}** the predominantly **[Black underground
organization]{.underline}** the Share Croppers Union, **[A. Philip
Randolph\'s tireless efforts with rhe Brotherhood of Sleeping Car
Porters,]{.underline}** Ferdinand Smith\'s vanguard role in **[the
National Maritime Union and]{.underline}** Paul Robeson\'s monumental
efforts to use **[folk music to entertain Spanish Civil War loyalists
and striking workers]{.underline}** as he gave support to international
socialist solidarity. **[We could mention]{.underline}** the steadfast
leadership of Velma **[Hopkins and]{.underline}** Moranda **[Smith in
the 1947 strike at the [Reynolds Tobacco]{.mark} Company in Winston
Salem,]{.underline}** North Carolina. There were Black postal workers
like Cleveland Morgan, a member of New York Branch 36 of the National
Association of Letter Carriers, who played a seminal role in the
nationwide 1970 postal wildcat strike. [We could also mention the
historic efforts of the League of Revolutionary Black Workers to
organize [wildcat strikes in Detroit]{.mark}]{.underline}, Michigan.
[[And]{.mark}, in more recent times, we could mention [working-class
Black women who]{.mark} have [fought]{.mark} against [the attack on
public services]{.mark}]{.underline}, such as public housing and
welfare. [We should not ignore the fact that many of these activists
were socialists, and quite a few were Marxist-Leninist in their
ideological outlook.]{.underline} The scholarship of Clarence Lang, John
Arena, Adolph Reed, Barbara Ransby, Rhonda Y. Williams, and Joe Trotter
has demonstrated the historic importance of the Black working-class to
African American history and culture. They bring to light the centrality
of class struggle and conflict as determinate features of what makes up
the Black working-class. **[[World capitalism gave birth to the Black
working-class.]{.underline}]{.mark}** [The initial accumulation of large
sums of capital, which]{.underline} in turn, [was [invested in]{.mark}
the exploitation of European workers, derived from [the slave trade
and]{.mark} the plantation system]{.underline} in the so-called New
World. In volume one of Capital, [Marx]{.underline} so [famously wrote
\"capital comes dripping]{.underline} from head to foot, from every
pore, [with blood and dirt.\"]{.underline}40 [The ruthless exploitation
of Black bodies]{.underline}, in a manner of speaking, [became the
proverbial goose that lays golden eggs]{.underline}, possessing the
magical ability to increase the magnitude of capital. Incidentally, [the
profitability of the \"proverbial goose\" prompted]{.underline}
slaveholder Thomas [Jefferson to remark, \"it would never do to destroy
the goose.\"]{.underline}41 [Leaving the decks of the slave
ship]{.underline}, \"In the Name of Jesus,\" [large numbers]{.underline}
of Wolof, Mande, Fulani, and Mandingo [were bound together by
chains]{.underline}, from neck to neck and wrist to wrist.42 [Out of the
diversity of African ethnic groups a new synthesis was formed under the
brutal system of capitalist slavery, giving birth to African
Americans.]{.underline} [The incessant \"[demand for Black
labor]{.mark}\" by Northern industrial capital and the plantation
bourgeoisie fueled world capitalist development.]{.underline} Black
slaves toiled in textile mills, shipyards, sawmills, and coalmines from
Virginia to Mississippi. [Black women labored on tobacco
fields]{.underline} in the Carolina piedmont and picked cotton on
plantations along the coast of Georgia. Black men like Tom Molineaux and
Black women like Sylvia DuBois were given release time from slave labor
in order to engage in athletic labor (as boxers) to bring entertainment
and profits to slaveholders and the larger white Southern community. 43
From the seventeenth century to the twenty-first century, from slave
plantations to auto factories, Black women, men, and children labored
under the hard times of capitalist exploitation. [**[The brutal forces
unleashed by the capitalist drive for surplus value laid the foundation
for the development of African American life and culture, from religion
to music.]{.underline}**44 **[Presently, we are
witnessing]{.underline}**]{.mark}, from New York to North Carolina to
Missouri to Wisconsin to California, **[[concerted attacks on public
sector workers]{.mark} in order to resolve the economic crisis ravaging
US capitalism.]{.underline}** We cannot ignore the fact that [Black
people are prominent in the leadership as well as in the rank and file
in a great number of these mass demonstrations.]{.underline} In cities
throughout the country, [working-class men and women, Black, white, and
Latino, are being blown away by police officers who are ultimately
protected by the rule of law.]{.underline} [In the aftermath of the
murders of Trayvon]{.underline} Martin, [Michael Brown,]{.underline}
Aiyanna Jones, Yvette Smith, [Rekia Boyd, and Eric Garner, Black working
people are not silently standing by while the \"Lords of Capital\" via
their \"special bodies of armed men\'\' -- with military weapons and
tanks -- confront them in the streets.]{.underline} **[This seminal
point is lost on Black critics of Marxism during the past 90
years.]{.underline}** As numerous studies in AAS have demonstrated,
**[the working-class is not one-dimensional, exclusively composed of
white people.]{.underline}** The working-class is composed of women,
men, and children, in addition to being multinational in character.
**[[Marxist studies of Black working-class life and culture are needed
now more than ever because in the souls of the Black working-class the
grapes of wrarh]{.mark} are filling and growing heavy.]{.underline}** As
Karl Marx so famously put it, [**\"[The weapon of criticism
cannot]{.mark}**, of course, **[replace criticism of the weapon,
material force must be overthrown by material force]{.mark}; but
theory**]{.underline} also **[becomes a material force as soon as it has
gripped the masses.\"]{.underline}**45 Philosophy of African American
Studies, I hope, wilt serve a prolegomena to the Herculean task of
developing a philosophy of AAS from the standpoint of materialism. How
well I have backed up this reaffirmation of philosophical materialism
and revolutionary socialism with good arguments I leave it to my readers
to judge. But the attempt to do so provides an answer-satisfactory to me
at least-to justify writing this book.

#### Claims of metaphysical ontology are inherently depoliticizing, locking in politics rather than opening up the possibility of a pragmatics of becoming acting directly upon the contingencies of power relations that make up the status quo. 

**Buck-Morss 13.** Susan Buck-Morss, Distinguished Professor of
Political Science at the CUNY Graduate Center, NYC, "A Commonist Ethics,
" in The Idea of Communism, 2013,
http://susanbuckmorss.info/text/commonist-ethics/

[The First Point: **[Politics is not an
ontology]{.mark}**]{.underline}[. [The claim that **the political** is
**always ontological** needs to be
**challenged**]{.underline}]{.mark}.[1](http://susanbuckmorss.info/text/commonist-ethics/#fn:1)
[It is **not merely** that the **negative** the case --- that [the
political is **never
ontological[2](http://susanbuckmorss.info/text/commonist-ethics/#fn:2)**]{.mark}]{.underline}
(as Badiou points out, a simple negation leaves everything in
place[3](http://susanbuckmorss.info/text/commonist-ethics/#fn:3)).
[Instead, what is called for is a reversal of the negation: [The
**ontological is never political**]{.mark}**.**]{.underline} It follows
that [the **move** from la politique (**everyday politics**) to le
politique (**the very meaning of the political**) is a **one-way
street**]{.underline}. With all due respect to Marcel Gauchet, Chantal
Mouffe, Giorgio Agamben, and a whole slew of others, [[the **attempt to
discover**]{.mark} within **empirical political life** (la politique)
[the **ontological essence** of **the political**]{.mark} (le politique)
[**leads theory into a dead end** from which there is **no return** to
**actual, political practice**]{.mark}]{.underline}[.]{.mark} There is
nothing gained by this move from the feminine to the masculine form.
[The **post-metaphysical project** of **discovering ontological truth**
within **lived existence fails politically**]{.underline}. It fails in
the socially disengaged Husserlian-Heidegerian mode of bracketing the
existenziell to discover the essential nature of what "the political"
is. [And it fails in the **socially critical**, post-Foucauldian mode of
**historicized ontology**, **disclosing** the **multiple ways** of
**political being-in-the-world** within **particular**, **cultural** and
**temporal configurations**.]{.underline} This is not news. From the
mid-1930s on, [it was Adorno's obsessive concern]{.underline}, in the
context of the rise of fascism, [to demonstrate the]{.underline} failure
of the ontological attempt [to **ground a philosophy** of Being by
**starting from the given world**, or]{.underline}, in Heideggerian
language, [to move from the ontic, that is, being]{.underline}
\[seiend\] [in the sense of that which is empirically given, to the
ontological, that which is essentially true of existence (Dasein as the
"a priori structure" of
"existentially]{.underline}"[4](http://susanbuckmorss.info/text/commonist-ethics/#fn:4)).
[Adorno argued that **[any ontology derived]{.mark}** (or reduced5)
[from the ontic, **turns the philosophical project** into **one big
tautology**]{.mark}]{.underline}.[6](http://susanbuckmorss.info/text/commonist-ethics/#fn:6)
He has a point, and [the political implications are
**serious**]{.underline}. **[Ontology identifies]{.underline}**.
Identity was anathema to Adorno, and nowhere more so than in its
political implications, the identity between ruler and ruled that
fascism affirmed. Indeed, [even **parliamentary rule** can be seen to
**presuppose** a **striving for identity**, whereby **consensus**
becomes **an end in itself**, regardless of the **truth content** of
that
consensus]{.underline}.[7](http://susanbuckmorss.info/text/commonist-ethics/#fn:7)
It is not that Heidegger's philosophy (or any existential ontology) is
in-itself fascist (that would be an ontological claim). Rather[, [by
**resolving the question** of **Being** before **subsequent political
analyses**, the latter have **no philosophical
traction**]{.underline}.]{.mark} [They are **subsumed** under **the
ontological a prioris** that **themselves** must **remain indifferent**
to their
**content**]{.underline}.[8](http://susanbuckmorss.info/text/commonist-ethics/#fn:8)
[**Existential ontology** is **mistaken** in assuming that, once "the
**character of being**]{.underline}" (Heidegger) [is **conceptually
grasped**, it will **return us** to the **material**, **empirical
world** and allow us to **gather its diversities** and
**multiplicities** under philosophy's own pre-understandings in ways
adequate to the exigencies of collective action, the **demands of actual
political life**]{.underline}. In fact, [**the ontological is never
political**. A **commonist**]{.underline} (or communist) [**ontology**
is a **contradiction in terms**]{.underline}. But, you may ask, did not
Marx himself outline in his early writings a full ontology based on the
classical, Aristotelian claim that man is by nature a social animal?
[Are not the 1844 manuscripts an elaboration of that claim, mediated by
a historically specific critique, hence an extended, socialontology of
man's alienation from nature (including his own) and from his fellow
man? Yes, but in actual, political life, this **[ontological "man" does
not exist]{.mark}.** Instead, [**we existing creatures** are **men** and
**women**, **black** and **brown**, **capitalists** and **workers**,
**gay** and **straight**, and the **meaning** of **these categories** of
**being** is in **no way stable**]{.mark}]{.underline}. Moreover,
[[these differences **matter less** that whether we are **unemployed**,
have **prison records**, or are **in danger of being
exported**]{.underline}.]{.mark} And [**no matter what** we are in these
**ontic ways**, [our **beings** do not **fit neatly** into our
**politics**]{.mark} **as conservatives**, **anarchists**,
**evangelicals**, **Teaparty-supporters**, **Zionists**, **Islamists**,
and (a few) **Communists**]{.underline}. [We are **social animals**,
yes, but we are **also anti-social**, and 0 are **thoroughly mediated**
by society's **contingent forms**]{.underline}. [Yes, the early Marx
developed a philosophical ontology. Nothing follows from this
politically. Philosopher-king-styled party leaders are not thereby
legitimated, and the whole thorny issue of false consciousness
(empirical vs. imputed/ascribed]{.underline} \[zugerechnectes\]
consciousness) [cannot force a political resolution]{.underline}. At the
same time, [**philosophical thought** has **every right** -- and
**obligation** --- to **intervene actively** into **political
life**]{.underline}. Here is Marx on the subject of intellectual
practice, including philosophizing: But again when I am active
scientifically, etc, --- when I am engaged in activity which I can
seldom perform in direct community with others --- then I am social,
because I am active as a man \[human
being[9](http://susanbuckmorss.info/text/commonist-ethics/#fn:9)\]. Not
only is the material of my activity given to me as a social product (as
is even the language in which the thinker is active): my own existence
is social activity, and therefore that which I make of myself, I make of
myself for society and with the consciousness ofmyself as a social
being. [10](http://susanbuckmorss.info/text/commonist-ethics/#fn:10)
Again, [[**no matter how deeply** one **thinks one's way** into this
**ontological generalization**, no **specific political orientation**
follows as a **consequence**]{.mark}. It **describes the intellectual
work** of Heidegger and Schmitt every bit as much as it does that of
Marx or of us ourselves.]{.underline}

### Race 

#### Perpetuating the ideology of race results in a purist politics which clings to conceptions of racial difference at the expense of material change. The individualization of oppression is tactic of liberalism to *reinforce* racial divisions.

**Haider 18** (Asad, founding Editor of Viewpoint Magazine, an
investigative journal of contemporary politics, PhD candidate in the
History of Consciousness at UC Santa Cruz, and a member of UAW-2865, the
Student-Workers Union at the University of California, *Mistaken
Identity: Race and Class in the Trump Age*, Verso, 2018)

Of course, this is why [reactions to the critique of identity politics
can be so abrasive]{.underline}. [[When there is no other
practical]{.mark} organizational [effort to combat
racism]{.mark}]{.underline}[,]{.mark} [[any questioning of the framework
of identity seems like an attempt to deny the validity of the antiracist
struggle]{.underline}]{.mark}. In fact, it goes even deeper than
this---[[questioning racial ideology itself seems to be a denial
of]{.mark} the [agency]{.mark} of the oppressed]{.underline}. In his
landmark book Against Race, Paul Gilroy describes how [[this defensive
reaction emerges from the **ambivalent relationship oppressed people
form with their identities**]{.underline}]{.mark}:

> [People who have been subordinated by race-thinking and its
> distinctive social structures]{.underline} (not all of which come
> tidily color-coded) [have for centuries employed the concepts and
> categories of their rulers]{.underline}, owners, and persecutors [to
> resist the destiny that "race]{.underline}" [has allocated to them and
> to dissent from the lowly value it placed upon their
> lives.]{.underline} Under the most difficult of conditions and from
> imperfect materials that they surely would not have selected if they
> had been able to choose, these oppressed groups have built complex
> traditions of politics, ethics, identity, and culture.

[By [classifying]{.mark} these [traditions within the categories of
"race]{.mark}]{.underline}," [[their role in the formation of our global
modernity has been marginalized]{.underline}]{.mark}, [relegated "to the
backwaters of the primitive and prepolitical]{.underline}." [Claiming
and [defending these traditions **reinforces racial
ideology**]{.mark}]{.underline} [[but also provides a form of defense
and protection]{.mark}. The [experiences of]{.mark} "insult,
[brutality]{.mark}, and contempt]{.underline}"
[[are]{.underline}]{.mark} "unexpectedly [[turned into important sources
of solidarity]{.mark}, joy, and collective strength]{.underline}."
[[This]{.mark} [reversal]{.mark},]{.underline} as Gilroy goes on to
explain, [[is a **powerful factor in the tenacity of racial
ideology**]{.mark}:]{.underline} "[When ideas of racial particularity
are inverted in this defensive manner so that they provide sources of
pride rather than shame and humiliation]{.underline}, [they become
difficult to relinquish]{.underline}. For many racialized populations,
'[race']{.underline} [and]{.underline} the hard-won, [oppositional
identities it supports]{.underline} [are not to be lightly]{.underline}
or prematurely [given up]{.underline}."23 But [[this
dynamic]{.underline}]{.mark} is not only a matter of the conscious
self-defense of the oppressed. It [is rooted in the
unconscious]{.underline}, as ideology always is, [and it takes us back
to the paradoxical relation between subjectivation and subjection that
Judith Butler has shown is so central to ideology and the modern forms
of politics]{.underline}. A fundamental aspect of [[this paradox of the
subject]{.underline}]{.mark}, Butler argues, [[is that it is tied up
with a "passionate attachment" to power]{.mark}.]{.underline} This is
the kind of attachment that children display toward their parents, who
are an arbitrary repressive authority but also the models of selfhood
and the first sources of recognition, and therefore the objects of love.

[[We are constituted as subjects within the individualization that is
**characteristic of state power**;]{.underline}]{.mark} [we are
[activated as political agents through the injuries]{.mark} that are
[constitutive of our identity]{.mark}]{.underline}. Consequently, [our
[identities]{.mark} [attach us to this power]{.mark} in a basic and
foundational way]{.underline}. This complicated and unconscious aspect
of our political experience is what Butler tries to capture:

> [[Called by an injurious name]{.underline}, [I come into **social
> being**]{.underline}]{.mark}, and because [I have a certain inevitable
> attachment to my existence]{.underline}, [because [a certain
> narcissism takes hold of any term that confers existence, I am led to
> embrace the terms that injure me because they constitute me
> socially]{.mark}]{.underline}. [[The self-colonizing trajectory of
> certain forms of identity politics are symptomatic of this paradoxical
> embrace of the injurious term]{.underline}]{.mark}.24

[As we try to understand the specific form of passionate attachment to
racial identity]{.underline}, [we have to pass into the nebulous terrain
of the unconscious]{.underline}---the terrain of
**[poetry]{.underline}**, **[fantasy]{.underline}**, [and
**illusion**]{.underline}.

### Self Care 

#### The affirmative's self-care is fundamentally impossible in within capitalism. Not only does their politics actually [sustain]{.underline} capitalism, but it makes it so that self-care becomes exhausting as it produces guilt and shame. Only communism can provide the communitarian foundations for true healing to occur. This turns the battle fatigue and suicide arguments they're reading on case. 

**Saldaña 16** (Brenda, "Is Self Care Revolutionary?"
<https://medium.com/inequality/is-self-care-revolutionary-cfbce5dee9e8>)
NIJ

The topic of self care has been on my mind a lot lately. As someone who
suffers from mental illnesses, dissociation, constant foot pain, and is
a poor student --- it's important to check in with yourself and see what
your body needs, what your mind needs, and consequently find ways to
satisfy those needs. [[Self care]{.mark}, I would broadly define, [is
any action you]{.mark} deliberately [take to take care of yourself and
your body]{.mark} --- maybe it's buying yourself your favorite
food]{.underline} after bombing an exam, maybe it's [putting on a face
mask]{.underline} after getting through an episode, maybe it's having a
really bad week and [having a "Netflix and Chill" date with
yourself.]{.underline} Today, we often think of self care as those
things --- actively making sure you give yourself something after
denying yourself/having something denied from you (e.g. happiness).
[[The common discourse]{.mark}, however, [is that self care is "radical"
and "revolutionary"]{.mark} --- that, by nurturing your body in a world
that has mechanisms set in place to imprison, kill, and knock you down
at every turn, you somehow fight against that system...[but is
that]{.mark} truly [revolutionary? Is it revolutionary to]{.mark}
[navigate through our trauma]{.mark} and illness [by holding our
survival on a pedestal?]{.mark} And [to what extent is it radical to
leave the]{.mark} emotional and physical [labor of healing]{.mark} and
building [on the back of someone who's faced trauma]{.mark} and violence
[instead of encouraging community-based care]{.mark} and
support?]{.underline} I don't mean to yuck anyone's yum. If you are able
to and can afford to engage in "self care", that's great for you and I
don't want to shame the ways in which you survive the world. But I don't
want you to think that this is it. That providing yourself the bare
minimum, a good meal or time away, is what you should indefinitely look
forward to or aspire to. Let me provide the example of corporations. As
Medium user \@marisoli26 stated: ["Corporations... make decisions based
solely on which option will end in more profit, often neglecting the
well-being of others."]{.underline} So **[[what
happens]{.underline}]{.mark}**, then, **[[when corporations make money
off the well-being of others?]{.underline}]{.mark}** What happens when
commercials and ads urge you to buy this or that, all because "you
deserve it", you've worked hard enough to treat yourself? **[[Is it
revolutionary]{.mark} [that the way]{.mark}s in which [we take care of
ourselves is by doing the bare minimum to get]{.mark} us
[through]{.mark} the day, through the work week, through the pay
period?]{.underline}** I don't want mere survival for us, for me or for
you. I don't want your **[[methods of getting through]{.mark} the
day]{.underline}** to **[[fall trap to
consumerism]{.underline}]{.mark}** that hides behind a narrative of
health (mental, emotional, physical). I don't want your well-being to be
profited off of and I don't want to leave out the people that sometimes
can't afford or aren't able to take care of themselves. [We need to
acknowledge that everyday [self care]{.mark} rhetoric [is exclusionary
of]{.mark}]{.underline} poor and mentally ill people, especially [[poor
queer and trans people of color.]{.underline}]{.mark} Am I really going
to spend \$30 on an organic and vegan avocado walnut acai wheatgrass
face mask when that could get me take out for a week? Am I going to take
a day for myself when I'm a full-time student with a job? Am I going to
spend money and energy I don't have on things that ultimately won't
bring me the happiness and restoration I seek? These are difficult
questions, ones I don't necessarily have answers to, ones that are
draining and ask of us to choose between two halves of a whole.
[[Growing up poor and brown, you think of anything]{.mark} in
["excess"]{.mark}]{.underline} (of what you're accustomed to) [[is
lavish and a rare indulgence]{.underline}]{.mark} only given to you when
you exceed demand --- i.e. you get straight A's, you work a 40+ hour
week, etc. You read Marx and learn that, indeed, [[capitalism aims to
make "everything that goes beyond the most abstract need... a
luxury".]{.underline}]{.mark} And entering adulthood, **[you begin to
see]{.underline}** that **[[(corporations and businesses) encouraging
people to engage in self care can]{.mark} often [be a manifestation of
capitalism; if the worker brings personal issues]{.mark}]{.underline}**
(that hadn't been resolved beforehand) **[[into the workplace, the
issues]{.mark} then [threaten productivity]{.mark}, consequently
becoming a problem for capitalism]{.underline}** --- which depends on
the constant labor of the worker. **[If the machine isn't well-oiled and
kept up to date, it can't perform its duties.]{.underline}**

### Spiritual Hope 

#### Their individualistic retreat into spiritual hope channels leftist momentum away from new understandings of social hope that frustrate systems of power through specific policy demands -- cruel optimism is empirically disproven 

**Aronson 17** -- Professor Emeritus at Wayne State University (Ronald,
"The Relevance of Hope Under Trump," The
Nation, [https://www.thenation.com/article/the-relevance-of-hope-under-trump/)//cmr](https://www.thenation.com/article/the-relevance-of-hope-under-trump/)/cmr)

Hope is in trouble today, and not only because Trump is in the White
House. In fact, this has been true for some time now. "Not even close"
is what Shepard Fairey, the designer of the 2008 "Hope" portrait,
answered when asked whether Barack Obama had lived up to the
expectations stirred by that iconic poster. Although Michelle Obama
recently insisted that "Barack didn't just talk about hope" as "a nice
slogan to get votes," by now many of those swept up in the 2008 campaign
might be excused for thinking exactly this. In retrospect, **Obama's
hope was hard to pin down, abstract, and gauzy**. And at its most
specific---searching for common ground between the opposing parties---it
could be positively naive. Or at other times "hope" talk might indeed be
labeled as deceptive, particularly when we recall who Obama put in
charge of the economy, or other "realistic" aspects of his domestic and
foreign policy. The artist Fairey, for one, was particularly
disillusioned by Obama's reliance on drones and domestic spying. But in
the age of Trump, it is important to resist the temptation to roll our
eyes at the mention of "hope." [In avoiding any further talk of hope we
risk depriving ourselves of one of the linchpins of the left. Even if it
is frail, hope animates much of what we think and do.]{.underline}
Despite frequent defeat and disillusionment, hope matters to us because
the left is its natural home. After a debacle like 2016 we
understandably call for getting right back to work, but doing so today
without thinking about what has been happening to our hope is a bit like
rounding up the usual suspects. After Obama, after the Sanders campaign,
in this time of Trump, we need to become clear on what hope is, how it
takes place, and how it is especially connected to the left. In
answering these questions [we must untangle ourselves from the
generation-long inflation of individual hope and the accompanying
shrinking of social hope.]{.underline} This trend is bringing our world
to the point where we all live in what sociologist Zygmunt Bauman calls
the "individualized society"---where **more and more** [people forget
that they are social beings living interdependent
lives]{.underline}**.** Just as Marxist philosopher Ernst Bloch followed
the Stalinist tendency of his time by falsely claiming that all personal
hopes were ultimately social, today the opposite has been happening in
our era of what I call [the privatization of hope. The individualizing
trend, with its seismic change of emphasis from the larger society to
our own personal universes, was announced in Margaret Thatcher's
assertion that "There is no such thing as society, only individuals, and
families." Her declaration signaled the neoliberal counterrevolution,
in]{.underline} both the United Kingdom and the United States, which has
been ideologically and practically constructing what sociologist Ulrich
Beck described as the "risk society." Here, individuals are increasingly
charged with finding "biographical solutions for systemic
contradictions." The growth of charter schools as an alternative to
public schools is one striking example of this privatization of hope.
Another is the shifting purpose of education from the development of
intellect and the capacity for citizenship, as Wendy Brown describes it,
to an ever-narrowing obsession with "maximizing competitiveness" and
"capital appreciation and investment." [In contrast to this trend,
social hope entails searching collectively for public solutions to our
public problems rather than pretending that everything is up to the
solitary individual.]{.underline} Obama evoked social hope in 2008, with
his movement-style reference to the United Farmworkers' "Si Se Puede!"
and by invoking the collective struggles of women, workers, and African
Americans. Despite its vagueness, his "Yes We Can" implied at least two
decisive social goals: that a relative outsider like Obama, supported by
a movement of activists, had a real shot at winning the presidency; and
that an African American could overcome the national history of slavery
and racism and be elected to lead this country. [In The Audacity of Hope
Obama also insisted that hope entails acting, not waiting passively.
From the left we might add that hope is not a faith in grand narratives
about the world becoming better on its own or a misty-eyed feeling of
optimism.]{.underline} **It is not merely an attitude**, or a mood, or a
feeling---all of which emphasize its subjective side. **It is rather a
tough-minded and inspired disposition to act. To hope is uniquely to**
combine the subjective and the objective, **collectively seeking to make
change happen**. [Hope creates action, but it is equally true that
action creates hope. It is the action of movements, rooted in people's
needs and longings, attempting to change the world in small ways and
large. And indeed, people's hopes have been at the heart of modern
history,from rejecting the harshest and most brutal forms of oppression
such as being others' property to demanding democratic government, from
rejecting inherited relationships of dominance and subservience to
demanding equality, self-determination, and evena more secure existence.
People have been picking up the baton set down by earlier generations
and other movements,hoping to take it further.]{.underline} Colonial
rule has largely met a fate similar to that of slavery, as is at this
moment happening to patriarchy and homophobia---having been made, or
still being made, unacceptable, immoral, illegal, obsolete. [In hoping
and acting on their hopes, movements have usually pointed to a specific
future that they seek to make happen such as union recognition, nuclear
disarmament, the end of apartheid, equal rights for African Americans,
equality for women, ending the use of fossil fuels. These demands, and
the broader goals of making society fairer, more humane, more equal,
more democratic, have challenged dominant systems of power and those who
benefit from them.]{.underline} I have said that hope is essential to
the left, but the historical record also shows that the left is
essential to hope. Sensing the possibility of things being different, we
sense also our own power in rising up to make it so. Rising up: **hope
is not only about aiming at certain objective results,** **but also
about the experience of coming together to make this happen**. As a
community of struggle is created, **solidarity replaces individual
self-seeking as our functional norm**, and we draw upon and contribute
to this current. Among countless other movements[, hope was generated by
the action of the Paterson silk workers in 1913, the Flint auto workers
in 1937, and the Montgomery bus boycotters]{.underline} **in 1955**.
Sidney Fine describes how the Flint strikers organized "little
governments" in their plants, with committees "for every conceivable
purpose": "food, recreation, information, education, postal services,
sanitation, and contact with the outside." They created rules and a
judicial system (with punishments for infractions) and organized musical
entertainment. Outside the plants, "a **network of committees was
created** in Flint to **support the strike in all of its aspects**:
defense (protection), sound cars, picketing, transportation, welfare,
kitchen (food), publicity, organization, entertainment, information,
education, distribution, car repairs and gas, finances, hall sanitation,
speakers bureau, women's auxiliary, and war veterans." Although the
strikers were away from their homes and under constant strain, they,
"almost for the first time, became acquainted with one another and began
to develop a sense of fellowship and coherence." Something like **this
happened in the self-organization of the Montgomery bus boycott**,
starting in the early morning of December 5, 1955,**when the buses
rolled from black neighborhoods to the rest of the city completely
empty**. The community would gather together in the evening, in church,
to listen to Martin Luther King Jr., but was just as powerfully present
in the empty buses, in the knots of people walking to work and home, in
the car-pool vehicles carrying people around the city. In such times, as
historian Steve Golin says of Paterson, [movements become "a way of
life,"]{.underline} **developing complex organizations, generating and
drawing on new talents, creating new patterns of living, opening up new
possibilities for ordinary people, inspiring**---**and needing**---their
**ingenuity, sacrifice, and** even **heroism**. **Becoming members of a
larger entity, we draw power from it, have a responsibility to it, and
experience ourselves within it.** This remarkable change in our being is
accompanied by a no less remarkable change in our perception. By
becoming collective actors opposing ourselves to other actors, we look
for their weaknesses and resistances as well as our own strengths and
the objective possibilities of change. The once fixed and frozen field
before us becomes redefined as our practical one, and [as we become its
active agents our adversaries lose their apparent quality of givenness
and unchangeability.]{.underline} The complex historical and social
field now becomes a series of guides, helps, and obstacles. This change
in how we see is also a change in what we see, as "the way things are"
begins to appear as humanly created. [Thus collective hope evokes a
sense of potency and possibility. Fragile, it is always linked to what
we are doing and how we are doing it. Change either---for example caving
into the other side without democratic deliberation---and it can easily
dissolve, or morph into mere rhetoric. As long as hope is]{.underline}
alive it is neither an abstraction nor an entity, but a current that
runs among us: **an animating force bringing and keeping people together
and inspiring them to keep going**. Of course, on the negative side,
those on the right also have their hopes, and they struggle fiercely to
assert them. They have included fascist movements, the forces of
segregation and apartheid as well as colonialism and religious
fundamentalism, and organizations built around the defense of various
kinds of privilege and inequality. But they do not believe, nor does
their functioning reflect, that all people have equal worth. Nor, when
they act collectively for a common cause, do they demonstrate a sense of
wider human solidarity. Moreover, outside the left, democratic
functioning is not generally expected as a norm of collective action,
making authoritarianism especially frequent in movements of the right.
On the right people do not come together to abolish special privileges,
but to assert them. Yes, even a lynch mob has its own kind of hope. But
it is fair to call it a twisted hope, its racism and violence expressing
an antisocial hope. There is a kind of despair in the hope that
excludes. How do these reflections on social hope illuminate the
political upheavals of 2016 and our current situation? Certainly,
Hillary Clinton embodied the hope of millions of women to break through
the glass ceiling. No less than Obama's election, hers would have been a
major historical reversal. But it turns out that fervent hope for
Hillary's election was mostly confined to the "Pants Suit Nation" and
small numbers actively worked to make it happen. Indeed, a slightly
smaller percentage of women wound up voting for Hillary Clinton than
voted for Obama in 2012. Women's hopes did not become a significant
active force in the 2016 election, and as it turned out Clinton had
become clearly identified with the Democratic establishment and its
goals and machinery. On the other hand, running against all
establishments was the essence of Donald Trump's campaign. It showed the
unexpected power of an outsider insurgency to upend the political scene.
In this sense, his election was a striking testimony to the hopeful
"power of positive thinking," drawn from his onetime mentor Norman
Vincent Peale. After all, [Trump did accomplish what "realists" had
thought impossible by voicing the anger of his otherwise-ignored
supporters as well as the wish to "shake things up." But this was never
the active, collective, solidaristic social hope I've been talking
about]{.underline}, and it was connected to racism, bigotry, and
misogyny, which his supporters actively supported or at least condoned.
[Whatever people might have experienced in supporting and voting for
Trump, it was nothing like the forward-looking, active, collective hope
of a left movement---but rather a cult of personality, focused on what
he would do for us. If Trump's campaign restored a kind of hope to
members of the white working class, it had nothing to do with
collectively building a better future,]{.underline} but turned on a sour
mood of nostalgia infused with xenophobia. Moreover, his cabinet
selections indicate that his actual practice of governing was not likely
to shake up the establishment at all but turn power over to its most
narrow and extreme wing, keen to implement its own agenda rather than
responding to his working-class supporters. In all of these ways, [Trump
embodies what I would call anti-hope]{.underline}. In contrast, the
Bernie **Sanders**campaign **rekindled a vision of collective action
that is of the essence of social hope**; a we committed to expanding and
deepening democracy. It created a sense of active community at its
events, on the Internet, and on social media. It fueled a belief that
things could change and that the movement itself would help to enact
that change. Unlike Obama's "hope" the [Sanders campaign actually made
demands that focused on upsetting relations of power and privilege,
proposed specific changes]{.underline} **to a system of inequality and
poverty**. These goals were called "unrealistic," but the movement's
feeling for possibility was not: It raised financial support from
millions of small donors, and it grew like wildfire as Bernie began to
win primaries and give Hillary Clinton a run for her money. Though the
Sanders campaign did not hinge explicitly on a slogan of hope, unlike
Obama eight years earlier, it more concretely contained the stuff of
social hope, becoming a movement built on sincerity, idealism, a
rejection of cynicism, and a striking sense of possibility. Its many
[specific proposals contained a broad, evenuniversal appeal: reducing
inequality by demanding that the very rich pay a fair share of their
income in taxes; a living wage; government-funded and universal health
care; free college education; dismantling corporate-friendly free trade
agreements; and a serious effort to protect the
environment.]{.underline} Yes, Trump stirred hopes of millions of
working-class voters, but this was not the social hope I've been
describing but its distorting-mirror opposite. Like other anti-hope
movements in the last century, it encouraged a regressive faith in the
authoritarian strongman: If we can't change things---more precisely if
we can't make things the way they used to be---maybe he can. The Bernie
Sanders movement, in contrast, began to revive the kind of genuine
social hope the Occupy movement had stimulated. And his age and white
hair visibly symbolized his connection with a deeper past, reviving the
very history of hope he evoked by calling himself a democratic
socialist. In doing so, Sanders broke the great American political taboo
against actively hoping for alternatives to the existing socio-economic
system. Amazingly, he was welcomed rather than marginalized for doing so
by a large portion of the electorate. In the course of a few months, the
Sanders movement became the largest progressive force in national
electoral politics in over 100 years. [Now that Trump is president, an
even larger movement is beginning to form, seeking to mobilize the power
of resistance. It seems likely to organize on many levels and involve
millions, around a single goal: to block Trump.]{.underline} Even if it
is not a movement for a given program, in acting together people will
once again feel their power, and possibly in a far wider collectivity
than ever before in the history of this country. It will be primarily a
defensive movement, but the experience will transform people who
participate. Who knows where it will lead?

### Whiteness 

#### The 1ac mythologizes whiteness, boiling it down to an absolutely empty signifier that can contingently represent anything or everything that doesn't come in line with the aff's ontological politics - this ensures a form of wounded repetition for Black folks that prevents revolutionary form of becoming- to demythologize whiteness, we must devise new approaches to the constitution of desire and symbolic capital

[What we are hearing is that there have not been enough meaningful,
decisive, radical change]{.underline}, not only in terms of the life
chances of the black poor, but -- and this is the novelty -- in terms of
the future prospects of the black middle class. What is being said is
that twenty years after freedom, [[we have not disrupted enough the
structures that maintain and reproduce "white power]{.mark} and
supremacy]{.underline}"; that this is the reason why too many amongst us
are trapped in a "bad life" that keeps wearing them out and down; that
this wearing out and down of black life has been going on for too long
and must now be brought to an end by all means necessary (the right to
violence?). [We are being told that we have not radically overturned the
particular sets of interests that are produced and reproduced through
white privilege in institutions of public and private life -- [in law
firms, in financial institutions such as banking and insurance, in
advertising and industry, in terms of land redistribution, in media,
universities, languages and culture in general]{.mark}.]{.underline}
"[Whiteness", "white power", "white supremacy", "white monopoly capital"
is firmly back on the political and cultural agenda]{.underline} and to
be white in South Africa now is to face a new-old kind of trial although
with new judges -- the so-called "born-free". Politics of impatience But
behind whites trial looms a broader indictment of South African social
and political order. South Africa is fast approaching its Fanonian
moment. A mass of structurally disenfranchised people have the feeling
of being treated as "foreigners" on their own land. Convinced that the
doors of opportunity are closing, they are asking for firmer
demarcations between "citizens" (those who belong) and "foreigners"
(those who must be excluded). They are convinced that as the doors of
opportunity keep closing, those who won't be able to "get in" right now
might be left out for generations to come -- thus the social stampede,
the rush to "get in" before it gets too late, the willingness to risk a
fight because waiting is no longer a viable option. [[The old
politics]{.underline}]{.mark} of waiting [[is]{.underline}]{.mark}
therefore [gradually [replaced by a]{.mark} new [politics of]{.mark}
impatience and]{.underline}, if necessary, of [[disruption]{.mark}.
Brashness, disruption and a new [anti-decorum ethos are meant to bring
down]{.mark} the pretence of normality and the logics of
[normalization]{.mark}]{.underline} in this most "abnormal" society.
Steve [Biko,]{.underline} Frantz [Fanon]{.underline} [and [a plethora of
black feminist, queer,]{.mark} postcolonial, decolonial and critical
race [theorists are being reloaded in the service of]{.mark} a new form
of [militancy]{.mark} less accommodationist [and more trenchant both in
form and content]{.mark}.]{.underline} The age of impatience is an age
when a lot is said -- all sorts of things we had hardly heard about
during the last twenty years; some ugly, outrageous, toxic things,
including calls for murder, atrocious things that speak to everything
except to the project of freedom, in this age of fantasy and hysteria,
when [[the gap between psychic realities and actual material realities
has never been so wide]{.underline}]{.mark}, and the digital world only
serves as an amplifier of every single moment, event and accident. [The
age of urgency is also an age when new wounded bodies erupt and
undertake to actually occupy spaces they used to simply haunt. [They are
now piling up]{.mark}, swearing and cursing, speaking with excrements,
[asking to be heard. They speak in allegories and analogies -- the
"colony", the "plantation"]{.mark}]{.underline}[,]{.mark} the "house
Negro", the "field Negro", [blurring all boundaries, [embracing
confusion, mixing times and spaces]{.mark}, at the risk of anachronism.
They are claiming]{.underline} all kinds of rights -- the right to
violence; [the right to disrupt and jam that which is parading as
normal;]{.underline} the right to insult, intimidate and bully those who
do not agree with them; [[the right to be angry, enraged; the right to
go to war in the hope of recovering what was lost]{.mark} through
conquest; the right to hate, to wreak vengeance, [to smash something, it
doesn't matter what, as long as it looks "white"]{.mark}.]{.underline}
All these new "rights" are supposed to achieve one thing we are told the
1994 "peaceful settlement" did not achieve -- decolonization and
retributive justice, the only way to restore a modicum of dignity to
victims of the injuries of yesterday and today. Demythologizing
whiteness And yet, some hard questions must be asked. [Why are we
invested in turning whiteness, pain and suffering into]{.underline} such
erotogenic [objects]{.underline}? [Could it be that the concentration of
our libido on whiteness, pain and suffering is after all typical of the
narcissistic investments so privileged by this neoliberal
age?]{.underline} To frame the issues in these terms does not mean
embracing a position of moral relativism. How could it be? After all, in
relation to our history, too many lives were destroyed in the name of
whiteness. Furthermore, [[the structural repetition of past sufferings
in the present is beyond any reasonable doubt. Whiteness as a
necrophiliac power structure and a primary shaper of a global system of
unequal redistribution of life chances will not die a natural death.
**But to properly engineer its death**]{.underline}]{.mark} -- and thus
the end of the nightmare it has been for a large portion of the humanity
-- **[[we urgently need to demythologize it]{.mark}.]{.underline}** [If
we fail to properly demythologize whiteness, whiteness]{.underline} --
as the machine in which a huge portion of the humanity has become
entangled in spite of itself -- [will end up claiming us.]{.underline}
As a result of whiteness having claimed us; as a result of [having let
ourselves be possessed]{.underline} by it in the manner of an evil
spirit, [we will inflict upon ourselves injuries of which
whiteness]{.underline}, at its most ferocious, [would scarcely have been
capable.]{.underline} Indeed for [[whiteness]{.underline}]{.mark} to
properly operate as the destructive force it is in the material sphere,
it [[needs to capture its victim's imagination]{.underline}]{.mark} and
turn it into a poison well of hatred. For victims of white racism to
hold on to the things that truly matter, [they must incessantly fight
against the kind of hatred which never fails to destroy, in the first
instance, the person ~~man or woman~~ who hates while leaving the
structure of whiteness itself intact.]{.underline} As a poisonous
fiction that passes for a fact, whiteness seeks to institutionalize
itself as an event by any means necessary. This it does by colonizing
the entire realms of desire and of the imagination. [[To demythologize
whiteness, it will not be enough to force "bad whites" into silence or
into confessing guilt and/or complicity]{.mark}. [This is too cheap.
To]{.mark} puncture and [deflate]{.mark} the fictions of [whiteness will
require an entirely different regime of desire, new approaches in the
constitution of]{.mark} material, aesthetic and [symbolic
capital]{.mark}, another discourse on value, on what matters and
why.]{.underline} The demythologization of whiteness also requires that
we develop a more complex understanding of South African versions of
whiteness here and now. This is the only country on Earth in which a
revolution took place which resulted in not one single former oppressor
losing anything. In order to keep its privileges intact in the post-1994
era, South African [[whiteness]{.mark} has sought to intensify its
capacity to invest in what we should call the resources of the offshore.
It [has attempted to fence itself off, to re-maximize its privileges
through self-enclaving and the logics of
privatization]{.mark}]{.underline}. These logics of offshoring and
self-enclaving are typical of this neoliberal age.

#### *Race* and *whiteness* as categories are the result of [specific material conditions]{.underline} resulting from the changes in production throughout [economic history]{.underline}. They are not immutable categories which can form a meaningful basis for social organization.

**Haider 18** (Asad, founding Editor of Viewpoint Magazine, an
investigative journal of contemporary politics, PhD candidate in the
History of Consciousness at UC Santa Cruz, and a member of UAW-2865, the
Student-Workers Union at the University of California, *Mistaken
Identity: Race and Class in the Trump Age*, Verso, 2018)

This does not mean, however, that a "class reductionist" argument is a
viable position. [As long as racial solidarity among whites is more
powerful than class solidarity]{.underline} [across races]{.underline},
both [capitalism and whiteness will continue to exist.]{.underline} In
the context of American history, [the rhetoric of the "**white working
class**"]{.underline} [and]{.underline} positivist [arguments that class
matters more than race reinforce]{.underline} [one of the main
**obstacles to building socialism.**]{.underline}

Allen and Ignatiev turned to this question in their further research,
inspired by the insights of Du Bois. In the process they presented an
exemplary model of a materialist investigation into the ideology of
race, one that went from the abstract to the concrete. This work emerged
alongside that of Barbara [Fields]{.underline} and Karen Fields, David
[Roediger]{.underline}, [and many others]{.underline} as a body of
thought [devoted to exposing [race]{.mark} as a social
construct]{.underline}. All of this research, in varying ways, has
examined the history of the "white race" in its specificity. The guiding
insight that must be drawn from it is that [this racial phenomenon [is
**not simply a biological** or even **cultural attribute**]{.mark} of
certain "white people":]{.underline} [[it was produced by white
supremacy in a **concrete** and **objective historical
process**]{.underline}]{.mark}. As Allen put it on the back cover of his
extraordinary vernacular history The Invention of the White Race: "When
the first Africans arrived in Virginia in 1619, there were no white
people there."

At the most immediate level, Allen was pointing to the fact that the
word white didn't appear in Virginia colonial law until 1691. Of course,
this doesn't mean that there was no racism before 1691. Allen's argument
was to show that [racism was not attached to a concept of the white
race]{.underline}. [There were [ideas of the superiority]{.mark} of
European civilization]{.underline}, [but this [did not correspond
to]{.mark} differences in [skin color]{.mark}]{.underline}.

[[The clearest example is that of the **Irish**]{.mark}, [whose racial
oppression by the English precedes their racial oppression of Africans
by **several centuries**]{.mark}]{.underline}. Today [white nationalists
distort this history]{.underline}, attempting to use the racial
oppression of the Irish to try to dismiss the history of white
supremacy. [Yet this example actually demolishes their **entire
framework**]{.underline}. What the example of [the Irish illustrates is
a form of racial oppression that is **not based on skin
color**]{.underline} and [that [in fact **precedes the very category of
whiteness**]{.mark}.]{.underline}

Indeed, [the early forms of [English racial ideology represented the
Irish as **inferior** and **subhuman**]{.mark}]{.underline}, and [[this
ideology was]{.mark} later [repeated]{.mark} word for word [to]{.mark}
[justify]{.mark} [both the **genocide of Indigenous
people**]{.mark}]{.underline} [in the Americas [and the **enslavement of
Africans**]{.mark}]{.underline}. Nor was it only a matter of words:
[[the]{.mark} very pra[ctices of **settler
colonialism**]{.mark}]{.underline}[, **[land]{.underline}**
**[seizures]{.underline}**, [and]{.underline} **[plantation
production]{.underline}** [were]{.underline} **[established in
Ireland]{.underline}**]{.mark}. Allen demonstrates this with reference
to specific laws:

> If under Anglo-American slavery, "the rape of a female slave was not a
> crime, but a mere trespass on the master's property," so, in 1278, two
> Anglo-Normans, brought into court and charged with raping Margaret
> O'Rorke were found not guilty because "the said Margaret is an
> Irishwoman." [If a law enacted in Virginia in 1723, provided that,
> "manslaughter of a slave is not punishable]{.underline}," [so under
> Anglo-Norman law [it sufficed for acquittal to show that the
> victim]{.mark} in a slaying [was **Irish**]{.mark}]{.underline}.
> Anglo-Norman priests granted absolution on the grounds that it was "no
> more sin to kill an Irishman than a dog or any other brute."9

So [racial oppression arises in the Irish case **without skin color as
its basis**]{.underline}. We are forced to ask [how we end up with a
racial ideology revolving around skin color that represents African
people as subhuman and that considers both Irish and English to be part
of a unitary "white race."]{.underline}

The historical record quite clearly demonstrates that [[white
supremacy]{.mark} and thus the white race are [formed within the
American **transition to capitalism**]{.mark}]{.underline},
[specifically because of the centrality of **racial
slavery**]{.underline}. However, [[we have to **resist the
temptation**]{.underline}, [imposed]{.underline}]{.mark} on us [[by
racial ideology, **to explain slavery through
race**]{.underline}]{.mark}. [[Slavery is **not always
racial**]{.underline}]{.mark}. It existed in ancient Greece and Rome and
also in Africa, and was not attached specifically to a racial ideology.
[Slavery is a form of forced labor characterized by the market exchange
of the laborer]{.underline}. But [there are various forms of **forced
labor**]{.underline}, and its first form in Virginia was indentured
labor, in which a laborer is forced to work for a limited period of time
to work off a debt, often with some incentive like land ownership after
the end of the term. [The first Africans to arrive in Virginia 1619 were
put to work as **indentured servants**]{.underline}, within the same
legal category as European indentured servants. In fact, **[[until 1660
all African American laborers]{.underline}]{.mark}**, like their
European American counterparts, **[[were indentured
servants]{.underline}]{.mark}** who had limited terms of servitude.
[There was **no legal differentiation based on racial
ideology**]{.underline}: free African Americans owned property, land,
and sometimes indentured servants of their own. There were examples of
intermarriage between Europeans and Africans. [It was only in the late
seventeenth century]{.underline} [that the labor force of the American
colonies shifted decisively to African slaves]{.underline} who did not
have limits on their terms of servitude.

As Painter points out in The History of White People, [these forms of
labor]{.underline} and their transformations [are fundamental in
understanding how racial ideology comes about]{.underline}:

> Work plays a central part in race talk, because the people who do the
> work are likely to be figured as inherently deserving the toil and
> poverty of laboring status. It is still assumed, wrongly, that slavery
> anywhere in the world must rest on a foundation of racial difference.
> Time and again, the better classes have concluded that those people
> deserve their lot; it must be something within them that puts them at
> the bottom. In modern times, we recognize this kind of reasoning as it
> relates to black race, but in other times the same logic was applied
> to people who were white, especially when they were impoverished
> immigrants seeking work.10

"In sum," Painter writes, "[before an eighteenth-century boom in the
African slave trade, between [one-half]{.mark} and two-thirds [of
all]{.mark} early white [immigrants to the British colonies]{.mark} in
the Western Hemisphere came as unfree laborers]{.underline}, some
300,000 to 400,000 people."11 [The [definitions of whiteness as freedom
and blackness as slavery **did not yet exist**]{.mark}]{.underline}.

It turns out that defining race involves answering some unexpected
historical questions: How did some indentured servants come to be forced
into bondage for their entire lives rather than a limited term? [How did
this category of forced labor come to be represented in terms of
race]{.underline}? [Why did the colonial ruling class come to rely on
racial slavery when various other regimes of labor were
available]{.underline}?

The first economic boom of the American colonies was in Virginia tobacco
production in the 1620s, and it was based on the labor of primarily
European indentured servants. [African Americans were only about a fifth
of the labor force]{.underline}: [most forced labor was initially
European]{.underline}, [and the colonial planter class relied on this
forced labor for its economic growth]{.underline}. But they couldn't
just rely on European indentured labor because it was based on voluntary
migration, and the incentive to participate in a life of brutal labor
and die early was not sufficient to generate a consistently growing
workforce. As Barbara Fields puts it, "[Neither white skin nor English
nationality protected servants from the grossest forms of brutality and
exploitation]{.underline}. [The only degradation they were spared was
perpetual enslavement along with their issue in perpetuity, the fate
that eventually befell the descendants of Africans]{.underline}."12

[African Americans]{.underline}, on the other hand, [had been forcibly
removed from their homelands]{.underline}. [So the ruling class began to
alter its laws to be able to deny some laborers an end to their terms of
servitude]{.underline}, [which they were only able to accomplish in the
case of African laborers]{.underline}. What really changed everything
was **[[Bacon's Rebellion]{.underline}]{.mark}** in 1676. This began as
a conflict within the elite planter class, directed toward a brutal
attack on the Indigenous population. But it also gave rise to
[[a]{.mark} rebellious [mob of European and African
laborers]{.mark}]{.underline}, who [[burned down]{.mark} the capital
city of [Jamestown]{.mark}]{.underline} and forced the governor to flee.
[[The insurrectionary alliance]{.mark} of European and African laborers
[was a fundamental **existential threat to the colonial ruling
class**]{.mark}]{.underline}, [and the possibility of such an alliance
among exploited peoples **had to be prevented forever**]{.underline}.

Here we see a watershed moment in the long and complex process of the
invention of the white race as a form of social control. [[The ruling
class shifted]{.mark} its labor force decisively [toward African
slaves]{.mark}]{.underline}, [[and]{.underline}]{.mark} thus [[avoided
dealing with the demand of indentured servants]{.mark} for eventual
freedom and landownership]{.underline}. [[It fortified whiteness as a
legal category]{.underline}]{.mark}, [the basis for denying an end to
the term of servitude for African forced labor]{.underline}. By the
eighteenth century [the Euro-American planter class had entered into a
bargain with the Euro-American laboring classes]{.underline}, who were
mostly independent subsistence farmers: [[it exchanged]{.mark} certain
[social privileges]{.mark} for a cross-class alliance of Euro-Americans
[to **preserve a superexploited African labor
force**]{.mark}]{.underline}. [This]{.underline} Euro-American [racial
alliance was the best defense of the ruling class against the
possibility of a]{.underline} Euro-American and African American
**[working-class alliance]{.underline}**. It is at this point, Nell
Painter concludes, that we see the "now familiar equation that converts
race to black and black to slave."13

[The invention of the white race]{.underline} further [accelerated when
the Euro-American ruling class encountered a new problem]{.underline} in
the eighteenth century. [As the colonial ruling class began to
demand]{.underline} its [independence]{.underline} from the divinely
ordained executives and landed wealth of the English nobility, [they
made claims for the intrinsic equality of all people and the idea of
natural rights]{.underline}. As Barbara Fields puts it:

> [[Racial ideology supplied the means of explaining slavery to]{.mark}
> people whose terrain was a republic founded on [radical doctrines of
> liberty]{.mark} and natural rights]{.underline}, and, more important,
> a republic in which those doctrines seemed to represent accurately the
> world in which all but a minority lived. [Only when the denial of
> liberty became an anomaly]{.underline} apparent even to the least
> observant and reflective members of Euro-American society di[d
> ideology systematically explain the anomaly]{.underline}.14

In other words, [the Euro-American ruling class had to advance an
ideology of the inferiority of Africans in order to **rationalize forced
labor**]{.underline}, [and they had to incorporate European populations
into the category of the white race]{.underline}, despite the fact that
many of these populations had previously been considered inferior.

[This racial ideology developed further as the new American nation
encountered]{.underline} the phenomenon of the [voluntary migration of
free laborers]{.underline} from Europe, many of whom came from
populations that were viewed as distinct European races: the Italians,
Eastern Europeans, and Jews, but especially the exemplary case of the
Irish, whose emigration to the US spiked with the famines of the
mid-nineteenth century produced by English colonialism.

[The Irish, among the most oppressed and rebellious groups in Europe,
were offered the bargain that had protected the American ruling
class]{.underline}. Frederick Douglass pointed this out very clearly in
1853, at the anniversary meeting of the American and Foreign
Anti-Slavery Society in New York:

> The Irish, who, at home, readily sympathize with the oppressed
> everywhere, are instantly taught when they step upon our soil to hate
> and despise the Negro. They are taught to believe that he eats the
> bread that belongs to them. The cruel lie is told them, that we
> deprive them of labor and receive the money which would otherwise make
> its way into their pockets. Sir, the Irish-American will find out his
> mistake one day.15

Douglass had gone to Ireland to avoid being returned to slavery and said
he was for the first time in his life treated as an ordinary person,
exclaiming in a letter to the abolitionist William Lloyd Garrison, "I
breathe, and lo! the chattel becomes a man ... I meet nothing to remind
me of my complexion."16 Of course, this was not because of some
intrinsic kindness of the Irish. It was rather because, at this stage in
history, there were no white people there. This was clear to Douglass
because he arrived during the Great Famine. Writing in his memoirs of
the songs sung by slaves on the American plantations, he added: "Nowhere
outside of dear old Ireland, in the days of want and famine, have I
heard sounds so mournful."17

But [what Irish immigrants realized after immigrating to the United
States is that they could ameliorate their subjugation by joining the
club of the white race]{.underline}, as Ignatiev has recounted.18 [They
could become members of a "white race" with higher status if
they]{.underline} actively supp[orted the continuing enslavement and
oppression of African Americans.]{.underline} So [the process of
becoming white meant that]{.underline} these [previous racial
categories]{.underline} [were abolished and racialized groups like the
Irish were progressively incorporated into the white race]{.underline}
[as a means of fortifying]{.underline} and intensifying [the
exploitation of black laborers.]{.underline}

It was the great insight of Frederick Douglass to describe this as the
Irish-American's mistake. Douglass clearly emphasized the novelty of the
very description of people as white: "The word white is a modern term in
the legislation of this country. It was never used in the better days of
the Republic, but has sprung up within the period of our national
degeneracy."19 Let us be clear on what [the invention of the white
race]{.underline} meant. It [meant that Euro-American laborers were
prevented from joining with African American laborers in
rebellion]{.underline}, through the form of social control imposed by
the Euro-American ruling class. In exchange for white-skin privilege,
the Euro-American workers accepted white identity and became active
agents in the brutal oppression of African American laborers. But they
also fundamentally degraded their own conditions of existence. As a
consequence of this bargain with their exploiters, [they allowed the
conditions of the Southern white laborer to become the most impoverished
in the nation]{.underline}, [and they generated conditions that
**blocked the development of a viable mass workers'
movement**]{.underline}.

This is why [[the struggle against white supremacy
has]{.underline}]{.mark} in fact [[been a struggle for **universal
emancipation**]{.underline}]{.mark}---[something that was apparent to
African American insurgents]{.underline}. As Barbara Fields points out,
these [[**insurgents did not use** a notion of **race as an explanation
for their oppression**]{.underline}]{.mark} or their struggles for
liberation:

> It was not Afro-Americans ... who needed a racial explanation; it was
> not they who invented themselves as a race. [Euro-Americans resolved
> the contradiction between slavery and liberty by defining
> Afro-Americans as a race;]{.underline} [Afro-Americans resolved the
> contradiction more straightforwardly by calling for the abolition of
> slavery]{.underline}. From the era of the American, French and Haitian
> revolutions on, they claimed liberty as theirs by natural right.20

However, this was not always recognized by socialist movements. Early
American socialists in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries
sometimes failed to recognize that the division between white and black
workers prevented all workers from successfully emancipating themselves.
We should not oversimplify this point or use it to discredit the whole
history of the labor movement. [The early socialist parties were largely
composed of immigrants who were often not yet fully incorporated into
the white race]{.underline}, [and [there were very significant black
socialists]{.mark}]{.underline}---[including, for example, Hubert
Harrison, [who played an important role in connecting black nationalism
to socialism]{.mark} at the beginning of the twentieth
century]{.underline}. The majority of the early American socialists were
not racists, and in fact openly and vigorously opposed racism.

However, [most of these early socialist organizations failed to
recognize that there was anything unique about the demands of black
workers]{.underline}. They were also willing to work with craft unions
that discriminated against black workers, and they did not attempt to
recruit black members. [Without an analysis of white
supremacy]{.underline}, these [socialist organizations did not address
the fact that black workers were often excluded]{.underline} from jobs
available to whites, [that they were subjected to racist
violence]{.underline} beyond the workplace, [and that they could not
expect racist employers to]{.underline} [extend increasing wages to
them.]{.underline}

[[The cost of]{.underline}]{.mark} this [[indifference to race was that
socialism was always **competing for recruitment with
whiteness**]{.underline}]{.mark}. New European [immigrants]{.underline}
[were]{.underline} [often]{.underline} very radical and [prepared to
join militant labor struggles. But they were also being invited to join
the white race]{.underline}. Once again, in the case of the Irish, this
meant finally leaving behind the racial oppression that had become
familiar to them in Europe.

**[It's important to say what [hope]{.mark} is not: it [is not the

thinking without hope is cynicism, but hope without critical thinking is

Patrisse Cullors, one of the founders of Black Lives Matter, early on
described the movement's mission as to "Provide hope and inspiration for
collective action to build collective power to achieve collective
transformation, rooted in grief and rage but pointed towards vision and
dreams." It's a statement that acknowledges that **[[grief and hope can
coexist]{.underline}]{.mark}**.; Tunisian hip-hop artist El Général was,
along with Bouazizi, an instigator of the uprising, and other musicians
played roles in articulating the outrage and inspiring the crowds.
Mushroomed: after a rain mushrooms appear on the surface of the earth as
if from nowhere. Many do so from a sometimes vast underground fungus
that remains invisible and largely unknown. What we call mushrooms
mycologists call the fruiting body of the larger, less visible fungus.
Uprisings and revolutions are often considered to be spontaneous, but
less visible long-term organizing and groundwork--- or underground
work---often laid the foundation. **[[Changes in ideas and values also
result from work]{.mark} done by writers, scholars, public
intellectuals, social activists, and participants in social media. [It
seems insignificant or peripheral until very different outcomes emerge
from transformed assumptions about]{.mark} who and [what
matters]{.mark}, who should be heard [and]{.mark} believed[, who has
rights]{.mark}]{.underline}**[.]{.mark} Ideas at first considered
outrageous or ridiculous or extreme gradually become what people think
they've always believed. How the transformation happened is rarely
remembered, in part because it's compromising: it recalls the mainstream
when the mainstream was, say, rabidly homophobic or racist in a way it
no longer is; and it recalls that power comes from the shadows and the
margins, that our hope is in the dark around the edges, not the
limelight of center stage. Our hope and often our power. The Stories We
Tell Changing the story isn't enough in itself, but it has often been
foundational to real changes. Making an injury visible and public is
often the first step in remedying it, and political change often follows
culture, as what was long tolerated is seen to be intolerable, or what
was overlooked becomes obvious. Which means that every conflict is in
part a battle over the story we tell, or who tells and who is heard. A
victory doesn't mean that everything is now going to be nice forever and
we can therefore all go lounge around until the end of time. Some
activists are afraid that if we acknowledge victory, people will give up
the struggle. **[[I've long been more afraid that people will give up
and go home or never get started in the first place if they think no
victory is possible or fail to recognize the victories already
achieved]{.underline}]{.mark}**. **[Marriage equality is not the end of
homophobia, but it's something to celebrate. [A victory is a milestone
on the road, evidence that sometimes we win, and encouragement to keep
going, not to stop]{.mark}]{.underline}**. Or it should be. My own
inquiry into the grounds for hope has received two great reinforcements
since I wrote Hope in the Dark. One came from the recognition of how
powerful are the altruistic, idealistic forces already at work in the
world. Most of us would say, if asked, that we live in a capitalist
society, but vast The tremendous human rights achievements---not only in
gaining rights but in redefining race, gender, sexuality, embodiment,
spirituality, and the idea of the good life---of the past half century
have flowered during a time of unprecedented ecological destruction and
the rise of innovative new means of exploitation. And the rise of new
forms of resistance, including resistance enabled by an elegant
understanding of that ecology and new ways for people to communicate and
organize, and new and exhilarating alliances across distance and
difference. Hope locates itself in the premises that we don't know what
will happen and that in the spaciousness of uncertainty is room to act.
**[When you recognize uncertainty, you recognize that you may be able to
influence the outcomes---you alone or you in concert with a few dozen or
several million others. [Hope is an embrace of the unknown and the
unknowable, an alternative to the certainty of both optimists and
pessimists.]{.mark}]{.underline}** [**[Optimists think it will all be
fine without our involvement; pessimists take the opposite position;
both excuse themselves from acting]{.underline}**]{.mark}. It's the
belief that what we do matters even though how and when it may matter,
who and what it may impact, are not things we can know beforehand. We
may not, in fact, know them afterward either, but they matter all the
same, and history is full of people whose influence was most powerful
after they were gone. There are major movements that failed to achieve
their goals; there are also comparatively small gestures that mushroomed
into successful revolutions. The self-immolation of impoverished,
police-harassed produce-seller Mohamed Bouazizi on December 17, 2010, in
Tunisia was the spark that lit a revolution in his country and then
across northern Africa and other parts of the Arab world in 2011. And
though the civil war in Syria and the counterrevolutions after Egypt's
extraordinary uprising might be what most remember, Tunisia's "Jasmine
Revolution" toppled a dictator and led to peaceful elections in that
country in 2014. Whatever else the Arab Spring was, it's an
extraordinary example of how unpredictable change is and how potent
popular power can be. And five years on, it's too soon to draw
conclusions about what it all meant. You can tell the Genesis story of
the Arab Spring other ways. The quiet organizing going on in the shadows
beforehand matters. So does the comic book about Martin Luther King and
civil disobedience that was translated into Arabic and widely
distributed in Egypt shortly before the Arab Spring. You can tell of
King's civil disobedience tactics being inspired by Gandhi's tactics,
and Gandhi's inspired by Tolstoy and the radical acts of noncooperation
and sabotage of British women suffragists. So the threads of ideas weave
around the world and through the decades and centuries. There's another
lineage for the Arab Spring in hip-hop, the African American music
that's become a global medium for self-organizing, as if by instinct
when the situation demands it. Thus a disaster is a lot like a
revolution when it comes to disruption and improvisation, to new roles
and an unnerving or exhilarating sense that now anything is possible.
This was a revolutionary vision of human nature and a revelation that we
can pursue our ideals not out of diligence but because when they are
realized there's joy, and joy is itself an insurrectionary force against
the dreariness and dullness and isolation of everyday life. **[My own
research was, I realized by its end, a small part of an enormous project
going on among many disciplines---psychology, economics, neurobiology,
sociology, anthropology, political science---to redefine human nature as
something more communal, cooperative, and compassionate. This rescue of
our reputations from the social darwinists and the Hobbesians is
important, not to feel positive about ourselves but to recognize the
radical possibilities that can be built on an alternative view of human
nature.]{.underline}** The fruits of these inquiries made me more
hopeful. But it's important to emphasize that hope is only a beginning;
it's not a substitute for action, only a basis for it. "Not everything
that is faced can be changed, but nothing can be changed until it is
faced," said James Baldwin. Hope gets you there; work gets you through.
"The future belongs to those who prepare for it today," said Malcolm X.
And there is a long history of that work, the work to change the world,
a long history of methods, heroes, visionaries, heroines,
victories---and, of course, failures. But the victories matter, and
remembering them matters too. "We must accept finite disappointment, but
never lose infinite hope," said Martin Luther King Jr. The Branches Are
Hope; the Roots Are Memory "Memory produces hope in the same way that
amnesia produces despair," the theologian Walter Brueggeman noted. It's
an extraordinary statement, one that reminds us that though hope is
about the future, grounds for hope lie in the records and recollections
of the past. We can tell of a past that was nothing but defeats and
cruelties and injustices, or of a past that was some lovely golden age
now irretrievably lost, or we can tell a more complicated and accurate
story, one that has room for the best and worst, for atrocities and
liberations, for grief and jubilation. A memory commensurate to the
complexity of the past and the whole cast of participants, a memory that
includes our power, produces that forwarddirected energy called hope.
Amnesia leads to despair in many ways. **[[The status quo would like you
to believe it is immutable, inevitable, and invulnerable, and lack of
memory of a dynamically changing world reinforces this view]{.mark}. In
other words, [when you don't know how much things have changed, you
don't see that they are changing or that they can
change.]{.mark}]{.underline}** **[Those who think that amounts of how we
live our everyday lives---our interactions with and commitments to
family lives, friendships, avocations, membership in social, spiritual,
and political organizations---are in essence noncapitalist or even
anticapitalist, full of things we do for free, out of love, and on
principle]{.underline}**. In a way, capitalism is an ongoing disaster
anticapitalism alleviates, like a mother cleaning up after her child's
messes (or, to extend the analogy, sometimes disciplining that child to
clean up after itself, through legislation or protest, or preventing
some of the messes in the first place, and it might be worth adding that
noncapitalist ways of doing things are much older than free-market
economic arrangements). Activists often speak as though the solutions we
need have not yet been launched or invented, as though we are starting
from scratch, when often the real goal is to amplify the power and reach
of existing alternatives. What we dream of is already present in the
world. The second reinforcement came out of my investigation of how
human beings respond to major urban disasters, from the devastating
earthquakes in San Francisco (in 1906) and Mexico City (in 1985) to the
Blitz in London to Hurricane Katrina in New Orleans. The assumption
behind much disaster response by the authorities---and the logic of
bombing civilians---is that civilization is a brittle façade, and behind
it lies our true nature as monstrous, selfish, chaotic, and violent or
as timid, fragile, and helpless. In fact, in most disasters most people
are calm, resourceful, altruistic, and creative. And civilian bombing
campaigns generally fail to break the will of the people, making them a
waste as well as a crime against humanity. What startled me about the
response to disaster was not the virtue, since virtue is often the
result of diligence and dutifulness, but the passionate joy that shined
out from accounts by people who had barely survived. These people who
had lost everything, who were living in rubble or ruins, had found
agency, meaning, community, immediacy in their work together with other
survivors. The century of testimony I drew from for my 2009 book A
Paradise Built in Hell suggested how much we want lives of meaningful
engagement, of membership in civil society, and how much societal effort
goes into withering us away from these fullest, most powerful selves.
But people return to those selves, those ways of Downloaded from
liberated country is no longer news. It won its liberty because of
valiant struggle from within, but also because of dedicated groups on
the outside who pressured and shamed the governments supporting the
Indonesian regime. **[[We could learn quite a lot from the remarkable
display of power and solidarity and East Timor's eventual victory, but
the whole struggle seems forgotten]{.underline}]{.mark}**. For decades,
Peabody Western Coal Corporation mined coal on the Hopi/Navajo land at
Black Mesa in ways that contaminated the air and drained vast amounts of
water from the region. The fight against Black Mesa was a totemic
struggle for indigenous sovereignty and environmental justice; in 2005,
the mines were shut down, and the issue disappeared from the
conversation. It was also a case of tenacious activism from within and
good allies from without, prolonged lawsuits, and perseverance. We need
litanies or recitations or monuments to these victories, so that they
are landmarks in everyone's mind. More broadly, shifts in, say, the
status of women are easily overlooked by people who don't remember that,
a few decades ago, reproductive rights were not yet a concept, and there
was no recourse for exclusion, discrimination, workplace sexual
harassment, most forms of rape, and other crimes against women the legal
system did not recognize or even countenanced. None of the changes were
inevitable, either---people fought for them and won them. People adjust
without assessing the changes. **[As of 2014, Iowa gets 28 percent of
its electricity from wind alone, not because someone in that
conservative state declared death to all fossil fuel corporations or
overthrew anyone or anything, but because it was a sensible and
affordable option.]{.underline}** **[Denmark, in the summer of 2015,
achieved 140 percent of its electricity needs through wind
generation]{.underline}** (and sold the surplus to neighboring
countries). Scotland has achieved renewable energy generation of 50
percent and set a goal of 100 percent by 2020. **[Thirty percent more
solar was installed in 2014 than the year before in the United States,
and renewables are becoming more affordable
worldwid]{.underline}**e---in some places they are already cheaper than
fossil-fueled energy. **[These incremental changes have happened
quietly, and many people don't know they have begun, let alone
exploded]{.underline}**. **[If there is one thing we can draw from where
we are now and where we were then, it is that the unimaginable is
ordinary, that the way forward is almost never a straight line you can
glance down but a convoluted path of surprises, gifts, and afflictions
you prepare for by accepting your blind spots as well as your
intuitions]{.underline}**. Howard Zinn wrote in 1988, in what now seems
like a lost world before so many political upheavals and technological
changes arrived, "As this century draws to a close, a century packed
with history, what leaps out from that history is its utter
unpredictability." He was, back then, wondering at the distance we'd
traveled from when the Democratic National Party Convention refused way
don't remember raids on gay bars when being queer was illegal or rivers
that caught fire when unregulated pollution peaked in the 1960s or that
there were, worldwide, 70 percent more seabirds a few decades ago and,
before the economic shifts of the Reagan Revolution, very, very few
homeless people in the United States. Thus, they don't recognize the
forces of change at work. One of the essential aspects of depression is
the sense that you will always be mired in this misery, that nothing can
or will change. It's what makes suicide so seductive as the only visible
exit from the prison of the present. There's a public equivalent to
private depression, a sense that the nation or the society rather than
the individual is stuck. Things don't always change for the better, but
they change, and we can play a role in that change if we act. Which is
where hope comes in, and memory, the collective memory we call history.
The other affliction amnesia brings is a lack of examples of positive
change, of popular power, evidence that we can do it and have done it.
George Orwell wrote, "Who controls the past controls the future. Who
controls the present controls the past." Controlling the past begins by
knowing it; the stories we tell about who we were and what we did shape
what we can and will do. Despair is also often premature: it's a form of
impatience as well as of certainty. My favorite comment about political
change comes from Zhou Enlai, a high-ranking member of Chairman Mao's
government. Asked, in the early 1970s, about his opinion of the French
Revolution, he answered, "Too soon to tell." Some argue that he was
talking about the insurrections of 1968, not the monarchy-toppling of
1789, but even then it demonstrates a generous and expansive
perspective. To retain a sense that even four years later the verdict
isn't in is to live with more open-minded uncertainty than most people
now can tolerate. News cycles tend to suggest that change happens in
small, sudden bursts or not at all. As I write, the military men who
probably murdered Chilean singer and political activist Victor Jara in
1973 are being charged. More than forty years have gone by; some stories
take far longer than that to finish. The struggle to get women the vote
took nearly threequarters of a century. For a time people liked to
announce that feminism had failed, as though the project of overturning
millennia of social arrangements should achieve its final victories in a
few decades, or as though it had stopped. Feminism is just starting, and
its manifestations matter in rural Himalayan villages, not just
first-world cities. Susan Griffin, a great writer in the present who was
also an important part of 1970s feminism, recently remarked, "I've seen
enough change in my lifetime to know that despair is not only
selfdefeating, it is unrealistic." Other changes result in victories and
are then forgotten. For decades, radicals were preoccupied with East
Timor, brutally occupied by Indonesia from 1975 to 2002; the

[Ironically]{.underline}, however twisted a standard of measure,
[[we]{.mark} might [gauge **how far we've come** by]{.mark} the degree
of **[doubt]{.mark}** expressible [toward]{.mark} the]{.underline}
**[[efficacy of]{.mark} voter registration]{.underline}** [and
**[electoral politics]{.mark}**, as have a couple of my fellow writers
in this issue]{.underline}. Even though [[I regard this]{.mark}
argumentative **[posture]{.mark}**]{.underline} [[as a **strategic
error** of]{.mark} **near-[fatal proportions]{.mark}**]{.underline}, I
think I understand how we got here: basically, there are two related,
but contrastive, founding propositions on black life and thought in
modernity that critics have consistently elaborated since "time
immemorial," and by that, I mean the time that the student of history
marks down as the beginning of her sense of crisis that initiates
"blackness" in the Western context; as I understand it, [Afrocentric
views, for instance, elide "blackness" and Africanity which concept is
driven back into the ancient world so that transatlantic
slavery---relatively recent in light of an ancient human past---is not
the origin---or more precisely, the prime time--- of black personality's
historical **identity**, but, rather, an **interruption of
it**]{.underline}. [The **diasporic**, or]{.underline} (for lack of a
better word) [creolized reading of blackness lends weight to the term
itself, insofar as blackness on this view defines a new historical
apprenticeship]{.underline}, kin to Africanness, [but distinct from it
in its particular and stressful formation, instaurated by the
trade]{.underline}. [One "**becomes" black**]{.underline} --neither a
phylogeny nor an ontogeny---[by virtue of his/her **interpellation** in
total **Western Economy**]{.underline}. [These portions of discursive
content imply discrete spatiotemporal registers, as the putative
subjects of each overlap, but are not entirely conformable]{.underline}
(even if they look exactly alike), [and **there's the
rub.**]{.underline} In the former instance, [one discovers as **many
occasions** as possible to establish and sustain **symbolic
contact**]{.underline} [with an imagined past, long receded, so that
emphasis comes to rest on the power and porosity of myth and its
ceremonial/ritualistic determinations wherever possible]{.underline}.
Whether [the Afrocentric sense eventuates in a vision of strategic
movement]{.underline} toward a putative origin (as in "return"
narratives/actualities of black politics of the Nineteenth and Twentieth
Centuries), or of ideological movement toward it ("ancestral"
ceremonies, ritual celebrations), [this reading seems to engender a
politics that is cultural, that looks
"**otherworldly**]{.underline}"---[the place of the
**ego-ideal**]{.underline}---in its valorized reference to an imagined
ancestral field. [We would anticipate that **electoral politics** in its
**uninspirational mundaneness**]{.underline} [might actually be
**beneath it.**]{.underline} [In the latter instance, focus comes to
rest on the **conditions**]{.underline} [that make]{.underline}
**[blackness possible]{.underline}** in the first place and what several
diasporic thinkers, Frantz **[Fanon]{.underline}**, [prominent among
them, describe as "**disalienation**]{.underline}," or [the process of
undoing the deleterious effects of slavery and colonization; because the
diasporic view installs the latter as efficient cause of historic black
movement]{.underline}, its political projects are charged with a sense
of urgency as they resonate the era of their appearance with
unmistakable identitarian markings. David Walker's, Anna Julia Cooper's,
and W.E.B.Du Bois's respective discourse, for example, could never be
mistaken for a different time/cultural period, which means that such
discourses are organically linked to their own "now." [Consequently, the
political protocols of a [diasporic commitment]{.mark} tend to reflect
the sense of **crisis** that [characterizes blackness as an emergent
category of **human possibility**]{.mark}]{.underline}[.]{.mark}
[Because blackness in the diasporic reading runs parallel to modernity,
blackness is cut away from the idea of Africa]{.underline}---perhaps we
could say more precisely that the idea of Africa is bracketed in this
ideological outline, rather than jettisoned as it might have been a
century ago---as [the idea of blackness itself assumes the name of a
virtually **absolute origin**]{.underline}. If we think of these
concurrent strands of ideas as postures, then we realize the extent to
which they determine not only how one stands, but where, as well as why.
This enormous conceptual legacy, one way or another, accounts, I
believe, for [the lion's share of **African-American theoretical
production**]{.underline} [and might be said to proffer a rich example
of the problem of **being/becoming** and **time**]{.underline}. In its
impressive variations and combinations, [recombinations and iterations,
black theory-making has engendered its fullest efflorescence in my view
in the post-sixties period with regard to both thematic variedness and
complexity and the democratic and demographic distribution of its
practitioners; it is also true that any one of these postures and/or
variations on it might evince at any given moment a kind of intellectual
sclerosis which would induce in turn a conservative
politics]{.underline}. If, for example, [a theory governed by [a
**diasporic view**]{.mark} of black history from which to commence its
**narrative [reifies slavery]{.mark}**]{.underline} [[and]{.underline}
**[colonization]{.underline}** [as]{.underline}
**[inherent]{.underline}** ]{.mark}[**properties in a subject**, then
[the]{.mark} theoretical [posture]{.mark} [no longer serves as]{.mark}
an **intellectual technology**]{.underline}, [or a **[heuristic]{.mark}
device**]{.underline}, [[but, rather]{.mark}, comes [to advance]{.mark}
an **[ontological valence]{.mark}**]{.underline}. In my own work, for
instance, I attempt to advance a theory of flesh/body as a strategy to
differentiate historical positionalities in confrontation with the
modern world. But [if this idea has any usefulness, it proposes the
theory as an opening into a closure; a **torque** that **kicks off
movement** or rotation in static properties]{.underline}. But
[[I]{.mark} should [hope not to lose sight of the **human
potential**]{.mark}]{.underline} [that [the subject of the **flesh
embodies**]{.mark}; perhaps another way to say this is that the
enfleshed subject inscribes an **opening** in [a **chain of necessity**
rather than a **last word**]{.mark}.]{.underline} The theory does not
exhaust the subject that it would address, but attempts to highlight it.
[[To hold to the view]{.mark} that [the]{.mark} enfleshed [subject is
**actually chattel or property**]{.mark}]{.underline}---which we cannot
say, insofar as we have merely established a subject possibility in this
case---[**[defeats the purpose]{.mark}** of discriminating in the first
place between a conceptual device on the one hand and a speaking (even
if barred) subject on the other]{.underline}. I have taken, then, the
long way around in order to say that [[the ballot does not **lose
efficacy**]{.underline} [when it is wielded by **black
personality**]{.underline}]{.mark} [[because the latter was once]{.mark}
**defined as**]{.underline} anomie, as
**[[chattel]{.underline}]{.mark}**. In other words, [[to premise the
**future of blackness** **on its past**]{.underline}
[is]{.underline}]{.mark} [to be mired in
**[timelessness]{.mark}**]{.underline}, which is precisely to be bereft
of historicity, of differentiation, of progression. But moreover, [[it

in discourse, [[with an **actual narrative** that will always **exceed
it.**]{.underline}]{.mark} [To **disparage the black vote** is not a
**sophisticated**]{.underline}, [or radical, response to anything, but
**reverberates** instead, without meaning to, we might suppose, a
**long-standing hatred of black people and their

**this election season**]{.underline}, [in light of what we face
now]{.underline} [**is beyond criticism**: it is quite simply to
**embrace the inevitability of violence**, and one should avoid
flirtation with violence unless she is willing to **put herself in its

faith]{.mark}**]{.underline}[;]{.mark} I would go so far as to say that
[the **failure to cast a vote at the coming midterms**]{.underline}
[is]{.underline} [an **immoral act** for at least two reasons that might
go without saying, but bear repeating nonetheless: the **meaning** of
**suffrage** for generations of African-Americans and the suffering that
it has exacted over the decades and the **certain danger** that the
current **presidency and** a treasonous, complicit **Republican**
congressional **majority pose** to the United States and the
world]{.underline}. [**Do we need to count the ways** that we are
**doubtless threatened**?]{.underline} When I was a child, I not only
spoke as one, but imagined like a child, too---a sauce pan, for
instance, turned upside down made a really great hat---shining and
irrepressible, cocked upside the head to the left, or the right;
fabulous for a stately procession; the family's beautiful mahogany
console housed a radio with a green light in it, and if you squeezed
yourself behind the device and examined the exposed radio tubes in it,
you watched as they were suddenly dissolved in your mind's eye into the
skyline of a good-size city that you were taking in from a bird's
eye-view; if you stood a mop head up and drew a face on its handle, you
had a pretty good doll for a day, especially if your father, or a
sibling, whittled down the handle. In this world of discovery and
surprise and everyday objects charged with magic, a word like "treason"
signaled a remoteness light years away; in fact, it was a "school" word
about as close to a little four- to seven -year old black girl's reality
as eighteenth-century images of white guys in tri-cornered hats,
crossing the Delaware (wherever that was!), except that one of them was
oddly named "Benedict Arnold," who was not a very nice guy, we were
told, and nowhere near "George Washington," "who never told a lie."
Somebody cut down a cherry tree and, asked about it, 'fessed up. (Or was
that Abe Lincoln?) But this "treason" business started growing up, too,
not unlike its young host body, as its next iteration was closer in both
time and space to that of the school children---it was the Civil War and
"seceding" states from the "Union." Why would "they," including the
state where our young lady lived then and now, do that? Ah! And she
learns that "history hurts." And at that precise moment, one put away
childish things, even though Emmett Till, my contemporary, was child
enough. One day, long after, the end of a line in the presidential oath
of office caught my attention, in fact, it quite astonished me---to
defend the United States against "all enemies, foreign and domestic."
But [is it possible for the "enemy" to be domestic]{.underline}? And
what if it is? [I thought I'd never live to see the day when I would
have to ask myself that question and to wonder what the **citizen's
duty** might be in the realization that it is not only possible, but
under certain circumstances, as appears to be the case at present, quite
likely]{.underline}. And [here we are, faced with the actual possibility
now that the **long-deferred democracy**]{.underline} [we have labored
toward is poised to take a **blow** that]{.underline}
[could]{.underline} **[permanently end it.]{.underline}** **[If voting
could stave it off, who would refuse]{.underline}**? Hold that thought.

### AT: Reductionism 

#### we must focus our politics around challenging capitalism - it explains racism better than anti-blackness \[which proves their reductionism args are unfounded\]

**Taylor 11** (Keeanga-Yamahtta, assistant professor of African-American
Studies at Princeton University, "Race, Class And Marxism," 01-04-2011,
<http://socialistworker.org/2011/01/04/race-class-and-marxism)>

- The big block quote in the middle is an aff argument that the article
  says is wrong

FOR REVOLUTIONARY Marxists, [there is an inextricable link between
racism and capitalism]{.underline}. [Capitalism is dependant on racism
as both a source of profiteering, but more importantly as a means to
divide and rule.]{.underline} [Racism is necessary to drive a wedge
between workers who otherwise have everything in common and every reason
to ally and organize together, but who are perpetually driven apart to
the benefit of the ruling class.]{.underline}

Thus, **[any serious discussion about Black liberation has to take up
not only a critique of capitalism, but also a credible strategy for
ending it. For Marxists, that strategy hinges on the revolutionary
potential of a unified, multiracial and multi-ethnic working-class
upheaval against capitalism.]{.underline}**

Marxists believe that the potential for that kind of unity is dependant
on battles and struggles against racism today. Without a commitment by
revolutionary organizations in the here and now to the fight against
racism, working-class unity will never be achieved and the revolutionary
potential of the working class will never be realized.

Yet despite all the evidence of this commitment to fighting racism over
many decades, Marxism has been maligned as, at best, \"blind\" to
combating racism and, at worst, \"incapable\" of it. For example, in an
article published last summer, popular commentator and self-described
\"anti-racist\" Tim Wise summarized the critique of \"left activists\"
that he later defines as Marxists. He writes:

> \[L\]eft activists often marginalize people of color by operating from
> a framework of extreme class reductionism, which holds that the
> \"real\" issue is class, not race, that \"the only color that matters
> is green,\" and that issues like racism are mere \"identity
> politics,\" which should take a backseat to promoting class-based
> universalism and programs to help working people. This reductionism,
> by ignoring the way that even middle class and affluent people of
> color face racism and color-based discrimination (and by presuming
> that low-income folks of color and low-income whites are equally
> oppressed, despite a wealth of evidence to the contrary) reinforces
> white denial, privileges white perspectivism and dismisses the lived
> reality of people of color.
>
> Even more, as we\'ll see, it ignores perhaps the most important

> that the biggest reason why there is so little working-class
> consciousness and unity in the Untied States (and thus, why
> class-based programs to uplift all in need are so much weaker here

> Only by confronting that directly (rather than sidestepping it as

Here, [Wise **accuses Marxism of: \"extreme class reductionism**,\"
meaning that **Marxists allegedly think that class is more important
than race**; reducing struggles against racism to \"mere identity
politics\";]{.underline} and requiring that struggles against racism
should \"take a back seat\" to struggles over economic issues. Wise also
accuses so-called \"left activists\" of reinforcing \"white denial\" and
\"dismiss\[ing\] the lived reality of people of color\"\--which, of
course, presumes Left activists and Marxists to all be white.

What do Marxists actually say?

[Marxists argue that capitalism is a system that is based on the
exploitation of the many by the few]{.underline}. Because it is a system
based on gross inequality[, it requires various tools to divide the
majority\--racism and all oppressions under capitalism serve this
purpose]{.underline}. Moreover, oppression is used to justify and
\"explain\" unequal relationships in society that enrich the minority
that live off the majority\'s labor. Thus, [racism developed initially
to explain and justify the enslavement of Africans\--because they were
less than human and undeserving of liberty and freedom.]{.underline} As
Paul D\'Amato wrote:

**[Everyone accepts the idea that the oppression of slaves was rooted in
the class relations of exploitation under that system]{.underline}**.
Fewer recognize that [under capitalism, wage slavery is the pivot around
which all other inequalities and oppressions turn.]{.underline}
[Capitalism used racism to justify plunder, conquest and slavery, but as
Karl Marx pointed out, it also used racism to divide and rule\--to pit
one section of the working class against another and thereby blunt class
consciousness]{.underline}.

**[To claim, as Marxists do, that racism is a product of capitalism is
not to deny or diminish its importance or impact in American society. It
is simply to explain its origins and the reasons for its
perpetuation.]{.underline}** Many on the left today talk about class as
if it is one of many oppressions, often describing it as \"classism.\"
What people are really referring to as \"classism\" is elitism or
snobbery, and not the fundamental organization of society under
capitalism.

Moreover, it is popular today to talk about various oppressions,
including class, as intersecting. [**While it is true that oppressions
can reinforce and compound each other, they are born out of the material
relations shaped by capitalism and the economic exploitation that is at
the heart of capitalist society.** In other words, it is the material
and economic structure of society that gave rise to a range of ideas and
ideologies to justify, explain and help perpetuate that order. In the
United States, racism is the most important of those
ideologies.]{.underline}

counter-revolution and counter-insurgency? This absence
[[affects]{.mark} the **shape** and **agenda** of the [critical analysis
of "anti-Black racism"]{.mark} in **essential ways**. Wilderson's
[critique of the "**ruse of analogy**"]{.mark}]{.underline} in Red,
White & Black [becomes a refrain that **[naturalizes]{.mark} academic
approaches** to politics now **institutionalized** with the **continued
reign of [Western]{.mark} bourgeois [liberalism]{.mark}**. [For]{.mark}
older and enduring [Black radical perspectives]{.mark}, the existence of
["anti-Black racism" among non-Black peoples]{.mark}, organizations, and
movements is neither a **new** nor **shocking phenomenon**. For many
Black revolutionary movement logics]{.underline} of the '60s and '70s,
for instance, [this **[did not preclude alliance]{.mark}** (or the
**exhaustion of alliances made**) [or lead to a **doctrinaire
rejection** of "**solidarity**]{.mark}" work and its international (or
"intercommunal") possibilities]{.underline}.27 ["[Contradictions" were
**expected**]{.mark}]{.underline}, so to speak, [in **theory** and
**practice**, which **might be resolved** or **not**, depending on
**material interest**, **circumstance**, etc]{.underline}. For them,
[[this]{.mark} work [was]{.mark} **not [about]{.mark} gauging
identity**, or the **perfection of a projected analogy**, but
[**mobilization** for the **political accomplishments of

not work toward the development of a new humanism not white or racist or
anti-Black after all. [The reach for potential [solidarities was **not

[[Even]{.mark} solidarity [work with **obviously problematic**]{.mark},

[without]{.mark} seeing the relationship as [a **statement of some total

notion of solidarity has]{.mark} nowadays [been
**superficialized**]{.mark}, remaining riveted on **mere rhetorical
proclamation** and aesthetic or representational
identification]{.underline} in neo-colonial culture industries here and
there. [[An **older**, **praxical approach**]{.mark} to alliance,
perhaps "analogy," and solidarity [is not taken up]{.mark} by current
analyses of identity conflicts that prevail with the resurgence of a
more academic political-intellectualism and a now much less contested
liberalism. This is imperial "multiculturalism" and its malcontents. As
much as [Afro-pessimism]{.mark}]{.underline} (2.0) [may object to
**certain instances of liberalism**]{.underline}, or regulation white
racist liberalism at least, [it **[assumes]{.mark} these [Western
epistemic frameworks]{.mark}** of white academic liberalism all the
same, thereby **[ensconcing]{.mark} the [colonialism]{.mark}** and
**neo-colonialism it constantly** and **symptomatically denegates** in
text after text]{.underline}. Black anti-colonialism / anti-colonialist
Blackness The great anti-colonialist poet of Négritude, Aimé Césaire
wrote famously in his letter of resignation from the French Communist
Party that he wanted Marxism and communism to be placed in the service
of Black peoples and not Black peoples in the service of Marxism or
communism. He maintained in 1956: "it is clear that our struggle---the
struggle of colonial peoples against colonialism, the struggle of
peoples of color against racism---is more complex, or better yet, of a
completely different nature than the fight of the French worker against
French capitalism, and it cannot in any way be considered a part, a
fragment, of that struggle." 28 As always, he was writing on behalf of
Black people who were, proverbially, the only people on the planet who
have been excluded from the "human race" by the "modern" history of
Western racism and colonialism which obstructs "a true humanism---a
humanism made to the measure of the world."29 What is this Négritude if
not Blackness, Black anti-colonialism, or anti-colonial Blackness? This
tradition is not a tradition in [Wilderson]{.underline} who [regularly
critiques]{.underline} the **[analogical arrogance]{.underline}** of
Marxism, feminism, and an academic paradigm of "post-colonialism" with
less common reference to "queer" or "gay and lesbian" categories of
analysis as well---all [in the name of [pessimism]{.mark}. For him, none
of these political frameworks with their privileged identarian subjects
can capture the condition of "**Blackness**" and
"**slavery**"]{.underline} (or "the Black/Slave"). [While that
perspective can allow for some insights]{.underline}---ones certainly
seen before around the Black world and ones certainly avoided by so much
institutional scholarship---[it [leaves the]{.mark} **general
categorical [grid]{.mark}** [of]{.mark} established [Western]{.mark}
political [epistemologies **intact**]{.mark}]{.underline}. The familiar
academic terrain of "race, gender, class, and sexuality" frames the
critique for "Blackness" of "gender, class, and sexuality" in addition
to "post-coloniality" or "post-colonialism." [The **most conventional US
academic [categories]{.mark}** [of identity]{.mark} and analysis
[are]{.mark} **still [rendered]{.mark} in full [as discrete]{.mark}**,
**monolithic**, and **monological [categories]{.mark}** and
**referents**]{.underline} (e.g., workers, women, etc.), like the
respective political ideologies based upon them in the traditional
ideological history of the white West (e.g., Marxism, feminism, etc.).
There are "workers" and then there are "women," generically, and then
sometimes there are "gays" by whatever name, not to mention "natives" or
the colonized in this culturally specific epistemology of a specific
culture of colonialism itself. [[The upshot is]{.mark} **quite
[conservative]{.mark}**, even **anachronistically so**. This critique is
an **internal** if **damning critique** embodying and encouraging
pessimism largely from **within the established order of knowledge**
that it analytically engages and **categorically replenishes** and
**preserves**]{.underline}. [The **grid politics** of Wilderson's
critique of "the ruse of analogy" leaves all manner of "Blackness" in a
**wasteland**. The routine categorical contrast with "Native Americans"
reduces all that and any colonial condition to a **startlingly
oversimplified matter** of "land"]{.underline} (or "land restoration");
[and it **occludes "Afro-Indian" history** as well as **"Red-Black"
maroonage all across the Americas**]{.underline}. The constant generic
contrast with "feminism" or "non-Black women" eclipses the more mammoth
criticism of "gender" writ large in Diop and Amadiume's Black-African
studies of Europe or "Western Civilization" as a "racial patriarchy" of
pessimism and "anti-Black" imperialism. The contrast with Marxism and
its "workers" never resurrects any issues of "class" or economics from
any other perspective to recognize or to resist, for example, the white
invention of Black elites as vital instruments of racism,
anti-Blackness, and white-supremacism. There never appears a trace of
any critique of Black "social class' (or political class) elitism in
"Afro-pessimism" (2.0), which is a tell-tale sign of petty-bourgeois or
"lumpen-bourgeois" articulations. Lastly, [[Wilderson's]{.mark}
occasional categorical [contrast of "**Blackness**" with
**Palestinians** or **al-Nakba**]{.mark}]{.underline} ([which **aligns
in Arabic** with the Swahili substitution for the term "**Middle
Passage**"]{.underline}---Maafa, the "Catastrophe") [[comprehends **no
Blackness in Palestine** or **among Palestinians**]{.mark}. His
Afro-pessimism can envision **no Afro-Palestinianism**, [unlike a
**great tradition of Pan-African discourses**]{.mark} that also **do not
dislocate Palestine** from an anti-colonialist mapping of the African
continent or the Afro-Asian landmass of a Pan-Africanist and "Bandung"
imagination, one [**powerfully shared by Malcolm X** and]{.mark} **Fayez
A. [Sayegh]{.mark}**. For "Black Power" internationally, **Kwame
[Ture]{.mark}** [would]{.mark} refer to Palestine as the "tip of Africa"
and [uphold]{.mark} **Fatima [Bernawi]{.mark}**, the iconic Black woman
who's been named the "first Palestinian female political prisoner," [as
the **paragon** of "Black and Palestinian
Revolutions]{.mark}."]{.underline}30 She is likewise canonized by other
[AfroPalestinian icons]{.underline} themselves, [such as **Ali Jiddeh**
and **Mahmoud Jiddeh**]{.underline} of the African community of the Old
City of Jerusalem, for example--- [or]{.underline}, say, [**Ahmad** and
**Jumaa Takrouri**]{.underline} of Occupied Jericho---who [are each
among the **greatest of all icons across Historic [Palestine]{.mark}**,
a country which [has produced **multiple Black Panther
formations**]{.mark} in Hebrew as well as Arabic]{.underline} in the
1970s and the 1980s. Again, [[Wilderson]{.mark} tacitly
"**[nationalizes]{.mark}**" his category of "[Blackness" although this
is **scarcely in the interests of Black people**]{.mark} in or [outside
of the US colonized mainland]{.mark} of Americanism; and so none of the
above "Blackness" **survives the critical grid** of a **very
Anglo-American** (and **white racist state-bound**) critique of
"analogy," regardless of the "Afro-pessimist" text at hand]{.underline}.
Do not the vulgar colonial-nativist politics of Incognegro's strangely
overlooked comment on "West Indians" go full blown then in Red, White &
Black and elsewhere?31 [[There is]{.mark} here a **general critical
[erasure]{.mark}** [of the **massive tradition of Black
anti-colonialism**]{.mark}---or **anti-colonial Black resistance** to
"anti-Blackness" and anti-Black colonialism, which **transcends
nationalization**. Wilderson's "[Afro-pessimist" **rejects the
anti-colonialist paradigms**]{.mark} of supposedly "other" peoples, and
yet [in a manner that **reinstates**]{.mark} **US** or **[Western
coloniality]{.mark} nonetheless**]{.underline}---a white colonialism
that oppresses "the Black" inside and outside the United States's
official geopolitical limits. [[This]{.mark} position [can]{.mark} thus
[**make a virtue out of automatic** and **absolute anti-alliance
postures with no further**, **actual political action then
required**]{.mark} for Black people, "the Black critic," or any Black
liberation struggle on this view. Such chauvinism without political
commitment or engagement beyond critique is logically consistent, for
pessimism, where **[mere resentment]{.mark}** or **ressentiment [can
masquerade as]{.mark} resistance** or "**[pro-Black]{.mark}**"
"**radicalism**." After all, Afro-pessimism]{.underline} (2.0)
[**begins** with a **proud suspicion of Black liberation**]{.underline}
or Black liberation movement, itself, [no less than of its potentially
"anti-racist" or "anti-Black" political alliances]{.underline}. This
provincial "American" pessimism reveals more affinities with Créolite in
the Caribbean than Césaire's anti-colonialist eruption of Pan-African
Négritude, in reality, its narrowly and negatively delimited rhetoric of
the "Blackness" of "the Black" (as "Slave," of course) notwithstanding.
As if this too is a virtue, [[pessimism is not just suspicious of power
but **possibility**]{.mark}---[while, **upholding dystopia**, it is
**casually dismissive of all historical actuality that does not support
a pessimist paradigm**,]{.mark} **orientation** or
**sensibility**]{.underline}. Analytically, moreover, [there is somehow
no white colonialism for Blacks to fight in Africa or Black countries of
Black people anywhere and no terrible landlessness that afflicts the
African diasporas of Blackness captive within white settler and/or
imperial state formations]{.underline}, for Wilderson and Afropessimism
(2.0).

### Alt---Reed

#### The alternative is vital to reforming the structures which produce racial disparity based on institutional transformation instead of an ahistorical analysis which sustains neoliberalism

**Reed**, A., **2018**. American professor of political science at the
University of Pennsylvania, specializing in race and American politics.
"Antiracism: a neoliberal alternative to a left." Dialectical
Anthropology, 42(2), pp.105-115.

[At a 1991]{.underline} conference at the Harvard Law School, where he
was a tenured full professor, [I heard the late, esteemed legal
theorist, Derrick Bell, declare]{.underline} on a panel [that blacks had
made no progress since 1865.]{.underline} I was startled not least
because Bell's own life, as well as the fact that Harvard's black law
students' organization put on the conference, so emphatically belied his
claim. I have since come to understand that [those who make such claims
experience no sense of contradiction because the contention that nothing
has changed is intended actually as an assertion that racism persists as
the most consequential force impeding black Americans'
aspirations]{.underline}, that no matter how successful or financially
secure individual black people become, they remain similarly subject to
victimization by racism. **[That assertion is not to be taken literally
as an empirical claim]{.underline}**, even though many advancing it seem
earnestly convinced that it is; [**it is rhetorical**. No]{.underline}
sane or at all [knowledgeable person can believe that black Americans
live under the same restricted and perilous conditions now as in 1865.
The claim therefore carries a silent preface:]{.underline}
["(this]{.underline} incident/phenomenon/[pattern makes it seem as
though) nothing has changed."]{.underline} It is more a jeremiad than an
analysis and is usually advanced in response to some outrage. As I have
pointed out elsewhere (Henwood 2013), for the claim to have the desired
rhetorical force, those making it must assume that things have changed
because the charge is fundamentally a denunciation of objectionable
conditions or incidents as atavistic and a call for others to regard
them as such. Attempting to mobilize outrage about some action or
expression through associating it with discredited and vilified views or
practices is a common gambit in hortatory political rhetoric, more or
less effective for a rally or leaflet. But [**this [antiracist politics
is ineffective]{.mark}** []{.mark}and even destructive **[when it takes
the place of]{.mark}** scholarly interpretation or [**strategic
political analysis.** New Orleans]{.mark} provides a useful illustration
of the limitations of contemporary antiracism as a politics. Antiracist
political critique [failed abysmally after Katrina to
mobilize]{.mark}]{.underline} []{.mark}significant [[opposition to
elimination of]{.mark} low-income [public housing]{.mark}
or]{.underline} to the ongoing [destruction of public schools. That
politics]{.underline}, [which posits an]{.underline} [**abstract "black
community**" against an equally abstract "racism,"]{.underline}
**[[could not provide persuasive responses to the]{.mark} blend of
[underclass ideology that stigmatizes public housing
]{.mark}]{.underline}**as an incubator of a degraded population (Reed
2016a, b: 264--269). Nevertheless, [race-reductionist argument continues
to dominate the political imagination of those who would challenge
structures of inequality. It has remained]{.underline}, without critical
reflection or strategic reassessment, [the default stance
of]{.underline} putatively insurgent or [oppositional black
politics]{.underline} in the city and was most recently on display in a
controversy over removal of monuments erected in the late nineteenth and
early twentieth centuries to celebrate the Confederacy and white. In the
spring of 2017, the City, at the mayor's initiative and with support of
six of the seven council members, removed from public display four
odious monuments to the treasonous Confederate insurrection that had
been a nasty affront to egalitarian values for more than a century (Reed
2017b).1 Mayor Mitch Landrieu announced his intention to remove them
after South Carolina Governor Nikki Haley took down the Confederate
battle flag from the statehouse grounds, where its presence had been the
source of long-standing controversy, in the wake of Dylan Roof's
racially inspired murder of parishioners at a black Charleston church.
Activists linked to Black Lives Matter and the Black Youth Project 100
(BYP100), a group organized through the Center for the Study of Race,
Politics and Culture at the University of Chicago, created an ad hoc
alliance, Take 'Em Down NOLA, to agitate for removal not only of the
four monuments but of "all the public symbols -- monuments, school
names, and street signs dedicated to white supremacists" (Reed 2017c;
Black Youth Projectx; Bentley 2015). The city is certainly a better
place for being rid of those monuments, and having removed them from
public display could be a step toward finally defeating the Lost
Cause/Heritage ideology that remains too useful a tool of the right for
making class power invisible in both the past and the present. But,
while the group's efforts contributed appreciably to pressing the issue
and mobilizing some public support for removal, Take 'Em Down NOLA's
campaign also obscured class power, ironically in the same way as did
the fin-de-siècle ruling class that erected the monuments. For Take 'Em
Down NOLA and other antiracist activists, the monuments' significance is
allegorical; they are icons representing an abstract, ultimately
ontological white supremacy that drives and reproduces racial inequality
in the present as in the past. The monuments, that is, are props in the
broader race-reductionist discourse that also analogizes contemporary
inequality to Jim Crow or slavery. Instructively, Take 'Em Down NOLA's
goal is not simply to remove every vestige of commemoration, no matter
how obscure or trivial, of any historical figure associated with the
Confederate insurrection or slavery. Despite their hyperbolic contention
that the monuments inflict daily injury on and "psychologically
terrorize" black New Orleanians (Smith 2017; Take 'Em Down NOLA), Take
'Em Down NOLA's agitation for removal is the instrument of a more
evanescent project. Their goal, as poet and Harvard graduate student
Clint Smith described it in a New Republic puff piece, is "an ongoing
attempt to foster an honest reckoning with the past." As to what that
honest reckoning might look like or produce, neither he nor they have
much concrete to say. "Entirely erasing tributes to the confederacy from
New Orleans might never happen," Smith allows, "but the work of Take 'Em
Down NOLA forces us to consider what it might say about us if we did --
and what it says about the fact that we have not yet done so" (Smith
2017). That is, the group's agitation is driven more by demanding that
"racism" be recognized as the source of inequality than by pursuing
specific policy goals. [This is a feature of contemporary antiracist
discourse generally. [Antiracist]{.mark}]{.underline} activism and
[[scholarship proceed from the view that statistical disparities in the
distribution by race of goods]{.mark} and bads in the society in which
blacks appear worse off categorically]{.underline} **[(e.g., less
wealth, higher rates of unemployment, greater incidence
of]{.underline}** hypertensive and **[cardiovascular
disease)]{.underline}** [[amount to evidence that "race" remains
fundamentally determinative]{.mark} of black Americans'
lives]{.underline}. As Merlin Chowkwanyun and I argue, [**[however,
disparity is an outcome, not an explanation]{.underline}**, [and
deducing cause]{.underline}]{.mark} simplistically [[from
outcome]{.underline}]{.mark} (e.g., treating racially disparate outcomes
as ipso facto evidence of racially invidious causation) [seems
sufficient only if one has already stacked the interpretive deck in
favor of a particular causal account]{.underline} (Reed and Chowkwanyun
2012, 167--168). We also discuss a garbage in, garbage out effect in
studies that rely on large-scale aggregate data analysis; gross
[categories like race]{.underline} may [[mask significant micro-level
dynamics that]{.mark} could [present more]{.mark} complex and [nuanced
understandings of causality]{.mark}.]{.underline} Put another way, [if
you go out looking for racial effects in data sets that are organized by
race as]{.underline} gross [categories, you will be likely to find them,
but that will not necessarily lead to sound interpretations of the
factors that actually produce the inequalities. As likely as not
that]{.underline} purblind [approach [**can lead to missing**]{.mark}
"the extent to which particular inequalities **[that]{.mark}** appear
statistically as '**[racial' disparities are]{.mark} in fact [embedded
in multiple social relations]{.mark}**]{.underline}" (Reed and
Chowkwanyun 2012, 150--151, 158--159). This issue is not a concern for
antiracist politics because its fundamental goal is propagation of the
view that inequalities or injustices suffered by black Americans should
be understood as resulting from generic white racism. Its objective,
that is, is rhetorical and ideological, not political and programmatic.
[Antiracist discourse [posits White
Supremacy]{.mark}]{.underline}/racism [[as a totalizing
phenomenon]{.underline}]{.mark}, a force **[[impervious to changing
institutional circumstances]{.mark}---a primordial foundation of
being]{.underline}**, just as the White League contended in the last
quarter of the nineteenth century. The thrust of the Take 'Em Down NOLA
argument, for example, is that: (1) the monuments were erected to
celebrate white supremacist power, which was the foundation of slavery,
lynching and brutalization of black New Orleanians, disfranchisement,
imposition of Jim Crow, and denial of blacks' basic civil rights. (2)
The fact that they remain on display in the present underscores the
continuity of White Supremacy's power. (3) That continuity indicates
that, as in the past, contemporary racial inequalities most meaningfully
result from white supremacy, which therefore must be the primary target
of struggles for social and racial justice. But [adducing a causal
dynamic that underlay a political conjuncture in the past to support a
claim about causality in the present presumes that the same dynamics
operated in the past and present.]{.underline} That is,
[**[the]{.mark}** race-reductionist **[formulation advanced to validate
the claim of white supremacy's overarching power presumes what it needs
to demonstrate]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Sociologist Mara Loveman follows
Rogers Brubaker, Pierre Bourdieu, and others in arguing that this
interpretive problem and the confusions that generate it can be
addressed by "abandoning 'race' as a category of analysis to gain
analytical leverage to study 'race' as a category of practice" (Loveman
1999, 895--896; Brubaker and Cooper 2000; Bourdieu 1991). She embraces
historian Barbara J. Fields's assessment that ["attempts to explain
'racial phenomena' in terms of 'race' are no more than definitional
statements"]{.underline} and argues that "Rejection of 'race' as an
analytical concept facilitates analysis of the historical construction
of 'race' as a practical category without reification, and thus provides
a degree of analytical leverage that tends to be foreclosed when race is
used analytically" (Loveman 1999, 895--896; Fields 1990, 100). In the
current political context that [interpretive pathology is pernicious
politically because [**the claim of continuity demands ignoring
historical specificities** of both past and present **that are crucially
important** for making]{.mark} adequate [sense of either.]{.mark} The
point of [analogizing current conditions to slavery]{.mark}]{.underline}
[]{.mark}or earlier regimes of openly white supremacist hierarchy [is to
[subordinate consideration of]{.mark} the]{.underline} discrete,
[[complex mechanisms through which contemporary inequalities are
reproduced]{.mark} in quotidian life to the meta-historical contention
that generic white supremacy, or racism, most significantly explains
disadvantages and injustices that black Americans suffer today. But
even]{.underline} in the nineteenth century, [at the nadir of the defeat
of Reconstruction and imposition of]{.underline} disfranchisement and
the [Jim Crow]{.underline} order, **[black politics was
not]{.underline}** adequately [**reducible to a unitary struggle against
white supremacy**; differences of perspective, agendas, and programs
pertained among blacks and determined strategic directions, including
pursuit of allies]{.underline} (Stein 1974). In addressing another
racially charged issue---how we should regard Rachel Dolezal's embrace
of a transracial identity in relation to Caitlyn Jenner's embrace of a
transgender one---historian Susan Stryker neatly describes the appeal
and limitations of argument by analogy: [**[Analogy is a weak form of
analysis]{.mark}**, in which a better-known case is compared to one that
is lesser known, and thereby offered as a model for understanding
something that is not yet well understood...Analogy's rhetorical
strength is]{.underline} to be found precisely in [its ability to
condense complicated forms of similarity into singularly powerful
linguistic gestures and acts of speech, while its analytical weakness
lies precisely in the non-identity of the things being
compared]{.underline} (Stryker 2015). [Even if we were to accept
"racism" as a label summarizing the various factors involved, noting
those]{.underline} apparent [similarities does not tell us how
inequalities are reproduced today and has nothing to say practically
about how to combat them. And it is important to interrogate why it is
paramount within the antiracist framework that we understand the present
through analogy to the past. [In the antiracist political project
**white supremacy**]{.mark}]{.underline}/racism [**[is]{.mark}**---like
"terrorism"---[**an amorphous, ideological abstraction**
]{.mark}]{.underline}whose specific content exists largely in the eyes
of the beholder. [Therefore, like antiterrorism, antiracism's [targets
can be]{.mark} porous and [entirely arbitrary;]{.mark} this means
that]{.underline}, also [like antiterrorism, [the struggle can never be
won]{.mark}.]{.underline} Clint Smith's romantic assessment of Take 'Em
Down NOLA's contribution indicates as much and makes clear, as does
everything that Ta-Nehisi Coates has ever written (e.g., Coates 2014,
2016a, b, 2017), that winning anything concrete is not the point.
[**[The "politics" that follows]{.mark} from this view** centers on
pursuit of]{.underline} recognition and [representation on groupist
terms---both as symbolic depiction in the public realm and as claims to
articulate the]{.underline} interests, perspectives, or "[voices" of a
generic black constituency]{.underline} or some subset thereof, e.g.,
"youth" or "grassroots." **[It [is not interested in]{.mark} broadly
[egalitarian redistribution]{.mark}]{.underline}**. Notwithstanding its
performative evocations of the 1960s Black Power populist "militancy,"
[this antiracist politics is [neither leftist]{.mark}]{.underline} [in
itself [nor]{.mark} particularly [compatible with a left
politics]{.mark} as conventionally understood. At this political
juncture, [it is]{.mark},]{.underline} like bourgeois feminism and other
groupist tendencies, [an oppositional epicycle within hegemonic
neoliberalism]{.underline}, one might say [[a component of
neoliberalism's critical self-consciousness**;** ]{.mark}**it is
[thus]{.mark} in fact [fundamentally anti-leftist]{.mark}**[. Black
political elites' attacks on]{.mark} the]{.underline} Bernie [Sanders
2016 presidential]{.underline} nomination [campaign's [call for
decommodified public]{.mark} higher education [as
frivolous]{.mark}]{.underline}[,]{.mark} irresponsible, or even
un-American [[underscores how]{.mark} deeply [embedded this politics is
within neoliberalism]{.mark}]{.underline} (Richardson 2016; Sheinin
2016; Johnson 2016). During the campaign, antiracist activists and
commentators routinely attacked Sanders for being inattentive to black
concerns, which they insisted are separate from political economy and
capitalist class dynamics and reduced to pro forma rehearsal of slogans
like "black lives matter" and denunciation of an abstract "systemic
racism." [[After the 2016 election, antiracist hostility toward]{.mark}
[efforts to]{.mark} generate [broadly working class-based]{.mark},
social-democratic [alternatives to]{.mark} Democratic
[neoliberalism]{.mark},]{.underline} if anything, [[intensified.]{.mark}
Coates]{.underline} (2017), for example, [denounces as white supremacist
any suggestions that working-class whites' votes for Trump stem from
anything other than commitment to white supremacy.]{.underline} Social
scientists and other public opinion experts have provided steady grist
for antiracist and other identitiarian ideologues' incessant rehearsal
of the trope of a hopelessly backward, racist, sexist, homophobic, and
xenophobic white working class as the main danger to progress in the
society. In this insistence, [they join]{.underline} Clintonoid
[neoliberal Democrats of all races, genders, and sexual orientations who
reject downwardly redistributive politics for more openly class-based
reasons]{.underline}. Thus, as Mark Dudzic points out in a superb essay
originally written before the election: Joan Walsh, among many others,
opined that Sanders' substantial support among white workers (who
overwhelmingly supported Clinton in 2008) is because "she has been
damaged by her association with the first black president." And Paul
Krugman, that eternal guardian of the left gate of the ruling class,
pontificated that the Sanders campaign failed to understand the
importance of "horizontal inequality" between groups (Dudzic 2017).
Dudzic's assessment of liberals' reaction to the social-democratic
enthusiasm Sanders sparked applies equally to antiracist activists and
commentators: [The Sanders campaign was]{.underline} so [disorienting to
both conservatives and liberals because it did not embrace]{.underline}
these [naturalized categories \[racism and sexism\] but, instead,
revealed them as social relationships established by real human beings
and, thus, open to change through the application of political and
economic policies.]{.underline} [After stumbling a bit]{.underline} in
the early months [around how to give voice to the outrages of police
violence and mass incarceration, it laid out **a working class politics
of hope**]{.underline} [that was both visionary and practical. In the
process, it helped lay bare the actual mechanisms of capitalism that
drive inequality. And it exposed the fault lines created by decades of
neoliberalism that are impeding real change in the labor, racial justice
and other social movements]{.underline} (Dudzic 2017). Although its
attraction to Black Power "militancy" suggests insurgent racial
populism, [the current [race-reductionist politics centers on]{.mark}
exposé and demands for recognition, not egalitarian redistribution.
**Its project is [elimination of disparities within a regime of
intensifying economic inequality]{.mark}**, which antiracism takes as
given.]{.underline} As Warren et al. put it: **[antiracists...remain
attuned to [a vision of justice defined by ensuring equal access to
hierarchically distributed social goods]{.mark}]{.underline}** such as
family wealth (and redressing historical impediments to the accumulation
of wealth rooted in discrimination). Indeed in making frequent recourse
to the adjective "narrow" in chastising a politics that roots inequality
in economic exploitation, antiracists and identitarians have positioned
the idea of racial justice as a critique of, rather than an expected
consequence of, socialism. It is largely for this reason that, as Walter
Benn Michaels has noted...'the commitment to identity politics has been
more an expression of...enthusiasm for the free market than a form of
resistance to it (Warren et al. 2016.). [**Even when its proponents
believe themselves to be radicals, [this]{.mark} antiracist politics [is
a]{.mark} professional-[managerial class politics]{.mark}**. Its
adherents are not concerned with trying to generate the large, broad
political base needed to pursue a transformative agenda because they are
committed fundamentally to pursuit of racial parity within
neoliberalism, not social transformation.]{.underline} In fact,
antiracist activists' and pundits' insistence during the 2016 election
campaign that Bernie Sanders did not address black concerns made that
point very clearly because every nearly item on the Sanders campaign's
policy agenda---from the Robin Hood tax on billionaires to free public
higher education to the \$15/h minimum wage, a single-payer health care
system, etc. (Sanders for President)---would disproportionately benefit
black and Hispanic populations that are disproportionately working
class. Most of all, **[[the gains that black Americans have won have
been the product of]{.mark} alliances condensed around [broad
egalitarian agendas]{.mark}]{.underline}**[.]{.mark} Historian Touré F.
Reed notes: [[Emancipation and]{.underline}]{.mark} even
[[Reconstruction were produced by a convergence of interests]{.mark}
among disparate constituencies]{.underline}---African Americans,
abolitionists, business, small freeholders, and northern laborers---
[[united under the banner of free labor]{.mark}. The [civil
rights]{.mark} movement [was the product of a consensus created by the
New Deal that presumed]{.mark} the appropriateness of [government
intervention in private affairs for the public good]{.mark}, the broad
repudiation of scientific racism following World War II, and the
political vulnerabilities Jim Crow created for the United States during
the Cold War. To be sure, **[Reconstruction, the New Deal, the War on
Poverty, and]{.mark}** even the **[civil rights]{.mark}** movement
**[failed to redress all of the challenges confronting blacks. But the
limitations of each]{.mark}** of these movements **[reflected political
constraints imposed on them]{.mark}**, in large part, **[by
capital]{.mark}**]{.underline} (Reed 2018). [As A. Philip Randolph,
Bayard Rustin, Martin Luther King, Jr., and two generations of
[labor-oriented black activists]{.mark}]{.underline}---including the
entire spectrum of radical to conservative black civic elites and trade
union leaders collected in historian Rayford Logan's 1944 volume, What
the Negro Wants---[[understood]{.underline}]{.mark}, first, **[[the
exploitation and oppression of black Americans]{.mark} was [linked to
more general dynamics of exploitation]{.mark}]{.underline}** and
oppression [**[and]{.underline}**,]{.mark} second, **[[the only way to
attain and]{.underline}]{.mark}** especially to **[[secure benefits for
black Americans is to win them for everyone]{.mark}.]{.underline}**
[That lesson has been lost for]{.underline} many [antiracist activists
and commentators enamored with contemporary race reductionism; instead,
they channel the performative militance associated with Black Power
politics as the insurgent, racially authentic tendency in the late 1960s
and 1970s.]{.underline} Yet Black Power politics consolidated as a less
potentially transformative, class-skewed alternative to the
black-labor-left, social-democratic approach advocated by Rustin,
Randolph, and others (A. Philip Randolph Institute 1966; Randolph 2014a,
b; Rustin 1965, 1966; Reed 2015, 2016a, 2017a; Le Blanc and Yates 2013;
Logan 1944). [Black Power politics was fundamentally a petition
politics,]{.underline} albeit a loud and flamboyant one. For all their
overheated rhetoric about self-determination, including even in some
cases what now might be called cosplay fantasies of armed struggle,
Black Powerites generally [depended on ruling class largess for
realization of their programmatic objectives. That was their alternative
to trying to form broad, popular coalitions and to navigate the
compromises and constraints that sort of politics requires]{.underline}.
As a practical politics, Black Power was fundamentally directed toward
government institutions, private or philanthropic funding sources, and
other agencies capable of conferring or ratifying claims to represent a
generic "black community" (some referred to the style at the time as
"militant begging"; I suppose today it could be considered an
institutional species of aggressive panhandling.) Contemporaneous
critics like Harold Cruse (1968, 193--260) and Robert L. Allen (1969)
pointed out the Black Power program's class character, and Rustin
presciently suggested that its most likely outcome would be "creation of
a new black establishment" (1966, 36) (emphasis in original). Black
Power, at least in the ethnic pluralist form in which it congealed as
"black politics," was at bottom a Bookerite politics of elite-brokerage,
as is the essence of ethnic pluralism. The core Bookerite project, under
the rubric of racial uplift or advancement, has always been---since
Washington and the stratum of black racial advocates that emerged from
the context of disfranchisement at the turn of the twentieth
century---"substitution of black professionals, managers, and
intellectuals for their white counterparts within those institutions
charged with administering to the needs of black populations." The
political goal, that is, was establishment of "managerial authority of
the nation's Negro problem" within whatever larger political and
economic order prevailed (Warren 2003, 27). Warren's critique, which he
elaborated further in What Was African American Literature (2012), sheds
light on contemporary antiracists' singular commitment to the
reductionist view that race/racism is the foundation and source of all
injustice and inequality affecting black Americans. It also thus helps
to make sense of the affective power that explaining current
inequalities through analogy to slavery or Jim Crow has in antiracist
discourse. **[[Antiracist politics is a class
politics]{.underline}]{.mark}**; [it is rooted in the social
position]{.underline} and [worldview, and material interests of the
stratum of race relations engineers and administrators who operate
in]{.underline} Democratic [party politics and as government
functionaries]{.underline}, the punditry and commentariat, education
administration and the professoriate, corporate, social service and
nonprofit sectors, and the multibillion-dollar diversity industry.
[[That]{.mark} stratum [comes together around a]{.mark} commonsense
[commitment to the centrality of race]{.mark}---and other categories of
ascriptive identity---as the appropriate discursive framework through
which to articulate norms of justice and injustice and through which to
formulate remedial responses.]{.underline} **[It has grown and become
deeply embedded institutionally throughout]{.underline}** the
**[society]{.underline}** as an entailment of the victories of the
1960s. As the society moves farther away from the regime of
subordination and exclusion on explicitly racial terms to which
race-reductionist explanations were an immediately plausible response,
race has become less potent as the dominant metaphor, or blanket
shorthand, through which class hierarchy is lived. And as [black and
white elites increasingly go through the same schools, live in the same
neighborhoods, operate as peers in integrated workplaces, share and
interact in the same social spaces and consumption practices and
preferences, they increasingly share another common sense not only about
frameworks of public policy but also about the proper order of things in
general. Those [quotidian realities put pressure on the reductionist
premise that racial subordination remains the dominant
ideological]{.mark}]{.underline} or material [[framework
generating]{.mark} and sustaining systemically reproduced [inequalities
and]{.mark} class power.]{.underline} This tension
**[[underlies]{.underline}]{.mark}** a source [**[the appeal of
ontological views of racism]{.mark} as an animate force that transcends
time and context**. Because it is an evanescent Evil that is
disconnected from specific]{.underline} human [purposes]{.underline} and
patterns of social relations, [racism]{.underline}, again like
"terrorism," [can exist anywhere at any time under any manifest
conditions and is a cause that needs no causes or
explanation]{.underline}. [That is why statistical demonstration of
apparent racial disparities seems]{.underline} within antiracist
discourse [to be self-sufficient evidence of the persistence of racism's
paramount impact on black Americans, despite the fact that findings of
disparity: (1) are not surprising considering how entrenched
inequalities work; (2) do not tell us much]{.underline}, if anything,
[about the proximate sources of the disparities; and (3) do not point to
remedial responses]{.underline}, although those retailing the findings
often present them as though they do. As Chowkwanyun and I indicate,
moreover, [[relentless commitment to]{.mark} finding disparities and
[insistence that manifest inequalities be understood in those terms
despite]{.mark} those [interpretive failings]{.mark} suggests the
presence of other ideological factors:]{.underline} \[Disparitarian
discourse's\] [commitment to a fundamentally essentialist and
ahistorical race-first view is betrayed in the constantly expanding
panoply of neologisms -- "institutional racism," "systemic racism,"
"structural racism," "colourblind racism," post-racial racism," etc. --
[intended to graft more complex social dynamics onto a
simplistic]{.mark} and frequently [psychologistic]{.mark}
racism/antiracism [political ontology]{.mark}]{.underline}. Indeed,
these efforts bring to mind \[Thomas\] Kuhn's account of attempts to
accommodate mounting anomalies to salvage an interpretive paradigm in
danger of crumbling under a crisis of authority. And in this
circumstance as well the salvage effort is driven by powerful material
and ideological imperatives (Reed and Chowkwanyun 2012, 167). **[[That
ontological view of racism is what enabled]{.underline}]{.mark}** Bell's
[**[insistence that nothing has changed]{.mark}** for black Americans
since 1865 **[without having to confront]{.mark}**]{.underline}
apparently **[[disconfirming evidence]{.underline}]{.mark}** of his own
biography and the context of his declaration. [It also underlies the
preference for invoking historical analogies in lieu of argument. The
point of those analogies is not to explain the mechanisms through which
contemporary inequalities are reproduced. It is to preserve the
interpretive framework that identifies racism as the definitive source
of those inequalities.]{.underline} Antiracism's class character helps
to understand why its adherents are so intensely committed to it even
though it is so deeply flawed analytically and has generated so little
popular traction politically. One layer of its appeal derives simply
from habit buttressed with a simulacrum of familiarity engendered by the
naïve conceptions of black political history that prompted Willie
Legette's deathless observation that "The only thing that hasn't changed
about black politics since 1965 is how we think about it" (Warren et al.
2016). [People think about black politics as a unitary, transhistorical
"freedom movement" or "liberation struggle" because that is how
scholarly and popular discussion of black Americans' political activity
has been framed almost universally since the academic study of black
politics and political thought took shape during the 1950s and
1960s,]{.underline} and especially after the institutionalization of
black studies as a field of study in the academic mainstream through the
1970s to 1990s. The guild interest in carving out and protecting the
boundaries of a field of study and interpretive authority over its
subject matter converges with the broader class interest in maintaining
managerial and interpretive authority in the political economy of race
relations (Reed 2004). [Crucial to making sense of the current political
moment and how to navigate the real perils that face us after November
2016 is recognition that]{.underline}, no matter how it may have been
aligned in the past, [[**antiracist politics now is fundamentally
antagonistic to**]{.mark} a left politics of broadly **[egalitarian
social transformation]{.mark}**. Key elements of the black
professional-managerial strata have been **[embedded in]{.mark}** and
are agents]{.underline} and minions [of]{.underline} what we now call
**[[neoliberalism]{.underline}]{.mark}**---as public functionaries,
contractors, and aspirants---since its emergence in the 1970s and 1980s.
In the 1980s and 1990s, underclass ideology rationalized claims to a
special tutelary role for the black professional-managerial class in
relation to a rank-and-file black population that that politics rendered
invisible as postal workers, teachers, truck drivers, carpenters,
clerks, warehouse workers, electricians or line workers, nurses, cable
technicians, etc. or members of a constantly expanding industrial
reserve army and represented as an undifferentiated mass to be
ventriloquized and "uplifted." [[Underclass ideology came with a remedy
of inculcating "personal responsibility," which conveniently permits
public officials to deflect concerns with]{.mark} retreat from [social
service provision]{.mark} and other social wage policies in an era
increasingly defined by regressive transfer. [Neoliberal
privatization]{.mark}]{.underline} also [has [produced greatly expanded
commercial and career opportunities for black]{.mark}]{.underline} (and
Latino, female, etc.) [[entrepreneur]{.mark}s under the rubric of
community "empowerment,]{.underline}" "role modeling," or "social
entrepreneurialism" [in a vast third sector economy driven by a
nonprofit sector likely as not committed to privatizing public goods in
the name of localist authenticity and doing well by doing good, as well
as the steadily growing diversity industry**. [These developments
legitimize an ideal of social justice shriveled to little more than
enhancement of opportunity for individual upward
mobility]{.mark}**]{.underline}---within the strictures of neoliberal
accumulation by dispossession. Black professional-managerial class
embeddedness has become increasingly solidified with the
Clinton/Obama/Emanuel wing of the Democratic party's aggressive
commitment to a left-neoliberalism centered on advancement of Wall
Street and Silicon Valley economic interests and strong support for
social justice defined in identity group terms. But that is necessarily
a notion of social justice and equality that is disconnected from
political economy and the capitalist class dynamics that generate the
most profound inequalities in the society. And militant opposition to
conventional left norms of justice that center on economic equality
unites the Clintonite neoliberal Democrats and race-reductionist
antiracists. In this regard, the most telling moments of the 2016
Democratic presidential nomination campaign included when the random,
self-selected Black Lives Matter activists attacked Sanders for
supposedly not declaring his opposition to racism in a way that suited
their tastes and when former civil rights movement icon Rep. John Lewis
(D-GA) and other prominent black functionaries denounced Sanders's calls
for greatly expanding social wage policy and shifting national
priorities toward addressing the needs of working people as
irresponsible. Perhaps most telling of all, though, was when and most of
all how Hillary Clinton blithely and disingenuously blew off Sanders's
concerns with economic injustice. On the eve of the Nevada primary, she
declared to a rally of her supporters "Not everything is about an
economic theory, right? If we broke up the big banks tomorrow -- and I
will, if they deserve it, if they pose a systemic risk, I will -- would
that end racism? Would that end sexism? Would that end discrimination
against the LGBT community? Would that make people feel more welcoming
to immigrants overnight? Would that solve our problem with voting
rights, and Republicans who are trying to strip them away from people of
color, the elderly, the young?" (Weigel 2016). Since the election, that
alliance against class politics has become even more aggressive in
red-baiting Sanders and the left via a new sort of
race-baiting---attacking socialism, and advocates of socialism or
social-democratic politics, as racist or white supremacist. It has
closed ranks around condemnation of working-class whites who voted for
Trump as loathsome and irredeemable racists with whom political
solidarity is indefensible and in the process reducing "working class"
to a white racial category and synonym for backwardness and bigotry.
Antiracists and neoliberal Democrats unite in high moral dudgeon to
denounce suggestions that more than racism operated to generate the
Trump vote and that some working people, particularly those whom Les
Leopold describes as Obama/Sanders/Trump voters---and not necessarily
only white ones---felt betrayed by both parties (Leopold 2017; Lopez
2016; Parenti 2016; Edwards-Levy 2017; Shepard 2017; Skelley 2017; Cohn
2017). The practical upshot of that moral stance is that there can be no
political alternative outside neoliberalism. That is why [it is
important, as we look toward the daunting prospect of building a
movement capable of changing the terms of debate in American politics to
center the interests and concerns of working people---of all races,
genders, sexual orientations, and whatever immigration status---who are
the vast majority of the country, that we recognize that
**[race-reductionist politics is the left wing of neoliberalism and
nothing more]{.mark}**. It is openly antagonistic to the idea of a
solidaristic left. It is more important than ever to acknowledge that
reality and act accordingly.]{.underline}

### Alt---Strategic Universalism 

#### Articulating a *universal* interest in the end of capitalism is the *[only]{.underline}* way to dismantle white supremacy. Coming to a greater grasp of the interests bound up in identitarian concerns is a [bad way]{.underline} to understand the world because it buys into a [false ideology]{.underline} of [inherent division]{.underline}. 

**Haider 18** (Asad, founding Editor of Viewpoint Magazine, an
investigative journal of contemporary politics, PhD candidate in the

Ignatiev ruthlessly attacked the Weatherman problematic in a paper
called "Without a Science of Navigation We Cannot Sail in Stormy Seas,"
which is today a jarring discovery:

> [White supremacy is the real secret of the rule of the bourgeoisie and
> the hidden cause behind the failure of the labor movement in this
> country]{.underline}. [[White-skin privileges serve only the
> bourgeoisie]{.underline}]{.mark}, [and precisely for that reason they
> will not let us escape them]{.underline}, [but instead pursue us with
> them through every hour of our life, no matter where we
> go]{.underline}. [They are **poison bait**]{.underline}.

This view of white supremacy entailed a very different conception of the
politics of white privilege, as Ignatiev elaborated:

> [[To suggest that the acceptance of white]{.underline}]{.mark}-skin
> [[privilege is in the interests of white workers **is equivalent to
> suggesting that swallowing the** ]{.mark}**worm with the [hook]{.mark}
> in it [is in the interests of the fish]{.mark}**]{.underline}. [To

> that the fish is making a sacrifice when it leaps from the
> water]{.underline}, flips its tail, shakes its head furiously in every
> direction and throws the barbed offering.7

Today's [privilege politics]{.underline} [cannot]{.underline} possibly
[permit a position of this kind]{.underline}. [We are instead left with
endless variations on the Weatherman position, though without the
appeals to armed struggle, bank robberies, and Lenin's theory of
imperialism]{.underline}. [When contemporary white [liberals]{.mark}
adapt the Weatherman position, they]{.underline} often [[end
up]{.underline} [claiming that a new wave of]{.underline}]{.mark}
["pro-white" [socialists has arisen to defend the "white working
class]{.mark}."]{.underline} But [[their caricature]{.mark} [obscures
the]{.mark}]{.underline} important [point]{.underline}, **[[made by
black revolutionaries]{.underline}]{.mark}** throughout American
history, [[that the project of emancipation requires **overcoming the
ideology of race**]{.underline}]{.mark}. Although he characterized the
material advantages of whiteness as a "psychological wage," W.E.B. [Du
Bois did not reduce whiteness to an effect of individual
psychology]{.underline}. In fact, immediately preceding the passage on
the psychological wage, Du Bois wrote:

> [[The theory of race]{.mark} was supplemented by a carefully planned
> and slowly evolved method, which [drove such a wedge between the white
> and black workers]{.mark} that there probably are not today in the
> world two groups of workers with practically identical interests who
> hate and fear each other]{.underline} [[so deeply]{.underline}]{.mark}
> and persistently and who are kept so far apart [[that neither sees
> **anything of common interest**]{.underline}]{.mark}.8

[When Du Bois suggested that white and black workers have "practically
identical interests," he was not making an appeal to some mythical
"white working class]{.underline}." Still less was he guilty of some
kind of "class reductionism," which decides in the abstract that class
is more fundamental than race. Of course, some people really do make
this argument---and they play right into the hands of identitarian
liberals, who ask how the young woman seeking an abortion and the
evangelical protester, the undocumented immigrant and the salaried
worker, can possibly have the same "interests."

But [[this challenge]{.mark} is afflicted by the same condition it
claims to diagnose]{.underline}. [It [mistakes the **casual
description** of a **shared trait for a claim about
identity**]{.mark}]{.underline}. [[We all have numerous interests that
are related to our identities]{.underline}]{.mark} but also to where we
work and where we live. To say that these [[different spheres of life
interact and intersect]{.underline}]{.mark} is a banal truism [[which
explains **neither how our society is structured and
reproduced**]{.underline} **[nor how we might formulate a strategy to
change this structure]{.underline}**]{.mark}.

Du Bois was recognizing [[the lived reality of the working
class]{.underline}]{.mark}, [which contains white people and people of
color, people of all genders and sexualities]{.underline}, [the employed
and the unemployed]{.underline}---[[a multitude of people **irreducible
to any single description**]{.underline}]{.mark}. [A meaningful common
interest between them does not somehow exist by default]{.underline}. We
cannot reduce any group of people and the multitudes they contain to a
single common interest, as though we were reducing a fraction. [[A
common interest is **constituted by the composition of these multitudes
into a group**]{.underline}]{.mark}. [This is a process of **political
practice**]{.underline}.

[[White supremacy is the phenomenon whereby the plurality of
interests]{.mark} of a group of people [is reorganized into the fiction
of a white race]{.mark} whose very existence is predicated on the
violent and genocidal history of the oppression of people of
color]{.underline}. [The self-organized struggles of oppressed people
against white supremacy have managed to significantly
undermine]{.underline}, though by no means eliminate, [this kind of
organization]{.underline}.

It was no accident that [these struggles ultimately put forward the
insight that [it was necessary to constitute a **common interest**
through **class organization**]{.mark}]{.underline}, [[which extends to
an opposition to the **whole capitalist
system**]{.underline}]{.mark}---because [[it is the structure of the
capitalist system that prevents all people who are dispossessed of the
means of production]{.mark},]{.underline} regardless of their
identities, [[from having **control over their own lives**]{.mark}
[and]{.mark} thus from **[pursuing whatever interests they may
have]{.mark}**, [in]{.mark} [all their
particularity]{.mark}]{.underline}.

[Although per capita wealth in donor countries has grown by
approximately 230% since 1961, aid per person has increased by only 50%
in that time]{.underline} (Reality of Aid Management Committee, 2006).
[[According to WB estimates "poor performing" countries received 43% 18
less aid between 1992 and 2002 than would be warranted by their poverty
and population levels]{.mark} (]{.underline}Reality of Aid Management
Committee, 2006).

Aid is often in the form of loans granted to the host country on
favorable terms. But [[high levels of indebtedness have often been used
to coerce debtor countries to adopt neo liberal policies to open up
their countries to greater foreign influence and control]{.mark}. In
some of the poorest countries payment for debt is greater than
expenditures for health or education]{.underline} (Monbiot, 2005).
External loans have also often been misused by the host government and
not used to benefit the population. This odious or illegitimate debt has
not always been cancelled by the lenders, who have evaded their
responsibility in making these loans in the first place (Eurodad, 2008).
Aid figures reported over the past few years often include debt
cancellation masquerading as official development assistance. When this
is deducted, the increase in official development assistance is
significantly lower or even represents a decline over previous years. It
is unlikely that the United Nations Millennium Development Goals will be
met by 2015 given these shortfalls in aid and commitment (Reality of Aid
Management Committee, 2006) (United Nations Development Programme,
2005).

[[Many countries though are committed to military spending, which
increased dramatically]{.mark} to more than US\$1 trillion globally in
2004, a small fraction of which would have been sufficient to achieve
the Millennium Development Goals]{.underline} (Reality of Aid Management
Committee, 2006) (United Nations Development Programme, 2005).
**[D[evelopment assistance policies have been dramatically altered since
2001 to reflect the security]{.mark}]{.underline}** []{.mark}19
**[[interests of predominantly western countries, who are increasingly
providing aid for strategic reasons in their fight against
terrorism]{.mark}]{.underline}** (Reality of Aid Management Committee,
2006). In addition, [[the increasing participation of the military in
humanitarian and development work has contributed to a blurring of the
line between the military and aid agencies, increasing the risk for
development workers, threatening their neutrality, and
diminishing]{.mark} their [ability to function and to carry out]{.mark}
their [mandate]{.mark}]{.underline} (Waldman, 2008).

[Tied aid, requiring the procurement of donor country goods or services
such as food and technical assistance, amounted to more than 36% of
development assistance funds in 2004]{.underline}. In Afghanistan for
example, more than half of aid is tied. An estimated 72% of American aid
is tied (Waldman, 2008) (Reality of Aid Management Committee, 2006).

The professed intent and efficacy of international development efforts
and economic and trade reforms, is belied by the fact that during the
last 200 years Japan, and perhaps the Asian Tigers, have been the only
countries to join the ranks of the developed nations (L. Taylor, 2006).
Considering that in 2003,18 countries with a total population of almost
half a billion people had a lower human development index (HDI) than in
1990, the prognosis for a significant increase in the numbers of
developed nations seems unlikely any time soon (United Nations
Development Programme, 2005). Rather it seems as if [**[the development
industry is arranged so that the lesser developed countries will not
succeed, but rather be satellites, serving the interests of the
developed countries]{.underline}**.]{.mark}

Acceleration, speed, the cult of the machine---these are the val­ues
emphasized by the *Futurist Manifesto.* Marinetti\'s text is a hymn to
the disrupting modernity that in those decades was changing the face of
the world, especially in the industrialized countries. Italy was not one
of them: having only recently achieved national unification, its economy
was based on agriculture, and the Italian style of life and consumption
was traditional and backward. It wasn\'t by chance that the Futurist
movement surfaced in Italy---and in Russia. These two countries shared a
common social situation: scant development of in­dustrial production, the
marginality of the bourgeois class, a reliance on cultural and religious
models of the past, the allure of foreign cul­ture (especially French)
for urban intellectuals. This is the background of the Futurist
explosion, both in Italy and in Russia, but we should not only see this
movement as a reaction against national backward­ness. On the contrary,
it activated an aesthetic energy that spread all over Europe during the
following decades; it was the artistic core of the , enthusiastic belief
that the future would fulfil great expectations in the fields of
politics, science, technology, and new styles of life. We declare that
the splendor of the world has been enriched by a new beauty: the beauty
of speed. A racing automobile with its bonnet adorned with great tubes
like serpents with explosive breath \... a roaring motor car which seems
to run on machine-gun fire, is more beautiful than the Victory of
Samothrace. (ibid.) The *Futurist Manifesto* declared the aesthetic
value of speed. The myth of speed sustained the whole edifice of
modernity\'s imaginary, and the reality of speed played a crucial role
in the history of cap­ital, whose development is based on the
acceleration of labor time. Productivity in fact is the growth rate of
accumulated relative surplus value, determined by the speed of the
productive gesture and the in­tensification of its rhythm. We will sing
of the great crowds agitated by work, pleasure and revolt; the
multicolored and polyphonic surf of revolutions in modern capitals: the
nocturnal vibration of the arsenals and the workshops beneath their
violent electric moons: the [gluttonous railway stations devouring
smoking serpents; factories suspended from the clouds by the thread of
their smoke; bridges with the leap of gymnasts flung across the diabolic
cutlery of sunny riv­ers: adventurous steamers sniffing the horizon;
great-breasted lo­comotives, puffing on the rails like enormous steel
horses with long tubes for bridle, and the gliding flight of aeroplanes
whose propeller sounds like the flapping of a flag and the applause of
enthusiastic crowds, (ibid.) The Manifesto asserted the aesthetic value
of the machine. The machine par excellence is the speed machine, the
car, the airplane, tools making possible the mobilization of the social
body]{.underline}. Marinetti dedica­ted a poem to the racing car: *To The
Racing Car* Veeeeehemently god of a race of steel Car drrrunken on
space, that paws the ground and trembles with anguish seizing the bit
with shrill teeth \... Formidable Japanese monster, with the eyes of a
forge, nourished on flame and mineral oils, eager for horizons and
sidereal prey \... I unchain your heart that pulsates diabolically, I
unchain your gigantic tires, for the dance that you know how to dance
away through the white sheets of the whole world! (Marinetti 2004, 47)
For us, dwellers in the postmodern conurbation, driving back home from
the office, stuck and immovable in the traffic jam of rush hour,
Marinetti\'s adoration of the car seems a little bit ludicrous. Butthe
reality and concept of the machine have changed, a hundred years after
the *Futurist Manifesto.* Futurism exalted the machine as an exter­nal
object, visible in the city landscape, but [now the machine is inside
us: we are no longer obsessed with the external machine; instead, the
\"infomachine\" now intersects with the social nervous
system,]{.underline} the \"bio-machine\" interacts with the genetic
becoming of the human organism. Digital and biotechnologies have turned
the external machine of iron and steel into the internalized and
recombining machine of the bio-in­fo era. The bio-info machine is no
longer separable from body or mind, because it\'s no longer an external
tool, but an internal transformer of body and mind, a linguistic and
cognitive enhancer. Now the nanoma-chine is mutating the human brain and
the linguistic ability to produce and communicate. The machine is us. In
the mechanical era, the machine stood before the body, and changed human
behavior, enhancing our potency without changing our physical structure.
The assembly line, for instance, although im­proving and increasing the
productive power of laborers did not mod­ify their physical organism nor
introduce mutations inside their cogni­tive ability. The machine is no
longer in front of the body but inside it. Bodies and minds therefore
cannot express and relate anymore without the technical support of the
biomachine. Because of this, [political power has changed its
nature]{.underline}. When the machine was external, the State had to
regulate the body and for this it used the law. Agencies of repression
were used to force the con­scious organisms to submit to the State\'s
rhythm without rebellion. Now [political domination is internalized and
indistinguishable from the machine itself. Both the machine and the
machinic imagination undergo a mutation]{.underline}. Marinetti thought
of the machine in modern terms, as an external enhancer. In the
biosocial age, the machine is in­formational: an internalized process of
linguistic modeling, logic, and cognitive automatisms. A hundred years
after the publication of the *Futurist Manifesto,* speed also has been
transferred from the realm of external machines to the infor­mation
domain. Speed itself has been internalized. During the twentieth
century, [the machine of speed accomplished the colonization of global
\"space; this was followed by the colonization of the domain of time, of
the mind and perception, so that the future collapsed. The collapse of
the fu­ture is rooted in the acceleration of psychic and cognitive rhythm
Thanks to the external machine the spatial colonization of our planet
has been accomplished: transportation tools allow us to reach every inch
of the Earth, and give us the possibility of knowing, mark­ing,
controlling, and exploiting every single place. The machines have made
it possible to excavate at a tremendous rate, to penetrate the bow­els of
the Earth, to exploit underground resources, to occupy every vis­ible
spot with the products of technical reproduction.]{.underline} As long
as spatial colonization was underway, as long as the external machine
headed to­ward new territories, a future was conceivable, because the
future is not only a dimension of time, but also of space. The future is
the space we do not yet know; we have yet to discover and exploit it.
Now that [every inch of the planet has been colonized, the colonization
of the temporal dimension has began, i.e., the colonization of mind, of
perception, of life. Thus begins the century with no
future]{.underline}. The question of the relationship between an
unlimited expan­sion of cyberspace and the limits of cybertime opens up
here. Being the virtual intersection of the projections generated by
countless us­ers, cyberspace is unlimited and in a process of continuous
expansion. Cybertime, the ability of social attention to process
information in time, is organic, cultural, and emotional, therefore
anything but un­limited. Subjected to the infinite acceleration of
infostimuli, the mind reacts with either panic or desensitization. The
concept of sensibility, and the different but related concept of
sensitivity, are crucial here. Sensitivity is the ability of the human
senses to process information; sensibility is the faculty that makes
empathic understanding possible, the ability to comprehend what words
cannot say, the power to inter­pret a continuum of non-discrete elements,
nonverbal signs, and the flows of empathy. This faculty, which enables
humans to understand ambiguous messages in the context of relationships,
might now be dis­appearing. [We are currently witnessing the development
of a genera­tion of human beings lacking competence in
sensibility]{.underline}, the ability to empathically understand the
other and decode signs that are not codi­fied in a binary system.

More than ever, [economic rationality is at odds with social
rationality. Economic science is not part of the solution to the crisis:
it is the source of the problem]{.underline}. On July 18th 2009 the
headline of The Economist read: "What went wrong with economics?" The
text is an attempt to downplay the crisis of the Economics profession,
and of economic knowledge. [For neoliberal economists the central dogma
of growth, profit and competition cannot be questioned, because it is
identified with the]{.underline} perfect mathematical rationality of the
market. And belief in the intrinsic rationality of the market is crucial
in the economic theology of neoliberalism. But [the reduction of social
life to the rational exchange of economic values is an
obsession]{.underline} that has nothing to do with science. [It's a
political strategy aimed to identify humans as calculating
machines]{.underline}, aimed to shape behavior and perception [in such a
way that money becomes the only motivation of social
action]{.underline}. But it is not accurate as a description of social
dynamics, and the conflicts, pathologies, and irrationality of human
relationships. Rather, it is an attempt at creating the anthropological
brand of homo calculans that Foucault (2008) has described in his
seminar of 1979/80, published with the title The Birth of Biopolitics.
[This attempt to identify human beings with calculating devices has
produced cultural devastation]{.underline}, and has finally been showed
to have been based upon flawed assumptions. [Human beings do calculate,
but **their calculation is not perfectly rational, because the value of
goods is** not determined by objective reasons, and because decisions
are influenced by]{.underline} what Keynes named [animal
spirits]{.underline}. "We will never really understand important
economic events unless we confront the fact that their causes are
largely mental in nature," say Akerlof and Shiller (2009: 1) in their
book Animal Spirits, echoing Keynes's assumption that the rationality of
the market is not perfect in itself. Akerlof and Shiller are avowing the
crisis of neoliberal thought, but their critique is of radical enough,
and does not touch the legitimacy of the economic episteme. Animal
Spirits is the title of an other book, by Matteo Pasquinelli (2008).
Pasquinelli's book deals with bodies and digits, and parasites, and goes
much deeper in its understanding of the roots of the crisis than its
eponymous publication: "[Cognitive capitalism emerges in the form of a
parasite: it subjects social knowledge and inhibits its emancipatory
potential]{.underline}" (Pasquinelli 2008: 93). "Beyond the computer
screen, precarious [workers]{.underline} and freelancers [experience how
Free Labor and competition are increasingly devouring their everyday
life]{.underline}" (Pasquinelli 2008: 15). Pasquinelli goes to the core
of the problem: the virtualization of social production has acted as the
proliferation of a parasite, destroying the prerequisites of living
relationships, absorbing and neutralizing the living energies of
cognitive workers. [The economic recession is not only the effect of
financial craziness, but also the effect of the de-vitalization of the
social field. This is why the collapse of the economic system is also
the collapse of economic epistemology that has guided the direction of
politics in the last two centuries. Economics cannot understand the
depth of the crisis, because below the crisis of financial exchange
there is the crisis **of symbolic exchange. I mean** the psychotic boom
of panic, depression, and suicide, the general decline of desire and
social empathy]{.underline}.

The question that rises from the collapse is so radical that the answer
cannot be found in the economic conceptual framework. Furthermore, one
must ask if economics really is a science? If the word "science" means
the creation of concepts for the understanding and description of an
object, [economics is not a science. Its object does not exist. The
economic object]{.underline} (scarcity, salaried labor, and profit[) is
not an object that exists before and outside the performative action of
the economic episteme. Production, consumption, and daily life become
part of the economic discourse when labor is detached and opposed to
human activity]{.underline}, when it falls under the domination of
capitalist rule. The economic object does not pre-exist conceptual
activity, and economic description is in fact a normative action. In
this sense Economics is a technique, a process of semiotization of the
world, and also a mythology, a narration. [Economics]{.underline} is a
suggestion and a categorical imperative: Money makes things happen. It
[is the source of action in the world and perhaps the only power we
invest in. Life seems to depend on it]{.underline}. Everything within us
would like to say that it does not, that this cannot be. But the
Almighty Dollar has taken command. The more it is denied the more it
shows itself as Almighty. Perhaps in every other respect, in every other
value, bankruptcy has been declared, giving money the power of some
sacred deity, demanding to be recognized. [Economics no longer persuades
money to behave]{.underline}. Numbers cannot make the beast lie down and
be quiet or sit up and do tricks. At best, [economics is a neurosis of
money]{.underline}, a symptom contrived to hold the beast in
abeyance.... Thus [economics shares the language of psychopathology --
inflation, depression, lows and highs, slumps and peaks, investments and
losses]{.underline}. (Sordello 1983) From the age of the enclosures in
England [the economic process has been a process of production of
scarcity]{.underline} (scarcification). The enclosures were intended to
scarcify the land, and the basic means of survival, so that people who
so far had been able to cultivate food for their family were forced to
become proletarians, then salaried industrial workers. [Capitalism is
based on the artificial creation of need, and economic science is
essentially a technique of scarcification of time, life and
food]{.underline}. Inside the condition of scarcity [human beings are
subjected to exploitation]{.underline} and to the domain of
profit-oriented activity. After scarcifying the land (enclosures)
capitalism has scarcified time itself, forcing people who don't have
property other than their own life and body, to lend their life-time to
capital. Now the capitalist obsession for growth is making scarce both
water and air. [Economic science is not the science of prediction: it is
the technique of producing, implementing, and pushing
scarcity]{.underline} and need. This is why Marx did not speak of
economy, but of political economy. The technique of [economic
scarcification is based on a mythology, a narration that identifies
richness as property and acquisition, and subjugates the possibility of
living to the lending of time and to the transformation of human
activity into salaried work]{.underline}. In recent decades[,
technological change has slowly eroded the very foundations of economic
science. Shifting from the sphere of production of material objects to
the semiocapitalist production of immaterial goods]{.underline}, the
[Economic concepts are losing their foundation and
legitimacy]{.underline}. The basic categories of Economics are becoming
totally artificial. The theoretical [justification of private
property]{.underline}, as you read in the writings of John Locke, [is
based on the need of exclusive consumption]{.underline}. An apple must
be privatized, if you want to avoid the danger that someone else eats
your apple. But [what happens when goods are immaterial, infinitely
replicable without cost? Thanks to digitalization and immaterialization
of the production process, the economic nomos of private property loses
its ground,]{.underline} its raison d'etre, [and it can be imposed only
by force]{.underline}. Furthermore, the very foundation of salary, the
relationship between time needed for production and value of the
product, is vanishing. [The immaterialization and cognitivization of
production makes it almost impossible to quantify the average time
needed to produce value. Time and value become incommensurable, and
violence becomes the only law able to determine price and
salary.]{.underline} The neoliberal school, which has opened the way to
the worldwide deregulation of social production, has fostered the
mythology of rational expectations in economic exchange, and has touted
the idea of a selfregulation of the market, first of all the
labor-market. But self-regulation is a lie. [In order to increase
exploitation, and to destroy social welfare, global capitalism has used
political institutions like the International Monetary Fund and the
World Trade Organization,]{.underline} not to mention the military
enforcement of the political decisions of these institutions. Far from
being self-regulated, the market is militarily regulated. The mythology
of free individuals loyally competing on the base of perfect knowledge
of the market is a lie, too. [Real human beings are not perfect rational
calculating machines. And the myth of rational expectations has finally
crashed after the explosion of the real estate mortgage bubble. The
theory of rational expectation is crucial in neoliberal
thought]{.underline}: the economic agents are supposed to be free to
choose in a perfectly rational way the best deal in selling and buying.
The fraud perpetrated by the investment agencies has destroyed the lives
of millions of Americans, and has exposed the theoretical swindle.
[Economic exchange cannot be described as a rational game, because
irrational factors play a crucial role in social life in
general]{.underline}. [Trickery, misleading information, and psychic
manipulation are not exceptions]{.underline}, but the professional tools
of advertisers, financial agents, and economic consultants. The idea
that social relationships can be described in mathematical terms has the
force of myth, but it is not science, and it has nothing to do with
natural law. Notwithstanding the failure of the theory, neoliberal
politics are still in control of the global machine, because [the
criminal class that has seized power has no intention of stepping
down,]{.underline} and because the social brain is unable to recompose
and find the way of self-organization. I read in the New York Times on
September 6th 2009: After the mortgage business imploded last year, Wall
Street investment banks began searching for another big idea to make
money. They think they may have found one. The [bankers plan to buy
"life settlements," life insurance policies that ill and elderly people
sell for cash, depending on the life expectancy of the insured
person]{.underline}. Then they plan to "securitize" these policies, in
Wall Street jargon, by packaging hundreds of thousands together into
bonds. They will then resell those bonds to investors, like big pension
funds, who will receive the payouts when people with the insurance die.
[The earlier the policyholder dies, the bigger the return,]{.underline}
though if people live longer than expected investors could get poor
returns or even lose money. Imagine that I buy an insurance policy on my
life (something I would absolutely not do). My insurer of course will
wish me a long life, so I'll pay the fee for a long time, while he
should pay lots of money to my family if I die. But some enlightened
finance guru has the brilliant idea of insuring the insurer. He buys the
risk, and he invests on the hope that I die soon. You don't need the
imagination of Philip K. Dick to guess the follow up of the story:
[financial agents will be motivated to kill me overnight. The talk of
recovery is based on necronomy, the economy of death]{.underline}. It's
not new, as [capitalism has always profited from wars, slaughters and
genocides. But]{.underline} now the equation becomes unequivocal. [Death
is the promise, death is the investment and the hope. Death is the best
future that capitalism may secure. The logic of speculation is different
from the logic of spectacle]{.underline} that was dominant in
late-modern times. [Spectacle is the mirrorization of life]{.underline},
the transfer of life in the mirror of spectacular accumulation.
[Speculation is the subjugation of the future to its financial mirror,
the substitution of present life with future money that will never come,
because death will come before]{.underline}. The lesson that we must
learn from the first year of the global recession is sad: neoliberal
folly is not going away, the [financial plungers will not stop their
speculation, and corporations will not stop their exploitation, and the
political class]{.underline}, largely controlled by the corporate
lobbies, [is unwilling or unable to protect society from the final
assault]{.underline}. In 1996 J. G. Ballard (1996: 188) wrote: "the most
perfect crime of all -- when the victims are either willing, or aren't
aware that they are victims". [Democracy seems unable to stop the
criminal class that has seized control of the economy, because the
decisions are no longer made in the sphere of political opinion, but in
the inaccessible sphere of economic automatism. The economy has been
declared the basic standard of decision, and the economists have
systematically identified Economy with the capitalist obsession of
growth. No room for political choice has been left, as the corporate
principles have been embedded in the technical fabric of language and
imagination.]{.underline}

#### Life's precarity necessitates extinction 

**Bifo '19** Franco Berardi, Founder of the famous Radio Alice in
Bologna and an important figure in the Italian Autonomia movement, is a
writer, media theorist, and social activist. His most recent books are

On March 15, 2019, in many cities around the world, one million children
marched under the banner of "Climate Strike." Why should we go to
school? Why should we prepare for a future that we will not have? We
want you to panic. Then what? This movement is a rebellion against
extinction. (Can you rebel against extinction?) [Simultaneously, this is
the beginning of a culture of transitoriness and of rage against those
who have engendered us.]{.underline} Zain, the protagonist of the movie
Capernaum (2018), directed by the Lebanese filmmaker Nadine Labaki, is a
twelve-year-old Syrian boy who lives with five siblings in a refugee
camp in the metropolitan chaos of Beirut. Zain was not marching with
Greta Thunberg and other youth activists on March 15, 2019; having been
summoned by a judge, he demands that his parents be prosecuted for the
crime of giving birth to him. [Zain is the perfect symbol of the
children's crusade that is mounting everywhere: an immense crowd of
innocent victims who want to know why they have been compelled to
abandon the blank immortality of eternal Nothingness, why they have been
summoned, assembled in this awkward city of violence, in the sad
murkiness of precarity and anguish.]{.underline} Why did you force me
out of my space of dispassionate nonbeing into the fog and fury of
exhaustion? It is not the world that is sinking, but the jumble of my
synaptic circuits. Entropy is expanding down there, blurring vision,
clouding meaning, obstructing any path of escape. [[We are not dealing
with the disintegration of the universe]{.mark}, or with the undoing of
the social foundation, [but rather]{.mark} with [the unstoppable
degradation of my nervous cells]{.mark}. But reality at the end of the
day is but the dynamic projection of countless experiences of mental
decay]{.underline}. The relation between Kronos and his son Zeus was
troubled, they say. Kronos, the king of the gods in the age of Chaos,
swallowed his own sons because he had been told that his destiny was to
be overthrown by one of them. The goddess Rhea, however, tricked Kronos
by getting him to swallow a rock, and hid Zeus in a cave on the island
of Crete. Eventually, Zeus chained up his father Kronos, became the king
of the gods and the architect of the Universe, and turned Chaos into
Cosmos. Time, the Great Destroyer, must be chained up in order for an
eternal order to be imposed on the world. Order is ceaselessly
collapsing into Chaos. Eventually, the mind rebuilds structures and
restores mental order, so that Chaos leads to Cosmos. Then Cosmos
collapses again. This cycle is well known; this is how our experience
unfolds in time. [Time and Structure play their infinite game on two
different planes: Time cannot exist in a world ruled by Structure,
because Structures are immutable and eternal. But Time is the decomposer
of all Structures, and the agent of the extinction of all
things.]{.underline} In the structural universe, temporality does not
exist: Kronos is chained. In the living universe of temporality,
Structures are continuously dissolved: Kronos unchained. The mind is the
only place where these two universes coexist: the universe of
abstraction and the universe of life. [In the realm of matter, and
particularly in the realm of biological matter, [extinction is the
destiny of every entity, both of individual particularities and of
collective multiplicities]{.mark}. However, throughout the course of
evolution, [the human mind has pursued eternal duration, so as to make
immortality possible]{.mark}.]{.underline} The human mind has succeeded
in this search for eternity by creating the sphere of abstraction: pure
mathematical relation independent from physical matter and therefore
preserved from death[. [The mind]{.mark}, indeed, [is the only dimension
in which order dwells, and where the immortal can be found]{.mark}:
mathematical order.]{.underline} But we should not forget that the human
mind is embodied. This bodily nature implies that the individual mind is
subject to the effects of time: decay and extinction. [[The mind is the
source of abstraction]{.mark} (immortality), [but also the domain of
sensitive duration]{.mark}; organic architecture lives and dies like all
perishable material substances. [This is why mathematical reason cannot
indefinitely coexist with a sensitive organism]{.mark}.]{.underline} In
the long run, the insertion of mathematical entities into the continuum
of social life engenders lethal disturbances, nervous breakdowns.
Mathematics is the mental dimension in which extension is replaced by
relation, the realm of immateriality in which time is irrelevant. In
order to achieve immortality, Faust struck a deal with Mephistopheles.
But Faust didn't realize that the best path to immortality is the
mathematization of the world. Since you want to live forever, says the
digital Mephistopheles to the transhumanist Faust, you will be
recombined into the immortal abstraction of the automaton. Look up here,
I'm in heaven I've got scars that can't be seen I've got drama, can't be
stolen Everybody knows me now Look up here, man, I'm in danger I've got
nothing left to lose I'm so high, it makes my brain whirl Dropped my
cell phone down below Ain't that just like me? ---David Bowie,
"Lazarus," from the album Blackstar (2016) The global cognitive
automaton is under construction in the sphere of computation. The
process of constructing the automaton is asymptotic, ever-expanding, and
never finished. Its genealogy is rooted in the history of the modern
mathematization of the world. Galileo was persuaded that philosophy is
written in the great book of the universe, which is continuously open in
front of our eyes, but cannot be realized it we don't learn the language
in which it is written. It is written in the language of mathematics,
and its characters are triangles, circles, and other geometric forms. If
we ignore them, we cannot understand a single word of the universe, and
we are doomed to vainly wander in a labyrinth of darkness.
Mathematization is not only a methodology for the theoretical
formalization of natural phenomena. It is also a process of technical
determination; the digitalization of linguistic and physical processes,
in the late modern age, has proceeded to insert mathematical functions
into the living body of language and social exchange[. [The
establishment of a conventional standard for measuring space and
time]{.underline}]{.mark}[, and the ensuing reduction of all entities to
commensurability, is the core of modern science. It [is]{.mark} also
[the precondition of capitalism]{.mark}, a social system that is based
on the conventional equalization of all produced goods, [both material
and semiotic]{.mark}. Since the common measure of value is based on
socially necessary labor time, time itself has been reduced to
computation.]{.underline} The mechanical computabilization of time was
at the core of the Industrial Revolution. The objectivation of time as a
computable extension is the foundation of the social, economic, and
cultural dynamics of capitalism. Thanks to the mathematization of the
world and to the computabilization of time, the mental sphere
emancipates itself from the dimension of perishability. Abstraction is
not subject to the rule of death. Outside the walls of the Circle all
was noise and struggle, failure and filth. But here, all had been
perfected. The best people had made the best systems and the best
systems had reaped funds, unlimited funds, that made possible this, the
best place to work. ---David Eggars, The Circle Paradoxically, however,
the insertion of abstraction into social life and the cycles of the
natural environment is leading to the extinction of concreteness, and of
life itself. [The [damnation]{.mark} (or salvation?) [of death is denied
in the realm of abstraction]{.mark}; extinction is not a possibility in
the sphere of pure mathematical relations. This is why [capitalism is
eternal]{.mark}, and (unluckily enough) [this is why humankind seems to
be doomed]{.mark}. The [eternity of capitalism]{.mark}, in fact, is
[based on the annihilation of life through the process of
abstraction]{.mark}: abstract value has taken the upper hand and has
subjugated the concreteness of life, of production, consumption, and
language. Thanks to digital networks, financial capitalism has detached
the economy from the sphere of perishable things.]{.underline} The
concrete activity of producing useful things has been subsumed, recoded,
and finally abolished by the mathematic rule of financial capitalism.
[The [unintended consequence of this is the annihilation of
life]{.mark}. The [eternal survival of capitalism is enabled by the
expansion of death, so that in the end, we dwell inside the corpse of
abstraction.]{.mark}]{.underline} Never, not for a single day do we have
pure space before us in which the flowers are always unfolding. [It's
forever world and never Nowhere-without-Not: the pure and unwatched-over
air we breathe, know infinitely and do not want.]{.underline} As when
sometimes a child gets lost in the silence and has to be shaken back.
---Rilke, The Eighth Elegy [The contemporary subconscious is marked by
two powerful gravitational pulls: extinction and immortality, which feed
into each other.]{.underline} The insertion of mathematical exactitude
into the living continuum of the vibrational organism has led to the
ossifying of biodiversification. The insertion of digital connection
into the continuum of bodily conjunction has led to the syntactic
ossifying of the creative ambiguousness of sensibility. [[The allure of
extinction]{.mark} and immortality [has polarized the social
unconscious]{.mark}. A nihilistic drive emerges in aesthetics and
politics: decline, and the fear of extinction, is fuelling
ethno-nationalist cultures worldwide, and in particular a wave of
aggressive white supremacism. This is the reaction of the white male
when he perceives that he will soon be replaced. But the while male, in
his historical domination, has produced the conditions for a larger
extinction: climate change, global civil war, and psychotic collapse.
These might lead to the real extinction of life on the planet (unlike
the imagined extinction of the white supremacists). At the same time, a
frozen immortality emerges in the form of the global cognitive
automaton. This immortality results from the unravelling of the
semiocapitalist abstraction, and from the insertion of bio-info-techno
devices into language and life.]{.underline} The insertion of inorganic
intelligence into the conjunction between organic bodies acts as an
extinguisher of life and of living consciousness. Thus, extinction looms
on the horizon as the ultimate destiny of history. I didn't intend any
of this to happen. And it's moving so too fast. The idea of Completion,
it's far beyond what I had in mind when I started all this, and it's far
beyond what's right. It has to be brought back into some kind of balance
... I was trying to make the web more civil. I was trying to make it
more elegant. I got rid of anonymity. I combined a thousand disparate
elements into one unified system. But I didn't picture a world where
Circle membership was mandatory, where all government and all life was
channeled through one network ... There used to be the option of opting
out. But now that's over. Completion is the end. We are closing the
circle around everyone---it's a totalitarian nightmare. ---Ty Gospodinov
in Dave Eggars, The Circle The answer to this question is not clear to
me. [Does this extinction concern the human race, or the cultural
construct that we call "human civilization"? Social integration is
collapsing, but at the same time, the process of civilization has
culminated in the self-construction of the automaton, which impassively
takes shape in the connective space of digital **computation.
[Environmental collapse, global civil war, nuclear proliferation, and
epidemics of panic and depression are steps towards extinction]{.mark}.
But [this is not the end of the world, since abstraction has created a
world of its own]{.mark}, subsuming social language and prescribing the
social forms of interaction.**]{.underline} Twentieth century medicine
aimed to heal the sick. Twenty-first century medicine is increasingly
aiming to upgrade the healthy ... In the twentieth century, medicine
benefited the masses because the twentieth century was the age of the
masses. Twentieth century armies needed millions of healthy soldiers,
and economies needed millions of healthy workers. ---Yuval Harari, Homo
Deus: A Brief History of Tomorrow [Expansion and acceleration have been
fostered by the cultural erasure of transitoriness. Investing time in
economic value has been a way to simulate eternity: private property,
accumulation, and the sacrifice of the present on the altar of the
future. This cycle of sacrifice, investment, and expansion has been the
strength of capitalism. Now it's over. The physical resources of the
planet and the nervous energies of society are on the path to final
exhaustion.]{.underline} The collapse of visions of the future has paved
the way for reflecting on a previously forbidden subject: extinction[.
Trans-humanist utopians, for their part, indulge in fantasies about
imminent promises of high-tech immortality. Both hypocritical
tech-cheerfulness and contemporary nihilism are based on a shared vision
of the ineluctable: it's too late to stop devastation and climate
change, and it's too late to stop the psychotic collapse of the
hyper-connected mind. This helps to explain the nonsensical increase of
inequalities that marks the wealth distribution of our time: the
predators think that it is impossible to stop the extinction
process]{.underline}. In their calculation, all they can do is protect
themselves and their families, and this alone may prove enormously
expensive. Panic and cynicism prevail in the terminal psychosphere.
**[[Is there a way out from this end? Yes, of course: it is you, the
unpredictable]{.underline}]{.mark}**. In 1983, after three years of full
immersion in the laboratory of future sensibilities, I came back to my
country and, together with a group of friends I staged "Game Over," a
video-electronic poem, in an art-space called the Public Secret. The
Gang of Four was on trial in Beijing: Chang Ching, Chang Chung Chao, Yao
Wen Yuan, and Wang Hun Weng symbolized the defeat of our generation. I
spent hours in a Naples cafe playing video games. The first generation
of video games came in large metal boxes with screens. I fought little
green men in a game called Space Invaders. I was impressed by these
early electronic devices, especially because at the end of the game,
after inevitable defeat, two words appeared on the screen: Game Over.
Nowadays, these two words no longer pop up on the screen, because
players of the new generation are aware of the automaton: they have
internalized it. But sooner or later, you will be overthrown. Together
with the poet Enzo Crosio, I wrote a poem. Based on the poem, my brother
then wrote music for a concert with four voices. The Gang of Four are
playing video games in front of electronic screens, and they chant: The
exponential function of electronic speed knocks down one after the other
the functions of biological reactivity. Sooner or later you lose. The
machine always wins. Now the trial begins. The conviction is certain.
War is declared and it is going to be a war of extermination. Then Chang
Chung Chao, the dogmatic intellectual from Shanghai, yells: "What is a
crime? What is a crime? What is a crime?" Is crime the inducer of Chaos,
or the generator of Order?

### Movements 

#### only structural analysis solves -- movements are like theme parks that allow people to perform radicalism but ultimately fuel the same structures they critique

**Blühdorn 6** (Ingolfur, university of bath, uk, "Self-Experience in
the Theme Park of Radical Action? Social Movements and Political
Articulation in the Late-Modern Condition," European Journal of Social
Theory, 02/2006)

Thus, the analysis of contemporary social movements and new forms of
politi- cal articulation provides the incentive at least to outline a
theory of contempor- ary society, which can provide a framework of
reference within which contemporary social movements can then be
interpreted. Such a theory will endeavour to highlight the distinctive
problems and pathologies (structural strains) to which social movements
arguably respond -- without necessarily intending or being aware of
this. Of course, structural strains models are not new: for Marxists,
the all-important structural fault line that triggers social movements
runs between the classes of labour and capital. The post-Marxist
tradition of new social movement theory since Melucci (1980, 1989) and
Touraine (1981) locates the fault line between the primarily
identity-oriented post-materialist new politics and the more traditional
state-centred politics of material production and distri- bution. For
Habermas (1981), the structural strain originates from the conflict
between the rationality of the individual-centred lifeworld and the
function- centred logic of the political, administrative and economic
systems. And reflex- ive modernization theorists (Beck, 1992, 1997;
Giddens, 1991, 1994) believe it runs between the as yet insufficiently
modern and integrated institutions of contemporary society which
constantly produce unforeseen and undesirable sideeffects. So structural
strain approaches have always been around, but in each of these models,
the centre piece is ultimately the grievances of human individuals.
[Because these models are based on a social theory that centres on the
individual, they are,]{.underline} despite their focus on structures,
[always constructed from the perspective of actors]{.underline}. **[A
social movement theory that wants to reach beyond the limitations of
modernist-progressivist narratives about contemporary society, needs to
be based on a systems-centred rather than an individual-centred social
theory]{.underline}**. The structural strains it will highlight will,
first and foremost, be systemic problems and strains rather than
grievances perceived and articulated by human individuals.

[From a systems perspective, it will be possible to offer a
reconceptualization and reassessment of the role of social movements
that transcend the social movements' self-descriptions]{.underline} and
the modernist narratives which have been dominant so far. What is
envisaged is not so much conceptualizing social movements them- selves
as organizational or communicative systems (e.g. Luhmann, 1989, 1996;
Blühdorn, 2005, 2006) and investigating the ways in which these systems
estab- lish, stabilize and reproduce themselves. Instead, **[the
objective is to explore what contribution social movements make to the
overall system of advanced modern society; what societal function they
may fulfil rather than what self-declared goals they
pursue]{.underline}**. This function is not fixed. Historically, it has
changed more than once. More accurately: social theorists have
reconceptualized it more than once. At the transition from industrial to
post-industrial society, social movements changed from being the motor
of the anti-capitalist revolution to being the agent of post-material
identity politics (Inglehart, 1977). With the emergence of the risk
society (Beck, 1992) in the 1980s their function shifted -- or was
reconceptualized -- once again: from the agent of new politics to the
repository of societal capacities of reflexivity helping to manage new
risks emerging from technological progress and societal complexity. In
this same sense, the function of social movements may continue to
change, in particular when the ongoing process of modernization brings
about societal conditions which are in significant respects
categorically new.

In the next section I will argue that [the late-modern condition, or
denucleated modernity, represents such a new type of society which has
to cope with a very specific set of structural strains]{.underline}. On
this basis, the remainder of this article will then develop the
hypothesis that in this society **[post-conventional forms of political
articulation and participation fulfil a new function: they represent an
intra- societal physical and discursive space -- the theme park -- in
which individuals, social groups and society at large can perform and
experience key features of the traditional-modern condition which remain
indispensable even though late- modern society has clearly moved beyond
the traditional-modern phase.]{.underline}** It will be suggested that
in denucleated modernity **[this inner-societal performance of
traditional-modern features helps to stabilize the political and
economic systems which have become highly fragile because they are
functioning in an entirely self- referential manner and as purposes in
themselves]{.underline}**. Of course, this interpretation of social
movements as theme parks of traditional modernity is not supposed to
invalidate or replace existing analyses but merely to supplement them.

### Soft Left 

#### The 1AC's narrative of human rights and a humanitarian motivation for the plan is a guise to boost the political economy of neoliberalism and justifies a modern form of neointerventionsim that manifests into invasions of other countries and colonial slaughter of the global south

**Pitts 18** (Andrea J. Pitts is Assistant Professor of Philosophy at

philosophy, Latin American and U.S. Latinx philosophy, and critical
prison studies. "Humanist Battles and Embattled Humanists:

Accordingly, intra-state conflicts in Central America, Africa, and, as
classified by the U.S. National Security Decision Directives in 1987,
other conflicts "often localized, generally in the [Third
World]{.underline}" prior to the fall of the Berlin Wall were generally
interpreted as distinct from "conventional warfare." Dexter writes:
"rather than studying war per se, analysts \[during this period\] chose
to study the type of war that was most important to them, that of
conflict between great powers" (2007, 1060). Thus, during the Cold War,
conflict between "the [un-great powers" were "lumped together" and
"deintellectualized]{.underline}" (Smith 2003, 33). Accordingly, [during
the post-Cold War period, strategic military studies of the Global North
shifts to interpret contemporary conflict as "new" and as outstripping
the old paradigms of warfare]{.underline}. As Dexter states, the
violence in [Rwanda, Bosnia, or the "new terrorism" of the Islamic
State]{.underline} and of narcotraffickers [gets described as novel and
unprecedented]{.underline}. In this sense, the [measures used by Western
allied nation-states]{.underline} to respond to such violence also take
on "[new" dimensions and forms of justification]{.underline}. For
example, the framing of the post-Cold War era as giving rise to novel
forms of warfare that lack political or systematic demands relies on
conceptions of criminality, individual gain, and [conceptions of
lawlessness and criminality]{.underline}. Such conceptions of warfare
thereby [resituate Western allied nation-states as the defenders of
values that preserve human rights]{.underline}, cosmopolitanism, and
democratic participation. Within these terms, the lan[guage of
"civilians" also becomes an important moral category, whereby
"combatant" or "rebel" groups manipulate and victimize
civilians]{.underline} for their own ends. Dexter notes: Like the
[moralizing language of the Bush administration]{.underline} in the U.S.
and Tony Blair in the UK, new [war becomes a battle between good and
bad, the good being those have responded positively to globalization and
the bad those who have not]{.underline}. . . . Civilians are \[conceived
as\] not only amenable to politicization: they \[are also assumed\] to
favor a politics of inclusion, tolerance, and mutual respect. (2007,
1063) As such, "[new war" views legitimize Western intervention by
framing the motivations for violence and conflict as rooted in criminal
intent and personal gain. Narratives of rebel groups, insurgents,
terrorists, and so on as criminals effectively depoliticized the motives
of those engaged in conflict by abstracting actors from the historical
and political conditions that lead to conflict]{.underline} (1068).
David Chandler, a theorist of governance studies, makes the argument
that this depoliticization and the attribution of criminality
reclassifies intra-state warfare as conflict that is in need of
international policing and moral mediation through interventionist
efforts (Dexter 2007, 1068, quoting Chandler 2006). According to
Chandler, these interventionist efforts bring us to a tripartite
distinction made by Donald Rumsfeld, the U.S. Secretary of Defense from
2001 to 2006, that provide a somewhat con[cise framing of the shifts
within interventionist reasoning that track the language and ontology of
conceptions of neointerventionism]{.underline}. Namely, Rumsfeld's
statement in a news briefing in 2002, when asked about the relationship
between the government of Iraq and supply chains of weapons of mass
destruction to "extremist" groups, includes the following: "there are
known knows; there are things we know that we know. There are known
unknowns; that is to say, there are things that we now know we don't
know. But there are also unknown unknowns---there are things we do not
know we don't know" (Chandler 2014, 50). According to Chandler, the
"known knowns" in this statement suggest a modernist or li[beral
conception of interventionist strategizing wherein "linear and universal
assumptions of the progressive accumulation of knowledge of laws and
regularities of human affairs" structures decision making in
governance]{.underline} (50). In [political economy, he tracks this
conception of "top down" interventionism through Franklin Roosevelt's
New Deal policies in the U.S.]{.underline}, Keynesianism in the UK, and
Stalinism and Nazism in Russia and Germany. [Neoliberalism then emerges
post-WWII as a response to the extensions of the state during these
prior periods]{.underline}. He argues that "in the postwar period . . .
top-down interference could only lead to the erosion of liberal freedoms
and that active governance interventions necessarily had to work on the
basis of bottom-up understandings that worked on the pre-conditions
necessary for effective market and democratic systems" (52).1
[Neoliberalism then can be understood as the presumption of "known
unknowns," wherein political economists and intervening actors assume
complex conceptions of human life and decision making that resist direct
analysis and predictability]{.underline}. Accordingly, working from a
neoliberal model, the [stability or instability of markets become the
means to indirectly monitor the complex networks of motivations and
behaviors of the individuals within nation-states.]{.underline} This
[form of indirect governance]{.underline} also tracks the Cold War-era
conception of warfare described by Dexter. Namely, the managerial stance
of strategic studies during the Cold War period casts complexity and
political interest on the outcomes of market fluctuations and trade.
[After the fall of the Soviet Union]{.underline}, then, [interventionism
studies needed to be reframed]{.underline} around the problem of policy
interventions despite retaining "known unknowns." Such [epistemic gaps
could no longer be framed through proxy-wars]{.underline} or battles
between communism and capitalism. Chandler highlights World Bank policy
advisor Douglass North as one such strategist who considered further
operations at the level of human "consciousness" and "intentionality" a
necessity despite the apparent complexity of social interaction and
decision-making. Chandler writes: For Hayek \[an archetypical neoliberal
political economist, the problem of complex life and its governance\]
was never a problem as complex life was constituted as a hidden process
and as a boundary limit to governmental knowledge. [For neoliberalism as
a governing rationality, the contradictions gradually became clearer as
policy-makers claimed to be able to intervene in the sphere of the
'known unknowns' on the basis of 'correcting' processes of social
interaction, understood as systematic path-dependencies or endogenous
social, cultural and ideational constructions]{.underline}. (55)
Governance then, on this model, requires gathering information and
knowledge of the "known unknowns" to have a significant impact on the
outcomes that emerge through market regulations. Following this problem
within governance and interventionist strategizing, Chandler points to
the development of complexity theory and the language of "resilience."
He highlights, for instance, that the emergence of discourses about
"complexity"---both within quantum mechanics and the social
sciences---following World War I, Heisenberg's "uncertainty principle,"
JeanFrançoise Lyotard's critique of classical determinism in the 1970s,
and the development of "chaos theory" in the late 1980s were all
precursors to the governmental justifications for interventionist
efforts that arose in the early 2000s (48--50). Chandler argues that
this growing prominence of theories of complexity and emergent systems
eventually made their impact on military strategy and foreign relations
and arose as a reply to the shortcomings of neoliberal governance
models. [Resilience models, like neoliberalism, rely on views about the
complexity of human interactions and the "hidden processes" that give
rise to specific outcomes.]{.underline} However, unlike neoliberalism,
policy failures are, as the UK's 2013 National Adaptation Programme on
climate change suggests are not failures, but "a learning opportunity
with regard to the systemic process of unintended consequences and
side-effects in a complex world" (57). The only failures possible on the
resilience model are when policy makers and strategists do not "learn"
or adapt from the outcomes of a particular policy or interventionist
effort. To clarify this point, in a recent interview, political
philosopher, [Robin James described resilience thinking as a three-step
process: "Resilience is a specific type of therapeutic overcoming. It
has three steps: (1) perform damage so that others can see, feel, and
understand it; (2) recycle or overcome that damage, so that you come out
ahead of where you were even before the damage hit; (3) pay that surplus
value---that value added by recycling---to some hegemonic institution,
like white supremacist patriarchy, or capital, or the
State]{.underline}, something like that. This isn't just coping---it's a
very, very specific form of coping designed to get individuals to
perform the superficial trappings of recovery from deep, systemic
issues, all the while [reinforcing and intensifying the very systemic
issues it claims to solve]{.underline}." (James 2016)2 As such, ["good"
governance builds on the reflexive adaptation of human beings to
specific forms of trauma, such as physical, mental, and economic
violence, but appeals to the endurance of people and
institutions]{.underline} without "goal-based instrumental
policy-making" (Chandler 2014, 58). As such, for example,
[interventionist efforts to impact the "War on Drugs" in Latin America
have been reframed through resilience models that view the organization
of the transnational drug trade as ever-capable of adapting to market
and military strategies]{.underline} (Finkenbusch 2017, 66). [The
response, then, is to see how drug cartels and the communities impacted
by drug trafficking are "resilient," that is, as either upholding
civilian cosmopolitan and multicultural values, or in terms of the
resilience of criminality, deviance, and lawlessness, which thereby
justifies further intervening efforts]{.underline}. Peter Finkenbusch
argues, regarding the 2007 U.S.-Mexican security agreement called the
Mérida Initiative, that this U.S. interventionist effort tracks the
shifts between neoliberal interventionist models and resilience models.
Namely, this security agreement, he writes, "went within just a few
years from a rather straightforward, Cold War-type of arms deal
centering on law enforcement training and military equipment deliveries
to a comprehensive policy endeavor aimed at the promotion of good
governance, the protection of human rights and the inclusion of civil
society" (2017, 3). This shift to [viewing Mexican society and Mexican
institutions as "weak" or in need of further "support" in order to be
resilient to the ongoing patterns of drug-related crime thereby serves
to motivate neointerventionism]{.underline}. This form of
interventionism expands the scope of state-sponsored efforts from
"formal state institutions to informal social milieu and from technical
assistance and material resource transfers to capacity-building and
empowerment" (4). As Dexter argues, this shift thereby depoliticizes the
interventionist efforts that seek to reshape and control educational,
legal, economic, and cultural institutions of the Global South under the
auspices of strengthening the "social fabric" of "weak states." For
example, among the "Four Pillars" of the Mérida Initiative are efforts
aimed at "Institutionalizing Reforms to Sustain the Rule of Law and
Respect for Human Rights in Mexico" and "Building Strong and Resilient
Communities" (Seelke and Finklea 2017).

#### Threat of war and need for military spending is utilized as a way to stabilize economic growth

During the long postwar boom, [the vast bulk of [US military
expenditures]{.mark} were [designed to foster private capital
accumulation]{.mark} within the US economy [and]{.mark} to [stabilize
the economy during business cycles]{.mark}]{.underline}. In other words,
[they were designed mainly to prime the Keynesian pump of capital
accumulation and to stimulate the circulation of commodities during
business cycles]{.underline}. Military forces did intervene throughout
the Third World in the 1940s, \'50s and \'60s, but the [[size of]{.mark}
the [US military]{.mark} apparatus [cannot be explained]{.mark} by the
need to project power into these regions, or by a \"Soviet
threat.\"]{.underline} The [postwar US military buildup occurred at the
precise time (1948-53) when the USSR was economically, demographically
and militarily decimated. Into the 1970s, the constant theme in military
contracting was one of cost overruns, weapons that frequently failed to
meet specifications, the failure to deliver contract- specified numbers
of weapons (while the total sum of the contract was paid), the
construction of weapons systems that were then declared obsolete and
never used, and wanton profiteering]{.underline}. Moreover, [[military
spending fluctuated almost precisely]{.mark} and in a counteracting way
[with the business cycle]{.mark}.]{.underline} The [Pentagon had enough
equipment to fight two and one-half wars, but no opponents.]{.underline}
The chief purpose of all of this was capitalist planning in a nation so
ideologically beholden to the free market that no other form of
Keynesianism would work. The Marshall Plan and subsequent plans to prime
the pump of accumulation on a global scale (e.g., foreign aid, support
for the World Bank), had to be wrapped in the trappings of the Soviet
threat to gain support from the Congress, the media and the voting
populace. Other forms of the welfare state were developed grudgingly, if
at all, in small increments. [Military Keynesianism became the uniquely
US way to attempt to 16 extend and stabilize the growth of the economy
in the postwar period.]{.underline}20 Since the 1970s, US militarism has
been going through a process of transformation. [[Policymakers]{.mark}
continue to [use military expenditures to counter and]{.mark} to
[control]{.mark} the velocity and depth of the [economic
downturn]{.mark}]{.underline}, but unlike the Keynesians they are not
concerned with using military expenditures to create a high-wage economy
operating at near full-employment. Rather, they seek a low-wage, highly
productive economy to enhance the competitive position of the US in the
world market. Yet the state planners also seek a particular advantage
they long enjoyed in the Keynesian era privileged access to Third World
resources and markets. Partly this access is secured through the US
ability to dominate the capital lending process to debtor nations. But
monetary violence can only assure access to those caught in the web of
the debt trap. For the rest, [the [US]{.mark} has [placed]{.mark} a
heightened [emphasis on]{.mark} functional [militarism]{.mark}. Military
spending today has become secondarily Keynesian and primarily
functional: to intervene in the Third World. [Functional
militarism]{.mark}, still enveloped in the rhetoric of the \"Soviet
threat,\" [is designed to address]{.mark} what the Committee on the
Present Danger-new right factions see as [a dangerous drift toward Third
World autonomy]{.mark}]{.underline}. Renewed base construction
(especially in the Middle East and Central America), the creation of the
Rapid Deployment Force (now known as the Central Command), and the
emphasis on the conventional weapons buildup especially the Navy are the
major components of this program. [[Militarism]{.mark} is [one means by
which the US seeks to attain a prime niche in the evolving international
system]{.mark}. It aims at lowering costs of production via secure
long-term access to Third World raw materials, markets, and investment
opportunities.]{.underline} Here, in the military arena, the US has a
\"comparative advantage\" vis a vis the rival capitalist powers, with
its established military forces and bases and core of support at home
for intervention in the Third World. But the extent to which the Reagan
administration has been able to displace the \"Vietnam syndrome\" is
unclear. There does not seem to be a broad popular base in the US for
any prolonged and costly intervention. Another limiting factor is that
US allies/rivals like France and Britain have demonstrated a readiness
to intervene for their own purposes and to withold support for US
interventions. With the completion of the Siberian gas pipeline, the
Europeans are less dependent on US domination in the Middle East for
their oil supplies and may increasingly decline to follow the US lead in
the Third World.

[[The degradation of the environment is harming the livelihoods of many
of the world's poor]{.underline}]{.mark} (Millennium Ecosystem
Assessment, 2005b). [Household income for the rural poor often relies on
ecosystem services such as harvesting wild food, fuelwood, fodder,
medicinal plants, and timber, and constitutes a much higher proportion
of their income than that of wealthy families]{.underline} (Millennium
Ecosystem Assessment, 2005b). Now, [the privatization of public
resources means many people do not have a sufficient supply of or access
to ecosystem services, particularly indigenous peoples, forest dependent
communities, and other marginalized groups]{.underline} (Millennium
Ecosystem Assessment, 2005b). Many rural women in developing countries
now have an increased domestic labor demand as a result of degradation
of ecosystem services (Millennium Ecosystem Assessment, 2005b[). [Global
employment in food production, timber, and fisheries, has been
significantly affected by environmental degradation and climate change,
rendering insecure the livelihoods of millions of
people]{.mark}]{.underline} (Millennium Ecosystem Assessment, 2005b).

Social Conditions

[[The deregulation and privatization of health, education, and other
social services has had a damaging impact on employment across the
world]{.mark}]{.underline} (United Nations, 2007a). [State based systems
of social security are being dismantled, affecting not only the
livelihoods of social service sector workers, but the social protection
of all workers. In their place self regulation, fiscal regulation, and
privatized regulation have been substituted. At the same time the labor
market has undergone reregulation, not to enhance the security of 30
workers, but with the objective to increase the degree to which labor is
considered a commodity]{.underline} (United Nations, 2007a).

[[Sustained global economic growth has not led to increased formal
employment, but rather has had an opposite effect - "jobless growth"
wherein no jobs are created or they are created at a substantially lower
rate than that of economic growth]{.underline}]{.mark}. Consequently
there has been a tremendous increase in the global supply of labor,
contributing to lower wages and diminishing the bargaining power of
workers (United Nations, 2007a). Over supply of labor, the drastic
reduction throughout the world in union and organized labor membership,
and the effects of labor casualization have dramatically shifted power
to employers. As well deregulation and self regulation of the labor
market by unaccountable, non transparent commercial entities is
undermining national and even corporate autonomy (United Nations,
2007a).

**[[No matter how well an economic system may perform, how can it be
justified if it does not offer security, stability and hope for
improvement, if it does not offer assured access to basic needs, and to
opportunities for productive, creative work for the majority of the
world's population? Economic instability has increased during the neo
liberal period with a greater number of financial crises
occurring]{.underline}]{.mark}** (Chang, 2008). [There are already
mounting fears of global economic crises arising from the structural
problems and contradictions inherent in unregulated free market
economies]{.underline} (Coubard & Ganet, 2006), [and the notion of
endless economic growth]{.underline} (Soros, 1997) (Kolko, 2006).
[[There is]{.underline}]{.mark} 31 [[declining faith in neo liberal
policies and in the stability and value of the US dollar as the
international medium of exchange]{.underline}]{.mark}, and a world wide
recession or economic collapse may occur (United Nations, 2007b) with
ensuing unemployment and social unrest (Kotlikoff, 2008) (Roberts,
2006). Most importantly, the global economic and environmental crises
resulting from the integrated economies and homogenized cultures of the
dominant development paradigm, demonstrate a lack of resilience -
something which having a diversity of systems would provide (Weber et
al., 2007).

#### Capitalism has accelerated the divide between rich and poor -- inhibits access to financial opportunities and turns the case

[[Global inequality between richest and poorest countries and between
richest and poorest people has been increasing significantly over the
past 200 years]{.underline}]{.mark} (Jolly, 2006)\]. [There has been an
enormous divergence of growth rates between rich and poor countries in
the last decades]{.underline} with only the East Asian 'Tigers'
sustaining an increase in 15 that time (L. Taylor, 2006). [[Even in the
richest country, the US, there is increasing disparity and
poverty]{.underline}]{.mark} (Center For American Progress, 2007).
[[Despite many years of poverty alleviation programs by international
institutions and the international development industry,]{.mark} over
the past two decades income inequality has increased in almost all
countries, with only marginal income increases of the poorest
earners]{.underline} (International Monetary Fund, 2007) (Millennium
Ecosystem Assessment, 2005b) (L. Taylor, 2006). [[Approximately 1.1
billion people, most of them in rural areas and dependent on
agriculture, grazing, and hunting, earned less than one dollar a day of
income in 2001]{.mark}]{.underline} (Millennium Ecosystem Assessment,
2005b).

In 2006 the "two dollars a day" working poor decreased worldwide to 47
%, from 55 % in 1996. But [1.4 billion workers and their families were
living below the "two dollars a day" poverty line, while 507 million
workers and their families earned less than one dollar a day. An
estimated 20 % of the worlds youth, more than 200 million persons, live
on less than one dollar a day, while approximately half survive on less
than two dollars a day. Indigenous peoples and persons with disabilities
are disproportionally represented among the worlds poorest]{.underline}
(United Nations, 2007a).

Looking at a broader measure, the distribution of household wealth is
even more concentrated than the world distribution of income, or the
distribution of wealth within almost every country. Based on data for
the year 2000, [within country the top 10 % of wealth holders typically
own approximately 50 % of the wealth, while for the world as a whole the
share of the top 10 % was 85 %.]{.underline} The US and Canada, with
only 6 % of the 16 global population held 34 % of the world's wealth,
Europe 30 %, and the rich Asia Pacific group of countries, 24 %. The
remaining 12 % was shared by Africa, Central and South America, China,
India and other Asia Pacific countries. Of the top global 1 % of wealth

In recent decades there has been a decrease in the number of countries
under dictatorial governments, an increase in governments under a
multiparty electoral system, and increased recognition and observation
of human rights worldwide (Human Rights Watch, 2008).

According to Freedom House, as of 1999, 58 % of the world's population
were residing in electoral democracies in 119 countries, 85 of those
being liberal democracies - those considered free and respecting human
rights and the rule of law (Freedom House, 1999). 39

Representation

There is a sense though, that [democracies are not working either. There
is a low participation rate in electoral politics and declining respect
for the political class in many countries]{.underline} (Skidmore, 2008)
(Feffer, 2007) (Bello, 2005) (Reich, 2005a). [[There is growing
disenchantment with current models of representative democracy and
electoral politics which are antagonistic in nature]{.mark} and which
seek citizen input only at prescribed voting times. Some feel that
current models of representative democracy can not work; how can one
person represent a heterogeneous constituency? [More direct forms of
participation such as referenda, or more frequent elections, are claimed
by those in power to be too cumbersome, costly, and
unpopular]{.mark}.]{.underline}

[Central government is remote from the grassroots level. [People feel
disenfranchised]{.mark}, experiencing little or no consultation or
involvement in political decision making. [Their needs and interests are
ignored, while governments cater to elites, business, or even foreign
interests, and]{.mark} enter into agreements and enact policies which
are harmful to society at large, [trad]{.mark}ing [democratic
participation and civil liberties for the economic prosperity and
security of a few]{.mark}]{.underline} (Reich, 2005b) (Strange, 1996).
Raising money and obtaining corporate media approval still pose
significant structural barriers to attaining public office in most
democracies[; only the elites can participate.]{.underline}

The power of corporations over the political process is growing while
governments increasingly claim they are powerless and unable to act,
because of their obligations to 40 unrepresentative or undemocratic
international institutions such as the WTO, International Centre for
Settlement of Investment Disputes (ICSID), or to tyrannical "market
forces" (Reich, 2005a) (McQuaig, 1998).(Anderson, 2007) (Strange, 1996).
Powers invested in [[unaccountable international
organizations]{.underline}]{.mark} such as the WTO [[threaten local
democracy]{.underline}]{.mark}. These bodies have adopted a role as
gatekeeper, enacting international agreements as irrevocable
'constitutions' in order to 'defend public interests' such as in
international trade, against the actions of government, (World Trade
Organization, 2007) no matter what their populations democratically
expressed will.

Internationally, although many dictatorships have been overthrown, other
political models which have dubious democratic credentials, are
supplanting them (Human Rights Watch, 2008). **[[Political intervention
by western nations and civil society masquerading as "democracy
promotion" is in fact aimed at undermining real democracy so that the
electoral outcome will not threaten the elites]{.underline}]{.mark}**
(Robinson & Gindin, 2005) (Moises Naim, 2007) (Human Rights Watch,
2008). Other political models, seemingly more democratic, and opposed to
the prevailing global economic agenda, are under constant threat (Dwyer,
2006) (Hobsbawm, 2004).

[[The widespread dissatisfaction with]{.mark} contemporary models of
democracy, the i[naction and inability to act of governments and leaders

[[Education]{.underline}]{.mark}, as measured by enrollment and literacy
is improving in the developing and lesser developed countries, but the
[[rate of improvement is declining. The lesser developed countries in
particular have a long way to go to match the global

children, child laborers and those living in rural and conflict areas is
poor while some countries have made no progress]{.underline}]{.mark}

The primary net enrolment rate rose 17% in lesser developed countries
between 1991 to 2004 to 69%, significantly behind the world average of
86% (UNESCO, 2006). [Reductions in the rate of increase in enrollment
were seen over the period between 1980 and 2005 in secondary school
enrollment across all groups of countries, and in primary school
enrollment for the bottom 40%]{.underline} (Weisbrot et al., 2005). For
the lesser developed countries the rate of enrollment of girls in
primary and secondary school is between 80 to 90% that of boys, but at
the tertiary level it is less than 70% (UNESCO, 2006). In 2004
completion of primary education in lesser developed countries was only
53%, but for the world 86% (UNESCO, 2006).

## 2NC Alternatives 

### Centering Labor 

#### **The aff's positivist model of power produces neoliberal forms of politics that are reactionary in nature and leave the dominance of the market intact. The alternative is a negative analytic of subjectivity as labor. Centering labor as the basis of subjectivity is essential to dethroning the market logic that structures neoliberalism and makes transcending the alienation of labor possible.**

**Kerr 90**(Derek "Beheading the King and Enthroning the Market: A
Critique of Foucauldian Governmentality")//TB

**[[Within the literature on governmentality movement appears to come
from outside government, but why that movement occurs and how it effects
a change in government remains unspecified]{.mark}.]{.underline}** As
such, this literature (including Foucault\'s) cannot explain why the
form and practices of government change when they do, nor can it account
for the changing limits of government, apart from noting the mere fact
that government often fails due to unplanned outcomes, misap- plication
of techniques, etc. (e.g., Rose and Miller, 1992, 191). **[[These
weaknesses arise because, as elaborated above, Foucauldian govern-
mentality is derived from a top-down conception of power that ex-
ternalizes and marginalizes social subjectivity and takes as its focus
the problematic of rule]{.underline}]{.mark}**. Furthermore, this
derivation is one that tends to externalize state and government; it
focuses, uncritically, on a knowledge domain that defines government in
terms of \"its\" object: the \"population\" and \"liberty\" of the
market. Rather than recon- ceptualizing the state, the literature on
governmentality appears to retain a pre-modern notion of the state and
then marginalize in favor of a supposedly modern notion of government.
**[[The result is that governmentality becomes a depoliticized,
autonomous and gen- eralized \"mythicized abstraction]{.mark}\"22
[devoid of any constituting dynamic]{.mark}. [By transforming social
subjectivity into an object of government and by adopting an approach
that eschews value judgements, the Foucauld- ians can develop a
conception of power and governmentality that elimi- nates critique,
contradiction, crisis and the subject of
transcendence]{.mark}.]{.underline}** [**[The resulting conception is of
a positive, productive system of power and government that may be
\"modified\" but cannot be negated.]{.underline}** **[The best we can
expect, apparently, is the market \"freedoms\" enforced by the
neoliberal form of governmentality, with perhaps some safety net for
disadvantaged group]{.underline}**]{.mark}**[s]{.underline}**. However,
the \"heresy\" of reality (Bonefeld, 1991, 63) appears to contradict
this discourse on governmentality and points to the principle of
critique and negation within social forms. That is, rather than a
positive, productive system of power, the heresy of reality reveals a
governmentality that is constantly being disrupted and forced to
restructure itself, that is constantly embroiled in social crisis and
conflict, and that is constantly confronting limits constituted beyond
its reach. The heresy reveals that governmentality is positive and
productive, that is only because it reproduces the ideology of the
market. That ideology, as McNally (1993) demonstrates, is concerned
centrally with the creation and maintenance of a market in human
labor-power. It is this content, labor, that while remaining outside the
Foucauldian discourse constitutes the principle of its negation.

[**[In conclusion, then, Foucault\'s conceptual \"beheading of the
King\" constitutes a discourse within a top-down conception of power; it
is the standpoint of reproduction, of the permanence of power and the
sub- jugation of subjectivity]{.underline}**. **[The \"zone of
research\" labeled Foucauldian governmentality is therefore not a zone
of critical-revolutionary study, but one that conceptually reproduces
capitalist rule]{.underline}**]{.mark}. **[The zone is un- doubtedly of
political import, but it needs to be rethought from a political
perspective that reasserts the socialist critique of the tyranny of the
market. [What is required is a conceptualization that \"beheads\"
governmentality (and power) from the standpoint of
subjectivity]{.mark}]{.underline}**[; **[it suggests a Marxist analysis
grounded in the subjectivity of live
labo]{.underline}**]{.mark}**[r]{.underline}**. Foucault rightly
rejected certain Marxist discourses and Stalinist practices for their
reductionist tendencies and inadequate consideration of the actual
nature and rationale of governmental activity (e.g., Foucault, 1980a,
b). But while Foucault may have addressed the latter, he did so in a way
that shares much in common with the Marx- ism he rejected; that is, an
approach that reduces the subjectivity of live labor to a product of
power, or the \"forces of production,\" thereby creating a positive
theory of social reproduction. **[[What is required is a negative
theory, a theory of rupture and transcendence, not of repro- duction. A
Marxist theory of this type is one that grounds that nega- tion in the
creative and productive power of human practice]{.underline}]{.mark}**
(Holloway, 1993). **[[From this perspective, human practice, labor,
becomes the only constitutive power in society]{.underline}]{.mark}**.
This constitutive power is both productive and destructive, positive and
negative; and labor, so understood, is sub- jectivity. If society is
nothing but subjectivity (practice) and its objecti- fication, it
follows that society can only be understood subjectively, negatively,
from below. By \"re-centering\" subjectivity, critique does not have to
be applied from outside as in the governmentality literature. Rather,
critique becomes internal to the conceptualization, just as negation is
inherent in the constitutive power of social practice.

**[In capitalism, this negativity, this going beyond, expresses the
positive power of labor in negating its commodity status. That is, in
capitalism the only social power is labor, but labor divided against it-
self]{.underline}**. The division of labor against itself is a constant
conflict, a conflict between labor and its alienated form as capital.
Contrary to the Fou- cauldians\' exaltation of \"work\" (referred to
above) , therefore, work in capitalist society is turned against itself.
This negation of human cre- ativity takes place through the subjection
of human activity to the market. **[The resulting antagonism between
creativity and its negation can be referred to as the conflict between
labor and capital, but this conflict is not a conflict between two
external forces, between resistance, and power.]{.underline}** Rather
the conflict is internal to subjectivity, but subjectiv- ity existing
against itself in alienated form. Existence in capitalist soci- ety is
therefore an antagonistic and contradictory existence and marks the
social form of subjectivity as class struggle.

**[[This focus on subjectivity, social form and class is a focus on so-
cial constitution, and suggests that social relations take different
forms, such as the economic and political, but that these forms exist as
forms of the class relation]{.underline}]{.mark}** (Bonefeld and
Holloway, 1991; Bonefeld, et al, 1995; Clarke, 1978; Clarke, 1991). In
**[this approach, then, the state is not reduced to an institution or a
thing to be possessed]{.underline}**.24 **[Rather it is conceptualized
as a form of the social relations of pro- duction that preserves the
conditions of capital\'s existence: living labor]{.underline}**. This
preservation entails not just law and order but various forms of
economic and social policy intervention; hence state admin- istration is
implicit in the capitalist state form. But as living labor exists qua
contradiction in capitalist society, this preservation exists contra-
dictorily as rupture. State administration therefore becomes a con-
tradictory mode through which capital attempts to reproduce the
commodity form of labor power, i.e., the doubly free labor of liberal
democracy.25 It also follows that, as social form, the development of
the state (administration) can only be understood as a moment of the
antagonistic and crisis-ridden development of capitalist social re-
lations. **[Th[a]{.mark}t development expresses the power of labor
(social sub- jectivity), which cannot be contained within the forms of
capital but which constantly]{.underline}** **[overflows and forces
these forms to reconstitute themselves, to re-form, in order to contain
the uncontainable. The limits of state administration]{.underline}**,
then, reside not simply in maladminis- tration, as suggested by the
Foucauldians, but **[in the crisis-ridden nature of global capital
accumulation]{.underline}** (live labor as both productive and
destructive) **[as mediated through the national state
form]{.underline}** (Clarke, 1990; Bonefeld et al, 1995) . Crisis, a
notion absent from Foucauldian governmentality, shows the instability of
capitalist power and government: the established patterns of class
relations can no longer contain labor, can no longer suppress life.

**[[Liberalism and neoliberalism as a mode of governmentality, then,
does not mean freedom from the market]{.mark} (see Wood, 1995, 229-235),
[but rather reimposes the tyranny of the market and hence reproduces the
commodity status of labor power]{.mark}.]{.underline}** Only from the
standpoint of capital-as-a-thing can such power be seen to be positive
and produc- tive. But when capital is grasped as a social relation
grounded in alien- ated labor then things appear differently. **[[Not
only is Foucauldian governmentality seen to be complicit in the
reproduction of capital- ism, but the principle of its negation is
revealed]{.mark}. [Rather than Foucault\'s triangle of
\"discipline-governmentality-state\" as a positive system of power, we
see an antagonistic contradiction of negation; human creativity
attempting to transcend its alienated mode of existence and dethrone the
market]{.mark}]{.underline}**

### Communist Party 

#### The alternative is communist organizing. The question is not about degrees of shared concern, but the direction of our political energies. The affirmative's refusal to take up the Leninist question "what is to be done" isn't simply something missing from their project, but a negative stance which trades off with action.

**Thomas 13** (Peter, Lectures in the History of Political Thought at
Brunel University, London "The Communist Hypothesis and the Question of
Organization" *Theory & Event* 16, no. 4 muse.jhu.edu/article/530491)
NIJ

The Communist Hypothesis [The debate on the \'Idea of
Communism\']{.underline} that emerged in 2008 following Alain Badiou\'s
analysis of the electoral victory of Sarkozy, drawing upon a longer
history of vindications of communism over the last 30 years, was quickly
greeted with enthusiasm by prominent theorists from a wide range of
leftist political traditions.1 This discussion also [seems to have
stimulated a renewal of the energy and engagement that had marked the
most creative dimensions of the alternative globalization and anti-war
movements straddling the millennium. After the impasses those movements
confronted in what was sometimes seen as an \'interregnum\' at the
beginning of the global economic crisis]{.underline},2 [[the affirmation
of the]{.underline}]{.mark} \'Idea of Communism\' -- or perhaps even
more so, the more precise notion of a [[\'Communist Hypothesis\' --
offered the possibility of a renewed collective research project into
the viable forms of contemporary political
struggle]{.mark}.]{.underline}3 [Unexpectedly and audaciously, [the
positive programme of communism]{.mark}, and not simply negative
resistance to capitalist crisis, [became the horizon within which we
could comprehend and meet the challenges of the
present.]{.mark}]{.underline}4 As an ideological intervention, the
merits of this discussion are remarkable: it has given rise to a wide
ranging international discussion of the notion of communism that did not
occur even at the height of the alternative globalization and anti-war
movements, still struggling against the overdeteminations of the new
world order rhetoric of the 1990s.5 **[[What still remains more
difficult to ascertain]{.underline}]{.mark}**, however, **[[is the
nature of these discussions\' relationship to the organizational
debates]{.underline}]{.mark}** that have emerged in the wake of Occupy,
international anti-austerity protests and the \'actually existing\'
revolutionary movements of our times. Some important contemporary
theorists have argued that the discussion of the idea of communism
should keep a distance from immediate organizational questions. In
particular, Badiou has strongly resisted the notion that the affirmation
of communism should necessarily be accompanied by a renewed
consideration of the role of the political party, as decisive agent of
that idea\'s realization, which he instead regards as an historically
superseded instantiation of \'communist invariants\' that are today
searching for a new mode of historical existence.6 By far the most
widespread response, however, has been the proposal that [a coherent
investigation of the meaning of communism today necessarily requires a
reconsideration of the nature of political power, of political
organization, and]{.underline}, above all, of [the
party-form]{.underline}.7 [Žižek]{.underline}, for instance, [has long
argued that a politics without the party is nothing more than a form of
\'politics without politics.\']{.underline} More recently, Jodi [Dean
has emphasized that [the reproposition of the party-form is the horizon
within which the debate on communism can become intelligible to
itself.]{.mark}]{.underline} Far from the caricature of homogenous or
\'totalitarian\' unity, [Dean argues that [the
party]{.mark}]{.underline} -- and the Leninist party in particular --
[[should be understood as constituting a \'vehicle for maintaining a
specific gap of desire, the collective desire for
collectivity\']{.underline}]{.mark} (Dean 2012, 207). She further argues
that [such a dynamic has already been evident in the achievements of
Occupy]{.underline}, whatever the \'anti-verticalist\' claims sometimes
made on its behalf. In a related vein, Jan Rehmann (2013) has argued
that the nascent counter-hegemonic dimensions of Occupy, alongside
regroupment processes on the European left, have prepared the ground for
a serious reproposal of the question of the mass political party. In
particular, [Rehmann argues that [a renewal of the party will involve
experimentation in new party forms]{.mark}, including notions such as
those of a \'mosaic left\']{.underline} (Urban 2009) [or a \'connective
party\']{.underline} (Porcaro 2012). These are positions close to those
advocated by one of the original proponents of the debate on communism,
the sadly departed Daniel Bensaïd, who repeatedly argued over many years
that [[the concept of the party remains central]{.mark} to any coherent
reflection on the nature and form of politics in the contemporary world,
[whether or not the word \'party\' itself is used to describe those
processes of unification, coordination and
decision]{.mark}.]{.underline} For Bensaïd, [it is the specificity of
the overdetermined field of political relations and its irreducibility
to the social that continually reproposes the question of the party-form
-- not as a solution, but as a problem that each upsurge of social and
political struggle involving diverging and sometimes conflicting
component elements inevitably confronts. This constitutive tension
generates the need for continuous interpretative and analytical labor,
in the attempt to discover the party-form adequate to the specificity of
the social movements to which it gives expression, at the same time as
it transforms them by translating their demands into the distinctive
register of politics]{.underline} (Bensaïd 2002, 112 et sq). [Above all,
however, it has been practical experience of the contradictory processes
of left regroupment on an international scale -- from reconfigurations
over the last decade on the Latin American left, to the varying success
of coalition parties in Europe such as Die Linke in Germany, Izquierda
Unida in Spain, Syriza in Greece and the Front de Gauche in France, to
the tentative emergence of new political formations across North Africa
and the Arab world -- that has firmly placed the question of the party
back on the contemporary agenda. **[The communist horizon]{.mark} thus
now [confronts its own horizon of intelligibility]{.mark} not simply in
a discussion of the party-form, but [in the dialectical relation between
such theoretical debates and the organizational innovations of the real
movements of today]{.mark}**]{.underline}, to paraphrase the now
oft-quoted words of the German Ideology, **[[that aim to abolish the
present state of affairs]{.underline}]{.mark}** (MECW 5, 49). The
Horizon of the Party-Form In this text, [I want to explore some of the
consequences of the notion of a communist hypothesis in relation to
these organizational debates, and in particular, to the emerging debate
regarding the adequate party-form for radical politics
today.]{.underline} First, I will argue that [the sometimes obscure
organizational implications of the generic affirmation of communism
become clearer when we situate this discussion historically, as a
transposition and continuation \'by philosophical means\' of some of the
central debates of the alternative globalization movement.]{.underline}
For despite the exaggerated claims to novelty of both friend and foe
alike, the debate on communism did not emerge from nowhere. Rather, I
argue that it should be understood as representing the displacement into
a theoretical register of central themes of the previous sequences of
struggles against the \'new world order\' in the late 1990s and early
2000s. In the same way, [the [new movements]{.mark} that [have]{.mark}
fortuitously [coincided with the debate on communism]{.mark} -- student
movements across North America and Europe from 2009 onwards, the global
wave of Occupy, the ongoing Arab revolutions and growing anti-austerity
movements around the world throughout 2012 -- represent not a return or
rebirth of history, but its revenge.8 [They should be understood as
expressions of the accumulation, displacement and transformation of
tendencies from the previous cycle of mass struggles that that have been
surreptitiously burrowing away,]{.mark} like Marx\'s old mole, under the
surface of what we can now see was only an apparent and decidedly
temporary pacification of the \'interregnum\' of the middle years of the
last decade.]{.underline} The \'spontaneous rediscovery\' by the moment
of Occupy of the aporiai that plagued the alternative globalization and
anti-war movements, however, indicate a substantial continuity of
unresolved problems across the different conjunctures of the ebbs and
floods of the social and political movements of the last 15 years. [As a
formalized response and proposed resolution to some of these themes, the
discussion of communism can help to clarify both the strengths and
limits of these debates, particularly those that are still strongly
operative in the post-Occupy conjuncture.]{.underline} Second, I then
aim to explore some significant models of organization that emerged in
previous periods in which the renewal of communist politics was closely
linked to attempts to rethink the party-form. For from the Manifesto of
the Communist Party onwards[, **[communism, as word, idea and
hypothesis, has always been inseparably tied to the forms of political
organization necessary for its realization]{.underline}**]{.mark}: in
the terms of the classical Marxist debates, the \'question of
organization\' \[die Organisationsfrage\]. The models that I will
consider are, first, the notion of the \'compositional party\' derived
from the experience of Italian operaismo, recently -- and perhaps
surprisingly -- reproposed in Hardt and Negri\'s Commonwealth; second,
the conceptualization of the party as a \'laboratory\' in which a
unitary \'political subject\' could be forged, theorized most coherently
in the work of the early Lukács; and third, Gramsci\'s call for the
formation of a \'modern Prince\' as a harnessing of the inherent
conflictuality of political modernity in a constituent party-form. Each
of these models can be regarded as a mirror in which we can see
reflected some of the challenges of the organizational questions that
have marked both the alternative globalization movement and the
rebellions and revolts of today. Hardt and Negri\'s notion of a
compositional party composed of \'insurrectional intersections\' of
irreducible singularities responds to the problem of thinking the
party-form in a period of the proliferation of demands and movements
grounded in diverse experiences of capitalist exploitation and
oppression. Lukács\'s proposal of the party as a laboratory for the
forging of a totalizing political subject poses the question of the
party-form as one of the unification and coordination of political
initiatives. Both of these models, I will argue, ultimately confront the
limitations of a political formalism, which runs the risk of invoking a
political party-form as the resolution of the contradictions of the
social practices that are thereby interpellated as its subaltern
content. [Gramsci\'s modern Prince]{.underline}, on the other hand,
[integrates both compositional and totalizing dimensions, while avoiding
the temptation of a formalistic resolution of the contradictions that
are the necessary preconditions -- and enduring challenge -- of
political organization. Rather than the elimination of difference, the
assertion of identity or the dominance of political form over social
content, the modern Prince represents the outlines of a party-form that
would be capable of valorizing contradiction and conflict, harnessing
them as the motor of its totalizing development.]{.underline} In these
sense, [the modern Prince can be understood as a proposal for a type of
\'expansive\' party-form that might be able to respond productively to
the challenges of contemporary movements.]{.underline}

[[Dedevelopment is a global endeavor to dismantle or abandon
unsustainable and inequitable systems of exploitation and social
control, to support the establishment, growth, or restoration of
sustainable, equitable systems, and to redress the harm brought about by
exploitation.]{.mark}]{.underline}

[[It is apparent that the prevailing human built systems are
insufficient and inappropriate to sustain the planet. A radical change
of direction is called for]{.mark}; it is vital to break many of the old
dysfunctional patterns and to look ahead to a different way of being.
Whereas mankind has invested his security and survival in tribes,
nations, and the accumulation of wealth, [it is time to]{.mark} assure
mankind's survival and wellbeing by [invest]{.mark}ing instead [in the
survival of the earth]{.mark}]{.underline}. 62

For many there is a disconnect between the goals of accumulation of
wealth and economic growth, and the goals of happiness and security (New
Economics Foundation, 2006). [[We should ask ourselves fundamental
questions about the kind of world we desire, what future and what kinds
of social arrangements are sustainable and socially
just.]{.underline}]{.mark}

[[If we seek sustainability and social justice, and if we agree]{.mark}
that the earth and its resources are not only for the strongest, the
richest, or for those who arrived there first, and that [in order to
survive we need to share the earth, then we can also agree that a
lowering of expectations of the material comfort]{.mark}]{.underline}
(Christian Aid, 2000) and security many of us wish to achieve, the
global redistribution of wealth and resources, and restitution for past
and ongoing harm and exploitation [[are necessary.]{.underline}]{.mark}

Can dedevelopment progress beyond these previous efforts and help to
achieve global, lasting change?

[[Dedevelopment is based on principles of sustainability, social
justice, and equity.]{.mark} Global social justice and equity are seen
as necessary conditions for sustainability. Sustainability means to
examine the logical extension of one's behavior and actions, globally
and over generations, to determine whether the survival of the planet is
endangered. Social justice involves the achievement of equity. [Equity
demands equal respect for and fair treatment of all persons. It means
the fair distribution of the benefits of human development and of the
earth's resources. Equity is]{.mark} stewardship of the
planet]{.underline} (Boyce, 2007) - [[attaining balance in the use of
resources]{.mark}, not only locally, but across the globe, [and
considering the needs of future generations. Equity]{.mark} then
[implies global redistribution of wealth and resources, and restitution
for past and ongoing harm inflicted by colonization, theft, and
exploitation]{.mark}]{.underline} (KAIROS, 2002) (Cavanagh & Mander,
2002). Dedevelopment calls for a deliberate lowering of the material
standard of living of those who consume more than their fair share, and
the raising of the living standards and security of the disadvantaged to
an equitable, sustainable level (Jolly, 2006). 70

[[Dedev]{.mark}elopment [is a recognition of the commonality of the
disadvantaged throughout the world, and calls for dismantling of the
fundamental unsustainable and inequitable relationships]{.mark} -- have
and have not, powerful and powerless. [Dedev]{.mark}elopment [involves
the dismantling or disestablishment of the social controls --]{.mark}
corporate mass media, knowledge and belief systems, and security systems
-- the [rights, laws, hierarchy]{.mark} and [governance structures, and
security apparatus which serve to promote and safeguard systems of
exploitation. It means the creation of new rights and notions of
justice, and the creation or rebuilding of sustainable social organisms
and relations.]{.mark} It seeks [to bring about a fundamental
reorientation of the prevailing systems of culture and
values]{.mark}.]{.underline}

[Dedevelopment calls for the dismantling or counterdevelopment, of
systems of exploitation - economic ideologies, money and financial
systems, international trade and development institutions, corporations,
and the dominant model of ownership. [It seeks the abandonment of
dependencies on nations and hierarchy; it rejects reliance on technical
and economic solutions, and calls for an embrace of independence, self
sufficiency, cooperation, and interdependence -- on family, community,
and the environment]{.mark}]{.underline} (Earth Charter Initiative,
2000).

[Dedevelopment entails a cessation of or reversal of many tendencies
associated with western industrial society. [It seeks the dismantling of
unsustainable life support systems]{.mark} - settlements, habitat,
agriculture, infrastructure, and business]{.underline} (Goldsmith,
1988). 71

[[Dedev]{.mark}elopment [stands against the homogenization of the
planet]{.mark}]{.underline} (Cavanagh & Mander, 2002) (Latouche, 1996)
[and calls for an end to the hegemony of western society and industrial
civilization]{.underline}. [It]{.underline} calls for an immediate halt
to the invasion and destruction of other forms of social organization
[[and]{.mark} instead [seeks to preserve and promote a diversity of
sustainable models of social organization]{.mark}.]{.underline}

[[Dedev]{.mark}elopment [is challenging the inevitability]{.mark},
"there is no alternative", the faith in, and the subservience to
systems - economics, security, science and technology, and reasserting
peoples control over them. [Dedev]{.mark}elopment [means to redefine and
set the terms of discourse. It means to question, resist, and reject
orthodoxy.]{.mark} It means to challenge the psychology of our times --
especially the prevailing western notions of 'normal' and social
pathology]{.underline} (Soong, 2006a).

**[[Dedevelopment does not advocate a particular solution or political
ideology. It rejects ideology and labels which can be used to divide. It
is a call to unite under a set of principles which can serve to sustain
the planet.]{.mark}]{.underline}**

Dedevelopment then, is not specifically an anti technology, anti global,
or anti civilization movement; it is not necessarily concerned with the
promotion of voluntary simplicity, or primitivism; nor need it be a
religious or spiritual movement. [[Dedev]{.mark}elopment [is beginning a
conversation]{.mark}. There is room for the many answers in whatever
form they may be which embody sustainability, social justice, and
equity.]{.underline}

[How would the ideas and principles of dedevelopment look in concrete
form?]{.underline} How would it be implemented, by whom, and in what
way? What are examples of movement along the path to a more sustainable
and equitable world?

[[Dismantling social controls will most probably entail a rebalancing in
the stature and power of western industrialized countries]{.mark}, of
the rich and elites, and result in the rise of lesser developed
countries, and of the influence of the poor and marginalized. Instead of
the current north / south dichotomy, [a global realignment of the poor
and of those who support sustainability, social justice, and equity may
come to be seen.]{.mark}]{.underline}

For the wealthy and elites throughout the world, dismantling systems of
exploitation will likely involve a decline in their material standard of
living; but for the poor, it will hopefully lead to an improvement in
their physical well being and security. [[Global commerce will come to
be supplanted by local, socially oriented systems]{.mark}.]{.underline}
A halt to or substantial reduction in unequal trade with the exploited
countries of the south can be foreseen, and ultimately, as part of the
process of restitution for past exploitation, a reversal in the current
south to north direction of the transfer of wealth and resources.

To dedevelop the unsustainable physical and social life support
systems - settlements, habitat, agriculture, infrastructure, industry
and labor, new tools, techniques, and knowledge will undoubtedly have to
be acquired. [[We will]{.mark} have to [learn how to dismantle and
recycle our existing wasteful and unsustainable physical infrastructure
and support]{.mark} 73 [systems]{.mark}]{.underline} (Orlov, 2005)
(Kunstler, 2006) (Doyle et al., 2008) [and to replace them with
sustainable, local, holistic systems]{.underline}.

8.1. DEDEVELOPING SOCIAL CONTROL

If systems of exploitation are to be dismantled or abandoned, there is
little that can be accomplished without broad based support. [To
obtain]{.underline} that [support it may be necessary to dismantle or
disestablish the systems which shape and control thought and behavior
and which encourage or permit exploitative and unsustainable practices
to occur, that is - dedeveloping minds. In practice, this may mean
dismantling significant aspects of corporate media, knowledge systems,
contemporary consumer culture, legal and security systems, and
governance structures, and creating or rebuilding sustainable and
equitable entities to occupy those spaces.]{.underline}

8.1.1. Dedeveloping Minds

To achieve a fundamental transformation of the mind it is desirable to
have democratic control over the systems and processes which influence
it, and maintain an environment which is open and receptive to learning,
and to the free exchange of information and ideas. [[Changing the mind
is also about exposing reality]{.mark} - looking for example at the real
nature of exploitation, conflict, poverty, and environmental
degradation]{.underline} (Farmer, 2006). [[Changing the mind means to
deconstruct the language and terms of discussion, social, political, and
economic paradigms, measures of progress and
success]{.underline}]{.mark} (Sale, 1999), [[so as to determine how to
make sustainability and social justice the foundations of life on
earth.]{.underline}]{.mark}

#### There are a multitude of ways that dedevelopment could take place. Support for the movement is growing.

**[[The idea of dedevelopment is not a new one; the first steps to
dedev]{.mark}elopment [have already been taken. Initiatives in favor of
dedev]{.mark}elopment [are now mounting in response to the effects of
climate change, the increasing cost of energy, and the current global
economic and food crises]{.mark}]{.underline}**. 63

[E. F. [Schumacher]{.mark}]{.underline}

One of the earliest to acknowledge the need for a fundamentally
different economic paradigm was E. F. Schumacher. His influential book,
Small Is Beautiful, criticized the modern growth and efficiency oriented
economy as unsustainable (Schumacher, 1974). His [Buddhism inspired
economics [advocated maximizing human well being with the minimum amount
of consumption]{.mark}.]{.underline} In contrast to the bigger is better
mindset, [he proposed that the most appropriate scale and technology for
an activity should be employed.]{.underline}

Dag Hammarskjöld Report

[[The Dag Hammarskjöld Report]{.underline}]{.mark} of 1975 recognized
that international development, economic relations, and social
institutions were in crisis as a result of a global system of
exploitation which principally benefited the power structure of the
industrialized world (Dag Hammarskjöld Foundation, 1975). [The report
[called for the transformation of social, economic, and political
institutions, the reorientation of science and technology towards social
development, and improved public information]{.mark}]{.underline}. The
Third World capability for self reliant development should be
strengthened. To accomplish these tasks [the report proposed that a
world authority to manage mankind\'s common heritage be established, and
that the UN system be adapted to these new requirements.]{.underline}

Edward Goldsmith

[Edward [Goldsmith]{.mark}]{.underline}, writing in the Ecologist and
Blueprint for Survival (Goldsmith, Allen, Allaby, Davoll, & Lawrence,
1974); [argued that the western economic and social 64 trajectories were
unsustainable]{.underline}. [He [advocated that society be entirely
reformed and that small decentralized communities were the most
appropriate form of social organization]{.mark}]{.underline}. Later, in
The Great U Turn (Goldsmith, 1988) [he identified industrialization as
the root cause of the ecological and social crises. He suggested that
the solution to the crises lay in deindustrialization, reversing
progress, reverting to smaller scale societies and communities, and
learning from tribal societies.]{.underline} In looking back at the fall
of the roman empire, Goldsmith contended that their leaders chose more
politically palatable short term measures intended to ameliorate the
situation rather than tackling the root cause of the problems. Goldsmith
warned that [we should not succumb to such political expediency; the
current political and economic systems should be radically transformed,
and he proposed one of the most far reaching programs for
deindustrializing society.]{.underline}

F.E. Trainer

F.E. Trainer in his book Abandon Affluence (Trainer, 1985) asserted that
the predominantly western affluent lifestyle is unsustainable and that
there are insufficient global resources for it to be attained by all.
[The western affluent lifestyle was responsible for a host of
environmental problems, promoted third world poverty and under
development, and increased the risk of conflict over resources. [The
problem was]{.mark} a [structural]{.mark} one - [an economic system
based on infinite growth]{.mark}. [Trainer contended]{.mark} this
economic system should be dedeveloped and in its place built [an
alternative society based on simplicity and values which emphasize
frugality, self sufficiency, and cooperation]{.mark}]{.underline}. 65

Ivan Illich

[Ivan [Illich]{.mark}]{.underline} was a long time critic of western
society and its institutions of education, religion, service, work, and
medicine, which he believed were counter productive, corrupting human
nature and alienating people from their real needs. He [was opposed to
economic development and to the North American development model in
particular, rejecting the notion of progress, and questioning why work
had become the focus of society.]{.underline} In works such as
Deschooling Society (Illich, 1976a), Medical Nemesis (Illich, 1976b),
and Tools For Conviviality (Illich, 1973), [Illich argued that as
technology and social institutions become more complex, the less control
we have over them while at the same time we become more dependent on
them. He called for the deinstitutionalization of society, the
disestablishment of schools, and restraint in the use of science. He
[was an advocate of small scale technology, asceticism, and withdrawal
from contemporary society.]{.mark}]{.underline}

### Maoism 

#### our alternative a maoist, centrally planned economy based on the creation of a vanguard that preaches the dialectic

**Lotta 94** (Raymond, *Maoist Economics and the Revolutionary Road to
Communism: The Shanghai Textbook*, 1994)

It has been observed that [Western economists often encountered great
difficulty in making sense of the Chinese planning system]{.underline}
because so many noneconomic objectives were fed into it. [Revolutionary
China's standards of economic performance were far broader than the
achievement]{.underline} (and overachievement) [of production targets.
The revolutionaries weighed the social and long-run economic effects of
economic development]{.underline}. In assessing the efficiency of
particular production methods, techniques, and factory organization,
[the revolutionaries widened the very concept of efficiency to include
the social benefits and educational side-effects]{.underline}, as well
as the contribution to local developmental needs, of such processes and
forms of organization.\[5\] And [the Maoists did not
accept]{.underline}, indeed they deliberately struggled against, [the
supposed "logic" of modern industrialization]{.underline}---the idea
that economic development necessarily implies big and concentrated
industry, massive urbanization, and regional specialization. In terms of
plan fulfillment, [quantitative goals]{.underline} were important and
had operational significance at the national and enterprise level. But
these [were secondary to]{.underline} and served [qualitative
goals]{.underline} (for instance, [the important thing for a factory
producing agricultural equipment was not simply that it meet its
financial targets but that it really understand the needs of agriculture
and strive to do a better job in meeting those needs]{.underline}). In
working out and evaluating plans, the insistence on [putting politics in
command entailed subordinating individual and sectoral]{.underline}
(this or that branch of industry or particular region's) [interests to
the collective interest and to advancing revolution; relying on the
masses; acting in accordance with what was called the "general line" on
economic development of "going all out, aiming high and achieving
greater, faster, better and more economical results in building
socialism]{.underline}"; and implementing a series of principles which
included "be prepared against war, be prepared against natural
disasters, and [do everything for the people]{.underline}" and "taking
agriculture as the foundation and industry as the leading factor." All
this had very real practical consequences. Here we can delineate four
significant elements of socialist planning, both with respect to its
goals and its methods that reflected and served the "politics in
command" orientation. 6 First, the Western pattern of industrial
investment and urban growth was rejected. [China sought to disperse
industry and prevent the uncontrolled growth of cities]{.underline} and
the clustering of industry around large cities. In fact, [for the first
time in history a process of industrialization was not simultaneously a
process of unrestrained urbanization. Efforts were made to]{.underline}
stabilize (or reduce) the size of large cities and to promote the growth
of small and medium-sized cities, to shift industry to such cities, and
to site new industrial zones on the outskirts of cities to better cope
with residential needs and [control]{.underline} of
[pollution]{.underline}.\[6\] Industrial [policy was also
aimed]{.underline}, as mentioned earlier, [at narrowing regional growth
and income differentials. The planning system facilitated the
development of relatively independent and comprehensive industrial
systems in each of China's provinces and encouraged self-sufficiency in
grain production]{.underline}. New kinds of production complexes in
which industry would be more directly integrated with agriculture, and
residence with work, were created. China's industry was oriented toward
serving agriculture, at the same time that rural industrial and
technical networks were promoted as a means of harnessing productive
potential in the countryside and reducing the social gaps between town
and countryside. By 1973-75, rural small-scale industry accounted for
close to 60 percent of China's cement and fertilizer output, 35 percent
of its hydroelectric power generating capacity, and 15 percent of its
steel output.\[7\] Most farm machinery and equipment, except for the
heaviest, was produced in local small and medium-scale plants. But [not
only did these policies begin to profoundly break down age-old patterns
of economic and social development in which cities ruled over the
countryside]{.underline}, and not only did such policies contribute
towards narrowing the difference between mental and manual labor. [These
measures also contributed to a profound break with the imperialist world
economy]{.underline} and the dependency that imperialism foists on
oppressed nations. There was an important strategic dimension here. [The
self-reliant, self-generating, and decentralized development that China
embarked on would enable it to better stand up to imperialism's economic
pressure, to resist possible attack and invasion, and to do more to
serve the needs of the world revolution]{.underline}. Second, [plan was
primary, price was secondary]{.underline}. At the society level,
profits, prices, and various financial measures of capital effectiveness
could not determine where investments would be made, what would be
produced, the rate and direction of technological change, or the purpose
of enterprise activities. [If price and profit were made principal, the
state could not redistribute investment resources from the richer
regions to the less developed regions. Neither could it encourage the
development of industries supporting agriculture]{.underline} which
themselves were not highly profitable, nor increase the output and
subsidize the selling price of basic consumption goods, [nor extend
comradely aid to revolutionary movements]{.underline}. The structure of
prices was still connected to underlying cost conditions; prices were
not totally arbitrary. But prices [were set consciously and
uniformly]{.underline} (throughout the country) [to achieve certain
goals]{.underline}. They reflected political line. One striking example
was how the price system favored agriculture (and the peasantry) in the
terms of trade between industry and agriculture: prices were kept low
for agricultural equipment and fertilizer, while the prices paid by the
state for agricultural produce were raised (which is totally opposite to
what typically happens in Third World countries). Prices and monetary
return could not be allowed to play an autonomous guiding function in
the economy. At the enterprise level, making plan primary over price
meant that the [costs and benefits of economic activities could not be
calculated in narrow financial terms or judged from the narrow point of
view of maximizing the income of the individual production
unit.]{.underline} As the revolutionaries explained: 7 In some cases,
judging from appearances, the loss might be bigger than the profit to an
individual factory. However, [judged from the overall situation, the
profit]{.underline} \[the overall benefit to society\] [might be bigger
than the loss]{.underline}.... If we are concerned only with petty
profits and ignore the major issues, if we pay attention only to the
present and not the future, if we only take care of our own unit instead
of considering the overall situation, and if we exert efforts only in
proportion to the amount of \[individual\] gains expected, we must have
been poisoned by the...theory of putting profits in command.\[8\] Was it
enough simply to fulfill the production plan regardless of the larger
social costs, such as worker alienation, harm to worker health, and harm
to the environment? These were issues which the Maoists insisted could
not be treated as separate problems of secondary importance. Enterprise
efficiency (or profitability) could not be placed above everything else:
[individual units had to take into account the needs of the whole of
society, and workers and staff had to be guided by the spirit of doing
anything of benefit to the people]{.underline}. The revolutionaries
insisted that costs and benefits could not be determined on the basis of
immediate monetary return. What if worker initiative created temporary
problems in production---should strict fulfillment of plan targets be an
excuse to suppress workers? A common experience in factories in the
years prior to the Cultural Revolution was that when workers pioneered
new designs and methods of production, they would often be disciplined
and punished by managers. These managers worried that such innovations
would disrupt established practices and thereby threaten the fulfillment
of quantitative plan targets (and their bonuses). This attitude towards
plan fulfillment and this contempt for workers came under sharp attack
[during the Cultural Revolution]{.underline}. As a result, [an
atmosphere was created that encouraged workers to break with all kinds
of convention, whether in building ships in ways that had never been
attempted before in China or in rethinking machine design. This had the
long-run effect of promoting production.]{.underline} Pro-market
ideologues attack socialism as a system where quantities mean
everything, where factories just churn out shoddy goods to meet
production quotas. This is the so-called "planfulfillment-indicator
problem"---in other words, managers simply do whatever is easiest to
meet production (and value) targets, even if it means disregard for
quality.\[9\] Actually, one of the issues of struggle between the
Maoists and the [capitalist roaders (who]{.underline} now [run
China]{.underline}) concerned precisely whether revisionist forms of
management, which one-sidedly [emphasized quantity]{.underline} or
financial return, [and]{.underline} which in general [took a narrow
approach to plan fulfillment to the detriment of party and state
goals]{.underline}, would dominate economic management. [In
revolutionary China, success indicators cut against the "tonnage
mentality" of Soviet-type planning]{.underline}. Indeed, one of the
slogans raised by dock workers and popularized during the Cultural
Revolution was "Be masters of the wharves, not slaves to tonnage." In
judging output performance, the primary concern was whether resources
and output were serving larger policy goals; getting the right mix and
quality of products and promoting socialist enterprise cooperation were
more important than output value or rate of return. [The key yardstick
was neither price nor quantity but social use values]{.underline} (that
which serves the needs of society) and the overall content and direction
of economic activity. This is not to say that cost-accounting and
efficiency were abandoned. On the contrary, great efforts were made to
minimize expenditure, to reduce cost, and ensure output quality. But
this became the responsibility of the workers, both through forms of
group accounting, analysis of 8 economic activities, and financial
management, and through mass movements to innovate and cut costs.
Managing, Administering, and Motivating Through Politics Third,
industrial organization and management were socialized and
revolutionized. [Plan objectives included limiting the alienation and
social fragmentation that accompanies job specialization. Craft
distinctions were broken down]{.underline}, personnel were periodically
rotated between jobs (and factories would dispatch workers into the
countryside as well), [oppressive work rules were discarded, and bonus
systems that pitted workers against one another were
eliminated]{.underline}. Technicians were trained from among workers,
and technicians and workers joined together in technical innovation
teams. Collective forms of management were developed, and management was
simplified. Enterprise leaders would spend regular periods working on
the shop floor. The industrial enterprise was more than a self-contained
economic unit: it would cooperate with others, even at the expense of
short-term gains, it would take account of local community needs and
social services, and, above all, it would be redefined as a site of
political and class struggle. Fourth, the economy was administered
mainly through political and ideological means. For a plan to be
effective, there must be a society-wide commitment to carry it through.
Otherwise, there can be no real coordination, no real planning. This
objectively poses the question of "compliance"---with the goals and
norms of a plan as it is transmitted and translated at different levels,
especially at the industrial enterprise level. Capitalist theorists
contend that socialist planning authority is faced with the insuperable
task of coaxing and pressuring enterprise managers to implement a plan's
mandates. The problem is said to derive from plans that are
unrealistically conceived and from the necessarily clashing perspectives
of planners and managers. The result, according to the bourgeois
account, is a tug-of-war between planning and managerial authority that
grows wearying and which eventually resolves itself institutionally into
a planning system characterized by the repressive and unresponsive
transmission of directives from above and by passive and pragmatic
adaptation from below. Plan execution is an imperative task of a
socialist economy. But how is this to be conceptualized? During the
period that the Soviet Union was socialist, plan coordination and
implementation were generally viewed as regulatory issues, and
enterprise compliance was exacted through a control and inspection
network that tended to bureaucratically expand. [The Maoist
revolutionaries summed up that an administrative system that tries to
rule by regulation and that mainly tries to police people into sticking
by regulation would not only become excessively bureaucratic but also
wouldn't work]{.underline}. It is relatively easy for any level of
authority to get around external controls and regulations issued from
above. As Mao pointed out in 1957, "regulations alone will not
work...men's minds must change."\[10\] [Thus the importance of the
ideological dimension, the need to shape the ideological environment in
which decisions are taken at all levels, and the importance of
collective responsibility, of people internalizing goals and engaging in
vigorous political struggle]{.underline}. The point is that
[planning]{.underline} is not only subject to technical and
administrative constraints but to political factors and to the
limitations imposed by ideology. It [takes place in the context of class
struggle in society]{.underline}. Towards what kinds of transformations
is planning oriented? For whom and for what? These are not givens but
issues of struggle. For Mao the issue to solve was not principally one
of the enforcement mechanisms of planning authority versus the
prerogatives of managers, but rather the role of the masses. [The masses
must grasp what is politically necessary]{.underline} 9 [and have wide
knowledge of the whole system]{.underline}---its economic laws, its
goals, its contradictions---[so that they themselves become the actors
rather than the inert material acted on by market or bureaucratic
planning processes]{.underline}, so that they can analyze and act on
contradictions...so that they can regulate the regulators. Rather than
administering by technical and economic standards, the [Chinese
revolutionaries fostered non- and anti-bureaucratic methods for
communicating policy and raising a different kind of standard, that of
advanced experience and moral example. They popularized and encouraged
people to learn from model institutions---rural brigades, communes, or
factories--- that implemented the general line.]{.underline} These were
studied (and, in many cases, first-hand, with peasants and workers from
various parts of the country visiting actual sites). But these models
were not studied to be strictly copied, as if they were blueprints. [The
idea was for people to learn how problems were analyzed and
overcome]{.underline}, how breakthroughs were made in the face of
resistance from capitalist roaders, what advances were made in
reorganizing property and social relations as well as the continuing
political and technical problems, [and how to apply these lessons to
local conditions.]{.underline} The experience of building the Red Flag
Canal (a monumental collective effort by peasants that vastly increased
the amount of irrigated land), or fighting cruel natural conditions in
the rural Tachai Brigade when it was a revolutionary stronghold, were
examples of the masses conquering all kinds of difficulties and defying
convention in economic construction. The Anshan (Steel Works)
Constitution set a standard of revolutionary industrial management. In
short, these models enabled people to grasp more deeply both the goals
and methods of the communist revolution. At the same time, [national
political campaigns were vehicles to focus mass attention on and sharpen
awareness about key issues confronting society. Several such campaigns,
like those to criticize and restrict bourgeois right]{.underline} and to
criticize Confucian ideas of subservience and blind submission to
authority, [were launched by the revolutionary forces in the early and
mid-1970s in the context of the struggle between the capitalist and
socialist roads and the two-line struggle in the party. The aim was to
arm people to make decisions and evaluate activities with broader
interests in mind]{.underline} and to figure out what class interests
were in fact being served by particular institutions and policies, and
to strengthen the capacity of the masses to wage the struggle to
maintain and extend political power. [The proletariat's political power
is concentrated in its state.]{.underline} The proletariat needs a state
to represent its interests. It is not enough to leave things at the
local level or at the level of the individual factory. The proletariat
needs to take up questions of society and the world---politics, culture,
and ideology. One of the guiding insights of the Cultural Revolution was
that the laboring people, through their experience in struggle and study
of Marxism, had to grasp the link between two-line struggle over
questions of economics and two-line struggle over issues in other
realms. The revisionists' economic policies were part of an overall
program to turn the masses back into beasts of burden. And if the masses
were to wage, much less win, the battle on any front, including
economics, and prevent capitalist restoration, they had to be concerned
with and influence what was happening in society overall. And so it was
extremely significant that enterprises were transformed from mere
production units into what Mao called "universities of class struggle"
where theoretical study groups were set up, where proletarian cultural
activity took place among other things. At the same time, worker and
peasant teams came in to the universities in connection with the larger
political struggle. The fact is that it would not have been possible to
initiate and carry through the radical transformations in economic
organization, 10 management, and the labor process that have been
discussed if ordinary laboring people were not politically mobilized
around these broader issues. [The proletariat needs to transform society
in its entirety---the condition of women, the oppression of minority
nationalities, the values promoted by the education system, and so
on.]{.underline} It needs a state to see to it that political, social,
and economic transformations are carried out in a way that serves the
world revolution. And it needs a state to defend its rule against the
forces that would bring back and impose the old order. But all this
means nothing unless the workers are actually becoming masters of the
state, waging struggle over the nature and actions of this state.
Because who controls the state will ultimately determine who controls
the means of production.\[11\] This is why politics must command
economics. Fundamentally, [a plan must concentrate the advanced
experiences and aspirations of the masses; it must be constructed for
their use, and it must unleash their initiative. This
requires]{.underline} political leadership of a specific type---not a
dominating clique but [a real vanguard party with links to and serving
the people, a vanguard capable of leading people forward through the
complex struggle to bring a new society into being and to revolutionize
the vanguard itself. This too is what it means to put politics in
command.]{.underline}

### Political Role Experimentation 

#### The alternative is to utilize debate as a cite for political role experimentations. The imagining of alternate political futures not only prepares students to [use institutions]{.underline} to control capital, but also trains us to resolve social problems with [collective action]{.underline}, which resists the neoliberal hegemony of individualism.

[[To escape]{.mark} the crocodile death roll of
[modernity]{.mark}]{.underline} thus [[requires]{.underline}]{.mark} the
calm serenity of [fluid movement paired with the speed of instinct and
reaction]{.underline}. Such [instinctual reaction in the face of certain
death can only be born of **militant and repetitive
practice**]{.underline} until the reaction is finally, purely
instinctual. Like the surfer who survives a wipe-out on a 100' wave, the
calm that allows your body to go limp and ride out the excruciating
minutes of chaotic tumbling and lack of air can only come from a
thoroughly practiced and steady mind. [**Finding joy and purpose in
political practice** becomes critical to the longevity and intensity of
commitment]{.underline}. In words frequently attributed to him, Gary
Sirota explains why he surfs: "There are no more committed people on the
planet than surfers. We fall down a lot. We turn around, paddle back
out, and do it over and over again."9 In this same way, [we must become
addicted to the high of engagement. The **accumulation of [political
role experimentations]{.mark}**]{.underline} espoused by Connolly
[become a path for amplifying connection and perception and as [each
experiment makes a]{.mark} small [difference]{.mark}, the natural
amplification of [effects]{.mark} "may [prepare us to participate with
others in]{.mark} yet more adventurous [activities" that
**counteract**]{.mark} **the insistent amplification of [neoliberal
ideological forces]{.mark}**]{.underline}.10 In this prescription, [as
we learn to surf the ceaseless waves of climate change, species loss,
socio-economic inequality, refugees, war, surveillance and depression,
we find]{.underline} the moments of [joy and connection in the work that
keep us coming back, each time more prepared and capable of surfing
bigger waves with confidence]{.underline}. To begin cultivating the
necessary qualities, Connolly's imagination of the 'micro' is
instrumental. He argues that, "[[Capitalism writ large... **sets too
large** ]{.mark}**and generic [a target]{.mark}**]{.underline}...[[The
point]{.mark} today [is not to wait for a revolution that overthrows the
whole system]{.mark}]{.underline}."11 To reinforce this hypothesis,
Connolly connects his vision of a vigilant micro-political commitment to
our daily entanglement with the microbiota within and all around us,
"because human and nonhuman systems regularly infuse and impinge upon
one another -- both at the microscopic level within human bodies and at
the macroscopic level between disparate systems."12 We can see this
phenomena manifested clearly with the increasing prevalence of
Toxoplasma gondii, an intracellular parasitic protozoan typically found
in cat poo and implicated in a whole host of disorders perhaps most
notably and symbolically schizophrenia.13 Or in the way that a newborn
child is robbed of their very first protective microbial force field
when birthed by caesarean, a trend reaching upwards of 40 percent in
some countries like Chile.14 These and myriad other micro-biological
processes remind us daily that "We are not unique; we are merely
distinctive."15 Embracing that level of humility is crucial as we are
forced to evolve rapidly and transformatively in a not-so-distant future
filled with environmental wierding, socio-economic upheavals and chaotic
technological advances all underwritten by a neoliberal world order.
Humility, in this post-normal world becomes an invaluable asset,
allowing us to productively accept, understand and enhance our
positively parasitic partnership with unseen micro-realities rather than
becoming mired in the ego-ic experience of neoliberal individualism.
[[Community is]{.mark} today more critical, and]{.underline} in fact
[[more]{.mark} [endangered, than]{.mark} it has [ever]{.mark}
been.]{.underline} The realities that a parasite could induce delusions
of grandeur in the human mind, and that commodification of health has
led to children entering the world devoid of their first microbial
allies are significant for our understandings of modern neoliberal
politics. "[[Capitalist]{.mark} modes of [acceleration]{.mark},
expansion, and intensification that heighten the fragility of things
today **also generate pressures to [minoritize the world]{.mark} along
multiple dimensions** at a more rapid pace that
heretofore]{.underline}."16 [[Reversing this neoliberal tendency]{.mark}
to loosen beings from their connection to the web of existence [is the
work of our time]{.mark}. Rebuilding our ability to sense connection and
resonance when it occurs]{.underline}, to hear our na'au when it speaks
to us in new languages, these [are our challenges]{.underline} and our
calling. Connolly mirrors and re-resonates this value for
micro-processes in his evaluation of political will. By positioning
**[role performance as political experiment]{.underline}**, Connolly
subtly [argues for the]{.underline} microbial infection [[and
amplification of day-to-day activity]{.mark}, indicating]{.underline}
[that]{.underline} **[[small]{.mark} deliberate [choices]{.mark} can
[lead to entrenched behaviors]{.mark}]{.underline}** much in the same
way that ingestion of the toxoplasma microbe can eventually lead to
schizophrenia. He clearly argues that ["role experimentations and the
shape of the pluralist assemblage thus infect one
another]{.underline}."17 [To ignore the tacit role performances with
which we engage constantly is to then succumb to the habitual nature of
practices that "**condense previous relations of overt
power**]{.underline}."18 Instead, [we are being asked by the inherent
fragility of things to **intentionally foster
micro-political-performances** that enhance]{.underline} our militant
[democratic possibilities]{.underline}. Coincidentally
[these]{.underline} same [performances will]{.underline} likely [be the
ones that inspire the most joy within us; a joy that creates a space for
us to persist and practice despite a mounting understanding of
catastrophe]{.underline}. [Whether it is a **small group of scholars
gathering to discuss the fragility of things**]{.underline}, or a blog
one of us writes later to critique neoliberal ideologies, or a smile
given to a stranger in a crowded public space, or a garden, planted in
an abandoned city lot to grow food and feed a neighborhood, [these
microscopic daily acts of political will reaffirm that "there is no zone
of complete neutrality in a world of role performances" and]{.underline}
that [there are "**significant relays between role performance**,
self-identity, and the **formation of larger political
constellations**]{.underline}."19 In the same way that we are constantly
made and re-made by the microbial biological realities at work within
our bodies, [our [politics are]{.mark} constantly [made]{.mark} and
re-made [by]{.mark} the [micro-political choices]{.mark} and
identifications we collectively propagate]{.underline}. And yet, despite
this insistence on micro-political performativity, [[there is an]{.mark}
**equally [urgent call to reengage]{.mark} with [the state as]{.mark} a
site of [activism]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Treading lightly in his
prescriptions, [Connolly is]{.underline} nonetheless [explicit in his
concern for the mounting pressures to discard the state altogether.
Instead]{.underline}, he explains that, "[the fragile ecology of late
[capital **requires state interventions**]{.mark} **of several sorts**.
A [refusal to participate]{.mark} in the state today **[cedes]{.mark}
too much [hegemony to neoliberal markets]{.mark}**]{.underline}."20 [The
[scale of the challenges we face]{.mark} and their planetary ubiquity
[**require state intervention** as much as]{.mark} they
require]{.underline} the resonance of [[community]{.mark} based
micro-[politics]{.mark}]{.underline}. [We need a revolution at all
scales to reverse the trends that have brought us a world
where]{.underline} small island nations are being swallowed by a rising
ocean; a world where many say [**the sixth extinction is already
underway**;]{.underline} [a world where most Americans have little or no
connection to most of their closest neighbors.]{.underline} [The
severity and ubiquity of the crisis demands an equal amount of
amplification and resonance from the other side of the pendulum and this
will **only come if we engage "a multisited politics** designed to
infuse a new ethos into the fabric of everyday life]{.underline}."21 The
political economy of late-late capitalism is a moving assemblage -- its
loose joints and disparate edges tearing at the fragile fabric of
communities in the midst of their struggle to hold a center. And we must
become painfully aware, if we have not already, that in this day and
age, the very notion of community and the heterogeneity that deeply
place-based community cultivates is under heated attack from many sides.
This is the fate of our neoliberal embrace, for as Connolly suggests,
"[[neoliberalism]{.underline}]{.mark} is a form of biopolitics that
[[seeks to produce a nation of]{.mark} regular
**[individuals]{.mark}**]{.underline}, even [as its
proponents]{.underline} often [act as if they are merely describing
processes that are automatic and individual behavior that is
free]{.underline}."22 [This is]{.underline} perhaps [the ultimate
deception of the Anthropocene epoch and a delusion that could very well
be our undoing. Participation in this delusion is partially a survival
instinct, "since total immersion in the dangers of the
future]{.underline} and the contemporary condition [can lead you [to
neglect]{.mark} daily [duties]{.mark} and needs]{.underline}."23 [These
realities coalesce to form an ever-greater argument for the capacity of
micro-processes as change agents]{.underline}. [Harnessing the
"potential power of these subterranean flows" will allow us]{.underline}
the fortitude [to continue persisting in a world entrenched in
neoliberal schizophrenia while]{.underline} simultaneously [**building
the capacity for self-organization** and feedback loops that allow "a
self-amplification system to emerge]{.underline}", what Connolly calls a
"creative resonance machine" -- one [to **counter and unbalance the
machine that is literally consuming the planet**]{.underline} and all
its natural resources.24 [This resonance machine would have
micro-political [communitie]{.mark}s [forming]{.mark} in various places
around the world which [would]{.mark} then find connections among one
another to [build]{.mark} ever-greater [alliances
that]{.mark}]{.underline} en masse [[have]{.mark} the [potential to
enact]{.mark}]{.underline} Connolly's vision of [the militant
[politics]{.mark} that are necessary [to "defeat
neoliberalism]{.mark}]{.underline}, to [[curtail climate
change]{.underline}]{.mark}, to [[reduce]{.mark} [inequality]{.mark},
and to instill a vibrant pluralist spirituality into democratic machines
that have lost too much of their vitality]{.underline}."25 [[In the
short term]{.underline}]{.mark} at least, it seems that [**[we]{.mark}
still very much [need the institutions of the state]{.mark}**
[as]{.mark} final [safe guards against the]{.mark} pervasive and
[divisive individuality]{.mark} that [neoliberalism would have us
believe]{.mark} is paramount to freedom]{.underline}. It is then within
[this call to role performance as political experiment]{.underline} that
I believe Connolly [offers us a compelling way forward.]{.underline}
**[Imagining our daily micro political maneuvers as part of a larger
resonance machine]{.underline}** embroiled in the best that a complex
universe has to offer [is the only way we may find the fortitude
to]{.underline} relax our breath, conserve the last bits of oxygen we
have left and [ride the chaos of this massive wave until the set has
passed and we find our way to the sky for a quick and critical
breath]{.underline}. Remembering with calm confidence that another set
of waves with equally chaotic power is very likely on its way. At our
constant aid is the innate human appreciation for aesthetic experience.
We may want to seriously consider the idea that aesthetics are in fact a
basic and physiological form of communicating ethics between modes of
existence such as living/non-living or human/non-human. Joseph Campbell
called this 'the problem of beauty,' and in an interview with Bill
Moyers he asked, "When a spider makes a beautiful web, the beauty comes
out of the spider's nature. It's instinctive beauty. How much of the
beauty of our own lives is about the beauty of being alive?"26
Re-instilling our ethical imaginary with this positioning allows for
incorporation of both humility and reverence, two concepts critical to
the task of managing our fragility. Cultivating our sensitivity to the
inherent aesthetic communication of non-human beings and things requires
specific courage in a world full of apparent suffering, but I believe
that this courage is crucial and we can no longer afford to deny our
complicity in the state of things as they are. Where I disagree with
Connolly is primarily in his assessment of thinking about and
envisioning the future(s). Arguing for dedication to an 'interim
agenda,' Connolly suggests that "in a world of becoming the more distant
future is too cloudy to engage."27 While this may be true on face value,
[the cloudiness of the more distant future **must not preclude our
engagement with it**]{.underline}. Instead, at this point in history [it
is more crucial than ever to hone our capacity for engaging with
uncertainty and becoming comfortable in the fog]{.underline}. [[It is
through]{.mark} the **[repeated]{.mark} and consistent [practice of
imagining]{.mark} and envisioning preferred and [alternative
futures]{.mark}** [that we]{.mark}]{.underline} will [**polish and
[strengthen our capacity for performing]{.mark} militant and
[productive]{.mark} micro-[politics in the present]{.mark}**. The future
is destined to be the artifact of those with the most militant
imaginings and **we cannot afford to forego that commitment for a focus
solely on the interim present**. Getting good at experiment is part of
this process]{.underline}. In fact ethical experiment and resilience may
be the words best suited to replace the outdated and misused meme of
sustainability. [Micropolitical experiment]{.underline} like microbial
contagion [will shape and reshape our path as we charge forward into an
increasingly chaotic future]{.underline} in a "cosmos of becoming."28
That said, if instead we engage with Connolly's imagining of the
'interim' from a perspective of the cosmos and geologic timeframes, then
perhaps it is big enough to address the 'future' in terms useful for
tackling human scale concerns. In other words, [we must]{.underline} at
the very least [think in terms of several generations into the
future]{.underline}, even better several centuries. Our lack of practice
in long term thinking is a peculiar tendency of modernity where many of
our products and processes leave tangible traces for millennia but our
planning for them does not take into account even a few generations
beyond our own. [Think of nuclear waste, climate change and genetic
engineering as]{.underline} just a few [examples of this destructively
pervasive proclivity]{.underline}. [Our **ineptitude at imagining our
agency in terms of our ability to seriously affect the lives of yet
unborn future generations** has been one of our **biggest
downfalls**]{.underline}. Many of our ancestors understood that their
life was as part of a long chain of being which extends backwards and
forwards and which requires an ethics that embrace eternity. We have
[today]{.underline} been mostly severed from that understanding.
Instead, "[Much of life is organized around daily routines and struggles
that draw attention from the attachment to humanity and the world
typically woven into the undercurrents of living]{.underline}."29 And
while this state of affairs is understandable, [it is our imperative to
**challenge the reactionary mode of existence** and find a creative mode
where attachment and assemblage become as natural to us as being
alive]{.underline}.

### Supernanny 

#### the alternative is to assume the role of the marxist supernanny -- paternalism is good because we don't know what we want 

**Fisher 9** (Mark, cultural theorist and professor at Department of
Visual Cultures at Goldsmiths, University of London, *Capitalist
Realism*, chapter 9)

**[Marxist Supernanny]{.underline}**

[Nothing could be a clearer illustration of what Žižek has identified as
the failure of the Father function, the crisis of the paternal superego
in late capitalism, than a typical edition of **[Supernanny]{.mark}**.
The program [offers]{.mark} what amounts to **[a relentless]{.mark},
although of course implicit, [attack on postmodernity\'s permissive
hedonism]{.mark}**. Supernanny]{.underline} is a Spinozist insofar as,
like Spinoza, she [takes it for granted that [children]{.mark} are in a
state of abjection. They [are unable to recognize their own
interests,]{.mark} unable to [apprehend]{.mark} either the causes of
[their actions]{.mark} or their (usually [deleterious) effects]{.mark}.
But [the problems]{.mark} that Supernanny confronts do not arise from
the actions or character of the children - who can only be expected to
be idiotic hedonists - but [with the]{.mark} parents. It is the
[parents\' following]{.mark} of the trajectory of [the pleasure
principle]{.mark}, the path of least resistance, [that causes]{.mark}
most of the [misery]{.mark} in the families. In a pattern that quickly
becomes familiar, the parents\' pursuit of the easy life leads them to
accede to their children\'s every demand, which become increasingly
tyrannical.]{.underline}

Rather like many teachers or other workers in what used to be called
\'public service\', [Supernanny has to sort out problems of
socialization that the family can no longer resolve. **A Marxist
Supernanny would of course turn away from the troubleshooting of
individual families to look at the structural causes which produce the
same repeated effect.**]{.underline}

The problem is that **[late capitalism insists and relies upon the very
equation of desire with interests]{.underline}** [that parenting used to
be based on rejecting.]{.underline} **[In a culture in which the
\'paternal\' concept of duty has been subsumed into the \'maternal\'
imperative to enjoy, it can seem that the parent is failing in their
duty if they in any way impede their children\'s absolute right to
enjoyment.]{.underline}** [Partly this is an effect of the increasing
requirement that both parents work; in these conditions, when the parent
sees the child very little, the tendency will often be to refuse to
occupy the \'oppressive\' function of telling the child what to do. The
parental [disavowal]{.mark} of this role [is]{.mark} doubled [at the
level of]{.mark} cultural [production by the refusal]{.mark} of
\'gatekeepers\' [to do anything but give **audiences what they**]{.mark}
**already [(appear to) want]{.mark}**.]{.underline} The concrete
question is: if a return to the paternal superego - the stern father in
the home, Reithian superciliousness in broadcasting - is neither
possible nor desirable, then how are we to move beyond the culture of
monotonous moribund conformity that results from a refusal to challenge
or educate? A question as massive as this cannot of course be finally
answered in a short book such as this, and [what follows here will
amount to a few starting points and suggestions]{.underline}. In brief,
though, I believe that it is Spinoza who offers the best resources for
thinking through what a \'paternalism without the father\' might look
like.

In Tarrying with the Negative, Žižek famously argues that [a certain
Spinozism is the ideology of late capitalism]{.underline}. Žižek
believes that [Spinoza\'s rejection of deontology for an ethics based
around the concept of health is allegedly flat with capitalism\'s amoral
affective engineering]{.underline}. The famous example here is
Spinoza\'s reading of the myth of the Fall and the foundation of Law.
[On Spinoza\'s account, **God does not condemn Adam for eating the apple
because the action is wrong; he tells him that he should not consume the
apple because it will poison him.**]{.underline} For Žižek, [this
dramatizes the termination of the Father function. An act is wrong not
because Daddy says so; Daddy only says it is \'wrong\' because
performing the act will be harmful to us.]{.underline} In Žižek\'s view,
[Spinoza\'s move both deprives the grounding of Law in a sadistic act of
scission (the cruel cut of castration), at the same time as it denies
the ungrounded positing of agency in an act of pure volition, in which
the subject assumes responsibility for everything.]{.underline} In fact,
[Spinoza has immense resources for analyzing the affective regime of
late capitalism]{.underline}, the videodrome-control apparatus described
by Burroughs, Philip K. Dick and David Cronenberg in which agency is
dissolved in a phantasmagoric haze of psychic and physical intoxicants.
Like Burroughs, Spinoza shows that, [far from being an aberrant
condition, addiction is the standard state for [human]{.mark}
being[s,]{.mark} who [are habitually enslaved]{.mark} in[to]{.mark}
reactive and **[repetitive behaviors]{.mark} by frozen images (of
themselves and the world).** **[Freedom,]{.mark} Spinoza shows, is
something that [can be achieved only]{.mark} when we can apprehend the
real causes of our actions, [when we]{.mark} can [set aside the \'sad
passions\' that intoxicate]{.mark} and entrance
[us.]{.mark}**]{.underline}

There\'s no doubt that [[late capitalism]{.mark} certainly
[articulates]{.mark} many of [its injunctions via]{.mark} an appeal to
**(a certain version of)** health. The banning of smoking in public
places, the relentless monstering of working class diet on programs like
You Are What You Eat, do appear to indicate that we are already in the
presence of a [paternalism without the Father]{.mark}. It is not that
smoking is \'wrong\', it is that it will lead to our failing to lead
long and enjoyable lives. **But there are limits to this emphasis on
good health: [mental health and intellectual development barely feature
at all]{.mark}, for**]{.underline} instance. What [**[we see]{.mark}
instead is [a reductive, hedonic model of health]{.mark} which is all
[about \'feeling and looking good\'.]{.mark}** To tell people how to
lose weight, or how to decorate their house, is acceptable; but to call
for any kind of cultural improvement is to be oppressive and elitist.
The alleged elitism and oppression cannot consist in the notion that a
third party might know someone\'s interest better than they know it
themselves, since, presumably smokers are deemed either to be unaware of
their interests or incapable of acting in accordance with them. No:
**the problem is that only certain types of interest are deemed
relevant, since they reflect values that are held to be consensual**.
Losing weight, decorating your house and improving your appearance
belong to the \'consentimental\' regime.]{.underline}

In an excellent interview at the Register.com, the documentary
film-maker Adam Curtis identifies the contours of this regime of
affective management.

[TV now tells you what to feel.]{.underline}

[It doesn\'t tell you what to think any more. From EastEnders to reality
format shows, you\'re on the emotional journey of people - and through
the editing, it gently suggests to you what is the agreed form of
feeling. \"Hugs and Kisses\", I call it.]{.underline}

I nicked that off Mark Ravenhill who wrote a very good piece which said
that if you analyse **[television now it\'s a system of
guidance]{.underline}** - [it tells you who is having the Bad Feelings
and who is having the Good Feelings. And the person who is having the
Bad Feelings is redeemed through a \"hugs and kisses\" moment at the
end. It really is a system **not of moral guidance, but of emotional
guidance.**]{.underline}

**[Morality has been replaced by feeling.]{.underline}** [In the
\'empire of the self\' everyone \'feels the same\' without ever escaping
a condition of solipsism. \'What people suffer from,\']{.underline}
Curtis claims,

[is being trapped within themselves - in a world of individualism
everyone is trapped within their own feelings, trapped within their own
imaginations. Our job as public service broadcasters is to take people
beyond the limits of their own self, and until we do that we will carry
on declining.]{.underline}

The BBC should realize that. I have an idealistic view, but if the BBC
could do that, taking people beyond their own selves, it will renew
itself in a way that jumps over the competition. [The competition is
obsessed by serving people in their little selves. And in a way,
actually, Murdoch for all his power, is trapped by the self. That\'s his
job, to feed the self.]{.underline}

In the BBC, it\'s the next step forward. It doesn\'t mean we go back to
the 1950s and tell people how to dress, [what [we]{.mark} do is [say
\"we can free you from yourself\"]{.mark} - and people would love
it.]{.underline}

Curtis attacks the internet because, in his view, it facilitates
communities of solipsists, interpassive networks of like-minds who
confirm, rather than challenge, each others\' assumptions and
prejudices. Instead of having to confront other points of view in a
contested public space, these communities retreat into closed circuits.
But, Curtis claims, the impact of internet lobbies on Old Media is
disastrous, since, not only does its reactive proactivity allow the
media class to further abnegate its function to educate and lead, it
also allows populist currents on both the left and the right to
\'bully\' media producers into turning out programming that is anodyne
and mediocre.

Curtis\'s critique has a point, but it misses important dimensions of
what is happening on the net. Contrary to Curtis\'s account of blogging,
blogs can generate new discourse networks that have no correlate in the
social field outside cyberspace. As Old Media increasingly becomes
subsumed into PR and the consumer report replaces the critical essay,
some zones of cyberspace offer resistance to a \'critical compression\'
that is elsewhere depressingly pervasive. [Nevertheless, the
[interpassive simulation]{.mark} of participation in postmodern media,
the network narcissism of MySpace and Facebook, [has]{.mark}, in the
main, [generated content that is repetitive, parasitic and
conformist]{.mark}]{.underline}. In a seeming irony, [the media class\'s
**refusal to be paternalistic has not produced a bottom-up culture of
breathtaking diversity, but one that is increasingly
infantilized**.]{.underline} By contrast, [it is [paternalistic
cultures]{.mark} that [treat audiences as adults]{.mark}, assuming that
they can cope with cultural products that are complex and intellectually
demanding. **The reason that focus groups and capitalist feedback
systems fail, even when they generate commodities that are immensely
popular**]{.underline}, **[is that [people do not know what they
want]{.mark}.]{.underline}** This is not only because people\'s desire
is already present but concealed from them (although this is often the
case). Rather, **[the most powerful forms of desire are precisely
cravings for the strange, the unexpected, the weird]{.underline}**.
[These can only be supplied by artists and media professionals who are
prepared to give people something different from that which already
satisfies them; by those, that is to say, prepared to take a certain
kind of risk]{.underline}. **[The Marxist [Supernanny would]{.mark} not
only [be the one]{.mark} [who laid down limitations,]{.mark} who [acted
in our]{.mark} own [interests when we are incapable of recognizing them
ourselves]{.mark},]{.underline}** but also the one [prepared to take
this kind of risk, to wager on the strange and our appetite for
it]{.underline}. It is another irony that capitalism\'s \'society of
risk\' is much less likely to take this kind of risk than was the
supposedly stodgy, centralized culture of the postwar social consensus.
It was the public service-oriented BBC and Channel 4 that perplexed and
delighted me with the likes of Tinker; Tailor; Soldier Spy, Pinter plays
and Tarkovsky seasons; it was this BBC that also funded the popular
avant gardism of the BBC Radiophonic Workshop, which embedded sonic
experimentalism into everyday life. Such innovations are unthinkable now
that the public has been displaced by the consumer. **[[The effect
of]{.mark} permanent structural instability, [the \'cancellation of the
long term\', is]{.mark} invariably [stagnation and conservatism, not
innovation]{.mark}.]{.underline}** This is not a paradox. As Adam
Curtis\'s remarks above make clear, **[the affects that predominate in
late capitalism are fear and cynicism.]{.underline}** [These emotions do
not inspire bold thinking or entrepreneurial leaps]{.underline},
**[[they breed]{.mark} conformity and the cult of the minimal variation,
the turning out of [products which]{.mark} very closely [resemble
those]{.mark} that are [already successful]{.mark}]{.underline}**.
Meanwhile, films such as the aforementioned Tarkovsky\'s Solaris and
Stalker - plundered by Hollywood since as far back as Alien and Blade
Runner - were produced in the ostensibly moribund conditions of the
Brezhnevite Soviet state, meaning that the USSR acted as a cultural
entrepreneur for Hollywood.

*A note on terminology* The book will draw on four core concepts. The
first of these is capitalism. The term capitalism is used throughout the
book to refer to the prevailing form of social organization. While
acknowledging that the ways in which capitalism operates and the
implications of these operations are contested, this book defines
capital­ ism in terms of one commonly accepted distinguishing feature:
that capitalism is a system that organizes the production, distribution
and exchange of goods, on the basis of private property, with a view to
realizing profit and therefore increasing wealth. The second term is
alternative capitalism, which is used to describe a system where the
capitalistic relationship between state and market is re-regulated, but
not fundamentally reformed, in order to try to produce optimal social
and economic outcomes. The aim of an alternative capitalism is to
maximize wealth and profit by introducing a different structure of rules
to govern capitalism. The third concept is that of an alternative to
capitalism. [[An alternative to capitalism]{.mark} is distinct from
capitalism because it [places an emphasis on social and civic
goals]{.mark}, rather than purely focusing on pecuniary gain. In
contrast to capitalism, an alternative to capitalism is founded on
collective or community property rights, rather than individual property
rights, although the form and extent of collective or community property
rights may vary.]{.underline} Where the book is referring to either an
alternative capitalism or an alternative to capitalism, it uses the form
'alternative (to) capitalism'. [The final concept the book uses is
anti-capitalism. It uses the term [anti-capitalism]{.mark} to [refer to
the act of resisting capitalism, whether this occurs by attempting to
influence the state, taking control of the state, or actions taken
independently or outside of the state.]{.mark} An individual who pursues
or wishes to pursue an alternative to capitalism can therefore be
described as an anti-capitalist.]{.underline}

Traditions of Resistance\
In its consideration of capitalism and its alternatives, this book
accepts that it is possible to perceive capitalism and its con­ sequences
in different ways. Furthermore, it acknowledges that the way in which
capitalism and its consequences are perceived will have a fundamental
impact on whether people deem capitalism to be desirable, whether they
would prefer an alternative capitalism or an alternative to capitalism,
and therefore whether they believe that it is important and worthwhile
engaging in resistance to capitalism through the social act of
anti-capitalism. However, [the central argument]{.underline} of this
book [is that **[capitalism displays intrinsic tendencies towards crisis
that make an alternative to capitalism desirable, and]{.mark} so
[justifies anti-capitalist action]{.mark}**]{.underline}. In doing so,
it argues that [[capitalism is a product of social interaction between
people, and]{.mark} that it [is remade or resisted through our social
action. This ­emphasis on social constitution challenges common
assertions about the inevitability of capitalist logic,]{.mark} and in
the process shows that the prospect of realizing an alternative to
capitalism is more than wishful thinking]{.underline}. In its
discussions of alternatives to capitalism, however, [this book guards
against thinking of alternative forms of social organization as outcomes
or utopias. Rather, it shows how various forms of alternative social and
economic organization have shown a tendency to degenerate over time, or
to reproduce injustices of capitalist social relations. It therefore
suggests that **[alternatives to capitalism should be thought of as
processes that need to be continually]{.mark} made and [remade]{.mark}
if they are [not to degenerate or reproduce the injustices of capitalist
social relations, and if desirable outcomes are to be
realized]{.mark}**[.]{.mark} Reflecting the book's emphasis on the
social constitution of economy and society, [it rejects 'top-down'
attempts to impose an alternative to capitalism by political means, and
argues that anticapitalist action should take a 'bottom-up'
form]{.mark}, which requires democratic and pluralistic experimentation
with different models of social and economic organization to expand the
space in which non-capitalist activity takes place.]{.underline}

[The arguments of the book therefore fit with a long tradition of
anti-capitalist resistance]{.underline}. One of the most well-known
instances of this kind of resistance was the insurrections of 1968,
typified by the student revolts in Paris in May of that year. However,
as Michael Watts (2001: 167) noted, the events of 1968 were far more
than a local phenomenon; over seventy countries 'had major student ­
actions during that year \[and between\] October 1967 and July 1968
there were over 2000 incidents worldwide of student protest alone'.
Furthermore, it was not just students engaged in the act of protest, the
act of anti-capitalism. According to Watts' (ibid.: 167) study, 'if one
were to add the related worker and other nonstudent demonstrations each
country in the world would, on average, have had over 20 "incidents"
over the nine-month period'. Nor was the substance of the protest
uniform; 1968 had what Watts (ibid.: 171-- 2) has described as its
Eastern, Western and Southern moments. In the first, typified by the
Prague Spring and the Cultural Revolution in China, the focus of
protests was anti-bureaucratic, and directed against the 'Old Left' and
the corruption people perceived in it. In the second, typified by
student protests in Paris and Berkeley, the focus of protests was
opposition to consumerism and the pursuit of civil and social rights. In
the third, the focus was the rejection of authority in the first
generation of independent states in Africa and Latin America, where
military dictatorship had displaced democratic rule.

Luc Boltanski (2002: 6) also highlights the diversity of the 1968
movement by distinguishing between its social and artistic critiques,
where the former focused on inequality and poverty stemming from
capitalism, and the latter on liberation, individual autonomy and
authenticity. Michael Löwy (2002: 95) links this distinction between the
social and artistic critique of capitalism to romanticism, which he
defines as 'rebellion against modern capitalist society, in the name of
past or premodern social and cultural values, as a protest against the
modern disenchantment of the world'. Therefore, [the significance of
1968 can be seen not just across space, but also as a reflection of
long-established traditions of resistance to prevailing social,
political and economic forms or organization. On such readings, [the
events of 1968 can be interpreted as a demonstration of long-standing
anti-capitalist feeling that rested on a critique of the world we live
in and the injustices it creates, and in turn motivated action in order
to try to address them.]{.mark}]{.underline}

However, [[the]{.mark} events of the late 19[60s]{.mark} were
significant in at least two senses. First, they [showed that people are
willing and able to ask important questions about society and to express
their discontent by taking action]{.mark}]{.underline} (Watts 2001:
160). Secondly, and perhaps more importantly, the events occurred during
the pinnacle of the expansion of post-war liberal capitalism, and were
not the product of a capitalist crisis as such (ibid.: 162; Löwy 2002:
96). This suggests that [[resistance to capitalism is constantly
simmering beneath the surface as an expression of a generalized
discontent with the implications of the prevailing form of social and
economic organization]{.mark}, and that [anti-capitalism is more than a
fleeting moment associated with undesirable yet historically specific
circumstances]{.mark} such as unemployment or rising
inflation.]{.underline}

These [notions that the anti-capitalism of 1968 either represented 'pure
nothingness' or resulted in a compromised and co-opted political left
can clearly be challenged by [the persistence of anti-capitalist
activity throughout the world]{.mark}. There are many such examples,
which [include]{.mark} action by indigenous movements seeking to protect
their land from appropriation by the state. This is typified by [the
Zapatista resistance to]{.mark} the [N]{.mark}orth [A]{.mark}merican
[F]{.mark}ree [T]{.mark}rade [A]{.mark}greement in Mexico]{.underline}
(Cuninghame 2008), [[which has gathered support far beyond the Zapatista
communities themselves]{.mark}, as they have been able to use
communications technologies in order to 'get their message out despite
governmental spin and censorship']{.underline} (Cleaver 2008: 130).
Alongside other organized activities, [the ability of the Zapatista
movement ­ to raise awareness of its struggle has 'facilitated
discussions and debate among concerned observers [that led to the
organization of protest and support activities in over forty
countries]{.mark}]{.underline} around the world' (ibid.: 130). [Despite
claims that the anti-capitalism of the 1960s was a failure, such
movements show that people are still willing to question the capitalist
system and to try to create an alternative. [On a smaller scale,
organizations like the Starbucks Workers Campaign have shown a similar
willingness to question the prevailing form of social and economic
organization, by challenging the notion of progressive
capitalism]{.mark}]{.underline} (Shukaitis 2008: 104). Some of the
anti-capitalist actions featuring prominently in the media have included
the Battle of Seattle against the World Trade Organization, and the 2009
protests against the G20 in London, but there have been many more
besides (see Tormey 2004: 177-- 9 for a timeline). [[All of these
varying forms of ongoing struggle indicate people's continued
willingness to question capitalism, ponder alternatives, and consider
how they might be realized.]{.underline}]{.mark}

[One of the most enduring forums in which this tradition of res­istance
can be seen is [the World Social Forum]{.mark}, which [has brought
together civil society organizations]{.mark} every year since 2001 in
order [to discuss]{.mark} and debate the possibilities for [an
alternative future]{.mark}.\]{.underline}

Chinese Characteristics, 33 Conn. J. Int\'l L. 1

And [that leads]{.underline} one again [to **first
[principles]{.mark}**. [Underlying]{.mark} all]{.underline} of these
[[debates]{.underline}]{.mark}---some normative and some
technical/methodological, [[is a **fundamental issue**]{.mark} that
tends to go **unexamined**]{.underline}. That issue touches on [the
connection between the judge-judiciary and the exercise of the judicial
function. When people speak to judicial reform, they use that as a
shorthand to speak to the judge]{.underline} embedded within the
institution of the judiciary. [That]{.underline}, I suggest, overly
[narrows and centers the issue of judging]{.underline} and its
connection of political system legitimacy on the institution of the
judiciary [rather than on the **systems created for
judging**]{.underline}-and the legitimacy enhancing normative
constraints of judging detached from the institution of the judiciary,
though also applied to the institution of the judiciary itself. This
requires a sensitivity to the normative context in which such an
exercise must be undertaken.

[In the West, there has always been a detachment between]{.underline}
the institution of [the judiciary and]{.underline} the role of
[judging]{.underline}.\"o0 The common law judiciary, from which the
modem institution of the judge was derived in large part, was in its
origins just one of many institutions for the settlement of disputes,
one that ultimately proved more successful than other systems for
meeting the needs of litigants, and of the state under the conditions of
English feudalism. Those institutions have been consolidated to some
extent, adjusting its structures and methodologies to suit changing
historical conditions. But with every consolidation arose new
manifestation of judging power outside the institutions of the
traditional judge.\" The consolidation of law and equity in the United
States, for example, was implemented even as the administrative state
arose, and with it the creation of a large \"quasi-judicial\" power
(notice the way in which Americans are taught to reference these
judges-by the very language of the judges themselves in their cases) 107
exercised by hearing officers and the like. But consolidation prevailed
through the institution of hierarchy in which the most legitimate and
superior institutional manifestation of the judicial power is vested in
the institution of the judiciary-that society of judges whose cultures
and habits are meant to be autonomous though connected with, the rest of
the state apparatus. It is that hierarchy that has permitted the
detachment of the judicial function from the judge-precisely because at
some point the institution of the judge will pass on the soundness (one
way or another) of the actions of inferior administrative hearing
officers, arbitrators, or secondary officers with judicial roles (for
example bankruptcy court judges). [The structure of]{.underline} Article
III of [the U.S. federal constitution provides the hint-vesting the
entirety of the judicial power]{.underline} of the federal apparatus [in
courts and thus consigning all judging undertaken elsewhere as
inferior]{.underline} in form and effect.\'o

[This is the model mimicked throughout the United States]{.underline},
less so elsewhere in the West, but enough so that [a set of [ordering
premises]{.mark} can be discerned-and [taken for granted]{.mark} in
speaking with or engaging other systems]{.underline}. First, **[[judging
is]{.mark} best [done by courts]{.mark}]{.underline}** []{.mark}overseen
by properly trained judges. Second, [these judges must cultivate
institutional solidarity with other judges]{.underline}, and thus
unified, represent the institution for resolving disputes and
\"protecting\" the law against other public or private institutions that
may deploy or apply or interpret \"the law\" in the course of their own
exercise of authority. Third, **[the connection between the judges, the
institution of [the judiciary may not be interfered with]{.mark} by
other institutions of state]{.underline}**. Fourth, [within the
institutions of the judiciary, all inferior judges owe a duty of
obedience and loyalty to judges of superior courts]{.underline}, or
better put, to those portions of opinions that are rendered in courts
hierarchically superior, to the extent required within the specific
judicial culture in which the judicial institution operates. Fifth,
**[judging cannot be detached from the institution of the
judiciary]{.underline}** and must be exercised by the individual judge,
alone or in groups as provided by law or judicial custom. Sixth,
**[others who purport to exercise the power of judging may do so
legitimately only to the extent their [actions]{.mark}, to some minimum
extent]{.underline}** (as specified by the judicial institution itself
through its own interpretation of its own constitutive powers, its
kompetenz-kompetenz, \"\' **[[are subject to review]{.mark} or
conformation by the judiciary]{.underline}**. Seventh, **[only the
[judiciary]{.mark}]{.underline}**, either generally or within
specialized tribunals created for that purpose, **[[may
interpret]{.mark} the extent, limit and lawful application of
[governmental power]{.mark}]{.underline}**. Eighth, [only the
judiciary]{.underline} (either generally or through specialized
tribunals designated therefore), [may interpret and apply
authoritatively as against other institutions of states and non-state
actors]{.underline}.

But [[are these premises]{.underline}]{.mark}, all or any of them,
absolutely **[[necessary]{.mark} to protect the
integrity]{.underline}**, such as one wants it, **[of the judicial
process]{.underline}** (and not necessarily of a particular judicial
institution)? [It is possible]{.underline} to suggest [that the answer
is **[no]{.mark}**]{.underline}. For that purpose, one might
[consider]{.underline} the theoretical arrangement of the judicial
authority in [China]{.underline}. It is divided in two quite distinct
respects. First, [the authority to decide a particular dispute is
divided from the authority to interpret the law]{.underline} to be
applied to that dispute. Second, the authority to hear and decide a
particular dispute is itself divided in accordance to the status of the
disputants and the character of the dispute. For example, at the 11th
Annual General Conference of the European China Law Studies Association
(\'-} ).110 There were three quite interesting discussions that brought
home the challenge and possibilities of an assertion of the judicial
power detached from the judiciary itself. The issue of the assertion of
judicial authority by agencies in the context of the Chinese competition
law.II\" Keren Wang spoke to the ambiguous context in which the role and
power of a judge is understood.112 And Shaoming Zhu spoke to the
exercise of judicial powers of interpretation within the legislative
apparatus itself, even in the face of the reform of a vigorous judicial
apparatus.\"\' These investigations frame a quite different way of
approaching the construction of a judicial power, and of the
administration of law. [It suggests that the review of disputes need not
be aggregated within a single institutional authority. A state need not
necessarily constitute a]{.underline} single institutional structure
(the [judiciary]{.underline}) [for the purpose of authenticating the
actions of judges and other hearing officers with respect to their
actions resolving disputes or interpreting law or
regulation]{.underline} in the course of resolving disputes. It suggests
as well that the function of interpreting law can be separated from the
function of applying law to a dispute, and that each can be administered
through distinct institutional means. The former authority can be
reconstituted as a political activity reserved to the political
authorities of the institutionalized state; it represents the
application of the generalized power of the political community to
refine its reading of law. The latter reconstituted as an administrative
mechanism in which the highest forms of integrity and the greatest
protection against interference by the political bodies ought to be
cultivated. In his 19\' CPC Congress Report, 114
[[Xi]{.underline}]{.mark} Jinping [[was careful to separate]{.mark} the
[judiciary from]{.mark} the [law]{.mark}. For the judiciary, the focus
was on]{.underline} judicial reform,\' and judicial accountability, \"so
that the people can see in every judicial case that
[justice]{.underline} is served.\"\'l 6 [For law, the CPC itself was
to\' lead the nation in the development of a \"**socialist culture of
rule of law**]{.underline}.\"\' 17 **[The project of legal construction
and the project of judicial reform are not]{.underline}** understood as
**[identical, and their intersection must be guided by the political
character of the state]{.underline}** rather than by any fundamental
characteristic of the judiciary as an institution autonomous of either
state or Party. Perhaps in this sense it is possible to understand the
implications of Xi\'s allocation to the CPC of the task to \"strengthen
public participation and rule of law in social governance, and make such
governance smarter and more specialized.\"\"

On the one hand, one could ask-what does any of this have to do with
judicial reform? But that question could only be asked by one oblivious
to the power of the assumptions of judging described above. In the
Chinese context, the better question might be to consider the need
either for a unitary judiciary or for a unitary legal sphere. Within
China, then, [[the grounding question]{.mark} should be the one that is
[never asked in the West]{.mark}\--the extent to which the judge and the
judicial authority must be exercised]{.underline} exclusively or
completely by or [through the institution of the judiciary and by
judges]{.underline}. In other words, does the political system suggest
the possibility a different approach to the fracture of judicial
authority consist with its own political logic. That poses the further
question-[**[must judicial modernization]{.mark} necessary [require
Westernization]{.mark}**?\"\' The answer]{.underline} within the Chinese
context [must be **[no]{.mark}**]{.underline}-[the fracture between the
political-legislative exercise of legal interpretation]{.underline}
(especially in a Chinese civil law context)

[That fracture]{.underline} would see in the judges a mechanism for the
resolution of disputes among private parties. But [it might [strip
away]{.mark} from that institutional apparatus **all [authority of
interpretation of law]{.mark}**]{.underline} []{.mark}([**[to be given
to a legislative authority]{.mark}**, a separate political body charged
exclusively with issues of interpretation]{.underline} in the context of
disputes or some other body perhaps in the CCP itself). [It
might]{.underline} also [strip away from the judge-and the institution
of the judiciary]{.underline} all [authority over disputes involving the
state itself. The issue of relief from **[administrative
excess]{.mark}**]{.underline}, wrong decision making, corruption and
abuse of power [[might]{.mark} itself [be treated as
executive]{.mark}]{.underline} in character [and assigned to
another]{.underline} and distinct competent [authority]{.underline}.
Within the Chinese context, and with the close connection that some of
these issues might have with breaches by CCP cadres of their paramount
duty to the CCP and its Basic Line, the institution might combine both
CCP disciplinary and state disciplinary structures. And lastly, it might
create, within the administrative strictures of the state structures of
administrative hearing that can exist as judicial decision-making
independent of a judiciary. In each of these cases, though, [the one
thing that must be respected-the lynchpin]{.underline} of judging, [is
the independence of the judge to decide]{.underline} the dispute before
her [on the basis of **whatever**]{.underline} received law and
**[interpretation is demanded by the system]{.underline}**. That
judicial independence in the face of actual decision making in a live
dispute, might be the only point of connection among those who might
exercise the judicial authority in distinct and partial ways.
Coordination and compatibility with western institutional forms of
deploying the judicial power, and matters of legitimacy will then
follow.

The result is medieval in the sense of the proliferation of multiple
venues and institutions for judging-for exercising the judicial
craft.120 [What is suggested]{.underline} as both possible and likely
[within a Marxist-Leninist state apparatus true to its theoretical
foundations]{.underline}l2 \' [is institutional]{.underline}
multi-hierarchies in [judging.]{.underline} The result is anarchic from
an institutional level. But [it has several advantages for [a
**Marxist-Leninist system committed to**]{.mark} **the construction of
[socialist]{.mark} rule of [law]{.mark}**]{.underline}. First, [it
[detaches law from]{.mark} the [judiciary]{.mark}]{.underline}. There is
no special relationship between law and the judiciary in a
Marxist-Leninist system-other than the requirement that the judge apply
the law, and [[that]{.underline}]{.mark} the [law [reflect]{.mark} the
[leadership]{.mark} and guidance [of the
**vanguard**]{.mark}]{.underline} and be appropriately drafted by the
state organs with legislative authority. Indeed, [[the only]{.mark}
special [relationship]{.mark} or necessary connection [ought to be
between the **vanguard**]{.mark} **party**]{.underline} which guards the
integrity of lawmaking as a whole, **[[and]{.mark} the law as an
expression of the [protection of society]{.mark}]{.underline}** and its
forward movement along the objectives for which the vanguard has been
constituted and empowered. [This is inimical to Western thinking, but
this is not a Western democratic polity]{.underline}. Second, [that
detachment permits a management of the administrative aspects of judging
without the contradiction of]{.underline} also dealing with [a latent
political authority in]{.underline} the actions of [judges. In other
words]{.underline}, to reduce the judge-in all her variations-to aspects
of administrative roles, [to strip the judge of her relationship as
curator of law]{.underline} (and thus with a political authority that
might rival the Communist Party itself in implementation and
interpretation), [permits the advance of judicial reform in a manageable
and attainable way]{.underline}. It does this by making it easier to
manage corruption (without the complexities of defenses based on
arguments that prosecutions are based on retaliation for exercise of
political authority in judging or interpreting law), and to manage the
craft of judging through assessment that should itself be fee of
politics. Third, **[[it frees the]{.mark} development of law-statutory,
administrative and [Party]{.mark} law]{.underline}**, within the context
of its own politics. [[And]{.mark} it [ensures]{.mark}, that [those with
political authority are]{.mark} made [responsible]{.mark} for their
failures]{.underline} of leadership [in law making, law enforcement and
the interpretation of law]{.underline}. It is to the CCP itself that the
responsibility belongs, and it is necessary to ensure that the CCP
itself embraces that responsibility directly-[by [becoming **directly
accountable**]{.mark} for its operation]{.underline}. That
accountability should take two forms, indirect with respect to the
disciplining of judges as administrative officials, and direct in the
construction and interpretation of uniform law applied uniformly and
fairly to the masses.

one's outward physical appearance. However, gendered/racialized
resilience isn't visible in the same way that conventional gender and
racial identities are visible]{.underline}. To clarify these
differences, it's helpful to think of resilience in terms of a "Look, I
overcame!" imperative. "[[Look, I Overcame!" Is easy to juxtapose
to]{.mark} Frantz [Fanon]{.mark}'s "Look a Negro!", which is the touch
stone for his analysis of gendered racialization in "The Fact of
Blackness." In both cases, looking is a means of crafting race/gender
identities and distributing white patriarchal privilege]{.underline}.
But, in the same way that resilience discourse "upgrades" traditional
methods for crafting identities and distributing privilege, the
"looking" in "Look, I Overcame'" is an upgrade on the "looking" in
"Look, a Negro" According to Fanon, the exclamation "Look, a Negro!"
racializes him as a black man. To be "a Negro" is to be objectified by
the white supremacist gaze. This gaze fixes him as an object, rather
than an ambiguous transcendence (which is a more nuanced way of
describing the existentialist concept of subjectivity). ["[The black
man,"]{.mark} as [Fanon argues, "has no ontological resistance]{.mark}
for the white man" (BSWM 110) because, as an object and not a
mutually-recognized subject, [he cannot return the white man's
gaze]{.mark}]{.underline} ("The Look" that is so important to Sartre's
theory of subjectivity in Being & Nothingness). [[The LIO narrative
differs from Fanon's]{.mark} account in the same way it differs from
Iris Young's account of feminine body comportment: [in resilience
discourse]{.mark}, objectification isn't an end but a means, any
impediment posed by the [damage wrought by the white/male gaze Is a
necessary prerequisite for subjectivity, agency, and mutual
recognition]{.mark}.]{.underline} In other words, [being looked at isn't
an impediment, but a resource.]{.underline}
**[[Resilience]{.underline}]{.mark}** discourse [[turns
**objectification** (being looked at) **into**]{.mark} a means of
[**subjectificatlon** (overcoming). It]{.mark} also [**makes looking
even more efficient and profitable than simple objectification could
ever be.** Recognizing and affirming the affective labor of the
resilient performer, the spectator feeds the performer's individual
overcoming Into a second-order therapeutic narrative: **our approbation
of**]{.mark} her **[overcoming is evidence of our own overcoming of our
past prejudices]{.mark}**.]{.underline} This spectator wants to be seen
by a wider audience as someone who answers the resilient feminine
subject's hail, "Look, I Overcame'. [Just as individual feminine
subjects use their resilience as proof of their own goodness, **[MRWaSP
uses]{.mark}** the **[resilience]{.mark}** of its "good girls" as proof
that they're the "good guys" --- that its social and ethical practices
are truly just, and that we really mean it this time when we say
everyone is equal]{.underline}. For example, [[the "resilience" of "our"
women is]{.mark} often [contrasted with the supposed "fragility" of
**Third-World women of color**.]{.mark} Or, in domestic US race-gender
politics, [the resilience of some African-American women]{.mark} (their
bootstraps-style class ascendance) [is]{.mark} [contrasted to the
continued fragility of other African-American women,]{.mark} and thus
**[used to reinforce class distinctions]{.mark}** among
blacks]{.underline}. There are a million different versions of this
general story: "our" women are already liberated --- they saved
themselves ---but, to riff on Gayatri Spivak, "brown women need saving
from brown men." [Most mainstream [conversations about Third-World women
are versions of]{.mark} this story: discussions of "Muslim" veiling,
female circumcision, sweatshops, poverty 'development." they're all
**[white-saviorist narratives meant to display MRWaSP's own
resilience]{.mark}**]{.underline}[. [Look, I Overcame!"
upgrades]{.underline}]{.mark} ['Look, a Negro' [by]{.mark} (a)
[**recycling objectification into overcoming** and]{.mark} (b)
[compounding looking, so that one can **profit from others'
resilience**]{.mark}, treating their overcoming as one's own overcoming.
This upgrade in white supremacist patriarchy requires a concomitant
upgrade in looking."]{.underline} This shift in looking practices
parallels developments in film and media aesthetics. As Steven Shaviro
has argued, the values, techniques, and compositional strategies most
common in contemporary mainstream Western cinema --- like Michael Bay's
Transformers---are significantly different than the ones used in
modernist and post-modernist cinema, and that these differences in media
production correlate to broader shifts in the means of capitalist and
ideological production. Neoliberalism's aesthetic is, he argues,
"post-cinematic." This post-cinematic aesthetic applies not just to film
and media, but to resilience discourse. Its performance practices and
looking relations configured by the "Look. I Overcame!" imperative,
resilience is, in a way, another type of post-cinematic medium. In the
next section I use Shaviro's theory of post-cinematic media to identify
some specific ways in which traditional patriarchal tools are updated to
work compatibly with MRWaSP resilience discourse. The looking in the
"Look, I Overcame!" narrative is not the same kind of looking described
by concepts like "the male gaze" or "controlling images" This looking is
a type of deregulated MRWaSP visualization.

#### We've reached the [end of art and history]{.underline} -- capitalism is running out of supplies and must turn to recycling the waste of modernity as the only means to sustain growth. The 1ac's transgression and symbolic rupture [aren't radical]{.underline} but simply a [deregulation of debate's sign economy]{.underline}.

Modernism, Differences 25 (2), p. 120-123, philpapers-

A method for overcoming melancholia (97), [potentiality is a way of
bouncing back from the damage wrought by modern white supremacist
patriarchy]{.underline}. For white men, this damage manifests as what
Robert Gooding Williams calls "skeptical melancholy" (54), or alienation
from embodied receptivity; for women and nonwhites, it manifests as
melancholic muteness, immanence rather than alienation.8 [The women
writers Ziarek studies rework]{.underline} this [damaging immanence into
ecstatic incandescence, effecting "an aesthetic transformation of loss
into art's own shining possibilities"]{.underline} (115). This
incandescence is [[a two-step process: the artist first performs her
damage (sparking a fire) so that she can then be seen to overcome
it]{.mark} (radiating beyond her past inertia). [Neoliberalism **co-opts
this incandescence**]{.mark}]{.underline} (or at least the most visible,
legible part of its spectrum), **[[domesticating its critical force into
the means of producing aesthetic pleasure and reproducing social
normativity]{.underline}]{.mark}**. [Potentiality has been "upgraded"
into resilience]{.underline}.9 In [resilient art, formal
experimentation]{.underline} cultivates, or [incites]{.underline} (to
use a more Foucaultian term), [shocks and feeds the resultant shockwaves
back into the system]{.underline}.10 [This feedback supports rather than
destabilizes hegemonic institutions. The aesthetic damage through which
modernist art established its heteronomous/ autonomous position of
critique]{.underline}---stuttering, fragmented, degraded, aleatory,
dissonant---[is now the very medium of normalization]{.underline}.11
Neoliberal resilience, in other words, is a method or process of
recycling modernist damage. [For example, if modernist art invested
aesthetic pleasure in the objectification of women]{.underline} (what
Laura Mulvey famously calls scopophilia), [neoliberal art invests
aesthetic pleasure in women's spectacular assumption of
subjectivity]{.underline}---what Ziarek calls incandescence. [[If in
modernity we **liked doing damage**]{.mark} to women, **[we now like to
see]{.mark}** women **[overcome that damage]{.mark}**]{.underline}.12
[This means that we expect women to perform their damage as a baseline
from which "good" women then progress.]{.underline} That damage is the
fuel for incandescent fires, so it must be constantly incited and
invoked so that there's something for incandescent women to ignite[. In
this way, resilience discourse normalizes traditional patriarchal damage
(e.g., the damage of exclusion and objectification) as a systemic or
background condition that individual women are then responsible for
overcoming.]{.underline} "[Undoing \[. . .\] feminism while
simultaneously appearing to be engaging in a wellinformed and even
well-intended response to feminism"]{.underline} (McRobbie 1), resilient
incandescence is quintessentially postfeminist. [We, [the audience,
use]{.mark} our **[identification with the resilient heroine as a way to
disidentify with and (supposedly) transgress]{.mark}** the imperatives
of modernist [**patriarchy**]{.mark}]{.underline}[.]{.mark} [This is
why, as Ziarek explains, [audiences have a "sympathetic identification
with subversive]{.mark} femininity, with the mother avenging the
murderous [sacrifice]{.mark} of her daughter for political ends, rather
than with the murderous father/king]{.underline}" (104). We enjoy
women's spectacular subjectivization (i.e., their overcoming of
scopophilic objectification) because this distances us from
unfashionable patriarchal formations and tastes (i.e., this latter
scopophilia). In postfeminist neoliberalism, "bearing witness to both
the destruction of women's artistic capacities and women's revolutionary
aspirations" (5) becomes a source of aesthetic pleasure not because it's
revolutionary, but because it's normative. [To use Jack Halberstam's
term, we like our women to "go gaga" because this incandescence, this
"unpredictable feminine" (114) methodology allows us to eke even more
light out of otherwise exhausted enlightenment modernity]{.underline}.
[[If we've reached]{.mark}, as Ziarek discusses, the so-called [end of
art and]{.mark} the end of [history]{.mark}]{.underline} (and the end of
tonality and the end of representation and, well, the end of modernity),
[then **[the only way to find more resources is]{.mark}**]{.underline},
like Pixar's wall-e, [by **[sifting through]{.mark}** our vast piles of
waste. And in that waste heap is abject femininity]{.underline} (what
musicologist Susan Cook calls the feminized "abject popular").
[Femininity is abject because its **[exclusion]{.mark}** from patriarchy
is what constitutes patriarchy **[as a coherent system]{.mark}**. In
both Ziarek's aesthetics of potentiality and in resilience discourse,
women artists do the cultural work of **[remaking]{.mark}** abjection or
**[constitutive exclusion into ecstatic
radiance]{.mark}**]{.underline}.13 In the former case, that work is
revolutionary; in the latter case, that work normalizes. Resilience
discourse transposes feminist revolution into a nationalist,
patriarchal, white supremacist practice. Take, [for example, Katy
Perry's "Firework]{.underline}," in which the lyrics trace the affective
journey from dejection to radiant exceptionality[. The song begins by
asking listeners to identify with feelings of irrelevance, weakness,
loneliness, and hopelessness; it posits and affirms damage, suffering,
and pain. But then Perry's narrator argues that in spite and perhaps
because of this damage, the listener has precisely the means to connect
to others, to make a difference, to have hope:]{.underline} "\[T\]here's
a spark in you / You just gotta ignite the light and let it shine." She
uses the metaphor of fireworks (and their association with u.s.
Independence Day celebrations) to describe the listener's
self-transformation from black dust to shining light: you may feel like
trash, but if you can just light yourself on fire, that trash will burn
with a dazzling radiance that lights up the sky, just as it lights up
audiences' faces. [Here, Perry transforms abjection---feeling like
trash, unmoored, socially dead---into [incandescent triumph]{.mark}. In
the song, the addressee's personal triumph [evokes]{.mark} u.s.
[nationalist narratives of **overcoming
colonization**]{.mark}]{.underline} (i.e., the Declaration of
Independence, celebrated on the Fourth of July). Feminine
incandescence---the transformation of waste and melancholy into glowing
potential---is no longer revolutionary. [Not only parallel to u.s.
nationalism, it is the very means for reproducing normativity. In
resilience discourse, wild and crazy femmes]{.underline}---like, say,
Ke\$ha--- [reproduce normativity in the same way that deregulatory
economic practices do]{.underline} (see Cardenas). [Unlike Kant's
genius, who gives laws and generates order]{.underline} (i.e.,
regulation, giving a law) [out of unruly materiality, the incandescent,
"gaga" femme amplifies what feels like disorder by "resignif\[ying\]
damaged bodies and objects previously expelled from the realm of
meaning"]{.underline} (6). And to do this, incandescent femme geniuses
use a specific type of experimentation, what Ziarek calls "a dynamic
model of interrelation between literary form and material elements of
the work of art" (6). This "dynamic interaction" between large-scale
form and material details produces "effects" that are "unpredictable and
unforeseeable" (Adorno qtd. in Ziarek 114). Experimental methods produce
aleatory results.14 [Neoliberalism]{.underline}, however, [has
systematized the aleatory; deregulatory practices are designed to
control background conditions so that "dynamic interactions" between
form and material produce a range of superficially random
outcomes.]{.underline}15 Deregulation turns experimentation into the
means of capitalist/hegemonic production. [Brilliant gaga ecstasy is
what fuels economic and social reproduction.16 So even though
incandescent potentiality might be "the very opposite of the traffic in
women" (Ziarek 119) figured as the exchange of commodities (e.g., in
Irigaray and Rubin), it is quite consistent with neoliberal political
and aesthetic economies. Who radiates with potentiality more than the
resilient, entrepreneurial postfeminist woman? In the same way that
feminized, blackened receptivity was the solution to modernist anxieties
about alienation]{.underline} (e.g., the aforementioned
Gooding-Williams[), feminized, [racially nonwhite resilience is taken as
a **solution to the problem of the "end of art**."]{.mark} Having
transgressed all limits and prohibitions---for example, emancipating
dissonance, making music out of noise---modernist art had no means of
establishing its opposition to society/social normativity. Similarly,
[capitalism had **colonized the globe**]{.mark}, exhausting its ability
to profit through simple expansion; with no new markets, with nothing
else new to conquer, [it needed a **new method for generating surplus
value**.]{.mark} As Jeffery Nealon and others argue, capitalism has
become a logic of investment and intensity. [Instead of expanding and
assimilating, it recycles waste and increases efficiencies.]{.mark}
Thus, traditionally non- or devalued "women's work" becomes the fastest
growing sector of the service-and-care-work economy. And women's
art-making practices become the hottest new thing in the artworld: think
of all the "feminist art" retrospectives and exhibits that have taken
place in the past five or so years. [Modernism's constitutive outside
becomes neoliberalism's bread and butter]{.mark}; or, [**the abject is
now central to the means of capital, political, and aesthetic
production**.]{.mark}]{.underline}17

**Bifo 12** \[Franco Berardi, Italian communist theorist and activist in
the autonomist tradition, whose work mainly focuses on the role of the
media and information technology within post-industrial capitalism,
"After the Future", Published: 2012, DOA: 7/5/19, Reagan RB for
michklab\]

In After the Future, Bifo iterates Marx's thesis in the radically new
times of digital capitalism. And he finds that the ["automaton" has
multiplied its powers to disaggregate and orchestrate the parts or
organs of labor; the whole psychosphere of the human being becomes
subject to the movement of capital, now operating at digital
speeds.]{.underline} With the networking powers of information and
communications technology the capacities of capitalist work processes to
orchestrate [labor have not only been extended spatially, across the
globe, but have intensified temporally]{.underline} also. Today's [firms
do not purchase the worker as a whole, but a fragment of their activity,
sensibility, attention, communicative capacity.]{.underline} One of
Bifo's most compelling contributions to the theory of "semiocapitalism"
-- **[capitalism that makes affects, attitudes, attributes and ideas
directly productive without materializing them -- is the cellularization
of labor]{.underline}**. [As production becomes semiotic, cognitive
workers are precariously employed -- on occasional, contractual,
temporary bases -- and their work involves the elaboration of segments
or "semiotic artefacts" that are highly abstract entities combined and
recombined through an exploitative digital network only at the precise
time they are required. The social field is "an ocean of valorizing
cells convened in a cellular way and recombined by the subjectivity of
capital".]{.underline} These info-laborers are paid only for the moments
when their time is made cellular, yet their entire days are subjected to
this kind of production, "pulsating and available, like a brain-sprawl
in waiting", Blackberries and mobiles ever ready**[. The psychic and
somatic form of the human cannot take this, and as our cognitive,
communicative, emotional capacities become subject to cellular
fragmentation and recombination under the new machine-speed of
information, we get sick. Depression, panic, unhappiness, anxiety, fear,
terror -- these are the affective conditions of contemporary labor, the
"psychobombs" of cognitive capitalism, each, naturally, with their own
psychopharmacology.]{.underline}** Nonetheless, we actively submit
ourselves to this regime; this is the perversity of contemporary
culture. Of course, the vast majority has no choice -- these are the
structural conditions of work. But the progressive commercialization of
culture, deadening of metropolitan life, loss of solidarity, and
insidious dispersal of mechanisms of competition are such that we have
come to fixate our desires on work. **[Even as it pushes human affective
and cognitive capacities to breaking point, the enterprise form is the
only adequate expression of our communicative and affective qualities,
and the one most able to confirm our increasingly competitive and
narcissistic drives. Such existential "precarity" is not to be solved by
a return to the Fordist model of labor-time and
contract-security.]{.underline}** This was not only a temporary and now
passed formation in the long history of otherwise precarious labor (and
one that was even then peculiar to a particular racialized and gendered
fragment of 5 the working population); it was also the specific object
of workers' resistance in the 1970s, resistance that Bifo and Autonomia
valorized as the "refusal of work". And neither are **[the militant
strategies of the past any longer viable]{.underline}**. For one, Bifo
has no interest in reviving the corpse of orthodox communism. His
opinion of this tradition is abundantly clear in The Soul at Work: The
only relation between the State Communism imposed by the Leninist
parties in the Soviet Union and elsewhere, and the autonomous communism
of the workers, is the violence systematically exerted by the first over
the second, in order to subdue, discipline and destroy it. (Berardi
2009: 85) There is, then, no return to Lenin or Mao. Alongside Hardt and
Negri, perhaps the most prominent and influential of efforts to re-found
a communism adequate to the current conjuncture is to be found in the
work of Alain Badiou. In his later work, Badiou has turned away from the
vanguard model of the party -- he took his time, but got there in the
end. Yet this is because we have entered a new "sequence", beyond that
which was characterized (and, for Badiou, properly expressed) in the
Leninist party form and the Maoist Cultural Revolution (Badiou 2008).
Bifo's difference is that, whether correctly characterized by a series
of sequences or not, communism proper never went by the way of Lenin or
Mao (the "Mao-Dadaism" of Radio Alice was something quite other). As
shorthand for this critique, we would signal the affirmation and
intensification -- not refusal -- of work in the Soviet and
[Chinese]{.underline} regimes. But the problem that Bifo isolates in
these pages is the subjective political model inherent to such orthodox
communism, the "militant", and its not so distant cousin, the
"activist**[". Activism, Bifo argues, is the narcissistic response of
the subject to the infinite and invasive power of capital, a response
that can only leave the activist frustrated, humiliated, and
depressed.]{.underline}** Bifo here locates this modern political
configuration with Lenin, and makes a most heretical statement: "I am
convinced that the 20th century would have been a better century had
Lenin not existed". He diagnoses this condition in these pages through a
reading of Lenin's bouts of depression, but we would highlight that
elsewhere Bifo also identifies the problem in Félix Guattari, a most
surprising move, given the sophistication of Guattari's schizoanalytic
critique of authoritarian political subjectivation. Bifo developed his
friendship with Guattari while in exile from Italy in the 1980s, a
period that Guattari characterized as his "winter years", the
coincidence of personal depression and neoliberal reaction. Under these
conditions, a certain political activism appeared central to Guattari,
but not so to Bifo: "I remember that in the 1980s Félix often scolded me
because I was no longer involved in some kind of political militancy.
... For me, militant will and ideological action had become impotent"
(Berardi 2008: 13). For Bifo, at times of reaction, of the evacuation of
political creativity from the social field, 6 [activism becomes a
desperate attempt to ward off depression. But it is doomed to fail, and,
worse, to convert political innovation and sociality into its opposite,
to "replace desire with duty":]{.underline} Félix knew this, I am sure,
but he never said this much, not even to himself, and this is why he
went to all these meetings with people who didn't appeal to him, talking
about things that distracted him... And here again is the root of
depression, in this impotence of political will that we haven't had the
courage to admit. (Berardi 2008: 13) One can discern two aspects to
[Bifo's analysis of depression. It is a product of the "panic" induced
by the sensory overload of digital capitalism, a condition of
withdrawal, a disinvestment of energy from the competitive and
narcissistic structures of the enterprise. And it is also a result of
the loss of political composition and antagonism: "depression is born
out of the dispersion of the community's immediacy. Autonomous and
desiring politics was a proliferating community. When the proliferating
power is lost, the social becomes the place of depression" (Berardi
2008: 13). In both manifestations, depression is a real historical
experience, something that must be actively faced and engaged with -- we
cannot merely ward it off with appeals to militant
voluntarism]{.underline}. We need to assess its contours, conditions,
products, to find an analytics of depression, and an adequate politics.
And that is the goal of this book, a first step toward a politics after
the future, and after the redundant subjective forms of which it was
made. Bifo finds many resources in this venture of diagnosis and escape,
traversing the Futurist aesthetics of speed, the psychic corruption of
Berlusconi's mediatic empire, transrational language, senility, the
dotcom bubble, the Copenhagen climate summit, the dynamics of
semiocapitalism, and the possibilities of a Baroque modernity. The book
begins and ends with a manifesto. The first, Marinetti's Futurist
Manifesto, opened the century that trusted in the future. Written a
century later, Bifo's Manifesto of PostFuturism, is a rather different
entity, a love song to the "infinity of the present". As the cognitariat
casts off the shackles of self-entrepreneurship and reconnect with their
own bodies, song, poetry, and therapy freely mix into a cocktail that
clears the head of any further illusions of the future.

### Affective Investment

#### The aff's performance of critique and difference in the academy becomes the affective energy that greases the violent wheels of neoliberalism 

**Ferguson 2012** (Roderick A. Ferguson is the co-director of the
Racialized Body research cluster @ UIC, "Reorder of Things : The
University and Its Pedagogies of Minority Difference" 2012. Pgs.
11-14)//NotJacob

[The student movements]{.underline} of the sixties and seventies
[represent]{.underline} both a por­tion and a disruption of this
genealogy. They point [to an academic moment that helped to rearticulate
the nature of state and capital,]{.underline} a moment in which truth as
the ideal of the university and [the mediator of state and civil society
was joined by]{.underline} difference in general, and [minoritized
difference]{.underline} in particular. Moreover, [[the academy became
the "training ground" for state and capital's engagement with minority
difference as a site of]{.mark} representa­tion]{.underline} and meaning.
A historical and theoretical reconsideration of the interdisciplinary
fields means displacing the economic and its thesis that the academy is
a mere reflection or derivation of political economy. In terms of this
narrative of rejection and derivation, we are the inheritors of a
philosopher's deception, the children of a ruse. [The extent to which we
accept the academy and things academic as the designs of the economic is
the measure of our dependence on this trick secured through a rhetoric
of impotence and remove.]{.underline} The modern [[Western academy was
created as the repository and guar­antor of national culture as well as a
cultivator and innovator of political economy]{.mark}.]{.underline} As
such, [[the academy is an archive of sorts, whose
technologies]{.underline}]{.mark}--- or so the theory goes[--- [are
constantly refined to acquire the latest
innovation]{.mark}]{.underline}. As an archiving institution, the
academy is--- to use Derrida's description of the archive---"
institutive and conservative. Revolutionary and traditional. An economic
archive [in this double sense: it keeps, it puts in reserve, it saves,
but in an unnatural fashion, that is to say in making the law (nomos) or
in making people respect the law." 25 The academy has always been an
economic domain; that is, it has simultaneously determined who gets
admitted while establishing the rules for membership and
participation]{.underline}. In the context of the post-- World War II
United States, the American academy can be read as a record of the
shifts and contradictions of polit­ical economy. Indeed, [with the
admission of women and people of color into predominantly white academic
settings,]{.underline} the economic character of the American academy
did not simply vanish. [The academy would begin to put, keep in reserve,
and save minoritized subjects and knowledges in an archival fashion,
that is, by devising ways to make those subjects and knowledges respect
power and its "laws."]{.underline} Put differently, [the ethnic and
women's studies movements applied pressures on the archival conventions
of the academy in an effort to stretch those conventions so that
previously excluded subjects might enjoy membership]{.underline}. But
[it also meant that those subjects would fall under new and revised
laws]{.underline}. As a distinct archival economy, [the American academy
would help inform the archival agendas of state and capital--- how best
to]{.underline} [institute new peoples, new knowledges, and cultures and
at the same time discipline and exclude those subjects according to a
new order]{.underline}. This was the moment in which power would hone
its own archival econ­omy, producing formulas for the incorporation
rather than the absolute repudiation of difference, all the while
refining and perfecting its practices of exclusion and regulation[. This
is the time when power would restyle its archival propensities by
dreaming up ways to affirm difference and keep it in hand.]{.underline}
Ethnic studies and women's studies movements were the proto­typical
resources of incorporative and archival systems of power that re­
invented themselves because of civil rights and liberation movements of
the fifties, sixties, and seventies. [[Part of the signature
achievements of these affirmative modes of power was to make the pursuit
of recognition and legitimacy into formidable horizons of
pleasure]{.underline}, [insinuating themselves into radical
politics,]{.underline}]{.mark} [[trying to convince insurgents that
"your dreams are also mine."]{.underline}]{.mark} [By excavating the
social movements, we may be able to chart the emer­gence of this new kind
of archival economy that transformed academic, political, economic, and
social life from the late sixties and beyond.]{.underline} More­ over,
focusing on the social movements and the denominations of
inter­disciplinary forms that emerged from them might allow us to produce
a counterarchive detailing the ways in which [power worked through the
"recognition" of minoritized histories, cultures, and experiences and
how power used that "recognition" to resecure its status]{.underline}.
The histories of inter­disciplinary engagements with forms of difference
represent a conflicted and contradictory negotiation with this horizon
of power. Seen this way, we must entrust the interdisciplines with a new
charge, that of assessing power's archival techniques and maneuvers. As
Self-Portrait 2000 suggests, the involution of marginal differences and
the development of the interdisciplines, broadly conceived, denoted the
elaboration of power rather than the confirmation that our "liberty" had
been secured. We must make it our business to critically deploy those
modes of difference that have become part of power's trick and devise
ways to use them otherwise. The influence that the student movements had
on institutional life within the United States points to a need to
assess the streams of the academy within political economy. If [[state
and particularly capital needed the academy to reorient their
sensibilities toward the affirmation of difference]{.mark}--- that is,
to complete the constitutional project of the United States and begin to
resolve the contradictions of social exclusion--- [then it also meant
that the academy became the laboratory for the revalorization of modes
of difference]{.mark}.]{.underline} This changing set of
representations, the institutions that organized themselves around that
set, and the modes of power that were compelled by and productive of
those transformations are what we are calling the interdisciplines. [The
interdisciplines were an ensemble of institutions and techniques that
offered positivities to populations and constituencies that had been
denied institutional claims to agency. Hence, [the interdisciplines
connoted a new form of biopower organized around the affirmation,
recog­nition, and legitimacy of minoritized life]{.mark}. [To offset
their possibility for future ruptures, power made legitimacy and
recognition into grand enticements.]{.mark} In doing so, they would
become power's newest techniques for the taking of difference. [What the
students often offered as radical critiques of insti­tutional belonging
would be turned into various institutions'

### Ballots 

#### Contemporary neoliberalism has evolved to both incorporate and profit off of culture, diversity, and identity. You should understand this link in the context of the ballot being a financial exchange which re-inscribes capitalist relations to creative production.

It was, however, in danger of overrating its own importance. Take, for
example, the ambiguity of the term "culture industry." If the word
"industry" is a measure of how far cultural production has extended its
reach throughout modern civilization, it is also a reminder that the
chief motives for this are by no means cultural ones. Like General
Motors, Hollywood and the media exist primarily for the sake of their
shareholders. [It is the **profit motive** that **impels culture to
spread** its sway across the globe. [The culture industry testifies less
to the centrality of culture than to the expansionist ambitions of the
late capitalist system]{.mark}, which can now **colonize fantasy and
enjoyment** as intensively as it once colonized Kenya and the
Philippines.]{.underline} In a curious irony, then, the larger mass
culture looms, the more it appears as a phenomenon in its own right, but
the less of an autonomous zone it actually is. Besides, [[the more
influential this culture grows, the more it **reinforces a global
system**]{.mark} whose ends are for the most part inimical to culture in
the normative sense of the term. The conventional postmodern wisdom is
that this system has now taken a cultural turn. From the rough-spoken
old industrial world, **[we have now evolved to capitalism with a
cultural face]{.mark}**.]{.underline} The role of the so-called
"creative" industries, the power of the new cultural technologies, the
prominent role of sign, image, brand, icon, spectacle, lifestyle,
fantasy, design, and advertising: all this is taken to testify to the
emergence of an "aesthetic" form of capitalism, in transit from the
material to the immaterial. What this amounts to, however, is [that
capitalism has incorporated culture for its own material ends, not that
it has fallen under the sway of the aesthetic, gratuitous,
self-delighting, or self-fulfilling. On the contrary, [**this
aestheticized mode of capitalist production has proved more ruthlessly
instrumental than ever.** "Creativity,"]{.mark}]{.underline} which for
Karl Marx and William Morris signified the opposite of capitalist
utility, [[is pressed into the service of acquisition and
exploitation.]{.mark}]{.underline} There is no clearer example of the
way capitalism is intent on assimilating what once seemed its opposite
("culture") than the global decline of the universities. Along with the
fall of Communism and the Twin Towers, it ranks among the most momentous
events of our age, if somewhat less spectacular in nature. [A
centuries-old tradition of universities as centers of humane critique is
currently being scuppered by their conversion into pseudocapitalist
enterprises under the sway of a brutally philistine managerial ideology.
Once arenas of critical reflection, **[academic institutions are being
increasingly reduced to organs of the marketplace]{.mark}**, along with
betting shops and fast-food joints. They are now for the most part in
the hands of technocrats]{.underline} for whom values are largely a
matter of real estate. [A new intellectual proletariat of academics is
assessed by how far their lectures on Plato or Copernicus boost the
economy]{.underline}, while unemployed graduates constitute a kind of
lumpen intelligentsia. Students who are currently charged fees by the
year will no doubt soon find their tutors charging by the insight. In
moving some of its academic staff to new premises, one British
university recently issued an edict severely restricting their ability
to keep books in their minuscule offices. The dream of our universities'
boneheaded administrators is of a bookless and paperless environment,
books and paper being messy, crumply stuff incompatible with a gleaming
neo-capitalist wasteland consisting of nothing but machines,
bureaucrats, and security guards. Since students are also messy, crumply
stuff, the ideal would be a campus on which no such inconvenient
creatures were in sight. [[**The death of the humanities is now an event
waiting on the horizon**.]{.mark} What ought finally to have discredited
the faith that capitalism has shifted to a new cultural mode was the
financial debacle of 2008.]{.underline} One consequence of such
upheavals is that, for an inconvenient moment, they strip the veil of
familiarity from a form of life that has ceased to be regarded as a
specific historical system. [By throwing its inner workings into relief,
[they allow that life-form to be **framed, objectified, and
estranged**]{.mark}. As such, it ceases to be the invisible color of
everyday life and can be seen instead as a historically recent mode of
civilization.]{.underline} Significantly, it is in the throes of such
crises that even those who are supposed to run the system begin for the
first time to use the word "capitalism," rather than to speak more
euphemistically of Western democracy or the Free World. [They thus steal
a march on some sectors of the cultural left, which in their zeal for a
discourse of difference, diversity, identity, and marginality ceased to
use the word "capitalism"---let alone "exploitation" or
"revolution"---some decades ago. **[Neoliberal capitalism has no
difficulty with terms like "diversity" or "inclusiveness," as it does
with the language of class struggle]{.mark}**.]{.underline} It is
imprudent for the Masters of the Universe to [talk of capitalism, since
in doing so they acknowledge that their form of life is simply one among
many, that like all other such life-forms it has a specific origin, and
that what was born can always die.]{.underline} It may be that
capitalism is simply human nature, but [it is hard to deny that there
was a time when **there was human nature but not
capitalism**.]{.underline} What the [crisis of 2008 put most
embarrassingly on show]{.underline}, however, [was how little the system
had fundamentally changed]{.underline}, for all the excited talk of
lifestyle and hybridity, flexible identities and immaterial labor,
rhizome-like organizations and CEOs in opennecked shirts, the
disappearance of the working class and the shift from industrial labor
to information technology and the service industry. Despite these
innovations, the momentary crackup of the system revealed that we were
still languishing in a world of mass unemployment and obscenely overpaid
executives, gross inequalities and squalid public services, one in which
the state was every bit as obedient a tool of ruling-class interests as
the most resolutely vulgar of Marxists had ever imagined. What was at
stake was not image and icon but gargantuan fraud and systemic plunder.
The true gangsters and anarchists wore pinstripe suits, and the robbers
were running the banks rather than raiding them. [The idea of culture is
traditionally bound up with the concept of distinction.]{.underline}
High culture is a question of rank. One thinks of the great
hautbourgeois families portrayed by Marcel Proust and Thomas Mann, for
whom power and material wealth are accompanied by a lofty cultural tone
and bear with them certain moral obligations. Spiritual hierarchy goes
hand in hand with social inequality. [The aim of advanced
capitalism]{.underline}, by contrast[, is to **preserve inequality while
abolishing hierarchy**]{.underline}. In this sense, [its material base
is at odds with its cultural superstructure.]{.underline} You do not
need to proclaim your superiority to other peoples in order to raid
their natural resources, as long as by doing so you maintain the
material inequalities between them and yourself. Whether Americans
regard themselves as superior to Iraqis is really neither here nor
there, given that it is political and military control over an oil-rich
region they have in their sights. Culturally speaking, [late capitalism
is for the most part a matter not of hierarchy but hybridity---of
mingling, merging, and multiplicity]{.underline}---while, materially
speaking, the gulf between social classes assumes ultra-Victorian
proportions. There are plenty of exponents of cultural studies who take
note of the former but not the latter. [While the sphere of consumption
is hospitable to all comers, the domain of property and production
remains rigidly stratified. Divisions of property and
class,]{.underline} however, [are partly masked by the levelling,
demotic, spiritually promiscuous culture in which they are
set,]{.underline} as they were not in the era of Proust and Mann. In
contrast to that stately milieu, cultural and material capital now begin
to split apart. The brokers, jobbers, operators, and speculators who
float to the top of the system in their spiritual weightlessness are
hardly remarkable for their aesthetic wisdom. [The **breaking down of
cultural hierarchies** is ~~clearly~~ **to be welcomed**.]{.underline}
For the most part, [however, it is less the upshot of a genuinely
democratic spirit than an effect of the commodity form]{.underline},
which levels existing values rather than contesting them in the name of
alternative priorities. Indeed, [it represents an assault less on
cultural supremacism than on the notion of value as such.]{.underline}
The very act of discrimination becomes suspect. Not only does it involve
exclusion, but it must inevitably imply the possibility of a superior
vantage point, which seems offensive to the egalitarian spirit. Those
who prefer Billie Holliday to Liam Gallagher (and what right have they
to judge in any case?) are simply being elitist. Since nothing is more
common than evaluation in pubs and sports stadiums, this aversion to
ranking is itself an elitist posture. Distinctions give way to
differences. The cuisine of Florence, Arizona, is neither better nor
worse than that of Florence, Italy---simply different. To discriminate
is unjustly to demean one thing while falsely absolutizing another. To
judge that Donald Trump has less humility than Pope Francis is to thrust
Trump self-righteously into the outer darkness, thereby flouting the
absolute value of inclusivity; and who am I to arrogate such authority?
From what odiously Olympian standpoint has one the right to pontificate
that feeding a gerbil is preferable to microwaving it? [[The bogus
populism of the commodity]{.mark}---its warm-hearted refusal to rank,
exclude, and discriminate---[is based on a blank indifference to
absolutely everyone.]{.mark} Careless for the most part of distinctions
of class, race, and gender]{.underline}, impeccably even-handed in its
favors, it will yield itself, in the spirit of a whorehouse, to anyone
with the cash to buy it. A similar indifference underlies the historic
advance of multiculturalism. If the human species now has a chance, for
the first time in its history, to become thoroughly hybrid, it is
largely because the capitalist market will buy the labor-power of anyone
willing to sell it, whatever their cultural origins. There are, to be
sure, some transitional tensions at work here. [At present, it is the
economy that is promiscuously open to all comers, and a certain current
of racist culture that wishes to discriminate.]{.underline} A capitalist
market accustomed to being culturally embedded in the nation state,
whose military firepower and social homogeneity served it well over the
centuries, now pitches different ethnic groups together; and the racist
and neo-fascist forces that this unleashes threaten to splinter the
national cohesion on which a globalized economic system continues to
depend. For the moment, then, culture and the economy are in some sense
out of synchrony. While the latter can go global, it is not so simple
for the former to wax cosmopolitan. One can, to be sure, hang around
polyglot cafés or enjoy the music of a score of nations, but culture in
this sense of the term lacks the depth in which values and convictions
need to be rooted. There are indeed international allegiances for which
men and women have been ready to die, not least in the socialist
tradition; but culture, as Edmund Burke was aware, draws much of its
resilience from local loyalties. It is hard to imagine the citizens of
Bradford or Bruges throwing themselves on the barricades crying "Long
live the European Union!" Far from producing citizens of the world,
transnational capitalism tends to breed parochialism and insecurity
among a large swathe of those subject to its sway; and it is toward
racism and chauvinism, not into cosmopolitan cafés, that this insecurity
is likely to impel them. While some forms of culture have increased in
significance, others have diminished. Nobody believes any longer that
art can fill the shoes of the Almighty. Culture as a critique of
civilization has been increasingly eroded, undermined among other things
by the postmodern prejudice that any such critique must address itself
to an illusory social totality from an equally illusory standpoint of
absolute knowledge. It has also come under siege from the intellectual
treason of the universities. [[The **critical or utopian dimensions** of
the concept of culture are **rapidly declining**.]{.underline}]{.mark}
If culture signifies a corporate way of life, as it does when we speak
of deaf culture, beach culture, police culture, café culture, and so on,
then it is hard for it to serve at the same time as a yardstick by which
to assess such forms of life, or to evaluate social existence in
general**[. So-called [identity politics are not remarkable for their
self-critical spirit.]{.mark}]{.underline}** The point of engaging in,
say, English folk culture is to affirm English folksiness, not to
question it. Nobody becomes a Morris dancer in order to satirize the
whole sorry business. At the same time, there are political cultures
(gay, feminist, ethnic, musical, and so on) that are indeed deeply
critical of the status quo. They inherit the dissenting impulse of
Kulturkritik while jettisoning its spiritual elitism. They also reject
its abstract utopianism for a specific way of life. If they challenge
the patrician remoteness of the tradition that passes from Friedrich
Schiller to D. H. Lawrence, with its disdain for modernity, they also
differ from those corporate life-forms that exist simply to affirm a
particular social identity, rather than to cast a cold eye on the social
order as a whole. Nobody but the most sorely misguided of citizens
becomes a Morris dancer in order to overthrow capitalism, whereas many a
feminist has greeted the prospect with acclaim. Political cultures of
this kind combine critique with solidarity in something like the style
of the traditional labor movement. [Yet though identity politics and
multiculturalism can be radical forces**, [they are not]{.mark} for the
most part [revolutionary]{.mark} ones.**]{.underline} Some of these
political currents have largely abandoned their hopes in this regard,
while others never entertained them in the first place. [They differ in
this respect from the powers that drove the British from India and the
Belgians from the Congo. Those campaigns were quite properly a matter of
expulsion and exclusion, not in the first place of plurality and
inclusivity.]{.underline} They also envisaged a world beyond the horizon
of capitalist reality, even if those visions were to be for the most
part thwarted. [Today's cultural politics]{.underline}, by contrast, [is
not generally given to challenging those priorities]{.underline}. It
speaks the language of gender, identity, marginality, diversity, and
oppression, but not for the most part the idiom of state, property,
class-struggle, ideology, and exploitation. Roughly speaking, it is the
difference between anti-colonialism and postcolonialism. Cultural
politics of this kind are in one sense the very opposite of elitist
notions of culture. Yet [**[they share in their own way that elitism's
overvaluing of cultural affairs, as well as its distance from the
prospect of fundamental change]{.mark}.**]{.underline} What, finally, of
the so-called War on Terror? Is it not here that we should look for the
persistence of cultural questions in political society? Perhaps one
might see the collapse of the World Trade Center as a surreal explosion
of archaic cultural forces at the very heart of modern civilization. The
clash between Western capitalism and radical Islam, however, is
primarily a geopolitical affair, not a cultural or religious one, rather
as the recent conflict in Northern Ireland had little to do with
religious conviction. There has been much talk in the region of the need
for an amicable encounter between what is blandly known as "the two
cultural traditions," Unionist and nationalist. It is thus that a
history of injustice and inequality, of Protestant supremacy and
Catholic subjugation, can be converted into an innocuous question of
alternative cultural identities. Culture becomes a convenient way of
displacing politics. As in the case of revolutionary nationalism,
[culture may supply some of the terms on which material and political
battles are joined, but it does not constitute their
substance.]{.underline} By and large, [fundamentalism is the creed of
those who feel abandoned and humiliated by modernity]{.underline}, and
the forces responsible for this pathological state of mind, like those
that give birth to multiculturalism, are far from cultural in
themselves. In fact, the central questions that confront a humanity
moving into the new millennium are not cultural ones at all. They are
far more mundane and material than that. [War, hunger, drugs, arms,
genocide, disease, ecological disaster: all of these have their cultural
aspects, but culture is not the core of them. If those who speak of
culture cannot do so without inflating the concept, it is perhaps better
for them to remain silent.]{.underline}

### Cruel Optimism

#### The aff's suturing of trauma and the disjunct between their identity and debate structures collapses into a strategy of "feeling political together" which is incapable of creating transformation outside the confines of the existing order- the move towards forming and re-forming community based on affective identification presupposes that all differences are knowable, nameable, and assimilable -- this is the strategy of conservative elites to efface differential subject positions and necessitates an outside of community that is beyond identification, unintelligible.

[Intensely political seasons spawn reveries of a different immediacy.
People imagine alternative environments where authenticity trumps
ideology, truths cannot be concealed, and communication feels intimate,
face-to face]{.underline}. In these times, [even politicians imagine
occupying a post--public sphere public where they might just somehow
make an unmediated transmission to the body politic]{.underline}.
"[Somehow you just got to go over the heads of the filter and speak
directly to the people," then- President George W. Bush commented in
October 2003, echoing a long tradition of sentimental political
fantasies and soon followed by condemnations of the "filter" by the
Republican National Committee and the presidential campaign of John
McCain and Sarah Palin]{.underline}.1 What is "the filter" that demands
circumnavigation? Bush seems to be inverting the meaning of his own,
mixed, metaphor. A filter, after all, separates out noise from
communication and, in so doing, makes communication possible. Jacques
Attali and Michel Serres have both argued that there is no communication
without noise, as noise interferes from within any utterance,
threatening its tractability.2 [The performance of distortion that
constitutes communication therefore demands discernment, or filtering.
However steadfast one's commitment to truth, **[there is no avoiding the
noise]{.mark}**.]{.underline} Yet [[Bush's wish to skirt the filter
points to]{.mark} something profound in the [desire for the
political]{.mark}]{.underline}. He wants to transmit not the message but
the noise. [[He wants the public to feel the]{.mark} funk, the live
intensities and [desires that make messages affectively]{.mark}
immediate, seductive, and **[binding]{.mark}**.]{.underline}3 In his
head [[a public's binding]{.mark} to the political [is best
achieved]{.mark} neither [by]{.mark} policy nor ideology but **[the
affect of feeling]{.mark} political [together]{.mark}**, an effect of
having communicated true feeling without the distancing mediation of
speech]{.underline}.4 [[The transmission]{.mark} of noise
[performs]{.mark} political [attachment as]{.mark} a
**[sustaining]{.mark} intimate [relation]{.mark}**, without which great
dramas of betrayal are felt and staged]{.underline}. In The Ethical
Soundscape, Charles Hirschkind talks about the role of "maieutic
listening" in constructing the intimate political publics of Egypt.5
There, the feeling tones of the affective soundscape produce attachments
to and investments in a sense of political and social mutuality that is
performed in moments of collective audition. [This process involves
taking on listening together as itself an object/scene of desire. [The
attainment]{.mark} of that attunement [produces a sense of **shared
worldness**, apart from whatever]{.mark} aim or [claim the]{.mark}
listening [public might]{.mark} later [bring]{.mark} to a particular
political world because of what they have heard]{.underline}. From
Hirschkind's perspective [[the]{.mark} social [circulation of]{.mark}
noise, of [affective binding, converts the world to a space of moral
action]{.mark} that seems juxtapolitical--- proximate to, without being
compromised by, the instrumentalities of power that govern social
life]{.underline}.6 [Speaking above the filter would confirm to Bush's
whole listening audience that they already **share an affective
environment**]{.underline}; mobilizing "the ethical and therapeutic
virtues of the ear"7 would accomplish the visceral transmission of his
assurance not only that he has made a better good life possible for
Americans and humans around the globe, but that, affectively speaking,
there is already a better sensorial world right here, right now, more
intimate and secure and just as real as the world made by the media's
anxiogenic sensationalist analysis. [[This]{.mark} vision
[locates]{.mark} the [desire]{.mark} for the political [in an
alternative commons in the present that]{.mark} the senses confirm and
[circulate]{.mark} as though [without mediation]{.mark}]{.underline}.
What exactly is the problem with "the filter"? [[The contemporary
filtered]{.mark} or mediated political [sphere]{.mark} in the United
States [transmits news]{.mark} 24/7 from a new ordinary created [by
crisis, in which life seems reduced to discussions about tactics for
survival and **who is to blame**]{.mark}]{.underline}. [[The
filter]{.mark} tells you that the public has entered a historical
situation whose contours it does not know. It [impresses itself upon
mass consciousness as an **epochal crisis**]{.mark}, unfolding like a
disaster film made up of human- interest stories and stories about
institutions that have lost their way]{.underline}.8 It is a moment on
the verge of a postnormative phase, in which fantasmatic clarities about
the conditions for enduring collectivity, historical continuity, and
infrastructural stability have melted away, along with predictable
relations between event and effect. Living amidst war and environmental
disaster, people are shown constantly being surprised at what does and
does not seem to have a transformative impact. [Living amid economic
crisis, people are shown constantly being surprised at the amount,
location, and enormity of moral and affective irregulation that come
from fading rules of accountability and recognition]{.underline}. What
will govern the terms and relations of reliable reciprocity among
governments, intimates, workers, owners, churches, citizens, political
parties, or strangers? What forms of life will secure the sense of
affective democracy that people have been educated to expect from their
publics? Nobody knows. The news about the recent past and the pressures
of the near future demand constant emergency cleanup and
hyperspeculation about what it means to live in the ongoing present
among piles of cases where things didn't work out or seem to make sense,
at least not yet. There are vigils; there is witnessing, testimony, and
yelling. But there is not yet a consensual rubric that would shape these
matters into an event. [The affective structure of the situation is
therefore anxious and the political emotions attached to it veer wildly
from recognition of the enigma that is clearly there to explanations
that make sense, the kind of satisfying sense that enables enduring.
[Uncertainty is the material that Bush wished to bracket]{.mark}. [His
desire for a politics of ambient noise]{.mark}, prepropositional
transmission, and intuitive reciprocity [sought to displace]{.mark} the
filtered story of [instability]{.mark} and contradiction from the center
of sociality. [He]{.mark} also wishfully [banished]{.mark} self-
reflexive, [cultivated opinion]{.mark} and judgment [from their]{.mark}
central public- [sphere]{.mark} function. In short, as Jacques Rancière
would put it, **[Bush's]{.mark} wishful [feeling was to separate the
political from politics]{.mark} as such**.]{.underline}9 [In so doing
[he would cast]{.mark} the ongoing activity of social [antagonism to
the]{.mark} realm of the [epiphenomenal]{.mark}, in contrast to which
the affective feedback loop of the political would make stronger the
true soul- to- soul continuity between politicians and their
public]{.underline}. Foucault used to call "sexuality" that noisy
affectivity that Bush wanted to transmit from mouth to ear, heart to
heart, gut to gut.10 From his perspective, at least, the political is
best lodged in the appetites. These are not politically tendentious
observations. Perhaps [[when Bush uttered]{.mark} his [desire for
affective communication]{.mark} to be the medium of the political, [he
was trying]{.mark} cynically [to **distract the public gaze**
from]{.mark} some of [his]{.mark} particular
[actions]{.mark}]{.underline}. But the wish to inhabit a vaguely warm
sense of alreadyestablished, autonomic, and atmospheric solidarity with
the body politic is hardly his special desire. Indeed, in his preference
for the noise of immediacy, [[he has many bedfellows]{.mark} in the body
politic with whom he shares little else politically, namely, [the ones
who prefe]{.mark}r political meetings in town halls, caucuses,
demonstrations, and other [intimate assemblies to the]{.mark} pleasure
of [disembodied]{.mark} migratory [identification that
constitutes]{.mark} mass [publics.]{.mark} [He]{.mark} also
[joins]{.mark} his [antagonists]{.mark} in the nondominant classes who
have long produced intimate publics [to provide the feeling of]{.mark}
immediacy and [solidarity by establishing]{.mark} in the public sphere
[an **affective register of belonging**]{.mark} to inhabit when there
are few adequate normative institutions to fall back on, rest in, or
return to]{.underline}. **[[Public spheres are always affect
worlds]{.mark}, worlds to which people are bound, when they are, by
affective projections of a constantly negotiated common
interestedness]{.underline}**. But an intimate public is more specific.
[In an intimate public [one senses that **matters of survival are at
stake**]{.mark} and that collective mediation through narration and
audition might provide some routes out of the impasse and the struggle
of the present, or at least some sense that there would be recognition
were the participants in the room together]{.underline}.11 [An intimate
public promises the sense of being held in its penumbra. You do not need
to audition for membership in it. Minimally, **[you need just to
perform]{.mark} audition, [to listen and to be interested]{.mark} in the
scene's visceral impact.**]{.underline}12 You might have been drawn to
it because of a curiosity about something minor, unassociated with
catastrophe, like knitting or collecting something, or having a certain
kind of sexuality, only after which it became a community of support,
offering tones of suffering, humor, and cheerleading. Perhaps an illness
led to seeking out a community of survival tacticians. In either case,
[any person can contribute to an intimate public a personal story about
not being defeated by what is overwhelming]{.underline}. More likely,
though, [participants take things in and sometimes circulate what they
hear, captioning them with opinion or wonder]{.underline}. But **[[they
do not have to do anything to belong]{.underline}]{.mark}**. They can be
passive and lurk, deciding when to appear and disappear, and consider
the freedom to come and go the exercise of sovereign freedom. [Indeed,
in liberal societies, [freedom includes freedom from]{.mark} the
obligation to pay attention to much, whether personal or
political---[no- one is obliged to be]{.mark} conscious or [socially
active in]{.mark} their modes and scenes of
[belonging]{.mark}]{.underline}. For many this means that [political
attention is usually something delegated and politics is something
overheard, encountered indirectly and unsystematically, through a kind
of communication more akin to gossip than to cultivated
rationality]{.underline}.13 But there is nothing fundamentally passive
or superficial in overhearing the political. What hits a person
encountering the dissemination of news about power has nothing to do
with how thorough or cultivated their knowledge is or how they integrate
the impact into living. [Amidst all of the chaos, crisis, and injustice
in front of us, the desire for alternative filters that produce the
sense---if not the scene---of a more livable and intimate [sociality is
another name for the desire for the political]{.mark}]{.underline}.
[[This is why an]{.mark} intimate [attachment to the political can
amount to]{.mark} a relation of **[cruel optimism]{.mark}**. I have
argued throughout this book that [an optimistic attachment is cruel when
the object]{.mark}/scene [of desire is]{.mark} itself [an obstacle to
fulfilling the very wants that bring people to it]{.mark}: but its life-
organizing status can trump interfering with the damage it
provokes]{.underline}. **[[It may be a relation of cruel optimism, when,
despite an awareness that the]{.mark} normative [political sphere
appears as a]{.mark} shrunken, broken, or [distant place of activity
among elites, members of the body politic return]{.mark} periodically to
its recommitment ceremonies and scenes]{.underline}**. [[Voting is one
thing; collective caring, listening, and scanning the airwaves, are
others]{.mark}.]{.underline} [[All of these modes of orientation]{.mark}
and having a feeling about it [confirm our attachment to the
system]{.mark} and thereby **[confirm the system and]{.mark} the
legitimacy of [the affects that make one feel bound to it]{.mark}**,
even if the manifest content of the binding has the negative force of
cynicism or the dark attenuation of political depression]{.underline}.
How and why does this attachment persist? Is it out of habit? Is it in
hopes of the potentiality embedded in the political as such? Or, from a
stance of critical engagement, an investment in the possibility of its
repair? [[The]{.mark} exhausting [repetition of the]{.mark} politically
[depressed position that seeks repair]{.mark} of what may be
constitutively broken [can]{.mark} eventually [split]{.mark} the
activity of [optimism from expectation and
demand]{.mark}]{.underline}.14 Maintaining this split enables one to
sustain one's attachment to the political as such and to one's sense of
membership in the idea of the polity, which is a virtual---but sensual,
not abstract---space of the commons. And so, detaching from it could
induce many potential losses along with new freedoms. [Grant [Farred
calls fidelity to the political without expectation of
recognition]{.mark}, representation, or return **[a profoundly ethical
act]{.mark}**]{.underline}.15 His exemplary case derives from voting
patterns of African Americans in the 2004 presidential election, but the
anxiety about the costs of this ethical commitment has only increased
with the election of Barack Obama as the President of the emotional
infrastructure of the United States as well as of its governing and
administrative ones.16 What is the relation between the "Yes We Can!"
optimism for the political and how politics actually works? What is the
effect of Obama's optimization of political optimism against the
political depression of the historically disappointed, especially given
any President's limited sovereignty as a transformative agent in
ordinary life? How can we track the divergences between politically
orchestrated emotions and their affective environments? Traditionally,
[[political solidarity is a]{.mark} more of a [structure]{.mark} than a
feeling---an identification with other people who are similarly
committed to a project that does not require affective continuity or
warm personal feeling to sustain itself]{.underline}. But [maintaining
[solidarity requires skills for adjudicating incommensurate visions of
the better good life]{.mark}.]{.underline} [[The atrophy of these skills
is at risk when politics is reduced to]{.mark} the demand for [affective
attunement]{.mark}, insofar as the sense of belonging is threatened by
the inconvenience of antagonistic aims. Add to this the possibility that
"the political" as we know it in mass democracy requires such a
splitting of attachment and expectation. **[Splitting off political
optimism from the way things are can sustain many kinds of the cruelest

More than ever, [economic rationality is at odds with social
rationality. Economic science is not part of the solution to the crisis:
it is the source of the problem]{.underline}. On July 18th 2009 the
headline of The Economist read: "What went wrong with economics?" The
text is an attempt to downplay the crisis of the Economics profession,
and of economic knowledge. [For neoliberal economists the central dogma
of growth, profit and competition cannot be questioned, because it is
identified with the]{.underline} perfect mathematical rationality of the
market. And belief in the intrinsic rationality of the market is crucial
in the economic theology of neoliberalism. But [the reduction of social
life to the rational exchange of economic values is an
obsession]{.underline} that has nothing to do with science. [It's a
political strategy aimed to identify humans as calculating
machines]{.underline}, aimed to shape behavior and perception [in such a
way that money becomes the only motivation of social
action]{.underline}. But it is not accurate as a description of social
dynamics, and the conflicts, pathologies, and irrationality of human
relationships. Rather, it is an attempt at creating the anthropological
brand of homo calculans that Foucault (2008) has described in his
seminar of 1979/80, published with the title The Birth of Biopolitics.
[This attempt to identify human beings with calculating devices has
produced cultural devastation]{.underline}, and has finally been showed
to have been based upon flawed assumptions. [Human beings do calculate,
but **their calculation is not perfectly rational, because the value of
goods is** not determined by objective reasons, and because decisions
are influenced by]{.underline} what Keynes named [animal
spirits]{.underline}. "We will never really understand important
economic events unless we confront the fact that their causes are
largely mental in nature," say Akerlof and Shiller (2009: 1) in their
book Animal Spirits, echoing Keynes's assumption that the rationality of
the market is not perfect in itself. Akerlof and Shiller are avowing the
crisis of neoliberal thought, but their critique is of radical enough,
and does not touch the legitimacy of the economic episteme. Animal
Spirits is the title of an other book, by Matteo Pasquinelli (2008).
Pasquinelli's book deals with bodies and digits, and parasites, and goes
much deeper in its understanding of the roots of the crisis than its
eponymous publication: "[Cognitive capitalism emerges in the form of a
parasite: it subjects social knowledge and inhibits its emancipatory
potential]{.underline}" (Pasquinelli 2008: 93). "Beyond the computer
screen, precarious [workers]{.underline} and freelancers [experience how
Free Labor and competition are increasingly devouring their everyday
life]{.underline}" (Pasquinelli 2008: 15). Pasquinelli goes to the core
of the problem: the virtualization of social production has acted as the
proliferation of a parasite, destroying the prerequisites of living
relationships, absorbing and neutralizing the living energies of
cognitive workers. [The economic recession is not only the effect of
financial craziness, but also the effect of the de-vitalization of the
social field. This is why the collapse of the economic system is also
the collapse of economic epistemology that has guided the direction of
politics in the last two centuries. Economics cannot understand the
depth of the crisis, because below the crisis of financial exchange
there is the crisis **of symbolic exchange. I mean** the psychotic boom
of panic, depression, and suicide, the general decline of desire and
social empathy]{.underline}.

The question that rises from the collapse is so radical that the answer
cannot be found in the economic conceptual framework. Furthermore, one
must ask if economics really is a science? If the word "science" means
the creation of concepts for the understanding and description of an
object, [economics is not a science. Its object does not exist. The
economic object]{.underline} (scarcity, salaried labor, and profit[) is
not an object that exists before and outside the performative action of
the economic episteme. Production, consumption, and daily life become
part of the economic discourse when labor is detached and opposed to
human activity]{.underline}, when it falls under the domination of
capitalist rule. The economic object does not pre-exist conceptual
activity, and economic description is in fact a normative action. In
this sense Economics is a technique, a process of semiotization of the
world, and also a mythology, a narration. [Economics]{.underline} is a
suggestion and a categorical imperative: Money makes things happen. It
[is the source of action in the world and perhaps the only power we
invest in. Life seems to depend on it]{.underline}. Everything within us
would like to say that it does not, that this cannot be. But the
Almighty Dollar has taken command. The more it is denied the more it
shows itself as Almighty. Perhaps in every other respect, in every other
value, bankruptcy has been declared, giving money the power of some
sacred deity, demanding to be recognized. [Economics no longer persuades
money to behave]{.underline}. Numbers cannot make the beast lie down and
be quiet or sit up and do tricks. At best, [economics is a neurosis of
money]{.underline}, a symptom contrived to hold the beast in
abeyance.... Thus [economics shares the language of psychopathology --
inflation, depression, lows and highs, slumps and peaks, investments and
losses]{.underline}. (Sordello 1983) From the age of the enclosures in
England [the economic process has been a process of production of
scarcity]{.underline} (scarcification). The enclosures were intended to
scarcify the land, and the basic means of survival, so that people who
so far had been able to cultivate food for their family were forced to
become proletarians, then salaried industrial workers. [Capitalism is
based on the artificial creation of need, and economic science is
essentially a technique of scarcification of time, life and
food]{.underline}. Inside the condition of scarcity [human beings are
subjected to exploitation]{.underline} and to the domain of
profit-oriented activity. After scarcifying the land (enclosures)
capitalism has scarcified time itself, forcing people who don't have
property other than their own life and body, to lend their life-time to
capital. Now the capitalist obsession for growth is making scarce both
water and air. [Economic science is not the science of prediction: it is
the technique of producing, implementing, and pushing
scarcity]{.underline} and need. This is why Marx did not speak of
economy, but of political economy. The technique of [economic
scarcification is based on a mythology, a narration that identifies
richness as property and acquisition, and subjugates the possibility of
living to the lending of time and to the transformation of human
activity into salaried work]{.underline}. In recent decades[,
technological change has slowly eroded the very foundations of economic
science. Shifting from the sphere of production of material objects to
the semiocapitalist production of immaterial goods]{.underline}, the
[Economic concepts are losing their foundation and
legitimacy]{.underline}. The basic categories of Economics are becoming
totally artificial. The theoretical [justification of private
property]{.underline}, as you read in the writings of John Locke, [is
based on the need of exclusive consumption]{.underline}. An apple must
be privatized, if you want to avoid the danger that someone else eats
your apple. But [what happens when goods are immaterial, infinitely
replicable without cost? Thanks to digitalization and immaterialization
of the production process, the economic nomos of private property loses
its ground,]{.underline} its raison d'etre, [and it can be imposed only
by force]{.underline}. Furthermore, the very foundation of salary, the
relationship between time needed for production and value of the
product, is vanishing. [The immaterialization and cognitivization of
production makes it almost impossible to quantify the average time
needed to produce value. Time and value become incommensurable, and
violence becomes the only law able to determine price and
salary.]{.underline} The neoliberal school, which has opened the way to
the worldwide deregulation of social production, has fostered the
mythology of rational expectations in economic exchange, and has touted
the idea of a selfregulation of the market, first of all the
labor-market. But self-regulation is a lie. [In order to increase
exploitation, and to destroy social welfare, global capitalism has used
political institutions like the International Monetary Fund and the
World Trade Organization,]{.underline} not to mention the military
enforcement of the political decisions of these institutions. Far from
being self-regulated, the market is militarily regulated. The mythology
of free individuals loyally competing on the base of perfect knowledge
of the market is a lie, too. [Real human beings are not perfect rational
calculating machines. And the myth of rational expectations has finally
crashed after the explosion of the real estate mortgage bubble. The
theory of rational expectation is crucial in neoliberal
thought]{.underline}: the economic agents are supposed to be free to
choose in a perfectly rational way the best deal in selling and buying.
The fraud perpetrated by the investment agencies has destroyed the lives
of millions of Americans, and has exposed the theoretical swindle.
[Economic exchange cannot be described as a rational game, because
irrational factors play a crucial role in social life in
general]{.underline}. [Trickery, misleading information, and psychic
manipulation are not exceptions]{.underline}, but the professional tools
of advertisers, financial agents, and economic consultants. The idea
that social relationships can be described in mathematical terms has the
force of myth, but it is not science, and it has nothing to do with
natural law. Notwithstanding the failure of the theory, neoliberal
politics are still in control of the global machine, because [the
criminal class that has seized power has no intention of stepping
down,]{.underline} and because the social brain is unable to recompose
and find the way of self-organization. I read in the New York Times on
September 6th 2009: After the mortgage business imploded last year, Wall
Street investment banks began searching for another big idea to make
money. They think they may have found one. The [bankers plan to buy
"life settlements," life insurance policies that ill and elderly people
sell for cash, depending on the life expectancy of the insured
person]{.underline}. Then they plan to "securitize" these policies, in
Wall Street jargon, by packaging hundreds of thousands together into
bonds. They will then resell those bonds to investors, like big pension
funds, who will receive the payouts when people with the insurance die.
[The earlier the policyholder dies, the bigger the return,]{.underline}
though if people live longer than expected investors could get poor
returns or even lose money. Imagine that I buy an insurance policy on my
life (something I would absolutely not do). My insurer of course will
wish me a long life, so I'll pay the fee for a long time, while he
should pay lots of money to my family if I die. But some enlightened
finance guru has the brilliant idea of insuring the insurer. He buys the
risk, and he invests on the hope that I die soon. You don't need the
imagination of Philip K. Dick to guess the follow up of the story:
[financial agents will be motivated to kill me overnight. The talk of
recovery is based on necronomy, the economy of death]{.underline}. It's
not new, as [capitalism has always profited from wars, slaughters and
genocides. But]{.underline} now the equation becomes unequivocal. [Death
is the promise, death is the investment and the hope. Death is the best
future that capitalism may secure. The logic of speculation is different
from the logic of spectacle]{.underline} that was dominant in
late-modern times. [Spectacle is the mirrorization of life]{.underline},
the transfer of life in the mirror of spectacular accumulation.
[Speculation is the subjugation of the future to its financial mirror,
the substitution of present life with future money that will never come,
because death will come before]{.underline}. The lesson that we must
learn from the first year of the global recession is sad: neoliberal
folly is not going away, the [financial plungers will not stop their
speculation, and corporations will not stop their exploitation, and the
political class]{.underline}, largely controlled by the corporate
lobbies, [is unwilling or unable to protect society from the final
assault]{.underline}. In 1996 J. G. Ballard (1996: 188) wrote: "the most
perfect crime of all -- when the victims are either willing, or aren't
aware that they are victims". [Democracy seems unable to stop the
criminal class that has seized control of the economy, because the
decisions are no longer made in the sphere of political opinion, but in
the inaccessible sphere of economic automatism. The economy has been
declared the basic standard of decision, and the economists have
systematically identified Economy with the capitalist obsession of
growth. No room for political choice has been left, as the corporate
principles have been embedded in the technical fabric of language and
imagination.]{.underline}

### Feminism 

#### Capitalism has exhausted its ability to profit and has turned to recycling waste -- the 1ACs radical project is normalized and gets coopted in the form of shockwaves that inject life into the failing system of neoliberal hegemony

**James 14** (Robin James, PhD in philosophy at DePaul University,
Associate Professor of Philosophy at UNC, focusing mainly on sound and
music, theories of gender/race/sexuality, feminist philosophy,
continental philosophy, and political philosophy through biopolitics and
neoliberalism, "Incandescence, Melancholy, and Feminist Bad Vibes: A
Response to Ziarek's Feminist Aesthetics and the Politics of Modernism",
VR)

I will consider these topics in order; in each case, I'll summarize
Ziarek's argument and then push it beyond its modernist frame and into
contemporary debates. I begin by explaining Ziarek's account of
[feminist potentiality]{.underline}, focusing on how [specific practices
of transformation and revolt]{.underline} worked and why, given
modernist political and artistic contexts, they made sense as feminist,
antiracist critical/oppositional techniques. I will then argue that
[neoliberal aesthetics and politics co-opt potentiality and transform it
into resilience discourse]{.underline}. That is, neoliberal aesthetics
[takes feminist challenges to modernist patriarchy and uses them as the
basis of hegemonic aesthetic and ideological production]{.underline}.
Brilliantly and insidiously, apparently [feminist work actually supports
patriarchy]{.underline}. This raises the question: if resilience
discourse is designed to automatically co-opt any and all transgression,
deconstruction, critique, and opposition, how does one resist
resilience?2 The second part of the article responds to that question.
There, I rework Ziarek's concept of melancholy and argue that this
updated concept is, if not an alternative to neoliberal resilience,
perhaps a feminist method of handling it. This [melancholy isn't the
failure to get over a lack, but the failure to keep pace with
accelerationism, the failure to overcome harder, better, faster,
stronger]{.underline}. Melancholy is, in other words, [radiance that's
either too fast or too slow]{.underline}, a bad vibe. Potentiality
Potentiality is Ziarek's term for the ability to transform racist/
sexist damage into productive political-aesthetic practice. After first
explaining potentiality, I will argue that it thematizes precisely what
neoliberalism domesticates and puts in the service of capitalist
production and social reproduction. Potentiality gets upgraded into
resilience. Modernist Western art, like [liberal Western
politics]{.underline}, constitutively [excludes both femininity and
women]{.underline}. They are the "[Others" to the patriarchal
"Absolute]{.underline}," as Beauvoir puts it (5). Fine art has been
consistently defined against women's cultural production. Thus, the
first task of feminist art and politics is to be taken seriously as art
and politics; however, because modernity is coherent only when
women/femininity are excluded,3 women's participation will require a
systematic reconfiguration of both discourses. Ziarek focuses her
analysis on this reconfiguration. For Ziarek, the "fundamental question
for feminist aesthetics" is "how the haunting history of destruction and
the ongoing exclusion of women from politics and literary production can
be transformed into inaugural possibilities of writing and action" (5).
How have [feminist authors turned practices conditioned upon their
illegibility as women/feminine into methods and media for reading both
patriarchal damage and women's/feminine creative work]{.underline}?
"How," as Ziarek puts it, "to transform a persisting legacy of the
destruction of women's art into its revolutionary possibility?" (48).
Virginia Woolf, Nella Larsen, and British suffragettes have all
transformed patriarchal damage into feminist practice by [manipulating
constitutive exclusion into a medium]{.underline}, not of inclusion per
se, but [of artistic and political production]{.underline}---what Ziarek
calls [potentiality]{.underline}. To put it in Rancièrian terms, the
"wrong" that situates them as the "those who have no part" in patriarchy
becomes the very medium in which they appear (9). They take "the
impossibility and the destruction of female art" and rework it "into its
future possibility" (Ziarek 102). Damage becomes a resource. But how,
technically, does this happen? According to Ziarek, formal
experimentation is the artistic strategy these authors use to manipulate
illegible damage so that it is perceptible and comprehensible as
disruption. "Formal innovation in experimental women's literature,"
Ziarek argues, "connect\[s\] freedom with the unforeseeable, inaugural
force of the new beginning," producing as a result a "transformative
freedom---the creation of the new and unforeseeable beginning" (42).[4
By experimenting with the instruments that wreak patriarchal damage,
feminist artists distort them to the point at which these instruments
are so damaged that they can no longer play their old tune. The
instruments that rendered women "mute" are "transformed into a process
of writing]{.underline}" (2). But because we are experimenting with
instruments, the sounds that come out may not be recognizable as speech
or music; they will sound pretty noisy, if we can even hear them at all.
In other words, these experimental processes produce aesthetic damage.
This damage refracts patriarchal wrongs back into the system, disrupting
it and triggering its reconstitution into a new paradigm of legibility.5
As Ziarek explains, "Modern literary works render the destructive 'work'
of melancholia \[that is, of patriarchal damage\] 'unworkable' by
absorbing its destruction into their own language. In so doing, literary
practice brings the mute subjective incorporation of the political
crisis into the language of literary texts" (73). Think, for example, of
the band Bikini Kill. Many of their songs bring the abject, in the form
of structural degradation and affective disgust, into the means of
artistic production (Austin). On "Thursten Hearts The Who," they read,
in a broken, screaming voice, a misogynist review of one of their
concerts while barely coherent, noisy instrumentals play in the
background; the aesthetic and affective breakdown deconstructs the
content and the politics of the concert review. In this way, abject
[feminist art takes the "ongoing exclusion of women from political
participation and literary production" and transforms it "into the
inauguration of new possibilities of writing, sexuality, and being in
common]{.underline}" (Ziarek 7). Abjection---both as political exclusion
and aesthetic damage---is the medium through which women artists can
craft distinctively feminist responses to the discourses built on their
abjection.6 Or, as Ziarek puts it, "\[L\]oss and violence \[are\]
aesthetically transformed into new, multiple possibilities" (7).
Damage--- here, exclusion and the melancholic silencing it effects---is
reworked into a resource. Potentiality, then, is the transformation of
abjection into a new beginning, "a feminine modality of possibility that
emerges out of 'waste' and 'futility'" (107). Ziarek's theory of "the
'feminine' aesthetics of possibility emerging out of destruction" (103)
echoes Angela Davis's analysis of the aesthetic/political strategies
used by twentieth-century African American female blues singers.7 This
suggests that an aesthetics of potentiality was used across
media---literature and music---and in both avant-garde fine art and
commercial pop culture. [Potentiality seems to be a common feminist
response to modernist patriarchy]{.underline}. Though it is beyond the
scope of my project here, it would be interesting to compare its
different variations across media, genres, cultural milieux, place and
time, and so on. What, in other words, is potentiality's spectrum? How
does it vary when it is refracted through the prism of different
artistic media and historical/material situations? This question about
potentiality's spectrum is important, I think, because some [segments of
this spectrum have been co-opted to support white supremacist
patriarchy]{.underline}. Modernist feminist [potentiality is filtered
and reworked so that when it is played out in neoliberal situations, we
can't hear or otherwise perceive any remaining noise it might
make.]{.underline} (Which is not to say that it isn't there; we just
don't think it is, or that we have the capacity to hear it. Perhaps the
constant invocation of "capitalist realism" is a bunch of white noise
that obscures feral, undomesticated types of potentiality? In other
words, perhaps we think there's nothing to hear, so we never bother
listening.) As I will argue in the next section, these disruptive
frequencies are tempered into resilience discourse. As other feminist
philosophers have pointed out, [modernist feminist critique has become
normative neoliberal femininity]{.underline} (Fraser). Ziarek's book
contributes to this conversation about feminist co-optation by
identifying the specific political and aesthetic practices that get
co-opted. Because it identifies what is feminist and antiracist about
modernist potentiality, Ziarek's book helps us trace the philosophical
emergence of so-called postfeminist and postidentity aesthetics. These
postidentity neoliberalisms take the form of resilience discourse
because they are reworkings of the critical modernisms Ziarek identifies
in her notion of incandescent potentiality. [Incandescent Resilience A
method for overcoming melancholia]{.underline} (97), potentiality is a
way of bouncing back from the damage wrought by modern white supremacist
patriarchy. For white men, this damage manifests as what Robert
GoodingWilliams calls "skeptical melancholy" (54), or alienation from
embodied receptivity; for women and nonwhites, it manifests as
melancholic muteness, immanence rather than alienation.8 The women
writers Ziarek studies rework this damaging immanence into ecstatic
incandescence, effecting "an aesthetic transformation of loss into art's
own shining possibilities" (115). This incandescence is a two-step
process: the [artist first performs her damage (sparking a fire) so that
she can then be seen to overcome it (radiating beyond her past inertia).
Neoliberalism co-opts this incandescence]{.underline} (or at least the
most visible, legible part of its spectrum), [domesticating its critical
force into the means of producing aesthetic pleasure and reproducing
social normativity. Potentiality has been "upgraded" into
resilience]{.underline}.9 In resilient art, formal experimentation
cultivates, or incites (to use a more Foucaultian term), [shocks and
feeds the resultant shockwaves back into the system]{.underline}.10
[This feedback supports rather than destabilizes hegemonic
institutions]{.underline}. The aesthetic damage through which modernist
art established its heteronomous/ autonomous position of
critique---stuttering, fragmented, degraded, aleatory, dissonant---is
now the very medium of normalization.11 [Neoliberal resilience, in other
words, is a method or process of recycling modernist
damage]{.underline}. For example, if modernist art invested aesthetic
pleasure in the objectification of women (what Laura Mulvey famously
calls scopophilia), [neoliberal art invests aesthetic pleasure in
women's spectacular assumption of subjectivity]{.underline}---what
Ziarek calls incandescence. [If in modernity we liked doing damage to
women, we now like to see women overcome that damage]{.underline}.12
This means that [we expect women to perform their damage as a baseline
from which "good" women then progress. That damage is the fuel for
incandescent fires, so it must be constantly incited and invoked so that
there's something for incandescent women to ignite. In this way,
resilience discourse normalizes traditional patriarchal
damage]{.underline} (e.g., the damage of exclusion and objectification)
as a systemic or background condition that individual women are then
responsible for overcoming. "Undoing \[. . .\] feminism while
simultaneously appearing to be engaging in a wellinformed and even
well-intended response to feminism" (McRobbie 1), resilient
incandescence is quintessentially postfeminist. We, the audience, use
our identification with the resilient heroine as a way to disidentify
with and (supposedly) transgress the imperatives of modernist
patriarchy. This is why, as Ziarek explains, [audiences have a
"sympathetic identification with subversive femininity]{.underline},
with the mother avenging the murderous sacrifice of her daughter for
political ends, rather than with the murderous father/king" (104). [We
enjoy women's spectacular subjectivization]{.underline} (i.e., their
overcoming of scopophilic objectification) because this distances us
from unfashionable patriarchal formations and tastes (i.e., this latter
scopophilia). In postfeminist neoliberalism, "[bearing witness to both
the destruction of women's artistic capacities and women's revolutionary
aspirations]{.underline}" (5) [becomes a source of aesthetic pleasure
not because it's revolutionary, but because it's normative]{.underline}.
To use Jack Halberstam's term, we like our women to "go gaga" because
this incandescence, this "unpredictable feminine" (114) methodology
allows us to eke even more light out of otherwise exhausted
enlightenment modernity. If we've reached, as Ziarek discusses, the
so-called end of art and the end of history (and the end of tonality and
the end of representation and, well, the end of modernity), then the
only way to find more resources is, like Pixar's wall-e, by sifting
through our vast piles of waste. And in that waste heap is abject
femininity (what musicologist Susan Cook calls the feminized "abject
popular"). Femininity is abject because its exclusion from patriarchy is
what constitutes patriarchy as a coherent system. In both Ziarek's
aesthetics of potentiality and in resilience discourse, women artists do
the cultural work of remaking abjection or constitutive exclusion into
ecstatic radiance.13 In the former case, that work is revolutionary; in
the latter case, that work normalizes. [Resilience discourse transposes
feminist revolution into a nationalist, patriarchal, white supremacist
practice]{.underline}. Take, for example, [Katy Perry's "Firework," in
which the lyrics trace the affective journey from dejection to radiant
exceptionality]{.underline}. The song begins by asking listeners to
identify with feelings of irrelevance, weakness, loneliness, and
hopelessness; it posits and affirms damage, suffering, and pain. But
then Perry's narrator argues that in spite and perhaps because of this
damage, the listener has precisely the means to connect to others, to
make a difference, to have hope: "\[T\]here's a spark in you / You just
gotta ignite the light and let it shine." She uses the metaphor of
fireworks (and their association with u.s. Independence Day
celebrations) to describe the listener's self-transformation from black
dust to shining light: you may feel like trash, but if you can just
light yourself on fire, that trash will burn with a dazzling radiance
that lights up the sky, just as it lights up audiences' faces. Here,
[Perry transforms abjection---feeling like trash, unmoored, socially
dead---into incandescent triumph. In the song, the addressee's personal
triumph evokes u.s. nationalist narratives of overcoming colonization
(i.e., the Declaration of Independence, celebrated on the Fourth of
July)]{.underline}. Feminine incandescence---the transformation of waste
and melancholy into glowing potential---is no longer revolutionary. Not
only parallel to u.s. nationalism, it is the very means for reproducing
normativity. In resilience discourse, wild and crazy femmes---like, say,
Ke\$ha--- reproduce normativity in the same way that deregulatory
economic practices do (see Cardenas). Unlike Kant's genius, who gives
laws and generates order (i.e., regulation, giving a law) out of unruly
materiality, the incandescent, "gaga" femme [amplifies what feels like
disorder by "resignif\[ying\] damaged bodies and objects previously
expelled from the realm of meaning"]{.underline} (6). And to do this,
incandescent femme geniuses use a specific type of experimentation, what
Ziarek calls "a dynamic model of interrelation between literary form and
material elements of the work of art" (6). This "dynamic interaction"
between large-scale form and material details produces "effects" that
are "unpredictable and unforeseeable" (Adorno qtd. in Ziarek 114).
Experimental methods produce aleatory results.14 [Neoliberalism,
however, has systematized the aleatory; deregulatory practices are
designed to control background conditions so that "dynamic interactions"
between form and material produce a range of superficially random
outcomes]{.underline}.15 [Deregulation turns experimentation into the
means of capitalist/hegemonic production. Brilliant gaga ecstasy is what
fuels economic and social reproduction]{.underline}.16 So even though
incandescent potentiality might be "the very opposite of the traffic in
women" (Ziarek 119) figured as the exchange of commodities (e.g., in
Irigaray and Rubin), it is quite consistent with neoliberal political
and aesthetic economies. Who radiates with potentiality more than the
resilient, entrepreneurial postfeminist woman? [In the same way that
feminized, blackened receptivity was the solution to modernist anxieties
about alienation]{.underline} (e.g., the aforementioned
Gooding-Williams), [feminized, racially nonwhite resilience is taken as
a solution to the problem of the "end of art]{.underline}." Having
transgressed all limits and prohibitions---for example, emancipating
dissonance, making music out of noise---modernist art had no means of
establishing its opposition to society/social normativity. Similarly,
[capitalism had colonized the globe, exhausting its ability to profit
through simple expansion; with no new markets, with nothing else new to
conquer, it needed a new method for generating surplus
value]{.underline}. As Jeffery Nealon and others argue, [capitalism has
become a logic of investment and intensity. Instead of expanding and
assimilating, it recycles waste and increases efficiencies. Thus,
traditionally non- or devalued "women's work" becomes the fastest
growing sector of the service-and-care-work economy. And women's
art-making practices become the hottest new thing in the art world:
think of all the "feminist art" retrospectives and exhibits that have
taken place in the past five or so years.]{.underline} Modernism's
constitutive outside becomes neoliberalism's bread and butter; or, [the
abject is now central to the means of capital, political, and aesthetic
production]{.underline}.17

### Marxism 

#### Capitalism has morphed from the Marxist time-atom into an precarious economy based on knowledge and signs-commodities

[Is it yet possible to speak of Economics as a science when the
production process is becoming immaterial, unstable, and unpredictable,
and seems to elude the rules of computation that are at the core of the
economic conceptual system?]{.underline} Peter Drucker writes: Keynes,
the post-Keynesians, and the neo-classicists alike cast the economy in a
model in which a few constants drive the entire machinery. The model we
now need would have to see the economy as "ecology," "environment,"
"configuration," and as composed of several integrative spheres: a
"micro economy" of individuals and firms, especially translational ones;
a "macro economy" of national governments; and a world economy. Every
earlier economic theory postulated that one such economy totally
controls; all others are dependent and "functions." But economic reality
now is one of three such economies. None of them totally controls the
other two; none is totally controlled by the others. Yet none is fully
independent from the others, either. Such complexity can barely be
described. It cannot be analyzed since it allows of no prediction. To
give us a functioning economic theory, we thus need a new synthesis that
simplifies -- but so far there is no sign of it. And if no such
synthesis emerges, we might be at the end of economic theory. (Drucker
1989: 156-7) Economics became a science when, with the expansion of
capitalism, rules 64 were established as general principles for
productive activity and exchange. But if we want these rules to function
we must be able to quantify the basic productive act. The time-atom
described by Marx is the keystone of modern economics. **[Calculating
the time necessary for the production of a commodity makes possible the
regulation of the entire set of economic relations. But when the main
element in the global productive cycle is the unforeseeable work of the
mind, the unforeseeable work of language, when self-reproducing
information becomes the universal commodity, it is no longer possible to
reduce the totality of exchanges and relations to an economic
rule.]{.underline}** Drucker continues: In any system as complex as the
economy of a developed country, the statistically insignificant events,
the events at the margin, are likely to be the decisive events, short
range at least. By definition they can neither be anticipated nor
prevented. Indeed, they cannot always be identified even after they have
had their impact. (Drucker 1989: 166) Economic science is founded on a
quantitative and mechanistic paradigm that could comprehend and regulate
industrial production, the physical manipulation of mechanical matter,
but is unable to explain and regulate the process of immaterial
production based on an activity that can't easily be reduced to
quantitative measurements and the repetition of constants: mental
activity. Due to the new technologies, Jacques Robin (1989: 39) explains
how even the concept of productivity fails to resist the challenge
raised by the new realities like growth without job creation. With the
new technologies the majority of production costs are determined by
research and equipment expenses that actually precede the productive
process. [Little by little, in digitalized and automated enterprises,
production is no longer subjected to the variations concerning the
quantity of operational factors. Marginal cost, marginal profits: these
bases of neoclassical economic calculations have lost a good part of
their meaning]{.underline}. The traditional elements of salary and price
calculation are crumbling down. [Mental work is not computable in
precise and predictable terms like the work performed by an industrial
worker. Therefore, the determination of value -- the keystone of
classical economy both as a science and as daily economic practice --
becomes aleatory and indefinable.]{.underline} "Realist" economies (the
economies based on the relationship to a computable amount of labor
time) were governed by their goals: Finality is there in advance,
inscribed in the code. **[The order of goals has simply ceded its place
to a molecular play, as the order of signified has yielded to the play
of infinitesimal signifiers, reduced to their aleatory
commutation.]{.underline}** (Baudrillard 1993a: 59) In Baudrillard's
vision, [the economy therefore appears as a hyperreality, a simulated,
double, and artificial world that cannot be translated in terms of real
production]{.underline}. Consequently, economic science can no longer
explain the fundamental dynamics governing humanity's productive
activities; nor can it explain their crisis. [Economics has to be
replaced by a global science whose characteristics and field of inquiry
are still unknown: a science that would be able to study the processes
of formation of Cyberspace, i.e. the global network of
signs-commodities.]{.underline} In an interview published in 1993 by the
magazine *Wired*, Peter Drucker develops by his own point of view on the
theme of the inadequacy of economic categories associated with the
digitalization of production: International economic theory is obsolete.
The traditional factors of production -- land, labour, and capital --
are becoming restraints rather than driving forces. [Knowledge is
becoming the one critical factor of production. It has two incarnations:
knowledge applied to existing processes, services, and products is
productivity; knowledge applied to the new is innovation. \[...\]
Knowledge has become the central, key resource that knows no geography.
It]{.underline} underlies the most significant and unprecedented social
phenomenon of this century. No class in history has ever risen as fast
as the blue-collar worker and no class has fallen as fast. All within
less than a century. (Drucker, in Schwartz 1992: n.p.) Furthermore,
Drucker remarks that the concept of intellectual property, which is a
juridical concept at the basis of classical economy and the capitalist
system, no longer has any meaning in an age when [the circulating
commodity is information and the market is the info-sphere:]{.underline}
We have to rethink the whole concept of intellectual property, which was
focused on the printed word. Perhaps within a few decades, the
distinction between electronic transmissions and the printed word will
have disappeared. The only solution may be a universal licensing system.
Where you basically become a subscriber, and where it is taken for
granted that everything that is published is reproduced. In other words,
if you don't want everybody to know, don't talk about it. (*Ibid*)

### Topical Discussion 

#### Their forwarding of the resolution solely to evidence its violent qualities is an affective investment in the violent norms of debate that they've critiqued\-\--turning the case.

Thus, \"as hysterics you demand a new master: you will get it!\" [[At
the register of]{.mark} manifest content, [demands are claims for
action]{.mark} and seemingly powerful, [but at the level of]{.mark} the
[rhetorical form]{.mark} of the demand or in the register of enjoyment,
demand [is a]{.mark} kind of **[surrender]{.mark}**. As a *relation of
address* the hysterical demand is [more]{.mark} a demand [for
**recognition**]{.mark} and love [from a]{.mark}n ostensibly [repressive
order than a **claim for change**]{.mark}]{.underline}. The limitation
of the students\' call on Lacan does not lie in the end they sought but
in the fact that the hysterical address never quite breaks free from its
framing of the master. [[The fundamental problem]{.underline}]{.mark} of
democracy [[is not articulating **resistance**]{.mark} over and against
hegemony [but rather]{.mark} the [practices]{.mark} of enjoyment [that
**sustain a**]{.mark}**n addiction** to mastery and a [deferral of
desire]{.mark}]{.underline}.

Hysteria is a politically effective subject position in some ways, but
[[it is **politically constraining**]{.underline}]{.mark} from the
perspective of organized political dissent. If not a unidirectional
practice of resistance, hysteria is [at best a politics of
**interruption**. Imagine a world where the state was the perfect and
complete embodiment of a hegemonic order]{.underline}, without
interruption or remainder, and the discursive system was hermetically
closed. [Politics would be an impossibility]{.underline}: with no site
for contest or reappropriation, politics would simply be the automatic
extension of structure. Hysteria is a site of interruption, in that
hysteria represents a challenge to our hypothetical system, refusing
straightforward incorporation by its symbolic logic. [But, stepping
outside]{.underline} this hypothetical non-polity, on balance, hysteria
[is politically constraining because [the form]{.mark} of the demand, as
a way of organizing the field of political enjoyment,
**[requires]{.mark} that [the system continue to act in certain ways to
sustain its logic]{.mark}**[. Though **on the surface**]{.mark} it is
[an act of]{.mark} symbolic [dissent]{.mark}]{.underline}, hysteria
represents [[an **affirmation** of a hegemonic
order]{.underline}]{.mark} and is therefore a particularly fraught form
of political subjectivization.

The case of the hysteric produces an additional problem in defining
jouissance as equivalent with hegemony. One way of defining hysteria is
to say that it is a form of enjoyment that is defined by its very
disorganization. As Gerard Wajcman frames it, the fundamental analytical
problem in defining hysteria is precisely that it is a paradoxical
refusal of organized enjoyment by a constant act of deferral. This
deferral functions by asserting a form of agency over the Other while
simultaneously demanding that the Other provide an organizing principle
for hysterical enjoyment, something the Other cannot provide. Hysteria
never moves beyond the question or the riddle, as Wajcman argues: the
\"hysteric \... cannot be mastered by knowledge and therefore remains
outside of history, even outside its own \.... \[I\]f hysteria is a set
of statements about the hysteric, then the hysteric is what eludes those
statements, escapes this knowledge \.... \[T\]he history of hysteria
bears witness to something fundamental in the human condition-being put
under pressure to answer a question.T\'\" Thus, a difficulty for a
relatively formal/ structural account of hegemony as a substitute for
jouissance without reduction: where is the place for a practice of
enjoyment that by its nature eludes nanling in the order of knowledge?
This account of hysteria provides a significant test case for the
equation betweenjouissance and hegemony, for the political promise and
peril of demands and ultimately for the efficacy of a hysterical
politics. But the results of such a test can only be born out in the
realm of everyday politics.

*On Resistance: The Dangers of Enjoying One\'s Demands*

[The demands of **student revolutionaries**]{.underline} and
antiglobalization protestors [provide]{.underline} a set of
[opportunities for interrogating hysteria as a political
practice]{.underline}. For the antiglobalization protestors cited
earlier, demands to be added to a list of dangerous globophobes
uncannily condense a dynamic inherent to all demands for recognition.
But the demands of the Mexico Solidarity Network and the Seattle
Independent Media project demand more than recognition: they also demand
danger as a specific mode of representation. \"Danger\" functions as a
sign of something more than inclusion, a way of reaffirming the
protestors\' imaginary agency over processes of globalization. If danger
represents an assertion of agency, and the assertion of agency is
proportional to the deferral of desire to the master upon whom the
demand is placed, then demands to be recognized as dangerous are doubly
hysterical. Such [demands are]{.underline} also [demands for a certain
kind of love, namely, the state might extend its love by **recognizing
the dangerousness** of the one who makes the demand]{.underline}. At the
level the demand\'s rhetorical function, dangerousness is metonymically
connected with the idea that average citizens can effect change in the
prevailing order, or that they might be recognized as agents who, in the
instance of the list of globalophobic leaders, can command the Mexican
state to reaffirm their agency by recognizing their dangerousness. [The
rhetorical structure]{.underline} of danger [implies the continuing
existence of]{.underline} the state or [governing apparatus\'s
interests, and these interests become a nodal point at which
the]{.underline} hysterical [demand is discharged.
[This]{.mark}]{.underline} structure [[generates enjoyment of]{.mark}
the [existence of oppressive]{.mark} state [policies as a point
for]{.mark} the [articulation of identity]{.mark}. The
[addiction]{.mark}]{.underline} to the state and the demands for the
state\'s love [[is]{.underline}]{.mark} also [[bound up with a
**fundamental dependency**]{.mark} on]{.underline} the
[oppression]{.underline} of the state: [[otherwise]{.mark} the [identity
would collapse]{.mark}. Such demands]{.underline} constitute a
reaffirmation of a hysterical subject position: they [reaffirm not only
the subject\'s **marginality**]{.underline} in the global system [but
the danger that protestors present to the global system]{.underline}.
There are three practical implications for this formation.

First, for the hysteric the simple discharge of the demand is both the
beginning and satisfaction of the political project. Although there is
always a nascent political potential in performance, in this case the
performance of demand comes to fully eclipse the desires that animate
content of the demand. Second, [demand allows institutions that stand in
for the global order to dictate the direction of politics. This is not
to say that engaging such institutions is a bad thing; rather, it is to
say that when antagonistic engagement with certain institutions is read
as the end point of politics, the field of political options is
relatively constrained]{.underline}. Demands to be recognized as
dangerous by the Mexican government or as a powerful antiglobalization
force by the WTO often function at the cost of addressing how practices
of globalization are reaffirmed at the level of consumption, of
identity, and so on or in thinking through alternative political
strategies for engaging globalization that do not hinge on the state and
the state\'s actions.

Paradoxically, the third danger is that an addiction to the refusal of
demands creates a paralyzing disposition toward institutional politics.
Grossberg has identified a tendency in left politics to retreat from the
\"politics of policy and public debate.\":\" Although Grossberg
identifies the problem as a specific coordination of \"theory\" and its
relation to left politics, perhaps a hysterical commitment to
marginality informs the impulse in some sectors to eschew engagements
with institutions and institutional debate. An addiction to the state\'s
refusal often makes the perfect the enemy of the good, implying a
stifling commitment to political purity as a pretext for sustaining a
structure of enjoyment dependent on refusal, dependent on a kind of
paternal \"no.\" Instead of seeing institutions and policy making as one
part of the political field that might be pressured for contingent or
relative goods, a hysterical politics is in the incredibly difficult
position of taking an addressee (such as the state) that it assumes
represents the totality of the political field; simultaneously [[it
understands its addressee as]{.mark} constitutively and necessarily only
[a **locus of prohibition**]{.mark}]{.underline}.

These paradoxes become nearly insufferable when one makes an analytical
cut between the content of a demand and its rhetorical functionality. At
the level of the content of the demand, the state or
[institutions]{.underline} that represent globalization [are figured as
illegitimate, as morally and politically compromised because of their
misdeeds]{.underline}, Here there is an assertion of agency, but because
[[the assertion of agency is]{.mark} simultaneously [a **deferral of
desire**]{.mark}, the [identity produced]{.mark} in the]{.underline}
hysterical [demand [is]{.mark} not only intimately tied to but is
**[ultimately dependent on]{.mark} the continuing existence of
[the]{.mark}**]{.underline} state, **[[hegemonic
order]{.underline}]{.mark}**, or institution. [[At the level of
**affective investment**, the]{.underline}]{.mark} state or
[[institution is **automatically figured as**]{.mark} **the
[legitimate]{.mark} authority** over its domain]{.underline}. As Lacan
puts it: \"demand in itself \... is demand of a presence or of an
absence \... pregnant with that Other to be situated within the needs
that it can satisfy. [[Demand **constitutes the Other** as]{.mark}
already [possessing the \'privilege\' of satisfying
needs]{.mark}]{.underline}, that it is to say, the power of depriving
them of that alone by which they are satisfied.\"46

### University 

#### The University is a site of social death, the mass grave of Western culture and the aff's fantasy of radicalizing debate towards wake work plays into the hands of the system by denying the violence innate to the university system itself---only triggering a symbolic collapse can reverse this metastasis as the aff paves over the conditions of violent colonialism which structure debating in the first place

**Occupied UC Berkeley 10**

"The University, Social Death, and the Inside Joke,"
<http://news.infoshop.org/article.php?story=20100220181610620>

[[Universities may serve as **progressive**]{.mark} **sites** of inquiry
in some cases, yet [this does not detract from the]{.mark} great deal of
military and corporate research, economic planning and, perhaps most
importantly, **[social conditioning occurring within their
walls]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Furthermore, [[they serve as intense
**machines for the concentration of privilege**]{.mark}; each university
is increasingly [staffed by overworked professors and adjuncts]{.mark},
poorly treated maintenance and service staff]{.underline}. This remains
only the top of the pyramid, since [[a hyper educated, stable society
along Western lines **can only exist** by the **intense exploitation**
of labor and resources in the third world]{.underline}]{.mark}.
[[Students are taught to be **oblivious to this fact**]{.mark}; [liberal
seminars]{.mark} only serve to obfuscate the fact that they [are
themselves complicit in the death and destruction waged on a daily
basis]{.mark}]{.underline}. They sing the college fight song and wear
hooded sweatshirts (in the case of hip liberal arts colleges, flannel
serves the same purpose). As the Berkeley rebels observe, "[[Social
death is our **banal acceptance** of an institution's meaning for **our
own lack of meaning**]{.mark}.]{.underline}"\[43\] [Our conception of
the social is as the death of everything sociality entails; it is the
failure of communication, the refusal of empathy, the abandonment of
autonomy]{.underline}. Baudrillard writes that "[The cemetery no longer
exists because modern cities have entirely taken over their function:
they are ghost towns, cities of death. If the great operational
metropolis is the final form of an entire culture, then, quite simply,
ours is a culture of death]{.underline}."\[44\] [[By attempting to excel
in a university setting, we are resigning ourselves to enrolling
in]{.underline}]{.mark} what Mark Yudoff so proudly calls a cemetery,
**[[a necropolis to rival no other]{.underline}]{.mark}**.\
[Yet herein lies the punch line. [We are studying in the cemeteries of a
nation ]{.mark}]{.underline}which has a cultural fetish [[for things
that refuse to stay dead; **an absolute fixation with
zombies**]{.underline}]{.mark}. So perhaps [the goal should not be to go
**"Beyond Zombie Politics"** at all]{.underline}. Writes Baudrillard:
"[[The event itself is **counter-offensive**]{.mark} and comes from a
strange source: [in every system at its apex, at its point of
perfection, it **reintroduces negativity and
death**]{.mark}.]{.underline}"\[45\] [[The University]{.mark},
[by]{.mark} totalizing itself and [perfecting its critiques, has
spontaneously **generated its own antithesis**]{.mark}]{.underline}.
[[Some element of sociality refuses to stay within the discourse of the
social, the dead; it **becomes undead**, **radically
potent**]{.underline}]{.mark}. According to Steven Shaviro's The
Cinematic Body, "[zombies mark the dead end or zero degree of
capitalism's logic of endless consumption and ever expanding
accumulation, precisely because they embody this logic so literally and
to such excess]{.underline}."\[46\] In that sense, they are almost
identical to the mass, the silent majorities that Baudrillard describe
as the ideal form of resistance to the social: "[they know that [there
is no liberation]{.mark}, and that [a system is abolished only by
pushing it into hyperlogic]{.mark}, by forcing it into excessive
practice which is equivalent to a brutal
amortization]{.underline}."\[47\]\
[Zombies do not constitute a threat at first, they shamble about their
environments in an almost comic manner and are easily dispatched by a
shotgun blast to the face]{.underline}. Similarly, [[students emerge
from the university in which they have been buried]{.mark}, engaging
[in]{.mark} random acts of [symbolic hyperconsumption and
overproduction]{.mark}; perhaps an overly enthusiastic usage of a
classroom or cafeteria here and there, or a particularly moving piece of
theatrical composition that is easily suppressed]{.underline}. "Disaster
is consumed as cheesy spectacle, complete with incompetent reporting,
useless information bulletins, and inane attempts at commentary:"\[48\]
Shaviro is talking about Night of the Living Dead, but he might as well
be referring to the press coverage of the first California occupations.\
[[Other students]{.mark} respond with horror to the encroachment of
dissidents: "the living characters are concerned less about the prospect
of being killed than they are about being swept away by mimesis -- of
returning to existence, after death, transformed into zombies
themselves]{.underline}."\[49\] Liberal student activists fear the
incursions the most, as they are in many ways the most invested in the
fate of the contemporary university; in many ways their role is similar
to that of the survivalists in Night of the Living Dead, or the military
officers in Day. [Beyond Zombie Politics claims that defenders of the UC
system are promoting a "Zombie Politics"; yet this is difficult to
fathom. For they [are **insistent on saving the University**, on
**staying 'alive'**, even when their version of life has been **stripped
of all that makes life worth living**, when it is **as good as social
death**]{.mark}]{.underline}. Shaviro notes that in many scenes in
zombie films, our conceptions of protagonist and antagonist are
reversed; in many scenes, human survivors act so repugnantly that we
celebrate their infection or demise.\[50\]\
In reality, "[Zombie Politics are something to be championed, because
they are the politics of a multitude, an inclusive mass of political
subjects, seeking to consume brains. Yet brains must be seen as a
metaphor for]{.underline} what Marx calls "[the General
Intellect]{.underline}"; in his Fragment on Machines, he describes it as
"[the power of knowledge, objectified]{.underline}."\[51\] Students and
faculty have been alienated from their labor, and, angry and
zombie-like, they seek to destroy the means of their alienation. Yet,
for Shaviro, "[the hardest thing to acknowledge is that [the living dead
are **not radically Other** so much as they **serve to awaken a passion
for otherness** and for **vertiginous disidentification** that is
already latent within our own selves]{.mark}]{.underline}."\[52\] In
other words, [we have a widespread problem with aspiring to be this
other, **this powerless mass**]{.underline}. [We seek a **clear
protagonist**, we cannot avoid **associating** with those we perceive as
'still **alive'**.]{.underline} Yet for Baudrillard, this constitutes a
fundamental flaw:\
\"[[at the very core of]{.mark} the \'rationality\' of [our
culture]{.mark}, however, [is an exclusion that precedes every
other]{.mark}, [more radical than the exclusion of madmen, children
or]{.mark} inferior [races]{.mark}, an exclusion [preceding all these
and serving as their model: **the exclusion of the dead and of
death.**]{.mark}]{.underline}\"\[53\]\
In Forget Foucault, [we learn the sad reality about biopower: that
[power itself is fundamentally based on the separation and alienation of
death from the reality of our existence]{.mark}]{.underline}. [If we are
to continue to use this conception, [we risk failing to see that **our
very lives** have been turned into a **mechanism for perpetuation of
social death**: the banal **simulation of
existence**]{.mark}]{.underline}. Whereas socialized death is a starting
point for Foucault, in Baudrillard and in recent actions from
California, [we see a return to a reevaluation of society and of death;
a possible return to zombie politics. Baudrillard distinguishes himself
as a connoisseur of graffiti]{.underline}; in Forget Foucault, [he
quotes a piece that said "When Jesus **arose from the dead**, he became
a **zombie**.]{.underline}"\[54\] [Perhaps the reevaluation of zombie
politics will serve as **the messianic shift** that **blasts open the
gates of hell**, the **cemetery-university**]{.underline}. According to
the Berkeley kids, "when we move without return to their tired meaning,
to their tired configurations of the material, we are engaging in
war."\[55\] [[Baudrillard's]{.underline}]{.mark} words about [[semiotic
insurrectionaries]{.underline}]{.mark} might suffice:\
\"[They **[blasted their way out]{.mark}** however, [so as to **burst
into reality like a scream**, an interjection, **an
anti-discourse**,]{.mark} as the waste of all syntatic, poetic and
political development, [as **the smallest radical element** that
**cannot be caught** by any organized discourse]{.mark}]{.underline}.
Invincible due to their own poverty, [[they **resist every
interpretation** and **every connotation**, no longer denoting anyone or
anything]{.underline}]{.mark}.\"\[56\]

### 2NC---Sustainability 

#### We control two uniqueness questions -- a) Sustainability -- we are at the end of art and history, where circuits of capitalism are [tetering on the edge of distention and collapse]{.underline} but are [recuperated]{.underline} through [resilient narratives of society's constitutive exclusion overcoming anti-blackness]{.underline} which expands neoliberal genocide precipitating global annihilation through wars to destroy the present in the name of the future. The expansive nature of capitalism [consumes the globe]{.underline} and [prevents the cultivation of joy]{.underline} within the world necessary to move beyond anti-blackness as affectivity is captured by regimes of control

#### b) Power shifts -- visualization processes don't work the way they think they do -- extend 1NC James evidence -- deregulated neoliberalism sees affective ruptures [not as challenges but as fuel]{.underline} -- while the aff [thinks]{.underline} that power functions by white people like the PRL imposing ideals of blackness which are performed and used for anti-black purposes, the status quo encourages "individualism" and the self-performance of empowerment as emblematic of resilience. Think about the laundry list of "woke" judges who vote aff only to then rip the 1ac behind closed doors as they coach their teams to go for framework.

michklab\]

As soon as the economic breakdown began, as if by miracle, three planes
flew through the skies of Washington and New York. After the events of
September 11, 2001 (S11), miraculously, the capitalism on the verge of
bankruptcy could 59 invest the energies of the whole society (that
displayed signs of exhaustion) in the direction of war[. The general
mobilization of these energies began with a call to a Holy War of the
West against the evils of the world. Here begins the great Manichean
campaign of Good versus Evil. The Good is represented by a group of oil
magnates who have notoriously robbed public funds that led to the
collapse of giant companies. Since the war on the Afghan population
failed to produce any of the promised results, i.e. the arrest of the
heads of the Al Qaida organisation accused of being responsible for the
S11 attacks, the war must be re-launched]{.underline}. A new target is
chosen: the former ally and accomplice Saddam Hussein is the target. The
motivations for a war on Iraq are ridiculous. "Saddam is an enemy of
humanity". Of course, he was one already when he acted on behalf of the
American administration and occupied Iran, as are many of the American
allies such as Sharon and the Saudi dynasty. "He used illegal weapons".
As he did in 1988 with the financial and political support of the US.
"He can make nuclear weapons". Which is improbable. Anyway, the
violations of the nonproliferation treaty are multiple, starting from
Israel. "We need to bring democracy to the Middle East". Nothing could
be more hypocritical. Democracy in the Middle East would require the
departure of Israeli forces from the occupied territories, the
recognition of the political rights of the Kurdish people, and a
reduction of the role of the large oil corporations that for fifty years
have been robbing the resources of those countries whilst influencing
their political life in a direct and authoritarian manner ever since
they sponsored a military coup in 1953 against Premier Mohammed Mossadeq
for trying to nationalize the Iranian oil industry. [The ideology of
security is the product of a paranoia fuelled by the media and geared to
create an economic system of global security that can always feed on new
paranoia. "We need to protect our quality of life". This is the only
sentence that corresponds to truth in the whole of the war propaganda:
20% of humanity does not wish to give up the consumption of 80% of the
world resources.]{.underline} What are the possible scenarios of war in
Iraq? One is that of a rapid victory for the aggressors, the capture and
trial of Baghdad's criminal, the imposition of a relatively peaceful
protectorate, the American democratization of the Middle East, the
progressive clearance of conflict zones, the imposition of a planetary
military dictatorship for good purposes. But does anyone believe this to
be possible? The more realistic scenario entails the possibility of a
fall of the Pakistani regime with the gain of two hundred nuclear
warheads for the Islamic fundamentalists. The most probable consequence
of aggression against Iraq is the explosion of Empire, the inauguration
of the Empire of Chaos. Meanwhile, something came to change the whole
scenario: in the framework of a paranoid clash between fundamentalist
and nationalist fanaticism and nazi-capitalist fanaticism, a third actor
has finally emerged, that we have been 60 waiting for since S11, which
has been built with the stubborn labor of the global movement against
corporations. The third actor came into being on February 15th, 2003 as
millions upon millions marched in cities around the globe in protest
against the war in Iraq. It is the movement of global everyday life that
rebels against war mongering dementia. What we saw on F15 is a movement
that is destined to expand and radicalize. **[But at that stage it will
be a matter of working towards pushing the process of exiting the war to
coincide with that of dissolving of the neoliberal domination of global
capitalism, in order to repose the dynamic of anti-capitalist conflict
in society. Capitalism brings war as clouds bring storms, but in the
course of the war the conditions for a re-dislocation of capitalism are
created. The question of subverting the forces that produced the war
will emerge. Then it will not be sufficient to eliminate the criminal
class that produced the war. It will be necessary to clarify that war is
only the continuation of liberalist devastation by other means, hence,
it will be necessary to cut the roots of the process that led to
catastrophe.]{.underline}**

[[Cries announcing]{.mark} the [**demise** of the university

a]{.underline}n admirable [attempt [to **renew**]{.mark} the [original

[**truth**, **justice** and **democratic debate**]{.mark}.]{.underline}
Giving up on the now largely neoliberal and managerial university system

[critics try to mobilise a renewal of this mandate **outside academia's
institutional walls** with people and groups who represent an
alternative to neoliberal globalisation]{.underline}. [Much of this
mobilisation is in turn done through technologies and discourses of
mobility and tele-communication.]{.underline} Examples here are the
European anti-Bologna 'new university' projects like Edu-Factory, the
various autonomous virtual universities, and the intellectual
collaboration with local and international activists and non-Western
academics. I am referring here in particular to the promising formation
of various extra-academic 'activist-research' networks and conferences
over the last years, like Facoltà di Fuga (Faculty of Escape), Mobilized
Investigation, Rete Ricercatori Precari (Network of Precarious

projects organise events that try to set up dialogues between
non-Western and anti-neoliberal activists and academics, and carve out
spaces for offline and web-based discussion and participation.
[Initiators and participants of [these projects]{.mark} often
conceptualise their positions as relating closely to **alter-globalist
activism** -- positions which hence are [**hoped** to]{.mark}
effectively **[subvert]{.mark} neo-liberalism**]{.underline} [as well as
the **[elitist-managerial university space]{.mark}** and its problematic
method of scientific objectification for capitalist
innovation]{.underline}.

In this paper, I will explain how [such announcements of **the
university's demise**, the conceptualisation of its current situation as
**one of crisis**, as well as the mobilisation of **the true academic
mandate** today which often segues into a **nostalgia for the original
university**]{.underline} [of independent thought, truth and justice,
are themselves paradoxically **complicit in the techno-acceleration
that**]{.underline} precisely **[grounds and reproduces
neo-liberalism.]{.underline}** This is because [the playing out of such
nostalgia typically runs through the problematic invocation of **the
humanist opposition between doing and thinking.**]{.underline} [This
causes the terms and their mode of production to become increasingly
intertwined under contemporary conditions of capitalist simulation in
which 'thinking' is more and more done in service of an economist form
of 'doing'.]{.underline} The aforementioned commendable projects thus
paradoxically appear foremost as symptoms of acceleration.

Moreover, I will argue that [this acceleration]{.underline} increasingly
[renders certain groups and individuals as **targets of techno-academic
scrutiny and violence.**]{.underline} [This increasing objectification
that runs through the contemporary prostheses of the humanist subject
hence spells disaster for non-technogenic forms of **gendered**,
**raced** and **classed otherness.**]{.underline} I therefore suggest
that [this disastrous state of affairs is precisely carried out by the
humanist promise of transcendence, democracy and justice that currently
speeds up institutions like the university, and vice versa.]{.underline}
Following this line of thought through, I claim that [technological
acceleration]{.underline} then surprisingly also [harbours the [promise
of]{.mark} the coming of **a [radical alternative]{.mark}** [to
neo-liberalism]{.mark}, and that it is precisely through the
eschatological performance of this promise]{.underline} -- arguably a
repetition of the Christian belief in the apocalypse -- [that these
activist-research projects and their neo-liberal mode of production may
fruitfully **[become the future objects of their own
critique]{.mark}.**]{.underline} In short then, this paper attempts to
affirm and displace the projects' call for reinstating the original
'true' or transcending the current 'spoilt' university, in the hope of
gesturing towards yet another alterity, through its own accelerated
argument.

I argue that [the complicity of projects like Edu-Factory and Facoltà di
Fuga]{.underline} in technological acceleration [should]{.underline}
primarily [be understood in terms of]{.underline} what I in my work call
**[speed-elitism]{.underline}** (Hoofd, 2009: 201). I extrapolate the
idea of speed-elitism largely from the work of John Armitage on the
discursive and technocratic machinery underlying current neoliberal
capitalism. In turn, I will argue that these activist-academic projects
exacerbate speed-elitism by connecting the latter to Jacques Derrida's
ideas on technology and thought, as well as the late Bill Readings' and
Fred Moten and Stefano Harney's critiques of the contemporary
university. In 'Dromoeconomics: Towards a Political Economy of Speed',
Armitage and Phil Graham suggest that due to the capitalist need for the
production of excess, there is a strong relationship between the forces
of communication and the logic of speed. They connect the logic of speed
specifically to a certain militarisation of society under neoliberalism.
In line with Virilio's Speed and Politics, they argue that [the areas of
[war, communication and trade are]{.mark} today [intimately connected
through]{.mark} the technological usurpation and control of
space]{.underline} (and territory), [and through the compression and
regulation of time.]{.underline} Eventually, Armitage and Graham suggest
that '[**[circulation]{.mark}** has become [**an essential process** of
capitalism, **an end in itself**']{.mark}]{.underline} (Armitage and
Graham, 2001: 118) [and that]{.underline} therefore [any form of
[cultural production]{.mark} increasingly finds itself tied up in this
logic.]{.underline}

Neoliberal capitalism is hence a system in which [the most intimate and
fundamental aspects of human social life -- in particular, forms of
[thought]{.mark} and [linguistic difference]{.mark} -- [are]{.mark}
formally [subsumed]{.mark} under this system by being [**circulated** as
capital]{.mark}]{.underline}. In "Resisting the Neoliberal Discourse of
Technology', Armitage elaborates on this theme of circulation by
pointing out that the current mode of late-capitalism relies on the
continuous extension and validation of the infrastructure and the
optimistic discourses of the new information technologies. Discourses
that typically get repeated in favour of what I designate as the
emerging speed-elite are those of connection, instantaneity, liberation,
transformation, multiplicity and border crossing.
**[[Speed-elitism]{.underline}]{.mark}**, I therefore argue,
**[[replaces Eurocentrism]{.underline}]{.mark}** [today [as]{.mark} the
[primary nexus around which]{.mark} global and local [disparities are
organised,]{.mark} even though it largely builds on the formalisation of
Eurocentric conceptual differences like doing versus thinking, and East
versus West.]{.underline}

Under speed-elitism, the [[utopian]{.mark} emphasis on]{.underline} the
[transparent mediation]{.underline} through technologies of
instantaneity [gives rise to]{.underline} the [[*fantasy*
of]{.underline}]{.mark} the [[networked spaces 'outside' the traditional
academic borders as radical spaces]{.underline},]{.mark} as well as the
desire [[for a productive dialogue]{.underline}]{.mark} or alliance
between activism and academia. This would mean that activism and
academia have become *relative* others under globalisation, in which the
(non-Western or anti-capitalist) activist figures as some kind of
*hallucination* of radical otherness for the Western intellectual. This
technological hallucination [[serves a]{.mark}n increasingly aggressive
[]{.mark}neo-colonial and patriarchal economic [state of
exploitation,]{.mark}]{.underline} despite -- or perhaps rather
*[[because]{.underline}]{.mark} of* -- such [[technologies of travel and
communication]{.underline}]{.mark} having come to [[figure as tools for
liberation]{.mark} and transformation]{.underline}.

So the discourses of techno-progress, making connections, heightened
mobility and crossing borders in activist-academic alliances often go
hand in hand with the (implicit) celebration of highly mediated spaces
for action and communication between allied groups. Such
**[[discourses]{.underline}]{.mark}** however
**[[suppress]{.underline}]{.mark}** the [**[violent colonial, capitalist
and patriarchal history]{.underline}**]{.mark} of those technological
spaces and the subsequent unevenness of any such alliance. More
severely, they [[**foster an oppressive**]{.mark} sort of [**imaginary
'collective' or 'unity of struggles' through the myth of 'truly'
allowing for radical difference and multiplicity within that
space**]{.mark}]{.underline} -- a form of
**[[techno-inclusiveness]{.underline}]{.mark}
[[that]{.underline}]{.mark}** in turn
**[[excludes]{.underline}]{.mark}** a variety of **[[non-technogenic
groups and slower classes]{.underline}]{.mark}**. That these highly
mediated [spaces of]{.underline} thought and [knowledge production are
exclusivist]{.underline} is also shown by Sheila Slaughter and Gary
Rhoades' study of the transformation of higher education in 'The
Academic Capitalist Knowledge/Learning Regime'. Slaughter and Rhoades
argue that new technologies allow the neo-liberal university to
precisely cross the borders of universities and external for-profit and
non-profit agencies in the name of development, production and efficacy,
resulting in 'new circuits of knowledge'. These '[opportunity
structures']{.underline} (Slaughter and Rhoades, 2004: 306) that [the
neoliberal economy creates]{.underline}, I in turn argue, [become
precisely those spaces of imagination that come to signify as well as
being resultant of the university's humanist promise of reaching-out to
alterity.]{.underline} This paradoxically also [**[leads
to]{.mark}**]{.underline} what Slaughter and Rhoades accurately identify
as [a ['**restratification among and within** **colleges**]{.mark} and
**universities'**]{.underline} (2004: 307).

[*[Thought]{.mark}* is then increasingly [exercised]{.mark} in, [and
made possible through]{.mark}, [spaces]{.mark} that are just as much
spaces [of]{.mark} acceleration and
[militarisation]{.mark}]{.underline}. The increasing complicity of the
humanities in the applied sciences within the contemporary university,
and hence the integration of critical thinking and neo-liberalist
acceleration, is also a major theme running through Jacques Derrida's
*Eyes of the University*. Derrida there suggests that
[neo-liberalisation entails a militarisation of the university, claiming
that 'never before has so-called basic research been so deeply committed
to ends that are at the same time military ends']{.underline} (Derrida,
2004: 143). The intricate relation between the military ('missiles') and
the imperatives of the humanities ('missives') also pervades Derrida's
'No Apocalypse, Not Now', in which he argues that [the [increasing
urgency]{.mark} with which [intellectuals feel]{.mark} compelled [to
address disenfranchisement and crisis **paradoxically** leads to]{.mark}
a differential [acceleration of]{.mark} such [oppression through
technologies of instantaneous action]{.mark}]{.underline}. But the
relationship between new technologies and the subject's *perception* of
and subsequent desire for the incorporation of otherness that
speed-elitism engenders, is best illustrated through Derrida's *Archive
Fever* and *Monolingualism of the Other*. [Derrida's [concerns]{.mark}
here [are]{.mark}]{.underline} not so much directly with the
contemporary university, but rather [with [the link between how thought
is situated in technologies of communication]{.mark} (like language)
[and]{.mark} the [emergence of authority as]{.mark} well as
([academic]{.mark} and activist) [empowerment.]{.mark}]{.underline}

### Racial Matrix

#### Multi-Racial White Supremacist Patriarchy is the defining matrix of neoliberalism -- it's the root cause of interventionism and the mechanism by which productive bodies are included to justify racialization and endless genocidal violence against the periphery in the name of saving 'non-resilient' feminine subjects- culminates in extinction

**James 15** (Robin James- Associate Professor of Philosophy @ UNC
Charlotte, Resilience & Melancholy: Pop Music, Feminism, Neoliberalism,
Publisher: Zero Books, Accessed: google books)

Another way of saying that is: [[MRWaSP uses resilience to **cut the
color line**---]{.mark}and [the gender binary,]{.mark} the line between
[homonormative and queer, and to **differentiate**]{.mark} between
[mainstreamable and non-mainstreamable people with
disabilities]{.mark}.]{.underline} (And, to clarify again, by
"resilience" I mean a specific neoliberal ideology, not the general
sense of surviving in the face of hardship and oppression.) [[Resilient
populations who]{.mark} can [**overcome** their
race]{.mark}/class/gender/ sexual/immigrant/religious/ [**damage** in
**socially profitable ways**]{.mark} move closer to the center of white
supremacist privilege, whereas less resilient, precarious populations
move further and further from this center. [Resilience]{.mark}
deregulates the work of racialization, gendering, sexualization, bodily
normalization]{.underline}, and so on; [it [treats racialization/
gendering/sexualization]{.mark}]{.underline}/etc. [[like a deregulated
marketplace]{.underline}]{.mark}. [Traditionally, race and gender are
regulatory mechanisms]{.underline}: they determine to whom and to what
extent specific laws apply. They do so explicitly (e.g., the 3/5 rule in
the US Constitution), and implicitly (e.g., racial profiling).
[[Deregulation]{.mark}, on the other hand, "[displace\[s\]]{.mark}
fordist mechanisms of [social control," like social identities, with
"market incentives and disincentives]{.mark}"]{.underline} (Fraser 168).
[In our post-identity world, we don't directly prescribe what particular
individuals can and can't do]{.underline} (e.g., employment and housing
opportunities must be open to anyone regardless of race or cis-gender
identity[). Rather, people are given nominally free reign to be
"actively responsible agent\[s\]"]{.underline} (Fraser 168), free agents
who play the (supposedly neutral) market for themselves. [With
deregulatory techniques like resilience, "the color line becomes etched
more deeply even as it is, in some quarters, dissolved" into matters of
individual choice"]{.underline} (Sexton 244). [[Rather than tying race
status directly and primarily to **phenotype**]{.underline}]{.mark}
(visible race[), [and then regulating on the basis of **racial
identity**]{.mark}]{.underline} (e.g., Jim Crow, apartheid, etc.),
[[resilience **frames** race or gender as an effect or outcome of one's
response to **underlying, background conditions**]{.mark}. At the
surface level, individual "choice" isn't regulated\... because, at a
deeper level, the game is rigged]{.underline}. Instead of writing rules
for the game (that would be directly regulatory), [deregulation
dispenses with rules and regulates the playing field]{.underline}, the
equipment, players' access to training and practice---[what Foucault
calls "the conditions of the existence of the market"]{.underline} (BoB
140), [its "material, cultural, technical, and legal bases"]{.underline}
(141). A deregulatory institution carefully monitors and adjusts the
conditions in which the game (i.e., the "market") can be played so that
no matter what happens, the outcome will always be one that hegemony has
already bet on. It's a way of fixing the match by managing background
conditions rather than foreground activity. [Background conditions are
not equal, and they're definitely controlled by histories of racial
exploitation, patriarchy, and so on. It's harder to bounce back if
you're starting from behind. Hegemony can regulate without appearing to
or feeling like it's regulating---that's deregulation. MRWaSP is
deregulated, but it is also dynamic. **[Your social/political status in
MRWaSP--- is]{.mark}** thus **[not]{.mark}** taken as **[an immutable
given]{.mark}**]{.underline} (like a "born this way" social identity),
[but as **[the effect of an ongoing process]{.mark}**---the process, as
Lester Spence puts it, **[of being "formed according to market
logic]{.mark}**"]{.underline} (Spence 15). MRWaSP doesn't care so much
who you are, but what happens through you: that investing in you
furthers the aims of MRWaSP, and that these aims are not better
accomplished by divesting your human capital. If the color line and the
gender binary cut inside from outside, human from sub/non-human.
[[MRWaSP]{.underline}]{.mark} doesn't so much cut a tine as [[create a
**feedback process**]{.mark}, one [that's **flexible**]{.mark},
tuneable, [and **tweakable**]{.mark} so that the white always get whiter
and the black always get blacker]{.underline}, so to speak.
[[Racialization, gendering]{.underline}]{.mark}, etc., these [[aren't
lines that cut but **processes that distribute**]{.underline}]{.mark}.14
[The process of resilience **compounds** past successes and past
failures]{.underline}, creating a probabilistic distribution of success
and failure. [Your ability to bounce back from a crisis depends on the
resources at your disposal]{.underline}; these resources (i.e., your
material and social situation) is the result of your response, or your
family's response, to past crises. So, the more resilient you and your
family have been, the more resilient you are likely to be now and in the
future. [Because white supremacy, sexism, ableism, and so on all shape
the background material and ideological conditions in which we all work,
those who have the best odds of **successfully demonstrating** their
resilience are the ones who have the most **heavily stacked decks**.
Moreover, bourgeois, cis gendered, able-bodied people of color are
generally the most resilient ones\...in no small part because MRWaSP has
to make fewer material and ideological compromises to let them in. Thus,
though MRWaSP's methods are dynamic, the overall distribution of power,
bodies, domination, resources, and so on, that remains relatively
consistent.]{.underline} The second half of the book discusses the
relationship between resilience discourse, MRWaSP, and pop music in much
greater detail; it focuses especially on the role of anti- blackness in
ideals of resilient femininity. There I will argue that resilient
femininity plays a very specific and central role in producing African
Americans" as "the exceptions unable to be re-formed" by neoliberal
market logic" (Spence 15). [[MRWaSP is absolutely **anti-black**
**anti-queer**, **ableist**, and **misogynist**. It Is a **strategy**
for producing blackness, queerness, disability, and femininity as
**mutually-intensifying feedback loops of
precariousness**.]{.underline}]{.mark}'5 [Just think about the most
vulnerable populations in the US: it's usually queer people of color,
people whose situations actively deny them the opportunities and
resources necessary to profit from their own resilience. [People in
precarious situations are constantly bouncing back from adversity, but
they don't get to **re-invest** the surplus value they generate back
into their own human capital. **Femininity, blackness, queerness,
disability**]{.mark}, class--- these [have **always** been technologies
for extracting **unpaid surplus value**]{.mark} (e.g.,
[**slavery**,]{.mark} housework, **[commodified labor]{.mark}**).
[MRWaSP just **updates** them to work in neoliberalism's]{.mark}
preferred mode: [**deregulation**.]{.mark}]{.underline}

### Neolib 

#### Neoliberalism is a bloodthirsty form of capitalism that effaces desire and makes violence inevitable- by constantly producing crisis to rationalize its capacity for control, destruction of all life is the very impulse of the economy 

**Wiltgen 5**

How does digital capitalism intertwine with the concept of uncertainty?
What key changes have taken place in the structuring of the world, via
the digital and the biotechnological, what forces have emerged or
coalesced, and ﬁnally, how do they affect the realm of subjectivity and
consumption? Here, Arthur [Kroker]{.underline} has transposed McLuhan
into the twenty-ﬁrst century, [performing an interrogation]{.underline}
[of]{.underline} what he calls the "digital nerve," basically [the
exteriorization of the human sensorium into the digital circuitry of
contemporary capitalism]{.underline} (Kroker, 2004: 81). [This
[(in)formation, "streamed capitalism," rests **not exclusively** on
exchange value, nor **material goods**, but]{.mark} something much more
immaterial, -- [a **post market**, **post biological**, **post image**
society where the driving force, the "**will to will**," has ushered in
a world measured by probability]{.mark}. In other words, this variant of
capitalism seeks to bind chaos by ever-increasing strictures, utilizing
an axiomatic based on capture and control, with vast circuits of
circulation as the primary digital architecture.]{.underline} This
system runs on a densely articulated composition, similar to the earlier
addressed concept of sado-monetarism, [[based upon extensive **feedback
loops** running between exchange value and abuse value. This
assemblage]{.underline}]{.mark}, however, has multiple levels, and not
all are connected to the grid at the same speeds; a number of different
times exist within this formation, including digital time, urban time,
quotidian time, transversal time, etc. [Spatially]{.underline}, the
structure [[relies not on **geography** but "**strategic digital
nodes**" for the **core** of the system]{.mark}, and connectivity
radiates out from these nodal points]{.underline} (Kroker, 2004: 125).
For example, a key site for these points would be the Net corporation,
deﬁned as "as a self-regulating, self- reﬂexive platform of software
intelligence providing a privileged portal into the digital universe"
(Kroker, 2004: 140). Indeed, [his mapping of digital capitalism has
clear parallels with the shifts Katherine Hayles analyzes, in particular
the underlying, driving mechanism whereby information severs itself from
embodiment. [**Boredom** and **acquisitiveness** become the principle
markers of]{.mark} this **[new]{.mark}** form of
**[capitalism]{.mark}**, which provides a rationale, or a new value set
for the perpetual oscillation between the two poles, [producing an
**insatiable desire** for both objects and a continuing stream of
**fresh** and **intense** experience]{.mark}]{.underline}. Perhaps the
most densely argued assessment of capitalism, whose obvious parallel
would be Marx's Capital, is the two volumes by Deleuze and Guattari,
Anti-Oedipus and A Thousand Plateaus. With all the concern over the
theoretical concepts developed in these books, it remains extremely
important to understand the analysis as possessing a fundamental focus
on the question of political economy. [[Capitalism forms, via its
**structural** and **affective matrix**, a system capable of
**unparalleled cruelty** and **terror**]{.mark}, and even **[though
certain indices of well being have increased, "exploitation grows
constantly harsher, (and) lack is arranged in the most scientiﬁc
ways]{.mark}**"]{.underline} (Deleuze & Guattari, 1983: 373). Their
framework for analysis targets the global, where the deepest law of
capitalism sets limits and then repels those limits, a process well
known as the concept of deterrorialization. [Capitalism
functions]{.underline}, then, [by incessantly increasing the portion of
constant capital, a deceptively concise formulation that has tremendous
resonance for the organization of the planet -- [resources continually
pour into the **technological** and **machinic apparatus of capture and
control**, to the **increased exclusion** of the human
component]{.mark}]{.underline} (Deleuze & Guattari, 1987: 466--7). In
other words, [[it not only **thrives on crisis** but one of the
principle deﬁnitions of capitalism would be to **continually induce
crisis**; nostalgia for a "lost Sado-Monetarism]{.mark} or Saint
Fond-Saint Ford 109 time" [only **drives these processes**. The planet
confronts]{.mark} the fourth danger, [the **most violent** and
**destructive of tendencies**]{.mark}, characterized as a turning to
destruction, abolition pure and simple, **[the passion of
abolition]{.mark}**]{.underline} (Deleuze & Guattari, 1987: 229).
Deleuze and Guattari make clear this fourth danger does not translate as
a death drive, because for them desire is "always assembled," a creation
and a composition; here the task of thinking becomes to address the
processes of composition. The current assemblage, then, has mutated from
its original organization of total war, which has been surpassed "toward
a form of peace more terrifying still," the "peace of Terror or
Survival" (Deleuze & Guattari, 1987: 433). Accordingly, [the worldwide
war machine has entered a post fascist phase, where Clausewitz has been
dislocated, and this war machine now targets the entire world, its
peoples and economies. [An **"unspeciﬁed enemy"** becomes the continual
feedback loop for this war machine]{.mark}, which had been originally
constituted by states, but which has [now]{.mark} shifted into [a
**planetary**]{.mark}, and perhaps interstellar [**mode**, with a
seemingly **insatiable drive** to **organize insecurity**, **increase
machinic enslavement**, and produce a "**peace that technologically
frees the unlimited material process of total
war"**]{.mark}]{.underline} (Deleuze & Guattari, 1987: 467).7 [Deleuze
has analyzed]{.underline} these tendencies extensively in his own work,
in particular with his dissection of active and reactive forces in his
book on Nietzsche but also in his work on [Sade and Masoch, where he
points to [a type of sadism]{.mark} that seems [capable of attempting a
"perpetually effective crime," to not only destroy]{.mark}
(pro)[creation but to prevent it from ever happening again, a **total
and perpetual destruction**]{.mark}, one produced by a pervasive odium
fati, [a hatred of fate that seeks **absolute revenge** in **destroying
life** and **any possible recurrence**]{.mark}]{.underline}. (Deleuze,
1989: 37). This tendency far outstrips what Robert Jay Lifton has
described as the "Armageddonists," in their more commonly analyzed
religious variant and in what he calls the secular type, both of which
see the possibility of a "world cleansing," preparing the way for a new
world order, be it religious or otherwise (Lifton, 1987: 5--9[).
[Embedded within]{.mark} the immanence of [capitalism,]{.mark} then, one
can ﬁnd [forces which would make fascism seem like "child precursors,"
and Hitler's infamous **Telegram 71** would be **applied to all of
existence, perpetually**]{.mark}.]{.underline} (Deleuze & Guattari,
1987: 467). One ﬁnal complication in terms of currently emerging
subjectivities, the well-known analysis in Anti-Oedipus where
capitalism, as basically driven by a certain fundamental insanity,
oscillates between "two poles of delirium, one as the molecular
schizophrenic line of escape, and the other as paranoiac molar
investment" (Deleuze & Guattari, 1983: 315).8 These two markers offer
dramatically different possibilities for the issues of subjectivities
and agency, and questions of consumption and the political can be posed
within their dense and complex oscillations.

### Nihilism 

#### Resilient Subjects produce ressentiment that culminates in extinction

Nihilism Unbound

Writing in the nineteenth century. [[Nietzsche argued]{.mark} that
[nothing was more deeply characteristic of the modern world than]{.mark}
the power of [nihilism]{.mark}]{.underline}.[42 Nietzsche's
intervention]{.underline} here [allowed us to]{.underline} move beyond
the well-rehearsed attack upon Platonic reason or Christian faith, to
[focus]{.underline} instead [upon '[the radical repudiation of value.
meaning and desirability.']{.mark} Nihilism]{.underline}, thus
understood, referred to [[the triumph of reactive
thinking]{.underline}]{.mark}. It was all about [the [negation of
life]{.mark}]{.underline} as it appeared to [be [incapable of affirming
that which is properly and creatively different to human
existence]{.underline}]{.mark}. Hence, for Nietzsche, nihilism was not
simply reducible to some historical event in life. i.e. an exceptional
moment in history which could be shamefully written into annals of human
suffering. [[Nihilism was the recurring motor of history]{.mark} as the
[operation of power leads to a will to nothingness that strips life of
any purposeful meaning.]{.mark} Crucially]{.underline}, as Nietzsche
understood, [this repudiation of the affirmative realm of experience is
[something we create for ourselves]{.mark}.]{.underline}4
[Nihilism]{.underline}, in other words, ¡s to be [understood through a
[sophisticated manipulation of desires such that the individual subject
depredates itself]{.mark} to such an extent [that it actively
participates in a custom of political
self-annihilation]{.mark}]{.underline}[. [Central
to]{.underline}]{.mark} [Nietzsche's thinking on]{.underline} the
perpetuation of [[nihilism is]{.underline}]{.mark} the notion of
[[ressentiment]{.mark}.]{.underline} In his On the Genealogy of
Morality, Nietzsche explains this in terms of the slave mentality. This
produces a feeling of [[impotence]{.mark}]{.underline} which not only
[[translates into vengefulness]{.underline}]{.mark}, but more
problematic still, teaches the slave that the only way it can become
free Is to give over to the prevailing reason mastery has set in place.
[Sloterdijk equates this ressentiment with rage, the basis of all great
theisms]{.underline}. [[Such a condition]{.underline}]{.mark}, as
Nietzsche understood, [was 'paralysing' insomuch as it [annuls the
possibility of thinking and acting otherwise]{.mark} and it was
[exhausting]{.mark} insomuch [as life was forced to compromise
with]{.mark} the very [lethality that put its condition originally into
question.]{.mark} Through a spirit of revenge what is lacking is
therefore produced in a double movement,]{.underline} (or [[lack is
not]{.underline}]{.mark} some [[original]{.underline}]{.mark} gesture,
[it derives out of the [ressentiment]{.mark} to [deny us the opportunity
to bring something different into the world]{.mark}]{.underline}. This
raises a number of pressing questions: Could I be that not only have we
become slaves to our biological existence, but [in [claiming false
mastery of the earth we have given]{.mark}]{.underline} to
[[ourselves]{.underline} [an illusionary
sovereignty]{.underline}]{.mark}? For how can we have mastery if
[[that]{.mark} which [we claim to be able to
dominate]{.mark}]{.underline} as the principle force [[makes us
increasingly vulnerable with each passing moment]{.underline}]{.mark}?
Have we not, then, become slaves to ourselves and slaves to the earth,
and resentful of them as a result? Nihilism has [never]{.underline} been
[alien to [liberal biopolitics.]{.mark} It is arguably its [most potent
expression]{.mark}]{.underline}. Its early development can be traced to
Kant's Copernican revolution of the mind. Placing life at the centre of
its universe. Kant forced us to look for meaning beyond the realms of
theological destiny. Whilst this moved us beyond the suffering and
lament of the Christian subject which so irked Nietzsche, Kant's
universal substitute proved to be no substitute at all. [The universal
was]{.underline} [actually denied to us due to the limits of our reason
and our imperfections as finite beings --- imperfections that
significantly proved incapable of moving us beyond the reductionism of
metaphysical idealism and its crude representations]{.underline},
tow[ar]{.underline}ds a more affirmative form of metaphysics that worked
in practice. As Drucilla Cornell writes, 'Martin Heidegger famously
wrote that Kant takes us to the limit of the very notion of critique and
ultimately raises, but does not fully address, the question of who' is
this finite being that must think through the transcendental
imagination.' In a remarkably potent yet tragic stroke. [[Kant wrote the
death of the omnipotent God]{.mark} and the types of docile subjects it
produced who were rendered immobile due to its vengeance and fury, while
putting in its [place a fallen subject that was fated to be forever
incomplete because of the burdens of its own
actions]{.mark}]{.underline}. While Kant's thinking paved the way for
new eschatological forms of power to emerge that took leave of
traditional sovereign moorings, [the fallen subject was compelled to
become resentful of its biological existence. Bios were to remain
forever imperfect by design and fated to be judged accordingly. With
life fated to live [a biologically endowed existence, it is stripped of
its capacity to have a meaningful existence beyond the limits of its
bodily formations]{.mark}, while [political strategies operate by
governing through the problem of finitude,]{.mark} even
though]{.underline} the finite inevitably became a philosophical problem
too difficult to comprehend. As a result, forced to endure a growing
resentment of its unfolding drama, [[liberalism slowly became morally
equipped to continually intervene upon the souls of the living simply by
offering to prolong the subject's existence better than any other
political rationality]{.underline}]{.mark}. Such was the realization of
our finite entrapment in the bodily form that the ability to
philosophically transgress the injunction between life and death became
increasingly impossible. Indeed, as we shall point out later, while
liberal societies have a particular relationship to the question of
dying as our existence is continually put into question, such that with
each passing second we learn to survive until we become truly
meaningless in the end, the idea of death remains incommensurable to the
liberal subject[. [No longer does the resilient subject solely project
its resentfulness onto the souls of 'Others'. It resents the living
world]{.mark},]{.underline} for [[it too is radically
endangering]{.underline}]{.mark}. It is here that catastrophic
imaginaries begin to truly thrive. The resilient subject is shaped and
anxiously mobilized by the prospect of the coming catastrophe. It fears
the transformation of the subject, just as it fears the transformation
of the ecosystem that gives sustenance to life. [Our rage]{.underline}
as such, to borrow from Sloterdijk, [has become truly
limitless]{.underline}. [[As everything becomes]{.underline}]{.mark} the
[[source of]{.underline}]{.mark} our [[endangerment, we
internalize]{.underline}]{.mark} the [[ressentiment and
proliferate]{.underline}]{.mark} our [impotence with unrivaled intensity
and absolute necessity]{.underline}. Hence this produces [[a form of
nihilism which is 'unbounded']{.underline}]{.mark}. For [[no longer do
we simply resent the teleological unfolding of history as we phase shift
from masters to slaves to masters: there is no mastery to speak of and
as a result]{.mark} all our lament filters into a politics of
ressentiment as [we are left to simply govern through our continually
unfolding state of unending emergency]{.mark}]{.underline}

Like the previous axiom's question---Why collect narratives of
pain?---**[[we ask nonrhetorically, what knowledges does the academy
deserve? Beyond narratives of pain, there may be language, experiences,
and wisdoms better left alone]{.underline}]{.mark}** by social science.
[Paula Gunn Allen]{.underline} (1998) [notes that for many Indigenous
peoples, "a person is expected to know no more than is necessary,
sufficient and congruent with their spiritual and social
place"]{.underline} (p. 56). To apply this idea to the production of
social science research, [[**we might think of this as a differentiation
between what is made public and what is kept sacred.**]{.mark} Not
everything, or even most things, uncovered]{.underline} in a research
process [need to be reported in academic]{.underline} journals or
[settings. Contrasting Indigenous relationships to knowledge with
settler relationships to knowledge]{.underline}, Gunn Allen remarks, In
the white world, information is to be saved and analyzed at all costs.
It is not seen as residing in the minds and molecules of human beings,
but as---dare I say it?--- transcendent. Civilization and its attendant
virtues of freedom and primacy depend on the accessibility of millions
of megabytes of data; no matter that the data has lost its meaning by
virtue of loss of its human context . . . the white world has a
different set of values \[from the Indigenous world\], one which
requires learning all and telling all in the interests of knowledge,
objectivity, and freedom. This ethos and its obverse---a nearly neurotic
distress in the presence of secrets and mystery---underlie much of
modern American culture (p. 59) As social science researchers, [[there
are stories that are entrusted to us, stories that are told to
us]{.underline}]{.mark} because research is a human activity, [[and we
make meaningful relationships with participants in our
work.]{.underline}]{.mark} At times we come to individuals and
communities with promises of proper procedure and
confidentiality-anonymity in hand, and are told, "Oh, we're not worried
about that; we trust you!" Or, "You don't need to tell us all that; we
know you will do the right thing by us." [Doing]{.underline} social
science [research is intimate work, worked that is strained by a tension
between informants' expectations that something useful or helpful will
come from the divulging of (deep) secrets, and the academy's voracious
hunger for the secrets. [This is not just a question of getting
permission to tell a story]{.mark} through a signature on an
IRB-approved participant consent form. [Permission]{.mark} is an
individualizing discourse---it [situates collective wisdom as individual
property to be signed away.]{.mark}]{.underline} Tissue samples, blood
draws, and cheek swabs are not only our own; the DNA contained in them
is shared by our relatives, our ancestors, our future generations (most
evident when blood samples are misused as bounty for biopiracy.)
**[[This is equally true of stories.]{.underline}]{.mark}** Furthermore,
power is protected by such a collapse of ethics into litigation-proof
relationships between individual and research institution.
**[[Power]{.underline}]{.mark}**, which deserves the most careful
scrutiny, [**[will never sign such a permission slip.]{.underline}**3
[There are also stories that we overhear, because when our research is
going well, we are really in peoples' lives. Though it is tempting, and
though it would be easy to do so, **these stories are not
simply**]{.underline} ]{.mark}**[y/[ours to take.]{.mark}]{.underline}**
In our work, we come across stories, vignettes, moments, turns of
phrase, pauses, that would humiliate participants to share, or are too
sensationalist to publish. Novice researchers in doctoral and master's
programs are often encouraged to do research on what or who is most
available to them. [[People who are underrepresented in the academy by
social location]{.underline}]{.mark}---race or ethnicity, indigeneity,
class, gender, sexuality, or ability---[[frequently experience a
pressure to become the]{.mark} n/ [Native informant]{.mark}, and might
begin to suspect that some members of the academy perceive them as a
route of easy access to communities that have so far largely eluded
researchers.]{.underline} Doctoral programs, dissertations, and the
master's thesis process tacitly encourage novice researchers to reach
for low-hanging fruit. These are stories and data that require little
effort---and what we know from years and years of academic colonialism
is that it is easy to do research on people in pain. [That kind of
voyeurism practically writes itself.]{.underline} "Just get the
dissertation or thesis finished," novice researchers are told. The
theorem of lowhanging fruit stands for pretenured faculty too: "Just
publish, just produce; research in the way you want to after tenure,
later." This is how the academy reproduces its own irrepressible
irresponsibility. [[Adding to the complexity, many of us also bring to
our work in the academy our family and community legacies of having been
researched. As the researched, we carry stories from grandmothers' laps
and breaths, from below deck, from on the run, from inside closets, from
exclaves. We carry the proof of oppression on our backs, under our
fingernails; and we carry the proof of our
survivance]{.underline}]{.mark} (Vizenor, 2008) [[in our photo boxes,
our calluses, our wombs, our dreams. **These stories, too, are not
always ours to give away, though they are sometimes the very us of
us.**]{.mark}]{.underline} It needs to be said that we are not arguing
for silence. [Stories are meant to be passed along appropriately,
especially among loved ones]{.underline}, but not all of them as social
science research. [Although such knowledge is often a source of wisdom
that informs the perspectives in our writing, we do not intend to share
them]{.underline} as social science research. [**[It is enough that we
know them.]{.mark}** Kahnawake scholar Audra Simpson asks]{.underline}
the following questions of her own ethnographic work with members of her
nation: **["Can I do this and still come home; what am I revealing here
and why? Where will this get us? Who benefits from this and
why?"]{.underline}** (2007, p. 78). These questions force researchers to
contend with the strategies of producing legitimated knowledge based on
the colonization of knowledge. [Indigenous and non-Indigenous scholars
of Native education have queried the dangers of appropriation of Native
knowledge by mainstream research and pedagogical
institutions]{.underline} (e.g., Castagno & Brayboy, 2008; Lomawaima &
McCarty, 2006; Richardson, 2011). Lomawaima and McCarty (2006) describe
the "safety zone" as ways in which [Indigenous knowledges are included
into even overtly antiIndian spaces]{.underline} such as boarding
schools designed to assimilate Native children. Indigenous knowledge is
made harmless to settler colonial pedagogies by relegating it to the
safety zone of the margins. Troy [Richardson extends this analysis by
discussing "inclusion as enclosure"]{.underline} (2011, p.332), [the
encircling of Native education as part of a well-intentioned
multiculturalist agenda.]{.underline} Such gestures, he contends, reduce
the Indigenous curriculum to a supplement to a standard curriculum.
Moreover, [some narratives die a little when contained]{.underline}
within the metanarrative of social science. Richardson (2011) theorizes
Gerald Vizenor's concept of trickster knowledge and the play of shadows
to articulate a "shadow curriculum" that exceeds the material objects of
reference---where much meaning is made in silence surrounding the words,
where memories are not simply reflections of a referent experience but
dynamic in themselves. "The shadow is the silence that inherits the
words; shadows are the motions that mean the silence" (Vizenor, 1993,
p.7). Extending Richardson's analysis of Vizenor's work, [beneath the
intent gaze]{.underline} of the social scientific lens, shadow [stories
lose their silences, their play of meaning. The stories extracted from
the shadows]{.underline} by social science research [frequently become
relics of cultural anthropological descriptions of "tradition" and
difference from occidental cultures.]{.underline} Vizenor observes these
to be the "denials of tribal wisdom in the literature of dominance, and
the morass of social science theories" (Vizenor, 1993, p. 8). Said
another way, [the academy as an apparatus of settler colonial knowledge
already domesticates, denies, and dominates other forms of
knowledge.]{.underline} It too refuses. It sets limits, but disguises
itself as limitless. Frederic Jameson (1981) writes, "\[H\]istory is
what hurts. It is what refuses desire and sets inexorable limits to
individual as well as collective praxis" (p. 102). For Jameson, history
is a master narrative of inevitability, the logic of teleos and
totality: All events are interconnected and all lead toward the same
horizon of progress. The relentlessness of the master narrative is what
hurts people who find themselves on the outside or the underside of that
narrative. History as master narrative appropriates the voices, stories,
and histories of all Others, thus limiting their representational
possibilities, their expression as epistemological paradigms in
themselves. [[Academic knowledge is particular and privileged, yet
disguises itself as universal and common;]{.mark} it is settler
colonial]{.underline}; it already refuses desire; [[it sets limits to
potentially dangerous Other knowledges;]{.underline} **[it does so
through erasure, but importantly also through
inclusion]{.underline}**]{.mark}, and its own imperceptibility.

#### As capitalism withers away we must save desire and autonomy by withdrawing from impositions like the maintenance of a neoliberal subject. We must use the current recession as an opportunity to proliferate singularities as self creative processes capable of retaining value and sustaining freedom.

**Bifo 12** \[Franco Berardi, Italian communist theorist and activist in
the autonomist tradition, whose work mainly focuses on the role of the
media and information technology within post-industrial capitalism,
"After the Future", Published: 2012, DOA: 7/5/19, Reagan RB for
michklab\]

Activism has generally conceived the process of subjectivation in terms
of resistance. In the book he dedicated to Foucault, Gilles Deleuze
speaks about subjectivity, and identifies processes of subjectivation
and resistance: \"Is not life this capacity to resist force?\'^1^
(Deleuze 1988, 77). I think that [it\'s time to ask: what if society can
no longer resist the destructive effects of unbounded capitalism? What
if society can no longer resist the devastating power of financial
accumulation? The identification of the subject with resistance is
dangerous in a certain sense.]{.underline} Deleuze himself has written
that when we escape we are not simply escaping, but also looking for a
new weapon. , [We have to disentangle autonomy from
resistance]{.underline}. And if we want to do that, [we have to
disentangle desire from energy. The prevailing focus of modern
capitalism has been energy: the ability to produce, to compete, to
dominate]{.underline}. A sort of *Energolatria[,]{.underline}* [a cult
of energy, has dominated the cultural scene of the West from Faust to
the Futurists. The ever growing availability of energy has been its
dogma. Now we know that energy isn\'t boundless. In the social psyche of
the West, en­ergy is fading.]{.underline} I think [we should reframe the
concept and practice of autonomy from this point of view. The social
body is unable to reaffirm its rights against the wild assertiveness of
capital, because the pursuit of rights can never be dissociated from the
exercise of force.]{.underline} When workers were strong in [the 1960s
and 1970s]{.underline}, they did not restrict themselves to asking for
their rights, to peaceful demonstra­tions of their will. [They acted in
solidarity, refusing to work, redistrib­uting wealth, sharing things,
services, and spaces. Capitalists]{.underline}, on their side, do not
merely ask or demonstrate, [they do not simply declare their wish; they
enact it]{.underline}. They make things happen, they invest, dis-invest,
displace, they destroy and they build. [Only force makes au­tonomy
possible in the relation between capital and society. But what is
force?]{.underline} What is force nowadays? The identification of desire
with energy has produced the identi­fication of force with violence that
turned out so badly for the Italian movement in the 1970s and 1980s. We
have to distinguish energy and desire[. Energy is falling, but desire
has to be saved]{.underline}. Similarly, [we have to distinguish force
from violence. Fighting power with violence is suicidal or useless
nowadays]{.underline}. How can we think of activists going against
professional organizations of killers in the mold of Blackwater,
Haliburton, secret services, mafias? [Only suicide has proved to be
efficient in the struggle against power]{.underline}. And actually
[suicide has become decisive in contemporary his­tory. The dark side of
the multitude meets here the loneliness of death. Activist culture
should avoid the danger of becoming a culture of re­sentment.
Acknowledging the irreversibility of the catastrophic trends that
capitalism has inscribed in the history of society does not mean
renouncing it]{.underline}. On the contrary, [we have today a new
cultural task: to live the inevitable with a relaxed soul. To call forth
a big wave of withdrawal, of massive dissociation, of desertion from the
scene of the economy, of nonparticipation in the fake show of politics.
The crucial focus of social transformation is creative singularity. The
existence of singularities is not to be conceived as a personal way to
salvation, they may become a contagious force.]{.underline} \"Yes we
can,\" the slogan of Barack Obama\'s campaign, the three words that
mobilized the hope and political energies of the American people in
2008, have a disturbing echo just one year after his victory. They sound
much more like an exorcism than a promise. \"Yes we can\" may be read as
a lapse in the Freudian sense, a sign coming from the collective
subconscious, a diversion from the hidden intuition that, in fact, we
*can\'t.* The mantra of Barack Obama has gathered the energies of the
best part of the American people, and collected the best of the American
cultural legacy. But what about the results? So far, Obama has been
unable to deal with global environmental threats, the effects of the
geopolitical disaster produced by Cheney-Bush, the effects of the
powerful lob­bies imposing the interest of the corporations (for.
instance, of the pri­vate health insurers). [When we think of the
ecological catastrophe, of geopolitical threats, of economic collapse
provoked by the financial politics of neoliberalism, it\'s hard to
dispel the feeling that irrevers­ible trends are already at work within
the world machine. Political will seems paralyzed in the face of the
economic power of the criminal class]{.underline}. The age of modern
social civilization seems on the brink of dis­solution, and it\'s hard to
imagine how society will be able to react. Modern civilization was based
on the convergence and integration of the capitalist exploitation of
labor and the political regulation of social conflict. The regulator
State, the heir of Enlightenment and Socialism has been the guarantor of
human rights and the negotiator of social equilibrium.
[When]{.underline}, at the end of a ferocious class struggle between
labor and capital---and within the capitalist class itself---[the
financial class has seized power by destroying the legal regulation and
transform­ing social composition, the entire edifice of modern
civilization has begun to crumble. Social Darwinist ideology has
legitimized the violent imposition of the law of the strongest, and the
very foundations of democracy have been reduced to rubble. This
accelerated destruction of tolerance, culture, and human feelings has
given an unprecedented impetus to the process of accumulation and has
increased the velocity and extent of economic growth throughout the last
two decades of the twentieth century. But it has also created the
premises of a war against human society that is underway in the new
century. The war against society is waged]{.underline} at two different
levels: at the economic level it is known as [privatization]{.underline}
and is [based on the idea that every fragment and every cell of the
biological, affective, linguistic spheres have to be turned into profit
machines. The effect of this priva­tization is the impoverishment of
daily life, the loss of sensibility in the fields of sex, communication,
and human relationships, as well as the increasing inequality between a
hyperrich minority and a dispossessed majority. At the social level,
this war is waged in terms of criminaliza-tion and destabilization of
territory and economic life]{.underline}. In large areas of the planet,
which are getting bigger, [production and exchange have become the
ground of violent confrontation between military groups and criminal
organizations. Slavery, blackmail, extortion, and murder are integral
parts of the economic lexicon.]{.underline} Scattered insurrections will
take place in the coming years, but we should not expect much from them.
They\'ll be unable to touch the real centers of power because of the
militarization of metropolitan space, and they will not be able to gain
much in terms of material wealth or political power. Just as the long
wave of counterglobalizadon\'s moralprotests could not destroy
neoliberal power, so the insurrections will not find a solution, not
unless a new consciousness and sensibility sur­faces and spreads,
changing everyday life and creating TVo\^-Temporary Autonomous Zones
rooted in the culture and consciousness of the global network. Full
employment is over. The world does not need so much labor and so much
exploitation. [A radical reduction of labor time is necessary. Basic
income has to be affirmed as a right to life, independent of em­ployment
and disjoined from the lending of labor time. Competence, knowledge, and
skills have to be separated from the economic context of exchange value
and rethought in terms of free social activity. We should not look at
the current recession only from an eco­nomic point of view. We must see
it essentially as an anthropological turning point that is going to
change the distribution of world resourc­es and world power. Europe is
doomed to lose its economic privilege, as five hundred years of
colonialism are ending. The debt that west­ern people have accumulated is
not only economic but also moral: the debt of oppression, violence, and
genocide has to be paid now, and it\'s not going to be
eas]{.underline}y. A large part of the European population is not
prepared to accept the redistribution of wealth that the recession will
impose. Europe, stormed by waves of migration, is going to face a
growing racist threat. [Ethnic war will be difficult to
avoid]{.underline}. In the US, the expectations raised by Obama\'s
victory have been largely disap­pointed. But at the same time a wave of
nonidentitarian, indigenous Renaissance is rising, especially in Latin
America. The privatization of basic needs (housing, transportation,
food) and social services is based on the cultural identification of
wealth and well-being with the amount of private property owned. In the
anthro­pology of modern capitalism, [well-being has been equated with
acqui­sition, never with enjoymen]{.underline}t. In the course of the
social turmoil we will live through in the coming years, [the
identification of well-being with property has to be questioned. Its a
political task, but above all it is a cultural task, and a
psychotherapeutic one too. When it comes to semiotic products, private
property becomes ir­relevant;]{.underline} in fact, [it\'s more and more
difficult to enforc]{.underline}e. The campaigns against piracy are
paradoxical because the real pirates are the corpora­tions that are
desperately trying to privatize the products of collective intelligence,
and artificially trying to impose a tax on the communityof producers.
The products of collective intelligence are immanently common because
[knowledge can neither be fragmented nor privately owned.]{.underline} A
new brand of communism was already springing from the technological
transformations of digital networks, when the collapse of the financial
markets and neoliberal ideology exposed the frailty of the foundations
of hypercapitalism[. Now we can predict a new wave of transformation
from the current collapse of growth, increasing debt, and questioning of
private consumption as well-being. Because of these three
forces---commonality of knowledge, ideological crisis of private
ownership, mandatory communalization of need---a new ho­rizon is visible
and a new landscape is going to surface.]{.underline} Communism is
coming back. [The old face of communism]{.underline}, based on the will
and voluntarism of an avant-garde, and the paranoid expectations of a
new totality, was de­feated at the end of the twentieth century [and will
not be resurrected. A totally new brand of communism is going to surface
as a form of necessity, the inevitable outcome of the stormy collapse of
the capitalist system. The communism of capital is a barbaric necessity.
We must put freedom in this necessity, we need to make this necessity a
conscious organized choice. Communism is back, but we should give it a
different name]{.underline}, be­cause historical memory identifies this
particular form of social organi­zation with the political tyranny of a
religion. The historical commu­nism of the twentieth century was based on
the idea of the primacy of totality over singularity. But the
[dialectical framework that defined the communist movement of the
twentieth century has been completely abandoned and nobody will
resurrect it.]{.underline} The Hegelian ascendance played a major role
in the formation of that kind of religious belief that was labeled
\"historicism.\" The *Aufhebung* (abolition of the Real to realize the
Idea) is the paranoid background of the whole concept of communism.
Within that dia­lectical framework, communism was viewed as an
all-encompassing totality expected to abolish and supersede the
all-encompassing capi­talist totality. The subject (the will and action
of the working class) was viewed as the instrument for the abolition of
the old and the inaugura­tion of the new. [The industrial working class,
being external to the production of concepts, could only identify with
the mythology of abolition and be attending to those people]{.underline}
and taking care of their insanity, [show­ing them the way of a happy
adaptation at hand. Our task will be the creation of social zones of
human resistance that act like zones of thera­peutic contagion. The
development of autonomy must not be seen]{.underline} as *Aufhehung,*
[but as therapy]{.underline}. In this sense[, it is not totalizing or
intended to destroy and abolish the past. Like psychoanalytic therapy it
should be considered an unending process.]{.underline}

[Is it yet possible to speak of Economics as a science when the
production process is becoming immaterial, unstable, and unpredictable,
and seems to elude the rules of computation that are at the core of the
economic conceptual system?]{.underline} Peter Drucker writes: Keynes,
the post-Keynesians, and the neo-classicists alike cast the economy in a
model in which a few constants drive the entire machinery. The model we
now need would have to see the economy as "ecology," "environment,"
"configuration," and as composed of several integrative spheres: a
"micro economy" of individuals and firms, especially translational ones;
a "macro economy" of national governments; and a world economy. Every
earlier economic theory postulated that one such economy totally
controls; all others are dependent and "functions." But economic reality
now is one of three such economies. None of them totally controls the
other two; none is totally controlled by the others. Yet none is fully
independent from the others, either. Such complexity can barely be
described. It cannot be analyzed since it allows of no prediction. To
give us a functioning economic theory, we thus need a new synthesis that
simplifies -- but so far there is no sign of it. And if no such
synthesis emerges, we might be at the end of economic theory. (Drucker
1989: 156-7) Economics became a science when, with the expansion of
capitalism, rules 64 were established as general principles for
productive activity and exchange. But if we want these rules to function
we must be able to quantify the basic productive act. The time-atom
described by Marx is the keystone of modern economics. **[Calculating
the time necessary for the production of a commodity makes possible the
regulation of the entire set of economic relations. But when the main
element in the global productive cycle is the unforeseeable work of the
mind, the unforeseeable work of language, when self-reproducing
information becomes the universal commodity, it is no longer possible to
reduce the totality of exchanges and relations to an economic
rule.]{.underline}** Drucker continues: In any system as complex as the
economy of a developed country, the statistically insignificant events,
the events at the margin, are likely to be the decisive events, short
range at least. By definition they can neither be anticipated nor
prevented. Indeed, they cannot always be identified even after they have
had their impact. (Drucker 1989: 166) Economic science is founded on a
quantitative and mechanistic paradigm that could comprehend and regulate
industrial production, the physical manipulation of mechanical matter,
but is unable to explain and regulate the process of immaterial
production based on an activity that can't easily be reduced to
quantitative measurements and the repetition of constants: mental
activity. Due to the new technologies, Jacques Robin (1989: 39) explains
how even the concept of productivity fails to resist the challenge
raised by the new realities like growth without job creation. With the
new technologies the majority of production costs are determined by
research and equipment expenses that actually precede the productive
process. [Little by little, in digitalized and automated enterprises,
production is no longer subjected to the variations concerning the
quantity of operational factors. Marginal cost, marginal profits: these
bases of neoclassical economic calculations have lost a good part of
their meaning]{.underline}. The traditional elements of salary and price
calculation are crumbling down. [Mental work is not computable in
precise and predictable terms like the work performed by an industrial
worker. Therefore, the determination of value -- the keystone of
classical economy both as a science and as daily economic practice --
becomes aleatory and indefinable.]{.underline} "Realist" economies (the
economies based on the relationship to a computable amount of labor
time) were governed by their goals: Finality is there in advance,
inscribed in the code. **[The order of goals has simply ceded its place
to a molecular play, as the order of signified has yielded to the play
of infinitesimal signifiers, reduced to their aleatory
commutation.]{.underline}** (Baudrillard 1993a: 59) In Baudrillard's
vision, [the economy therefore appears as a hyperreality, a simulated,
double, and artificial world that cannot be translated in terms of real
production]{.underline}. Consequently, economic science can no longer
explain the fundamental dynamics governing humanity's productive
activities; nor can it explain their crisis. [Economics has to be
replaced by a global science whose characteristics and field of inquiry
are still unknown: a science that would be able to study the processes
of formation of Cyberspace, i.e. the global network of
signs-commodities.]{.underline} In an interview published in 1993 by the
magazine *Wired*, Peter Drucker develops by his own point of view on the
theme of the inadequacy of economic categories associated with the
digitalization of production: International economic theory is obsolete.
The traditional factors of production -- land, labour, and capital --
are becoming restraints rather than driving forces. [Knowledge is
becoming the one critical factor of production. It has two incarnations:
knowledge applied to existing processes, services, and products is
productivity; knowledge applied to the new is innovation. \[...\]
Knowledge has become the central, key resource that knows no geography.
It]{.underline} underlies the most significant and unprecedented social
phenomenon of this century. No class in history has ever risen as fast
as the blue-collar worker and no class has fallen as fast. All within
less than a century. (Drucker, in Schwartz 1992: n.p.) Furthermore,
Drucker remarks that the concept of intellectual property, which is a
juridical concept at the basis of classical economy and the capitalist
system, no longer has any meaning in an age when [the circulating
commodity is information and the market is the info-sphere:]{.underline}
We have to rethink the whole concept of intellectual property, which was
focused on the printed word. Perhaps within a few decades, the
distinction between electronic transmissions and the printed word will
have disappeared. The only solution may be a universal licensing system.
Where you basically become a subscriber, and where it is taken for
granted that everything that is published is reproduced. In other words,

#### Language is malleable -- semiocapitalism relies on simulations and the process of sign-information // the tag is bad, card is good

**Bifo 12** \[Franco Berardi, Italian communist theorist and activist in
the autonomist tradition, whose work mainly focuses on the role of the
media and information technology within post-industrial capitalism,

Language and Poison "When I use a word, ... it means just what I choose
it to mean -- neither more nor less\... The question is, ... which
\[meaning\] is to be master -- that's all," says Lewis Carroll's (1971:
56) Humpty Dumpty, recognising straightaway, like a good master, that
when you ask words to do overtime, you have to pay them more. And
Deleuze (1990: 18), who refers to Humpty Dumpty in the third series of
The Logic of Sense, titled "Of the Proposition," comments: "the last
recourse seems to be identifying sense with signification." Not sense,
but the activity of producing meaning through the innumerable shifts and
slides that this process involves. In order to speak of the Italian
dérive of the last 15 years we must begin from a semiotic of
transgression and of sliding. **[The word "derive" scares those who
believe politics must respect a set of rules and that law must be at the
centre of social life, those who think that words have one meaning and
only that, and that to understand one another in life it is necessary to
use words according to their established meanings. This is all wrong.
When we speak we do not respect the meanings of words but invent
them.]{.underline}** Understanding is not the exchange of signs supplied
with a univocal referent. To understand is to follow the slides in the
relations between signs and referents, reinventing signs as functions of
new referents and creating new referents by circulating new signs.
[Similarly politics does not have to respect any one law because it
invents the law when it creates new relations.]{.underline} Following
rules is a good thing but politics cannot be reduced to this, because
there is no rule that says that rules must be respected. This Berlusconi
understood, and he won all that he could possibly win. The Left did not
understand it and finally vanished, to leave space, let's hope, for a
new social autonomy capable of inventing new words, new referents and
above all, new forms of relations. One night in October 1977 whilst the
fires of the student riots were dying out, Silvio Berlusconi met Mike
Buongiorno, a man who had featured on the screen since the beginning of
Italian television. They dined together in a Milan restaurant and out of
their simple minds an extraordinary linguistic machine was born, capable
of a mutagenetic bio-political penetration of the Italian brain. Since
then Berlusconi's capital has operated in a perfectly recombinatory
manner: having built its financial base on estates, it invested in
advertising, insurance, football and television. To put this enormous
conglomerate into motion, Berlusconi, who was a member of the secret
society P2 and friends with characters who reeked of the Mafia such as
Marcello Dell'Utri, violated many of the laws of the Italian Republic:
fiddling the books, corruption of judges, conflicts of interest. For 20
years he out81 manoeuvred magistrates, journalists and institutions that
accused him of breaking the law. **[But what is the law? A linguistic
effect that dissolves as common sense changes.]{.underline}** And in
three decades common sense has changed because Berlusconi's mediatic
machine has inoculated linguistic substances in perfect doses to produce
white noise. Far from being a backward phenomena or a transitory
anomaly, since the 1980s and '90s the Berlusconi phenomenon is a sign
for a time to come, well actually, a time that has now arrrived. In this
time an infrastructure of the engineering of the psycho-sphere was
constituted that was capable of modulating the public mood and producing
opinion, but above all, capable of destroying psychic sensibility and
the empathetic sociability of the new generations, who are induced to
mistake the uninterrupted flow of television for "the world[".
Contemporary capitalism can be defined as semiocapitalism because the
general shape of commodities has a semiotic character and the process of
production is increasingly the elaboration of
sign-information.]{.underline} In the sphere of semiocapital, economic
production is increasingly tightly interwoven with processes of
linguistic exchange, as is explained clearly in the books of Christian
Marazzi and Paulo Virno. Thanks [to language we can create shared
worlds, formulate ambiguous enunciations, elaborate metaphors, simulate
events or simply lie. Semioeconomics is the creation of worlds, castles
of metaphors, imagination, predictions, simulations and
fabrications]{.underline}. What better country than the one that gave us
commedia dell' arte could insert itself in a productive system based on
chatter, spectacle and exhibition? **[The Fordist industrial economy was
founded on the production of objectively measurable value quantifiable
by socially necessary labor time. The postindustrial economy is based on
linguistic exchange, on the value of simulation]{.underline}**. **[This
simulation becomes the decisive element in the determination of value.
And when simulation becomes central to the productive process, lies,
deceit, and fraud enter to play a part in economic life not as
exceptional transgressions of the norm but as laws of production and
exchange. The laws in force in the sphere of semiocapital do not
resemble those of the glorious epoch of industry; the relations do not
resemble those of productive discipline, the ethics of work or
enterprise that dominated the world of classical industrial capitalism,
the Protestant capitalism that Michel Albert dubs "of the Rhine". A deep
transformation has taken place in the last few decades, starting from
the separation of the financial circuit from the real
economy.]{.underline}** The founding act of this process of separation
was Nixon's arbitrary decision to abandon the system established by
Bretton Woods. In 1971, the American President decided to rescind the
rules on the convertibility of the dollar into gold and to thus affirm
the self-referentiality of the American standard. 82 Despite the
implications of Vietnam, at this time American power still had
credibility and the strength to impose its decisions as if they were
objective and incontrovertible. Today that power and credibility have
dissolved, the value of the dollar has fallen, and **[the economy of
simulation has thus entered into a phase of instability]{.underline}**.
[From the moment when Nixon told the world of the decision to unhook the
dollar from every gauge of objectivity, money fully became what it
already was in essence: a pure act of language. No longer a referential
sign that relates to a mass of commodities, a quantity of gold, or to
some other objective data, money now relates to a factor of simulation,
an agent capable of putting into motion arbitrary processes independent
of the real economy.]{.underline} Therefore [semiocapital is a system of
complete indeterminacy: financialization and immaterialization have
brought to the relations between social actors unpredictability and
chance elements never seen before in the history of the industrial
economy]{.underline}. In Fordist industrial production, the
determination of the value of a commodity was founded on a certain
factor: the socially necessary labor time to produce it. But in
semiocapitalism this is no longer true. When [the main feature of
commodity production is cognitive labor, the labor of attention, memory,
language and imagination, the criteria of value is no longer objective
and cannot be quantified on the basis of a fixed referent.]{.underline}
Labor time has ceased to count as the absolute touchstone. Under
aleatory conditions, arbitrariness becomes the law: lies, violence, and
corruption are no longer marginal offshoots of economic life, but tend
to become the alpha and omega of the daily management of affairs. Bands
of criminals decisively take over the place of command. Economic power
belongs to those who possess more powerful language machines. The
government of the mediascape, predomination in the production of
software, and control over financial information: these are the
foundations of economic power. And the domination of these sources of
power cannot be established by means of the dear old competition where
the best possible management of available resources wins, but rather
through lies, deceit, and war. **[There is no longer any economic power
that is not criminal, that does not violate fundamental human rights:
first and foremost the right to education, selfknowledge, and the right
to a non-polluted info-sphere.]{.underline}**

[As Copeland makes clear, his four [artists make their]{.mark} own
[departures from the *Beloved* project]{.mark}, most crucially [by way
of]{.mark}]{.underline} their work\'s facture (i.e., workmanship, the
execution of its surfaces) and what Copeland calls [a style of
"**[antiportraiture]{.mark}**," the response of black artists who have
long been objectified on account of their race "**[refus\[ing\] the
gaze]{.mark}**]{.underline}" (9), [**[denying access to their
interiority]{.mark}**, [and]{.mark} generally [claiming "an
**opacity**]{.mark} and **inscrutability**]{.underline}" (205) [long
denied them [by choosing to]{.mark} **conceal or [obscure]{.mark} the
surfaces of [their art]{.mark}**]{.underline} (Lorna Simpson\'s
turned-away self-portraits arguably exemplify this style).19 What is
more, [[the *Beloved* moment was so]{.mark} thoroughly [structured by
the **paradigm of the revenant**]{.mark}]{.underline} [([the imperative
to "**summon the presences**" or "**recollect the absences**" of
slaves]{.mark}), so committed to [a **logic of
appearance**]{.mark}]{.underline}, like the Harlem Renaissance and Black
Arts movements before it, [and committed too to "a **[replaying of the
trauma of slavery]{.mark}** \[with the implication\] that repressed
horrors have somehow been **recovered** or **bubbled up from a temporal
interregnum**]{.underline}" (9), [[that to say]{.mark} that [these
artists produced anti-portraits **hostile to** ]{.mark}**a logic of
[appearance]{.mark}** [is]{.mark} essentially [to say]{.mark} that
[their work was **not a part of its historical
moment**]{.mark}]{.underline}. I see no problem in saying that, and in
fact wish that Copeland had, but I also understand that doing so one
risks descending to a level of absurdity (*how can art not be a part of
the historical moment in which it was made?*).20 {20 [The
critics]{.underline} Hubert [Damisch]{.underline}, Georges
[Didi-Huberman, and]{.underline} Ernst [van Alphen have challenged the
core axiom of the discipline of art history---"that the meaning of art
can **only be formulated historically**]{.underline} ... [\[that an\]
artwork, therefore is always an expression of the historical period or
figure that produced it]{.underline}"---and [I mean to court the same
skepticism]{.underline} in what I have to say here. Damish maintains
that [it is **impossible to possess the "period eye"**]{.underline} (a
term attributed to Michael Baxandall) [of another time in
history]{.underline}. See Yve-Alain Bois, Denis Hollier, Rosalind
Krauss, and Hubert Damisch, "A Conversation with Hubert Damisch,"
October 85 (Summer 1998): 9. [Damisch and van Alphen, drawing largely on
theories of the artwork\'s autonomy indebted to Theodor Adorno, argue
for a view of the artwork as "an **act of thought**," that "works of art
appear to full advantage only if we deal with them as ways of
thinking]{.underline}." See Ernst van Alphen, Art in Mind: How
Contemporary Images Shape Thought (Chicago: University of Chicago Press,
2005), 2. See also Georges Didi-Huberman, Confronting Images:
Questioning the Ends of a Certain History of Art (University Park: Penn
State University Press, 2009).} [Such a claim requires that we take a
moment to think through the conditions under which [this flurry of
artistic activity]{.mark}, [this shared interest in slavery]{.mark} and
its representation, might be said not to have congealed into an "event"
historically understood]{.underline}. [The vocabulary of presence and
absence, the logic of appearance, the idea that black art in 1980s New
York signaled a turning point in the structure of racial
representation]{.underline}---these are the principles and conceptual
postures that have been fundamental to the exploration of blackness in
the aesthetic realm, but they [[all build on the assumption that there
is]{.mark} (or was) [something ***missing from* the visual
field**]{.mark}, [something]{.mark} that contemporary art at a
particular moment in time found itself in a unique position [to
**recover** and **represent**.]{.mark}]{.underline}

I would argue that [[there is a longer genealogy of]{.mark} sustained
and practiced [**antipathy to appearance** in the black
tradition]{.mark}]{.underline}, and that the artists discussed in *Bound
to Appear* are part of it---[a kind of "antiportraiture,"]{.underline}
if you will, [in the sense of [a]{.mark} long-standing [commitment to
**representation-against-appearance**]{.mark}, but a tradition of
profound philosophical and ethical significance. [I thus propose]{.mark}
here the sketch of a genealogy of ***[black
ascesis]{.mark}***,]{.underline} borrowing the latter term from Michel
Foucault, who characterized it as "[the work that one performs on
oneself in order to transform oneself or make the self appear which,
**happily, *one never attains***]{.underline}"---[significance falling
on that **[anticipation of failure]{.mark}**, on [an **appearance that
one never attains**]{.mark}]{.underline}.21 Copeland in many respects
engages that tradition, but my contention would be that to recognize
that [this tradition **was not predicated on a sense of lack**,
specifically on a sense of something being missing from the visual
field]{.underline}, ought to have consequences for our method, in
something of [a reversal of the Heisenbergian principle that viewing the
object changes the object]{.underline}. I would argue, on the contrary,
that [[viewing the object **changes the *method***, and]{.mark} [these
consequences manifest on the scholarly practices]{.mark} that [we use to
"discipline" art]{.mark}: either [the attempt to]{.mark} explicate the
artwork\'s meaning consists in restating what it *represents*, to
explain it historically through recourse to its moment of production, or
to [**restore its fragments** to the *context* from which they were
taken]{.mark}. I will make the case for black ascesis in contemporary
art practice by turning to]{.underline} an artist at a remove from the
time and place of artistic activity attended to in *Bound to
Appear*---[Mark Bradford---in whose canvases I espy an invitation
to]{.underline} what I like to think of as [a philosophical project of
**self-divestiture**, a project that often involves the **failure to
make an appearance**]{.underline}. But what does Copeland mean by that
word *appear*?

Bound to Appear

Copeland takes his title from Cedric Robinson\'s critical tour de force,
*Black Marxism: The Making of the Black Radical Tradition*, and
specifically a synoptic passage in which Robinson explains the ways the
effects of racism and nationalism ("racialism," in his language) will
expand throughout the modern capitalist world:

> As an enduring principle of European social order, the effects of
> racialism were bound to appear in the social expression of every
> strata of every European society no matter the structures upon which
> they were formed. None was immune ... . It was ... a quite natural
> occurrence ... . But to the ... radical intelligentsias\[,\] it was
> also an unacceptable one, one subsequently denied. Nevertheless, it
> insinuated itself into their thought and their theories. And thus, in
> the quest for a radical social force, an active historical subject, it
> compelled certain blindnesses, bemusements.22

Robinson\'s carefully chosen words lend an air of the inevitable both to
racialism\'s appearance ("every strata," "no matter the structures,"
"none was immune," "natural occurrence," "compelled") and to the Western
scholarly and political ignorance ("blindnesses," "bemusements") of an
ongoing philosophically coherent and ideologically committed movement
among blacks---what he terms the *black radical tradition*.23 And [while
Western society, on account of this enduring racialism, provided a
"social cauldron" of black radicalism]{.underline} ("its location and
its objective condition"), [it would prove to be neither its "specific
inspiration" nor "the foundation for its nature or
character]{.underline}."24 In short, [racialism is never the cause of
which the black radical tradition is the effect]{.underline}. On this
premise, Robinson makes the case that **[[slavery did not define the
black condition]{.underline}]{.mark}**.25

[Copeland, in twisting the phrase "bound to appear" into his titular
figure, gives it the **agility of a two-way verbal pun**]{.underline}
(that again!): "The black body is bound to appear due to its vital place
in the American cultural imaginary" (205). Bound in the sense of
inevitable, once again, but bound as well in the sense that the body
that commands such privileged psychic space does so because of slavery.
Copeland\'s turn of phrase, by serving the projects of both visual
studies and the study of slavery, grounds his book\'s claims for
appearance. [But given]{.underline} the causal disjunct that Robinson
posits between Western radicalism and the black radical tradition (that
is, the claim [that black radicalism "cannot be understood" in terms of
the context of its genesis; that it "is not a variant" of Western
radicalism]{.underline}),26 [one might question whether or not, and if
so how, slavery could "appear" in contemporary art]{.underline}, in a
way that makes sense for visual art, while staying true to the terms of
Robinson\'s argument. I think it makes sense for us to push harder on
that verb---*to appear*---and to ask whether Robinson expected the black
radical tradition, with which Copeland aligns his four artists, would
ever make an appearance of the visual sort (12).

I do not feel it would be overstating the matter to say that *Black
Marxism* is a curious source from which to draw one\'s title if the goal
is to foreground the specifically visual resonances of the phrase "bound
to appear." [Evidence of [the black radical tradition seems]{.mark} to
have been [**recondite**, **more felt than seen**]{.mark}, its presence
**more intuited than witnessed**, its actualization **more paradoxically
present than empirically given**]{.underline}. As Robinson, who invented
the phrase, would go on to describe it, [in [the black radical
tradition]{.mark} revolutionary activity was [focused on]{.mark} "the
**[structures of the mind]{.mark}**," where defeat or victory were
largely **"internal affair\[s\]"**]{.underline}---[[it]{.mark} was a
tradition that "**[more easily sustained suicide than
assault]{.mark}**]{.underline}."27

[Some origins to the tradition]{.underline}: (1) [The followers of
Nongqawuse, the Xhosa prophetess who claimed]{.underline} in 1856 that
[the ancestral spirits told her that the Xhosa should **slaughter all
their cattle** and **destroy their crops**]{.underline} (the repository
of all their wealth), [in return for which the spirits would **banish
their British occupiers** into the sea]{.underline}---[a millennialist
prophesy that would result in a cattle-killing of such **apocalyptic
proportions** that three-quarters of the Xhosa nation would die of the
resulting famine]{.underline}.28 (2) [The [enslaved Africans]{.mark},
mulattoes, and poor whites who]{.underline} throughout much of the
seventeenth century [[escaped to the Palmares]{.underline}]{.mark}, a
region of steep and precipitous mountains on the coast of Brazil, [where
they established settlements, a republic consisting of smaller
palmares]{.underline} (or *quilombos*), [and a king with the power to
negotiate treaties with the colonial governor of the state of
Pernambuco]{.underline}---[but [a **society of fugitives** who would
**abandon and burn their settlements to the ground** each time
Portuguese armies approached, **melting away** into the surrounding
forest, their state **reclaimed by wilderness**, their society **leaving
no trace**]{.mark}]{.underline}.29 (3) [[The rebels who]{.mark} in 1915
[struck valiantly, though futilely, against]{.mark} British [colonial
rule in Nyasaland, upon hearing]{.mark} the following entreaty from
their leader, [John Chilembwe]{.mark}]{.underline}, a millenarian
Christian minister: "[[We]{.mark} have determined to [strike **a first
and**]{.mark} **a [last blow]{.mark}** [and then we will]{.mark} all
[die by the heavy storm of the whiteman\'s army]{.mark}]{.underline}."30

[[These are the roots from]{.mark} which [the black radical
tradition]{.mark} emerges, [and **none can be understood** in]{.mark}
the terms of class conflict or individual resistance most common to
**[Western rationality]{.mark}**]{.underline} ("the individualistic and
often spontaneous motives that energized the runaway, the arsonist, the
poisoner"), [not to mention in terms of a desire to bring about positive
social change]{.underline}. [These origins provide evidence, on the
contrary, of a "very different and shared order of things," of [a
tradition founded on a]{.mark} "**very [different role for
consciousness]{.mark}** [than]{.mark} was anticipated in [Western
radicalism]{.mark}]{.underline}."31

[[With **violence "turned inward"** rather than directed at their
oppressors, these rebels "**lived on their terms**]{.mark}, they **[died
on their terms]{.mark}**, they **[obtained]{.mark} their [freedom on
their terms]{.mark}** ... \[[and]{.mark} they\] **[defined the terms of
their destruction]{.mark}**]{.underline}." [What lends this tradition
its "radical" accent is as much the inwardness of the violence as the
violence itself, the tradition\'s [**actualization through
self-abnegation** rather than against it]{.mark}]{.underline}. But, as a
politics, if politics is what we want to call it, [[such communities
**sought not to achieve**]{.mark} **a [positive]{.mark} set of social
[outcomes]{.mark}** (e.g., the attenuation of the objective power of the
enemy, [the **overthrow of slavery**]{.mark}, [the **actualization a new
world**]{.mark}) [but instead]{.mark} to prioritize "[the **renunciation
of actual being for historical being**]{.mark}," the community\'s
successful **[mobilization "against its material
aspect]{.mark}**]{.underline}."32 **[[Victory and freedom make their
appearance in disappearance]{.underline}]{.mark}**. [[The people stake
their claim **on and as community** in the moment of its
**dissolution**]{.underline}]{.mark}---[an ethics]{.underline} (a far
more accurate term, in my view) [committed to "the integral **totality
of the people" against their material aspect**]{.underline}. In
Robinson\'s summation, [this ethics involved a "shared sense of
obligation [to **preserve the collective being**, the **ontological
totality**]{.mark}]{.underline}."33

[What kind of tradition is this?]{.underline}34 {34 David Scott feels
degrees more discerning when he asks of the critical commonplace "[the
black radical tradition": What makes us think that we can string these
words together?]{.underline} See his "On the Very Idea of a Black
Radical Tradition," Small Axe, no. 46 (March 2013): 1--6.} [[By
what]{.mark} logic [does one "preserve"]{.mark} the [collective being
in]{.mark} acts of **[self-destruction]{.mark}**,
**[self-renunciation]{.mark}**, **inwardness**, [and **collective
disappearance**]{.mark}?]{.underline} What is that? ([Robin D. G.
[Kelley sees the change inspired by]{.mark} the black radical
imagination as having roots in **[the surreal]{.mark}**]{.underline}.)35
{35 [A surrealism avant la lettre in Afro-diasporic culture recognized
"the **[imagination as our most powerful weapon]{.mark}**"]{.underline};
and the Europeans who would claim the name realized that ["entire
cultures had methods of thought and communication that **transcended the
conscious**]{.underline}." Robin D. G. Kelley, Freedom Dreams: The Black
Radical Imagination (Boston: Beacon, 2002), 159--60.} [Some
[observers]{.mark}]{.underline}, knowing the level of violence the
situation warranted, and knowing too who ought to have been its proper
recipient, [[dismissed]{.mark} those who chose [this]{.mark} plan of
action [as]{.mark} an "**[outlandish]{.mark} people**"; [and]{.mark}
though [this description]{.mark} was intended to disparage and dismiss,
it **[seems in fact to be the most accurate]{.mark}**]{.underline}.36
[[Black radicalism is]{.mark} quite [literally the consciousness of
those who **remembered another land**]{.mark}, those with distinct
imaginings of [an **elsewhere**]{.mark}, or those with a **superior
moral claim on "home."**]{.underline}37 Returning to the paradox of the
black radical tradition with that distinction in mind, the logic of
[**appearance-in-disappearance** starts to make a great deal more
sense]{.underline}. To assert that [self-destruction "preserve\[s\] the
collective being," "the integral totality of the people]{.underline},"
is to understand that ***[[self-annihilation presents a primary figure
for diaspora]{.underline}]{.mark}***. (Ask again the question What is
that? and the answer is *diaspora*.) [It would be falling short of the
mark to designate this collective being "missing," for though clearly
absent, the only evidence of its actualization is its
**self-destruction**]{.underline}.

So what could it mean to say, then, as Copeland does, that "it is within
this lineage that the four practitioners examined in this book belong"
(12)? What does it mean to say that Glenn Ligon, Lorna Simpson, Fred
Wilson, and Renée Green, each committed in his or her unique ways to the
visualization of slavery\'s effects, to "the visual structures, logics,
and modes of speaking arising from it that continue to inform the
present," that they share a tradition with African millennialists and
Palmares fugitives? And what could it mean to say that [these artists
"made clear that the black body is bound to appear due to its vital
place in the American cultural imaginary]{.underline}" (205), [that they
restored something that was missing from the visual field, when under
Robinson\'s dispensation [the black radical tradition signifies not
something missing]{.mark} from our understanding [but something that
"**cannot be understood**]{.mark} within the particular context of its
genesis]{.underline}"?38 I think Copeland is right about the connection
but not always for the right reasons.

### 2NC---Opacity 

#### Our thesis is that semiocapitalism has altered the [terrain of labor]{.underline} from the [material]{.underline} work and exploitation of bodies to a [cognitive labor]{.underline} that extracts value from [production of knowledge]{.underline}. 

#### Archiving good isn't responsive -- they can win that wake work and archiving are good, but the alternative [is a form of wake work and archiving that does not perform the 1AC's invocation of spectacular trauma and overcoming]{.underline}. The alternative affirms the radical black tradition and [opacity of the archive]{.underline} which gestures towards resistance and black kinship [outside]{.underline} of debate and capital's gaze. 

### 2NC Framework

#### The role of the judge is to analyze competing methods of archiving 

#### The role of the negative is [not]{.underline} to win that the aff's archiving is worse than the status quo, but instead that the aff is, [by comparison]{.underline}, worse than the alt. If we win that our [competing method]{.underline} of [opaque archiving]{.underline} which [isn't centered on public performance of trauma]{.underline} -- i.e. an alternative method that disagrees with [core thesis claims]{.underline} of the 1AC -- is better than the 1AC, we should win. 

#### This solves their offense -- they get to extensively weigh the 1ac, and this isn't a word PIC -- it's an impact turn that disagrees with foundational claims in the 1AC. Offense/defense in debates about anti-blackness is unethical -- we shouldn't have to win the aff made the world worse, just that there is a better method than the 1ac

#### Framing question -- if they win their Ks of framework, [defer neg]{.underline} -- the PIC is an example of the types of idea testing they say is our neg ground. Allowing [2ac shifts]{.underline} via the perm creates the [worst]{.underline} forms of idea testing, because we can [never]{.underline} develop meaningful clash centered around the 1ac without extending T as a check. 

### 2NC Impact Framing 

#### Three two impact framing questions -- 

#### 1. Root cause -- this process of [intellectual laboring]{.underline} is governed by [Multi-Racial White Supremacist visualization]{.underline}, a semiotic imaginary that determines and facilitates the [smooth exchange of signs]{.underline} within the symbolic economy of debate. James contrasts it with the Fanonian schema the aff assumes -- that the Black is a *production* of the white psyche and thus is [pure object]{.underline} -- James indicates that it's [no longer true]{.underline}, and the [opposite]{.underline} -- the deregulation of social exclusion now encourages [analysis]{.underline} and [performance]{.underline} of oppression to sustain [visual economies of violence]{.underline}. The affirmative's production of alternative realities capitulates to that visualization by [directing affective energies into altering its manifestations while leaving intact its underlying coherence]{.underline}. 

#### 2. Turns case -- if they win the various critiques on framework, it only proves that power is as productive as it is repressive, and their endless attempt to [instantiate utopian possibilities for debate's inclusion]{.underline} of the 1ac's scholarship reveals their attachment to a [passion for abolition]{.underline} that, through its [impossible attempt to overturn systems of power can only result in the internalization of ressentiment]{.underline}, or hatred of the self, which [turns and outweighs]{.underline} the affirmative by making [planetary extinction inevitable]{.underline}. 

### 2NC AT: Perm---Top 

#### The question is not whether we have some agreement about archiving or about theories of power -- the question is about the [method]{.underline} by which the 1ac performs redress. We have won several links to direct quotes and pieces of evidence which the permutation either can't resolve or severs, which is a voting issue both to preserve competition and dialogue and to drive effective scholarly inquiry 

#### Affirm the [secretive]{.underline} nature of the archive- it's key to avoid cooption and make liberation possible

[The phenomenon of [secrets in the archive that can never be
revealed]{.mark}]{.underline}, then, [[points to a multifarious
multiplication of the unknowable]{.underline}]{.mark}. The court often
made these multiplications, but they were also made against the power of
the judiciary. [[White ignorance about black political strivings
was]{.underline}]{.mark} thus [[not]{.mark} [just born of the
manipulations of interrogations]{.mark} through tortures, redactions, or
dismissals of testimonies. [It was just as surely achieved through the
conscious attempts on the part of black and nonwhite subjects to
avoid]{.mark} [what Derrida refers to as the "violence of the archive,"
the drive or perceived necessity to archive the past as a way of keeping
at bay the always present, heterogeneous, and unpredictable threat of
irretrievable loss.]{.mark}]{.underline}48 [The horizon of what
philosopher Charles Mills has labeled "white ignorance" is thus not
necessarily reducible to deliberate inversions of knowledge into not
knowing; though deliberate or not, the result is still a scene of
disavowal]{.underline}.49 The issue seems to turn on who disavows what,
and what those disavowals tell us about the limits or excesses of power.
[[When João de Deus refused to answer questions]{.mark}, for example,
[and]{.mark} effectively [bought time for the gunman Luís Pires to
escape, he disavowed the notion that his arrest]{.mark} necessarily [had
to mean the end of the movement]{.mark}. The effect of this process,
then, was that [judges]{.mark} remained ignorant of the whereabouts of
one of the principal organizers of the movement, so they [could never
capture or know the full extent of the conspiracy and its
supporters.]{.mark}]{.underline} On the other hand, when judges assigned
a death sentence to Luís Pires in absentia and condemned all of his
progeny and lineage to eternal infamy, they disavowed that his physical
absence could hamper their performance.50 With one eye on promotions and
another eye on punishing subordinates of African descent, colonial
magistrates were both willing to record their frustrations with the
secrets kept by rebels and happy to advance their careers on the basis
of these same secrets. Thus, a contradiction appears to emerge in this
moment: the secrets of a movement led by men of African descent are
never recovered or fully disclosed but are nevertheless punished
publicly. However, the secret methods and interrogations that the
magistrates used to conclude that Luís Pires and others were guilty were
also never fully disclosed to the public. Thus, the secrets of
conspirators and judges ultimately return us to the issue of the public
and to how control over public opinion by both elites and subalterns
depended on secrecy. [[There is much at stake in pushing beyond the
fascination with trying to uncover the contents of the innumerable
secrets that live in archives of colonial slavery and resistance.
Perhaps, instead of reading every silence or silenced black rebel for
clues or details regarding his true intentions and purposes, we should
rather focus on how those secrets aided future subaltern political
formations]{.underline}]{.mark} or future governing practices in the
case of judges and officials. [[Disassociating secrecy from recovery may
thus be a way toward opening up further space for research on black
publics and politics under colonialism that understands the
multiplication and maintenance of secrecy as an integral component of
protecting and furthering the project of writing histories of black
intellectual production and critical thought.]{.underline}]{.mark}

### L---Black Suffering 

#### The 1AC narrative of black tragedy and suffering is used by the racial capitalist system as a marker of white supremacy that fuels the state's biopolitical project of surveilling and devaluing certain populations

**Stuelke 17** (Patricia Stuelke, Assistant Prof at Dartmouth, writing
and specializing in US imperialism, racial capitalism, gender and
sexuality, and US and Latin American social movements. "Trayvon Martin,
Topdog/ Underdog, and the Tragedy Trap", VR)

At the 2016 Grammy Awards, to the bluesy whine of the saxophone,
Kendrick Lamar shuffled onstage, handcuffed, feet shackled to the
dancers behind him. The saxophone hushed as he listed to the side,
wrapping his chains around the microphone, their clinking loud in the
uneasy silence before the percussive crash of the first lyric of
"Blacker the Berry" (2015): "I'm the biggest hypocrite of 2015."
[Lamar's visual invocation of the history of black bondage and mass
incarceration juxtaposed with his proclamation of personal hypocrisy
evoked the public debate over the song's politics: to the ire of many
listeners and fellow rappers, the song's declaration of black self-love
in the face of lethal racism is undercut by its critique of
black-on-black violence]{.underline}. "So why did I weep when Trayvon
Martin was in the street? / When gang banging make me kill a nigga
blacker than me? / Hypocrite!" the song ends. 1 [In his Grammy
performance, however, Lamar eliminated these controversial
lyric]{.underline}s, including instead a variation of "Alright" (2015),
the song that has become the unofficial anthem of Black Lives Matter
protestors around the country. "On February 26th I lost my life too," he
rapped toward the close, lit in the dark by a single spotlight, "That
was me yelling for help while he drowned in his blood / Why didn't he
defend himself? / Why didn't he throw a punch?" 2 Lamar's [oscillating
lyrical revisions of possible relations to Martin's death---from
self-condemnation to total identification with Martin's dying body to
helpless victim-blaming---might key us to what Lauren Berlant has marked
as the waning of genre in neoliberalism, the idea that "life can no
longer be lived even phantasmatically as melodrama, as Aristotelian
tragedy spread to ordinary people, as a predictable arc that is shaped
by acts, facts, or fates"]{.underline} ("Thinking" 7). Lamar's lyrical
shifts speak to the [difficulty of finding a narrative form or position
to account for, and to call into account, contemporary acts of antiblack
racis]{.underline}m. Nevertheless, the narratives of black-on-black
violence conjured by the original lyrics of "Blacker the Berry," as well
as the [poses of heroic identification and tragic
victimhood]{.underline} stirred by Lamar's Grammy revisions, [mark the
pernicious persistence of genre's power in neoliberalism's ongoing
biopolitical project of surveilling, ordering, devaluing, and valuing
populations]{.underline}. Scientists and economists have deployed genres
like tragedy and parable, as Rob Nixon has suggested, to justify the
privatization and dispossession of the commons. Meanwhile, [white
heterosexual male lives and white American or European lives, as opposed
to Arab or Indigenous or black lives, continue to be imagined as
valuable, their deaths cast as "tragic" and grievable]{.underline}.3 If
genre is waning as a form for explaining ordinary affects, it endures as
a [cudgel of state and economic violence]{.underline}. This essay
follows these scholars in examining the [use of the genre of tragedy in
neoliberal times,]{.underline} taking it up in particular as it has been
deployed to secure what Khalil Gibran Muhammad calls the "[ideological
currency of black criminality]{.underline}" (3). While similarly
informed by Raymond Williams's sense of the importance of considering
the relation between literary and vernacular nomenclatures of tragedy,
this approach runs somewhat askew of recent accounts of the relationship
between tragedy and the black radical tradition.4 Rather than adopt a
critical perspective oriented around tragedy, or explore the tragic
orientation of black radicalism and anticolonial movements, I examine
how [tragedy in the post-Civil Rights era is a toxic racial narrative
with which racial justice movements and black expressive culture must
contend]{.underline}. As Sandy Alexandre has explained, we might do well
to imagine bad racial narratives as stories that harden through use,
accumulating until they crush people with their terrible weight. But
[violent racial narratives' tangibility is also]{.underline}, Alexandre
reminds, "[evidence of their eventual demise]{.underline}," the
potential for them "to be [transformed into an object that can
eventually explode]{.underline}" ("Black Lives"). Accordingly, I trace
the circulation of racial narratives of tragedy in the aftermath of
Trayvon Martin's murder to theorize the [haptic bind of what I call the
American antiblack tragedy trap: a double bind that locks black subjects
into the infinitely recursive roles of universal tragic martyrs or
pathological tragic victims]{.underline}. After illuminating the
contours of the tragedy trap in relation to the aftermath of Martin's
murder, the essay analyzes the trap aesthetics of SuzanLori Parks's play
Topdog/Underdog (2001), considering how it mounts an insurgency against
this double bind. This phrase "trap aesthetics" comes from Justin
Burton's theory of trap music, which he argues "sonifies the
hyperproductivity of the drug game in the music studio for the club" and
"moves through society in ways it shouldn't" ("Safe Sex"). "The [image
of the trap," he explains, "is a house with only one way in and out, yet
trap aesthetics produce a music that seems to constantly find a secret
exit, a path not offered, a way around established norm]{.underline}s"
("Trap Irony"). Assessing the play's attempt to move through the tragedy
trap to rupture its machinery is to recognize how contemporary black
culture navigates the tragedy trap as a discursive bind that indexes
other carceral geographies, metaphysical, metaphorical, and
biopolitical: the drug house and even, per Christina Sharpe, the hold of
the slave ship. At the close, I return to Lamar's performance and to the
play to account for the gender politics of these strategies of
fugitivity. Claudia Rankine has written that the Black Lives Matter
movement represents "an attempt to keep mourning an open dynamic in our
culture" (150), to [call attention to the endurance and vulnerability of
black lives and "the undeniability of their devaluation" by racial
capitalism]{.underline} and the US state (155). Accompanying the
movement's endeavor to keep open this dynamic is an ongoing project of
rewriting, reimagining, and [foreclosing the generic categories through
which racial capitalism orders black death and black life]{.underline}.
This work is taking place at many sites, from the performances of Black
Women Artists for Black Lives Matter to Angie Thomas's bestselling novel
The Hate U Give (2017). This essay's exploration of the contemporary
workings of the tragedy trap, and black theatrical and musical
skirmishes with it, is meant as a gesture of solidarity with such acts
of sabotage and invention.

### L---Trauma

#### The aff's reach into the archive repeats the very violence against blackness they uncover. Refuse this enumerated repetition of death as it permanently affixes blackness into a state of pain and suffering.

**McKittrick**, Associate Professor of Gender Studies at Queen's
University, **'14** \[Katherine, "Mathematics Black Life", The Black
Scholar, 44:2, 2014,RSR\]

**[[In]{.mark} Saidya [Hartman\'s \"Venus in Two
Acts]{.mark}]{.underline}**,\" [[she returns to the deaths of
two]{.mark} young [African girls]{.mark} who were both violently and
brutally [killed on the middle passage]{.mark}]{.underline}. Raped,
strung up, whipped to death, dying alone: This is the information
Hartman pieces together from the ship\'s ledger and financial accounts,
the captain\'s log book, and the court case that dismissed the charges
of murder against Captain John Timber, the 16 man who caused the deaths
of the girls. [[The archive]{.mark} of black diaspora is, [as
Hartman]{.mark} rightly [suggests]{.mark}, \"[a **death
sentence**]{.mark}, a **tomb**, a display of a violated body, an
inventory of property, a medical treatise \... an asterisk in the grand
narrative of history.]{.underline}\" 1 The asterisked archives are
filled with bodies that can only come into being vis-a-vis racialsexual
violence; the documents and ledgers and logs that narrate the
brutalities of this history give birth to new world blackness as they
evacuate life from blackness. [Breathless, [archival]{.mark} numerical
[evidence puts pressure on our]{.mark} present [system]{.mark} of
knowledge [by **affirming the knowable**]{.mark} ([black
objecthood]{.mark}) [and **disguising the untold** (black human
being).]{.mark}]{.underline} The slave\'s status as object-commodity, or
purely economic cargo, reveals that [[a black archival presence]{.mark}
not only enumerates the dead and dying, but also **[acts as an origin
story]{.mark}**.]{.underline} [This is where we begin, this is where
historic blackness comes from: the list, the breathless numbers, the
absolutely economic, the mathematics of the unliving]{.underline}.
Recall then, aboard the ship Peggy, aboard the ship Prosperous Amelia,
aboard the brig Nancy. The ledgers read: Samuel Minton, 60 years, nearly
worn out \... Formerly slave to Thomas Minton, Norfolk, Virginia \...
Gilbert Lafferts, 21 years, likely lad, Mr. James Henderson\'s
possession, proved to be the property of Mr. James Henderson \... Master
& Bill of Sale produced \... Anny Bolton, 42, stout wench, Uames
Alexander). Formerly the property of Thomas Bolton, Nansemond, Virginia
\... Jenny Frederick, 32 years, ordinary wench \... Certified to be free
by Jonah Frederick of Boston, New England \... Betty Rapelje, 21, stout
wench, (Peter Brown) \... Says she was born free at Newtown, Long
lsland.2 Worn out, bill of sale produced, certified to be free, ordinary
wench, proved to be the property of, formerly slave to, formerly the
property of, all with parenthetic possessors. [New world blackness
arrives through the ordinary, proved, former, certified, nearly worn-out
archives of ledgers, accounts, price tags, and descriptors of economic
worth and financial probability. The list of slaves upon these ships is
a list of propertied commode ties. The slave is possession, proved to be
property]{.underline}. Yet a voice interrupts: says she. [[It follows
that black freedom]{.mark} is embedded within an economy of race and
violence and [unfolds as an **indeterminate impossibility**]{.mark}:
wench, property of, likely lad, nearly worn out; certified to be free,
says she was born free, formerly slave to. Says she was born
free]{.underline}. The brutalities of transatlantic slavery, summed up
in archival histories that give us a bit of (asterisked-violated)
blackness, put meaningful demands on our scholarly and activist
questions. [While the tenets and the lingering histories of slavery and
colonialism produced modernity as and with and through blackness, this
sense of timespace is interrupted by a more weighty, and seemingly
truthful (truthful and truth-telling because iterated as scientific,
proven, certified, objective), underside-where black is naturally
malignant and therefore worthy of violation]{.underline}; where black is
violated because black is naturally violent; where black is naturally
unbelievable and is therefore naturally empty and violated; where black
is naturally less-than-human and starving to death and violated; where
black is naturally dysselected, unsurviving, swallowed up; where black
is same and always and dead and dying; where black is complex and
difficult and too much to bear and violated.3 [[The tolls of
death]{.mark} and violence, **[housed in the archive]{.mark}**,
**[affirm black death]{.mark}**]{.underline}. [[The tolls cast black as
**impossibly human**]{.mark} and provide the conditions through which
black history is currently told and studied. The death toll becomes the
source. [The tolls]{.mark} inevitably uncover, too, analyses of
histories and narratives and stories and data that honor and [**repeat**
and **cherish** anti-black violence and black
death]{.mark}]{.underline}. [[If the source of blackness is]{.mark}
[**death** and **violence**]{.mark}, the citation of blackness-[the
scholarly stories we tell]{.mark}-[calls for the **repetition of death
and violence**]{.mark}.]{.underline} [The practice of taking away life
is followed by the sourcing and citation of racial-sexual death and
racial-sexual violence and blackness is (always already and only) cast
inside the mathematics of unlivi ngness (data/scientifically
proven/certified violation/asterisk) where black comes to be (a
bit).]{.underline}4 Indeed, [[if blackness originates]{.mark} and
emerges [in]{.mark} violence and [death]{.mark}, black **[futures are
foreclosed]{.mark}** by the dead and dying asterisks. And if the dead
and dying are the archival and asterisked **cosmogonies of blackness**,
within our present system of knowledge-a system, to paraphrase Frantz
Fanon, where the subhuman is invited to become human on terms that
require antiblack sentiment-scraps and bits of black I ife and death and
narrative are guaranteed to move toward, to progress into, unlivingness
and anti-blackness]{.underline}. [5 With this in mind we would do well
to notice that scholarly and activist questions can, at times, be so
tightly tied to bits and pieces of narratives that dwell on anti-black
violence and black racial death-seeking out and reprising \"terrible
utterances\" to reclaim and recuperate black loss and somehow make it
all the less terrible-that our answerable analytical futures are also
condemned to death]{.underline}.6 Put differently, [[historically
present anti-black violence is **repaired** by **reproducing knowledge**
about]{.mark} the [black subjects that **renders them less than
human**]{.mark}]{.underline}. It is a descriptive analytics of violence.
The cyclical and death-dealing numeration of the condemned remains in
tact, at least in part, through analytical pathways that are beholden to
a system of knowledge that descriptively rehearses antiblack violences
and in this necessarily refuses decolonial thinking. [[How]{.mark} then
[do we]{.mark} think and write and share as decolonial scholars and
[foster a commitment to acknowledging violence and undoing its]{.mark}
persistent [frame, rather than]{.mark} simply **[analytically reprising
violence]{.mark}**]{.underline}? How do we ethically engage with
mathematical and numerical certainties that compile, affirm, and honor
bits and pieces of black death? In order to underscore the urgency here,
it is worth thinking about the ways in which slave ship and plantation
ledgers unfold into a series of crude and subjugating post-slave
accounts: The rule in the courts was that a drop of blood made you
black; just walking around looking about/This guy looks like he is up to
no good or he is on drugs or something; the accusation was beginning to
take on a familiar tone \... EmmettTill \... Scottsboro \... Armed with
his new political powers Diluilo came to have access to billions of
dollars in public funds to launch a program to reform the superpredators
by exorcising the evil he saw in them; three-quarters of the persons
arrested for such crimes were Negro \... in Detroit, the same
proportions held \.... Negro males represent 2.1 percent of all male
technicians while Negro females represent roughly 10 percent of all
female technicians \.... It would appear therefore that there are
proportionately 4 times as many Negro females in significant white
collar jobs than Negro males; these assholes, they always get away; it
would come to be based on degrees of selected genetic merit (or
eugenics) versus differential degrees of the dysselected lack of this
merit: differential degrees of, to use the term made famous by The Bell
Curve, \"dysgenicity.\"7 We can think of more accounts, more numbers,
more math. [In Demonic Grounds, I suggest that the markers of captivity
so tightly adhere to the black body that seeing blackness involves our
collective willingness to collapse it into a signifier of
dispossession]{.underline}.8 While I certainly suggest there, as I do
here, that black dispossession reveals the limits of our present
geographic order and opens up a way to imagine new modes of black
geographic thought, it is challenging to think outside the interlocking
data of black erasure, unfreedom, and anti-black violence[. Putting
pressure on archive numbers that, particularly in the case of the middle
passage and plantation life, are the only documents that tell us about
the ways in which the practice of slavery set the stage for our present
struggles with racism, is difficult. So, what do we do with the archival
documentation that displays this unfree and violated body as both
naturally dispossessed and as the origin of new world black
lives?]{.underline} How do we come to terms with the inventory of
numbers and the certain economic brutalities that introduce
blackness-the mathematics of the unliving, the certification of
unfreedam-and give shape to how we now I ive our lives? And what does it
mean that, when confronting these numbers and economic descriptors and
stories of murder and commonsense instances of anti-black violence, some
of us are pulled into that Fanonian moment, where our neurological
synapses and our motor-sensory replies do not result in relieved gasps
of nostalgia or knowing gasps of present emancipation (look how far we
have come/slavery is over/get over slavery/ post-race/look how far) but
instead dwell in the awfulness of seeing ourselves and our communities
in those numbers now?9 This is the future the archives have given me.
Yet, the Fanonian moment also disturbs to ask not how we get over the
awfulness and brutality, but rather how do we live with it, differently,
right now and therefore imagine what Sylvia Wynter describes as \"being
human as praxis\"?[10 In what follows, I move with the numbers and begin
to work out how the uncomfortable mathematics of black life can inform
current and future formations of black studies]{.underline}. [I suggest
that black studies not only names and posits the violent arithmetics of
the archive, but that [this citation of violence]{.mark} also can and
[should **no longer** ]{.mark}**ethically [repeat this
violence]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Indeed, while not always honored,
[[the]{.mark} intellectual [project of black studies-with its]{.mark}
long [history of]{.mark} citing and **[surviving racial
violence]{.mark}** in numbers-[provides a]{.mark} deliberate [commentary
on the ways]{.mark} in which [blackness]{.mark} **[works against the
violence that defines it]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Thus, across a range of
thinkers-! note Dionne Brand, Sylvia Wynter, Audre Lorde, Frantz Fanon,
but there are more and many to add-there is a careful effort to show
that if we are to name the violent displacement of black cultures, this
must be done by both noticing and undoing the compulsion to inhabit safe
and comfortable places within the very system that cannot survive
without anti-blackness. Indeed, the research of W. E. B. Du Bois, who
turns knowable racial numbers in on themselves to ask how the race is
both fixed and unfixed by social conditions, is especially notable here.

research, **utilizes mimicry** to convince the listener of the rightness

[[parroting]{.mark},]{.underline} the [[radical
literature]{.mark}]{.underline} of their heroes and heroines, [[they
strive to transform]{.mark} the [insights of]{.mark}]{.underline} these/
their [[professors]{.underline}]{.mark}, lawyers, activists into a new
morality. [[This]{.mark} morality [seeks to escape any practical debates
about the construction and constructing of a new world, or new

sacred texts of high intellectuals]{.underline}; the manipulators of
post-structural texts/postcolonial discourse/psychoanalytic theories of

vestibularity, and of course race, [seek to convince the world that as

female, the marginalized student) in fact do [hold the key to
understanding the world beneath them,]{.underline} as they are now
[[elevated to the realms of theory, from the perspectives of their gods
who reside in the Ivory tower.]{.underline}]{.mark}

[[The mistake]{.underline}]{.mark} Black theorists make [in

of [the world before them]{.mark}]{.underline}[.

[of the proposed theory, [there is]{.mark} an apriori [belief]{.mark} by

people the theory is directed towards, [[are]{.underline}]{.mark} in
fact moral people [able to be [persuaded]{.mark}, convinced, and
transformed through their own capacities and recognition of the "other

Black theory can be understood, acted upon, recognized by a person that
can understand]{.mark}]{.underline}, or a newly emerged person that can
now understand, [the perspective of [the "representative of the
oppressed" speaking to them]{.mark}]{.underline}. Why is this case? What
is it in the act of critiquing whites, the bourgeoisie, or men that make
the oppressed believe fundamentally that these groups can change? [**For
[the people who are "actually oppressed," "materially oppressed,"
"silenced," or]{.mark}** [**the Black male who is killed/dead and cannot
speak, but only be spoken about by the academics who use his death as a
symbol---a catalyst---of conversation with whites**, **this belief does
not exist**.]{.mark}]{.underline} [But for [this
group,]{.mark}]{.underline} Black theorists and their parrots, [who are
[the "representatives of the oppressed"]{.mark}]{.underline} that merely
act as sleeping dictionaries, or in the case of Black men, talking
monkeys [this [belief is **substantiated by**]{.mark} **an ancient
[faith in reason and the modern hope of
discourse.]{.mark}**]{.underline}

A Black intellectual socialized to imitate white theories and by effect
the pre-established semiotics that signify "intellect" as the basis of
their discourse with whites under the banner of radicality, pessimism or
anti-racist realism is of the greatest concern. In its brute reality,
this discursive replication was the primary concern of Carter G.
Woodson's The Miseducation of the Negro (1933). Contrary to the pop
culture summation of Woodson's 1933 work, Woodson was not primarily
concerned with the general education of Blacks by whites, Woodson was
concerned with the "highly educated Negro," who in studying the ideas
founded upon white understandings of philosophy, economics, law, and
religion, sought to apply this knowledge to the Black community. "The
educated Negro have the attitude of contempt toward their own people
because in their own as well as in their mixed schools Negroes are
taught to admire the Hebrew, the Latin and the Teuton and to despite the
African" (Woodson, 1933, p.1). Woodson's comment upon the
disciplinary/civilizational basis of "theory," is profound, despite
being almost a century old. The highly educated Negro, the same culprit
of E. Franklin Frazier's Failure of the Negro/Black Intellectual, seeks
to distant themselves from the Black community who remain mere objects
of study. Seeing themselves as ontologically different from the
other-Black-objects they study, these Black theorist(s) speak to white
gatekeepers and members of their own intellectual class who reward them
for the adamancy and spread of the ideas offered as morality. By
claiming to be enlightened and spreading "truth" the
post-structural/intersectional theorist need not know about the actual
conditions of the people they speak of, they need only present these
bodies and their conditions through the theories accepted by their
particular discipline and/or disciplinary community. Black Study
effectively becomes the process of confining/distorting/revising Black
life to fit theory. As Ahmed reminds us, "facts require explanations,
and all explanations, even bad ones, presume a configuration of
concepts, which we provisionally call \'theory,\' In other words, theory
is not simply a desirable but a necessary relation between facts and
their explanations" (1994, p.34). It is when this theory is considered
to be ontological---fundamental and necessary to the facts they seek to
explain---that they become apriori and ideological. It is this paradigm
from which the theory we concern ourselves with, and its effect upon the
actual study of Black people, are placed at odds with Black Studies.
Since the ontological claim is apriori, it dismisses the need for the
study of Black life since it takes the relation between the facts of
Black existence and theories proposed to be necessary to the Black
bodies observed. The truth concerning Blackness thereby becomes
revelation of some constant unchanging principle within Blackness rather
than the study of structures, historically conditioned and dynamic, upon
Black peoples. [[This bourgeois fanaticism voids the world of actual
Black people and **replaces them with Black subjects found wanting for
knowledge, recognition, and the politics of the "Black
theorist-observer."**]{.underline}]{.mark}

### Alt---Childs 

#### We introduce into the debate a [secretive archive]{.underline} of slavery which affirms silence rather than recuperative readings- the Tailors' Conspiracy in Brazil exemplifies that our archives are foundationally constituted by unknowability- there is no complete narrative or revolutionary narrative waiting to be sutured out of history- that form of historical mastery reifies the colonial subjectivity which makes genocide and enslavement possible. The alternative doesn't abandon history or the archive, but doesn't impose or re-narrate it toward a telos of dialectic liberation as they do, rather we demand you let the archives secrets remain secret, affirm the unknowability of the archive as key to black liberation

military officer]{.mark} was [passing through the courtyard of a church
plaza]{.mark} when he [was approached by a man holding a piece of paper
that he said he had torn from the walls of the church. The]{.mark}
handwritten [manifesto announced]{.mark} "[a coming revolution" that
would bring]{.mark} "great advantages to militia troops, and give
[liberty to the slaves]{.mark}."]{.underline} [[He]{.mark} immediately
[took the paper to his father, a colonel]{.mark} in the second regiment,
[who burned the document]{.mark} and informed his son that he should
have done the same.1 Several hours later, both father and son discovered
that [while they were burning one]{.mark} piece of paper, [others like
it had been discovered all across the city]{.mark}]{.underline}. Some
warned of death to priests and colonial officials who would attempt to
impede liberty.2 Others demanded a raise in wages for soldiers.3 Still
others called for an end to racial discrimination and slavery.4 All day,
reports of these public posters filtered in from soldiers, priests, and
tavern owners throughout the city. [Destruction by [fire proved]{.mark}
to be an [inadequate]{.mark} weapon [against this movement]{.mark} for
freedom, better pay, and racial equality. [On 8 November
1799]{.mark}]{.underline}, a little more than a year after the bulletins
were discovered, [many of [the same people]{.mark}]{.underline} who had
witnessed the appearance of the handbills crowded the narrow, hilly
streets leading from Bahia's prison in the center of the city to the
Piedade neighborhood at the city's periphery, where several seditious
bulletins had been discovered in a popular plaza. This time they [[were
on hand to witness]{.mark} the march of [four convicted men]{.mark} from
their jail cells to hastily crafted gallows, where they were [hanged for
the crime of authoring the documents and inciting]{.mark} the population
of [colonial Brazil's]{.mark} [most important city to
rebel]{.mark}]{.underline}. After the executions, the heads and limbs of
all four men were exposed in public locations across the city. [[All of
the men]{.mark} who were executed [were free people of
color]{.mark}]{.underline}. Because they were also tailors, this event
has been remembered in popular and academic discourse as the Conspiração
dos Alfaiates (Tailors' Conspiracy). From the moment that the
handwritten bulletins appeared until the final administration of the
punishments, conversations surrounding the Tailors' Conspiracy were
marked by a high degree of concern over the question of "the public."
This was not just a conspiracy, or a secret political act that was
violently repressed by a paranoid, irrational colonial state, as
previous studies of the event have argued.5 In fact, [[according to high
court judges, the event was]{.mark} also [a case of sedition]{.mark}, a
crime that was defined in the Portuguese legal code as attempting to
publicly encourage the populace to embrace ideas and rhetoric that were
considered disloyal and treasonous to the crown.6]{.underline} [[The
plot itself was]{.mark} thus [not secret]{.mark}---[it was]{.mark},
indeed, [performed publicly]{.mark}---[but the record is shrouded in
secrecy]{.mark}, both [by conspirators who kept secrets about
the]{.mark} details of the [plot and by officials who had the
power]{.mark} both [to]{.mark} burn documents and [create the permanent
archival record]{.mark} of the conspiracy.]{.underline} The sedition of
1798 thus points toward the ties that bound public and private, secrets
and confessions. More specifically, the official response and
investigation of what took place in Salvador da Bahia in 1798 reveal the
manner by which public executions and the restoration of the public good
in a colonial society hinged on silences and secrets kept by prisoners,
judges conducting secret interrogations, and colonial elites attempting
to suppress words scribbled on public posters. Plotting in secret was
thus not the exclusive preserve of prisoners but was engaged in by
colonial officials as well. Yet while the impetus for prisoners to keep
secrets was related to the fact that they were trying to avoid the death
sentence, judges were more likely motivated to keep secrets because
promotions for royal magistrates were based on a combination of
seniority, family connections, and a record of "exemplary performance"
in judicial cases.7 Considering that the law itself was vague about when
torture could be used, and considering that a judge's performance was in
some measure determined by both a judge's public reputation and his
record of interpreting and applying the law, the judges who investigated
the 1798 conspiracy had sufficient reason to not inscribe evidence of
torture into the interrogation record. Thus, [given that secrets were
critical to both rebels and colonial officials, [can we reconstruct the
aims of conspirators and the violence of colonial suppression from an
archive designed to keep both secret?]{.mark} This is a particularly
acute question for social historians who endeavor to write about the
subjugated, [given that we are occupied by the business of recovering
peoples and events that have heretofore existed as
incomprehensible]{.mark} "white spaces in the margins of the writing
\[of history\] and its text."]{.underline}8 In this article, however, I
intend to fully abstract from the question of what actually happened in
the interrogation chambers of the Tailors' Conspiracy so that I may
address a different problematic. Rather than trying to expose the
contents of the secrets hidden in trial records, I am more concerned
with examining how multiple secrets kept by prisoners may have motivated
investigating officials to create their own secrets. In examining this
multiplication of secrecy, I am motivated to demonstrate that [the
problem of recovery confronted those tasked with defending slavery as
much as it confronts contemporary historians of slavery. [Faced with the
realization that the full depth of black political thought, and for that
matter black interior lives in general, remained unknowable to them,
colonial elites reached for ever more extreme measures of finding out
the "truth."]{.mark} These measures were kept secret from the larger
populace and even from the ledgers of the archive itself]{.underline}.
Thus beyond the problem of secret tortures rests a darker secret
pertaining to the power of [colonial officials]{.underline}: those
[responsible for interpreting and applying the law could never know the
full extent of what they were responsible for discovering and
punishing.]{.underline} As the next, historiographical section of this
article highlights, [[when we aim to write histories of black social
life or political thought from]{.mark} such [archival records with the
aim of recovering]{.mark} or proving [the intentions of historical
actors]{.mark}, this [previous, failed attempt at recovery haunts our
efforts and can guide us]{.mark}---perhaps [against our own
inclinations---down the same paths of inquiry and fact checking as
colonial judges.]{.mark} We hence end up being [frustrated by the
noncommunicative prisoner or fugitive]{.mark}]{.underline} in much the
same manner as colonial officials were, [[even though we may write about
these individuals]{.mark} more [positively]{.mark}.]{.underline} I am
thus interested in not only how historians write about recovery but
also, and more centrally, how historical actors themselves dealt with
the problem of constructing narratives about what happened during a
particular historical event. This endeavor to confront how historical
actors crafted narratives about their own actions owes much to
Michel-Rolph Trouillot's contention that any theory of how history works
must embrace "both the ambiguity and the distinction" between
historicity I ("the materiality of the sociohistorical process") and
historicity II ("the stage for future historical narratives").9 Yet,
while Trouillot was concerned with how silences are produced and
inserted into historical narratives and analyses, I am concerned more
with the production of secrets that were deliberately not spoken or
written into the record by historical actors. The distinction that I am
highlighting here is not just semantic: information that has been
silenced can be uncovered and thus holds the allure of potentially being
recovered and included in future narratives. [[Information that has been
kept secret]{.underline}]{.mark}, on the other hand, [[cannot be viewed
simply as omissions from previous narratives that await the right
historian to discover and reveal them. Secrets]{.mark} created both by
record keepers and by subjects under interrogation [are]{.mark} perhaps
[better understood as attempts to keep certain facts and events from
ever being registered, written, or knowable. Secrets thus produce and
preserve a particular type of silence that is commensurate with
nonexistence.]{.mark} This distinction allows us to see that in episodes
of resistance we are confronted not only with silences but also with
historical actors who often try to erase all traces of an occurrence
before it can be inscribed in the archive. [I]{.mark} therefore [propose
that we shift away from viewing secrets as obstacles that prevent us
from understanding black political life to instead considering secrecy
as fundamental to the working of colonial society and colonial
relations.]{.mark} Appreciating [this nuance will allow us to see that
long before historians confront the limits of what can be recovered from
an archive, colonial officials had to confront the limits of what could
be known about black political life]{.mark}]{.underline}. Furthermore,
as I will show in the final section of this article, [[despite]{.mark}
our [best intentions as scholars to reconstruct the experiences of
historically marginalized people]{.mark}s, by [choosing to agonize over
secrets that we cannot know, we may be close to replicating the violence
that some subjects were attempting to avoid in the first place when they
kept secrets from colonial officials]{.mark}]{.underline}. For just as
Trouillot contends that all silences are not equal, all secrets are not
equal either.10 [[As the]{.mark} interrogation [records of the Tailors'
Conspiracy show, some secrets hide innocent names from
authorities]{.mark}, while [other secrets hide guilty
parties]{.mark}.]{.underline} However, some [[secrets also
allow]{.mark}ed [the movement and its ideas to continue
circulating]{.mark} throughout Bahia.]{.underline} Thus, [[attempting to
understand the work that such secrets accomplished instead of trying to
excavate their contents may offer us a unique way to study black radical
movements that are repressed. This is the knot that resides at the heart
of secrecy and the paradox that animates contemporary scholarly efforts
at recovery.]{.mark}]{.underline}

### Alt---Examples 

#### We don't need to win external offense or an alternative. If we win that the 1ac reproduces anti-blackness, there's only a chance that opaque resistance is more effective. We've cited a litany of examples of opaque resistance that generate black kinship without the spectacular performance of public trauma -- 

#### The anti-portraiture of Lorna Simpson\'s turned-away self-portraits which reject the Fanonian gaze 

#### The followers of Nongqawuse, the Xhosa prophetess who claimed in 1856 that the ancestral spirits told her that the Xhosa should slaughter all their cattle and destroy their crops (the repository of all their wealth), in return for which the spirits would banish their British occupiers into the sea---a millennialist prophesy that would result in a cattle-killing of such apocalyptic proportions that three-quarters of the Xhosa nation would die of the resulting famine

#### Four free people of color arrested and put to death in Salvador da Bahia, Brazil for the Tailor's Conspiracy, where posters demanding revolution were burned but the movement could not be stopped because they wouldn't snitch or reveal any details of the revolt itself

#### Amiri Barka's character Corliss in the 1963 novel Blues People where the death of Malcolm X compels Corliss to flee his bohemian "whiteout" and propels him to Harlem- speed lines drawn around him gave no peace or reflection, with no soliloquy, no long goodbye, no reflection: just movement Corliss yells "Press forward! Raise the struggle"

#### Enslaved Africans who in 17th century escaped to the Palmares region of Brazil, established settlements of fugitives who would abandon and burn their settlements every time the Portuguese soldiers approached- melting away into the wilderness, their society leaving no trace

#### Rebels in 1915 who fought British colonial rule in Nyasaland upon hearing their leader John Chilembwe's claim "we have determined to strike a first and last blow and then we will all die by the heavy storm of the white man's army"

### Floating PIC (Trauma)

#### Note -- the floating PIC is in the second line of the 2NC (we agree with archiving/wake work, but our form of that is better) -- this card contextualizes that as a form of 'situated solidarity' if you decide it would be useful to read 

#### This allows our criticism to occupy a unique spot within our current sociopolitical occasion called *[situated solidarity]{.underline}* which affirms the rupture against anti-blackness without the public spectacle of performance

My project is interested in how non-beings can make radical change in an
impossible neoliberal era using the affect of black rage. I prioritize
blackness in my research due to its positionality outside relation to
another, its fungibility to other bodies, and the creation of blackness
that sits at the foundation of American democracy. When I say non-beings
I am evoking the work of Franz Fanon, Hortense Spillers, and Saidya
Hartman who all think of blackness as a being outside of subjectivity.
For Fanon he uses the language of object to evoke the relation blackness
has to whiteness e.g. to be a subject is to be white, and only those who
are white can be legible to the state (Fanon 109). For Spillers she uses
the term flesh as a sign to demarcate the birth of blackness on the body
during the transatlantic slave trade. Only people who are not slaves
have access to a body thus it is in the naming of blackness in relation
to the flesh that she signals as illegible (Spillers 1987 66). [Hartman
defines non-being through the transatlantic slave trade as well, she
views black people as an object or what she calls the "the ground" that
allows for the birth of the bourgeois subject to emerge]{.underline}
(Hartman 62). [I affirm all of these scholars' notions of non-being;
however, [I]{.mark} [depart through a discussion of **present neoliberal
economic conditions that have provided shifts in how we think of
non-being.**]{.mark}]{.underline}

[[I depart from Afro Pessimism because of]{.underline} **[the
complications of neoliberalism that have shifted flows of power between
bodies and institutions]{.underline}**]{.mark}. I [want to **ground a
politics of impossibility on the realities of black life** while
**keeping in tension** how other non-beings relate to the histories, the
struggles, and the dominations tested, developed and crafted on black
flesh.]{.underline}

[[The tension between blackness and all other forms of non-being is
great; however]{.underline}]{.mark}, it is my project to highlight,
[[through]{.mark} my theory of [**situated solidarity**, moments where
black people and other non-beings' **political interests and desires
collide and burst apart what we previously thought was
impossible**]{.mark}]{.underline}. In other words [[Afro pessimist
scholars laid the groundwork]{.mark} for]{.underline} my arguments about
[the reality of blackness in America, [however]{.mark} I ultimately turn
away from an Afro Pessimist frame, because [I recognize that **the
quotidian technologies of domination are perfected on black flesh and
expanded and utilized against other non-beings as
well.**]{.mark}]{.underline}

Thus my main research questions are how is rage useful? What does rage
do for the black queer body in an accumulated time period of violence?
Does rage provide useful ruptures that bring people together? Do moments
of rage delimit the boundaries of identity categories? Does a tactic of
rage mobilize various communities creating an instance of situated
solidarity? Can rage create new worlds, kinship, systems of mutualism
and new ways of being? Can rage make possible a liberatory
reorganization of society?

I found that [[rage]{.underline}]{.mark} is incredibly useful; it
[[operates on multiple levels]{.underline}]{.mark}, for individual [rage
can be a form of self-love by way of self protection]{.underline} as it
was in the case of CeCe McDonald. CeCe's use of black rage had the
ability to collectivize her struggle affectively and pull in the
struggles of other non-beings to highlight the atrocities of the white
supremacy and trans\* misogyny simultaneously disrupting the trans\*
women death narrative. On a mass scale when connected to black death, as
it was in the Justice for Trayvon March and Rally in Atlanta Georgia,
research respondents described black rage as a force, an energy---an
affective sense of elation alongside feelings of anger and of being
distraught. In protest space the force of black rage filled in the gaps
between different non-beings, allowing for an affective feeling of
individuals' liberation being bounded up together. In other words,
**[[black rage brought about]{.mark} something that could be
called]{.underline}** [**[situated solidarity]{.mark}**---a phrase that
captures the complexity of a form of solidarity centered on analysis
dealing with the complexities of power relations between bodies in
space. [**Avoiding the pitfalls of notions of solidarity** that can
elide the relative privileges among group members, the term situated
solidarity both points to an interrelated solidarity that is
situated---mindful of one's own social location and relation to axes of
power for non-beings---and that **gestures to possible long-term forms
of kinship through affective political rupture**]{.mark}.]{.underline}
Black rage at the Justice for Trayvon Martin March and Rally made
research respondents feel as through something else in Atlanta was
possible. That something else was the taste and the smell of what a new
world in the shell of the old could be---a space of collectivity and a
sense of cohesion and togetherness that defies neoliberal forces of
separation and isolation. Black rage in both case studies proves to be
an affective weapon that can produce the material conditions and the
social relations for a new world to emerge.

### Floating PIC (Opacity)

#### Maintain the opacity of the archive of slavery itself- the aff's demand for transparency and production effectively mystifies and negates the radicality of their project by subjecting it to a colonial form of academic and institutional surveillance in the very style they critique- solves the aff better

[[Transparency has become so widespread]{.mark} an ideal, valued and
invoked by diverse constituencies in so many sectors of contemporary
life across the]{.underline} \[End Page 363\] [globe]{.underline} (from
government to business to education), [that [its moral authority often
appears obvious]{.mark}]{.underline}. Though deploying it to different
ends, neoliberal, liberal, and leftist discourses all frequently take
transparency, or disclosure, to be a key principle of good governance
and social relations. [This contemporary trend draws heavily on a
Western Enlightenment current shaped most prominently by Jean-Jacques
Rousseau and Jeremy Bentham, who theorized transparency as a tool of
liberation ensuring the proper functioning of representative
government.]{.underline} On this view, transparency serves a normative
purpose first by rendering the few, the governing, visible to the many,
the governed, and thus in principle subject to judgment and repeal by
the
people.[1](https://muse.jhu.edu.ezproxy.baylor.edu/journals/symploke/v023/23.1-2.simek.html#f1)
[Moreover, in associating clarity with rational thought more precisely,
the Enlightenment principle of [transparent governance conceived
of]{.mark} responsibility, or [answerability, as involving both
accountability and accounting]{.mark}]{.underline}[.
[Transparency]{.underline}]{.mark} [was not merely thought to expose the
actions of the governing, but [relied on, and sought to bolster,
rational modes of conduct]{.mark}]{.underline}. As Christopher Hood puts
it, transparency has become associated not only with "governance that is
intelligible and accessible to the 'general public,'" but also with
"decisions governed by clearly established and published rules and
procedures rather than by ad hoc judgments or processes; \[and\] methods
of accounting or public reporting that clarify who gains from and who
pays for any public measure" (qtd. in [Birchall 2011,
61](https://muse.jhu.edu.ezproxy.baylor.edu/journals/symploke/v023/23.1-2.simek.html#b2)).
Transparency is as much about rule-governed, predictable and
reproducible modes of reasoning and acting as it is about visibility in
itself. As a check on the arbitrary exercise of repressive power
concentrated in the hands of the few, transparent, or publically
visible, rule-governed practices have obvious benefits. [Transparency's
roots in egalitarian principles have contributed to its enduring moral
authority in the United States, while [its manifestation in repeatable
techniques of accounting have led to its enthusiastic exportation by
Western governments, the World Bank,]{.mark} and numerous [transnational
agencies, as well as anti-colonial activist groups]{.mark}.]{.underline}
If the 1980s saw what Aradhana Sharma describes as "a turn toward good
governance \[...among\] mainstream development institutions," who
faulted developing countries' governmental secrecy, corruption, and
inefficiency for the failures of structural adjustment programs (2013,
309), the decades since then have seen what Mehrpouya and Djelic term an
"explosion of...visibility-based accountability structures" (2014, 1).
These include IMF-imposed liberalization programs in debtor states, for
example, programs that are a familiar target of critique today, but also
populist-backed legal reforms instituting \[End Page 364\] freedom of
information acts, as well as non-governmental transparency-based
movements and platforms, such as WikiLeaks. [The value of transparency
has not gone unchallenged, despite its wide use. [Critiques come]{.mark}
on the one hand [from]{.mark} liberal [thinkers]{.mark} [who view the
growing neoliberal audit culture]{.mark} as a threat to egalitarian
principles and balance of power, [as a perverted implementation of
transparency]{.mark}. As Mehrpouya and Djelic have shown, while the
particular forms transparency is taking under the neoliberal "turn"
today are alarming, it is also helpful to recall that transparency has
been developing along competing trajectories in the West since the
eighteenth century, and that its problems are not entirely
new]{.underline}. [If democratic thinkers emphasized the need to make
"the few visible to the many," state actors throughout the eighteenth
and nineteenth centuries also sought to "make the many visible to the
few," to control and shape the behavior of large masses of people
through various surveillance techniques and practices of knowing, often
in the name of rational thought and enlightened progress]{.underline}
([Mehrpouya and Djelic
2014](https://muse.jhu.edu.ezproxy.baylor.edu/journals/symploke/v023/23.1-2.simek.html#b18)).
Given the entanglement of these various practices of visibility, and the
capaciousness of liberal thought (which has been put to the service of
both democratic and authoritarian modes of governance), contemporary
leftist critiques of neoliberalism have taken aim at its liberal
underpinnings, questioning liberalism's and transparency's complicity
with global capitalism and audit culture. To this end, [critics like
Clare Birchall have directed attention to under-examined assumptions
about the principles frequently opposed to transparency---such as
secrecy, inefficiency, and corruption---and those thought to flow from
transparency---such as accountability, honesty, and trust. In order to
rethink and deploy more effective strategies of resistance, Birchall
argues, we must decouple these linkages, "whereby secrecy comes to be
associated with all that is nefarious...and transparency with all that
is noble"]{.underline} (2011, 66). This work of critique allows us to
think about transparency and secrecy not as fixed entities locked in
opposition to one another, but as modes of relating that can be either
productive or
repressive.[2](https://muse.jhu.edu.ezproxy.baylor.edu/journals/symploke/v023/23.1-2.simek.html#f2)
[[Glissant's demand for a "right to opacity," his assertion that "we
need those stubborn shadows where repetition leads to perpetual
concealment, which is our form of resistance,"]{.mark} performs a
similar type of intervention]{.underline} by recoupling terms thought to
be unrelated or opposed. The phrase "right to opacity" reintroduces a
concept---opacity---that rights discourses have neglected, drawing
attention to the historical processes through which some rights becomes
naturalized and others do not. If such a phrasing risks playing \[End
Page 365\] into the logic of natural rights, suggesting that opacity is
an inherent property or identity in need of recognition, the notion of
the stubborn shadow---or "épaisseurs têtues" (1997, 17), stubborn
densities or hard-headed thick-nesses---[[reframes opacity]{.mark} as a
project, [as an active mode of resistance]{.mark} that emerges in
response to particular political problems.]{.underline} More
specifically, [opacity becomes resistance [when it serves to
confront]{.mark} what Glissant terms "[the ideal of transparent
universality, imposed by the West"]{.mark} (2). Insisting that [the West
is "a project, not a place"]{.mark}]{.underline} (1989, 1[), [Glissant
situates opacity in opposition to an Enlightenment project of
knowledge]{.mark} that valued universal models and categories, and one
[that functioned through a process of understanding or
comprehending]{.mark} (in the strong sense of [seizing or grasping) that
relied on reducing and hierarchizing]{.mark}. "If we examine the process
of 'understanding' people and ideas from the perspective of Western
thought,"]{.underline} as he puts it in Poetics of Relation[, "we
discover that its basis is this requirement for transparency. In order
to understand and thus accept you, I have to measure your solidity with
the ideal scale providing me with grounds to make comparisons and,
perhaps, judgments. I have to reduce"]{.underline} (1997, 190). [The
initial density that difference presents evaporates as the knower drills
down into it; [opacity is transmuted, falsely, into transparency, as the
knower looks upon it as in a mirror, perceiving not the opaque bottom,
but the reflection of the self,]{.mark} of the "world in its \[Western
humanity's\] own image"]{.underline} (1997, 111). [In the colonial
period, as Patrick Crowley points out, [this narcissistic project was
translated concretely into acts of "knowing" the colonized subject that
bolstered imperial control---acts of knowing carried out by]{.mark} all
sorts of [civil servants, administrators, geographers, ethnographers,
and cultural producers]{.mark}]{.underline} (2006, 107). To assert one's
right to opacity is to refuse to be known solely on the terms of the
colonizer and for the colonizer's benefit. As Crowley puts it, [[opacity
appears]{.mark} not as an anti-rational mode of thought tout court, but
rather "[as a medium that resists the light of (Western) understanding
in order to preserve diversity and advance exchanges based not upon
hierarchy but upon networks that abolish the primacy of any one centre
of understanding]{.mark}"]{.underline} (2006, 107).
[Opacity]{.underline}, then, becomes a figure for diversity, for what
[[interrupts the gaze and management of Western
thought]{.mark}.]{.underline}

#### The aff reveals their strategy to the government -- this ensures failure -- prefer an opaque strategy of resistance

**McBay No Date** (Aric McBay, Chapter 10, Recruitment,
https://deepgreenresistance.net/en/organization/recruitment/derrick-jensen-alternative-media/)

[Early]{.underline} Weather Underground and SDS
[[strategy]{.underline}]{.mark} similarly [[ignored the **importance of
surprise**]{.underline}]{.mark} in [[planning actions by **advertising**
and **promoting** **open conflicts**]{.underline}]{.mark} with the state
and police in advance. [This was criticized by other groups at the
time]{.underline}. Writes Ron Jacobs, "From the Yippies' vantage point,
the idea of setting a date for a battle with the state was ridiculous:
it provided the police with a greater capacity to counter-attack, and it
also took away the element of surprise, the activists' only
advantage.... [Pointing out the differences between the planned,
offensive violence of Weatherman]{.underline} and Yippie's spontaneous,
defensive version, Abbie Hoffman termed Weatherman's
**[[confrontations]{.underline}]{.mark}** 'Gandhian violence for the
element of purging guilt through moral witness.' "18 (This analysis is
interesting, if perhaps surprising and a little ironic, given the
Yippies' propensity for symbolic and theatrical actions.) A most notable
example of this problem was the "Days of Rage" gathering in Chicago in
1969. According to Weatherman John Jacobs, the intent of the Days of
Rage was to confront the forces of the state and "shove the war down
their dumb, fascist throats and show them, while we were at it, how much
better we were than them, both tactically and strategically, as a
people."19 [[Jacobs told the Black Panthers that 25,000
protesters]{.underline}]{.mark} would be present.20 However, only about
200 showed up, met by more than a 1,000 trained and well-equipped
police. In a speech the day of the event, Jacobs changed tack and argued
for the importance of fighting for righteous and moral (rather than
tactical or strategic) reasons: "We'll probably lose people today ... We
don't really have to win here ... just the fact that we are willing to
fight the police is a political victory."21 The protesters then started
something of a riot, smashing some police cars and luxury businesses,
but also miscellaneous cars, a barbershop, and the windows of lower- and
middle-class homes22---not a great argument for superior strategy and
tactics. The [[police quickly **dispatched the
protesters**]{.underline}]{.mark} with tear gas, batons, and bullets. In
the following days, [[almost 300 people were arrested,
including]{.underline}]{.mark} most of [[the]{.underline}]{.mark}
Weather [[Underground and SDS leadership]{.underline}]{.mark}. The Black
Panthers---who were not afraid of political violence or of fighting the
police---denounced the action as foolish and counterproductive. [[The
Weather Underground]{.underline}]{.mark}, at least, [[did seem to learn
from this when they **went underground** and used tactics better suited
to an asymmetric conflict]{.underline}]{.mark}. (How effective their
tactics were while underground is another question.)

### AT: Survival Strategy

#### The notion of a "survival strategy" is based on a conservative notion of freedom which reifies neoliberal objectivism

Psychology with the Rocky Mountain College of Art and Design, The
Neoliberalism Behind Sexy Veganism: Individuals, Structures, and
"Choice", veganfeministnetwork.com/tag/individualism/

I'm going to make a radical claim, well, actually it's pretty widely
accepted in the social sciences: [There is no "choice." This isn't about
the individual. This is about systems of oppression and social
structures that shape our behavior and limit what choices are available
to us based on our social identity.]{.underline} If you are a young,
thin, white woman advocating for Nonhuman Animals in a pornified,
hyper-sexualized society, one choice stands out loud and clear: Get
naked. It's supposed to be empowering, and we think maybe it helps
animals.

First, I'm not really sure why one has to feel sexually empowered when
one is advocating against the torture and death of Nonhuman Animals. Why
our movement is keen on making violence a turn on is a little
disturbing. It probably speaks something to our tendency to juxtapose
women with violence. The sexualization of violence against women and
other feminized social groups like Nonhuman Animals is evidence to the
rape culture we inhabit.

Aside that, however, "**[[choice" is]{.mark} often [thrown around as a
means of deflecting critical thought at systems of
oppression]{.mark}]{.underline}**[. [If it's all about your individual
choice, only you are responsible, only you are to blame. Anyone who has
a problem with that must be **judging you as a
person**]{.underline}]{.mark}. [So often [our advocacy is framed]{.mark}
[as]{.mark} personal choice, an [individual
expression]{.mark}]{.underline}. If you aren't vegan, that's your
"choice." If you want to have sex with vegetables and have it filmed by
PETA, that's your "choice." **[[This is a co-optation of]{.mark}
anti-oppression social [activism in]{.mark} a [neo-liberal]{.mark}
structure of [exploitation]{.mark}]{.underline}**.

[[Neoliberalism is all about "freedom": **Freedom from
government**]{.mark}, freedom [from regulation]{.mark}, freedom [to
buy,]{.mark} freedom [to sell]{.mark}, freedom to reach your full
potential,]{.underline} etc. [[It's about individuals out for
themselves]{.underline}. [This is how capitalism
thrives]{.underline}]{.mark}: many are free to do whatever they want in
the name of open markets, but ultimately, that [freedom comes at a cost
to those who will inevitably be exploited to pay for that
"freedom]{.underline}[."]{.mark} The ideology of neoliberalism and
individualism works to benefit the privileged when individuals can
attribute their success to their own individual hard work (when in
reality they had extensive help from their race, gender, class, physical
ability, etc.). It also works to blame those less fortunate for their
failure. We call them lazy, stupid, leeches (when in reality they had
extensive barriers placed upon them according to their race, gender,
class, physical ability, etc.).

This myth of freedom and meritocracy is actually pretty toxic for social
movements. If we fail to recognize how structural barriers impede some,
while structural privileges benefit others, we will find it difficult to
come together as a political collective. [[When we]{.mark} soak in this
neoliberal poison and start to [view social
movements--]{.mark}inherently [collective endeavors designed to
challenge]{.mark} unequal [power structures--as something done by the
individual, **for the individual**, we've lost the fight]{.mark} right
off the bat.]{.underline}

### AT: TVA Links 

#### Our TVA and our model don't center trauma and overcoming, but instead highlight structural instances of anti-black violence and the benefits of moving towards incremental political remedy. [Only]{.underline} the 1ac invests into the false hope of transforming anti-black institutions through the invocation of affective labor 

### AT: Theorizing Blackness Good 

#### The aff presumes the history they speak is a one-to-one relationship with the truth of the Middle Passage and slave experiences which reifies Fanonian colonial violence. To put it simply the power to know is power over. The aff not only dwells with black death but constantly attempts to recuperate the lost past. That melancholic slavish relationship to loss creates ressentiment-ridden subjects as blackness becomes synonymous with lack. The aff itself repeats the violence of Western surveillance through a psychic frame that enacts a "cannibal selection" of history for the benefit of progress and debate.

## 2NC---AT: Various 

### AT: Framework = 2x Turn 

####  Framework isn't a double-turn, it's a demonstration of our argument -- if they win that debate is fundamentally suspect, why did the 1ac introduce intimate knowledge of resistance into its affective economy? At worst, raising that question is a logical test of the aff which demonstrates the value of negative idea testing. 

### AT: Disidentification 

**Disidentification is not a coping strategy, but instead the affective
allure of semiotic capitalism -- the affirmative's rejection of scripts
of identity, i.e. the social positioning of blackness and queerness,
does not disrupt the system but reconstitutes the system's
interpellation - the perfection of entrepreneurial ideology and the
means of subjection itself.**

(Princeton: Princeton University Press, 2005[). [I follow Brown]{.mark}
here]{.underline} in [[stressing the interpellative dimension of
neoliberal ideology: "\[N\]eoliberalism]{.mark} normatively constructs
and [**interpellates** individuals as **entrepreneurial actors** in
**every** sphere of life"]{.mark}.]{.underline} In Democracy and Other
Neoliberal Fantasies (Jodi Dean, Democracy and Other Neoliberal
Fantasies \[Durham: Duke University Press, 2009\]), Jodi Dean has called
into question this all-too-familiar Althusserian framing of neoliberal
ideology; [[Dean takes from Žižek the critical diagnostic of the
postmodern condition as one of fundamental crisis in the symbolic order
("the]{.mark} quasi-transcendental [Master-Signifier]{.mark} that
guarantees the consistency of the big Other ... [is ultimately]{.mark} a
fake, an [empty]{.mark} signifier [without a
signified]{.mark}"]{.underline} \[Slavoj Žižek, The Fragile Absolute,
or, Why Is the Christian Legacy Worth Fighting For? (London: Verso,
2000), p. 106\]. [[With this new era of uncertainty come **new forms**
of political subjectivization, which are]{.underline}]{.mark}, however,
[[**not any less** **controlling** or **oppressive**]{.mark}. In light
of [the sheer diffusion of new disciplinary sites]{.mark}, which [have
severely weakened symbolic prohibitive norms but significantly increased
the production of imaginary ideals,]{.mark} Dean urges us to recalibrate
our analysis:]{.underline} "So [[neoliberal ideology **does not**
produce]{.mark} its [subjects by]{.mark} [interpellating them into
**symbolically anchored identities**]{.mark}]{.underline} (structured
[[according to]{.underline}]{.mark} conventions of [**[gender]{.mark}**,
race, work, and national citizenship]{.underline}). **[[Instead, it
enjoins subjects to develop our creative potential and cultivate our
individuality]{.underline}]{.mark}**" (Jodi Dean, Democracy and Other
Neoliberal Fantasies, p. 66). While making a compelling case for a
taking a more critical look at interpellation as an adequate notion to
elucidate the workings of ideology, Jodi Dean's dismissal of
interpellation tout court (it is just too outdated) strikes me as
unwarranted. Here, Žižek's own engagement with the Althusserian concept
seems preferable. [[Approaching t]{.mark}he question of [interpellation
from its putative other]{.mark}---[disidentification]{.mark} (what
happens when one refuses the "hail" of interpellation, [when one refuses
to assume the symbolic place imposed on us by the big Other--- Žižek
**deconstructs** the]{.mark} latter's [**subversive aura**.]{.mark} He
perspicaciously asks: ["\[I\] s disidentification necessarily
**subversive** of the existing order, or is]{.mark} a certain mode of
disidentification, of '[**maintaining a distance' towards one's symbolic
identity, consubstantial with effective participation in social
life**?"]{.mark}]{.underline} (Slavoj Žižek Contingency, Hegemony,
Universality, p. 9). [It is precisely the [**oscillation** between
**success (identification**) and **failure (disidentification**)]{.mark}
that [makes interpellation]{.mark} as such [all **the more irresistible
and powerful**, **duping the**]{.mark} **overtly [confident critic who
thinks]{.mark} he or [she has de-masked, blocked or explained away

[Many of [these revolutionary movements' key 'representational spaces\'
do generate]{.mark} [insurrectionist spatiality]{.mark}]{.underline},
like Tahrir Square, the Maidan, or Zuccotti Park, [[that feed into
the]{.mark} mythos of [new world order **grounded in vigilant
resilience**]{.mark}, but [those shifts become more **feasible
only**]{.mark} [with]{.mark} **microelectronic [info]{.mark}rmation**
and **communication [tech]{.mark}nologies**.]{.underline} Diversely
imagined communities of incumbent and insurgent forces interact through
'space as directly lived through its associated images and symbols, and
the space of "inhabitants" and users ... this is the dominated---and
hence passively experienced---space which the imagination seeks to
change and appropriate\' (Lefebvre, 1991, p. 39). [Both sets of
contending imaginative forces will change and appropriate the acts and
artifacts of insurrection in many]{.underline} [small ways that affirm
the resistance of insurrections as well as actualize the resilience of
the authorities they challenge]{.underline}.

[[These]{.mark} calculated and [intelligible workings]{.mark} of power
are neither so formulaic nor inspired that they appear
unprecedented]{.underline}. Rather **[they [are continuously
emergent]{.mark}]{.underline}**, and deeply embedded, [aspects of
post-Cold War relations of power, which 'are both intentional and
non-subjective', making them]{.underline} as Foucault would argue,
'[imbued, through and through, with calculation: There is no power that
is exercised without a series of aims and objectives\']{.underline}
(Foucault, 1978, pp. 94--95). [[Resilience]{.underline}]{.mark}
certainly has objective [[aims as]{.mark} a mode of
[governmentalizing]{.mark} rule]{.underline}. Nevertheless[, [it
seemingly accepts some aspects of]{.mark} [sustainability]{.mark},
insurrectionality, complexity, [or reflexivity as **harnessed
oppositional**]{.mark} **[energies]{.mark}**]{.underline}.
[[These]{.mark} elective [affinities cannot be tracked back to 'the
choice]{.mark} or decision [of an individual subject',]{.mark} even
though it is readily apparent that each one\'s operational 'logic is
perfectly clear, the aims decipherable\']{.underline} (Foucault, 1978,
p. 95).

[[Insurrectionality unfolds]{.underline}]{.mark}, like sustainability,
[[as **another layer** in the **contemporary codes of global
performativity**]{.underline}. [Resilient authority
structures]{.underline}]{.mark} [at work in the deep state collaborate
continuously through never-ending police operations to [**contain**,
**shape**, or **manage**]{.mark} **[insurrectionable
development]{.mark}**]{.underline}. In so doing,
[[they]{.underline}]{.mark} refine [[appear to refine their 'systems
of]{.mark} neutralization and [equivalence\' to select]{.mark} those
motifs, styles or [traits of insurgency that become]{.mark}
**'[comparable within the capitalistic economy of
flows]{.mark}'**]{.underline}, even though it often will be 'necessary
to hide them, cut them off, make them over, or better yet transform them
from the inside\' (Guattari, 2011, p. 79).

[[Organizing new anti-capitalist insurrections through tweets, posts,
and blogs is **not that**]{.mark} **[dissimilar from enforcing their
pacification through commercial counter-tweets,]{.mark} [anti-posts, and

presumes episodes of failure]{.mark}, interruption, and turbulence.
[Otherwise, it is less]{.mark}]{.underline} [[effective at maintaining
operational resilience]{.mark} in all 'the functions of opening and
reclosing signifying assemblages\' for the distributed and resilient
power grids maintaining today\'s precarious social peace]{.underline}
(Guattari, 2011, p. 79). [[Insurrectionality]{.mark} might well improve

4\. Resilience is Insurrectionable Development

The rapid urbanization of planet Earth transmutates cityscapes and
countrysides into a profusion of man-made conurbanations (Virilio,
2000). Still

the metropolis is not just this urban pile-up, the final collusion of
city and country. It is also a flow of beings and things, a current that
runs through fiber-optic networks, through high-speed train lines,
satellites, and video surveillance cameras, making sure that this world
keeps running straight to its ruin. (Invisible Committee, 2009, pp.
58--59)

Maintaining cohesion and coherence against any and all insurrectionists
under these circumstances basically is improbable, if not impossible.
Hence, an ethos of accepting risk and accommodating it resiliently
unfolds to rejoin shattered pieces and reintegrate suddenly incoherent
practices as viable and enhanced forms of life (Miller & Rose, 2008).

Rather than pretending to be invulnerable and steady, resilient state
power may well concede its tendencies to fail even as it labors to stay
up and running.

It is precisely due to this architecture of flows that the metropolis is
one of the most vulnerable human arrangements that has ever existed.
Supple, subtle, but vulnerable ... the world would not be moving so fast
if it didn\'t have to constantly outrun its own collapse. (Invisible
Committee, 2009, 60)

Frequently, [the [resilience]{.mark} thinking behind current-day
governmentality [accedes that the Earth\'s]{.mark} [environment]{.mark}
as such [is **becoming a continuous catastrophe**]{.mark}]{.underline}.
Instead of struggling to guard pristine ecologies against all probable
threats, [the ethos of [endangerment]{.mark} at the core of resilience
[affirms that all]{.mark} [environments must persist through
**punctuated**]{.mark} **incidents of [toxic
catastrophe]{.mark}**]{.underline}. [[The relation of state power to the
masses in resilience regimes recognizes 'the environment
is]{.underline}]{.mark} [[nothing more than the relationship to the
world that is proper to the metropolis]{.mark} and that projects itself
onto everything that would escape it]{.underline}\' (Invisible
Committee, 2009, p. 75).

Indeed, the modalities of insurrectionable development concede that the
metropolis is a terrain of constant low-intensity conflict, in which the
taking of Basra, Mogadishu, or Nablus mark politics of
culmination ... no longer undertaken in view of victory or peace, or
even the re-establishment of order, such 'interventions\' continue a
security operation that is always already in progress. War is no longer
a distinct event in time, but instead diffracts into 'a series of
micro-operations, by both military and police, to ensure security'.
(Invisible Committee, 2009, pp. 56--57)

[These institutional developments arguably are also part of the effects
following from the advent of walled states and waning
sovereignty]{.underline}. This couplet of order and disorder is taking
hold across many societies around the world, but especially in those
regimes that rest upon building physical barriers between the starkly
divided classes of technologically competent, obsolescent, and
superfluous workers proliferating in divisive cultures and exploited
societies trapped in a globalized world economy. Wendy Brown focuses her
attention on the border walls between the USA and Mexico running from
California to Texas and Israel\'s security walls on the West Bank in the
Sinai, and near Gaza (2010, pp. 28--42) to spotlight these
contradictions. Such 'security fences\' seem often fail as impermeable
barriers, and therefore create little security (Nevins, 2002; Weizman,
2007). Yet, they never were intended to be impermeable secure barriers.
Rather they are the most massive markers of how far more tangible
divides already are always being erected between businesses and
communities, the rich and poor, racial majorities and minorities, or the
top and bottom of society over the last 50 years. Through the practices
of urban redevelopment, freeway construction, public housing, gated
communities, secure skyscrapers, guarded campuses, and other 'defensible
spaces\' around the world, the walled state has morphed into the sine
qua non of civil society.

As Brown suggests, 'walls respond to and externalize the causes of
different kinds of perceived violence to the nation, and the walls
themselves exercise different kinds of violence toward the families,
communities, lands, and political possibilities they traverse and
shape\' (2010, p. 38). While she regards them as ineffective security
mechanisms per se, one wonders how insurrections are the material
effects of when and where 'walls inadvertently subvert the distinction
between inside and outside that they are intended to mark\' as well as
'what contingent effects they have in contouring nationalisms, citizen
subjectivities, and the identities of political entities on both of
their sides\' (Brown, 2010, p. 41). To solidify the logics of
resilience, then, walls prove to be important mechanisms to effectuating
the insecurities that resilient rule requires.

In too many ways, [the growing inequalities and social [divisions in
post-Fordist neoliberal economies]{.mark} [are]{.mark} barriers [very
rarely experienced everyday in mass behavior]{.mark}]{.underline}. [[The
fabrication of walls]{.underline}]{.mark}, fences, checkpoints, [and
other dividers simultaneously imply insurrections [can be both fueled,
and]{.mark} actively [contained, by]{.mark} the structural]{.underline}
[violence of [neolib]{.mark}eral dispossession]{.underline} (Lazzarato,
2012). In stimulating and then sparking insurrection, then, how
normalized is insurrectionality becoming in these decades-old patterns?
[And, after multiple cycles of insurrection-and-suppression, to what
extent have resilient responses become, in fact, an emergent regimen of
governance rather than entrenched embattlement]{.underline}?

[[Inequality is growing]{.mark}, insurrectionality persists, [and
injustice is rife. Yet]{.mark}]{.underline}, [the [prevailing
powers]{.mark} [concede]{.mark} openly [these realities by reimagining
themselves always improving]{.mark} how they will respond to
injustice-fueled mayhem]{.underline}, insurrectional destruction, and
inegalitarian turmoil. [[Events like]{.mark} Watts, California; Detroit,
Michigan; Liberty City, Florida; South Los Angeles, California; and
**[Ferguson]{.mark}**, Missouri]{.underline} from the 1960s through the
2010s in the USA [[unfold]{.mark} different [manifold variations]{.mark}
of insurrectionality, but the growing resilience of civil municipal
authority and police powers in facing these events matters also
evolves.]{.underline} [[They are being **tested**, **refined**, and
**readied** for the next insurrectionable developments waiting to be
**triggered by a traffic stop**]{.mark}, [a **street fight** or an **ID
check**]{.mark} involving a cop and citizen. [Inside
and]{.mark}]{.underline} [[outside]{.mark} now [coincide in the **logics
of**]{.mark} **[resilience-as-rule]{.mark}**]{.underline}[.]{.mark}

5\. Insurrectionality: Governance through Resilience

[With the militarization of municipal, regional and national police
forces in the USA and other OECD countries (]{.underline}one here can
think about the overly aggressive display of military-grade weaponry in
response at Ferguson, Missouri or Keene, New Hampshire to civil rights
protest or student mayhem that was not wholly unlike that of Egyptian
military and police forces in Tahrir Square), [new global trends of
social control and organization, rooted in resilient styles of
governance, are gelling in the turbulence of
insurrectionality]{.underline}. Add to these rapid response forces, [the
securitized surveillance system of closed-circuit television,
cybertracking, biometric scanning, and addressable individual tracking
devices]{.underline}; and, the [withering away of many other streams of
popular ideological resistance as corrective feedback loops, the powers
that be, have been, and will be seem, if they are truly sophisticated,
to be adding insurrection to their risk society calculi]{.underline}.
Indeed, [these new integers for innovation justify building and
enforcing a potent mix of resilience tactics, which are tested as
ideology and practice for continued elite empowerment.]{.underline}

[Rising up in the streets against authority in the fury of intense
insurrection is acceptable]{.underline}, [but standing up slowly to
truly assume power has become much less likely.]{.underline} Still, the
collapse of economic growth, the decay of middle and working class job
opportunities, civic infrastructure decay, loss of public goods, and
degradation of private markets are all generating and maintaining a high
level of insurrectional energy (Luke, 2012). Now [the elite discourses
embedded in the reproduction of existing power structures knowingly
accedes to insurrection, and even can concede conceptually, its
justifiable bases, which endorses its existence as 'insurrectionable
development\']{.underline}. **[Instead of a 'clash of
civilizations\']{.underline}** (Huntington, 1996), these arrangements
for a resilient adaptation to recurrent anarchy are the nuts and bolts
needed for 'governing the present\' (Miller & Rose, 2008). Governance
games on this scale harness legitimate corrective impulses from the
outsiders, underclasses, and superfluous populace to make improvements
in some state and non-state services, which usually enhance systemic
resilience, regime stability, and the sustainability of ruling
alliance/elite/bloc/class power (Guattari & Negri, 2010).

Are [[insurrections]{.underline}]{.mark}---both peaceful and violent
instances of direct action---crucial opportunities for policy
innovations? They [[seem to]{.underline} [appear as fluid zones of
indeterminate determination]{.underline}]{.mark} [where layers of
opposition and acceptance arguably are 'at once economic,]{.underline}
[political, and cultural]{.underline}---and hence [th[ey are
**biopolitical struggles**, struggles over the **forms of
life**]{.mark}]{.underline} ... [[creating **new public spaces** and
**new forms of community\'**]{.underline}]{.mark} (Hardt & Negri, 2000,
p. 56). Likewise, [do insurrections reconfigure 'the organization of the
social]{.underline} [worker and immaterial labor\' in which 'bodies are
on the front lines of this battle, bodies that consolidate in an
irreversible way the results of past struggles and incorporate a power
that has been gained ontologically\']{.underline} (Hardt & Negri, 2000,
p. 410) stand ready to OWS, but are they also truly unable to ever
manage Wall Street?

Along these lines, [[insurrection becomes yet one more reflexive
dimension of modernity\'s]{.mark} **[disciplinary modulations of
individual and collective human life]{.mark}**]{.underline}. [[State
authority rationally maps]{.mark}, [and]{.mark} then [manages]{.mark}
the degrees of [freedom]{.mark} allowed in the life of its subjects or
citizens through the dispositifs at work in many embedded institutions
woven into the territorial fabric of states]{.underline}. The command
and control containments of these degrees of unruly freedom, which are
clearly allowed to human life by state power, [unevenly meld
sovereignty, territoriality, and population as new
resistant-and-resilient coproductions of governmentality]{.underline}
(Foucault, 1978).

Hence, [[resilience]{.underline}]{.mark}-ready [[rulers often use
popular direct action effectively to ensnare the population]{.mark} [in
'apparatuses of security\']{.mark}]{.underline}, [like those created by
various police forces, homeland security units, public health measures,
etc., [in a manner such that these events also address 'health,
education]{.mark} [and social welfare systems and the mechanisms of the
management of the national economy\']{.mark}]{.underline} (Dean, 1999,
p. 20). In turn, [can these governmentalizations of insurrectionable
developments settle into 'the juridical and administrative apparatuses
of the state in all of the ways that optimize the health, welfare and
life of populations\' as biopolitical formations]{.underline} (Dean,
1999, p. 20)? Quite clearly, [this complex style of resilient response
must be studied, since the emergent regimentations of governance
practices have 'a technical or technological dimension\' with new
adaptive strategies that display 'characteristic techniques,
instrumentalities and mechanisms through which such practices operate,
by which they attempt to realize their goals, and through which they
have a range of effects\']{.underline} (Dean, 1999, p. 21).

[Seeing insurrectionality as a tactical move for the defense of fluid,
global and unstable public order follows from Foucault\'s vision of the
apparatuses of government]{.underline}. The problematization of
insurrectionable developments as constructive moments of collective
purpose seconds his sense of the world today, namely,

 ... not that everything is bad, but that everything is dangerous, which
is not exactly the same as bad. If everything is dangerous, then we
always have something to do. So my position leads not to apathy but to
hyper- and pessimistic activism. (Foucault, 1997, p. 256)

[The division of social forces into 'insurrectionists\' that are
continuously tracked by 'anti-insurrectionist\' security assessment
experts]{.underline}, working as 'threat assessment teams\' to assay
'teeming assessable threats\' confirms this consciousness of everything
merely being dangerous, and thereby producing a fluid new social order
out of constant flexible imperatives that assure all they will have
'something to do\'. Strangely, 'endangerment\' becomes a new operational
baseline assumption for making the advances of 'development\'.

[Are these strategies leading to more secure order]{.underline}, [or
only securitizing everyday life to accustom citizens to living on the
minimal basis they appear to accept]{.underline}? [They are unruly wards
protected by quasi-police state power, who permit the public to protest
the conditions of their confinement in advocacy networks within and
across borders, but always remain at the mercy of the same resilient
power practitioners]{.underline} (Keck & Sikkink, 1998). Ironically,
[[insurrectional]{.mark}ity serves multiple purposes]{.underline}; but,
[most importantly, its [practices]{.mark} **[sustain resilient state
networks for ruling]{.mark} [elites]{.mark}**, and **[this link
cultivates the expected outcomes]{.mark}**]{.underline}[---**[a barely
passable life for the]{.underline}**]{.mark} [[**masses trapped in
shells of passivity**, **dependency**, and **inaction**]{.mark} that
remarkably are [regarded]{.mark} by far too many citizens, clients or
consumers [as the]{.mark}]{.underline} [[freedoms of insurrectional

Macroeconomic theoretical formulations which attempt to explain the role
of military expenditures in the postwar American Economy have, for the
most part, relied heavily upon the model of capitalism generated by John
Maynard Keynes in The General Theory of Employment, Interest, and Money.
[The problem of modern capitalism]{.underline}, Keynes argued, [is that
it often fails to generate enough aggregate demand to achieve
full-employment]{.underline}. While Keynes treated one component of
aggregate demand, consumption, as reasonably stable, he felt that the
other major component, investment demand, was highly unstable. If
investment demand failed to grow at a rate which was sufficient to
achieve full-employment, then the economy could move in a cumulative
downward spiral. [[Chronic depression]{.mark} or low level stagnation
[could be the long run state of capitalism]{.mark}.]{.underline} This
situation could come about if there was an insufficient reason to
invest. Why invest? To make a profit[. But, the profit making potential
of a given investment would depend upon the nature of the demand for the
enduse product of the investment.]{.underline} Unfortunately, such
demands were limited in both a natural sense, - thus Keynes' famous
comment: &dquo;Two pyramids, two masses for the dead, are twice as good
as one; but not so two railways from London to York&dquo;. \[11\] - and
in an unnatural sense, - [the highly unequal distribution of income
under capitalism makes it impossible for many to realize through the
market-place their real economic demands.]{.underline} Because of this,
there are only so many profitable investments that can be made at any
point in time. Further profitable investments depend upon a
will-o'-the-wisp known as innovation. If new ideas are contrived and
adapted to the market-place, and if people want or can be made to want a
particular product, then all will be well, for a while. Keynes argued
that all would not always be well, and that it was folly to 'let nature
take its course,' particularly since it might well be thought natural,
since people naturally desire to eat, to abandon an economic system
which would generate depressions of indefinite length. Keynes' wellknown
solution was to increase the demands made upon the economic system by
government. Such demands were to 'prime-the-pump' through production
that would use resources, generate demands and profits, but not encroach
upon that area of production where capitalists had been or might be able
to make profits. Unfortunately, Keynes' view of the nature of the
'government,' or 'State' was extremely unsophisticated. \... he thought
he could separate the parasitic elements of capitalism from capitalism
itself in order to save the lifeblood of the system from exhaustion. One
hardly needs to add that when he spoke of the role of State policy, he
conceived of the State as an institution which not only stands above
classes, but stands also above the warring interests of particular
monopoly-groups; as an impartial institution which can represent the
'general interest of society as a whole' and hence steer capitalism in
the social interest.\[12\] [The nature of the 'State' is such that [the
'State' is quite far from representing the general interest of society
as a whole]{.mark}.]{.underline} Throughout the 1930s, for example,
capitalists bitterly resisted any attempts to sustain aggregate demand
through social spending schemes. A few reforms which in the end have
stabilized the social system and sustained production without
interfering with wage rates in the labor market, such as 'welfare' for
those who are clearly incapable of engaging in the labor market, and
Social Security, have been accepted by corporate leaders. The economic
growth generated by military expenditures during World War II nicely
solved the 'either-or' dilemma of stagnation or social reform which
corporate leaders had feared - throughout the 1930s. After World War II
the Cold War became the ideological lever which pried loose ( public
monies in amounts sufficient enough to solve the problem which Keynes
had explained so B eloquently. [This is not to argue that a
Machiavellian group of corporate leaders thought up the Cold War and its
accoutrements, but rather that [the forces and interests of the entire
social system;]{.mark} the interests in Central European markets, the
interest in maintaining Europe itself in the capitalist sphere, the
interest in moving into the international markets which the French,
British, Germans, and Japanese had abandoned, and the need to stabilize
the postwar economy as the 'pent-up' demands of the war period were met,
[all culminated in a move toward military expenditures as a device to
insure worldwide hegemony]{.mark} and maintain production at a tolerable
level.]{.underline} \-- **[[Military expenditures]{.mark}, then, [meet
all the requirements for the Keynesian solution given the parameters of
the social system]{.mark}.]{.underline}** First, no private capitalist
markets are encroached upon - quite the reverse is the case. Second,
military expenditures are at least 'neutral' with respect to the
distribution of socio-economic power.\[13\] Third, there is no increase
in productive capacity which will add to conventional domestic market
supply[. In fact, weapons cannot be over-supplied as there is no
definition of excess supply. [Weapons can be]{.mark} declared obsolete
and [scrapped,]{.mark} thereby [creating a need for new weapons
systems]{.mark}]{.underline}. Fourth, by increas- , ing the government
sector and working through the B 'balanced budget multiplier effect'
Keynes' anticipation of stagnation is forestalled. Finally, military
expenditures can be used as a counter-cyclical de- vice at the same time
that they basically function as an anti-stagnation device. [The
[military budget can be juggled to fit the need]{.mark}. Missile systems
can be left half-built (and this has happened with billions of dollars
worth of 'systems'), or continued - such flexibility cannot be built
into school or dam building programs, much less aid to the
handicapped.]{.underline} Why, if Keynesian theory points to the need
for an enlarged, flexible government sector which has been so adequately
fulfilled through the dependency upon military expenditures, have there
been any irregularities whatsoever in postwar economic growth? First,
time was a necessary ingredient in constructing such a colossal control
factor. Thus, in the early postwar period, particularly from 1948
through 1952[, military expenditures were not successfully integrated
with the needs of the economic system]{.underline}. Second, the
macroeconomic system consists of an incredible number of
interrelationships. It is simply not possible with any great degree of
precision to estimate the magnitude of movements within the economy. [In
terms of interrelating military expenditures with the future needs of
the economic system it is necessary to attempt to predicts
expectations - a near impossible task. In / addition, there are
international factors that must be considered but rarely can be
controlled.]{.underline} Furthermore, there are dynamic destabilizing
and stabilizing movements taking place throughout the economy
simultaneously. It is difficult, particularly when it becomes necessary
to anticipate the rate of change of these dynamic actions, to anticipate
the effects of the dynamics of the economic system. In addition, there
are information lags and lags before actions can take place. Thus, as
Bill Warren has argued, [capitalist planning is limited primarily to
controlling the direction of the economy through the utilization of
contractionary or expansionary instruments of 'State'
power.]{.underline} Any number of disequilibria remain in capitalist
economies which, singly or in combination, can in principle easily
initiate a downswing. No system of capitalist planing yet devised has
eliminated such imbalances. But , the crucial problem is the reaction of
the economy as a whole to the initiating disturbance, and it is at this
point that the role of State policy has been decisive. [The
determination of post-war capitalist States to prevent various
recessions becoming catastrophic has not only limited the depth of such
recessions as have occurred, but has had the vital effect of creating
confidence in business circles that full employment policies with their
high levels, will be restored. This has in turn ensured that investment
levels have been maintained and/or raised despite limited and temporary
setbacks.]{.underline} This stimlating effect on business expectations
and expenditures, accompanied by similar effects on private consumption,
has been a powerful expansionary force, the very existence of which
lessens the need for government action to raise employment levels.
Provided investment rates are maintained and real wages rise pari passu
with increasing productivity, there is no reason to envisage a
stagnationist, under-consumptionist view of the prospects for capitalism
; and these are precisely what the capitalist state plus the trade
unions have jointly achieved.\[14\] Third, there is no unanimity as to
the 'best' level of macroeconomic performance amongst corporate leaders.
The 'liberal' corporate leaders generally prefer a more activist stance
in foreign affairs, and a more dynamic economy. They are generally
willing to trade price stability for economic growth (if they can). On
the other hand, the 'conservative' corporate leaders are more committed
to 'sound finance' and the 'sound dollar'. [High employment means rising
prices and wages, as well as some dynamic instability in the corporate
structure which might work to the disadvantage of entrenched corporate
wealth.]{.underline}\[15\] Total stability is an objective of most
Keynesian economists, but it is not a shared value amongst those who
make policy decisions. M. Kalecki noted, in 1943, that there was a
decided lack of commitment to conventional Keynesian values on the part
of corporate leaders. Moderate cycles were preferred, for the most part,
to maintaining full-employment. A business cycle, then, can be induced
by those who feel that is what the 1 system needs. Thus, the 'political
business cycle: ' This state of affairs is perhaps symptomatic of the
future economic regime of capitalist democracies. In the slump, either
under the pressure of the masses, or even without it, public investment
financed by borrowing will be undertaken to prevent large-scale unem-
ployment. But if attempts are made to apply this method in order to
maintain the high level of employment reached in the subsequent boom a
strong opposition of 'business leaders' is likely to be encountered. As
has already been argued, lasting full employment is not at all to their
liking. The workers would 'get out of hand' and the 'captains of
industry' would be anxious to 'teach them a lesson'. Moreover, the price
increase in the upswing is to the disadvantage of small and big rentiers
and makes them 'boom tired'.\[16\] Kalecki argued that corporate leaders
would see to it that only a 'reasonable' amount of macro stability was
ensured[. They would accept four basic forms of economic stimulus from
the State in order to avert an extreme depression: (1) Tax cuts; (2)
Lower interest rates; (3) Subsidization of investment, and (4) Increases
in armaments expenditures. In the postwar era in the U.S., corporate
leaders have been able to obtain all four of these through the military
program, at one time or another]{.underline} (progress payments which
eliminate the necessity to borrow in order to complete a contract, quick
depreciation schemes for 'defense related' investments in the 1950s, and
virtually ever-growing armaments programs). Therefore, Kalecki argued,
[the [postwar period]{.mark} would be [dominated by the 'political
business cycle']{.mark}: The regime of the 'political business cycle'
would be an artificial restoration of the position as it existed in
nineteenth-century capitalism]{.underline}. Full employment would be
reached only at the top of the boom, but slumps would be relatively mild
and short lived.\[17\] Something not unlike the 'political business
cycle' seems to explain the poor performance of the economy through
1960, and from 1969 through 1971. There was an obvious lack of
commitment to the concept of full-employment during these years. During
the late 1950s military expenditures were kept large in order to offset
stagnation tendencies, and they were employed counter-cyclically, but
not at levels which would have been adequate to achieve full-employment
growth - i.e., 'potential growth' of perhaps 4 percent per year. On the
other hand, Kennedy, and the corporate leaders he interacted with, were
committed to a 'get-the-countrymoving-again' view. As a consequence,
military expenditures and other forms of government stimulus were
employed in the 1960s to keep the growth rate high. Nixon publically
stated that he wanted to induce a recession in 1969, and in fiscal year
1970 military expenditures were reduced by \$1.8 billion. In fiscal year
1971 military expenditures were still not up to the 1969 level, and
military expenditures as a percent of GNP had fallen from 12.6 percent
in 1969 to 11.1 percent in 1971.

The Marxist perspectives on ME (military spending) and capitalism
present separate arguments that can be critiqued and to a considerable
degree dismissed. None are adequate alone and no com- bination yields a
satisfactory analysis. There are certain vague points of commonality
bet- ween these perspectives, but the most glaring commonality and, in
fact, the devastating weakness is their inability to place ME within the
context of a theory of the State. Other Marxists and the
Instrumentalists have made great strides in recent years in developing a
theory of the State \[11\]. None of the theories, unfortunately (and
surprisingly) treats the questions of ME in any depth - most ignore the
issue. Of all the theories, that which is most promising, in terms of ME
in particular, is a contemporary version of State Monopoly Capitalism or
Stamocap advanced by Ben Fine, Lawrence Harris and (less explicitly) Bob
Jessop.3 Unlike the stagnationist NM (Neo-Marxists), their version of
Stamocap asserts that the capitalist mode of production is one that has
as its dominant tendency the \"self-expansion of value,\" i.e. the
system is driven by expansionary forces. But Stamocap recognizes, as do
the NM, that monopoly capitalism short-circuits the feedback mechanism
whereby profits are \"automatically\" reinvested in capital
accumulation. Thus there is a tension between the monopoly sector and
the \"capital-logic\" of the system. Left to its own devices monopoly
capitalism leads inexorably to 1929. But at the level of the capitalist
mode of production a systemic solution is demanded. Internal to the
system - although external to the monopoly sector - is the need for a
counteracting tendency. The State, then, arises out of the ashes of the
depression and WWII not as an extension of Adam Smith\'s watchman State,
but as a State that is an integrated part of the entire capital
accumulation process. Thus the State is involved internally within the
sphere of exchange, and the sphere of distribution, but more crucially
for the argument here, the State is involved within the sphere of
production - as an integral part of production. From this perspective
the func- tion of the State is not simply or primarily to create waste
(although this may be done under certain historical circumstances) but
rather to create and continually recreate the necessary conditions for
the \"self -expansion\" of capital. [Regarding ME (military spending)
the State is involved in underwriting advanced technology both because
monopoly capital tends to underinvest and because many modern
technologies are beyond the funding capacities and/or too risky for even
the largest capitals (commercial satellites, the space shuttle, etc.).
[Arms contracting]{.mark}, then, [becomes a way of socializing the costs
of technical change]{.mark} which [leads to]{.mark} further [expanded
reproduction and,]{.mark} due to productivity increases, [wage increases
as well]{.mark}. A further advantage is that ME does not have to be
justified once it becomes part of the social fabric and therefore ME can
be mov- ed at will to counter business cycle tendencies. [ME]{.mark} (at
least in the U.S. case) [was the great Accumulator of late capitalism,
and the great Legitimator]{.mark} within the nation state [in the
postwar period]{.mark} (1948-1970). Beyond the nation-state the military
apparatus was and is used to gain access to raw materials and markets on
favorable terms from the Third World. [ME]{.mark} could also be
[used]{.mark} in a Keynesian fashion (spend in order to tax while
leaving a positive margin of accumulation) [to reconstruct Western
Europe and Japan]{.mark} thereby [rais- ing overall trade and]{.mark}
[enhancing]{.mark} the [possibilities of accumulation while underwriting
legitimation]{.mark} outlays [in]{.mark} these [advanced capitalist
nations.]{.mark}]{.underline} As a careful study of the postwar long
boom would indicate, military Keynesianism \"worked,\" but only under
cer- tain historical conditions. The NM have failed to qualify and limit
their analysis of military Keynesianism to specific conjunctural
conditions. CM, meanwhile, have spent more time denying the possibility
of the Keynesian policies fostering accumulation than they have trying
to understand how military Keynesianism functioned in the long expan-
sionary period. As is now obvious, the perpetual-motion machine of
Stamocap has now been exploded from within and without. From within
starting in the 1960s there was a noticeable falling- off of major
technical innovations \[26,-185-92\]. That may have been due to the fact
that while Stamocap combined the State with monopoly capital it did so
in a manner that left a degree of autonomy both to the supercorporations
and the State. In the 1960s strategic planners in the State became
preoccupied with advanced missile technologies that pro- duced
relatively few spin-offs into the sphere of production. (Meanwhile other
forms of state investments such as infrastructure failed to grow at
previous rates.) Two other equal- ly important elements precipitated the
as yet unresolved crisis that began in 1968-69. The State managers
entered into a crisis of the State and subsequently a crisis of social
relations due to their single-minded and elusive pursuit of victory in
Vietnam. Meanwhile, the hegemonic relationship that the U.S. maintained
over the advanced capitalist nations degenerated into rivalry as
signaled by the fall of the Bretton Woods system. [A fourth precipitator
is to be found in the productive forces brought to life during the
postwar boom in the Newly Industrializing Countries. The postwar
technologies allowed many corporations to produce, manufacture and
distribute on a world level. Capital became mobile and headed to cheap
labor havens.]{.underline} On the world market this created
overproduction/overaccumulation tendencies. Today the advanced
capitalist nations are burdened by three forces that have slowed to a
crawl the accumulation of capital: (1) stagnation in investment because
of a slowdown in the diffusion (if not in fact the creation) of
exploitable technologies, (2) stagnation in investment because the old
technologies of the third technological revolution (petrochemicals,
plastics, synthetics, telecommunica- tions, advanced and consumer
electronics, etc.) have been exported into the newly in- dustrialized
countries of the \"Third World\" and their ability to cut labor costs
makes fur- ther investments in the old technologies unprofitable in the
advanced capitalist nations, (3) excess capacity in the industrial
sectors of all advanced capitalist nations. Although the question of the
multiple sources of the current crisis cannot be detailed here it is
clear that there can be no \"theory\" of ME and capitalism that is
unrelated to the conjunctural moment as the system moves through the
long cycle of growth/barrier(crisis), reconstitution/growth. Therefore,
forms of analysis that explained phenomena in the postwar period, such
as military Keynesianism may fail to do so in the crisis-reconstitution
period. In the late 1960s and into the 1970s the OCC (expressed as the
value composition of capital) rose and the profit rate fell not only in
the U.S. but across the advanced capitalist nations \[3;21,57\]. To date
(1985) only the U.S. has partially recovered from the effects that
became manifest in the late 1960s (Japan\'s recovery is beyond the scope
of this paper). It is within the context of the breakdown of Stamocap
regulation that the rise of Reaganism must be located. In part,
Reaganism seeks to raise the profit rate by lowering the wage rate, but
that raises the specter of underconsumption. Reaganism also represents a
profound shift away from military Keynesianism (with its considerable
em- phasis on full-employment legitimation) to Functional Militarism
(which single-mindedly concentrates on national and international forms
of accumulation and upward redistribu- tion of income). [The \"capital
logic\" of Reaganism is to be found primarily in his \"Rearm- ing
America\" program where through 1984 ME was inordinately concentrated in
conven- tional weapons and precision-guided weapons that had the virtue,
from the perspective of \"capital-logic\" of picking-up the slack in the
old industries of the second technological revolution (oil, steel,
autos, machine-tools) as well as the output of industries arising from
the third technological revolution \[7; 10\].]{.underline} The impact,
however, has been greatest in terms of the sphere of distribution and
exchange. Very little new investment (aside from ra- tionalization
investments in autos and steel and sheer financial speculation) has
occurred. Another element of \"capital-logic\" in relation to ME in
recent years is the U.S. offensive against the \"Third World.\"
[Although the Newly Industrializing Countries have not been set-back too
far by this policy as yet, outlays on the rapid deployment force,
paramilitary forces, new bases, etc. may be understood as an effort to
maintain and expand the range of unequal exchange with the \"Third
World\" thereby raising the profit rate (and facilitating capital
accumulation).]{.underline} A third element, which as yet has defied
quantitative or qualitative measurement, is the attempt by the
Department of Defense to foster a sweeping reorganization of U.S. in-
dustrial production by way of the MANTECH (manufacturing technology)
program and related programs \[11. These broad programs (which cannot be
discussed here) would sug- gest that a Japanese style MITI may be U.S.
Stamocap\'s response to intensified interna- tional rivalry. While
future empirical work on the relationship between ME and Capitalism will
be forced to take into account the shift in State policies from military
Keynesianism to Func- tional Militarism a note of caution is necessary[.
Functional Militarism remains very much a policy-in-the-making while
powerful fractions of capital (and society at large) retain strong
material interests in military Keynesianism.]{.underline} Buffeted by
the forces unleashed by the increasing tendency toward the
internationalization of capital, nation-based Stamocap is undergoing
crucial metamorphoses. Rather than searching for a constant relationship
between ME and Capitalism, it is to be hoped that critical analysts
will, in the present conjuncture, turn their attention to the role of
the State within the context of economie crisis and the new role of ME
within State policy. Understanding the contribu- tions and detours of
the past is one (necessary) way of moving forward in this difficult
area.

## Sustainability 

### Growth Sustainable

#### No limits to growth - their models ignore feedback effects. 

**Lynch 16** (Michael, President of Strategic Energy and Economic
Consulting, Director of Asian Energy and Security at the Center for
International Studies at MIT, and a Lecturer at Tufts and Vienna
University. The "peak oil" scare and the coming oil flood. 63-74.)

More recently, [there has been a clamor about \"peak everything\" based
on the idea that, well, everything is finite and we \'re using it up, so
it is \"running out.\"]{.underline} Or at least, production must peak.
Or, as one physicist \[END OF PAGE 63\] points out, eventually human
energy production will generate as much heat as the sun does-eventually
being 1400 years.

Flat Earth

Colin Campbell, in the famed (well, famous in the IEA\'s offices) debate
at the IEA in 1997, compared resource optimists to the conservative
Spanish court that opposed the visionary, Columbus, and has since
referred to those, like Adelman and me, who disagreed with him as
\"flat-earth economists.\" Albert Bartlett later explained that the term
actually meant that economists thought the earth had two dimensions and
thus was infinite, containing equivalently infinite resources.

But [this description **ignores** two important variables: **capital and
knowledge**]{.underline}. [Additional investment can often increase the
production of renewables like agricultural products and nonrenewables
like minerals and oil in the same amount of space, as can **better
tech**]{.underline}nology. [Neo-Malthusians]{.underline} tend to
**[ignore this factor]{.underline}** and argue that the rate of
technological advance (and greater scientific knowledge) has diminished
or disappeared, as described in Chapter 7.

The argument is somewhat specious and relies in part the question of the
finiteness of resources, discussed earlier-or a static measure of
resources and dynamic view of consumption, as in The Limits to Growth.

HOW LONG?

Perhaps the most important factor that raises skepticism is the fact
that at least some [exponential alarmists fear the distant
future]{.underline}. Any number of pundits have looked at long-term
forecasts of economic and/or technological development and characterized
them as foolish. We have no flying cars, nuclear power is not too cheap
to meter, and no one is eating Soylent Green. On the other hand, [most
of these **were not serious forecasting efforts**, but rather
**off-the-cuff remarks**]{.underline} (or the equivalent), [and those
making them were not particularly serious about achieving them within a
specific time frame]{.underline}. And we do eat Soylent Green already;
only we call it tofu and vegemite. (Read the book, it wasn\'t people.)

NEWTON\'S FIRST LAW

[The biggest mistakes]{.underline} have [come from]{.underline} an
apparent source: [**extrapolation** of a trend **endlessly**, as if
there were no feedback or other variables]{.underline} \[END PAGE 64\]
[involved]{.underline}. Jay Forrester, the inventor of Systems Dynamics,
which was used in The Limits to Growth model (and which I have used),
reportedly once said that **[feedback effects]{.underline}** tend to
[**overwhelm** the initial stimuli]{.underline}, which is probably true
in many cases. [Yet]{.underline}, many neo[-Malthusians]{.underline} and
especially peak oil advocates tend to [extrapolate a given trend
endlessly, assuming no feedback effect whatsoever]{.underline}.

Indeed, the first wave of peak oil advocates explicitly argued that no
feedback effect would occur: prices didn\'t affect production or
consumption levels. Technological advances were either unimportant or
had ceased and so could not increase the resource base.

[An **important element** of the fear of exponential growth is the
analysts\' choice of **particularly high** growth rates]{.underline}. As
Figure 4.1 showed, [Ehrlich chose the **highest observed** growth in the
20th century for his calculations, even though it represented the
post-World War II **baby boom** and should have been considered **an
exception**]{.underline}, not the norm. [Similarly,
Bartlett]{.underline}, writing in 1998, [talks about the growth in oil
demand]{.underline} from the 1950s and 1960s [at 7 \[percent\] a
year]{.underline}, which causes a doubling of use every decade, 25
[which sounds alarming]{.underline}, given the arguments about the
difficulty of making a speedy energy transition, [until you realize that
consumption growth dropped to 3% per year in the]{.underline}
19[70s]{.underline} (a doubling time of 24 years), [and]{.underline}
under [**1 \[percent\] per year** in the]{.underline}
19[80s]{.underline} (a doubling period of 75 years), before recovering
to 1.5% in the seven years before his talk (48 years).¶ [This emphasizes
the lack of feedback mechanism used in these simplistic models and how
important they are in the real world]{.underline}.

REAL SCARCITY

Indeed, [the subtext of the fear of resource scarcity is that renewable
resources have repeatedly been the source of problems]{.underline}. In
**[Tainter]{.underline}**\'s The Collapse of Complex Societies, he
[talks about resources as causing the fall of a number of]{.underline}
(mostly) [ancient civilizations; **nearly all** suffered from problems
like **lengthy droughts** and **salt buildup** in irrigated
farmland]{.underline}. 26¶ And similar problems continue today,
especially if you consider endangered species, from rhinos to tuna. In
all cases, these are renewable resources, the very ones that are NOT
finite, that are sustainable, that we can rely on for all eternity-in
theory. [**No lasting shortage** of nonrenewable resources minerals and
energy-has occurred **since the advent of the global
economy**]{.underline}.

### AT Cap Collapsing Now

#### Cap "collapsing" doesn't mean it's gone tomorrow -- might take hundreds of years -- we need a strategy for the intermediate period

**Calhoun '16** (Craig, Director of the London School of Economics and
Political Science, "The future of capitalism," *Socio-Economic Review*,
2016, Vol. 14, No. 1)

[Does capitalism have a future?]{.underline} **[Of
course]{.underline}**, it does. But it is not necessarily pretty.
[Wealth can be generated in evermore extensive and intensive ways even
in a world full of crises]{.underline} and challenges. And because
[capitalism]{.underline} is the dominant economic system in the world,
it [could continue to contribute to climate change, conflict, inequality
and instability. **But this does not mean it will
collapse.**]{.underline} [The USSR collapsed]{.underline} as a state
[following a long period of stagnant growth and expensive arms
race.]{.underline} **[This was]{.underline}** bracing, perhaps a warning
to other states, but **[not]{.underline}** necessarily **[a model for
the end of capitalism.]{.underline}**

[Much critical engagement]{.underline} with capitalism [has focused
on]{.underline} its internal [contradictions and potential
collapse.]{.underline} [Contradictions are real]{.underline} and
collapse is possible, [but **the language is misleading.**]{.underline}
We speak of the [collapse of the Roman Empire]{.underline}, but this
[took 300 years of decline]{.underline}, instability and conflict. We
speak of the [collapse of feudalism]{.underline}, but it would again be
more accurate to see [a long process of transformation]{.underline} as
feudal structures were less able to organize social, economic and even
military life, and less able to reproduce key elements of their power
structure while gradually states and what we now call capitalism grew.
[Capitalism]{.underline} has already proved that although it is prone to
generating crises, it is not merely a short episode between feudalism
and socialism, as the Communist Manifesto implied. It [has endured much
longer than Marx and Engels thought]{.underline}, and along with the
nation-state system dominated global geopolitics and economics for some
400 years. [It may well last much longer]{.underline}---but this
continued existence could be marked by both growing systemic diffi-
culties internal to capitalism and upheavals beyond capitalism that are
exacerbated by it and pose challenges to it.

[Capitalism is more than just markets or economics]{.underline} in
general. [It is a system of production based on ever more intensive
deployment of capital and pursuit of productivity]{.underline} (and
profit)--- and hence a driver of both expansion and technological and
organizational innovation. It is a system of relations between states
and other economic actors in which states guarantee forms of property,
security of contract and regimes of accumulation. Together these make it
a system that drives not only expansion, but also accumulation and
concentration of capital.

**[But capitalism is not always the same.]{.underline}** In the first
place, [it always exists in social and political contexts]{.underline},
not in a 'pure', abstract form. In the real world, [capitalism is always
shaped by state support, regulation and mediation of
conflicts]{.underline}; states may carry the costs of capitalism's
negative externalities. In addition, capitalism's internal character
varies. Of most immediate importance, since the 1970s, capitalism has
seen a dramatic ascendancy of both finance and service work. Industry
has not disappeared any more than land lost all value during the
industrial revolution. But where perhaps a quarter of capital was held
in the form of financial assets 40 years ago, the figure now is about
three-quarters. There has been similar proportionate growth in service
employment. [There may yet be a productivity revolution in service
work]{.underline}--- though in what proportion that will bring freedom
and opportunity ( probably only for an elite) or only low wages and
unemployment (for the rest of us) remains to be seen. The claim that we
are moving into a 'sharing economy' points to some new developments, but
fails to address basic structural dimensions of capitalism.

To be sure, there is also variation in the forms of enterprise. The
development, expansion and international spread of corporations have
been remarkable innovations. Corporations may be organized through legal
fictions---as artificial persons 'without a soul to damn or body to
kick'---but also as basic social institutions. Firms are almost as
important as states. So ubiquitous are corporations (even though legal
regimes vary) that it is now hard to recall capitalism before corporate
capitalism. More recently, however, corporations have themselves have
become commodities bought and sold. From IPOs to mergers and
acquisitions, this has enriched financial institutions. It has also made
both capital markets and labour markets less stable. And it has brought
a real cost in social solidarity. This is shaped by a decline in
longterm employment, undermining of ties between firms and their
localities, and financial pressures---ever more intensive and
short-term---against the provision of health care, pension and other
benefits to employees.

Likewise, capitalism in any one time or place may be shaped more or less
by entrepreneurs and the formation of new enterprises. Entrepreneurs
were crucial to the rise of merchant capitalism and in the industrial
revolution. They were important in the 'gilded age', not just among the
robber barons but also in launching a host of family businesses. And
entrepreneurs played a central role in the rise of new industries in the
last 40 years. There should be appreciation for the creative,
enterprising spirit of entrepreneurs. But we should not be blinded by
either the hagiography of individuals or the celebration of
entrepreneurship in general to think that entrepreneurial successes are
quite as individualistic as the ideology suggests. Entrepreneurs depend
on social networks and whole ecologies of support from universities to
venture capitalists. Much of the achievement of technology firms in the
last 40 years has been grounded in commercializing scientific advances
that were funded by governments during the cold war---and then, quite
remarkably, made publicly available with no claim to property rights by
the government on behalf of citizens.

The term entrepreneur can be used so elastically as to encompass both
those acquiring great fortunes by building companies in Silicon Valley
and those working at a near subsistence level as contractors in new
service economy businesses---like drivers organized through online
booking agencies. Typically paid a fee for each service, these are
entrepreneurs only in the same sense that 'independent' knitters and
weavers were during the industrial revolution. As mechanization of
spinning and expansion of markets drove up demand, knitters set up shop
in their own homes, often enlisting family members as assistants. They
provided their own equipment, sometimes bought on credit, including
knitting frames (machines that were human-powered but able to produce
much more than simple handwork). They sold their work to intermediaries
who ran 'putting out' businesses, distributing thread to knitters and
collecting finished cloth. As intermediaries, these were arguably the
18th and early 19th century counterparts to Uber and other firms
organizing services through 'apps'. Framework knitting was initially a
good occupation, requiring only modest skill though intense
concentration and physical labour. But it was an easy business to enter
and knitters were eventually driven to work longer and longer hours both
to repay their capital costs and to support their families. The creators
of self-exploiting tiny businesses, more stable small businesses and
'start-ups' that might grow with venture capital and successful public
offerings are all important. However, lumping them under the single term
'entrepreneurs' can be misleading as can an overly rosy picture of the
'sharing economy'.

Not least of all, states may themselves pursue capitalist ends like
expansion of markets and accumulation of capital. They may either own
capitalist firms or actively try to manage capitalist enterprise and
finance. Even countries in which liberal capitalist separation of state
from market was celebrated have used such models. The US accomplished
projects like rural electrification partly through state-owned
enterprises and partly through preferential financing and
state-guaranteed monopolies. Railroads that were initially private
ventures were in many countries consolidated as public service
companies. Only rarely was there clarity about whether to run them as
for-profit firms (thus subsidized the state) or as services funded
partly by the state. Still, they demanded investment and generally
became more capital-intensive. More strikingly, the Soviet Union was
arguably as much an example of state capitalism as of socialism. And
today, China is arguably the model for a capitalist future in which the
boundary between state and economy is not celebrated---as it has been in
the ideology of liberal capitalism. State-related enterprises and direct
state organization of finance may be as basic to the near-term future of
capitalism as, say, entrepreneurs.

**[Still, capitalism works.]{.underline}** Certainly it only works more
or less, and [not always as well]{.underline} or in the ways [we might
wish.]{.underline} But it works well enough that **[it need not reach an
end at any specific point.]{.underline}** It is a good bet that **[it
will still dominate global economics tomorrow, next year, and when the
next crisis comes.]{.underline}** But, capitalism is not an order of
nature. It is a humanly created historical system. So, **[it will
change.]{.underline}** It will likely end, change beyond recognition or
continue to exist. It will almost certainly lose its capacity to
dominate.

Capitalism is good at some things, not others, and actively bad at some.
[It is good at creating wealth and driving innovatio]{.underline}n,
indeed extraordinarily good. Even Marx and Engels praised capitalism for
this (though they thought it was important at some point to say 'we have
enough, let's concentrate on how wealth is shared'). Capitalism's
capacity to create wealth is why less developed countries are betting on
it today. [But]{.underline} by comparison, capitalism is [bad at
equitable distribution.]{.underline} It is not necessarily worse than
all other systems: feudalism and slave societies are hardly models of
equitable distribution of wealth. But arguably because capitalism
depends on consumer markets it needs distribution of wealth to survive.
It thus operates in an uneasy (or outright denied) collusion with trade
unions and other mechanisms that increase returns to labour and with
states that ensure some levels of distribution of wealth. High
employment industries may make distribution of wealth (and thus funding
of consumer markets) easier; the erosion of industrial employment makes
this harder, at least temporarily.

Of course, capitalism's extraordinary ability to generate wealth is not
counterbalanced only by problems of distribution. Capitalism also
produces the opposite of wealth---which is not poverty but what John
Ruskin called 'illth'. Illth is bad stuff: accumulation of waste,
pollution of air and water and even climate change offer good examples.
But so do erosions of social solidarity and mutual support systems.
[States often step in to deal with illth and other negative
externalities of capitalism.]{.underline} This is what Karl Polanyi
analysed as the 'double-movement' of capitalism that led to the rise of
the welfare-state. There are also market-based solutions, however, like
insurance companies. And philanthropy is also sometimes important,
channelling privately accumulated capital to public purposes. But one
way or another, illth and negative externalities demand attention.

So, what challenges capitalism now?

[There is still risk]{.underline}---indeed high probability---[of
systemic financial crises.]{.underline} Addicted to finance and growth,
the world continues to hope that the source of so much recent upheaval
can become the source of salvation from it. The dominance of finance in
contemporary capitalism ties every country into a global system that has
risks built into its very architecture.

Some apparent solutions---like the spreading of risk through markets for
derivatives---create new and intensified risks. So far, 'financial
engineering' has helped create great fortunes but it has not produced
the equivalent of bridges that do not collapse. And when financial
crises have come, the prevailing pattern of response is to turn private
problems into public ones--- for example by nationalizing the toxic
assets of failing banks. And yet we do not know what to do except
invest.

Risk can be mitigated, though this depends on both good analyses and
organizational will. Financial markets, instruments and contractual
agreements are extraordinarily complex. Unfortunately, the financial
system is poorly understood even though it is the product and object of
brilliant research. This reflects not just complexity, but the extent to
which the study of finance is bound up with the production of 'financial
engineering' products that can actually work in practice. For example,
unrealistic assumptions like unlimited liquidity are embedded into
algorithms that price derivatives (and indeed to some extent organize
derivatives markets). This is not an error; it is a way of accomplishing
effective pricing---except in those times where liquidity limits do
become significant, in which cases the system is prone to crisis.

Both the complexity of the global financial system and its systemic risk
are increased by organizational factors. The system is not the product
of some moment of rational planning. It grew by accretion and
incremental if rapid change. Different actors set out to solve different
problems: expanding mortgage availability to expand home ownership, for
example, or attracting funding to new business ventures, or building
transportation and communication infrastructures. These are organized
through different firms and government agencies. There is innovation in
law (derivatives are contracts) as well as in finance per se, so
different professions are involved with their different perspectives.
The development of regulation usually lags, but so does the development
of organizational competence even in private firms. Senior executives
may not have full understanding of what subordinates---say traders---are
doing and how it creates risks. 'Silos' separate different functions
within firms, for example, and give different knowledge and incentives
to traders, risk officers and general managers.

The risk is also exacerbated when international regulation and risk
management is weak. This can also be a problem of inadequate
understanding (and inadequate access to information, which is largely in
the hands of firms with proprietary interests in it). But there is a
deeper problem. International cooperation is weak on a number of
different dimensions and policy areas, even while it is as crucial as
ever. The financial crisis showed how difficult it was to generate
effective cooperation for changes to financial processes, not just at
the global level but even within Europe---which found its institutions
unexpectedly inadequate even after decades of development. The Bretton
Woods institutions face new challenges, including a proliferation of
alternative mediators of global finance from the BRICs bank to the Asian
Infrastructure Investment Bank led by China and the US development of
alternative regional trade agreements. But insufficient international
cooperation in finance is mirrored by weaknesses in other areas: refugee
and security policies are notable examples at the moment. In any case,
difficulty organizing effective and efficient regulation and support
institutions for global finance multiplies risks. But the risks do not
just concern financial collapse. They concern the possibility that no
solutions will be found to paying for the costs externalized by
capitalist firms.

Another challenge for capitalism, also made evident in the financial
crisis, is the huge scale of what we might call 'unofficial capitalism'.
This is wealth and flows of wealth that are unrecorded or incompletely
recorded, and perhaps more importantly unregulated or ineffectively
regulated. Some of this derives from organized crime, including
trafficking in drugs, arms and people. But some of it derives simply
from tax evasion. Whatever the provenance of illicit capital, it amounts
to trillions of euros trading in dark or at least obscure markets, and
sometimes mingling with more legitimate capitalism in destabilizing
ways. The flow of Russian money into Cyprus before the crisis of
2012--2013 was an example. Of course, unofficial economic activity
helped many people survived financial crisis and austerity policies.
There are relatively benign, small-scale forms of off-the-books
enterprise in certain businesses and 'alternative economies'. Even
these, however, deprive states of revenues that could be used to finance
social expenditure. The impact of large-scale illicit capitalism is much
greater.

Diversion of funds into illicit capitalism and weak international
cooperation are both factors in widespread destruction of the political
and social conditions for capitalism. Even more basically, this is
driven by financial capitalism itself and accompanying market
fundamentalist ideology. There has been a weakening of welfare states.
This is often a matter of explicit state policy. Privatization may be
driven by pro-market views, but also by criticism of inefficiencies in
actual bureaucracies. It is also often driven by state fiscal
challenges, which are in turn shaped by difficulty collecting taxes (not
least where it is easy for money to flow across borders). Another way of
looking at this is that it costs a lot of money to deal with
capitalism's externalities. There are the costs of coping with illth,
and there are the costs of providing education, health care,
unemployment benefits and community services that not only sustain
national populations and thus stabilize society, but also lower costs to
capitalist firms---e.g., of skilled and healthy workers.

The weakening of welfare states is only one example of much more
pervasive institutional deficits. Corporations themselves can be
important social institutions that provide their members with what
amount to welfare benefits and even some sense of community. But
long-term corporate employment and benefit structures are in decline,
subjected to shortterm financial market pressures influenced by the
ideology of 'shareholder value'. In other words, institutions of basic
social importance are being made responsive only to one class of
interests---those of investors. Assertions of value for other
stakeholders are generally less effective. Other directly economic
factors also challenge capitalism, such as unemployment, inequality and
slow (or negative) growth. These are potentially disruptive to the
capacity to realize profits, but also to social solidarity.

At the same time, **[we should not underestimate how hard people try to
make existing systems work]{.underline}**, to find their way to enough
material resources and social integration for their own lives. [They do
this in part by continuing to participate in capitalist
system.]{.underline} It is a source of frustration for many, though they
do not always identify their personal problems with this systemic
source. It also a widespread source of hope---not least in many poorer
and developing countries. People continue to seek jobs and start
businesses. And [this is a matter of emotional attachments as well as
economic practicality.]{.underline}

To those optimistic about **[revolutions]{.underline}**, I would stress
that these **[do not often turn out very well.]{.underline}** In
addition, [one distinctive feature of the recent]{.underline} and in
some ways continuing financial [crisis has been the near-absence of
anti-systemic movements.]{.underline} There have been
**[occupations]{.underline}** of public spaces, though these
**[have]{.underline}** been **[focused more on failures of
government]{.underline}** and power of global finance
**[than]{.underline}** on **[capitalism]{.underline}** as such. [There
are populists on both Left and Right, but almost no real socialist
mobilization.]{.underline} **[There are]{.underline}** remarkable
**[experiments in local-level alternative economies]{.underline}** of
barter and mutual support. **[But there are not large-scale movements
for truly transcending capitalism and replacing it]{.underline}** by an
alternative scalable economic system.

So, what could happen?

Well, yes, capitalism could collapse. If this happens, purely economic
calamity will likely be entwined with war and environmental disaster. If
any historians survive this apocalypse, they will argue over whether
capitalism caused the catastrophe, or only exacerbated other problems
like climate change failures of international cooperation or decline in
social solidarity. There could also be technological or other innovation
that reinvigorates aspects of capitalism and deals with some of its
costly externalities. Opportunities for expansion of capitalism's reach
are shrinking as it reaches the whole world. Still, there could be
indefinite continued intensification.

The liberal hope that capitalism and democracy are somehow naturally
linked is likely to be proven specious. Capitalist democracies may
persist, but more state-authoritarian versions of capitalism are at
least as likely to prosper. Global integration will not bring
homogeneity, but diversity of political, economic and social
arrangements.

**[Governments will attempt to compensate for problems created by
capitalist development.]{.underline}** This may bring aspects of
Polanyi's double movement, but probably not a renewal of the welfare
state project---and ( perhaps ironically) particularly not in democratic
states. How much states can do and how well will depend on how they are
linked in international cooperation, at regional as well as global
levels. In any case, though, it is important to look at whether
compensation for illth and positive virtues of solidarity may be
produced in other ways, including in business institutions, philanthropy
and social entrepreneurship.

**[Small achievements in mitigating problems are worth the effort and
worth cherishing.]{.underline}** But neither reducing inequality nor
stemming climate change is easy, and neither is likely without
trade-offs with freedom or growth.

**[What seems very unlikely is a pure collapse or revolutionary
transformation creating socialism.]{.underline}** [If capitalism is to
be replaced by a new dominant economic form, this is likely to come
about through a prolonged period of ambiguity]{.underline}, difficulty
[and conflict.]{.underline} [The end of capitalism may be more like the
end of the Roman Empire]{.underline} or of feudalism [than]{.underline}
like [the end of the Soviet Union.]{.underline} In this context,
creating and defending islands of civility, solidarity and relative
social justice may be a challenging but crucial project.

### 2AC -- Alt Fails

#### Anti-globalization movements are bad, especially when viewed as a form of academic radicalism.

**Lundberg 12** (Christian O., Director of Cultural Studies and
Associate Professor of Rhetoric @ UNC, Chapel Hill, *Lacan in Public:
Psychoanalysis and the Science of Rhetoric*, pp. 175-177)

The demands of student revolutionaries and antiglobalization protestors
provide a set of opportunities for interrogating hysteria as a political
practice. For the antiglobalization protestors cited earlier, [demands
to be added to a list of dangerous globophobes uncannily condense a
dynamic inherent to all demands for recognition. But]{.underline} the
[demands of the Mexico Solidarity Network and]{.underline} the [Seattle
Independent Media]{.underline} project [demand more than recognition:
they also demand danger as a specific mode of representation. "Danger"
functions as a sign of something more than inclusion, a way of
reaffirming the protestors' imaginary agency over processes of
globalization.]{.underline} If danger represents an assertion of agency,
and the assertion of agency is proportional to the deferral of desire to
the master upon whom the demand is placed, then demands to be recognized
as dangerous are doubly hysterical. Such demands are also demands for a
certain kind of love, namely, the state might extend its love by
recognizing the dangerousness of the one who makes the demand. At the
level the demand's rhetorical function, dangerousness is metonymically
connected with the idea that average citizens can effect change in the
prevailing order, or that they might be recognized as agents who, in the
instance of the list of globalophobic leaders, can command the Mexican
state to reaffirm their agency by recognizing their dangerousness. The
rhetorical structure of danger implies the continuing existence of the
state or governing apparatus's interests, and these interests become a
nodal point at which the hysterical demand is discharged. This structure
generates enjoyment of the existence of oppressive state policies as a
point for the articulation of identity. The addiction to the state and
the demands for the state's love is also bound up with a fundamental
dependency on the oppression of the state: otherwise the identity would
collapse. Such demands constitute a reaffirmation of a hysterical
subject position: they reaffirm not only the subject's marginality in
the global system but the danger that protestors present to the global
system. There are three practical implications for this formation.
First, for the hysteric the simple discharge of the demand is both the
beginning and satisfaction of the political project. Although there is
always a nascent political potential in performance, in this case the
performance of demand comes to fully eclipse the desires that animate
content of the demand. [Second, demand allows institutions that stand in
for the global order to dictate the direction of politics]{.underline}.
[This is not to say that engaging]{.underline} such [institutions
is]{.underline} a [bad]{.underline} thing; [rather]{.underline}, it is
to say that [when]{.underline} antagonistic [engagement with certain
institutions is read as the end point of politics, the field of
political options is]{.underline} relatively [constrained. Demands to be
recognized as dangerous]{.underline} by the Mexican government
[or]{.underline} as [a **powerful antiglobalization force** by the
WTO]{.underline} [often function at the cost of addressing how practices
of globalization are reaffirmed at the level of consumption, of
identity, and so on or in thinking through alternative political
strategies for engaging globalization]{.underline} that do not hinge on
the state and the state's actions. Paradoxically, [the third danger is
that]{.underline} an addiction to the [refusal]{.underline} of demands
[creates]{.underline} [a]{.underline} paralyzing disposition toward
institutional politics. Grossberg has identified a tendency in left
politics to [retreat from the "politics of policy and public
debate.]{.underline}"45 Although Grossberg identifies the problem as a
specific coordination of "theory" and its relation to left politics,
perhaps a hysterical [commitment to marginality informs the
impulse]{.underline} in some sectors [to eschew engagements with
institutions and institutional debate. An addiction to the state's
refusal often makes the perfect the enemy of the good]{.underline},
implying a stifling commitment to political purity as a pretext for
sustaining a structure of enjoyment dependent on refusal, dependent on a
kind of paternal "no." Instead of seeing institutions and policy making
as one part of the political field that might be pressured for
contingent or relative goods, a hysterical politics is in the incredibly
difficult position of taking an addressee (such as the state) that it
assumes represents the totality of the political field; simultaneously
it understands its addressee as constitutively and necessarily only a
locus of prohibition. These paradoxes become nearly insufferable when
one makes an analytical cut between the content of a demand and its
rhetorical functionality. At the level of the content of the demand,
[the state or institutions]{.underline} [that represent
globalization]{.underline} [are figured as illegitimate, as morally and
politically compromised because of their misdeeds. Here there is an
assertion of agency, but because the assertion of agency is
simultaneously a deferral of desire, the identity produced in the
hysterical demand is **not only intimately tied to** but is **ultimately
dependent on** the continuing existence of the **state, hegemonic order,
or institution**. At the level of affective investment, the state or
institution is **automatically figured as the legitimate authority**
over its domain.]{.underline} As Lacan puts it: "demand in itself . . .
is demand of a presence or of an absence . . . pregnant with that Other
to be situated within the needs that it can satisfy. [Demand constitutes
the Other as already possessing the 'privilege' of satisfying needs,
that it is to say, the power of depriving them of that alone by which
they are satisfied]{.underline}."46

the Theme Park of Radical Action? Social Movements and Political
Articulation in the Late-Modern Condition," European Journal of Social
Theory, 02/2006)

From Actor-Perspective to Systems-Perspective

[Social movements and non-conventional forms of participation are not
just what their actors (or their academic agents) describe them as and
believe them to be.]{.underline} Indeed, movement participants
themselves may be said to be particularly badly positioned to explain
why specific forms of political articulation emerge, what logic powers
them, and what kind of conditions they express. Nevertheless, [social
movement research has so far mostly taken an actor-perspective. Its
starting point has tended to be the political agenda]{.underline}
(grievances and ideals) [of the social movements]{.underline} as it has
been formulated by activists, social movement intellectuals or by
academics with political commitments to social movement ideals, who all
conceptualize social movements as rational collective actors in
strategic pursuit of shared political objectives. On this basis, [social
movement research has explored the sociological background of the
actors]{.underline}, or investigated their struc- tural opportunities,
resources, strategies of mobilization, network formation, repertoires of
action, framing processes, and so on. This perspective has been fruitful
and fully legitimate, yet [a more complex understanding of contemporary
social movements and new forms of political participation may be
achieved by looking beyond the narrative of all those taking a modernist
rational actor approach.]{.underline}

This does not simply mean to shift the focus towards the opportunity
struc- tures offered by particular political systems, or towards
available resources which movements may mobilize. Also, such a change of
perspective does not aim for a return of the older collective behaviour
approaches (Turner and Killian, 1957; Smelser, 1962) which regarded
social movements as the irrational and largely uncoordinated expression
of psychological conditions. Instead the objective is to take account of
the fact that **[irrespective of their self-description as radical and
oppositional, social movements must never be viewed as separate (apart)
from mainstream society, but as an integral part of it.]{.underline}**
[Social movements emerge, and remain tied to, what Roth]{.underline}
(1994: 271) [calls a specific 'historical terrain': their oppositional
'motives and utopias are moulded by the historical ensemble' in which
they act]{.underline}. **[Their 'self-perception as radically different
. . . is self-deceptive if it does not take into account the narrow
limits of its alternative components and the wide range of
characteristics it shares with its \[societal
environment\]'.]{.underline}** **[Social movements 'therefore, never act
outside of the imagined logic of the system']{.underline}** (Roth, 1994:
271).

[If social movements are seen as a part of, rather than distinct from,
advanced modern societies, they can be taken as indicators of society's
condition.]{.underline} [From this perspective they appear not so much
as actors pursuing specific goals but as signs that need interpreting,
as manifestations of societal circumstances that need conceptualizing.
Such an approach seems particularly appropriate for the investigation of
those social movements and post-conventional forms of political
articulation whose objectives seem vague and difficult to express --
even for the participants themselves -- although catchy campaign slogans
may be readily available.]{.underline} It takes account of the fact that
**[contemporary movements]{.underline}** including, for example, many
anti-globalization protests, the anti-war demonstrations of 2003, public
outpourings of grief after the death of celebrities, the observation of
x minutes silence in commemoration of terror victims, or waves of
philanthropic engagement after natural catastrophes **[can hardly be
described as goal-oriented strategic action, but at best as the
collective processing of helplessness]{.underline}**. **[At times, they
are little more than the expression of profound disorientation,
uncertainty and vulnerability vis-à-vis a system and condition that
trigger feelings of intense unease but do not allow these feelings to
crystallize into agendas of political action and change.]{.underline}**

## AT: Cap Bad Impacts 

### AT Automation

#### Automation impact empirically denied and overexaggerated

Matthew **Yglesias 15**, Senior Correspondent at and co-founder of Vox,
7-27-2015, \"The automation myth: Robots aren\'t taking your jobs--- and
that\'s the problem\",
https://www.vox.com/2015/7/27/9038829/automation-myth

Over the past five years, American [politics has become obsessed with
robots]{.underline}.

President Obama has warned that ATMs and airport check-in kiosks are
contributing to high unemployment. Sen. Marco Rubio said that the
central challenge of our times is \"to ensure that the rise of the
machines is not the fall of the worker.\" A cover story in the Atlantic
asked us to ponder the problems of a world without work. And in [the New
York Times]{.underline}, Barbara Ehrenrich [warns]{.underline} that
\"[the job-eating maw of technology now threatens even the nimblest and
most expensively educated]{.underline}.\"

The good news is that [**these concerns are wrong**. None of the recent
problems in the American economy are due to]{.underline} robots --- or,
to be more specific about it, due to an accelerating pace of
[automation]{.underline}. Moreover, [even if the pace of automation does
speed up in the future, there\'s no real reason to believe that it will
be a problem.]{.underline}

The bad news is that these concerns are wrong. Rather than an
accelerating pace of automation, we\'ve actually been living through a
slowdown in the pace of productivity growth. And that slowdown is a huge
problem. Unless it reverses, we\'ll be waking up soon to find ourselves
in a depressing world of longer working years, unmanageable health-care
needs, higher taxes, and a public sector starved of needed
infrastructure resources.

In other words, don\'t worry that the robots will take your job. Be
terrified that they won\'t.

The past of automation

When people hear about robots, they think of science fiction --- the
Johnny Cab taxi from Total Recall, chrome maid Rosie from The Jetsons,
or the thinking, talking computer that powers the starship Enterprise.
All this and more may come to pass some day (who knows?) but the reality
of day-to-day change is more mundane.

[Machines]{.underline} have been replacing humans for hundreds of years.
And when it happens to you, it stinks. It stank for small business
owners whose photo development shops were driven out of business by
digital cameras. It stank for analog graphic designers like my mother
who were disemployed by desktop publishing software in the late 1980s.
It stank for stevedores who were put out of work by container ships. It
stank for weavers put out of work by the spinning jenny. It stank for
railroad engineers put out of work by the automobile.

But for society as a whole, these **[were huge leaps
forward]{.underline}**. Specific individuals did in fact lose jobs and
oftentimes ended up [with]{.underline} lower wages. But on average, [job
growth continued and living standards rose.]{.underline}

The techno-pessimists often admit this. The problem, they say, is if
technology reduces the need for human labor really, really fast, then
society won\'t have time to adjust, and there will be broad
unemployment.

Well, again, [we can look to the past. Despite the cliché that
technology today is progressing faster than ever, the per-worker output
of the American economy actually increased at its fastest-ever
rate]{.underline} in the quarter century [between 1948 and
1973.]{.underline}

This is the period in which the spread of [refrigerators put milkmen out
of work]{.underline}, while the initial adoption of machines to wash
clothing and dishes rendered full-time household servants superfluous
for the middle class. This was a time when [television displaced live
theater, and]{.underline} when [truck-based delivery upended product
distribution networks]{.underline} and rendered many neighborhood
retailers obsolete. New interstates bypassed old towns and rail depots.
Automatic telephone switches put operators out of work. New fertilizer
products derived from wartime research increased per-acre crop yields
and reduced the number of laborers needed.

So what happened?

Well, [people worked less]{.underline}. In 1950 (the first year for
which we have records), the average employed person in the United States
worked about 1,909 hours. By 1973, that had fallen to 1,797 hours.
That\'s a decline of about 6 percent. It\'s the equivalent of going from
having two weeks of paid vacation per year to having five weeks. Or of
going from working 9 to 5 every day to working 9:30 to 5 every day.

[But there was **no overall collapse in employment**. The total number
of employed people grew by more than 50 percent]{.underline} during this
period, [keeping up with population growth. Wages rose
steadily]{.underline} at a pace of about 2.23 percentage points faster
than inflation in the average year.

And the growth was widely shared. There were rich people and poor
people, of course, but the share of overall national income accruing to
the very wealthy was modest and generally falling. The fast pace of
automation did not mean the only people who could get ahead were those
clever enough to invent the new machines or lucky enough to earn them.
Individual people lost out at particular moments in time, but on
average, the tide rose rapidly and lifted the vast majority of the
boats.

The big slowdown

Today it appears to most people that we are living in a period of
immense technological change. A rather small device that I carry in my
pocket replaces the telephone that used to sit in my bedroom, the
Walkman in my pocket, the TI-85 calculator in my backpack, every single
book I\'ve ever owned, the Sega Genesis on the shelf, the alarm clock on
my bedside table, and even, to some extent, my television. And yet it
doesn\'t only replicate the functions of those devices. In most cases it
far surpasses them.

But [despite the techno-hype and the national obsession with disruption,
the pace of productivity growth has slowed down. The American economy
has grown, but largely by adding workers rather than by]{.underline}
workers equipping themselves with powerful [new machines]{.underline} to
multiply their capabilities. And [the number of hours worked per worker
has stayed relatively flat]{.underline}, even while other countries have
continued to enhance their leisure.

[If robots were taking our jobs, the productivity of the workers who
still have jobs]{.underline} --- the total amount of work that gets done
divided by the total number of people who are employed --- [would be
going up rapidly. But **it\'s not**]{.underline}. It is rising, but
it\'s rising slower than it did in the past.

And the slowing rate of productivity growth is an important source of
the wage slowdown that people have been worrying about.

The 2015 Economic Report of the President calculated that if
productivity growth had continued at its 1948--1973 pace for the past 40
years, the average household\'s income would be \$30,000 higher today.
By contrast, had inequality stayed at its 1973 level for the same
period, Obama\'s Council of Economic Advisers calculates that the
average household\'s income would be only \$9,000 higher.

The productivity issue is bigger than inequality, in other words. And
yet it\'s much less discussed.

In fact, it\'s almost anti-discussed due to the obsession in media and
political circles with the alleged rise of the robots. We\'re so busy
worrying about how to counteract an imaginary, robot-driven productivity
surge that we\'re barely paying attention to the real story of the
productivity slowdown.

The Solow Paradox

But what about the bounty of digital technology that is in evidence all
around us? Almost 30 years ago, the great economist Robert Solow
quipped, \"You can see the computer age everywhere but in the
productivity statistics.\"

An answer to the riddle might be that digital technology has transformed
a handful of industries in the media/entertainment space that occupy a
mindshare that\'s out of proportion to their overall economic
importance. The [robots aren\'t taking our jobs; they\'re taking our
leisure.]{.underline}

Data from the American Time Use Survey, for example, suggests that on
average Americans spend about 23 percent of their waking hours watching
television, reading, or gaming. With Netflix, HDTV, Kindles, iPads, and
all the rest, these are certainly activities that look drastically
different in 2015 than they did in 1995 and can easily create the
impression that life has been revolutionized by digital technology.

What\'s more, the media industry itself has been turned upside down by
the internet and has spent the last decade telling anyone who will
listen how complete and wrenching the transformation has been. That
further amplifies a narrative about rapid change.

But clearly the media and entertainment industries don\'t comprise
anything close to 23 percent of the workforce or the total economic
output of the United States. Most other [job categories have been
impacted by digital technology, but only in **relatively superficial
ways**]{.underline}. Something like 9 percent of all private sector jobs
are in the food service industry. These days people are perhaps more
likely to book a reservation or order a takeout meal with an app rather
than a phone call, but the core work of serving and preparing food has
seen very little progress.

At the higher end of the salary spectrum, [we still don\'t have robot
doctors]{.underline} who can treat patients in lieu of costly and
inconvenient human ones. Indeed, we can\'t even get medical records
digitized properly.

### AT Environment 

#### Capitalism overcomes the environmental impact -- their understanding of the relationship between cap and the environment is flawed

**Harvey 14** (David Harvey, British-born Marxist political economist
and Distinguished Professor of anthropology and geography at the
Graduate Center of the City University of New York. He received his PhD
in geography from the University of Cambridge in 1961., 3-7-2014,
\"Seventeen Contradictions and the End of
Capitalism,\" <https://kehuelga.net/diario/IMG/pdf/harvey17contradictions.pdf>)
AM

[The idea that capitalism is encountering a fatal contradiction in the
form of a looming environmental crisis is]{.underline} widespread in
certain circles. I consider it [a]{.underline} plausible but
[controversial thesis. Its plausibility largely derives from the
accumulating environmental pressures arising from capital's exponential
growth. There are four main reasons to cast doubt on the
idea.]{.underline} [First, capital has a long history of successfully
resolving its ecological difficulties, no matter whether these refer to
its use of 'natural' resources, the ability to absorb pollutants or to
cope with the degradation of habitats, the loss of biodiversity, the
declining qualities of air, land and water, and the like. Past
predictions of an apocalyptic end to civilisation and capitalism as a
result of natural scarcities and disasters look foolish in retrospect.
Throughout capital's history far too many doomsayers have cried 'wolf'
too fast and too often]{.underline}. In 1798 Thomas Malthus, as we have
seen, erroneously predicted social catastrophe (spreading famine,
disease, war) as exponential population growth outran the capacity to
increase food supplies. In the 1970s Paul Ehrlich, a leading
environmentalist, argued that mass starvation was imminent by the end of
the decade, but it did not occur. He also bet the economist Julian Simon
that the price of natural resources would soon dramatically increase
because of natural scarcities: he lost the bet.1 Because such
predictions -- and there have been many of them -- turned out wrong in
the past does not guarantee, of course, that a catastrophe is not in the
making this time. But it does give strong grounds for scepticism.
[Second, the 'nature' we are supposedly exploiting and exhausting and
which then supposedly limits or even 'takes revenge' on us is actually
internalised within the circulation and accumulation of capital. The
ability of a plant to grow is incorporated, for example, into
agribusiness in its pursuit of profit and it is the reinvestment of that
profit that has the plant growing again the next year]{.underline}.
Natural features and elements are active agents at all points in the
process of capital accumulation. Money flow is an ecological variable
and the transfer of nutrients through an ecosystem may also constitute a
flow of value. While [matter]{.underline} can neither be created nor
destroyed, its [configuration can be radically altered. Genetic
engineering, the creation of new chemical compounds, to say nothing of
massive environmental modifications]{.underline} (the creation of whole
new ecosystems through urbanisation and the fixing of capital in the
farms, fields and factories on the land[), now go well beyond what has
been a long history of humanly induced environmental modifications that
have remade the earth in aggregate into a far more hospitable place for
human life and, over the last three centuries]{.underline}, for 141
profitable activity. [Many organisms actively produce a nature conducive
to their own reproduction and humans are no exception.]{.underline}
Capital, as a specific form of human activity, does the same, but
increasingly in the name of capital and not of humanity. [The
'domination of nature' thesis that has broadly held sway both in
scientific writings and in the popular imagination since the
Enlightenment]{.underline} (from the writings of Descartes onwards) [has
no place in this conceptual scheme]{.underline}. This poses some
problems for thinking through the capital-- nature relation. [Cartesian
thinking wrongly constructs capital and nature as two separate entities
in causal interaction with each other and then compounds this error by
imagining that one dominates over]{.underline} (or, in the case of
nature, 'takes revenge' upon) [the other. More sophisticated versions
incorporate feedback loops.]{.underline} The alternative way of thinking
proposed here is at first not so easy to grasp. [Capital is a working
and evolving ecological system within which both nature and capital are
constantly being produced and reproduced. This is the right way to think
of it]{.underline}.2

### AT Financialization 

#### Financialization is heavily regulated now -- [capital limits]{.underline}, [derivatives regulation]{.underline}, and [stress-tests]{.underline} insulate the financial sector from the wholesale economy

**Barr '17** (Michael S. Barr -- Professor of Law, Faculty Director of
Finance, and Professor of Public Policy @ the University of Michigan,
nonresident senior fellow at the Center for American Profess, JD @ Yale,
"Financial Reform: Making the System Safer and Fairer," 4 January 2017,
http://www.rsfjournal.org/doi/full/10.7758/RSF.2017.3.1.01)

OVERVIEW OF REFORMS

[Today]{.underline}, [major financial firms are subject to]{.underline}
**[higher prudential standards]{.underline}**, [including higher capital
and liquidity requirements,]{.underline} **[stress tests]{.underline}**,
[and]{.underline} [resolution planning through "living wills." By
forcing firms to **internalize more of the costs** that they impose on
the system, they will be **incentivized to shrink and reduce their
complexity**]{.underline}, [leverage, and interconnections]{.underline}.
[Should such a firm fail, there will be a **bigger capital buffer to
absorb losses**]{.underline}. [To stem a panic, the Dodd-Frank Act
permits the]{.underline} Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation
([FDIC]{.underline}) [to resolve the largest and most interconnected
financial companies **without exposing the system** to a sudden,
disorderly failure that puts the economy at risk.]{.underline}

[On the global level]{.underline}, [the international community has put
forward new rules on capital, so that there are **bigger buffers in the
system** in the event of failures]{.underline}. [Capital will be
measured in a **more conservative way**]{.underline}, [and capital
levels are going up significantly]{.underline}. [Systemically important
firms will hold even higher levels of capital]{.underline}. There are
new rules on liquidity and a global leverage limit. **[Derivatives
reforms are proceeding]{.underline}**, [as are new approaches to dealing
with the risks from repo and securities financing
transactions]{.underline}.

Yet much more work remains to be done, and the financial sector did not
leave the battlefield after their defeats in 2010. Far from it. The
brutal fight over financial reform rages on, and there is serious risk
that a collective amnesia about the causes and consequences of the
financial crisis appears to be descending on global financial capitals
that will further weaken the resolve for reform (See, for example,
Coffee 2011, 2012).

COMPARING U.S. FINANCIAL REGULATION PRE-CRISIS AND POST-REFORM

**[Many readers may be skeptical]{.underline}** [regarding the efficacy
of the reforms that have taken place thus far, either because they think
they did not change the system enough, or because they think that they
went too far.]{.underline} The following section takes the time to chart
the path of reform so far, before turning to the difficulties and
dangers on the road ahead.

First, before Dodd-Frank, if an entity was a bank, it had tougher
regulations, more stringent capital requirements, and more robust
supervision; but if an entity was an investment bank engaged in the same
kind of maturity transformation, it had to abide by different rules (see
Scott 2010). When U.S. investment banks needed to find a "consolidated
holding company regulator" in order to meet European Union standards for
doing business in Europe, the Securities and Exchange Commission set up
a voluntary Consolidated Supervised Entity program which had little
oversight. The SEC was not established as a prudential regulator, did
not have clear supervisory power, and had little experience and few
trained examiners. Moreover, the leverage ratio that served as a
backstop for bank capital requirements was not applied to investment
banks.

The Federal Reserve was too lax in supervising firms where it did have
authority and it did not have any authority to set and enforce capital
requirements on the major institutions that operated businesses outside
of bank holding companies. That meant it had no supervision over
investment banks, diversified financial institutions such as AIG, or the
nonbank financial companies competing with banks in the mortgage,
consumer credit, and business lending markets. The Office of Thrift
Supervision viewed its role as supervising thrifts, not their holding
companies (such as AIG). Banks and thrifts freely engaged in risky
mortgage lending, and regulators did not step in until it was too late.

[Today, Dodd-Frank has provided authority for **clear**]{.underline},
**[strong]{.underline}** [and]{.underline} **[consolidated
supervision]{.underline}** [and regulation by the Federal Reserve of any
financial firm]{.underline}---regardless of legal form---[whose failure
could pose a threat to financial stability]{.underline}. The largest
investment banks that survived the financial crisis merged into or
became bank holding companies subject to Fed oversight. AIG, GE Capital,
Prudential, and MetLife have now been brought under Fed supervision
through the Financial Stability Oversight Council (FSOC) designation.
[As a result of Dodd-Frank changes, thrift holding
companies]{.underline} (including those with large insurance operations)
[are now supervised by the Fed]{.underline}. The Office of Thrift
Supervision and the SEC's investment bank regime have been abolished.
[Thus, all bank and thrift holding companies, as well as **systemically
important nonbank firms**]{.underline}, **[regardless of corporate
form]{.underline}**, [are supervised by the Federal
Reserve]{.underline}. [We will have a single point of accountability for
tougher and more consistent supervision of the largest and most
interconnected financial firms.]{.underline}

Although the regulatory infrastructure is, to put it mildly, far from
ideal, with too many divided responsibilities and too many opportunities
for turf battles or regulatory gaps, [Dodd-Frank created the FSOC, which
is responsible for identifying threats to financial stability and
dealing with them. The FSOC can recommend stricter regulatory action,
and regulators must either implement such changes or explain publicly
why they are not acting]{.underline} (see Gerson 2013). [Already, this
process has led the SEC to impose **stricter regulation of money market
funds**]{.underline} [than would otherwise have occurred]{.underline}
(Barr 2015a). The FSOC has the potential to get information across the
financial services marketplace through the Office of Financial Research
(OFR), which Dodd-Frank established and empowered to collect data from
any financial firm, and to develop and enforce standardization for data
collection. The OFR has begun to use this authority by developing a
"legal entity identifier" for financial transactions. The OFR is charged
with independently assessing risks in the financial system, and can
potentially serve as a counterweight to the Fed by providing independent
assessments of whether the Fed is adequately supervising the largest
firms and dealing with the critical issues in systemic risk. [A strong
OFR can serve as a **check and balance** for regulatory agencies,
ensuring that they improve their own performance or risk being
criticized]{.underline} (Ludwig 2012; Barr 2015a).

[Dodd-Frank provides for more stringent prudential standards and higher
capital and liquidity standards for the largest bank and nonbank
firms]{.underline}. In addition to the heightened capital requirements
applicable to all firms, [the largest firms are subject to a capital
surcharge, a leverage ratio, a toughened supplemental leverage ratio, a
more stringent liquidity requirement, and capital required to pass
stress tests.]{.underline}

[Already, capital levels in the banking system have doubled, and banks'
use of short-term nondeposit funding has plummeted]{.underline}. [The
**annual stress tests**]{.underline} [are evaluating a firm's ability to
withstand **deep market contractions**]{.underline}. [There are enhanced
rules on affiliate transactions and lending limits, and much stricter
proposed limits on counterparty credit exposures]{.underline}. Deposit
insurance premiums are going up on the very largest firms. The Volcker
Rule prohibits banking entities from engaging in certain proprietary
trading or running internal hedge funds, subject to a number of
exceptions, and also helps to simplify the task of winding down major
firms that are at risk of failure. [Moreover, the Fed is using
macro-prudential supervision as it increases its capacity to understand
and **mitigate risks to the financial system as a whole**.]{.underline}

There is a healthy debate about breaking up or limiting the size of
financial firms. [Under the Dodd-Frank Act, major firms are subject to a
**concentration limit** that generally prohibits a financial company
from engaging in mergers or acquisitions that would result in the firm's
liabilities]{.underline}---including wholesale funding and off-balance
sheet exposures---exceeding 10 percent of the liabilities of financial
companies as a whole. Dodd-Frank provides regulators with the authority
to require financial institutions to restructure their activities to
make it credible that they can be resolved if they are in danger of
collapse; the resolution planning process has already forced firms to
begin to simplify their organization form, develop "clean" holding
companies, and place large amounts of capital and long-term debt in the
holding company to assist with the resolution. The act also permits
regulators to force firms to be broken up if they fail to submit a
credible plan and thereafter fail to meet regulators' requirements to
restructure themselves to make resolution credible. Such [firms can also
be broken up if they are found to pose a grave threat to financial
stability]{.underline}. [These enhanced prudential measures for major
financial firms are likely to reduce risk in the financial system,
constrain further concentration, and **reduce "too big to fail"
distortions**.]{.underline}

Second, [before Dodd-Frank, shadow banking markets grew dramatically
with little oversight and in the absence of even regulatory or
marketwide knowledge about the nature of the markets they were serving.
For example, the OTC derivatives market---with a notional amount of
\$700 trillion at its peak---grew up in the shadows, with little
oversight. Credit derivatives, which were supposed to diffuse risk,
instead concentrated it.]{.underline} Synthetic securitization with
embedded derivatives magnified failures in the real securitization
market. Major financial firms used derivatives to increase their credit
exposure to each other, rather than decrease it.

**[We should never again face a situation]{.underline}**---[such as
AIG's \$2 trillion derivatives portfolio]{.underline}---[where the
potential failure of a virtually unregulated, capital-deficient major
player in the derivatives market can impose devastating risks on the
entire system]{.underline}. Insufficient capital meant that major
participants in the system could not reliably pay out on their
obligations, and insufficient margin meant that counterparties on every
transaction were more exposed to the risk of nonpayment. When the crisis
began, regulators, financial firms, and investors had an insufficient
understanding of the degree to which trouble at one firm spelled trouble
for another, because of the opacity of the market. This lack of
information magnified the contagion as the crisis intensified, causing a
damaging wave of margin increases, deleveraging, and credit market
breakdowns. Lack of transparency, insufficient supervision, and
inadequate capital and margin left our financial system vulnerable to
concentrations of risk, and to abuse.

Today, under Dodd-Frank, regulators are putting in place the tools
comprehensively to regulate the OTC derivatives market for the first
time. [The act requires all standardized derivatives to be centrally
cleared, which will substantially reduce the buildup of bilateral
counterparty credit risk between major financial firms]{.underline}.
Under Dodd-Frank rules, **[75 percent]{.underline}** [of new derivative
contracts were centrally cleared in 2015 as compared to only 15 percent
in 2007]{.underline} (Massad 2015). Central clearinghouses are subject
to strong prudential supervision under the Dodd-Frank Act. [Dodd-Frank
requires standardized derivatives to be traded on exchanges or
alternative swap execution facilities, which improves pre- and
post-trade price transparency]{.underline}. Trading transparency will
help to improve price competition as well as to improve safety and
soundness, as market participants and regulators will have full access
to current prices in the event of system disruptions. [Even
non-centrally-cleared OTC derivatives are to be reported to a trade
repository, making the market far more transparent]{.underline}.

[The act provides for prudential regulation, capital requirements, and
business conduct rules for all swap dealers and major swap participants.
It provides for robust capital and margin requirements for derivative
transactions, and higher requirements for those that are not centrally
cleared, providing a strong incentive to use central clearing and
maintain a bigger buffer against losses]{.underline}. It also provides
for regulatory and enforcement tools to go after manipulation, fraud,
and other abuse.

[At the same time as the act reforms derivatives markets, it provides a
new framework for **regulation of financial market utilities** and
critical payment, clearing, and settlement activities, including not
only those in the derivatives markets but also those in the wholesale
funding markets]{.underline}---securities financing transactions (such
as repo and securities lending), commercial paper, and prime
brokerage---that are critical to the shadow banking system.

In the lead-up to the financial crisis, major financial firms became
increasingly funded not by traditional bank deposits, nor even
longer-term funding in the commercial markets, but rather by overnight
funding in the repo markets. An important part of that market, the
triparty repo market, became increasingly concentrated in only two major
clearing banks, which were themselves exposed to counterparty risk from
securities firms borrowing intraday credit. As the triparty repo market
became more concentrated, it also became riskier because counterparties
came to accept not only Treasury securities as collateral, but also
highly rated but opaque asset-backed securities. These securities in
turn became riskier as credit rating agencies became increasingly
willing to label as safe assets that were lower quality, including pools
of securities backed only by poorly underwritten subprime and Alt-A
mortgages. When the financial crisis hit, repo and commercial paper
markets froze, and investors in money market funds ran, causing a
massive contraction in credit not only for financial firms but also
major firms in the real economy (that is, non-financial). This
contraction was overcome only with massive interventions by the Fed, the
FDIC, and the Treasury.

The Dodd-Frank Act provides the foundation fundamentally to reform the
wholesale funding markets by providing strong authority for the Federal
Reserve to regulate financial market utilities and critical payment,
clearing, and settlement activities; to set new rules for capital,
collateral, and margin requirements for repo and other securities
financing, and other critical markets; and to establish uniform
prudential standards throughout the financial system. While repo and
other securities financing policies are still a work in progress,
short-term financing reforms are already being reinforced by new capital
and liquidity requirements, liability concentration limits under the
act, and reforms to the assessment base for deposit insurance that
encompass all liabilities. Once fully implemented, these reforms will
have the combined effect of taxing short-term liabilities, which will
force firms to internalize more of the costs of short-term funding.
These steps have already reduced the use of short-term funding, and will
provide incentives to manage their use more carefully even when interest
rates normalize.

[The act also **fundamentally transforms** regulation of another major
element of the shadow banking system, securitization]{.underline}. [The
act]{.underline} **[requires deep transparency]{.underline}** [into the
structure of securitizations, including information about assets and
originators]{.underline}. [Securitization sponsors must generally retain
risk in their securitizations]{.underline}, unless the mortgages they
pool meet guidelines as plain vanilla "qualified residential mortgages"
so that incentives are better aligned among participants in the system.
[Capital rules will better account for risk in
securitizations]{.underline}. [Parallel changes in accounting rules will
now bring the most common forms of securitization onto the balance
sheet.]{.underline} Credit-rating agencies will be subject to heightened
liability for failure to conduct ratings with integrity, with
comprehensive oversight by the SEC, including policing of ratings
shopping and conflicts of interest; ratings themselves will be more
transparent and will include key information on rating methodology,
compliance, qualitative and quantitative data, due diligence, and other
protections.

#### Financialization impact empirically denied

Steven N. **Kaplan 17**, Neubauer Family Professor of Entrepreneurship
and Finance at the University of Chicago Booth School of Business, "Are
U.S. Companies Too Short-Term Oriented? Some Thoughts," May 2017,
https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2972117

U.S. [companies are frequently criticized for focusing too much on the
short run]{.underline} and not enough on the long run. For example,
Laurence [Fink]{.underline}, the CEO of BlackRock, one of the largest
money managers, [wrote]{.underline} that "the effects of the
short-termist phenomenon are troubling . . . more and more [corporate
leaders have responded with actions that can deliver immediate returns
to shareholders, such as buybacks or dividend increases, while
underinvesting in]{.underline} innovation, skilled workforces or
[essential capital expenditures necessary to sustain long-term
growth]{.underline}."1 The Report of the Commission on Inclusive
Prosperity (co-chaired by Larry Summers) similarly weighed in, "An
additional reason for the absence of inclusive prosperity is the
changing nature of corporate behavior. Business leaders, government
officials and academics have pointed out that corporations have shifted
their traditional focus on long-term profit maximization to maximizing
short-term stock-market valuations. One reason that economists have
advanced for this transition to corporate short- termism is the
overwhelming shift to stock-market-based compensation for CEOs and other
highly compensated executives at publicly traded corporations."2

In other words, these [critics argue that US companies as a group
destroy value by not investing for the long run]{.underline}. More
formally, the short-term argument can be summarized as follows. U.S
companies as a group underinvest in capital expenditures as well as
research and development. According to the argument, this benefits the
companies in the short- term, but harms the companies in the long run
where the short-term is usually defined as the current quarter or,
perhaps, current year or two, while the long-term would be more than
five years out. [Poor corporate governance and overly generous pay plans
for CEOs that reward short-term behavior are often cited as accomplices
to short-termism]{.underline}.3

The [critics]{.underline} also point to empirical evidence to support
their positions. For example, Graham et al. (2005) survey 401 financial
executives and find that 78 percent would sacrifice long-term value to
smooth earnings. Others [point to corporate dividends and
buybacks]{.underline}. Lazonick (2014) shows that S&P 500 companies paid
out over 90% of their net income in dividends and share repurchases,
leaving little available for investment in the long-term. Lazonick and
others contend that companies buy back their own stock to boost their
share prices in the short run, regardless of the long-term impact.

[These criticisms, however, are not new. They have been
raised]{.underline}, prominently, in some form or another [since the
late 1970s]{.underline}. In this paper, I present those historical
criticisms. I then consider the implications of sustained short-termism
for corporate profits, venture capital investment and returns, private
equity investment and returns, and corporate valuations. In fact, [there
is **very little long-term evidence** that is consistent with the
predictions of the short-term critics.4]{.underline}

1\. Some Short-termist History

The criticism that US companies are plagued by short-termism and poor
governance has a long history. In 1980, Harvard Business School's Robert
H. Hayes and William J. Abernathy wrote an influential article
criticizing American companies for being too short-term oriented:

"By their preference for servicing existing markets rather than creating
new ones and by their devotion to short-term returns and management by
the numbers, many of them have effectively forsworn long-term
technological superiority as a competitive weapon. In consequence, they
have abdicated their strategic responsibilities."

Similarly, Marty Lipton wrote in 1979:

"It would not be unfair to pose the policy issue as: Whether the
long-term interests of the nation's corporate system and economy should
be jeopardized in order to benefit speculators interested . . . only in
a quick profit . . . ?"

In 1992, Harvard's Michael E. Porter repeated the argument:

"The U.S. system of allocating investment capital is failing, putting
American companies at a serious disadvantage and threatening the
long-term growth of the nation\'s economy... Many American companies
invest too little, particularly in those intangible assets and
capabilities required for competitiveness -- R&D, employee training and
skills development ... The U.S. system, first and foremost advances the
goals of shareholders at the expense of the long-term performance of
American companies. In global competition, where investment increasingly
determines a company\'s capacity to upgrade and innovate, the U.S.
system does not measure up."

And the short-term argument is being repeated today by the likes of
Laurence Fink and Larry Summers. While some, like Fink, focus on public
companies, the arguments of Abernathy and Hayes, Porter, Summers refer
to the overall U.S. economy.

2\. U.S. Corporate Profits

It is clear from the previous section that [critiques of U.S. businesses
as overly short-term oriented have been with us for at least 35
years]{.underline}. And [the criticisms have not changed
much]{.underline}, if at all, [in]{.underline} their basic tenor.

But, [this has **very strong implications** for the short-term argument.
It's been more than 35 years since the publication of the]{.underline}
Hayes and Abernathy [article]{.underline}, and 25 years since the
appearance of Porter's. By any measure, [today is the long-term that
U.S. companies supposedly have underinvested in]{.underline} since the
1980s. Accordingly, [the short-term logic implies that U.S. business
should be performing poorly today.]{.underline}

But **[that is unequivocally not the case]{.underline}**. Figure 1
reports U.S. corporate profits before tax as a fraction of GDP since
1951. Today, [corporate profits are near all-time highs]{.underline}
(over that post-war period). [The uptrend began just around
the]{.underline} time of the Hayes and Abernathy article, and has
continued since.

The [early 1980s]{.underline} is precisely the [time]{.underline} that
many observers believe [finance]{.underline} and the goal of shareholder
value maximization [became ascendant]{.underline}. It is also the time
that Wall Street and [the financial sector began to grow]{.underline}

[substantially]{.underline}

---both in the US and internationally. [The early 1980s also coincided
with the rise of management consultants]{.underline} who spread
techniques across US firms and across the world.5 In 1980, consulting
firms were relatively new and relatively small. Today, McKinsey &
Company has offices in more than 60 countries; the Boston Consulting
Group has offices in more than 40. And the early 1980s also coincided
with an explosion in information technology and globalization.

Consistent with the increase in corporate profits, both Autor et al.
(2017) and Burkai (2016) explore explanations for the strong corporate
profitability and, concomitant, weak labor share of GDP.

Whatever its source, [the strong profitability of U.S. corporations
is]{.underline} difficult for the short-termists to explain. It is
[obviously not consistent with poor corporate performance over the
long-term]{.underline}. Nevertheless, short-termists continue to repeat
the criticisms of the 1980s and 1990s.

It is worth adding that [the strong corporate performance also is
inconsistent with poor corporate governance overall]{.underline},
suggesting that [criticisms of U.S. corporate governance also are
overstated]{.underline}. This is arguably the type of example that the
quote by John Stuart Mill that begins this paper had in mind.

### AT: Threat Con 

#### No threat inflation

**Ravenal 9** -- (2009, Earl, Professor Emeritus at the Edmund A. Walsh
School of Foreign Service and the Department of Government at Georgetown
University, "What\'s Empire Got to Do with It? The Derivation of
America\'s Foreign Policy," Critical Review: An Interdisciplinary
Journal of Politics and Society 21.1, 21-75)

Rummaging through the concomitants of "imperialism," Eland (2004, 65)
discovers the thesis of ["threat inflation"]{.underline} (in this case,
virtual threat invention):

Obviously, much higher spending for the military, homeland security, and
foreign aid are required for a policy of global intervention than for a
policy of merely defending the republic. For example, after the cold
war, the security bureaucracies began looking for new enemies to justify
keeping defense and intelligence budgets high.

Similarly, Eland (ibid., 183), in a section entitled "Imperial Wars
Spike Corporate Welfare," attributes a large portion of the U.S. defense
budget---particularly the procurement of major weapons systems, such as
"Virginia‐class submarines ... aircraft carriers ... F‐22 fighters ...
\[and\] Osprey tilt‐rotor transport aircraft"---not to the systemically
derived requirement for certain kinds of military capabilities, but,
rather, to the imperatives of corporate pork. He opines that such
weapons have no strategic or operational justification; that "the
American empire, militarily more dominant than any empire in world
history, can fight brushfire wars against terrorists and their 'rogue'
state sponsors without those gold‐plated white elephants."

The underlying notion of "the security bureaucracies ... looking for new
enemies" [is a threadbare concept that has somehow taken hold across the
political spectrum]{.underline}, from the radical left (viz. Michael
Klare \[1981\], who refers to a "threat bank"), to the liberal center
(viz. Robert H. Johnson \[1997\], who dismisses most alleged "threats"
as "improbable dangers"), to libertarians (viz. Ted Galen Carpenter
\[1992\], Vice President for Foreign and Defense Policy of the Cato
Institute, who wrote a book entitled A Search for Enemies). [What is
missing from most analysts' claims of "threat inflation," however, is a
convincing theory of why]{.underline}, say, the American government
significantly (not merely in excusable rhetoric) might magnify and even
invent threats (and, more seriously, act on such inflated threat
estimates).

In a few places, [Eland]{.underline} (2004, 185) [suggests that such
behavior might stem from military or national security bureaucrats'
attempts to enhance their personal status and organizational
budgets]{.underline}, or even from the influence and dominance of "the
military‐industrial complex"; viz.: "Maintaining the empire and
retaliating for the blowback from that empire keeps what President
Eisenhower called the military‐industrial complex fat and happy." Or, in
the same section:

In the nation's capital, [vested interests]{.underline}, such as the law
enforcement bureaucracies ... [routinely take advantage of
"crises"]{.underline}to satisfy parochial desires. Similarly, many
corporations use crises to get pet projects--- a.k.a. pork---funded by
the government. And national security crises, because of people's fears,
are especially ripe opportunities to grab largesse. (Ibid., 182)

Thus, "bureaucratic‐politics" theory, which once made several
reputations (such as those of Richard Neustadt, Morton Halperin, and
Graham Allison) in defense‐intellectual circles, and spawned an entire
sub‐industry within the field of international relations, 5 is put into
the service of dismissing putative security threats as imaginary.

So, too, can a surprisingly cognate theory, "public choice," 6 which can
be considered the right‐wing analog of the "bureaucratic‐politics"
model, and is a preferred interpretation of governmental decision‐making
among libertarian observers. As Eland (2004, 203) summarizes:

[Public‐choice theory argues]{.underline} \[that\] [the
government]{.underline} itself [can develop separate interests from its
citizens]{.underline}. The government reflects the interests of powerful
pressure groups and the interests of the bureaucracies and the
bureaucrats in them. Although this problem occurs in both foreign and
domestic policy, it may be more severe in foreign policy because
citizens pay less attention to policies that affect them less directly.

There is, in this statement of public‐choice theory, a certain
ambiguity, and a certain degree of contradiction: [Bureaucrats are
supposedly, at the same time, subservient]{.underline} to societal
interest groups [and autonomous]{.underline} from society in general.

This journal has pioneered the argument that state autonomy is a likely
consequence of the public's ignorance of most areas of state activity
(e.g., Somin 1998; DeCanio 2000a, 2000b, 2006, 2007; Ravenal 2000a). But
state autonomy does not necessarily mean that bureaucrats substitute
their own interests for those of what could be called the "national
society" that they ostensibly serve. I have argued (Ravenal 2000a) that,
precisely because of the public‐ignorance and elite‐expertise factors,
and especially because the opportunities---at least for bureaucrats (a
few notable post‐government lobbyist cases nonwithstanding)---for
lucrative self‐dealing are stringently fewer in the defense and
diplomatic areas of government than they are in some of the
contract‐dispensing and more under‐the‐radar‐screen agencies of
government, the "public‐choice" imputation of self‐dealing, rather than
working toward the national interest (which, however may not be
synonymous with the interests, perceived or expressed, of citizens!) is
less likely to hold. In short, state autonomy is likely to mean, in the
derivation of foreign policy, that "state elites" are using rational
judgment, in insulation from self‐promoting interest groups---about what
strategies, forces, and weapons are required for national defense.

Ironically, "public choice"---not even a species of economics, but
rather a kind of political interpretation---is not even about "public"
choice, since, like the bureaucratic‐politics model, it repudiates the
very notion that bureaucrats make truly "public" choices; rather, they
are held, axiomatically, to exhibit "rent‐seeking" behavior, wherein
they abuse their public positions in order to amass private gains, or at
least to build personal empires within their ostensibly official niches.
Such sub‐rational models actually explain very little of what they
purport to observe. Of course, there is some truth in them, regarding
the "behavior" of some people, at some times, in some circumstances,
under some conditions of incentive and motivation. But the factors that
they posit operate mostly as constraints on the otherwise rational
optimization of objectives that, if for no other reason than the playing
out of official roles, transcends merely personal or parochial
imperatives.

My treatment of "role" differs from that of the bureaucratic‐politics
theorists, whose model of the derivation of foreign policy depends
heavily, and acknowledgedly, on a narrow and specific identification of
the role‐playing of organizationally situated individuals in a partly
conflictual "pulling and hauling" process that "results in" some policy
outcome. Even here, bureaucratic‐politics theorists Graham Allison and
Philip Zelikow (1999, 311) allow that "some players are not able to
articulate \[sic\] the governmental politics game because their
conception of their job does not legitimate such activity." This is a
crucial admission, and one that points---empirically---to the need for a
broader and generic treatment of role.

[Roles]{.underline} (all theorists state) [give rise to "expectations"
of performance. My point is that virtually every governmental role, and
especially national‐security roles, and particularly]{.underline} the
roles of [the]{.underline} uniformed [military]{.underline}, [embody
expectations of devotion to the "national interest"]{.underline};
[**rationality** in the derivation of policy]{.underline} at every
functional level; [and **objectivity** in the treatment of
parameters]{.underline}, especially external parameters [such as
"threats"]{.underline} and the power and capabilities of other nations.

[Sub‐rational models]{.underline} (such as "public choice") [fail to
take into account even a partial dedication to the "national"
interest]{.underline} (or even the possibility that the national
interest may be honestly misconceived in more parochial terms). [In
contrast, an official's role connects the individual to the]{.underline}
(state‐level) [process, and moderates the]{.underline} (perhaps
otherwise) [self‐seeking impulses of the individual]{.underline}.
[Role‐derived behavior tends to be **formalized and
codified**]{.underline}; relatively [**transparent** and]{.underline} at
least **[peer‐reviewed]{.underline}**, so as to be consistent with
expectations; [surviving the particular individual and transmitted to
successors and ancillaries]{.underline}; [measured against a
standard]{.underline} and thus corrigible; [defined in terms
of]{.underline} the performed [function]{.underline} and therefore
derived from the state function; [and uncorrrupt, because]{.underline}
personal [cheating and]{.underline} even egregious [aggrandizement are
conspicuously discouraged]{.underline}.

My own direct observation suggests that [defense decision‐makers attempt
to "frame" the structure of the problems that they try to solve on the
basis of the most accurate intelligence]{.underline}. [They make it
their business to know where the threats come from]{.underline}. Thus,
**[threats are not "socially constructed"]{.underline}** (even though,
of course, some values are).

[A major reason for]{.underline} the [rationality, and]{.underline} the
[objectivity]{.underline}, of the process [is that much security
planning is done, not in vaguely undefined circumstances that offer
scope for idiosyncratic, subjective behavior, but rather in structured
and reviewed organizational frameworks]{.underline}.
[Non‐rationalities]{.underline} (which are bad for understanding and
prediction[) tend to get filtered out]{.underline}. [People are fired
for presenting skewed analysis and for making bad
predictions]{.underline}. This is because [something important is riding
on the causal analysis and the contingent prediction]{.underline}.

For these reasons, "public choice" does not have the "feel" of reality
to many critics who have participated in the structure of defense
decision‐making. In that structure, obvious, and even not‐so‐obvious,
["rent‐seeking" would not only be shameful; it would present a severe
risk of career termination]{.underline}. And, as mentioned, [the defense
bureaucracy is hardly a productive place for truly talented rent‐seekers
to operate]{.underline}, [compared to opportunities for personal profit
in the commercial world]{.underline}. A bureaucrat's very self‐placement
in these reaches of government testifies either to a sincere commitment
to the national interest or to a lack of sufficient imagination to
exploit opportunities for personal profit.

**Bledsoe and Wright 18'** (Adam and Willie Jamaal (2018) "The
anti-Blackness of global capital." Sage 10.1177/0263775818805102 Florida
State University.)

[[The increasing globalization of capital and spatial marginalization of
"superfluous" populations is fundamentally tied to the negation of Black
life and assumptions of Black non- being]{.underline}.]{.mark} [The
treatment of [Black lives as the embodied absence of value, or, "the
very condition of existence and the determination of value," underpins
Black non-being and the assumed lack of Black cartographic capacity in
the dominant spatial imaginary, making global cap- italism
possible]{.mark}]{.underline} (Ferreira da Silva, 2017: 1). [The
interconnected nature of capitalism and race]{.underline} is a well-worn
topic. [Scholars have theorized race as an ideological outgrowth of the
economy]{.underline} (Hall, 1996); as an apparatus used to facilitate
flows of people and commodities (Lowe, 2015); as a central component of
capitalist maturation (James, 1989); and as a phenomenon necessary for
the establishment of the world system (Robinson, 2000), among countless
other approaches. Geographers, too, have unpacked the ways in which
regimes of capitalism employ racialized concepts to reproduce.
Geographic interrogations of racial capitalism have analyzed the role of
racist assumptions in implementing neoliberal reforms in the wake of a
natural disaster (Derickson, 2014); the manipulation of racial
distinction to prevent labor organizing (Wilson, 2000); how resistance
to Black landowner- ship underpinned early 20th-century industrial
agriculture (Williams, 2017); the role of capitalism in perpetuating
environmental racism (Pulido, 2017); and the centrality of plan- tation
relations to numerous variations of capitalism (Woods, 1998).
[Nonetheless, [we must push further to explicate the ways in which
capitalism is actually dependent on anti-Blackness to realize itself,
instead of understanding anti-Black racism as a secondary effect of the
economy or a phenomenon that emerges periodically]{.mark}.]{.underline}
That is to say, reflections on the interlinked nature of race and
[[capitalism must move beyond an assump- tion of economic causality and
grapple with the ways in which anti-Blackness is actually an
always-present precondition for capital
accumulation.]{.underline}]{.mark} In explicating anti-Blackness, we
draw on an Afro-Pessimist framework, as Afro-Pessimism makes distinct
claims about the nature of Blackness in the modern world. An
Afro-Pessimist analysis of anti- Blackness does not treat anti-Black
racism as a contingent phenomenon (Wilderson, 2011: 3--4) but rather as
a global, ever-present factor that exists as the basis "for expansion
and unending space within the symbolic economy of settlement" (King,
2014). [Such an approach forces us to recognize how anti-Blackness
punctuates the modern epoch by iden- tifying the underlying logics that
inform concrete manifestations of anti-Black racism around the
world.]{.underline} In this way, Afro-Pessimism adds new dimensions to
already-existing work on the connections between anti-Blackness and
political economy by recognizing that, while capitalism exploits all of
the world's populations, it does not dominate all of them in the same
way. With regard to the question of space, [anti-Blackness helps us
understand how the afterlife of slavery]{.underline} (Hartman, 2007: 6)
[leads to Black populations being conceptually unable to legitimately
create space, thereby leaving locations associated with Blackness open
to the presumably "rational" agendas of dominant spatial actors. [Black
populations, then, serve as the guarantor of capitalism's need to
constantly find new spaces of accumulation]{.mark}.]{.underline} In this
section, [[we offer an explanation of how capitalism relies on
anti-Blackness by fore- grounding anti-Blackness as a phenomena with its
own internal logics and concrete expressions]{.mark}. [Capitalism is
rooted in violent forms of captivity and murder unleashed on indigenous
and Afro-descendant populations the world over]{.mark}]{.underline}
(Ferreira da Silva, 2004; James, 1989; Rodney, 1972; Williams, 2014;
Wynter, 1995). [At its origin and in its contemporary man- ifestations,
then, capitalism is systemically related to slavery and its various
global permu- tations]{.underline} (Robinson, 2000: 313--314). [[The
assumption that Black populations lack both humanity and "space, that is
ethno- or politico-geography," defines the treatment of enslaved Black
peoples. Today, the assumed a-spatiality that defined conditions of
chattel slavery continues to imprint the socio-spatial relations that
reproduce global capital]{.mark}]{.underline} (Robinson, 2000: 81, 200).
[Black populations are deemed a-spatial as a result of the fact that
modern notions of space and practices of spatial production are rooted
in specific relations of power]{.underline} (Massey, 2005: 64,
100--101). These power relations are themselves organized around logics
that have particular historical roots (Santos, 2008: 21). [In the
colonial epoch, chattel slavery---the social, legal, and political
reduction of Africans to the status of nonhumans---produced the figure
of the Black, which had a nullified spatial capacity]{.underline}
(Wilderson, 2010: 279), was disavowed as a human being (Ferreira da
Silva, 2015: 91), and was a priori structurally prevented from enacting
"rational" spatial expressions (Santos, 2009: 24). [Locations asso-
ciated with Black populations became wholly "unhallowed" spaces, which
would never receive recognition as legitimately occupied]{.underline}
(Wynter, 1976: 81). This is not to suggest that Black peoples were or
are understood as not physically present. Black bodies are certainly
recognized as existing in exteriority (Raffestin, 2012: 129). Still,
this recognition of physical presence does not signify that Black
populations' are understood as establishing legible space. Despite
physical presence, [Black populations nonetheless remain rendered
"ungeographic" in dominant understandings of space]{.underline}
(McKittrick, 2006: x). [Hence, the geographic locations in which Black
populations reside are treated as open to the varied agendas espoused by
dominant spatial actors.]{.underline} Capitalism's new rounds of
accumulation require access to spaces that previously had different
relations to capitalist practices. The assumed a-spatiality of Black
populations often leads to purveyors of capitalism treating locations
inhabited by Black people as avail- able for emerging modes of
accumulation. Put another way, [spaces that were once marginal or
peripheral to the perpetuation of capital accumulation become sites of
appropriation precisely because the (Black) populations occupying them
receive no recognition as viable spatial actors. The spaces necessary
for new forms of accumulation are thus conceptually open because of this
assumed a-spatiality and subsequently physically opened via the spatial
removal and dispersal of Black residents]{.underline}. This dispersal
entails violent actions that are a priori legitimate because of the
assumed lack of Black spatial agency. In other words, [new spaces of
"investment have been mapped onto previous racial and colonial
(imperial) dis- courses and practices" evidencing an inextricable
relationship between anti-Black notions of space, capitalism's logic of
perpetual expansion, and the acceptable subordination of Black physical
presence]{.underline} (Chakravartty and Silva, 2012: 368). This is what
Frank [Wilderson terms]{.underline} the ["deterritorialisation of Black
space"]{.underline} (2003: 238) [that is necessary for accumulating
capital vis-a\` -vis emerging political economic practices.]{.underline}
Katherine [McKittrick]{.underline} similarly [notes that Black
geographies are cast as "the lands of no one" and "emptied out of life"
in order that "suitable capitalist life-support systems" be put into
place and globally prop- agated]{.underline} (McKittrick, 2013: 7). [A
[number of present-day practices demonstrate the reliance of capital on
this notion of empty, lifeless, Blackened spaces, such as capital
disinvestment, white flight, gentrification, urban renewal,
incarceration, and policing. These spatial arrangements identify Black
peo- ples as inhuman and locations associated with Black populations as
lacking a legitimate form of occupation and usage]{.mark}]{.underline}.
Such [assumptions contribute to the subordination of Black populations
and spaces to dominant notions of "appropriate" uses of space, while
"illegitimate" spaces of Blackness remain under siege by purveyors of
capital]{.underline}. As this occurs, new spaces of accumulation open in
areas formerly peripheral to the capitalist agenda. At the same time
that these new rounds of accumulation take place, [sovereign expressions
of power serve to forcibly remove Black people and ensure they remain
sepa- rated from these new spaces of accumulation.]{.underline}
Subsequently, Black people are routinely harassed for existing in the
communal spaces in which they have resided for generations.1 (\*\*END
NOTE BEGINS\*\*\*) [Consider the many well-publicized moments of Black
men, women, and children being subject to civilian surveillance and
encounters with police for mundane acts like meeting-while-Black (in
Philadelphia) and grilling-while-Black (in
Oakland).]{.underline}(\*\*\*END NOTE ENDS\*\*) Along with public policy
shifts, policing, incarceration, and extrajudicial killings simul-
taneously disqualify Black spatial agency and remove Black bodies from
spaces deemed open for appropriation by capitalism's purveyors, thereby
simultaneously spatializing anti- Blackness and reproducing global
capital. [The systemic casting of Black spaces as lifeless and open to
appropriation for the continuation of capital breathes new life into
"civil society's political economy: \[the Black body\] kick-starts. .
.capital at its genesis and rescues it from its over-accumulation crisis
at its end---black death is its condition of possibility]{.underline}"
(Wilderson, 2003: 238). Put simply, [the endless accumulation of capital
and its legitimating sovereign practices are, in part, made possible
through the continued societal insistence on Black inhumanity and a
Black lack of cartography, which casts Black spaces as
empty.]{.underline} [Hence, there exists an unquestionable connection
between the colonial logics inaugurated centuries ago and today's
capitalist agenda]{.underline}. The lack of recognition of [Black
humanity underpins both projects. Early capitalism flourished thanks to
the relegation of enslaved Blacks to the ontological and legal condition
of non-humans on the plantations, in the forests, and in the mines of
the Americas, while slaveholders and early insurance companies made
fortunes off their investments in the transatlantic slave trade.
Similarly, real estate speculation]{.underline} (Harvey, 2010), [urban
renewal]{.underline} (Perry, 2013), [the roll-back of social
wages]{.underline} (Wacquant, 2009), [and the explosion of
prisons]{.underline} (Gilmore, 2007)---[all of which have allowed
present-day capitalism to continue its agenda of accumulation---are only
possible via the understanding of spaces inhabited by Black populations
as empty and naming and treating those same populations as abject,
inhuman beings]{.underline}. In this way, [the anti-Blackness and
assumed lack of Black being that originated in and defined the colonial
epoch remains present with us today, despite the new material practices
and justifications it takes on. [Anti-Blackness remains an ever-present
condition, defining the modern world]{.mark}]{.underline}. Scholars can
and should look to Black thinkers and activists to help make sense of
the interrelated phenomena of anti-Blackness and global capital, as
Black grassroots actors explicate the linkages between these phenomena
(Burton, 2015).

### Perm---Universality 2AC 

#### The permutation solves and the aff is DA to the alternative -- the alternative's move to universality abandons the concrete particularity of dialectical struggle and only reproduces anti-black, European humanism -- the affirmative's analysis of blackness as a *[concrete universal]{.underline}* better analyzes the position of outside and non-being through which history itself gains coherence 

**Ciccariello-Maher 14**

(George Ciccariello-Maher, Associate Professor of Politics and Global
Studies at Drexel University, "'So Much the Worse for the Whites':
Dialectics of the Haitian Revolution," *Journal of French and

française*, Vol XXII, No 1 (2014) pgs. 34-37)

When nations coalesce, subnational collectives emerge in opposition to
them; when class identities weigh too heavily or uniformly, "anomalies"
emerge in the name of gender and race, driven not by the inherent
progress of History but by the irrepressible irreverence of subjective
struggles: [contra Buck-Morss]{.underline}, [it would be difficult to
think of a single instance of historical progress]{.underline} [that is
not the result of "[collective identities]{.mark}" coming together in
struggle]{.underline}, **[which [are frequently dismissed as
"exclusionary" and "partial]{.mark}" by those with a vested interest in
existing privileges]{.underline}**. Further, even many of those laudable
"anomalies" that Buck-Morss would center are also political identities,
but those nearer their moment of genesis, still fresh and lively with
the memory of their raison d'être. At what moment does porosity yield a
new collective identity, and when does an anomaly gain the force of
history? There would seem to be no qualitative difference between which
ruptural identities we privilege as sufficiently porous or anomalous and
those we relegate to the dustbin of the past. Further, to view
categories dialectically means to grasp their content rather than their
formal characteristics, as when James and Fanon allow the concepts of
race and nation to shift and acquire new content. If our interest is
porosity---as Buck-Morss insists it is---then the emergence of new
identities and the infusion of others with new political content should
stand front-and-center. [How to explain the shift between Buck-Morss'
qualified wariness toward "unthinking" identities]{.underline} that can
"mislead political judgment" [and her subsequent rejection of such
identities in toto]{.underline}? (111). [The answer lay]{.underline}, I
believe, [in **a heavy-handed "conceptual ordering"**]{.underline}
[which leads her]{.underline}---like the Hegel she critiques---[to
approach the universal by negating]{.underline}, **[rather than truly
passing through and inhabiting, the particular]{.underline}**. [[We have
seen elements of this ordering in]{.mark} **her [Eurocentric criteria
for the universal]{.mark}**]{.underline}, her decision as to which
period of the Haitian Revolution was properly universal, her celebration
of Toussaint and erasure of Dessalines, and in her privileging of the
massacre of the whites over that of the Vodou priests. Was Dessalines
blind to porosity when he baptized some Poles and Germans as "black"?
Was Fanon blind to porosity when he suggested that "some blacks can be
whiter than the whites"? And was not old Toussaint performing the same
maneuver when he mobilized on the basis of the nation, and even more so
when he reputedly told his troops "leave nothing white behind you"
(Black Jacobins, 288)? Despite Buck-Morss' rejection of overarching
frameworks of conceptual ordering, she clearly falls into the same. [But
[most worrying is the]{.mark} *way* that this ordering is carried
out]{.underline} [and **the [blanket rejection of
identities]{.mark}**]{.underline} that it entails. While insisting that,
against Hegel's overbearing universal, "there is no anticipation of
unity" in her own approach, Buck-Morss exhorts readers to think in terms
"as inclusive as humanity itself" (111). [[Access to the
universal]{.mark} thus [appears as]{.mark} though [unfettered by
historical structures of inequality]{.mark}]{.underline}[: [we can
simply will it into being]{.underline}]{.mark} [in our rejection of
divisive particularities]{.underline}.30 But if historical residue is
what taints identity, Buck-Morss strangely neglects that any such
residue might have settled upon the idea of rejecting all exclusionary
identities. [[Not only does this exclusion of the exclusionary **run the
risk of**]{.underline}]{.mark} the **[[false
universalism]{.underline}]{.mark}** of which Fanon warned, but [[it
is]{.underline}]{.mark} also **[[powerfully bound]{.mark}-up
[with]{.mark} the universal [pretensions of European thought]{.mark}
itself]{.underline}**. [What creative possibilities]{.underline} for
humanity [are excluded in the name of rejecting exclusionary
identities]{.underline}, and what use is a commitment to the porosity of
identities if these are already overdetermined as repressive barriers to
the universal? [[Buck-Morss]{.mark} speaks of the "paradox" whereby
collective identities aspiring to the universal nevertheless establish
their identity in opposition to others]{.underline} (110). [What she
[neglects is that]{.mark}, rather than a paradox, such
[opposition]{.mark}]{.underline}---aside from being built-into the lives
of many who enter into struggle---**[[does not imply]{.mark} the
[permanent closure of]{.mark} that [identity]{.mark}]{.underline}**. One
does not merely risk one's life, one risks one's life against, and yet
the lure of the universal is such that Buck-Morss rejects such enmity
entirely, thereby robbing those struggling of the tools necessary to
move forward. This thinker who critiques Hegel for having fallen silent
at the moment of dialectical consummation herself falls silent and
silences others in the same gesture, and this silence is far from
coincidental: Buck-Morss' project of universal history explicitly shuns
the identitarian, conflictive moment that stands at the heart of a
radicalized dialectics Rather than shedding the worst elements of the
Hegelian legacy--- rather than abandoning its "anticipation of
unity"---Buck-Morss in fact succumbs to the lure of anticipation in her
immediate embrace of the universal. [Fanon's words]{.underline}, once
launched [against Sartre]{.underline}, [here apply quite
well]{.underline}: [We had appealed to a friend of the colored
peoples]{.underline}, [and this friend had found nothing better to do
than **demonstrate the relativity of their action**]{.underline}. For
once this friend, this born Hegelian, had forgotten that consciousness
needs to lose itself in the night of the absolute, the only condition
for attaining self-consciousness (Black Skin, 112, translation
modified). [Much as Sartre subsumed Black identity as a "minor term" in
a broader dialectic whose outcome was the universality of
class]{.underline}, **[so too does [Buck- Morss similarly subsume
"partial" black and national identities, and the resistance they
engender, to her broader universal]{.mark}]{.underline}**. Were this
truly a new humanism, however, this subsumption would not be necessary
and nor would it be predefined according to European criteria: [[the
significance of the Haitian Revolution would not be to prove]{.mark} the
[universality]{.mark} of the French Revolution, [but
rather]{.mark}]{.underline}---in the words of Fanon's conclusion to
Wretched of the Earth---**[[to "flee]{.mark} this [stagnation where
dialectics has]{.mark} gradually [turned into a logic of the status
quo]{.mark}]{.underline}**" (237). [But unlike Sartre, [Buck-Morss does
more than merely]{.mark} [subsume the]{.mark} ostensibly [particular,
she]{.mark} openly [rejects it]{.mark}]{.underline}[,]{.mark} and as a
result, [[her betrayal is]{.underline}]{.mark} arguably [more
[galling]{.mark} than]{.underline} was [Sartre's]{.underline}: whereas
Sartre had at least recognized the dialectical importance of black
identity, [[Buck-Morss **dissolves all**]{.underline}]{.mark} such
**[[identities]{.mark} immediately and [unconditionally into her "new
humanism]{.mark}."]{.underline}** [Fanon also sought to craft a new
humanism]{.underline}, an aspiration he inherited from his great teacher
Aimé Césaire, [but unlike Buck-Morss, **their humanism is truly
decolonial and dialectical**]{.underline}. [[A decolonized dialectics is
powerfully attentive to **the realm of non-being**]{.underline},
[and]{.underline}]{.mark} [consequently to [the need for
**pre-dialectical struggle** by the colonized and racialized]{.mark} to
set history into motion]{.underline}, **[creating new humans in the
process]{.underline}**. Such a dialectics cannot therefore reject the
categories of collective action a priori, as though willing away the
entire structure of colonialism and racial overdetermination. Instead
these must be grasped firmly and filled with the aspirations of those
who take them up as a mantle and a banner. While Buck-Morss notes
Césaire's excitement at Hegel's suggestion that "to arrive at the
Universal, one must immerse oneself in the Particular" (16), she fails
to accompany that process of immersion, and as a result cannot grasp
[what Césaire himself would later deem a "**universal rich with all that
is particular**]{.underline}."31

class]{.underline}** ]{.mark}\[End Page 840\] **[[remains the only
identity where a straight white middle-class man can still feel
comfortable claiming himself a leading political voice]{.mark}, and thus
he may sometimes overcompensate by screaming that this is the only
identity that really matters\--[which is the same as claiming that class
is beyond identity]{.mark}.]{.underline}** Partly this is because
Marxist theory and Marx himself (a bourgeois intellectual creating the
theoretical practice for the workers\' revolution) stage the model for
working-class identity as a sort of trans-identification, a magical
identity that is transferable to those outside the group who commit
themselves to it wholeheartedly enough. If we look back, we realize even
this magical quality is not special to a history of class struggle, as
whites during the New Negro movements of the early twentieth century
felt that they were vanguard race leaders because they had putatively
imbibed some essential qualities of Negroness by cross-identifying with
the folk and their culture.

**[[Ironically]{.mark},]{.underline}** Ken\'s conclusion is full of the
very identity concepts that he hopes to transcend by an appeal to **[a
broadly conceived \"political left.\"]{.underline}** As I have already
suggested, **[\"[the left\" is an identity formation no less than race
or gender or sexuality.]{.mark}]{.underline}** Consider the other key
terms of Ken\'s manifesto: \"working and unemployed,\" \"men and
women,\" \"given interests.\" As Professor Michaels indicates,
**[\"interests\" are always implicated in identity because they concern
the negotiation of subject positions.]{.underline}** Ken\'s recourse to
\"men and women,\" instead of simply \"people\" or some other less
gendered term, indicates to what extent what he\'s referring to is an
alliance or coalition. Rather than ushering in a post-identity world of
pure common interests, Ken\'s manifesto looks back to the prehistory of
\"identity politics,\" that Edenic moment before we fell into
proliferating identities on the left. What is it that we bring together
in coalitions if not \"men\" and \"women,\" with the identifiable
interests that generally bring them to a common place across their
differing identity circumstances? **[[What are the \"working\" and
\"unemployed\" if not class-based identity
formations?]{.underline}]{.mark}** Most people on the left would have no
difficulty supporting the general idea in Ken\'s manifesto. The
difficulties arise once we try to move from the manifesto to politics,
from the ideal to specific strategies and tactics for bringing people
into a common \"left.\" What specific agendas should we support? Do we
abandon affirmative action, or fight for it? Do we dismiss abortion
rights, because that does not directly concern \"economic justice,\" or
fight for it? Do we support welfare reform or fight against it? Do we
ignore racial profiling, which again may seem distant from the gravity
of \"economic justice,\" or fight it? How do we determine which agendas
advance \"economic justice\" and which ones obstruct it? Do we take a
vote? Do we count who\'s against, who\'s for? Do we lobby those in our
own neighborhoods, which are by and large still segregated by race and
class? Such \[End Page 841\] nuts-and-bolts questions are the nuts and
bolts of politics, and they are exactly the kinds of issues that
\"identity politics\" handles effectively. **[Those of us who live in
upscale college communities that are relatively racially integrated can
sometimes forget, I think, that we are racial-identity exceptions: any
attempt to arrange a common interest in class across race will crash
head-on]{.underline}** (that *face* metonym again) **[into the walls of
racially segregated
groups]{.underline}** ***[within]{.underline}*** **[the working classes,
and the diverse cultures that they self-consciously
espouse.]{.underline}**

## Double Turn/You Link 

### Link is The Link---2AC 

#### The link is just flat out wrong and racist -- anti-racist struggle isn't neoliberalism and doesn't just result in multiculturalism that undermines labor struggles. The opposite is true -- the K is a conspiracy theory that dooms labor struggles -- they can't locate anti-capitalist successes because they see all problems with labor as exogenous to labor itself

**Roediger 17** \[David R., Prof. International & Interdisciplinary
Studies---American Studies @ KU, "Class, race, and Marxism," //AK47\]

Optimistic thinking proclaims that things have recently turned around.
It Started in Wisconsin was the title of a fine book on the mass
struggles there against anti-union legislation in 2011, but those
struggles were defensive, ultimately electoral, and soundly defeated. Or
perhaps "it started" with the 2008 sit-in at the Goose Island facility
of Chicago's Republic Windows and Doors, but that was a defensive
struggle against a plant closure, involving 200 workers, and the plant
closed. Or, how we hoped, Occupy "started it" again in 2011.10 "It
started" is interestingly most often applied to movements seen as
presenting class demands, but the quality of such movements remains very
far from turning into quantity. Spectacular workers' protests have
occurred, especially those of the immigrant rights marches and general
strikes of 2006 and of the recent local mobilizations of Black Lives
Matter.11 These [[struggles]{.mark} have won gains in some instances,
but they [are too easily considered as]{.mark} non-class,
[mobilizations]{.mark} simply [based on identity.]{.mark} **Meanwhile
[the "labor" struggle most able to sustain itself,]{.mark} that of [the
Chicago Teachers Union, has been]{.mark} also [the one with the most
sophisticated]{.mark} and energetic [anti--white supremacy
politics.]{.mark}12** One result of living inside of difficult
circumstances not of our own choosing is that [it has been too
easy]{.mark} for some [to suppose that our difficulties have been caused
by paying too much attention to race]{.mark}, to gender, or to
sexuality]{.underline} (where mass movements have also effected some
significant reforms), [[and not enough]{.mark} attention [to
class.]{.mark} When these arguments press furthest and most
simplistically---for example, in the writings of the literary scholar
Walter Benn Michaels---we are presented with the view that
[]{.mark}neoliberal elites countenance demands based on race, gender,
and sexuality in order to divert attention from the real inequalities of
class.]{.underline}13 [Such a **conspiracy theory** trades on the kernel
of truth that [elites]{.mark}, bureaucracies, and the judiciary
[do]{.mark} persistently [attempt to shift the terms of struggles
against racism]{.mark}, sexism, and homophobia/transphobia [into]{.mark}
soporific vagaries regarding "diversity" and
["multiculturalism."]{.mark} Corporate embraces of the "value of
diversity" are, it is true, not antiracist. Multiculturalism does
instead regularly mask desires for the surplus value produced by
diversity. **[But this hardly makes]{.mark} popular [antiracist
struggles irrelevant]{.mark} or inimical [to addressing class
oppression.]{.mark}** Benn Michaels's move courts at least three major
problems. First, it loses track of the extent to which [working-class
people participate in]{.mark} and shape initiatives such as immigrant
rights, trans rights, and [antiracist mobilizations and]{.mark}
therefore [misses working-class victories]{.mark} as momentous as those
[won]{.mark} in 2006 mass actions [by immigrant workers.]{.mark} Second,
it substitutes denunciation for patient attempts to define the terms of
a coalition encouraging those oppressed in differing ways to come
together and deepen the demands of all. Last, [it locates the causes of
the failures of]{.mark} organized labor and of [labor politics]{.mark}
outside and inside the Democratic Party [as exogenous to those
movements]{.mark} themselves, [imagining that]{.mark} doing [more of the
same will work]{.mark} out fine, or would if multiculturalism were only
defeated. [The failures of]{.mark} the [labor leadership are]{.mark}
much [better understood as failures of the labor leadership than]{.mark}
the result of being outfoxed by [multiculturalists.]{.mark} According to
Benn Michaels, the proof that demands for racial justice now function as
mere covers for maintaining class inequalities dramatically surfaces
when antiracists allow that in their ideal society poverty and
inequality would continue and merely be evenly distributed across racial
lines. The evidence that this is in fact a widely expressed position
among antiracists is very scant. But, to be clear, [the achievement of
the equality amidst oppression so ridiculed]{.mark} by Benn Michaels
[is]{.mark}, though impossible without a broader social transformation,
[not]{.mark} actually a goal that anti-capitalists should sneer at as
providing merely ["victories for neoliberalism."]{.mark}14 Since capital
produces difference in its own interests, its continued sway limits
progress towards eliminating racial inequality. By the same token,
**[inroads]{.mark} in that regard [do challenge the logic and limit the
room for maneuver of capitalist management.]{.mark}** As the
London-based socialist thinker Sivanandan has observed, "in recovering a
sense of oppression," [white workers must]{.mark} confront their
"alienation \[from\] a white-oriented culture" and ["arrive at a
consciousness of racial oppression."]{.mark}15 [Struggles for racial
justice are sites of learning for white workers, of self-activity by
workers of color, and of placing limits on capital's ability to divide
workers.]{.mark}]{.underline}

Neoliberalism and the University Following David Harvey (2005: 2),
[[neoliberalization]{.mark}]{.underline} can be understood [as a
[process during which human beings]{.mark} [internalize market
logic]{.mark}]{.underline}[,]{.mark} which [places one's well-being at
the nexus of individual entrepreneurial freedom and skill]{.underline}.
The [domain of the market [infiltrates all aspects of our lives
and]{.mark} becomes]{.underline} "[[incorporated into
the]{.underline}]{.mark} common-sense [[way many of **us interpret, live
in, and understand the world**]{.mark}"]{.underline} (3). Thus Harvey
argues that one of [the first challenges of neoliberalism was figuring
out how to use the state to instill neoliberal commonsense
understanding]{.underline}, and with regard to the university this
included the introduction of "user-fees." Alexander Weheliye (2014: 23)
tells us how these [forces of commercialization create a type of
[liberal individualization]{.mark},]{.underline} [**which [discourages a
critical consciousness]{.mark}**, the [creation of]{.mark}
what]{.underline} Sylvia [Wynter]{.underline} (2003: 318) [calls
"bio-economic man."]{.underline} What are [the temporal effects of
[neoliberalization within the university]{.mark}]{.underline}? The first
[is the [imposition of a linear]{.mark} quantification [of work
time]{.mark}]{.underline} (Herzfeld 2009: 111) **[that [insists on the
agency]{.mark} of time [with relation to (academic)
production]{.mark}]{.underline}**. There is a particular often
fast-paced, always regimented, and end-product-driven tempo to the
expectations on student, staff, and workers. Thus the curriculum,
[research output,]{.underline} and outsourcing [can all be mapped on a
market matrix in which individuals are reconfigured as economic
units]{.underline}, which under [[neoliberal managerial]{.mark}
practices [must achieve certain objectives to
survive]{.mark}]{.underline}. In the crudest way, time equals money, as
learning objectives, publications, promotion, and so on are given
monetary value (Davies and Bansel 2005: 48). Institutional funding,
rankings, and prestige are tied to the optimum use of time understood as
students finishing degrees on time (regardless of the quality of those
degrees), academics [[meeting research]{.mark} quotas ([regardless
of]{.mark} the [socio]{.mark}political [relevance]{.mark} of that
research]{.underline}), and managers and administrative staffs'
[efficient [imposition of regulation, control, standardization, and
pressure]{.mark}]{.underline}. In this schema "time is the enemy not the
neoliberal system that generates unequal, impossible expectations" (49).
What is the impact of neoliberal temporality within the university on
black students and workers?

#### Marxism's attempt to attach a universal telos to politics requires a patholigization of failed movements as misdirecting our revolutionary energy which is proven by the way in which they weaponized Marxism against anti-racist movements, this ignores that planning must always outmaneuver systems of power

**Harney and Moten 13**(Stefano, Professor of Strategic Management
Education at Singapore Management University; Fred, Professor of
Performance Studies at New York University *The Undercommons: Fugitive
Planning and Black Study*)//NotJacob

The hope that Cornel West wrote about in 1984 was not destined to become
what we call 'policy.' The ones who practiced it, within and against the
grain of every imposed contingency, always had a plan. In and out of the
depths of Reaganism, against the backdrop and by way of a resuscitory
irruption into politics that Jesse Jackson could be said to have both
symbolised and quelled, something West indexes as black radicalism,
which "hopes against hope...in order to survive in the deplorable
present," asserts a metapolitical surrealism that sees and sees through
the evidence of mass incapacity, cutting the despair it breeds.
Exuberantly metacritical hope has always exceeded every immediate
circumstance in its incalculably varied everyday enactments of the
fugitive art of social life. [This art is practiced on and over the edge
of politics, beneath its ground, in animative and improvisatory
decomposition of its inert body. It emerges as an ensemblic stand, a
kinetic set of positions, but also takes the form of
embodied]{.underline} [notation, study, score]{.underline}. Its encoded
noise is hidden in plain sight from the ones who refuse to see and hear
-- even while placing under constant surveillance -- the thing whose
repressive imitation they call for and are. Now, more than a quarter
century after West's analysis, and after an intervening iteration that
had the nerve to call hope home while serially disavowing it and helping
to extend and prepare its almost total eclipse, the remains of American
politics exudes hope once again. [Having seemingly lost its redoubled
edge while settling in and for the carceral techniques of the
possible]{.underline}, having thereby unwittingly become the privileged
mode of expression of a kind of despair, [[hope appears now simply to be
a matter of policy]{.underline}]{.mark}. [Policy]{.underline}, on the
other hand, [now comes into view as no simple matter.]{.underline} [What
we are calling policy is the new form command takes as command takes
hold.]{.underline} It has been [noted that with new uncertainties in how
and where surplus value is generated]{.underline}, and how and where it
will be generated next, [economic mechanisms of compulsion have been
replaced by directly political forms.]{.underline} Of course [for the
colonial subject this change is no change as Fanon
understood;]{.underline} and as Nahum Chandler has pointed out, [[the
problem of the color line is neither a matter of]{.mark} a new nor an
old [primitive accumulation]{.mark}]{.underline}. The problem is nothing
other than the way [the difference between labor and capital remains
prior to its remainder and is made abundant or into
abundance.]{.underline} Moreover what we are calling policy comes into
view now not because management has failed in the workplace, where it
proliferates as never before, but because economic management cannot win
the battle that rages in the realm of social reproduction. Here
[management encounters forms of what we will call planning that resist
its every effort to impose a compulsion of scarcity through seizing the
means of social reproduction. In the undercommons of the social
reproductive realm the means, which is to say the planners, are still
part of the plan]{.underline}[.]{.mark} [And the plan is to invent the
means in a common experiment launched from any kitchen, any back porch,
any basement, any hall, any park bench, any improvised party, every
night.]{.underline} [This ongoing experiment with the informal, carried
out by and on the means of social reproduction, as the to come of the
forms of life, is what we mean by planning[; planning in the
undercommons is not an activity]{.mark},]{.underline} [not fishing or
dancing or teaching or loving, [but the ceaseless experiment with the
futurial presence of the forms of life that make such activities
possible.]{.mark} [It is these means that were eventually stolen
by]{.mark}]{.underline}, in having been willingly given up to, [[state
socialism whose perversion of planning was a crime second only to the
deployment of policy in today's command economy]{.underline}]{.mark}. Of
course, the old forms of command have never gone away. [The carceral
state is still in effect and strategic wars on drugs, youth, violence,
and terrorism have even given way to logistic wars of drones and
credit.]{.underline} But horrible as such state command remains[, [it
now deputises and delegates its power to seemingly countless and utterly
accountable and accounted for agents]{.mark} who perform contemporary
internal versions of the knightriders [and settlers]{.mark} of earlier
state violence deputisations.]{.underline} Or rather, since nightriders
and settlers never really went away, deputised for segregation,
anti-communism, migration, and nuclear family heteropatriarchy in much
of the Global North, what policy represents is a new weapon in the hands
of these citizen-deputies. Stand your ground -- because man was not born
to run away, because his color won't run, because again and again [[the
settler must incant the disavowal and target the epidermalised trace of
his own desire for refuge]{.underline}]{.mark} -- is only the most
notorious iteration of this renewed dispersal and [deputisation of state
violence, aimed into the fugitive, ambling neighbourhoods of the
undercommons.]{.underline} Content neither with abandoning the realm of
social reproduction nor conditioning it for the workplace, the two
always related moves of the relative autonomy of the capitalist state,
today capital wants in[. It has glimpsed the value of social
reproduction and wants control of the means, and no longer just by
converting them into productivities within formal industrialisations of
care, food, education, sex, etc. but by gaining access to and directly
controlling the informal experiment with the social reproduction of life
itself.]{.underline} [To do this, it has to break up the ongoing plans
of the undercommons]{.underline}. And here, with bitter irony, is where
the hope West could still speak of in 1984, which has subsequently gone
back underground, is conjured as an image whose fecklessness is also its
monstrosity. What we talk about, in its survival, as planning appears,
in its waning, as hope, which has been deployed against us in ever more
perverted and reduced form by the Clinton/Obama axis for much of the
last twenty years. [[Planning is self-suffciency at the social
level]{.mark}, and it reproduces in its experiment not just what it
needs, life, but what it wants, life in difference, in the play of the
general antagonism.]{.underline} [Planning starts from the solidity, the
continuity, and the rest of this social self-sufficiency, though it does
not end there in having placed all these complex motion.]{.underline}
[It begins]{.underline}, as this disruption of beginning, [with what we
might call a militant preservation.]{.underline} And these are its
means. [[Policy deputises those willing to]{.mark}, those who come to
want to[, break up these means as a way of controlling them]{.mark}, as
once it was necessary to de-skill a worker in a factory by breaking up
his means of production]{.underline}. And it does this by diagnosing the
planners[. [Policy says that those who plan have something wrong with
them]{.mark}, something deeply -- ontologically -- [wrong with
them]{.mark}.]{.underline} [This is the first thrust of policy as
dispersed, deputised command]{.underline}. What's wrong with them? They
won't change. [[They won't embrace change. They've lost hope]{.mark}. So
say the policy deputies]{.underline}. They need to be given hope[. They
need to see that change is the only option.]{.underline} By change what
the [policy deputies mean is contingency, risk, flexibility, and
adaptability to the groundless ground of the hollow capitalist subject,
in the realm of automatic subjection that is capital.]{.underline}
Policy is thus arrayed in the exclusive and exclusionary uniform/ity of
contingency as imposed consensus, which both denies and at the very same
time seeks to destroy the ongoing plans, the fugitive initiations, the
black operations, of the multitude. As resistance from above, [policy is
a new class phenomenon because the act of making policy for others, of
pronouncing others as incorrect, is at the same time an audition for a
post-fordist economy that deputies believe rewards those who embrace
change but which, in reality, arrests them in contingency, flexibility,
and that administered precarity that imagines itself to be immune from
what Judith Butler might call our undercommon
precariousness]{.underline}. [This economy is powered by constant and
automatic insistence upon the externalisation of risk, the placement at
an externally imposed risk of all life, so that work against risk can be
harvested without end.]{.underline}

### AT: Historical Materialism---2AC 

#### **Marxists get historical materialism wrong -- anti-blackness [codes]{.underline} capitalist modernity, and *only* anti-blackness can explain the stripping of [social life]{.underline} and [social reproduction]{.underline} that inscribe blackness as [bare]{.underline} labor** 

**Nolin, 17** -- Rachel Elin, PhD Candidate (English) @ UConn, "The End
of Bare Life?" Journal of American Studies, Volume 51, Issue 3 August
2017, E33, pg. Cambridge University Press Cambridge Core -- iowa debate

Whereas Weheliye and Cervenak are interested in forging a new heuristic
of human identity that recognizes the practices of freedom contingent on
circumstances of oppression, Dillon examines how "intentional
performances of excess" (199) enabled enslaved people to achieve both
visibility and cultural influence in the Atlantic world. New World Drama
begins in the mid-seventeenth century with the advent of popular
sovereignty in England, an ideological ascendency that developed
alongside the enclosure of "the commons": land and natural resources
held in common by the people as a body. Beginning with this dual
development, [Dillon suggests that emerging conceptions of the commons
as a political force at this time accrued new popular and material
significance. Political rights and material embodiment, she argues,
became entwined, forming a new public that was powerfully expressed in
the space of the eighteenth-century transatlantic theatre.]{.underline}
The new commoning and collective practices examined here engage and
ultimately dispute both Agamben and the recent contributions of Michel
Hardt and Antonio Negri, particularly their concerns with the
biopolitical power of the "multitude" over and against "the republic of
property." 6 But [[unlike earlier assessments of]{.mark} the
relationship between popular sovereignty and [capitalist logics, Dillon
is concerned with]{.mark} the practices of political freedom that are
foreclosed by [discourses that focus on the centrality of
property]{.mark}]{.underline}. Through a critique of Hardt and Negri\'s
account of the exploitation and ultimate erasure of the multitude, New
World Drama calls attention to colonial relations. [Complementing
Weheliye, [Dillon theorizes "**relationality**" as a geopolitical
interaction that **underlies capitalist modernity** and locates
"colonialist racialization" as the "**bedrock**]{.mark} of an
expropriative biopolitics from the late seventeenth century forward to
today"]{.underline} (8). This leads to one of the more striking
innovations in the book, a critique of Agamben that builds upon the
identity-politics critique. ["[Bare labor]{.mark}," Dillon\'s term,
[describes the dispossessions of property and labor that underlie the
economies of ownership]{.mark} advanced by metropolitan and Creole
Europeans. [It is a construction of abjection]{.mark} that Dillon sees
portrayed in transatlantic newspapers that were **[sustained by the
trade of slaves]{.mark}** and visually portrayed on the transatlantic
stage. Extracted by "technologies of violence," [bare labor is
**distinct from Marxian concepts**]{.mark} of proletarian struggle.
[Rather, it theorizes a mode of labor that is "**stripped of the
resources of social life and the capacity for social
reproduction**]{.mark}]{.underline}" (28). Importantly, though, bare
labor allows for sociality. For Dillon, it is impossible to step fully
outside the social. Social life is tied explicitly to material life and
perfomative life. The figure of the "black dandy," in particular, flies
in the face of bare labor and erasure. Exceeding European codes through
sartorial performance, this figure suggests how the "abject" objects of
enslaved labor disaggregated themselves from hegemonic authority. Fabric
fashioned into clothing, Dillon argues, serves as "both stuff and
signifier, textile and text" (196). Through these intersections -- of
labor, materiality, performance -- individual people create new forms of
sociality. It is noteworthy that [the most compelling critiques
of]{.underline} Foucault, Agamben, and [the Continental approach to
liberalism\'s flaws have come from scholars attentive to the
intersectional potentials of race, gender, and identity.]{.underline}
Across this body of scholarship speaking back to Agambian critiques of
the liberal state, discourses of performativity emerge as a particularly
vital tool for arbitrating the production of liberal narratives that
have proved seriously disabling for populations supposedly situated
beyond the discursive ambit of "the human." As each of these texts
suggests, this narrow construction of the human was never
straightforward, but rather, to quote Cervenak, decidedly "crooked"
(14). These are not arguments for an expansion of liberal humanism.
Rather, in different ways, each scholar exposes the flaws of
philosophical narratives resting on the possibility of a pre-social,
politically undefined (non)humanity. In contesting the philosophical
foundations of "bare-life" discourses, [these texts radically
denaturalize the conditions of oppression and promote an exciting
intellectual commitment to imagining freedom differently.]{.underline}

### AT: Movements---2AC 

#### Progressive movements are racist 

**Ervin 16** Lorenzo Kom\'boa Ervin is an American writer, activist, and
black anarchist. He is a former member of the Black Panther Party and
Concerned Citizens for Justice, The Progressive Plantation: racism
inside white radical social change groups
<http://blogs.lse.ac.uk/lsereviewofbooks/2017/01/04/book-review-vulnerability-in-resistance-edited-by-judith-butler-zeynep-gambetti-and-leticia-sabsay/>

What all this brought forcibly home to me is how corrupt, hypocritical
and racist this movement was. The truth is that paciﬁsts and [[Leftists
make the worst kinds of racists, because they posture as anti-racists
and "friends" of Black people.]{.underline}]{.mark} This woman, Jane,
even hypocritically sneered that she used to support the Black Panther
Party back in the 1960's, which meant absolutely nothing to me. But this
is a reﬂection of how they truly believe that because they are paciﬁst
radicals that they cannot practice or harbor racism in their movements.
It is the worst form of self-deception. [They have swallowed the
illusion that their consciousness [as white social justice activists,
around a white middle class agenda]{.mark}]{.underline}, is liberating
for all. [They do not accept that [they themselves are racists, and have
merely replicated the same social oppressions inside their movements
that the larger society does]{.mark}]{.underline}, and that the only
differences are to degree and form[. [Progressives]{.mark} [make the
worst kinds of racists because they want you to believe that every vile
racist act they perform is a good service by "good white
people]{.mark}]{.underline}". Well, with "friends" like these who needs
enemies? They uphold racism, middle class reactionary politics, and
exist on corporate grant money like the parasites they are. I did not
realize at the time, how many of these pacifist peace and justice
centers there were. It seems that every state has at least one. They all
have the same kind of politics and approach, and encapsulate paciﬁst
views of radicalism. [[They are]{.underline}]{.mark} also [[infested
with]{.mark} the same kind of internal [racism]{.mark}. It is literally
hell for peoples of color to work at such institutions, along with other
white social justice non-proﬁt groups. [They]{.mark} are literally
enemies of the people, a do-gooder front, to [carry out Liberal
Left-wing politics for the governments]{.mark}]{.underline} and
corporations. They are paid handsomely by capitalist social change
foundations with rich peoples' money, the scraps they give to keep the
"restless natives" under control. House Niggers of the Left Since the
white progressive groups do not really unite with the various liberation
struggles of peoples of color, they must give the illusion of sympathy.
Thus [[they]{.mark} hire [Black]{.mark} or Brown [faces]{.mark}, and
have them]{.underline} posture as a full member of the group, and to
[act as their representative in the Black community]{.underline}. Thus
they hire Black or Brown faces, and have them posture as a full member
of the group, to speak up when they are attacked over their duplicity
and racism. During chattel slavery, the white plantation owner had a
privileged class of "house negroes", who did the master's bidding at
every turn, and united with the master to such a degree that they
protected him from the other slaves, the 'ﬁeld negroes", and saw
themselves as part of the master's household. In return, they got better
clothing, food and housing, and more privileges than the common ﬁeld
slaves. After a time, they did not even believe that they were slaves,
but rather a butler or "manservant" to this rich white man, who
exploited Black labor, misery, and suffering for a proﬁt, but treated
them "ﬁne". The master referred to them as house niggers, even to their
faces. Now, [on the Progressive Plantation, this same kind of racist
dynamic is in play. These progressive groups hire Black and other
peoples of color, [to use them as a foil against the Black]{.mark}/POC
[communities]{.mark}]{.underline}. They are hired as administrators or
spokespersons for a majority white organization, and are to protect the
master's interest at all time, even if it conﬂicts with his/her own or
their community's best interests. These people have no power within the
organization, and are expected to be a complete puppet, just for sake of
a paycheck or for recognition from white people. Many settle for that. I
refused to be one who did. It needs to also be recognized that [the
radical socialist]{.underline} and Anarchist [movements have the same
kinds of ﬁgures of color]{.underline}, who perform the same role. [They
are slaves on the white radical plantation,]{.underline} have no voice
and tolerate all kinds of abuse, just to be part of the movement. It is
an unhealthy, oppressive relationship, which reﬂects white domination of
the movement. It is an example of ideological imperialism, the practice
of which must be recognized and smashed within the Left. But what is
ideological imperialism? We are talking about imperialism, a system of
social, economic, political and economic domination by an external power
elite, \[could be another nation-state\], in this instance [a class of
upper class white peoples organized into an activist

#### Their retreat into party politics reifies the principles of liberal democracy that secure capitalism in the present -- attempting to generate community among workers reproduces the violence inherent to community formations themselves. Only dwelling in the debt that's created from the improvisation of the use of each other can produce revolutionary moments.

It's also good timing that you wrote to me about this comment I made to
you in an earlier conversation because [I just finished a terrific book
called]{.underline} [*Dixie Be
Damned*](https://www.akpress.org/dixie-be-damned.html) [by Neal Shirley
and Saralee Stafford. They write about insurrections in the South from
the dismal swamp in the 18^th^ century to a 1975 uprising in a North
Carolina women's prison]{.underline}. It's stirring stuff and then in a
really sound, clear-hearted concluding chapter they surprised me. They
said **[[our enemies have been saved not by fascism but by
democracy.]{.underline}]{.mark}** It should not have surprised me, given
that we were just speaking about Du Bois and democratic despotism, but
it did. They are right. And I think it is in this sense that a better
university would be worse for us, has been worse for us, in a
paradoxical way. Some ask, 'Is another university possible?' Well, that
implies this one is possible but more than that it suggests another
university would be better for us. I don't know about that. This is not
to say I do not find work like that of Marc Bousquet and Chris Newfield
indispensable. I do. But [there is something at stake in Shirley and
Stafford's book and I want to talk with you about it because I think it
connects to your question about how the Undercommons book has been read
and used]{.underline}. [The authors quote Frank Wilderson on the way
**[blackness can never be disimbricated from the violence of
slavery.]{.mark}** Then they say: '**Those who would risk extending
solidarity across racial boundaries would find themselves the recipient
of exemplary violence in order to instill fear of constant consequence
for this treason. [Ever after, *meaningful cross-racial affinity can
only be found in moments of revolutionary
violence*.]{.mark}**["]{.mark}]{.underline}  (Italics in the
original.)Now this is an historical observation on their part, but to
some extent it is also programmatic  for the authors. As an observation,
well, they have just convinced me of its validity in the last 250 pages,
and as program, well, [[I'm not a pacifist. **I'm for self-defense, and
that can be violent.**]{.mark} **But do words like solidarity, affinity,
to say nothing of the unlovely term allyship, accidentally preserve
something we want to abolish?**]{.underline} And I feel bad using
Shirley and Stafford to make this point because theirs is such a good
book, but maybe that's why I feel compelled to say, '[even here' this
question comes up]{.underline}. What I mean is [**who is this someone in
[solidarity with blackness,]{.mark} who is this ally of blackness, who
is this someone with affinity to black struggle**? I think this [means
that]{.mark} this [someone has his or her own struggles and is
indicating that now she or he wants to join not in common struggles, but
in the struggles of blackness.]{.mark} Because in a sense you have to
have your own thing to be an ally or to be in solidarity.]{.underline}
[Ok, but what are your own struggles from which you would be offering
solidarity, allyship, affinity?]{.underline} **[Are you organizing in
the white community, is that it? I think that is the
implication]{.underline}**, that you have been working in white
communities, and/or on the environment, or feminist issues, etc. But the
problem is, [**there's no such thing as a white community. [A white
community is a contradiction in terms]{.mark}**, an oxymoron. **[You
can't organize an oxymoron. The only thing you can do with a white
community is]{.mark} work to [abolish
it]{.mark}**[.]{.mark}]{.underline} Moreover [at that point of abolition
we may be able to say there is no such thing as a community, that a
community is an oxymoron. You can't commune and have a community.
**[Communing is anti-community. It's undercommon.]{.mark}**]{.underline}
Maybe the only kind of community that is possible is the maroon
community, because it is by definition not a community, and when in some
historical instances (of necessity even) it became one, it took on the
same murderous qualities of any community. Okay, so then the question
arising, if you do abolish the white community, what of the people who
were marked as white, and in many cases who dwelt in the supremacy of
whiteness, what becomes of them? Well, in the practice of abolition they
will move closer to the only thing they ever had that was about life and
not death, about love and not hate, blackness. **[This is to say, people
who present as white are not allies, or in solidarity, or showing
affinity, because they have nothing of their own, no place from which to
show this, no resource to bring, unless and until they embrace the one
thing of their own they disown.]{.underline} [The thing that can't be
owned *born(e)* of the owned, blackness.]{.underline}** [Now **white
people aren't coming with much blackness, by definition.** And this is
why the underlying humility motivating terms like ally, solidarity, and
affinity is not misplaced, if that is indeed what underlies their use in
practice. In any case, **[whiteness is either absence or violence,
and]{.mark} in either case, [not much to offer as an ally.]{.mark} But
on the other hand [white people have a big role to play]{.mark}**
[in]{.mark} the [revolutionary violence]{.mark} Shirley and Stafford
speak of **[because the act of abolition of white communities is a
monumental task.]{.mark}**]{.underline} By contrast and in a sense to
reverse while also honouring Wilderson's initial point, Black people
have for the very reason of this unrelenting violence and its brutal
failure, a lot of blackness, if I can put it that way, a special,
(under) privileged relationship to blackness, as Fred puts it. So
another way to think of the historical events Shirley and Stafford are
speaking about as cross-racial moments would be to think about these
events as moments in which there was not a total coincidence between
black people and blackness. In a way we could read moments of
non-coincidence as moments not of liberation from blackness but
generalization of blackness. But we have to be careful here.
**[Blackness is neither the opposite nor the total reversal or abolition
of whiteness.]{.underline}** [Blackness exists in/as the general
antagonism. It's always anti-colonial, always fugitive.]{.underline} So
what we tried to do in the book is to think about how [[study, and
planning,]{.mark} and logisticality, and hapticality [named capacities
for expanding]{.mark} the social poesis of blackness, of [the
anti-regulatory, jurisgenerative improvisation of the use of each
other.]{.mark}]{.underline} And we were thinking about how [[the
undercommons of study might be a place where those in blackness and
those coming into blackness might commune]{.mark}, might serve the debt
together, [in difference **but not separability**]{.mark}]{.underline},
as might say, not separability [from that quantum blackness that moves
across and against property, subjectivity, development,
usufruction.]{.underline} And if you want to say **[[this is going to be
a practice that is hard for a lot of people who do not experience the
lived fact of the coincidence of being a black person and blackness, and
it is going to be a humble practice, and even a practice of entering
into service,]{.mark} feeling in debt, [well that's okay, cause all of
that is what blackness is too.]{.mark}]{.underline}**

### AT: Worker's Party---2AC 

#### Capitalism is not bounded by the exploitation of labor but extends itself through a productive imperative and the expropriation of land from the Native and the body of the slave. Their appeal to a transition state established by a worker's party \[insert their alternative\] strengthens systems of state-based theft, racial accumulation and policing because the state requires these formations in order to function.

Racial Capitalism and Settler Colonialism Given the dual character of
capitalist accumulation identified by both Rosa Luxemburg and David
Harvey, what new understanding of capitalism would be generated by
focusing on dispossession and expropriation over .work and production?
Contemporary political theorists as well as critical ethnic studies,
black studies, and Native studies scholars and activists analyze how
racial slavery and seeder colonialism provide the material and
territorial foundation for U.S. and Canadian sovereignty. Rather than
casting slavery and Native genocide as temporally circumscribed events
chat inaugurated the birth of capitalism in the New World (\"primitive
accumulation\"), they show how the racial logics produced by these
processes persist to this day: [In order to recuperate the frame of
political economy, [a focus on the dialectic of racial slavery and
settler colonialism leads to important revisions of Karl Marx\'s
theory]{.mark} of primitive accumulation]{.underline}. In particular,
Marx designates the transition from feudal to capitalist social
relations as a violent process of primitive accumulation whereby
\"conquest, enslavement, robbery, murder, in short, force, play the
greatest part.\" For Marx, chis results in the expropriation of the
worker, the proletariat, who becomes the privileged subject of
capitalist revolution. \[f we consider primitive accumulation 35 a
persistent structure rather than event, both [Afro-pessimism and settler
colonial studies destabilize normative conceptions of capitalism through
the conceptual displacements of the proletariat[.]{.mark}]{.underline}
As Coulthard demonstrates, in considering Indigenous peoples in relation
to primitive accumulation, \"it appears that the history and experience
of dispossession, not proletarianization, has been the dominant
background structure shaping the character of the historical
relationship between Indigenous peoples and the Canadian state.\" [It is
thus dispossession of land through genocidal elimination, relocation,
and theft that animates Indigenous resistance and
anticapitalism]{.underline} and \"less around our emergent status 35
\'rightless proletarians.\'\" If we extend the frame of primitive
accumulation to the question of slavery, [it is the dispossession of the
slave\'s body rather than the proletarianization of labor that both
precedes and exceeds the frame of settler colonial and global
modernity.]{.underline} 13 [As lyko Day notes, Native dispossession
occurs through the expropriation of land, while black dis􀄅 possession is
characterized by enslavement and bodily dispossession.]{.underline}
Although [both [racial logics buttress white accumulation and are
defined by a \"genocidal limit concept\"]{.mark}]{.underline} that
constitutes these subjects as disposable, Day notes that \"the racial
content of Indigenous peoples is the mirror opposite of blackness. From
the beginning, an eliminatory project was driven to reduce Native
populations through genocidal wars and later through statistical
elimination through blood quantum and assimilationist policies. For
slaves, an opposite logic of exclusion was driven to increase, not
eliminate, the population of slaves.\"14 A debate has ensued in critical
ethnic studies about which axis of dispossession is capitalism\'s
condition of possibility: the expropriation of Native land or chattel
slavery? Was the U.S. made possible primarily by unbridled access to
black labor, or through territorial conquest? Is the global racial order
defined-as Day writes-primarily by the indigenous-settler binary or the
black-nonblack binary? At stake in this debate is the question of which
axis of dispossession is the \"base\" from which the \"superstructures\"
of economy, national sovereignty, or even subjectivity itself emerge.
Those who argue that settler colonialism is central have sometimes made
the claim that even black Americans participate in settler colonialism
and indigenous displacement by continuing to live on stolen land, while
those who center slavery and antiblackness have sometimes viewed Native
Americans as perpetrators of anriblackness insofar as some uibes have
historically owned slaves and seek state recognition by making
land-based claims to sovereignty-a claim that relies on a political
grammar that black Americans do not have access to, as slaves were rem
from their native lands when they were transported co the Americas (see
Jared Sexton\'s \"The Vel of Slavery\"). Although weighing in on this
debate is beyond rhe scope of this essay, I generally agree with Day\'s
assertion that to treat this set of issues as a zero-sum game obfuscates
the complexity of these processes. With that said, it is important to
note that this book deals primarily with the antiblack dimensions of
prisons, police, and racial capitalism, though I acknowledge that
analyses of settler colonialism are equally vital to understanding the
operations of racial capitalism and how race is produced through
multiple expropriative logics. Gendered Expropriation Though this book
focuses primarily on black racialization in a contemporary context, it
is worth noting that expropriation reproduces multiple categories of
difference\--including the man-woman gender binary. Although categories
of difference were not invented by capitalism, expropriative processes
assign particular meanings to categories of difference. \"Woman\" is
reproduced as inferior through the unwaged theft of her labor, while the
esteem of the category of \"man\" is propped up by the valorization of
his labor. Even when women are in the professional workforce, they are
still vulnerable to expropriation when they are given or take on work
beyond their formal duties-whether it\'s washing the dishes at the
office, mentoring students, or doing thankless administrative work while
male colleagues gee the \"dysfunctional genius\" pass. But above all,
gendered expropriation occurs through the extraction of care labor,
emotional labor, as well as domestic and reproductive labor all of which
is enabled by the enforcement of a rigid gender binary. This system is
propped up by gender socialization, which compels women to
psychologically internalize a feeling of responsibility for others.
Although, at a glance, ic might seem that the expropriation of women\'s
labor happens primarily through housewifeitization, the marriage
contract, and the assignment of child-care duties to women, in the
current epoch-characterized by an aging baby boomer population and a
shortage of geriatric health-care workers-women are increasingly filling
this void by taking care of sick parents, family members, and loved
ones. It is hardly surprising that two-thirds of those who care for
chose with Alzheimer\'s disease are women, even as women are the primary
victims of this disease. Given thac women\'s lives are often interrupted
by both childcare duties and caring for ailing family members, it\'s
also hardly surprising that women accumulate many fewer assets and arc
more likely to retire into poverty than their male counterparts. A
recent report found that the European Union gender pension gap was 40
percent, which far exceeds the gender pay gap of 16 percent. Overall,
gender is a material relation that, among other things, bilks women of
their futures. The aged woman who has toiled by caring for others is
left with little by the end of her life. Though gender distinctions are
maintained through expropriative processes, they also have consequences
beyond the economic and material realm. While it could be said that
disposability is the logic that corresponds to racialized expropriation,
gendered subjectivation has as its corollary rapeability. It also goes
without saying that these expropriative logics are not mutually
exclusive, as nonwhite women and gender-nonconforming people may be
subject to a different set of expropriative logics than white women.
Racalized Expropriation Although I do not claim that expropriation
should be defined exclusively as racialization (again, because different
expropriative logics reproduce multiple categories of difference), this
book deals primarily with the antiblack racial order that is produced by
late-capitalist accumulation. Michael C. Dawson and Nancy Fraser are two
contemporary political theorists who have defined expropriation as a
racializing process in capitalist societies. In \"Hidden in Plain
Sight,\" Dawson takes Fraser to task for not acknowledging racialized
expropriation as one of the \"background domains\" of capitalist
society. [[Understanding the logic of expropriation]{.mark}, in his
view, [is necessary for understanding which modes of resistance are
needed at this historical juncture.]{.mark}]{.underline} His article
begins with a meditation on the question: Should activists and movements
such as Black Lives Matter focus on racialized state violence (police
shootings, mass incarceration, and so forth), or should they focus on
racialized inequality cawed by expropriation and exploitation? What is
the relationship between the first logic-characterized by
disposability-and the second logic-characterized by exploitability and
expropriability? Rather than describing these logics as distinct forms
of antiblack racism, he analyzes them as two dimensions of a dynamic
process whereby [[capitalist expropriation generates the racial order by
fracturing the population]{.mark} into superior and inferior humans:
Understanding the foundation of capitalism requires a consideration of
\"the hidden abode of race\": the ontological distinction between
superior and inferior humans-codified as race-that was necessary for
slavery, colonialism, the theft of lands in the Americas, and
genocide.]{.underline} This racial separation is manifested in the
division between full humans who possess the right to sell their labor
and compete within markets, and chose that are disposable, discriminated
against, and ultimately either eliminated or superexploited.15 [[Black
racialization]{.mark}, then, [is the mark that renders subjects as
suitable for]{.mark}-on the one hand-[hyperexploitation and
expropriation, and]{.mark}, on the other hand, [annihilation.]{.mark}
Before the neoliberal era, the racial order was propped up by the state,
and racial distinctions were enforced through legal codification, Jim
Crow segregation, and other formal arrangements. In a contemporary
context, though the legal regime undergirding the racial order has been
dismantled, [race has maintained]{.mark} its dual character, which
consists of \"not only a probabilistic [assignment of]{.mark} relative
[economic value but also an index of]{.mark} differential
[vulnerability]{.mark} to state violence.\" 16 In other words,
vulnerability to [hyperexploitation and expropriation in the economic
domain and]{.mark} vulnerability to [premature death in the political
and social domains.]{.mark}]{.underline} My essay on the [Ferguson
Police Department and [the city\'s program of municipal
plunder]{.mark}]{.underline} is an attempt to [[make visible the]{.mark}
hidden [backdrop of Mike Brown\'s execution: the]{.mark} widespread
[racialized expropriation of black residents carried out by the criminal
justice arm of the state.]{.mark} It is not just that Mike Brown\'s
murder happened alongside the looting of residents at the behest of the
police and the city\'s financial manager, but that [racial legacies that
have marked black residents as lootable are intimately tied to police
officers\' treatment of black people as killable.]{.mark} The two logics
reinforce and are bound up with each other.]{.underline} In her response
co Dawson\'s analysis of racialization as expropriation, Fraser develops
Dawson\'s claims by looking at the interplay between economic
expropriation and \"politically enforced status distinctions.\" 17 [Not
only does [accumulation in a capitalist society occur along]{.mark} the
two axes of [exploitation and expropriation,]{.mark} but [one makes the
other possible]{.mark} in that [the \"racialized subjection of those
whom capital expropriates is a condition of possibility for the freedom
of those whom it exploits.]{.mark}]{.underline}\" 18 [In other words,
the \"front story\" of [free workers]{.mark} who are [contracted by
capitalists to sell their labor-power for a wage]{.mark} is enabled by,
and [depends on, expropriation]{.mark} that takes place [outside this
contractual arrangement.]{.mark}]{.underline} Fraser further extends
Dawson\'s analysis by offering a historical account of the various
regimes of racialization. In her analysis of the \"proletarianization\"
of black Americans as they migrated from the South to industrial centers
in the North and Midwest during the flrst half of the twentieth century,
she points out that even in the context of industrial \"exploitation,\"
the segmented labor market was organized such that a \"confiscatory
premium was placed on black labor.\" Black industrial workers were paid
less than their white counterparts. In some sense, the racialized gap in
earnings can be thought of as the portion that was expropriated from
black workers. It is not as though the black laborers who joined the
ranks of the industrial proletariat were newly subjected to exploitation
rather than expropriation, but that these two methods of accumulation
were operating in tandem. [[In the \"present regime of racialized
accumulation]{.mark}\"- which she refers to as \"[financialized
capitalism\"-]{.mark}Fraser notes that there has been a loosening of the
binary that has historically separated who should be subjected to
expropriation from]{.underline} who should be subjected to exploitation,
and that [during the present period]{.underline}, debt is regularly
deployed as a method of dispossession: Much large-scale industrial
exploitation now occurs outside the historic core, in the BRICS
countries of the semi-periphery. And [expropriation []{.mark}has become
ubiquitous, afflicting [not only its traditional subjects but also those
who were previously shielded by their status as
citizenworkers.]{.mark}]{.underline} In these developments, debt plays a
major role, [as global financial institutions pressure states to collude
with investors in extracting value from defenseless
populations.]{.underline} 19 While I agree with Fraser\'s claim that the
\"sharp divide\" berween \"expropriab le subjects and exploitable
citizen-workers\" has been replaced by a \"contin uum\" (albeit a
continuum chat remains racialized), I would add that [the existence of
poor whites who have fallen out of the middle class or have been
affected by the opiate crisis at the present juncture represents not
racial progress for black Americans, but the generalization of
expropriability as a condition in the face of an accumulation crisis. In
other words, immiseration for all rather than a growing respect for
black Americans.]{.underline} Fraser rightly points out that
\"expropriation becomes tempting in periods of crisis.\"20 Sometimes the
methods of accumulation that were once reserved exclusively for
racialized subjects bleed over and are used on those with privileged
status markings. [[If expropriation and exploitation now occur on a
continuum]{.mark}, then [it has been made possible]{.mark}, in part,
[by]{.mark} late capitalism\'s current modus operandi: [the
probabilistic ranking of subjects according to
risk]{.mark}]{.underline}, sometimes indexed by a person\'s credit
score. As I will demonstrate in the coming sections, this method is not
a race-neutral way of gleaning information about a subject\'s personal
integrity, credibility, or financial responsibility. It is merely an
index of already-existing inequality and a way to distinguish between
which people should be expropriated from and which should be merely
exploited.
