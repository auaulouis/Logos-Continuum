#### Hegemony is strong now -- international structures & power distribution remain durable

Despite everything that has happened, [if we reject the counsels of the
new "realism" and resume our support for the liberal world order, it is
still within our capacity to defend it and put off its
collapse,]{.underline} perhaps for quite some time. **[Today the order
remains intact, despite the hostility of the present administration and
the weakness of the last.]{.underline}** **[The international structures
supporting it are durable]{.underline}**. This is partly [because they
rest on geographical realities and a distribution of power that still
favor the liberal order and]{.underline} still [pose obstacles to those
who would disrupt it]{.underline}. It is also because [liberal
values,]{.underline} though under assault, [remain a force that binds
the democratic nations of the world together.]{.underline}
Authoritarianism also has its appeal and will always compete with
liberalism, but the [authoritarian governments do not feel the same
sense of commonality as]{.underline} the monarchies and aristocracies of
the early nineteenth century. [The Chinese and Russians]{.underline} are
not adversaries, but they [are not allies]{.underline} either. They
share little except their antipathy to liberalism. [The democratic
nations, however, are bound together]{.underline} by more than common
adversaries, as the post--Cold War era has proved. [America's alliances
in Europe and Asia have so far held]{.underline}, therefore, [despite
the weakening of America's commitment under two administrations. **There
is still a liberal world order to be salvaged**]{.underline}, if the
American people decide it is worth salvaging.

#### Arms sales are key to American hegemony -- they protect influence and check rising powers but the aff reverses that

Institution and a Senior Managing Director at Cerberus, a global leader

More Weapons,\" WSJ,
https://www.wsj.com/articles/america-needs-to-sell-more-weapons-1530477651)

[America's arms-sales policies are too restrictive, leading even some
pro-U.S. countries to buy weapons from Russia and China]{.underline}.
This year's National Defense Authorization Act would give Defense
Secretary Jim Mattis authority to waive certain new restrictions for
specific countries enacted by Congress last year. But the problem is
more fundamental: [The U.S. arms-sale regime needs to be recalibrated to
protect American influence in a highly competitive geopolitical
environment.]{.underline} The U.S. government blocks weapons sales to
foreign countries for various reasons. Congress is often wary of selling
arms to countries that could use them to undermine civil liberties. The
Defense Department often worries the purchasing country could allow
sensitive U.S. technology to fall into the wrong hands. The State
Department arms-control bureau has a general aversion to any weapons
proliferation on grounds that it could trigger an arms race. These are
valid concerns. But [as Russia and China actively pursue weapons sales
as part of an aggressive strategy to expand their spheres of influence,
U.S. strategic interests must be given more weight.]{.underline} Over
the past decade, Russia has easily maintained its position as the
world's second-largest weapons supplier, comprising 22% of global sales
from 2013-17. Chinese arms exports increased by nearly 40% from 2013-17
compared with the previous four years, the largest increase for any
large exporter country except Israel, according to the Stockholm
International Peace Research Institute. [Neither Russia nor China has
qualms about selling weapons to even brazen human-rights violators. In
fact they often provide the technologies authoritarian governments use
to surveil and repress their citizens. And they are especially eager to
peel off countries the U.S. has declined to arm. Russia sells aircraft,
submarines, antiaircraft systems and missiles. China has made strides in
advanced missile systems as well as unmanned aerial vehicles. The sale
of these sophisticated weapons poses a direct threat to U.S. security
interests. It also creates challenges around
interoperability.]{.underline} [Technologies developed by the Russians
and Chinese]{.underline}---such as advanced radars, sonars, sensors and
communications platforms---[cannot integrate effectively with U.S.
technologies.]{.underline} [The more a country purchases from Russia or
China, the less able it is to purchase from the U.S. in the
future]{.underline}, pushing a country further out of America's security
orbit. [The lack of interoperability would also present major obstacles
if the U.S. needed to fight a war alongside an ally whose advanced
military equipment had been sourced from Russia or China. Countries cut
off by the U.S. will still be able to purchase advanced
systems]{.underline}. Worse, [they will be able to do so without
depending on the U.S. for maintenance, ammunition or spare parts. This
eliminates a key lever for U.S. influence in the event that human-rights
abuses occur, for instance.]{.underline} Take Turkey. In 2016 and 2017
it had been attempting to purchase helicopters and other technology from
U.S. manufacturers, but was turned down due to concerns around
deteriorating governance. Then in late 2017 it acquired a sophisticated
missile-defense system from Russia for \$2.5 billion, an unprecedented
move for a member of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization. Vietnam's
relations with the U.S. have been pleasantly thawing, partly because of
a common concern around China's aggressiveness in the Indo-Pacific
region. The U.S. lifted its arms embargo on Vietnam in 2016, but
residual concerns about human rights have largely limited sales to
sonars and radars. In addition the U.S. has not provided meaningful
military assistance to Vietnam to help offset costs. As a result,
Vietnam continues to purchase much of its military equipment from
Russia, which often subsidizes the transactions. Or consider Thailand,
traditionally one of America's closest security partners in Asia. A 2014
coup caused concern about the country's trajectory and led the U.S. to
limit some weapons sales. China took immediate advantage, signing a deal
to sell over \$1 billion of submarines to the Thai navy. In late 2017
Bangkok announced plans to establish a joint naval center with Beijing
to service those submarines, as well as a joint arms factory to produce
and maintain other military equipment. There are more examples around
the world. [As the U.S. moves into a phase of more intense competition
with Russia and especially China, its approach to arms transfers must
change. If not, its global security partnerships will be steadily eroded
by more assertive and less scrupulous rivals.]{.underline}

### 2NC -- Generic

**US heg high now -- any study that says otherwise only focuses on
quantitative studies, rather than qualitative ones**

**Hasan 16** (Hawre Hasan, MA in International Studies at the University
of Sheffield in the UK. He is currently lecturer at University of
Sulaimani, Department of Politics. 12-1-2016, \"Is the United States
Still a Global Hegemonic Power?,\" No Publication,
https://www.academia.edu/30336999/Is_the_United_States_Still_a_Global_Hegemonic_Power)

[The US is Still a Global Hegemonic Power]{.underline} As seen from the
above framework, [the declining literature of US hegemony was unable to
offer a complete picture of the US power]{.underline}. Such a
comprehensive picture partly mentioned from the above assessment against
the two theories, and partly will be discussed in this section.
Therefore, the above assessment against the two should be regarded as an
integral part of this section. As mentioned from perspectives of
opponents of the two, [the US is still a hegemonic power.]{.underline}
[Strange by looking at the structural power reached the similar
conclusion. Strange]{.underline} (1989, p.165) [divides power into
relational power and structural power; but she concentrates only on
structural power]{.underline}. For Strange (1987), Structural power is
the ability to choose and to shape the structures of the global
political economy within which other states, their political
institutions, their economic enterprises, and (not least) their
professional people have to operate (p.565). As Guzzini (1993) notes,
[Strange theorised the structural power against the literature of the US
hegemonic decline, and she argues that the declining thesis is chosen on
purpose.]{.underline} [To avoid such a mistake, Strange]{.underline}
(1987, cited in Paterson, 1996, p. 96) [looks at structural power to
analyse the US hegemony,]{.underline} and [therefore]{.underline} she
argues that the [US hegemony not only remains but also
enhanced.]{.underline} Strange believes that [structural power consists
of four sectors, and in each sector the US structural power is still
great. The first component of structural power is security that lies in
the power of those actors providing or denying the security for
others.]{.underline} Strange believes that (1987) the [US power in this
structure in comparison with other states is overwhelming.]{.underline}
For [the US dominates the only capability of intercontinental missiles
with nuclear warheads]{.underline} ―[that are any sort of a match for
the corresponding force controlled from Moscow]{.underline}‖. This
structure is more evidenced, in the context that [US NATO allies are
very weak in nuclear weapons, they rely on US protection, and their
dependence on the latter is increased because of their weakness to the
Soviet Union and its Warsaw allies in conventional weapons.]{.underline}
Moreover, Gill (1990) believes that [measuring the military power of the
United States simply in relation to US forces overlooks the military
expenditures of the US allies that supplement US security
position.]{.underline} [The second structure]{.underline} according to
Strange (1987), [is a production structure, the power in this structure
stems from who decide what should be produced for whom, on what
terms.]{.underline} Strange (2001) argues that [those concluded that the
American economy is in decline, they looked at the share of industrial
manufactured products and the share of U.S. exports of manufactures to
world markets. These measurements, however]{.underline}, by her account
is confusing because they [are territorially based, and therefore they
are inappropriate.]{.underline} Consequently, Strange (1987) believes
that [we have to instead regard, the proportion of total world
production of goods and services produced: a) in the United States, and
b) by enterprises ultimately headquartered in the United States and
responsible to the government Washington]{.underline} (p. 566-568).
Strange shows many indicators supporting the dominance of the US in the
production structure; [the top six companies producing computers are
still American, ―as are twelve of the top twenty‖. Among them, they
produce 62.3 percent of total world production]{.underline} and have
over 50 percent of world turnover. Moreover, IBM alone takes over the
market by 35.6 percent of world revenue in 1983. In telecommunications,
AT&T and ITT are the leading two corporations in sales terms; the U.S.
share of high technology products is actually larger. Similarly,
American service industries will hold their share-50 per cent or more-of
the whole world market, In the oil business, among ten major oil
companies, seven of them are still American. Strange believes that
taking any list of the top 100, 500, or 1,000 companies producing for
the world market demonstrates that the decision-making power over the
world\'s production structure still lies, not in Europe or Japan, but in
the US. Strange argues that the reason why [the US controls the
production structure is that the US provides the large market for
manufactured commodities, and therefore the US laws and policies apply
to those firms that exploited such a marketplace. The third structure is
finance structure]{.underline}, according to Strange (1998, p.90), [the
finance structure lies in the ability to enjoy the purchasing power and
thus control markets for production, and also the capability to direct
or misdirect money in which ―credit is denominated]{.underline}‖.
Strange argues that [the finance structure is controlled by the US, for
it has the capability to control the provision and the availability of
credit that denominated in dollars, and therefore to use a great
influence for good or ill over the provision of the credit in the global
monetary system]{.underline}. The US power is clearer, when one looks at
the ratio of gold and foreign exchange rates hold by US government
relative to Japan and Germany, and also the US government is the only
government to print dollars that are accepted and saleable around all
over the world. Strange believes [that the US has two prominent weapons
in the finance structure that makes the latter more powerful than
others. It could make advances in dollars to meet an emergency; and it
could twist the arms of the largest and most influential banks in the
system to follow its example with renewed medium-term
credit]{.underline} (p. 90). [The fourth structure is
knowledge]{.underline}, Strange (1995, p.65-66) argues that [there is no
doubt that the knowledge structure is dominated by American universities
and American professional associations.]{.underline} By her account,
there are many indications demonstrate such a truth including; the
number of overseas students that enroll in American colleges and
universities in comparison with those that enroll in European and
Japanese universities demonstrate the American dominance of global
market in higher education, and the influence of US laws on patents and
property rights in medicine and pharmaceutical research all over the
world shows a structural influence that directly affects ―the life
chances -?good or bad- of millions of people‖. After all, it can be said
that, [Strange with other opponents of HST and MWST roughly showed a
real picture of the US hegemony. For they rely on both quantitative
accounts and qualitative accounts to assess the US hegemony, they did
not look at one or two types of power, but rather they looked at
different dimensions of the US power. Consequently, **they could
demonstrate that the US is still a global hegemonic
power.**]{.underline} The article dealt with the US hegemonic power in
accordance with HST MWST and Structural Power theory. The former two
mainly concentrated on the US economic power to show the US hegemonic
decline, to document such a decline both schools took some quantitative
accounts of the US economic power. However, [both HST and MWST were
unable to offer a comprehensive picture of the US hegemony, for both
approaches mainly depended only on two types of power, even they could
not report the US decline based on the two types of power, they ignored
the qualitative data to assess US hegemonic power, and therefore they
could not explain the fact that why the US still gets outcomes more than
others in the system.]{.underline} However, [adherents of structural
power by looking at different sources of power, taking both quantitative
and qualitative accounts, they offered a comprehensive picture of the US
hegemony. This picture really shows that the US is still a global
hegemonic power.]{.underline}

### 2NC -- Not Declining

**Declinist theory is wrong -- US hegemony is high now**

**Hunt 17** (Edward Hunt, PhD in American Studies from the College of
William & Mary., 3-13-2017, \"The American Empire Isn't in Decline,\" No
Publication,
https://www.jacobinmag.com/2017/03/obama-trump-mattis-united-states-empire)

Still, there are some reasons to think otherwise. [As former US diplomat
R. Nicholas Burns recently
[observed](http://www.armed-services.senate.gov/hearings/16-07-07-north-atlantic-treaty_organization-russia-and-european-security),
the United States maintains "alliances in Europe and Asia, and the
Russians and Chinese do not." In addition, the American military has
begun to [wipe out](https://lobelog.com/the-new-exterminatory-warfare/)
ISIS, killing more than [sixty
thousand](http://www.military.com/daily-news/2017/02/14/specops-commander-60000-isis-fighters-killed-by-us-troops.html)
fighters over the past two and a half years.]{.underline} So do a
resurgent Russia, an ascendant China, and the emergence of the Islamic
State suggest that US power is ebbing, or are these challenges
exaggerated? What do US officials really think about these matters? [If
we take stock of their public statements as a whole, the foreign policy
establishment certainly appears concerned about the latest challenges to
US empire,]{.underline} especially the uncertainty that Trump's election
has introduced. [But they also remain quite confident in their power to
shape the world and steer the United States into a new age of global
hegemony.]{.underline} The World's Superpower Over the past few years,
[a number of high-level officials have expressed great confidence in the
durability of US hegemony.]{.underline} [Not only have **they insisted
that the declinist thesis is wrong**, but they have argued that **the
United States will remain the world's dominant power** well into the
future.]{.underline} In May 2016, two former high-level officials [laid
out](https://www.foreign.senate.gov/hearings/examining-americas-role-in-the-world-051216)
the more confident view for the Senate Committee on Foreign Relations.
[In a statement to the panel, former Secretary of State James Baker said
that the United States would continue to lead the international system.
Certainly, "much of the rest of the world]{.underline} --- countries
like China, Brazil and India --- [are catching up with us," Baker
conceded. "Still, we should remain the world's preeminent leader for the
foreseeable future."]{.underline} Former National Security Advisor
Thomas Donilon agreed. **[As long as the United States takes the proper
precautions,]{.underline}** he said, [**it "will continue to be the
world's leading and most powerful nation** **for a long time to
come."**]{.underline} [Donilon]{.underline} also [rejected the declinist
thesis, calling it a "myth" that should not be taken seriously: "The
idea that America is in decline does not stand up to a rigorous analysis
of our national balance sheet of strategic assets and liabilities,"
Donilon asserted. "The truth is that no nation can match our
comprehensive set of enduring strengths."]{.underline} Other Obama
administration officials offered similar views. Last October, for
example, Secretary of State [John Kerry noted that the United States
maintains tremendous economic advantages. "We're the richest country on
the face of the planet," Kerry
[said](https://2009-2017.state.gov/secretary/remarks/2016/10/263891.htm).]{.underline}
In fact, [the Obama administration made great strides in expanding US
economic power across the globe.]{.underline} President Obama, who
[acknowledged](https://obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/the-press-office/2016/11/20/press-conference-president-obama-lima-peru)
during his final months in office that [he]{.underline} had "made it a
priority to open up new markets overseas," [boasted that his
administration had "increased US exports to the world by more than 40
percent --- to record levels."]{.underline} At the same time,
[administration officials also pointed to their other great advantage in
world affairs: American military power.]{.underline} As Secretary of
Defense Ashton Carter
[noted](http://archive.defense.gov/Transcripts/Transcript.aspx?TranscriptID=5610)
in April 2015, "it will take decades --- and let me repeat that: decades
--- for anyone to build the kind of military capability the United
States possesses today." Obama expressed similar sentiments during his
farewell tour. [The United States possesses "the greatest military in
the history of the world," Obama
[declared](https://obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/the-press-office/2017/01/04/remarks-president-armed-forces-full-honor-review-farewell-ceremony)]{.underline}.
"Make no mistake," he continued, "even with the challenges of recent
years --- and there have been challenges --- our allies and adversaries
alike understand America's military remains, by far, the most capable
fighting force on the face of the Earth." In short, [contrary to those
who warn of waning US hegemony, high-ranking officials insist that the
United States remains the most powerful country in the world. "We are,
without a doubt, the world's superpower," CIA Director John Brennan
[said](https://csis-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/s3fs-public/160914_Brennan_Keynote.pdf)

[During the past two centuries, the United States has enjoyed a largely
unchallenged]{.underline} geopolitical, economic, and social [influence
in Latin America.]{.underline} [However, in an increasingly multipolar
world, Russia and China]{.underline}---and Iran to a lesser
extent---[have emerged to fill the vacuum left by diminished U.S.
engagement]{.underline} in the region. Each with different interests,
[these three foreign actors exploit a growing, widespread
disillusionment towards the United States.]{.underline} This regional
disillusionment coupled with endemic corruption, violence, and erosion
of the rule of law marks the conditions under which the extra-regional
actors are engaging Latin America. **[All three actors]{.underline}**
have made significant gains---and suffered important setbacks---as they
**[move aggressively to position themselves as alternatives to
traditional U.S. hegemony in Latin America.]{.underline}** **[Their
success has not been total, nor has it gone completely
unchallenged.]{.underline}** However[, their efforts are a new
constant]{.underline} in the Western Hemisphere, [as the United States
increasingly pursues an agenda that is sharply divorced from the
once-shared interests of the]{.underline} majority of the
[region]{.underline}'s governments. Russian President Vladimir [Putin
has made no effort to hide his desire to reestablish his country as a
viable power player and competitor]{.underline} [to U.S. influence in
the region]{.underline}. Viewed through the lens of the Gerasimov
Doctrine, this engagement is both rational from the Russian perspective
and dangerous to the United States. So far, Russia has primarily focused
its outreach efforts on allies in the Bolivarian Alliance, led by
Venezuela and including Cuba, Nicaragua, Bolivia, El Salvador, and
Suriname, all of whom share a strong anti-U.S. ideology with each
possessing deeply criminalized governments.1 Often operating as a sort
of "parasite state," the public outreach of the Putin regime in Latin
America is designed to maximize impact at low cost. To date, [this
approach consists largely of weapons sales and donations, high level
state-to-state visits, military and police training]{.underline} in
areas of U.S. specialization such as counternarcotics, [and financial
assistance]{.underline} in avoiding the U.S.-based banking system.
Within international forums, Russia has used its seat on the UN Security
Council to protect Venezuela and Nicaragua from international sanctions,
and has aggressively moved to open up financial operations---including
banks and a crypto currency---to help its allies blunt the impact of
U.S. and EU sanctions. [The Russian presence,]{.underline} increasingly
accompanied by Russian organized crime groups operating under the
protection of the Russian state, [is viewed by most U.S. stakeholders as
presenting the biggest strategic challenge of the three countries
discussed.]{.underline} In comparison to Russia, [China is primarily an
economic competitor, actively seeking to expand its areas of influence
globally]{.underline}. [China]{.underline}'s outreach has been much
broader across Latin America where it [has sought to build long-term
economic relationships with any willing partner]{.underline} in the
region. China's growing regional presence is focusing on trade and on
increasing diplomatic ties at the expense of the Republic of China
(Taiwan), while presenting itself as a global superpower capable of
providing military training, business opportunities and unconditional
foreign assistance in a more reliable, long-term way than the United
States. Rather than wooing only the Bolivarian bloc and ideological
allies, China engages across the region, recently convincing Panama and
the Dominican Republic, key U.S. allies, and El Salvador to drop their
diplomatic recognition of Taiwan. In exchange, both received large
amounts of aid and promises of investment from the People's Republic of
China (PRC). Of the three external actors, [Iran's revolutionary
government has the smallest footprint]{.underline} in Latin America of
the three countries [and the most opaque agenda.]{.underline} Unlike
Russia and China, [Iran]{.underline} offers neither economic nor
military support, but instead [focuses on a narrower set of state and
non-state actors through limited political outreach]{.underline} and
illicit activities meant to further Iran's national interest and nuclear
program. That influence diminished with the death of former Venezuelan
president Hugo Chávez and the end of the presidency of Mahmoud
Ahmadinejad in Iran, but may increase again contingent upon current
developments.

**[AT: China]{.underline}**

**China will not overtake US hegemony now**

**Segal 18** (Adam Segal, assistant professor of political science at
Tufts University and associate at the Belfer Center for Science and
International Affairs at Harvard\'s Kennedy School of Government.,
9-21-2018, \"Stop Obsessing About China,\" Foreign Affairs,
https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/china/2018-09-21/stop-obsessing-about-china)

The United States is a deeply polarized nation, yet one view
increasingly spans the partisan divide: the country is at imminent risk
of being overtaken by China. [Unless Washington does much more to
counter the rise of its biggest rival, many argue, it may soon lose its
status as the world's leading power.]{.underline} According to this
[emerging
consensus](https://www.wsj.com/articles/left-and-right-agree-get-tough-on-china-1515458432),
decades of U.S. investment and diplomatic concessions have helped create
a geopolitical monster. China now boasts the world's largest economy and
military, and it is using its growing might to set its own rules in East
Asia, hollow out the U.S. economy, and undermine democracy around the
globe. In response, many Democrats and Republicans agree, the United
States must ramp up its military presence in Asia, slap
[tariffs](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/08/opinion/trump-tariffs-economics.html)
on hundreds of billions of dollars of Chinese goods, and challenge
China's influence worldwide. [But this emerging consensus is
wrong]{.underline} and the policy response misguided. [**China is not
about to overtake the United States** economically or militarily---quite
to the contrary. By the most important measures of national wealth and
power, **China is struggling to keep up** and will probably fall further
behind in the coming decades. **The United States is and will remain the
world's sole superpower** for the foreseeable future, **provided that it
avoids overextending itself abroad** or underinvesting at home. The
greatest risk for U.S. strategy]{.underline}, accordingly,
[lies]{.underline} not in doing too little [but in overreacting to fears
of Chinese ascent and American decline.]{.underline} Instead of hyping
China's rise and gearing up for a new Cold War, Washington should take
more modest steps to reinforce the existing balance of power in East
Asia and reinvigorate the U.S. economy. To keep the peace, U.S. leaders
should seek to engage rather than alienate Beijing, safe in the
knowledge that long-term geopolitical trends will favor the United
States.

### 2NC -- Arms Sales

#### International actors perceive US arms transfer policy through the lens of political leverage -- decreasing it would signal retreat.

Keep China Down, Russia Out, and Friendly States In A smart [arms
transfer policy would strangle both Russia,]{.underline} the number two
exporter, [and China, which]{.underline} is trying to take its place.
[Russia]{.underline} in particular [needs arms exports to fund its
aggressive but underfunded military modernization plans]{.underline}
(not to mention hard currency for its weak economy). It is in America's
interests to choke off as large a percentage of the Russian export
market as possible in favor of the products of more closely aligned
countries. In terms of both American influence and curbing
proliferation, it is better for countries like Malaysia and Indonesia to
buy German or South Korean submarines than Russian. This will have the
added benefit of diminishing the quality and, eventually, raising the
price of the products Russia will export to states, such as Syria, that
cannot buy arms from anywhere else. In the spirit of bolstering
potential partners and limiting the reach of Russian weapons, the United
States can directly compete against Russia in one important market.
India accounts for a stunning 39 percent of Russia's recent arms exports
(SIPRI). Indian orders might be big enough to provide some meaningful
economic benefits to the United States, but more importantly, U.S. sales
would cut into Russia's market share. Tying India and the United States
closer, even if it means allowing most production, jobs, and even some
technology transfer to go abroad, should be a central goal of U.S. arms
transfer policy. Lockheed Martin's offer to transfer the F-16 production
line to India appears a step in this direction. America should accept
that Saudi Arabia is going to buy a lot of U.S. weapons, but avoid
coddling the Kingdom. [Saudi Arabia (and its Gulf State allies) will
remain an important customer largely because **the country is desperate
to keep the United States involved in the region**]{.underline}. The
Saudi military is almost entirely American equipped and trained and most
of its military capability requires continued American support to
function for more than a couple of days. [A few additional jobs may
result from selling more arms to the Kingdom, but this may **not justify
giving up the leverage over Saudi and its allies' policies towards
Yemen, Syria, and Qatar that do not necessarily advance American
interests.**]{.underline} The United States should encourage, but steer,
Europe. [Since the Cold War **the United States has used its economic
and political clout to systematically inhibit an independent European
defense production capability.**]{.underline} This has certainly
increased U.S. market share, but continued efforts come at the expense
of more important political goals. It would be much easier to ask NATO
allies to spend 2 percent of their GDP on defense if more of this money
would go into indigenous industries. The United States should recognize
that European global competitiveness in the arms trade can serve
American interests (and perhaps provide competition for its own
sheltered defense industry). [This will relieve pressure on Europe to
export to countries embargoed by the United States, which undermines the
influence of U.S. arms transfer policy]{.underline}. When the United
States placed real restrictions on arms transfers to Egypt's al-Sisi
regime, other states quickly attempted to fill this gap. As one French
policymaker cynically noted, "Obama was the \[French fighter jet\]
Rafale's best salesperson." Overall, from 2012-2015 the export
agreements of major European sellers to Egypt have gone up
forty-seven-fold over the previous four-year period. [That said, Europe
has by and large cooperated with successful arms embargoes against
Russia and China]{.underline} (although Europe does sell nearly \$400
million of dual use equipment to China each year). Maintaining and even
tightening these key sanctions must be the highest priority of any
defense cooperation policy with Europe. **[More broadly, fixation on
"buying American" misses tremendous opportunities for leading
coordinated action with like-minded states in Europe and
elsewhere.]{.underline}** This is feasible given that [the United
States, NATO members, South Korea, Israel, and a few other allies
account for a whopping 62 percent of total global arms
exports]{.underline} (SIPRI). To this end, the United States should
liberalize its own market. Much as when "foreign" automotive firms build
their cars in the United States, acquiring products from abroad may
create more jobs than selling weapons internationally. The U.S. Air
Force's current \$16 billion fighter-trainer contract has been largely
narrowed down to three candidates with foreign connections: a Lockheed
Martin-Korea Aerospace Industries version of Korea's T-50; a new design
from a Boeing-Saab team; and an entirely foreign offering from Leonardo.
Winning such a contract will give one of three like-minded states (South
Korea, Sweden, or Italy, respectively) a boost in other international
competitions against less scrupulous dealers. And the United States can
still shape these exports for its political interests, such as when it
recently vetoed the T-50's export to Uzbekistan. America is Like No
Other Arms Exporter and Should Act Like It [The United States --- by
dint of its huge military budget, massive defense R&D, and long
dominance of the global arms market --- can use arms transfers in ways
beyond the dreams of its competitors]{.underline}. Indeed, many
competitors recognize this, albeit grudgingly. [I have interviewed
officials in multiple countries]{.underline} (both clients and
competitors of the United States) **[claiming they will defer to U.S.
wishes on arms exports if they trust it is done for political rather
than economic reasons.]{.underline}** Many of [America's closest
allies]{.underline}, who are also arms export competitors, **[look to
the United States for leadership on controversial
importers]{.underline}** such as Saudi Arabia. And, the Trump
administration should be given due credit for exercising discretion,
given, for instance, its recent unilateral embargo on arms transfer to
South Sudan. In fact, one administration official stated flatly that
sales "will not come at the expense of human rights." In no small part,
**[U.S. domination of the global arms trade is based on the world's
belief that the United States uses its clout to advance its political
ends]{.underline}**, not economic gain. Destroying this reputation will
do little to bring jobs to the United States, while doing much to damage
American influence abroad.

**[Few tools have been used in pursuit of]{.underline}** so many
**[foreign policy objectives as arms sales]{.underline}**. **[The United
States has sold weapons to]{.underline}** its NATO allies to ensure
their ability to defend Western Europe; to friendly governments around
the world facing insurgencies and organized crime; to allies in the
Pacific (buffering them against China's rising military power); and to
both **[Israel]{.underline}** and many of its Arab neighbors in efforts
**[to maintain]{.underline}** regional **[stability and influence over
Middle Eastern affairs]{.underline}**. **[The United States has used
arms sales]{.underline}**, as well as the threat of denying arms, in
efforts **[to influence]{.underline}** human rights
**[policies]{.underline}**, to **[help end conflicts]{.underline}**, to
**[gain access to military bases]{.underline}**, **[and]{.underline}**
to **[encourage fair elections]{.underline}**. Since 9/11, the new
central focus of U.S. weapons sales has been to bolster the global war
on terror.36 Despite their many uses, arms sales impact foreign affairs
through two basic mechanisms. The first involves using arms sales to
shift the balance of power and capabilities between the recipient and
its neighbors, thereby helping allies win wars or deter adversaries,
promote local and regional stability, or buttress friendly governments
against insurgencies and other internal challenges.37 During the Cold
War, American arms sales became part of a broader strategy to deter the
Soviet Union from invading Western Europe. In the wake of the 9/11
attacks, the United States sold weapons to Afghanistan and Iraq to
bolster their ability to defeat the Taliban, al Qaeda, and the Islamic
State. By selling advanced weaponry to Taiwan, Japan, South Korea, and
Australia, the United States hoped to balance rising Chinese power and
promote regional stability. Although the specific objectives differ, at
root the causal mechanism is the same: using arms sales to shift the
balance of power in a direction more favorable to American interests.38
The second mechanism involves using arms sales to generate leverage over
the conduct of other nations. As the producer of the world's most
advanced and sought-after weaponry, the United States can dictate, at
least to some degree, the conditions under which it will agree to sell
certain weapons.39 As Andrew Shapiro puts it, "When a country acquires
an advanced U.S. defense system, they are not simply buying a product to
enhance their security, they are also seeking a relationship with the
United States... . This engagement helps build bilateral ties and
creates strong incentives for recipient countries to maintain good
relations with the United States."40 **[American influence is thought to
be most potent in cases where the United States provides a nation with a
large share of]{.underline}** its **[military
capabilities]{.underline}**. **[In the wake of U.S. pressure to halt
Israeli defense exports to China]{.underline}**, for example, **[an
Israeli official acknowledged]{.underline}**, "**[If the United
States]{.underline}**, **[which provides Israel with \$2 billion in
annual military aid]{.underline}**, **[demands that we will not
sell]{.underline}** anything **[to China]{.underline}** --- **[then we
won't.]{.underline}** If the Americans decide we should not be selling
arms to other countries as well --- **[Israel will have no choice but to
comply]{.underline}**."41 The **[United States has used arms
sales]{.underline} to** try to **[encourage states to vote with the
United States at the UN]{.underline}**, to **[support or
adopt]{.underline}** pro-Western and **[pro-U.S. foreign
policies]{.underline}**, to **[convince]{.underline}** Egypt and
**[Israel to accept peace accords]{.underline}**, **[and to gain access
to military bases]{.underline}** in places such as Greece, Turkey,
Kenya, Somalia, Oman, and the Philippines. After the Cold War, the
United States also sought to tie arms transfers to human rights and
democratization efforts in client states.42 .

#### The Us-Israel alliance is the lynchpin of American primacy in the Middle East -- deters Russian interference

At a time of redefinition for the international order, [Israel and the
United States share a wide range of mutual interests where the Middle
East is concerned.]{.underline} This commonality is one aspect of the
international order that is not in flux. [While acknowledging limits to
its military commitments in the region, the United States seeks to
retain its position as the dominant security actor in the Middle
East.]{.underline} Among other goals, Washington aims to secure order
and stability in Syria, which at a minimum means avoiding great power
conflict and the deepening of state failure, but could also entail
achieving a political settlement to the Syrian civil war[. The United
States views Israel's security as a top priority, as well as a core part
of a regionwide counterterrorism strategy]{.underline}. Meanwhile, in
Syria, [Israel has as its paramount goal pushing back Iran's military
entrenchment and ideally the full-scale withdrawal of Iranian military
assets from Syria. Israel is willing to work with regional actors that
will contribute to this outcome. Israel also sees the continuity of
American military dominance in the region as crucial to its security and
to regional order.]{.underline} Israel and the United States enjoy a
unique relationship, which rests on a commonality of strategic interests
and on shared values. **[Israel is the United States' vital ally in the
Middle East.]{.underline}** The two countries conduct intelligence
cooperation of the most important and most sensitive nature. [The
U.S.-Israel alliance is a key pillar of Israeli security, and the United
States also benefits from this close cooperation.]{.underline} The two
countries share an understanding that Israel must have freedom of action
to exercise its legitimate right of self-defense in a region where its
national interests and its most basic national security are constantly
challenged from multiple directions. [Russia]{.underline}, which is
reasserting its historic role as a global power in Europe, the Middle
East, and beyond, [poses challenges for the United States and
Israel.]{.underline} It is an actor capable of frustrating both
Washington's and Jerusalem's foreign policy and national security goals,
or of doing even worse damage. [Relations between the United States and
Russia are at their lowest ebb in decades]{.underline}. [Inflection
points]{.underline} in this downward trend [include]{.underline}
Russia's military incursions into Georgia and Ukraine, interference in
U.S. and other democracies' politics and elections, the return to great
power competition, and [a reassertion of Russian influence in the Middle
East. Russian intervention in the Middle East has focused on Syria, but
Russia's efforts to increase its footprint are wider, encompassing the
entire region.]{.underline} These efforts notwithstanding, Russia has
failed to extend its writ substantially beyond the Syrian arena and is
no match for the dominant U.S. presence in the region. [Russia's
practice of negotiating the divides between rival actors from the
position of a power broker is a challenge]{.underline} and an
opportunity. Clearly, Russian assertiveness in Syria and its cooperation
with Iran could increase following the U.S. decision to withdraw some of
its forces from Syria. Under these circumstances, Israel faces a
strategic challenge in Syria. This is because Iran appears determined to
establish a second missile and terror front in the country, while
Russia's military presence constrains Israel\'s freedom of action to
combat Iran and its proxies. Although Russian policy adversely affects
both Washington and Jerusalem, the two allied democracies do not
necessarily see Russian intentions and interests through the same lens.
Washington does not generally prioritize the threat that Russia's
involvement in Syria poses to Israel and can be skeptical about
Israeli-Russian high-level engagement, despite the Israeli view that
such engagement is crucial for securing and maintaining its ability to
operate in Syria. American policymakers are concerned about what could
be a tightening relationship between Jerusalem and Moscow, which might
enable Russia to project power in the Middle East more broadly and
possibly to the detriment of U.S. interests. Yet [the U.S.-Israel
alliance and the stabilizing effect of the U.S. presence in the region
contribute greatly to Israel\'s national security, and these are
sacrosanct interests for Israel.]{.underline} Moreover, [Israel
is]{.underline} in fact [sympathetic to Washington's concerns about
Russian global malign activity and restricts]{.underline} the scope of
its security contacts with [Russia accordingly]{.underline}. Going
forward, [Jerusalem will need to]{.underline} balance management of the
Russian factor in Syria with its long-term interests in
[support]{.underline}ing and preserving [a favorable U.S. position in
the region.]{.underline}

Max Ajl, a PhD candidate in development sociology at Cornell University,
[writes](http://inthesetimes.com/article/19479/the-israeli-aid-package-10-more-years-of-the-special-relationship):
"[U.S. 'military assistance,']{.underline} more accurately understood as
a circular flow through which U.S. weapons firms profit off the
colonization of Palestinian land and Israeli destabilization of the
surrounding states, [is a long-term structuring element of the
U.S.-Israel 'special relationship.'"]{.underline} U.S. military
[loans](https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/history-and-overview-of-u-s-foreign-aid-to-israel)
started arriving in Israel in November 1971, when the Nixon
administration signed a Memorandum of Understanding with Israel to build
up its domestic industrial-arms sector through technical and
manufacturing assistance. Grants started to replace loans in 1974. [The
U.S. government]{.underline} shortly afterwards [started to permit
Israel to spend 26% of the annual military grant on purchases in
Israel]{.underline} -- a unique arrangement, since by U.S. law recipient
countries must spend all of their foreign military financing in the U.S.
According to Ajl, "[the Israeli military industry often relies on U.S.
technological inputs, and the U.S. forbids Israel from manufacturing
crucial heavy weaponry, such as fighter jets, in order to maintain
control over Israel."]{.underline} U.S. military grants to Israel were
often quid pro quo, as Israel increasingly took on the work for which
the U.S. could not publicly take responsibility, given popular unease in
the States over aid to fascist dictatorships. As the International
Jewish Anti-Zionist Network noted in their
[report](http://www.ebony.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/israels-worldwide-role-in-repression-footnotes-finalized.pdf),
Israel's Worldwide Role in Repression, in the 1970s, Israel armed the
brutal military regime of the Argentinian junta that imposed seven years
of state terrorism on the population. Israel also provided most of the
arms that Nicaraguan dictator Anastasio "Tachito" Somoza used in the
last year of his dictatorship to oppose the revolution, a conflict that
killed tens of thousands of Nicaraguans in the 1970s. By the 2000s, [the
Israeli military-industrial complex had produced an industry capable of
competing in small-arms and high-end security technology on a worldwide
scale. Israel started to export arms]{.underline} that have been refined
through high-technology colonial policing of the Palestinian population,
especially in the Gaza Strip and the West Bank. In recent years, Israel
has risen to one of the [top 10 arms
exporters](https://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-5174345,00.html)
in the world. Last May Haaretz
[reported](https://www.haaretz.com/israel-news/israel-s-defense-export-sales-exceed-record-9-billion-1.6052046),
"Israel's defense-related exports in 2017 totalled \$9.2 billion, an
all-time record and whooping 40% increase over 2016 -- when
defense-related transactions totaled \$6.5 billion." The Obama
administration adjustments to [Israel's military aid
package](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-israel-statement/u-s-israel-sign-38-billion-military-aid-package-idUSKCN11K2CI)
came amidst a shifting geopolitical environment, both within the U.S.
and Israel. There was a shift in original MOU that would slowly phase
out the provisions through which Israel could spend up to 26% of its
funding package within Israel, to Israel spending more of this funding
on the advanced military capabilities that only the United States can
provide -- as much as \$1.2 billion per year, according to Ajl. In
addition, this MOU locked in \$500 million annually for missile
defense.**[The MOU mandates Israel update its fighter aircraft fleet,
which is a direct
[investment](https://www.wsj.com/articles/lockheed-martin-lands-23-billion-pentagon-contract-1542237634)
into the U.S. military-industrial complex]{.underline}**, given that
fighter-jet factories are exclusively based in the United States. Not
only does U.S. foreign policy and Israeli-settler colonialism shape what
happens across historic Palestine, it also shapes what happens across
the Middle East region. [The firm establishment of Israel's military
defense industry]{.underline} also [provides an excuse to sell
ever-more-sophisticated weapons to other regional U.S.
allies]{.underline}, especially Saudi Arabia. As long as [Israel has the
latest U.S.
technology](https://thedefensepost.com/2019/03/04/us-eucom-deploys-thaad-israel/),
other countries can buy older models, again to the great profit of the
U.S. defense industry. [Israel thus is the spark plug for an entire
region-wide weapons bazaar]{.underline}, while also providing such
countries the means to destroy and dismantle even poorer countries like
Yemen. [**This keeps the** entire **region**]{.underline} aflame,
oppressed and desperate, and thus [**unlikely to upset hierarchical**
regional and international **social structures**]{.underline}. Ajl
suggests that one of reasons the United States pushed through this MOU
before Obama left office is the rising discontent within the U.S.
population over ongoing support for Israeli colonization of historic
Palestine and the surrounding region. Frida Berrigan, author of Made in
the U.S.A.: American Military Aid to Israel,
[writes](http://www.defense-aerospace.com/article-view/feature/71588/focus%3A-u.s.-aid,-companies-fuel-israeli-military.html)
that a major barrier to any shift in American policy towards
Palestine-Israel is "financial pressures from a U.S military industrial
complex accustomed to billions of dollars in sales to Israel and other
Middle Eastern nations locked in a seemingly perpetual arms race with
each other by all buying American and using Foreign Military Financing
(FMF) to pay the bills." The United States is the primary source of
Israel's far superior arsenal. [Israel's
[dependence](https://www.aljazeera.com/indepth/interactive/2018/03/understanding-military-aid-israel-180305092533077.html)
on the U.S. for aid and arms means that the Israeli military relies on
spare parts and technical assistance from the U.S. to maintain optimum
performance in battle.]{.underline}

U.S. Air Force Chief of Staff Gen. David Goldfein, returning from a trip
to Colombia, said over the weekend that the [Trump]{.underline}
administration [is making a push to strengthen alliances across Latin
America as part of an effort to counter rising Chinese and Russian
influence]{.underline} in the United States' backyard. In an interview
with Foreign Policy, Goldfein said Colombia and other **[Latin American
countries risked being locked out of U.S. and allied operations if they
stopped buying military hardware from the United States]{.underline}**
and turned to other markets instead. "While there may be other cheap
hardware out there that might be available on the market, at some point
it becomes really hard to make it connect and share within the system,"
[Goldfein]{.underline} said by phone Saturday while flying home from
Colombia. His trip [was part of a broader administration effort to
reinforce alliances across Latin America as the region grapples with a
range of security threats]{.underline}, from narcotrafficking and
terrorism to Venezuela's economic collapse and ensuing refugee crisis.
During the two-day visit, which followed U.S. Defense Secretary James
Mattis's own South America tour in August, Goldfein met with Colombia's
minister of defense, commander general, and air force chief, and he
spoke with students at the Colombian war college. "[When it comes to
China and Russia, we are looking at cooperation where we can and pushing
back aggressively where we must]{.underline}," Goldfein said. "We keep a
close eye on their activities globally, but certainly we keep an eye on
their activities \[in Latin America\]." Underlying the outreach effort,
experts say, is U.S. recognition that [China and Russia are quietly
exerting economic and military influence in Latin America.]{.underline}
China is a master at leveraging trade and direct economic investment for
geopolitical gains, they say. [Driven by a desire to tap into Latin
America's vast oil reserves, as well as to bolster anti-American
sentiment, China has invested large sums of money in the
region.]{.underline} It has surpassed the United States as the main
destination for exports in seven countries in the region. In five of
those countries---Brazil, Chile, Cuba, Peru, and Uruguay---China is now
the largest export market. It has also been working with Argentina on a
space station in Patagonia. "The [Colombians are concerned that the U.S.
has been leaving the region behind]{.underline}, [and it has created a
void, this vacuum to fill,]{.underline}" said Moises Rendon, an analyst
with the Center for Strategic and International Studies. He noted
Colombia's dilemma: It "can't say no to China, because they are
providing opportunities and investment, \[while\] the U.S. is not
providing the same types of opportunities." Russia, meanwhile, is seen
as less of a power player in the region but has sold billions of dollars
of weapons to countries across Latin America. Unlike China, which wants
to use Latin America's natural resources for its own economic growth,
Russia's interest in the region is primarily strategic, Rendon said.
Both nations are using these commercial ties to support Latin American
regimes that violate human rights and are antagonistic to the United
States, particularly Venezuela, Nicaragua, and Bolivia, with the end
goal of undermining America's influence in the region, analysts said.
"One very important concern for the U.S. government is that [the Chinese
are propping up \[Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro's\] regime and
other nondemocratic leaders like Nicaragua \[and\]
Bolivia]{.underline}," Rendon said. The escalation of Chinese influence
in Latin America is reflected in the number of nations that have swapped
recognition from Taiwan to China, according to Ana Quintana, an analyst
with the Heritage Foundation. This group now includes El Salvador, Costa
Rica, Panama, and the Dominican Republic. READ MORE U.S. National

Washington must help Bogotá shoulder the burden of refugees. The goal is
not just "sticking it to the Americans," but also "amplifying their

Both China and Russia "want to be in a position to be a power broker in
Latin America." The U.S. administration's approach to countering Chinese
and Russian influence]{.underline}** in Latin America **[is rooted in
building new alliances and strengthening the ones that already exist.
Maintaining strong military-to-military ties is key,]{.underline}**
Goldfein said. "There are times when our [diplomatic relationships may
change based on the political environment, but we are able to maintain a
military-to-military relationship and dialogue,]{.underline}" Goldfein
said. He stressed his close friendship with Colombia's Air Force chief,
Gen. Carlos Eduardo Bueno, and lauded the country for leading the region
in promoting democracy. "Colombia is really the gold standard for how
you take the resources of the country and, through strong leadership and
perseverance, you turn a country around and get it on a path toward
democracy," Goldfein said.

In the global competition between world powers, the battle in Latin
America exemplifies how power is shifting toward Asia. [China has been
steadily strengthening political and economic ties with Latin
America]{.underline}, while [the United States has missed numerous
opportunities to strengthen ties with its southern
neighbors]{.underline}. From President Barack Obama's pivot to Asia, to
President Donald Trump's "America First" stance and hard-edge approach
to immigration, many in [an increasingly confident and economically
attractive Latin America believe the United States has taken them for
granted]{.underline}. By contrast, [Chinese companies have invested over
\$100 billion in Latin America in a wide range of
industries]{.underline}, from oil and metals extraction to information
technology, electricity, and infrastructure. And they have set a goal
for investment capital to reach \$250 billion by 2025. Moreover, China
is now the number one or number two trading partner of Brazil,
Argentina, Chile, Mexico, and Peru. [China's foreign
minister,]{.underline} Wang Yi, [also recently invited Latin America to
join China's Belt and Road Initiative]{.underline}, with promises of
large loans to cover major infrastructure projects. Increasingly, [Latin
America countries are aligning themselves rhetorically with
China]{.underline}. [Chilean Foreign Minister]{.underline} Heraldo
[Munoz]{.underline} recently [praised China for its "constructive
role"]{.underline} in the region, [and for rejecting
protectionism]{.underline}. [This was a veiled reference to Trump's
"America First"]{.underline} policy. [In reality, China remains more
protectionist than the United States]{.underline}, although you wouldn't
know it from listening to each country's leaders. While President Xi
Jinping of China hails free trade, the country practices
neomercantilism, a trade strategy based on import substitution and
industrial exports, exemplified by its Made in China 2025 policy, which
aims to dominate high tech industries and significantly increase

[U.S. officials are]{.underline} now [speaking their minds about China's
growing economic links with Latin America.]{.underline} U.S. Secretary
of State Rex Tillerson noted in his speech at the University of Texas on
February 1, "China... offers the appearance of an attractive path to
development... but, this often involves trading short-term gains for
long-term dependency." This is not always true, but has been the case
for certain countries. For example, Ecuador currently must ship more
than 90 percent of its oil to Asia, as it owes more than 500 million
barrels of crude oil to China, depriving the country of an important
source of revenue. Another U.S. official, Treasury Under Secretary for
International Affairs David Malpass, also partially blamed China for
Venezuela's woes. "Most of the blame for Venezuela's economic collapse
and humanitarian disaster falls squarely on Venezuela's rulers, but
China has been by far Venezuela's largest lender, supporting poor
governance," Malpass said. "The result will raise the ultimate cost to
the international community once Venezuela returns to democracy and
economic reforms." China was a steadfast lender to Venezuela in deals
that have topped \$60 billion, giving a lifeline to a sinking ship.
Malpass also sent a letter to the president of the Inter-America
Development Bank (IDB), calling out the IDB for having its annual
meeting in Beijing next year rather than in Latin America. The United
States is the biggest shareholder at the IDB and China's stake is less
than 0.01 percent. This shift in rhetoric from the current U.S.
administration is rooted in an insecurity that the United States may
have opened a door that it will now be unable to close. Trump's more
aggressive policies on immigration and his upsetting of the U.S.
rapprochement with Cuba have set the United States back in the region. A
recent Gallup poll shows approval of the U.S. president in Latin America
has fallen to just 16 percent. But those that blame only Trump fail to
see that shifts in global power are longer term structural trends that
are larger than any one U.S. president. China's economic power has been
increasing for decades, and its military has been growing steadily since
the 1990s. Conversely, the United States has seen relatively low
economic growth since the global financial crisis and has cut defense
budgets. **[The United States should focus more attention]{.underline}
[on]{.underline}** the **[battles for soft power and influence around
the globe]{.underline}**. **[In Latin America, the United States should
start by focusing on strengthening relations with its direct southern
neighbor]{.underline}**. The **[Mexico]{.underline}** of today **[is a
dynamic hub of innovation and economic diversity that is taking on
difficult reform issues]{.underline}**. And [recent conflict in the
U.S.-Mexico relationship]{.underline}, [like threatening to build a
wall]{.underline} along their shared border or pulling the United States
out of the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), [have pushed
Mexico to cozy up with China]{.underline}. Mexico has recently seen a
rash of investment from China, from e-commerce to auto manufacturing,
and Mexico has openly spoken about increasing trade with China.
Similarly, the United States must focus on strengthening relations with
its allies Brazil and Argentina. China has recently surpassed the United
States as Brazil's largest trading partner, and now Brazil is the
largest Latin American supplier of oil and soybeans to China. Rather
than focusing on trade in commodities, U.S. imports from Brazil focus

exclude from his speech declarations that the Monroe Doctrine, a
document that painted Latin America as a U.S. sphere of influence not to
be touched by outside powers, is "as relevant today as it was the day it

[The political crisis in Venezuela has pitted the U.S. against a
dictator who refuses to leave office]{.underline}. But [the
crisis]{.underline} has a broader significance: It [shows that Latin
America has]{.underline} again [become an arena in which rival great
powers struggle for influence and advantage.]{.underline} As [the U.S.
faces surging geopolitical rivalry]{.underline} around the world, its
position is also coming under pressure in its own backyard. The region
has been the focus of global competition before, of course, from the
Spanish-Portuguese rivalry of the 15th and 16th centuries to the Cold
War between Washington and Moscow. But after the fall of the Soviet
Union, Latin America seemed --- for a time, at least --- to have become
a geopolitics-free zone. [The retreat and disintegration of the Soviet
Union left the U.S. with no challenger for predominant regional
influence]{.underline}. Castro's Cuba turned inward, consumed by a
profound economic crisis. As countries democratized and embraced free
markets, [the region became essentially unipolar in an ideological
sense]{.underline}, as well. By the early 2000s, however, the climate
was shifting. First came [a new generation of leaders]{.underline} who
viewed neoliberal economics as the source of the region's persistent
poverty and inequality. Governments led by the likes of Chávez in
Venezuela, Evo Morales in Bolivia and Rafael Correa in Ecuador coupled
populist political appeals and economic programs with a penchant for
illiberalism and, in some cases, outright authoritarianism. They
[challenged the U.S. diplomatically and rhetorically]{.underline}, while
establishing close ties with Cuba. [This created a bloc of regional
actors that opposed American power]{.underline} --- just as outside
actors were beginning to assert, or reassert, their own influence in the
region. As **[China's]{.underline}** economy has boomed over the last
two decades, its **[presence in Latin America has grown as
well]{.underline}**. [Chinese trade and investment has surged nearly
everywhere]{.underline}, not just countries run by radical populists.
Chinese commerce and loans have provided a lifeline to illiberal rulers
such as Chávez and now Maduro by reducing their vulnerability to U.S.
and Western pressure. [Chinese military engagement
followed]{.underline}, creating fears that Beijing may be trying to
establish a strategic foothold in the Western Hemisphere. Although
aspects of China's relationship with Latin American countries remain
controversial --- some Chinese infrastructure projects have been
criticized because they often employ Chinese rather than Latin American
workers, for instance --- **[Beijing has undoubtedly become a player in
the Western Hemisphere]{.underline}**. [Russia has provided economic and
diplomatic support to Chavez, Maduro and other autocratic
rulers]{.underline} such as Nicaragua's Daniel Ortega. [It has sold
jets, tanks and other weapons to populist governments, and resumed
providing military technology]{.underline} and oil to Cuba. Much to the
concern of the U.S. government, the Kremlin has also been working to
establish a significant intelligence presence in Nicaragua. As the
Carnegie Endowment for International Peace observes, "Moscow's approach
to Latin America today echoes Soviet outreach in the 1960s through
1980s." Russian and Chinese relations with Latin American countries are
often described as simply transactional, and it is true that both Moscow
and Beijing can drive hard bargains for their support. One price of
Russia's continued backing of the Maduro regime has been a significant
ownership stake in the Venezuelan oil industry. China, too, has seen
Venezuela as an energy source, and its economic growth would have driven
enhanced involvement in Latin America even in the absence of any
geopolitical design. But [for both countries, that involvement also has
a deeply competitive logic**. Reaching into Latin America is a way of
keeping the U.S. off-balance by exerting influence in Washington's "near
abroad."**]{.underline} **[It helps augment Beijing's and Moscow's
global influence and stature at a time of intensifying rivalry with
Washington]{.underline}**. Finally, **[supporting autocratic
regimes]{.underline}** such as those in Caracas and Managua --- whether
quietly, as in China's case, or more vocally, as in Russia's --- **[is a
way of making sure that the world remains ideologically safe for
authoritarianism in Beijing and Moscow, as well.]{.underline}** All this
constitutes the backdrop to the Venezuelan crisis. The growth of Russian
and Chinese influence in Latin America broadly, and Venezuela
specifically, is a key reason the Trump administration has so
uncharacteristically taken up the banner of human rights and democracy.
By imposing harsh economic sanctions, calling for the military to desert
Maduro, and backing the political opposition led by the Juan Guiadó, the
Trump administration is seeking to deprive Moscow, Beijing and Havana of
a critical partner in Latin America. And while Russia and China have
responded very differently to this crisis, both are working, in their
own ways, to protect that partner. The Chinese government has registered
its opposition to the international campaign against Maduro's
government; it has continued to recognize his embattled government even
as dozens of democratic countries have thrown their support behind
Guiadó. Russia has been far more assertive, denouncing Washington for
trying to "engineer a coup d'etat," in the words of its United Nations
representative. It has warned against American military intervention,
and symbolically dispatched two nuclear-capable strategic bombers to
Venezuela. More concretely, Moscow has reportedly dispatched 400
mercenaries to reinforce Maduro's praetorian guard and pledged
additional economic support. **[There is thus a certain Cold War feel to
the current crisis, with the U.S. and its rivals lining up on opposite
sides of a conflict over who should rule]{.underline}** a key **[Latin
America]{.underline}**n country.

**[As]{.underline}** still **[the world's sole
superpower]{.underline}**, **[the United States possesses]{.underline}**
an unequaled array of **[instruments to support]{.underline}** its
**[foreign]{.underline}** and defense **[strategies]{.underline}**.
**[With]{.underline}** so much attention being focused on the conflicts
in the Middle East, **[Russian aggression in Eastern Europe and Chinese
efforts to assert]{.underline}** its **[hegemony in the Western
Pacific]{.underline}**, the fact that **[the United States
employs]{.underline}** a wide range of non-military, or at least
**[non-kinetic tools]{.underline}** in pursuing its national interests
is lost. Most recently, for example, the United States and China agreed
on the imposition of new trade sanctions on North Korea in response to
that country's test of a long-range ballistic missile. **[One of the
most important]{.underline}** of these **[tools is foreign military
sales (FMS)]{.underline}**. The complex role of **[FMS is
reflected]{.underline}**, in part, in the fact that the program is run
by the Department of State and not the Department of Defense. One reason
for this unusual management approach is that the FMS program involves
sales by the U.S. government of U.S. arms, defense equipment, defense
services, and military training to foreign governments. As a result,
such sales **[reflect the views of the U.S. government with respect to
the recipient country]{.underline}**, its relationships with others in
the region **[and]{.underline}** the overall approach **[this country
takes to mitigating the threat of regional or global
conflict.]{.underline}** The FMS program serves many other purposes. The
sales of U.S. arms and related items to foreign countries helps reduce
the cost of those systems to our own military. **[FMS sales help to
ensure the ability of U.S. allies to defend themselves and
support]{.underline}** the maintenance of stable **[regional military
balances]{.underline}**. Equally important, **[FMS sales over time
establish enduring relationships between foreign governments
and]{.underline}** their **[militaries and the U.S.]{.underline}** When
the U.S. military trains alongside those of allies equipped with the
same hardware, it helps to cement the bonds between our countries.
Moreover, **[it improves communications]{.underline}** and understanding
among these militaries, often **[helping to inculcate U.S.
values]{.underline}** related to the use of military force. **[Foreign
militaries dependent on access to U.S. hardware, spare parts, software
upgrades and training are more likely to listen to this
country]{.underline}** when there is a dispute regarding regional
politics or defense issues. **[FMS has been particularly important as an
instrument for influencing foreign governments and shaping regional
balances of power in the Middle East.]{.underline}** Following the 1973
Arab-Israeli War, **[the United States completely reequipped the
Egyptian military]{.underline}**. The Egyptian-Israeli border has been
remarkably stable ever since. **[Sales of military aircraft, missile

### 2NC -- Saudi Arabia

#### Arms sales to Saudi Arabia is an important political tool to maintain hegemony 

**Selman 18** (YUSUF SELMAN, 10-28-2018, \"Arms sales to Saudi Arabia
more than money, rather a sign of political might,\"
https://www.dailysabah.com/mideast/2018/10/29/arms-sales-to-saudi-arabia-more-than-money-rather-a-sign-of-political-might)

[Saudi Arabia\'s economy is largely dependent on imports as the
country\'s production is at very low rates.]{.underline} The only good
that keeps Saudi Arabia\'s economy high is oil. Experts call this a
rent-seeking economy where the economy depends on the production of a
high-valued material. [Saudi Arabia imports many essential materials
from abroad]{.underline}, including food, electronic devices and, [most
importantly, arms.]{.underline} Considering that the country has been
engaged in an endless war in Yemen, halting arms sales would be a way of
sanctioning the death of journalist Jamal Khashoggi in the Saudi
Consulate in Istanbul. It has been proven that the journalist was
murdered inside the consulate. The journalist went missing at the
beginning of this month. Saudi Arabia followed a policy of denying the
allegations, but in the end the Riyadh administration admitted that its
officials were responsible for murdering the journalist. International
outrage has been increasing as several European countries have decided
to revise their relations with Saudi Arabia. [Several Western countries,
including]{.underline} [the U.S]{.underline}., [Canada, Germany, France,
the U.K. and Spain]{.underline}, [sell arms to the kingdom]{.underline},
which has been one of the world\'s largest arms importers. Since the war
broke out in Yemen in 2015, procurement increased sharply, showing that
[the country has become heavily dependent on arms imports]{.underline}
since then. Germany was the first country to declare that it would halt
arms sales and called on others to make a similar decision. However,
neither the U.S. nor France have responded positively to this call. For
instance, French President Emmanuel Macron dismissed this call as
\"demagoguery.\" \"What\'s the link between arms sales and Mr.
Khashoggi\'s murder? I understand the connection with what\'s happening
in Yemen, but there is no link with Mr. Khashoggi,\" he said on Friday.
Yet, any decision as such taken by France would be a blow to Saudi
Arabia\'s ambitions in the region, particularly in Yemen, because France
is its second-biggest arms exporter at \$13.8 billion. Similarly,
[Spain\'s socialist government defended the arms sales, stating that it
was in the country\'s \"interests\" to keep selling arms.]{.underline}
\"If you ask me where I stand today, it is in the defense of the
interests of Spain, of jobs in strategic sectors in areas badly affected
by the drama that is unemployment,\" Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez told
parliament. In July, Spain signed a deal worth \$2 billion to supply
navy ships. Moreover, the Spanish government last month decided to sell
400 laser-guided bombs as well. Apparently, there are two countries in
the EU that defend the halting of arms sales. Besides Germany, Austria
also called to stop the arms sales, underlining that it would help end
\"the terrible war in Yemen.\" [One main concern in the West about
halting arms sales is the fact that Russia and China are ready to sell
weapons without commenting on any action targeting human
rights]{.underline}. The U.S. is concerned that [Russia\'s arms delivery
to any country accounts for more than half of Saudi Arabia\'s arms
imports]{.underline}, according to research group IHS Markit. The same
group has documented that arms sales by the U.S. amounted to \$7.3
billion last year, while it was less than \$2 billion a decade ago.
Therefore, [the U.S. believes the sale of arms is an important factor in
keeping Riyadh on its side.]{.underline} Similar to this concern,
regarding Russia and China, [Saudi Arabia cannot be lost by the West as
Riyadh explicitly opposes Iran and its actions in the Middle East. Both
the U.S. and its main ally in the region, Israel, consider Iran as a
threat; thus, Saudi Arabia is essential for the struggle against
Tehran.]{.underline} In conclusion, it is clear that the amount gained
from **[arms sales to Saudi Arabia]{.underline}** may not be crucial for
Western economies, but [**plays a political role,** especially in
preventing Russia and China from taking the lead in the arms sales
sector, which could easily be used as a political factor.]{.underline}

#### Ending arms sales to Saudi Arabia would hurt US manufacturers -- hurts heg

**Crooks 18** (Ed Crooks, 10-22-2018, \"Five charts that explain Saudi
Arabia's importance to the global arms trade,\" Financial Times,
https://www.ft.com/content/dd836c34-d60b-11e8-a854-33d6f82e62f8)

[Germany's decision to halt arms sales to Saudi Arabia]{.underline}
following the death of journalist Jamal Khashoggi [has underscored the
way that the kingdom's military spending has become increasingly
important to governments and businesses]{.underline} in North America
and Europe. [Saudi Arabia has for years been one of the world's largest
arms importers.]{.underline} In the past decade, its purchases have
risen sharply, as the country's leadership has pursued an assertive
regional security policy, including its military intervention in Yemen
since 2015. Mr Khashoggi disappeared earlier this month after entering
the Saudi consulate in Istanbul, where Turkish officials said he was
killed by Saudi operatives. Saudi officials said on Friday that Mr
Khashoggi had died in a fist-fight. On Monday, [Germany announced that
it would cut off weapons sales to Saudi Arabia as a result of the
circumstances surrounding Mr Khashoggi's death. It urged other countries
to follow its lead and argued that a ban would be more effective if more
countries took part]{.underline}, though President Donald [Trump has
repeatedly indicated that he is reluctant to take action to block sales
by US companies. Arms exports]{.underline} to Saudi Arabia are not
particularly significant to the German or US economies, but for specific
factories, they [can be critical.]{.underline} Mr [Trump]{.underline}
appears to have inflated his estimate for the number of jobs that could
be supported by arms deals with Saudi Arabia, but he [is right to
suggest that cutting off sales would have consequences for]{.underline}
some [manufacturers.]{.underline} However, the dependence goes both
ways. The need to have weapons systems that work together means that it
would not be easy for Saudi Arabia to switch to buying most of its arms
from Russia or China. The following five charts help explain Saudi
Arabia's importance to the global arms trade and the issues that the US
and other countries will have to consider as they decide whether to
follow Germany's lead. Saudi Arabia was by some distance the world's
largest importer of defence equipment and services last year by value,
according to IHS Markit, the research group. Different sources with
different methodologies come up with somewhat different conclusions. The
Stockholm International Peace Research Institute (Sipri), using a
narrower definition that focuses on large weapons systems and calculates
in volume rather than value terms, puts India as the largest importer in
recent years. But no matter how it is calculated, it is clear that Saudi
Arabia is one of the world's largest arms buyers. Deliveries of defence
equipment and services to Saudi Arabia have risen sharply, from \$1.9bn
in 2008 to a peak of \$8.3bn in 2016 and on course for an estimated
\$7.3bn in 2018, again according to IHS Markit. The US share of those
imports has increased, from 31 per cent in 2008 to an estimated 53 per
cent this year. The other leading suppliers last year were the UK and
Canada, followed by Germany and France. For the US economy as a whole,
arms sales to Saudi Arabia are insignificant. Military equipment made up
18 per cent of US exports to Saudi Arabia last year, but just 0.13 per
cent of total worldwide exports, according to official data. The two
countries announced last year that the kingdom would buy \$110bn of US
arms in the coming years, and Mr Trump has suggested that these exports
would support up to 500,000 jobs, but he has not given any source for
that estimate, which has been greeted sceptically by analysts. Most of
the workforce in the US defence industry of roughly 1m is producing
equipment for the federal government, which had a military procurement
budget of \$134bn in the past fiscal year alone, more than 40 times the
value of exports to Saudi Arabia that year. That said[, for individual
companies, arms sales to Saudi Arabia can be important sources of
revenue. Saudi imports of some specific products, such as bombs and
missiles, have increased dramatically, making them an important customer
for manufacturers of those weapons.]{.underline} Of the US agreement to
sell \$110bn in arms to the kingdom, only \$14.5bn has so far resulted
in firm contracts. But [Lockheed Martin, the US defence and aerospace
group, has said its share of the plan could be worth \$28bn in sales. As
of June, the company had an order backlog of \$105bn, so adding those
Saudi sales could make a material difference.]{.underline}

#### Arms sales to Saudi Arabia are key to us hegemony

08-28-2012, \"Soft Power through Hard Power Weapon Sales,\" Atlantic
Council,
https://www.atlanticcouncil.org/blogs/new-atlanticist/soft-power-through-hard-power-weapon-sales)

In a Congressionally-mandated report, Richard F. Grimmett and Paul K.
Kerr recently detailed global arms transfer agreements in 2011 of \$85.3
billion, which is greater than the economic activity of 119 countries
and tops the defense budget of every single country in the world save
the United States and China. [The United States accounts for \$66.3
billion of the arms agreements]{.underline}, while Russia ranked a
distant second with \$4.8 billion. [Grimmett and Kerr note **the number
of sales is historically high "due primarily to the unusually large
agreements value of the US contracts with Saudi
Arabia**]{.underline}\--the international arms market is not likely
growing overall..." They add, "Concerns over their domestic budget
problems have led many purchasing nations to defer or limit the purchase
of new major weapons systems." [Ground forces tend to benefit most from
new deliveries of tanks, artillery, armored vehicles, and missile
systems.]{.underline} However, several countries committed to purchasing
high-cost aircraft, which helps explain why weapons sales are so high.
From 2008-11, the United States accounted for 56 percent of arms
agreements, overshadowing European countries (16 percent), Russia (13
percent), and China (3 percent). While China is a major manufacturing
power, it still lacks a competitive weapons industry and cannot compete
globally on major weapon systems. In fact, China still relies on Russia
to supply aircraft engines. With steady economic growth from the energy
sector coupled with heightened concerns over Iran's nuclear weapons
program, it is none too surprising that [Middle Eastern countries
purchase the most weapons. Likewise, without an indigenous weapons
industry]{.underline} like Brazil, [countries like Saudi Arabia, UAE,
and Iraq are reliant on arms imports.]{.underline} [Thus, Saudi Arabia
will significantly upgrade its F-15 fleet; UAE will field new missile
defense systems, and Iraq and Oman will purchase F-16s. These purchases
indicate not only real concern about Middle East stability but are also
a good indication that these governments want long-term partnerships
with the United States.]{.underline} With weapon sales come training,
maintenance plans, and integration into US-led exercises. [Outside of
direct economic benefits of arms sales**, the United States gains
partners for global military operations.**]{.underline} Without aircraft
like the F-16 and Mirage-2000, UAE could not have participated in Libyan
air operations. With its new C-17 cargo aircraft, India will be able to
better deploy and sustain its 10,000 UN peacekeepers around the world.
New Persian Gulf missile defense radars enhance United States efforts to
limit Iran's military options to strike with ballistic missiles. And for
every F-35 Japan buys, the United States can field one fewer in
Northeast Asia. As the 2012 US defense guidance noted, "Building
partnership capacity elsewhere in the world also remains important for
sharing the costs and responsibilities of global leadership. Across the
globe we will seek to be the security partner of choice." [Weapons sales
also illustrate a commitment by the United States to improve partners'
efforts to strengthen their own defenses. Since the early 2000s, the
list of security partners has grown considerably and only a dozen
countries in the world are excluded from US security cooperation
relationships.]{.underline} However, the non-exclusive list of partners
is not without costs. Some partners over-interpret agreements believing
they are in alliance with the United States, while military
relationships at any cost can undermine broader strategic goals.

#### Arms sales to Taiwan are key to US Indo-pacific strategy, economy, defense, and deterrence

South China Morning Post,
https://www.scmp.com/comment/opinion/article/3018242/us-arms-sales-shows-taiwans-security-non-tradeable-us-and-key-its)

[The Trump administration has notified]{.underline} the United States
[Congress of its intent to sell 108 M1A2T Abrams tanks and Stinger
missiles worth US\$2.2 billion to Taiwan]{.underline}. While China has
predictably reacted with outrage, [this latest arms sale reflects
rational calculations by Taipei and Washington, which concluded that
this sale is firmly in their respective interests.]{.underline}
Importantly[, the notification makes clear that Taiwan's security is not
trade-bait in a grand bargain between Washington and Beijing, but a
notable indicator that the Trump administration is faithfully
implementing its Indo-Pacific strategy.]{.underline} Taiwan's rationale
to acquire new tanks and the air defences to protect them is clear.
China's military has modernised and expanded rapidly and President Xi
Jinping has openly declared that the use of force to reunify Taiwan with
the mainland remains a policy option. Investments by the People's
Liberation Army (PLA) in amphibious vessels, heavy lift aircraft, attack
helicopters, as well as long-range strike capabilities, make the
invasion of Taiwan an increasingly realistic threat. [To counter the PLA
threat, it is necessary for Taiwan to modernise its legacy force and
develop new asymmetric capabilities.]{.underline} How China's military
upgrade, trade war are challenging US in Indo-Pacific. M1 Abrams tanks
and Stingers, an improvement over the existing M60 Patton tanks bought
in 1991, are intelligent military choices and an integral component of
Taiwan's "Overall Defence Concept". The vision, by Taiwan's Chief of the
General Staff Admiral Lee Hsi-ming, emphasises asymmetric and innovative
capabilities, mobility and survivability, and maximising Taiwan's
defensive advantages by improving its littoral fighting capabilities.
[Taiwan's success at turning it into a full-fledged military strategy
and doctrine will be critical to its ability to deter Beijing. The US
calculus is more complex but equally grounded in national
interests.]{.underline} There are [some]{.underline} who [tout **the
sale's economic benefits to US workers and the defence
industry**]{.underline}. Others note that the [weapons offered are
short-range and defensive, consistent with obligations under the Taiwan
Relations Act. These items will not upset the cross-strait military
balance, nor change the US-China political dynamic.]{.underline} [Most
importantly, **the weapons sale to Taiwan is an important aspect of a
political deterrence strategy.** The sale is a signal to Beijing of US
commitment to Taiwan and to a peaceful resolution of cross-strait
differences]{.underline} --- this is perhaps the arms sale's most
valuable attribute. Could high-level defence talks between US, Taiwan be
new normal? [The sale is also a substantial indication to allies and
partners in the region about US commitment, dependability and
willingness to stand up to China on behalf of valued
partners]{.underline}. [**It underpins the US Indo-Pacific strategy**,
which emphasises deepening relationships and improving the military
capabilities of partners and allies.]{.underline} Beijing undoubtedly
sees this and the US Indo-Pacific strategy in a different light, but
that perspective misses the essence of the calculus. [The Trump
administration's decision to sell tanks to Taiwan while negotiating the
US trade relationship with China reflects confidence, and a relentless
focus on US interests.]{.underline} It should also debunk theories that
the US is using Taiwan to contain or impair China. President Donald
Trump made concessions to President Xi at the G20 summit in Osaka,
Japan, to relieve US pressure on Huawei, purportedly to build trust and
support the US bargaining position in bilateral trade negotiations. This
makes sense. Trading Taiwan's security for economic concessions does
not. Taiwan's security, deterring China's use of force, and the peaceful
resolution of the cross-strait conflict are key American interests that
cannot and should not be traded for soybeans or market access. Taiwan
arms sales have always been a factor in the US-China relationship, and
will continue to be central because until China renounces the use of
force and exclusively pursues peaceful means for reconciliation, [it
remains squarely in the US national interest to ensure that Taiwan can
defend itself and manage cross-strait relations from a position of
relative security.]{.underline} Three loud and clear messages from
Taiwan's military exercise. This concept of supporting choices that
promote long-term peace and prosperity is at the core of the
Indo-Pacific strategy. The US Defence Department's report on the
Indo-Pacific strategy, released to coincide with the Shangri-La Dialogue
in Singapore in early June, stated it succinctly: ["The United States
has a vital interest in upholding the rules-based international order",
which "includes a strong, prosperous and democratic
Taiwan".]{.underline} The US will undoubtedly have more opportunities to
demonstrate its commitment to Taiwan's security and the defence of
allies and partners. Taiwan has requested new F-16V fighter aircraft to
replace its ageing F-5 fighters, and that decision is reportedly
pending. The Taiwan factor in the US-China relationship will continue to
be manageable so long as the Trump administration focuses on its
interests and continues to recognise that [Taiwan's security
is]{.underline} not a tradeable commodity, but [an integral aspect
of]{.underline} its [Indo-Pacific strategy]{.underline}.

#### Arms sales to Taiwan maintains stability in the region

**Ching 7/9** (Nike Ching, State Department Correspondent of Voice of
America News Center, 7-9-2019, \"US: Taiwan Arms Sale to Promote Peace,
No Change on \'One China\' Policy,\" Voice of America,
https://www.voanews.com/usa/us-taiwan-arms-sale-promote-peace-no-change-one-china-policy)

[The United States said Tuesday that its arms sale to Taiwan is aimed at
promoting "peace and stability" in the Asia Pacific region]{.underline}
and Washington is not changing its \"One China\" policy. China has
demanded the U.S. to cancel the sale after the State Department approved
a request by Taiwan to purchase an estimated \$2.2 billion worth of
military equipment. [The deal]{.underline}, announced Monday by the
Defense Department\'s Defense Security Cooperation Agency, includes 108
M1A2T Abrams tanks, 250 Stinger shoulder-fired anti-aircraft missiles
and over 1,500 anti-tank missiles. The agency said the package [would
not alter the basic military balance in the region.]{.underline} "[Our
interest in Taiwan, especially as it relates to these military sales, is
to promote peace and stability across the \[Taiwan\] Strait, across the
region,\" said State Department spokeswoman Morgan Ortagus during a
briefing.]{.underline} Ortagus added, \"There is no change, of course,
in our long-standing One China policy," which is based on three
U.S.-China Joint Communiques and the Taiwan Relations Act. A State
Department official told VOA the approved sale is consistent with U.S.
law and policy. [\"This proposed sale serves U.S. national, economic,
and security interests by supporting the recipient\'s continuing efforts
to modernize its armed forces and to maintain a credible defensive
capability,\" the official said.]{.underline} In Taipei, Taiwan
President Tsai Ing-wen expressed appreciation for the deal, saying the
defensive weapons provided by the U.S. will boost Taiwan\'s self-defense
capabilities and deter potential military threats. In a tweet on
Tuesday, Tsai said [Taiwan will continue to invest in national defense,
defend democracy while promoting regional peace and
stability.]{.underline} The potential deal has angered China, Taiwan\'s
bitter cross-Strait rival. Foreign Ministry spokesman Geng Shuang called
on the U.S. Tuesday to \"immediately cancel\" the deal, saying it
\"seriously violates the one-China principle \...grossly interferes in
China\'s internal affairs and undermines China\'s sovereignty and
security interests.\" Geng also said China has already filed formal
complaints with the U.S. through diplomatic channels. The two sides
split after the 1949 civil war when Chaing Kai-shek\'s Nationalist
forces were driven off the mainland by Mao Zedong\'s Communists and
sought refuge on Taiwan. But Beijing considers the self-ruled island

#### US arms sales in Ukraine is key to combating Russian hegemony

[The global balance of power is in transition.]{.underline} A global
order that was established after World War II and the collapse of Soviet
Union is now evolving and often dysfunctional. We are witnessing the
expansion of a multipolar world, and the risk of conflict is
intensifying due to an increase in the number of influential players
around the world. [Ukraine is at the epicenter of these changes and the
interests of many of the world's major powers. **It is the key to
balancing Russia's global ambitions**.]{.underline} [Since its military
aggression in Ukraine in 2014, and even earlier, starting with its war
with Georgia, Russia has continuously tried to destabilize and diminish
the global-security system. This was done with only one aim: for Russia
to reassert itself under a new post--Soviet sphere of influence with new
borders, both physical and psychological.]{.underline} President
Vladimir [Putin]{.underline} made this clear in 2007 during his speech
at the Munich Security Conference, where he [complained that "the United
States has overstepped its national borders, and in every area." Of the
tools Russia uses to gain geopolitical influence, the most crucial is
the "diffusion of tactics." These tactics involve various methods of
influence, ranging from military conflicts to the manipulation of
national political and economic systems through disinformation and
proxies, as well as cyber warfare.]{.underline} Faced with such threats,
[Western political and security systems are vulnerable]{.underline}.
Democracy requires public trust and a bureaucratic consensus to survive.
Putin knows this, which is why he has sought to undermine these pillars
of democratic stability. Similarly, [the United States and its allies
should respond to the Kremlin's challenges by attacking Russia where it
is most vulnerable: its exports of fossil fuels and exports of
weapons.]{.underline} In the oil and gas sector, [the West has been
assertive in countering Russian aggression by sanctioning Russia's
energy industry and exporting shale oil and gas from the United States.
But in the defense industry and defense trade, on the other hand, there
has not been the same level of action by the West. This is where Ukraine
has a critical role to play.]{.underline} There are just a few countries
in the world that have full cycles of defense production. Only the
United States, France, Russia, China, and Ukraine cover virtually all
technological capabilities in the defense space. [Russia's arms trade
poses threats to global security. The Kremlin uses defense technical
cooperation as a means to achieve its geopolitical goals.]{.underline}
Moscow pursued this policy during the Cold War by dividing the world
into sectors of strategic influence. Back then, the United States was
the counterweight to this destructive Soviet strategy, and it must once
again assume this role. [In this context, Ukraine can play a key
function in aiding the United States. Ukraine is a country of leading
defense capabilities. Its national infrastructure was built on and
centered around defense.]{.underline} For over twenty years, [the United
States and the West have lacked a strategy to effectively leverage
Ukraine's defense capacity by integrating it into NATO. These
capabilities could clearly create additional value for
NATO.]{.underline} Russia is keenly aware of this. As result, [the
Kremlin has had as one of its principal goals the subjugation of Ukraine
in order to prevent the West from being able to utilize its
potential]{.underline}. Moscow possessed plans to seize eastern Ukraine
long before its invasion in 2014. [Russia had targeted this region of
Ukraine because it hosts critical elements of the Soviet defense and
space industries, and the technologies that are produced there are
difficult to replicate. Russia could not allow these assets to continue
to exist in an independent and Western-oriented Ukraine.]{.underline}
Recent history demonstrates how important Russia views its former
Ukrainian defense base. On December 2, 2013, a high-level Russian
delegation chaired by Vice-Prime Minister Dmitriy Rogozin visited
defense factories in the eastern Ukrainian cities of Dnipro, Zaporizhia
and Mykolayiv. Not coincidentally, the following day, then president of
Ukraine Viktor Yanukovich refused to a sign the Ukraine-EU Association
Agreement, which is a political and trade framework that would have
brought Kyiv even closer to the West and moved it further away from the
influence of Russia. [In essence, the Ukrainian defense industry is
Russia's natural competitor. And with Western support, it could
seriously diminish Russian influence around the world.]{.underline} The
West, and the United States in particular, must take advantage of
Ukraine's inherent potential. [By working with Ukraine more closely, the
West will be able to contain Russia's geopolitical
influence.]{.underline} To do this, however, Ukraine must also make
itself more attractive as a partner, especially by pursuing critical
political and military reforms. Ukraine's legislative framework for
defense reform was developed out of necessity following the 2014 Maidan
Revolution and Russia's annexation of Crimea and invasion of eastern
Ukraine. And with presidential and parliamentary elections taking place
in Ukraine next year, now is the time to follow through on this
framework. The Ukrainian defense industry should be refocused to meet
NATO standards and requirements, taking aim at replacing Russian and
Soviet weapons that are used by current NATO member-states. NATO members
like the Czech Republic, Hungary, Bulgaria, Italy and France should not
be collaborating with the Russian defense sector. The Ukrainian defense
industry and its products represents a viable alternative for these
countries. In addition, NATO countries should begin cooperating with
Ukraine's defense industry by creating joint products that could replace
existing Russian exports to third markets such as India, the Middle
East, and Latin America. Such substitution is critically important, not
only because arms exports are an essential source of income for the
Russian defense industry, but also because Russia traditionally exploits
defense technical cooperation to gain political and strategic influence
in countries around the world. [Such expanded cooperation between
Ukraine, NATO and the West would be mutually beneficial. The integration
of the Ukrainian defense and aerospace industry into Western defense and
security structures, as well as the country's eventual accession to
NATO, would contribute substantially to both regional and global
stability.]{.underline}

[There are two conventional ways of understanding America's global
role]{.underline}. [According to one]{.underline} theory, the bipolar
world of the Cold War has given way to a unipolar world in which [the
United States is the undisputed hegemon.]{.underline} Some observers see
this as a good thing and champion American empire, while others see it
as a bad thing and seek to resist American empire, but both sides agree
that American empire is the defining feature of our era. [A second
theory]{.underline}, only different from the first by degrees, [asserts
that the post-Cold War world is multipolar]{.underline}, with the United
States as the clear dominant power among many potential rivals,
including countries such as China that might conceivably surpass the
United States down the line. But what if **[neither theory is
correct]{.underline}**? [The near-universal understanding of
the]{.underline} [U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates [as a
powerful, unified global actor is flawed]{.underline} and in need of
revision. [The United States is]{.underline} less a great power exerting
its will and [more an open-air market for global
corruption]{.underline}, in which [outside powers can purchase
influence, shape political outcomes, and play factions against each
other]{.underline} in the service of their own competing agendas. That's
a familiar historical story. Although Foundation drew its direct
inspiration from Edward Gibbon's The Decline and Fall of the Roman
Empire, [history is replete with examples of seemingly powerful empires
run by weak, divided elites]{.underline} and picked apart by outside
powers. The Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth, a vast aristocratic republic
that dominated Eastern Europe in one form or another from the 14th to
the 18th century, was wiped off the map by its neighbors, who found they
could bribe its senators into paralyzing all political decisions. [The
Ottoman Empire]{.underline} of the mid-19th century [was]{.underline}
infamously [dubbed "the sick man of Europe" as]{.underline} Western
[European powers]{.underline} [chipped away at its
territories]{.underline} and encouraged independence movements against
it. During the same period, [China under the Qing Dynasty was forced to
give up numerous territorial concessions to European]{.underline}
colonial [empires]{.underline}---all of which, in turn, would themselves
disintegrate within a century. [It may seem absurd to compare
the]{.underline} [U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates in 2019
[to]{.underline} the [decadent and crumbling imperial powers of the
past]{.underline}. **[But consider the state of the capital right
now.]{.underline}** President **[Donald Trump]{.underline}**, as almost
everyone at least privately concedes, [**is incompetent at fulfilling
his most basic responsibilities and a global laughingstock.** Trump's
administration is openly bought by foreign governments]{.underline} [via
his international network of hotels]{.underline} and resorts, including
the one located directly between the White House and the U.S. Capitol,
where a Saudi-funded lobbyist rented 500 rooms in the month after the
2016 election. His political party, which still controls the Senate and
increasingly dominates the judiciary, has no interest in holding him
accountable for any of this. And of course there's the small matter of
Russian interference [in the 2016 election]{.underline}; as the limited
information known so far from special counsel Robert Mueller's report
confirms, [Trump and the Republicans were]{.underline} at the very least
[the passive and willing beneficiaries of efforts by a foreign power to
influence the election outcome. **But Trump is only a
symptom**]{.underline}, [the most blatant]{.underline} and cartoonish
[example of how **the influence of outside money in Washington has
become routine**]{.underline} over the past generation. From the
pervasive influence of the United Arab Emirates and other Gulf
monarchies over think tanks and media organizations to virtually the
entire U.S. government kowtowing before the American Israel Public
Affairs Committee to China's warm relationship with the Chamber of
Commerce and with the heads of some of the most powerful U.S. companies
to the funneling of foreign money through the real estate industries of
the country's largest and wealthiest cities---the U.S. government is for
sale. To be sure, it isn't only, or even primarily, foreign money that
rules Washington. [Powerful corporate interests]{.underline} in general
[have]{.underline} almost completely [crowded out democratic
accountability in the capital]{.underline}, including major U.S.-based
industries such as finance, insurance, energy, and tech. Then again, [is
there any such thing as a U.S.-based industry anymore?]{.underline} Most
of [the biggest companies are multinational]{.underline}, with
headquarters in major cities around the world and executives whose
staggering wealth means they have more in common socially with their
international counterparts than with most Americans. The complete
deregulation of campaign finance and the subsequent legalization of
corruption in Washington, on a scale unheard of in other developed
countries, have resulted in a capital where the distinction between
foreign and domestic monied interests is harder and harder to parse.
[The U.S. government]{.underline}, in other words, does not exist to
serve the interests of Americans through either its foreign or its
domestic policies; rather, it [exists to perpetuate the interests of the
globalized oligarchy]{.underline}. [There's an obvious counterargument
to all of this:]{.underline} The United States still spends more on
defense than the next seven countries combined, and it still operates a
network of hundreds of military bases spread across nearly half the
countries on Earth. [No other country remotely rivals the United
States]{.underline} in its ability to project [military
power]{.underline}. And no other country is as wealthy or mints the
global reserve currency or wields as much soft power. At the same time,
[focusing entirely on the American empire from the top down can confuse
causality]{.underline}. Focusing entirely on the American empire from
the top down can confuse causality. [Consider]{.underline}, for
instance[, the overthrow of Egypt's]{.underline} post-Arab Spring
elected leader [Mohamed Morsi in a 2013 coup]{.underline}. In former
White House advisor [Ben Rhodes]{.underline}'s memoir, he
[describes]{.underline} President Barack [Obama's
administration]{.underline} not as the driving force behind this coup
but [as the passive recipient of relentless pressure from its Saudi and
Emirati allies]{.underline}, who waged an information campaign against
the U.S. ambassador while plotting with the Egyptian military. Rhodes
writes that he personally received a photo in the mail portraying the
U.S. ambassador as an accomplice of the Muslim Brotherhood from Yousef
al-Otaiba, the ubiquitous, hard-partying, extremely well-connected
Emirati ambassador in Washington. While [Rhodes and Obama]{.underline}
also faced pressure from within the Washington establishment, they
[found their agenda for the Middle East repeatedly hijacked by foreign
allies]{.underline}---the same governments that also lobbied, with
varying success, for U.S. military operations from Syria to Yemen.
**[American power, however mighty, means nothing if it's being used for
the ends of the highest bidders.]{.underline}** So what if **[the
American empire is coming apart at the seams]{.underline}**? Good
riddance, many would say. **[U.S. hegemony has been a
disaster]{.underline}**, **[spreading war and exploitation around the
globe and poisoning the climate beyond repair]{.underline}**. And that's
true: As Asimov observed, empires tend to fall because they overextend
themselves, spoil their elites, and produce the preconditions for their
own demise. But what we're seeing is neither a considered, responsible
withdrawal from empire in order to invest in urgent needs at home nor a
revolt against empire by the world's wretched. Rather, **[it's a
drawn-out, decadent collapse]{.underline}** recognizable to any student
of Rome or Constantinople. **[America is the sick man of the 21st
century]{.underline}**, and anyone who has watched its president bumble
through a gathering of bemused, pitying world leaders knows it.

### 2AC -- No Heg

#### The US no longer has hegemony -- Trump and the 2008 crisis collapsed it

**Tak-sing 2/14** (Tsang Tak-sing, Former Secretary for Home Affairs,
2-14-2019, \"The end of US liberal hegemony,\"
http://www.ejinsight.com/20190214-the-end-of-us-liberal-hegemony/)

In his New Year speech for 2019, Chinese President Xi Jinping warned
that ["we're facing a period of major change never seen in a
century."]{.underline} So what is likely to come to an end and what is
likely to emerge in this "period of major change"? [According to a
number of prestigious international relations scholars]{.underline} in
the United States, such as Stephen M. Walt of Harvard University, Barry
Posen of Massachusetts Institute of Technology, and John Mearsheimer of
the University of Chicago, [among all the things that are likely to
disappear in the future is American hegemony. In his new book, "The
Great Delusion: Liberal Dreams and International Realities", Mearsheimer
has declared in no uncertain terms **the end of the US "liberal
hegemony".**]{.underline} Mearsheimer noted that [since the end of the
Cold War in the early 1990s, the US has been adopting a global strategy
of facilitating its liberal hegemony in order to serve three goals: 1.
to promote, around the globe, US democratic ideologies as a set of
universal values; 2. to facilitate the integration of countries in the
world into the global market and the free economic system, and 3. to
establish supranational bodies to regulate other nations on American
terms.]{.underline} Mearsheimer contends that [the reason
why]{.underline} [the US has been embracing this strategy]{.underline}
over the past 30 years [is that]{.underline}, subjectively speaking[,
both the Republican and Democratic elites]{.underline} in Washington
[are firm believers in a set of libertarian ideologies]{.underline}, and
have acquired a sense of superiority. As a result, these US elites would
often attempt to shape the world based on America's own facets. Then,
objectively speaking, [under the unipolar world order following the
disintegration of the former Soviet Union in 1991, the US has remained
the world's superpower which is basically free to do whatever it
wants.]{.underline} It is against such a unique historical background
that the world has witnessed, over the past two decades, America's
active and successive military interventions in Iraq, Afghanistan, Libya
and Syria, not to mention the suppression of Iran, the facilitation of
the eastward expansion of NATO, as well as its roles in the "Color
Revolutions" in Eastern Europe and the Arab Spring. [Under the US
liberal hegemony, the sovereignty of other nations is often pushed to
the sidelines. However, ironically, **the fact that the US has been
throwing its weight around on the world scene hasn't made it
stronger.**]{.underline} Moreover, [according to the statistics of some
independent institutions, **the number of countries around the world
that practice liberal democracy has actually gone into
decline.**]{.underline} As Mearsheimer has put it, [what happened over
the last two decades around the world has indicated that nationalism and
pragmatism have always been able to prevail over
liberalism.]{.underline} And the [**American liberal hegemony has become
increasingly unsustainable** as today's world has changed from being
unipolar to multipolar,]{.underline} looking from an objective
perspective of the world situation. In particular, [the 2008 global
financial tsunami has taken a heavy toll on the soft power of the
US.]{.underline} And [since US President Donald Trump was voted into
office in 2016 with a strong public mandate of making America great
again, he has radically deviated from the policy approach adopted by the
traditional political establishment in Washington, and subverted the
original goals of the US liberal hegemony. Under his "America First"
policy, Trump has replaced free trade with protectionism, and pulled his
country out of international organizations and treaties one after
another.]{.underline} Mearsheimer believes [**Trump's rise to power has
officially marked the end of the global strategy of promoting liberal
hegemony** adopted by the US over the last 30 years.]{.underline}

[America's fixation with primacy]{.underline} and military dominance,
while now the orthodoxy, [is]{.underline} a [relatively
recent]{.underline} thing. It was initially intended as a temporary
expedient to help stave off the Soviet Union as Europe and other regions
rebuilt [after World War II]{.underline} and dozens of new nations
emerged out of the former European colonial empires. But during the
course of the Cold War, [the United States somehow became addicted to
primacy]{.underline}, no longer [seeing it as]{.underline} a temporary
expedient but as [the new normal.]{.underline} It didn't have to be this
way. When the Soviet Union collapsed in 1991, the United States might
have considered its global mission complete, disengaged from all but the
most vital parts of the world, and undertaken a major military
demobilization. Instead, political leaders opted for a smaller but even
more advanced and adept military, seeking to "overmatch" any potential
adversary. Along the way, the use of armed force became the tool of
first resort in American statecraft, supplanting the balanced mix of
military, diplomatic and economic power that characterized America's
Cold War strategy. Although a few policy experts and political leaders
have advocated a more restrained approach to national security,
[most]{.underline} of them, both [Republicans and Democrats, remain
committed to global primacy]{.underline} and military dominance.
**[Making the case for this requires convincing the public that the
alternatives are dangerous,]{.underline}** even frightening. The
National Defense Strategy Commission report hits this theme hard. "The
security and wellbeing of the United States are at greater risk than at
any time in decades," it warns. "[America's military
superiority]{.underline}---the hard-power backbone of its global
influence and national security---[has eroded to a dangerous
degree]{.underline}. [Rivals and adversaries are challenging the United
States on many fronts]{.underline} and in many domains. [America's
ability to defend its allies]{.underline}, its partners, and its own
vital interests [is increasingly in doubt]{.underline}. If the nation
does not act promptly to remedy these circumstances, the consequences
will be grave and lasting." [Americans are so accustomed to global
primacy]{.underline} and military dominance [that they have difficulty
imagining other options]{.underline} or seriously weighing the costs
against the benefits. The implication of this dark perspective is that
the U.S. defense budget, which is already the largest on earth by far,
needs to be increased. Just this week, the Senate Armed Services
Committee heard testimony from the commission and used it to call for
even more Pentagon funding. But what the National Defense Strategy
Commission or any equivalent group hasn't done is seriously examine or
reckon with the underlying assumptions of this orthodox strategy. For
instance, [advocates assume that without U.S. military
dominance]{.underline}, [the global system]{.underline}---or at least
some parts of it---[will devolve into conflict]{.underline} or fall
under the control of hostile nations that might keep the United States
out of the regions they monopolize. That was a valid concern during the
Cold War when America faced an expansionistic Soviet Union bent on world
domination. [But it no longer is]{.underline}. [The idea
that]{.underline} China, Russia, Iran or [some]{.underline} other
[adversary might shut out American businesses for political reasons is
farfetched in today's interconnected global economy]{.underline}. Yet
the idea that America's economic health depends on primacy and military
dominance has been repeated so often that it is an article of faith
among mainstream policy experts and political leaders. [Another
questionable assumption is that the U]{.underline}nited
[S]{.underline}tates [must]{.underline} be capable of
[militarily]{.underline} [overmatch]{.underline}ing [any potential
adversary]{.underline}. [While military dominance is certainly
nice]{.underline} to have, [the only way to sustain it is by increased
deficit spending, cutting entitlements]{.underline} like Social Security
and Medicare, diminishing investment in health care, infrastructure and
education, [or increasing taxes]{.underline}. Making the Department of
Defense more efficient, which is often touted as a magic bullet, is a
good idea, but even the National Defense Strategy Commission admitted
that [it will not be enough to sustain]{.underline}, much less increase,
[America's military dominance]{.underline}. Today though, **[Americans
are so accustomed to global primacy]{.underline}** and military
dominance **[that they have difficulty imagining other options or
seriously weighing the costs against the benefits.]{.underline}** As
Patrick Porter, a professor of strategic studies at the University of
Exeter, puts it, "[Alternative grand strategies]{.underline} based on
restraint and retrenchment [are hardly entertained]{.underline}, and
debate is narrowed into questions of execution and implementation." So
long as this continues, the United States will remain stubbornly
committed to its quest for global primacy and military dominance, hoping
against hope that some elixir of Pentagon reform and increased support
from U.S. allies will make it work. **[Eventually, though, this myth
will collapse]{.underline}**, and **[then a serious debate about
America's role in the world will really begin.]{.underline}**

Four hundred miles further north, in one of Kenya's city-sized refugee
camps, there's another sign of what global leadership used to look like:
sacks of split peas, stamped USAID; a handful of young, quiet Americans
working on idealistic development projects. I saw both this month, but
one already looks like a relic of the past. [The baton of global
leadership is being passed from the U.S. to China. In Africa, the
evidence is everywhere]{.underline}. China will put nearly \$90 billion
into the continent this year, the United States nothing close. [China is
betting big on economic partnerships and dependencies along its new Silk
Road,]{.underline} christened ["One Belt, One Road."]{.underline} [The
U.S., meanwhile, spends many of its dollars on expensive wars, to the
detriment of soft-power projects like USAID, or domestic
welfare]{.underline} programs [like Medicaid. **America's global
influence is certain to decline**]{.underline} relatively in the years
ahead; it is the inevitable consequence of the return of the Middle
Kingdom. As that happens, the U.S. should be more deliberate about the
policy choices it makes. It's a lesson I've seen my own country---which
was once an empire, too---learn the hard way. [On the way down from
global hegemony,]{.underline} [Britain came around too slowly to
investing in domestic welfare]{.underline}. The U.S. should apply those
lessons sooner. [The time is ripe]{.underline}. **[Its 45th president
swung to power on the backs of voters worn out by]{.underline}** the
burden of **[expensive wars, tired of wartime austerity, and fed up with
rising inequality]{.underline}**. **[America has spent nearly \$6
trillion]{.underline}** **[on]{.underline}** sustaining long-running
conflicts in **[Afghanistan and Iraq]{.underline}**. Median wages
haven't gone up in decades. **[Its health-care inequality is a byword in
failure, infant mortality barely better than that of developing
countries, and some states' death rates are soaring]{.underline}**
because of "diseases of despair." It's clear that [many voters gave up
on the American empire]{.underline}. [When they voted in 2016, they
didn't care for the international institutions the U.S. had so carefully
constructed]{.underline} after World War II: [nato; the United Nations;
the World Bank]{.underline}. [They didn't care for their country to
protect the liberal world order]{.underline}, to lead the "Free World."
Voters on the left and the right showed their readiness for a policy
turn inwards. [They wanted a country focused on domestic
policies]{.underline}. (These are my own views, and not those of my
organization.) [A similar thing happened in Britain after World War
II]{.underline}. In 1945, the Labour leader Clement [Attlee campaigned
on bettering the lives of Britons]{.underline} at the bottom. He
promised welfare over warfare: a national health service, social
security, public housing. It won him the election; [scoring an upset win
against]{.underline} the man who had just brought Britain its finest
victory in a global war, [Winston Churchill.]{.underline} But [in the
tumultuous years that followed, Attlee wasn't]{.underline} able or
[willing to fully scale down spending on the army]{.underline} and the
Empire. When Churchill came back after him in 1951, India and other
colonies had already won their independence, but the over-spending on
foreign intervention and the military remained. **[The result was a
delay of the inevitable decline of the Empire, but also a half-baked
welfare state,]{.underline}** which couldn't provide for its citizens
the promises that Attlee envisaged. During a series of international
conflicts from the early 1950s to the early 1970s, [Britain continued to
lose not only territory]{.underline} in Africa, the Middle East, and
Asia, [but also vast amounts of money and human capital, which could
have otherwise been deployed to the betterment of its
people]{.underline}. In Cyprus, Kenya, Oman, Yemen, the Suez Canal, the
British possessions in Southeast Asia, and elsewhere, Britain spent vast
amounts in a futile effort to retain some its imperial power. I don't
long for the days of the British Empire. My family spent its
vainglorious reign digging ironstone from the ground. The imperial sun
never shone down the mine shafts of northeast England. But I know the
end of the Empire did not mean the end of Britain, or that of the
wellbeing of its citizens. Quite the contrary: the Britain I grew up in
provided me and my family with educational opportunities and health care
we'd never have known had Britain not attempted to build a welfare state
at home. Those of us on the global sidelines, [America's anxious
auxiliaries, know a collapse in the instruments of a nation's power when
it happens.]{.underline} In Britain that collapse was precipitated by
the left's loathing of imperialism. [In the United States, it has come
from the right's loathing of "globalism."]{.underline} America remains a
global power, but [in the world's capitals, policymakers are now
puzzling out which alliances and organizations will shape the
future]{.underline}. Entropy rules over empire.

-- and threatening other countries with sanctions if they do not join
this crusade -- [is driving European and other nations to create their
alternative financial institutions.]{.underline} This break has been
building for quite some time, and was bound to occur. But who would have
thought that [Donald Trump would become the catalytic
agent]{.underline}? No left-wing party, no socialist, anarchist or
foreign nationalist leader anywhere in the world could have achieved
what he is doing to break up the American Empire. [The Deep State is
reacting with shock at how this right-wing real estate grifter has been
able to drive other countries to defend themselves by dismantling the
U.S.-centered world order]{.underline}. To rub it in, [he is using Bush
and Reagan-era Neocon arsonists]{.underline}, John Bolton and now
Elliott Abrams, [to fan the flames in Venezuela.]{.underline} It is
almost like a black political comedy[. The world of international
diplomacy is being turned inside-out. A world where there is no longer
even a pretense that we might adhere to international norms, let alone
laws or treaties. The Neocons]{.underline} who [Trump]{.underline} has
[appointed]{.underline} [are accomplishing what seemed unthinkable not
long ago: Driving China and Russia together]{.underline} -- the great
nightmare of Henry Kissinger and Zbigniew Brzezinski. [They also are
driving Germany and other European countries into the Eurasian
orbit]{.underline}, the "Heartland" nightmare of Halford Mackinder a
century ago. [The root cause is clear: After the crescendo of pretenses
and deceptions over Iraq, Libya and Syria, along with our absolution of
the lawless regime of Saudi Arabia, foreign political leaders are coming
to recognize what world-wide public opinion polls reported even before
the Iraq/Iran-Contra boys turned their attention to the world's largest
oil reserves in Venezuela: The United States is now the greatest threat
to peace on the planet.]{.underline} Calling the U.S. coup being
sponsored in Venezuela a defense of democracy reveals the Doublethink
underlying U.S. foreign policy. It defines "democracy" to mean
supporting U.S. foreign policy, pursuing neoliberal privatization of
public infrastructure, dismantling government regulation and following
the direction of U.S.-dominated global institutions, from the IMF and
World Bank to NATO. For decades, the resulting foreign wars, domestic
austerity programs and military interventions have brought more
violence, not democracy. In the Devil's Dictionary that U.S. diplomats
are taught to use as their "Elements of Style" guidelines for
Doublethink, a "democratic" country is one that follows U.S. leadership
and opens its economy to U.S. investment, and IMF- and World
Bank-sponsored privatization. The Ukraine is deemed democratic, along
with Saudi Arabia, Israel and other countries that act as U.S. financial
and military protectorates and are willing to treat America's enemies
are theirs too. A point had to come where this policy collided with the
self-interest of other nations, finally breaking through the public
relations rhetoric of empire. Other [countries are proceeding to
de-dollarize and replace what U.S. diplomacy calls "internationalism"
(meaning U.S. nationalism imposed on the rest of the world) with their
own national self-interest.]{.underline} This trajectory could be seen
50 years ago (I described it in Super Imperialism \[1972\] and Global
Fracture \[1978\].) It had to happen. But nobody thought that the end
would come in quite the way that is happening. History has turned into
comedy, or at least irony as its dialectical path unfolds. For the past
half-century, U.S. strategists, the State Department and National
Endowment for Democracy (NED) worried that opposition to U.S. financial
imperialism would come from left-wing parties. It therefore spent
enormous resources manipulating parties that called themselves socialist
(Tony Blair's British Labour Party, France's Socialist Party, Germany's
Social Democrats, etc.) to adopt neoliberal policies that were the
diametric opposite to what social democracy meant a century ago. But
U.S. political planners and Great Wurlitzer organists neglected the
right wing, imagining that it would instinctively support U.S.
thuggishness. The reality is that right-wing parties want to get
elected, and a populist nationalism is today's road to election victory
in Europe and other countries just as it was for Donald Trump in 2016.
[Trump's agenda may really be to break up the American Empire, using the
old Uncle Sucker isolationist rhetoric of half a century
ago.]{.underline} He certainly is going for the Empire's most vital
organs. [But it he a witting anti-American agent? He might as well be --
but it would be a false mental leap to use "quo bono" to assume that he
is a witting agent.]{.underline} After all, [if no U.S. contractor,
supplier, labor union or bank will deal with him, would Vladimir Putin,
China or Iran be any more naïve?]{.underline} Perhaps the problem had to
erupt as a result of the inner dynamics of U.S.-sponsored globalism
becoming impossible to impose when the result is financial austerity,
waves of population flight from U.S.-sponsored wars, and most of all,
U.S. refusal to adhere to the rules and international laws that it
itself sponsored seventy years ago in the wake of World War II.
Dismantling international law and its courts Any international system of
control requires the rule of law. It may be a morally lawless exercise
of ruthless power imposing predatory exploitation, but it is still The
Law. And it needs courts to apply it (backed by police power to enforce
it and punish violators). Here's the first legal contradiction in U.S.
global diplomacy: The United States always has resisted letting any
other country have any voice in U.S. domestic policies, law-making or
diplomacy. That is what makes America "the exceptional nation." But for
seventy years its diplomats have pretended that its superior judgment
promoted a peaceful world (as the Roman Empire claimed to be), which let
other countries share in prosperity and rising living standards. At the
United Nations, U.S. diplomats insisted on veto power. At the World Bank
and IMF they also made sure that their equity share was large enough to
give them veto power over any loan or other policy. Without such power,
the United States would not join any international organization. Yet at
the same time, it depicted its nationalism as protecting globalization
and internationalism. It was all a euphemism for what really was
unilateral U.S. decision-making. Inevitably, U.S. nationalism had to
break up the mirage of One World internationalism, and with it any
thought of an international court. Without veto power over the judges,
the U.S. never accepted the authority of any court, in particular the
United Nations' International Court in The Hague. Recently that court
undertook an investigation into U.S. war crimes in Afghanistan, from its
torture policies to bombing of civilian targets such as hospitals,
weddings and infrastructure. "That investigation ultimately found 'a
reasonable basis to believe that war crimes and crimes against
humanity.'"1 Donald Trump's National Security Adviser John Bolton
erupted in fury, warning in September that: "The United States will use
any means necessary to protect our citizens and those of our allies from
unjust prosecution by this illegitimate court," adding that the UN
International Court must not be so bold as to investigate "Israel or
other U.S. allies." That prompted a senior judge, Christoph Flügge from
Germany, to resign in protest. Indeed, Bolton told the court to keep out
of any affairs involving the United States, promising to ban the Court's
"judges and prosecutors from entering the United States." As Bolton
spelled out the U.S. threat: "We will sanction their funds in the U.S.
financial system, and we will prosecute them in the U.S. criminal
system. We will not cooperate with the ICC. We will provide no
assistance to the ICC. We will not join the ICC. We will let the ICC die
on its own. After all, for all intents and purposes, the ICC is already
dead to us." What this meant, the German judge spelled out was that: "If
these judges ever interfere in the domestic concerns of the U.S. or
investigate an American citizen, \[Bolton\] said the American government
would do all it could to ensure that these judges would no longer be
allowed to travel to the United States -- and that they would perhaps
even be criminally prosecuted." The original inspiration of the Court --
to use the Nuremburg laws that were applied against German Nazis to
bring similar prosecution against any country or officials found guilty
of committing war crimes -- had already fallen into disuse with the
failure to indict the authors of the Chilean coup, Iran-Contra or the
U.S. invasion of Iraq for war crimes. Dismantling Dollar Hegemony from
the IMF to SWIFT [Of all areas of global power politics today,
international finance and foreign investment have become the key
flashpoint]{.underline}. International monetary reserves were supposed
to be the most sacrosanct, and international debt enforcement closely
associated. [Central banks have long held their gold and other monetary
reserves in the United States and London.]{.underline} Back in 1945 this
seemed reasonable, because the New York Federal Reserve Bank (in whose
basement foreign central bank gold was kept) was militarily safe, and
because the London Gold Pool was the vehicle by which the U.S. Treasury
kept the dollar "as good as gold" at \$35 an ounce. Foreign reserves
over and above gold were kept in the form of U.S. Treasury securities,
to be bought and sold on the New York and London foreign-exchange
markets to stabilize exchange rates. Most foreign loans to governments
were denominated in U.S. dollars, so Wall Street banks were normally
name as paying agents. That was the case with Iran under the Shah, whom
the United States had installed after sponsoring the 1953 coup against
Mohammed Mosaddegh when he sought to nationalize Anglo-Iranian Oil (now
British Petroleum) or at least tax it. After the Shah was overthrown,
the Khomeini regime asked its paying agent, the Chase Manhattan bank, to
use its deposits to pay its bondholders. At the direction of the U.S.
Government Chase refused to do so. U.S. courts then declared Iran to be
in default, and froze all its assets in the United States and anywhere
else they were able. This showed that international finance was an arm
of the U.S. State Department and Pentagon. [But]{.underline} that was a
generation ago, and only [recently]{.underline} did [foreign countries
begin to feel queasy about leaving their gold holdings in the United
States, where they might be grabbed at will to punish any country that
might act in ways that U.S. diplomacy found offensive]{.underline}. So
[last year, Germany finally got up the courage to ask that some of its
gold be flown back to Germany.]{.underline} U.S. officials pretended to
feel shocked at the insult that it might do to a civilized Christian
country what it had done to Iran, and Germany agreed to slow down the
transfer. But [then came Venezuela. Desperate to spend its gold reserves
to provide imports for its economy devastated by U.S.
sanctions]{.underline} -- a crisis that U.S. diplomats blame on
"socialism," not on U.S. political attempts to "make the economy scream"
(as Nixon officials said of Chile under Salvador Allende) -- [Venezuela
directed the Bank of England to transfer some of its \$11 billion in
gold held in its vaults and those of other central banks in December
2018]{.underline}. This was just like a bank depositor would expect a
bank to pay a check that the depositor had written. England refused to
honor the official request, following the direction of Bolton and U.S.
Secretary of State Michael Pompeo. As Bloomberg reported: "The U.S.
officials are trying to steer Venezuela's overseas assets to \[Chicago
Boy Juan\] Guaido to help bolster his chances of effectively taking
control of the government. The \$1.2 billion of gold is a big chunk of
the \$8 billion in foreign reserves held by the Venezuelan central
bank."2 Turkey seemed to be a likely destination, prompting Bolton and
Pompeo to warn it to desist from helping Venezuela, threatening
sanctions against it or any other country helping Venezuela cope with
its economic crisis. As for the Bank of England and other European
countries, the Bloomberg report concluded: "Central bank officials in
Caracas have been ordered to no longer try contacting the Bank of
England. These central bankers have been told that Bank of England
staffers will not respond to them." This led to rumors that Venezuela
was selling 20 tons of gold via a Russian Boeing 777 -- some \$840
million. The money probably would have ended up paying Russian and
Chinese bondholders as well as buying food to relieve the local famine.3
Russia denied this report, but Reuters has confirmed is that Venezuela
has sold 3 tons of a planned 29 tones of gold to the United Arab
Emirates, with another 15 tones are to be shipped on Friday, February
1.4 The U.S. Senate's Batista-Cuban hardliner Rubio accused this of
being "theft," as if feeding the people to alleviate the U.S.-sponsored
crisis was a crime against U.S. diplomatic leverage. If there is any
country that U.S. diplomats hate more than a recalcitrant Latin American
country, it is Iran. President Trump's breaking of the 2015 nuclear
agreements negotiated by European and Obama Administration diplomats has
escalated to the point of threatening Germany and other European
countries with punitive sanctions if they do not also break the
agreements they have signed. Coming on top of U.S. opposition to German
and other European importing of Russian gas, the U.S. threat finally
prompted Europe to find a way to defend itself. Imperial threats are no
longer military. No country (including Russia or China) can mount a
military invasion of another major country. Since the Vietnam Era, the
only kind of war a democratically elected country can wage is atomic, or
at least heavy bombing such as the United States has inflicted on Iraq,
Libya and Syria. But [now, cyber warfare has become a way of pulling out
the connections of any economy. And the major cyber connections are
financial money-transfer ones]{.underline}, [headed by
SWIFT]{.underline}, the acronym for the Society for Worldwide Interbank
Financial Telecommunication, which is centered in Belgium. [Russia and
China have already moved to create a shadow bank-transfer system in case
the United States unplugs them from SWIFT.]{.underline} But now,
European countries have come to realize that threats by Bolton and
Pompeo may lead to heavy fines and asset grabs if they seek to continue
trading with Iran as called for in the treaties they have negotiated.

The [Trump]{.underline} administration [has embarked on a major public
relations offensive to counter China's growing influence]{.underline} in
Latin America. [But]{.underline}, so far, [the U.S. effort is failing
miserably.]{.underline} Earlier this week, [a new survey]{.underline} by
the CADEM polling firm [in Chile - one of the closest U.S.
allies]{.underline} in Latin America - [showed that 77 percent of
Chileans have a positive image of China, whereas only 61 percent have a
positive image of the United States]{.underline}. [The same is
happening]{.underline} in several other Latin American countries. [In
Mexico,]{.underline} 57 percent of those polled have a favorable view of
China, compared with 43 percent who have a favorable view of the United
States, according to a 2018 Latinobarómetro poll. In Argentina, 51
percent see China favorably, compared with 45 percent who view the
United States that way. In Peru, China wins the public opinion race by
59 to 56 percent. In Venezuela, China is ahead by 63 percent to 62
percent, the Latinobarómetro survey shows. Granted, several other
countries in the region, including Brazil, Colombia, and most Central
American countries, still like the United States better. But **[public
support for the United States in the region is falling, after years of
growing Latin American trade ties with China]{.underline}**. [China's
trade with Latin America has soared from \$17 billion]{.underline} in
2002 [to \$306 billion]{.underline} last year, and China has already
become the top trading partner of Brazil, Chile, Peru and Uruguay.
Alarmed by all of this, [the Trump administration has begun to publicly
ask Latin American countries to distance themselves from]{.underline}
the [Beijing]{.underline} regime. During a trip to the region in
October, 2018, U.S. vice president Mike [Pence]{.underline} had [lashed
out against China's "predatory economic activity" in Latin
America]{.underline}. Similarly, during a tour of Latin American
countries earlier this month, U.S. Secretary of State Mike [Pompeo said
that China "injects corrosive capital into the economic bloodstream,
giving life to corruption]{.underline} and eroding good governance" in
Latin America. U.S. officials say that China spurs corruption in the
region, because Chinese companies are not subject to strong anti-bribery
laws. U.S. officials also say that Chinese firms are hurting Latin
America by investing almost exclusively in extracting and transporting
raw materials, this deepening the region's dependence on commodities. By
comparison, U.S. investments tend to be in manufacturing and services,
which generate better paid and more sophisticated jobs. [But most Latin
American officials, while agreeing with the U.S. concerns about China,
are not surprised by the decline of America's popularity in the
region.]{.underline} **[The reason is simple, and it's called Donald
Trump]{.underline}**, they say. Indeed, **[the U.S. image in Latin
America]{.underline}** - and around the world **[- has taken a major hit
since Trump took office]{.underline}**, according to a separate Pew
Research Center poll. In Latin America, [Trump's crusade to build a
border wall, his]{.underline} bizarre [claims that]{.underline} most
Mexican [undocumented immigrants are "criminals" and "rapists," and his
claim that]{.underline} several [Latin American nations are "shithole
countries" have badly damaged the U.S. image.]{.underline} Furthermore,
Trump's [withdrawal from the]{.underline}
[T]{.underline}rans-[P]{.underline}acific [P]{.underline}artnership
trade agreement [and]{.underline} his [calls for cutting foreign aid to
Central America have further advanced the impression]{.underline} that
the United States is a selfish power, and a bad neighbor. Meantime, much
of what China has to do to gain influence in the region is to remain
relatively quiet, and be visible. China's leader Xi Jin Ping has already
visited the region four times since he took office in 2013. Trump has
made only one trip to the region, for a G-20 meeting of the world's
biggest economies in Argentina. Except for his valid criticism of
Venezuela, Nicaragua and Cuba, [most of Trump's Latin America policy has
been marked by hostility]{.underline}.

new Conventional Arms Transfer (CAT) policy designed to increase the
already well-established U.S. dominance of the global arms
market.]{.underline} Increasing arms exports is seen as an important
part of the administration's aim to strengthen America's economy and
security. Traditionally, [U.S. arms exports have been used as tools of
power and influence, giving it political leverage over clients.
Paradoxically, however,]{.underline} [**the emphasis placed on the
economic utility of arms sales** by the Trump administration **is**
increasing the bargaining power of clients, thereby **reducing U.S.
political sway**]{.underline}. [The leverage of client states and the

because of national security considerations, [could undermine U.S.
defense sales by driving up prices or by prompting retaliation from

The United States is in the midst of a great debate about how to
maintain its national security and global preeminence in the face of
enormous fiscal challenges.1 Without changing tax or spending policies,
[the fiscal trends are clearly negative]{.underline}, and [reducing U.S.
security commitments is]{.underline} seen as [one way of reducing the
long-term federal budget deficit]{.underline}. But reducing security
commitments may have other costs beyond the immediate budget savings,
and so [this]{.underline} decision calls for a full investigation of the
costs and benefits of U.S. security commitments. Even with direct fiscal
savings that may result, **[reducing these commitments may not
have]{.underline}** as much of **[an effect on the long-term budget
balance]{.underline}** as hoped. New analysis has assessed the cost of
some of **[these commitments]{.underline}** and found that they [**are
relatively inexpensive**.]{.underline}2 However, despite a growing
literature questioning the value of U.S. security commitments,3 [there
has been little rigorous evaluation to date of the value of these
commitments]{.underline}. Part of the reason is theoretical: The
[analysis has been based on qualitative theories]{.underline} and
analysis rather than solid data. And part of the reason is practical:
Solid data have not existed. We do not argue for the superiority of
quantitative over qualitative analysis. Indeed, we recognize that our
data are imperfect and may not completely measure the level or depth of
U.S. security commitments. However, the overall question of the effect
of security commitments on economic performance calls for quantitative
analysis, and the use of quantitative data can provide new insights.
Accordingly, we have created new, usable data to apply to the problem.
We find evidence that U.S. external security commitments do have
positive effects on U.S. trade and GDP, and even on global trade,
suggesting that the various streams of the engagement school constitute
a good generalization of the effects of U.S. foreign security
involvements. And though **[we do not find significant evidence that
U.S. external security commitments can have a positive effect on
reducing political violence,]{.underline}** we present evidence that
these security relationships can decrease trade costs. We do not believe
that this is the final word, and we expect that much more work will need
to be done. Indeed, there are a number of weaknesses in our analysis.

One example is a data set of planned, but not implemented, changes to
military presence and security agreements. Addressing the commitment
measurement problems will require generating new data sets of force
structures and assets, such as ships and aircraft, on a more-frequent
basis than once a year. It may also require further development of our
new security agreement data set to allow different types of agreements
to be characterized in more detail. Therefore, future analysis is
necessary and should strive to produce better measures. Despite these
limitations, the nature of the question calls for quantitative analysis.
Although not determinative, such analysis is necessary, and that means
that using the best data and methods available is key. This paper has
done exactly that, and it should serve as a building block for both
conducting future analysis and properly informing the current debate
about the nature of U.S. security commitments. Our results indicate that
[U.S. policymakers should carefully weigh]{.underline} the [potential
losses against the potential gains]{.underline} [when considering
large-scale retrenchments of U.S. overseas security
commitments]{.underline}. [The direct savings may be
substantial]{.underline}, although there is a pretty wide variance in
the estimates of these direct savings. Existing estimates suggest that
[retrenchment could bring annual GDP gains of \$139
billion]{.underline}, \$44 billion, or just \$9 billion, depending on
the source.4 There are likely to be indirect savings as well.5 However,
the annual indirect costs of up to \$490 billion that we find in this
analysis are likely to be far larger than any savings. Policymakers who
reduce these commitments would face not only the immediate problems of
how and where to make the reductions but also the future problems of a
poorer United States.

[Concerns about Chinese, Russian, and Iranian forays are
overblown.]{.underline} Many U.S. and Latin American [experts who

two inaccuracies. First, they [confuse diplomatic statements and
military realities]{.underline}. Second, [they reckon that the military
policies of China, Russia, Iran, and India towards Latin America are
generating a disturbing imbalance that is detrimental to

emphasis on then-Secretary of State John Kerry's 2013 speech announcing
the end of the Monroe Doctrine. In practice, however, [the Defense
Department and especially U.S. Southern Command, have reaffirmed their
supremacy in Latin America]{.underline}. The latter tendency requires a
bit more unpacking. T[here is no doubt that China's economic growth is
being accompanied by an incipient military projection beyond its
regional area of influence]{.underline}, including attempts to boost
arms exports to Latin America. Yet **[Bejing's effective military impact
upon Latin America in the region remains low]{.underline}** --- with the
exception of its arms exports to Venezuela. Russia is the region's
largest foreign arms supplier: since 2013, according to SIPRI, Moscow

officials are very frequent and in some years they have surpassed trips
by diplomats.]{.underline} There are some 1,200 uniformed military and
civilians dealing with Latin America in SouthCom, more than the total of
officials from various government agencies in Washington. [The political

Paraguay]{.underline}, Ivan [Duque and]{.underline} Mario Abdo

To sum up, the United States remains undoubtedly, and by far, the primus
inter pares on military affairs vis-à-vis Latin America. [The acceptance
of the idea,]{.underline} both in Latin America and the United States,
[that military policies by China, Russia, and Iran towards the area are
alarming is questionable]{.underline}. The available evidence does not
support such fear. **[U.S. military primacy in the Americas is

### 2AC -- Saudi -- L/T

#### Unconditional arms sales to Saudi Arabia allows for atrocities and hurts US credibility

**Guay 18** (Terrence Guay, Assistant Professor of Political Science,
and Director of Graduate Studies for the International Relations
Program, in the Maxwell School of Citizenship and Public Affairs of
Syracuse University, 10-19-2018, \"Arms sales to Saudi Arabia give Trump
all the leverage he needs in Khashoggi affair,\" Conversation,
https://theconversation.com/arms-sales-to-saudi-arabia-give-trump-all-the-leverage-he-needs-in-khashoggi-affair-104998)

However, [the president has it wrong when he argues the U.S. would be
"foolish" to use these sales as leverage with the Saudis, claiming they
could just get their tanks and fighter jets from other countries. In
fact it's one of the best bargaining chips he has with the kingdom.
Saudi Arabia is indeed a major weapons buyer. Saudi Arabia spent
US\$69.4 billion on military expenditures in 2017,]{.underline}
according to the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute, the
world's leading research organization on conflict, armaments, arms
control and disarmament. Only the U.S. and China spent more. [But since
it doesn't have an arms industry]{.underline} -- like the U.S. and China
[-- Saudi Arabia must import most of that from other
countries.]{.underline} That's why, over the past decade, Saudi Arabia
has imported more armaments than every country but India. And U.S.
companies such as Boeing, Lockheed Martin and Raytheon have benefited
most from all that spending, making up the 55 percent of its weapons
imports from 2008 to 2017. [That has made Saudi Arabia the top buyer of
American arms]{.underline}, with 11.8 percent of all sales over that
period. In fact, U.S. defense contractors have made almost \$90 billion
selling arms to Saudi Arabia since 1950. In recent years, fighter planes
like the F-15 and their spare parts have become particularly important
to the weapons trade with Saudi Arabia because it needs them to conduct
its bombing campaigns in Yemen. For example, a 2011 contract awarded
\$30 billion to U.S. defense contractors to produce 84 F-15 jets and
other weaponry for the Saudi military. Boeing stands to earn \$24
billion of this total, which the company claimed will support over
50,000 U.S. jobs. A bargain over human rights As president, Trump
clearly hopes that the money continues to pour in and helps him with his
"America First" campaign, intended to create jobs for Americans. It's no
surprise, then, that he made his first foreign trip as president to
Saudi Arabia in May 2017. During the trip, he reportedly struck a
bargain with Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman: Trump wouldn't
lecture his kingdom on human rights, and Saudi Arabia would buy more
American weapons. Unfortunately, [Trump's claim to have secured \$110
billion in arms sales has not materialized. Although the Saudis signed
numerous letters of intent and interest, some of which had been approved
by the Obama administration, no new contracts have resulted, due mainly
to lower oil prices and the Saudis' costly war in Yemen. So]{.underline}
in the Khashoggi affair, [it appears that Trump is eager to keep to his
end of the bargain. He has avoided criticizing the Saudi government over
its alleged role in Khashoggi's disappearance to curry favor with the
monarchy over arms sales. Even in the face of Turkish reports that Saudi
agents tortured Khashoggi and dismembered his body and U.S. intelligence
supporting those allegations, Trump has preferred to blame "rogue
killers" for any crime.]{.underline} In defending this course of action,
[Trump claimed that "if they don't buy \[weapons\] from us, they're
going to buy it from Russia or they're going to buy it from China or
they're going to buy it from other countries."]{.underline} Smoke

Mohammed US leverage [While it's true that Russia and China are indeed
major exporters of armaments, the claim that U.S. weapons can easily be
replaced by other suppliers is not -- at least not in the short term.
First, once a country is "locked in" to a specific kind of weapons
system, such as planes, tanks or naval vessels, the cost to switch to a
different supplier can be huge. Military personnel must be retrained on
new equipment, spare parts need to be replaced, and operational changes
may be necessary.]{.underline} After [being so reliant on U.S. weapons
systems]{.underline} for decades, [the transition costs to buy from
another country could be prohibitive even for oil-rich Saudi
Arabia.]{.underline} The second problem with Trump's argument is that
armaments from Russia, China or elsewhere are simply not as
sophisticated as U.S. weapons, which is why they are usually cheaper --
though the quality gap is quickly decreasing. To maintain its military
superiority in the Middle East, Saudi Arabia has opted to purchase
virtually all of its weapons from American and European companies. That
is why the U.S. has significant leverage in this aspect of the
relationship[. Any Saudi threat to retaliate against a ban on U.S. arms
sales by buying weapons from countries that have not raised concerns
about the Khashoggi disappearance would not be credible.]{.underline}
And is probably why, despite worries in the White House, such a threat
has not yet been made. Since the end of World War II, the U.S. has
developed a global reputation as a moral authority championing human
rights. Yes, there have been many times when realpolitik took priority.
But despite these moments, [the U.S. managed also to maintain its
authority by advocating respect for human rights as a global norm during
the Cold War, and within many repressive regimes ever
since]{.underline}. [With Khashoggi, **Trump is choosing to give up that
mantle completely by showing his priority is purely economic, regardless
of the impact on the United States' global reputation.** **Such a**
bald-faced **strategy**, in my view, **sells American values short and
weakens U.S. global credibility.**]{.underline}

Graham Allison understands this perfectly. His book extends and
amplifies the warning he has been sounding for some years now about the
nature of the rivalry emerging in Asia between America and China, and
the dangers that it poses. The key lesson he draws from his extended
analysis of analogous events throughout history is that contests between
rising and declining major powers over their respective places in the
international system are precisely why they have most often gone to war
with one another, with disastrous consequences. [Allison does not
believe that the escalating rivalry between America and China makes war
"inevitable]{.underline}." 56 Rather, he perceives a serious risk of war
when such contests arise because great powers see their deepest national
interests at stake. He argues quite convincingly that this is exactly
the kind of contest we now see between America and China. He rebuts the
argument that China lacks the power or resolve to challenge the United
States in Asia, and he sees no reason to assume that in the contest that
is consequently unfolding either side will limit itself to "measures
short of war." Therefore, the danger of escalating rivalry and conflict
with China is real, and the consequences of a conflict when both powers
have nuclear forces is incalculable. That means our first concern must
be to find ways to avoid conflict with China. All this, I think, is
right. To address this question, Allison extends his work on previous
episodes of great power rivalry to focus not just on those that did
result in war, but also on those that did not. His aim is to help us see
how competing great powers avoided war in the past, looking for lessons
that apply today. Although he doesn't put it quite this way, the key
conclusion to be drawn from his study is very simple: [war can be
avoided when a rising power confronts an established one, but only by
real compromise and accommodation on both sides]{.underline}. Hence
[while war is not inevitable when a new great power arises, major
changes in the international order are]{.underline}. The mistake of
current U.S. policy is not to see this, but instead to assume --- as
Wright does --- that the current status quo of American leadership can
be preserved without risking a major war. [Americans must]{.underline}
therefore [ask themselves whether]{.underline}, as Allison puts it,
"[maintaining U.S. primacy in the western Pacific \[is\] truly a vital
national interest?"]{.underline}57 He concludes that [it
isn't.]{.underline} He argues that [America should therefore abandon its
ambition to preserve the status quo, and instead accept a significant
change in its role in Asia]{.underline} [through]{.underline} some kind
of [understanding with China]{.underline}. In his book's penultimate
chapter, he offers several suggestions about how this might be done. He
mentions [accommodating China, negotiating a long peace, or redefining
the relationship to focus on common threats]{.underline}. All of these
seem to me to be versions of the same idea --- [to accept China as at
least a co-equal leading power in Asia]{.underline}. [That means
preserving a strong U.S. role in Asia while being willing to adjust
American aims and purposes to respect what China sees as its core
interests]{.underline} and objectives in the region.

it shows the United States is "serious about protecting the interests of
our nation," and will help Kiev "push back against growing Russian
aggression." It is more likely, however, that this sale will accomplish
the opposite. [The official press release from the Defense Security
Cooperation Agency (DSCA) in regards to the sale
[claimed](http://www.dsca.mil/major-arms-sales/ukraine-javelin-missiles-and-command-launch-units)
that the weapons "will contribute to the foreign policy and national
security of the United States by improving the security of
Ukraine.]{.underline}" Yet it is no small distinction to point out that
Ukraine is not an ally of the United States, and we must question why
improving their security is worth degrading our relations with a
nuclear-armed Russia. A military alliance is a commitment to another
party that we will sacrifice American sons and daughters for their
benefit. [**To make such a significant sacrifice, there must be a vital
national interest at stake for America.** As important, entering into an
alliance requires that the other side be willing to sacrifice for our
security, and that the ties result in a benefit to the United States.

[Whether in Ukraine or another international engagement, if an honest
analysis reveals that the United States has merely a secondary or
tertiary interest---rather than a core national interest---yet commits
itself to expending valuable political or military capital, the chances
are high that such engagement would end up costing more than would be
gained.]{.underline} Why should Washington spend money and risk the
lives of our troops for a mission that would leave the country at a net
loss? [In the current standoff in the Ukraine, Washington would
certainly prefer to see a peaceful resolution to the violence. For
Moscow and Kiev, however, the matter is existential, meaning each is
willing to expend considerable capital and take significant risks to
resolve the conflict in their favor.]{.underline} The 210 anti-tank
missiles the State Department authorized is enough to equip four or five
mechanized or infantry battalions for a short period of time. These
missiles could provide a momentary tactical advantage, but
strategically, the quantity is insufficient to tilt the balance of power
with Russia and its allied forces. In the latter stages of the Cold War,
I was an officer in the 2nd Squadron, 2nd Armored Cavalry Regiment (2-2
ACR), a heavily armored unit composed of large numbers of tanks and
armored infantry carriers. In 1991, 2-2 ACR was sent to Iraq to fight
Saddam Hussein's armored divisions, which had invaded Kuwait. At the
Battle of 73 Easting, my squadron (a battalion-sized armored unit),
fought against a brigade of an Iraqi armored division. During that
battle, three cavalry troops of 2nd ACR---approximately the size of one
mechanized battalion---fired [125 tank
rounds](http://www.dtic.mil/dtic/tr/fulltext/u2/a257266.pdf) and eighty
anti-tank missiles. In the span of less than six hours, one
battalion-sized unit fired the equivalent of 38 percent of the entire
missile sale to Ukraine. [Thus, no matter how it is billed in
Washington, **this sale will not "push back" against Russian aggression,
nor is it in the "interests of our nation."** But while sending these
missiles isn't enough to tip the military balance in Ukraine, it is more
than enough to convince Russia to increase its involvement.]{.underline}
[Report

Those missiles represent a clear increase in the risk to Russia and
their proxy forces within eastern Ukraine because it signals that
Washington may be willing to provide even greater lethal support to
their opponent. It is therefore likely Moscow will take stronger action
to counter the threat to discourage even greater American engagement.
This support could take the form of Putin sending more armor, anti-armor
missiles of his own, more unofficial Russian troops, greater
intelligence support for allied forces, or some other response that
brings more violence and destruction to the Donbas region---the people
we're ostensibly trying to help. [Report

with the missile sale may be to increase the pain felt by Putin to drive
him to a negotiated settlement, but **[the actual result will almost

**Arms sales to Ukraine makes European allies nervous**

**Wilkinson 17** (Tracy Wilkinson, Los Angeles Times Washington DC
bureau covering international affairs. Former Mexico/Central America
bureau chief and longtime foreign correspondent, 12-26-2017, \"U.S.
decision to provide anti-tank missiles to Ukraine angers Russian
leaders,\" Los Angeles Times,
https://www.latimes.com/nation/la-fg-us-ukraine-20171226-story.html)

[President Trump's long-delayed decision to provide Ukraine with
defensive lethal weapons]{.underline} signaled a new willingness to
oppose Russian intervention in its neighbor, but has [made European
allies nervous that a recent hike in fighting could
escalate.]{.underline} The State Department said Friday that the
administration would supply the government in Kiev with Javelin
anti-tank missiles to destroy armored vehicles used by Russian-backed
separatists in eastern Ukraine, and to raise the cost of Russia's
intervention in the conflict. The Trump administration said earlier in
the week that it also would permit sales of some small arms to Ukraine
from U.S. manufacturers. Ukraine long had sought the portable
infrared-guided Javelins to blunt the insurgents' advances. But some
U.S. officials worried that providing the weapons could provoke the
Kremlin to step up its military role and ruin any chance of easing
tensions with Moscow. Kurt Volker, Trump's special envoy for Ukraine,
recently warned that the deadliest fighting since February had erupted
in eastern Ukraine. More than 10,000 people have been killed since
mid-2014, when Russian military forces seized the Crimean peninsula and
began supporting armed separatists in eastern Ukraine against the
government in Kiev. Both the Pentagon and State Department had
recommended supplying the anti-tank missiles earlier this year.
Officials in both Washington and Kiev stressed that the anti-tank
missiles are defensive in nature. "American weapons in the hands of
Ukrainian soldiers are not for offensive \[use\], but for stronger
rebuff of the aggressor \[and\] protection of Ukrainian soldiers and
civilians," Ukraine's president, Petro Poroshenko, said on Facebook. "It
is also a trans-Atlantic vaccination against the Russian virus of
aggression." Heather Nauert, the State Department spokeswoman, appeared
to downplay the move. "U.S. assistance is entirely defensive in nature,
and as we have always said, Ukraine is a sovereign country and has a
right to defend itself," she said. Russia, which has officially denied
supporting the insurgents in eastern Ukraine, called the U.S. decision
"dangerous" and said Washington was acting as "an accomplice in fueling
a war." [Sergei Ryabkov, Russia's deputy foreign secretary, also blamed
what he called anti-Russian "Russophobia" in Washington for the decision
to arm what Moscow portrays as fascist Ukrainian nationalists. "U.S.
weapons are capable of leading to new casualties in our neighboring
country, and we cannot remain indifferent to that," Ryabkov said. German
Chancellor Angela Merkel and French President Emmanuel
Macron]{.underline} did not overtly criticize the U.S. decision, but
[urged all combatants to abide by the much-violated 2015 ceasefire deal
known as the Minsk Agreements. France and Germany brokered the
agreement, which called for withdrawal of heavy weapons from frontline
positions,]{.underline} as well as safe delivery of humanitarian aid and
the exchange of prisoners. ["There is no alternative to an exclusively
peaceful solution to the conflict," Merkel and Macron said in a joint
statement.]{.underline}

### 2AC -- Middle East -- I/L Turn

#### Pursuit of hegemony causes middle east instability

**Chengde 18** (Yin Chengde, research fellow of China Foundation for
International Studies., 10-09-2018, \"The US' Pursuit of Hegemony Has
Harmed the Middle East,\" China-US Focus,
https://www.chinausfocus.com/foreign-policy/the-us-pursuit-of-hegemony-has-harmed-the-middle-east)

At this year's United Nations General Assembly, US President Donald
[Trump launched an unprecedentedly strong attack on Iran, pledging to
impose more, and harsher, sanctions on it, and threatened to punish
countries and companies doing business with it.]{.underline}
[This]{.underline} is [reflects]{.underline} the US' ultra-strong
anti-Iran policy, as well as a [plan to extend US hegemony in the Middle
East]{.underline}. In the post-Cold War era, [the US has adopted a
Middle East strategy aiming at exclusive US domination, helping Israel
grow stronger, orchestrating regime change in various countries, and
promoting all-round Westernization. It doesn't even hesitate to topple
governments of sovereign countries by force.]{.underline} During Barack
Obama's second term as US president, in order to shift its strategic
focus eastward to the Asia-Pacific, the US' Middle East strategy
contracted somewhat, and policies tended to be pragmatic. For instance,
it withdrew partially from Iraq, ending the Iraq war that had lasted
nearly a decade; loosened relations with Iran, signing the Iran nuclear
deal; and kept a certain distance from the ultra-rightist Israeli
government. Such moves eased tensions in the turbulent Middle East.
[Conditions have changed abruptly since Trump assumed the presidency. He
reversed Obama's approaches, and redoubled endeavors to promote US
hegemony. He withdrew from the Iran nuclear deal, and restored and
enhanced comprehensive sanctions. He supported Israel and suppressed
Palestine, recognizing Jerusalem as the Israeli capital and moving the
US embassy there, cancelling various aid programs for Palestine,
including humanitarian assistance to Palestinian refugees, closing the
PLO office in Washington, proposing an "ultimate solution" to the
Israel-Palestine conflict that is completely in favor of the former. He
carried out multiple rounds of indiscriminate bombing in Syria,
increased US troops stationed there to more than 2,000, and opened a de
facto exclusive US "enclave" there. More importantly, the Trump
administration is racing against time to organize an anti-Iran alliance
amongst mostly Arab Sunni countries in the Gulf area against Shiite
nations like Iran and Syria, in order to]{.underline} more forcefully
and effectively strike and bring down the Iranian and Syrian
governments, check Russia influence, and, [consolidate its position in
the Middle East. No other US administration in the past three decades
has pursued such a tough strategy of hegemony in the region. The Trump
administration has seriously disturbed and worsened regional
conditions]{.underline}, sinking it in tensions, turmoil, even wars not
seen for many years. First, [it discontinued the Israel-Palestine peace
process, and re-started their conflict.]{.underline} The problem with
Trump's Middle East policy is not just being partial to Israel, but
bullying Palestine, disqualifying itself as a mediator, with Palestine
angrily rejecting the US' mediating role, and suing it for violations of
international law. Second, it instigated and worsened confrontations
between two groups in the region. [By persuading Saudi Arabia-led Arab
Sunni countries to intervene in the Syria war and act against Iran, the
US will inevitably worsen relations between Saudi-led Sunni nations and
Iran-led Shiite ones.]{.underline} The US strategy of fighting Arabs
with Arabs and fighting Muslims with Muslims has turned the two
religious denominations' into a major source of conflicts. [Third, it
seriously undermined the nuclear non-proliferation regime and global
security]{.underline}. The Iran nuclear deal was achieved through
difficult, protracted negotiations by six parties. The Trump
administration's withdrawal and re-imposition of sanctions has created
uncertainty for the future of the agreement. If Iran can't receive the
practical benefits it deserves for forsaking nuclear weapons, it may
withdraw from the agreement and restart its nuclear program. [The US
move may open the "Pandora's box" of nuclear proliferation in the Middle
East. Fourth, it amplified risks of conflict between major
countries.]{.underline} The Middle East is the focus of US-Russia
geo-political competition. The US sees Iran and Syria as the only
hostile and alien countries threatening US interests in the Middle East.
The main goal of its regional policy is to suppress them and prompt
regime change in the two countries. Russia, on the other hand, is
offering strong support for both, preventing the US from fulfilling that
goal. Syria is Russia's sole strategic foothold in the Middle East,
which it will do everything to preserve. With the civil war in Syria
reaching its last juncture, the Russia-led Syria-Iran camp will try hard
to liberate the country's entire territory, and the US-led anti-Syria
camp will not back down. [The US' illegal direct military intervention
in Syria will very likely lead to military conflict with
Russia.]{.underline} The Middle East, as a major oil-producing area.
Therefore, maintaining exclusive hegemony in the Middle East is crucial
for US global hegemony, which is also a main foreign policy goal of all
US administrations after the Cold War. The Trump administration's
ultra-strong Middle East policy certainly proceeds from US hegemony, but
it also involves other considerations. Jewish corporate interests wield
significant influence on American politics, economy, and media, Trump
believes the stronger, more pro-Israel, and tougher he appears against
Russia in the Middle East, the stronger America will look, and the more
easily he will win the hearts of American populists and Jews. This will
him get rid of the "Russia interference" issue, help the Republican
Party win in the mid-term elections, and help him win a second term.
[Trump assumes his extremely tough Middle East policy is the best way to
demonstrate his commitment to "America First", and is in the US'
interests,]{.underline} but he is actually wrong. [His irrational
actions have done severe harm to the interests of all
stakeholders]{.underline}, and the US has ended up being the foremost
victim. Since US withdrawal from the Iran nuclear deal has invited
unanimous opposition from the international community, especially the
other five signatory countries, the US threat to punish any country that
does business with Iran and suffocate the Iranian economy will not
succeed. On the contrary, the US' image and credibility have suffered a
great blow. [The US finds itself in such unprecedented isolation that
some international media have branded it an "international Pariah". The
US withdrawal from the deal may also worsen nuclear proliferation,
posing a challenge to its own security. By suppressing Palestine and
supporting Israel, the US has led to the discontinuation of the peace
process, prolonged and acerbated the suffering of the Palestinians,
which will inevitably sow seeds of hostility against the US in
Palestinians and Arab Muslims, and international terrorism against the
US may stage a comeback. Trump's reckless moves, which he believes are
smart, may end up hurting the US itself. It is thus hoped that the US
government will learn from its past failures and wake up from its
obsession with hegemony.]{.underline}
