#### The 1ac is backed by a Christological imagination that itself forms the backbone of American political belief. The goal of the Aff is not justice, nor peace, but the restored righteousness and moral standing of the US. With the 1ac we are dealing not with questions of political theory, but of political theology. The US must be understood as a theological project from the constitution and its laws, to the Lincolnian democratic promise, to the 1ac's rehabilitation of the US' aura of sacricity

**[The political and legal phenomena we confront here are elements of
American exceptionalism.]{.underline}** This can hardly find its ground
in justice, when the whole point is to reject a neutral point of view.
[The claim that rules that apply to the rest of the world do not apply
to the United States is not a conclusion we can reach behind the
Rawlsian veil of ignorance]{.underline}. It is not a claim to which
others can or should be sympathetic. Lack of sympathy is one thing;
failure to understand is another. [American exceptionalism, many think,
is simply the expression of self-interest by an imperial
power.]{.underline} Others respond that it is really not in American
self-interest at all. Whether or not it is, focusing on self-interest
will not take us to the heart of the matter. **[American exceptionalism
predates the U.S.'s new and likely short-lived status as a
hyper-power.]{.underline}** If neither justice nor interest explain
American exceptionalism, what does? **[America is not just a political
project; it is a political-theological project.]{.underline}** [That
religion is an important aspect of American life is hardly a startling
proposition.]{.underline} [**America begins with communities of
Christian exiles. It is not an accident that the American Revolution was
framed by the first and second Great Awakenings. Christian movements
were prime movers in 19th and early 20th century politics -- from
abolition, to prohibition. It was long a commonplace to describe America
as a "Christian nation." No other country in the West so easily accepts
the deep penetration of religious faith into its political rhetoric. "In
God, we trust."** Population surveys of American church attendance and
religious beliefs always astound the modern cosmopolitan.]{.underline}
Still, [these **numbers and these expressions of faith lead us in the
wrong direction, if we react by thinking that Christian influence is
simply that of a particularly powerful interest group.** There may be
such influence, but to focus on it is to misunderstand the point of a
political-theological inquiry into American exceptionalism. That point
has little to do with the large number of Americans who happen to be
Christians, but rather with the way in which "**the Christian
imagination" provides the deep structure of American political
belief.**]{.underline} If the purpose of American governance were simply
to solve coordination problems among individuals, then justice would be
the appropriate measure of political life. However, [Americans do not
believe in America because it is a means to some other
good.]{.underline} **[It is itself a source of meaning that can displace
all others.]{.underline}** Indeed, [Americans may have a poorly
developed social-welfare state because to them politics is first of all
a project of transcendent meaning**. If the object of our inquiry is not
justice but meaning, then the form of inquiry must shift from political
theory to political theology.** Modern political theory begins with the
idea of contract -- the social contract]{.underline}. [**The American
political imagination begins with sacrifice. The community arises out of
and is sustained by sacrifice**. The most famous line of political
rhetoric of the latter half of the 20th century was Kennedy's "ask not
what your country can do for you, but what you can do for your
country."]{.underline} He asked this of his "new generation" of
Americans -- a generation that had already fought two wars and was deep
into the Cold War with its reciprocal threats of mutual assured
destruction[. One hundred years earlier, Lincoln set out the same
proposition to his generation. The Gettysburg Address, the ground norm
of all American political rhetoric, invokes the theme of national
resurrection through citizen sacrifice]{.underline}: that "from these
honored dead ... this nation, under God, shall have a new birth of
freedom." Lincoln speaks to the same sacrificial theme expressed in the
conclusion of the Declaration of Independence with its "mutual pledge"
of lives, fortune, and honor. Already as a young man, [**Lincoln had
identified the unique character of the American political-theological
project, when he called for a "reverence for the Constitution and laws"
to step into the fading place of the scarred body of the revolutionary
soldier who literally carried the stigmata of his faith. Lincoln himself
becomes the iconic figure of sacrifice, linking law to death.** This
appeal to sacrifice is not just anachronistic political
rhetoric.]{.underline} Rather, **[it remains the framing narrative of
American political identity.]{.underline}** [When the World Trade Towers
are attacked on 9/11, the thousands of deaths are not seen as victims of
a mass murder. Rather, their deaths are the latest iteration of the
relationship that every citizen bears to the popular sovereign. **That
sovereign can always demand a life; citizenship is never free of the
possible test of faith.**]{.underline} [Sacred violence, not individual
well-being, bears the meaning of this state.]{.underline} [Americans
hear, and want to hear, the rhetoric of ultimate sacrifice: "from these
honored dead ... this nation, under God, shall have a new birth of
freedom."]{.underline} **[Still today, under this vision of national
rebirth, terrible violence is accomplished. This time, the violence is
directed outward, but why not, for America brings the "good news" that
through sacrifice comes freedom. A nation founded in sacrifice is one
that is willing to kill.]{.underline}** Indeed, this is a familiar
paradox[: for the sake of love, we are willing to destroy]{.underline}.
[If we ask how the political-theological project differs from the
theological, I would locate the difference exactly here:]{.underline}
both locate meaning in sacrifice, but **[the locus of political
sacrifice is always the reciprocal violence of killing and being killed.
The willingness to die creates the license to kill -- a principle
formalized in the combatant's privilege in humanitarian
law.]{.underline}** The Christian idea of sacrifice without threatening
violence in return represents the end of the political. Political
killing establishes borders; Christian sacrifice grounds a borderless
church. [America cannot conceive of itself as a colonizing power, for it
understands its power as the consequence of its willingness to
sacrifice. The United States has been at war or preparing for war for
more than half of its existence, including virtually all of the last 100
years.]{.underline} **[For half of that time, the threat of nuclear
annihilation of everyone and everything has been a constant. Americans
have lived their ordinary lives in the shadow of the demand for
universal sacrifice. Political identity could always displace every
other conception of the self, and the political can always become a
matter of life and death.]{.underline}** [Even when we criticize the
latest war in Iraq -- misguided as it may have been -- we hear again the
theme that at least part of the failure was in the Administration's
failure to ask for sacrifice from all.]{.underline} Regardless of the
demographics of who actually joins the military, [today's war on terror
is imagined within this framework of political sacrifice. **The new
battlefield is imagined as literally anywhere, and thus everywhere. The
result is that anyone can be called upon to sacrifice and to
kill.**]{.underline} [The paradigmatic moment in this new national
endeavor of sacrifice for national rebirth is not so much the
destruction of the World Trade Towers, but United Flight 93, brought
down by its own passengers in a sacrificial act of killing and being
killed**. In this new era, every citizen can be conscripted at every
moment. Conscription has moved beyond the capacity of law to regulate.
Instead, conscription now characterizes a post-legal condition of
political sacrifice.**]{.underline} This sacrificial tradition is often
seen through the lens of republican political theory: citizen soldiers
displaying the military virtues of honor and courage in the pursuit of
civic fame. This line of thought gives us [the well worn battle between
liberalism and republicanism in accounts of American exceptionalism.
Neither gets to the heart of the matter.]{.underline} **[Closer to the
mark is Carl Schmitt's concept of the exception.]{.underline}** However,
[in America the exception is inflected through an idea of the popular
sovereign. At that point, the exception becomes the exceptional, as in
American exceptionalism.]{.underline} [**At stake in the politics of
sacrifice is participation in the mystical corpus that is the popular
sovereign: a giving up the self and a living in and through the
transcendent being that is the popular sovereign.** Popular sovereignty
in the United States is distinctly not a conception of self-government
through elections that express the majority will as it emerges from
constantly shifting coalitions]{.underline}. Political theory may give
us such a process view of popular-sovereignty, but to pursue this path
is like thinking that we can understand religious faith by examining
church attendance statistics. [The popular sovereign is a
trans-temporal, omnipresent, and omniscient plural subject. It is
invisible to those outside of its presence just as other forms of the
sacred are invisible to those outside of the faith**. It is the reified
object of an experience of faith sustained through the imagination of
sacrifice. This is the national narrative, endlessly repeated in film,
books, and political rhetoric.**]{.underline} As with any appearance of
the sacred, there is a convergence of the is and the ought. **[America
is always striving to be that which it already is -- to live up to its
own ultimate meaning as the expression of the popular
sovereign.]{.underline}** [The history of the nation is the double
narrative of sacred presence and falling away -- a political life of
salvation and sin. **This is the political-theological meaning of
judicial review, which asks whether some product of the ordinary
political process is a showing forth of the truth of the popular
sovereign. Or, is it only a false appearance? The Court's role is to
recall Americans to the moment of rupture that was the nation's own
self-creation.**]{.underline} Whenever the popular sovereign appears, it
is miraculous. It exists outside of the ordinary course and concerns of
everyday life. Accordingly, its appearance is always marked by violence,
for the character of the infinite is to displace the finite. Order
returns only as the nation takes up the burden of interpreting the
remnants of sovereign presence that have been left behind. Those
remnants are the higher law of American political life. [The rule of law
in American life is a constitutionalism founded in an originary act of
violence -- the mystical presence -- of the popular
sovereign.]{.underline} Realization of the American popular sovereign
takes two forms: sacrifice and representation, or violence and law. In
sacrifice, the sovereign is experienced as unmediated presence; in law,
that presence is mediated through symbol and ritual. The relationship
here is of identity to representation. Both are necessary elements of
the political imaginary: revolution must be followed by constitution;
constitution must be grounded in revolution. Citizens are to see through
the representations of law to the popular sovereign whose law it is.
Without that, law might be just, but it would not be ours. Mediating
between identity and representation is interpretation. Here, we find the
origin of the form and intensity of American legal debates, which look
so irrational to outsiders -- irrational, because they are not really
about justice. Rather, they are about the possibility of realizing a
free and meaningful self through law. In speaking of political
sacrifice, I am not appealing to metaphor. [Sacrifice]{.underline} is a
giving up of a finite set of concerns -- located immediately in the
well-being of the body -- through the act of making present a
transcendent value. This normative experience of surplusage, which
destroys the finite by making present the infinite, is [constitutive of
the national community. This is the lived meaning of the state as a
political-theological project in which national existence is not just
one end among others.]{.underline} Rather, [it is that for which
everything else can be destroyed, and that which has a claim upon
everything else. **The American nation wants only to be itself without
end. It is, for example, not a step on the path to a cosmopolitan
order.**]{.underline} Successive immigrant groups have taken ownership
of the national narrative by taking up this project of self-sacrifice.
In this way, they too become a part of the popular sovereign.
Historically, citizenship in the United States has depended upon a
perceived capacity to bear the material presence of the popular
sovereign. Conversely, any group that, like blacks or Chinese, was
perceived as unable to bear that burden has never been welcomed. This is
not a calculation of justice, but neither does it mean that Americans'
capacity to perceive sameness is somehow frozen independently of their
understanding of justice. Americans want their law to be just; they want
it to be just precisely because it is their law. The sacrificial
character of American political experience is largely invisible to
outsiders. The connection of sacrifice to popular sovereignty frames the
internal imagination, not the external perception of power. That someone
is sacrificing himself in the act of threatening violence does not
change the appearance of the act to the victim. Internally, however, the
popular sovereign exists only as long as, and just so far as, citizens
experience the truth of the self through the act of sacrifice. If they
come to view sacrifice as a demand to be measured by any metric outside
of itself -- whether of future benefits or of justice -- then popular
sovereignty as a conception of the sacred will have ceased. [We may
still vote, but the nation has become a means to ends that voters bring
to the political process from outside -- perhaps commercial, perhaps
familial, perhaps charitable and global.]{.underline} At that point, the
political theological project no longer makes any sense. **[Were the
sovereign to show itself only in the form of sacrifice]{.underline}**,
then the nation would be in [**that eschatological moment that passes
from theological speculation to the actual threat of a thermonuclear
exchange**. We should not forget this possibility at the border of the
American political imagination.]{.underline} Yet, most of the time,
access to the popular sovereign is mediated through the rituals and
representations of law. The starting point for understanding the
American rule of law is the idea that the [law gains its authority not
from the justice of its demands, but from the will of the
sovereign]{.underline}. This is an old idea in jurisprudence, but it is
experienced as a literal truth in America: the authority of the judge
derives directly from his or her claim to articulate the meaning of
texts that are themselves "remnants" of popular sovereignty. Judges do
not rule us by a claim to legal expertise. Instead, they model for us an
idea of sacrificial citizenship: they give themselves up to the law.
This is the meaning of that peculiar rite of passage that is the
confirmation hearing: at the end of this process, the justice is reborn,
emptied of all but the constitution. There has recently been a striking
convergence among Western countries with respect to jurisprudential
methodology. Courts work from a specified list of human rights -- those
rights necessary for a free and democratic order -- put forth in
numerous, overlapping conventions. The judge's work is to continue the
deliberative process of reason: he or she considers how best to
actualize the right in a particular context in which other interests,
and other rights, must be given their due. This methodology is called
"proportionality review" or "balancing." It is thought to have the
objectivity of scientific inquiry. Thus, there is nothing disturbing
about looking to foreign courts for guidance or locating decisions in
transnational courts. Reason knows no boundaries of place or time.
Judges are experts and rights are the domain of their expertise.
American constitutionalism simply does not fit this global pattern. Not
because the content of the American law of rights -- "civil rights" --
is substantially different from that of international human rights.
Indeed, one paradox of American exceptionalism arises out of this
substantive convergence: if so little is at stake substantively, why is
this pattern of judicial reasoning such an emotionally charged issue in
American politics? Indeed, this pattern is not seen as a model of law at
all, but of judicial illegitimacy in three dimensions. First, the rule
of law is not the product of scientific expertise. Second, judges enjoy
no deference as experts, for there is no such thing as "political
expertise" and American law must always be held accountable to American
politics. Third, if there is neither legal science nor political
expertise, then a claim to be applying reason is either an assertion of
false consciousness or an act of bad faith. What is it that American
judges do, if they are not applying reason to discern the progressive
path of rights in particular contexts? They are interpreting a text.
Their authority comes not from the application of universal reason, and
certainly not from the appeal to an "all things considered" judgment of
reasonableness. All American debates over legal rights are
hermeneutical: judges and lawyers argue over the appropriate
interpretive attitude to bring to that text. To the uninitiated,
American textualism looks very odd. Why, they ask, do Americans care so
deeply about a text produced over 200 years ago by an unrepresentative
group of privileged white males? To be bound by such a text denies the
premise of liberal political theory, which understands political order
as a continuous project of reform under the guidance of reason, in
pursuit of individual well-being. Where is the possibility of progress
in a legal culture that fetishizes an archaic text? My description
already suggests an answer. To speak of the hermeneutics of an archaic
text is to look in exactly the right direction. The authority of the
American constitutional text comes neither from a claim of democratic
legitimacy, nor from a claim of justice. The Founding Fathers did not
belong to a golden age of scientific insight. They were slave holders --
failing on the moral front -- and they were wealthy, white males --
failing on the political representation front. None of this matters,
because the text they produced is not a text that they authored. Rather,
the authority of the constitutional text derives from its appearance as
an act of popular sovereignty. This text is the remnant, the evidence,
of sovereign presence. [**The judicial role has to be seen as a form of
ritual: to bring ordinary life into contact with the remnants of sacred
presence**. The privilege of judging comes from the belief that the
source of public meaning in American life comes from that
relationship.]{.underline} Thus, there is no aspect of life to which
Americans cannot address the question "Is it constitutional?" They do so
all the time. They are bound by what judges say because through their
voice Americans are to hear again the voice of the now withdrawn popular
sovereign. [If they fail to hear that voice, they will not understand
why they should listen at all.]{.underline} American legal theorists are
constantly trying to explain how the counter-majoritarian project of
judicial review can be legitimate in a democratic system. But this
question fails to recognize the structure of the American political
imagination. Of American constitutionalism we can say with Saint Anselm
"I believe in order to understand." The Constitution binds because it is
the product of the popular sovereign. It continues to bind as long as
faith in the popular sovereign survives. Many **[Americans continue to
live in a sacred space]{.underline}** in which the infinite announces
its presence by the displacement of the finite; **[in which the
legitimacy of law is rooted in ritual; and in which the outside world is
seen simultaneously as threat and mission. We oscillate between
missionary zeal and isolationism.]{.underline}** Americans cannot
exactly export their law because it is quite literally theirs. But
[Americans]{.underline} cannot believe that other states do not have an
equal capacity for an authentic act of self-creation through popular
sovereignty. They [cannot help but believe that others want to be like
them.]{.underline} Of course, I have drawn my distinctions sharply in
order to emphasize the different world views at stake and to try to
pierce some of the misapprehensions of American political practice. The
argument may sound like mere apologetics for a political culture that is
today driven by the twin sources of Hollywood -- standing for unending
individual consumption -- and the military industrial complex --
standing for a rapacious foreign policy. No one can deny the presence of
these forces, anymore than one could deny that people of religious faith
also pursue their desires and interests. Religion is as much about doubt
and sin, as faith and virtue. Similarly, the political-theological
argument should not be seen as a rejection of the claims of science and
reason more generally. We are not a nation of creationists, fighting
against the insights of modern science. We don't reject reason, but
neither can we say that science has convinced us that religious faith is
simply false belief. The same is true of political belief and practice:
the insights of political theory have to find a place alongside the
faith in popular sovereignty. Neither in science nor in interest,
however, will we find the fundamental structure of the American
political imagination. **[A contemporary political
theology]{.underline}** [makes no metaphysical claims about the nature
of the sacred.]{.underline} **[Its object of study is the imagination
and the world of meaning created and sustained by our collective
imaginary. The United States is a political theological project in which
the critical terms are popular sovereignty as mystical corpus, sacrifice
as the act of self-transcendence, and law as representation of the
absent sovereign.]{.underline}** This account would be entirely
incomplete without making the obvious point that I am describing a
community of love. Such a community has an acute sense of its
boundaries, both spatial and temporal. [America is a constant test to
itself: will it fail in the faith that sustains the
community?]{.underline} That test today comes not just from the
attractions of consumption and the sins of power, but equally from the
rise of a global demand for justice. Reason no less than interest poses
a threat to love. American exceptionalism is the exceptionalism
constitutive of every community of love. I cannot tell anyone whether
they should abandon justice for love or love for justice. This is what
it means to say that values are incommensurable. All that can be said is
that love, like every form of faith, is tenuous. When faith fails, we
find that which we did for love seems to us now to be only injustice.
Exactly this makes the state so dangerous: what seemed to be sacrifice
can suddenly appear to be murder. Yet, justice without love is not
likely to strike many people as adequate, for we seek meanings that
promise to transcend, not just to order, our finite lives.

#### The reduction of sales in arms is not a drawdown of imperial power, but historically part of a religious process of sanctifying a certain type of violence. The 1ac is part of a larger power game that demonizes certain types of weapons to establish the ethicality and humane status of new forms of genteel colonialism and just warfare

**Cooper 11.** Neil Cooper is a Professor of International Relations and
Security Studies & Head of Peace Studies and International Development
at the University of Bradford. "Humanitarian Arms Control and Processes
of Securitization: Moving Weapons along the Security Continuum."

My concern then, in the remainder of this article, is not so much to
interrogate the success or failure of particular humanitarian arms
control initiatives in terms of their ability to produce empirical
reductions in the availability and use of the particular weapons
categories targeted for control. Rather, it is to question the novelty
of the weapons taboos established by the HAC agenda, to examine the
factors that facilitate their production, and to interrogate the
assumption that taboos and even formal restraints on particular
categories of conventional weapons are unambiguously benevolent
developments. Instead, I will suggest that the [current regime of truth
constructed around humanitarian arms control is not only extraordinarily
ahistorical but is one that depends on a rather partial understanding of
the way the relationship between power, ethics, and specific models of
economy have been expressed throughout the history of arms trade
regulation]{.underline}. This ahistoricism is perhaps most obviously
highlighted by the fact that, in contrast to the many claims about the
novelty of the post-Cold War HAC agenda, there is in fact a [long record
of initiatives aimed at eliminating certain pariah weapons or
restricting their use in particular contexts. Examples include (but are
certainly not limited to) the attempts to impose bans or limits on the
use of poison, Greek fire, the crossbow, the gun in 17th and 18th
century Japan, dum-dum bullets, and the submarine.]{.underline}38 The
precise mix of motivations driving these attempts and the record of
success has varied according to each particular case. For example,
restrictions on the submarine failed to survive the exigencies of total
war in World War II39 whilst restrictions on the gun in 17th and 18th
century Japan resulted in its almost total disappearance from society,
despite the fact that it had originally been quite widespread.40
However, notwithstanding the different mix of motivations and different
levels of success, they do illustrate the fact that [the attempt to
control certain pariah weapons appears with sufficient frequency in
history to suggest that the construction of specific types of military
technology as particularly odious and therefore deserving of
extraordinary measures of control is a quite normal practice in the
history of arms regulation.]{.underline} Moreover, [**the justification
of such measures by appeals to some kind of principled discourse is not
unusual.** The prohibition on the use of crossbows issued by the Second
Lateran Council of 1139 was not only **underpinned by the Church and
reinforced by religious sanction (the penalty of anathema), but was
represented as a restriction** imposed on 'that deadly and God-detested
art of slingers and archers']{.underline}.41 Although arguably driven by
more realpolitik security considerations, both [American and British
officials justified restrictions on submarine warfare in the inter-war
period as a response to an **inhumane** weapon]{.underline}.42
Similarly, the 1890 [Brussels Act (principally an anti-slavery
initiative) not only included restrictions on firearms aimed at
preventing the slave trade and limiting their 'pernicious and
preponderating part' in 'internal wars between the native
tribes']{.underline}43 [but was agreed against the backdrop of a
pan-European civil society campaign rooted in **ethical concerns** for
the colonized that included concern about the effects of the weapons
trade on natives]{.underline}. Indeed, at one point some 120 memorials
from Britain, France, and Switzerland were read out at the Brussels
Conference where the Brussels Act was negotiated.44 The eventual outcome
was an agreement to restrict the import of firearms (particularly
sophisticated weapons) as well as powder and ammunition into an area
extending from the middle of the Sahara to present day Namibia and
Zimbabwe. [However, whilst specific examples of **pariah weapons
regulation may well have been grounded in an ethical discourse** and
sometimes also underpinned by vocal support from campaigning groups
concerned with the welfare of the human, this **tells us little about
the broader system of arms trade regulation they were located in.** For
example, the passage of the Brussels Act occurred in an era that 'saw
the fewest restraints and regulations on the arms trade in modern
history]{.underline}'45 and the general attitude of the times was
reflected in the assertion in the 1895 edition of Arms and Explosives
that 'we cannot look\... on the trade in munitions of war as being
specifically removed from the general condition of ordinary trading'.46
Thus, apparently ethical action on particular categories of arms can
take place even in the context of broader systems of arms regulation
that are actually highly permissive. The question this raises then is
what creates the conditions for ethical appeals for arms restraint to
gain traction even in such circumstances, and how can we understand
their relationship to the global system of arms regulation? Four factors
are crucial: the relationship between arms regulation and the narrow
political and material interests of powerful actors; the relationship
between pariah weapons and legitimized military technology; the
relationship between economic philosophy and the approach to arms
regulation; and the relationship between the global system of arms trade
regulation and the dominant framing of threats in particular eras. Only
by examining the interplay of these factors can we properly reflect on
the contemporary role played by global civil society campaigns on the
conventional arms trade and consider their effects on broader efforts to
promote peace -- both globally and in the aftermath of local conflicts.

To the extent that [power is discussed at all in contemporary accounts
of post-Cold War humanitarian arms control, it tends to be incorporated
into campaigning narratives in which the power of global civil society
acting on behalf of the powerless is pitted against the
powerfu]{.underline}l, principally in the form of a large number of
reluctant states. The only exception to this is the emphasis placed in
some analyses on the interests of key middle-ranking states such as
Canada or Norway in using campaigns on landmines or small arms as a
vehicle to maintain their diplomatic status in international fora such
as the UN. In this account of contemporary HAC, [powerful actors who aim
to uphold the status quo principally have a role as agents of resistance
to control agendas, not as actors in the production of control
regimes]{.underline}. This certainly reflects important aspects of
contemporary campaigns to regulate pariah weapons but, as I suggest
below, it offers a rather incomplete account. Moreover, if such accounts
did indeed provide a complete understanding of the dynamics underpinning
these control agendas it would certainly represent a novel development,
not least because the long history of pariah weapons regulation
illustrates the way that **[weapons taboos frequently reflect the
interests of the powerful]{.underline}**. For example, one factor in
[the virtual eradication of the gun in 17th and 18th century Japan was
that it represented a threat to the warrior class when in the hands of
the lower classes]{.underline}.48 The same was true of the rather less
successful attempt of the Second Lateran Council to **[ban the crossbow
-- a ban partly motivated by the fact that crossbows could pierce the
armour of the knight -- and a ban that was notably not extended to use
against non-Christians.]{.underline}**49 Similarly, [whilst the
restrictions on the slave, arms, and liquor trade to Africa]{.underline}
embodied in the 1890 Brussels Act [were certainly grounded in an ethical
discourse, the restrictions imposed on the trade in firearms were
primarily rooted in concerns about the impact of the trade on colonial
order]{.underline}. As one British colonial official noted at the time,
the restrictions on the small arms trade to Africa reflected [imperial
concern to 'avoid the development and pacification of this great
continent \... \[being\] carried out in the face of an enormous
population, the majority of whom will probably be armed with first-class
breechloading rifles]{.underline}'.50 The history of pariah weapons
regulation would therefore appear to demonstrate a [persistent link
between the material and political interests of states and / or powerful
elites and the emergence of pariah weapons regulation]{.underline}. To
be sure, the material and political interests of the same, or other,
powerful actors also provide countervailing pressures -- the immediate
interests of nobles in winnings wars with crossbows mostly won out over
their broader class interests,51 whilst colonial competition to secure
arms profits and local allies mitigated the impact of the various
restrictions on the firearms trade in the late 19th century.52 But the
point is that whilst the genesis of earlier attempts at pariah
regulation may, in part, be explained by reference to particular
securitizing moments of intervention, the impact of such interventions
can only be understood by locating them in particular political
economies of power. What is surprising therefore about accounts of
post-Cold War humanitarian arms control is that this long history has
largely failed to prompt consideration of the way in which contemporary
regulation might also reflect the interests of powerful states and other
actors, albeit in ways that are subject to similar countervailing
pressures -- an issue that will be taken up below. A further recurring
theme in the history of pariah regulation is the way in which
[restrictions on pariah weapons are often related in some way to the
construction of a broad arena of legitimized military
technology]{.underline}. A particularly extreme example of this is the
way in which [**pariah weapons are sometimes constructed as the
antithesis of the 'heroic weapon'** -- a weapon deemed to embody
positive values such as honour and / or which is deemed central to
national defence]{.underline}. Thus, the series of relatively successful
Acts implemented in England between 1508 and 1542 [banning crossbows
were largely rooted in a concern to preserve the use of the heroic
longbow]{.underline}, deemed central to a long line of English military
successes.53 The [Japanese ban on the gun was similarly connected to the
romanticization of the heroic samurai sword as the visible form of one's
honour, as associated with grace of movement in battle and even its
status as a work of art]{.underline}.54 [In effect both the crossbow in
16th century England and the gun in 17th and 18th century Japan became
the 'other' which defined legitimized military technologies and
militarism]{.underline}. Redford makes much the same point about English
attitudes to [the submarine, which was constructed as an 'other' partly
because of the British romanticization of the battleship]{.underline}
('the upper class or [aristocracy of warships']{.underline})55 as
central to British security and [linked to British notions of valour and
honour]{.underline} in the conduct of war. This highlights the ways in
which the security meaning associated with particular sets of weapons
technology are not just a function of the framings specific to that
technology but are also relational, with the [representation of one
weapon playing an important role in constituting the meaning of
another]{.underline} (albeit in sometimes unexpected ways), and vice
versa. Not surprisingly perhaps, [similar themes also help explain the
contemporary taboos constructed around particular sets of military
technology such as cluster munitions.]{.underline} What is particularly
striking about the campaign against cluster munitions is not its success
in banning an inhumane weapon but the fact that this [success was
achieved at a moment in history when]{.underline}, in absolute terms at
least, [cluster munitions use had fallen from the peak years of
use]{.underline} during the Vietnam era (see Table 2). In the latter
period cluster bombs such as the CBU-24 represented a 'major increase in
battlefield lethality' yet its development and deployment was
'accomplished with no public debate and relatively little subsequent
protest'.56 Indeed, for the American military, 'CBUs were categorised as
a standard weapon, to be taken off the shelf -- "conventional
ironmongery".57 This is not to suggest that American use of cluster
munitions in this period went unremarked. There were certainly some
critics at the time who argued that such weapons were inhumane.58 There
were also attempts, sponsored by the International Committee of the Red
Cross (ICRC) and Sweden in particular, to promote restrictions on
cluster munitions in negotiations in the 1970s on the Additional
Protocols to the 1949 Geneva Conventions.59 The point is however, that
these efforts never achieved traction either with diplomats or with a
wider public in the way that the issue would 30 years later. The labels
attached to cluster munitions and also landmines only changed
dramatically as the move into the post-Cold War era occurred when they
**[moved from being treated as unproblematic elements in global military
arsenals to a form of 'technology non grata' -- weaponry deemed immoral,
inhumane, and indiscriminate.]{.underline}** Crucially, such a
successful process of [stigmatization was only made feasible in the
context of a post-Cold War widening of the security label to incorporate
the notion of human security as a referent object; by the turn to
casting security interventions in humanitarian terms; and the
representation of modern weaponry as humane because of its perceived
capacity to better discriminate between civilians and
combatants]{.underline}. The widening and deepening of the security
label created the permissive environment necessary for activists to
reframe cluster munitions (and APMs) as threats to the human. At the
same time, the discussion of intervention in humanitarian terms60 and of
precision weapons as instruments of humane warfare61 created a
legitimized discursive space into which campaigners could insert a
re-representation of landmines and cluster munitions technology as
inhumane. Indeed, such a re-representation only exerted a powerful
appeal because it was consonant with both the predominant framing of
security threats in a postCold War world and a new divide between good
and odious military technology. This is not to suggest that such
developments reflected some teleology in which security and arms control
practice progressively evolved to be more humane. As Krause and Latham
have noted, for example, whilst the post-Cold War era concern with the
impact of 'inhumane weapons' represents a notable shift compared with
the Cold War arms control agenda, it does have similarities with the
late 19th century when a Western discourse of civilized warfare was also
prominent. One corollary of this -- then as now -- was a concern to
specify what constituted an 'inhumane weapon'62 manifest, for example,
in the negotiations in the Hague conferences over problem technologies
such as the dum dum bullet. As Michael Howard has suggested though,
whilst [initiatives such as the Hague conferences]{.underline} achieved
notable successes, they also [reflected the fact that **liberal
internationalists had 'abandoned their original objects of preventing
war and building peace in favour of making war more humane for those
actually fighting it**']{.underline}.63 The prohibitions on cluster
munitions and also APMs can be understood as similarly ambiguous
developments. On the one hand, the [legitimizing discourse of Western
militaries and arms firms was turned against them in order to generate
powerful taboos against particular categories of weapons -- even in the
face of opposition from these militaries. **The language of state
security was coopted to promote human security, to preserve life, and
prevent threats to its existence. On the other hand, the same
prohibitions can ultimately be understood less as progressive
initiatives imposed on foot-dragging states by the bottom-up power of
global civil society and more as performative acts that simultaneously
function to codify aspects of a new set of criteria for judging
international respectability in a post-Cold War era, to reinforce the
security framings of the era and to legitimize those categories of
weapons successfully constructed as precise, discriminate, and thus
humane.** Indeed, to the extent that states such as the United States
have been able to circumscribe their commitments on landmines etc.
**they have been able to benefit from the broader legitimizing effects
of specific weapons taboos without being unduly constrained by the
specific regulatory requirements they have given rise to.**]{.underline}
Moreover, as already noted, [the presence of pariah weapons regulation
is not necessarily a sign of a more general shift to the tighter
regulation of the arms trade -- quite the reverse in some
cases.]{.underline} Thus, any evaluation of the overall impact of such
regulation on global and local security also has to take into account
the broader system of arms regulation in which it is located, and the
relationship that exists between pariah regulation and this broader
system. The next two sections will offer some observations on these
issues.

#### Voting aff sacralizes the American imperial project justifying exceptional measures and licensing an overall strategy of innoncent domination

**Pahl 15.** Jon the Peter Paul and Elizabeth Hagan Professor of History
and Director of MA Programs in The Lutheran Theological Seminary at
Philadelphia. "Empire of Sacrifice: Violence and the Sacred in American
Culture." In Can We Survive Our Origins?: Readings in René Girard\'s
Theory of Violence and the Sacred (Studies in Violence, Mimesis, &
Culture)

[American self-understanding has been brutally efficient in producing
"innocent domination"]{.underline} (Pahl 2012b). [Throughout American
history, **deathdealing**, pursued as a matter of public policy, **has
been cloaked repeatedly in a sacralizing aura of rhetorical innocence.**
According to this "exceptionalist" narrative]{.underline}, usually
asserted in direct contrast to the evidence, [killing is an unfortunate
accident, "collateral damage" in the otherwise noble history of American
progress]{.underline}. **[American domination]{.underline}**, even and
**[especially where violently pursued, is innocent]{.underline}**.
Usually, this [killing is dressed up as "sacrifice," i.e., as heroic and
costly self-dedication to an ideal]{.underline} or value (Denton-Borhaug
2011). The trope is remarkably mobile---and exceptionally slippery in
the semantic ambiguities it generates. [The "sacrifice" of
others]{.underline} (and [of American "boys"]{.underline})---implying
their bloody immolation (i.e., sacrifi ce in its archaic and original
sense)---[has been invoked as necessary across the
centuries]{.underline} (Ebel 2010). **[The removal of Native Americans,
the enslavement of Africans, the conquest of the Spanish in the South of
North America, the revolution against the English]{.underline}** across
the 72 Jon Pahl and James Wellman Atlantic seacoast, and **[the pushback
of the French to what became Canada were all justified,]{.underline}**
already in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, **[by rhetorics of
"sacrifice]{.underline}**" ( Jewett 2008). In the nineteenth century,
[the Civil War was described by both sides as a sacrifi cial struggle
"upon the altar of the nation,"]{.underline} as Yale's Harry Stout has
aptly put it (Stout 2006). Most recently, **[the dawn of U.S. empire in
the Philippines, the (belated) entry into World War I, the "good war"
against the Axis Powers in World War II, the "Cold War" against the
Soviet Union and Communist China (via proxies in Korea and Vietnam), and
the military adventures in Iraq (twice) and in Afghanistan were all
shrouded in sacralizing discourses of "sacrifi ce]{.underline}**" (Stout
2006). [American interventions have thus always been presented as
exceptional necessities justifying exceptional measures.]{.underline}
[Such violence, no matter how sadistic, "preemptive," and
domination-driven, has been cloaked as "defensive" action, hence as
innocent.]{.underline} [Domination]{.underline}, so the exceptionalist
narrative goes, [is invariably "good" for the peoples Americans have
invaded and fought.]{.underline} **[Religion]{.underline}** itself
**[has been pressed into service as a key component in an ongoing
rationalization of violence-in-the-name-of-evolutionary-"progress"
(progress being understood in racial, economic, nationalist, and
gendered terms]{.underline}** and marked by potent binaries of "us"
versus "them"). Indeed, **[the production of sacralizing narratives out
of violence tends to institute a civil religion]{.underline}** parallel
and **[rival to Christianity]{.underline}**, operating essentially with
transposed structures of thought and language (mis)appropriated from it.
The thought of René Girard insightfully illuminates this trend in
American history, since for Girard, such phenomena are to be understood
most fundamentally as "regressions" characteristic of Christendom and
its aftermath, to primitive archaic patterns programmed by our
evolutionary history. In his most recent (and probably final) writings,
especially I See Satan Fall Like Lightning; Christianity, Truth, and
Weakening Faith; Evolution and Conversion; and especially Battling to
the End, René Girard has emphasized insistently what he calls his
"realist" approach to anthropology, while also taking a decidedly
theological turn (Girard 2001, 2008, 2010; Girard and Vattimo 2010). For
our purposes, Girard's emphasis, in particular, on the historical
actuality of a "founding murder" at the beginning of human civilization
can point us toward a fully "realist" refusal to blink in the face of
violence, or be deceived by its sacralizing disguises. Girard's
theological turn too can help us Violence and the Sacred in American
Culture 73 to recognize in American history the dynamics of a
paradoxical oscillation, of "apocalyptic" tenor, between a "crescendo
towards extremes" of violence (producing domination) and what Pierpaolo
Antonello has identifi ed as the "containments" of violence (presented
as innocence)---a paradox operating via what Girard calls forms of
"false transcendence" (Girard 2001, 46, 98--100, 119, 185). Th is
"realist theology," if we may so call it, embodies Girard's most mature
refl ections not only on human nature and Christianity, but also on an
American culture that he called "home" for most of his adult life. It is
true that the **[American empire]{.underline}** (as Hardt and Negri
observed \[2008\]) now **[operates as a global regime of transnational
corporate power]{.underline}** (one is tempted to say banking power).
Yet **[the exchanges and flows (of weapons as well as cash) within this
system are]{.underline}** no less, for being global, part of **[a
"sacrifi cial" economy]{.underline}** than they were when tied to the
nation-state and its policies (as is, in fact, still largely the case).
Even more, **[the capacity of these sacrifi cial processes to produce
victims has escalated,]{.underline}** as Girard observes throughout
Battling to the End---while also being at least [temporarily contained
in]{.underline} modern judicial rituals and systems of [economic
exchange]{.underline}. We have to understand here, however, that **[when
violence is "contained," for Girard, it is also redistributed and
recycled around the body politic.]{.underline}** What Girard helps us to
realize, then, is that the system of false transcendence that marks
American exceptionalism takes two primary forms. First, [the ideological
construct of innocent domination operates through overt, physical
warfare rationalized and sanctifi ed as (noble) "sacrifi ce"---at which
construction Americans have proven themselves to be exceptionally
skilled]{.underline}, not least in recent decades. Secondly, [the "false
transcendence" of superordaining necessity and sacralized innocence is
deployed in various forms of **"cultural warfare**.]{.underline}" Here,
**[the battle is over symbols or "truth" more than actual physical
territory]{.underline}**. In these battles, what is "sacrifi ced" is not
as evident (perhaps) as an actual human victim, but these ossifi cations
of human reasoning that produce both [the ideology of American
exceptionalism]{.underline} and the false transcendence it secretes
[are]{.underline}, in the long run, [no less
destructive]{.underline}---are, indeed, perhaps more dangerous---[than
actual warfare]{.underline}. For ideological rigor mortis is the exact
opposite of devotion to a living God (not to mention devotion to living
human beings and commitment to alleviating their suff ering, insofar as
possible). Such ideological certainty 74 Jon Pahl and James Wellman
(which can have the function of masking a deeper want of assurance)
marks a deep-lying strain in American history from its origins to the
present. Of course, American history is not to be reduced to any single
deconstructionist narrative of anti- or para-Christian American
exceptionalism cloaking domination with innocence through the workings
of a false transcendence. Th ere is also a deep stratum of trust (what
Robert Putnam has identifi ed as "social capital") manifest in
spiritually grounded, pragmatically realistic, nonviolent movements for
social change that give some empirical and cultural "heft " to what Kant
long since identifi ed as the conditions for perpetual peace, and that
might collectively point (ironically enough) to the prospects for a Pax
Americana.1 For the moment, however, we must explore and expand the
fruitfulness of the present exercise in the application of Girardian
theory. To which end, my colleague and I here present a series of four
selected culture-readings, designed to illustrate the logic of sacred
and "sacrifi cial" violence. In Guns We Trust: The Origins of American
Exceptionalism Jon Pahl "**[American" identity,]{.underline}** according
to this reading of the culture-story, **[originated in
murder]{.underline}**. From the very beginning of **[European
settlement,]{.underline}** shifting alliances between indigenous tribal
groupings and English settlers produced competing, and largely
unresolved, charges of murder and injustice. For instance, in 1636 an
English trader named John Oldham was murdered in Massachusetts Bay
Colony. Th e English accused various Native Americans of the crimes. Th
ese accusations were apparently driven less by the facts of the case
than by the benefi ts that accrued to the English from playing on tribal
rivalries that pitted the Mohegans and Narragansetts against the
Pequots. English-speaking clergy preached repeated sermons demanding
that the Pequots punish the murderers of Oldham, and when the Pequots
refused and began carrying out raids on English villages, the English
escalated the confl ict with an attack on the Pequot village in what is
now Mystic, Connecticut, on May 26, 1637. Captain John Mason led a band
of ninety English soldiers, accompanied by several hundred friendly
Violence and the Sacred in American Culture 75 Narragansetts, and
torched the entire village, killing hundreds of Pequots, most of whom
were women, children, and the elderly. Commander of the attack John
Mason explained the religious rationale for the mass murder aft erwards,
claiming that God "laughed his Enemies and the Enemies of his People to
scorn making them as a fi ery Oven. . . . Th us did the Lord judge among
the Heathen, fi lling the Place with dead Bodies!" (Mason 1763, 10). A
few decades later, Nathaniel Morton imagined the scene in vivid terms
for readers, and explicitly justifi ed it as a "sacrifi ce": it "was a
fearful sight to see \[the Pequots\] thus frying in the Fire, and the
streams of Blood quenching the Same; and horrible was the stink and
scent thereof; but the Victory seemed a sweet Sacrifi ce, and they gave
praise thereof to God, who had wrought so wonderfully for them, thus to
enclose their Enemies" (Morton 1669, 101). In the coming years, **[New
England's Puritan settlers actually secured their dominance by promising
free trade with various indigenous peoples in exchange for the severed
heads and hands of murdered Pequots as tributes---thus establishing
early connections between religion, violence, and commercial exchange in
the "New World."]{.underline}** And lest the theological point be
lost---namely, that encouraging the murder and dismembering of an enemy
could be an act of love on the part of Christians committed to
Enlightened moral values like not killing---William Bradford of Plymouth
Plantation opined that "cutting off \[Pequot\] heads and hands, which
the \[Indians\] sent to the English, \[was\] a testimony of their love
and service" (Lipman 2008). In the decades to come, the English came to
specialize in this method of dividing and conquering the fi rst peoples
of North America. Th ey did so by using a murder as a pretext for more
killing, although of course the killing was also legitimized by
inquests, trials, and other legal procedures. Th e case of Sassamon---a
"praying Indian" found dead near Plymouth in January of 1675---is the
best-studied example. As a Christian, Sassamon was an ally of the
English, although he also advised Wampanoag sachem Metacom (King
Philip). Th ree Wampanoags were charged with Sassamon's murder, tried in
English courts, and found guilty and sentenced to death. Metacom
protested, and eventually began organizing raids against English
settlements. Th e confl ict escalated into total war---something Girard
comments on with great insight in Battling to the End. Historian Francis
Jennings has estimated 76 Jon Pahl and James Wellman that six of seven
Native Americans and six of thirteen English in New England died during
the war ( Jennings 1976). King Philip's War, as it came to be called,
ended with the death of Metacom in 1677. Aft er being captured by the
English, he was fi rst tortured, then beheaded. His head was then
displayed on a pole in Plymouth for decades. According to Jill Lepore,
the war---triggered by the murder of Sassamon, and ending with the
murder of Metacom---rigidifi ed cultural distinctions between "Indians"
and "Americans," and established a dualistic pattern for cultural confl
ict that defi ned "American" identity (Lepore 1999). **[Murder, war,
torture, destruction---the "sacrifice" of some to preserve others---
these are the themes with which American history ought rightly to
begin.]{.underline}** Throughout the centuries, of course, **[Native
Americans continued to bear much of the violence]{.underline}** that fl
owed from this us-them dualism **[and its sacrifi cial operations---from
the Sand Creek Massacre of 1864]{.underline}** (led by Colonel \[and
Methodist Reverend\] J. M. Chivington), **[to]{.underline}** the
**[Wounded Kne]{.underline}**e Massacre of 1890, **[to the repression of
the AIM uprising in 1973, to untold murders and crushing poverty down to
the present.2 All]{.underline}** of this was done, of course, **[in the
name of "progress]{.underline}**"; in the name of the "modern" (if not
putatively "Christian") renunciation of "primitive" religion and ritual.
It would not be diffi cult to trace the way **[this initial incident
spiraled into ideological trajectories that take us quite directly to
Iraq and Abu Ghraib]{.underline}**.3 Instead, however, let us, with
Girard's help, draw out the historical and evolutionary signifi cance of
this "founding murder." He writes: Th e modern shedding of ritual brings
to light the psychosocial substratum of ritual phenomena. We cry
"scapegoat" to stigmatize all the phenomena of
discrimination---political, ethnic, religious, social, racial,
etc.---that we observe about us. We are right. We easily see now that
scapegoats multiply wherever human groups seek to lock themselves into a
given identity--- communal, local, national, ideological, racial,
religious, and so on. (Girard 2001, 160) It is the mobility and
pluriform diversity of the religious phenomenon---the construction,
within the gap created by the "secularization" of inherited traditions,
of hybrid civil religions and of self-sacralizing "cultural religions"
or "identities"---that has marked the modern world. Girard again draws
the Violence and the Sacred in American Culture 77 conclusion: "**[All
discourses on exclusion, discrimination, racism, etc. will remain
superfi cial as long as they don't address the religious foundations of
the problems that besiege our society"]{.underline}** (Girard 2001,
210). I have said something of the religious foundations of American
violence in this brief excursion on the founding murder(s) in American
history. For other case studies in the history of innocent domination,
readers are invited to explore my book Empire of Sacrifi ce (2010a),
which discusses in turn: the execution of the Quaker Mary Dyer on Boston
Common in 1660; the sacrifi ces associated with **[slavery in North
America]{.underline}**, as outlined by Frederick Douglass; **[the
ruthlessly mimetic "war on drugs" that is, in eff ect, a war on youth
and adolescents in American policy; and]{.underline}** (fi nally) **[the
exclusion of women, gays, and lesbians from full participation in
American society]{.underline}**, in what I call the "sacrifi ce of sex."
Each of these trajectories off ers an enduring thread, open to a
Girardian reading, throughout American history; and **[each demonstrates
quite real "sacrifi ces" of ritual immolation illustrating America's
ideology of innocent domination,]{.underline}** albeit in forms that are
not immediately and evidently identifi able as religious. Other "sacrifi
cial" trajectories of reading in American history are explored in my
previous book, Shopping Malls and Other Sacred Spaces: Putting God in
Place (2003), which tracks the ways shopping malls, Walt Disney World,
or the suburban home---and especially domestic sanitation and lawn
care---originate **[in a "desire to acquire]{.underline}**" in America,
and **[produce]{.underline}** "sacred places" that reinforce what I call
the "**[violence of banality."]{.underline}** But too many examples are
wearisome. Th e point is the same in any event. **[Mimetic rivalries
operate contagiously in America, through market and social systems that
bear religious signifi cance without appearing to be
religious]{.underline}**. In other words, **[innocent domination stems
from a false transcendence]{.underline}**, the falsity of which is
evidenced by the existence underneath a **[religious rhetoric of
innocence of a brutal, and escalating, system of interrogations,
surveillance, torture, prisons, military expansion, and
weaponry,]{.underline}** the ballistic capacity of which is matched only
by its destructive intent (Bacevich 2010). Unfortunately, the most
troubling and insidious of the forms of innocent domination is the way
in which truth itself suff ers under the fi xed ideology of American
exceptionalism. Th is is the case in the "warfare" between science and
religion in America, which has been concentrated, with special heat, on
the topic of evolution, and which deserves special attention.

#### In the name of a sacralized American identity everything can be destroyed, protecting the American nation is a project without end. Otherness is relegated ready for sacrifice resulting in concentration camps, factory farms, habitat destruction, disease, just war, North Korea and Libyan conflict and much under the umbrella of humane sacrifice

May (2018).

Part of the challenge would appear to lie in the actual language used to
articulate that imagined process. A useful example of distinctive
articulation is provided by Paul W. Kahn (Sacrificial Nation, Utopian,
29 March 2010). He argues with respect to **[the USA,]{.underline}** for
example, that it [**is a political theological project. Popular
sovereignty is the mystical corpus, and sacrifice is the act of
self-transcendence:** In speaking of political sacrifice, I am not
appealing to metaphor. Sacrifice is a giving up of a finite set of
concerns \-- located immediately in the well-being of the body \--
through the act of making present a transcendent value.
**This**]{.underline} normative experience of surplusage, which destroys
the finite by making present the infinite, **[is constitutive of the
national community. This is the lived meaning of the state as a
political-theological project in which national existence is not just
one end among others. Rather, it is that for which everything else can
be destroyed, and that which has a claim upon everything else. The
American nation wants only to be itself without end.]{.underline}** It
is, for example, not a step on the path to a cosmopolitan
order\...[**.** The sacrificial character of American political
experience is largely invisible to outsiders.]{.underline} [The
connection of sacrifice to popular sovereignty frames the internal
imagination, not the external perception of power.]{.underline} That
someone is sacrificing himself in the act of threatening violence does
not change the appearance of the act to the victim. Internally, however,
[the popular sovereign exists only as long as, and just so far as,
citizens experience the truth of the self through the act of
sacrifice.]{.underline} If they come to view sacrifice as a demand to be
measured by any metric outside of itself -- whether of future benefits
or of justice \-- then popular sovereignty as a conception of the sacred
will have ceased. We may still vote, but the nation has become a means
to ends that voters bring to the political process from outside \--
perhaps commercial, perhaps familial, perhaps charitable and global. At
that point, the political theological project no longer makes any sense.
Other such attempts are required. Requisite reframing: \"human\",
\"sacrifice\" and \"religion\"? There is a case for exploring the extent
to which the tragic dilemmas of the times derive from what might be
termed definitional game-playing or conceptual gerrymandering
(Conceptual gerrymandering and definitional game-playing, 2002).
Arguably this is a consequence of the primary characteristic shared by
the Abrahamic religions, namely their monotheistic belief. Through their
acclaimed distinctiveness, this same characteristic readily translates
into the exclusiveness whereby each is right and the others necessarily
wrong. \"Religion\" is therefore singular \-- there can be only one
appropriate belief system. In attempting to deal with complexity,
simplisitic \"mono-factor\" thinking is notably criticized by Edgar
Morin (Pour Sortir du XXe Siecle, 1981). It then follows that \"[human\"
is also singular in a sense, thereby separating the believers from
unbelievers and from otherness in general. **This unfortunately frames a
context in which otherness is essentially irrelevant and can be only too
readily sacrificed, as becomes increasingly evident in the condition of
the world \-- whether living or nonliving**]{.underline}. The Abrahamic
religions have yet to engage effectively with their archetypal struggle
with femininity \-- ironically dating back to their earlier founding
myth in the Garden of Eden. Paradise lost? [**There is a tragic visual
resemblance between the concentration camps of the Holocaust and the
factory farming units now required around the world to feed the growing
population.** Whether chickens, pigs or cows, the living conditions are
strikingly similar. Both call for the same process same management
skills.]{.underline} **[The concentration camps were a prelude to
sacrifice of humans, just as the farming units are a prelude to
sacrifice for humans]{.underline}**. **[Whether understood as \"cannon
fodder\" or otherwise, humans can be readily understood as being \"bred
for sacrifice\" \-- if only to feed the \"economic
machine\".]{.underline}** However [it requires little skill in
definitional game-playing and conceptual gerrymandering to frame such
comparisons as meaningless]{.underline}. Humans are not animals? Animals
are not human? It has been recently announced that **[the planet is in
process of a sixth extinction of species \-- estimated at 100 to 1,000
times higher than the natural background rate]{.underline}** (as noted
above). [**This is a consequence of habitat destruction,
overexploitation, and disease \-- most of which has been enabled by
humans reinforced by Abrahamic religion**. This process is also readily
framed as of little consequence to governance in practice.]{.underline}
Curiously however **[the wilderness areas which have been destroyed
through these processes were also the habitats of indigenous peoples,
often now confined to reservations, if not otherwise marginalized
following various forms of ethnic cleansing.]{.underline}** Victims of
conceptual gerrymandering \-- in that they were held to be without soul?
**[Homo nullius on Terra nullius?]{.underline}** Could it be said that
[Abrahamic religions, through their monotheistic disposition, are
essentially only capable of juggling one ball]{.underline} \-- when
there is a need for each to juggle many more and the potential of
juggling even more between those religions? This argument is avoiding
that of Stephen Prothero (God Is Not One: The Eight Rival Religions That
Run the World \-- and Why Their Differences Matter, 2010) or Sarah Voss
(What Number Is God? Metaphors, Metaphysics, Metamathematics, and the
Nature of Things, 1995). How indeed might the Abrahamic religions
progress from one, past two, to three, and then to eight, or more \-- as
is necessarily implied by the argument from the perspective of cognitive
psychology of George Lakoff and Rafael E. Nunez (Where Mathematics Comes
From: how the embodied mind brings mathematics into being, 2000)? Given
the extensive literature on sacrifice by Abrahamic religions, when have
religions sacrificed themselves as a collectivity \-- as a belief
system? How might such \"sacrifice\" then be understood? Envisaging
collective sacrifice otherwise? Given that great symbolic importance has
been variously associated by the Abrahamic religions with a vessel of
some kind (the Chalice, the Kiddush, or an Islamic divination bowl), a
Zen tale offers one indication: Three disciples of a Zen master were
each asked to explain the nature of a beautiful ancient vase of utmost
value. The first and the second were each absent a year and returned
with complex statements \-- which were rejected. The third immediately
smashed the vase with one blow \-- and thus achieved satori. The tale
was used by the \"organizing group\" of an unusual conference in
dissolving itself and any dependence on a detailed program,
long-prepared with great care (A Congress that Dared the Unthinkable,
Florence, 1978). Could the Abrahamic religions, individually or
together, be understood metaphorically as such a vase? The \"vase\"
might, for example, be usefully imagined in the light of insights into
wave theory \-- as a wave form of belief (Encountering Otherness as a
Waveform \-- in the light of a wave theory of being, 2013). The nature
of such \"belief\" could now be challenged by emerging insights into
quantum consciousness, as separately discussed in the light of the
arguments of Alexander Wendt (Quantum Mind and Social Science: unifying
physical and social ontology, 2015; video; interview) as discussed
separately (On being \"walking wave functions\" in terms of quantum
consciousness? 2017). In the current global civilization, is the
\"globe\", as understood, to be recognized as just such a \"vase\"? The
subtlety of the cognitive challenge is exemplified by the understanding
of orthodox Islam that any image (whether a vase, a model, or a
metaphor) purporting to represent something other than itself is
irreconcilable with its central message. In that sense Islam has already
\"smashed the vase\". However, as exemplified by the challenge of
Sunni-Shia conflict and its relations with Judaism, Islam as a
\"container\" of a kind has yet to \"smash itself\" \-- consistent with
that insight. For the Abrhamic religions in general, what is it that
needs to be collectively sacrificed? In a period when waterboarding has
been brought back into fashion by Christian governments, and given the
early focus on heresy of the Inquisition, how could an Abrahamic
religion now put itself to \"the question\"? The possibility of asking
such a question is indicated by a formal statement by a leading bishop:
It could be argued that the greatest obstacle to preaching the gospel
today in Scotland is the Catholic Church itself. (\'Biggest obstacle to
the Catholic Church is itself\', claims bishop, BBC News, 17 April
2018). Paradox of containment: Are the Abrahamic religions, individually
or collectively, appropriate containers for the mystery they endeavour
to communicate? Rather than being essential questions, do Abrahamic
religions cultivate the role of being answers or answer containers?
Would they be more authentic as questions rather than as answers, as may
be explored with respect to individual identity (Am I Question or
Answer? Problem or (re)solution? 2006) Are they to be thought of as
containers or as the contents \-- or both, or neither? (Containment and
authenticity, 2003; Cognitive containers, 2011; Cognitive significance
of a con-tainer, 2016 ). The latter notes an argument relating to the
fundamental global importance of shipping continers by Alexander Klose
(The Container Principle: how a box changes the way we think, 2009). In
a critical comment Klose notes: Containers represent the impressive
dynamics of modern capitalism and its fundamental optimism in the face
of every crisis. At the same time, they represent the fears and
objections to these dynamics when logistic are organized purely for
optimization, forcibly converging and aligning formerly remote parts of
the world through an exponential increase in transport and
communications processes. The basic materiality of containers, the fact
that they can be emptied just as easily as they can be filled, also
seems to reveal an effect on the semantic level of stories and images.
(p. ix) The argument is appropriately extended by Klose to include the
cognitive preoccupations of George Lakoff and Mark Johnson (Metaphors We
Live By, 1980) with the container as the primary subspecies in the genus
of the ontological metaphor, citing: Each of us is a container, with a
bounding surface and an in-out orientation. We project our own in-out
orientation onto other physical objects that are bounded by surfaces.
Thus we also view them as containers with an inside and an outside. (p.
25) Missing from such framings is how \"sacrifice\" (of the \"vase\")
might then be understood, especially any paradoxical implication
combining self-sacrifice and the sacrifice of otherness. How does one
\"participate\" in a sacrifice \-- especially if one is part of the
sacrifice? How would any such insight apply collectively and to a
religion as a whole? The paradox recalls the purported quest of
alchemists for a container to contain a universal solvent (alkahest)
that could dissolve the material of any container. Is the transcendental
nature of the divine, fundamental to Abrahamic monotheistic beliefs to
be understood as such a solvent? Any \"smashing\" of a \"vase\" suggests
a strange form of discontinuity, too \"comfortably\" described as a
\"paradigm shift\" when there is fundamental identification with the
paradigm subject to transformation, as in the case of each Abrahamic
religion. The discontinuity is better understood in terms of a
catastrophe \-- a higher order catastrophe as suggested by catastrophe
theory, and the unfinished work of Niklas Luhmann (A Systems Theory of
Religion, 2013). Such a catastrophe could be understood as triggered by
an archetypal \"deadly question\" calling into question the very
existence of a pattern of belief (In quest of the most deadly question,
2013; Enabling morphogenesis and transformation through catastrophic
questioning, 2013; Conformality of 7 WH-questions to 7 Elementary
Catastrophes: an exploration of potential psychosocial implications,
2006). Mathematical theology? Are there more insightful metaphors of
\"self-sacrifice\", as can be separately explored (Metaphors To Die By:
correspondences between a collapsing civilization, culture or group, and
a dying person, 2013)? It could be considered remarkable that the
Abrahamic religions, through their monotheism, all attach a high degree
of significance to mathematics and number symbolism. More remarkable,
however, is their failure to devote significant resources to the
potential of the mathematical theology which has inspired so many
mathematicians of faith. The possibility is argued separately
(Mathematical Theology: Future Science of Confidence in Belief
Self-reflexive \-- global reframing to enable faith-based governance,
2011). Mathematics has the considerable advantage of highly
sophisticated insight into higher-dimensional relationships, limits,
boundaries and the strange issue of \"remainders\", as can be otherwise
explored (Reintegration of a Remaindered World: cognitive recycling of
objects of systemic neglect, 2011). How indeed to engage with unbelief
and the \"left behind\"? How might \"evil\" be more fruitfully reframed,
given the relativity of recognition of \"right\" and \"wrong\" from any
given (global) perspective? As a form of religion for some, the role of
sacrifice in mathematics may indeed offer insights into its role in
religion, as indicated by the following: Weyl, as a mathemi1tician, was
ready, as any intuitionist, to sacrifice large parts of mathematics in
order to justify the rest \-- in terms of his extremely high standards
of rigour. On the other hand, Weyl, as a physicist, was not ready to
sacrifice them, for they are useful tools in physics. He does not
explain how some propositions can be useful tools in one science if they
are definitely false in another, the very science to which they belong
\-- as indeed they are, according to Weyl\'s mathematical views. I hope
that future research work in the empirical foundations of matbcmatics
will show in which sense propositions rejected by intuitionists can be
tested in practice, and in which sense such a testing justifies their
application in physics or other sciences. (Problems in the Philosophy of
Mathematics, 2011, 203) Curiously the elaboration by George Boole of
so-called Boolean logic, so fundamental to the information sciences,
resulted in an explanatory text by his wife, Mary Everest Boole, on the
\"Law of Sacrifice\" in mathematics (The Mathematical Psychology of
Gratry and Boole, translated from the language of the higher calculus
into that of elementary geometry, 1897). Somewhat ironically recent
research offers related insights from mathematics \-- notably on why
complex society may depend on occasionally murdering innocent people
(Annalee Newitz, Thanks to math, we can calculate the benefits of human
sacrifice, Ars Technica, 5 April 2016). Other mathematical research
provides insight into the causes of self-sacrifice in violent conflicts
around the world, from holy wars to gangland violence (Researchers test
what lies behind the extreme self-sacrifice of fighters, 16 March 2017).
How might such approaches offer insights into the benefits from the
greater challenge of the self-sacrifice of the Abrahamic religions? Are
there insights from seppuku and Buddhist self-immolation (Buddhism and
self-immolation: the theology of self-destruction, The Economist, 22
March 2013). Is there a multiverse to be imagined otherwise, as can be
variously explored (Transcending both scientific and poetic
comprehension of multiverse, 2012; Engendering a multiverse through
imagining, 2012)? Beyond \"just war\", \"just sacrifice\" and \"just
human\"? **[The complicity of the Abrahamic religions in \"just war\"
theory and \"just torture\" theory was highlighted above in relation to
any sense of \"just sacrifice\".]{.underline}** **[The imminent
possibility of further \"just sacrifice\" is currently actively
envisaged by the USA \-- necessarily under Christian auspices \-- with
respect to North Korea, following the \"Libya model\" instigated by a
NATO coalition sharing the same inspiration]{.underline}** (Why North
Korea Is Angered by 'Libya Model' in Nuclear Talks, The New York Times,
16 May 2018; Trump\'s \'Libya Model\' Remark on North Korea Was a Threat
and May Sink the June 12 Summit, The Diplomat, 18 May 2018). **[The main
proponents, Mike Pence and John Bolton, are recognized as giving
priority to their extreme Christian beliefs. The justification for this
approach is curiously consistent with an earlier threat to bomb Islamic
Pakistan \"back to the Stone Age\" if it failed to collaborate with a
superpower locked into a Christian \"Stone Age\" mentality
(]{.underline}**Musharraf: U.S. Threatened to Bomb Pakistan to the Stone
Age, Fox News, 22 September 2006; Nick Cullather, Bomb them Back to the
Stone Age: An Etymology, History News Network, 5 October 2006). The
limitations of this perspective have notably been explored by Edward de
Bono (I Am Right, You Are Wrong: New Renaissance: From Rock Logic to
Water Logic, 1990). The question is within what \"container\" is such a
sacrifice to be articulated? If sacrifice is to be understood as
essential to salvation in theological terms, there is the curious
possibility that a confuson has been unforunately cultivated between
\"human sacrifice\" and \"sacrifice of humanity\". [In the quest for
\"planetary salvation\" through appropriate governance of sustainability
and the like, what indeed might need to be sacrificed?]{.underline}
Animality? In the case of the individual human, much is made by theology
of transcending man\'s \"animal nature\". With respect to global
governance, the issue is well-framed by the famous comment by John
Maynard Keynes regarding the continuing challenge of \"animal spirits\"
(cf. Robert Shiller (Animal Spirits Depend on Trust, Wall Street
Journal, 27 January 2009; George A. Akerlof and Robert J. Shiller,
Animal Spirits: how human psychology drives the economy, and why it
matters for global capitalism, 2008). More generally, many failures of
collective initiative are compassionately excused by reference to
\"human nature\", with people being \"just human\" \-- and necessarily
\"only human\". Presumably this can also be applied to sexual abuse by
clergy. Exploiting the play on words, it appears that it is
**[systematic recourse to the excuse of \"just human]{.underline}**\"
that needs to be sacrificed through a more radical understanding of
\"sacrificing humanity\" in its more restrictive and unimaginative
sense. **[This]{.underline}** mig**[ht even suggest the curious notion
of \"humane sacrifice\" \-- as applied to humans rather than
animals.]{.underline}** Unfortunately it could be argued that
\"[humans\" have been only too successful in sacrificing
\"animals\"]{.underline} \-- as indicated above with [regard to the
extreme loss of biodiversity.]{.underline} The compassion for the animal
in man has not translated into compassion for the animal in nature \--
or for those which are slaughtered. How the animal in man can be
appropriately \"sacrificed\" remains a mystery \-- obscured by the
sacrifice of animals enabled by Abrahamic religions, whether
deliberately through ritual or negligently through the destruction of
nature. Similarly, appreciative reference to \"human nature\" obscures
the \"inhuman nature\" of man \-- and the inability for humans to dwell
appropriately in \"nature\".

#### Vote neg to end the American political-theological project by rejecting its attempts to regain righteousness. The alternative is a political ontology of enmity that forces the US to accept political difference and pluralism and removes its ability to identify enemies as enemies of humanity per liberalism

**Prozorov 7** \[Professor of International Relations, Petrozavodsk
State University, Russia, Sergei, "The ethos of insecure life: Reading
Carl Schmitt's existential decisionism as a Foucauldian ethics", in The
International Political thought of Carl Schmitt, eds. Louiza Osysseos
and Fabio Petito, pg. 233-5\]

The third step in the elaboration of a Schmittian ethics concerns
ethical work, those practices in which the subject engages in order to
constitute herself and which Foucault unites under the name 'askesis'
(Foucault 1984a: 355). For our purposes, [the ethical work]{.underline}
prescribed by Schmitt's existential decisionism [consists in the
friend--enemy distinction as a practice, the 'art of making enemies' as
a means to actively fashion the self.]{.underline} [The antagonistic
relationship with the Other is contained in the very definition of
ethics as a technique of the self. The significance of ethics as a
transgressive practice lies in the possibility of 'self- formation in
the face of all the other forces that fashion us']{.underline} (Simons
1995: 76). [The art of making enemies]{.underline} thus [consists in
actively pluralising differences, nurturing an antagonistic field, which
alone verifies the reality of one's subjectivity]{.underline}.
Difference and, more precisely, [making differences rather than
resolving them, become both the condition and the content of the
existence of the Schmittian subject. One is reminded at this stage of
the very specific function that Schmitt's political ontology assigns to
the figure of the enemy: the political relationship of enmity proceeds
from the strictly equal (in)validity of opponents' claims, in which
neither the Self nor the Other may legitimately resort to the language
of epistemic and moral certitude]{.underline} (Schmitt 1976, 2003). [In
this setting of antagonis-tic symmetry that resembles a well-regulated
duel, the Schmittian enemy loses all ethical privileges of the
Levinasian Other but is also spared the unfortunate destiny of the a
priori denigrated enemy of liberalism, reduced to the status of a
despicable monster to be humiliated and annihilated, rather than merely
defeated]{.underline} (see Schmitt 1976: 27--29, 53--54).

Nonetheless, [one should not exaggerate the 'friendliness' of the
relationship with the enemy]{.underline}. While both presupposing and
effecting a fundamental onto-axi-ological symmetry between the
adversaries, [the friend--enemy distinction utterly devalues a principle
central to the liberal ethos in Schmitt's interpretation: the principle
of discussion.]{.underline} To fully appreciate the irrelevance of
discussion to the decisionist ethics we need to specify its relationship
with alterity. [As opposed to the well-known critiques of realist
practices of security as stabilising the identity of the self via its
authoritative demarcation from the other, the friend--enemy
distinction,]{.underline} in our reading, [operates in two steps and
with two notions of alterity. Simultaneously with any exclusion or
authoritative nomination of a positive other]{.underline} ([the enemy as
something existentially alien to the self]{.underline}), [the decision
on the friend--enemy distinction traverses a space of negative alterity,
the void of undecidability, where neither the self nor the other yet
exists]{.underline} (cf. Zˇizˇek 1999a: 19--20). [It is this radical
alterity that is]{.underline} indeed [ontologically prior to the self,
but it must logically also be prior to any positive figure of the
other.]{.underline} [That which pre- cedes and exceeds the identities of
both self and the other is quite literally the void, the 'background of
emptiness', whose only characteristic is its radical dif- ference from
any positivity.]{.underline}

[This assumption of negative alterity that must be traversed in a
friend--enemy distinction reconfigures the relationship with any
positive other into that of existential equality. The existence of the
self is no longer owing to the existence of the positive other, since
both emerge simultaneously as the twin offspring of the friend--enemy
distinction]{.underline}. Yet [this mutual constitution of oneself and
one's enemy also marks an irreducible caesura between them that
functions as the very opposite of the 'radical interdependence'
emphasised by Levinasian-Derridean ethics]{.underline}. [While certainly
interdependent in the ontological sense, the self and the other only
emerge as subjects through the resolution of this interdependence
through the act of distinction]{.underline}. In a Schmittian ethics,
[the Levinasian openness to the advent of alterity is concretised in
terms of a vigilant receptivity, which calls for the perpetual activity
of differentiating between friends and enemies that defines the social
field in terms of intensities of association and
dissociation.]{.underline} In this logic, [an antagonistic relation with
a positive other is a marker that verifies one's subjectivity that must
not be erased in a search for reconciliation or consensus]{.underline}.

Thus, [the ethos of discussion appears wholly irrelevant to a Schmittian
ethics since it replaces the ontogenetic situation of self-creation with
an ontological reflection on the questions of truth or morality,
presupposing either a teleology of rational consensus or a neutralised
conception of truth as an emergent equilibrium]{.underline} (see Schmitt
1985b: 35--51). [Schmitt's criticism of the Enlightenment ideal of the
'discussing public', coupled with a Foucauldian reintroduction of the
political into the domain of the epistemic, entails an obvious
consequence: nothing is to be gained in discussion. If all that precedes
the difference between the self and the other is the brute 'being-there'
of the indifferent void, then there is little point in attempting to
efface this difference to arrive at a more fundamental identity of the
Same]{.underline}. If we are verified as subjects not through
identification but through dissociation, then any discussion that seeks
to resolve differences does little more than subsume one's existential
singularity under its own teleological or procedural normativity. If
truth is a thing of this world, then any consensus that emerges in
discussion will be always already permeated by power relations; that is,
it will always emerge as a result of an unfounded decision, however much
the event of the latter is disavowed:

[\[e\]very consensus, even a 'free' one, is somehow motivated and
brought into existence. Power produces consensus and often]{.underline},
to be sure, [a rational and ethically justified consensus]{.underline}.
Conversely, [consensus produces power, and then often an irrational
and]{.underline} -- despite the consensus -- [an ethically repugnant
one]{.underline}. (Schmitt 1999: 202)

[Aware of the eradication of difference inherent in the drive for
consensus, a decisionist ethics values difference without a liberal
'safety mechanism' of pos- tulating the underlying identity of
'humanity', which in Schmitt's astute obser- vation merely serves to
deny the enemy the existential status of being human, reducing him to a
'total non-value']{.underline} (Freund 1995: 19), [and has 'incalculable
effects \[since\] a war can thereby be driven to the most extreme
inhumanity']{.underline} (Schmitt 1976: 54). Just as Schmitt's political
realism on the level of interstate relations affirms pluralism in the
domain of the international, while privileging a minimal degree of
domestic homogeneity, [a decisionist ethics emphasises the maintenance
of difference in intersubjective relations while simultaneously
privileging a resolution of interdependence with the positive other via
a clear act of self-distinction and self-delimitation.]{.underline} In
this manner, [a decisionist ethics posits a telos of sovereign
subjectivity.]{.underline}

### 1nc alternates: political theology

#### The political economy is dominated by secularized theological concepts -- liberalism's intent on incorporating all life imbues transcendent notions of "life, liberty, and happiness" with an immanent strategy of intervention.

**Evans 16** -- Brad Evans, University of Bristol. \["Liberal Violence:
From the Benjaminian Divine to the Angels of History," Theory & Event,
Volume 19, Issue 1. Johns Hopkins University Press, 2016.\] MYLES

At the beginning of the Critique, **[Benjamin argued that 'a cause,
however effective, becomes violent]{.underline}**, in the precise sense
of the word, **[only when it enters into moral
relations'.]{.underline}** **[Morality]{.underline}** as it appears for
Benjamin here **[is inextricably linked to questions of political
theology.]{.underline}** Indeed, it is only by focusing more intently on
the relations between morality, violence, and political theology that
the Critique holds any conceptual value for us. That [the idea of
Sovereignty reveals powerful theological traces akin to]{.underline} the
[mythological contours]{.underline} put forward by Benjamin is now well
established. As Carl Schmitt asserted **['All significant concepts
of]{.underline}** the modern theory of **[the state are secularised
theological
concepts]{.underline}**'[18](https://muse-jhu-edu.proxy.lib.umich.edu/article/607272#f18).
Such appreciation has led James Martel to observe that 'Schmitt
articulates exactly how [this notion of a break itself disguises the
crucial (and theological) continuities with medieval and Christian
notions of sovereignty]{.underline}... In this way, **[modernity has a
new "political theology", one that serves to disguise both
the]{.underline}** more **[traditional Christian inheritance of the
modern state as well as the fact that the]{.underline}** modern
**[sovereign]{.underline}**, like the Christian God, **[continues to
decide upon the
exception'.]{.underline}**[19](https://muse-jhu-edu.proxy.lib.umich.edu/article/607272#f19)This
concern with sovereignty as a political extension or sophisticated
adaption of theology (both as a metaphysical and ontological phenomenon)
equally resonated with Jacques Derrida. **[Sovereignty]{.underline}**,
he argued, **[evidences a]{.underline}** kind of "ipsocentric\[ism\]"
which points to a **[long cycle of political theology that is at once
paternalistic and patriarchal,]{.underline}** and **[thus masculine, in
the filiation of
father-son-brother']{.underline}**[20](https://muse-jhu-edu.proxy.lib.umich.edu/article/607272#f20).
[Such ipsocentricism is 'revived or taken over' by a newer version of
itself, moving from the overtly religious and monarchic]{.underline}
forms of [sovereignty to 'the unavowed political theology... of the
sovereignty of the people]{.underline}, that is of [democratic
sovereignty'.]{.underline} The implications being, as Leo Strauss once
observed, '**[What presents itself as the "secularisation" of
theological concepts will have to be understood]{.underline}**, in the
last analysis, **[as an adaptation of traditional theology to the
intellectual climate produced by modern philosophy or
science]{.underline}** both **[natural and
political]{.underline}**'[21](https://muse-jhu-edu.proxy.lib.umich.edu/article/607272#f21).
So if '[modern politics is a chapter in the history of
religion]{.underline}'[22](https://muse-jhu-edu.proxy.lib.umich.edu/article/607272#f22)
as John Gray maintains, [how are we to grapple with]{.underline} the
complexity and meaning of the term ["political theology" without simply
referring to something that is]{.underline} altogether [elusive or
beyond apprehension]{.underline} in any verifiable sense of the term?
And [how may we further link this to our concern with the theological
dimensions to contemporary liberal violence?]{.underline}

Although **[the theological is profoundly metaphysical]{.underline}** as
[it connects questions of the infinitely unknowable]{.underline} with
worldly redemption, **[it only gains tangible political purchase if it
manages to reconcile ideas of salvation with the normative question of
what it means to live authentically.]{.underline}** While it should be
apparent that salvation is [central to all monotheistic religions, which
offer heavenly reward for earthly obedience, it has proven to
be]{.underline} no less [compatible with secular visions of the "good
life".]{.underline} **[Political theology doesn't simply relate in this
regard to a belief in the omnipotence of God and]{.underline}** its
**[unitary demands of "Oneness".]{.underline}** **[It is actually
possible to trace]{.underline}** the **[remnants of theological
reasoning to earthly/secularised conceptions of the politics,
sovereignty, and justice.]{.underline}** What is more, as Agamben points
out in his The Kingdom and the Glory (whose cover image detailing the
apse mosaic at Basilica Papale di San Paolo furore le Mura,
Rome projects the unsettling image of the empty throne), [while
sovereignty represents important conceptual reworking]{.underline} of a
distinct theological paradigms of the modern, [it is also possible to
reveal a different theological genealogy of the modern that is more
economic]{.underline} -- hence dynamic and productive in its modus
operandi: **['our concept of history has been formed according to the
theological paradigm of]{.underline}** the revelation of **[a "mystery"
that is, at the same time, an "economy",]{.underline}** an organisation,
and **[a "dispensation" of divine and human life...]{.underline}**
\[What is more\] [from the beginning theology conceives divine life and
the history of humanity as an oikonomia,]{.underline} that is, that
**[theology is itself "economic" and did not simply become so at a later
time through
secularisation.']{.underline}**[23](https://muse-jhu-edu.proxy.lib.umich.edu/article/607272#f23)

[Agamben traces]{.underline} here [the idea of a "divine economy" back
to a decisive moment in]{.underline} the history of [Christian theology
in which questions pertaining to the Holy Trinity found practical
meaning.]{.underline} Hence, **[for Agamben, it is possible to derive
from Christianity a 'political theology, which founds the transcendence
of sovereign power on the single God, and economic theology, which
replaces this transcendence with the idea of an oikonomia, conceived as
an immanent ordering]{.underline}** -- domestic and not political in a
strict sense -- **[of both divine and human
life]{.underline}**'[24](https://muse-jhu-edu.proxy.lib.umich.edu/article/607272#f24).
From this perspective, **[the economy is a 'synonym for the providential
unfolding of history according to eschatological
design']{.underline}**[25](https://muse-jhu-edu.proxy.lib.umich.edu/article/607272#f25).
[Such a divinity does not propose any natural foundation for
being.]{.underline} [It overcomes the history of being as a metaphysical
praxis.]{.underline} What is therefore commonly termed
**[biopolitics,]{.underline}** he believes, especially today, **[remains
concerned with the "divine governance" of peoples according to some
interventionist plan for earthly salvation.]{.underline}** As Agamben
writes elsewhere, ['Rather than the proclaimed end of history, we
are]{.underline}, in fact, [witnessing the incessant though aimless
motion of this machine, which, in a sort of colossal parody of
theological oikonomia, has assumed the legacy of the providential
governance of the world]{.underline}, **[this machine]{.underline}**
(true to the original eschatological vocation of providence) **[is
leading us to
catastrophe]{.underline}**'[26](https://muse-jhu-edu.proxy.lib.umich.edu/article/607272#f26).
According to Antonio Negri, **[this attempt to bring economy, political
theology, and biopolitics into close relation is
significant]{.underline}** as it enables Agamben to nuance (indeed
overcome) the limits of his juridical paradigm; **['showing how economy
becomes a simple agency of theological-political power: an exercise,
thus, in the worldly reproduction of social
life']{.underline}**[27](https://muse-jhu-edu.proxy.lib.umich.edu/article/607272#f27).
Echoing Agamben's theological concerns, [what therefore becomes "the
true problem" is 'not sovereignty but government, not the king but the
minister,]{.underline} **[not the law but the police
force,]{.underline}** that is, **[the state machine that they form and
keep in
motion"]{.underline}**[28](https://muse-jhu-edu.proxy.lib.umich.edu/article/607272#f28).

#### The whole of the modern legal system is premised on secularized theological concepts. The original sacrificial system has been subsumed into the juridico-political order which wherein the law assumes the status of a new transcendent God and the values of western liberalism triumph again. The implication is twofold: first that the aff\'s implicit invocation of a set of values functions now to legitimize the violent removal of sacrificial victims and enemies of the political order in order to ensure it's smooth functioning. Second this creates a renewed sacrificial crisis, where the god of western values legitimizes unending further sacrifice in the form of a perpetual war divorced from ethics and critical reasoning, justified by desire to appease the divine law of American constitutionalism

**Mensch 18.** James, Faculty of Humanities, Charles University, Prague
5-Jinonice, Czech Republic. "Violence and the return of the religious."
Springer Science+Business Media B.V., part of Springer Nature 2018.

Rene [Girard speaks of the return of the religious as a ''return of the
sacred... in the form of violence]{.underline}.'' [This violence was
inherent in the original ''sacrificial system,'' which deflected
communal violence onto the victim.]{.underline} In this article, I argue
that there is a double return of the sacred. **[With the collapse of the
original sacrificial system, the sacred first reappears in the legal
order.]{.underline}** **[When this loses its binding claim, it reappears
in the political order.]{.underline}** Here, my claim will be that Carl
Schmitt's conception of the political is not simply structurally similar
to Girard's conception of the sacrificial system. It is actually a
manifestation of this. **[In this political return of the religious, the
religious and the political systems are conflated.]{.underline}** What
prevents us from seeing this is the self-concealment that is essential
to the sacrificial act, a self-concealment that also characterizes its
twofold return.

The debates on the return of the religious have a curious quality. It is
not as if, viewed on a global scale, religions had departed and are now,
somehow, returning. The puzzlement is rather, Why has the force behind
them not disappeared? Why has it not succumbed to the various
critiques---particularly those of science--- directed against it?
Nietzsche, for example, expressed the impact that Darwin's Descent of
Man had on contemporary culture by writing, ''Formerly one tried to get
a feel for the majesty of human beings by pointing backward toward their
divine descent, this has now become a forbidden path, because before its
gate stands the ape.''1 Given this dismissal of the Biblical standpoint,
what is behind the persistence of the ''religions of the book''? What
have such critiques missed? With these questions comes the suspicion
that [we do not understand the religious or the sacred]{.underline},
that it is somehow outside or beyond the division between the rational
and the irrational. As such, [it cannot be dismissed by calling it
''irrational.'']{.underline} But, if it is not some error that can be
corrected by providing the correct information, [what, in fact, is
it?]{.underline} A look at the hermeneutical context of the discussions
regarding the return is instructive. The context is that of t[he
violence perpetrated in religion's name**. Since the World Trade Center
attacks, such violence has been prominent in the news.**]{.underline}
**[It appears in the accounts of the ShiaSunni conflicts that continue
to consume the Middle East, the Isis inspired attacks in the West, the
ongoing sectarian tensions that mark the Hindu--Muslim divide, and the
Burmese Buddhists' ethnic cleansing of the Muslim
Rohingyas.]{.underline}** **[In the West, such cases recall the
religious wars that consumed Europe at the end of the
Renaissance.]{.underline}** They also bring to the fore the fact that
**[such conflicts are not just religious but also political. There is,
in each case, a blurring of the divide between religious and political
authority.]{.underline}** As the philosopher, Gary Gutting, has written,
to the point that [the claims of religion exceed those of normal human
understanding they become a matter of faith rather than
discussion]{.underline}. There exists a division, unbridgeable by
reason, between those who believe in such claims and those who do not.
[When these claims become political, then religious exclusion becomes
political. The excluded are deprived of civil and political rights. At
this point, they become an excluded minority, open to
violence]{.underline}.2

Is there, then, an inner connection between the political and the
religious? On the surface, there does not seem to be such. Politics, it
is often said, is the art of compromise. It is based on the fact that,
as Aristotle writes, a single individual ''may be compared to an
isolated piece at draughts.''3 Apart from the board and the other
pieces, the piece has no sense. This is because [humans have to
cooperate. Our embodiment brings with it needs for food, shelter,
clothing and so on. Yet we are incapable individually of fulfilling all
these needs.]{.underline} Given this, we have to specialize and share
the results of our individual labors. We also need to work together on
the joint projects that preserve the community. [This does not just
necessitate communication. It also involves a process of continuous
negotiation, where we attempt to balance the needs of individuals,
competing groups, and those of the community taken as a
whole]{.underline}. The political order, in Hannah Arendt's view, arises
when discussion replaces violence in such decisions.4 There is, of
course, a different view of the political. It is expressed by a
tradition stretching from Plato's Thrasymachus to Thomas Hobbes and Carl
Schmitt. In their view, **[humans are competitive rather than
co-operative.]{.underline}** **[Our natural condition,]{.underline}** as
Hobbes wrote, **[is]{.underline}** that of a ''**[war of every man
against every man.]{.underline}**''5 [The political order regulates, but
does not eliminate this natural violence. It preserves it in its
institutions. The police and the penalties that the state imposes on
infractions exhibit its presence.]{.underline} What is the relation of
such ''natural'' violence to the violence associated with religion? To
answer this, scholars have recently focussed on the theories of Schmitt
and Rene´ Girard, who are united in seeing [violence as endemic to
humanity]{.underline}.6 Both claim that **[it can only be restrained by
redirecting it towards a determined minority---the ''enemy'' for
Schmitt, the ''sacrificial victim'' for Girard]{.underline}**. In
Salvatore's ''parallel reading'' of **[these authors,
they]{.underline}** are **[united in their focus ''on the structural
relationship between political stabilization and social
exclusion]{.underline}**.''7 [For both, ''exclusion is a structural, and
thus, unavoidable side effect of any form of political
organization.'']{.underline}8 **[It expresses itself in the religious
exclusion of the ''victim'' or the political elimination of the
''enemy.'']{.underline}** The question that remains, however, is that of
the conflation of the two, the situation where [the sacrificial victim
becomes the political enemy.]{.underline} This can be put in terms of
the return of the religious understood as the return of violence. Girard
writes, regarding this return, ''[After having extricated ourselves from
the sacred somewhat more successfully than other societies have done, to
the point of 'forgetting' the founding violence, of losing all sight of
it**, we are now about to rediscover it. The essential violence returns
to us in a spectacular fashion**]{.underline}---not only with regard to
history but also with regard to knowledge.''9 [What we face is a
''surreptitious return of the sacred, in a form that is not transcendent
but immanent.'' **It is a return ''in the form of violence and a
knowledge of violence.''**]{.underline} He adds, ''The thought which
moves away indefinitely from the violent origin approaches it again, but
without its knowledge, for this thought is never conscious of changing
its direction.''10 Implicit here is the thought that the element missed
by the rational critiques of religion---the element that prevents
religion from being dismissed as an ''error''---is the violence at the
heart of the sacred. This violence remains even when, in its return, the
religious or the sacred changes its direction. In what follows, I shall
argue that, in fact, there is a double return of the sacred. **[With the
collapse of the ''sacrificial system,'' the sacred reappears in the
legal order.]{.underline}** **[When this loses its binding claim, the
change in direction is towards the political.]{.underline}** Here, my
claim will be that Schmitt's conception of **[the political
is]{.underline}** not simply structurally similar to Girard's conception
of **[the sacrificial system.]{.underline}** It is actually a
contemporary manifestation of this. [**In the political return of the
religious, the sacrificial victim becomes the political enemy.** What
prevents us from seeing this is the self-concealment that is essential
to the sacrificial act,]{.underline} a self-concealment that also
characterizes its twofold return.

1 The sacrificial system Girard and Thomas Hobbes both point to equality
as the root of violence. There is, however, a difference in their
understanding of equality. For Hobbes, equality is natural. He writes,
''Nature has made men so equal'' that no one ''can ... claim to himself
any benefit, to which another may not pretend, as well as he.''11 Since
both see themselves as entitled to what ''they cannot both enjoy ...
they become enemies ... and endeavor to destroy or subdue one
another.''12 In this description, the object is prior and the conflict
arises because both desire it. Girard, focussing on our innate tendency
to imitate one another, reverses this relation. He writes, ''Rivalry
does not arise because of the fortuitous convergence of two desires on a
single object; rather, the subject desires the object because the rival
desires it.''13 His point is that [**we are social animals because of
our imitative behavior.** This is what allows us to learn from one
another]{.underline}.14 The equality that Hobbes points to is, for
Girard, as much a matter of imitation as it is of personal features. As
a result[, we do not just compete out of a sense of equal entitlement.
We come into conflict because our imitation of another's behavior
extends to the desires exhibited in such behavior.]{.underline}
According to Girard, [there is a kind of ''positive feedback'' here, the
conflict of desires feeds on itself, with each participant feeling his
desire increasing as he is thwarted by his rival.]{.underline}15 **[The
result is a growing violence that threatens to undermine the relations
that we need to survive. It becomes contagious when the losers in the
competitive struggle seek revenge.]{.underline}**
''[Vengeance]{.underline},'' Girard writes, ''...[is an interminable,
infinitely repetitive process. Every time it turns up in some part of
the community, it threatens to involve the whole social
body]{.underline}.16 **[It is at this point that the community turns to
religion.]{.underline}** According to Girard, ''Religion shelters us
from violence just as violence seeks shelter in religion.''17 Their
intimate connection arises from the attempt to limit violence**[. The
community uses the sacrifices that religion institutes to deflect the
violence that threatens to consume it.]{.underline}** [As for the
sacrificial victims, there is no question of their guilt or innocence,
''no question of 'expiation.''']{.underline} **[At issue is society's
attempt ''to deflect upon a relatively indifferent victim, a
'sacrificeable' victim, the violence that would otherwise be vented on
its own members, the people it most desires to
protect.]{.underline}**''18 The reason for the lack of qualities---the
indifference---of the victim is that the guilt for the violence is
shared by the members of community. The violence is their own. So is
their susceptibility to violence---i.e., their liability to be
victimized by it. [The victim, in other words, stands in for both sides
of the situation.19 On the one hand, he bears the guilt for the communal
violence; on the other, he is the victim of this violence. For his
sacrifice to be effective, however, the community must conceal from
itself **this ''displacement of violence**]{.underline}.'' It is in
terms of this concealment that we can speak of violence seeking
''shelter in religion.'' According to Girard, ''**[Religion in its
broadest sense'' is ''another term for that obscurity that surrounds
man's efforts to defend himself by curative or preventative means
against his own violence]{.underline}**.''20 **[In the theological
interpretation it offers, it ''is the god who supposedly demands the
victims; \[]{.underline}**it is\] he alone, in principle, who savors the
smoke from the altars and requisitions the slaughtered flesh. It is to
appease his anger that the killing goes on, that the victims
multiply.''21 **[Here, we project upon God our own violence, thereby
concealing it]{.underline}**. There is, in fact, a double
concealment**[. We collectively conceal from ourselves not just our
authorship of violence,]{.underline}** but also the fact of our being
the victims of the same violence. Christianity exhibits this sacrificial
system in a double projection. In its case, concealment demands that we
project on God not only our own violence, but also our victimhood. Thus,
God, Himself, in the form of his Son, is for Christians the sacrificial
victim, the very victim demanded by God the Father. In the sacrificial
system, the victims must display a crucial characteristic---one that is
independent of their possessing any specific qualities. This is their
inability to exact revenge. While they have to bear some resemblance to
the members of the community, they must stand outside of it. They must
be unable to avail themselves of its resources so as to retaliate
against their persecutors. In Girard's words, ''between these victims
and the community a crucial social link is missing, so they can be
exposed to violence without fear of reprisal.''22 The victims, then, are
composed of ''exterior or marginal individuals, incapable of
establishing or sharing the social bonds that link the rest of the
inhabitants.'' They are ''foreigners or enemies'' or those in a
''servile condition,'' incapable of ''fully integrating themselves into
the community.''23 As a result, ''they can be exposed to violence
without fear of reprisal.''24 Based on these conditions, the black
victims of lynchings and the marginalized Jews of Nazi Germany can count
as sacrificial victims. To see them as such, however, we have to move
from the initial relation of religion and violence to its concealed
returns.

2 Sacrifice and the judicial system The first return occurs with the
replacement of the sacrificial system. According to Girard, ''When ...
the judicial system appears, sacrifice disappears.''25 This is because
it performs the same function, which is ''to prevent the contagion of
violence.'' It takes the vengeance that is at the heart of this
contagion and ''effectively limits it to a single act of reprisal,''
that performed by the courts.26 As Girard also expresses this, the
''judicial system rationalizes revenge.'' It ''succeeds in limiting and
isolating its effects in accordance with social demands.''27 As such
remarks indicate, the judicial system shares a number of features with
the system it replaces. **[The violence that sheltered in the religious,
sacrificial system now finds shelter in the judicial processes. Thus,
neither the sacrificial system nor the judicial processes are
''strangers to the ways of violence.''28 The concealment that the
sacrificial system offered to violence is now taken over by the judicial
system.]{.underline}** In Girard's words, ''[Like sacrifice, it
conceals---even as it also reveals---its resemblance to
vengeance.''29]{.underline} [The concealment arises from its being
''imbued with religious concepts]{.underline}.''30 **[The judicial
system also claims to be ''a violence that is holy, legal, and
legitimate,'' a violence ''successfully opposed to a violence that is
unjust, illegal, and illegitimate.]{.underline}**'' [As ''a sanctified,
legitimate form of violence,'' it avoids ''becoming an object of
disputes and recriminations.'']{.underline} It escapes being trapped by
''the vicious circle of revenge.''31 Thus, **[if before the god demanded
the killing of the victim, now the judicial system makes this demand.
Doing so, it takes the place of the god. Its authority and impartiality
are those of the divinity it has replaced. It assumes the god's
transcendence.32 As such, it appears as ''beholden to no one ... at the
disposal of everyone'' and is ''universally
respected.''33]{.underline}** What happens when this assumption of
transcendence and impartiality is no longer accepted? Girard writes,
''As soon as the essential quality of transcendence--- religious,
humanistic, or whatever---is lost, there are no longer any terms by
which to define the legitimate form of violence ... The definition of
legitimate and illegitimate forms then becomes a matter of mere
opinion.''34 **[The result is a renewal of the original ''sacrificial
crisis,'' which occurred with ''the disappearance of the sacrificial
rites'' and, with this, ''the disappearance of the difference between
impure violence and purifying violence.'']{.underline}** The former is
the violence of revenge, the latter that of sacrifice. **[The point of
sacrifice was to control the intercommunal violence that, in the form of
vengeance, threatened to consume the community. With the loss of its
efficacy, the distinction between the pure and the impure disappears
''and impure, contagious, reciprocal violence spreads throughout the
community]{.underline}**.'' The original sacrificial crisis, thus, was
''a crisis of distinctions.''35 As such, it was ''a crisis affecting the
cultural order,'' which is itself ''nothing more than a regulated system
of distinctions.''36 What brought about this crisis was the breakdown of
the religious concealment that is essential to sacrifice. People no
longer believed that it was ''the god'' who demanded the victims. The
decision regarding victims lost its transcendence and, hence, its
impartial, ''holy, legal, and legitimate'' quality. The result was ''a
threat to the very basis of the community, to the principles on which
its social harmony and equilibrium depend.''37 The same points hold with
regard to [the judicial system when, through the politicization of its
processes and decisions, it loses its claim to impartiality and
transcendence. Its breakdown also threatens the cultural
order.]{.underline} [Again there is a crisis of distinctions and the
threat of all-consuming violence.]{.underline} [If the judicial system
represents the return of the religious as sheltering and being sheltered
by violence, its breakdown can be understood as calling for a further
return]{.underline}. As before, this return can be understood as
involving a concealment. As with the judicial system, [it need not be
recognized as explicitly religious. It can involve a transformation of
the political, one that seeks within it the transcendence claimed by the
religious.]{.underline}

3 The political system According to Carl Schmitt, ''The specific
political distinction to which political actions and motives can be
reduced is that between friend and enemy.''38 In Schmitt's political
system, the enemy takes the place of the sacrificial victim. Just as the
victim's quality is a matter of indifference, so, in his account, ''the
political enemy'' appears without any special features. As Schmitt
writes, he ''need not be morally evil or aesthetically ugly; he need not
appear as an economic competitor, and it may even be advantageous to
engage with him in business transactions.''39 What distinguishes him is,
first of all, his marginal quality. In Schmitt's words, he is ''the
other, the stranger,'' that is, ''existentially something different and
alien.''40 Like Girard's victim, he lacks the social bonds that would
make him a part of society. He is also distinguished by his sacrificial
quality---i.e., his readiness to be killed. Discussing the concept of
the enemy, Schmitt asserts that its ''real meaning'' refers to ''the
real possibility of physical killing.''41 [In Girard's sacrificial
system, the point]{.underline} of such killing [is to restore social
order. **At stake is the existential survival of the
community**]{.underline}. In Schmitt's system, such survival is at issue
in the ''state of exemption.'' **[This ''case of extreme peril,'' of
''danger to the existence of the state,'' appears in the failure of the
legal, judicial system.]{.underline}**42 Thus, the exception ''appears
when a situation in which legal prescriptions can be valid must first be
brought about. Every general norm demands a normal, everyday frame of
life to which it can be factually applied and which is subjected to its
regulations ... There exists no norm that is applicable to chaos.''43
**[For Schmitt, the enemy assumes the restorative role]{.underline}**
that Girard assigns to the victim. **[His presence unifies it and
ensures its cohesion. If no external enemy is present, then an internal
one must found.]{.underline}** In Schmitt's words, ''[this requirement
for internal peace compels it in critical situations to decide also upon
the domestic enemy. Every state provides, therefore, some kind of
formula for the declaration of an internal enemy.''44]{.underline}

4 Transcendence and sovereignty How does the declaration of the enemy
restore the legal order? The crisis of this order, according to Girard,
was caused by the loss of its sense of transcendence. To function, he
writes, the system requires ''the recognition of the sovereignty and
independence of the judiciary, whose decisions no group, not even the
collectivity as a body, can challenge.''45 The judicial system, in other
words, must have an authority transcending all these. For Schmitt, this
authority is found in the sovereign. He decides on the exception.46 He
also determines who is to count as an enemy.47 In both of these cases,
he has an absolute authority. This authority, in fact, is such that he
transcends the legal order. In Schmitt's words, ''The decision \[that a
state of exception exists\] frees itself from all normative ties and
becomes in the true sense absolute.'' The decision that the conditions
for legality no longer exist is one that, if correct, is by definition
not bound by such conditions. It is, in this sense, absolute. Thus, with
''the suspension of the entire existing order,'' the sovereign acts with
''principally unlimited authority.'' ''In such a situation,'' Schmitt
adds, ''it is clear that the state remains, whereas law recedes.''48
What remains, in fact, is the sovereign as a transcendent principle.
Like the god, who demanded sacrifice, he is both within and yet outside
the human order. In Schmitt's words, ''He decides whether there is an
extreme emergency as well as what must be done to eliminate it. Although
he stands outside the normally valid legal system, he nevertheless
belongs to it, for it is he who must decide whether the constitution
needs to be suspended in its entirety.''49 This being both inside and
outside the legal system means that the sovereign has complete authority
with regard to it. Being himself unconstrained by its norms or rules, he
nonetheless acts within it, i.e., has its forces at his command. Thus,
under the sovereign, ''order in the juristic sense still prevails even
if it is not of the ordinary kind.''50 The order now comes from the
sovereign will, what the sovereign decides becomes law. This means that
''\[t\]he sovereign produces and guarantees the situation in its
totality.''51 Standing outside of the legal framework, he belongs to it
by founding and enforcing it. Thus, his ''authority proves that to
produce law it need not be based on law.''52 For Schmitt, then, the
sovereign will replaces that of ''the god.'' In producing law, the
sovereign provides its transcendent principle. According to Schmitt, the
decision of the sovereign is ''absolute and independent of the
correctness of its content.''53 There is nothing behind it. In fact,
''\[l\]ooked at normatively, the decision emanates from nothingness.''54
It is simply an act of the pure spontaneity of his will. It is an act of
unconditioned freedom.55 As such, it can no more be questioned than the
will of the god. The law that the sovereign produces thus regains its
required transcendence. As for the violence that, in the system of
sacrifice, was directed against the victim and, in the judicial system,
was directed against the offender, its force now falls on the enemy. As
in the original system, there is no question of his guilt or innocence.
At issue, is not ''expiation.'' The enemy, like the victim, is simply
defined by his functioning in the system. He cannot step out of his
role, since he is defined in terms of it. Thus, there was nothing that
the Jew in the Nazi system could do to expiate his guilt. The system for
which Carl Schmitt served as a legal theorist, required him and other
similar internal enemies, for its internal cohesion. Like the sovereign,
the chosen enemy was both inside and outside of the social order.
Marginalized, he stood outside. Yet, as a victim, he was within,
essential to its functioning. 5 Violence and the suspension of the
ethical Denis de Rougement wrote of attending a Hitler rally in 1935,
''I thought I was participating in a mass meeting, a political rally.
But they were celebrating their cult. A liturgy was being celebrated,
the great sacred ceremony of a religion that I was not a member of and
that rolled over me and forcefully pushed me back'' like a wave. The
force he experienced was greater than the mere ''physical force'' of
''all those terribly tightly packed bodies.''56 It was religious. In
fact, as he reports, Hitler's followers had an essentially religious
relation to him.57 This relation gave them license to behave in ways
that were morally repugnant. Under Hitler, the violence they perpetrated
against ''enemies'' reached enormous proportions. For Girard, as we have
seen, **[violence is essential to religion. This violence, however, acts
as social remedy. It serves to deflect the intercommunal strife that
threatens the social order.]{.underline}** But the violence of Hitler's
followers went beyond all social constraints. **[Resulting in war, it
worked to destroy the social order]{.underline}**. [The same can be said
of Shia--Sunni violence that followed the American invasion of Iraq and
the Hindu--Muslim violence, which accompanied the partition of
India]{.underline}. The question such examples raise is whether the
relation of religion to violence is such that violence exceeds its
social function of insuring cohesion through exclusion. According to
Girard, religion performs its role through the transcendence it offers.
The transcendence of the god reappears in each of its returns. What is
the relation of violence to this transcendence? Carl Schmitt, in linking
sovereignty to the state of exception, quotes Kierkegaard saying, ''The
exception explains the general and itself. And if one wants to study the
general correctly, one only needs to look around for a true exception.
It reveals everything more clearly than does the general.''58 For
Schmitt, the exception is the situation where the legal order no longer
obtains. It shows that the origin of law is the sovereign decision. Such
a decision, as ''absolute and independent of the correctness of its
content,'' is not based on knowledge, but on an act of the will. Now,
for Kierkegaard, this act is crucial to becoming a Christian. This is
because the object of Christian faith unites the contradictories of the
eternal and the temporal. It sees the non-worldly, non-temporal God as
present in the historical figure, Jesus.59 Since it involves a
contradiction, its object transcends reason. As a result, Christian
**[faith is a matter of will rather than of
understanding.]{.underline}**60 **[This priority of the will shows
itself in]{.underline}** what Kierkegaard calls **[''the teleological
suspension of the ethical,'' which occurs when we face the transcendent
God.]{.underline}** **[As the story of Abraham and Isaac shows, God can
demand an action that cannot be ethically defended.]{.underline}** [Seen
in the light of faith, Abraham's willingness to kill Isaac appears as a
''sacrifice.'']{.underline} **[Grasped in terms of ethics, it appears as
''murder]{.underline}**.''61 Which is it? According to Kierkegaard, we
confront a paradox. In his words, The paradox of faith is this, that the
individual is higher than the universal, that the individual ...
determines his relation to the universal \[that is, to the ethical\] by
his relation to the absolute, not his relation to the absolute by his
relation to the universal. The paradox can also be expressed by saying
that [there is an absolute duty toward God; for, in this relationship of
duty the individual as an individual stands related absolutely to the
absolute]{.underline}.62 The sentiment expressed here is the opposite of
Kant's. For Kant, the universal is higher than the individual. The
universal, as expressed in a moral ideal, is, in fact, that by which we
recognize the absolute. Thus, for Kant, ''Even the holy one of the
Gospel must first be compared with our ideal of moral perfection before
he is recognized as such.''63 Jesus, in other words, is simply an
example of moral perfection. It is our conception of the ideal that
allows us to recognize him. In Kant's view, we grasp the ethical ideal
by universalizing the principle or ''maxim'' of our actions. Thus, if I
want to know if it is moral to make a false promise---for example,
promise to repay a debt when I cannot---I ask, what would happen if
everyone did this? Could I universalize the maxim that it is permissible
to make a false promise to get out of financial difficulties? Doing so,
I see that nobody would believe this promise and, hence, a universal law
with this as its content is impossible.64 The crucial point here is that
[we employ reason when we universalize our maxims.]{.underline} The
conclusion follows logically from the universalization. **[Such
strategy, however, is unavailable when we assume the transcendence of
the absolute]{.underline}**. **[At this point, God's will supersedes
understanding. We are no longer within the realm of ethics understood as
a set of universal rules accessible to rational subjects]{.underline}**.
In fact, [to the point that God's transcendence is absolute, he is
beyond all the moral strictures that stem from the common experience of
mankind]{.underline}. [This, then, is what allows the violence that
shelters in religion to exceed its social function.]{.underline} As
Girard shows, **[the transcendence of the divine secures the acceptance
of the act of sacrifice; it also underpins the consent given to judicial
order]{.underline}**. For Schmitt, [transcendence is essential to
the]{.underline} sovereign's absolute authority to produce [law. Such
transcendence, however, can also leave us in a moral
vacuum]{.underline}. **[At this point, the violence that shelters in
religion exceeds its initial purpose of ensuring social cohesion. It can
itself become all-consuming.]{.underline}**

6 The current sacrificial crisis It is important to note that this
analysis of the return of the religious in the form of the political
holds under two conditions. The first is that we accept the tradition of
Hobbes and Schmitt, which claims that [the political order regulates,
but does not eliminate our natural violence.]{.underline} In their view,
[war is the natural condition of mankind.]{.underline} This implies, in
Foucault's words, ''[politics itself is a continuation of war by other
means.]{.underline}''65 Arendt, for one, would certainly oppose this
condition. For her, the political involves negotiation and compromise.
As such, it seeks to replace violence with persuasive discourse. Such
discourse, however, can become corrupted. It can be replaced by what
Foucault calls [the ''discourse of **perpetual war.''** This is ''a
discourse in which truth functions exclusively as a weapon that is used
to win an exclusively partisan victory.']{.underline}'66 Here, ''truth
is no longer the universal truth of the philosopher.'' It is, rather,
''a [truth that can be deployed only from its combat position, from the
perspective of the sought-for victory]{.underline}.''67 **[In such a
situation, decisions regarding the political, constitutional order, are
matters of combat rather than discussion.]{.underline}** **[To gain the
control of the organs of government---the police, the court, the
legislative assembly---is to gain the instruments of
oppression.]{.underline}** The second condition for the analysis
involves Girard's hopes for the redemptive message of Christianity. In
Girard's view, Jesus did not die ''as a sacrifice, but in order that
there may be no more sacrifices.''68 The real meaning of his Passion is
that ''of subverting sacrifice and barring it from working ever again by
forcing the founding mechanism out into the open.''69 This happens
because Jesus, in the Gospels, is the innocent victim, par excellence.
His sacrifice reveals that the violence that condemns him is our own.
The difficulty with this view, as Salvatore remarks, is that it
positions the Gospel's message as both ''a brake and accelerator.'' On
the one hand, it contributes ''to curtail the different forms of
scapegoating perpetrated around the world inasmuch as potential killers
become aware of the perverse mechanism that operates behind their
backs.'' Yet, the unmasking of the sacrificial mechanism leaves social
actors without a reliable way to eliminate violence from their
community.70 Given this, the unmasking appears as part of the
''sacrificial crisis.'' As such, it opens the way to the judicial and
the political returns of the religious. Here, the condition for our
analysis is the waning of the Gospel message of redemption and, hence,
its action as a brake. People no longer grasp its point, which is that
salvation occurs, not through violent sacrifice, but rather through
selfless love. Given these conditions, we can say that the contemporary
return of the religious can assume two forms. The first occurs when the
religious absorbs the political. Here, the government takes on an
explicitly theocratic cast. It claims an authority that transcends
normal human understanding. It can then issue decrees guarding the
faith---such as those concerning blasphemy---and persecute non-believers
to prevent them from corrupting believers. In the second, the political
absorbs the religious. Assuming its transcendence, it also claims an
authority that exceeds human understanding. This claim becomes that of
the sovereign, who appears as a charismatic leader, i.e., a leader who
has an absolute or ''one-to-one'' relation with his followers. Here, the
priority of the will over the understanding becomes the priority of the
leader's will. Examples can be found of both forms of return. In terms
of their causes, one can point to the existence of globalization,
without a corresponding, adequate legal order. On the one hand, the
world has grown more interconnected. On the other, there is no
correlative juridical system to channel the violence that the
sacrificial process once contained. The return of the religious in the
form of a transcendent legal order is, in other words, absent on the
global level. Beyond this, there is a lack of faith in the limited order
that obtains. **[The politization of this order, its rendering by an
increasingly narrow nationalism, points to the present version of the
sacrificial crisis.]{.underline}**71 So do the failures to assure
cohesion by appealing to the transcendent. In the past century, both
communism and capitalism have made transcendent claims. They both
asserted the absolute and universal validity of their respective legal
systems. Communism, in the traditional sense, has largely disappeared,
while few unquestionably accept the claims of capitalism. In such a
situation, [we can speak of the return of the religious as a return of
the repressed in the Freudian sense]{.underline}.72 Such a return is
impglicit in Girard's claim that **[having come ''to the point of
'forgetting' the founding violence, of losing all sight of it, we are
now about to rediscover it. The essential violence returns to us in a
spectacular fashion.]{.underline}**''73 Like all returns of the
repressed it is, as Freud teaches, a return in a distorted form. **[It
presently appears in the guise of the political and the sacrifices
demanded by this.]{.underline}**

#### The aff's political theology is the legacy of American Calvinism -- a mixture of religion and politics constituted by a desire for dominance in the world, our belief in our superior ability to manage the world, attempts to overcome past grievances by new purifying actions, a belief in the idea that we can be redeemed by sacred objects like the plan

Violence and the Sacred (Studies in Violence, Mimesis, & Culture)

Continuing to explore and diversify Jon Pahl's theme, I will argue that
[the seed of American preemption (i.e., the myth of American
preeminence, insofar as it rests on violence---"containing" it, but also
recycling it in the guise of]{.underline} **[preemptive
aggression]{.underline}** at home or abroad) **[lies in a form of
religious sadism]{.underline}**. Girard, by virtue of the defi nition of
desire given in Deceit, Desire, and the Novel, argues that [the driving
force of culture is, at its heart, "metaphysical desire."]{.underline}
He suggests that "[mimetic desire," whereby humans imitate the desire of
the other and then use this mediator-model as a motivating
source]{.underline}, 82 Jon Pahl and James Wellman [are seeking to
borrow from him godlike qualities and the power to exist in a **godlike
mode**]{.underline}. Of course, for Girard, [this ferocious need always
"ends in enslavement, failure, and shame]{.underline}" (1961, 176).
[**Since these desires are always just beyond reach, so that desire is
thwarted and rivalries form, which in the end produce confl ict and
violence, and eventuate in scapegoating**. Blood is shed, and through
these confl icts, the archaic process of sacralizing the victim produces
a new---if fragile and provisional---glow of unity and potential
prosperity.]{.underline} [The cycle of violence contained by sacrifice
continues as a natural fl ow of cultural construction]{.underline}. We
might protest against this bloody dynamic of history, but as Walter
Benjamin remarked, "Th ere is no document of civilization which is not
at the same time a document of barbarism" (Benjamin 1968, 256). Indeed,
Girard argues that **[the sacralizing process is precisely the way in
which this barbarism is transmogrifi ed into myth, so that the
community's "founding murder" becomes the community's project of
salvation]{.underline}**. **[In America, the ongoing violence (against
Native peoples, slaves, women, and minorities of every kind) has been
authorized by a specific type of Christianity---an American Calvinism,
which is enrolled and mobilized in the process of sacralizing and
rationalizing forms of preemptive war, thus producing a myth that
vindicates American forms of exceptionalist nationalism, and justifi es
steps taken in pursuit of world domination]{.underline}**. [This
particular species of American Calvinism]{.underline}, I will argue,
**[acts as a seedbed for this desire for dominance, arising out of a
metaphysical craving to mimic the mediator and become the divine sadist,
whose dominance American leaders both seek and suffer
from]{.underline}**. Girard writes in Deceit, Desire, and the Novel: We
know that [all victims of metaphysical desire seek to appropriate their
mediator's being by imitating him.]{.underline} [**The sadist wants to
persuade himself that he has already attained his goal; he tries to take
the place of the mediator and see the world through his eyes, in the
hope that the play will gradually turn into reality.** The sadist's
violence is yet another effort to attain divinity]{.underline}. (1961,
185) [The empirical evidence for this peculiar American DNA is
everywhere in plain sight]{.underline}. The Calvinist creed of the
obligation of rebelling against unjust Violence and the Sacred in
American Culture 83 tyranny is well documented in David Hackett
Fischer's Albion's Seed: Four British Folkways in America (1989).
Fischer paints a picture of the four primary folk cultures making up
American culture. Fischer never describes them as religious cultures per
se, but simply as "cultures"; and yet in each case, **[the heart of this
civilization is the sacralization of revenge, and a desire to overcome
past grievances---using the ferocity of the Calvinist God as a motive
force for moving forward and dominating one's rivals.]{.underline}**
Thus each culture in its own way uses theories of Reformed Calvinism to
fi ght against forms of real or felt tyranny: **[the
Puritans]{.underline}** resisting the British; the
**[Anglicans]{.underline}** holding down the Catholics; the
**[Quakers]{.underline}** struggling against almost everyone; and the
**[Scots-Irish]{.underline}** against anyone not ScotsIrish. Th is
latter group put it best: "**[The best enemy is a dead
enemy."]{.underline}** [Each group carries a strain of Calvinist
theology]{.underline} that promoted the fi ght against tyranny [and
yearned]{.underline}, in one form or another, [to dominate in the name
of this God.]{.underline} And this Calvinist God (the one orthodox
Calvinists worship and believe in) is indeed a ferocious and even
sadistic god. Conservative evangelical theologians themselves---i.e.,
those defending strict Puritanevangelical theologies---admit the
vengeful nature of this god. In fact, if they argue against it, they do
so precisely because this theology "impugns the good character of God"
(Olson 2011, 179). Roger Olson, speaking directly to the recent rise of
an American-based younger generation of New Calvinists, describes their
view of God as a picture in which God "ordains, designs, controls, and
renders certain the most egregious evil acts such as the kidnapping,
rape, and murder of a small child and genocidal slaughter of hundreds of
thousands in Rwanda" (178). Olson warns against this image of God, but
to no avail. For these "young, restless and Reformed Calvinists glory in
a God who takes no prisoners---quite literally---proudly proclaiming a
God that . . . only saves some when he could save all" (179). Many would
blanch at these images, but the core texts of Calvinism, at least in the
most extreme and unrevised versions, depict a sadistic---and
impenitently Old Testament---[God who arbitrarily commits acts of global
genocide, whether in time or beyond time]{.underline}. As Girard argues:
"[Divine punishment is demystified by the gospels; its only place
nowadays is in mythic imagination]{.underline}, to which modern
scepticism remains strangely attached" (1987 \[2003\]: 195). **[We are
curiously faithful in part because our primary metaphysical desire,
mimetically enhanced, is to]{.underline}** 84 Jon Pahl and James Wellman
**[sacralize our violence as a way of maintaining our dominance and as a
way of rationalizing the motive force of American
exceptionalism]{.underline}**. But more than that, [the god desired is a
god who is arbitrarily violent and who needs no justifi cation for his
violence.]{.underline} This god makes commands, chooses whom he wants,
destroys whom he wants, using whatever means are necessary to get what
he wants. **[Seen through this lens, a domestic or foreign policy that
imitates these kinds of arbitrary divine rigor makes absolute
sense]{.underline}**. Thus, forms of **[violence and torture are normal
and to be expected from such culturegenerated forms of mimesis: this is
the way of the god]{.underline}**. Early American fi gures in this form
of Calvinism give us quintessential and spectacular exemplars of the
movement. Th e eighteenth-century Reformed thinker and Calvinist
Jonathan Edwards, the revivalist minister who spearheaded the First
Great Awakening, who is oft en lauded as the greatest American
theologian, and who is a hero to many of the New Calvinists, oft en
chastised his fellow ministers that it was their duty to scare the hell
out of their people---literally.10 Edwards famously did this by
preaching "Sinners in the Hands of an Angry God," which literally
imagined a god who would dangle the sinner over the fi res of hell,
waiting for repentance from the sinner. In Edwards's classic Religious
Affections, he argued that even the devil can mimic the aff ections of
conversion, further putting his congregation in a state of terror about
that state of their salvation (Edwards 2009). How does one know if one
is saved? In fact, Edwards, as well as his fellow ministers, terrifi ed
their congregations to such an extent that suicides were reported across
the Northeast region---a man in Edwards's own congregation took his
life. Not long aft erwards, the revival plateaued, at least in part
because congregations had had enough of the manipulation. Edwards was
shortly thereaft er dismissed from his pulpit. We see in this example a
form of terror, a religious sadism, a way of coercing consent by
dangling the possibility of arbitrary violence from which one has only
one outlet---to give in to the same god who is simultaneously the source
of the threat. In his chapter "Masochism and Sadism," Girard, quite
intentionally, puts masochism as the fi rst term of the two. He argues
that the sadist "persecutes because he feels he is being persecuted." Th
e masochist becomes a sadist because he realizes "the key to the
enchanted garden appears to be in the hands of the tormentor" (1961,
185). Th e tormentor in this case is "Yahweh, the God of revenge," who
condemns whom he wishes and saves Violence and the Sacred in American
Culture 85 whomever he wants. This god legitimates an arbitrary form of
terror, which the sadist seeks to mirror and model, in part to overcome
his own fear and in part to express his sense of revenge. Th us, Girard
makes clear that these characters are neither essentially good nor evil,
but damaged persons, victims of their own metaphysical desire. He quotes
Dostoevsky: "Do not hate the atheists, the professors of evil, the
materialists, or even the wicked among them, for many are good,
especially in our time" (190). Moral illumination means understanding
the terror that haunts sadists, even in the midst of their persecution.
**[We are, then, identifying Calvinism as the bulwark religion of
America: a sadistic and sacrifi cial religion where one's success is a
marker of blessing and a providential promise of sacred acceptance.
American exceptionalism is legitimated through sacral and sacrifi cial
forms, and its arbitrary nature is hidden behind paeans raised to the
glory of its promise, and to all who bow to its power. Disciplined moral
action demands that one have victory; one must not be a victim, because
this is the mark of defeat, both morally and in respect of one's
salvation. Grace is limited in this system and thus it must be sought,
even though one can't earn it, and yet one's success is a sign of it, as
are the sobriety and iron will of those who follow the
creed]{.underline}**. The warp and woof of masochism and sadism keeps
many in its grip---another kind of Weberian "iron cage." [Preemptive
aggression is thus a natural extension of this creed---when in doubt,
act fi rst, ask for forgiveness later]{.underline}. Scots-Irish culture
simply takes the victor's right to an extreme, in an ethic of radical
freedom whereby [contests over scarce resources create an ecstasy of
battle]{.underline}---as illustrated by the violence in American
football and in military academies, and by the anger of Second Amendment
rights groups. Scott Appleby's "ecstatic asceticism" in which one's joy
is founded in solidarity with **[the power of the state, triumphant over
all enemies, is a further extension of this sacrificial
ethic]{.underline}** (Appleby 1999). [To sacrifice one's life for this
power sacralizes not only one's own life but the life of the nation.
Violence becomes a sacrament by which one wins glory for oneself, one's
family, and the state]{.underline}.11 **[This]{.underline}** ecstatic
asceticism **[reigns supreme in the ethic of the American
military]{.underline}**---deeply entrenched in the South and
Midwest---which carries on the legacy of their Scots-Irish heritage. The
Navy **[Seal 6 team]{.underline}** that **[was able to]{.underline}**
find and "**[take out"]{.underline}** Osama **[bin Laden code-named
their target "Geronimo]{.underline}**"---thus 86 Jon Pahl and James
Wellman **[rehearsing an early episode of American Indian scapegoating
involved in America's "winning" of the West.]{.underline}** Following
this murder (in its own way, a founding murder), scenes were shown of
various American military academies; cameras panned the literal dance of
ecstasy, in which soldiers chanted together, "u.s.a., u.s.a., u.s.a." Th
e fervency of this sacramental ritual was as powerful as any I have ever
witnessed. One might, once again, say: **[this is a kind of inverted
gospel---in which the one who comes in peace and in the name of the Lord
only arrives in and through the act of murder.]{.underline}** And, of
course, [the model is not]{.underline} the [Jesus]{.underline} of the
Sermon on the Mount or of the Cross, bu**[t rather the apocalyptic
Christ from the Book of Revelation, who comes on a white horse and
tramples his enemies underfoo]{.underline}**t. **[This god is then
interpreted as a Sovereign War God, a sadistic Master---and, of course,
one who can and should be imitated in the pulpit]{.underline}**, whether
**[in church or in the White House.]{.underline}** And, to be sure,
there are many masochists who love this god, who love this kind of
leadership, and who take pleasure in the demanding nature of this
gospel. Again, **[we see an inverted gospel of peace---a powerful
culture-construct (and cultureconstructing) god who motivates a
righteous and unrelenting violence, as effi cient as it is
arbitrary.]{.underline}**

### 2nc religion key

#### Sacrifice not social contract reframes how you understand the United States. The political order is not democratic process, but a source of meaning with religious resonances, meaning we need a new political theology that traces the origins and patterns of belief

**Kahn 12.** Paul W., Robert W. Winner Professor of Law and the
Humanities at Yale Law School. Political Theology Four New Chapters on
the Concept of Sovereignty. Columbia University Press. PUB DATE: May
2012

[For countless Americans, sovereignty remains the critical element of
their conception of the source and meaning of political
life.]{.underline} [The popular sovereign brought itself into being
through a violent act of self-creation:]{.underline} the Revolution.
[**The Constitution appears as a product of that sovereign actor, We the
People. The popular sovereign sustained itself through the Civil War,
and will continue to defend itself against enemies. The popular
sovereign is understood as a collective, transtemporal subject in which
all participate. It is the mystical corpus of the state, the source of
ultimate meaning for citizens.** The popular sovereign can always demand
a life; it can demand of citizens that they kill and be killed for the
state. **The fundamental character of the relationship of citizen to
sovereign is not contract---as in the social contract---but
sacrifice.**]{.underline} [To be a citizen is to imagine the possibility
of the sacrificial act.]{.underline} This is affirmed in the Pledge.
[The sacrificial moment appears as a kind of sacred violence: a force
that realizes a transcendent meaning.]{.underline}40 **[Liberal theory
simply misses the phenomenon of the political as it informs the life
practices and beliefs of ordinary Americans; it misses their
understanding of their relationship to national history and destiny.
Only the state, not the church, can demand sacrifice of the person in
the modern age.]{.underline}** The structure of sacrifice as a giving up
of the finite and taking on of the infinite remains just what it has
always been. **[We don't experience the political order as merely the
application of general laws arrived at through a democratic process. We
also experience it as a source of ultimate meanings and a potential
demand on life.]{.underline}** At that moment, we see the decision for
the exception, not the rule of law. Arguably, [we live at a moment when
this set of beliefs is becoming more, not less, prevalent]{.underline}.
[The symbolic message of the terrorist is that political identity in and
of itself is a matter of life and death. We can respond by appealing to
concepts of sovereignty and sacrifice because these beliefs are
available within the long history of Western practice.]{.underline}

**[Taking them up, we take up as well their religious
resonances.]{.underline}** These conceptual materials are deployed in
relationship to other concepts, that is, they are situated in new webs
of meanings. **[The concepts are democratized and historicized; they are
located in an historical narrative of colonial liberation and
self-government. American political order, moreover, must link
sovereignty to law, for whatever we believe about the sacrificial
demand, we are equally committed to the idea that ours is a nation under
law.]{.underline}** This combination of ideas puts immense strain on the
concept of the exception. **[To negotiate the relationship of law and
exception becomes not just a problem for law but a problem for our
understanding of ourselves in our relationship to the meaning of the
political]{.underline}**. There is no simple answer to this question.
[Liberal theory, however, fails even to see the problem.]{.underline}
Precisely here, [**we need a political theology that traces the
relationships--- genealogical and analogical---among our patterns of
belief.** Americans continue to maintain a set of beliefs not so
different from]{.underline} those that Schmitt cites from Tocqueville's
observations of [nineteenth-century America: "in democratic thought the
people hover about the entire political life of the state, just as God
does above the world, as the cause and the end of all things, as the
point from which everything emanates and to which everything
returns]{.underline}" (49). Schmitt thought the clock was running out on
these ideas: "It is true . . . that for some time the aftereffects of
the idea of God remained recognizable" (49). About this, he was either
too pessimistic or too optimistic. Political theology is not a normative
enterprise that can tell us in which direction the mistake lay, although
it can tell us that he was mistaken. **[The popular sovereign remains
the efficient and the final cause]{.underline}**---and I would say the
formal and material cause---**[of American political
identity]{.underline}**.41 **[A politics that is complete in itself,
that wants only to realize its own truth, touches on the
sacred]{.underline}**.

#### The influence of religion in Western politics makes the values that the 1AC is based off of, liberal values like freedom and democracy, ambiguous and meaningless

**Groys 09** (Boris Efimovich Groys is an art critic, media theorist,
and philosopher. He is currently a Global Distinguished Professor of
Russian and Slavic Studies at New York University and Senior Research
Fellow at the Karlsruhe University of Arts and Design in Karlsruhe,

The general consensus of the contemporary mass media is that the return
of [religion has emerged as the most important factor in global
politics]{.underline} and culture today. Now, those who currently refer
to a revival of religion clearly do not mean anything like the second
coming of the Messiah or the appearance of new gods and prophets. What
they are referring to rather is that [religious attitudes have moved
from culturally marginal zones into the mainstream]{.underline}. If this
is the case, and statistics would seem to corroborate the claim, the
question then arises as to what may have caused religious attitudes to
become mainstream. The survival and dissemination of opinions on the
global information market is regulated by a law formulated by Charles
Darwin, namely, the survival of the fittest. Those opinions that best
adapt to the conditions under which they are disseminated will, as a
matter of course, have the best odds of becoming mainstream. Today's
opinions market, however, is clearly characterized by reproduction,
repetition, and tautology. The widespread understanding of contemporary
civilization holds that, over the course of the modern age, theology has
been replaced by philosophy, an orientation toward the past by an
orientation toward the future, traditional teachings by subjective
evidence, fidelity to origins by innovation, and so on. In fact,
however, the m[odern age has not been the age in which the sacred has
been abolished but rather the age of its dissemination in profane space,
its democratization, its globalization.]{.underline} Ritual, repetition,
and reproduction were hitherto matters of religion; they were practiced
in isolated, sacred places. [In the modern age, ritual, repetition, and
reproduction have become the fate of the entire world, of the entire
culture. Everything reproduces itself---capital, commodities,
technology, and art. Ultimately, even progress is reproductive; it
consists in a constantly repeated destruction of everything that cannot
be reproduced quickly and effectively. Under such conditions it should
come as no surprise that religion---in all its various
manifestations---has become increasingly successful.]{.underline}
Religion operates through media channels that are, from the outset,
products of the extension and secularization of traditional religious
practices. Let us now turn to an investigation of some of the aspects of
this extension and secularization that seem especially relevant to the
survival and success of religions in the contemporary world. 1. The
Internet and the Freedom of Faith [The regime under which religion---any
religion---functions in contemporary Western secular democratic
societies is freedom of faith]{.underline}. Freedom of faith means that
[all are free to believe what they choose to believe and that all are
free to organize their personal and private lives according to these
beliefs]{.underline}. At the same time, however[, this also means that
the imposition of one's own faith on others in public life and state
institutions]{.underline}, including atheism as a form of faith, [cannot
be tolerated.]{.underline} The significance of the Enlightenment was not
so much that it resulted in the complete disappearance of religion, but
that religion became a matter of private choice, which then resulted in
the withdrawal of religion into the private sphere. In the contemporary
world, religion has become a matter of private taste, functioning in
much the same way as do art and design. Naturally, this is not to
suggest that religion is precluded in public discussion. However, the
place of religion in relation to public discussion is reminiscent of the
place of art as outlined by Immanuel Kant in The Critique of Judgment:
religion may be publicly discussed, but such a discussion cannot result
in any conclusion that would become obligatory, either for the
participants of this discussion or for society as a whole. Commitment to
one religious faith or another is a matter of sovereign, private choice
that cannot be dictated by any public authority---including any
democratically legitimized authority. Even more importantly, such a
decision---as in the case of art---need not be publicly argued and
legitimized, but rather publicly accepted without further discussion.
The [legitimacy of personal faith is based not on the degree of its
power of persuasion, but on the sovereign right of the individual to be
committed to this faith]{.underline}. [In this respect, freedom of faith
is fundamentally different from]{.underline}, let's say, the kind of
freedom represented in [scientific research]{.underline}. In the context
of a scientific discussion every opinion can be argued for or against,
but each opinion must also be substantiated by certain facts and
verified according to fixed rules. Every participant in such a
discussion is undoubtedly free---at least theoretically---to formulate
his or her position and to argue in its favor. However, one may not
insist on a scientific opinion that is not subject to justification, and
that would contravene all proof and evidence to the contrary, without
introducing any argument that would otherwise make one's position
plausible and persuasive to others. Such unyielding resistance to the
obvious, such blindness toward the facts, to logic and common sense,
would be regarded as bordering on the insane. [If someone were to refer
to his sovereign right to insist on a certain scientific opinion without
being able to legitimize this insistence by rational argument, he or she
would be excluded from the scientific community]{.underline}. What this
means is that our contemporary, [Western notion of freedom is deeply
ambiguous]{.underline}. In fact, [discourse on freedom always pivots on
two radical types of freedom: an unconditional freedom of faith, that
sovereign freedom permitting us to make personal choices beyond all
public explanation and justification, and the conditional, institutional
freedom of scientific opinion, which depends on the subject's ability to
justify and legitimize this opinion in accordance with pre-determined,
publicly established rules. Thus, it is easy to show that our notion of
democratic, free society is also ambiguous]{.underline}. The
contemporary notion of political freedom can be interpreted in part as
sovereign, in part as institutional: in part as the sovereign freedom of
political commitment, and in part as the institutional freedom of
political discussion. But whatever may be said about the contemporary
global political field in general, one thing remains certain: this field
is becoming increasingly influenced, or even defined, by the Internet as
the primary medium of global communication. And the Internet favors
private, unconditional, sovereign freedom over scientific, conditional,
institutional freedom.

relevant to the survival and success of religions in the contemporary
world.

### 2nc oikonomia

#### The aff is an instance of oikonomia -- a fiction of governmental control enshroud in the economy of the theological structure of the sovereign

**Agamben 9** (Giorgio Agamben, "WHAT IS AN APPARATUS?," PG 8-10, 2009)

Over the past three years, I have found myself in� creasingly involved
in an investigation that is only now beginning to come (0 its end, [one
that I can roughly define as a theological genealogy of
economy]{.underline}. In the first centuries of Church history-let\'s
say, between the second and sixth centuries c.E.-the Greek term
[oikonomia develops a decisive theological function]{.underline}. In
Greek, [oikonomia signifies the administration of the oikos (the home)
and, more general ly, management.]{.underline} We are deal ing here, as
Aristotle says (Politics 1155b21), not with an epistemic paradigm, but
[with a praxis, with a practical activity that must face a problem and a
particular situation each and every time.]{.underline} Why, then, did
the Fathers of the Church feel the need to introduce this term into
theological discourse? How did they come to speak about a \"divine
economy\"? What is at issue here, to be precise, is an extremely
delicate and vital problem, perhaps the decisive question in the history
of Christian theology: the Trinity. When the Fathers of the Church bega
n to argue during the second century about the threefold nature of the
divine figure (the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit), there was, as
one can imagine , [a powerful resistance from reasonable-minded people
in the Church who were horrified at the prospect of reintroducing
polytheism and paganism to the Christian faith]{.underline}. In order to
convince those stubborn adversaries (who were later called
\"monarchiam,\" that is, promoters of the government of a single God),
[theologians such as Tertullian, Irenaeus, Hippolytus, and many
others]{.underline} [could not find a better term to serve their need
than the Greek oikonomia.]{.underline} [Their argument went something
like this: \"God, insofar as his being and substance is concerned, is
certainly one; but as to his oikonomia-that is to say the way in which
he administers]{.underline} his home, his life, and the world that he
created-he is, rather, triple. [JUSt as a good father can entrust to his
son the execution of cenain functions and duties without in so doing
losing his power and his unity, so God entrusts to Christ the
\'economy,\' the administration a nd government of human
history]{.underline}.\" [Oikonomia therefore became a specialized term
signifying in particular the incarnation of the Son, together with the
economy of redemption and salvation]{.underline} (this is the reason why
in Gnostic sects, [Christ is called \"the man of economy,\"]{.underline}
ho anthropos tes oikonomias). The theologians slowly got accustomed to
distinguishing between a \"discourse-or logos-of theology\" and a
\"logos of economy.\" [Oikonomia became thereafter an apparatus through
which the Trinitarian dogma and the idea of a divine providential
governance of the world were introduced into the Christian
faith.]{.underline} But, as often happens, [the fracture that the
theologians had sought to avoid by removing it from the plane of God\'s
being, reappeared in the form of a caesura that separated in Him being
and action, ontology and praxis]{.underline}. [Action (economy, but also
politics) has no foundation in being: this is the schizophrenia that the
theological doct rine of oikonomia left as its legacy to Western
culture.]{.underline}

### 2nc myth key to empire 

#### Empire is sustained by mythic attitudes about war, rhetorical cyclings through victim rituals like the affs and the corresponding sacrifice of scapegoats. The cultural and political legitimacy of empire depends on an image of American democracy that is consumable and at the same time diminishes life and renders the polity entirely robotic. This ossification makes violence inevitable

**[American empire is sustained by the mythic incantations of rhetorical
rituals constituting an attitude of war.]{.underline}** [The discourse
of empire consists of dead metaphors that lend a sense of necessity and
inevitability to war by depicting it as rhythmical, timeless, migratory,
clean, and heroic]{.underline}. It is a persistent but declining
discourse. [**Its totalizing worldview resists critique, leaving it
politically moribund and exposed to transformation by tricksters.** The
geography of empire's dead metaphors is a petrified landscape in which
dreams of greatness come to rest in a soldier's grave]{.underline}.
**[Its capital city is a wasteland of illusions]{.underline}** that do
not fade. [The young and the old walk the streets without clear purpose
or star.]{.underline} [Guided by the logic of realism, a crowd of living
corpses greets the passage of a knight's skeleton, encased in armor,
riding a chestnut warhorse]{.underline}. **[Citizens cheer even after
losing all their children to the business of war]{.underline}**. A
bishop with staff and miter bows his head in adoration of old gods, the
prophet is slain in the monk's cold cell. Ancient, venerable buildings
are covered with thorns and brambles. As the prophet warned, they have
become a court for owls and a residence for dragons. [Such is the
moribund discourse of empire, **viewed from a mythic standpoint**. **It
is a discourse that encompasses the static vision of a death struggle
between civilization and savagery sustained by the mythic incantations
of rhetorical rituals that naturalize and rigidify an attitude of
war.**]{.underline} Like any orthodoxy, **[empire overreaches when
closed off to critique.]{.underline}** [The ruling order is rendered
insensible, unresponsive, and ultimately vulnerable to the dynamic
forces of pluralism and self-determination.]{.underline} **[Empire's
rhetorical inertia]{.underline}**, we suggest, prefigures a
nonconforming corrective. 1. [Imperial Orthodoxy Empire is a woolly
concept for a multifarious condition of political, economic, cultural,
and military hegemony. It designates a preponderance of power, a degree
of influence and authority comprising **a state of domination expressed
as a hierarchy of relations.**]{.underline} [It represents itself in
reified images as the natural order of things.]{.underline} [Its
reigning **symbols** are figures of speech made so routine and
conventional by everyday use that they sound flat, appear literal, turn
rigid, and lose their symbolic resonance.]{.underline}
**[Empire]{.underline}**, by this reckoning, **[is the rule of
politically enervated imagery, a regime of gestures no longer vital or
flexible enough to adapt to a dynamic world, an order maintained by
violence.]{.underline}** In view of the world militarization that both
preceded and followed World War II, George Orwell (1972, 433) warned
that [a debased language produced a "reduced state of consciousness,"
which was "favorable to political conformity."]{.underline} Three years
before the publication of 1984, he wrote: "[Orthodoxy, of whatever
color, seems to demand a lifeless, imitative style.]{.underline}"
Friedrich [Nietzsche]{.underline} (1999, 84-85) captured the essence of
metaphors-reduced-to-reified-concepts when he [defined truth as "a
movable host of metaphors, metonymies, and anthropomorphisms: in short,
a sum of human relations which have been poetically and rhetorically
intensifi ed, transferred, and embellished, and which, after long usage,
seem to a people to be fi xed, canonical, and binding."]{.underline}
Socalled **[truths]{.underline}**, he observed, "**[are metaphors that
have become worn out and have been drained of sensuous
force]{.underline}**." Concepts, and the logics they entail, are the
"residue of a metaphor." **[Imperial nations are prone to literalizing
metaphors into truths]{.underline}**. Vico's New Science, contra
Descartes, understood the cycle of cultural innovation and decline as a
process of insight followed by development leading to decay.
[Metaphor]{.underline}, in Vico's model, is the linguistic vehicle of
ingenium, the human faculty for seeing similarities among differences.
[As a creative act of knowledge, an exercise of imagination, it produces
fresh insights]{.underline}. [As a rhetorical act, it fi nds and draws
on images that function as topoi to invent arguments and build logics
into socio-cultural constructs that resist critique and demand
conformity in the name of truth]{.underline}. **[Society rigidifies and
crumbles as it loses touch with its mythic origins. It fails to
recognize that its concepts were founded on dynamic metaphors,
themselves myths in miniature, visions that evoke
narratives]{.underline}**. Understanding society as a cyclical process
of symbolic action brings into focus the relationship of rhetoric and
reality to myth and ritual. Kenneth Burke provocatively explains how
**[rhetoric cycles through the victimage ritual to sustain hierarchies
by sacrificing scapegoats. The governing order is ritually redeemed "by
blaming all its many troubles on the other."]{.underline}** Hence, the
imperial "Cult of the Kill" (Burke 1970, 5, 236). In the 19th century,
José Martí warned that [no empire is innocent of]{.underline} what Burke
(1969, 265) called [the "exaltation" of sacrificial human
offerings:]{.underline} \[Among [American Indians\]]{.underline} there
are [sacrifices of]{.underline} beautiful [young maidens]{.underline}
made to invisible gods in Heaven just as [in Greece]{.underline}, where
often [there were so many sacrifices that there was no need to build
altars]{.underline} for new ceremonies, [because]{.underline} the pile
of ashes of [the last burn was so high]{.underline} that the priests
could lay their sacrificial victims on them; there were human sacrifices
like the one by [Abraham]{.underline} the Hebrew, who tied
[Isaac]{.underline} over the wood pile to kill him with his own hands
because he thought he heard voices from Heaven which ordered him to
plunge his knife into his son, so that his blood would satiate his god;
there were [public sacrifices in the Plaza Mayor in Spain, in front of
bishops and kings]{.underline}, when [the Inquisition burned men
alive]{.underline}, with pomp and circumstance, while the Madrid ladies
observed the burning from their balconies. Ignorance and superstition
turn human beings into barbarians in all nations. And [about the
Indians]{.underline} more than is just has been said about these things
by [the victorious Spaniards]{.underline}, who [exaggerated and invented
the defects of the defeated race, so that their own cruelty would appear
just and convenient to the world.]{.underline} (Martí 1995, 116. Trans
Oscar Giner) Mark Twain (1992, 479) once lamented that a handful of
Missouri lynchers had "given us a character and labeled us with a name,"
making [the U.S. known globally as the "United States of
Lyncherdom]{.underline}." 2. [Empire's Resistance to]{.underline}
Critique Comic [correctives]{.underline}, in Kenneth Burke's (1984,
166-75; 1969, 19-23) sense of the term, [are required to deflect the
tragic trajectory of victimage]{.underline}, to bridge the human divide,
and t[o reduce the imperial impulse to dominate and kill**. Empire is
devoid of a comic perspective. Acknowledging and retrieving dead
metaphors would be destabilizing.**]{.underline} **[Instead, the
cultural and political legitimacy of American empire rests precariously
on a lifeless image of democracy. It exists in a state of symbolic
denial]{.underline}**. **[All that remains of democracy in the imperial
image is an empty gesture, a simulacrum, a trace of collective
self-governance]{.underline}**. In 1922, H.L. Mencken (2010, 303-304,
333) asked himself the question "Why am I still here?" after American
artists and intellectuals had departed---and called others to
depart---U.S. shores for "fairer lands" in Europe. Mencken's essay[, "On
Being an American]{.underline}," stands as an engaging critique of
American exceptionalism: Here, more than anywhere else that I know of or
have heard of, [the daily panorama of human existence, of private and
communal folly---the unending procession of governmental extortions and
chicaneries, of commercial brigandages and throat-slittings, of
theological buffooneries, of aesthetic ribaldries, of legal swindles and
harlotries, of miscellaneous rogueries, villainies, imbecilities,
grotesqueries, and extravagances---is so inordinately gross and
preposterous,]{.underline} so perfectly brought up to the highest
conceivable amperage, so steadily enriched with an almost fabulous
daring and originality, that only the man who was born with a petrified
diaphragm can fail to laugh himself to sleep every night, and to awake
every morning with all the eager, unflagging expectation of a
Sunday-school superintendent touring the Paris peep shows. Almost a
century later, one might conclude that [the glaring flaws of the
nation's political system are not a particular idiosyncrasy, but rather
a central element of North American culture]{.underline}. "[Here in the
very citadel of democracy,]{.underline}" Mencken writes, "[we found and
cherish a clown dynasty!]{.underline}" Mencken's (2010, 303-304, 333)
characterization is the product of the vision of a trickster prophet.
Like Babylon, [the Republic has "glorified herself]{.underline}," and
her citizens---[plagued by the worms of belief in a manifest
destiny]{.underline}---have become biblical scribes and Pharisees:
"whited sepulchres," beautiful outside, but "within full of dead men's
bones, and of all uncleanness" (Holy Bible 1984, Revelation 18:7;
Matthew 23:27). In the entrails of empire, overrun by the weight of dead
metaphors, trickster's howl is not heard and trickster's humor is
ignored. Prophets are killed, scourged or crucifi ed only when they
threaten empires. **[Imperial rule is lethal, but it is also
rhetorically moribund]{.underline}**. [A worn regime of exclusion,
surveillance, and coercion displaces the spirited politics of inclusion
and contestation]{.underline}. **[Canonical images operate in the war
state just below the threshold of critical reflection]{.underline}**.
[They goad the public to defend the citadel of democracy and to smite
projected demons]{.underline}. **[The act of demonizing adversaries
denatures peacemaking and naturalizes warfare.]{.underline}** [Depicting
war as rhythmical, timeless, migratory, clean, and heroic lends it a
sense of necessity and inevitability]{.underline}. A vast landscape of
**[habituated imagery diminishes political life, reduces political
discourse to mythic incantations of war propaganda, and renders polity
robotic like drone warfare.]{.underline}** [The Roman Empire has served
as a constant model for the imperial aspirations of a young U.S. nation,
complete with restrained but unresolved tensions between the quest for
greatness and a call for justice]{.underline}. The story of Spartacus,
"founded on that passage of Roman history where the slaves---Gallic,
Spanish, Thracian and African---rose against their masters, and formed
themselves into a military organization," proved meaningful to the
American cultural imaginary in the 19th century. The first American-born
tragedian Edwin Forrest (1806-1872) won national renown in the role of
Spartacus in Robert Montgomery Bird's (1806-1854) The Gladiator. Walt
Whitman (1952, 544-45) witnessed a performance of the play in 1846:
"From footlights to lobby doors---from fl oor to dome---were packed
crowds of people last night at the Park Theatre, New York, to see Mr.
Forrest in The Gladiator." Whitman admired Forrest's delivery of the
speech of Spartacus "in which he attributes the grandeur and the wealth
of Rome, to her devastation of other countries." In chains, Spartacus
speaks when he sees the palaces of Rome for the first time: If Romans
had not been fi ends, Rome had never been great! Whence came this
greatness, but from the miseries of subjugated nations? How many myriads
of happy people ... were slain like beasts of the fi eld, that Rome
might fatten upon their blood, and become great?\...There is not a
palace upon these hills that cost not the lives of a thousand innocent
men; there is no deed of greatness ye can boast, but it was achieved
upon the ruin of a nation; there is no joy you can feel, but its
ingredients are blood and tears. (Bird 1997, 179-80) In 1960, just
before the John F. Kennedy administration assumed power heralding a "New
Frontier," Stanley Kubrick's film Spartacus premiered in Hollywood. The
screenplay was written by Dalton Trumbo, based on the novel by Howard
Fast (1960). Both writers had been imprisoned and blacklisted in
Hollywood during the national persecution of fi lm artists and producers
with past communist associations. In the fi lm (produced by Kirk
Douglas' Bryna Productions), the Roman patrician Crassus (Laurence
Olivier) shows his young slave Antoninus (Tony Curtis) a panoramic view
of Rome from his villa. Roman cohorts march in the distance en route to
quell Spartacus' slave rebellion. Crassus describes the fabled city in
the distance, and the empire for which it stands: [The might, the
majesty, the terror of Rome....There is the power that bestrides the
known world, like a colossus. No nation can withstand Rome. No man can
withstand her....You must serve her. You must abase yourself before her.
You must grovel at her feet. You must love her.]{.underline} [The
American Legion sent a letter to "17,000 local posts" warning them to
NOT SEE Spartacus]{.underline}. One influential columnist wrote: "The
story was sold ... from a book written by a Commie and the screen script
was written by a Commie, so don't go see it." But JFK---with a more
perceptive understanding of mythic evocations---"sneaked out of the
White House in the middle of a snowstorm one night, to go see Spartacus
at the Warner Theater" (Douglas 1988, 294, 305).

### 2nc university k

#### Framework is a politics of description \-\-- try or die for using the debate space to theorize and positively interpret alternative ontological frames 

**Curtis 13** \[Neal, Senior Lecturer in the Department of Film,
Television and Media Studies at the University of Auckland, "Thought
Bubble: Neoliberalism and the Politics of Knowledge," *new formations: a
journal of culture/theory/politics*, Volume 80-81, 2013, Project MUSE\]

Thought Bubble

The Ernst & Young report quotes one anonymous university Vice-Chancellor
declaring: 'Our major competitor in ten years time will be Google ... if
we're still alive!' This quote supposedly encapsulates changes to our
relation to knowledge indicative of the two drivers of change which the
report calls 'digital technologies' and 'democratization'. The reason
why these two are related is because the report understands
democratisation simply in terms of 'access' and then assumes the flawed
syllogism whereby because digital technologies make knowledge accessible
and democracy is about access, therefore all digital technologies are
democratic. It would be foolish to suggest that a report citing 'the
Darwinian force of the market'33 could countenance the idea that
democracy ought to be measured by something other than consumer-style
access, but access in and of itself is not inherently democratic. Much
like 'excellence' it requires secondary criteria to become a meaningful
concept. Admittedly the report does avoid the positivist trap that users
of Google can easily fall into, of assuming that knowledge is simply
'out there', such that its acquisition is merely a matter of data
retrieval. The author of the report does link knowledge to analysis and
interpretation, but [given that we are asked to bend our knee to
'the]{.underline} [Darwinian force of the market', one suspects that
analysis and interpretation is of a kind with]{.underline} [that found
in the pages of the Financial Times and **will be limited to debates
over best policy within a given system**, **rather than any ontological
engagement with the character and shape of the world
itself**]{.underline}.

The Google model is, however, exemplary of the problem faced by the
post-historical university and the nature of its democratic role.
Leaving aside the rather obvious point that in the pursuit of profit
Google have quite happily aided the Chinese government in their
restriction of the democracy movement in that country, the Google model
is significant because its success is based on successfully attending to
and facilitating the personalisation that has come to define both
democracy and knowledge in neoliberal consumer cultures. Google's
success has primarily come from its ability to provide a highly
individualised service, partly due to the capacity of its search engine
to learn what the user likes and to display results that are closely
aligned to preferences indicated through earlier 'click signals'; but
this has also been a path to monetisation as the company is able to
claim that it can deliver customers to companies with impressive
precision. In an economy increasingly based on information, attention
becomes a very rare commodity,34 so the ability to deliver attention to
advertisers becomes a highly profitable capability. The capacity for
Google to archive click signals affords increasingly successful searches
without additional work from the user and provides a profile that
companies can attach themselves to in their search for consumers. \[End
Page 84\]

[While this mode of information retrieval sits well with all the
neoliberal markers of value]{.underline} - [individuality, preference,
choice, competition, immediacy - it gives rise to significant
concerns]{.underline} [for both knowledge and democracy that must not be
ignored]{.underline}. In a fascinating book entitled The Filter Bubble,
Eli Pariser sets out the implications of the Google algorithm.
Initially, while the idea that what is best for one person may not be
best for someone else is hardly revolutionary, the idea that a search
engine is 'biased to share our own views'35 has far-reaching
consequences. In short, 'your computer monitor is a kind of one-way
mirror, reflecting your own interests while algorithmic observers watch
what you click' (Filter Bubble, p3). Here, access is instant and
individualised, but Pariser is concerned that where 'democracy requires
a reliance on shared facts \[...\] we're being offered parallel but
separate universes' (Filter Bubble, p5). While it is important to argue
that "facts" are not enough, shared or not, the problem is accentuated
because the search engine, which is now a 'prediction engine' (Filter
Bubble, p9), has a tendency to search out 'facts' you have already
indicated a preference for through click signals. Ultimately the cookies
and bots that aid personalised web-browsing begin to produce a filter
bubble: 'a unique universe of information for each of us', but more
importantly one that 'fundamentally alters the way we encounter ideas
and information' (Filter Bubble, p9). In other words, the Google model
is one in which we continually receive more of what we already know and
have indicated a preference for. Ultimately, the filter bubble is 'a
cozy place, populated by our favourite people and things and ideas'
(Filter Bubble, p12).

Pariser notes that while this personalisation flatters users who believe
they are in a position of control because the prediction engine appears
to be giving them what they want, it increasingly subjects users 'to a
kind of informational determinism in which what you clicked on in the
past determines what you see next' (Filter Bubble, p16). This mode of
personalised access means that Google does have great significance for
the post-historical university, but that significance does not lie in
the claim that Google University is the future as Ernst & Young would
have us believe. Rather, the Google model is significant because the two
forces of impact and customer service suggest that **[the
post-historical university will increasingly take on the character of a
filter bubble]{.underline}**. [As research is increasingly directed
towards what are described to be the needs of the]{.underline} [current
system, and teaching is tailored to satisfying the existing desires and
preferences of]{.underline} [students refigured as
customers]{.underline}, the university's role in the global knowledge
economy will be to offer more of the same. [The university has always
had a major role to play in maintaining the cultural status quo and
policing knowledge, but it has also historically been a major site for
the social production of dissensus which is irreducible to the
promotional language of 'innovation']{.underline} and
'entrepreneurialism' (or any historical equivalent thereof). Ultimately
the sole purpose of the Ernst & Young report is to ensure that the
university of the future plays an integral part in the production of an
'identity loop' (Filter Bubble, p127), or what we might call a thought
bubble that reproduces the truth of market logic.

[In the face of this doctrinal onslaught the future of the university as
a social institution looks bleak, but]{.underline} despite the
heavy-handed ideological work that the Ernst & Young report epitomises,
[the future cannot be closed off in the way they hope]{.underline}. As
was noted in the introduction, the rationality of markets was shown to
be a pseudo-science by the persistence and the effects of what Besley
and Hennessey called the 'psychology of herding'. First of all this
produced the hysterical delusion that the business cycle had been
overcome, which was then counteracted by the global loss of confidence
that brought about the greatest economic crisis in living memory. \[End
Page 85\] The evident role played by these 'animal spirits' testifies to
the importance of a non-theoretical, non-rational relation to the world,
but also to a more profound ontological state of mind that Heidegger
refers to as 'attunement' or 'mood'.36 Ordinarily that attunement is an
unremarkable and comfortable familiarity, but one that might become a
concerted defence in times of crisis. Fluctuations in mood are usually
accompanied by stories that tell us something about the world we live
in. With regards to the world of economics these are stories that
precipitate trust, confidence, euphoria, frenzy, fear, and anxiety.37
These spirits and the stories that shape them are evidence of the
continuing hermeneutic condition set out above. [Stories make a world of
sense, but they are only ever interpretations and remain subject to the
vagaries of moo]{.underline}d.

[The narrative of neoliberal post-history can claim to be the rightful
representation of human relations only because it is underwritten by
gigantic economic, political and social power that]{.underline}
[supports and distributes its stories, not because it has discovered the
truth]{.underline}. In such an environment, [**academics regularly
articulate concern about the utilitarian** if not **instrumental mood,
of managers and students alike**]{.underline}. While the discourses of
impact and customer service further support such instrumentality and
suggest that the university of the future will increasingly help lock
down the narrative of post-history, **[there is still
hope]{.underline}**. In keeping with Heidegger's (in)famous use of
Hölderlin's words: 'But where danger is, grows/The saving power also',38
the pressures on students to achieve a certain GPA or class of degree
and the demands on them to be socially compliant, still does not
eradicate their sense that **[the world is contestable]{.underline}**.
In many cases the mood of [students]{.underline} remains one of
scepticism and doubt towards the supposed common sense, coupled with a
desire for change. They [remain interested in the big questions and
readily support courses that make great theoretical demands on
them.]{.underline} Students tend to be of an age when the sedimented
world they have inherited has not yet ossified and all kinds of
malformations and reformations remain possible. This means that [an
important role can still be played by the university; not one that is
reduced to increasing access to what is already given, but one that
**opens up spaces for this contestation and challenging of the world,
for offering up radically alternative ways of living and
being-with-others**]{.underline}.

As was noted in the introduction, the [humanities have an especially
important role to play in this regard. While traditional humanities
disciplines]{.underline} such as philosophy, English, and history [have
all supported social and political conservatism through]{.underline},
amongst other things, [the defence of a canon, these disciplines have
also been traditionally concerned with that **gap between the meaningful
and meaninglessness that defines the human condition**]{.underline}.
Whether a philosophical treatise, a work of literature, or the recovery
of a counter-history[, work in the humanities has always occupied that
space where the **meaningful totality we call our world suffers a
variety of disruptions and is revealed to be inadequate**]{.underline}.
**[The humanities are never more alive than when faced with the loss of
an established truth and the slipping away of the world]{.underline}**.
[Some of the greatest works in the humanities are riddled with
anxiety]{.underline}. [It therefore falls on the humanities in a time of
crisis to enable anxiety to work in the name of alternative visions,
which is precisely why the humanities are under such strident attack
within the marketised model. This is also a role that ought to be taken
beyond the campus to form the beginnings of a new contract with a public
that has just bailed out private speculators at the expense of public
welfare]{.underline}. Turning away from the anxiety generated by the
crisis will only encourage more of the same. [**The public role of the
university should be to ensure this anxiety**, **understood as the
re-emergence of the questioning that neoliberal post-history continually
seeks to suppress, is turned to creative use**]{.underline}.

### At: policy analysis key

#### Wrong -- religious fervor overdetemrines their ability to do policy analysis, means they produce the passive nihilism of the mob

**Diken 11.** Bulent Diken, professor of sociology at Lancaster
University (UK), Militarization as a Comedy of T(errors), Economía
Autónoma. Vol. IV. No. 7. Enero -- junio 2011: 7

[In the primordial scene]{.underline}, which [Girard]{.underline} (1986)
[has described]{.underline}, **[the society is constituted on the basis
of the lynching mob]{.underline}**, [whose mimetic desire, whose envy
and egoism, culminates in **sacrificing the scapegoat**]{.underline}.
[With terror]{.underline}, though, **[we confront the opposite situation
in which the mimetic desire does not establish but rather destroys the
'society]{.underline}**.' Here **[everybody, and not only the scapegoat,
is threatened with destruction]{.underline}**. [This paradoxical subject
is]{.underline} Nietzsche's **[radical (or 'suicidal')
nihilist]{.underline}**. Hence **[Nietzsche's definition: 'a nihilist is
a man who judges of the world as it is that it ought not to
be']{.underline}**. [If the supreme values cannot find a place in this
world one can just as well destroy it]{.underline}. Thus, **[the radical
nihilist wills the total collapse of the socio-symbolic
order]{.underline}**. However, the point is that spite or 'radical
nihilism' has a shared genealogy with other forms of nihilism. Hence
Nietzsche's full definition of a nihilist reads like this: **['A
nihilist is a man who judges of the world as it is that it ought not to
be, and of the world as it ought to be that it does not
exist]{.underline}**' (Nietzsche 1967: 318). [If supreme values are
themselves devalued while, at the same time, this world is preserved, we
encounter the situation described by the second part of the definition:
**passive nihilism, or, a 'world without values'**]{.underline} (Deleuze
1983: 148). If, on the other hand, one, despite realizing that one's
values are not realizable, still desperately clings to them, we confront
the situation of the radical nihilist: values without a world.

Thought in this way, the relationship between radical nihilism and
passive nihilism constitutes a disjunctive synthesis. And today this
'synthesis' repeats itself in the tension, or rather false antagonism,
between post-politics and terrorism. [The passive nihilism of post-
politics expresses itself as an inability to think of the antagonistic
element in politics; hence the emptying out of its constitutive
dimension, 'the political]{.underline}.' However, [this blindness is
itself constitutive]{.underline}; **[it is what constitutes
post-politics as a form of politics]{.underline}**, [a politics in which
already recognized groups negotiate interests without challenging the
existing hegemonic relations]{.underline}. **[Politics as game playing
without the possibility of changing the game, as a form of
hyper-politics]{.underline}**. **[Passive nihilism of post-politics
consists in an impossibility of putting a distance to the actual
reality]{.underline}**, **[in the impossibility of sublimation in the
sense of sustaining the gap between the actual and the
virtual]{.underline}**, **[reality and the Real]{.underline}**, **[by
maintaining a space for objects considered 'impossible,' by giving
'value to what the reality principle does not value]{.underline}**'
(Zupančič 2003: 78). And [when the virtual collapses into the actual,
**politics disappears, the radical questioning of the social becomes
impossible**]{.underline}. Insofar as [politics involves 'the ongoing
critique of reality']{.underline} (Bauman 2002: 56), **[post-politics
signifies the foreclosure of politics]{.underline}**. In this sense,
[post-politics brings with it an internal perversion of democracy, a
'post-democratic' politics that eliminates real dispute by assuming that
everyone is already included in politics and that remaining **problems
can be dealt with through expert systems**]{.underline} (Rancière 1999:
116). [Despite its hegemony]{.underline}, however, [the lack, or rather
the suppression, of antagonism **does not make post-politics a peaceful
order**]{.underline}. [Post- politics brings with it a **paradoxical
violence**]{.underline}, [the violence of a society bent on
**neutralizing dissent**]{.underline}, **[rooting out all
radicalism]{.underline}**, [negativity and singularity]{.underline}, [a
violence that puts an end to the idea of violence as such and therefore
**can only be met by hatred**]{.underline} (Baudrillard 2002: 92- 3).

[a violence cut off from its object and turning back **against that
object itself**]{.underline} -- [against the political and the
social]{.underline}. [It's no longer anarchistic or revolutionary\...
It's not interested in the system's internal contradictions; it targets
the very principal of the social and the political. \[\...\] It answers
the systemic exclusion our society practices by even more exclusion,
cutting itself off from the social world by indifference or
hatred]{.underline}. (Baudrillard 1998: 66)

Just as previous forms of violence mirrored the level of conflict,
hatred mirrors the level of post-political consensus (Baudrillard 2002:
92). [As if the culture of passive nihilism, its zeal for security,
leads to the loss of immunity; like redundant 'anti-bodies' that turn
against the organism in which they live, hatred 'has something of
self-aggression and auto-immune pathology about it']{.underline} (Ibid.
93.). Hatred is today's radical nihilist 'fatal strategy' against
passive nihilism. **[So, the lack of antagonism in post-politics is
countered with an excess of antagonism, a (self)destructive will to
nothingness]{.underline}**. Thus, **[today's ideological arena looks
like a battle ground between un-antagonistic politics and
ultra-antagonistic fundamentalism]{.underline}**:
**[terrorism]{.underline}**. As if when politics is depoliticized, spite
is politicized.

So, it seems, **[ours is a 'one-dimensional society']{.underline}** in
which [the distinctions have disappeared]{.underline}, [the opposites
are united in a nihilistic disjunctive 'synthesis]{.underline}.' [The
threat is]{.underline}, therefore, **[Janus-faced]{.underline}**.
Cont[emporary terror and the war against terror both are part and parcel
of the movement from politics to post-politics]{.underline}. And [it is
in this movement, which is also the movement of nihilism, that
distinctions such as reality/representation, biology/politics,
terror/war against terror tend to disappear today]{.underline}. After
all, **[the 'cancelling out of differences' is a nihilistic principle
par excellence]{.underline}** (Deleuze 1983: 46). **[The power of
nihilism is a power that pours everything into
indifference]{.underline}** (see Baudrillard 1994: 159, 163).

[Bin Laden's terrorism has so far forced the Western democracy to
'betray itself' but this did not]{.underline}, as Ulrike Meinhof
envisaged, '[make the masses rise' and 'allow contradictions to
escalate]{.underline}' (Meinhof p. 279). [Why]{.underline}? **[The
answer is post-politics]{.underline}**, wh**[ich cancels out
differences, upon which politics is based: an obscene system in which
dialectical polarity no longer exists, a simulacrum, where acts
disappear without consequences in indifferent 'zero-sum
signs']{.underline}** (Baudrillard 1994: 16, 32). [Contemporary terror
is post-political in the sense that it is a product of indifferent
forces rather than political antagonisms]{.underline}. **[It is
'viral']{.underline}**: [it emanates in the form of metastasis, bringing
with it transparency (disappearance), a flattening process characterized
by the exacerbation of indifference and the indefinite mutation of
social domains]{.underline} (Baudrillard 1990: 7, 50).

Hence [the obscene indistinction between terror and the war against
terror]{.underline}, [which]{.underline}, for all their enmity against
each other, **[resemble twins]{.underline}**: [they share the same logic
on the basis of contradiction and disparity,]{.underline}
[simultaneously expressing convergence and divergence]{.underline},
**[similarity and difference]{.underline}**, [without]{.underline}, of
course, [perfect identity]{.underline}. **[Both depict a world of

## IMPACT

### Christian Zionism

#### American foreign policy is shaped by religion that shapes US arms sales relations, interventionism, and justifications for those interventions. The affirmative is rooted in a holy responsibility to further the liberal world order for Christ, while fighting against the antichrist in Russia and Iraq -- apocalyptic extinction scenarios are contrived for the purpose of white Christian supremacy

Some of the most important theological streams that have shaped the
vision and goals of the RR are Christian Nationalism and Christian
Zionism93. While the second one is most visible in the foreign policy
approach, the first one shapes both, domestic political views (what is
commonly known) as well as elements of the foreign policy vision.
Christian Nationalism incorporates concepts of theocracy known as
Dominion Theology and Reconstructionism94. Dominion Theology stresses
the verses from the first chapter of the Book of Genesis (1:26-28), in
which God gives humanity dominion over His creation (including natural
resources provided by God for the human race). As Marsden points out,
instead of interpreting these verses as an imperative for humanity to be
a good steward of the Earth, [dominionists use it to insist on Christian
domination of the political and economic system]{.underline}. According
to their view, [only Christians are capable of governing according to
God's will, and therefore non-Christians should be excluded from the
political processes]{.underline}. Reconstructionists also emphasize the
necessity for Christians to 'subdue' and 'exercise dominion' over the
earth. What is more, according to their view, [the US and the whole
world can be rescued from disaster not only by having Christians
controlling government but also by applying the Old Testament
law]{.underline}95. Dominionist and Reconstructionist thinking has
efficacy in foreign policy because it [considers Christian governance
necessary for a fallen world, and postulates seeking Christian dominion
not only over America (which should become theocratic) but also over the
whole world. According to this view, it is a holy responsibility to
reclaim the land for Christ, to start a conquest of the world for the
Gospel]{.underline} (in accordance with what God commissioned Christians
for)96. Most of the researchers interested in the RR's foreign policy
goals, including Lee Marsden, stress however that the Christian Zionist
approach is much more influential in this area97. Most generally,
Christian Zionism is a belief that the return of the Jews to the Holy
Land, and the establishment of the State of Israel in 1948, is in
accordance with Biblical Prophecy. [Christian Zionists believe that the
state of Israel is a fundamental part of God's plan and it is essential
for it to survive and thrive. Therefore, it should be granted an
unconditional support from the USA]{.underline}. As Jerry Falwell put it
in 1978: "I believe that if we fail to protect Israel we will cease to
be important to God . . . we can and must be involved in guiding America
towards a biblical position regarding her stand on Israel"98. Yet, it is
important to note that Christian Zionism was not "invented" by the RR.
As Samuel Goldman argues, "[Christian Zionism is an older feature of
American culture than most citizens and even some scholars recognize.
Its sources stretch back to the English Reformation---and, in some ways,
to the early church]{.underline}"99. He adds that there were Christian
Zionists in the USA even before Theodor Herzl founded the formal Zionist
movement. However, the term was introduced into the public debate around
1980 -- after the founding of International Christian Embassy whose
members protested Western governments refusal to recognize Jerusalem as
Israel's capital100. And although originally it was not the main area of
concern for Moral Majority, Jerry Falwell soon incorporated the idea in
order to integrate religious conservatives interested in the prophecy
literature. In the end "\[i\]t became a characteristic feature of 'the
new Christian Right' that helped define the Reagan era"101. Usually
scholars distinguish two common approaches by which [Christian Zionists
justify their unconditional support]{.underline} for Israel. One of them
is the belief based on the words found in the Book of Genesis 12:3, "I
will bless those who bless you, whoever curses you I will curse; and all
peoples on earth will be blessed through you"102. The second approach is
[based on dispensationalist theology, which \...presents literal and
predictive approach to the Bible and teaches that we are living in the
end-times.]{.underline} I will focus on the latter one, since it is most
popular among American conservative Evangelicals103. The theological
system called "premillennial dispensationalism" emerged during the early
19th century in England. It was developed by Edward Irving and an Irish
clergyman and John Nelson Darby who came to America from Plymouth,
England. It gained popularity among American Protestant fundamentalists
through the notes of the Scofield Reference Bible104. Pre-millennialism
is the belief that Christ will literally reign on the earth for 1,000
years at his Second Coming. His return, defeat of Antichrist and
establishment of the millennial kingdom is expected soon due to the weak
nature of man105. Darby added some unique features to
pre-millennialism106: he emphasized such teachings as "the rapture"107,
he focused on the rise of the Antichrist, the Battle of Armageddon and
the central role that a revived nation-state of Israel would play during
the latter days. He claimed that an actual Jewish state called Israel
would become the central instrument for God to fulfill His plans. What
is important, he came to believe that the Old Testament refers only to
the Jews, not to the Christians108. He thus saw a clear distinction
between Israel and the "church" and stressed that during the millennial
kingdom God would fulfill all His unconditional promises with Israel109
. Additionally, Darby divided biblical history into a number of
successive economies or administrations, called dispensations110.
According to this theology, the last dispensation of a literal, earthly
1000-year Millenial Kingdom is very near. The [signs that indicate "the
end of times" are such facts as the establishment of the state of Israel
and buildup of armies of the countries that are Israel's
foe]{.underline}s. What is even more important, during the Great
Tribulation111, as dispensationalists believe, 144,000 Jews will convert
to Christianity112. This conversion will reveal to them the true
intentions of the Antichrist and they will bring Christian faith to all
non-believers who were not "raptured". Additionally, the converted Jews
will meet the Antichrist for the final battle known as Armageddon and
they will defeat him. After this battle Jesus will return and to defeat
Satan and establish His Kingdom113. The [logical outcome of these
beliefs is, of course, a very protective attitude toward the modern
State of Israe]{.underline}l. It is, however, important to remember
that, despite the unconditional support for the State of Israel,
Christian Zionism, does not necessarily entail sympathy for the Jews as
a nation or for Judaism as a religion. Main representatives of Christian
Zionism in the USA, such as Hal Lindsay or Pat Robertson have been known
for their anti-Semitic remarks114. All in all, for the prophecy to be
fulfilled a significant number of Jews must accept Jesus as their
Messiah. The [above described theological ideas, while being interpreted
and adapted to particular historical and geo-political events, have
shaped]{.underline} the RR's [foreign policy]{.underline} goals since
the movement's creation in the 1970s. Religious Right's Foreign Policy
Aims The [outcome of these ideas is a very specific attitude towards the
U.S. foreign policy]{.underline}. For example, dominionism together with
the idea that assumes the [perception of the US as the chosen
nation]{.underline} (which will reclaim the world for Christ), or even
as 'an armed hand of God' [that will fight the forces of Evil around the
world,]{.underline} is the core reason for postulating strong national
defense. However, although [strengthening the national defense against
the forces perceived as being associated with Evil seems to have been an
unchanged element of the RR's foreign policy goals, the personification
of Evil - due to the changing international context - has been shifting
in time]{.underline}. In the course of history the
'[Antichrist']{.underline} was associated with the [Soviet
Union]{.underline}115, international organizations (EU, UN),
[Iraq]{.underline} [and other Arab states or Islam]{.underline}116.
Christian Zionism, another idea shaping the RR's attitude toward U.S.
foreign policy has certainly resulted in a strong support for Israel
(both military and political). This includes [promoting Israeli
settlements, recognizing Jerusalem as the (undivided) capital of Israel
or opposing any UN initiatives in favor of Palestinians]{.underline}.
Lienesch stresses that there is no doubt that such goals are an output
of the "millennial mentalities" and premillenial view of the world117.
However, it is important to remember that at the beginning or its
existence, the RR supported Israel rather because it was considered a
defender against communism (then regarded as a major threat to
Christianity) in the Middle East118. It was only after Jerry Falwell
included Christian Zionism into the RR's rhetoric that this narration
became the most important one in regard to Israel119. [Another outcome
of the belief in a special role of America in the world as well as of
the dispensationalist theology is the rejection of multilateralism in
international relations as hindering the righteous actions of the
USA]{.underline}. According to very specific dispensationalist reading
of the [Biblical prophecy concerning the period just before the Second
Coming of Jesus, unilateralism is absolutely justified]{.underline}. The
reason for that is a strong belief that [unification is the way of the
Beast to gain control over the world. In this vision Antichrist will
lead a one-world government]{.underline}, trying to create the "New
World Order". In Hal Lindsay's book "The Great Planet Earth" it was the
European Economic Community (EEC) that represented the 10-headed beast
referred to in the Book of Revelation. Tim LaHaye and Jerry Jenkins, on
the other hand, recognized the 10-headed beast in the United Nations and
popularized this view in the "Left Behind" series120. They still argue
that UN's restraint on U.S. unilateral actions and its \...support of
the rights of the Palestinians prove their vision to be correct.
According to them, the UN's promotion of what is seen as liberal agenda
(at odds with the Biblical order), e.g.: protecting the rights of women,
gay and other sexual minority people or distributing condoms (to fight
AIDS) additionally adds to their argument. Dominion theology, while
stressing the role of Christians in the world, provides additional
arguments against the UN. According to dominionist beliefs, it is
unacceptable to treat all religions equally. The UN does, so it must be
a part of conspiracy against true Christians121. For the RR it
represents the modern Babel Tower. Therefore, the UN and all its
agencies are regarded as not trustworthy and any cooperation with them
is considered a corruption of Biblical beliefs. What is more, the
dominionist conviction that human beings were given control over the
earth and nature by God makes it impossible to accept environmental
policies of the UN or other international agencies. Arguing that there
is an abundance of natural resources (provided by God), the RR members
deny global warming and climate change. Just like Darwin's theory, the
greenhouse effect is for them a liberal ideological demagogy122. As
Lienesch points out, "practicing universalistic religion, Evangelicals
are conscious of Christ's commission to carry their faith to all ends of
the earth". At the same time "\[a\]s conservatives who subscribe to a
strongly [nationalistic brand of patriotism, they think of America as
holding a parallel political responsibility to bring law and liberty to
other lands]{.underline}. In combining these two callings, they have
come to conceive of the U.S. as having a [God-given mission to save
other nations from religious backwardness and political
corruption]{.underline}"123. And although, this concept is not new in
the history of the United States ([Americans have thought of themselves
as "the redeemer nation" since the late 18th century]{.underline}),
scholars argue that the approach to foreign policy taken by the
religious conservatives in the 20th century has been unique, because it
consists "of a particularly confrontational and combative version of
this redemptive international impulse"124. [Their view of the world is
not only moralistic, but also highly dualistic, and frequently
apocalyptical]{.underline}125. Summing up, since the creation of the RR,
its foreign policy aims have included: opposition to communism (mostly
in the 20th century), supporting Israel, postulating strong national
security, combating Islam (especially after 9/11), opposing the UN as
international conspiracy, as well as various UN agencies and its
programs, including those preventing AIDS126 and global warming, and
those that are aimed at protecting sexual minorities and promoting
family planning. The views of the RR on how to deal with the problem of
prostitution and human trafficking around the world are also radically
different than those presented by the UN127. Additionally, the RR has
been involved in fighting against what is considered by the movement as
persecution of Christians around the world. The Effects of the Religious
Right's Involvement in the U.S. Foreign Policy Ronald Reagan
administration At the beginning of its existence the main area in which
the RR attempted to influence [U.S. foreign policy was the crusade
against the 'evil empire' and communism in the world]{.underline}.
During the [Reagan administration]{.underline} the members of the RR
became [strongly involved in support of most of the anti-communist
actions as well as in fighting atheism in communist
countries]{.underline}. While the latter aim was exercised mostly by
supporting actions against persecution of Christians, the involvement in
anti-communist actions took many different forms. For example, several
members of the Council for National Policy (CNP) were engaged in
[supporting actions in Latin America, including covert military
operations, also those concerning Nicaraguan Contras]{.underline}128. At
the same time the Moral Majority, the Freedom Council and the Heritage
Foundation were cooperating with Reagan's Outreach Working Party on
[Central America, devising strategy and propaganda against communists in
these countries (including assassinations]{.underline})129. What is
important, during the fight against communism, the RR members
represented and [advocated a realist approach, stating that the abuse of
rights is always relative. Therefore, they had no objections to the U.S.
military actions or to the support of cruel regimes in Latin
America]{.underline}. In fact, before Reagan was elected,
representatives of the movement had criticized Jimmy Carter for his
idealism and contrasted it to the (much more promising) realism proposed
by Reagan. They postulated, what they called a "constructive
engagement"130. With this attitude, they forged coalition with political
conservatives in order to oppose international communism at all levels,
including diplomatic and military ones131. However, although these
coalitions and financial support had some material meaning for the
Republican Party leaders, what was the most important for the Party at
that time was the RR's symbolic language. The [apocalyptic terminology
and metaphors used by the movement's representatives, including such
terms as "Redeemer nation" and "The Evil Empire" were adopted by
politicians, and especially by Ronald Reagan]{.underline}. According to
the Cold War researchers, he started to use such expressions
instrumentally - in order to gain support for the administration's Cold
War policy. The [Soviet Union was commonly described as "Anti-Christian
Adversary, atheistic and anti-individualistic" -- "diplomatically
deceitful and politically untrustworthy, a symbol of everything that
America should act against, everything that it should
avoid]{.underline}"132. The rhetoric of the RR turned out to be quite
helpful to Ronald Reagan who gained huge support for his anti-communist
policies. What is interesting however, although these policies
effectively worked in bringing the Cold War to an end, the RR members
were extremely surprised that the Soviet Union actually collapsed. They
even felt deceived by the government who did not inform them about the
economic problems of the Evil Empire. Pat Robertson went as far as
speculating that the Cold War might have been a deception, a "false
war", maybe even a "conspiracy"133. Surprisingly, the RR movement was
quite ambivalent about the consequences of the collapse of communism. On
the one hand, such turn of events could have been considered a triumph
for the West, as well as an opportunity to spread Christianity,
especially in Easter Europe. On the other hand however, some RR members
were pointing to the pervasiveness of secularism in the Western European
social democracies - perceived as being almost as bad as the disease of
communism itself134. Consequently, after the fall of communism, the
world looked less stable to the RR activists. [They had to find new
foreign policy goals at the time of turmoil, controversy and political
and spiritual unres]{.underline}t135. Another area of activity during
this period of history was the RR's [strong engagement in the Middle
East policy.]{.underline} At first it was also connected with the Cold
War situation and opposition to the "Godless" communist influence in the
region, but with time [Christian Zionist ideas stated to play a major
role]{.underline}. Among the most active and famous representatives of
American Christian Zionism there were: Franklin Littell, Hal Lindsey,
John Hagee, Tim LaHaye, Jerry Jenkins, Pat Robertson and Jerry Falwell
(to name a \...few). They created and operated various Christian Zionist
organizations136 which were designed to: [promote Israel, generate
material help during Israel's military conflicts, provide financial help
to the Israeli settlers, and to pressure U.S. government to support
Israel in all possible ways]{.underline}. According to Professor Paul
Rogers, it was actually already the Six-Day War in 1967 that gave
impetus to the Christian Zionists' political engagement137. Shortly
after the war in June of 1967 Franklin Littell established Christians
Concerned for Israel (CCI)138. Its creation preceded the creation of
Moral Majority, however Jerry Falwell joined forces with Christian
Zionists soon after his organization entered the American political
scene. [CCI was created because Christian Zionists were concerned with
the fact that the France's alliance with Israel in the 1950s and 1960s
was maintained out of strategic interests of retaining control over the
Suez Canal. They believed that there should be an unconditional alliance
with Israel, based not on political motivations but on religious
foundations]{.underline}139. Jerry Falwell and his followers supported
this claim.

### Ethics

#### This politics of sacrifice is unethical - makes the extinction of all life inevitable. 

**Santos 03.** 2003, Boaventura de Souza Santos is a Professor of
Sociology at the University of Coimbra, "Collective Suicide?", Bad
Subjects, Issue \# 63 ,http://www.ces.fe.uc.pt/opiniao/bss/072en.php

[According to]{.underline} Franz [Hinkelammert]{.underline}, [the West
has]{.underline} repeatedly [been under the illusion that it should
**try to save humanity by destroying part of it**. This is a salvific
and sacrificial destruction, committed in the **name of the need to
radically materialize all the possibilities opened up by a given social
and political reality** over which it is supposed to have total power.
This is how it was in **colonialism**, with the **genocide of indigenous
peoples**, and **the African slaves**. This is how it was in the
**period of imperialist struggle**s, which caused **millions of deaths**
in two world wars and many other colonial wars. This is how it was in
**Stalinism**, with the **Gulag** and in **Nazism**, with the
**holocaust**]{.underline}. And now today, [this is how it is in
neoliberalism, with the **collective sacrifice of the periphery** and
**even the semiperiphery of the world system.**]{.underline} With the
war against Iraq, it is fitting to ask whether what is in progress is a
new genocidal and sacrificial illusion, and what its scope might be. [It
is above all appropriate to ask if the new illusion will not herald the
radicalization and the ultimate perversion of the western
illusion]{.underline}: **[destroying all of humanity in the illusion of
saving it.]{.underline}** [Sacrificial genocide arises from a
totalitarian illusion that is manifested in the belief that there are no
alternatives to the present-day reality and that the problems and
**difficulties confronting it arise from failing to take its logic of
development to its ultimate consequences.**]{.underline} [If there is
unemployment, hunger and death in the Third World, this is not the
result of market failures]{.underline}; instead, [it is the outcome of
the market laws not having been fully applied.]{.underline} [If there is
terrorism]{.underline}, [this is not due to the violence of the
conditions that generate it; it is due, rather, to the fact that total
violence has not been employed to physically eradicate all terrorists
and potential terrorists.]{.underline} **[This political logic is based
on the supposition of total power and knowledge]{.underline}**, [and on
the radical rejection of alternatives]{.underline}; [it is
ultra-conservative in that it aims to infinitely reproduce the status
quo.]{.underline} Inherent to it is the notion of the end of history.
During the last hundred years, [the West has experienced three versions
of this logic]{.underline}, and, therefore, seen three versions of the
end of history: [Stalinism]{.underline}, with its logic of insuperable
efficiency of the plan; [Nazism]{.underline}, with its logic of racial
superiority; [and neoliberalism]{.underline}, with its logic of
insuperable efficiency of the market. The first two periods involved the
destruction of democracy. The last one trivializes democracy, disarming
it in the face of social actors sufficiently powerful to be able to
privatize the State and international institutions in their favour. I
have described this situation as a combination of political democracy
and social fascism. One current manifestation of this combination
resides in the fact that intensely strong public opinion, worldwide,
against the war is found to be incapable of halting the war machine set
in motion by supposedly democratic rulers. [At all these
moments]{.underline}, [a **death drive**, a catastrophic
heroism]{.underline}, [predominates, **the idea of a looming collective
suicide**, **only preventable by the massive destruction of the
other**.]{.underline} Paradoxically, [the broader the definition of the
other and the efficacy of its destruction, the **more likely collective
suicide becomes**. In its sacrificial genocide version, neoliberalism is
a mixture of market radicalization, neoconservatism and Christian
fundamentalism.]{.underline} **[Its death drive takes a number of forms,
from the idea of \"discardable populations\"]{.underline}**, [referring
to citizens of the Third World not capable of being exploited as workers
and consumers, to **the concept of \"collateral damage\",** to refer to
the deaths, as a result of war, of thousands of innocent
civilians]{.underline}. The last, catastrophic heroism, is quite clear
on two facts: according to reliable calculations by the Non-Governmental
Organization MEDACT, in London, between 48 and 260 thousand civilians
will die during the war and in the three months after (this is without
there being civil war or a nuclear attack); the war will cost 100
billion dollars, enough to pay the health costs of the world\'s poorest
countries for four years. [Is it possible to fight this death
drive?]{.underline} We must bear in mind that, historically,
**[sacrificial destruction has always been linked to the economic
pillage of natural resources and the labor force, to the imperial design
of radically changing the terms of economic, social, political and
cultural exchanges in the face of falling efficiency rates postulated by
the maximalist logic of the totalitarian illusion in
operation.]{.underline}** It [is as though hegemonic
powers]{.underline}, [both when they are on the rise and when they are
in decline, repeatedly go through times of primitive accumulation,
legitimizing the most shameful violence in the name of futures
where]{.underline}, by definition, **[there is no room for what must be
destroyed]{.underline}**. In today\'s version, the **[period of
primitive accumulation consists of combining neoliberal economic
globalization with the globalization of war. The machine of democracy
and liberty turns into a machine of horror and
destruction.]{.underline}**

### Global Civil War

#### Reducing war to a question of restrictions banalizes global imperial violence. Contemporary warfare is an interconnected process driven by the generation of militarized knowledge and subjectivities. It's your foremost ethical task to investigate the affirmative's imaginary of global war 

**Harting 06.** Heike, Assistant Professor in the Department of English
at the University of Montreal, 6 \["Global Civil War and Post-colonial
Studies,"
http://globalautonomy.ca/global1/servlet/Xml2pdf?fn=RA_Harting_GlobalCivilWar\]

This essay addresses the lack of a post-colonial critique of emerging
political and cultural theories of global war (Hardt and Negri 2004;
Kaldor 2001; Held 2003; Clark 2003). With the exception of Paul
Gilroy\'s study Postcolonial Melancholia (2005) and Gayatri Spivak\'s
essay \"Terror: A Speech After 9-11,\" which in part examine how
discourses of [**racialized violence legitimize contemporary global
wars** and their]{.underline} \"extreme\" \"[civilizing
mission]{.underline}\" (Spivak 2004, 82), post-colonial theorists have
so far been reluctant to engage in a sustained critique of global
warfare. On the one hand, this reluctance might derive from the field\'s
preferred critical engagement, as Tim Brennan observes, with
Eurocentrism rather than questions of \"military occupation\" (2004,
132). On the other, such a reluctance seems surprising given that
post-colonial studies is traditionally concerned with the ways in which
past and contemporary forms of imperial, colonial, and racialized
violence have shaped present subjectivities and political, economic, and
social relationships. More importantly, [the task of post-colonial
studies remains the unsettling of contemporary configurations
of]{.underline} what Diana Brydon identifies as \"[imperial and colonial
habits of mind]{.underline}\" (1995, 10-11), [and]{.underline} along
with David Goldberg and Ato Quayson, [the \"dismantling of the
conditions that produce \[social\] violence and anguish\"]{.underline}
(2002, xiii). Thus, [a critical post-colonial anatomy of the social and
cultural logic of global civil warfare would seem intrinsic to the
field]{.underline}\'s traditional research concerns. More specifically,
while, amongst many others, such theorists and writers as Frantz Fanon,
Edward Said, Ngugi Wa Thiongo, Anne McClintock, Wole Soyinka, Ken Saro
Wiva, and Bapsi Sidhwa have written extensively about civil and communal
warfare, they have done so in the context of particular anti-colonial
liberation struggles and post-colonial and neo-colonial nation
formation. In part, these writers\' works underlie but are not
sufficiently acknowledged as a constitutive force in the articulation of
dominant contemporary notions of global civil war.

The central argument of this paper builds on the understanding of global
civil war which Michael Hardt and Antonio Negri advance in their study
Multitude: War and Democracy in the Age of Empire, the sequel to Empire.
They suggest that [global civil war designates both an absolute \"regime
of biopower\"]{.underline} (2004, 13) [and a form of warfare that is no
longer fought between two sovereign states but on one, steadily
expanding territory not demarcated by conventional national
boundaries]{.underline}. In this sense, **[global civil war is intrinsic
to]{.underline}** what the two theorists call [**empire**, namely the
formation of a new global sovereignty that supersedes colonialism and
imperialism, is dissociated from national and supranational
institutions, and emerges from the]{.underline} autonomous and immanent
[logic of capital expansion and management. By the same logic of
immanence, **empire is a cultural, economic, and political formation
that gives rise to its own movement** of resistance or
counter-empire]{.underline}.1 In contrast to Hardt and Negri\'s at times
limited notion of global civil war, [I]{.underline} suggest to
[conceptualize global civil war as a social and historical formation
rooted in the history of imperial and colonial modernity. As with
imperial wars, global civil wars both appropriate the guerilla tactics
of insurgency warfare]{.underline} ??? an argument also made by Hardt
and Negri ??? [and]{.underline}, in contrast to their theory of global
civil war, [rely on the historical deployment of racialized violence and
the perpetual brutalization and surveillance of civil society,
often]{.underline} ??? but not exclusively ??? [in the name of a
humanitarian, peacekeeping, or protective cause]{.underline}.2 [The
notion of the \"civil\" in \"global civil war\" is]{.underline} thus
[frequently synonymous with the dismantling of civil rights and an
internationally condoned assignment to \"civilize\"]{.underline}
so-called rogue or failed nation [states]{.underline}. In this sense,
[we may call the US-led \"war against terror\" a \"global civil war\"
without]{.underline}, however, [reducing the latter concept to a
post-9-11 phenomenon]{.underline}. For, polemically speaking, despite
its involvement of a wide range of global actors, the \"war on terror\"
remains a national project of the United States. It mobilizes patriotic
sentiments of US-American national destiny on a global scale and depends
on the simultaneous denial and reinvention of the United States\'
imperial past.

[Contextualizing the notion of global civil war in the history of
imperial modernity and violence, then, seeks to adumbrate some of the
ways in which contemporary theories of global civil war tend to eclipse
the post-colonial moment of these wars]{.underline}. In particular, I
wish to ask how **[contemporary representations of war contribute to the
construction of a normalizing global imaginary of war]{.underline}**. I
use the latter term to refer to those hegemonic narratives through which
[the West comes to imagine itself as a civilizing bulwark against the
violent forces of unruly and terrorist rogue states and to **accept
global war and racial violence as a historical inevitability** of the
rule of neo-liberal globalization]{.underline}. Furthermore, how should
we conceptualize the post-colonial moment of global civil war, and how
does identifying and problematizing such a moment expand and trouble
present concepts of global warfare?

To engage with these questions, the first part of this paper provides a
brief survey of the ways in which a number of post-colonial theorists
have begun to address the particular phenomena of global armed conflict
but, by and large, refrained from a systematic discussion of global
civil warfare. The paper\'s second part elaborates my critique of
dominant notions of global civil war through a discussion of Hardt and
Negri\'s and, to a lesser extent, Jean-Luc Nancy\'s writings on
globalization and war. Their work, I argue, situates global civil war
outside earlier narratives of violence, resistance, and imperialism,
when, in fact, all of these narratives either underlie or bleed into the
present causes, investments, and media representations of global civil
war. In order to develop a post-colonial understanding of global civil
war that helps us think beyond presentist models of global war, parts
four and five of this paper draw from Jean Arasanayagam\'s and Michael
Ondaatje\'s fictional accounts of Sri Lanka\'s prolonged civil war to
question received ways of legitimizing violence and to reread the
putatively biopolitical character of global civil wars through, what
Achille Mbembe calls, the \"necropolitics\" (2003, 11) of global
imperialism. Such a rereading, I propose, emphasizes how global civil
war operates through the long-term militarization and brutalization of
former colonial societies. The sixth and last part of this paper
suggests a post-colonial reading of the ways in which the assumed state
of a permanent global emergency relies on routinized forms of racial
violence and extreme violent global warfare in order to generate
disposable human beings and, to use Giorgio Agamben\'s phrase,
\"politicize death\" (1998, 160).

Post-colonial Readings of Global War

Recent developments in post-colonial studies suggest, according to
Brennan, that scholars in the field had to \"retool\" themselves as
\"globalization theorists\" and consider themselves \"as functioning in
a larger division of intellectual labor\" (2004, 138). What does this
\"retooling\" look like? In particular, how do post-colonial scholars
enter and shape debates on global war and violence?3 While there has
been prolific research on the construction of diasporic, hybrid, and
cosmopolitan subjectivities and transnational imaginaries, or on what
Simon Gikandi sees as globalization\'s discourse of cultural
\"celebration\" (2001, 629), less attention has been paid to
globalization as \"a discourse of failure and atrophy\" (ibid., 638). To
understand the latter, for example, Gikandi argues, we have to track
back the death of two young Guinean men \"whose bodies were found in the
cargo hold of a plane in Brussels in August 1998\" (ibid., 630) to
particular Enlightenment discourses of autonomy and rationality, time,
and progress that inform colonial and global modernities. In Gikandi\'s
reading ??? which would warrant a much more detailed analysis than I can
offer here ??? the death of these two young African men provides the
opportunity to conceptualize globalization as a new version of
post-colonialism\'s critique of Eurocentrism and the failure of the
post-colonial nation-state. The global, he maintains, \"had to be
reinvented as a substitute for nationalism\" and the ideologically and
politically \"vanishing \'Third World\'\" (ibid., 646) in the wake of
the post-Cold War era. In this context, globalization is a violent
process that erases the political, historical and cultural presence of
the erstwhile colonized from the global present. Their presence seems to
be registered only with reference to the ways in which it upsets
Eurocentric notions of the nation, belonging, affect, and subjectivity.

Similarly, yet from a different political perspective, Neil Larsen
enters the debate on globalization through a \"material genealogy of
postcolonialism\" (2000, 33) and foregrounds the historical and economic
continuities between imperialism, colonialism, post-colonialism, and
globalization. Larsen traces the role of the nation as the grounding
figure that binds all of these terms. Yet, in contrast to those who tend
to announce globalization as a new post-national era, Larsen suggests
that imperialism and its culmination in World War I and II, along with
the wars\' concomitant mass migrations, made it impossible, if not
obsolete, to reflect on the \"world\" in terms of homogenous,
\"particular national histories and experiences\" (ibid., 32). Rather,
the violent crises of imperialism (WW I and II, Bandung era) gave rise
to both a \"transeuropean\" (ibid., 31) configuration of anti-imperial
and revolutionary movements and a cultural conceptualization of the
nation as a space of liberation, reflected in national liberation
struggles that \"re-essentialized, or de-europeanized national space or
imaginary\" (ibid., 34). Under today\'s economic pressures of
globalization, the Fanonian and Marxian ideal of a transeuropean nation
??? an ideal, which, as Fanon argues, has always been threatened by the
co-optation of the colonial elites into a neo-colonial European
appropriation of the newly independent nation-state ??? has collapsed.
In particular, the transeuropean nation is being transformed into \"an
institutional/ideological entity that, precisely because it has been
rendered inoperative as a site of the accumulation and control of
capital, seeks to compensate for this in undergoing a radical
reparticularization verging, in the most extreme cases (e.g.,
Afghanistan, Serbia) on a desecularization\" (ibid., 43). In other
words, Larsen suggests that contemporary ethnic and civil wars are both
a result of the financial restructuring of the globe and its attending
disintegration of the nation-state. Yet, what remains troubling and
unexplained is why the disintegration of the nation should automatically
lead to a violent return to cultural and religious particularism and
essentialism. Are we to assume that in all cases of global civil war we
are confronted with a return of archaic and primordialist attitudes of
ethnic absolutism, to use Paul Gilroy\'s term, previously kept in check
by the authoritative rather than emancipatory operations of the
post-colonial nation-state? Indeed, to what extent does a culturalist
??? if not primordialist ??? reading of global war account for the at
once global and local politicization and racialization of violence?
Larsen, however, reminds us that the destruction of the \"nationalized
economic regimes in the third (and former \'second\' world)\" presents a
global crisis whose consequences are also \"dire\" for the \"global
hegemons \[US, Western Europe, Japan\]\" (ibid., 42). Thus, rather than
abandoning the nation-state as politically compromised and ineffective
in a global world, he affords it a central and by far not yet resolved
role in dealing with the production of a new global order.

If Larsen sees contemporary wars as a product of the economic
disempowerment of nation-states, Arjun Appadurai locates the extreme
violence of contemporary global civil wars in larger cultural and
ideological formations. Although Appadurai concedes that these wars must
be read within the context of the crisis of legitimation of the
nation-state (1996, 157) and the biopolitics of the colonial and modern
nation-state, he suggests that they are culturalist in that they operate
through the \"conscious mobilization of cultural differences in the
service of a larger national and transnational politics\" (ibid., 15).
Culturalist movements, he suggests, create communities of sentiment that
are \"comprehensible only within specific cultural frames of meaning and
style and larger historical frames of power and discipline\" (ibid.,
148), the distribution of images, and the \"imagination\" (ibid., 149).
Culturalist or ethnic violence, he argues, should not be conceptualized
as a \"primordial sentiment\" (ibid., 149). Instead, understanding such
violence involves addressing the local, social, and cultural
construction of intimacy and the physical and psychic embodiment of rage
and pain. Here, Appadurai\'s insistence on a social critique of the
embodiment and localization of culturalist violence in a post-national
or global context can serve as a possible trajectory for a post-colonial
critique of global civil war. Indeed, as I will argue in section three,
it is the historical production of pain and death, or of what Mbembe
describes as the \"necropolitics\" (2003, 11) of modernity, that allows
us to understand global civil war in localized and historically situated
terms.

What all these post-colonial readings of global civil war have in common
is their desire to respond to war in an ethical fashion. What does this
entail? In her essay \"Terror: A Speech After 9-11,\" Spivak considers
the \"war on terror\" as synonymous with global civil war and emphasizes
its archaic and coercive rhetoric of cultural incommensurability. Here
the term global war distracts from the fact that the war on terror,
despite its involvement of the Northern alliance, refers to an imperial
war fought unilaterally by the United States without UN sanction. \"[The
war]{.underline},\" Spivak explains, \"[is **part of an alibi every
imperialism has given itself**, a civilising mission carried to the
extreme, as it always must be. It is a war on terrorism reduced at home
to due process, to a criminal case]{.underline}???[a war zoomed down to
a lawsuit and zoomed up to face an abstraction]{.underline}\" (2004,
82). In this sense, Spivak\'s assessment coincides with Hardt and
Negri\'s (2000, 13) observation that [the primordialist and **Manichaean
rhetoric** global civil war banalizes war as a form of \"police
action,\" creates an absolute enemy, and \"sacrilizes\" war by
**grounding military pursuits in putatively ethical claims** that
protect and reinstate democracy, \"order and peace.\"]{.underline} In
other words, [global civil war depends on the construction of an enemy
by mobilizing and **criminalizing cultural Otherness**]{.underline}. For
this reason, [the humanities have an important role to play in
responding to and containing global civil war. The **foremost
pedagogical task**]{.underline}, Spivak argues, [consists in training
\"for the eruption of the ethical \[understood as\] an interruption of
the epistemological, which is the attempt to construct the other as
object of knowledge\"]{.underline} (2004, 83). In other words, [a
post-colonial critique of global civil war ought to **examine how global
civil war generates human subjects differentially on a global
scale**]{.underline}. Thus, [what post-colonial studies needs to bring
to bear on globalization studies is]{.underline}, first, a detailed
analysis of the ways in which post-colonial writing participates in the
cultural production of competing narratives of global civil warfare,
and, second, [a critique of global civil war that accounts for the
racialized violence]{.underline} and identity politics
[that]{.underline} frequently [fuel global conflict]{.underline} or are
mobilized in its service. [Analyzing the ways in which global war
**generates particular subjectivities** is of great importance since
global capitalism thrives and depends on both the violent production and
commodification of identity and the total militarization of national and
global social relationships]{.underline}.

The next section of this paper examines the ways in which a number of
cultural narratives of global civil war rearticulate traditional
concepts of war. However, by contextualizing war in a presentist and, at
times, Eurocentric understanding of globalization, these narratives risk
reinforcing rather than destabilizing dominant legitimizing practices of
global warfare.

Situating Global Civil War

If globalization refers to the uneven process of restructuring social,
political, and economic space within and beyond the nation-state, then a
change of the concept of war, its means and purposes, as well as its
present ubiquity seem logical effects of globalization. For example, in
Empire, Hardt and Negri suggest that although the world has never been
at peace, presently [war seems to be the single most characteristic
feature of \"Empire.\" The latter]{.underline}, they argue, [is
continuously embroiled in bloodshed, yet \"always dedicated to
peace]{.underline} ??? [a perpetual and universal peace outside of
history\"]{.underline} (2000, xv). The Kantian allusion provides a first
glimpse at how we might begin to address the complex phenomenon of
global war. As a preliminary hypothesis, I wish to suggest that global
civil [war cannot be reduced to exceptional forms of extreme violence
enacted in different or unconnected theatres of war]{.underline}.
Rather, [it **relates to indirect yet systemic forms of political and
economic coercion**]{.underline}. Practically, the concept of global
civil war, as, for example, Mary Kaldor suggests, has three
characteristics: first, global civil war works through the strategic as
well as indiscriminate abuse of human rights, frequently legitimized on
grounds of exclusive identity politics; second, the war is not winnable
but serves to rally the population around political causes; third,
[global war **generates an economy of plunder and piracy** while the
state maintains and defends its stakes by deploying mercenaries and
engaging in illegal global arms trade]{.underline}. Although [this
description]{.underline} helps elucidate the global aspects of such
historically prolonged armed conflicts as Sri Lanka\'s and Rwanda\'s, it
[brushes over the epistemological dimension of global warfare, namely
its frequently dehistoricized conceptualization]{.underline} and its
need to mobilize exclusionary identity politics. [What remains invisible
is that global civil war is intrinsic to]{.underline} predatory global
capitalism and aims at [maintaining a historically received global order
of unequal power relationships]{.underline}. Moreover, the extreme and
often genocidal violence of global civil war ??? a phenomenon that
connects old and new theatres of war ??? frequently \"attempts to
eradicate the concept of human altogether, replacing it with the idea of
an irrevocable progress towards the eradication of superfluous human
beings\" (Razack 2004, 160).

Hardt and [Negri]{.underline}, then, [examine the capitalist,
biopolitical, and cultural logic of contemporary warfare by relating
global war to both the development of digital technologies for military
uses and the increasing importance of]{.underline} immaterial labour,
namely, **[labour engaged in the production of ideas, knowledge, and
subjectivities]{.underline}**. Their analysis primarily serves to
navigate a way out of what they see as a permanent state of exception
and to map strategies of resistance for the multitude, their term for a
new global class of people loosely and strategically united in their
struggle against globalization. Hardt and Negri\'s reading of global
civil war is instructive for its delineation of the ways in which the
\"war machinery\" ??? to use Hardt and Negri\'s Deleuzean terminology
??? of the United States and its allied partners has appropriated
methods of guerrilla and liberation warfare, formerly used in the
struggle against colonialism. It seems to me, however, that this kind of
appropriation cannot be reduced to the ways in which the
non-hierarchical organization of guerrilla troops and warfare have been
transformed into an authoritarian chain of command structure,
characteristic of conventional armies.

Moreover, emphasizing that war is quickly \"becoming a general
phenomenon, global and interminable\" (2004, 3), they propose to read
all contemporary wars as \"global civil wars\" (ibid., 4) or \"netwars\"
(ibid., 55). Thus, Hardt and Negri tend to conceptualize these wars as
postmodern phenomena rather than wars that either pursue particular
imperial projects of reordering current global geopolitics or that have
long-standing post-colonial roots but have mutated into global civil
warfare. Understood as \"counterinsurgencies\" (ibid., 37), global civil
wars change a people\'s entire social and political makeup, are
connected with other war zones, and designate a process in which the
distinction between war and civil society has become obsolete. Unlike
conventional civil wars, which are considered atavistic remnants of
modernity and effects of imperial forms of nation-formation (Horowitz
1985) and emerge out of competing claims to territorial sovereignty,
global civil wars are fought by mercenary forces across a global rather
than national terrain and aim at population control rather than
territorial autonomy.

What, then, is new about global civil war? If war is presumably no
longer bound to territorial control and direct conquest but, instead,
has become a reflection of media velocity, high-tech combat (Der Derian
2001) and capitalism\'s need to restructure the planet\'s markets and
geopolitics of resource control, to what extent, we may ask, does global
civil war present a qualitatively new phenomenon, rather than, say, a
quantitative change of the intensity of warfare, depending on
technological development. Furthermore, is global civil war merely
another term for the recently revived rhetoric of just wars in a global
context? What differentiates Hardt and Negri\'s notion of \"global civil
war\" from Michael Ignatieff\'s (1998, 5) notion of \"postmodern war,\"
since both terms refer to changes in the organization and modes of
contemporary ethnic civil war? Or, how does the term relate to Jean-Luc
Nancy\'s notion of the \"confronted community\" (2003a, 23)? For, Nancy
vehemently opposes such primordialist explanations of contemporary
warfare as put forward by Samuel Huntington. Instead, global civil war
designates an epistemological and material war of a specific yet
globalized civilization, namely of the West, whose values of monotheism,
self-presence, and truth have exhausted themselves. Nancy\'s approach to
[global war]{.underline} not only [makes legible the ways in which
global civil war arises as an epistemological problem of Western
metaphysics but]{.underline}, by the same token, [situates global war
within a particularly localized critique of Eurocentrism]{.underline}.

To Nancy, then, contemporary global [warfare is symptomatic of the ways
in which the idea of community is confronted with itself]{.underline},
with its insistence on and desire for essence, unequivocal identity,
propriety, omnipresence, and purity. Indeed, global civil war suggests
that Western civilization, understood, in Nancy\'s words, as a \"work of
death\" (2003a, 24), is finally confronted with its own spiritual
emptiness and self-destructive logic of sameness. In this context,
global civil war is symptomatic for the disintegration of Western values
and truth claims and is interpreted solely as a critique of
Eurocentrism, an argument that inadvertently remains indebted to the
idea that civil wars result from the disintegration of the nation-state
and its attendant epistemologies of belonging. What we find at the
horizon of Nancy\'s critique, then, is the hope of inventing new ways in
which the \"Euro-Mediterranean world\" relates to itself as \"Other,\"
to \"\'value\', to the \'absolute\', to \'truth\'\" (2003b, 53). Such a
critique of contemporary warfare, however, can think global civil war
neither beyond the West\'s concern with itself nor within different
genealogies of both failed and ongoing processes of decolonization.
Instead, it begs the question of what or who is the \"global\" in
\"global civil war.\" Indeed, as I argue throughout this essay, the way
in which we define the \"global\" in the context of global war largely
determines how we read the particular political investments and
interests that underlie global war. For example, if global war is
primarily a byproduct of and intrinsic to Empire and its consolidation,
it appears to be inevitable and takes place outside discourses of
political legitimization and accountability. From a different
perspective, conceptualizing global civil war as being engineered by the
Global North, that is, predominantly by the United States and its allied
nations, reveals the ways in which global war deeply invests in and
ensures the continuous accumulation of global capital and centralized
practices of uneven capital distribution. Furthermore, if \"the global\"
designates ??? as I think it does ??? a cultural and social space
inhabited by those who are impoverished, dispossessed, and violated by
the economic and geopolitical restructuring of the world, then the
\"global\" also delineates a process of subject constitution governed by
the construction of absolute difference, abjection, and dehumanization.

With its implication of having superseded national politics and
interests, the term global civil war appears to require that we accept
Hardt and Negri\'s often criticized assumption that the nation-state no
longer mediates claims to sovereignty and power (Tilly 2003; Brennan
2003). For the moment, however, I will refrain from participating in the
controversy over the role of the nation in Hardt and Negri\'s work.
Instead, I suggest that while their understanding of global civil war
does not explicitly engage in a critique of global violence, but instead
focuses on an analysis of the structures of command and strategies of
contemporary warfare, it helps raise questions through which to sketch a
post-colonial critique of global violence. More specifically, in the
next three parts of this paper, I wish to relocate three aspects of
their argument in a post-colonial framework: first, the preponderance of
biopolitics in their notion of global civil war; second, the
construction of normalizing narratives of global civil war, specifically
the rhetoric of the archaic; and third, the relationship between global
civil war and the notion of the state of exception or emergency. As
Hannah Arendt already implied in 1963, the terms global civil war and
the state of exception function in tandem as signs and instruments of
modern totalitarianism. Today, the state of exception has become
globalization\'s most coercive instrument in regulating the limits of
global citizenship and the legal status of particular individuals such
as prisoners of war and refugees. More specifically, I suggest that the
term \"global civil war,\" specifically when understood as a version of
the US-led \"war against terror,\" serves to normalize and legitimize
the transformation of constitutional democracy into a permanent but
unacknowledged state of exception. The latter is either smothered in a
propagandistic rhetoric of fear or shrouded in a misleading public
debate over political prevention. From a post-colonial perspective,
however, [the state of exception]{.underline}, as I propose in the last
section of this paper, also [designates a **cultural and intellectual
disposition toward accepting global war** and its reliance on the
operations of racialized violence as a **historical norm and inevitable
outcome of Western history**]{.underline}. The next part shifts a
predominantly biopolitical understanding of global civil war towards an
analysis of the necropolitics of these wars.

### Liberal Saviorism

#### The liberal critique of "tyrannical" status-quo state practices creates a "divine" violence or saviorism complex where all subjects are framed as vulnerable populations in need of rescue -- this not only greases the cogs of the biopolitical will to live, but also creates a reductionist framework of state centric-politics.

Judith Butler follows this [non-violent reading of divine violence to
develop her earlier concerns with the (dis)qualification of lives
through the powers of mourning.]{.underline} Reading Benjamin this way
allows her to conceive of **[an alternative "non-violent
violence"]{.underline}** which **[can be 'invoked and waged against the
coercive force of law.]{.underline}**'12 Highlighting Benjamin's
messianic-Judaic heritage, in particular, Butler "unleashes" divine
violence '**[against the coercive force of that legal framework, against
the accountability that binds a subject to a specific legal system and
stops that very subject from developing a critical, if not revolutionary
point of view on that legal system.']{.underline}** Central to Butler's
interpretation is the claim that [it]{.underline}s violence [explicates
forms of violence that are depended upon establishing the foundational
nature of guilt]{.underline} as identified by Benjamin's earlier
provocation. **[The divine thus appears as a strategic form of ethical
and political intervention]{.underline}**, which embracing the idea that
critique is the order of battle, willingly enters into **[an
intellectual conflict with all too real forms of violence, moral
entrapments and forceful unifications as enshrined in juridical
systems.]{.underline}** It is as she writes:

**[The desire to release life from a guilt secured through legal
contract with the state]{.underline}** -- this would be a desire that
**[gives rise to a violence against violence, one that seeks to release
life from a death]{.underline}** contract **[with the law, a death of
the living soul by the hardening force of
guilt.]{.underline}**[13](https://muse.jhu.edu/article/607272#f13)

[This "non-violence violence" reading has less convinced Slavoj
Žižek.]{.underline} Focusing instead upon the distinction between the
realm of the "subjective" (i.e., headline violence such as 9/11) and the
hidden yet objective "symbolic" realities of everyday violence, [Žižek
demands an account of the divine that remains grounded in the concrete
reality of revolutionary moments that history shows to be far from
"bloodless"]{.underline}14. As he explained in response to a question on
the relationship between violence and politics:

This question is particularly confused on the Left. Let's take the use
made of two authors, Carl Schmitt and Walter Benjamin, for example. I
don't have any problem with Schmitt. But Schmitt's concepts of
"decision" and "exception" function precisely to erase the crucial
distinction governing [Benjamin's "Critique of Violence", namely the
distinction between "mythical" and "divine" violence.]{.underline} For
Schmitt, to put it quite simply, there is no divine violence. For him
there is an illegal violence that is a foundation, a violence of the
exception that gives rise to law. [Many Leftists who flirt with Benjamin
want to speak of some "spectral" violence that never really happens, or
they adopt an attitude like Agamben and simply wait for some magical
intervention.]{.underline} I'm sorry, but Benjamin is pretty precise. An
example he gives of divine violence is a mob lynching a corrupt ruler!
That's pretty concrete.15

Despite their differences here in terms of conceptualising violence --
intellectual or physical, each of these authors nevertheless starts
their analysis from the dominance of a mythical paradigm. Each also
accepts that **[what makes the divine politically appealing is the way
in which it offers]{.underline}** a pure **[means for challenging the
violence of established order, unbinding the forces of
tyranny]{.underline}** without asking for sovereign permission,
**[thereby explicating itself from the monopolised forms of violence in
the name of the living.]{.underline}** [The Mythical then is
collectively read here as the embodiment of a forced unity, whereas the
Divine appears to be an unmediated revolutionary potential capable of
bringing about the conditions of the new.]{.underline} **[If the Mythic
retains its Sovereign integrity, the Divine opens a
rupture]{.underline}** in the field of internal oppression as the
various **[systems]{.underline}** of ordering **[integral to Sovereign
authority are brought into]{.underline}** critical
**[question.]{.underline}** Here's the problem. In order to sustain this
analysis, [the Critique's structural and juridical frames must still be
accepted as the dominant paradigm for political power]{.underline} and
oppression in the 21st Century. **[The State,]{.underline}** in other
words, along with its constituted forms of juridical power, **[remains
the principle referent object for political analysis.]{.underline}**
**[Such]{.underline}** a **[reductionist approach]{.underline}** to
political **[analysis is no longer satisfactory.]{.underline}** **[Not
only has the sanctity of the modern nation state]{.underline}**
(understood as being the principle source of authority) **[been
undermined by forces beyond conventional territorialities, liberal
regimes of power have openly operated in the global space of
flows]{.underline}** for some considerable time, notably **[detaching
themselves from traditional Sovereign moorings and claims to geo-spatial
integrities.]{.underline}** [This is not simply a question regarding the
contingency of the political environment.]{.underline} [It takes us to
the heart of our understanding about what actually constitutes
liberalism]{.underline} in terms of its ambitions for bio-political
control.

**[Liberal theorists]{.underline}** and practitioners **[often validate
their actions by pointing to universal commitments to]{.underline}** the
**[shared "values" of freedom, the rule of law, justice and inalienable
rights.]{.underline}** Even the most orthodox of theorists should
appreciate however that each of these terms remains deeply contested,
masking in fact the most contingent abuses of political power. Indeed,
[there is an alternative and no less real history of the liberal
encounter, which is marked by violence, racial subjugation, forceful
intervention, and the persecution of those deemed to be of a different
kind]{.underline}16. Crucially, for our purposes here, if we are to
tease out the singularity to liberalism, there is a need to engage more
critically with its effects at the level of power and not abstract
idealisms. From this perspective, as argued elsewhere, [there is a
compelling case to define liberalism by the bio-political imperative of
"making life live"]{.underline}. Operating within a global imaginary of
possibility and endangerment, [liberalism from this perspective posits
the life of the political subject as central to its political strategies
and ambitions.]{.underline} Such a reading allows us to acknowledge the
forced compromise with the structural limitations imposed by the world
of Nations, while appreciating how **[liberal ambitions]{.underline}**,
Immanuel Kant onward, **[have sought to create a planetary system that
incorporates all life within its strategic orbit.]{.underline}**
**[Liberalism]{.underline}** as such appears in this guise as promissory
insomuch as it **[is predicated upon a political system already in
waiting but yet-to-be-revealed]{.underline}**; while providential
insomuch as **[every subject is taken to be a liberal subject needing to
be freed from whatever contemporary shackles bind it to some
yet-to-be-revealed yet destined potential.]{.underline}**

### Liberal War

#### Liberal war-making executes surgical violence at a strategic distance wrapped discursively in the biopolitical imperative for making life live -- this technology of bio-sovereignty legitimizes its own violence with conjured images of catastrophe and theological value systems aimed at murdering and depoliticizing all who oppose the current sociopolitical order.

**[Despite universal claims to]{.underline}** peaceful **[co-habitation,

it]{.underline}**[40](https://muse-jhu-edu.proxy.lib.umich.edu/article/607272#f40).
[This is why]{.underline} the [liberal]{.underline} account of [freedom

wrapped in the language of rights, security and justice, inaugurated
planetary]{.underline}** state of **[warfare and siege.]{.underline}**

[have revealed a number of defining
principles]{.underline}[41](https://muse-jhu-edu.proxy.lib.umich.edu/article/607272#f41).
**[Aside from relying upon technological supremacy and universal claims
to truth, they have been]{.underline}** overwhelmingly **[driven by a
bio-political imperative, which has displaced concerns with Sovereign
integrities with forms of violence carried out in the name of an
endangered humanity.]{.underline}** In this regard, **[they have
destroyed the Westphalia pretense, seeing]{.underline}** the
**[catastrophes of our global age]{.underline}** in fact **[as a
condition of possibility to further the liberal will to
rule.]{.underline}** Since **[incorporation in this setting has proceed

included within its strategic orbit,]{.underline}**
**[the]{.underline}** veritable **[evisceration of any sense of "the

imaginary]{.underline}) **[has led to]{.underline}** the **[blurring of
all conventional demarcations between friends/enemies,
citizens/soldiers, times of war/times of peace.]{.underline}** What is
more, as life itself became increasingly central to questions of
security, issues of development as broadly conceived would no longer be
regarded as peripheral to the war effort. [It would in fact become a
central motif as]{.underline} most notably [articulated in the strategic
mantras "War by Other means" and "War for Hearts and
Minds".]{.underline} **[Not only would this point to new forms of
de-politicisation]{.underline}** which, less about Schmittean
exceptionalism, were more explicable in terms of the fundamental
political and social transformation of societies. **[It would also lead
to the production of violent subjects, as the recourse to violence
became]{.underline}** sure **[testament to a conception of humanity
realised through]{.underline}** the **[wars fought in its
name.]{.underline}** **[Liberal violence,]{.underline}** in other words,
**[proved to be unbounded, unlimited and without conventional Sovereign
warrant]{.underline}** -- namely **[revealing of the fundamental
principles of]{.underline}** what Benjamin once elected to term **["the
divine".]{.underline}**

[Diagnosing]{.underline} the [liberal wars of the past two decades
as]{.underline} a form of [divine violence offers a]{.underline} more
[disturbing reading of the violence of the liberal
encounter.]{.underline} **[If the violence of political
realism]{.underline}**, at least in theory, **[appreciated the value of
limits]{.underline}** and boundaries, **[what seems to define the
lethality of liberal freedom has been a commitment to war without
boundaries, hence limitless.]{.underline}** As Dillon and Julian Reid
acutely observed:

**[\[L\]iberal peacemaking is lethal.]{.underline}** [Its violence a
necessary corollary of the]{.underline} aporetic [character of its
mission to foster the peace and prosperity of the species
\...]{.underline} There is, then, a martial face to liberal peace.
**[The liberal way of rule is contoured by the liberal way of
war]{.underline}** \... **[Liberalism is]{.underline}** therefore
**[obliged to exercise a strategic calculus of necessary
killing]{.underline}**, in the course of which [calculus ought to be
able to say how much killing is enough\...]{.underline} \[However\]
**[it has no better way of saying how much killing is enough, once it
starts killing to make life live, than does the
geopolitical]{.underline}** strategic **[calculus of necessary
killing']{.underline}**[42](https://muse-jhu-edu.proxy.lib.umich.edu/article/607272#f42).

This brings us to Steven Pinker's Better Angels of Our
Nature[43](https://muse-jhu-edu.proxy.lib.umich.edu/article/607272#f43).
[Reworking the well-rehearsed liberal peace thesis]{.underline}, for
Pinker, [the reason we have become less warlike today can be account for
in terms of our liberal maturity.]{.underline} [Leaving
aside]{.underline} the [evident theological undertones to
Pinker]{.underline}'s work, [along with the numerous empirical flaws in
his thesis, his not so original thesis]{.underline} at least [accredits
its all too Euro-centric sources of inspiration]{.underline} on matters
of civility: 'The reason so many violent institutions succumbed within
so short a span of time was that the arguments that slew them belong to
a coherent philosophy that emerged during the Age of Reason and the
Enlightenment. [The ideas of thinkers]{.underline} like Hobbes, Spinoza,
Descartes, Locke, David Hume, Mary Astell, Kant, Beccaria, Smith, Mary
Wollstonecraft, Madison, Jefferson, Hamilton and John Stuart Mill
[coalesced into a worldview that we can call Enlightenment
humanism'.]{.underline} [John Gray has been]{.underline} rightly
[suspicious of the entire project and claims being made
here:]{.underline}

**[The idea that a new world can be constructed through]{.underline}**
the **[rational application of force is]{.underline}** peculiarly
**[modern, animating ideas of revolutionary war and]{.underline}**
pedagogic **[terror that feature in an influential tradition of radical
Enlightenment thinking.]{.underline}** Downplaying this tradition is
extremely important [for Pinker. Along with liberal humanists
everywhere, he regards]{.underline} the core of [the Enlightenment as a
commitment to rationality.]{.underline} **[The fact that prominent
Enlightenment figures have favoured violence]{.underline}** as an
instrument of social transformation **[is---to put it
mildly---inconvenient\...]{.underline}** [No doubt we have become less
violent in some ways.]{.underline} But **[it is easy for liberal
humanists to pass over the respects in which civilisation has
retreated.]{.underline}** Pinker is no exception. [Just as he writes off
mass killing in developing countries as evidence of backwardness without
enquiring whether it might be linked]{.underline} in some [way to peace
in the developed world]{.underline}, **[he celebrates
"re-civilisation"\... without]{.underline}** much **[concern for those
who pay the price of the re-civilising
process]{.underline}**[44](https://muse-jhu-edu.proxy.lib.umich.edu/article/607272#f44).

Gray showed his evident concerns here with the promissory nature of
liberal violence. Indeed, what [he elsewhere terms the violence of the
liberal missionary, reposes Nietzsche's]{.underline} further instance
that '[god is dead and man has killed him' with a devastating humanistic
critique]{.underline}[45](https://muse-jhu-edu.proxy.lib.umich.edu/article/607272#f45).
**[Such violence]{.underline}**, in the end, however **[has proved to be
politically, ethically and economically narcissistic.]{.underline}**
Just **[as liberal advocates in the zones of crises]{.underline}** now
**[increasingly find themselves operating within fortified protectorates
as part of a great separation from the
world]{.underline}**[46](https://muse-jhu-edu.proxy.lib.umich.edu/article/607272#f46),
**[this has been matched]{.underline}**, albeit it ways that initially
appear disconnected, **[by new forms of violence which]{.underline}**
also **[takes place almost exclusively at a distance.]{.underline}**
Indeed, [as liberal actors increasingly give up on the idea that the
world may be transformed]{.underline} for the better, n[ew modalities of
violence are emerging]{.underline} which seem to be more logically in
fitting with **[the new politics of catastrophe]{.underline}** that
**[increasingly defines our terrifyingly normal times.]{.underline}** As
**[the promise of violence and catastrophe now appears inescapable,
insecurity is]{.underline}** becoming **[normal]{.underline}**ised,
**[dystopian realism becoming the prevailing imaginaries for political
rule,]{.underline}** and **[once cited claims to
emancipation,]{.underline}** unending progress and lasting security for
peoples **[all but
abandoned]{.underline}**[47](https://muse-jhu-edu.proxy.lib.umich.edu/article/607272#f47).

**[The politics of catastrophe and its relationship to "end of
times"]{.underline}** narratives **[adds another layer to our
theological enquiry.]{.underline}** As Jacob Taubes once
noted[48](https://muse-jhu-edu.proxy.lib.umich.edu/article/607272#f48),
[there is perhaps something theologically different at work here between
the pre-modern apocalyptic movements and]{.underline} the [catastrophic
reasoning now defining the contemporary moment.]{.underline} **[For all
their nihilism and monotheistic servitude, at least the apocalyptic
movements of yesteryear could imagine a better world]{.underline}** than
already existed. [There is therefore a vast difference between the
subjects which names its disaster 'apocalypse' to that which reads
disaster in terms of
'catastrophe.']{.underline}[49](https://muse-jhu-edu.proxy.lib.umich.edu/article/607272#f49) **[Unlike
apocalypse, there is no beyond the catastrophic.]{.underline}** Its
mediation on the "end of times" is already fated. **[Catastrophe denies
political transformation.]{.underline}** **[It demands instead a forced
partaking in a world that is deemed to be insecure]{.underline}** unto
the end. **[The upshot being, as all things become the source of
endangerment, the human becomes the source of our veritable
undoing.]{.underline}**

### Katechontic Sovereingty (K of Aff Impacts)

#### The aff becomes the manifestation of katechon sovereignty -- it relies on terror and security politics to sustain only legitimizes the institutions they talk about

**Taskale 17 (Ali Riza Taskale, Review on "**Global powers of horror:
Security, politics, and the body in pieces, 10/05/17)

Debrix's book is a critical attempt to theorise 'contemporary regimes of
horror' (p. 6). In doing so, it focuses on body parts, pieces and
fragments. [Looking at horror's contemporary
instantiations]{.underline}, the book [aims to retool theory to
accommodate oppressed]{.underline} post-human, non-human and in[human
perspectives]{.underline}. [Horror]{.underline}, Debrix insinuates,
[makes human matter irrelevant]{.underline}. The book comprises just
four chapters and an introduction. Instead of a conclusion, it features
an epilogue. Each of the four chapters focuses on a particular
[(geo)political destruction of bodily fragments]{.underline} -- [the
biopolitics of the camp]{.underline}/camplife, [katechontic]{.underline}
(from the Greek for 'to hold down') [sovereignty and its violent
security politics]{.underline}, [disseminated body parts of
victims]{.underline}, \[[and\] beheadings and remnants of non-human and
human matter post 9/11]{.underline}. Each of these particular
manifestations of horror is examined to understand and challenge the
social regime of terror and security politics, suggesting that they are
part of the same motion, of the same physics of movement, of the same
dynamic and fluid domain where falling, rising, falling again, and
rising again (and so on and so forth) are normal occurrences' (p. 61).
The book helps us make sense of the horror inherent in terror and
security politics that function beyond biopolitics and thanatopolitics.
In contrast to terror and security politics and their mobilisation of
lives and bodies within the horizon of biopolitics and thanatopolitics,
what we are left with horror 'is a sort of world without humans' (p. 6).
Therefore, horror is marked with a 'new materiality, a new vibrancy, or
a new liveliness' (p. 130). [Horror renders human life powerless; it
reflects the crisis]{.underline} of the human, of [humanity
itself]{.underline}. However, the book distances itself from
post-humanist, new materialist or vibrant matter scholarship since they
fail 'to rid themselves of the metaphysics of human substance' (p. 8).
In this sense, Debrix's notion of horror 'seeks to put an end to the
metaphysics of substance' (p. 8). Unlike horror, [terror and security
politics sustain rather than challenge 'the continued dominant presence
of the metaphysics of substance']{.underline} (p. 63). Whereas terror
remains a generative principle of formation for security, horror is what
'our' security politics 'cannot confront and must representationally
cast away' (p. 63). The power of horror thus transcends the threshold of
human substance. In this manner, horror unsettles the belief that this
world is only created for us, for human beings and their bodies. In
other words, what horror often leaves behind is neither a
'world-with-us' nor a 'world-for-us' but a 'world-without-us', to borrow
Eugene Thacker's language (2011, p. 9). [In horror's world, the
ontological primacy and superiority of the human no longer
exists]{.underline}. Thus, what takes place in horror [is a radical
undecidability, a critical guarantee that 'humanity's ontological
priority and superiority will no longer be claimed with metaphysical and
political certainty']{.underline} (p. 114). Horror offends or attacks
the value or dignity of the human in particular and of humanity in
general. So where does Debrix's theorisation of horror leave us?
[Horror]{.underline}, it seems, [has been monopolised by]{.underline}
two regimes: [security politics and terror]{.underline}. Security
**[politics is katechontic: it legitimises the existing order. It is the
sovereign's intent that attempts to delay the coming of end
times]{.underline}**. In this sense, [it **is fundamental to the
operation of contemporary sovereign power and its violent politics more
generally. The katechon requires that operations of security politics be
incessantly and intensely performed so that the monopoly on violence and
horror may remain within the boundaries of sovereign
power**]{.underline}. In other words, katechontic sovereignty tries to
keep a monopoly on the means of violence and horror by preventing terror
from taking it over. It sees violence and horror in the hands of terror
as a danger undermining the existing order. However, **[the katechontic
logic of contemporary]{.underline}** **[sovereignty is now less a matter
of holding back the end, than of producing, creating and proliferating
the vital forces of being-in-formation that threaten the eternity of the
sovereign rule. It accelerates rather than restrains the forces of
terror.]{.underline}** Precisely in this sense, **[katechontic
sovereignty departs from the earlier theological paradigm of
sovereignty]{.underline}** that is so central to Carl Schmitt, **[since
it wants to exercise infinite governance in this world over the
'infinity of finite ends']{.underline}** (Dillon, 2015, p. 9). In other
words, contemporary katechontic sovereignty demands an acceleration of
the forces of terror, for acceleration allows the enemy to reveal
herself and press the button. Thus, **[there is always a need for
katechontic sovereignty to think in terms of eschatological terrors, or
to mobilise the spectre of fear and terror in changing
circumstances.]{.underline}** **[The exercise of katechontic sovereignty
is thus incitatory, in that it seeks to actively produce (and profit
from) the so-called terror of the eschaton of time]{.underline}**.
[Eschatological terror, by contrast, aims to end the temporal order of
things. Debrix nicely discusses the close kinship between katechontic
sovereignty and security politics, demonstrating how they mirror each
other]{.underline}. However, in Debrix's book, the term neoliberalism is
never mentioned. Insofar as the contemporary regime of governmentality
is neoliberal, neoliberalism constitutes the problematic of critique
today. As such, [terror is inseparable from neoliberalism]{.underline}.
Conjured by the established social regimes and principles, neoliberalism
must produce its most necessary social and political enemy, terror. In
other words, in contemporary society, terror has become a generative
principle of formation for the neoliberal order. Yet, despite his
failure to examine the 'intimate partnership' between terror and
neoliberalism, Debrix's book is a brilliant attempt to theorise horror
and its contemporary geopolitical instances by showing how horror
dismantles the human condition itself. The book shines splendidly when
it addresses the possibility of 'reclaiming the horror of the eschaton'
(p. 48). For Debrix, although **[the eschaton is enslaved by the sacred
sovereign order and terror]{.underline}**, it could nevertheless be
rescued from them both. Perhaps, then, [the time has]{.underline}
already [arrived to replace katechontic sovereignty and eschatological
terror with the spectre of a different eschaton]{.underline}. It is at
this point that Debrix calls for a new notion of 'eschatological
horror', which is 'beyond good and evil' (p. 50). [Eschatological
horror]{.underline}, Debrix suggests, [can open up a new space, distinct
from sovereign violence and the politics of security and
terror]{.underline}. It can give rise to a new life in which 'neither
humans nor non-humans are recombined. Rather, some other, new, as of yet
unseen material emerges and comes to life' (p. 130). Therefore,
eschatological horror has an interruptive and a transgressive capacity,
which illuminates and actualises new possibilities for radical change in
our current age of collective despair. As an assault on the metaphysics
of substance, Debrix's [eschatological horror materialises the becoming
of a new human/humanity without prophets, connected to a new
'recombined, or recomposed human matter' to come]{.underline} (p. 131).

#### This new imperial warfare is sustained by its mythic undertones, cleansing itself of violence. Condemnations of dirty wars indirectly affirm wars that conform to the rules, rhetorical moves like the affs serve as an unacknowledged mythic "control system" for glorifying militarism

4\. Empire's Continuous War on Evil The basic logic of [**U.S. war
culture is premised unreflectively on an illusory specter of chaos.** To
regress into chaos is to reenter a dark, formless, and meaningless
void]{.underline}. [Chaos symbolizes disorder, a condition of
disorientation, a negation of life. Evildoers, appeasement, dominoes,
and containment are **metaphors taken literally in the context of U.S.
foreign affairs**]{.underline}. **[They convey the fear of a cataclysmic
event, a collapse of civilization, which prods the nation to preserve a
tenuous world order]{.underline}**. In columnist Charles
[Krauthammer's]{.underline} (Washington Post, March 27, 2014) [opinion,
"The alternative to U.S. leadership is either global chaos or dominance
by the likes of China, Russia and Iran]{.underline}." [Likewise, intones
the U.S. Department of State]{.underline} (2015), [terrorism is the
scourge of world order, a menace that can be removed only by prolonged
warfare:]{.underline} Terrorist networks currently pose the greatest
national security threat to the United States . . . \[Al-Qaida\] aims to
overthrow the existing world order and replace it with a reactionary,
authoritarian,transnational entity. [This threat will be sustained
over]{.underline} a protracted period ([decades]{.underline} not years)
[and will require a global response]{.underline}. [This logic makes a
perfect enemy of the Islamic State. The barbarity of the designated
enemy affirms America's heroic role as enlightened defender of
civilization]{.underline}. [The]{.underline} American [president
considers]{.underline} what kind and [how much of a military engagement
the U.S. should undertake against the "cancer" of the Islamic State in
Iraq and Syria]{.underline}. High-ranking offi cials in his
administration ([the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff]{.underline},
the Secretary of Defense, and the Secretary of State) [characterize the
Islamic State as a "barbaric" and "apocalyptic" terrorist organization
that must be "contained," "defeated," and "destroyed" because it poses
an "imminent threat."]{.underline} [This enemy is "beyond anything we've
seen,"]{.underline} the Defense Secretary insists, "**[so we must
prepare for everything]{.underline}**" (Spencer Ackerman, Guardian,
August 22, 2014). Richard Cohen (Washington Post, August 25, 2014), a
political commentator who supported the George W. Bush administration's
decision to invade Iraq, insists that [the U.S. is "once again up
against the question of evil."]{.underline} [The Islamic State is "pure
evil."]{.underline} It "murders with abandon. It seems to love death the
way the fascists once did." This reincarnation of the Nazis, Cohen
asserts, is "beyond explication." It would be "futile and tasteless" to
lay the blame on the U.S., colonialists of old, Zionists of today, or
the rich and powerful. No one can understand a Hitler. Any attempt to
explain the inexplicable amounts to a justification of "evil returned,
evil that can be understood only as beyond understanding." The "category
of evil remains useful" because "it assigns agency where it belongs."
[Evil simply "needs to be eliminated."]{.underline} [This reification of
evil proscribes any attempt to understand the causes, motives, and
reasons behind the violence and **thereby exonerates the U.S. for past,
present, and future actions in the Middle East.**]{.underline} **[It
stuns a people's mental faculties, blinds them to the complexity of the
situation, and commits the nation to a narrow mindset of eradication as
the only viable option, while exposing would-be critics to the charge of
condoning atrocity]{.underline}**. **[Imperial warfare is continuous and
self-perpetuating]{.underline}**. [It possesses a certain rhythm, an ebb
and flow of featured enemies, as it shifts from venue to
venue.]{.underline} With the emergence of the Islamic State, Abu Bakr
al-Baghdadi is declared the world's most powerful, violent, and
anti-American jihadist, Osama bin Laden's true heir. [Middle Eastern
chaos and extremism are deemed resurgent]{.underline} (Patrick Cockburn,
The Independent, June 11, 2014; David Ignatius Washington Post, June 10,
2014[). The rhythm of enemy making ritualistically renews war, keeping
the public synchronized with the war state and resigned to the global
war of terrorism. The rhythm of imperial warfare is as constant as the
ocean tides.]{.underline} **[The symbol of the sea,]{.underline}** as
Michael Osborn (1977) has explained, [**is archetypal. It sets off a
primal emotional response**. It can convey a sense of inevitability,
peril, adventure, and redemption]{.underline}. At the turn of the 20th
century, U.S. Senator Albert Beveridge imagined **[the ocean as an
avenue of U.S. imperialism that rendered the world
contiguous]{.underline}**. In a speech at the Naval War College,
Theodore [Roosevelt]{.underline} (1897) [recalled the "glorious triumphs
at sea"]{.underline} of the War of 1812. Before "everyman of really
far-sighted patriotism," he argued for the "possession of a sufficient"
armed navy fleet: [Those who wish to see this country at peace with
foreign nations will be wise if they place reliance upon a first-class
fleet of first-class battleships rather than on any arbitration
treaty]{.underline} which the wit of man can devise....
[Peace]{.underline} is a goddess only when she [comes with
sword]{.underline} girt on thigh. [The ship of state can be steered
safely only when it is possible to bring her against any
foe]{.underline} with "her leashed thunders gathering for the leap."
**[The continuous ebb and flow of the global war on terrorism is a
naturalizing balm. It gives imperial warfare a comprehensible
form]{.underline}**. [The tide of war rises and falls rhythmically with
the pull of the moon. One day, the news is military success]{.underline}
against the Islamic State (Jim Michaels, USA Today, December 4, 2014).
[The enemy's advance has been halted;]{.underline} plans are afoot to
retake the lost territories. **[High tide.]{.underline}** [The next day,
the news is military setback]{.underline}: "The main al-Qaeda affi liate
in Syria is extending its control over a swath of territory that was
until recently held by the collapsing moderate opposition, [jeopardizing
U.S. plans]{.underline} to form a new rebel force to fight extremists"
(Liz Sly, Washington Post, December 5, 2014). **[Low
tide.]{.underline}** [Dead metaphors impart to imperial warfare a sense
of timelessness. The mythos of timelessness goes unnoticed as it makes
war an ongoing, continual, unending struggle against relentless evil, an
eternal cycle of attack-defense-victory-attack, a millennial contest
with the devil that transforms chronic confl icts into a transcendent,
forever war.]{.underline} Speaking at the National Defense University,
President [Obama]{.underline} (2013) [allowed that America was at a
"crossroads" where it must define its effort]{.underline} "not as a
boundless 'global war on terror,' but rather [as a series of persistent,
targeted efforts to dismantle specific networks of violent
extremists]{.underline}." [The language of "a series" represents war as
persistent.]{.underline} Continuity intersects with change at a point of
transition. Invisible Hecate, goddess of the crossroads, mythically
inhabits this ghostly place where dark deeds congress with her beauty
and purity, her timeless presence suggesting the uncertainty that flows
from the coincidence of good and evil. [The symbol]{.underline} and
image of Hecate [is undetectable in]{.underline} a [presidential
speech]{.underline} the through-line of [which begins with the
acknowledgment that Americans are deeply ambivalent about the
war.]{.underline} So was Macbeth after hearing the triple prophecy of
the witches upon Hecate's heath. The cautionary words of Banquo fall on
deaf ears: Oftentimes, to win us to our harm The instruments of darkness
tell us truths, Win us with honest trifles, to betray's In deepest
consequence. (Shakespeare 1993, 1.4.134-137) **[The present war, like
every war]{.underline}**, intoned Obama (2013), **[must "come to an
end"; yet, "our systematic effort to dismantle terrorist organizations
must continue" because "our nation is still threatened by terrorists."
America's fight enters "a new phase." The U.S. cannot remain on a
"perpetual wartime footing," but it must "continue to fight terrorism."
Success on all fronts requires a "long-term strategy" and "sustained
engagement." War persists and will continue,]{.underline}** like the
line of Banquo's heirs, "**[to th' crack of doom]{.underline}**"
(Shakespeare 1993, 4.2.127). 5. Migratory-Pristine-Heroic-Routine War
[War is forever, and it migrates. It moves from one place to another in
search of enemies to engage.]{.underline} Obama's (2013) speech was
about defending the homeland by pursuing terrorists in distant lands.
[The long war against terrorism began with 9/11, sending Americans first
to Afghanistan and Iraq, then the battleground shifted to Yemen,
Somalia, and North Africa]{.underline}. [The continuing hunt for al
Qaeda affiliates takes U.S. military forces to "distant and unforgiving
places . . . remote tribal regions . . . caves and walled compounds . .
. empty deserts and rugged mountains]{.underline}." [These are the
faraway places that constitute the "imminent threat" to "our cities at
home and our facilities abroad]{.underline}." History advises America to
pursue terrorist leaders and organizations relentlessly. **[The
President's image of place does not imply everywhere war so much as
migratory war, something that travels, that is mobile and peripatetic,
that perpetually moves from one battlefield to the next.]{.underline}**
[The U.S. follows the threat wherever the enemy appears.]{.underline}
**[Imperial war is also technologically clean]{.underline}**.
[Drones---unmanned aerial vehicles---are a signature weapon of clean,
precisely targeted, warfare.]{.underline} In the insect world, drones
are fast flying male bees with big eyes but no stinger. [In the military
world, drones are equipped with advanced optics and armed with Hellfire
missiles. **They are named Predator and Reaper and used to smite evil
terrorists. The mythical undertone of these slayer drones with their
Gorgon Stare is underappreciated for its power to legitimize automated
warfare.**]{.underline} [The lethal Reaper drone insinuates the Grim
Reaper, death's personifi cation in the fi gure of the hooded skeleton
carrying a scythe to sever body from soul. Just as the biblical Angel of
Death, the Reaper drone serves implicitly as imperial America's
destroying angel.]{.underline} **[Clean war is the work of the
gods.]{.underline}** [Its contrast with dirty war is ritually purifying,
even if the perpetrators are the empire's own warriors]{.underline}. The
Oscar-nominated documentary, Dirty Wars (2013), is illustrative. The war
crimes of Commanderin-Chief Barack Obama and his Joint Special
Operations Command (JSOC) are uncovered and exposed for public
condemnation. The film, featuring the investigative journalism of Jeremy
Scahill, unfolds in the style of a conspiracy thriller. JSOC is a
"shadowy outfit" with a growing "hit list" and a presidential order to
kill. These special forces are "assassins" killing innocent civilians in
the night, "war masters" fighting a war of terror, which extends from
home invasions to torture and murder. They make America look like a
terror state, until they kill Osama bin Laden to earn official
recognition and public acclaim. **[Condemning dirty wars indirectly
affirms wars that conform to the rules.]{.underline}** Rulegoverned war
is just war. **[War itself is obliquely redeemed by the negative
examples of rogue soldiers (and the war crimes of
enemies).]{.underline}** **[Purifying rituals put the nation in touch
with the divine.]{.underline}** **[They serve as an unacknowledged
mythic "control system" for glorifying militarism]{.underline}**
(Campbell 2002, xxiii). [America's pristine-migratory-perpetual warfare
is heroic, the pride of patriots. Soldiers fi ghting evil terrorists are
empire's equivalent to the biblical David slaying Goliath. In Abrahamic
mythology, God enabled His people to destroy evil giants and to occupy
their land]{.underline}. The chosen people ousted outsized pagans from
the Promised Land. Not timid Saul, but brave David, "a man of valor, a
warrior," led the army that secured Israel and Judah (Holy Bible 1977, 1
Samuel 16:18). [Virtue and courage overcome the bluster of
evil]{.underline}. The faithful underdog is victorious over those who
have "defi ed the armies of the living God" (Holy Bible 1977, 1 Samuel
17: 36). **[Imperialism is transformed from aggressor to
defender]{.underline}**. [The mythic underdog is expected to
lose.]{.underline} [**He is the good guy, not the imperialist with the
biggest military budget and the most sophisticated
weapons**.]{.underline}

### Sacrificial logic

#### Abrahamic political theology makes possible a laundry list of examples of violence on account of their indifference to necessary sacrifices, to bombings in Syria, arms sales, refugees. Modern forms of human sacrifice by the American theoloigcla polity not only pervade our culture, but have escaped controls and become genocidal massacres, ethnic cleansings, wars and nuclear bombs

TruePublica, 17 May 2018). [The focus here is not however on the
questionable initiative of one Abrahamic religion rather than another,
namely not on Judaism, Islam or Christianity in particular]{.underline}.
**[The concern is with how all the Abrahamic religions have long engaged
in forms of human sacrifice, variously framed and blamed to justify the
fundamental innocence of the perpetrators. The same period is witness,
for example, to the systematic bombing of Syria, both by Israel, and by
NATO countries considering themselves to be of primarily Christian
inspiration]{.underline}** (World reacts to overnight strikes on Syria
by US, UK and French forces, The Guardian, 14 April 2018; Western
strikes on Syria 'painful reminder' of NATO's Yugoslavia bombing \--
Serbian president, RT, 24 April 2018). **[The period is also witness to
the massive sale of arms by permanent members of the UN Security Council
of primarily Christian persuasion. This exacerbates conflict in a range
of countries \-- directly provoking an uncontrollable flow of
refugees]{.underline}** from the latter, as separately discussed
(Refugees Per Kiloton (RPK) as a missing indicator? 2016). **[States
fundamentally informed by one or other Abrahamic religion happily engage
in armaments deals with one another, indifferent to the human sacrifice
this may ensure.]{.underline}** Blame-game: **[Given the level of bloody
violence now variously sanctioned by the Abrahamic religions, or in
which they are variously complicit, there is a need to reconsider their
fundamental dependence on human sacrifice]{.underline}**. [Each example
of such violence that can be cited is always skillfully reframed by
those complicit as being instigated by another Abrahamic religion \-- or
enabled by it in some way]{.underline}. [**This can now be recognized as
game-playing of the highest order through which each establishes its
fundamental innocence to the satisfaction of its adherents and in
justification presented to others.** While each may express the deepest
regrets at the violence and the fatalities, **this never seems to
constitute a constraint** on further righteous indulgence in such
violence or its exacerbation.]{.underline} **[Given the nature of the
game played by the Abrahamic religions, such expressions of regret can
in turn be considered to be hypocrisy of the highest
order.]{.underline}** Unquestionable justification: A feature of the
blame-game is that those on whom violence is inflicted \-- with
unquestionable justification \-- is the manner in which the fault is
held to lie fundamentally with the other (Collective Mea Culpa? You Must
be Joking ! Them is to blame, Not us! 2015). This follows from the
failure of the other to adhere to the set of principles and values
propounded by each. Such principles are necessarily unquestionable,
typically considered to have been framed by deity in some way. The total
inability of the Abrahamic religions to reconcile these seemingly
contrasting principles is reinforced by their complete unwillingness to
do so \-- except according to their own lights \-- sacred scriptures
rendering any such effort to be meaningless, if not blasphemous in its
own right. Each necessarily does the absolute minimum to explore other
ways of framing the theological differences by which it is confronted.
**[The justification for any genocidal levels of violence tends to be
compounded and reinforced by covert aspirations and agendas articulated
by some in each such religion. These seek the total eradication of the
other \--]{.underline}** justified by particular interpretations of the
sacred writings, which ironically they may share to some degree (Toward
comprehending the paradoxical eradication dilemma of the Abrahamic
religions, 2014) . [Those of each religion who do not confess to such
ultimate objectives \-- readily assumed to be the majority \-- tend
nevertheless to be subtly or covertly complicit in the activities of
those who actively pursue them]{.underline}. [A typical ploy is to frame
those articulating such \"extremist\" aspirations as being
not-in-conformity with the real meaning of the particular Abrahamic
religion]{.underline} \-- to little effect. Engagement in sacrifice: The
following is an exercise in summarizing the engagement of the various
Abrahamic religions in human sacrifice. It follows from an earlier
exercise (Systemic Reliance of World Religions on Human Sacrifice:
covert use of fatal conflict to ensure vital resource management, 2014).
This followed for an exploration of how many of the so-called wicked
problems derive from deliberate avoidance of a process which aggravates
them to the highest degree (Root Irresponsibility for Major World
Problems: the unexamined role of Abrahamic faiths in sustaining
unrestrained population growth, 2007). The point to be emphasized with
respect to the latter argument is that deliberately encouraging
unconstrained increase in the population, in the absence of appropriate
governance of resources, is fundamentally irresponsible. The Abrahamic
religions skillfully (and naively) lay the blame for inadequate
governance on all those who variously fail to agree to their propounded
values and principles. Need to sacrifice others: What then is [the
fundamental need to sacrifice others]{.underline} beyond any question of
self-criticism? How [is]{.underline} this human perversion [disguised by
feel-good tokenism and the expression of the best of intentions \--
purportedly in accord with the highest human values]{.underline}? How is
it possible that any accusation of inadequacy is so readily framed as
deniable, if not ridiculous**[? How is the current practice of human
sacrifice to be compared with that of previous empires \-- notably
Imperial Rome and the Aztec Empire? How is it to be compared with that
practiced by empires with a purportedly secular \"religion\", such the
Nazi Third Reich, or various Communist regimes? Is NATO comparable to
such empires, as a coalition of primarily Christian countries, given the
modern forms of human sacrifice in which it engages?]{.underline}** Will
the human sacrifices enabled by other belief systems \-- such as science
\-- come to be recognized as being of the same irresponsible form as
those of conventional religions? **[Will their actions, claimed to be in
defence of their belief system, come to be recognized as similarly
dubious]{.underline}** (Guidelines for Critical Dialogue between
Worldviews as exemplified by the need for non-antisemitic dialogue with
Israelis? 2006) Essential ambiguity: The title of this document is of
course ambiguous \-- and deliberately so. This is done to evoke
reflection on the equally ambiguous question posed by the subtitle. Is
human sacrifice by the Abrahamic religions indeed a vital prerequisite
for sustainable global civilization? However, rather than the sacrifice
of those in other Abrahamic religions, is it rather the nature of the
self-sacrifice required of each such religion? Is it indeed \"blood
sacrifice\" that is required, or some surrogate thereof? Nature of
\"human sacrifice\" For Wikipedia human sacrifice is the act of killing
one or more humans, usually as an offering to a deity, as part of a
ritual. As such, human sacrifice has of course been practiced in various
cultures throughout history. That entry includes references to modern
instances of human sacrifice. Examples are cited for: Americas, Asia,
Africa, Europe, and Oceania. Typically these are instigated within the
framework of cults not directly related to the Abrahamic religions. A
valuable summary of the discourse on sacrifice is provided by James W.
Watts (The Rhetoric of Sacrifice, 2011) in a work on Ritual and
Metaphor: [**The language of sacrifice pervades our contemporary
rhetoric of politics, religion, and popular culture**. References to
sacrifice and depictions of sacrifice can be found in music lyrics,
movies, political speeches, and news stories about sports, economics,
and biomedical research. It is, of course, ubiquitous in the rhetoric of
war. Fascination with the idea of sacrifice is also reflected in the
large number of academic theories about its nature and
origins.]{.underline} For the past century and a half, scholars of
religion, sociology, psychology, and anthropology have advanced theories
to explain how sacrifice works religiously and why its practice and
effects are so widespread. [Yet every attempt to describe and explain
\"sacrifice\" always fails to encompass the whole range of ritual and
nonritual behaviors called sacrifices.]{.underline} From \"just war\" to
\"just sacrifice\"? Of greater relevance is the manner in which
[**Abrahamic religions are complicit in enabling the human sacrifice
associated with conventional warfare. The rationalization of this has
been skillfully crafted through their involvement in defining so-called
just war theory**. This can be readily recognized as the ill-considered
\"sacrifice of humans\" in pursuit of national and other agendas with
which any of those religions may be complicit \-- whether sacrificing
the enemy or the military forces deployed against them]{.underline}
(Stanley Hauerwas, Telling the truth about the sacrifices of war, ABC
Religion and Ethics, 24 Apr 2013). **[This framework may be extended to
include genocidal massacre and forms of ethnic cleansing.]{.underline}**
Any distinction between \"human sacrifice\" (as narrowly defined) and
\"sacrifice of humans\" (more generally defined) merits careful
consideration to avoid any tendency to condemn the first whilst denying
complicity in the fatalities associated with the second. Arguably \"just
war theory\" can now be seen as extended to \"just torture theory\"
(Shunzo Majim, Just Torture? Journal of Military Ethics, 11, 2012; Davis
Brown, The Just War Tradition: applying old ethics to new problems,
2017). Seemingly \"**[just sacrifice]{.underline}**\" has yet to be
framed in those terms. And yet the concept **[is]{.underline}** only
[**too evident in the following:** **the massive deployment of foot
soldiers during the trench warfare** of recent world wars, knowing that
the slaughter to which many would be exposed could be framed with little
challenge as a \"just sacrifice\", namely their sacrifice in a \"just
cause]{.underline}\" **[the firebombing of German cities and their
civilian populations as being as \"just sacrifice\" of their lives,
however regrettable]{.underline}** the articulation of **[collateral
damage]{.underline}** (with its many civilian deaths) **[during conflict
in the Middle East and Vietnam as being a \"just sacrifice\" in the war
against terrorism or Communism \-- again with little challenge the use
of nuclear bombs on Hiroshima and Nagasaki \-- readily framed as the
epitome of a \"just sacrifice\"]{.underline}** the famous assertion by
the US Ambassador to the United Nations, Madeleine Albright, in response
to the question: [We have heard that half a million children have died.
I mean, that\'s more children than died in Hiroshima. And, you know, is
the price worth it? An understanding of \"just sacrifice\" is implicit
in her response: I think this is a very hard choice, but the price ---
we think the price is worth it]{.underline}. (CBS\'s 60 Minutes, 12 May
1996). \"Life worse than death\"? [The argument can be taken further
with respect to the focus on the narrow definition of \"killing\",
understood as death in a biological sense.]{.underline} The question is
whether there are **[other forms of \"death\" as may be inferred from
forms of violence which result in slavery, bondage and
incarceration.]{.underline}** These also lend themselves to more general
definition. **[In such cases it is the essential humanity of the
individual which is sacrificed, placing individuals in situations which
are frequently named and experienced as a \"life worse than
death\".]{.underline}** This raises the question as to whether such
deliberate confinement of an individual or people does not itself merit
recognition as a form of crime against humanity and, as such, thereby
constituting human sacrifice of a kind. Should those confined behind
boundaries against their will be understood in this way? Will the future
see the restriction of movement across national boundaries in this light
\-- especially when the boundary takes the form of a deliberately
constructed wall (see List of walls)? The argument could be further
extended to include the encroachment on the territory of people of one
faith by people of another faith (Varieties of Encroachment, 2004).
Sanctioning torture? [The process of enhanced interrogation can be
understood as specifically intended to \"break a person\'s spirit\",
otherwise framed as a skillful exercise in dehumanization.]{.underline}
This term describes a behaviour or process that undermines individuality
of and in others. [It elicits a disposition towards others that debases
the others\' individuality as either an \"individual\" species or an
\"individual\" object, enabling their ability to act inhumanely towards
humans]{.underline} (Jaine Toth, Hitler's 4-Step Process for
Dehumanizing the Jews, Bahai Teachings, 8 May 2017; Tage S. Rai,
Dehumanization increases instrumental violence, but not moral violence,
PNAS, 24 July 2017). [There is clearly a relationship between
dehumanization and the justification of sacrifice of those defined as
non-human in some way.]{.underline} At the time of writing, the world
has been witness to controversy regarding the appointment to
directorship of the CIA of a person acknowledged to have overseen a
program of torture (CIA pick Gina Haspel repeatedly declines to say if
torture techniques are \'immoral\', The Guardian, 10 May 2018; CIA: The
Gina Haspel controversy runs deeper than her appointment, DW, 8 May
2018; Gina Haspel, alleged water-boarder, could be the next CIA
director, The Economist, 12 May 2019; [Trump\'s CIA pick is a
torturer:]{.underline} how can any Christian support her? The Week, 15
March 2018). When perpetrated in a military context, as is so often the
case with western military interrogators, [the manner in which torture
is reframed and condoned by military chaplains can only too readily
recall the role of the Catholic inquisitors of the Dominican Order and
Franciscan Order during the Inquisition]{.underline}. Inquisitors were
given absolution if they used instruments of torture. [Currently
organized internationally, the International Military Chiefs of
Chaplains Conference grew out of a conference NATO chiefs of chaplains.
Besides the Military Rabbinate of Israel, military rabbis serve
throughout several countries of the world, most notably in the US
military forces]{.underline}. Dehumanization and \"soullessness\"?
Whether or not the individual is constrained in this way, [the
individual may be conceptually reified such as to be effectively
recognized as inhuman, unhuman, nonhuman or subhuman \-- or simply as a
non-person]{.underline} (or unperson). [With respect to the latter, this
has been evident in the understanding of subhuman]{.underline}
(Untermensch) [by the Nazi regime as describing non-Aryan \"inferior
people\", often referred to as \"the masses from the East\", that is
Jews, Roma, and Slavs \-- mainly ethnic Poles, Serbs, and later also
Russians. The term was also applied to most Blacks, and persons of
color, with some particular exceptions. Jewish people were to be
exterminated in the Holocaust, along with Romani people, and the
physically and mentally disabled]{.underline}. According to this
framework, the Holocaust would not be considered any form of \"human
sacrifice\". **[Framed as a some kind of unit, indistinguishable from
other units, any such reframing readily ensures a form of sacrifice of
any humanity \-- possibly justifying any slaughter or other
treatment.]{.underline}** A term which has been used to describe such
people by Christianity, for example, is \"soulless\". According to the
narrow definition of \"human sacrifice\", those without souls cannot be
categorized as having been the victim of human sacrifice \-- since, by
definition, they are not \"human\". **[This has been a central feature
of colonial engagement with non-western regions of the
world.]{.underline}** As noted in a discussion of Africans and the
European Soul (African Bullets and Honey, 20 July 2005), and the irony
of the current dispatch of African missionaries to increasingly
secularized Europe: One of the founding ideas of colonialism, and
slavery before it, was the state of the soul: Africans were supposed to
have none while Europeans were blessed with a hefty, healthy one. But
this duality has been turned on its head. No sooner had some wise men in
the late nineteenth century concluded that the African indeed did have a
soul -- a donor driven plot if there was ever one -- that Europeans
started denying the existence of theirs. Much has been made of the
promotion of the belief that women had \"no soul\", thereby serving to
justify the historical pattern of discrimination against women (Michael
Nolan, The Myth of Soulless Women, First Things, April 1997; The Alleged
\"Soulless Women\" Doctrine, Earthlink, 1 July 2008). Dumbing down? A
more provocative question is whether the deliberate \"dumbing down\" of
populations, by crafting media content and educational curricula,
constitutes a form of human sacrifice in its own right \-- through
sacrificing their humanity and the capacity for critical thinking. A
related issue is whether \"psychic numbing\" as a result of over
exposure to traumatic experiences \-- notably media reports of massacres
and the like \-- should be considered a form of \"sacrifice of
humanity\", however this is to be distinguished from \"human
sacrifice\". These distinctions can be explored with respect to
understandings of \"lacking humanity\", as by an online PsychForum.
Psychosocial violence: Any understanding of human sacrifice may be
understood to take even subtler forms through structural violence,
cultural violence, psychological violence or spiritual violence. In
terms of these processes, the question is when **[such violence
effectively results in loss of any sense of human identity \--
effectively sacrificing the human identity of the person, thereby
\"demeaned\". Especially evident are the use of techniques of
\"torture\" (aka enhanced interrogation) and
\"brainwashing]{.underline}**\" \-- and the implications for identity
loss. The deliberate destruction of humanity, however that is
understood, clearly merits being considered as a facet of human
sacrifice. Non-human personhood? The question can be taken further
through the argument of the Institute for Ethics and Emerging
Technologies (IEET) and its commitment to the idea that some non-human
animals meet the criteria of legal personhood and thus are deserving of
specific rights and protections. This has been most recently articulated
by the radical call of Timothy Morton (Humankind: Solidarity with
Nonhuman People, 2017): What is it that makes humans human? As science
and technology challenge the boundaries between life and non-life,
between organic and inorganic, this ancient question is more timely than
ever. Acclaimed object-oriented philosopher Timothy Morton invites us to
consider this philosophical issue as eminently political. In our
relationship with nonhumans, we decide the fate of our humanity.
[Becoming human, claims Morton, actually means creating a network of
kindness and solidarity with nonhuman beings, in the name of a broader
understanding of reality that both includes and overcomes the notion of
species. Negotiating the politics of humanity is the first crucial step
in reclaiming the upper scales of ecological coexistence and resisting
corporations like Monsanto and the technophilic billionaires who would
rob us of our kinship with people beyond our species.]{.underline} In
this light it is appropriate to note the framing offered by the
so-called leader of the free world (Trump: Immigrant gangs \'animals,
not people\', BBC News, 17 May 2018; Trump Calls Some Unauthorized
Immigrants 'Animals' in Rant, The New York Times, 16 May 2018). How
indeed might the Abrahamic religions justify sacrifice \-- if eventually
confronted by extraterrestrials, especially if they bear greater
resemblance to animals than to humans, or if the ETs aspire to human
guidance in engaging in sacrifice?

Journal of International Political Theory 2015, Vol. 11(1) 111--127

Introduction This article draws on Rene Girard's general account of
sacrificial violence to elucidate the race-thinking and related
affective formations that imbue the terrorism-related policies and
social practices of contemporary Western security states. My discussion
unfolds [Girard's]{.underline} figure and [analysis of the "scapegoat
mechanism" within]{.underline} and against the **[discriminatory and
persecutorial practices]{.underline}** that **[are fueled by talk of
terror and religious fundamentalism and that generate and target Arabic
Muslims as outsiders]{.underline}** now as a matter of course. [It
relates the profiling and targeting of African Americans in the United
States through their extra-legal and legal lynching to that of Arabic
and Muslim Americans under immigration and refugee policy. **With
attention to the creation of social assemblages or group identities,
such as that of "we the people"---of the city, state, the
nation**]{.underline}---it **[considers]{.underline}**
**[how]{.underline}** **[the growing preoccupation with security has
worked to consolidate communities against culturally, politically, and
religiously marked others that are presumed to be threatening to
them,]{.underline}** and in recent "security" discourse, [particularly
against certain mythic formations of "Islamic
fundamentalists.]{.underline}" One of my aims is to
**[highlight]{.underline}** **[within contemporary scapegoating
practices how an affective politics of fear works to produce cultural
and religious difference as racial difference, and specifically as
racial hierarchy.]{.underline}** In doing so, this article emphasizes
points of productive convergence and critical departure between Girard's
work on sacrificial violence and contemporary critical analyses of the
changing formations of racism and race-thinking. To throw into relief
the work of scapegoat racism within contemporary political discourse, I
bring Charles Mills' (1997) account of the Racial Contract that
underwrites the public policies of Western liberal states to bear on an
examination of the (Girardian-informed) **[sacrificial impulses of
retributive "justice]{.underline}**" that **[have increasingly informed
domestic and international obsessions with "security."]{.underline}**
The scapegoat mechanism For Girard (1979) and others who have expanded
on his theory of the scapegoat mechanism, **[human societies are
demonstratively "sacrificial" in nature: to quell their impulses of
violence and to manage conflicts and dissension, communities select
"surrogate victims" onto whom are mimetically projected the causes of
violence or chaos that would otherwise exacerbate social disorder and
strife and lead to the "interminable, infinitely repetitive process" of
vengeance]{.underline}** (pp. 13--14). Girard (1979) describes the
scapegoat mechanism, as it operates in contemporary and historical
societies, in terms of what he calls "a theory of **[sacrificial
substitution]{.underline}**" (p. 5). **[Considered to be a universal
feature of social groups, traceable through the centuries in fictive and
factual narratives, the execution or expulsion of an often randomly
selected scapegoat---even under the circumstances where he or she is
vilified---serves to deflect or absorb potential cycles of violence and
vengeance and to restore order to communities, particularly in times of
social or economic crisis, widespread insecurity, or
panic]{.underline}**. This sacrificial impulse may be said to be
expressed, however unwittingly, by Lord Denning in his notorious comment
in the case of the Guilford Four: that [even if innocent people were
convicted]{.underline} for the terrorist attacks in question, "[the
whole community would be satisfied"]{.underline} in doing so (cited in
Walker, 1999: 49), as if this satisfaction, alone, somehow justified the
perceived injustice of it all, and as if retribution against anyone
randomly associated with the politics behind the act in question was
itself the function of justice. And indeed the price paid for providing
this satisfaction is not lost on those who have been subjected to
so-called "miscarriages of justice" on its account, as we hear, for
example, from one of the Birmingham Six, Peter Hill, who spent over 16
years in prison after being "framed" for the 1974 Birmingham pub
bombings: shortly after their convictions were reversed by the Appeal
Court at London's Old Bailey, Hill announced that "British justice is in
tatters today" because "we were made scapegoats to please the public"
(Phillips, 1991: 52). At the time, the security discourse was
particularly invested in distinguishing Irish Republican Army (IRA)
terrorists from the vulnerable and unsuspecting British innocents, [the
repeated **framing** of which **was central to the solidification of a
fear-infused protectionist political machinery built on the allure of
paternalistic promises of security.**]{.underline} The response to the
bombings included the immediate passage of the Prevention of Terrorism
(Temporary Provisions) Act (1973), the predecessor of the more permanent
Terrorism Act introduced in 2000, and the Prevention of Terrorism Act of
2005, although the terrorist stereotypes that inspired them had clearly
shifted and expanded over this time. Similar stories---with different
characters---can be told of the "international community," particularly
in the panic of the immediate wake of 9/11, when member states of the
United Nations (UN) were essentially mandated by the Security Council to
ratify existing international anti-terrorism measures---and
specifically, the Convention for the Suppression of the Financing of
Terrorism (1999)---and to implement their own domestic laws on the
issue. On 28 September 2001, after a meeting that famously lasted only
3minutes, and for which there is no record, the UN Security Council
passed the "WideRanging Anti-Terrorism Resolution" (1373)1 and created
the Committee to Monitor Implementation.2 The resolution called for
"international cooperation" to suppress and combat terrorism, while
turning its attention and suspicion toward refugees and all forms of
international trafficking; it tightened controls over the issuance of
identity papers and travel documents and implemented measures to
scrutinize asylum seekers for any ties to terrorism, especially when
their claim is based on "political motivation." A sacrificial logic has
been repeatedly expressed to the point of being rather commonplace in
the hype of the so-called "war on terror" and its endless reverberations
in the security-focused policies of the past decade, and in the rising
tides of Islamophobic sentiment that have swept through communities and
launched organizations such as Jihad Watch,3 mandated to expose and
eradicate the imposition of "jihad theology and ideology" in "Western
societies." In the United States, it has inspired initiatives such as
the "Save our State" legislation passed with overwhelmingly popular vote
by the Oklahoma State legislature in 2010, prohibiting courts from
considering Islamic Shari'a law when deciding a case (Ballou, 2012).4
Being against Islam, as such, or refusing any legislative or
institutional recognition is the only condition of membership in such
catastrophizing communities, physically, virtually, and otherwise. Such
environments feature scapegoating as a daily affair, expressed in what
Girard might consider to be its "ancient" sense: operating at the
imposed borders and margins of the community, quite literally as a
"casting out" (Razack, 2008) of those who are deemed "non-citizens" for
whatever reason. Expelled, if not consigned to "the camp" (Razack, 2008:
7), **[the mythic figure carries with it the fears and anxieties of
communities caught up in cycles of vengeance and in the desire to define
itself against those others on the right side of a vindictive
justice]{.underline}**. As Sherene Razack (2008) observes, [when
critical political theorists speak of significance of "the camp" in an
endless war on terror, "it is in order to note the sheer numbers of
people exiled from political community, their status as non-persons, and
the fact that their eviction from political community is a legally
authorized one]{.underline}" (p. 12). **[Since 9/11 in particular,
domestic and international imperialist politics have firmly fastened
onto fear as an apparatus of social and public control, using the
specter of terrorism as a proxy for public danger and social
insecurity]{.underline}**. [The threat of terrorism--- imagined or
otherwise---has been ascribed stereotypical cultural, political and
religious attributes, which for this generation, at least, is that of
the presumptively Middle Eastern "Islamic fundamentalist," the popular
making of which has furnished a (re)newed archetype and related symbol
to carry the fears and anxieties of countless communities within
security states such as]{.underline} Canada, the [United
States]{.underline}, the United Kingdom and Australia. **[Such figures
make regular appearances in the contexts of media, public education,
marketing initiatives, and political campaigns, invariably to their own
benefit and to that of burgeoning "security industries" and private
military contactors, worldwide]{.underline}**. [Through these
apparatuses, the scapegoating mechanism is fully imbricated in the
productive racial formations that have constituted the "Muslim-looking"
subject as an identity in its own right]{.underline} (Cashin, 2010;
Volpp, 2002), [part of which includes its status as an "archetypal
enemy" (Razack, 2008: 12), readily resorting to terror, and publicly
justifiably profiled, preventatively detained or deported]{.underline}.
**[Although this refocused racism has notably different expressions than
those used to justify the slavery of African detainees two centuries
ago, it nonetheless shares with these earlier formations its related
incentives: they are both lucratively yoked to the global economies of
modern imperialism, and they remain a condition of empire's
international corporate/militaristic flourishing]{.underline}**. Sherene
Razack (2008) discusses at length how the new juridical formation of
what Antonio Negri and Michael Hardt call [today's Empire5 formulates
the haunting figure of the terrorist as the "new enemy]{.underline}" (p.
12). **[Fueled by the passions of "just wars" and enabled by the
"exceptionalism" that unilaterally extends executive and police powers,
as they do security measures around border control, the "logic of the
exception" sustains a racial order through legislated practices of
exclusion, disposal, and consignment to "the camp]{.underline}**"
(Agamben, 2005: 2; Razack, 2008: 12--13). As Razack suggests, in line
with Hardt and Negri (2000: 13--16), **[this logic gives content to
racial difference, marking those who are expendable, deportable, and
justifiably detainable as a function of a neoliberal ordering that, at a
"banal" level, empowers police to act against enemy everywhere, while at
another empowers the nation against "an archetypal enemy who poses an
absolute threat," justifying permanent states of emergency and endless
war]{.underline}**. While "color" has faded as a measure of the
"fundamental difference" that becomes particularly socially and
politically meaningful between "us" and "them," it remains a key part of
the popular discourse that articulates the distinction between these
poles of social existence as race. This is accomplished, in part,
through the popular rendering of terms such as the "American Taliban,"
John Walker Lindh, as a "white traitor," or of the "white Taliban" for
Americans found living in Afghanistan wearing the local dress associated
with them (Zahori, 2013). The very invocation of color marks a race
distinction through the suggestion that Western citizens were engaged in
a form of what Martha Ertman has elsewhere described as "race treason"
(Ertman, 2010). Consider David Hicks, the "white," "Aussie Taliban,"
throughout international media, who was imprisoned, interrogated,
tortured, and detained without charge for 5.5 years at Guantanamo Bay,
after being picked up at a training camp in Afghanistan shortly after
9/11. In a response to critics of his recent book about the whole
ordeal, and bewildered by relentless efforts to demonize him for not
coming clean about his presumed Islamic fundamentalist connections, he
remarks, were it not for my rendition, my illegal imprisonment, the
years of detention without a fair trial and the fact that I was used as
a political scapegoat, no one would have ever heard my name. There would
be no book, and you would not be reading this now. I would have ended up
back in the northern suburbs of Adelaide, with a 9-5 job, just one of

#### You should withdraw from the urge to activity to withdraw belief in the possibility of today's democracies somehow beocmign more ethical

**Zizek 16.** Slavoj, "Slavoj Zizek on Clinton, Trump, and the Left's
Dilemma: To Paraphrase Stalin: They Are Both Worse," In These Times,
November 6, 2016. AG

José [Saramago's Seeing tells the story of the strange events
in]{.underline} the unnamed capital city of [an unidentified democratic
country. When the election day morning is marred by torrential rains,
voter turnout is disturbingly low, but the weather breaks by
mid-afternoon and the population heads en masse to their voting
stations. The government\'s relief is short-lived, however, when vote
counting reveals that over 70 percent of the ballots cast]{.underline}
in the capital [have been left blank. Baffled by this apparent civic
lapse, the government gives the citizenry a chance to make
amends]{.underline} just one week later [with another election day. The
results are worse: Now 83 percent of the ballots are blank. Is this an
organized conspiracy to overthrow not just the ruling government but the
entire democratic system? If so, who is behind it, and how did they
manage to organize hundreds of thousands of people into such subversion
without being noticed?]{.underline} The city continues to function
near-normally throughout, [the people parrying each of the government\'s
thrusts in inexplicable unison]{.underline} and [with]{.underline} a
truly Gandhian level of nonviolent [resistance. The lesson of this
thought-experiment is clear: **the danger today is not passivity but
pseudo-activity, the urge to "be active," to "participate," in order to
mask the vacuity of what goes on. People intervene all the time. People
"do something." Academics participate in meaningless debates, and so
on.** The **truly difficult** thing **is to step back, to withdraw.
Those in power** often **prefer** even a "critical" **participation,** a
**dialogue, to silence, because** just **to engage us in dialogue, is to
make sure our ominous passivity is broken.** The **voters' abstention
is** thus **a true political act: it forcefully confronts us with the
vacuity of today's democracies.** This, exactly, is how citizens should
act when faced with the choice between Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump.
When **Stalin** was asked]{.underline} in the late 1920s [which
deviation is worse, the Rightist one or the Leftist one, he snapped
back: They are both worse! Is it not the same with the choice American
voters are confronting in the 2016 presidential elections? Trump is
obviously "worse." He enacts a decay of public morality. He promises a
Rightist turn. But he at least promises a change. Hillary is "worse"
since she makes changing nothing look desirable. **With such a choice,
one should** not lose ones nerve and **chose the "worst," which means
change---even if is a dangerous change---because it opens up the space
for a different more authentic change.** The point is thus not to vote
for Trump---not only should one not vote for such a scum, one should not
even participate in such elections. The point is to approach coldly the
question: Whose victory is better for the fate of the radical
emancipatory project, Clinton's or Trump's?]{.underline} Trump wants to
make America great again, to which Obama responded that America already
is great. But is it? Can a country in which a person like Trump has a
chance of becoming president be really considered great[? The dangers of
a Trump presidency are obvious:]{.underline} he not only promises to
nominate conservative judges to the Supreme Court; he mobilized the
darkest white-supremacist circles and openly flirts with anti-immigrant
racism; he flouts basic rules of decency and symbolizes the
disintegration of basic ethical standards; while advocating concern for
the misery of ordinary people, he effectively promotes a brutal
neoliberal agenda that includes tax breaks for the rich, further
deregulation, etc., etc. Trump is a vulgar opportunist, yet he is still
a vulgar specimen of humanity (in contrast to entities like Ted Cruz or
Rick Santorum whom I suspect of being aliens). What Trump is definitely
not is a successful productive and innovative capitalist---he excels at
getting into bankruptcy and then making the taxpayers cover up his
debts. [Liberals panicked by Trump dismiss the idea that Trump's
eventual victory can start a process out of which an authentic Left
would emerge.]{.underline} Their favorite counterargument is a reference
to Hitler. Many German Communists welcomed the Nazi takeover in 1933 as
a chance for the radical Left as the only force which can defeat them.
As we know, their appreciation of Hitler's rise was a catastrophic
mistake. The question is: Are things the same with Trump? Is Trump a
danger that should bring together a broad front in the same way that
Hitler did, a front where "decent" conservatives and libertarians fight
together with mainstream liberal progressives and (whatever remains of)
the radical Left? Fredric Jameson was right in a November 4 interview to
warn against the hasty designation of the Trump movement as new fascism:
"People are now saying---this is a new fascism and my answer would
be---not yet. If Trump comes to power, that would be a different thing."
(Incidentally, the term "fascism" is today often used as an empty word
when something obviously dangerous appears on the political scene but we
lack a proper understanding of it. No, today\'s rightwing populists are
NOT simply Fascists!) Why not yet? First, [**the fear** **that a Trump
victory would turn the U**]{.underline}nited **[S]{.underline}**tate
[**into a fascist state is a ridiculous exaggeration.**]{.underline} The
United States has such a rich texture of divergent civic and political
institutions that their Gleichschaltung (the standardization of
political, economic, cultural and social institutions as carried out in
authoritarian states) cannot be enacted. [Where, then, does this fear
come from? **Its function is clearly to unify us all against Trump and
thus** to **obfuscate the true political divisions that run between the
Left, as resuscitated by Bernie Sanders, and Clinton who is the
establishment's candidate supported by a rainbow coalition that includes
neocon Iraq War advocates like** President George W. **Bush**'s Deputy
Secretary of Defense Paul **Wolfowitz and** **interventionists like**
Ronald Reagan's Assistant Secretary of Defense for International
Security Policy Richard **Armitage.**]{.underline} Second, the fact
remains that [Trump draws support from the same rage out of which Bernie
Sanders mobilized his partisans.]{.underline} The majority of [his
supporters view him as the anti-establishment candidate.]{.underline}
And [one should never forget that **popular rage is by definition
free-floating and can be re-directed. Liberals who fear the Trump
victory are not really afraid of a radical Rightist turn.** **What they
are really afraid of is actual radical social change.**]{.underline} To
repeat Robespierre, [they admit (and are sincerely worried about) the
injustices of our social life, but **they want** to cure them with **a
"revolution without revolution" (in exact parallel to today\'s
consumerism which offers coffee without caffeine, chocolate without
sugar, beer without alcohol, multiculturalism without conflict, etc.): a
vision of social change with no actual change, a change where no one
gets really hurt, where well-meaning liberals remain cocooned in their
safe enclaves.**]{.underline} Back in 1937, George [Orwell]{.underline}
in The Road to Wigan Pier [wrote: We all rail against
class-distinctions, but very few people seriously want to abolish
them.]{.underline} Here you come upon the important fact that every
revolutionary opinion draws part of its strength from a secret
conviction that nothing can be changed. [Orwell's point is
that]{.underline} [radicals invoke the need for revolutionary change as
a kind of superstitious token that should achieve the opposite, i.e.,
prevent the only change that really matters, the change in those who
rule us, from occurring. Who really rules in the U]{.underline}nited
[S]{.underline}tates[? Can we not already hear the murmur of secret
meetings where members of the financial and other "elites" are
negotiating about the distribution of the key posts in the Clinton
administration? To get an idea how this negotiations in the shadows
work, it suffices to read the John Podesta emails or Hillary Clinton:
The Goldman Sachs Speeches]{.underline} (to appear soon by OR Books with
an introduction by Julian Assange). [**Hillary's victory would be the
victory of a status quo** overshadowed by the prospect of a new world
war]{.underline} (and Hillary definitely is a typical Democratic cold
warrior), [a status quo of a situation **in which we gradually but
inevitably slide towards ecological, economic, humanitarian and other
catastrophes.**]{.underline} That's why I consider Ian Steinman's
"Leftist" critique of my position extremely cynical. He writes: Yet
while we can do little to predict how the pieces will fall, we know that
to intervene in a crisis the left must be organized, prepared and with
support among the working class and oppressed. We can not in any way
endorse the vile racism and sexism which divides us and weakens our
struggle. We must always stand on the side of the oppressed, and we must
be independent, fighting for a real left exit to the crisis. [Even if
**Trump causes a catastrophe for the ruling class, it will also be a
catastrophe for us if we have not laid the foundations for our own
intervention.**]{.underline} True, the left "must be organized, prepared
and with support among the working class and oppressed"---but in this
case, [**the question should be: Which candidate\'s victory would
contribute more to the organization of the Left and its expansion?**
Isn't it clear that **Trump\'s victory** would have **"laid the
foundations for our own intervention"** much more than Hillary's? **Yes,
there is a great danger in Trump\'s victory, but the Left will be
mobilized only through such a threat of catastrophe. If we continue the
inertia of the** existing **status quo, there will for sure be no
Leftist mobilization.**]{.underline} To quote the poet Hoelderlin:
[**"Only where there is danger the saving force is also rising."** In
the choice between Clinton and Trump, neither "stands on the side of the
oppressed," so **the real choice is: abstain from voting or choose the
one who**, worthless as]{.underline} s/[he is, **opens** up **a greater
chance of unleashing a new political dynamics which can lead to massive
Leftist radicalization.** Think about Trump's anti-establishment
supporters who would be unavoidably upset with Trump's presidency. Some
of them would have to turn towards Sanders in order to find an outlet
for their rage. Think about the disappointed mainstream Democrats who
would have seen how Clinton's centrist strategy failed to win even
against an extreme figure like Trump. The lesson they would learn would
be that sometimes, to win, the strategy of "we are all together" doesn't
work and we should instead introduce a radical division.]{.underline}
Many poor voters claim Trump speaks for them. How can they recognize
themselves in the voice of a billionaire whose speculations and failures
are one of the causes of their misery? Like the paths of god, [the paths
of ideology are mysterious. When Trump supporters are denounced as
"white trash," it is easy to discern in this designation the fear of the
lower classes so characteristic of the liberal elite.]{.underline} The
title and subtitle of a Guardian report of a recent Trump electoral
meeting puts it this way: "Inside a Donald Trump rally: good people in a
feedback loop of paranoia and hate. Trump's crowd is full of honest and
decent people---but the Republican's invective has a chilling effect on
fans of his one-man show." But [how did Trump become the voice of so
many "honest and decent" people? Trump single-handedly ruined the
Republican Party, antagonizing both the old party establishment and the
Christian fundamentalists---what remains as **the core of his support
are the bearers of the populist rage versus the establishment, and this
core is dismissed by liberals as** the **"white trash"---but are they
not precisely those that should be won over to the radical Leftist
cause** (this is what Bernie Sanders was able to do). **One should rid
oneself of the false panic, fearing the Trump victory as the ultimate
horror which makes us support Clinton in spite of all her obvious
shortcomings.** Although the battle seems lost for Trump, **his
victory** would have **created a totally new political situation with
chances for a more radical Left**---or, **to quote Mao: "Everything
under heaven is in utter chaos; the situation is
excellent."**]{.underline}

Barack [Obama re-embraced multilateralism]{.underline} with logic and
fervor. The United States needed to prove that it was once again a good
global citizen, not only to uphold and strengthen a rules-based order at
a time when rising and returning powers were increasingly challenging
those rules, but also to leverage and extend America's declining
resources as much as possible. [Rushing to fix every
crisis]{.underline}, with diplomacy, sanctions, or the threat or use of
force, raised expectations the United States could not, and should not,
try to meet. [The Security Council, meanwhile, returned to its
Cold]{.underline} [War habits, meaning that multilateralism is once
again **a prescription for inaction**]{.underline}. By Obama's lights,
he has played an honorable game; he also made a virtue of necessity,
recommitting to the global order to reduce imperial overstretch. [The
next four to eight years may well see the end of the United Nations as a
serious forum for global decisionmaking about peace and
security]{.underline}. That may sound melodramatic, but consider
Frederic Hof's characterization of **["the West]{.underline}**" in the
Washington Post **[as a "hollow, demoralized, leaderless coalition of
the frightened and unwilling]{.underline}**." Hof warns of the
consequences of standing by and watching as the Syrian government and
its allies systematically killed hundreds of thousands of civilians and
destroyed the country to "save" it. "[Having protected no Syrians from
mass murder; having given Russi]{.underline}a, the regime, [and Iran a
green light to do as they wished by chanting endlessly about there being
no 'military solution' to]{.underline} the problem of
[Syria]{.underline}; [having watched the Kremlin draw lessons from Syria
to apply in Europe]{.underline}---where does it now end?" Now ask
yourself what a [Trump]{.underline} presidency will do to change any of
that. He [and his generals will be highly willing to fight the Islamic
State, al-Qaeda, and any other terrorist groups that could strike
America]{.underline}. [They will be completely unwilling to use force to
stop a government's treatment of its own people, no matter how savage,
and inclined to cut deals with other great powers that allow the big
players to have spheres of interest, in the best nineteenth-century
style.]{.underline} After all, what is most important is to make the
world safe for business. Based on the extrapolation of current trends (a
foolhardy thing to do, but often the only alternative), I see the
following dangers shaking and perhaps toppling the current world order.
A Transactional America. [Obama]{.underline} expressed one of the
fundamental precepts of his foreign policy in the 2010 National Security
Strategy: "America has not succeeded by stepping outside the currents of
international cooperation. We have succeeded by steering those currents
in the direction of liberty and justice." His [was an institutional
America, committed to alliances and organizations]{.underline} that the
victors of World War II created and developed to safeguard, however
imperfectly, global peace and prosperity. [Trump's will be a
transactional America, looking for the best deal it can get to advance
its interests **wherever, whenever, and with whomever**]{.underline}.
[UN approval will become a nice-to-have rather than a
need-to-have]{.underline}. A Preoccupied Europe. Even the cloudiest
crystal ball yields this prediction. Although I am a euro-optimist over
the long term, meaning that I believe that European integration will
survive and will prove to be a powerful precedent for other regions over
a century or so, [the European Union has no bandwidth for anything other
than its own internal challenges]{.underline}. [EU countries may be able
to pull together on issues like refugees and direct threats to regional
security, but European leaders will step back from global leadership for
the foreseeable future.]{.underline} The strongest traditional partner
for the United States, [Great Britain, is contending with the
same]{.underline} war-weariness and [public mistrus]{.underline}t of
government-led foreign misadventures [as the U.S.]{.underline}
government is. Chinese and Russian Cynicism. [Both China and
Russia]{.underline} have a major stake in preserving the current
UN-based order because both are permanent members of the Security
Council with the right to veto resolutions that contravene their
national interests. Both nations talk a good game with developing
countries, periodically presenting themselves as BRICS---emerging or at
least returning powers. But when it comes to the world order, they
**[are deeply status quo]{.underline}**. They show much less interest in
actually using the Security Council to authorize actual action (as
opposed to resolutions "deploring" or "regretting" action taken by other
nations) to bolster global peace and security. [Both are willing to
authorize almost any kind of action taken in the name of fighting global
terrorism, because their governments are genuinely afraid of terrorism
and because labeling their domestic opponents "terrorists" has proved
handy]{.underline}. Overall, however, a United Nations used as a
prestige platform by Russia and China and a hand-writing forum by
everyone else will become steadily more irrelevant to anything but
global humanitarian issues. Value-Free Foreign Policy. In 1945, [the
most important article in the UN Charter was 2(4]{.underline}), by which
all UN members pledge not to use force against the territorial integrity
or political sovereignty of any state. The goal was to avoid a repeat of
the two great world wars that humanity had endured over thirty years.
The Security Council was supposed to act whenever a state broke this
pledge, deploying the resources of all states against the aggressor, in
furtherance of the opening line of the preamble, to "save succeeding
generations from the scourge of war." Over time, however, [the second
clause of the preamble has become more and more salient, promising "to
reaffirm faith in fundamental human rights, in the dignity and worth of
the human person, in the equal rights of men and women and of nations
large and small."]{.underline} That provision gave rise to the Universal
Declaration of Human Rights, adopted by the General Assembly in 1948,
and a host of human rights treaties and resolutions commanding the
assent---at least on paper---of almost all nations. [Even the
sovereignty guardians]{.underline} ([many of them with the bitter
experience of imperialist interventions behind them]{.underline}) [have
steadily recognized that unless the international community cares about
what happens to citizens and not just states, chaos, terrorism,
lawlessness, disease, and mass migration result]{.underline}. But
although **[these values]{.underline}** will continue to adorn the
"whereas clauses" of UN resolutions, **[they will be merely a screen for
the classic pursuit of great-power interests]{.underline}**. Rising
Regional Institutions. [In the absence of meaningful action by global
institutions, regional organizations will have no choice but to fill the
vacuum.]{.underline} [NATO is an experienced practitioner of this game,
although NATO members much prefer to act with UN authorization whenever
possible]{.underline}. The African Union has also played a valuable
security role with UN authorization over the past several decades and
the Organization of American States may now be reinvigorated with the
United States finally able to talk to Cuba again. The coming
disintegration of Venezuela will test OAS resolve and offer a harbinger
of either continued inertia or more active things to come. ASEAN has
also stepped up its level of activity in recent years, which was made
easier by the thaw between the United States and Myanmar. But we will
also see more activity from newer regional organizations, such as the
Shanghai Cooperation Organization, the Asian Infrastructure Investment
Bank, and other new regional and particularly sub-regional
organizations, that can usefully serve the interests of the biggest
power in the neighborhood, just as the Organization of Eastern Caribbean
States authorized the U.S. invasion of Grenada in 1983. The United
States will be getting a taste of its own medicine, as it did with
Warsaw Pact authorizations of Soviet incursions during the Cold War. But
with a growing number of powers using these tactics, the world will be a
more chaotic place.

### 1nc alternate: necroresistance 

#### Rather than reducing arms sales we ought ot change the frame of where power is located -- the 1nc does that through Necro-resistance a weaponization of life itself against liberal theology -- methods of self-destruction not only animate grassroots movements against sovereignty, but embody the ultimate form of self-determination -- refusing to die on the terms of power.

**Bargu 16** -- Banu Bargu, the New School. \["Why Did Bouazizi Burn
Himself? The Politics of Fate and Fatal Politics," Constellations,
Volume 23, No 1, 2016. John Wiley & Sons Ltd., 2016.\] MYLES

From the perspective afforded by the relationship between fate and
politics articulated through the intermeshed logics of sovereignty and
governmentality, **[necroresistance presents an embodied form of radical
critique.]{.underline}**57 Embodied [because the biopolitical management
and control of bodies meets resistance from the points of its
application---**bodies have become**]{.underline} sites of contestation
and the **[vessels of political intervention.]{.underline}**58 This is
perhaps because, as Hamid Dabashi contends, [bodies are the "only means
left" to individuals whose lives are systematically reduced to
biology.]{.underline}59 Alternatively, I would argue, it might be
because **[the body has become the material site of war for which lives
are the weapons;]{.underline}** [the body can be seen as the congealment
of an existential statement that refuses this reduction to biology,
precisely by being attached to a metaphysical commentary]{.underline} on
the meaning of existence. In other words, **[it might be that
the]{.underline}** very **[destruction of the body is the weapon to
assert]{.underline}** the claim that **[a life without justice is not
worth living.]{.underline}** **[The preference for a dignified death in
place of a life reduced to a minimal, biological existence stands in
stark contrast to]{.underline}** what Giorgio Agamben calls **["bare
life," as the condition that signifies the vulnerability and
dis-politicization of life]{.underline}** produced by the biopolitical
operation of sovereign power.60 Instead, it implies that [individuals go
to great lengths to refuse being defined from the perspective of
power]{.underline} and find ways, however dismal, **[to reclaim a
definition of life that is always-already political by virtue of its
relation to dignity and justice.]{.underline}**

And yet, [the self-directed nature of violence]{.underline} in fatal
action [marks an aporetic duality, as the act calls for
justice]{.underline} precisely [at the same time as it underscores the
impossibility of its realization under existing conditions]{.underline},
or as it asserts agency at the moment of its abnegation.
**[Understanding this aporia is crucial for an accurate evaluation of
self-immolations as a form of refusal]{.underline}** that is
**[determined both by the extreme lack of agency and]{.underline}** its
**[intensely politicized exercise.]{.underline}** When Benjamin
discusses this contradiction in his theorization of expressive,
nonmediate violence, he intimates that **[it is related to a
transcendent conception of justice rather than to]{.underline}** any
**[justice that established law can dispense and power can
protect.]{.underline}** Accordingly, [the redemptive act must be a pure
manifestation of agency without laying down a law or establishing
power---otherwise we are back to a fate sealed by the
divine]{.underline} will that speaks and the will that is spoken.61
While Benjamin did not foresee such deposing force to necessitate
self-destruction, he did provide the clues toward the radical separation
of the order-making and redemption. **[By pushing the body's use as a
means to an end to its extremity]{.underline}** and eventual annulment,
**[necropolitical intervention,]{.underline}** like the general strike
Benjamin had in mind, **[abolishes an instrumental rationality that
would appeal to authorities to invite negotiation, appeasement, and
accommodation, and instead marks a point of no return.]{.underline}**
**[It]{.underline}** therefore **[symbolizes a desire for justice
and]{.underline}** a **[revolutionary temporality---a futurity---that
cannot be achieved within the confines of the existing
order.]{.underline}** [Without ever instaurating or instituting a new
law, necropolitical acts enact a rupture, hailing to an alternative
order of the political against a depoliticizing fate imposed by the
state.]{.underline}

"Degage!"

[The self-immolation of Bouazizi was the harbinger of]{.underline} a
wave of [popular mobilizations in North Africa and the Middle East,
whose]{.underline} immense [reverberations still continue. **These
mobilizations have toppled or seriously destabilized**]{.underline} the
**[police states in the region, visibly damaging their
legitimacy]{.underline}** and casting into view their unhesitating
hostility against their own people. [These revolutionary popular
movements have]{.underline} also [put into question the confluence
of]{.underline} neoliberal [capitalism,]{.underline} late modern
[governmentality, and]{.underline} authoritarian state
[sovereignty,]{.underline} **[forcing into the open the ineradicable
desire of the masses for popular self-determination and participatory
forms of government.]{.underline}**

#### Inquiry regarding necro-resistance is neither to endorse nor ignore self-destructive violence -- the 1AC engages in a process of *praxis to theory* and back again to interrogate status-quo conceptions of resistance and violence.

Banu Bargu's book, Starve and Immolate: The Politics of Human Weapons
(New York: Columbia University Press, 2014), labors in the furrow of
this question. **[Bargu returns to Foucault's notion of biopolitics
and]{.underline}**, more broadly, **[to his analyses of different forms
of power]{.underline}** (sovereignty, discipline, security), **[in order
to describe and diagnose a unique]{.underline}** type of **[political
practice: the hunger strike, the fast to death, self-mutilation,
self-immolation]{.underline}**---in her words, **[the weaponization of
life.]{.underline}** Bargu characterizes [this type of praxis as
"biosovereignty," a contradictory amalgam of early modern conceptions of
sovereignty and of Foucaultian biopolitics, but empowered and augmented
by]{.underline} the very [interaction]{.underline} between the two. And
**[in reaction to]{.underline}** this **[biosovereignty, Bargu
identifies the weaponization of life as a new form of
resistance]{.underline}**---what she calls
**["necroresistance."]{.underline}** [Her book]{.underline} navigates

biopoliticization of sovereignty meets the necropoliticization of

(https://www.thecanary.co/global/world-analysis/2019/03/18/turkey-takes-a-prisoners-bodyand-buries-it-in-the-middle-of-the-night/))
[to other forms of self-mutilation or suicide attacks.]{.underline}
Bargu provides the full articulation and description of the types of
practice here:

As a tactic, [the weaponization of life encompasses a series of
practices that range from]{.underline} varieties of [nonlethal
self-mutilation]{.underline} (which include forms of amputation,
maiming, infection with disease, sewing of eyes and mouth, temporary
starvation, all inflicted by and upon oneself) [to the more fatal
actions of self-immolation]{.underline} (understood as setting oneself
on fire), [temporally indefinite hunger strikes, fasts unto death,
self-killing]{.underline} (through a variety of methods including
hanging, drinking pesticide, slitting wrists, overdosing on medication,
and swallowing cyanide capsules), [and forms of suicide
attack]{.underline} (involving, again, different forms of actions such
as the detonation of bombs strapped upon the body, driving a loaded
vehicle into a target to induce explosion, participation in military
assaults with no chance of survival, and so on). (14-15)

**[These forms of praxis]{.underline}**, Bargu suggests, **[are at
first]{.underline}** blush **[almost inexplicable---too extreme, too
demanding, too severe]{.underline}** given the political stakes, even
the extraordinary political stakes of solitary confinement and punitive
excess. As she writes, "[The ends simply did not seem to measure up to
the means.]{.underline}" (7) But **[ultimately Bargu makes sense of
these practices by rethinking and reformulating]{.underline}** our
**[categories of power.]{.underline}** **[Her
objective]{.underline}**---and ours as well, I should think---**[is not
to judge these acts of courage and sacrifice, but to understand them and
what they reveal about our present.]{.underline}** ["Not to excuse or
justify human weapons, nor to condemn or vilify them]{.underline}, but
**[to reckon with them; to engage, earnestly and critically, with their
intervention into politics.]{.underline}**" (350)

**[Bargu performs]{.underline}**, in essence, **[a kind of autopsy of a
philosophical nature of the actions that produce death]{.underline}** in
order **[to make sense of them and our present political
condition.]{.underline}** [From the perspective]{.underline} of the
relation [of theory and praxis]{.underline}---the object of our Praxis
13/13 seminar---**[Bargu theorizes praxis in order to understand
it.]{.underline}** **[The directionality of her project is from praxis
to theory in order for theory to enlighten praxis.]{.underline}** [This
is evident throughout her methodological discussion.]{.underline} Bargu
writes, for instance: "**[This]{.underline}** book therefore **[explores
the death fast struggle by placing self-destructive
techniques]{.underline}** of political action **[at the center of its
inquiry in order to theorize this highly particular form of struggle in
which life is forged into a weapon.]{.underline}**" (9, emphasis added)
**["In order to theorize": the objective is to understand by means of
critical theory.]{.underline}** The set of questions that guide Bargu's
inquiry are equally revealing: "[What are the reasons for choosing such
tactics? What are the justifications provided for this choice? What are
their ethical and political implications?]{.underline}" (9)

Bargu engages in categorization, for instance distinguishing defensive
from offensive uses of human weapons. **[She engages in interpretation,
suggesting for instance that]{.underline}** these **[forms of death
fasts are not non-violent.]{.underline}** [She is concerned "with
understanding their relation to the conditions out of which they
emerge"]{.underline} (20). She is **[engage]{.underline}**d **[in an
interpretive task---not to judge but to understand.]{.underline}**
Specifically, **[to understand "in order to deploy \[these\] findings
toward]{.underline}** the **[theorization of this emergent repertoire of
action that]{.underline}** increasingly **[stamps the radical struggles
of our present."]{.underline}** (20) [We are firmly in the space of the
theorization of praxis]{.underline}: "I theorize the selfdestructive
practices that forge life into a weapon as a specific modality of
resistance." (27)

[Bargu's theoretical work enriches our understanding not only
of]{.underline} how [power]{.underline} circulates in society today,
[but also of how resistance circulates]{.underline} as well, so that
**[we see]{.underline}** the **[resistance as not simply trying to "make
life better" in opposition to biosovereignty]{.underline}** and the
regulation of life, **[but to implicate and draw out the centrality of
death as well.]{.underline}**

### 2nc necro-resistance: aesthetic frame

#### The aff is an aesthetic process of facing the "intolerable" -- only by confronting the spectacles of violence concealed by liberal regimes of simulacra can we deconstruct the theocratically justified dichotomy between "legitimate" and "illegitimate" violences.

**Evans & Giroux 15** -- Brad Evans, University of Bristol; Henry A.
Giroux, McMaster University. \["Intolerable Violence," symploke, Volume
23, Numbers 1-2. Project Muse, 2015.\] MYLES

[Despite the daily spectacles of violence to which we are all
continually subjected,]{.underline} **[never before has the selection
and]{.underline}** careful **[manipulation of violent aesthetics
been]{.underline}** so **[heavily policed both in terms
of]{.underline}** their **[representation and authenticating
narratives.]{.underline}** [Some images are simply deemed too sensitive
for]{.underline} public [consumption]{.underline} [due to the "raw
realities" they force us to encounter.]{.underline} Such **[policing is
not however about adhering to set principles or ethical
standards]{.underline}** concerning the circulation of violent imagery.
As we have shown, [our societies are flooded by images of violence,
albeit in ways that serve to prioritise]{.underline} the [spectacle over
more complex compositions.]{.underline} **[It points to an aesthetic
regime of mediated suffering which renders certain images "intolerable"
as they transgress]{.underline}** the **[perceived levels of political
acceptability.]{.underline}** That is to say, **[intolerability is the
pure]{.underline}** and unmediated **[reality of violence in a system
that prefers to be isolated in]{.underline}** a **[brutalizing
simulacrum]{.underline}**. So **[instead of unmediated violent exposure,
we are forced to gaze upon censored violentscapes, without being able to
see the dignity of the victims or have]{.underline}** purposeful
**[discussion about]{.underline}** the broader **[political
context.]{.underline}** This represents the veritable **[death of the
witness]{.underline}**, which Primo Levi **[and others show to be
integral to both a sombre reflection on the human condition and its
capacity for political transformation.]{.underline}** For [the mediation
of violence replaces reflective viewing by a consumerist ethos whose
purpose is to harvest]{.underline} our [attention, while denying us the
ability for engaged political insight.]{.underline}

**[That which appears intolerable must]{.underline}** therefore **[be
the site for rethinking the politics of aesthetics.]{.underline}** For
**[it is precisely the intolerable that allows us to break out of the
aesthetic regime of mediated suffering, along with]{.underline}** the
seductive nature of **[its spectacles of violence]{.underline}** that
are **[integral to the normalisation of disposable lives and the
creation of disposable futures.]{.underline}** [This]{.underline}
however [requires]{.underline} a fundamental [reworking of the concept
of intolerance in a more politically astute way so]{.underline} that [we
don't simply fall back upon the question of sovereign protectionism and
the threshold between legal and illegal violence.]{.underline} **[We
need to rethink the terms of intolerability in direct relation to the
spectacle of violence such that we might make better ethical claims on
the future as imagined in the present.]{.underline}** As Balibar warns:

[To locate]{.underline} qualitatively [what we call "extreme" in the
register of violence is not to proceed to typologies or
descriptions]{.underline} in the juridical sense, even given the
development of jurisprudence and particularly the evolution of its
definitions (for example, when it criminalizes rape or genocide).
Rather, **[it is to problematize the very notion of threshold, above all
because violence]{.underline}** as such **[cannot be the object of
undifferentiated anathema.]{.underline}** Such anathema is vain; **[it
would immediately mask, in the form of denial, that anthropologically
fundamental fact that violence in its diverse forms]{.underline}** (I
would even say the social invention of diverse forms of violence), its
very "creativity," **[pertains both to human experience and to
history]{.underline}**, of which it constitutes one of the "motors."
[Because violence]{.underline} and politics, violence and
[aesthetics]{.underline}, violence [and moral experiences]{.underline},
and so on [are inextricably associated, we feel the need to locate those
thresholds associated with the idea of the intolerable.]{.underline}
**[We place such thresholds in relation to a legal limit of the very
possibility of politics.]{.underline}** **[We might]{.underline}** thus
**[consider thresholds of the intolerable as manifestations
of]{.underline}** the element of **[inhumanity without]{.underline}**
which **[even the idea of humanity is meaningless.]{.underline}**
(Balibar 2009)

[Violence should be intolerable.]{.underline} That is the point. But [in
our mediatised age it needs a different registry beyond the
juridical.]{.underline} **[If]{.underline}** the task of **[political
discourse is to speak to the intolerable such that we might confront
through language injustice and subjugation]{.underline}** in the world,
**[this needs to be connected to multiple political
strategies]{.underline}** that allow us to see through the darkness,
**[challenging what remains hidden in plain sight, and imagine better
worlds to come.]{.underline}** This places remarkable demands upon
artists and critical pedagogues as [facing the intolerable not only
requires us to expose with greater ethical care]{.underline} and
consideration [issues of human disposability.]{.underline} It also
requires rethinking the classical problem identified by Jacques
Rancière, where [the problem of aesthetics has been to effectively draw
a "straight line from the intolerable spectacle to awareness of the
reality]{.underline} it was expressing: [and from that to the desire to
act in order to change it]{.underline}" (Rancière 2009, 103). **[Facing
the intolerable requires novel strategic alliances so we might
reimagine]{.underline}** the art of **[living politically in the
contemporary moment.]{.underline}** **[Intolerable
violence]{.underline}** thus understood **[is markedly different from
fetishizing spectacles and its aesthetic regimes of mediated
suffering.]{.underline}** [It allows us to counter the spectacle,
exposing]{.underline} the [limits]{.underline} of mediation [that
actually render violence tolerable for public consumption.]{.underline}
And **[it provides the basis for reclaiming politics]{.underline}** as
an art form **[to meaningfully counter the banalization of violence so
endemic today.]{.underline}**

[Our conception of the intolerable does not propose]{.underline} to
offer [some framework for understanding levels of individual
tolerance]{.underline} to the exposure of violence. [Every individual
has a different threshold that cannot be quantified]{.underline} by some
crude scientific measure. **[It works instead by looking at what is
being occluded at the systemic]{.underline}** level, **[locating within
what is deemed intolerable a particular ethical challenge and response
to the hidden order of political disposability.]{.underline}**
Approached this way, [the intolerable is]{.underline} akin to what
Critchley would identify as being [a poetic intervention.]{.underline}
["Poesis,"]{.underline} he explains, [may be defined as "the creation of
disclosure, the difficult bringing of things to birth through
seemings]{.underline}, through [words or images or
whatever.]{.underline} **[If there is a mystery to things, it is not the
mystery of the hidden, it is the mystery of the absolutely
obvious]{.underline}**, what is under one's nose. The labour of the poet
or artist is the difficult elaboration of the openedness within which we
stand" (Critchley 2010). Some will invariably counter here that poetics
itself is simply a form of fiction. And hence, [it merely offers an
alternative staging of events]{.underline} that is equally compromised
in terms of its realism. **[Such a challenge might stand were the
accuser intent on denying us to]{.underline}** ability to **[conceive of
different worlds, thereby in the process of suffocating the imagination,
divorcing the political from]{.underline}** its **[artistic qualities
and merits.]{.underline}** [An all too familiar move]{.underline} by
those who [would have us strip all those irreducible qualities to the
human condition out of its lived experiences, so its political
subjectivities may be reduced to crude quantifications]{.underline}
through which technocratic systems of rule depend.

#### The 1AC's desire to protect global peace through suppression of death causes endless warfare -- the only solution is to embrace self-sacrifice

VR)

Patočka's irritating essay «Wars of the Twentieth Century and Twentieth
Century as War» contains remarkable insights into the global civil war
that has been spreading in our modern world. He reminded us of the two
World Wars, of the Cold War afterwards, which he also called a
«smoldering war», and of those [economic developments that have led to
the «deepening gap between the blessed haves and those who are dying of
hunger on a planet rich in energy]{.underline}» and concluded with the
claim that [this intensifies the «state of war]{.underline}».25 It is
significant that Patočka did not think that this [intensifying state of
war is]{.underline} the result of an open warmongering, but to the
contrary, [the consequence of a pursuit of peace]{.underline}. Patočka
mentioned the forces of the [day, life, and peace as the actual causes
of this perpetual war]{.underline}: How do the day, life, peace, [govern
all individuals, their bodies and souls? By means of death; by
threatening life]{.underline}. From the perspective of the day life is,
for all individuals, everything, the highest value that exists for them.
For the forces of the day, conversely, death does not exist, they
function as if there was no death, or, as noted, they plan death
impersonally and statistically, as if it were merely a reassignment of
roles. Thus in the will to war, day and life rule with the help of
death. The [will to war counts on generations yet unborn, conceiving its
plans from their viewpoint. So peace rules in the will to war. Those who
cannot break free of the rule of peace, of the day, of life in a mode
that excludes death and closes its eyes before it, can never free
themselves of war]{.underline}.26 It is the understanding of pure life
as the highest value that, according to Patočka, leads to war. This
insight addresses a [problem of our modern world]{.underline} that
indeed has to be taken seriously. Especially modern thinking that in
distinction form archaic and traditional societies suppresses the
problem of death or sacrifice tends towards deadly aggressions as soon
as it is suddenly confronted with them. The Italian philosopher Roberto
Calasso clearly highlighted this problem in regard to the wars of the
twentieth century: The [Aztecs were perpetually at war, but not out of
desire for conquest. For them, war was mainly a device by which they
procured prisoners, who then became sacrificial victims]{.underline}.
Twenty thousand a year, according to the calculations of some scholars.
[In relation to sacrifice, war was a by-product. When sacrifice ceased
to be an institution, it withdrew into its subordinate power:
war.]{.underline} In August 1914, the entire liturgical apparatus of
sacrifice was once again unpacked from the trunks. The bloody images
were dusted off and made the center of attention in homes and
newspapers. During the Second World War, in contrast, it was enough to
focus on a single word: «holocaust».27 Similar to Calasso's observation
that the «[eclipse of sacrifice» turns the world into a «great
sacrificial workshop», Patočka underlines the inescapability of war if
the forces of the day, life, and peace dominate]{.underline}.28 George
W. Bush's war against terror, especially the [war against
Iraq]{.underline} in 2003, were indirectly also [consequences of the
modern suppression of death]{.underline}. The terrorist attacks of 9/11
suddenly confronted the United States and at least the whole Western
world with the problem of human mortality, that increased the demand for
an aggressive reaction. [Terror management theory]{.underline}, a
political psychology following the seminal work of the cultural
anthropologist Ernest Becker, [was able to demonstrate that the sudden
awareness of mortality contributed to the war that followed the
terrorist attacks.]{.underline}29 Patočka's insights into the war-prone
consequences of the forces of the day deserve our special attention.
Intuitively we might side with them, not realizing how much we therefore
contribute to war. We might refer to other thinkers who, like Patočka,
understand the dangers following an understanding of life as the highest
value. Ivan Illich, a Catholic priest and social philosopher, criticized
the [fetishizing of life which no longer takes care of concrete persons
but concerns itself only with abstract life justifying an increasing
«organ harvest» without any doubts]{.underline}.30 Even closer to
Patočka's insight into the entanglement of the perspective of the day
with war is Emmanuel Lévinas, who understood how difficult it is «to be
without being a murderer».31 [It is the persistence in being, which he
also called being's interest, that results in war: «Being\'s interest
takes dramatic form in egoisms struggling with one another, each against
all, in the multiplicity of allergic egoisms which are at war with one
another and are thus together]{.underline}. War is the deed or the drama
of the essence\'s interest».32 Although Slavoj Zizek distanced himself
critically from Lévinas, he justly called his ethical stance «radically
antibiopolitical» because for the Jewish philosopher «ethics is not
about life, but about something more than life».33 Despite these
important insights, Patočka's suggested solutions are problematic. By
following Martin Heidegger, he turned towards the mythical world of the
pre-Socratic thinkers, especially towards the world of Anaximander and
Heraclitus, where he discovered in distinction from the forces of the
day and peace an attitude of the night that did not neglect death.
According to Patočka, Heraclitus's famous words about war belong
explicitly to the preponderance of the night: At the dawn of history,
Heraclitus of Ephesus formulated his idea of [war as that divine law
which sustains all human life]{.underline}. He did not mean thereby war
as the expansion of «life» but as the preponderance of the Night, of
[the will to the freedom of risk]{.underline} in the aristeia, [holding
one\'s own at the limit of human possibilities which the best choose
when they opt for lasting fame in the memory of mortals in exchange for
an ephemeral prolongation of a comfortable life. This war is the father
of the laws of the polis as of all else: it shows some to be slaves and
others to be free; yet even free human life still has a peak above
it.]{.underline} War can show that [among the free some are capable of
becoming gods, of touching the divinity]{.underline} of that which forms
the ultimate unity and mystery of being. Those, though, are the ones who
understand that polemos is nothing one-sided, that it does not divide
but unites, that adversaries are only seemingly whole, that in reality
they belong to each other in the common shaking of the everyday, that
they have thus touched that which lasts in everything and forever
because it is the source of all being and is thus divine.34 Like
Calasso, whose critical view of modernity led him to recommend a return
to the old traditions of sacrifice, Patočka recognized in archaic myth
an escape from the modern state of war. Because Heraclitus's war did not
aim at the expansion of life but leads together and gathers -- as
Heidegger claimed -- enabling therefore a true peace and a real
recognition of enemies that comprises even the love of enemies.
Concretely, Patočka believed that he discovered in experiences that
Teilhard de Chardin and Ernst Jünger suffered during World War I an
understanding of the night as it was recognized by Heraclitus. In the
trenches of World War I -- in the «upheaval by the front line» -- the
forces of the day have to give way to the experience of the night35 The
grandiose, profound experience of the front with its line of fire
consists in its evocation of the night in all its urgency and
undeniability. [Peace and the day necessarily rule by sending humans to
death in order to assure others a day in the future in the form of
progress, of a free and increasing expansion, of possibilities they lack
today. Of those whom it sacrifices it demands, by contrast, endurance in
the face of death. That indicates a dark awareness that life is not
everything, that it can sacrifice itself. That self-sacrifice, that
surrender, is what is called for.]{.underline} It is called for as
something relative, related to peace and to the day. The [front-line
experience, however, is an absolute one]{.underline}. Here, as Teilhard
shows, the [participants are assaulted by an absolute freedom, freedom
from all the interests of peace, of life, of the day]{.underline}. That
means: the sacrifice of the sacrificed loses its relative significance,
it is no longer the cost we pay for a program of development, progress,
intensification, and extension of life\'s possibilities, rather, it is
significant solely in itself. 36 [Only the experience in the trenches
enabled the shaken to escape the perpetuation of the state of
war]{.underline}. According to Patočka, this experience made them
«capable of conversion, of metanoia» from «mere life, barren and chained
by fear» to a «life at the peak, life that does not plan for the
ordinary days of a future but sees clearly that the everyday, its life
and its 'peace,' have an end».

### 1nc alternate: transvalaution

#### Upon realizing we are trapped in a vicious cycle of mimetic desire, scapegoats and sacrificial violence, we can either despair and adopt a passively nihilistic position of succumbing to power, seeking peace and wealth as an escape from the world, or we can affirm the situation and create something new. This active nihilism is a form of self-overcoming that instead of deferring the role of scapegoat onto someone else, self-sacrifices as a rejoice in the agon of life. Only this type of affirmation can allow love and community to form without the fixation on external objects as sites of violent expulsion

Studies, Saint Mary's University, Halifax, Nova Scotia, April 2013.
"Saved from Salvation: Friedrich Nietzsche in the Work of René Girard."

[God is dead]{.underline}. God remains dead. [And we have killed him.
How shall we, the murderers of all murderers, comfort
ourselves?]{.underline} That which was holiest and mightiest of all that
the world has yet possessed has bled to death under our knives --- who
will wipe this blood off us? [With what water could we purify
ourselves]{.underline}? What festivals of atonement, what sacred games
will we need to invent? Isn\'t the greatness of this deed too great for
us? Must we not ourselves become gods simply to seem worthy of it?57 The
madman speaks of the momentous event but is unsure what will happen
after it. Girard notes that in the madman's speech, ―\[e\]verything is
presented in the form of questions, no affirmation is possible.\"58
These questions surrounding God's murder are what Nietzsche finds
himself both proclaiming and responding to. [Nietzsche's answer to the
madman's plea is to actively affirm the world, a world that Girard sees
as a potentially never-ending mimetic crisis, and to provide,
tentatively, a model for this affirmation in the form of his ―Dionysian‖
prophet Zarathustra]{.underline}. Nietzsche's World After God \[The\]
Dionysian world of the eternally self-creating, the eternally
self-destroying, this mystery world of the twofold voluptuous delight,
my \"beyond good and evil,\" without goal, unless the joy of the circle
is itself a goal; without will, unless a ring feels good will toward
itself\-- do you want a name for this world? A solution for all its
riddles? A light for you, too, you best-concealed, strongest, most
intrepid, most midnightly men?\-- **[This world is the will to power \--
and nothing besides!]{.underline}** [And you yourselves are also this
will to power \-- and nothing besides! -]{.underline} Nietzsche59 In
this dramatic and abstract image Nietzsche outlines what he sees as the
supreme problem for modern individuals \-- the groundless, purposeless
nature of reality - - and his strategy for dealing with that problem.60
As was suggested above, Nietzsche's central philosophical idea is ―the
will to power,‖ which Nietzsche here claims as the ―name for this
world,‖ and it is this identification and its consequences that
Nietzsche sees as a solution. [That the world is ―eternally
self-destroying,‖ ―without goal,‖ and ―beyond good and evil‖ marks it as
one where to be nihilistic is to be truthful, for there is no final
state to attain, no true measure of value. To seek wealth or pleasure or
even peace in the world has been presented in the past as ultimate
goals, safeguarded by firm role models, but Nietzsche believes that an
honest human being can no longer see things this way]{.underline}.
**[Some see that the world is ―eternally self-destroying‖ and so they
despair \-- these are the ―passive nihilists]{.underline}**.‖ **[Without
an ultimate goal, they succumb to a ―decline and recession of the
power]{.underline}** of spirit.‖61 To put it another way, th**[e passive
nihilists cease to strive to become something,]{.underline}** whether
through competition with others or themselves. Nietzsche sees
Christianity as bringing nihilism to its fullest expression in humanity
through its commitment to truth, and the Christianity of his time as
representing a full flowering of passive nihilism. Christianity's search
for truth, and identification of truth with God, leads to a sense that
truth is beyond life, in heaven, and so beyond humans. [Most do not know
that they believe life to be meaningless, but they live in such a
fashion. In contrast]{.underline}, others, a select few whom Nietzsche
greatly admires (the ―[free spirits]{.underline}‖ he often addresses),
[see clearly that life has nothing grounding it, and act creatively to
pursue power over themselves and their environment]{.underline}. **[This
is]{.underline}** what Nietzsche calls ―**[active
nihilism]{.underline}**,‖ which he identifies with ―[increased power of
spirit]{.underline}.‖62 Nietzsche addresses these few active nihilists
in his writing, and he names the world ―will to power‖ for them. He
hopes that by [acknowledging the desire for power as the paradoxical,
ever-shifting foundation of life, the active nihilists can affirm life,
rather than giving way to despair or attributing meaning to a
transcendent and unattainable end. **The obstacle to Nietzsche's
affirmative quest is the great complex of fears which drag all people
back to ultimate goals and simple answers**]{.underline}, including
those gilded with the complex language of philosophy. [Uncertainty,
insecurity, and, overwhelmingly, suffering are what create these
fears,]{.underline} which Nietzsche names ―[the spirit of
gravity.‖]{.underline} To succumb to gravity is inevitable, as all are
involved in a web of power and influence (that is, **[all are involved
in mimetic desire) \-- but the free spirit seeks to always recognize the
powers that compel and sustain her, and in doing so to find a way to
both affirm the situation and create something new]{.underline}**.
**[This Nietzsche refers to as ―self-overcoming]{.underline}**,‖ which,
looking with a Girardian lens, I claim is **[an effort to escape the
deadlock of mimetic desire, that ceaseless search for stability and
safety.]{.underline}** On Self-Overcoming \"With Nietzsche, everything
is mask. \[\...\] Nietzsche didn\'t believe in the unity of a self and
didn\'t experience it.\" - Gilles Deleuze63 **[Nietzsche's thought
undermines the notion of a stable self, and attempts to find joy in the
endless insecurity humans deal with throughout their lives.
Self-overcoming is the name Nietzsche gives to the active affirmation of
this insecurity and the endless opportunities for new creation it
affords]{.underline}**. From the point of view of self-overcoming,
[desires lead one to recreate one's self over and over, rather than
confining one to a narrow, single role in life.]{.underline} [This
stands against notions of a ―true self‖ or soul hidden beneath the flux
of consciousness, opposing what Descartes saw as the possibility of a
sure foothold in the cogito.]{.underline} **[Nietzsche posits the world
as an endless flow of conflicting forces (the will to power), taking
over one another and trying to gain new powers and
possibilities]{.underline}**. Deleuze follows this perspective when he
proclaims that ―everything is mask‖ for Nietzsche. This means that [each
thing identified]{.underline} as ―I‖ [is fabricated, changeable, and
without a definite structure]{.underline}. [The will to power is the
―root‖ of the self, a ―self‖ being a particular configuration of forces,
struggling to both preserve and surmount their current form, and to draw
in other forces]{.underline} (whether ideas, persons, or nations).
**[The self is overcome continually by creating, destroying, and
experimenting with forms and habits, especially those most powerful
habits which construct identity]{.underline}**. [This is happening at
all times, though most are passive about this constant death and rebirth
of one's self, never acknowledging how the encounter with new people and
ideas affects them.]{.underline} As Girard might put it, [we do not
understand that our desire is mimetic, that it is not ours in any final
sense]{.underline}. [Acknowledging that we are constantly destroying and
remaking ourselves, rather than believing we have a fixed essence, is
Nietzsche's way of affirming the will to power, becoming its partner
rather than its victim, a friend rather than a slave]{.underline}. This
embodies Dionysian ―faith‖ by admitting the ―essential fact of our
life,‖ which is procreation, eros, or creativity in the broadest sense.
Life itself confides to Nietzsche's Zarathustra, ―[I am that which must
always overcome itself]{.underline}." 64 The health or usefulness of a
notion of self, of a given ―mask,‖ is determined by the particular
forces at a given time and place. In the fullness of history, the self
concept and role of ―humanity‖ too will not be perfected or ended, but
instead overcome. The self that replaces ―humanity‖ is, for Nietzsche,
the coming Übermensch, translated variously as ―super-man,‖ ―over-man,‖
or ―beyond-man.‖ [The Nietzschean idea of creating]{.underline}, as
Deleuze writes, \"[is to lighten, to unburden life, to invent new
possibilities of life. **The creator is legislator --
dancer**]{.underline}.\"65 The Übermensch is [**contrasted to the ―last
man**,‖ a figure who no longer wishes to improve, as he believes he is
experiencing the end point of all history]{.underline}, the aim of all
human lives **[--- a figure who brings disaster (mimetic crisis) through
modeling inactivity]{.underline}**. This attitude is something Nietzsche
feared was already present among the privileged classes of his time. It
is worthwhile to pause at [the idea of the Übermensch]{.underline} and
see in it [the configuration of a positive desire,]{.underline} one
which is [not trapped in mimetic struggles,]{.underline} though it still
exists with them. The Übermensch comes after humanity, as the figure who
understands and takes on the meaning of the will to power. Nietzsche
argues that there have been a few exemplary men who have approached the
next stage, being masters of themselves and others (Goethe being his
favourite), but he does not locate the Übermensch anywhere in human
history. [The Übermensch is a creator \-- of new values, new selves, new
friends, new enemies, and most of all, **new joy**.]{.underline}
Nietzsche imagined that the [Übermensch would not struggle with or avoid
self-overcoming, as his contemporaries seemed to, but will take it on as
a joyful dance]{.underline}. An extension of the Nietzschean ideas about
both religion and selves that I have been examining is the key idea that
forms of life create forms of thought, whatever they may be named.
Nietzsche claims that "[Every philosophy is the philosophy of some stage
of life,‖]{.underline} 66 and it could be said further that each god
also belongs to a stage of life. There is no grand cosmic plan to figure
out, and so no absolute model, but instead many wills which seek to
justify and affirm themselves and expand their powers. So the thinking,
feeling creature calling itself ―human‖ looks to find ways to continue
thinking and feeling, and to honour those above other possibilities.
And, among humans, different humans develop philosophies (and religions)
which help to affirm and expand their particular form of life. So
warriors find a way of war, fisherman a way of fishing, and so on, each
with their own models to imitate. Due to this there is no ―right way,‖
despite the protests of many systems of imitation and order, but only
multiple expressions of a ―will to power‖ which characterizes all living
things. [So a way of life or a philosophy privileges and sustains a
certain system of mimetic desire]{.underline}. When this is brought to
bear upon the Christianity of Nietzsche's time, it can be seen why he
eschews the Enlightenment ideal of a ―rational‖ critique, instead moving
to a frowned upon mode of argumentation, ad hominem: he attacks persons
rather than arguments. He asks ―what sort of person worships this sort
of God?‖ and finds his answers that way, rather than asking other
questions about God's possibility or necessity. For Nietzsche, the
figure which expresses the God's powerlessness is a negatively
configured Christian believer, understood by Nietzsche as [an
anti-Übermensch]{.underline}, a person who lives a life based around an
unattainable central aim, the afterlife \-- which [seems to him to deny
that life has any value here and now, and preclude any notions of
creatively reconfiguring life]{.underline}. Though Nietzsche would not
see it, [this figure has, in the language of mimetic theory,
misunderstood a defense of victims (the defenseless, weak, and defeated)
as a command to remain static, wishing for a share of being without
movement]{.underline}. For Nietzsche, Christianity is a tool of control
and denial which contains a secret will to power. Yet its existence, and
its affirmation of the importance of a commitment to truthfulness and
discipline are essential tools that lead Nietzsche to his
conceptualization of the ―will to power.‖ Arguably, Christianity is
Nietzsche's greatest ally in his growth and also his greatest enemy in
his quest for self overcoming. Yet the vitriol that grows and grows
towards Christianity over the course of his career leaves out one
peculiar target \-- the figure of Jesus. Nietzsche imagines Jesus as a
worthy opponent and figure, and attributes to him a doctrine of
liberation like Nietzsche's own, beyond morals and guilt: ―Jesus said to
his Jews: ‗The law was for servants;\--love God as I love him, as his
Son! What have we Sons of God to do with morals!'‖67 It is in The
Antichrist that Jesus is given full attention for the first time,
alongside with Paul, who Nietzsche claims is truly to blame for the
monstrous Christianity that Nietzsche opposes. In The Antichrist, Jesus
is presented not quite as a hero, but one who is blameless for what
others did with his example, and who was a spirit too free for his time
(and so someone Nietzsche admires). Nietzsche not only sees Christians
as not living up to Christ's example, but goes a step further,
proclaiming with typical hyperbole that ―There was only one Christian,
and he died on the cross.‖68 Nietzsche spares Jesus as an exemplary
individual, one who did not truly found a religion, but told of a new
way of life which broke with what had come before. As somebody who
self-overcomes, and affects his society profoundly, Jesus is spared what
so much of Christianity is subjected to by Nietzsche. This admiration
overflows in his final days, when Nietzsche's sense of identity ends up
slipping fluidly between that of his beloved Dionysus and The Crucified
(Jesus) who is configured by Nietzsche as that god's structural
cousin.69 Nietzsche's treatment of Jesus is notable for several reasons.
It serves as a reminder that Nietzsche\'s contempt for Christianity is
mixed with deep respect. It shows that **[Nietzsche is not an advocate
for one single way of life, but for a single type of person, the ―free
spirit‖ who finds his own way, and so affirms a plurality of
models.]{.underline}** Most importantly, Nietzsche's treatment of Jesus
demonstrates that his configuration of Christianity is different from
the one Girard attributes to him, in that Nietzsche does intuit another,
―healthy‖ version of it. In his quest to create new forms of life after
the death of the Christian God, Nietzsche finds a new ―faith‖ in a god
he called Dionysus, who commands humankind to create and say ―yes‖ to
life, by embracing even destruction, and self-destruction (in the form
of self-overcoming), a god who is prefigured by a Jesus imagined by
Nietzsche as seeking no followers. This vision of human life, and of
divinity, is a criticism of most forms of religion which emphasize the
eternal stability of the law, the order given by the gods. Yet it is one
which, surprisingly, has strong resemblance with Girard's own positive
account of a liberating Christianity, which stands in contrast to other
religions. In the next chapter, this resemblance will be brought into
sharper focus, as Nietzschean selfovercoming is given a place in
Girard's theory of sacrifice. Chapter 3 Better to Burn Out: Nietzsche's
Self-Sacrifice What is the New Testament? A handbook for those who are
to be sacrificed. - Kierkegaard70 \[T\]he happiness of the spirit is
this: to be anointed and through tears to be consecrated as a
sacrificial animal. Did you know that? -Zarathustra71 The Gospel reveals
\"things hidden since the foundation of the world\" and through the
intermediary of Nietzsche this revelation begins to become self-aware.
-Girard72 In order to give Nietzsche's work a fuller place as an ally to
Girard's mimetic theory, an examination of Nietzsche using a more
rigorous version of that same theory is necessary. In conjunction with
the work of Tyler Roberts on Nietzsche's asceticism and accounts of
Zarathustra's ―gift giving virtue‖, this chapter begins that
examination. The emphasis of this analysis will be on the dual insight
that Girard claims Nietzsche shares with him most strongly \-- the
importance of sacrificial victims (scapegoats) for religion, and
Christianity's rejection of sacrificial victims. In Girard's view,
Nietzsche is brilliant to see this but is also reprehensible for
choosing to go back to a culture of victims. I propose, however, that
this reading is lacking in proper Girardian insight, and 70 Soren
Kierkegaard, Provocations: Spiritual Writings of Kierkegaard Compiled
and translated by Charles E. Moore (Maryknoll, New York: Orbis Books,
2003), 220. 71 Nietzsche, Thus Spoke Zarathustra, ―On the Famous Wise
Men.‖ 72 Girard, ―Founding Murder,‖ 244. 44 Nietzsche's understanding of
sacrifice can be a helpful supplement to Girard's, as Nietzsche sees
that in the time after the death of the god (or, for Girard, the
weakening of the sacred due to Christianity), a process unfolds where
each human being becomes a new sort of sacrifice. It is this process
that Nietzsche names ―self overcoming‖ throughout his work, which I show
here. Each God is a Consuming Fire Before turning to Nietzsche, Girard's
viewpoint must be reviewed once more, this time focusing on the image of
fire in relation to sacrifice. To begin, I examine two images drawn from
Girard's work on sacrifice in The Scapegoat. Girard is speaking of the
Aztec sun god Teotihuacan and his role as destroyer of plagues. The god,
in the role of a sacrifice, is killed in order to end the plague. Girard
explains the consequence of this act: If then the epidemic recedes, the
victim becomes divine in that he is burned and becomes one with the fire
that instead of destroying him mysteriously transforms him into a force
for good. The victim is thus transformed into that inextinguishable
flame which shines on humanity. Where can this flame be found
thereafter? The answer is immediately apparent. It can only be found in
the sun, or maybe in the moon and the stars.73 This image of fire, and
of the sun and stars, is one which appears in many different myths,
which Girard appeals to later in the chapter as well. The role of the
fire in religious ritual, especially sacrifice, is too vast to review
here, as is the role of the sun and stars as the abode (or identity) of
the gods. What is important to highlight in this paragraph is Girard's
understanding of the fire as both transformative, by shifting a being
from a lower 73 Girard, The Scapegoat, 60. 45 status to one of divinity
and goodness in the eyes of the community, and centering, by stabilizing
and giving the community a symbol of unity. Girard notes similar imagery
when he analyzes Peter's betrayal of Jesus as recounted in the Gospels.
Peter warms himself by a fire among other men and women, having followed
at a distance after Jesus' arrest. Peter falls into a mimetic pattern,
simply wanting to be one of the group. But his association with Jesus is
known to one woman in the group, and she lets the others know it. It is
then that Peter denies Jesus, for he realizes that his association with
Jesus puts him outside the group. As much as Peter wishes to remain
loyal, he is drawn to conform to the group, for, as Girard puts it,
Peter ―cannot warm himself without wanting obscurely the being that is
shining there, in this fire, and the being that is indicated silently by
all the eyes staring at him, by all the hands stretched toward the
fire.‖74 Girard explains that beyond the practical reasons of heat and
light, the fire creates a community. The woman who addresses Peter acts
to exclude him from the community. By noting that he was with Jesus she
implies that he does not belong with them. Peter, being alone and
confused after the loss of Jesus, or ―the collapse of his universe,‖75
is eager to join a new group. ―Hands and faces are turned toward the
fire and in turn are lit by it; it is like a god's benevolent response
to a prayer addressed to him. Because everyone is facing the fire, they
cannot avoid seeing each other; they can exchange looks and words; a
place for communion and communication is established.‖76 As the scene
unfolds, Peter denies his former master in order to gain safety and
community around the fire. Girard goes as far as to state that ―Peter
makes Jesus his 74 The Scapegoat, 150. 75 Ibid. 76 Ibid, 151. 46
victim\...‖77 But the others know by his accent that Peter is not from
Jerusalem, and that he came there following Jesus. They reject him in
order to maintain the order strengthened and founded by the scapegoat
mechanism. They tell each other, ―We are all of the same clan, we form
one and the same group inasmuch as we have the same scapegoat.‖78 To
return to Teotihuacan, let us consider the similarity between the fire
and the god. The fire plays the role of illuminating and defining the
boundaries of the community, and the great fire of the sun does this to
an even greater degree, doing the same for the world. When the role of a
sacrificed god like Teotihuacan is compared to a star or sun, the
exaggeration shows how important the role is \-- this god's sacrifice
(that which makes sacred) has given order, and so a secure life, to the
community, even to the world. The sacrificed god, despite the myths that
surround him, is for Girard definitely a victim, one who was rejected
violently. When Peter seeks to join the community by rejecting Jesus, he
wants to defer this role of scapegoat. Not only does Peter wish to avoid
pain, insecurity, and possible death, but, as Girard astutely notes,
shame. ―Peter is ashamed of this Jesus whom all the world despises,
ashamed of the model he chose, and therefore ashamed of himself.‖79
People often seek to avoid being rejected by their community in some
way, and so betray certain commitments they have made. At the level of
the grand, divine sacrifice of a Teotihuacan, those like Peter imagine
that the god must have had some special power to be able to give his own
life for the good of the community, something Peter 77 Ibid, 154. 78
Ibid. 79 Ibid, 155. 47 cannot imagine having. For Girard this special
power, this true being, is what we seek when we imitate others. The
myths of those like Teotihuacan are a lie in that the victim did not
choose to give himself for the cure of a plague, but instead was killed
to found a new community (or to renew one). The Gospel account of Jesus
is, in contrast to this, a ―true myth‖ in that it takes the same tale
and reveals that the victim-god, the scapegoat, is innocent of any
collective guilt, and did not want to become sacrifice for the
community. Jesus is the only scapegoat to show this truth to his
followers \-- the sacrifice to end sacrifices. In doing so he founds a
community of rejects, of wanderers whose center is elsewhere and
invisible. But with such sacrifices ended, or at least encouraged to
end, after this revelation, how is a community to be built? How is it to
renew itself? For Girard this question remains unanswered in any
concrete manner, and the great proliferation of answers put forward in
the period after Christianity's ascent, and especially in the modern
period, are a consequence of this revelation. The old ways fail not
because they have no strength, but because: Henceforth we can no longer
pretend not to know that the social order is built upon the blood of
innocent victims. Christianity deprives us of the mechanism that formed
the basis of the archaic social and religious order, ushering in a new
phase in the history of mankind that we may legitimately call ―modern.‖
All the conquests of modernity begin there, as far as I am concerned,
from that acquisition of awareness within Christianity.80 So the Gospels
slowly remove the community's ability to build new ―fires‖ from victims
by removing the ability to believe in the absolute power of those fires,
and we return again to the loss of a stable self, both for the community
and for persons. When 80 Girard, Christianity, Truth, and Weakening
Faith, 26. 48 Girard discusses Nietzsche's approach to such victimage,
he notices, with some (perhaps smirking) contempt that, ―\[n\]ot without
coquetry he protests against his future canonization, but he prepares
the way for it by setting out to become a living scandal. He behaves
like a proper sacrificial beast.\"81 Girard is quite correct here.
Nietzsche does indeed behave like a sacrifice, one who knows he is a
sacrifice and one who will be ―canonized,‖ in other words, added to a
list of those to imitate, a fire worthy of a community's respect and
devotion. Giving Birth to a Dancing Star One must still have chaos
within oneself, to give birth to a dancing star! - Zarathustra82 Indeed,
we philosophers\" and \"free spirits\" feel, when we hear the news that
\"the old god is dead,\" as if a new dawn shone on us; our heart
overflows with gratitude, amazement, premonitions, expectations. At long
last the horizon appears free to us again, even if it should not be
bright; at long last our ships may venture out again, venture out to
face any danger; all the daring of the lover of knowledge is permitted
again; the sea, our sea, lies open again; perhaps there has never yet
been such an \"open sea.\" - Nietzsche83 Both in the voice of
Zarathustra and under his own name, [Nietzsche speaks of the joyous and
terrifying freedom created in the wake of God's death.]{.underline} With
the idea of both god and sacrifice as a fire still in mind, consider
that **[Nietzsche's admonitions to overcome humanity, as well as one's
self, are in a sense a call to self-sacrifice]{.underline}**. **[The
great ―open sea‖ of the world cries out for each person to act as a
sacrifice, a makingsacred of human life, a fire to build around and to
create new values.]{.underline}** Where **[typically ―self sacrifice‖ is
understood as oriented towards some definite future goal or the
preservation of the status quo, this self-overcoming wishes to
continually find new joy along with new suffering.]{.underline}** To
Nietzsche **[each person should burn, voluntarily, rather than deferring
the role of scapegoat to another individual.]{.underline}** As Girard
often emphasizes,84 Nietzsche does not use religious, and specifically
Christian, terms and tropes by accident. Nietzsche's world is saturated
by Christianity, and so the themes he uses are direct from the
mythological playbook, including, as Tyler Roberts puts it ―[the
discovery of a deep-seated sickness unto death; scales falling from
eyes; brave and bleak periods of isolation; daily martyrdoms; the bite
of hardheartedness, of discipline and desire; the flaming spirit; and,
finally, the grace of renewal where one finds one\'s life and one\'s
world transformed]{.underline}.‖85 It is of course the ―flaming spirit‖
that is most interesting here, and especially its link to Christianity:
\"Like the desert ascetics of early Christianity, Nietzsche seeks the
transfiguration of the body into flaming spirit.\"86 The sacrificial
Christianity that Girard describes is the historical struggle wherein
the old way of [a sacred center, with which both desire and violence can
be channeled, is slowly overtaken by the realization that the old way
and its accompanying role models are contingent]{.underline}, that there
is ―no Greek or Jew‖ in Christ, which leads to a great freedom. [But to
live out freedom, one must still, even after this
realization,]{.underline} choose and build order \-- and so, as Girard
shows us, [one must sacrifice]{.underline}. If the revelation of
Christianity begins to become self-aware in Nietzsche, as Girard claims,
it is found most clearly in Nietzsche's efforts **[to
sacrifice]{.underline}** (that is, ―make sacred‖) his **[self
continually, rather than allowing an external object to be the site of
violent expulsion]{.underline}**. **[In the process of this continual
self-sacrifice, Nietzsche oscillates between a return to a purely
competitive agon where the enemy is expelled, and one rooted in love,
where each friend and enemy is both helped to grow and is helpful to
growth.]{.underline}** Roberts emphasizes the latter when he states:
\"**[Love]{.underline}**, as Nietzsche understands it, **[is a rejoicing
in the other, a directionality toward or desire for the other manifested
in creative giving]{.underline}**.\"87 Girard is right to warn against
the Nietzsche who wants to paradoxically reinstate the old order of rank
and death, aided by reading in Darwinian ideas popular at the time. Yet
he ought to apply his own theory of Christianity's dialogue with the
violent sacred to Nietzsche, which would clarify Nietzsche's role for
his thought. The struggle between a ―bad‖ mimetic desire of the closed
system and the ―good‖ mimetic desire of Girard's nonsacrificial
Christianity is embodied explosively in Nietzsche's life and writing. At
one level, Girard knows Nietzsche rejects a caricature of Christianity,
not the \"real thing.\" At the same time, Girard\'s most consistent
statements attribute to Nietzsche a knowing rejection of the
Judeo-Christian revelation in favour of violence. This rejection is
present, yet it is not as informed as Girard suggests, as Nietzsche's
disdain for victims comes from a vision of pity and victims rooted in a
sacrificial Christianity, as Girard would put it. From Nietzsche's
viewpoint, [victims are praised for remaining victims, for waiting in
devotion to a \"sickly\" reproduction of a Girardian \"archaic
religion,\" one which continues using the logic of the scapegoat, but
does not allow for any movement or resolution to conflicts, as
scapegoating is now shameful.]{.underline} Such a Christianity, which 87
Ibid, 195. 51 punishes the strong and aggressive while telling the poor
and weak to remain in that state, is rightfully condemned. Had Nietzsche
been able to conceive of a Christianity which includes Jesus\' \"good
news\" and a Jesus whose message included a community rather than only
individuals (\"idiots,\" like Nietzsche\'s childlike Christ),88 he might
have arrived at views closer to Girard\'s. An emphasis on incarnation
(the body) and divinity (as a creative joy), something more akin to a
theosis, would match Nietzsche\'s longings. Roberts makes this point
eloquently, sketching the sort of theology that approaches Nietzsche\'s
Dionysus: \...a theology of the Cross can affirm a God who suffers with
humanity, who is immersed, out of love, in the world-reality of the
human. This God is closer to the repeated suffering and dying of
Nietzsche\'s Dionysus than the impassible God who supports the dualism
of the ascetic ideal. Contrary to Nietzsche\'s assertion, such a
mystical theology would find in the imitation of Christ on the Cross not
a means to another life, but an expression of love for this life \-- a
life in which [the deepest suffering is intimately connected with the
deepest affirmation]{.underline}.89 The dualism that Roberts refers to
here maps onto Nietzsche's rejection of an otherworldly source of
meaning and redemption for life. The incarnate god seeks not to condemn
or give up on life, as Nietzsche fears, but instead to inspire
recognition of the continual self-sacrifice each person must undergo in
affirming life, which is both death and resurrection. To follow Christ
becomes, in Nietzschean terms, a process of continual, affirmative
self-overcoming. 88 ―Idiot‖ understood as one who does not belong to a
community. As Bruce Ellis Benson notes in Pious Nietzsche, the Jesus
portrayed in The Antichrist seems to be similar to the protagonist of
Doestoevsky's The Idiot. 89 Roberts, Contesting Spirit, 183. 52 Further,
Roberts identifies his analysis of Nietzsche with a \"metaphoric
postmodernity\" which can easily be allied with Girard\'s work:
\"Whereas analytic postmodernity relegates all significations to the
ultimately meaningless play of signifiers, metaphoric postmodernity
reconnects the signifier to the signified through the body:
signification is not purely linguistic; it is somatic, it speaks
desire.\"90 The emphasis on \"the body\" which \"speaks desire,\" beyond
the purely linguistic, is just what a Girardian account seeks to recover
in its emphasis on \"the truth of the victim.‖ Missing from this
insight, exemplified by the death of Jesus on the cross, is what could
be called the \"truth of the resurrected\" \-- that is, the truth of
those who have overcome being a victim used for others' ―salvation,‖ and
instead taken on an identity as living flame. The being who has followed
a \"holy desire\" in a community she loves and desires to flourish is
[the rehabilitated victim who endures anguish and pain, never denying it
in favour of some static \"victory\" or \"other world.\"]{.underline}
**[The victim's body, Nietzsche\'s body, and the body of the community,
all speak and grow in desire, and all imitate each other in continuous,
joyous creation by living, growing, and suffering without need of a
transcendent guarantee,]{.underline}** instead becoming flaming spirit.
Nietzsche misses this most difficult challenge of engaging with others
due to his great nausea in the face of human laziness and contempt, and
a refusal to follow a god of pity, along with his own deep loneliness.91
He remains caught between his contempt for the Christian society of his
day and his love of an idealized ancient Greece, neither of which he can
truly affirm. In seeking to affirm life in an era which seems to idolize
the weak and passive, he moves past his own teaching, the affirmation of
everything, and decides to negate once more: ―The weak and the failures
shall perish: first principle of our love of man. And they shall even be
given every possible assistance.‖92 This statement from Nietzsche
immediately brings to mind the charges of proto-Naziism often brought
against him. As Tobin Siebers suggests, Nietzsche, if he is to be
consistent, would need to affirm even Christianity93 and ―the weak and
failures,‖ along with all aspects of life. For him **[to create a world
where those who are intent on self-overcoming could flourish would
involve not a new set of masters, but a new ethic of
partnership]{.underline}**, one that we catch a glimpse of in
Nietzsche's own insight about religious community. **[In such a
community]{.underline}** he sees that: \"**[Love gives the greatest
feeling of power]{.underline}**. To grasp to what extent not man in
general but a certain species of man speaks here\....this means [no
morality, obedience or activity produces that feeling of power that love
produces; one does nothing bad from love, one does much more than one
would do from obedience and virtue]{.underline}\... **[Being helpful and
useful and caring for others continually arouses the feeling of
power]{.underline}**.\"94 Yet Nietzsche rejected this community, despite
seeming to understand it, and came to embody the violent and ugly
aspects of sacrifice in himself rather than its unitive and joyous ones.
Christopher Hamilton writes that Nietzsche: believed that to have a
sense of such a fellowship was to reject the world in all its morally
suspect manner. And he believed that to do this would be to reject the
standing conditions of life in the only way we humans can live it, that
is, as a life involving much that is morally reprehensible. For
Nietzsche, that thought was disgusting, unworthy of human beings. He was
trapped between a sense of common fellowship with other human beings,
and a desire to affirm life as it actually is. Unable to do either, he
tyrannized over his own nature, exercising, but seeking thereby to
exorcise, the asceticism he abhorred, and murdering God in the
process.95 In Hamilton's assessment we find another confirmation of
Nietzsche's ascetic nature, cloaked though it may be in the rejection of
the old God. Nietzsche acts as the sacrificer and sacrifice, the
―worshipper and worshipped‖ as Girard elsewhere claims, insofar as he
does constantly overcome (sacrifice) himself, or at least struggles to
do so.96 How this consistent self-overcoming is to be maintained while
still respecting and interacting with others is unclear to Nietzsche \--
he is trapped and alone because of his constant quest for a purely
individual freedom and power, the only way he sees to ―affirm life as it
actually is.‖ The Lonely Sun When this disgust for human fellowship
comes out in Nietzsche's work, it stands in contrast to the passages
where Nietzsche, or at least his creation Zarathustra, emphasizes the
great value of friendship and gift giving. Two scholars have recently
examined this in relation to politics, Romand Coles97 and Katrin
Froese.98 Both examine 95 Hamilton, ―Murder of God,‖ 179. 96 This
loneliness and rejection of community, and their connection with
Nietzsche's sense of reality, are also taken up in Giles Fraser's
Redeeming Nietzsche, the theme of gift and giving in Nietzsche's Thus
Spoke Zarathustra. Zarathustra can be seen as a sort of proto-Übermensch
who acts out Nietzsche's ideal life (which is notably one still built on
tragedy, comedy, and an appreciation for Christian symbolism). Coles
focuses on the section of Zarathustra concerning ―**[The Gift Giving
Virtue]{.underline}**,‖ which Coles notes **[is the ―highest
virtue‖]{.underline}** according to Zarathustra. The attitude here is
**[one who gives out of fullness, who is compassionate in a sense which
is positive for Nietzsche, rather than the parasitic]{.underline}**
―pity‖ which he attributes to the popular morality of his time. Coles
also focuses on an image of fire in Nietzsche's work, the sun, and
connects it to this virtue.99 [The great star, which burns and freely
gives to the world, is what Zarathustra strives to be like. In keeping
with the theme of self overcoming as self sacrifice, the sun burns and
gives.]{.underline} It is a star like so many other gods \-- steady,
brilliant, and without need of support. Yet it is obvious that
[Zarathustra does not see an end to strife in the gift-giving virtue,
but rather a noble way of negotiating with it,]{.underline} as Coles
notes. How can one become the ―dancing star‖ Zarathustra wishes to be
without a dancing partner, without others? **[To give and give without
receiving would leave one ―giving‖ without any notion of what is
received, or of who is receiving]{.underline}**. More than this, the
selfovercoming which Nietzsche assumes is necessary for life would seem
to have no place. In Froese's work this is accounted for in her reading
of Nietzsche's concept of eternal return as the great interconnectedness
of all things.100 This interconnection is held in tension with
Nietzsche's own aristocratic politics which he builds upon the notion of
will to power. As Nietzsche sees it, a will always seeks a stable
sovereignty, or, to put it another way, to be a star. Froese points out
that Zarathustra's comments on friendship indicate the best are those
wherein ―each stimulates the other's development and rather than a
self-sustaining god dictating to another mortal. The porous self that
Nietzsche acknowledges is one which can never really become a ―sun‖ or
―star‖ \-- or rather, it can only become such a celestial body for those
who are kept far away and who do not examine it too closely. This is a
recreation of the image of the ―lords‖ on high in relation to the
servants and slaves who take the gifts (and commands) of the god.
Froese's emphasis on the fluid nature of the Nietzschean self, along
with the interconnection of life as an eternal return, shows the
weakness of Nietzsche's politics, which lack imagination. Both Coles and
Froese see in the gift giving virtue the potential for another path in
Nietzsche, one which Nietzsche himself did not follow, likely out of his
stubborn loneliness**[. In this vision Zarathustra does find the
companions he seeks, and more than this, helps create a style of life
and community which encourages the generosity and agon which is so
difficult to maintain]{.underline}**. Julian Young, in his effort to
reconstruct a proposed folk religion from Nietzsche's writing, suggests
that [the community]{.underline} which Nietzsche did imagine was one
which [gave positive role models for many different classes of people,
held together by the pia fraus of the philosophers]{.underline}.102

Like sovereignty on the national level, for Schmitt the [process of
bracketing war is therefore 'simultaneously the vehicle for peace and
war, for life and death']{.underline},64 just that here, [peace and war
are both internal characteristics of order]{.underline}. It is the [laws
of war, rather than the state]{.underline} form, which should thus be
described as a [hinge for plural order in which radical disagreements
remain as much a possibility as peace]{.underline}. In Düttmann's terms,
one might say that [each time war breaks out]{.underline} in such an
order and remains limited, [the order is reconfirmed]{.underline} at the
very same time as it is disturbed or 'interrupted' by war: \[O\]rder65
is not the solid ground of recognition, which gives the recognising and
the recognised entities existence. [It is a relation, a belonging
together of the incompatible, which does not let itself be grasped
together and which one therefore cannot grasp as unity; it is a relation
of restraint, a separating, un-seemly belongingness, which interrupts
its own unity.]{.underline}66 To return to presocratic cosmology, if
moira made an order possible in which a 'brotherhood' of elements
continuously fought each other, it must have been concerned with the
limitation of war rather than with the limitation of the elements. Such
[wars were represented by 'things']{.underline}, instances of war,
which, according to Anaximander, came into being [when elements
overstepped their established boundaries, encroaching on another's
territory. Things were made up of several elements, but they did not
exist permanently]{.underline}, as eventually each part of a thing had
to return to its element.67 'Into that from which things take their rise
they pass away once more, as is ordained, for they make reparation and
satisfaction to one another for their injustice according to the
ordering of time'.68 It was moira that ensured this return -- not by
ordaining that the elements had to stay within their boundaries (if it
had done so, wars would not have existed), but that if the elements did
transgress their boundaries, they did so while leaving the overall order
intact. As Bertrand Russell writes: The thought which Anaximander is
expressing seems to be this: there should be a [certain proportion of
fire, of earth, and of water in the world, but each element (perceived
as a god) is perpetually attempting to enlarge its empire. But there is
a kind of necessity or natural law which perpetually redresses that
balance]{.underline}.69 As natural law, [moira ordained what was both
necessary and just, without thereby either bringing into being a realm
of necessity or implementing a substantive vision of justice. By
limiting war, it ensured that the balance of the order was open to
negotiation, but that the existence of each element, and thus the plural
nature of the overall order, was never itself under threat. In this
order, a final notion of justice, of summer as against winter, hot
against cold, was continuously postponed, remaining to be worked out in
yet another clash of forces. Schmitt calls the process of limiting war
Hegung]{.underline}, a term that would perhaps pass as unremarkable were
it not for Schmitt's reference to its spatial connotations and his
attempt to associate these with nomos. Schmitt clearly sees the
significance of limiting war for the European order, but chooses to
ascribe its effects to nomos. The concept of Hegung, however, deserves
an analysis of its own. The word Hegung -- still reflected by the
current German phrase hegen und pflegen, perhaps best translated as 'to
hold and cherish' -- refers to the [delimitation or containment of
something]{.underline}, initially space, in order [to protect it from
adverse outside influences.]{.underline} The term is still mainly used
in its verbal form hegen, of which the English form is given in the
brothers Grimm's dictionary as the verb 'hedge'.70 Primarily, therefore,
Hegung refers to a process of containing something, not the container or
enclosure itself. Otto Gönnenwein and Wilhelm Weizsäcker accordingly
list the verbal meaning of Hegung before its meaning as the bracketed
space itself, ie, the space won through the erection of fencing that is
Hegung. 71 Given its aim of protection, it follows that the process of
Hegung is used whenever something is vulnerable, if not altogether
precious, therefore warranting such protection. This is true of
forestry, where it is young trees that become the object of Hegung, and
also of hunting, where Hegezeit means close season, the time in which
animals breed or may not be hunted for other reasons.72 [Schmitt,
however, uses the term Hegung to mean the bracketing of intra-European
war through the laws of war]{.underline}, die Hegung des Krieges. This
corresponds to a brief entry in the Grimms' dictionary, where Hegung is
given as the spatial delimitation and Einfriedung of the knightly
battlefield.73 However, if Einfriedung (or Befriedung) means the
protection of a space from assaults by the enemy and thus its
pacification,74 then from what does the battle itself need to be
protected, given it already takes place with the enemy? How would the
delimitation of the battlefield achieve pacification, other than in the
obvious sense of a conflict coming to an end there (the Grimms
appropriately refer to the Friedhof or 'graveyard' as a gehegter
place)?75 A possible answer to these questions emerges under the rubric
of 'containment': Perhaps [it is not war that needs to be protected, but
the rest of society that needs to be protected from war]{.underline}.
After all, on the national level it was the sovereign who protected the
order from its enemies. If on the international level law took on the
role of the sovereign, then it might have been [law that protected the
international order from war]{.underline}. One could in this respect
point to another word that developed from the verb hegen, namely the
adjective heikel, which meant and still means 'sensitive'. At first,
heikel was used in the sense of a person being brought up in a careful
manner (as in häckel), being 'delicate', 'fastidious'76 and
'thorough',77 but today it has the sense of a delicate matter that
demands handling with care, a matter which, if handled in the wrong way,
could lead to potentially uncontrollable and in any case undesired
consequences. Here, there is a transition from something termed delicate
because it is protected, cut off from the outside world, to something
termed delicate because of its connections to many points, thereby
warranting such cutting off. Perhaps the same could be said of [Hegung,
which would then refer to the legal mechanism by which a conflict is
limited so as to avoid its escalation]{.underline}. The containment of
conflict certainly appears to have been one of the aims in the
bracketing of war,78 even if perhaps not in the sense commonly
perceived. Hegung primarily protects what it delimits, not its outside.
This means that the [containment of war cannot have been aimed at the
protection of peaceful society; it must have been aimed at war
itself]{.underline}. Something is gehegt not so that it may be
neutralised, extinguished or expelled, but so that it may grow and be
protected.79 This protective sense of the term Hegung emerges when one
considers limited war from another perspective. Schmitt follows Hobbes
in regarding [human nature as essentially fallible]{.underline}, and the
state of nature as that state in which this fallibility [can play out in
the form of uncontained violence]{.underline}, the war of all against
all. [Taking the state of nature as a starting point, limited war
becomes the realm of the political,]{.underline} 'in which the effects
of [fallibility are contained and minimized']{.underline}; 'in which
this [violence can be contained,]{.underline} limited and redirected,
[but never abolished']{.underline}.80 Containment, then, takes on
precisely the opposite meaning to that first suggested. [Rather than
beginning with peaceful society and containing war for its benefit, the
laws of war contain the state of nature by erecting a 'fence' against
it, bringing into being a new order within, which is then protected --
in which inter-state war is then protected -- from the violence of the
state of nature]{.underline}.81 This protection achieves war's
'rationalisation, humanisation and legalisation',82 leading Schmitt to
write about war in terms one would more readily expect as part of a
description of legal order: [Such wars are the opposite of
disorder]{.underline}. They represent the highest form of order within
the scope of human power. They are the [only protection
against]{.underline} a circle of increasing reprisals, ie, against
[nihilistic hatred and reactions whose meaningless goal lies in mutual
destruction]{.underline}.83 The protective aspect of Hegung appears even
more clearly when the term is considered in the meaning it acquired in
the juridico-political sphere, where from the very beginnings of German
legal history up until the 19th century it came to denote 'the formal
procedure of opening (court) assemblies'.84 According to Gerhard Köbler,
this procedure entailed the spatial delimitation of an area in which the
dispute was to be heard by using branches or pegs around which rope was
wound. For this, hazel branches were often used, as it was believed that
they had magical powers that would protect from lightening and poisonous
snakes, and grant fertility and virility.85 The person presiding over
the assembly then asked whether it were now Dingtime, Ding ('thing')
being the case brought or the matter of concern. Like Hegung, the word
Ding was originally a Hegewort, ie, a word that brackets or encloses. It
meant 'time' in its Indo-Germanic form of origin and only through an
association with the time for assembly came to denote first the assembly
and later the dispute itself,86 its development thus describing a
movement from the process of bracketing space to the bracketed space and
finally its contents. The procedure also entailed the president's demand
for silence or peace. Such a demand is also associated with the concept
of 'ban', the German word for which, Bann, is related to Hegung. If one
disregards for a moment the meaning of Bann in modern (secular) language
as 'the authoritative \[obrichkeitliche\] order or prohibition issued
under threat of punishment',87 a meaning that can also be found in the
verb verbannen ('to banish, send into exile') that Agamben links to the
state of exception,88 then what emerges is a meaning in which Bann is
inclusive rather than exclusive, gathering rather than expelling. In its
original form, Bann meant either 'emphatic, ceremonial speech' or 'to
give a sign',89 and only later acquired its sense of a prohibition via
the meanings 'proclaim with threats' and 'put a curse on'.90 As Ekkehard
Kaufmann explains, the word bannen ('to ban') in its Proto-Germanic form
referred to the formal proclamation of peace (Dingfriede) at the
beginning of an assembly.91 Here, ceremonial speech acted as a sign; a
sign that, even though it was set up against a certain type of enmity
(in the same way in which the hazel was used to keep poisonous snakes
away), served primarily as a threshold for an order within. In this
order, it was not he who banned who took the place of the sovereign, but
the ban itself.92 The [demand for silence or peace thus most closely
relates to the protective aspect of Hegung]{.underline}. The necessity
of such a demand, Köbler writes, should be regarded as self-evident for
a time when the resolution of disputes was not yet undertaken by judges
in court and depended on the ceasing of direct hostilities between the
parties brought together.93 Paradoxically, before any conflict could be
articulated -- before it could be heightened, brought to the point -- it
first had to be suspended. This suspension of the conflict was not a
state of peace, but a forced silencing of the opposing parties. From the
parties' point of view, [crossing over the threshold of silence meant
crossing from unlimited to limited war]{.underline}. Within the
threshold, war was no longer an action that could occur at any time,
even at the same time as peaceful action, but a distinct, declared, and
thus normalised94 state. The [end of war was marked by another
declaration, the threshold crossed once more. This time, peace lay on
its other side]{.underline}. The threshold thus appeared to swap the
descriptions of the two realms simply by being there; [once the
hostilities had been concluded, that which had originally been a realm
of (unlimited) war, now became a realm of peace]{.underline}, while that
which had been (relative) peace from the perspective of unlimited war,
namely the [limited war that took place within the threshold, appeared
as an exception from peace in the first place.]{.underline} In this way,
peace began to appear as the more natural relation, to which war as a
distinct dispute about certain matters of concern -- the Ding or 'thing'
-- formed an exception.95 [Peace, which for Schmitt was only ever the
fragile outcome of pervasive antagonistic relations, came to be taken
for granted. Its dependence on the careful protection of war was
forgotten despite the fact that the mere possibility of peace had only
arisen at the point at which the parties entered into limited
war]{.underline}. By agreeing to spare each other's existence despite
their hostility, the parties acknowledged that it was possible, perhaps
even necessary, to exist side by side in a plural order. Limited war
thus had the effect of asserting society as an essentially peaceful
plurality even when, or rather, especially when a dispute arose. [War
created and confirmed plural order as a presumed point of origin. This
centrality of war to the order's existence explains why Schmitt writes
both about the single instance of war in Europe as 'a regulated contest
of forces gauged by witnesses in a bracketed space]{.underline} \[in
einem gehegten Raum\]'96 and about Europe as a whole as this bracketed
space: In a certain sense, European soil became the theatre of war
(theatrum belli), the enclosed space \[der umhegte Raum\] in which
politically authorized and militarily organized states could test their
strength against one another under the watchful eyes of all European
sovereigns.97 [By bracketing war, the laws of war encircled a space set
aside for war, which then exceeded itself to include, and found on the
basis of its own foundations, a larger space engulfing its outside. As
Prozorov writes in relation to the friend-enemy distinction, the
bracketing circle can be seen as 'the founding event of a political
community that subsequently recedes to its borderline as both exterior
to its existence and indispensable for its formation]{.underline}'.98
And this is perhaps the most surprising aspect of [the process of
Hegung: By protecting war from society in the state of nature, Hegung
reached back and behind this society to establish it as peaceful. Europe
thus came to be defined by Hegung. War no longer simply happened; it was
staged]{.underline}99 [before a European audience, which it assembled as
a collectivity of states, and which it ordered according to each state's
involvement in the hostilities]{.underline}. It is thus unsurprising
that Trier, on whom Schmitt relies for tracing the origins of the word
Hegung to cultic and religious ceremonies, finds that words denoting and
belonging to Hegung made up the basis for the word 'people', even for
the name of the Germanic people as the 'the people of our enclosure
\[Hegung\], of our thing \[unseres Dings\]'.100

#### Accepting the inevitability of war creates political equals and a much more limited state of conflict

**Odysseos 7**, Senior Lecturer of IR at the University of Sussex,
\[Louiza, "Violence after the State? A Preliminary examination of the
Concept of Global Civil War," Prepared for the 6th Pan-European IR
Conference\]

The first achievement concerns [the]{.underline} aforementioned
[bracketing and 'regulation' of war]{.underline}, which [can be
traced]{.underline}, I have argued elsewhere, both to the emergence of
the state as an agent of rationalisation and 'detheologisation' of
public life but also [to the drawing and maintenance of lines or
distinctions]{.underline} (the so-called 'amity lines') between European
soil and the 'free space' of extra- European lands available for
appropriation.13 The amity lines set aside two distinct areas considered
'open spaces' (Schmitt 2003: 94-95): on the one hand, the landmass of
the New World, whose belonging to the native populations was not
recognised, and on the other, the newly mapped and navigable seas. In
both types of 'open space', force could be used freely and ruthlessly as
these were areas 'designated for agonal tests of strength' amongst
European powers (Schmitt 2003: 99). Refreshingly, Schmitt does not deny
that this spatial distinction 'presupposed the consignment of
unrestrained violence to the rest of the world' (Rasch 2005: 258), but
[it was this which negated the need for expansive war on European soil,
and allowed limited war]{.underline}, guerre en forme, [to emerge as the
norm]{.underline}. In this peculiar way, therefore, the interstate order
which existed until 1914 (cf. Nancy 2003b: 51) had sought 'to prevent
wars of annihilation, i.e. [to the extent that war was inevitable, to
bracket it']{.underline} (Schmitt 2003: 246). [This was wholly different
from]{.underline} later classical and contemporary [liberal attempts to
abolish]{.underline} or banish [war]{.underline}, that is, to end war as
such (Joas 2003; Reid 2006). [The jus publicum Europaeum recognised that
'any abolition of war without true bracketing resulted only in
new,]{.underline} perhaps even [worse types of war]{.underline}, such as
reversions to civil war [and other types of]{.underline} wars of
[annihilation']{.underline} (Schmitt 2003: 246). [It accepted war as an
inevitable occurrence of international political order and, in doing so,
laid a foundation for 'a bracketing of war']{.underline} which rendered
it as 'a regulated contest of forces gauged by witnesses in a bracketed
space. [Such wars are the opposite of disorder']{.underline} (Schmitt
2003: 187). [The acceptance of this type of regulated but limited
warfare also enabled the recognition of the opponent as an enemy on
equal grounds]{.underline}. This development of the notion of justus
hostis (just enemy), associated with the denigration of justa causa
(just cause) reasoning in the commencement and waging of war, is the
second achievement of this order.14 The concept of an 'equal and just
enemy' evolved alongside the emergence and consolidation of the modern
state as the predominant political entity, as well as the weakening of
the moral authority of the Church out of the demise of the respublica
Christiana. Under these conditions, [warfare became divorced from
substantive causes of justice. Since war was the means by which land
could change ownership status, it became a type of political relation
amongst states]{.underline} (Schmitt 2003: 100). [Any enemy which had
the form of a state was a just enemy and war could be waged against
it.]{.underline} [This avoided wars of conviction, creed and
religion]{.underline} (that is, based on justa causa) [which had
historically led to unlimited war]{.underline} seeking the enemy's
annihilation. As he would say almost two decades later, '[with the
bracketing of war, European humanity had achieved something
extraordinary: renunciation of the criminalization of the
opponent]{.underline}, i.e. the relativization of enmity, the negation
of absolute enmity' (Schmitt 2007: 90).

The line of argument here is immediately, if superficially, familiar:
Just War justifies escalation, feeds self-righteousness, legitimizes war
-- this is very much the contemporary critique of Just War thinking as
presented, from different perspectives, by Booth and other critics.
There is, however, an important difference; [Schmitt]{.underline} does
not dodge the Henny Youngman question. He [is quite clear that there is
an alternative normative and conceptual framework against which Just War
thinking ought to be judged]{.underline}, and much of The Nomos of the
Earth is devoted to defending this alternative and bemoaning its
delegitimation by the sea-going Anglo-Saxons, who promote a conception
of world order that has had the effect of reinstating the medievalism
and extremism of the Just War. [This alternative framework emerges from
the development of the sovereign, territorial state in Europe, which
involved a spatial disposition of the Continent]{.underline} that
undermined the jurisdiction of the Catholic Church and the Empire. [The
political order is no longer committed to the preservation of God's
Order in the world, and the staving off of the reign of the Antichrist,
but instead is based on Reason of State]{.underline}.4 The European
[princes create]{.underline} among themselves a jus publicum Europaeum,
[a secular legal order under which they recognize each other's rights
and interests]{.underline}, within Europe (the proviso here is crucial).
Beyond the line, in the extra-European world, Europeans engage in
large-scale appropriations of land, respecting neither the rights of the
locals nor each other's rights, but within Europe a different modus
vivendi is possible. In the extra-European world appalling atrocities
occur which would not happen, or at least ought not to happen, in
Europe.5 [As between European rulers within Europe, war became
'bracketed' -- rationalized and humanized. Rather than a divine
punishment, war became an act of state. Whereas in the medieval order
the enemy must necessarily be seen as unjust]{.underline} (the
alternative being that one was, oneself, unjust -- clearly an
intolerable prospect), [the new humanitarian approach to war involved
the possibility of the recognition of the other as a justus hostis, an
enemy but a legitimate enemy, not someone who deserves to be
annihilated, but someone in whom one can recognize oneself, always a
good basis for a degree of restraint. This, for Schmitt, is the great
achievement of the age, and the ultimate justification for]{.underline}
-- glory of, even -- [the sovereign state]{.underline}. \[An\]
international legal order, based on the liquidation of civil war and on
the bracketing of war (in that it transformed war into a duel between
Euro- pean states), actually had legitimated a realm of relative reason.
[The equality of sovereigns made them equally legal partners in war, and
prevented military methods of annihilation.]{.underline} (Schmitt 2003:
142) [The new thinking about war also opened up the possibility of
neutrality as a legal status; since war was no longer justified in
accordance with]{.underline} a theological judgement based on [notions
of good and evil, it became possible for third parties to stand aside if
their interests were not engaged]{.underline}. Equally, the ordinary
subjects of belligerent rulers need not feel obliged to become
emotionally engaged in the fray. War becomes a matter for sovereigns and
their servants, civil and military; the kind of wider involvement that
might be appropriate to a war between good and evil becomes strictly
optional.6 Thus was established what Schmitt clearly regarded as a kind
of golden age in European international relations, a golden age that
would be sabotaged in the twentieth century by the United States, with
the reluctant, ambiguous, assistance of the United Kingdom -- two
maritime powers whose commitment to the jus publicum Europaeum was
highly qualified in the case of the UK, non-existent in the case of the
US.

### Apocalypse

#### The aff is like John of Patmos, writing the Apocalypse as a way of living, surviving and judging 

**Deleuze 97.** Gilles, "Nietzsche and Saint Paul." In "Essays Critical
And Clinical." November 5, 1997.

It\'s not the same, it can\'t be the same \...1 D. H. Lawrence
intervenes in the scholarly debates of those who ask if the same John
wrote both the gospel and the Apocalypse. 2 Lawrence intervenes with
very passionate arguments, which have all the more force in that they
imply a method of evaluation, a typology: the same type of man could not
have written the gospel and the Apocalypse. It matters little that each
of the two texts is complex or composite, and includes so many different
things. [The question does not concern two]{.underline} individuals or
two [authors, but two types of man, two regions of the soul, two
completely different ensembles.]{.underline} The gospel is aristocratic,
individual, soft, amorous, deca-:· dent, always rather cultivated. [The
Apocalypse is collective, popular, uncultivated, hateful, and
savage]{.underline}. Each of these words would have to be explained in
order to avoid misunderstandings. But already the evangelist and the
apocalypst cannot be the same. John of Patmos does not even assume the
mask of the evangelist, nor that of Christ; he in.. vents another mask,
he fabricates another mask that unmasks Christ or, if you prefer, that
is superimposed on Christ\'s mask. [John of Patmos deals with cosmic
terror and death]{.underline}, whereas the gospel and Christ dealt with
human and spiritual love. Christ invented a religion of love (a
practice, a way of living and not a belief), whereas [the Apocalypse
brings a religion of Power \[Pouvoir\]-a belief, a terrible manner of
judging.]{.underline} Instead of the gift of Christ, [an infinite
debt.]{.underline} It goes without saying that Lawrence\'s text is best
read after hav­ ing read or reread the text of the Apocalypse**[. We can
immediately sense the topicality of]{.underline}** both the
**[Apocalypse]{.underline}** and Lawrence\'s denunciation of it. [This
topicality does not consist in historical correspondences of the type
\"Nero= Hitler= Antichrist,\" nor in the suprahistorical sentiment of
the end of the world, nor in the atomic, economic, ecologic, and science
fiction panic of the millenarians.]{.underline} **[If we are steeped in
the Apocalypse, it is rather because it inspires ways of living,
surviving, and judging in each of us]{.underline}**. [It is a book for
all those who think of themselves as survivors]{.underline}. It is
**[the book of Zombies.]{.underline}** Lawrence is closely related to
Nietzsche. We can assume that Lawrence would not have written his text
without Nietzsche\'s Antichrist. Nietzsche himself was not the first.
Nor even Spinoza. A certain number of \"visionaries\" have opposed
Christ as an amorous person to Christianity as a mortuary enterprise.
Not that they have an overly accommodating attitude toward Christ, but
they do feel the need to avoid confusing him with Christianity. In
Nietzsche, there is the great opposition between Christ and Saint Paul:
Christ, the softest, most amorous of the decadents, a kind of Buddha who
frees us from the domination of priests and the ideas of fault,
punishment, reward, judgment, death, and what follows death-this bearer
of glad tidings is doubled by the black Saint Paul, who keeps Christ on
the cross, ceaselessly leading him back to it, making him rise from the
dead, displacing the center of gravity toward eternal life, and
inventing a new type of priest even more terrible than its predecessors.
\"Paul\'s invention, his means to priestly tyranny, to herd formation:
the belief in immortality-that is, the doctrine of \'judgment. \"\' 3
Lawrence takes up the opposition once again, but this time he opposes
Christ to the red John of Patmos, the author of the Apocalypse. This was
Lawrence\'s mortal book, since it only slightly preceded his red
hemoptysical death, just as the Antichrist preceded Nietzsche\'s
collapse. Before dying, one last \"joyful message,\" one last glad
tiding. It is not that Lawrence simply imitates Nietzsche. Rather, he
picks up an arrow, Nietzsche\'s arrow, and shoots it elsewhere, aims it
in a different direction, on another comet, to another audience:
\"Nature propels the philosopher into mankind like an arrow; it takes no
aim, but hopes the arrow will stick somewhere. \" 4 [Lawrence takes up
Nietzsche\'s initiative by taking John of Patmos as his
target]{.underline}, and no longer Saint Paul. Many things change or are
supplemented from one initiative to another, and even what they have in
common gains in strength and novelty. Christ\'s enterprise is
individual. In itself, the individual is not necessarily opposed to the
collectivity; [individual and collective stand opposed in each of us
like two different parts of the soul.]{.underline} Now Christ rarely
addressed himself to what is collective in us. His problem was rather to
undo the collective system of the Old Testament priesthood, of the
Jewish priesthood and its power, but only to [liberate the individual
soul from this morass]{.underline}. As for Caesar, he would give him his
due. That is why he is aristocratic. He thought a culture of the
individual soul would be enough to chase off the monsters buried in the
collective soul. A political error. He left us to manage with the
collective soul, with Caesar, outside us and inside us. On this score,
he constantly deceived his apostles and disciples. We might even imagine
that he did so on purpose. He did not want to be a master or to help his
disciples (only to love them, he said, but what did that hide?). He did
not really mix with them, or even really work or act with them. He was
alone all the time. He puzzled them utterly, and in some part of them,
he let them down. He refused to be their physical power-lord. The
power-homage in a man like Judas found itself betrayed. So it betrayed
back again. 5 The apostles and disciples made Christ pay for it: denial,
betrayal, falsification, the shameless doctoring of the Good News.
Lawrence says that the principal character of Christianity is Judas. 6
And then John of Patmos, and then Saint Paul. Each of them took
advantage of the protest of the collective soul, the part neglected by
Christ. [The Apocalypse takes advantage of the claims of the \"poor\" or
the \"weak,\" for they are not who we think they are: they are not the
humble or the unfortunate, but those extremely fearsome men who have
nothing but a collective soul.]{.underline} Among Lawrence\'s most
beautiful passages are those on the Lamb. [John of Patmos foretells the
lion of Judah, but instead a lamb appears, a horned lamb who roars like
a lion and has become particularly cunning, and who is made all the more
cruel and terrifying by being presented as a sacrificial victim and no
longer as a sacrificer or an executioner. But the lamb is a more
dreadful executioner than the others.]{.underline} \"John insists on a
lamb \'as it were slain\': but we never see it slain, we only see it
slaying mankind by the million. Even when it comes on in a victorious
bloody shirt at the end, the blood is not its own blood \...\"7 In
truth, it is Christianity that becomes the Antichrist; it betrays
Christ, it forces a collective soul on him behind his back, and in
return it gives the collective soul a superficial individual figure, the
little lamb. Christianity, and above all **[John of Patmos, founded a
new type of man, and a type of thinker that still exists today, enjoying
a new reign: the carnivorous lamb, the lamb that bites and then cries,
\"Help! What did I ever do to you? It was for your own good and our
common cause.\" What a curious figure, the modern
thinker.]{.underline}** [These lambs in lion\'s skin, with oversized
teeth, no longer need either the priests\' habit or, as Lawrence said,
the Salvation Army]{.underline}: [**they have conquered many other means
of expression, many other popular forces.** What the collective soul
wants is Power]{.underline} \[Pouvoir\]. Lawrence does not say simple
things, and it would be wrong here to think we have understood him
immediately. [The collective soul does not simply want to seize power or
to replace the despot.]{.underline} On the one hand, [it wants to
destroy power, it hates power and strength]{.underline} \[puissance\],
[John of Patmos]{.underline} hates Caesar or the Roman Empire with all
his heart. On the other hand, however, it [also wants to penetrate into
every pore of power, to swarm in its centers, to multiply them
throughout the universe]{.underline}. **[It wants a cosmopolitan power,
not in full view like the Empire, but rather in every nook and cranny,
in every dark corner, in every fold of the collective
soul]{.underline}**. 8 Finally and above all, **[it wants an ultimate
power that makes no appeal to the gods, but is itself the power of a God
without appeal who judges all other powers.]{.underline}** [Christianity
does not form a pact with the Roman Empire, but transmutes
it.]{.underline} **[With the Apocalypse, Christianity invents a
completely new image of power: the system of Judgment.]{.underline}**
The painter Gustave Courbet (there are numerous resemblances between
Lawrence and Courbet) spoke of [people who woke up at night crying, \"I
want to judge! I have to judge!\"]{.underline} [The will to destroy, the
will to infiltrate every corner, the will to forever have the last
word-a triple will that is unified and obstinate: Father, Son, and Holy
Spirit.]{.underline} [Power singularly changes its nature, its
extension, its distribution, its intensity, its means, and its
end.]{.underline} **[A counterpower]{.underline}**, **[which is both a
power of nooks and crannies and a power of the last men.]{.underline}**
**[Power no longer exists except as the long politics of vengeance, the
long enterprise of the collective soul\'s narcissism. The revenge and
self-glorification of the weak]{.underline}**, says Lawrence-Nietzsche.
[Even the Greek asphodel will become the Christian
narcissus]{.underline}. 9 And what details are provided in the list of
vengeances and glories \... [The weak can be reproached for only one
thing, and that is for not being hard enough, for not being puffed up
enough with their own glory and certainty.]{.underline} Now **[for this
enterprise of the collective soul, a new race of priests, a new type,
would have to be invented,]{.underline}** even if this meant turning
against the Jewish priest. The latter had not yet attained universality
or finality, he was still too local, he was still waiting for something.
[The Christian priest would have to take over]{.underline} from the
Jewish priest, even if both would have to turn against Christ. [Christ
will be made to submit to the worst of prostheses: he will be turned
into the hero of the collec\~ tive soul]{.underline}, he will be made to
give the collective soul something he never wanted to give. Or rather,
Christianity will give him what he always hated, a collective Ego, a
collective soul. **[The Apocalypse is a monstrous ego grafted onto
Christ.]{.underline}** [John of Patmos\'s efforts are all directed
toward this aim: \"Always the titles of power, and never the titles of
love]{.underline}. Always **[Christ the omnipotent conqueror flashing
his great sword and destroying, destroying vast masses of men, till
blood runs up to the horses\' bridles]{.underline}**. Never Christ the
Savior: never. [In the Apocalypse, the Son of Man comes to bring a new
and terrible power on to the earth, power greater than that of any
Pompey or Alexander or Cyrus. Power, terrific, smiting power
\....]{.underline} So that we are left puzzled.\" 1 ° For this, Christ
will be forced to rise from the dead, he will be given injections**[. He
who did not judge, who did not want to judge, will be made into an
essential cog in the system of Judgment.]{.underline}** For the
vengeance of the weak, or [the new power, achieves its utmost precision
when judgment-the abominable faculty-becomes the master faculty of the
soul.]{.underline} (On the minor question of a Christian philosophy:
yes, there is a Christian phi.i losophy, not so much as a function of
belief, but as soon as judgment is considered to be an autonomous
faculty, and for this reason needs both the system and the guarantee of
God.) **[The Apocalypse won: we have never left the system of
judgment.]{.underline}** \"Then I saw thrones, and seated upon them were
those to whom judgment was committed.\" 11 In this regard, the working
method of the Apocalypse is fascinat•\' ing. [The Jews had
invented]{.underline} something very important in the order of time,
which was [postponed destiny]{.underline}. Having failed in their
imperial am• bition, [the chosen people had been put on hold, they were
left waiting, they had become \"a people of postponed
destiny.]{.underline} \" 12 This situation remains essential throughout
all of Jewish prophetism, and already explains the presence of certain
apocalyptic elements in the prophets. But **[what is new in the
Apocalypse is that this waiting now becomes the object of an
unprecedented and maniacal programming.]{.underline}** [The Apocalypse
is undoubtedly the first great program book, a great spectacle. The
small and large death, the seven seals, the seven trumpets, the seven
vials, the first resurrection, the millennium, the second resurrection,
the last judgment-**this is what fills up and occupies the
wait.**]{.underline} A kind of Folies-Bergere with a celestial city and
an infernal lake of sulfur. **[All the details of the sufferings, the
scourges and plagues reserved for the enemies in the lake, the glory of
the elect in the city, the need of the latter to measure their
self-glory through the suffering of others-all this will be programmed
down to the minute in the long revenge of the weak.]{.underline}** [It
is the spirit of revenge that introduces the program into the
wait]{.underline} (\"revenge is a dish that \...\").13 **[Those who wait
must be given something to do. The wait has to be organized from start
to finish: the martyred souls have to wait until there is a sufficient
number of martyrs for the show to begin.]{.underline}** 14 And then
there is the short wait of half an hour before the opening of the
seventh seal, the long wait lasting a millennium \... **[Above all, the
End must be programmed. \"They needed to know the end as well as the
beginning, never before had men wanted to know the end of creation. . .
. Flamboyant hate and a simple lust \... for the end of the
world.]{.underline}** \" 15 There is an element here that does not
appear as such in the Old Testament but only in [the collective
Christian soul, which opposes the apocalyptic vision to the prophetic
word, the apocalyptic program to the prophetic project.]{.underline} For
[if the prophet waits]{.underline}, already filled with ressentiment, he
nonetheless does so in time, in life-he is waiting for an advent. And
[he waits for this advent as something new and unforeseen,]{.underline}
something of which he can merely sense the presence or gestation in
God\'s plan. Whereas **[Christianity can no longer wait for anything but
a return, and the return of something programmed down to the smallest
detail.]{.underline}** If Christ is dead, then the center of gravity is
effectively displaced-it is no longer in life but has passed beyond life
into an afterlife. [Postponed destiny changes meaning with Christianity,
since it is no longer simply deferred but \"postferred,\" placed after
death, after the death of Christ and the death of each and every
person]{.underline}. 16 **[One is now faced with the task of filling up
a monstrous and drawn-out time between Death and the End, between Death
and Eternity]{.underline}**. It can only be filled with visions: \"I
looked, and behold \... ,\" \"and I saw \...\" [Apocalyptic vision
replaces the prophetic word, programming replaces project and action, an
entire theater of phantasms supplants both the action of the prophets
and the passion of Christ.]{.underline} [Phantasms, phantasms, the
expression of the instinct for vengeance, the weapon of the weak\'s
vengeance.]{.underline} The Apocalypse breaks not only with prophetism,
but above all with the elegant imma­nence of Christ, for whom eternity
was first experienced in life and could only be experienced in life
(\"to feel oneself in heaven\"). And yet it is not difficult to
demonstrate the Jewish sources of **[the Apocalypse at every
point:]{.underline}** not only in the postponed destiny, but **[in the
entire system of reward-punishment, sin-redemption, the need for the
enemy to suffer a long time, in his spirit as much as in his flesh-in
short, the birth of morality, and allegory as the expression of
morality, as the means of moralization \...]{.underline}**

#### This necrophilic politics culminates in an unlimited crusade against an unspecified enemy to preserve the New Jerusalem 

**Deleuze 97.** Gilles, "Essays Critical And Clinical." November 5,
1997.

But [to ensure the fall of the Roman Empire in a vision, the entire
Cosmos must be gathered together, convoked, brought back to life\--and
then it must all be destroyed, so that the Roman Empire will itself be
brought down and buried under its debris]{.underline}. Such is the
strange diversion, the strange expedient through which **[one avoids
attacking the enemy directly:]{.underline}** [to establish its ultimate
power]{.underline} and its celestial city, **[the Apocalypse needs to
destroy the world,]{.underline}** and only paganism furnishes it with a
world, a cosmos. [It therefore calls up the pagan cosmos only in order
to finish it off, to bring about its hallucinatory
destruction.]{.underline} Lawrence defines [the cosmos]{.underline} in a
very simple manner: it [is the locus of great vital symbols and living
connections]{.underline}, [the more-than personal life]{.underline}. For
cosmic connections, the Jews will substitute the alliance of God with
the chosen people; for the supra-or infra-personal life, the Christians
will substitute the small, personal link of the soul with Christ; for
symbols, the Jews and the Christians will substitute allegory. And [this
pagan world, which, despite everything, remained alive and continued to
live deep in us with all its strength, is flattered, invoked, and made
to reappear by the Apocalypse-but only to make sure that it is
definitively murdered, not even out of direct hatred, but because it is
needed as a means. The cosmos had already been subjected to many blows,
but it is with the Apocalypse that it dies. When the pagans spoke about
the world, what interested them was always its beginnings, and its leaps
from one cycle to another; but **now there is nothing but an End lying
at the limit of a long flat line.**]{.underline} **[Necrophiliacs, we
are no longer interested in anything but this end, since it is
definitiv]{.underline}**e. When the pagans, [the pre-Socratics, spoke of
destruction, they always saw it as an injustice]{.underline} that
resulted from the excess of one element over another, and [the unjust
one was above all else the destroyer]{.underline}. But **[now, it is
destruction that is called just, it is the will to destroy that is
called Justice and Holiness]{.underline}**. [This is the innovation of
the Apocalypse]{.underline}. It does not criticize the Romans for being
destroyers, nor does it want to, for this is a good thing; [Rome-Babylon
is criticized for being an insurgent, a rebel, for sheltering rebels,
great or small, rich or poor]{.underline}. **[To destroy, to destroy an
anonymous and interchangeable enemy, an unspecified enemy, has become
the most essential act of the new justice]{.underline}**. [The
unspecified enemy is designated as anyone who does not conform to God\'s
order.]{.underline} It is curious to note how, **[in the Apocalypse,
everyone will have to be marked,]{.underline}** [will bear a mark on
forehead or hand, the mark of the Beast or of Christ; and the Lamb will
mark 144,000 persons, and the Beast]{.underline} \... **[Whenever a
radiant city is programmed, we can be assured that it is a way to
destroy the world, to render it \"uninhabitable,\" and to begin the hunt
for the unspecified enemy]{.underline}**.23 There are not many
resemblances, perhaps, between Hitler and the Antichrist, but [**there
is a great resemblance between the New Jerusalem and the future that we
are now being promised**, not only in science fiction, but **in the
military-industrial plans of an absolute worldwide State**]{.underline}.
**[The Apocalypse is]{.underline}** not a concentration camp
(Antichrist); it is **[the great military, police, and civil security of
the new State]{.underline}** (the Heavenly Jerusalem). **[The modernity
of the Apocalypse lies not in its predicted catastrophes, but in its
programmed self-glorification, the institution of glory in the New
Jerusalem, the demented installation of an ultimate judiciary and moral
power]{.underline}**. The New Jerusalem, with its wall and its great
street of glass, is **[an architectural terror:]{.underline}** \"And the
city had no need of the sun, neither of the moon, to shine in it \....
And **[nothing unclean shall enter]{.underline}** it \... but [only
those who are written in the Lamb\'s book of life.]{.underline} \"24
Involuntarily, the Apocalypse at least persuades us that [what is most
terrifying is not the Antichrist, but this new city descended from
heaven]{.underline}, the holy city \"prepared like a bride adorned for
her husband. \" 25 **[All relatively healthy readers of the Apocalypse
will feel they are already in the lake of sulfur]{.underline}**. Among
Lawrence\'s most beautiful pages are thus those concerning this
reactivation of the pagan world, but under such conditions that [the
vital symbols are in complete decline, and all their living connections
are severed]{.underline}. \"The greatest literary falsification,\" said
Nietzsche. Lawrence is at his best when he analyzes [the precise themes
of this decadence and falsification in the Apocalypse (we limit
ourselves to indicating certain points)]{.underline}:

### Arms sales

#### The aff's investment in arms sales legitimizes moral cosmopolitanism and its authority over universalized ethical conceptions of global justice

**Hofmann and Wisotzki 14** (Gregor Hofmann and Simone Wisotzki from the
Peace Research Institute Frankfurt, "Global Governance Efforts in
Tension between Humanitarian Concerns and Statist Sovereignty Rights,"

[Cosmopolitan approaches of global justice envisage a world order
where]{.underline} states' borders gradually dissolve. [The protection
of individual human rights becomes a universal concern]{.underline}.
[States bear a moral obligation to protect people against severe
violations of their human rights]{.underline}.
[Communitarians]{.underline}, on the other hand, [stress that due to
cultural differences among states, the realization of justice should
remain a national prerogative]{.underline}. [They stress the relevance
of borders and adhere to principles of sovereignty]{.underline}. This
dispute between two schools of thought in international political theory
( i p t ) is mirrored in states' diplomacy and the world of multilateral
negotiations at the United Nations.3

[The last two decades have seen the emergence of many new global
governance regulations, in which securing human rights has become a
crucial agenda-setting element]{.underline}. Starting with the
anti-personnel mine ban campaign in the late 1990s, [new regulations
with a humanitarian and human rights impetus emerged in the field of
arms control culminating in the 2013 Arms Trade Treaty]{.underline}. The
International Criminal Court and the War Crime Tribunals also seek to
strengthen human rights and enable people to seek individual justice. In
addition, at the 2005 World Summit, states agreed on the "Responsibility
to Protect\" ( r 2 p ) norm. Indeed, the mere existence of R 2 P
indicates a shift in the meaning of sovereignty and the state's
responsibilities, but it remains contested when it comes to its
application. [In the process of negotiating the Arms Trade Treaty,
arguments on the humanitarian impact of the unregulated trade of
conventional arms and the concern for a strong human rights criterion
for arms sales dominated the negotiations]{.underline}. [However, such
arguments were frequently countered by states claiming statist
sovereignty rights to individual or collective self-defense, including a
perceived right to import and export weapons]{.underline}.

Such [supposed entitlements and related justice claims matter in the
world of diplomacy and often lead states into conflict with each
other]{.underline}. In multilateral negotiations at the United Nations,
193 states constitute an arena of cultural diversity with a plurality of
understandings of justice. Therefore, the probability of justice
conflicts remains high. Such conflicts are not just disputes about the
priority of norms. States may not rank one set of norms (like
sovereignty) higher than another (like human rights). Instead, they may
perceive themselves or other actors to be able to either enjoy a set of
norms or see them protected based on pre-existing normative convictions.
If an actor sees his entitlements endangered by the development of a new
international regulation, the issue at stake becomes a question of
justice, because the actor detects a discrepancy between his
entitlements and benefits (Welch 1993:197-200). Conflicts over justice
occur, for example, when differing justice-related demands come into
conflict with each other. This article concentrates on such justice
conflicts and aims to answer the research question of how and to what
extent such conflicts affect global governance outcomes. The underlying
research interest is to examine the relevance of justice conflicts as a
constraining condition on achieving consensus in multilateral
negotiations.

The Arms Trade Treaty (a t t ) is a negotiated agreement and R2P is part
of a u n General Assembly resolution: we examine these two least-likely
cases to probe the plausibility of our approach (George & Bennett
2005:121). The cases are least-likely cases in the sense that
conventional wisdom assumes that "hard" security issues are dominated by
power politics and guided by rational self-interest, and not by
considerations of justice. However, this article aims to demonstrate the
influence of one factor on the outcome and not to explain the outcome
comprehensively. In our empirical qualitative content analysis of state
speeches, we also examine interest claims of states to contrast them
with the justice motive. The cases selected vary regarding their
success. The first case is the World Summit of 2 0 0 5 where the
Responsibility to Protect norm was included in the unanimously adopted
outcome document. Even though the General Assembly adopted the ATT in
April 2013 with 156 votes in favor, 3 against 22 abstentions,4we view
the a t t as a case with an unsuccess­ ful outcome, as consensus could
not be reached in the initial two rounds of negotiation.

Ideas of Justice in Conflict

According to several schools of thought in i p t , [the international
realm is characterized by a struggle between different conceptions of
justice]{.underline}. [Moral cosmopolitanism starts from individualist
and universalist assumptions]{.underline}. Based on Kantian rationalism,
[human beings are seen as equally equipped with rationality and
therefore capable of coming to terms with principles of global
justice.]{.underline} From such a cosmopolitan perspective, [human
beings have a moral obligation to prevent suffering and injustice beyond
state borders]{.underline} (Shapcott 2010:15; Lu 2000:263). As a
consequence, [human rights are prioritized against principles of state
sovereignty]{.underline} (Pogge 1992: 58). While cosmopolitanists are
convinced that universal principles of justice can be identified and
established for the international realm, they differ on the question of
which human rights are most important and whether they must encompass
aspects of economic and social justice (Caney 2005:102-147; Moellendorf
2002: 36). Convinced of the imperative that human rights must become
part of a just world order, some [cosmopolitanists argue that gross
human rights violations justify the use of force and propose the
institutionalization of "just war" norms as a source of moral
legitimation for humanitarian intervention]{.underline} (Pogge 2007;
Caney 2005; Teson 2005; 2003; Moellendorf 2002).

[Communitarians argue that cosmopolitanism overlooks the profound
normative and cultural pluralism in world politics. Principles of
justice can only be established within the context of national
communities and might differ depending on culture]{.underline} (Walzer
2006; Brown 2002: 92-93; Brown 1992). For this reason[, **global justice
must be perceived as contextual and cannot be universal**]{.underline}
(Miller 2007: 263; Miller 2005). Communitarians point to the relevance
of borders and argue that [global justice must acknowledge the principle
of state sovereignty]{.underline} (Nagel 2005:113-147). However, even
from a communitarian perspective, some weak universal principles of
global justice can be established if citizens from different nations
meet in the transnational space. Such norms of action include basic
human rights principles, such as a duty to prevent harm (Shapcott 2010:
59; Miller 1999: 197; Walzer 1994: 103). Minimal principles of justice
encompass rules of non-intervention, the right to self-defense and the
general acknowledgement of human rights principles (Rawls 1999:37).

This clash of ideas encompasses two features. First, the two schools of
thought differ in their perception of the adequate domain ofjustice.
Canjustice be truly global and applied to individuals beyond their own
borders or is it limited to the state, nation, or community? Secondly,
they differ regarding the relevant dimensions ofjustice: distribution,
recognition and participation (Fraser 2008).

Similar clashes of ideas on the question of the domain of justice and
the range of its principles can be identified in ir theories. The
English School articulates the tension between statist sovereignty norms
and human rights concerns. Pluralists point to the continuous relevance
of sovereignty and non­ interference as ordering principles of the
international state system. Therefore, realizing claims of justice
remain within the domain of the nation state (Jackson 2000; Dunne 1998;
Wheeler 1992: 477; Bull 1977). As to communitarians, pluralists identify
some minimal duties to assist states. Linklater (2006) sees the "harm
convention\" as a possible compromise between the two schools of thought
which proposes minimal duties of states beyond their own borders. Even
strict communitarians would acknowledge that there is a minimal common
duty among human beings and states to protect people from gross
injustices, like genocide. The solidarist variant of the English School
proposes a more far-reaching concept of global justice. They hold that
the world order has profoundly changed since the end of the Cold W ar
(Hurrell 2003:26). Meanwhile, the normative structure of world society
reflects signs of increasing solidarity and shared justice convictions
among states and world citizens (Buzan 2004:141; Wheeler 2000:12). The
ordering principle of sovereignty also includes global responsibilities
to protect people and to secure human rights. Solidarists are rather
hesitant regarding the use of force to protect people from human rights
violations and stress the role of preventive diplomacy (Dunne
&Wheeler2004:20).

[Liberal internationalists are often in favor of humanitarian
intervention when severe human rights violations occur]{.underline}
(Buchanan & Keohane 2004: 4-5; Evans & Sahnoun 2002:101). [In their
view, state authority and sovereignty also implies recognizing states'
responsibility for welfare and the wellbeing of people]{.underline}
(Teson 2003: 93). Malpractices suspend the sovereign rights of such
states. [This form of "new humanitarianism" is part of a liberal
conception of a new world order, where the protection of human rights -
conceptualized in the liberal values of liberty and equality - outweigh
traditional concepts of sovereignty]{.underline} (Shapcott 2010:133).

#### **Arms control furthers a form of liberal governmentality premised around humanitarian aims -- those are founded on colonialism and the determination of which nations are worthy of arms and which are inherently violent**

  -----------------------------------------------------------------------

  -----------------------------------------------------------------------

An alternative pessimistic approach takes more seriously the
constructivist claim that norms are not just regulative but can also be
constitutive of identity and interests. It therefore shares some
similarity with optimists such as Garcia but reaches different
conclusions. In particular, this set of scholars suggests [that what may
look like a clash between humanitarian principle and base self-interest
actually reflects the influence of competing foundational and
constitutive norms such as sovereignty, self-defense, and free
trade]{.underline} (Legro 1997, 33; Capie 2008; Grilot 2011, 540; Avant
2013, 741). This has resonance with a broader literature discussing the
tensions between market liberal norms and cosmopolitan liberal norms
(Orbie and Khorana 2015[). Regulation, therefore, reflects the outcome
of clashes]{.underline} (or indeed overlaps) [between so-called "good"
(e.g., humanitarian) norms and "bad" (e.g., free trade, sovereignty,
military necessity) norms]{.underline}, or, more precisely, emerges as
the outcome of particular norm hierarchies or systems of norms
(Wunderlich 2013, 23). I will argue that an analysis of policy in the
late nineteenth century not only provides support for this perspective
but also illustrates the [historically contingent nature of permissive
and proscriptive arms trade norms]{.underline}---in this case, norms
[grafted onto foundational constitutive norms of anti-slavery, free
trade, sovereignty, colonialism, and the standard of
civilization]{.underline}. The third strand of pessimistic literature
has drawn on thicker understandings of critical or postcolonial theory
to critique contemporary practices of arms control. Where the optimists
focus on and celebrate the success of discrete campaigning
initiatives---the first Matryoshka doll of arms trade
governance---[critical pessimists also aim to contextualize such
initiatives within the broader fields and logics associated with the
inter-related governance of arms, security, economy, and people. In this
context, action on landmines or cluster munitions has been depicted as
part of a "devil's bargain"]{.underline} (Krause 2011, 23) [in which the
protection of some people from some weapons is achieved at the expense
of legitimizing other arms, forms of violence, and ways of war---in
particular, liberal militarism]{.underline} (Stavrianakis 2016). Even
more fundamentally, some critical pessimists, drawing on Foucault (2003,
2007), have argued that [initiatives on landmines or small arms can only
be properly understood as part of what has been labeled as "arms control
as governmentality"]{.underline} (Krause 2011; also see Mutimer 2011).
It is not my intention here to provide a full exploration of the concept
of governmentality or its application to colonialism (on the latter see
Scott 1995; Larner and Walters 2002) but rather to use it to highlight
particular themes relevant both to the study of arms trade regulation in
the late nineteenth century and current debates about norms, HAC, and
arms trade regulation. The first theme is reflected in the [Sending and
Neuman]{.underline} (2006; also see Neuman and Sending 2007) who
[emphasize a reading of governmentality as concerned with the changing
practices and rationality (or mentality) of governing and how these
reflect and produce particular relations of power.]{.underline} [For
them, adding in a governmentality perspective to the examination of both
"good" and "bad" norms provides for a more complete analysis by
situating them in the broader relations of power, rationalities, and
practices that produce certain forms of behavior as appropriate and
certain actors and identities as superior]{.underline} (Neuman and
Sending 2007). For example, [rather than viewing the landmines campaign
as illustrative of a civil society realm empowered at the expense of
recalcitrant states, they suggest it is better understood as indicative
of a governmental rationality in which political power operates through
NGOs and one in which they are not so much opponents of power as agents
or even products of power]{.underline} (Sending and Neumann 2006; also
see Lipschutz 2005, 247). A second theme concerns the way in which
governmentality is understood when applied to the field of international
relations. In some perspectives, governmentality requires a concern with
elaborating the techniques aimed at regulating the behavior of states
and governments, particularly in a context of unequal power relations
between North and South (Joseph 2009). For example, [Mathur]{.underline}
(2016) [has critiqued the "colonialist governmentality" of arms control,
evident in the practices of technology denial, forcible disarmament, and
counter-proliferation employed by the West and laundered through a new
standard of civilization mantra]{.underline}. Alternatively, Krause has
placed more emphasis on Foucault's distinction between sovereign and
[governmental power]{.underline}. The former is concerned with securing
a given territory through the exercise of direct power, whilst the
latter [is exercised through the wide-ranging regulation of economy and
society and particularly associated with liberal techniques]{.underline}
of government (Krause 2011, 21). Here, the distinction between the two
does not imply a rejection or displacement of sovereignty (Joseph 2009,
415) but its recasting within the concern for population (Sending and
Neumann 2006, 657). Equally, there always remains the possibility that
governmental power can give way to the exercise of more direct forms of
sovereign and disciplinary power (Joseph 2009, 426). Thirdly, [when
applied to the field of arms control]{.underline}, this implies a
distinction between a sovereign conception of arms control and [arms
control as governmentality]{.underline}. The former is focused not only
on securing the states' monopoly of force but also on reducing the risk
of war between states, and its practices are shaped by formal adherence
to notions of sovereign equality (Krause 2011). The latter [is focused
on managing populations, represents a technology of social control, and
is concerned with "who could legitimately use what kinds of violence
against which people or groups \... under what
circumstances"]{.underline} (ibid., 31). Both types of arms control can
be identified in the practices of earlier eras, but sovereign approaches
to arms control were more characteristic of the Cold War era. In the
post-Cold War era, arms control as governmentality is [characterized by
initiatives such as the ban on landmines and postconflict disarmament
demobilization programs]{.underline} (ibid.). At one level, therefore,
this paper functions as a work of history that aims to delineate the
norms, logics, and practices that constituted a particular period of the
operation of arms control as governmentality. As already discussed,
however, the analysis of the governmentality of arms trade regulation in
the late nineteenth century also [provides a basis for critiquing the
ahistorical and uncritical assumptions of the norm optimist literature
on arms trade regulation]{.underline}.

#### A historical example is the Brussels Act -- the West didn't sell arms to the Middle East or Africa because of the stated humanitarian notion of anti-slavery, while politicians criticized the evil Arab slave traders and the unintelligent African natives -- that human rights discourse is a smokescreen for colonial violence

**Cooper 18** (Neil Cooper is a Professor of International Relations and

The [arms elements of the 1890 Brussels Act are an example of the
first]{.underline} matryoshka doll of [arms trade
governance]{.underline}---a discrete prohibitory initiative applied, in
this case, to a category of weapons in a specified region. Although
never as benign as supporters suggested, it was certainly [understood at
the time as the outcome of a Europe-wide humanitarian campaign to
control the evils of slavery, including the use of arms]{.underline} to
prosecute the slave trade. In November 1889, diplomats convened to
negotiate what would become the 1890 Brussels Act aimed at halting the
African slave trade and its attendant evils, such as the trade in liquor
and arms. With regards to the trade in arms, there was a certain
historical irony at work given that the crucial role of guns in the
slave trade (both for barter and protection) had been used in earlier
eras as the basis for exempting companies from even war-time
restrictions on the export of firearms and ammunition (West 1991).4 By
the late nineteenth century, however, [the slavery norm had been
overturned in favor of a foundational and constitutive antislavery
norm]{.underline} (Nadelmann 1990). In this context, a narrow (but
incomplete) interpretation of the Brussels Conference would be that it
represented an attempt to both consolidate an established antislavery
norm and graft prohibitory norms on the provision of arms and liquor to
Africans onto this established norm. As far as firearms were concerned,
this meant formalizing the transformation of trading arms for slaves
from a compelling national interest to a venal activity. However, the
[antislavery campaigners of the late nineteenth century were not
expressing "cosmopolitan visions of universal equality and progress" but
a world view characterized by "paternalism, prejudices and the
compulsion to proselytise Africans]{.underline}" (Forclaz 2015, 29). For
instance, The Pall Mall Gazette (January 30, 1890), in commenting on the
Brussels Conference, [noted: "We have heard the African native spoken of
often as a child. We ought to realise that to allow firearms and gin to
pass freely into Africa is literally as mischievous as to allow them to
circulate in a nursery]{.underline}." Equally, whilst antislavery was
certainly pursued at some cost (Kaufmann and Pape 1999), it was also
[consonant with liberal market assumptions idealizing wage labor and the
toleration of local practices that sometimes looked little different
from slavery]{.underline} (Nadelmann 1990, 497). More immediate factors
also created pressure for the Brussels Conference. [The extension of
European influence in Africa in the 1880s produced a backlash from Arab
traders]{.underline}, particularly in Central and East Africa where life
became more dangerous for missionaries and colonial settlers (Miers
1975, 257; Finlay 2016). [Thus, the marauding Arab slave trader was
deemed to be placing the beneficent and civilizing work of Christian
missionaries under threat. At the same time, the increased European
presence in Africa combined with the efforts of campaigners to discredit
the slave trade resulted in numerous accounts of the horrors perpetrated
by Arab slave traders]{.underline} (Bade 1977). For instance, in a
speech to the Royal Geographical Society in 1888, the German explorer
Herman von Wissmann described slave traders as the "[wholesale
destroyers of human life]{.underline}" (1888, 529) and [recounted the
use of captured slaves for target practice and cannibalism]{.underline}
(ibid., 525--31; also see Laqua 2011, 717). This mix of moral abhorrence
of slavery and concern about the threat to European settlers found its
most influential tribune in the shape of Charles Martial Allemand
Lavigerie, the French-born Cardinal and Archbishop of Algiers and
Carthage. With the support of the Pope, Lavigerie toured Europe in 1888
preaching about the horrors of slavery in a series of talks in Brussels,
Paris, Rome, and London. Like his supporters, [Lavigerie was at pains to
highlight the intersection between Arabs, Islam, and slavery in Africa.
He not only campaigned for action to end the slave trade but called for
armed volunteers to stop the traffic in slaves]{.underline} and pressed
for restrictions on the trade in firearms deemed to be sustaining the
operations of Arab slave traders (Miers 1975, 206). Some commentators
were more than a little dyspeptic in their reaction to Lavigerie's
efforts. In Britain, The Graphic (August 4, 1888, 4) warned that
"[compassion for Sambo is quite compatible with earth-hunger for
tropical possession, and with the desire of an energetic Church to
expand its spiritual domination]{.underline}." In Spain (which had only
abolished the transatlantic slave trade in 1867) the longstanding
abolitionist Sanromá reflected on the irony of those who had so recently
resisted abolition becoming fierce converts to the fight against Muslim
slavery (Schmidt-Nowara 2016, 149). More generally, however, Lavigerie's
campaign energized popular opinion. The Anti-Slavery Reporter (July
1888, 85) compared Lavigerie to "a second Peter the Hermit" who had
"arisen to preach a Crusade in the cause of humanity." In London he met
then Prime Minister, Salisbury, and the Prince of Wales. He also
addressed a meeting at Prince's Hall chaired by Earl Granville, a former
foreign secretary, and attended by Cardinal Manning, the Archbishop of
Westminster (Cameron 1888). This concluded by passing a resolution,
forwarded to the government, proclaiming the slave trade "a crime
against humanity" and calling for a Conference of the Powers to consider
the issue of slavery (Anti-Slavery Reporter, Nov/Dec, 1889, 242).
Lavigerie's campaign prompted the creation of antislavery societies in
several European countries including Belgium, France, Italy, and Germany
(Laqua 2011, 707) and in 1889 both the Reichstag and the House of
Commons called for action by the colonial powers (Miers 1975, 229--30).
In the run-up to the Brussels Conference, Lavigerie also declared his
intention to hold a week-long alternative meeting of activists in
Lucerne and, at the instigation of King Leopold, the date of the
Brussels Conference was put back to permit delegates to take account of
this alternative conference. As part of the planning for Lucerne,
preparatory commissions were established to report on the state of the
slave trade and the means to be taken to end the trade. The latter was
to include support for religious missions, control of arms sales, and
the possibility of armed intervention (Renault 1994, 380). Ultimately,
the Lucerne meeting was cancelled but a meeting eventually convened in
Paris in September 1890 with some 800 delegates drawn from sixteen
countries (The Morning Post, 24 September, 1890, 5; Laqua 2011, 710).
One point of tension concerned [Lavigerie's call for military action
against the slave traders]{.underline}. As he noted in an interview
given to Charles Allen, the secretary of the British Foreign and
Anti-Slavery Society, critics saw in this a call for "[a crusade to put
down the Mohammedan religion]{.underline}." This accusation he rejected
by suggesting "actual hostilities would be confined to the disarming of
Arab or negro slave traders" (Northern Echo, October 4, 1888, 3).
However, [the Paris meeting ultimately resolved to prioritize the use of
"pacific means" to combat slavery]{.underline} (The Morning Post,
September 24, 1890, 5). [This was certainly the position of British
antislavery campaigners who tended to draw support from Protestant,
Quaker, and Methodist groups rather than the Catholic
heritage]{.underline} that was often a feature of antislavery on the
continent. The former also figured prominently in the numerous letters
of support for the Brussels Conference sent to the British government.
This included letters from well established antislavery organizations
such as the Aborigines Protections Society but also groups such as: the
Band of Hope Union, the Church Missionary Society, and the Cambridge
University African Slave Trade Committee.5 The Young Men's Christian
Association of Great Britain and Ireland also sent a letter to the
President of the Brussels Conference on behalf of their 61,000 members
(Northampton Mercury, February 22, 1890, 2) as did the Foreign Missions
Committee of the Free Church of Scotland (The Scotsman, February 3,
1890, 10). Notably, some groups sent messages of support in direct
response to feedback from British delegates that they were
"disappointed" at the low number of memoranda they had received. This
included a communication from the Yorkshire Society of Friends (Leeds
Mercury, February 1, 1890, 4) and another drafted at a meeting at
Birmingham Council House convened by the Lord Mayor (Birmingham Daily
Post, 11 January 1890, 5). The Foreign Office also noted in October 1889
that various societies and associations had announced their intention to
send delegations to Brussels whilst the conference was sitting.6 This
included representatives of the Presbyterian Alliance (Daily Telegraph
and Courier, February 14, 1890, 3), the Aborigines Protection Society,
and the British Anti-Slavery Society. The latter pressed the conference
to declare slave traders as pirates and "enemies of the human race"
(Anti-Slavery Reporter, Nov/Dec 1889, 247; Mulligan 2013, 157). In
total, the secretariat of the Brussels Conference received 155 petitions
from different groups, of which two thirds called for prohibitions on
the trade in firearms (Laqua 2011, 716). At one point the negotiations
were temporarily halted so that letters of support from Britain, France,
and Switzerland could be read out to the delegates.7 In addition,
Lavigerie compiled a volume of "Documents Concerning the Foundation of
the Anti-Slavery Campaign" and sent a copy to each of the participants
at the conference (Renault 1994, 382--83). At the conference itself
[there was a notable consensus between diplomats, humanitarians, and
sympathetic journalists on the benign and civilizing effects of the
European presence in Africa, the primitive state of the natives, and the
inhuman practices of Arab slavers. The Conference President, the Belgian
Baron Lambermont, told the journalist Flora Shaw that two civilizations
were contesting for Africa: Islam "which was spreading from the North
like a stain of oil" and Christianity, representing the civilization of
the West. They would "decide their quarrel by force" but the West would
triumph, not least because it promised to rescue Africans from the
vicissitudes of the slavery that trailed in the wake of
Islam]{.underline} (Schneer 2001, 135). [The Belgian Minister of Foreign
Affairs opened the Brussels Conference by informing the delegates: The
work which you are about to undertake is great and pure---it is
generous, it is disinterested. For it does not entail the gratitude of
those races oppressed and decimated with the most revolting barbarity,
whose safety it is your mission to organize.]{.underline}8 [Baron
Gericke de Herwynen of the Netherlands observed, "our presence here is
the best proof of the unanimous desire of our Governments to co-operate
in . . . \[a\] great humanitarian work."]{.underline}9 [The British
representative claimed "the work which we are carrying on is purely
humanitarian; it has no connection with politics."]{.underline}10 In a
speech at Guildhall in November 1889, Salisbury observed: "I do not
think any Conference in the history of the world has ever met for the
purpose of promoting a matter of pure humanity" (Anti-Slavery Reporter,
Nov/Dec 1889, 238). Writing in the Wesleyan-Methodist magazine, the Rev.
Joseph Rhodes (1890, 912) simply described the agreement as "[the Magna
Carta of the negro," one designed "to protect the negro by disarming his
Arab-enemy." In this context, civil society actors were merely
refracting the ideology of liberal imperial states back onto the
representatives of these states, rather than asking them to challenge
it. At the same time, however, whilst the humanitarians and the
diplomats may have shared the same assumptions about the benefits of
European colonialism, the latter were also moved by more prosaic
concerns. Regarding arms, this meant preserving supplies to local allies
whilst negotiating a regime that ensured colonial authorities maintained
a qualitative military advantage over native populations.]{.underline}
The challenge was neatly set out in a note to the Marquis of Salisbury
of a meeting with the Belgian King immediately prior to the Brussels
Conference. The King considered[: it would be dangerous to supply the
Arabs or the natives with modern firearms. . . . it might be possible to
allow the limited importation . . . of flint and steel guns, reserving
the supply of modern fire-arms for Europeans only.]{.underline}11 Sir
John Kirk, the British plenipotentiary to the Brussels Conference was
even more forthright: ...If Europeans wish to retain in their hands the
advantage given them by the possessions of modern firearms, there is no
time to be lost in at once stopping absolutely the sale of rifles
\[and\] breech-loaders . . . this will have no effect upon the
slave-hunters . . . in whose hands the old flint muzzle-loading gun is
sufficiently . . . deadly.12 Kirk was equally forthright in the years
following the agreement at Brussels, noting in an 1896 report on the
Niger Coast protectorate that: "the disarmament of the country" was "a
matter of policy apart from the Brussels Act \[my italics\]."

#### Restrictions on arms sales are used as a tool of propping up the colonial order by selling weapons to western powers but refusing to sell arms to native "savages," and restrictions are inevitably circumvented by countries looking to further relations

Security Studies & Head of Peace Studies and International Development
at the University of Bradford. "Race, Sovereignty, and Free Trade: Arms
Trade Regulation and Humanitarian Arms Control in the Age of Empire"
<https://academic.oup.com/jogss/article-abstract/3/4/444/5076385>, VR)

Calls for arms trade regulation in the spaces of empire were rarely
located in broader critiques of militarism in Europe. For policymakers,
small [arms control in Africa and elsewhere was necessitated by the
threat to colonial order]{.underline} and therefore distinct from
discussions about armaments policy and armaments competition amongst the
so-called civilized powers. Even for the campaigners at Brussels, small
arms proliferation was an issue umbilically linked to the questions of
slavery, arms, and liquor control abroad rather than questions about
domestic policy. The Brussels Act was equally distinct from late
nineteenth century attempts to curtail the excesses of war amongst
civilized powers. [Some campaigners had certainly called for the
disarmament of Arab traders; the act itself cited the need to "diminish
intestine wars between tribes]{.underline}" (Article II(i)), [but such
calls were very much rooted in a humanitarian anti-slavery tradition
rather than any emerging humanitarian law of war tradition]{.underline}.
For example, neither activists nor officials actively sought to frame
the Brussels Act in relation to earlier initiatives such as the 1868
Declaration of St. Petersburg banning the use of explosive and
fulminating bullets or the 1874 Brussels Declaration on the Laws and
Customs of War. The genealogical heritage of the Brussels arms
regulations ran through an anti-slavery tradition rather than a HAC one.
This is not to deny there were expressions of discontent from gun
manufacturers about the impact of colonial restrictions upon their
business.28 But, both domestic arms production and the dynamics of arms
rivalry in Europe remained largely untroubled by efforts at small arms
control in the peripheries. Indeed, in 1889, the British government
launched a new program of military shipbuilding and both France and
Russia followed suit. According to Laity (2001, 114) "a new arms race
was underway"---and at the very same moment, diplomats were concluding
the Brussels restrictions on small arms proliferation. Of course, a
decade after the Brussels Conference, the Tsar called the first Hague
Peace Conference to explore a "possible reduction of the excessive
armaments which weigh upon all nations" (Keefer 2006, 7). In the end,
though, the Hague Conference achieved little on this front. Salisbury,
who had been so eloquent about the Brussels Conference, observed that
the [expense and destructiveness of war had worked as a deterrent in
solving conflicts]{.underline} (ibid., 10)---[disarmament, humanitarian
or otherwise, was for savages, not for civilized powers]{.underline}.
Indeed, British military experts also argued [any attempt to freeze
armament levels risked favoring "the interests of savage
nations"]{.underline} (Cooper 1991, 125). At the Hague Conference
itself, even a call for a ceiling on the growth of armaments met with
failure (Keefer 2006, 14), and the best the delegates could agree on was
a nonbinding resolution noting the restriction of military budgets was
desirable (Best 1999, 631; Keefer 2006, 15). Modest calls for
limitations on the development of rifles, gunpowder, and explosives were
rebuffed, although restrictions were imposed on dum-dum bullets and some
technologies still in their infancy. The second Hague Conference of 1907
achieved even less (Sidorowicz 1992, 15). As Sandi Cooper (1991, 132)
has noted, "arms reduction had been entombed again." Even more
instructively, the first Hague Conference was convened in the very same
year as the 1899 [agreement between Britain and Egypt]{.underline}
establishing a joint condominium over the Sudan. This had been preceded
by the battle of Omdurman in which five hours of fighting had left
11,000 Mahdists dead in comparison to just 40 on the British side
(Headrick 1981, 118). Back in Britain, The Morning Post (September 29,
1898) highlighted the role played by "[the powerful weapons of
civilization--- the shrapnel shell, the magazine rifle and the Maxim
gun]{.underline}." Winston Churchill (1902, 300) recorded "[the most
signal triumph ever gained by the arms of science over
barbarians]{.underline}." Unsurprisingly perhaps, the advantage provided
by the "weapons of civilisation" was duly recognized in the Sudan
Agreement. Article 12 noted that "special attention shall be paid to the
enforcement of the Brussels Act of the 2nd July, 1890, in respect to the
import, sale and manufacture of firearms and their munitions" (ibid.,
373). As this example illustrated, qualitative arms control functioned
to underpin the capacity to deploy violence in the service of empire,
not constrain it. The Brussels Act therefore represented an early
version of the "devil's bargain" highlighted by Krause (see above, pX),
in which a prohibitory HAC norm is promoted at the cost of legitimizing
the logics and practices of liberal militarism both at home and abroad.
However, focusing only on the operation of prohibitory regulatory norms
obscures the [way arms trade regulation also constituted a specific
colonial form of arms control as governmentality, whereby mechanisms of
prohibition and prescription were both put to the service of governing
which peoples could legitimately use what kinds of arms]{.underline}. Of
course, efforts to manage arms flows to potentially unruly colonial
subjects by constantly seeking to balance permission and proscription
were neither completely effective nor ever effectively complete. First,
[efforts at restraint were perennially subject to strategies of evasion
undertaken by local actors operating with their own normative and
cartographic understandings]{.underline} (Tagliacozzo 2005; Mathew
2016). Second, [arms trade regulation was a contested terrain over which
advocates of permission and advocates of restraint often clashed. For
example, pressures for restraint were offset by pressures to use the
provision of arms to secure access to markets and the loyalty or
security of allies in a context of intra-European competition to
maintain and expand formal and informal empires]{.underline} (Grant
2007; Chew 2012). Policy on the ground, therefore, often appeared
contradictory. Nevertheless, proponents of permission and proscription
generally agreed on the [broad goals of policy---to maintain imperial
influence and imperial order]{.underline}. As will be illustrated
below[, they agreed even more on the broader logics in which arguments
for permission and proscription were to be located---those governing
sovereignty, free trade, development, and the standard of
civilization]{.underline}. For example, the Brussels Act certainly
failed to prevent a substantial arms trade into Abyssinia and Somalia
where, by 1908, British officials considered [the act had "completely
broken down"29 largely as a result of French support for a profitable
arms trade]{.underline} through French-controlled Djibouti. In this
case, colonial norms of sovereignty provided the regulatory space for
proliferation. The legal legitimacy of this transit trade was enshrined
by Article Ten of the Brussels Act, which, somewhat ironically, had been
vigorously promoted by the British. This affirmed the [right of inland
territories "under the sovereignty or protectorate" of another signatory
power to acquire arms]{.underline} via the territory of a coastal power,
and Italy had previously announced Abyssinia's adhesion to the
agreement. Compounding the irony, at one point in the negotiations the
French had suggested the conference had "no power to impose a right of
transit on any Sovereign state."30 Enforcement of both the arms and
slave trade regulations of Brussels was also hampered by [French refusal
to permit searches of sea vessels flying the French flag]{.underline}.
Arms smuggling dhow owners operating in both the Red Sea and the Persian
Gulf quickly realized the French flag represented "a license to traffic"
(Mathew 2016, 35), as it made each dhow an "island of colonial
sovereignty" (ibid., 34) and therefore immune to search. This is not to
imply sovereignty norms offered an unfettered license to trade. The arms
provisions of the Brussels Act were ultimately predicated on the fact
that European powers exercised "rights of sovereignty" (Article Nine) in
their colonial possessions. Thus, [the act and its implementation was
suffused with norms of sovereignty that both underpinned restrictions on
the arms trade and provided the regulatory spaces permitting their
circumvention. Similarly, both the advocates for free trade in arms in
the spaces of empire and the advocates of restriction crafted their
arguments by reference to the shared ideational frames of free trade,
development, and the standard of civilization---each heavily imbricated
in the other]{.underline}. In Africa, for example, free trade advocates
argued the offer of arms was essential for recruiting African laborers
and that arms proliferation would speed the depopulation of local
wildlife, thus hastening the day when natives switched from hunting and
alcohol to legitimate trade (Storey 2008, 196). Conversely, proponents
of restriction such as Alexander Mackay (1890, 42) of the Church
Missionary Society deplored the fact that "in the name of Christianity,
free trade and civilization we see firewater and firearms pouring in
every port \[in Africa\]." However, [for Mackay, the solution lay not
only in "forbidding the import of arms and ammunition" but in promoting
legitimate trade amongst Africans, "developing the resources of the
country, and . . . promoting internal peace" so "the natives will . . .
busy themselves with growing whatever they can get a fair price for
instead of fighting]{.underline}" (Letter to The Times, May 8, 1889). In
this sense, the Brussels Act represented the archetype of regulation in
the spaces of empire, combining restrictions on the arms and liquor
trades with calls for the development of "agricultural labour and . . .
the industrial arts" amongst native populations (Article Two). At the
same time, the precise ways in which these twin processes of grafting
and counter-grafting played out varied from region to region and over
time. For example, in Singapore, policy from the 1820s onwards
oscillated between permission and proscription, as free trade and
merchant pressure on the one hand and concerns about the destabilizing
impact of the firearms trade on the other hand were weighed in different
ways at different times (Tagliacozzo 2005, 270; Chew 2012, 174--79). At
Muscat, commercial treaties between the sultan and various powers
(particularly the French) enshrining free trade severely hampered
Britain's ability to curtail the trade in the Persian Gulf. This was
only finally resolved by the aforementioned 1913 agreement between
Britain and France. Thus, free trade norms were constantly exposed to
serial processes of grafting and counter-grafting. Nevertheless, [as the
nineteenth century merged into the early twentieth century, arms trade
regulation in the spaces of empire was increasingly seen as consonant
with a dominant imaginary of liberal market norms]{.underline} (Mathew
2016). This is not to downplay the pressures for imperial powers to
supply arms to local allies, or the way broader colonial conceptions of
economic and geostrategic interest militated against cooperation to
limit the arms traffic as at Djibouti and Muscat.31 However, such
factors ultimately illustrate the way in which [particular assemblages
of norms, formal and informal practices, responses to evasions, and
norm-derived conceptions of interest constituted colonial practices of
arms control as governmentality.]{.underline} Understood in this way,
oscillations in policy in the same region or between different spheres
of colonial interest reflected the attempt (always imperfect) to manage
arms flows according to where people were placed in the racially
inflected triple hierarchies of civilization, loyalty, and utility to
imperial power---hierarchies that could be either mutually reinforcing
or mutually opposed depending on circumstance. [Pressures to arm or
disarm locals also illustrated how judgements about what constituted
interest were predicated on a particular moral economy in which European
norms of racial superiority and imperialism framed the standards of
appropriate behavior of the era]{.underline} (Finnemore and Sikkink
1998, 892) [and the fluid but always subordinate identities of the
other. The centrality of European racial and imperial norms in arms
governance was illustrated in the late 1870s when the Cape Colony in
Southern Africa introduced a licensing system aimed at disarming
supposedly disloyal native tribes]{.underline} (Storey 2004, 707). [In
response, one tribe, the Basuto, proclaimed their loyalty to the Queen
and asked whether "we are to be disarmed because we are
black]{.underline}."32 In British India, Acts in 1858, 1860, 1878, and
1909 constantly refined and revised who had the right to own, import,
export, and produce what kinds of arms, where they could be transferred
to, and under what conditions. Each act was also regularly amended via a
series of notifications that led one official reviewing rules on exports
to Aden to lament "it is impossible to say . . . with absolute certainty
what are now the precise powers of the Government of India under the
\[1878\] Arms Act."33 [This illustrates how such regulations were not
just about the effective management of arms flows but also an intrinsic
part of the process by which imperial gradations of race, culture, and
threat were actually produced]{.underline}. Indeed, in this context, the
performative of adherence to, and refinement of, regulatory processes
was as important as actually achieving a concrete impact on arms flows

#### Policies of arms control indoctrinate a Eurocentric world order which is forced onto countries that are the subject of our arms control policies -- leads to ineffective policy solutions to violence, particularly in debates over arms sales

Relations at the University of Sussex. Her main research interests are

The analysis thus far suggests that [weaknesses in the conceptualization
of]{.underline} small [arms control are more fundamental]{.underline}
than many scholar-practitioners imagine. The emerging dominant paradigm
is an improvement on conventional security studies in a number of ways.
It moves beyond great power politics, has a broader set of concerns
beyond state security that include human security, focusses on the
majority world and their security concerns, and attempts to take local
subjectivities seriously. Despite this, small arms control is [marked by
the application of categories derived from an idealized account of
Northern historical development. It thus remains Eurocentric in that it
'derives its core categories and assumptions about world politics from a
particular understanding of European experience]{.underline}'.120 Not
only has conceptual work stalled, but a [Eurocentric conceptualization
of organized violence and its control means that programmes will
continue to fail]{.underline}. Beyond this, small [arms control is also
marked by a series of exclusions, which point to the lack of a common
frame for understanding armed violence]{.underline}. This serves to
[produce the South as a site of intervention, contributing to the mutual
constitution of both North and South]{.underline}. Furthermore, the
internationalizing policy community that has emerged in relation to
small arms control is itself [marked by North-South
hierarchies]{.underline}. Overall, then, small arms control is better
understood as a moment in the [reproduction of imperial relations. There
are two main exclusions or silences in play in small arms control: a
geographical and a technological one, both of which speak to wider
questions of the social relations of militarism and the world military
order]{.underline}. Small arms control efforts are heavily
geographically circumscribed. In addition to the almost total exclusion
of Northern societies from the international public policy agenda,
control efforts are most prominent in Sub-Saharan Africa, Latin America
and the Balkans, while the Middle East, and South and East Asia receive
far less attention. The Small Arms Survey's three 'focus projects', for
example, are its Sudan Human Security Baseline Assessment, Timor-Leste
Armed Violence Assessment, and the Geneva Declaration on Armed Violence
and Development. The latter 'strives to achieve measurable reductions in
the global burden of armed violence by 2015' and its focus countries are
Burundi, Guatemala, Jamaica, Kenya, Papua New Guinea, and
Timor-Leste.121 The Control Arms campaign for a legally binding Arms
Trade Treaty (spearheaded by Amnesty International, Oxfam, and the
International Action Network on Small Arms), meanwhile, focusses on
protecting human rights and development concerns in arms transfer
decisions. In practice, this results in a focus on transfers to the
South, but to the exclusion of oil-rich Middle Eastern states that are
not, by definition, poor.122 This is emblematic of a much wider
exclusion, namely of the world military order and questions of
militarism. The small arms debate perpetuates a [partial argument that
reproduces the dominant conflict -- security -- development nexus that
has become central to post-Cold War international security, severs small
arms from the wider arms dynamic and world military order, and hives off
violent conflict in the South from the wider spectrum of war and
organized violence]{.underline}. The irony of this is that the post-Cold
War human security and conflict --security -- development approaches,
and the focus on small arms, were themselves a response to a previous
silence created by the state-centrism and obsession with major
conventional weaponry and nuclear weapons of Cold War arms control
discourse. But in filling that gap, they perpetuate their own silences.
The world military order, in which the structure and dynamics of
military activity are understood as a site of interaction in their own
right, albeit one shaped by and shaping the wider social structures of
which they are a part,123 includes intra-Northern production and trade
and North --South transfers, as well as South --South transfers and
small arms proliferation, practices that are gendered, racialized and
class-based in a variety of ways. These all have different dynamics and
social relations, and facilitate different forms of violence, but need
to be studied together in a single frame. Martin Shaw argues that while
'[It seems difficult to conceptualise Western and non-Western warfare
together in a single frame \...there is an overriding case for doing
so]{.underline}.'124 Although scholars of armed violence may object that
the concept of warfare is no longer adequate for understanding, for
example, the blurred boundary between conflict and crime, an approach
based on a framework of militarism, defined as 'the penetration of
social relations in general by military relations',125 allows for
analysis of different modes of violence in different locales at
different times, all the while united by a single analytical frame. The
current absence of a single frame is another feature of Eurocentrism.126
As Kalyvas argues in relation to understanding violence, the challenge
is to understand both the uniqueness and specificity of forms and
instances of violence, and also the deep and regular structural features
of it.127 Sophisticated analytical frameworks that have emerged in the
last five years or so seek to address the 'problem of classifying
different forms of violence' and 'erase or blur the analytic
distinctions between different forms of violence in order to bring
violence -- in all its social and political forms -- back into the new
thinking on security', as Krause argues.128 But while this sort of
approach discusses the 'micro' and 'macro' levels, it sidelines the
international and historical context. While the sociology of armed
violence -- including factors such as social and economic exclusion,
urbanization, and marginalization129 -- is becoming central to small
arms control, the international relations of armed violence remain
conspicuous by their absence. There are [no international structural or
historical forces evident in the debate around small arms proliferation
or its control, which are in turn not analyzed in conjunction with wider
patterns of military production and trade, or the deployment of
violence]{.underline}. Overall, for all its sensitivity, the problem of
small arms and armed violence is ultimately deemed to be internal to
Southern states and regions. While the small arms scholar-practitioner
community is paying attention to the world's majority population,
remedying a key deficit of traditional security studies, [the South
appears as a site of good intentions, as 'bearers of rights and objects
of emancipation, that is, for their normative value in Western political
theoretic terms']{.underline}.130 [In parts of the South, the twin
effects of small arms control are top-down attempts to create Weberian
nation-states with a monopoly on legitimate violence, combined with
bottom-up disarmament, and promotion of liberal forms of social
relations]{.underline}.131 [The element of social transformation is now
an explicit part of small arms control and the wider DDR and SSR
practices in which it is embedded]{.underline}. As Pouligny argues, the
fundamental goal of DDR 'is more than just about putting weapons beyond
use, but is rather about changing attitudes'.132 There is a fundamental
complementarity between these two sets of practices. A legitimate state
monopoly on violence and the rule of law are seen as a prerequisite for
security and development by both conservative and liberal proponents,
with the latter interested in social transformation as well. It is not
only the South that is reproduced through small arms control. [In the
North, a benevolent identity is produced and ongoing military
superiority perpetuated through small arms measures. Through their
support for an international Arms Trade Treaty, for example, the UK and
French governments -- consistently two of the world's top arms-exporting
states -- represent themselves as intervening on behalf of those
millions of people who live in daily fear of armed violence.
Then-British and French Foreign Ministers, David Miliband and Bernard
Kouchner, called the uncontrolled often illegal spread of weapons 'One
of the great tragedies of our time', arguing that 'there is an urgent
moral imperative to grip a global problem that is spinning out of
control']{.underline}. Their respective governments have played a
leading role in efforts at an Arms Trade Treaty which could be a
'crucial step'.133 This representation of regulatory gaps, a lack of
consistency, and the illegal trade as the problem, which the European
world will manfully step up to try to address, obscures the role of the
legal, state-sanctioned trade, and the uneven development of capitalist
globalization that creates the conditions for the violence conducted
with a variety of categories of arms. Focussing a little closer on the
UK, its arms control practice features a combination of concerted action
on small arms in tandem with NGOs,134 a focus on controlling pariah
weapons,135 and ongoing exports that contravene the spirit, if not the
letter of UK obligations.136 While NGOs, including major ones such as
Oxfam, work in partnership with the UK government, naturalizing and
popularizing particular understandings of the arms trade, the UK Defence
Manufacturers' Association, a key industry lobby group, has come out in
favour of the Arms Trade Treaty as a means to 'crack down on illegal
traders and proliferators, and also as an instrument to create a more
equitable regulatory environment for defence exports worldwide'.137 The
association believes that any treaty 'would not bring new obligations
for UK Industry'.138 [Any eventual treaty would thus have no impact on
UK domestic procurement or military posture, while inevitably
restricting that of Southern states, whose import practices would be
subjected to scrutiny and regulation. This allows the UK to remain a
major military producer, perpetuating asymmetry in the world military
order, while simultaneously disciplining the Southern constitution of
armed force and seeming benevolent in its concern for human rights and
development]{.underline}. Finally, it is also worth noting the North
--South relations that are reproduced in terms of the agents of small
arms control. The small arms network began life at the end of the Cold
War as a group of Northern (in particular British and American),
security-oriented NGOs and academics focussed on arms export controls.
Since then, a shared agenda has emerged between states, and between
state and non-state actors such as NGOs, research centres, and
academics. Key states involved in the small arms debate and funding NGOs
include Australia, Germany, Norway, Netherlands, Switzerland, the UK and
the USA. Key NGOs include Amnesty International, the International
Action Network on Small Arms (IANSA), International Alert, Oxfam,
Saferworld (all headquartered in the UK), Human Rights Watch (New York),
and the Centre for Humanitarian Dialogue (Geneva). Research centres such
as the Geneva-based Small Arms Survey, the Stockholm International Peace
Research Institute (SIPRI), the Federation of American Scientists,
headquartered in Washington, DC, the Bonn International Center for
Conversion (BICC) and the Oslo-based International Peace Research
Institute (PRIO), have been central to the production of knowledge about
small arms. The early movement on small arms was kick-started by a
\$224,000 multi-year grant from 1994 from the Ford Foundation to 'help
build infrastructure for international promotion of the SALW issue'.139
It is important to note that the conflict -- security -- development
nexus is heavily emphasized by some Southern governments and NGOs, in
particular those in sub-Saharan Africa, and that some Southern NGOs such
as Viva Rio (Brazil) and Gun Free South Africa, have been key Southern
influences on the small arms debate. There is thus a significant degree
of co-production of small arms control by actors across the
commonly-held divides of International Relations between public and
private, and (less so) North and South. Aid agencies, non-governmental
organizations and research centres from North and South are involved in
the promulgation of small arms control efforts. But [within this
internationalizing formation, research, funding and policy initiatives
tend to come from the North, and the vast majority of interventions take
place in the South]{.underline}. Overall, the institutional basis of
small arms control is marked by a distinctly North --South relation
which, although actors do their best to mitigate its worst effects,
remains notably hierarchical.140 Conclusion Small [arms control theory
and practice play a role in the reproduction of imperial relations
through the application of Eurocentric categories, the asymmetry of
control efforts between North and South, the production of the South as
inadequate and needing Northern tutelage, and the mutual constitution of
both North and South in relations of hierarchy.]{.underline} Such a
critique goes beyond the immediate policy question of how to control
armed violence in the South, and is suggestive of the generative and
constitutive role of scholarly-practitioner debate about small arms
control. It [raises the broader question of the international relations
that are produced, reproduced and/or challenged through the debates and
practices of small arms control. International concern with small arms
tells us more about the dominant international security imaginary than
it does about armed violence in the South]{.underline}. As Krause
argues, 'Very little, if anything, objectively changes in the early
1990s,' suggesting that the creation of expert knowledge and changed
normative space were central to the 'explosion of interest' in small
arms.141 [While claims of empirical specificity are made in relation to
particular conflicts and countries, and policy responses are
increasingly understood as evidence-based, small arms control can be
understood as a means of producing the South through particular
knowledge practices.]{.underline}142 [This means that, rather than a
response to an externally-given policy need, the small arms debate plays
a role in producing this category of weapons as a problem of
international politics. The solutions proposed in this debate are part
of the reproduction of the international relations of organized
violence]{.underline}. This is not to make an instrumentalist or
functionalist argument. As Heathershaw argues in relation to
peacebuilding more widely, few practitioners or scholar-practitioners
'would see themselves as representatives of the community policing arms
of an imperial power', and scholarship and policy work often
'depart\[s\] significantly from the territorial and timeless national
(security) discourses' traditionally studied in international
relations.143 Rather[, it is to make an argument about the
co-productivity of academic and practitioner practice and the power
relations that are reproduced through the use of seemingly progressive
categories and concepts. Eurocentrism generates an inadequate
understanding of violence in the South, and inappropriate and
ineffective solutions that are an attempt to build or shape states and
societies in an idealized European image]{.underline}. Further research
is needed to [develop more adequate conceptual understandings and to
explore the messiness of the everyday practice of small arms control --
the ways it is taken up, negotiated, contested, and resisted in the
South -- and the relationship between different forms of violence within
and between societies, in order to broaden the imaginary of the
possibilities for the control of armed violence in the contemporary
world.]{.underline}

#### Humanitarian justification for arms sales furthers liberal militarism, which justifies good Western forms of "legitimate high-tech war" in deeming certain forms of violence as antithetical to human rights

Relations at the University of Sussex. Her main research interests are

Arms Trade Treaty"
https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/01436597.2015.1113867, VR)

In the run-up to the final United Nations conference negotiating an Arms
Trade Treaty (ATT) in early 2013, UK Foreign Minister William Hague
warned those states yet to commit to the treaty: 'history will judge you
harshly if you miss this moment'.1 This invocation of the historical
responsibility at stake in the effort to agree a universal, legally
binding treaty to regulate conventional arms transfers was amplified
when the overwhelming treaty vote on 2 April 2013 was met in the UN
General Assembly with 'a burst of sustained applause'.2 Treaty
commentator and scholar Matthew Bolton gave congratulations to civil
society and kudos to small and middle powers, and to the USA 'for doing
the right thing in the end'. Together, 'crucial norms against profiting
from the sale of killing machines to those who abuse human rights and
humanitarian law' have been established.3 The treaty entered into force
in December 2014, requiring state parties to regulate their weapons
transfers with reference to arms embargoes, illicit trafficking,
genocide, crimes against humanity, war crimes, peace and security,
international humanitarian law (IHL), international human rights law
(IHRL), terrorism, transnational crime and gender-based violence. In
this article I argue, contrary to the predominantly optimistic emerging
assessment of the treaty, that a [key effect of the ATT is the
legitimation of liberal forms of militarism exercised by major Western
states]{.underline}. It is not simply that these states have long been
among the world's largest military spenders, arms producers and arms
exporters, and claim the ATT will bring no new responsibilities for
them. The same applies to major non-Western suppliers and
non-signatories such as Russia and, increasingly, China. There is
something more at stake: [the liberal form that war making and war
preparation take when exercised by major Western, liberal states. There
is a distinct political economy, strategic orientation and -- crucially
-- form of justification based on human rights, humanitarianism and
morality that frame their arms transfers as part of broader war-making
and war-preparation practices. Arms transfers by liberal states that
contribute to violations of human rights and IHL are hidden from view by
the existence of regulatory regimes that include consideration of human
rights and IHL. This legitimating function of regulatory regimes has
been uploaded into the ATT in the way it introduces a balancing act in
which states can weigh the risk of human rights violations against the
interests of peace and security and justify exports in the name of the
latter. With the effect of naturalising liberal states' practices and
allowing them to evade scrutiny, create the impression of responsibility
and morality, and effect leadership of a liberal international order
that is nonetheless reliant on coercion and violence, the ATT takes on a
rather different hue as a means for the reworking and re-legitimation of
liberal forms of militarism]{.underline}. In what follows I first
situate the treaty empirically, set out the emerging scholarly
assessment of it based on human security norms, and advance as an
alternative the concept of liberal militarism. Second, I analyse the
similarities and differences in forms of justification by the USA and
the UK. As an ambivalent sceptic-turned-supporter of the treaty, the USA
engaged in more unilateralist forms of justification than the UK, which
was a major champion of the treaty. However, both [states' engagements
with the treaty share a framing based on a universalising moral
responsibility. Two cases -- arms transfers to Egypt during the Arab
Spring and intra-Western transfers -- are then used to illustrate the
ways in which the US and UK governments justify their arms
transfers]{.underline} by reference to regulatory regimes that include
explicit reference to IHRL and IHL, regimes that are deemed to already
exceed the standards of the ATT. Whilst transfers to the Middle East
during the Arab Spring were used by proponent non-governmental
organisations (NGOs) as an illustration of why an ATT is needed,
intra-Western transfers are generally not on the arms transfer control
agenda. More broadly claims around the need for tighter arms trade
regulation revolve around an armed violence agenda, primarily in
Sub-Saharan Africa and Latin America. Analysing a Middle Eastern and an
intra-Western case helps us think harder about the broader purposes of
arms transfer regulation. The existence of transfer regimes that already
exceed the standards of the ATT creates a paradox in which contemporary
risk transfer militarism is justified by reference to arms export
licensing processes that are themselves based on risk assessment. Rather
than signalling the success of human security norms, then, [the effort
to use criteria- and riskbased assessments of arms transfers -- the core
of the ATT -- is better understood as having been mobilised as part of
the legitimation of contemporary liberal forms of
militarism]{.underline}. There is, as yet, no negotiating history of the
ATT. This article combines analysis of states' official statements and
expert commentary from observers of the process with off-the-record
discussions with US and UK state and civil society participants in the
treaty negotiations as a contribution to understanding the dynamics of
the treaty negotiation process and early implementation phase. The ATT
brings together states' existing obligations under international law in
the form of express prohibitions that are binding on importers and
exporters (Article 6), and sets standards for regulatory practice in the
form of national risk assessments to bind exporters (Article 7). [Its
goal is to address 'the security, social, economic and humanitarian
consequences of the illicit and unregulated trade in conventional arms',
while protecting the 'legitimate political, security, economic and
commercial interests of States']{.underline}.4 As with other arms
transfer control regimes, the 'illicit' trade is simultaneously an
organising term of the ATT and never defined in the treaty text.5 The
[combination of existing obligations under international law with human
rights standards]{.underline} to be enshrined in national regulatory
systems is envisaged by proponents to render irresponsible transfers
illegal.6 This [was resisted by some Southern states, which saw it as a
political move to delegitimise their practices while facilitating
Western ones.]{.underline}7 The idea for the treaty originated in the
1990s with NGO campaigners and a group of Nobel Peace Laureates and was
taken up by states via the UN system. A loose coalition of European and
Southern states, most notably in Latin America and Sub-Saharan Africa,
working in alliance with the Control Arms NGO campaign, took on the role
of 'regional champions' of the treaty and worked together as a
'like-minded' group,8 building on the regional 'minilateralism' of
initiatives such as the Nairobi Protocol,9 and on existing national and
international regimes such as the EU Common Position on Arms Exports. A
series of technical criticisms have been levelled at the scope, clarity
and force of the final treaty text, including the absence of an
enforcement mechanism.10 And diplomatic obstacles to the implementation
of the treaty remain: key exporting and importing states such as Russia,
China and India have not signed it; the USA has signed but is unlikely
to ratify in the near future. However, other states' widespread
enthusiasm for the treaty vote translated into rapid entry into force 21
months after being agreed at the General Assembly. The emerging
scholarly assessment of the ATT is clear that international action to
regulate the arms trade is an 'unprecedented effort' at norm creation,11
and 'one of the most ambitious and difficult goals to achieve in global
governance'.12 It [grows out of existing arms control, disarmament and
arms transfer control regimes. Extant arms control or disarmament
regimes that ban specific technologies such as landmines, cluster
munitions, chemical and nuclear weapons, have all relied on these
weapons being framed as indiscriminate, inhumane, unacceptable or pariah
in some way, thus challenging states' abilities to produce, use or
transfer them as part of legitimate military need]{.underline} and state
security practice.13 The difficulty with regulating the conventional
arms trade as a whole, as the ATT attempts to do, is that it does not
lend itself to such framing because of the centrality of the arms trade
to state security and sovereignty, and hence its widespread
legitimacy.14 Any multilateral action on the trade in conventional
weapons as a whole thus has to take the form of regulation rather than
abolition or a ban. The ATT is both emblematic of, and distinct from,
the post-cold war non-proliferation paradigm.15 For example, there is
specific mention of terrorism as an ill to be combated, and a framing
around the 'illicit and unregulated' trade; yet it applies to a broad
range of military equipment, and does not generate a taboo or ban on
particular types of technologies. As such, [it may be able to serve to
draw attention to the patterns of civilian death and injury 'associated
with technologies considered "normal" or the use of which is somehow
seen as "inevitable]{.underline}"'.16 [One way this is envisaged is
through inclusion]{.underline} not only of the laws of war under
existing IHL, but also [of human rights provisions]{.underline}. This
human security content of the treaty secured widespread agreement, with
the [reduction of human suffering explicitly named as a goal of the
treaty]{.underline}. The treaty means different things to the various
constituencies involved in the campaign and negotiating processes;
indeed, this was a necessary condition for its agreement. It is as much
about trade regulation (according to supportive government and industry
representatives) as arms transfer control (as most proponent NGOs would
have it), with only minority voices (such as the Women's International
League for Peace and Freedom, WILPF) articulating a disarmament agenda.
And this is quite aside from the vocal hostility of US-based campaign
groups and think-tanks such as the National Rifle Association (NRA) and
Heritage Foundation on unilateralist and Second Amendment grounds, and
the scepticism (eg China, India and Russia) and opposition (eg Iran,
North Korea and Syria) of some non-Western states on substantive and/or
procedural grounds.17 Overall, the treaty represents the 'confluence of
arms control, security, human rights, trade, armed violence,
sovereignty, development, self-defence, technology, and other issues'.18
Its widely drawn provisions 'must be applied in an innumerable number of
different factual contexts...which take shape as the treaty is applied
in practice'.19 As experience from international action on small arms
has shown, the problems posed by the arms trade are of a different
character in different parts of the world: small arms are an issue of
recirculation post-conflict in West Africa, of excessive stocks in
southeast Europe, and of criminal activity and drug trafficking in Latin
America and the Caricom region.20 Notes of caution have been sounded by
more radical campaign groups: to ensure the ATT makes a difference,
states, civil society and the UN 'must avoid legitimising further the
international arms trade and irresponsible transfers'.21 But limits of
the treaty aside, most agree that 'we have to start somewhere' and push
for 'robust interpretation and effective implementation'.22 The ATT is
seen by proponents as a step forward in the development of norms around
the protection of human security and potentially generative of a norm
cascade such that it will have an effect even on non-signatories.23 This
chimes with the academic literature on norms, which makes the case for
the possibility of moral progress in international politics and a rising
tide of principled action. The UK government is seen as having
'humanitarian, developmental and moral justifications' or 'motivations'
for exercising leadership on the ATT, according to norms scholar Denise
Garcia.24 As an example of 'disarmament diplomacy', the ATT signals the
way in which the rise of norms based on moral concerns may change
conduct in international politics:25 'The creation of new international
norms transforms deeply held practices and changes behaviour.'26 This is
resonant with a [common theme within the constructivist norms literature
that norms coexist with and sometimes trump material and strategic
concerns, requiring a move beyond interest-based
explanations]{.underline}.27 As Price puts it, 'almost any international
treaty dealing with subjects such as human rights or war would seem to
be a mix of the brutal bargaining of national interests and coercion
sprinkled, if not always enveloped, with other, including moral,
considerations'.28 At first blush, then, we cannot understand the entry
into force of the ATT without the role of human security norms. However,
while the circulation of norms around human security was a necessary
(but not sufficient) condition for the agreement and content of the
treaty, the character of the explanation given by a constructivist norms
account is limited. Norms are supposed to facilitate more progressive
standards of behaviour through, for example, the 'rhetorical entrapment
and shaming involved in hypocrisy', while a constructivist approach is
supposed to illuminate the 'nuances of progressive and regressive
effects of even strategically moral uses of morality'.29 But [existing
norms-based accounts of the ATT have taken at face value the moral
representations of leading liberal states, as seen in Garcia's equation
of justifications with motivations]{.underline}.30 And broader
constructivist accounts of weapons activism have not tackled the ongoing
patterns across the spectrum of weapons transfers, outside the banning
of specific technologies. [Carpenter's insightful analysis of the
question of why some weapons systems are targeted for de-legitimation
and not others brackets the wider system of war preparation of which the
development of weapons systems is a part]{.underline}.31 [Constructivist
arguments implicitly assume that progressive change in the area of
weapons issues can come from de-legitimating one technology at a time.
Yet broader systems of war preparation and war fighting will always
generate new technologies.]{.underline} And, as I argue later, [liberal
states' war practices are kept off the agenda through risk assessment
processes and legitimating claims based on a universalising
morality]{.underline}. Claims about the normative power of conventional
arms transfer control regimes have been sternly tested by empirical
studies[. Studies of patterns of arms exports demonstrate how the
'self-declared ethical turn' of major Western arms suppliers in the
1990s has not acted as a bar on weapons exports]{.underline}.32 The USA
and Western European states 'have generally not exercised export
controls so as to discriminate against human rights abusing or
autocratic countries during the post-Cold War period'.33 At best, the
effect of the EU Code of Conduct, which served as one of the templates
for the ATT, has been that 'EU members no longer appear to reward poor
human rights with arms transfers, even if they are not punishing it
either'.34 And in specific cases such as EU member states' arms
transfers to Libya, evidence demonstrates comprehensive violation of
export control principles, even though exporting governments were aware
of the risks posed by transfers: licence denials 'constitute exceptions
in an overall export-friendly environment'.35 These empirical patterns
raise the question of how liberal states manage to both transfer weapons
to human rights violating and authoritarian regimes, and claim the
mantle of responsibility by being publicly in favour of the ATT. The
empirical studies cited above tend to adopt a realist explanation, in
which seemingly normatively progressive regimes serve as rhetorical
cover for material or strategic interests,36 yet they do not go into
detail as to how that process works. Realist explanations are inadequate
because they fail to take into account the hard work that such rhetoric
performs or the way that regimes function, often despite the good
intention of some proponents.37 [Law and regulation are not merely
superficial cover, a distraction from a focus on the advancement of
material interests: law 'does matter; that is both the problem and the
promise']{.underline}.38 Thus while constructivists are right that
rationalist assumptions of narrowly instrumental behaviour are false,39
they do not give an adequate explanation of the significance of the
morally oriented work that is going on in the ATT: the ways in which a
seemingly progressive initiative contains the seeds of its own
complicity in broader systems of preparation for war and violence. Yet
Price does point to how, 'if hypocrisy becomes too endemic then it may
undercut the power of the moral legitimacy more generally that is
required for hypocrisy's piggy-back effects'.40 So it may be that arms
transfers are so embedded in hypocrisy that normative shaming is less
effective. As Erickson argues, 'the ATT faces a hard road ahead':
'without the means to expose and punish noncompliance... \[ambitious
policies\] do little more than enhance states' reputations without
improving human rights and conflict conditions on the ground'.41 Yet
'Research explaining major suppliers' support for "responsible" arms
export controls is lacking'.42 [To start thinking about this gap between
commitment and compliance, and to explain major suppliers' positions, I
advance the concept of liberal militarism.]{.underline} This moves
beyond arguments based on hypocrisy and instrumental or functional
pursuit of material interests, in order to explain key effects of the
treaty in ways other approaches cannot. The [normalisation and
legitimation of liberal ways of war and war preparation via the ATT are
an important component of contemporary militarism]{.underline}. The
concept of militarism, understood as the social and international
relations of the preparation for, and conduct of, organised political
violence,43 allows us to examine the historical, socioeconomic and
political sources and character of military power.44 Understood this
way, the concept goes beyond a definition of militarism as ideology, and
of militarisation as the material process through which militarism comes
about. Militarism includes an ideological component but is not
restricted to it, because war and armed violence can be justified and
facilitated even if not necessarily glorified; and because social forces
beyond ideology are required to produce it. Arms transfers and arms
transfer control may thus contribute to militarisation (an increase in
the intensity of military power in society, whether domestic or
international), demilitarisation (a decrease), or a change in the
character of militarism. The concept allows for the analysis of the
different forms across space and time taken by war and preparation for
it.45 And while the number of deaths caused by the arms trade is clearly
an important yardstick, a militarism frame goes beyond numbers. Rather,
it captures the influence of military relations on social relations in
general, and the ways that war and armed violence are prepared for. This
requires broadening the empirical focus beyond conflict in Africa and
organised crime in Latin America, which have been the main focus of arms
transfer control. [Scholars are increasingly challenging the long- and
widely cherished belief that liberalism and militarism are
antithetical]{.underline}.46 [Key features of the specificity of liberal
militarism include: the capital- and technology-intensive character of
the preparation for and conduct of war; a strong commitment to military
production across war- and peacetime and self-understanding as a
primarily 'economic, industrial and commercial power'; the distanced
form of attacks on Southern populations and simultaneous containment of
social conflict at home and policing of empire abroad, often featuring
supposedly 'small' massacres; a universalist ideology and conception of
world order; low levels of military participation by society; and a
state--capital relation that is formally separate but organically
related]{.underline}.47 [Justifications based on values and morals
promoting human rights and humanitarian values are central to
legitimating these features of liberal militarism]{.underline}, and are
in contrast to the justifications based on sovereignty of other major,
non-liberal suppliers and recipients such as Russia, China and India. In
the case of the ATT, [language and regulatory bureaucratic practices of
risk assessment are embedded in Western, liberal regimes]{.underline}
that on paper already exceed the standards set out in the ATT. More
generally the [turn to law has been central to the development of
liberal militarism. The laws of war serve a legitimising effect for
Western ways of war, pre-empting criticism through reassurance,
shielding acts and practices from criticism, and giving rhetorical
protection from challenge, which serves to naturalise and normalise the
prevailing distribution of power]{.underline}.48 [And the combination of
human rights and IHL has served to criminalise lowtech violence and
legitimate high-tech forms of war.]{.underline}49 [The turn to law is
'productive of the social and political context that makes possible
certain forms of war and certain relations of hierarchy', as the
'perceived compliance with the law itself is partly productive of the
global order in which contemporary war occurs'.]{.underline}50 [This
allows liberal states to pitch their practice in terms of
responsibility, morality and legitimacy]{.underline}. Overall, then,
while it is inappropriate to claim that legal regimes are mere
instruments of the powerful[, it is]{.underline} also [too strong to say
that humanitarian security regimes such as the ATT operate 'in
opposition to the aspirations of the most powerful
states]{.underline}'.51 What is at stake, rather, is the legitimation of
specific forms of war fighting and war preparation.

### Binaries Bad

#### Distinctions like gender, race, and moral binaries are inevitable. Trying to eliminate them only drives difference underground and gives license to destroy any measure of dissent---this makes those binaries all the more powerful

**Rasch 2005** -- PhD, Henry H. H. Remak Professor of Germanic Studies

For [it is not that exclusions are miraculously made absent once
distinctions are not formally drawn. On the contrary, unacknowledged
distinctions, and those who are distinguished by them, simply go
underground, become invisible, and grow stronger, more absolute, in
their violent]{.underline} and explosive [force. When the]{.underline}
retrograde and [condemned distinction]{.underline} between the ''Greek''
and the ''barbarian'' [becomes a simple]{.underline}, sanguine
[affirmation of humanity, this]{.underline} ideal aﬃrmation actually
[turns out to be]{.underline} nothing other than [a
distinction]{.underline} drawn [between all those who, by their right
behavior, show themselves]{.underline} to be truly ''[human'' and those
who,]{.underline} alas, [by their perverse dissent, have revealed
themselves to be evildoers]{.underline}, to be ''inhuman.'' Deliberate,
visible, ''external'' [distinctions that demarcate a space in which a
''we'' can recognize its diﬀerence from a ''they,'' preferably without
marking that diﬀerence in a necessarily asymmetrical manner,
are]{.underline} to be [preferred, in Schmitt's world, to
the]{.underline} invisible and [unacknowledged distinctions that mark
those who are exemplary humans from those who, by their political
dissent, show themselves]{.underline} to be [gratuitously perverse. For
reasons, then, of making diﬀerence visible, Schmitt favors]{.underline}
lines drawn in the sand, or, in the ''mythical language'' used in The
Nomos of the Earth, ''[firm lines'']{.underline} in the ''soil,''
''[whereby]{.underline} definite [divisions become
apparent]{.underline},'' and, above them, on the ''solid ground of the
earth,'' ''fences, enclosures, boundaries, walls, houses, and other
constructs,'' [so that the ''orders]{.underline} and orientations [of
human social life become apparent'' and the ''forms of
power]{.underline} and domination [become visible]{.underline}.'' 7

### Cap Bad

#### Anti-capitalist drives for a "level playing field" enable value-laden just wars and dehumanize opponents

In addition to the above justification for war, in 1932 [Schmitt
identified the ideas of Marx]{.underline}, as well as Lenin's
'annihilating sentences against bourgeois and western capitalism', [as
being ideologies of just war]{.underline} (Schmitt 1996, 67). Writing
thirty years later, [Schmitt]{.underline} similarly [condemned all
ideologies of just war, be they motivated by liberal ideals]{.underline}
of spreading justice and civilisation [or by Marxist
tenets]{.underline}. In Theorie des Partisanen [he condemns the
justification of war based on abstract values, regardless of the
ideology on which those values are founded]{.underline}. Schmitt remarks
that [the attempt to impose 'higher values' on people with 'lower
values', which he perceives to be a product of liberalism, results in
wars for which no price is seen as too high]{.underline} (Schmitt 1963,
75). [Schmitt also stresses the roles of Leninism and Maoism in the
revival of]{.underline} the notion of [just war]{.underline} after the
Second WorldWar [and in fomenting civil]{.underline} and revolutionary
[wars throughout the globe.]{.underline}18

#### Marxism is just an extension of liberalism -- it relies on the same foundational assumptions

**Thorup, 06** -- Ph.D. dissertation @ the Institute of Philosophy and
the History of Ideas (Mikkel, January, 2006, "In Defence of Enmity --
Critiques of Liberal Globalism," p. 126-127)

According to Schmitt, Marx's original contribution was the
intensification of history to one final battle between two distinct
classes: The working class and the bourgeoisie. The diversity of the
social and political stratification was narrowed down to just one
opposition, which intensified the struggle, linked diverse struggles
across space and time, and created the justification for illegality,
sacrifice and terror. The bourgeoisie was transformed from an object of
literary resentment to a world-historical figure: The one extreme
opposition, which stood between the working class and freedom (1926a:
chap. 3; 1996a: 73). This is, according to Schmitt, the political
element in Marxism, which is in contradiction with its simultaneous
economism, which shares origin and to some extent also goal with its
declared opponent. The capitalist and the communist share an anti-
political, economic-technical way of thinking that reduces political
differences to organizational or sociological problems: "The great
entrepreneur has no other ideal than Lenin: an 'electrified world'. They
really only struggle about how to electrify" (Schmitt 1984: 22; see also
2005b: 847). Even though [Marxism]{.underline} understood itself to be
in opposition to the liberal bourgeoisie, its [critique was an internal
critique, as the theory and concepts derived from the
horizon]{.underline} and world [of liberalism]{.underline} (Dotti 1999).
[Marx incorporates the philosophy of history of the Enlightenment, which
suggests a historical development where hierarchy are replaced by
horizontality]{.underline}, obscurity by visibility and transparency,
[authority by self-organization,]{.underline} [alienation with
self-realization and,]{.underline} finally, [the political by universal
friendship. Marxism is Enlightenment philosophy of history with one
added stage: History does not end in the liberal but in the communist
society]{.underline}. As such, [rather than its negation, this kind of
Marxism can be seen as the natural and logic development of
liberalism]{.underline} (Fontana 2000). [Liberalism and Marxism share an
anti-politics.]{.underline}

### Democracy 

#### **The aff props up the triangle of the military-instusrial complex -- positing faith in the toelogical structure of our democracy for the guise of liberal peacemaking -- the 1ac applies the conditions democracy as a deterrent but fail to take into account the modality of violence -- its preaching of the Democratic Peace Theory insits democracies are non-violent because they don't attack other democracies -- But these assumptions don't take into account the final chapter -- the monetization of the world into a democracy-- the 1ac acts as a scapegoat for the inherent flaws and antagonisms that encompass democracy -- defelcting violence away from its internals redirecting it into a slough of violent imperialism and interventionism** 

**Scott 8** (Kyle scott, a visiting assistant professor at Duke
University, with a Ph.D. in political science: American political theory
and public law. "A Girardian Critique of the Liberal Democratic Peace
Theory" 51-55, 2008)

Girard begins with desire. Desire, unlike hunger, is not a
straightforward biological need. The objects of desire are much harder
to define. [Humans learn from one another what to desire. Like all
learning, learning what to desire is mimetic, and thus desire is
mimetic.24 All of society is based on mimesis, not just the act of
learning.25]{.underline} Once his basic needs are satisfied man is
subject to intense desires, though he may not know precisely for what.
[The reason is that he desires being, something he himself lacks and
which some other person seems to pos- ses]{.underline}s. The subject
thus looks to that other person to inform him of what he should desire
in order to acquire that being. If the model, who is apparently already
endowed with superior being, desires some object, that object must
surely be capable of conferring an even greater plentitude of being.26
[We desire what others possess, and at times, what others
desire]{.underline}.27 [Girard demon- strates that desire has a
triangular structure]{.underline}. There is the object (O), the subject
(S), and the model (M). Along the base of the triangle are O and S. At
the apex of the triangle is M, the one who indicated in the first place
that the object is desirable. Therefore, S desires O because M desires
it.28 M possesses something, or M is perceived to possess something,
that S finds desirable because it sees the model possessing it. M can be
the mediator between S and O, but M can also serve as a roadblock to the
desired object. "Although the mediator creates value in the desired
object and provides a model for emulation, the mediator also competes
for possession of the object."29 The greater the distance between the
apex (M) and the base (S and O), the less risk there is of rivalry
(mimetic rivalry). The distance between the apex and the base is
determined by the success of the channels designed to keep mime- sis
peaceful. But the potential for mimetic rivalry increases when the
distance between the apex and the base decreases. The distance between
the apex and the base is great when there are social distinctions and
barriers sufficient to channel mimetic desire away from the apex.
However, when M and S occupy the same space---or as the base gets closer
to the apex---the chance for M and S to enter into a rivalry with one
another over O increases. The probability of violence between M and S
increases when the rivalry over O intensifies to the point where the
object itself is no longer as important as the rivals (M and S) battle
for prestige or recognition that is based on the possession of O.30
Violence from mimetic rivalry seems to be inevitable, though it may not
be so if humans can recognize their mimetic desire for what it is,
though this does not usually happen.31 [Throughout the course of human
history, mimetic rivalry, and hence desire, has never failed to turn
into violence]{.underline} (conflictual mimesis). Girard explains this
in his own words when he writes that "[When any gesture of appropriation
is imitated it simply means that two hands will reach for the same
object simultaneously: conflict cannot fail to result]{.underline}."32
Conflictual mimesis occurs for one of two reasons that can occur
simultaneously. First, [the desired object cannot be possessed by more
than one person; violence is the only way to resolve the
conflict]{.underline}. Second, [the human being is moved to imitate
while at the same time valuing individuality. Violence results in the
second scenario]{.underline}, since [the only way to maintain one's
individuality in a world of imitation is to get rid of the model one is
imitating once one has gotten from that model what one needs, or thinks
one needs.]{.underline} Implicit in this second scenario is [the
illusion of individuality]{.underline}. While [one thinks that one's
desire is individual, it cannot be so, since it is mimetic]{.underline}.
Girard points out that "[Adult desire is almost identical \[to
children's desire\], except that the adult is generally ashamed to
imitate others for fear of revealing his lack of being]{.underline}."33
McKenna elaborates on this point to show how a drive to indi- viduality
can lead to violence, even between nation-states: [Because desire
originates not in a self but in another desire, it is prey to mimetic
behavior in which the sovereign will has no role]{.underline}. It \[the
theory of mimesis\] argues that free will is a human possibility rarely
essayed, espe- cially at the level of nation states.34 . . . [Our
relation to the world is mediated by other subjects, not by their ideas
but by desire, which is neither their desire nor ours to do as we
or]{.underline} The same structural misunderstanding prevails in
conflict as in desire. . . . Desire is the structuring principle of
conflict.36 [Once mimetic desire has turned into mimetic rivalry and the
actualization of violence]{.underline} between M and S is imminent, the
violent tendencies of M and S [can be redirected onto a
scapegoat]{.underline} (the scapegoat mechanism).37 [Through scape-
goating, a community38 succeeds in organizing and directing violence
away from itself.]{.underline} [The community attributes the cause and
the resolution of the crisis to the surrogate victim
(scapegoat]{.underline}): [this is the first lie]{.underline}.39 It is
called the first lie because the scapegoat is not the true source of
violence, nor will its eradication provide a lasting solution. The first
lie is [followed by incontestable claims about the surrogate victim,
claims that are advanced in order to perpetuate the first lie. In most
instances, an incontestable claim centers on the fantastic abilities of
the surrogate victim to create a crisis, and through its destruction, it
brings about peace.]{.underline} While somewhat random, the selection of
[a scapegoat is generally the selec- tion of someone or something easily
identifiable by the group as being different.]{.underline} For example,
in literature, this person may have some birth defect. In an interna-
tional conflict, it may be [a country characterized by a different
ideology or reli- gious allegiance]{.underline}. Whatever the case may
be, [the scapegoat receives the violence; the collective violence
against the scapegoat relieves the tension in the relation- ship between
the subject and the model.]{.underline}40 In this way, the scapegoat is
able to bring about social cohesion. Interestingly, the cohesion and
peace that is brought about through the attack on the scapegoat is not
lost on the community[. The scapegoat mechanism is understood by the
community as having brought about a profound change, in that fighting
the scapegoat has brought peaceful order instead of what was once
violent disorder.]{.underline} This is known as double-attribution.41
[The community sees the scapegoat as the origin of violence and the
source of peace.]{.underline} **[The scapegoat's existence is the reason
why violence and disorder exist, and through its destruction, peace is
restored]{.underline}**. For Girard, [double-attribution impedes our
ability to understand the true source of violence]{.underline}. While
the com- munity is not aware of the psychology at play, [it does
recognize that peace can be achieved by attacking the
scapegoat]{.underline}.42 "[What the mob fails to understand is (1) the
source of the crisis that led to the violence, and (2) the source of the
peace resulting from the violence.]{.underline} [The mob naturally
interprets that the victim was the source of disorder and the resulting
peace]{.underline}, although both of those factors originate with the
mob."43 Therefore, what began in mimesis is resolved through mimesis,
with one person [identifying the scapegoat followed by another and then
another until the whole group is able to victimize the scapegoat and
accuse the scapegoat of being the source of the]{.underline}. The
scapegoat mechanism is problematic in that [it never allows the group to
see the mimetic mechanism at work, and it therefore covers up the true
source of violence and distances the group from discovering the true
source of peace]{.underline}.44 The search by society for the true
origin of violence is sidetracked by its misattribution to the scapegoat
of the source of violence and peace. "We know already that [the
principle of mimetic desire, its rivalries, and the internal divisions
it creates are identical with the equally mimetic prin- ciple that
unifies the society: the scapegoat]{.underline}."45 But this is not an
inescapable cycle, since "once the basic mechanism is revealed, the
scapegoat mechanism, that expulsion of violence by violence, is rendered
useless by the revelation."46 So while the scapegoat makes it more
difficult to understand the true source of violence, we can end its
effect by exposing the scapegoat for what it is. Girard writes that
"[Two desires converging on the same object are bound to
clash.]{.underline} . . . In human relationships words like 'sameness'
and 'similarity' evoke an image of harmony. If we have the same tastes
and like the same things surely we are bound to get along. But what will
happen when we share the same desires?"47 Societies with stratified
social structures are able to keep mimetic desire peaceful, because S
and M are kept at a greater distance than in societies that have greater
amounts of equality. In this respect, Girard and Thomas Hobbes appear to
be on common ground, in that equality can lead to an increased hope of
attaining our desired ends.48 [Girard emphasizes this point when he
argues that erosion of differences breeds fear of sameness, which then
triggers violence.]{.underline} Girard uses Troilus and Cressida to show
how the destruc- tion of social differentiation can only lead to mimetic
violence.49 While Hobbes relies on a Leviathan to quell violence, Girard
sees the scapegoat fulfilling the same purpose (remember: Girard is not
a proponent of the scapegoat), but for Girard, [the scapegoat mechanism
is much more likely to be used, given the unlikelihood that barbarians
will take time away from killing one another to draw up a
contract]{.underline}. The most common examples outside of literature
and theology that have been explained in Girardian terms are [events
such as the Holocaust and the Salem witch trials]{.underline}. Such
events lend themselves to an obvious application of Girard's theory. In
each instance, [the chosen victim has nothing to do with the current
disorder experienced in the community. In each instance, the blame for
the disorder is put on the scapegoat, who then suffers atrocious levels
of violence. Communities then attribute the original disturbance and
subsequent]{.underline} peace to the scapegoats. In each instance, the
first lie and the incontestable claims are easily identified by later
commentators but are not seen by those living through the events. The
Girardian critique of the LDPT is obvious[. Nondemocracies are scape-
goats for democracies, thus allowing for a democratic
peace]{.underline}. [Once all nonde- mocracies are turned into
democracies, the LDPT will crumble, because there will be no
scapegoat]{.underline} available. Since [the LDPT does not understand
the sources of violence, it cannot adequately account for peace and it
cannot create peace]{.underline}. Moreover, the LDPT has done [damage to
our pursuit of an understanding of violence, as it has drawn attention
away from the original question]{.underline}. I do not think that
Girard's theory of violence in the international arena is above criti-
cism, and I do not think that it should be accepted without further
analysis---to suggest otherwise would be dogmatic. [The value of Girard
is that he forces us to address the source of violence before we can
come up with a solution to violence.]{.underline} [He gives us a theory
of violence that can be applied to the LDPT so that we can better
understand the empirical phenomenon.]{.underline} For some, [the LDPT
has found a solution without an understanding of why peace exists
between democracies or an understanding of why violence persists between
democracies and nondemocracies]{.underline}. Therefore, a Girardian
might say, it is premature to say democratization can lead to peace.

#### Extending democratic assistance cloaks the politicized nature of liberal values and demonizes those who disagree

**Rasch 2003** -- PhD, Henry H. H. Remak Professor of Germanic Studies
at Indiana University (William, Cultural Critique, 54, "Human Rights as
Geopolitics: Carl Schmitt and the Legal Form of American Supremacy",
Project MUSE

Yes, this passage attests to the antiliberal prejudices of an
unregenerate Eurocentric conservative with a pronounced affect for the
counterrevolutionary and Catholic South of Europe. It seems to resonate
with the apologetic mid-twentieth-century Spanish reception of Vitoria
that wishes to justify [the Spanish civilizing mission in the
Americas]{.underline}. [8](http://muse.jhu.edu.proxy.lib.umich.edu/journals/cultural_critique/v054/54.1rasch.html#FOOT8) But
the contrast between Christianity and humanism is not just prejudice; it
[is]{.underline} also [instructive, because with it, Schmitt tries to
grasp something]{.underline} both disturbing and elusive [about
the]{.underline} modern [world]{.underline}---namely, [the]{.underline}
apparent fact [that the liberal and humanitarian attempt to construct a
world of universal friendship produces]{.underline}, as if [by internal
necessity, ever new enemies.]{.underline}

For Schmitt, the Christianity of Vitoria, of Salamanca, Spain, 1539,
represents a concrete, spatially imaginable order, centered (still) in
Rome and, ultimately, Jerusalem. This, with its divine revelations, its
Greek philosophy, and its Roman language and institutions, is the polis.
[This is civilization, and outside its walls lie the
barbarians]{.underline}. The humanism that Schmitt opposes is, in his
words, a philosophy of absolute humanity. By virtue of its universality
and abstract normativity, it has no localizable polis, no clear
distinction between what is inside and what is outside. [Does humanity
embrace all humans?]{.underline} Are there no gates to the city and thus
no barbarians outside? [If not, against whom or what does it wage its
wars?]{.underline} We can understand Schmitt\'s concerns in the
following way: Christianity distinguishes between believers and
nonbelievers. Since nonbelievers can become believers, they must be of
the same category of being. To be human, \[End Page 135\]then, is the
horizon within which the distinction between believers and nonbelievers
is made. That is, [humanity]{.underline} per se is not part of the
distinction, but [is that which makes the distinction possible. However,
once the term]{.underline} used to describe the horizon of a distinction
[also becomes that distinction\'s positive pole, it needs its
negative]{.underline} opposite. If humanity is both [the]{.underline}
horizon and the positive pole of the distinction that that horizon
enables, then the negative pole can only be something that
lies beyond that horizon, can only be something completely antithetical
to horizon and positive pole alike---can only, in other words,
be [inhuman]{.underline}. As Schmitt says:

[Only with the concept]{.underline} of the human in the sense of
absolute humanity [does there appear as the other side of this
concept]{.underline} a speciWcally new enemy, [the inhuman]{.underline}.
In the history of the nineteenth century, setting off the inhuman from
the human is followed by an even deeper split, the one between the
superhuman and the subhuman. In the same way that the human creates the
inhuman, so in the history of humanity the superhuman brings about with
a dialectical necessity the subhuman as its enemy
twin.[9](http://muse.jhu.edu.proxy.lib.umich.edu/journals/cultural_critique/v054/54.1rasch.html#FOOT9)

[This]{.underline} \"two-sided aspect of the ideal of humanity\"
(Schmitt 1988, Der Nomos der Erde, 72) [is a theme Schmitt]{.underline}
had already [developed in]{.underline} his The Concept of the
Political (1976) and his [critiques of liberal pluralism]{.underline}
(e.g., 1988, Positionen und Begriffe, 151-65). His complaint there is
that [liberal pluralism is in fact not in the least pluralist but
reveals itself to be an overriding monism]{.underline}, the monism [of
humanity]{.underline}. Thus, despite the claims that pluralism allows
for the individual\'s freedom from illegitimate constraint, Schmitt
presses the point home that [political opposition to liberalism is
itself deemed illegitimate]{.underline}. Indeed, [liberal
pluralism]{.underline}, in Schmitt\'s eyes, reduces the political to the
social and economic and thereby [nullifies all]{.underline} truly
political [opposition by]{.underline} [simply excommunicating its
opponents from]{.underline} the High Church of [Humanity. After all,
only an unregenerate barbarian could fail to recognize the irrefutable
benefits of the liberal order.]{.underline}

Though he favorably opposes sixteenth-century Christianity to the
eighteenth-century Enlightenment, Schmitt has no interest in
reestablishing the hegemony of the Roman Church. Rather, he is in search
of conceptual weapons with which to fight the contemporary enemy. But it
is a failed search just as it is a failed contrast; for in Christianity,
Schmitt finds not the other of humanism, but humanism\'s roots. In \[End
Page 136\] truth, what Schmitt calls humanism is but an intensification
of the aspirations of the Roman Church. Unlike the Judaism from which it
sprang, Christianity is not a tribal or national religion, but a
religion of universal
pretensions. [10](http://muse.jhu.edu.proxy.lib.umich.edu/journals/cultural_critique/v054/54.1rasch.html#FOOT10) The
distinction between believer and nonbeliever is not a distinction
between tribe and tribe or nation and nation; it is not a distinction
between neighbor and foreigner or even one between finite and
localizable friends and enemies. Rather, ideally, in the Christian
world, the negative pole of the distinction is to be fully and finally
consumed without remainder. The differences between families, tribes,
nations, friends, and enemies are meant to disappear. In the final
analysis there is no room for opposition, neither within the City of God
nor against it, and the polis---call it Rome, call it Jerusalem---will
encompass the entire world. That is precisely the purpose of its
civilizing power. What Schmitt calls humanism is but a more complete
universalization of the same
dynamic. [11](http://muse.jhu.edu.proxy.lib.umich.edu/journals/cultural_critique/v054/54.1rasch.html#FOOT11) [Christianity
and humanism are both civilizing missions. In neither case can there be
barbarians left outside the gates because eventually there will be no
outside of the gates and, thus, no more gates.]{.underline} To live in
the city, the barbarians must thoroughly give up their barbarian
ways---their customs, their religion, their language. In the discourse
that equates the polis with humanity, to remain a barbarian is not to
remain outside the city, but to be included in the city as a moral and
legal outlaw and thus to come under the city\'s moral and legal
jurisdiction.

That [liberal America\'s civilizing mission is an extension of Christian
Europe\'s]{.underline} was clearly seen and approved of by James Brown
Scott who during his life (1866-1943) had been professor of
international law and foreign relations at Georgetown; both director and
secretary of the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace; president
of three American and European societies of international law; editor
and interpreter of Vitoria, Suarez, and Grotius; active propagandist for
the Allied cause during and after World War I; and loyal servant to
President Woodrow Wilson. Scott recognized the link between the conquest
of the New World and the splintering of the old. The \"discovery of
America,\" he wrote in a volume devoted to Vitoria and Suarez, \"gave
birth to a modern law of nations, Spanish in origin, lay in form, but
Catholic in fact and capable of continued development under the control
of that Christian morality of which all peoples, and \[End Page
137\] therefore all nations, are beneficiaries\" (Spanish Conception of
International Law, 1934, 2). This birth of a new law out of the spirit
of Christianity coincides with that religion\'s fragmentation, \"broken
by the Reformation,\" as Scott puts it, and \"replaced by an
international community, today \[1934\] universal and embracing all
peoples of all continents; the law applicable to members of the
Christian community was found to be applicable to non-Christians; and
the law of nations, once confined to Christendom, has become
international. Without ceasing to be Christian in fact, the law of
nations became laicized in form\" (Spanish Origin of International
Law, 1934, 1-2). In this way, Christianity survives its own
secularization and the Greco-Christian West rises from its ashes,
rechristened simply as the entire world. [The \"international
community]{.underline},\" Scott writes, \"[is coextensive with
humanity]{.underline}---no longer merely with Christianity;\" it has
become \"the representative of the common humanity rather than of the
common religion binding the States.\" [Therefore, the international
community \"possesses the inherent right to impose its will \...
and]{.underline} to [punish its violation]{.underline}, not because of a
treaty, or a pact or a covenant, but because of an international need\"
(283). If in the sixteenth century it was the Christian Church that
determined the content of this international need, in the twentieth
century and beyond it must be the secularized \"church\" of \"common
humanity\" that performs this all-important service. \"Vitoria\'s
idea,\" Scott reminds us, \"was to treat the Indians as brothers and as
equals, to help them in their worldly affairs, to instruct them in
spiritual matters and lead them to the altar by the persuasion of
Christian life on the part of the missionary\" (Spanish Conception of
International Law, 1934, 2). Thus, with the secularization of the
Christian mission comes also the secularization of the Christian
missionary, who still shows his brotherly love by exerting brotherly
correction.

Human Rights and the Inhuman Other

[In the past]{.underline}, we/they, neighbor/foreigner, [friend/enemy
polarities were inside/outside distinctions that produced a plurality of
worlds]{.underline}, separated by physical and cultural borders. [When
these worlds collided, it was not always]{.underline} a
[pretty]{.underline} picture, [but]{.underline} it was often [possible
to]{.underline} \[End Page 138\] [maintain the]{.underline} integrity of
the we/they [distinction, even to regulate it]{.underline} by
distinguishing between domestic and foreign affairs. [If \"they\"
differed, \"we\" did not]{.underline} always feel ourselves obliged to
[make \"them\"]{.underline} into [miniature versions of
\"us]{.underline},\" to Christianize them, [to civilize
them,]{.underline} to make of them good liberals. [Things have changed.
With a]{.underline} single-power global [hegemony]{.underline} that is
[guided by a universalist ideology, all relations]{.underline} have
[become]{.underline}, or threaten to become, [domestic]{.underline}. The
inner/outer distinction has been transformed into a morally and legally
determined acceptable/unacceptable one, and [the power]{.underline}
exists (or [is thought to exist),]{.underline} both spiritually and
physically, [to eliminate the unacceptable once and for all]{.underline}
and make believers of everyone. The new imperative states: [the
other shall be included.]{.underline} Delivered as a promise, [it can
only be received, by some, as an ominous threat]{.underline}.

In his The Conquest of America, Tzvetan Todorov approaches our
relationship to the \"other\" by way of three interlocking distinctions,
namely, self/other, same/different, and equal/unequal. A simple
superposition of all three distinctions makes of the other someone who
is different and therefore unequal. The problem we have been discussing,
however, comes to light when we make of the other someone who is equal
because he is essentially the same. This form of the universalist
ideology is assimilationist. It denies the other by embracing him. Of
the famous sixteenth-century defender of the Indians, Bartolomé de Las
Casas, Todorov writes,

\[his\] declaration of the equality of men is made in the name of a
specific religion, Christianity\.... Hence, there is a potential danger
of seeing not only the Indians\' human nature asserted but also their
Christian \"nature.\" \"The natural laws and rules and rights of men,\"
Las Casas said; but who decides what is natural with regard to laws and
rights? Is it not speciWcally the Christian religion? Since Christianity
is universalist, it implies an essential non-difference on the part of
all men. We see the danger of the identiWcation in this text of Saint
John Chrysostrom, quoted and defended at Valladolid: \"Just as there is
no natural difference in the creation of man, so there is no difference
in the call to salvation of all men, barbarous or wise, since God\'s
grace can correct the minds of barbarians, so that they have a
reasonable
understanding.\"[12](http://muse.jhu.edu.proxy.lib.umich.edu/journals/cultural_critique/v054/54.1rasch.html#FOOT12)

Once again we see that the term \"human\" is not descriptive, but
evaluative. [To be truly human, one needs to be corrected]{.underline}.
Regarding the relationship of difference and equality, Todorov
concludes, \"If it is \[End Page 139\] incontestable that the prejudice
of superiority is an obstacle in the road to knowledge, we must also
admit that the prejudice of equality is a still greater one, for it
consists in identifying the other purely and simply with one\'s own
\'ego ideal\' (or with oneself)\" (1984, 165). Such identification is
not only the essence of Christianity, but also of the doctrine of human
rights preached by enthusiasts like Habermas and Rawls. And [such
identification means that the other is stripped of]{.underline} his
[otherness and made to conform to the universal ideal of what it means
to be human]{.underline}.

And yet, despite---indeed, because of---the all-encompassing embrace,
the detested other is never allowed to leave the stage altogether. [Even
as we seem on the verge of]{.underline} actualizing Kant\'s dream, as
Habermas puts it, of \"a [cosmopolitan order\" that unites
all]{.underline} peoples [and abolishes war]{.underline} under the
auspices of \"the states of the First World\" who \"can afford to
harmonize their national interests to a certain extent with the norms
that define the halfhearted cosmopolitan aspirations of the UN\" (1998,
165, 184), it is still fascinating to see how the barbarians make their
functionally necessary presence felt. John Rawls, in his The Law of
Peoples (1999), conveniently divides the world into well-ordered peoples
and those who are not well ordered. Among the former are the
\"reasonable liberal peoples\" and the \"decent hierarchical peoples\"
(4). Opposed to them are the \"outlaw states\" and other \"burdened\"
peoples who are not worthy of respect. [Liberal peoples]{.underline},
who, by virtue of their history, [possess superior
institutions]{.underline}, culture, [and]{.underline} moral character
(23-25), [have]{.underline} not only the right to deny non-well-ordered
peoples respect, but [the duty to extend]{.underline} what Vitoria
called \"[brotherly correction]{.underline}\" and Habermas \"gentle
compulsion\" (Habermas 1997,
133). [13](http://muse.jhu.edu.proxy.lib.umich.edu/journals/cultural_critique/v054/54.1rasch.html#FOOT13) That
is, Rawls believes that the \"refusal to tolerate\" those states deemed
to be outlaw states \"is a consequence of liberalism and decency.\" Why?
[Because outlaw states violate human rights.]{.underline} What are human
rights? \"What I call human rights,\" Rawls states, \"are \... [a proper
subset of the rights possessed by citizens in a liberal]{.underline}
constitutional [democratic regime]{.underline}, or of the rights of the
members of a decent hierarchical society\" (Rawls 1999, 81). [Because of
their violation]{.underline} of these liberal rights, nonliberal,
[nondecent societies do not even have the right \"to protest their
condemnation]{.underline} by the world society\" (38), [and decent
peoples have the]{.underline} [right]{.underline}, if necessary, [to
wage just wars against them]{.underline}. Thus, \[End Page 140\]liberal
societies are not merely contingently established and historically
conditioned forms of organization; they become the universal standard
against which other societies are judged. Those found wanting are
banished, as outlaws, from the civilized world. [Ironically, one of the
signs of]{.underline} their [outlaw status is]{.underline} their
[insistence on]{.underline} autonomy, on [sovereignty]{.underline}. As
Rawls states, \"Human rights are a class of rights that play a special
role in a reasonable Law of Peoples: they restrict the justifying
reasons for war and its conduct, and they specify limits to a regime\'s
internal autonomy. In this way they reflect the two basic and
historically profound changes in how the powers of sovereignty have been
conceived since World War II\" (79). Yet, what Rawls sees as a postwar
development in the notion of sovereignty---that is, its
restriction---could not, in fact, have occurred had it not been for
the unrestricted sovereign powers of the victors of that war,
especially, of course, the supreme power of the United States. [The
limitation of (others\') sovereignty is an imposed limitation, imposed
by a sovereign state that has never relinquished its own sovereign
power]{.underline}. What for Vitoria was the sovereignty of Christendom
and for Scott the sovereignty of humanity becomes for Rawls the simple
but uncontested sovereignty of liberalism
itself. [14](http://muse.jhu.edu.proxy.lib.umich.edu/journals/cultural_critique/v054/54.1rasch.html#FOOT14)

So goes the contemporary refinement of the achievement that so impressed
Schmitt in 1932. \"Time and again,\" wrote Schmitt back then, sensing
what was to come,

the great superiority, the amazing political achievement of [the U.S.
reveals itself in the fact that it uses general, flexible
concepts]{.underline}\.... With regard to these decisive political
concepts, [it depends on who interprets, defines, and uses
them]{.underline}; who concretely decides what peace is, what
disarmament, what intervention, what public order and security are. One
of the most important manifestations of humanity\'s legal and spiritual
life is the fact that whoever has true power is able to determine the
content of concepts and words. Caesar dominus et supra grammaticam.
Caesar is also lord over grammar. (1988, Positionen und Begriffe, 202)

[For Schmitt, to assume that one can derive morally correct political
institutions from abstract, universal norms is to put the cart before
the horse.]{.underline} The truly important question remains: who
decides?[15](http://muse.jhu.edu.proxy.lib.umich.edu/journals/cultural_critique/v054/54.1rasch.html#FOOT15) [What
political power representing which political order defines terms like
human rights]{.underline} and public reason, defines, in fact, what it
means to be properly human? What political power distinguishes\[End Page
141\] between the decent and the indecent, between those who police the
world and those who are outlawed from it? Indeed, what political power
decides what is and what is not political? Habermas\'s contention that
normative legality neutralizes the moral and the political and that
therefore Schmitt \"suppresses\" the \"decisive point,\" namely, \"the
legal preconditions of an impartial judicial authority and a neutral
system of criminal punishment\" (1998, 200), is enough to make even an
incurable skeptic a bit nostalgic for the old Frankfurt School
distinction between affirmative and critical theory. One could observe,
for instance, that the \"universality\" of human rights has a very
particular base. As Habermas says:

Asiatic societies cannot participate in capitalistic modernization
without taking advantage of the achievements of an individualistic legal
order. One cannot desire the one and reject the other. From the
perspective of Asian countries, the question is not whether human
rights, as part of an individualistic legal order, are compatible with
the transmission of one\'s own culture. Rather, the question is whether
the traditional forms of political and societal integration can be
reasserted against---or must instead be adapted to---the hard-to-resist
imperatives of an economic modernization that has won approval on the
whole. (2001, 124)

#### Their dream of democratic inclusion only produces asphyxiating nightmares of absolute exclusion---the wars wrought by liberalism are categorically worse

**Rasch 2005** -- PhD, Henry H. H. Remak Professor of Germanic Studies
at Indiana University (Spring, William, The South Atlantic Quarterly,
104.2, "Lines in the Sand: Enmity as a Structuring Principle",

What Schmitt describes as an enviable achievement---that is, the
balanced order of restrained violence within Europe---presupposed the
consignment of unrestrained violence to the rest of the world. That is,
desired [restraint was founded upon sanctioned lack of
restraint]{.underline}. If Schmitt, by concentrating on the development
of European international law after the religious civil wars, highlights
an admirable local result of a disagreeable global process, this can be
attributed to his explicit Eurocentrism. But [even nonEurocentrics may
be dismayed by the twentieth-century reintroduction of unrestricted
violence within Europe itself]{.underline}. The epitome of this return
of the repressed may be the midcentury death camp, as Giorgio Agamben
maintains, 9 but its initial breakthrough is the Great War of the
century's second decade. For how else can one explain that a traditional
European power struggle that started in 1914 as a war fought for state
interest should end in 1918--19 as a war fought by ''civilization''
against its ''barbarian'' other? And how else can one explain that we
have been so eager to replicate this distinction in every war we have
fought ever since? [If]{.underline}, in other words, [we are rightly
horrified by the distinction between civilized and uncivilized when it
is used to describe]{.underline} the relationship of [Old Europe and its
colonial subjects, and]{.underline} if we are rightly horrified by the
distinction between the human and the in- or subhuman [when]{.underline}
it is [used to discriminate against blacks, Jews,]{.underline} Gypsies,
[and other]{.underline} [so-called undesirables, then why do we
persist]{.underline} today [in using these]{.underline} very
[distinctions]{.underline} when [combating our latest
enemies?]{.underline} Is it merely ironic or in fact profoundly
symptomatic that [those who most vehemently aﬃrm]{.underline} universal
symmetry (equality, [democracy) are also]{.underline} more often than
not [the ones who opt for the most asymmetrical means of locating
enemies and conducting war]{.underline}---that is, just wars fought for
a just cause?

But how are we to respond? For [those who say there is no war
and]{.underline} who [yet find]{.underline} themselves witnessing [daily
bloodshed]{.underline}, Adornoian asceticism (refraining from
participating in the nihilism of the political) or Benjaminian weak,
quasi, or other messianism (waiting for the next incarnation of the
historical subject \[the multitudes?\] or the next proletarian general
strike \[the event?\]) would seem to be the answer. To this, however,
those who say there is a war [can respond only with bewilderment.
Waiting for a ''completely new politics'']{.underline} 10 and completely
new political agents, waiting for the event and the right moment to name
it, or waiting for universal ontological redemption feels much like
waiting for the Second Coming, or, more accurately, for Godot. And [have
we not]{.underline} all [grown weary of waiting?]{.underline} The war we
call ''the political,'' whether nihilist or not, happily goes on while
we watch Rome burn. As Schmitt wrote of the relationship of early
Christianity to the Roman Empire, ''The belief that a restrainer holds
back the end of the world provides the only bridge between the notion of
an eschatological paralysis of all human events and a tremendous
historical monolith like that of the Christian empire of the Germanic
kings'' (60). One does not need to believe in the virtues of that
particular ''historical monolith'' to understand the dangers of
eschatological paralysis.

But as Max Weber observed firsthand, ascetic quietude leads so often, so
quickly, and so eﬀortlessly to the chiliastic violence that knows no
bounds; 11260 William Rasch and as we have lately observed anew, the
millennial messianism of imperial rulers and nomadic partisans alike
dominates the contemporary political landscape. [The true goal of those
who say there is no war is to eliminate the war that actually exists by
eliminating those]{.underline} Lyons and Tygers and other [Savage Beasts
who say there is a war. This war is the truly savage war. It is the war
we witness today. No amount of democratization]{.underline},
pacification[, or Americanization will mollify its eﬀects, because
democratization]{.underline}, pacification, and Americanization [are
among the weapons used]{.underline} by those who say there is no war to
wage their war to end all war.

[What is to be done?]{.underline} If you are one who says there is a
war, and if you say it not because you glory in it but because you fear
it and hate it, then [your goal is to limit it]{.underline} and its
eﬀects, [not eliminate it, which merely intensifies it, but limit it by
drawing clear lines]{.underline} within which it can be fought, and
clear lines between those who fight it and those who don't, lines
between friends, enemies, and neutrals, lines between combatants and
noncombatants. There are, of course, legitimate doubts about whether
those ideal lines could ever be drawn again; nevertheless, the question
that we should ask is not how can we establish perpetual peace, but
rather a more modest one: Can symmetrical relationships be guaranteed
only by asymmetrical ones? According to Schmitt, historically this has
been the case. ''The traditional Eurocentric order of international law
is foundering today, as is the old nomos of the earth. This order arose
from a legendary and unforeseen discovery of a new world, from an
unrepeatable historical event. Only in fantastic parallels can one
imagine a modern recurrence, such as men on their way to the moon
discovering a new and hitherto unknown planet that could be exploited
freely and utilized eﬀectively to relieve their struggles on earth''
(39). We have since gone to the moon and have found nothing on the way
there to exploit. We may soon go to Mars, if current leaders have their
way, but the likelihood of finding exploitable populations seems equally
slim. Salvation through spatially delimited asymmetry, even were it to
be desired, is just not on the horizon. And [salvation through
globalization]{.underline}, that is, [through global unity and equality,
is equally impossible, because today's asymmetry is not so much a
localization of the exception as it is an invisible generation of the
exception from within that formal ideal of unity]{.underline}, a
generation of the exception [as the diﬀerence between the human and the
inhuman outlaw]{.underline}, the ''Savage Beast, with whom Men can have
no Society nor Security.'' [We are, therefore, thrown back upon
ourselves]{.underline}, which is to say, upon those artificial ''moral
persons'' who act as our collective political identities. They used to
be called states. What they will be called in the future remains to be
seen. But, [if we think to establish]{.underline} a diﬀerentiated unity
of [discrete political entities]{.underline} that once represented for
Schmitt ''the highest form of order within the scope of human power,''
[then we must symmetrically manage the necessary pairing of inclusion
and exclusion without denying the ''forms of power]{.underline} and
domination'' [that]{.underline} inescapably [accompany human ordering.
We must think]{.underline} the possibility [of roughly equivalent power
relations rather than fantasize the elimination of power from the
political universe. This]{.underline}, conceivably, [was]{.underline}
also [Schmitt's solution]{.underline}. Whether [his idea]{.underline} of
the plurality of Großräume could ever be carried out under contemporary
circumstances [is]{.underline}, to be sure, more than a little
[doubtful, given]{.underline} that the [United States]{.underline}
enjoys a monopoly on guns, goods, and the Good, in the form of a
supremely eﬀective [ideology of]{.underline} universal
[''democratization.'' Still,]{.underline} we would do well to devise
vocabularies that do not just emphatically repeat philosophically more
sophisticated versions of the liberal ideology of painless, eﬀortless,
universal equality. The space of the political will never be created by
a bloodless, Benjaminian divine violence. Nor is it to be confused with
the space of the simply human. [To dream]{.underline} the dreams [of
universal inclusion]{.underline} may satisfy an irrepressible human
desire, but it [may]{.underline} also [always produce]{.underline}
recurring, [asphyxiating political nightmares of absolute
exclusion]{.underline}.

### Disaster response

#### The aff's empathetic appeal normalizes disaster and eradicates recalcitrant forms of difference which makes resistance impossible 

**Duffield 19** (Mark, Global Insecurities Centre, University of
Bristol, "Post-Humanitarianism: Governing Precarity through Adaptive
Design", Journal of Humanitarian Affairs Volume 1, No. 1)

[Compared to the political solidarity that underpinned direct
humanitarian action, Lilie Chouliaraki has argued that today's
**post-humanitarianism is grounded on empathy** -- including the ability
of aid workers or the public to understand and emotionally associate
with the experiences of the disaster-affected]{.underline}. [This
post-humanist privileging of the subconscious also changes how poverty
and exposure to disaster are perceived]{.underline}. Rather than
demanding political change, vulnerability becomes a direct or unmediated
experience characteristic of the life-world of the person concerned.
[Just as important as material aid, if not more so, is fast access to
sympathetic value-added information]{.underline}. With design having
supplanted politics within the post-humanitarian canon, **[the
discursive field is bounded by the interplay between the empathy of the
onlooker or practitioner and the direct experience of the
affected]{.underline}**. **[The aim is no longer to control or contain
disasters -- it's more about improving how they are
experienced.]{.underline}**

The arrival of satellite sensing and data informatics enables the
constant hard choices made by the precariat to be visualised as
behavioural patterns (Meier, 2015). [Through the cybernetic feedback
loops of adaptive design, behavioural economics seeks to reverse
engineer]{.underline}, if you will, [the experience of
poverty.]{.underline} The aim is to increase the mental bandwidth
available to the precariat by optimising behaviour. [This includes the
timely and iterative delivery of context-specific, value- added
information together with the deployment of smart humanitarian objects
and technologies]{.underline} that compensate slum-dwellers for the
absence of an infrastructural fixed grid.

Behavioural economics is premised upon the constant tailoring and
readjustment of information 'to fit the human body and its cognitive
abilities' (World Bank, 2015: 2). The feedback process of adaptive
design has four distinct stages: first, behaviour must be captured,
stored and algorithmically analysed; second, the returned information
must be personalised to the individual or group in a way that resonates
emotionally; third, this value-added information should illuminate a way
forward; and, finally, there must be a clear moment when the individual
can, through actions or choices, recalibrate their behaviour. This
recalibration is measured, 'and the feedback loop can run once more,
every action stimulating new behaviours that inch us closer to our
goals' (Geotz, 2011). Resilience, with its emphasis on constant
adaptation, sits well with ideas of feedback and design.

Social reproduction can be optimised by changing behaviour relating to
household savings, energy consumption, educational priorities, mental
and physical productivity and maternal and child health (World Bank,
2015: 2). Taken together, these factors are important for the
reproduction of the cheap, territorially immobile, low-level
sensorimotor skills (Joshi, 2017) that drive the vast informal economies
of the global South. Mind, Society, and Behaviour emphasises in several
places that cognitive techniques cost relatively little, need not be
complex and are already widely practised in the private sector. Rather
than requiring radical change to existing aid programming, it is largely
a question of 'nuances of design and implementation' (ibid.: 3). Taking
'the cognitive taxes of poverty into account' (ibid.: 81) might simply
involve changing the timing of cash transfers, altering the labelling on
foodstuffs, simplifying processes or service take up, sending out
regular reminders, marketing new social norms or 'reducing salience of
stigmatised identities' (ibid.: 3). The cognitive tax on the precariat
could be reduced by shifting the timing of critical decision-making
regarding, for example, education, health or employment 'away from
periods when cognitive capacity and energy (bandwidth) are predictably
low'. At the same time, assistance can be targeted 'to decisions that
may require a lot of bandwidth' (ibid.: 81). For the Bank, not only is
large-scale redistribution unnecessary, improving the experience of
precarity also costs little and creates minimal organisational demands.

Another important aspect of cognitive streamlining and experience
improvement concerns critical infra- structure. In a gesture of
transparency, [humanitarian innovation accepts that after sixty years of
terrestrial development, a billion or more people still lack access to
piped water, stable electricity, proper waste disposal, adequate
housing, comprehensive schooling, professional health care and regular
financial services. Levelling up or reconstructing a fixed grid,
however, hasn't been a serious international objective since the onset
of the downturn.]{.underline} The logistical mega-corridors that are
being built sidestep the crisis of urban renewal. [This aversion has
deepened with the growing infrastructural gap, accumulating disrepair
and damage caused by natural disasters and wars, the massive urbicidal
destruction unleashed in the Middle East and the ongoing dispossessions
resulting from the expanding mega-corridors themselves]{.underline}. For
the World Bank, the crisis of urban renewal negatively impacts precariat
bandwidth. Having to daily exert a great deal of mental energy just to
access such basic necessities as food and clean water means the
precariat 'are left with less energy for careful deliberation than
those, simply by virtue of living in an area with good infrastructure
and good institutions' (ibid.: 13). Thus, the absence of a universal
fixed grid 'like piped water, organised child care, and direct deposit
and debit \[accounts for\] earnings -- encumber those living in low
income setting with a number of day-to-day decisions that deplete mental
resources even further' (ibid.: 81). Since the mid 2000s, reflecting the
call for an inclusive capitalism, [the increasing corporatisation of
poverty has been evident]{.underline} (Schwittay, 2011). One register of
this has been the rapid growth of commodities, objects and financial
products specifically designed for the precariat (Cross and Street,
2009). With behavioural economics providing a cognitive justification,
**[the goal of humanitarian innovation is to normalise the application
of private sector business models and smart technology to chronic
poverty and disaster vulnerability]{.underline}** (Betts and Bloom,
2014: 5).

Technoscience is developing a series of add-ons to address the crisis of
urban renewal. Unlike the levelling- up effects of a universal fixed
grid, however, smart technology is different -- it levels downwards
(Duffield, 2016). It folds into the fabric of society, adapting and
adjusting itself to the inequalities encountered, and the differences of
speed and bandwidth found. Smart technology adapts itself to the social
milieus within which it operates (Zuckerberg, 2014). Throughout the
global South, there is an expanding suite of smart humanitarian objects
and technologies providing a range of services that support the social
reproduction of the precariat by substituting for an absent fixed- grid
(Jacobsen, 2015). Together with cash-transfer programmes (Lavinas,
2013), this includes biometric registration and experimentation with
block-chain authentication as a means of managing aid and work
entitlements (Dodgson and Genc, 2017). Solar power lighting and charging
solutions are widely marketed together with portable ceramic water
filtration systems (Redfield, 2015). Replacing a need for medically-
staffed feeding centres, take-away mother-administered therapeutic foods
to tackle malnutrition are now common (Scott-Smith, 2013). Making good
the paucity of health and educational services, e-medicine and
e-learning smart phone apps are being widely trialled.

While these are only a few of the many objects and services available,
[a common feature is an emphasis on self-administration, personalisation
and portability. Rather than invoke the community solidarity that
underpinned earlier forms of participant development, these smart
technologies now call forth dependent communities of users permanently
enrolled in prototyping the technologies that govern them]{.underline}
(Duffield, 2018).

Eliminating Professionals

From the outset, the aim of cybernetics was to exclude human beliefs,
motivations and intentions from the development of the human--machine
interface (Halpern, 2014). Now a defining feature of late-modernity,
this exclusion shaped early computer programming. Politically, it found
a reflection in the counter-cultural anticipation of artificial
intelligence as a means of undermining the professional hierarchies of
modernism. Computers would, it was argued, allow the design capabilities
and expertise of professionals to be transferred to the popular masses
(Turner, 2006). In the mid 1970s, the architect Nicholas Negroponte11
sought to eliminate professional privilege by facilitating public
participation and ownership of the architectural design process through
computer programming. The intention was to create 'soft architectural
machines' that could translate human imperfections, anxieties and
emotions into the rich architectural designs of a 'new "redesigned"
design process' (Negroponte, 2003: 359). Defining Negroponte's approach
to programming was a constructivist conception of learning by doing --
the analogy being how a child is said to learn. Not so much through
formal teaching 'but by interacting with the world, by having certain
results as a consequence of being able to ask for something, or being
able to stand up and reach it' (Negroponte, 2006: 1-53) -- that is,
through endless feedback loops of iterative environmental interaction
involving an automatic and continuous process of reaching out, discovery
and recalibration. Such constructivist assumptions regarding human
learning have long operated as place-holders for the arrival of
machine-thinking.12

Running parallel with early computer programming, by the 1980s
constructivism was also appearing in the form of progressive pro-poor
international development. Michael Edwards (1987), for example, in his
celebrated piece, The Irrelevance of Development Studies, rehearses the
late-modern antagonism towards professional knowledge using the
post-humanist premise that the 'real world' is defined by its empirical
diversity and complexity. And hence, echoing Hayekian neoliberalism,
largely beyond human comprehension. Development problems are specific to
a given time and place. Indigenous livelihood and coping systems have
evolved over centuries through discrete, complex interactions between
people and their 'hostile environmental conditions' (Edwards, 1987:
120). Rather than trying to transfer knowledge through explanation,
demonstration and reason, like Negroponte's child, authentic learning is
the organic product of trial and error on the part of local communities.
Development professionals short-circuit this natural process and prevent
people from thinking and acting for themselves. Anticipating the
attention- deficit Homo inscius, the role of progressive NGO-led
participatory development was to sensitively guide and empathetically
allow for the constraints, imperfections, anxieties, fears and emotions
shaping the actions 'of real, living people' (ibid.: 121). Putting the
last first, as it were, so they can reinvent their own more authentic
wheel.

Behavioural economics radically extends progressive neoliberalism's
antipathy towards professional hierarchies from individual comportment
to institutions themselves. Not only are aid managers subject to
cognitive bias and mindset limitations, the ability of organisations to
reform or improve is also now ques- tioned. In separating itself from
the failures of the past, humanitarian innovation problematises the
concerted attempts since the 1990s to professionalise the aid system,
especially the numerous moves to standardize humanitarian engagement
through behavioural codes, ground rules, technical guidelines and
performance benchmarking (Fiori et al., 2016).

Reflecting late-capitalism's disdain for independent standards and
autonomous expertise, side-lining humanitarian professionalism can be
seen as a necessary condition for the increasing involvement of the
private sector (Meier, 2012). While aid managers may have more bandwidth
than the precariat, for the World Bank (2015) their thinking is equally
constrained by established subconscious reflexes, mental models and
heuristic devices. Such 'deeply ingrained mindsets' (ibid.: 180)
constrain decision making in many ways. Besides the confirmation bias of
favouring evidence that supports one's views, they can also limit the
ability to empathise with the experience of the precariat. Importantly,
when faced with change and complexity, the 'automatic' mind reverts to
rules, standardisation and guidelines (ibid.: 180--2). Given the
unthinking recourse to such limiting heuristics among aid professionals,
it is particularly important for organisations to have mechanisms in
place 'to check and correct for their biases and blind spots' (ibid.:
183). Based upon the creation of iterative feedback loops
interconnecting aid mangers and the disaster-affected, adaptive design
provides such a mechanism.

For the World Bank, adaptive design involves front- loading problem
diagnosis, building in constant proto- typing, tolerating failure and
changing institutional incentives to counter professional mental models
and rule-based thinking (ibid.: 192--3). The aim of adaptive design is
to correct the cognitive biases of aid managers while, through
increasing bandwidth, encouraging the agency, auto-projectising and
self-acting capacities of the precariat. Important here is strengthening
the empathy of managers while improving the users' experience of the
system. The Humanitarian Policy Group's (HPG, 2018), A Design
Experiment: Imagining Alternative Humanitarian Action, is a
comprehensive attempt to envision such an exercise.

Liquefying Resistance

From an adaptive design perspective, [**rather than top- down
one-size-fits-all interventions, humanitarian agencies should constantly
change** organisational form according to the nature of the emergency
involved. This requires situating the design process within the lived
experience of all key actors]{.underline}. Apart from those directly
affected by the disaster, this includes the practitioners working within
the system as well as those actors ancillary to it (ibid.: 48). The aim
is to identify the key 'touch points' that offer the least resistance to
reform. To illustrate the ideal process, HPG has constructed a number of
behavioural profiles which it calls 'personas'. They are 'fictitious
characters who bring to life the needs, goals, values, drivers and
behaviours of larger groups of people' (ibid.: 49). As with the
humanitarian objects mentioned above, rather than potentially autonomous
self-acting communities, these profiles suggest a recast- ing of the
disaster-affected as so many surveilled communities of bandwidth-users
permanently enrolled in prototyping the means of their governance.

Possible aid manager mindset profiles include, for example, the
'cautious investigator', the 'defender of turf', the 'critical thinker',
the 'proceduralist', the 'constrained leader' and the 'risk taker'.
Among the disaster-affected one encounters the 'change agent', the
'embracer', the 'over-burdened', the 'reluctant', the 'self-reliant',
the 'system-reliant' and the 'under-served' (ibid.: 52--3). Each of
these profiles is given his/her appropriate aspirations, frustrations,
and changes they would like to see. A Design Experiment also includes
the creation of post-humanist user 'experience maps' covering a dozen
different emergency situations. Each one gives an example of how such
behavioural profiles could interact, while highlighting what is enabling
or disabling, or spoiling the user experience of the humanitarian
system. Such profiles and maps are argued to be useful as they allow 'us
to walk in users shoes by traveling \[sic\] with them as they interact
with a service/organisation/system' (ibid.: 61). These experience maps
not only show a person's touch points with the system, but 'also their
thoughts and feelings about that experience' (ibid.). Through
incentives, actor alignment and sequencing, key touch points can be
reimagined as design sites for leveraging institutional adaptation and
improving user experience.

Like the World Bank, HPG maintains that implement- ing such a programme
does not require major change to what already happens -- it does not
need 'whole system, top-down re-design' (ibid.: 61). If the aim is for
organisations to flexibly adapt to the changing require- ments of
permanent emergency, such a top-down rede- sign would, in any case, be a
contradiction in terms. Instead, within A Design Experiment, we can see
some- thing different. Building on progressive neoliberalism's
questioning of professional hierarchies, organisational boundaries are
also now dissolving and liquefying (Bauman, 2000). Touch points, which
vary according to the nature of the emergency, the mindsets of managers
and social milieu impacted, are transitory portals that allow a
penetration and reaching across organisational boundaries. They enable
mangers to improve their emp- athy while increasing the
disaster-affected's positive experience of the aid system.

This interaction of behavioural profiles raises the question -- if this
design experiment is to succeed, what type of manager or recipient
behaviour is ideally preferred or allowed? An examination of HPG's actor
profiles reveals an excess of positivity. While many exhibit
difficulties, constraints and fears, none present a fundamental or
systemic challenge. [There is an assumption that, in opening to
divergent cross-boundary interactions, success is possible because
reasonable people recognise some shared responsibility in making aid
better]{.underline}. While HPG's profiles display various potentials,
limitations and conflicts, ultimately every- one involved -- aid
workers, donors and the disaster- affected -- share the same
humanitarian goal of better 'access to basic services, safety, and
opportunity, with the capacity to absorb shocks, and the agency to shape
her/his future' (HPG, 2018: 90). [In other words, A Design Experiment is
thinkable because,]{.underline} in the last analysis, [all actors think
the same]{.underline}.

Paraphrasing Bruno Latour (2008), [the profiles that animate A Design
Experiment tend to privilege compliant feminised design sentiments such
as attachment, precaution, entanglement, dependence and care. Absent are
troublesome masculine tropes like emancipation, detachment,
modernization, progress and mastery]{.underline}. From the start of the
experiment, **[the negativity and recalcitrance that defines the real
world is excluded]{.underline}**. Within HPG's 'experience maps' you
will find no angry Arab refugees tearing down the razor-wire keeping
them out of Europe. [History's awkward customers are absent -- no
stone-throwing Palestinians, no Hutu refugees, no Darfuri nomads. You
will look in vain for the ground friction and anger shaping our present
predicament]{.underline} (Mishra, 2017**[). And without the negative,
critique is impossible]{.underline}**.

[Humanitarian innovation reflects progressive neoliberalism's recoil
from the negative]{.underline}. **[Determined to disavow the alterity of
the Other for the security of the Same, 'our society of positivity is
steering clear of everything that offers resistance]{.underline}**'
(Han, 2013: 33). Helped by the erosion of professional hierarchies,
organisational responsibilities and independent autonomy, [under the
conditions of late-capitalism the power to resist is, itself,
disappearing -- that is, the negative potency of being able to say no,
to remain unknown, uncounted and forgotten]{.underline}. **[It is the
power to interrupt, to slow the flow, and create spaces where things can
be stopped and discussed]{.underline}** (Rouvroy, 2012[). To gain entry
to the mega-corridors of spiralling feedback loops optimistically
failing-forward to an uncertain future, **humanitarian innovation
demands compliance, behavioural malleability and**, not least, necessary
**ignorance**. Unfortunately for post-humanitarianism, however, **it has
little to offer in return -- other, that is, than timely value-added
information such that the precariat can positively enjoy the experience
of its own abjection.**]{.underline}

It might appear paradoxical to find a [political ideology -- usually

world-views -- engaged in the theoretical and political exorcizing of
the 'other'**. What this peculiar articulation of liberalism within the
international context therefore reveals are the boundaries of liberalism
itself, the limits it imposes on plurality and
difference**]{.underline}, and the outline of the 'fundamental unity',
the 'common trunk' from which diversity may 'branch out' (Connolly 1995:
93). Underlying the liberal project to rearticulate the logic of
international politics and to overcome the effects of anarchy are two
central assumptions about the identity of its referent subjects and
about the logic of history. Both assumptions impose severe limits on the
expressions of plurality that liberalism can tolerate. First, ['liberal
ideology holds that individuals everywhere are fundamentally the 118 L.
S. Bishai and A. Behnke same, and are best off pursuing
self-preservation and material well-being]{.underline}\.... **[Thus all
individuals share an interest in peace, and should want war only as an
instrument to bring about peace' (]{.underline}**Owen 2000: 344). And
further, '[liberal States are believed to be reasonable, predictable,
and trustworthy, because they are governed by their citizens' true
interests, which harmonize with all individuals' true interests around
the world']{.underline} (ibid.: 353--354). **[Difference, in other
words, is but an appearance that hides a deeper, underlying harmony and
identity of 'mankind'.]{.underline}** Politics is therefore first and
foremost a matter of bringing this harmony about. Any mechanism
preventing this from happening -- **[the anarchical structure of the
international system, international law and institutions -- is by
definition illegitimate. It is this assumption of metaphysical identity
that warrants the claims by liberal states to speak for]{.underline}**
'You, the people' (Byers and Chesterman 2000), to suspend their right to
self-determination, as circumstances do not permit it to be exercised by
the people themselves. Concomitantly, this harmony provides a telos for
the liberal project. **[The story told by liberals like Fox, Reisman and
Slaughter is one of an approaching 'world of liberal states' (Slaughter
1995). International institutions are paying increasing attention to
standards of human rights and democracy in countries, even authorizing
interventions by force to re-establish democratic
regimes]{.underline}**. '[History may not be over yet, but the United
Nations and other international organizations are doing their best to
end it' (Owen 2000: 343). As the democratization of the international
system is therefore no longer an ideal far removed from the realities of
international politics, it becomes unacceptable not to realize this
final epiphany of the liberal subject. Based on these two mutually
reinforcing assumptions**, the liberal project can displace the
political and articulate instead a discourse of moral obligation for the
liberation of the oppressed individuals in non-democratic states**.
S]{.underline}uspending the international (legal) system between
**[mutually reinforcing notions of individualism and universalism, the
political and its concern with the limits of community and violence are
displaced.]{.underline}** In its stead we find a boundless, and
therefore empty, political subjectivity, and a notion of war that
assumes its metaphysical justness -- and thereby knows no inherent
limits. In other words, 'intervention becomes the normal and central
legal institution in this system' (Schmitt 1988: 17).10 [A third
assumption of liberalism connects this arrogation of voice to speak for
other people with the DPT. **While democracy within liberal societies is
supposed to provide the conditions of possibility for political
plurality, its articulation in the theoretical context of the
international society resists its own pluralization. As argued above,
DPT is based on the problematic assumption that in the international
realm, democracy defines identity rather than plurality. In the liberal
mind, democracy becomes homologous; the heterologous conditions of the
anarchical system are too much for it to bear.**]{.underline}

#### Liberalist conceptions of peace and solidarity are justified with the increasing violence to sustain a project of modernity as attempts to theologically homogeneously cleanse humanity 

**Petito 07 (**petito, fabio. (2007). The International Political
Thought of Carl Schmitt. From Humanized War to Humanitarian Intervention

he first relationship arises from their joint location in a long line of
thought and policy offering both a worldview and a political programme
of modernity in which violence and war dissipate, in which war is
gradually replaced by rules and principled behaviour (see Held 2002;
Joas 2003). One might say, in other words, that both **[the War on
Terror and liberal cosmopolitanism are located within the modernist
vision of the end of war.]{.underline}** Hans Joas has eloquently called
this 'the dream of a modernity without violence' (2003: 29[). That
cosmopolitanism seeks 'perpetual' peace is often acknowledged through
cosmopolitanism's intellectual debt to Immanuel Kant]{.underline}
(1991). That the War on Terror is located in this understanding of
modernity is less obvious, perhaps, but becomes increasingly apparent
when one examines the rhetorical framing and understanding of the War on
Terror as a fight that will not be abandoned until terrorism is rooted
out. The terrorist acts of 11 September 2001 in the seat of this
dream**[, the United States of America, were an unforgivable affront to
this modernist and liberal cosmopolitan vision of perpetual
peace]{.underline}**. At the same time**[, modernity's dream to end war
has repeatedly had the opposite effect, signalling a much neglected
paradox, that '\[a\] political project based concretely upon an ideal of
"peace" has continually produced its nemesis, war']{.underline}** (Reid
2004: 65**[). It is not only that the search for peace has time and
again led to war -- it is the very intensification of war within the
horizon of liberal modernity that is worth investigating]{.underline}**.
[Schmitt's own assessment in the Nomos of prior liberal attempts to
abolish war, such as those undertaken by the League of Nations, suggests
that 'any abolition of war without true bracketing \[has historically\]
resulted only in new, perhaps even worse types of war, such as
reversions to civil war and other types of wars of
annihilation]{.underline}' (2003: 246). Reid, more recently, echoes this
insight: Not only does the recurrence of war throughout modernity serve
to underline its paradoxical character**[. But the very forms of war
that recur are of such increasing violence and intensity as to threaten
the very sustainability of the project of modernity understood in terms
of the pursuit of perpetual peace.]{.underline}** (2004: 65) 136 L.
Odysseos The War on Terror, therefore, is an exceedingly exemplary
manifestation of the paradox of liberal modernity and war: of the
occurrence of ever more violent types of war within the very attempt to
fight wars which would end 'war' as such. [Moreover, it is an example of
how the cosmopolitan order's emphasis on the erasure of geopolitical
lines through universal humanity fails not only to end war, but even to
bracket and limit it, causing not its humanisation but its
intensification and dehumanisation.]{.underline} With Schmitt, we might
recall that a new type of war also requires a new type of enemy: 'it is
an apparent fact', Rasch argues, 'that the liberal and humanitarian
attempt to construct a world of universal friendship produces, as if by
internal necessity, ever new enemies' (2003: 135). As discussed above,
the discourse of humanity enables the creation of 'a category of
political non-persons, since those who fall outside of these
delineations become . . . subject to a demonization which permits not
simply their defeat, but their elimination' (Bellamy 2000: 85). In the
case of the War on Terror, the 'freedom-hating' recalcitrant others,
those subjects of other 'modernities' entangled with the liberal one
(Therborn 2003), become those to be excised from the global liberal
order. The War on Terror denies any rationality or justice to its
enemies and, perhaps, to those who oppose its practices. Schmitt's
argument in the Nomos reminds us that the unlikely, but significant,
achievement of the Westphalian order was the development of the notion
of justus hostis, alongside the concept of nondiscriminatory war[, which
allowed war to become limited in nature but also peace to be considered
possible with one's enemies. Nowadays, when enemies are denied this
procedural kind of 'justness', peace cannot be made with them, nor are
they allowed a right to differ, resist or defend themselves.
Importantly, cosmopolitans and their critics are now jointly faced with
the incessant usage of the notion of an unjust enemy in the War on
Terror, which relies on the reintroduction of just cause for one's own
side and points to an 'other' who has to be fought until there is no
more resistance.]{.underline}

### Econ / Trade

#### Economic interdependence is the means by which sovereign states wage "just wars" against liberal outlaws

**Watson 2005** -- PhD from Duke, editor of the Minnesota Review,
Associate Professor in the Department of Foreign Languages at Virginia
Tech (Spring, Janell, The South Atlantic Quarterly, 104.2, "Oil Wars, or
Extrastate Conﬂict ''beyond the Line'': Schmitt's Nomos, Deleuze's War
Machine, and the New Order of the Earth", WEA)

[Today's divide between]{.underline} the international order of [truly
sovereign states and its outside is based on]{.underline} a state
sovereignty guaranteed not only by territorial integrity and
constitutional stability, but also, most importantly, by [a minimum
threshold of economic strength within international markets. Interstate
law]{.underline} (U.N. resolutions, interstate treaties[) is closely
shadowed by]{.underline} international [economic
institutions]{.underline} (the World Trade Organization, World Bank, and
International Monetary Fund) [controlled by the select few]{.underline}
and working to the advantage of the Great Powers. [Schmitt argued that
the very shift from the political to the economic, a shift he attributes
to the United States]{.underline} (235, 255--57), [destroyed the spatial
basis of the earth's nomos, plunging the world into the chaos of
universalism]{.underline}. ''Precisely here---in the economy---the old
spatial order of the earth lost its structure'' (237). I instead suspect
that Schmitt's insistence on terrestrial space was a way of denying the
economic advantages enjoyed by his own long-lost Europe.

[The oil wars in the Middle East show]{.underline} clearly [that the
territory of weak states]{.underline} or nonstates [is]{.underline} very
much [distinguishable from the territory of the truly sovereign states.
A new kind of bracketing of war has been achieved]{.underline} among
that group of sovereign states [that corresponds more or less to the
G-8]{.underline} countries: conﬂict takes place only on the soil of the
[weaker nations]{.underline} in the Middle East, Eastern Europe, Africa,
Southeast Asia, or South America. These [are the ''unjust enemies''
who]{.underline} often [refuse to follow the rules]{.underline} of
bracketed war, [as illustrated by the American military's]{.underline}
constant [complaints of]{.underline} the illegal combatants, [terrorist
tactics]{.underline}, and torture of prisoners by its weak-state and
nonstate enemies. Meanwhile, it is diﬃcult to imagine interstate war
breaking out among the Great Powers on their own metropolitan soil. [The
oil war]{.underline} of today [most resembles a colonial war of
appropriation waged on soil ''beyond the line'' of the
strongest]{.underline} sovereign [states]{.underline} (142, 163), [but
with the aim of securing access to resources, rather than occupying
territory. These are not interstate wars among equals but wars that pit
proper sovereign states]{.underline} (the United States and its stronger
allies) [against weak states]{.underline} (Iraq).

**Trade and growth are covert means to strip other nations of the right
to disagree with us**

[Reshaping the world order]{.underline} goes beyond this as well: it
[entails the disciplining of the members of this order]{.underline},
whose tendencies toward laxity and fragmentation provide openings for
terrorism. [The U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates [must bring the
world into ever greater conformity with the values that
will]{.underline} pre- serve and [advance the world. This
means]{.underline} not only securing cooperation for U.S. military and
police actions by "convincing or compelling states to accept their
sovereign responsibilities" (National Security 2002, 6), but
[reorganizing the world according to the principles of free enterprise
and free trade. Political antagonism can be eliminated through its
transformation into economic competition]{.underline}. "We have our best
chance since the rise of the nation-state in the seventeenth century to
build a world where the great powers compete in peace instead of prepare
for war" (Bush 2002b). [A world order based on economic competition
instead of military competition enables the reign of the politics of
civil relations]{.underline}, leading to peace and pros- perity for all.
In this order, [no nation will need any longer to worry about the
politics of self-preservation---that is, no nation but the United
States.]{.underline}

**Economic liberalization is a way of displacing enmity to other fields,
where it manifests more menacingly**

**Thorup, 06** -- Ph.D. dissertation @ the Institute of Philosophy and
the History of Ideas (Mikkel, January, 2006, "In Defence of Enmity --
Critiques of Liberal Globalism," p. 117)

Depoliticized 'enmity' (or displaced/denied enmity) is the pacified
enemy. Schmitt both acknowledges depoliticization as one of the premier
achievements of modernity and speaks ironically of the liberal
interpretation of this as the end of enmity as such. [The depoliticized
enemy is transformed into the competitor in the economic
field]{.underline} and into the debating partner in the field of
politics. [Instead of a clear distinction between war and peace, we get
the dynamics of]{.underline} a [perpetual competition]{.underline} and a
perpetual discussion (1996a: 28). Liberalism creates a 'whole system of
pacified \[entmilitarisierter\] and depoliticized concepts' (1996a: 70).
Schmitt maintains that the internal [pacification or depoliticization is
conditional upon its external projection in]{.underline} both the
conventional and the [unconventional enmity.]{.underline} But this is
not an end of enmity, as liberalism tends to think. [Enmity is displaced
to other fields such as the international or]{.underline} it is
conditioned upon the unconventional or [internal enmity. When the
international]{.underline} or conventional [enmity is denied, enmity
will turn inwards and ignite uncontrollable expressions of violence and
hate]{.underline}. The paradigmatic form of the depoliticized enmity is
what Schmitt (1988: 272) calls 'conflict partners'. [Its present
manifestation is hegemonic liberalism and one of its unintended results
is the returns of enmity.]{.underline}

### Ethics (Liberal)

#### Moral norms and interventions are attempts to eliminate otherness. Since difference is inevitable, the drive to abolish binaries can only amplify conflict and backfire

**Behnke & Bishai 7**, Lecturer in the Department of Politics and
International Relations at the University of Reading & Senior Program
Officer in the Education Program at the United States Institute of Peace
\[Linda S. & Andreas, "War, violence and the displacement of the
political", in The International Political thought of Carl Schmitt, eds.
Louiza Osysseos and Fabio Petito, pg. 119- 21\]

From a Schmittian perspective, nothing of this should come as a
surprise. One can try to deny, suppress, or displace the political, yet
one can never abolish it. The problem is in what fashion [the political
emerges in different ideologies.]{.underline} As Gary Ulmen has pointed
out, for Schmitt, the 'key to the concept of the Political is . . . not
enmity but the distinction itself' (Ulmen 1987: 189). [The political is
therefore based on the reality of difference and of plurality in
international society. One should not exaggerate this point and
romanticize this reality too much. Neither identity nor difference can
claim moral or ethical priority as such.]{.underline} Hence, [no moral
privilege can be assigned to the 'other', as some 'post-modern' ethics
have tried to do]{.underline}. [The main concern]{.underline} for
realists like Schmitt [is instead to limit the inherent violence in a
system of difference that has no recourse to a higher political,
judicial or moral authority]{.underline}. Irreconcilable differences
abound, and violence is thus a systemic condition, always implicated in
the decisions between self and other, friend and enemy, and always a
potentiality in the rela-tions between these entities. For Schmitt, [the
distinction between friend and enemy establishes a limit for conflict by
associating it with]{.underline} what William Con- nolly has called
'[agonistic respect']{.underline} (Connolly 1994: 166--167). In
Schmitt's terms, 'according to traditional international law, [war finds
its right, its honour and its dignity in the fact that the enemy is no
pirate and no gangster, but a "state" and a "subject of international
law]{.underline}"' (Schmitt 1988: 48--49). [The recognition of sovereign
equality,]{.underline} and the concomitant recognition that the only
universally acceptable norm is the absence of universal norms,
[imposes]{.underline} a modicum of [restraint]{.underline} upon the
exercise of violence, as it divests states of morality and truth as
legitimizing resources. Again, if 'agonistic respect' sounds too
romantic in this context, [one might justify the restraint imposed upon
the exercise of force against other states by the prudent recognition
that 'our' ideas, values and principles may not be the solution to the
problems in other places.]{.underline} Moreover, and [in regard to the
liberal fondness for liberating 'oppressed' people, the right of
self-determination that is at the heart of the democratic entitle- ment
vests in none other than the people, and]{.underline} . . [. it is they
-- not some foreign power that they have similarly not elected -- who
must determine their own destiny]{.underline}. (Byers and Chesterman
2000: 291) Against this, [liberalism identifies violence as the
by-product of the continued presence of 'otherness' in the international
system]{.underline}. Consequently, [instead of limitation, its goal is
elimination.]{.underline} Or more precisely, perhaps, [violence is to be
'channelled' so as to abolish itself, by reserving the legitimate right
to exercise it to liberal democracies. Violence becomes justified and
legitimate when it is used by these states to eradicate its own
sources,]{.underline} that is, [the presence of
'otherness']{.underline}. At best, [non-democratic regimes]{.underline}
can hope for toleration -- itself a form of onto- logical violence
(Connolly 1994: 43) -- by democratic states. Ultimately, however, their
presence, which [keep]{.underline}s [history from fulfilling
itself,]{.underline} [need]{.underline}s [to be terminated.]{.underline}
Accordingly, [war takes on a different notion]{.underline}. For
realists, [it is the extension of the political, an expression of a
systemic condition in which irreconcilable differences might have to be
settled by force.]{.underline} In the absence of an authority to decide
the justness of such causes, [war is purely instrumental in settling the
score. For liberals, war becomes discriminatory, as it is legitimate
when exercised by the 'right' agents for the sake of democracy and
peace. War on the other hand deteriorates into pure aggression and
criminality when conducted by the 'other']{.underline}. Given that the
'other' is the source of residual conflict and violence in the
international system, [war is ultimately about the eradication of
'other-ness', not about the settling of scores between different
entities]{.underline}. As long as this is not accomplished, war is but
suspended. [The distinction between war and peace therefore becomes
blurred, as the presence of the 'other' constitutes a permanent threat.
Peace and peaceful means of diplomacy and statecraft become the
extension of war, as the imminent end of history and the coming of a
'world of liberal states' can afford no lasting peace and recognition of
the 'other']{.underline}. If the realists have it right, [we can expect
the world to continue to offer resis-tance to this liberal eschatology.
The problem with this is that it will most likely simply make liberalism
double its efforts and raise the level of violence further. As long as
war is exercised for the sake of the ascetic ideal of its own abolition,
it will continue to eliminate its limits]{.underline}.

#### Universalist ethics strive to abolish social antagonism by creating a neutral concept of humanity---this move abolishes differences and enables annihilation of difference

**Odysseos 8** -- University of Sussex Department of International
Relations \[Dr. Louiza, Against Ethics? Iconographies of Enmity and Acts
of Obligation in Carl Schmitt's Theory of the Partisan, Practices of
Ethics: Relating/Responding to Difference in International Politics
Annual Convention, International Studies Association, March 22\]

In The Concept of the Political Schmitt had already indicted the
increased usage of the terminology of 'humanity' by both theorists and
institutional actors such as the League of Nations (1996a). His initial
critique allows us to illuminate four distinct criticisms against
contemporary world politics' ethical recourse to the discourse of
humanity (cf. Odysseos 2007b). The first objection arises from the
location of this discourse in the liberal universe of values. By using
the discourse of humanity, [the project of a universal ethics
reverberates with the nineteenth century 'ringing proclamations of
disinterested liberal principle']{.underline} (Gowan 2003: 53) through
which '[liberalism]{.underline} quite successfully [conceals
its]{.underline} politics, which is the politics of [getting rid of
politics]{.underline}' (Dyzenhaus 1998: 14). For Schmitt, [the
focus]{.underline} of liberal modernity [on moral questions aims to
ignore or surpass questions of conflict altogether: it is therefore 'the
battle against the political]{.underline} - as Schmitt defines the
political', [in terms of the permanency of social antagonism in
politics]{.underline} (Sax 2002: 501). The second criticism argues that
'[humanity is not a political concept, and no political entity
corresponds to it.]{.underline} The eighteenth century humanitarian
concept of humanity was a polemical denial of the then existing
aristocratic feudal system and the privileges accompanying it' (Schmitt
1996a: 55). Outside of this historical location, where does it find
concrete expression but in the politics of a politically neutral
'international community' which acts, we are assured, in the interest of
humanity? (cf. Blair 1999). The 'international community is coextensive
with humanity...\[[it\]possesses the i]{.underline}n[herent right to
impose its will]{.underline}...[and to punish its violation, not because
of a treaty]{.underline}, or a pact or a covenant, [but because
of]{.underline} an international [need']{.underline}, a need
[which]{.underline} it can [only determine as the 'secularized "church"
of "common humanity]{.underline}"' (Rasch 2003: 137, citing James Brown
Scott).2 A third objection, still, has to do with the imposition of
particular kind of monism: [despite the lip-service to
plurality]{.underline}, taken from the market (Kalyvas 1999), '[liberal
pluralism is in fact not in the least pluralist but reveals itself to be
an overriding]{.underline} monism, the [monism of humanity]{.underline}'
(Rasch 2003: 136). Similarly, current [universalist perspectives, while
praising 'customary' or cultural differences, think of them
'but]{.underline} asethical or [aesthetic material for a unified
polychromatic culture]{.underline} -- a new singularity born of a
blending and merging of multiple local constituents' (Brennan 2003:
41).One oft-discussed disciplining effect is that, politically, [the
ethics of a universal humanity shows little tolerance for what is
regarded as 'intolerant' politics,]{.underline} [which is any politics
that moves in opposition to its ideals, rendering political opposition
to it illegitimate]{.underline} (Rasch 2003: 136). This is compounded by
the fact that [liberal ethical discourses are]{.underline} also [defined
by a claim to their own exception and superiority]{.underline}. [They
naturalise the historical origins of liberal societies, which are no
longer regarded as 'contingently established and historically
conditioned forms of organization']{.underline}; rather, [they 'become
the universal standard against which other societies are judged. Those
found wanting are banished, as outlaws, from the civilized
world.]{.underline} Ironically, [one of the signs of their outlaw status
is their insistence on]{.underline} autonomy, on
[sovereignty']{.underline} (ibid.:141; cf. Donnelly 1998). Most
importantly, and related to this concern, there is [the relation of the
concept of humanity to 'the other', and to war and
violence]{.underline}. In its historical location, the humanity concept
had critical purchase against aristocratic prerogatives; yet [its
utilisation by liberal ethical discourses within a philosophy of an
'absolute humanity']{.underline}, Schmitt feared, [could bring about new
and unimaginable modes of exclusion]{.underline} (1996a,2003,
2004/2007): [By virtue of its universality]{.underline} and abstract
normativity, [it has]{.underline} no localizable polis, [no clear
distinction between what is inside and what is outside]{.underline}.
Does humanity embrace all humans? Are there no gates to the city and
thus no barbarians outside? If not, against whom or what does it wage
its wars? (Rasch2003: 135). '[Humanity as such']{.underline}, Schmitt
noted, '[cannot wage war because it has no enemy']{.underline},(1996a:
54), indicating that [humanity 'is a polemical word that negates its
opposite']{.underline} (Kennedy 1998: 94; emphasis added). In The
Concept of the Political Schmitt argued that [humanity 'excludes the
concept of the enemy, because the enemy does not cease to be a human
being']{.underline} (1996a: 54). However, in his 1950 book with an
international focus, The Nomos of the Earth, Schmitt noted how [only
when 'man appeared to be the embodiment of absolute humanity, did the
other side of this concept appear in the form of a new enemy: the
inhuman']{.underline} (2003a: 104). It becomes apparent that,
historically examined, [the concept of humanity engenders a return to a
'discriminatory concept of war']{.underline}, by which Schmitt meant
that [it reintroduces the legitimacy and need for substantive causes of
justice in war]{.underline} (Schmitt 2003b: 37-52). [This]{.underline}
in turn [disallows the notion of]{.underline} justus hostis, of [a 'just
enemy']{.underline} -- explored in section three -- associated with the
notion of non-discriminatory interstate war which took the shape of
guerreen for me (Schmitt 2003a: 142-144). The concept of humanity,
therefore, shatters the formal concept of justus hostis, allowing [the
enemy]{.underline} to [now]{.underline} be [designated substantively as
an enemy of humanity as such. This leaves the enemy of humanity with no
value and open to dehumanisation and political and physical
annihilation]{.underline} (Schmitt 2004: 67). In discussing the League
of Nations, Schmitt highlights that, compared to the kinds of wars that
can be waged on behalf of humanity, the interstate European wars from
1815 to 1914 in reality were regulated; [they were bracketed by the
neutral Great Powers and were completely legal procedures in comparison
with the modern and gratuitous police actions against violators of
peace, which can be dreadful acts of annihilation]{.underline}
(Schmitt2003a: 186). [Enemies of humanity cannot be considered 'just and
equal']{.underline}. Moreover, [they cannot claim
neutrality]{.underline}: one cannot remain neutral in the call to be for
or [against humanity or its freedom]{.underline}; one cannot, similarly,
claim a right to resist or defend oneself, in the sense we understand
this right to have existed in the international law of Europe (the jus
publicum Europeaum). [Such a denial of self-defence and resistance 'can
presage a dreadful nihilistic destruction of all law']{.underline}
(ibid.: 187). When the enemy is not accorded a procedural justice and
formal equality, [the notion that peace can be made with him is
unacceptable]{.underline}, as Schmitt detailed through his study of the
League of Nations, which had declared [the abolition of
war,]{.underline} but in rescinding the concept of neutrality [only
succeeded in the 'dissolution of "peace]{.underline}"' (ibid.: 246). [It
is with the dissolution of peace that total wars of annihilation become
possible, where 'the other' cannot be assimilated, or accommodated, let
alone tolerated: the friend/enemy distinction is]{.underline} not longer
taking place with a justus hostis but [rather between good and evil,
human and in human]{.underline}, where 'the negative pole of the
distinction is to be fully and finally consumed without remainder'
(Rasch 2003: 137). Finally, [the ethical discourse of a universal
humanity can be discerned in the tendency to normalise diverse peoples
through legalisation and individualisation. The]{.underline} paramount
[emphasis placed on legal instruments and entitlements]{.underline} such
as human rights [transforms diverse subjectivities into
'rights-holders'. '\[T\]he other is stripped of his otherness and made
to conform to the universal ideal of what it means to be
human']{.underline}, meaning that '[the term "human" is not descriptive,
but evaluative. To be truly human]{.underline}, one needs to be
corrected' (Rasch 2003: 140 and 137; cf. Young 2002;Hopgood 2000). What
does this correction in its 'multiform tactics', which
[include]{.underline} Michel Foucault's proper terms of [discipline and
training]{.underline}, aim [to produce]{.underline}? The answer may well
be [the proper, free]{.underline} (masterful), [equal and
rational]{.underline} (in its self-interest)[subject of rights, of
capitalism and the governmentalised state]{.underline} (Foucault 2001a).
As Gil Anidjar notes, [the operation]{.underline} of the traditional
binary ['sovereign/enemy' is transformed]{.underline} 'in the
disciplinary society (which signals, according to Foucault, the
dissolution of sovereign power) [into "disciplinary
regime/criminality]{.underline}" (or, for that second term, legal
subject, subject of the law, and, of course, "man")' (Anidjar 2004:42;
emphasis added). Of equally great importance is transformation that
follows in the transition from a disciplinary to a governmental economy
of power: this is what we are at the moment confronting and must
analyse: what are the paths towards which the other as enemy is directed
by (a global) governmentality and, moreover, what forms, subjectivities,
etc., is the 'enemy' encouraged to take in the form of an unavoidable
freedom, along the lines articulated by Foucault under the heading of
'self government'(2007b).

Against this, **[liberalism identifies violence as the by-product of the
continued presence of 'otherness' in the international system.
Consequently, instead of limitation, its goal is
elimination]{.underline}**. **[Or more precisely, perhaps, violence is
to be 'channelled' so as to abolish itself, by reserving the legitimate
right to exercise it to liberal democracies. Violence becomes justified
and legitimate when it is used by these states to eradicate its own
sources, that is, the presence of 'otherness']{.underline}**. [At best,
non-democratic regimes can hope for toleration -- itself a form of
ontological violence (Connolly 1994: 43) -- by democratic
states.]{.underline} Ultimately, 120 L. S. Bishai and A. Behnke however,
their presence, which keeps history from fulfilling itself, needs to be
terminated. Accordingly, war takes on a different notion. For realists,
it is the extension of the political, **[an expression of a systemic
condition in which irreconcilable differences might have to be settled
by force. In the absence of an authority to decide the justness of such
causes, war is purely instrumental in settling the score]{.underline}**.
**[For liberals, war becomes discriminatory, as it is legitimate when
exercised by the 'right' agents for the sake of democracy and
peace.]{.underline}** War on the other hand deteriorates into pure
aggression and criminality when conducted by the 'other'. [Given that
the 'other' is the source of residual conflict and violence in the
international system, war is ultimately about the eradication of
'otherness', not about the settling of scores between different
entities. As long as this is not accomplished, war is but suspended.
**The distinction between war and peace therefore becomes blurred, as
the presence of the 'other' constitutes a permanent threat. Peace and
peaceful means of diplomacy and statecraft become the extension of
war,**]{.underline} as the imminent end of history and the coming of a
'world of liberal states' can afford no lasting peace and recognition of
the 'other'. If the realists have it right, [we can expect the world to
continue to offer resistance to this liberal eschatology.]{.underline}
The problem with this is that it will most likely simply make liberalism
double its efforts and raise the level of violence further. As long as
war is exercised for the sake of the ascetic ideal of its own abolition,
it will continue to eliminate its limits.

#### Democratic institutions justify international politics of a better ideological basis for peace as a means to otherize those not fitting of the same democratic frame

[Democratic Peace Theory (DPT) starts with the observation that liberal
democratic states do not go to war with each other]{.underline}. This,
its proponents proclaim, is as close as we have come to an empirical law
in international relations (Lynn-Jones 1996: ix). Much of the literature
and debate within DPT is about the proper explanation of this
phenomenon. Some scholars explain it by reference to cultural and
normative factors, **[arguing that 'decision-makers in democracies
follow norms of peaceful conflict resolution that reflect domestic
experiences and values' (]{.underline}**Lynn-Jones 1996: xviii). [Other
students of DPT focus on the structural and institutional
characteristics of democracies, arguing that mechanisms such as checks
and balances, separation of power, and the need for public debate
constrain the options to go to war. War, violence and the political 111
What unites these variations on the theme of DPT is the shared
commitment to treat 'democracy' as an epistemologically unproblematic
predicate of certain states]{.underline}. As Lynn-Jones explains, the
debate over DPT is in effect a debate with the realists over the
relevance of 'unit-level characteristics' for the explanation of states'
behaviour (Lynn-Jones 1996: x). What is routinely missing from this
explanation is a consideration of the conditions of possibility for
coding 'democracy' as a unit-level variable in the first place**[. What
appears to be a mere methodological problem in fact contains an
epistemological and philosophical intervention, the radical nature of
which DPT must hide in order not to undermine its own
logic.]{.underline}** Through this 'methodological' move, [the political
is ostracized and the ground prepared for its replacement with a
moralist discourse. Perhaps the best way to problematize this move in
terms of its political as well as philosophical implications is to
remember that 'democracy' is an 'essentially contested concept', a
concept, in other words, that defies a closure through fixed definition
(Gallie 1955/1956). These concepts defy any such fixation, as they are
an essential part of the political contestations that they on the
surface seem only to describe or analyse. The uses of the concept
'democracy' in political discourse are therefore always political
themselves, as they privilege one particular instantiation of it over
others, thus legitimizing one form over its alternatives. Thus, the
liberal definition of democracy cannot claim any universal
applicability. As Gallie points out, claims about this particular
definition reflect our grasp of a particular historical truth . . . as
to how democracy has taken root and flourished in the west. But if they
are put forward as universal political truths expressing the necessary
conditions of any genuinely democratic aspirations or achievements, then
they are surely open to question.]{.underline} (ibid.: 182, fn. 3) The
consequences of the identification of 'democracy' as an essentially
contested concept are also relevant for our assessment of DPT. First, it
is logically impossible to adjudicate between contending claims of what
democracy really is. More specifically, democracy becomes a purely
formal concept, exactly because its contested nature defies any
substantive definition. Second, the assumption of a 'scientific
perspective' also offers only another reordered structure of complexity.
To the extent that the investigator stakes out a position on these
conceptual contests and we know about it, he can be said to participate
in our politics itself. For these contests over the correct use of
partly shared appraisal concepts are themselves an intrinsic part of
politics. (Connolly 1993: 39) DPT, in other words, deconstructs itself.
Its self-understanding as a scientifically detached and objectified
stance outside the political processes, through which 112 L. S. Bishai
and A. Behnke the meaning of 'democracy' is established, becomes itself
as political a move as the distinction between democracy and its others.
Within states, a temporal adjudication of the contest on the meaning of
democracy is possible, and even necessary. Here, constitutions usually
decide about the structure of democracy and the reading of new
developments as democratic or undemocratic. **[Yet in the realm of
international politics there is no such institutionalized position from
which to adjudicate conceptual contests.6 Within the international
system, no 'voice' is present to declare one form of political
organization more democratic than the other. If there is any
'democratic-ness' in the international system, it resides exactly within
the contestability and the actual contest of different political and
social designs]{.underline}**. The task DPT faces is therefore a
formidable one. It has to extract 'democracy' from the very contest that
defines its possibility in the international system and fashion a purely
descriptive and analytical concept out of an essentially contested one.
DPT can only work with a fixed and stabilized meaning of democracy that
does not show much regard for the historically and culturally contingent
articulations of this term within political discourse. Based on this
methodological reification of democracy, the term becomes available for
differentiation between types of states. **[More specifically, different
types of states can now be hierarchically ordered according to their
democraticness or lack thereof. Democracy becomes an objectified set of
values and norms that sets states apart not only in terms of being
different, but also in terms of being better]{.underline}**

### Guardian Liberalism

#### We have entered the era of the guardian state -- the era of bunker archeology whereby the ascetic priests of liberal hegemony function to entrap the world within a moral fantasy of nihilistic perfection contingent on the valorized extermination of the other. 

**Kroker 14.** Arthur, Canada Research Chair in Technology, Culture and
Theory, Department of Political Science, University of Victoria. "Exits
to the Posthuman Future," London and New York: Polity Press, 2014.

The future of the guardian state What, then, does [the guardian
state]{.underline} portend for the future? Simultaneously [politically
liberal yet economically illiberal, deeply technocratic yet
faith-based]{.underline}, complex in its strategic analysis yet
absolutist in its moral convictions, [inspiring both hope and
fear]{.underline}, **[the guardian state is the advanced outrider of the
fully realized technological society]{.underline}**. While its earliest
[formulations reveal the emergent codes of the future,]{.underline}
whether the [new codes of cyber-warfare]{.underline} or the algorithmic
codes of [the digital]{.underline} [commodity-form]{.underline}, [the
essence of the guardian state has to do with heightened security
consciousness.]{.underline} While [this intimates]{.underline} the
movement of the guardian state in the direction of **[bunker archaeology
with]{.underline}** increasingly **[policed distinctions
between]{.underline}** those to be **[included or
excluded]{.underline}**, it also intimates **[greater
surveillance]{.underline}** of the domestic population. Always
[phantasmagorical in its formulation, based]{.underline} as much [on
projected]{.underline} [mass anxieties]{.underline} as fact-based
threats, the new security state will probably stabilize itself in the
future by a twofold strategy. **[Externally, it will identify
recognizable, and popularly acceptable, scapegoats upon whom spectacles
of vengeance can be enacted to allay the fears of the domestic
population]{.underline}**. In this respect, **[drone warfare is a
particularly powerful expression of the guardian state since its purely
cybernetic, remote, unmanned method of operation allows for the direct
discharge of political affect upon specifically targeted
scapegoats.]{.underline}** That there will always be **[numerous
accidental victims of death by drones will]{.underline}**, for the most
part, **[be effectively erased under the neutralizing military
nomenclature of "collateral damage."]{.underline}** Internally, the
rapid growth of the new security state as the political architecture of
guardian liberalism coincides with a deep crisis in contemporary liberal
subjectivity. Its livelihood threatened by economic changes beyond its
control, its imagination filled with haunting images of an always
menacing external world, its desires for security only partially
appeased by visible borders, liberal subjectivity turns inward only to
find that the boundaries of skin, consciousness, and perception have
themselves long ago been invaded by the full force of digital
technologies. Not only is it the case that electronic media generate
reality, but those very same media have fully invaded bodily
consciousness, increasingly taking possession of its habits of
perception, providing a specular theater of images for its imagination,
increasingly powering up life itself with the creativity of social
media, artificial intelligence, and augmented technologies. [Confronted
with the phantasmic irrealism of the putatively real world, the liberal
subject finds itself fatally overexposed, with no public cover from the
data storm outside and certainly no psychological shelter from the
radical uncertainty of the storm within. While, in the best of
circumstances, liberal subjectivity will rise to meet the challenges of
the posthuman future by making a successful transition to
"trans-subjectivity," that is, by becoming fluid, complex, and
intermediated, the more likely consequence is that liberal subjectivity,
threatened with boundary collapse from crises both external and
internal, will be drawn to the psycho-ontological condition long ago
prophesied by Nietzsche's On the Genealogy of Morals. **In this
case,**]{.underline} **[the future of the guardian state would witness
an increasingly bitter politics of mass ressentiment, fueled by the
visceral anger of those suffering injured sensibilities and irreal
sleights, whether by real or imagined enemies.]{.underline}** Curiously,
by **[providing cybernetically targeted scapegoats external to the
domestic politics of the United States,]{.underline}** the lasting
psychological contribution of Obama's vision of the guardian state,
whether consciously articulated or not, may be to alleviate the stress
on the besieged liberal subject with appeals for heightened security
abroad and economic security at home. In this case, **[Obama
is]{.underline}** very much **[the]{.underline}** representative
expression of Nietzsche's **["ascetic priest," whose]{.underline}**
primary **[function]{.underline}** **[remains]{.underline}**, now as
ever, **[to]{.underline}** redirect, rechannel, and
**[reinscribe]{.underline}** the direction of **[mass]{.underline}**
**[ressentiment.]{.underline}** With a future that is decidedly mixed,
guardian liberalism opens onto a full-fledged data storm generating new
avenues for genuine human creativity, whether in social communication,
innovative engineering, digital broadcasting, or recombinant genetics.
Here, the sheer technological force of drift culture destabilizes the
borders, crashes the boundaries, and remixes the referents with such
astonishing velocity and unpredictable consequences that the future of
social reality itself appears, at first glance, to be fully open to
redesign, reanimation, and reengineering. That said, the equally swift
emergence of the **[guardian state in response to very real crises of
political economy and international insecurity introduces a powerful
counter-drift into the political equation, effectively placing society
as a whole under the hegemonic signs of security consciousness and the
sovereignty of the digital commodity-form]{.underline}**. Definitely a
counterreaction to the complexities, fractures, and bifurcations of
drift culture, the guardian state moves to restabilize traditional
concentrations of power and finance around new prescriptions for social
and political intelligibility. [Here, absolutist political beliefs in
the existence of evil in the world are supplemented by harsh capitalist
prescriptions in support of policies of economic austerity, policing of
labor dissent, control of popular rebellions demanding democratic
renewal, and the effective disappearance of bodies that don't
count.]{.underline} **[Increasingly segregated, bodies of the future
will sometimes be excluded by the moral grid of the new security state
while others will literally be pushed off the grid by financial
exigencies]{.underline}**. A likely future, then, of economic and
political consolidation for the privileged, and growing uncertainty for
the remainder. In a future that is itself caught up in the violent drift
of consolidation and uncertainty, what sign will guide us through the
digital vortex with its increasing stress on an always fragile humanity?
In the end, will we come to represent the critical outside of digital
reality, turning uncertainty to creative advantage? And what of those
off-grid bodies of the future? Will they remain the spent casualties of
the violent force field of technological change? Or is it possible that,
in a contemporary situation in which technology increasingly takes the
form of a dark tetrad with its implacable laws of substitution,
disappearance, and inertia, the material visibility of human fragility
will awaken a spirit of rebellion? And even if the rebellion of politics
in the streets persists, how will it cope in the end with the emergence
of **[cynical power]{.underline}**, at **[once nihilistic and
transformative, that refuses to present itself as a predator and begins
to speak in terms of the precarious language of the
victim,]{.underline}** particularly a victim **[animated
by]{.underline}** the spirit of **[revenge]{.underline}**-taking on
bodies off-grid? With **[power masking itself as a sacrificial victim,
is it possible to speak of guardian liberalism in terms other than
"fully completed nihilism?"]{.underline}**

### Justice (universalism)

#### Their quest for good is vain universalism---our alt is better because it assumes the inevitable differences and undecidability of terms like justice 

**Zarmanian, 6** -- University of Milan (Thalin, "Carl Schmitt and the
Problem of Legal Order: From Domestic to International", Leiden Journal
of International Law, 19 (2006), pp. 44-49)

This theoretical urgency was inspired by the growing Politisierung of
German soci- ety brought about by Marxist, socialist, anarchist,
pluralist, and rightist movements which, at the end of the nineteenth
century, not only threatened the constitutional order of the German
Reich, but questioned the very legitimacy of the state as such. Schmitt
believed that it was the task of legal scientists, and especially
constitutional- ists, to address these attacks and to investigate
whether and how the state and its laws can produce order and provide
constitutional and political stability.11 In his view, the legal
scientists of his time had neglected this task. By equating the law with
the will of the bearer of the 'supreme power' (ho ̈ chste Macht),
identified with the state as a legal person, positivist Labandian12
Staatslehre had deprived both legal science and the state of their scope
and meaning. In one of his first writings13 Schmitt pointed out that if
the power of the murderer against his victim is the same as the power of
the state against the murderer,14 then there is no need for legal
science to investigate the lawfulness of the uses of power or to provide
a distinction between legal and illegal facts. Any legal question would
ultimately be solved through observation of mere facts instead of by
argumentation. The state would make no sense and have no value, since
the bearer of the supreme power would not need to formalize it into a
coherent and public system of law. Instead, the bearer could simply act
through force and imposition. Schmitt believed the theory which
identified law with the will of the state as the bearer of supreme power
to be flawed and inconsistent. The theory forgets that, [without law,
the very existence of a power beyond the individual is
impossible]{.underline}. In a state of nature [the only power is that
which each individual wields over others]{.underline}. No one can impose
his will indefinitely. One is limited to a certain number of other
individuals, for a limited time, and one is always subject to opposition
from others. [Stable and general power]{.underline} (i.e., political
power) [exists only]{.underline} out of the state of nature, [when a
plurality of individuals co-operates to use]{.underline} (or not to use)
[their force according to a common principle]{.underline}. This is
possible to the extent that individuals agree on the legitimacy of the
use of such power -- that is, on its being right.15 It follows, then,
that outside the state of nature the fact of [power is dependent on a
value : it is not law which comes from power, but power which comes from
the law]{.underline}. If every individual shared the same notion of
rightness and legitimacy, there would be only one supreme power. There
would be no need for legal science or the state, because there would be
no disagreements about the essence of the law and therefore no need for
its enforcement. Schmitt explained the existence of legal science and
the state by the fact that, [even though the idea of law]{.underline}
(die Rechtsidee) on which the existence of any political power depends
[is]{.underline} necessarily one and [universal, empirical reality
reveals a plurality of conflicting political powers. The main task of
legal science]{.underline}, therefore, [is to analyse this obscure nexus
between the idea of law and a plural empirical reality]{.underline} and
to assess the sense of the state, which is intermediate between the idea
and an orderless political reality. This task was partly undertaken by
the organicist and the liberal theories de- veloped in the pre-war
period and in the Weimar years. These theories had tried to overcome the
problem of conflict among the various powers claiming legitimacy.
Organicist legal thought16 was fostered by the German rightist and
conservative movements (to which Schmitt is sometimes said to belong17),
which believed that the German people (Volk) formed a unique organism,
in the same way that organs form a single body. This was the result of
natural laws (race or 'natural' geography) or, in its historicist and
romanticist version, the laws of historical development, which also
determine the will of the nation, as expressed by the state. According
to such a historicist view, the laws of the state were legitimate, not
because of the power of the state, but because the state is driven by
the laws of necessity. [Liberal theories]{.underline}, which were
developed in Germany by the so-called Marburg school,18 [tried to derive
an idea of justice from the Kantian concept of liberty and]{.underline}
the categorical imperatives of practical [reason, which are universal
and common to all humanity. From such premises]{.underline}, the members
of the school tried to develop a system of 'just laws' which would bind
all humanity. According to [this perspective]{.underline}, the laws of
the state were legitimate only to the extent that they reproduced such
laws. According to Schmitt, both approaches -- as different as they were
in their objectives, methods, and contents -- failed to account for the
legitimacy of the state and its law. Their flaw was that they [tried to
find a univocal formulation of the idea of law, aiming at]{.underline}
the [perfect order]{.underline} outlined above. Schmitt remarked that
[this does not happen in empirical reality, which reveals no shared
notion of justice]{.underline} or lawfulness. What is more, Schmitt
demonstrated that, [even if it were possible to develop a common notion
of justice]{.underline} or law, [there would still be room for
conflict]{.underline} and disorder. Drawing on his first book,19 Schmitt
insisted that in order to receive concrete application, any principle
needs to take the form of a norm[. The principle]{.underline} of
justice, ['respect thy neighbour', cannot be applied unless one first
defines what it means to respect, who should do so, who one's neighbour
is, and]{.underline}, most importantly, [who shall decide these
questions]{.underline} (quis iudicabit?). [Even once the terms of the
norm are defined, another predicament arises in regard to specific
cases]{.underline}. In order [to affect a plurality of individuals,
norms need to be general, but their enforcement requires a connection of
the specific case]{.underline} to these general norms, so that every
judicial ruling has to determine whether one particular person was bound
by that particular norm, whether the particular act they committed falls
within the provision of that norm, and so on.20 In both cases, the
relationship between the abstraction and the concrete case shows a
'momentum of indifference', that is, a lack of co-implication between
the abstraction and the concrete case ('zwischen jedem Konkretum und
jedem Abstractum liegt eine unu ̈ berwindliche Kluft'21). This gap
cannot be bridged by a principle of nature or rationale of necessity.
[The chasm]{.underline} definitely [precludes]{.underline}, therefore,
[the possibility of a perfect order and entails a space of indeterminacy
which creates room for indefinite plurality]{.underline}. The same
conclusions about the impossibility of adjudicating legitimacy were
shared by Schmitt's great antagonist, Hans Kelsen (1881--1973). Kelsen
also believed that legal science should forego the attempt to formulate
a definition of legitimacy and sovereignty. His whole work is devoted to
the attempt to 'purify' legal science from all the 'subjectivist' and
'sociological' elements which nineteenth-century legal science utilized
in order to justify the existence and the value of the state and to
build a theoretical system which would subject laws to irrational
disputes with their value and meaning. In Kelsen's view, jurists should
not be concerned about the value of laws (and thus with their
legitimacy), but only with their validity. This is a purely logical
predicate which derives from their being referable to higher-ranking
norms according to the so-called Stufenbau (construction by grades) up
to a single basic norm (Grundnorm), which is a 'transcendental
presupposition', a universal principle coaxing order. Therefore, to the
extent that these norms are produced according to a legal process
defined by higher-ranking norms, they should be regarded as valid,
applied to concrete cases, and enforced -- whatever their content and
effect is. [Schmitt]{.underline} denounced the theoretical failure of
Kelsen's attempt22 by [point]{.underline}ing [out the impossibility of
legal science ignoring the problem of legitimacy.]{.underline} Kelsen
himself, despite his claims of theoretical purity and neutrality, ended
up making the same a-priori assumptions he tried to do away with. His
system is, in fact, based on [the assumption that]{.underline} the
Grundnorm and all the [norms]{.underline} deriving from it [are
immediately intelligible in the same manner to all
humanity]{.underline}. In Kelsen's version of parliament- arism, this
[turns into the assumption that every element of society is willing to
accept the majority's will]{.underline}, whatever its content, [which is
equal to assuming a perfect order as an ontological given.]{.underline}
In addition to this, [such an ontologically given order
entails]{.underline} for Kelsen [a universal normative
value]{.underline}. As has recently been argued, [such order consists of
'peace']{.underline}, which has a 'normative priority over the
realization of particular substantive ethical aims'.23 According to
Schmitt, [this]{.underline} apparently neutral proposition [hides a bias
towards the status quo]{.underline} and the bourgeois state. In Kelsen's
view, the concept of peace (i.e., order) is the 'absence of unauthorized
use of force'. Schmitt objects,24 saying that this conception does not
take into account the possibility that the 'authorized use of force' --
that is, the use of the state's power (die Macht) -- which derives from
a simple numerical majority, can ever be harmful25 and that therefore
opponents of the status quo can ever have the right to resistance.
Schmitt, therefore, criticized Kelsen's theory, not only because it
incurs the same theoretical fallacies of organicist and rationalist
theories, but also because by presuming order as given, it bypasses the
problem of plurality. Schmitt noted that the political or social forces
which began in the late nineteenth century to object to the very
fundamental structures of the bourgeois system -- often making use of
'un- authorized use of force' against the state -- called upon the same
idea of law on which such legal power is assumed to be founded and, as
happened during the Weimar Republic, 'So wirft im kritischen Moment
jeder dem anderen Illegalita ̈ t vor, jeder spieltdenHu ̈terderLegalita
̈tundderVerfassung.DasErgebnisisteinlegalita ̈ts- und verfassungsloser
Zustand'.26 According to Schmitt, such a clash between two or more
contrasting concepts of legitimacy either creates a state of violence
and disorder, in which the enforcement and exercise of any right becomes
impossible, or, if a majority is strong enough to annihilate the
minority, it makes use of the state power (Macht) to impose its own law.
In the former case, law exists only in the jurists' minds and books,
while in the latter it appears as a mere theoretical disguise of power.
Schmitt regarded both these results as unacceptable. According to him,
legal science cannot simply disregard this call to law and in order to
preserve its 'pureness' leave to 'sociology' the
answers:'Wennsie\[formalistjurists\]mitderBregru ̈ndung, daß die
Jurisprudenz etwas Formales sei, nicht zur Sache kommen, so bleiben sie
trotz allen Aufwandes in der Antichambre der Jurisprudenz'.27 [Schmitt's
theoretical move was]{.underline}, therefore, [to accept the challenge
and to assume plurality, conflict, and chaos as ontologically given and
to take charge o]{.underline}f what Galli28 calls [the 'tragedy of
modernity]{.underline}'29 -- the fact [that]{.underline} on the one
hand, after the collapse of medieval Christian unity, [an ultimate and
uncontested foundation for legitimacy is no longer possible and
that]{.underline}, on the other hand, [such legitimacy is unavoidable
for any order]{.underline}. What makes Schmitt's thought unique and so
interesting, then, is that it is entirely set within the modern tragedy
but it looks at it from without.30 Unlike postmodernists, he never gave
up seeking an Archimedean point -- the legal order -- in which the
tension between the idea of law (die Rechtsidee) and empirical reality
could converge. In order to do this, however, he had to renounce the
legacy of modern juridical and political thought. [He is]{.underline}
therefore [no realist]{.underline}, as Koskenniemi31 recently suggested
by likening him to (the second) Morgenthau. [Far from thinking that 'law
is a mere ratification of a concrete order']{.underline}, he always
argued that [no order can exist if it is not shaped by law in the first
place.]{.underline} He is no idealist, either, because he confronted
every a-priori definition of justice or law. He is no formalist because,
unlike Kelsen, he refused to recoil from empirical reality and to seek
comfort in transcendental pureness. He is no anti-formalist either,
because far from regarding 'the question of valid law' as
'uninteresting',32 he considered it central: as has been mentioned
above, formalization is to him the means through which the idea of law
can be transposed into empirical reality. Schmitt's quest for the
possibility of a legal order started, therefore, from none of those
'fixed points' -- power, idea, form, and norm -- from which modern
political thought had moved to construct legal science. [Having pointed
out the unbridgeable chasm]{.underline} which separates them, [he chose
to start his quest for]{.underline} the possibility [of a legal order
from there]{.underline} -- that is, [from disorder]{.underline}.

### Humanity / Freedom / Justice

#### the politics of liberalism inherently homogenizes all sovereign association otherizing those not fitting the frame as disposable - The alternative is an embracing of the distinction between the friend and enemy

International Politics. International Politics, 44(5), 531--551.

To the extent that Wilson endorsed the notion of human rights[, he
embraced the idea of an abstract humanity. To the extent that he argued
for a 'league of nations' whose members would be states 'great or
small', Wilson accepted, rhetorically, the reality of a pluriverse
o]{.underline}f **[sovereign and hence, in legal terms, equal states and
thus the reality of a politically differentiated
humanity.]{.underline}** To the extent that Wilson adhered to the idea
that **[the only justification for war is its service to 'mankind' or
'humanity', to 'democracy and human rights', to 'freedom and justice and
self-government', Wilson, in effect, upheld the notion that a
distinction must be made between 'just' and 'unjust' wars]{.underline}**
(in Scott, 1918, 40, 50, 288, 316). In such 'just wars'**[, remaining
neutral was not an option.]{.underline}** While, after a century of
bloody wars, one may feel --- almost intuitively --- inclined to applaud
these principles and the sentiments they express, this enthusiasm may be
somewhat dampened once one realizes that Wilson spoke about this service
to mankind and humanity also in connection with the deployment of
American troops in Mexico during the civil war situation in 1914. Carl
Schmitt's reflections on international politics tookshape in his
confrontation with Wilsonian ideology and the reality of Germany's
defeat in the First World War. These writings on international politics
entwined polemical political commentary published in newspapers with
scholarly historical analysis, concept formation and theory building. In
the following presentation of Schmitt's thinking on international
politics, his scholarly endeavours will be stressed. But the reader
should be aware that Schmitt understood these scholarly writings as
contributions to political debate and mobilization. This becomes
immediately clear [when we reconstruct Schmitt's discontent with the
notion of 'humanity' and 'universalism', as it was, for example,
deployed by Wilson, at the level of conceptual analysis. 'Humanity',
Schmitt asserted, 'is not a political concept' (]{.underline}Concept,
1932, 55). Let us reconstruct Schmitt's concept of 'the political' in
order to understand this statement. Roland Axtmann Carl Schmitt on
International Politics 534 International Politics 2007 44 In 1927,
Schmitt published an essay with the title 'The concept of the
political'. In 1932, he published a much revised version of that essay.
In response to political developments and criticisms of this essay ---
in particular, the criticism of Leo Strauss --- Schmitt put out a third
edition in 1933 --- an edition which, later on, he pretended did not
exist.3 '**[The specific political distinction to which political
actions and motives can be reduced is that between friend and
enemy']{.underline}** (Concept, 1932, 25--26). [This distinction
'denotes the utmost degree of intensity of a union or separation, of an
association or dissociation' (Concept, 1932, 25--26). The political can
derive its energy from the most varied human endeavours, from the
religious, economic, moral, ethical and other antitheses. Every
antithesis transforms itself into a political one 'if it is sufficiently
strong to group human beings effectively according to friend and
enemy']{.underline} (Concept, 1932, 37). **[The quality of the political
resides in the decision through which the 'other', the stranger or
alien, is declared to negate one's own existence and is thus defined as
being --- in a particularly intense way --- existentially
different]{.underline}**, and hence an enemy against whom battle must be
waged, which may --- rightly and justifiably --- lead to the enemy's
extermination. After all, the political receives its real meaning
precisely because it refers to the real possibility of physical killing.
In the West, so **[Schmitt asserts, the state had become the bearer of
the monopoly of political decision, the decision on who should be
considered friend, who enemy. 'The state as the decisive political
entity possesses an enormous power: the possibility of waging war and
thereby publicly disposing of the lives of men. The jus belli \[in the
sense of jus ad bellum, RA\] contains such a disposition. It implies a
double possibility: the right to demand from its own members the
readiness to die and unhesitatingly to kill enemies'
(Concept]{.underline}**, 1932, 46). War follows from enmity. It is 'the
existential negation of the enemy' (Concept, 1932, 33). We shall see
later how Schmitt defined the 'quality' of 'the enemy' in the context of
the bracketing of war in the ius publicum Europaeum as a hostis iustus
and why he felt that this understanding had been finally abandoned in
the early 20th century. For our current concern, which rehearses
Schmitt's argument about 'humanity' as a non-political concept, one
consequence of his conceptualization of 'the political' must be
stressed. Manifestly, for Schmitt[, a people which exists politically
cannot renounce the right to determine by itself and at its own riskwho
is friend and who enemy. It cannot hand over this decision to a third
party, nor may it allow itself to be bound in its decisions by ethical
considerations that may take the form of 'just war' arguments. For
Schmitt, war can only have an 'existential meaning': If physical
destruction of human life does not occur out of the existential
assertion of one's own form of existence against an equally existential
negation of this form, then it can simply not be justified]{.underline}.
No war can be Roland Axtmann Carl Schmitt on International Politics 535
International Politics 2007 44 justified by ethical and juristic norms.
If there really are enemies in the existential sense as meant here, then
it makes sense, but only political sense, to repel them physically and
fight them if necessary. (Concept, 1932, 49; altered translation of
German original \[Begriff\] on p. 50\]) According to Schmitt, the
notions that postulate a 'just war' usually serve a political purpose;
indeed, following Hobbes, Schmitt suggested that 'the conviction of each
side to possess the truth, the good, and the just bring about the worst
enmities' (Concept, 1932, 65). One must not forget, Schmitt urged, that
there 'always are concrete human groupings which fight other human
groupings in the name of justice, humanity, order, or peace. When being
reproached for immorality and cynicism, the spectator of political
phenomena can always recognize in such reproaches a political weapon
used in actual combat' (Concept, 1932, 67).4 '[**Humanity' is best
understood as a political weapon** --- so at least Schmitt argued. Of
the Wilsonian rhetoric of 'humanity', Schmitt was witheringly scathing:
When a state fights its political enemies in the name of humanity, it is
not a war for the sake of humanity, but a war wherein a particular state
seeks to usurp a universal concept against its military opponent. At the
expense of its opponent, it tries to identify itself with humanity in
the same way as one can misuse peace, justice, progress, and
civilization in order to claim these as one's own and deny the same to
the enemy.]{.underline} The concept of humanity is an especially useful
ideological instrument of imperialist expansion, and in its
ethical-humanitarian form it is a specific vehicle of economic
imperialism. Here one is reminded of a somewhat modified expression of
Proudhon's, whoever invokes humanity wants to cheat. To confiscate the
word humanity, to invoke and monopolize such a term probably has certain
incalculable effects, such as denying the enemy the quality of being
human and declaring him to be an outlaw of humanity, and a war can
thereby be driven to the most extreme inhumanity (Concept, 1932, 54).
'War' in the name of humanity does no longer know of an enemy, but only
of a 'disturber of the peace' and hence an outlaw of humanity. War is
not perceived as war, but as 'executions, sanction, punitive
expeditions, pacifications, protection of treaties, international
police, and measures to ensure peace remain' (Concept, 1932, 79).
'Humanity', for Schmitt, was thus seen as an 'asymmetrical concept'
since it contains the possibility of the 'deepest inequality': since
everyone belongs to humanity, any discrimination within humanity by
denying the quality of being human to a disturber or destroyer of peace
means turning the negatively valued person into an unperson whose life
is no longer the highest value but becomes worthless and must be
destroyed Roland Axtmann Carl Schmitt on International Politics 536
International Politics 2007 44 (Legal Revolution, 1987, 88). It is this
asymmetry that makes 'bestiality' the flip-side of 'humanity'. The
reason why 'humanity' is not a 'political' concept for Schmitt will now
be clear. Conceptually, 'the political' is defined by the distinction of
friend and enemy; **[the 'political' character of an association
presupposes the real existence of an enemy and hence, of necessity, the
coexistence of another political entity. The political world is thus a
pluriverse, not a universe: 'A world state which embraces the entire
globe and all of humanity cannot exist' (Concept, 1932, 53). The concept
of humanity, furthermore, excludes the concept of the enemy yet, the
'enemy' does not cease to be a human being. Without this specific
differentiation, 'humanity' cannot acquire 'political' qualities. After
all, 'humanity as such cannot wage war because it has no enemy'
(Concept, 1932, 54). The 'political' nature of Schmitt's definition of
'the political' is apparent: the 'other' is 'liberalism'. He charged
liberalism with evading or ignoring state and politics in a very
systematic fashion, endeavouring to tie the political to the ethical and
subjugating it to economics. For liberalism, to whom the individual must
remain terminus a quo and terminus ad quem, the demand by the political
entity that in case of need the individual must sacrifice his (or her)
life is unconscionable: the individual as such has no enemy with whom he
(or she) must enter into a life-and-death combat if he (or she) does not
want to do so. What we therefore find in liberal thought, Schmitt
asserted, is an entire system of demilitarized and depoliticalized
concepts]{.underline}**. For example, 'political' combat and battle
becomes competition in the domain of economics and discussion in the
intellectual realm. The liberal denial of 'the political' manifests
itself in the international realm in the ideological conception of
'humanity' (Concept, 1932, 70--72).5

### Human Rights

#### Human rights are premised off both the metaphysical Christian and western political man as the subject -- any other starting point is the barbaric other. What the 1AC understands as a global value system is really a tool of imperialism to justify interventions -- the human rights doctrine is founded on the blood of the savage

This coherence of the rationality of (b)ordering we see continued with
the [invention of "Man" (as "universal subject") and "Citizen" (as
"territorialized subject")]{.underline} of rights-obligations; this is
familiar [philosophical ground for Human Rights]{.underline}
origin-stories. But I am not concerned here to re-trace the
philosophical legacies of the so-called American and French
Revolutions---as the celebrated iconic Events of the Enlightenment---on
the idea of Human Rights. Important for my argument rather is how this
philosophical [move of Eurocentric colonial-modern onto-epistemology now
structures the norm-ality of international (b)ordering as a totalized
regulatory system for the global management of
bodies-in-territory]{.underline}. Again, we see here the central role of
the magical (Hu)Man in the operation of (b)ordering differentiated
being-ness. [Rather than some revolutionary universal imagination of an
emancipated-human, the philosophical invention of Man-Citizen produces a
reified abstraction as political-legal subject,]{.underline} importantly
now no longer as a being in a borderless geography under divinity but as
[territorialized under "sovereignty]{.underline}"; the "Enlightened"
Man-Citizen of rights originates and entrenches---to borrow from Zygmunt
Bauman---a "transfixed" imagination, which emplaces subject-beingness
within bordered state territories, as a secular revisioning of a good
order for a good society.41 [Thus emerges as a norm-ality into the World
the onto-epistemology of Citizen as a secular political-subject
constituted by Sovereign-Rights]{.underline} (in/as-territory), [and of
Man as a metaphysical-subject constituted by Human-Rights]{.underline}
(in/as-property). Through the invention of Man-Citizen, therefore, is
[transfigured the "believer-of--the-faith" from the old (b)order of
Christendom to the new of state-nationality, from the universality of
the "global-divine" to the particularity of the
"territorialized-secular," from the good Christian of the good God into
the good Citizen-subject of the good (Sovereign) State]{.underline},
again, we recall, not as an actual in the world but as a reification, a
malleable point of departure, a "zero point" of colonial-modern
philosophy, as ideal, as perfect.42 The abstraction serves a powerful
function. As a rationality of governance-subjectification, the
assignation of an abstract propertied-possessive and possessed "subject"
enabled the creation of a new order, built upon an assertion of rational
purity and perfection, an ideal of a new territorialized settlement of
names and emplacements of inclusion/exclusion. But ideals aside (and
whatever the motives of individual philosophers might have been, noble
or otherwise) more [specifically was constructed the original
territorialized political-legal template for a global regulation of
differentiated license, containment and abandonment. And this is
crucial: Man and Citizen were inventions not of an insular imagination,
but of an imperial one; they express the variegated conditions of
right/lessness in the emergent colonial-modern capitalist State
system]{.underline}.43 When recounting the ([European) story of the
modern "nationstate]{.underline}"---that state that is purportedly
[founded on the unshakeable "truths" of the Rights of Man, and the
"social contract"---we speak in actuality of a colonial-modern formation
within a totality of global coloniality;]{.underline} the exigencies of
(b)ordering in this sense pertain to both 1) the differentiated
subjectification internal to the colonial-modern territorialized state,
and 2) the institutional architecture of a system of global
differentiation. The two are co-constitutive and interdependent. It is
[important to]{.underline} stress this point to [correct the
conventional celebratory tellings of the revolutionary "European"-story
as a tale in itself devoid its murderous colonial
underside]{.underline}; contrary to the philosophical and geographical
purity of most tellings of the story of "European" thought, [much of
this "thinking" took place fully in the blood-soaked contexts of the
trans-Atlantic slave-trade and the globalized routes and networks of
imperial/colonial plunders]{.underline}. This is not new to our
understanding: as Walter Rodney long ago made clear, Europe did indeed
"underdevelop" Africa,44 and as Walter Mignolo repeatedly reminds us,
there would be no European "modernity" (and its narratives of salvation)
without global coloniality (and its materialities of negation,
subjugation and appropriation).45 [When understood as a global, as
opposed to an insular-European historical formation, therefore, we see
more clearly that the coeval actuality of Rights declared, and
subjugation enforced, corresponds to a rationalization of a global
structuring of difference]{.underline}. The assertion of
propertied-rights (of conquest, appropriation, possession) for some and
the "obligations" on the inscribed-Other as conquered "Humanity" to be
made-"subject," this is the utter materiality of what Charles W. Mills
brilliantly exposed as the "racial contract"; the "social contract" so
proudly [the philosophical birthright of the "citizen" being fully
written with the blood of the racialized inflictions of the
expropriation contract, the slavery contract and the colonial
contract]{.underline}. 46 With this understanding of the "norming of
space" as the "racing of space,"47 we might better describe the march of
"progress" that was [the affirmation of the Rights of Man and the
Citizen therefore as follows: the reified (Hu)Man of the Enlightenment
was right-ed---as "citizen-subject"---as a prize gained through the
operation of the coloniality of subjectification-as-negation which
ascribed as Non-Being (barbarian, savage, native, Black) the encountered
"Other" of Already-Being, the result of the operation of the "natural
rights" to name, enslave, subjugate, rape, lynch, murder, civilize,
educate, develop, all in the name of universal]{.underline}
(In)Humanity.48 Bluntly, Man/Citizen as abstract, universal, right-ed,
philosophical-beingness were philosophically birthed as actual embodied
men, women and children were the world over subjugated if not entirely
massacred. [Thus was the modern "nation-state" of territorialized
sovereignty-subjectivity constituted philosophically and
materially]{.underline}. And with it, were the normalities of
coloniality-modernity invented, rationalized, institutionalized to
enforce the "colonial difference,"49 the many worlds of Being violently
transformed into a "world-system," its "borders" drawn through
"banalized" violence---as Vivienne Jabri called it---to (b)order and
regulate differentiated (post)colonial bodies within strictly enforced
territorial cages.50 And we carry this "White Man's" legacy still as the
"Black Man's burden."51 3) The Globalization of "International Human
Rights Law" and the Completion of the (Post)Colonial World System. It is
often the territoriality of global order and governance that provokes
distress amongst Human Rights thinkers/actors as the promise of
universality is perceived to be undermined by the discrimination of
borders. And yet, as we have seen, the [foundational traditions of
dominant contemporary Human Rights theology were precisely rooted in the
territorial (b)ordering of differentiated "subjects," their rationalized
ascriptions of beingness the basis upon which gendered and racialized
brutalities were norm-alized and enforced, as right]{.underline}. But
this is not simply a telling of tales past, of the troubled (hi)story of
Human Rights in its journey to post-colonial redemption. Quite the
opposite, the materialization of the "post-colonial" right to
"self-determination"---as the obligation to enforce a (b)ordered
territorialized State---has proved fundamental to the norm-ing of global
space as (b) ordered differentiation. [The tragedy is that the
"post-colonial" world state system---in those many celebratory midnight
hours heralded as "liberation" from colonial, racist inhumanity---indeed
marked the coming into full fruition of the process of colonial
civil-ization]{.underline}.52 The [manufacture and coming into
"independence" of the territorialized "post/neo-colonial
state]{.underline}," with "privatized sovereignty"---to become, as
Achille Mbembe has termed the condition, a "postcolony"---[reinforces
and completes a global system designed to entrench the structural
inequalities of imperial design]{.underline}.53 The [philosophical
invention of the "Human" and of the idea of "universality," once
explicitly founded on racialized differentiation, now are rejuvenated,
their bloody pasts cleansed of their horrors and the material outcomes
of impoverishment and enrichment thereby engendered now normalized as
conditions of the "World"]{.underline} rather than active processes of
the World-made-such. In this, the "constitution" of the post-colony---in
the sense of its made-to be-ness---and of the "post-colonial"
demarcation of bodies-in-territory, serve to re-inscribe anew a fully
globalized, institutionally entrenched and enforced, differentiated
regulation of license, containment and abandonment. Understood as a
totality the conceptual register of Human/ Citizen's Rights is
co-constitutive of this organization of the territorialized (b)ordering
of differentiated subject-beingness. As we will see more fully later in
the discussion, the regime of emplaced and bordered
citizenship-with-rights serve crucially as a global neoliberal
technology of dividing and ruling populations.54 In doing this, the
constitutional function of the "international" system of territorialized
(b)ordering---as institutionalized by the [UN Charter system and its
attached Human Rights governance-frameworks]{.underline}---is to
[enforce the basic architecture of a totalizing regime for the
differentiated subjectification of the global population, regulated in
and through the discursive and material technologies of
state-territoriality]{.underline}.55 And so does contemporary
"[International Human Rights Law" operate to settle the post-colonial
present: it both enforces the prevailing order of rights as constructed,
rationalized and regulated in time and place, as well as prescribes the
presence/absence of those with(out) membership of belonging through the
negotiation and redistribution of names and places as
Being-subject]{.underline}. Though parochial and colonial in origins,
[the reason of Rights find useful translation therefore into the many
particularized and contingent adaptation of its operation in the
different times and places of Human-subjectification]{.underline}.56 The
"international" [politics of Human Rights "law" is, in this respect, a
politics of competing claims to define the borders of
license]{.underline}, and the jurisdiction of containment and bans,
outcomes of which, in terms of enforced rights and obligations in
real-time and place, are [determined by the jostling for power by
competing state-private imperialist forces]{.underline}.
"Superciliousness" is precisely the point of this politics;57 the
struggle for cross-cultural meanings and interpretations---for its
Asian, African, Chinese, Islamic value-implications, for reservations
and qualifications etc---can all be understood in this light as a
[contestation between competing imperial-capitals, for "rights" of
license and the "obligations" of protective containment]{.underline} and
rationalizations of abandonment. Thus we see that the underlying reason
of (b)ordering differentiation is not diluted by the various efforts to
"de-Europeanize," or to "decolonize" Human Rights, to bring about
civilizational plurality within its substantive meanings. Quite the
opposite, the addition and mixing of the spices and herbs of exotic
"post-colonial" realms into the melting-pot of Human Rights serves the
overarching cause well; the ascription of a pluriversal universality in
this regard serves as a philosophical technique of global naturalization
and norm-alization regardless of the "resistance" motivations of many a
post-colonial philosopher of Human Rights. [We are all Human
Rights-subjects now, subject to the naming and emplacing of
subject-beingness. As such may we be contained with rights and
obligations if we remain docile, obedient and worthy, but abandoned
(even banned) to abject rightlessness if we are deemed not
so.]{.underline}

### International law / democracy

#### Their project of creating an affective relationality with democratic hegemony and liberal homogenization is to paper over the harms acting in the name of citizens to exercise sovereignty -- results in violence, mass military intervene

[**The liberal project thus establishes an epistemic hegemony over its
'other'**. Self-determination and the notion that the people within a
society themselves evaluate the political performance of its leadership
are eliminated in favour of an apparently objectified yet clearly
liberal gaze]{.underline}. And in order to prevent the 'problem cases'
from exercising their potential for violence**[, liberal states are
empowered to exercise their potential for violence in 116]{.underline}**
L. S. Bishai and A. Behnke [the form of diplomatic pressure or
incentives, economic measures, or coercive action, often in combination.
It can also incorporate new strategies such as indicting individual
leaders . . . \[or\] support for non-violent resistance movements that
are dedicated to democratizing their governments.]{.underline} (ibid.:
145) The crucial point here is that for liberal international lawyers,
'the duty to prevent' can and should be exercised pre-emptively. The
fact that Saddam Hussein did not in fact possess weapons of mass
destruction did not remove him from the liberal project, as the 'nature
of his regime' defined his dangerousness, giving reason to 'prosecute
Saddam Hussein for crimes against humanity committed back in the 1980s'
(ibid.: 139). In other words, [the prosecution would be a matter of
expediency, with the goal not the pursuit of justice, but the
elimination of a particular regime]{.underline}. Again, the
functionalist and purely regulatory truncation of international law
shows its face. Finally, given the duty to prevent assigned to liberal
states, **[the UN Security Council is but one of various institutional
structures through which to conduct the intervention]{.underline}**. It
is an expedient choice, rather than the exclusive one, as it still has
'unmatched legitimacy'. However, given the urgency of the cause, less
legitimate alternatives for enforcement, that is regional organizations
or unilateral actions, are acceptable too once the UN Security Council
is 'paralyzed' (ibid.: 148). **[In this case, a unilateral intervention
might be 'illegal but legitimate'. Again putting purpose ahead of
process, the ends justify the means. As for Iraq, 'even without such
evidence \[of weapons of mass destruction\] the United States and its
allies can justify their intervention if the Iraqi people welcome their
coming and if they turn immediately back to the United Nations to
rebuild the country' (Slaughter 2003: A33).]{.underline}** [Leaving
aside whether a 'return back' to the institution that was shunned in the
decision-making process about the intervention in the first place can
really establish the post hoc legitimacy of the intervention, and how to
establish the response of the 'Iraqi people' in an unambiguous fashion,
what becomes clear in these formulations is that **liberal war is
ultimately an ontological war**]{.underline}, [a war against a different
form of being, rather than a war against a strategic enemy]{.underline}.
Its most consistent formulation defines the foe simply in terms of its
adherence to allegedly universal definitions of 'popular sovereignty'
and dispenses with any kind of consideration of the extent to which such
a country produces a manifest strategic threat. At stake now is whether
a state is based on 'popular sovereignty' rather than the
'anachronistic' rule of some home-grown specialist in violence who
seizes and purports to wield the authority of the government against the
wishes of the people, by naked power, by putsch or by coup, by the
usurpation of an election or by those systematic corruptions of the
electoral process in which almost 100 percent of the electorate
purportedly votes for the incumbent's list. (Reisman 2000: 243) War,
violence and the political 117 [What counts in modern international law
instead is 'the sovereignty of the people and not a metaphysical
abstraction called the State' (ibid.: 252). This argument, however, is
problematic in so far as it stipulates a possible distinction between
the state as 'a metaphysical abstraction' and the people as the real and
primary referent of sovereignty]{.underline} (ibid.: 252). Reisman
further muddies the water by offering the paradoxical observation that
**['international law still protects sovereignty, but . . . it is the
people's sovereignty rather than the sovereign's
sovereignty]{.underline}** \[sic!\]' (ibid.: 243). At a minimum, these
formulations further obscure the relationship between state, people and
sovereignty. First, it remains unclear to what extent a 'people' can
have a claim to political status in the absence of the institutional
structure of the state. Second, what exactly happens to the sovereign
when his sovereignty is no longer recognized? Reisman seems to suggest
that sovereignty is both essence (the sovereign) and attribute (his
'recognizable' sovereignty). Finally, the reality of the 'people'
themselves is dubious. Reisman begins to acknowledge this issue, if in a
marginal way, when he discusses the nitty-gritty of restoring democracy,
a process he admits can be 'messy, unpleasant, costly and susceptible to
abuse' (ibid.: 254). For example, we might find the 'absence of a
consensus on who should govern', have doubts about the 'integrity of the
elections', or see 'diverse groups vying for power'. So 'no one can be
sure that the unilateral intervener from the outside is implementing
popular wishes. To varying extents, the intervener will be shaping them'
(ibid.: 254; emphasis added). In other words, the people in question are
not necessarily sovereign at all, if sovereignty entails autonomous
decision on their own political order. **[However, the outside
intervention in fact reproduces the very logic that justified and led to
the intervention in the first place: the 'usurpation' or 'corruption' of
an election and the free will of the people. To invoke 'popular
sovereignty' as a legal ground for outside intervention thus
deconstructs itself, revealing itself as a political act or, in
Derrida's terms, a coup de force, creating what it purports to merely
represent (Derrida 1992).]{.underline}**

#### The aff's rhetoric of visualizing a reduction in political governmental power to reconcile imperialistic governmental forms of power is an imposition of mass violent militarized intervention and political theology in the name of humanitarianism

[A superficial reading of Schmitt, focusing on his subtitle, might take
the concept of the jus publicum Europaeum (hereafter JPE) to be
synonymous with the notion of international law]{.underline}
(Völkerrecht), but for Schmitt the two notions are completely different,
indeed opposed to one another. **[Schmitt objects to the notion of
international law fo]{.underline}**r two, interconnected, reasons.
First, international law lacks the spatial aspect which is central to
the JPE; [it purports to offer a universal account of international
order, blurring the crucial distinction between the European and the
non-European worlds]{.underline}. But second, and more important,
**[international law is, for Schmitt, a progressive, liberal project
which is subject to the same critique as he delivers against liberalism
in general]{.underline}**, [namely that it undermines the
political]{.underline} **[and acts as a cover for special
interests.]{.underline}** This point requires some elaboration.
Schmitt's account of politics is developed in opposition to liberalism.
For Schmitt[, liberalism purports to undermine the key feature of
politics, the distinction between friend and enemy (Schmitt 1985, 1996).
Liberalism, he argues, seeks to moralize and legalize politics,
**reducing the political process to a set of morally authoritative
rules, attempting**, as it were, to take the politics out of politics.
This is a doomed enterprise -- in any political constitution what is
crucial is the ability to decide upon the 'exception', the point at
which the rules no longer apply -- but it is also a pernicious
enterprise, because it involves covering particular political interests
with a cloak of morality, **pretending that a political decision
emerging out of the friend--enemy distinction is actually the product of
a moral judgement that cannot be opposed without falling into moral
turpitude**. It is easy to see how this position feeds into a reading of
progressivist international law;]{.underline} indeed, this position gels
with at least part of the classic realist critique of the latter -- on
which see, for example, E. H. Carr's critique of utopian moralizing as a
strategy employed by the 'haves' against the 'have-nots' (Carr 2001).
**[It is equally easy to see how Schmitt associates this notion of
international law with the United States]{.underline}** -- but it is
worth noting that for Schmitt, unlike Carr and other realists, the
liberal internationalism of Woodrow Wilson is not central to this
critique, or rather is **[simply a continuation of early American
policies.]{.underline}** The key date here is not 1919 but 1823, [the
proclamation of the Monroe Doctrine which symbolizes the emergence of a
new kind of imperial rule. The Monroe Doctrine purports to warn off
European powers from attempting to take new territories in the Americas,
but actually involves an assertion of American power over the rest of
the Western hemisphere]{.underline}. This is a new kind of Empire, a
hegemony under which the **[US dominates usually without actually
formally ruling; the US often intervenes in the affairs of the lesser
American powers, and sometimes does so militarily, but always in the
name of progressive values and in the putative interests of the locals
--]{.underline}** this is a form of rule that is both more effective
than traditional empire because it does not involve the usual
administrative costs, but also **[more hypocritical, because it denies
its own nature, pretending to exercise power only in the interests of
others. The US is revealed From humanized war to intervention 61 by the
Monroe Doctrine to be an anomalous power]{.underline}** -- neither
'European' in the spatial sense conveyed by the notion of the JPE but
equally not non-European. It is this anomalous status (partly shared by
the other English-speaking sea power) which, once US power becomes
actual rather than latent and the form of rule embedded in the Monroe
Doctrine becomes potentially universal, destroys the old order, in a way
that a purely outside power (Bolshevik Russia, for example) could not,
although the Bolsheviks could, perhaps, physically destroy the old
Europe. The League of Nations Covenant (which specifically endorses the
Monroe Doctrine) represents the global extension of this hegemony. The
US did not join the League, but American economic power underwrote the
peace settlement and, eventually, in the Second World War, [US military
power was brought to bear to bring down the jus publicum Europaeum and
replace it with 'international law', liberal internationalism and,
incipiently, the notion of humanitarian intervention in support of the
liberal, universalist, positions that the new order had set in
place]{.underline}. On Schmitt's account, the two world wars were fought
to bring this about -- and the barbarism of modern warfare is to be
explained by the undermining of the limits established in the old
European order. **[In effect, the notion of a Just War has been reborn
albeit without much of its theological underpinnings.]{.underline}** The
humanized warfare of the JPE with its recognition of the notion of a
'just enemy' is replaced by the older notion that the enemy is evil and
to be destroyed -- in fact, is no longer an 'enemy' within Schmitt's
particular usage of the term but a 'foe' who can, and should, be
annihilated.

#### Liberal universalism is a humanitarian disguise in attaining unipolarity -- an ideological way of perpetuating imperialistic expansion and monopolize the idea solidarity forced on underdeveloped countries as an attempt to "purify" in the name of christiology

Indeed, Schmitt was a keen critic of liberal universalism with its
pretension of offering the true and only legitimate political system.
[For him the world was a pluriverse, not a universe, and he was adamant
that any attempt to impose one single model worldwide would have dire
consequences.]{.underline} In The Concept of the Political, he denounced
the way in which **[liberals were using the concept of 'humanity' as an
ideological weapon of imperialist expansion and he showed how
humanitarian ethics served as a vehicle of economic imperialism. As he
pointed out, \[w\]hen a state fights its political enemy in the name of
humanity, it is not a war for the sake of humanity, but a war wherein a
particular state seeks to usurp a universal concept against its military
opponent. At the expense of its opponent, it tries to identify itself
with humanity in the same way as one can misuse peace, justice, progress
and civilization in order to claim these as one's own and to deny the
same to the enemy. (Schmitt 1976: 54) This, in his view, explained why
wars waged in the name of humanity were particularly inhuman, since all
means were justified once the enemy had been presented as an outlaw of
humanity.]{.underline}** The current definition of the frontier between
friend and enemy as one between the civilized world and its enemies
would no doubt have been denounced by him as an avatar of the liberal
rhetoric. In fact, far from justifying Bush's strategy, Schmitt's
approach provides us with many insights to undermine its basic tenets.
**[Debunking its moralistic discourse, it brings to light the rhetorical
moves used by the current US government to confiscate and monopolize the
idea of civilization]{.underline}**. [By declaring, as Bush did in one
of his speeches, that 'those who are not with us are against us' the
current American strategy renders illegitimate all forms of opposition
to the attempt to impose a 'Pax Americana' on the whole planet. Schmitt
reveals how this kind of discourse, far from being new, has for long
been at the core of American politics. He thereby helps us to locate
Bush's strategy in the wider context of the various steps taken by the
US to enforce its global hegemony.]{.underline} In 'Völkerrechtlichen
Formen des modernen Imperialismus', 148 C. Mouffe a text published in
1932 which is extremely relevant for our present predicament, **[Schmitt
examined the new form of imperialism represented by the US (Schmitt 1994
\[1932\]). Its specificity consisted in playing with the antithesis
economy versus politics, claiming -- in an eminently political way --
that economy and commerce were 'apolitical']{.underline}**. [He argued
that, thanks to the Monroe Doctrine proclaimed in 1823, the US had
managed, first, to exclude the great powers from the American continent,
so as to subject all the nations of that continent to its exclusive
hegemony, and later to justify its sole right of intervention in those
countries in the name of international police actions to secure
democracy. Schmitt was particularly interested in a new juridical form
invented by the US, the 'contract of intervention', which allowed them
to intervene in the affairs of another state on the pretext of helping
it to defend its independence or the property and liberty of its
citizens. Officially such states remained independent and sovereign,
**but in practice they were taken under the control of the US which
could decide to intervene when it considered its interests were in
jeopardy**]{.underline}. **[Such contracts of intervention were mainly
signed with Central American countries and Schmitt examines in detail
the case of Cuba, which the US 'liberated' from Spain in 1898.
The]{.underline}** **[young republic was quickly forced to sign a
'contract of intervention' which allowed the US to maintain troops,
control several strategic bases, receive important economic and
financial concessions and even intervene in Cuba's internal affairs in
order to guarantee its independence and maintain the
peace]{.underline}**. [Indeed, the Marines repeatedly landed in Cuba in
the 1900s and each time the US declared that it was not an intervention
since the contract of intervention gave it the right to intervene. For
instance, when it intervened in 1919, it was under the pretext of
guaranteeing independent elections. No great effort **is needed to find
many parallels with what is happening in Iraq today**]{.underline}

#### The aff's injection of humanitarianism and justice in the name of liberal Cosmopolitianism reflects an imperialistic white burden standard of human rights preceding international law to knowingly justify militarized intervention

The overcoming of the sovereign nation-state is one of the keystones of
cosmopolitan thinking: its centrality in the Westphalian order, as well
as its tendency towards **[war and self-interested behaviour, has been
considered one of the main obstacles to greater international
cooperation and integration]{.underline}**. **[Liberal cosmopolitanism,
therefore, encourages the 'crossing of the line' for people, capital,
commerce and justice]{.underline}**, arguing that '\[w\]e no longer
live, if we ever did, in a world of discrete national communities' (Held
2002: 74). A second tenet of cosmopolitanism is the promotion of the
individual. Recognising that globalisation was intimately connected with
'individualization', Ulrich Beck proclaimed that we were now living in
the 'second age of modernity', an age that had at its centre, not the
state, but the individual. [Beck advanced a view of cosmopolitanism
which turns on its head the staples of the pluralist international
society.]{.underline} This second 'cosmopolitan' stage of modernity,
**[Beck suggests, is distinct from the modern statist order of
international law, where 'international law (and the state) precedes
human rights']{.underline}** (Beck 2000: 83). **[This cosmopolitan
second stage involves the construction of a legal, ethical and political
order that properly reflects the centrality of the rights-bearing
individual, who is no longer grounded in community and state, but rather
that itself grounds a new order, in which 'human rights precedes
international law' (ibid.) Such a cosmopolitan order seeks the
denigration of distinctions, such as 'war and peace, domestic (policy)
and foreign (policy)' which had supported the Westphalian system
(ibid.)]{.underline}**. This order, moreover, 'goes over the heads of
the collective subjects of international law \[states\] to give [legal
status to the individual subjects and justifies their 130 L. Odysseos
unmediated membership in the association of free and equal world
citizens']{.underline} (Habermas 1997: 128). **[It presupposes, in other
words, that politics, law and morality ought to converge and be
explicitly grounded on 'a legally binding world society of
individuals']{.underline}** (Beck 2000: 84). Within the contemporary
literature it is often acknowledged that **[there are at least two
distinct strands of cosmopolitanism. The first maintains a critical
attitude towards some 'run-away' or negative processes of globalisation
and promotes 'human rights' and desirable standards by which global
capitalism has to abide (see, for example, Falk 1995). The second strand
of cosmopolitanism 'run\[s\] parallel to the discourse of globalisation
and rhetorically complement\[s\] it' (Gowan 2003: 51), being neo-liberal
in its ideological orientation.]{.underline}** Moreover, it considers
the Westphalian principles of sovereignty and non-intervention as
conditional, in that **[they 'can be withdrawn should any states fail to
meet the domestic or foreign standards laid down by the requirements of
liberal governance' (ibid.: 52). State sovereignty, in other words,
becomes restricted by 'the simple but uncontested sovereignty of
liberalism itself']{.underline}** (Rasch 2003: 141). [This neo-liberal
cosmopolitanism claims to promote human rights against sovereignty but
often betrays an 'arbitrary attitude towards enforcing of universalist
liberal norms of individual rights' despite its resting on the argument
of a humanity that is 'finally on the verge of being unified in a
single, just world order' (Gowan 2003: 52). While this distinction is
partly useful, the two strands of cosmopolitanism tend to reinforce each
other and, more importantly, rely heavily on the political discourse of
humanity for their justification.]{.underline} This discourse calls
forth, and justifies, a (re)ordering of international politics: towards
global governance, in the first strand, or as a result of 'just',
'**[humanitarian' interventions and other such militarised responses, in
the second strand]{.underline}**. Next, I examine important concerns
articulated about the discourse of humanity before turning to the
relationship between cosmopolitanism and the War on Terror.

### Otherness

#### Assigning special moral status to the other is an expression of universal liberalism that generates endless war.

Carl Schmitt: Terror Liberal War and the Crisis of Global Order pg
120-121)

As Gary Ulmen has pointed out, for Schmitt, the 'key to the concept of
the Political is \... not enmity but the *distinction* itself' (Ulmen
1987: 189). [The political is]{.underline} therefore [based on the
reality of difference and of plurality in international
society]{.underline}. One should not exaggerate this point and
romanticize this reality too much. Neither identity nor difference can
claim moral or ethical priority as such. Hence, [no moral privilege can
be assigned to the 'other', as some 'post-modern' ethics have tried to
do]{.underline}. [The main concern]{.underline} for realists like
Schmitt [is instead to limit the inherent violence in a system of
difference that has no recourse to a higher political, judicial or moral
authority. Irreconcilable differences abound, and violence is thus a
systemic condition, always implicated in the decisions between self and
other, friend and enemy, and always a potentiality in the relations
between these entities]{.underline}. For Schmitt, the distinction
between friend and enemy establishes a limit for conﬂict by associating
it with what William Connolly has called 'agonistic respect' (Connolly
1994: 166--167). In Schmitt's terms, '[according to traditional
international law, war ﬁnds its right, its honour and its dignity in the
fact that the enemy is no pirate and no gangster, but a "state" and a
"subject of international law]{.underline}"' (Schmitt 1988: 48--49[).
The recognition of sovereign equality, and the concomitant recognition
that the only universally acceptable norm is the absence of universal
norms, imposes a modicum of restraint upon the exercise of
violence]{.underline}, as it divests states of morality and truth as
legitimizing resources. Again, if 'agonistic respect' sounds too
romantic in this context, [one might justify the restraint imposed upon
the exercise of force against other states by the prudent recognition
that 'our' ideas, values and principles may not be the solution to the
problems in other places. Moreover, and in regard to the liberal
fondness for liberating 'oppressed' people, the right of
self-determination that is at the heart of the democratic entitlement
vests in none other than the people, and \... it is they -- not some
foreign power that they have similarly *not* elected -- who must
determine their own destiny.]{.underline} (Byers and Chesterman 2000:
291) Against this, [liberalism identiﬁes violence as the by-product of
the continued presence of 'otherness' in the international system.
Consequently, instead of limitation, its goal is
elimination.]{.underline} Or more precisely, perhaps, violence is to be
'channelled' so as to abolish itself, by reserving the legitimate right
to exercise it to liberal democracies. Violence becomes justiﬁed and
legitimate when it is used by these states to eradicate its own sources,
that is, the presence of 'otherness'. [At best, non-democratic regimes
can hope for toleration -- itself a form of ontological violence
(Connolly 1994: 43) -- by democratic states]{.underline}. Ultimately,
however, their presence, which keeps history from fulﬁlling itself,
needs to be terminated. Accordingly, war takes on a different notion.
For realists, it is the extension of the political, an expression of a
systemic condition in which irreconcilable differences might have to be
settled by force. In the absence of an authority to decide the justness
of such causes, war is purely instrumental in settling the score. For
liberals[, war becomes discriminatory, as it is legitimate when
exercised by the 'right' agents for the sake of democracy and peace. War
on the other hand deteriorates into pure aggression and criminality when
conducted by the 'other'.]{.underline} Given that the 'other' is the
source of residual conﬂict and violence in the international system,
[war is ultimately about the eradication of 'otherness', not about the
settling of scores between different entities. As long as this is not
accomplished, war is but suspended. The distinction between war and
peace therefore becomes blurred, as the presence of the 'other'
constitutes a permanent threat. Peace and peaceful means of diplomacy
and statecraft become the extension of war, as the imminent end of
history and the coming of a 'world of liberal states' can afford no
lasting peace and recognition of the 'other']{.underline}. If the
realists have it right, we can expect the world to continue to offer
resistance to this liberal eschatology. The problem with this is that it
will most likely simply make liberalism double its efforts and raise the
level of violence further. [As long as war is exercised for the sake of
the ascetic ideal of its own abolition, it will continue to eliminate
its limits.]{.underline}

### Poverty

#### The war on poverty is one way liberalism expresses its desire to end all conflict and achieve homogenization of internal order.

**Thorup**, a lecturer in the History of Philosophy Department at Aarhus
University, in **'6** \[Mikkel, In Defense of Enmity -- Critiques of
Liberal Globalism\] If we choose to be morality\'s avenging angel in
places like Kosovo, we may at first be pleased to see ourselves, like
Kurtz in Heart of Darkness, as an \'emissary of pity and progress\'. But
as warriors for right, faced with those we have demonized we may well
succumb to Kurtz\'s conclusions as well: \'Exterminate the brutes\'.
(Benjamin Schwarz, quoted from Chandler 2002: 191)

Schmitt saw political enmity as limited and feared the consequences of
its degeneration, [once transferred to other registers]{.underline}. The
argument is that [enmity does not disappear]{.underline}, when we leave
the political vocabulary. [It re-emerges in new and]{.underline}
possible [worse versions.]{.underline} In this section, we\'ll examine
four different categories of enmity to illustrate, what is here
interpreted as the return of the political - this time in distorted
forms.131 The four categories are [moral, abstract, biopolitical and
individual enmity. What characterizes political or conventional enmity
is that the enemy is considered an equal]{.underline}; it\'s a
symmetrical relation of enmity. [There is a sense of equality, which is
the precondition for rules of war]{.underline} (Walzer 2000: 128). [The
goal is to defeat, not annihilate the enemy]{.underline}. Once the
conflict is over, one can sign a peace treaty, reassume diplomatic and
commercial relations etc. [The interaction]{.underline}, even [in war,
is codified and]{.underline} hence [limited]{.underline}. In the
interstate war, [no one can claim a \'just cause\']{.underline}, and
none is needed, [because states have the right to engage in
war]{.underline}. No one can ideally claim moral superiority. [The
political enmity is therefore \'clean\', contained and limited. The
enemy is \'the other\', but recognizable and familiar even in war and
enmity]{.underline}. The important characteristic of the political
enmity is the horizontal relationship between enemies. This is seriously
challenged in its other forms. One example could be the shift from
Reagan\'s \'empire of evil\' to Bush Jr.\'s \'axis of evil\'. The first
denotes a loathed but still recognizable political form (and Reagan did
negotiate with this \'evilness\'), whereas the second looses all
political content and form. It\'s pure evil. [Evil comes in many shapes,
some of them we can live with because they are,]{.underline} at bottom,
[recognized as an opponent and not as evil as such]{.underline} (Dean
2005).

I want to briefly mention the moral enmity before moving on to other
three categories, only to later return to the moral register. The most
important expression of the moral enmity is the idea of \'just war\',
which gives one the moral superiority. The enemy is degraded, deemed
inferior and criminalized. In the moral vocabulary, the equal
relationship between enemies is being altered to an unequal relationship
between the good and the bad. Enmity goes from a non-discriminatory to a
discriminatory modus operandi: \"Today [the enemy, just like the war
itself, comes to be at once]{.underline} banalized ([reduced to an
object of routine police repression]{.underline}) [and
absolutized]{.underline} (as the Enemy, [an absolute threat to the
ethical order]{.underline})\" (Hardt & Negri 2000: 13). Actually there
are a number of similarities between [the political and the moral
enmity]{.underline}. Both [operate under the assumption that the enemy
is external, visible and identifiable. The relation between friend and
enemy is thought as a relation between well-defined and demarcated
entities.]{.underline} This changes, [as we move to the other categories
of enmity, where the obvious in/out, friend/enemy differentiation
dissolve and new attempts at their reinstatement emerge.]{.underline}
This chapter continues the exploration of the forms of enmity started in
chapter 3 on Schmitt\'s concepts of the enemy: Conventional, real,
absolute, unconventional, internal and depoliticized. It attempts to
update Schmitt\'s list and zoom III on contemporary expressions of
enmity emerging from liberal post-politic societies.

Abstract Enmity

[In the abstract enmity, as we find]{.underline} it for instance [in
\'the war on drugs\', \'the war on poverty\']{.underline} and most
prominently \'the war on terror\' (which lies somewhere between the
abstract and the moral enmity), [we see a blurring of front lines and
the disappearance of the enemy]{.underline}. It is highly symbolic that
Osama Bin Laden has not been caught and that both his whereabouts and
physical condition (dead or alive?) is unknown. This illustrates nicely
the invisibility of the abstract enemy. When the first George Bush was
president, he said after an US-Soviet summit in 1990 that the enemy was
no longer the USSR but rather \'instability and unpredictability\'
(Barash 1994: 44). This enemy is a total abstraction and it quickly gave
way to various representations of \'instability and unpredictability\',
such as warlords (Somalia), old-fashioned dictators (Iraq war 1),
terrorism (first attack on WTC), international crime (Russia) etc. This
total abstraction cannot last and desperate attempts at re-enmifications
was made by what James Der Derian (2001) calls the MIME-NET, that is,
the military-industrial-media-entertainment network and by segments of
academia (e.g. Samuel Huntington). Putting names and faces on
\'instability and unpredictability\' is, of course, also one way to
avoid questions of a system that produces such features but mostly it
serves to re-direct energies and anxieties but also funding, policies
and wars.

[One is]{.underline}, of course, always [tempted to put a face on this
invisible enemy: The inner city crackhead in the war on drugs,
single-parent, teenage-mothers in the war on poverty]{.underline}, Osama
Bin Laden and AlZarkawi in the war on terror. But [these are just
symbols; their \'elimination\' will not win the fight.]{.underline} In
actuality, [one of the characteristics of the abstract enmity is that
the war cannot be won. War becomes unending and
metaphorical]{.underline}. When America named its war on Al-Qaeda
\'Infinite Justice\' (they quickly abandoned the name) it is not only
justice that\'s infinite. It\'s the war itself. 132 [We see the blurring
of war/peace as the war on poverty and drugs become part of daily
administration or as the terror alerts become routine. When the \'war\'
is daily life and the emergency measures become law]{.underline} - as in
the Patriot act - [we see a blurring of classical
differences]{.underline}. When the Department for Homeland Security
tells you to be alert at all times, then there are no difference between
peace and war. The same goes for the differentiation between friend and
enemy; now, [the enemy is potentially everyone. Drug tests in
schools]{.underline} or the labelling of all Arab Muslims (and Western
converts) as possible terrorists [makes the distinction between friend
and enemy impossible.]{.underline} As Michael Howard says, the
declaration of war makes action necessary: \"[To declare that one is at
war is immediately to create a war psychosis that may be totally
counter-productive for the objective being sought. It arouses an
immediate expectation, and demand]{.underline}, for spectacular military
action against some easily identifiable adversary, preferably a hostile
state - action leading to decisive results\" (2002: 9). But, [there is
no decisive battle, no front line or any destructable enemy in the
abstract war. This doesn\'t make the abstract war any less
destructive.]{.underline} Actually quite the opposite. [Because victory
keeps eluding, there is a certain eliminist tendency in the abstract
enmity. In the war on poverty it can be harsh welfare cuts, disciplinary
regimes and even racist \'science\']{.underline} (The Bell Curve); in
the war on drugs it can be militant police measures and actual wars in
Third World countries (Columbia, Panama), and in the war on terror it is
shadow warriors, executions without trial, rendition of suspects to
countries who routinely torture prisoners or to CIA-controlled \'black
holes\' etc. American Defence Minister Rumsfeld allegedly complained
that there were no good targets III Afghanistan, why he pressed for a
war in Iraq; and the vice president Dick Cheney said that \"to the
extent we define our task broadly, including those who support
terrorism, then we get at states. And it\'s easier to find them than it
is to find bin Laden\" (quoted from Barber 2004: 126). This shows the
problems of fighting an abstract enemy. The abstract enemy is of course
often given a face, Osama Bin Laden, Saddam Hussein and Slobodan
Milosevic to name just the most recent. But what that shows, is that
they are no real-life substitute for the abstract enemy. The capture of
the latter two (and when Bin Laden gets captured or killed) has had no
detectable effect on the problems they were supposed to represent. The
naming of these as substitutes for the abstract enemy shows the
pedagogical or propagandistic problems of these new wars. We tend to
frame them in the language of classic warfare with identifiable enemies,
battles and fronts, victories and defeats. It\'s important to stress
that the apparent indistinction is systematically abandoned or
repressed, as enemies are named and pursued. The indistinction between
war and peace doesn\'t dissolve everything; it makes peace look, feel
and be like war, not the other way round.

### Prolif Bad

#### Their rhetoric of nonproliferation cements failure and [hamstrings IR and security studies]{.underline} since it's predisposed to side with the powerful West.

**Mathur 14.** \[Ritu, Department of Political Science & Geography at
the University of Texas, San Antonio. "'The West and the Rest': A
Civilizational Mantra in Arms Control and Disarmament?" Civilization,
Security, and Its Discontents. Pages 332-355. Published online: 16 Oct
2014.

Abstract: This article attempts to reflect on arms control and
disarmament as a civilizational practice. The provocation for this
undertaking can be traced back to the growing popularity of civilization
discourses. The article highlights the paradoxical tension within these
discourses with, on the one hand, their proclamations of
inter-civilizational conflicts based on failure to regulate and prohibit
the proliferation of weapons and, on the other hand, the teleological
drive towards building a universal civilization of modernity. It
critiques these discourses with the help of critical security studies
and postcolonial insights into the problematique of civilization that
seeks to universalize that which stabilizes and asserts the military
superiority of the West while marginalizing the efforts of 'the Rest'
demanding equality and justice in practices of arms control and
disarmament. The article then uses representative historical narratives
to demonstrate the historical continuity between practices of
discrimination and exclusion that persist from the late 19th century to
the present with regard to weapons regulation and prohibition.
Contemporary efforts to acknowledge and addresses the entrenched biases
in the practices of arms control and disarmament are discussed to
explicate their possibilities and limitations. The purpose is to bring
centre-stage the human suffering experienced by the West and the Rest in
practices of arms control and disarmament. It is only by confronting the
multitudinous affects through a post-civilization approach that the
reiterated bravado of civilization can be questioned and an empathetic
and sincere approach towards addressing the problem of weapons
regulation and prohibition can be cultivated.

How does the rhetoric of 'rogue' or 'barbarian' vis-a\`-vis the
'civilized' help to address the problem of weapons regulation and
prohibition? These [civilizational terms of reference have gained global
currency among academics, politicians, and policy-makers in the everyday
discourses on arms control and disarmament]{.underline}, [and have been
deployed to]{.underline} differentiate, denounce, ostracize, and
[impose]{.underline} sanctions [on the 'Other']{.underline}. [The
seriousness of these discourses in the context of]{.underline} weapons,
particularly [weapons of mass destruction, cannot be over-emphasized.
The concept of 'civilization']{.underline} is being deployed as a unit
of analysis to map the terrain of political developments and as a
cultural moniker of differences that cannot be easily negotiated as it
[subsumes]{.underline} even [sovereign identities of nation-states and
insists that 'the clash of civilizations will dominate global
politics']{.underline}.1 In projecting these civilizational differences
it is further claimed that '[the primary objective of arms control is to
prevent the development by non-Western societies of military
capabilities that could threaten Western interests']{.underline}.2

Prior to investigating any such claims in the context of weapons, it is
helpful to engage with scholars who have tried to conceptualize
civilization discourses to suggest their significance and relevance as
tools of analysis. The formula '[West and the Rest' is often projected
as representative of danger, generating concern]{.underline} [that there
exists an 'established common sense]{.underline}, **[made real in
collective discourse]{.underline}**, [that foregrounds some dangers
while repressing or ignoring others']{.underline}.3 It has encouraged
Mark Salter to suggest the surfing of a new 'civilizational realism' to
re-inscribe imperial cartographies on the post-Cold War order. [The dual
function]{.underline} of this move [is to render the 'West'
unproblematic and to 'barbarize' the multiple 'non-Wests']{.underline}.4
It is asserted that [the civilization discourse represents a form of
'technological mentality' that demonizes the others and appropriates for
itself the most advanced weapons of war as achievements of its own
civilization.5]{.underline} It encompasses both 'civilizing processes'
of interdependence and expansion through mutual identification and is
vulnerable to 'decivilizing processes' that pose a threat to the
established status quo.6 This approach encourages us to question, '[must
we always polarize in order to polemicize?]{.underline}'7

In response to this question, Helen Kinsella urges us to be more
expansive and attentive to 'discourses of civilization' for the
following eight functional reasons.8 First, [discourses of civilization
'demarcate static differences, most frequently bounded by territorial
distinctions']{.underline}.9 Second, discourses of civilization '[denote
processes of transformation -- from barbarism to civilization -- that
immediately undermine the presumption of static or stable
differences']{.underline}.10 Third, discourses of civilization '[set the
limits of law]{.underline} (civilization vs. barbarism) [and occasion
the exercise of law]{.underline} (from barbarism to civilization)'.11
Fourth, discourses of civilization [are 'progressive and formative',
'set boundaries', and 'order an international hierarchy']{.underline}.12
Fifth, discourses of civilization [regulate 'entry into the European
state system']{.underline} and [legitimate 'an entirely different system
of rules for those deemed outside the system']{.underline}.13 Sixth,
discourses of civilization '[require]{.underline} the participation and
[submission of all to propagate its future']{.underline}.14 Seventh,
[configuring the productive power of civilizational discourses allows
for the possibility of indeterminacy and problems of
compliance]{.underline}.15 Eighth, [discourses of civilization 'expose
the temporality of any such hierarchies']{.underline}.16 Thus, Kinsella
attributes much weightage to [civilization discourses as constituting
epistemological boundaries of learning]{.underline} but does not
articulate how interventions with the help of [civilization discourses
are made to serve particular political projects such as arms control and
disarmament.]{.underline}

Patrick Jackson suggests that we understand the civilization discourse
[as a rhetorical resource that can be deployed to maintain the status
quo]{.underline}. He argues that 'the language of "Western
civilization", although powerful, is also historically and strategically
pliable'.17 He expresses an interest in 'the role of a rhetorical
commonplace like "Western civilization" as an analytical category, a
general framework or a wider context of struggle within which any agenda
such as weapons regulation and control might be pursued'.18 The
particular manner of deployment of 'Western civilization' as a
rhetorical commonplace is of interest as part of a 'process of
legitimation'.

19 A CIVILIZATIONAL MANTRA IN ARMS CONTROL AND DISARMAMENT? 333

He therefore argues that:

\... tracing the history of a commonplace should not be the record of
any intrinsic essence that the commonplace is purported to possess, but
rather a record of how historical actors have sought to stabilize the
commonplace, and in doing so provided (perhaps unintentionally) the
commonplace to the present actors as a resource.20

Jackson encourages us to '[focus on the language of "Western
civilization]{.underline} \... [to appreciate the kind of shaping effect
that public debates about identity have on specific policy initiatives'
such as arms control and disarmament]{.underline}.21 A study that
focuses on 'civilizational identity' helps one to grasp 'the dynamics
and implications associated with claims to belong to a given
civilization, and the political and social [consequences of debates
about what that membership means]{.underline} in practice'.22 **[These
meanings are crucial]{.underline}** as they [have an important bearing
on efforts to regulate and prohibit weapons.]{.underline}

My suggestion is that instead of getting immediately swept up in
alarmist, polarizing assertions associated with civilization discourse
or their particular functional utility, we pause and be attentive to
Jackson's suggestion of civilization as a rhetorical resource deployed
in the field of arms control and disarmament. [The rhetoric of
civilization and the violence of civilization discourses has scarcely
been questioned within the field of arms control and
disarmament]{.underline}. [It is imperative that]{.underline} the
reiteration and circulation of [this epistemological violence for
centuries should now be questioned]{.underline}. This is possible if we
focus on the following questions:

. How has 'civilization' as a rhetorical resource been deployed in the
field of arms control and disarmament?

. How have discourses on civilization facilitated the demarcation,
regulation, legislation, and transformation of temporal hierarchies in
arms control and disarmament?

. How has arms control and disarmament become associated with a very
particular form of institutionalized paranoia encapsulated in the rubric
of 'West and the Rest'?

It is a form of 'persecutory paranoia' that must be questioned
rigorously.23 [An investigation]{.underline} of these questions [will
help shape alternative responses to claims that arms control and
disarmament represents a particular vision of a world
order]{.underline}.

In an effort to undertake this investigation we begin by first taking
into account the contemporary discourses on civilization in the field of
International Relations articulated by leading thinkers such as Samuel
Huntington, Peter Katzenstein, and Robert Cox. It is the writings of
these scholars that have reached a large global audience and set the
terms of the debate among academics and policy-makers engaged with the
problem of weapons. The observations of these thinkers are then
juxtaposed with some key insights provided by postcolonial scholars
questioning the deployment of hegemonic discourses in security studies.
The next section buttresses these insights by deploying a contrapuntal
analysis to read representative historical narratives that trace the
trajectory of arms control and disarmament from the late 19th century to
the 334 CONTEMPORARY SECURITY POLICY present. This evolutionary
trajectory of arms control and disarmament is disrupted in this text to
bring to the fore divisive practices that occurred during an era of
colonization; during the period of decolonization and the Cold War; and
finally, during the period after the Cold War up to the present. These
historical narratives reveal the colonial mindset underpinning practices
of arms control and disarmament and disclose how [the divisive binary of
'West and the Rest' is constituted as a part of the pervasive, popular,
everyday jargon within the field of arms control and
disarmament]{.underline}. It is this normalization that is scrutinized
further in the third section as scholars suggest how to address the
problem of civilization in arms control and disarmament. A study of the
deployment of civilizational practices by those that seek to maintain
the status quo, and the resistance offered by those that seek to change
it, will encourage reflexivity on the purposes and practices of arms
control and disarmament.

Civilizational Discourses

Samuel Huntington argues that '[the idea of civilization was
developed]{.underline} by French thinkers [as the opposite
of]{.underline} the concept of "[barbarism]{.underline}"'.24 Huntington
encourages us to think that the narrow understanding of civilization
focused on 'mechanics, technology, and material factors' has to be
supplemented with cultural practices focused on 'values, norms,
institutions'. Huntington further asserts that 19th-century Europeans
devoted their energies towards 'elaborating the criteria by which
nonWestern societies might be judged to be sufficiently "civilized" to
be accepted as members of the European dominated international
system'.25 Although Huntington acknowledges the elitism associated with
these practices, he makes little attempt to cite these scholars or
explicate their specific criteria and their application to particular
practices such as weapons regulations and prohibition.26

The demand for these criteria and their application is significant
because [the 'relevance of the civilizational paradigm']{.underline}
articulated by Huntington [is not an ahistorical suggestion]{.underline}
and his [rhetorical efforts to cite weapons proliferation as an
'intercivilizational issue' that positions the 'West and the Rest' in
confrontation with each other deserves careful
consideration]{.underline}.27 Huntington is content to simply describe
the [nonproliferation efforts of the West]{.underline} as [efforts 'to
maintain its military superiority through policies of nonproliferation
and counter-proliferation with respect to nuclear, biological, chemical
weapons and the means to deliver them']{.underline}.28 He astutely
comments that ['\[t\]he West promotes nonproliferation as reflecting the
interests of all nations in international order and
stability]{.underline}. [Other nations, however, see non-proliferation
as serving the interests of Western hegemony']{.underline}.29 Huntington
cites [the growing]{.underline} nexus of [cooperation between the
Islamic-Sinic civilizations]{.underline}, '[to develop their military
capabilities]{.underline}, particularly weapons of mass destruction and
the missiles for delivering them, so as to [counter the conventional
military superiority of the West']{.underline}.30 Huntington describes
[these practices of arms regulation and prohibition as '**arms buildup
versus hold-down'**]{.underline}, in the course of which,

\[[t\]he West's antagonists are]{.underline} attempting to acquire
weapons of mass destruction and the West is attempting to prevent them
from doing so. It is not a case of A CIVILIZATIONAL MANTRA IN ARMS
CONTROL AND DISARMAMENT? 335 buildup versus buildup but rather of
[buildup versus hold-down]{.underline}. [The size and capabilities of
the West's nuclear arsenal are not, apart from rhetoric, part of the
competition]{.underline} \... The outcome of a race between buildup and
hold-down is more predictable. The hold-down efforts of the West may
slow the weapons buildup of other societies, but they will not stop it
\... the political motives of core states and regional powers to protect
their local hegemonies, all work to subvert Western hold-down efforts.
31

Huntington cites several sporadic examples of difficulties in renewing
arms control and disarmament agreements and their violations by weapons
technology exchanges among actors belonging to conflicting
civilizations.32 But Huntington is not interested in investigating how
civilizational practices reiterated and reinforced can be obstructing
progress in the field of arms control and disarmament. There is almost
complete silence within the arms control and disarmament community with
respect to Huntington's observations.

Despite claiming that the outcomes of an arms buildup strategy is not
foreordained and asserting that an arms hold-down strategy will be
subverted by the nonWest, Huntington is surprisingly confident in
proposing the idea of constituting a 'universal civilization' comprising
international regimes and organizations.33 But he is quick to
appropriate [the idea of a universal civilization as 'a distinctive
product of Western civilization' deployed to achieve economic and
cultural domination that is decried by non-Western as 'a threat' and
denounced as 'nefarious imperialism']{.underline}.34 Huntington claims,
'**[The non-West sees as Western what the West sees as
universal']{.underline}**.35 In an effort to address these
contestations, Huntington suggests that success in constituting a
universal civilization is dependent on the emergence of a shared
language.36 Huntington appears to be sceptical of the rhetoric on
universal human rights and therefore it is plausible to question whether
the emerging language of international humanitarian law increasingly
deployed to regulate and prohibit weapons will serve as this shared
language.

Robert Cox critiques Huntington for emphasizing 'the solidity and
impermeability of the entities in question: the impermeability of
civilization'.37 But Katzenstein comes to the defence of Huntington by
arguing that, 'under specific conditions \... political coalitions and
intellectual currents can create primordial civilizational categories
that are believed to be unitary and may even be believed to have the
capacity to act'.38 It is explained that '[primordial civilizational
discourse naturalizes particular institutional or practical
arrangements]{.underline}. And thus [it can create
actorhood]{.underline}, validating dispositional theories of
civilization'.39 But Katzenstein too does not feel it is necessary to
articulate the 'specific conditions' that 'create' these primordial
civilizational categories.

Katzenstein is more interested in arguing that

\... civilizations transplant selectively, not wholesale. Because they
are culturally loosely integrated, they generate debate and
contestations. And, as social constructions of primordiality,
civilizations can become political reifications, especially when
encountering other civilizations. 40

336 CONTEMPORARY SECURITY POLICY

He further contends that there exists a plurality of civilizations
co-existing with each other within 'one civilization of modernity'.41 A
civilization of modernity is espoused to be 'a secular, technological
social order based on a normative commitment to the expansion of human
rights and the improvement of human welfare'.42

Katzenstein further insists that 'the existence of plural and pluralist
civilizations is reflected in transcivilizational engagements,
inter-civilizational encounters and civilizational clashes'.43 He
asserts [the significance of 'technological differences between
civilizations']{.underline} that help [determine whether]{.underline}
these '[engagements]{.underline}, encounters, and clashes [will be
peaceful or premised on violence']{.underline}.44 Katzenstein assumes
that [when significant 'technological differences' exist]{.underline}
between civilizations, [this results in]{.underline} encounters and
[engagements that are 'typically peaceful' and result in one-directional
transfers of technology]{.underline} as a form of simple borrowing. [In
other words, the existence of significant 'technological differences' is
a prerequisite for maintaining order in the international
system.]{.underline}

While Huntington and Katzenstein articulate the idea of 'universal
civilization' and 'civilization of modernity' respectively, Cox suggests
that '\[c\]ivilizations \... are historical phenomena, ways of looking
at the world, forms of collective consciousness'.45 He questions the
possibilities of generating 'one unitary global civilization or as a
plural world with a continuing diversity of civilizations?'46 In making
choices between these two alternative possibilities, he expresses
concern about [the growing military might of the United States as the
sole superpower]{.underline} and [alerts us to the 'illusion of assuming
one's specific tradition has the quality of
universality]{.underline}'.47 He is critical of a particular strand of
Western thinking that has become 'fixated on the idea of transcending
the state system \... by some form of global governance, an empire that
dare not speak its name'.48 Cox insists that the lack of 'empathy' in an
inter-civilizational dialogue will degenerate into a clash of
civilizations.

A brief survey of these civilizational discourses demonstrates that
there is a great deal of ambivalence among scholars regarding the
particular conditions that gave rise to particular civilizational
identities and the specific criteria deployed [to judge the Other as
civilized or not.]{.underline} Katzenstein merely suggests that
[technological differences serve as a key consideration]{.underline} and
Huntington and Cox express concern about weapons proliferation and the
military supremacy of the West. Furthermore, Huntington's understanding
of a civilizational paradigm is very simplistic in its understanding of
power as an exercise of domination and subordination through its arms
buildup versus hold-down strategy. It is eclectic and superficial in its
illustration of difficulties experienced in negotiating particular arms
control and [disarmament]{.underline} regimes. It [pretends to be
futuristic while being judgemental in its declaration that 'the United
States and the West remained committed to a hold-down policy
which]{.underline}, in the end[, **is bound to fail'**]{.underline}.49
The efforts by Huntington and Katzenstein to articulate the possibility
of a universal civilization or a plural civilization based on modernity
are interesting but there is lack of any serious consideration of the
possibilities and limits of generating a universally shared language and
addressing the problems of technological differences that are crucial to
practices of arms control and disarmament. In this context, Cox's
cautionary notes on the illusions of universality and the need for
empathy in A CIVILIZATIONAL MANTRA IN ARMS CONTROL AND DISARMAMENT? 337
inter-civilizational dialogue serve as useful reminders in
problematizing practices of arms control and disarmament as
civilizational practices.

Several critiques of these civilizational discourses are available but
none seeks to question the deployment of a 'civilizational paradigm' to
address the problem of arms control and disarmament. It is this very
silence in the arms control and disarmament community that serves as a
provocation to undertake this study with the help of critical studies
and postcolonial scholarship on arms control and disarmament. This very
small community of scholars is empathetic towards the need for a more
rigorous historical analysis of practices of arms control and
disarmament and is very critical of the state-centric structure of the
international system. But this [scholarship]{.underline} too [has failed
to seize the opportunity presented in the form of civilization
discourses that subsume the sovereign state system to project
civilization as the overwhelming identity that leads to confrontation on
weapons issues and will be the source of inter-civilizational
conflict.]{.underline} The postcolonial scholarship has not addressed
the problem of weapons significantly but has taken issue with
civilizational bias in security studies more generally. But the
commitment of both these approaches towards articulating the concerns of
the marginalized and questioning hegemonic practices makes them suitable
for articulating a critique of civilization discourses [in the context
of weapons]{.underline}. It is therefore contributions from both
critical security studies and postcolonial studies that are deployed to
[undertake a further critique of civilization discourses in the context
of arms control and disarmament.]{.underline}

There is a growing consciousness among critical security studies
scholars of a 'Western security culture' that has 'powerfully shaped the
NACD (Nuclear Arms Control and Disarmament) policies and practices of
states, and helped to define what it means for states to pursue their
national interests'.50 These scholars question the development of
security studies in its 'modern form' as an attempt to represent itself
as a 'seemingly neutral and timeless language of social science'.51
Barkawi and Laffey argue that [the Western right to bear arms and use
force is 'legitimated in terms of a civilizing mission of one kind or
another \... the assumption is that it is the right of the West to bear
arms to liberate the "natives."]{.underline} [This is and always has
been the primary justification for imperialism]{.underline} in all its
forms; it is about civilizing the barbarians'.52 A further claim is made
that 'conventional security studies rests on and reproduces Eurocentric
histories and geographies of world politics'.53 It is important to note
that

Eurocentric accounts of [great power competition tend to take the weak
-- the 'natives',]{.underline} the colonies, [the periphery, the Third
World, the global South -- more or less for granted.]{.underline} They
do so in the specific sense that [agency, rationality, power and
morality, as well as]{.underline} the fundamental dynamics of [the world
order]{.underline}, [are assumed to reside in the global
North]{.underline}. Alternatively, these various others are assumed to
be just like us, only weaker. This generates a different problem,
inasmuch as it denies their own history, their difference.54

Barkawi and Laffy identify two key problems with a Eurocentric framework
of analysis for security studies:

338 CONTEMPORARY SECURITY POLICY

First, as we have noted, questions of war and peace raised by great
power competition are foundational for security thought and practice. As
a result security studies provides few categories for making sense of
the historical experiences of the weak and the powerless who comprise
most of the world's population. By default these experiences are
conceived in categories derived from great power politics in the North
\... Second, and related, to the extent that it addresses them at all,
[a Eurocentric security studies regards the weak and the powerless as
marginal and derivative elements of world politics, as at best the site
of good liberal intentions or at worst a potential source of
threats.]{.underline} [Missed are the multiple and integral relations
between the weak and the strong.]{.underline} [Failing to study the weak
and the strong together, as jointly responsible]{.underline} for making
history, [hamstrings]{.underline} [IR and security studies ability to
make sense of the world politics generally and North --South relations
in particular]{.underline}.55

This framework of analysis also insists on a standard manoeuvre towards
'othering mass slaughter from the West and from modernity. [It serves to
preserve]{.underline}, in the face of any evidence to the contrary, [the
ethical character of the West and]{.underline}, in turn, [underpins
claims in liberal and security studies that the West is a force for the
good in the world'.]{.underline}56

According to Barkawi and Laffey, 'conventional security studies as a
field of knowledge is a product of Western power'. As a result, it

\... produces basic difficulties in understanding the course and nature
of events, that is, in empirical analyses, of security studies. [Whether
we wish to understand crisis decision-making or the cause of
genocide]{.underline}, [adopting a Eurocentric set of
assumptions]{.underline} -- about agency, objectivity, and morality --
[gets in the way and hinders our effor]{.underline}ts. Second,
[Eurocentrism in security studies]{.underline} also [means that analysis
winds up expressing a taken for granted politics that sides]{.underline}
with the rulers, [with the powerful]{.underline}, with the
[imperialists]{.underline}, and [not with the]{.underline} downtrodden,
the [weak]{.underline}, the [colonized]{.underline} or the
post-colonised \... This means there is both a social science problem
and a political problem. 57

In an effort to address these problems, it is important to pause here
and take note of the observations being made by scholars championing
civilizational discourses on the one hand and postcolonial scholars who
are critiquing practices shaping Western security culture on the other.
The scholars championing civilizational discourses are caught in the
midst of configuring the possibilities of a universal civilization
making marginal references to technological differences and weapons
proliferations that they suggest can generate inter-civilizational
violence. On the other hand, critical security studies and postcolonial
scholars seek to bring centre-stage the very language, categories, and
experiences that have produced and reproduced our understanding of arms
control and disarmament as an exercise in modernity and a civilizing
mission. I take note of these differences but learning from Cox's
suggestion of the need for empathy and Barkawi and Laffey's concern for
difficulties in undertaking empirical analyses to investigate the
relations between the West and the Rest, I proceed in the next section
to undertake a contrapuntal analysis of the integral A CIVILIZATIONAL
MANTRA IN ARMS CONTROL AND DISARMAMENT? 339 relations that have existed
between the West and the Rest with regard to weapons regulation and
prohibition. This analysis is constrained due to the limitations of
presenting it in a journal article but does serve to whet one's appetite
for more empirical research along these lines in the field of arms
control and disarmament.

### Realism 

#### The 1ac is an instance of realism in the global schema of arms control -- based in predispositions that make violence inevitable -- the "we fight for freedom, we fight for peace" model -- building our competitive deternce models, and our risk assessments getting lost in the idea that there is always going to be conflict -- via self interested power optimization that presumes relations absent taking into account desire 

**Scott 8** (Kyle scott, a visiting assistant professor at Duke
University, with a Ph.D. in political science: American political theory
and public law. "A Girardian Critique of the Liberal Democratic Peace
Theory" 55-58, 2008)

[Realism states that]{.underline} "[the sole basis of all international
relations is the struggle among nations to optimize their
power]{.underline}."50 While this definition may be too simplistic for
some, and certainly there are more refined iterations, the thrust of
this definition remains accurate. [Realists quite simply see state
action as motivated by the need for security]{.underline}, [which is
guaranteed when power is opti- mized.]{.underline} Needless to say,
Thomas Hobbes is the popular godfather of this view, though Thucydides
and Machiavelli should not be overlooked. [Realists seem to assume that
violence is the means of optimizing power. Yet realists do not explain
why violence is a valid option, or even a rational option]{.underline};
they simply say that is the way things are. Girard offers a richer
account of violence, and why violence is an option. To summarize what
was explained above, [violence is the only way one can eradicate the
disruptive characteristics of desire, because without eradication the
desire will persist in its disruptive form]{.underline}. The Girardian
critique of realism is similar to that levied against the LDPT: that
without an understanding of violence, peace is impossible. A proponent
of realism might argue that mimetic desire is akin to real- ism. But
[for realists, the motivation is self-interest]{.underline},
[while]{.underline} for Girard [it is desire]{.underline}. [Realism
works only in a world where the contested item is finite;]{.underline}
G[irard works in all circumstances, because desire is never ending as
long as other humans exist.]{.underline} [The object of desire for
Girard is not necessarily a tangible product that makes one secure;
rather, the desire is defined by the presence of an
"other."]{.underline} For Girard, there is no desire without the other,
but [for realists, power is optimized when there is no
other.]{.underline} Constructivists make an argument that is defined by
its refutation of realism[. Constructivists do not consider
self-interested power optimization through conflict as the only
alternative. Constructivists argue that states have neither identities
nor interests prior to their interaction with other
states]{.underline}.51 [Practice determines identity, and therefore the
reality of war can be changed by the alteration of
identities]{.underline}, which is possible because identities are given,
not innate.52 In other words, [because identities are constructed, they
can also be reconstructed so that more peaceful resolutions are
achieved.]{.underline}53 Girard would agree with the [constructivists
that our future path does not have to be war but would disagree with the
constructivist's conclusion that war can be averted by simply changing
an economic or political structure]{.underline}. Girard would argue that
[the current plan of the constructivists does not hold much promise,
only a change of scenery]{.underline}. The [transformations proposed by
the constructivists do not take into account the origin of violence, and
therefore any transformation will eventually fail if it does not
confront the issue of desire head on.]{.underline} It is argued by
Girard, and by some who write in the Girardian tradition, that [all
social structures are mechanisms put into place to control the violence
associated with desire]{.underline}. However, [the choice of
institutional constraints---just like the choice of the scapegoat---is
arbitrary and ultimately doomed to fail]{.underline}---just like the
scapegoat---[because these constraints provide no real solution to the
prob- lem but instead focus attention on how to channel destructive
tendencies into socially acceptable channels without addressing the
reason for those tenden- cies]{.underline}. Girard cannot follow the
constructivists to their final policy prescription, because [desire is
not constructed]{.underline}. Girard and the constructivists are limited
in the extent to which they can communicate with one another, since the
con- structivists assume a world prior to interaction, while for Girard
a world before interaction does not exist.54 [Social identity theory
(SIT) was originally developed as a means to under- stand the reason for
intergroup discrimination]{.underline}.55 A person has not one self but
a number of [selves defined by perceived membership in a social group,
whether it be family, club, or nation]{.underline}; a person takes on a
different identity within each group.56 [SIT explains that people become
ethnocentric because of a universal desire for self-esteem that will
lead to competition based upon that desire]{.underline}.57 This
explanation would fit nicely with mimetic theory, except that [desire in
mimetic theory does not focus on stature but on desire as an objective
end.]{.underline} For SIT, [identity is dependent upon perception and
definition]{.underline}; for Girard, desire is for something permanent
and immutable. [One of the assumptions that goes unexplained in SIT is
why people are social]{.underline}. SIT simply says this is inherent.
While Girard recognizes that [humans have always been social, he offers
a reason for their sociability rather than dis- missing it as
inherent]{.underline}. Girard, as has been explained above, finds that
[humans are social because of their desire]{.underline}, [which is bound
up in other humans who are the models for that desire]{.underline}. The
reason for desire is of course the existential lack that Girard
attributes to theological explanations, most notably, man's separation
from God. Such an explanation is obviously going to be unpopular among
empirical researchers, including most social scientists, but it should
be given at least as much credibility as the idea that something is
inherent, a state- ment that sets itself up as untestable and thus
violates a fundamental tenet of scientific inquiry.

### Reducing Arms Sales

#### Reducing arms sales of specific weapons or to specific countries maintains control over the global south and stifles any dissent

**Cooper 11** (Neil Cooper is a Professor of International Relations and
Security Studies & Head of Peace Studies and International Development
at the University of Bradford. "Humanitarian Arms Control and Processes
of Securitization: Moving Weapons along the Security Continuum"
<https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/13523260.2011.556855>, VR)

[If neoliberalism has facilitated a more permissive approach to arms
transfer regulation then this raises the question of why any limits have
been introduced at all?]{.underline} As already noted above, [one part
of the answer is rooted in the relationship between legitimized and
heroic weapons and those military technologies that lie outside the
boundaries of the heroic and the legitimized. Being the 'other' of
legitimized military technology facilitates successful problematization
and indeed 'extra-securitisation'.]{.underline} Additionally however,
the architecture of global arms trade regulation has been transformed in
the post-Cold War era along with the transformation in the objects of
security that accompanied the end of the Cold War. [During the Cold
War]{.underline}, the global architecture of conventional arms trade
regulation, like arms control more generally, was [principally focussed
on managing East --West tensions]{.underline}. One consequence was a
substantial extension of the range of dual-use goods invested with
security labels in relation to trade with Eastern Europe, most manifest
in debates in the early 1950s between the United States and European
states over the operation of CoCoM (Coordinating Committee for
Multilateral Export Controls).85 In contrast[, the developing world was
merely an object of security competition between the superpowers and
therefore a site for the supply of arms to allies. With the dissolution
of the Soviet threat the focus has turned more to the management of
North--South relations as the developing world has been reconstructed as
the source of diverse security threats86 and as humanitarian
intervention has resurrected similar concerns with the maintenance of
order in the developing world]{.underline} that animated the arms
restrictions in the Brussels Act. One manifestation of this has been in
the [reframing of small arms as instruments of disorder rather than the
means to shore up Cold War allies. A further example is the replacement
of the CoCom regime with the Wasennaar Arrangement, focussed
particularly on restricting transfers to pariah regimes in the global
South]{.underline}. This shift in focus is also manifest in the
significant rise in the use of arms embargoes in the post-Cold War era.
For example, between 1945 and 1990 only two mandatory embargoes were
imposed globally, on Rhodesia and Africa, respectively. Since the 1990s
there have been two voluntary and [27 mandatory cases of sanctions, the
vast majority of which have been aimed at actors in
Africa.]{.underline}87 Sanctions, just like the efforts to control arms
to Africa in the late 19th century have not been hugely successful in
reducing the supply of weapons to combatants. Nevertheless, they can be
understood as [animated by much the same desire to maintain order in the
peripheries of the world, particularly in a context where Western powers
have once again taken on a greater responsibility for policing and
managing instability in the developing world]{.underline}. Thus, the
post-Cold War regulation of the conventional arms trade is
simultaneously characterized by a relatively more permissive approach to
arms transfers in general but also a redirection of controls away from
the governance of East -- West relations and towards the governance of
North --South relations and particularly the disciplining of those
actors framed as rogue or pariah in the security narratives of dominant
actors. The campaign to promote an arms trade treaty may yet produce a
more meaningful architecture of arms transfer control -- the jury is
out. However the [framing of the Arms Trade Treaty to the defence
industry is perhaps instructive. For example, the UK's Ambassador for
Multilateral Arms Control has noted, the ATT '\... is about \... export
controls that will stop weapons ending up in the hands of terrorists,
insurgents, violent criminal gangs, or in the hands of
dictators']{.underline}.88 It should also be noted that current efforts
to develop a global agreement on the arms trade echo late 19thth and
early 20thth century initiatives to govern the international arms trade,
most notably: the Brussels Act, the 1919 St Germain Convention for the
Control of the Trade in Arms and Ammunition, and the 1925 Arms Traffic
Convention. Although the latter two never received the necessary
ratifications to come into force both were animated by the [same
imperial concern to prevent disorder in the colonies]{.underline} that
had underpinned the Brussels Act. As Stone has noted with regards to the
[St Germain convention for example, 'there was little doubt among
representatives in Paris \[where the Convention was signed\] that
keeping arms out of African and Asian hands was St Germain's chief
task']{.underline}.89 Accordingly, the convention imposed [far stricter
restrictions on sales to these areas as well as a ban on arms shipments
to 'any country which refuses to accept the tutelage under which it has
been placed']{.underline}.90 Indeed, although the convention never came
into being, European powers nevertheless agreed informally to carry out
its provisions in Africa and the Middle East.91 The 1925 convention
similarly imposed more severe restrictions on exports to special zones
that covered most of Africa and parts of what had been the Ottoman
Empire.92 Thus, viewed against this broader history of arms regulation,
[negotiations on a putative Arms Trade Treaty (rather like action on
APMs or cluster munitions) do not represent a novel post-Cold War
development that symbolizes progress on an emancipatory human security
agenda consonant with the promotion of local and global peace. Instead,
it reflects the emergence of particular sets of relationships between
power, interest, economy, security, and legitimized military
technologies that in turn create the conditions of emergence for
historically contingent architectures of global regulation]{.underline}.

### Root Cause of Violence

#### Attempting to rid the world of all violence results in permanent wars of purification. Political enmity is the only way to bracket this internalization of difference and violence.

as a Structuring Principle", The South Atlantic Quarterly, 104:2,

In The Concept of the Political, Schmitt concludes that [''all genuine
political theories presuppose man to be evil]{.underline}, i.e., by no
means an unproblematic but a dangerous and dynamic being.''2 [This
anthropological fiction]{.underline}---and Schmitt is aware of the
claim's fictional status---[serves as the logical premise that secures
Schmitt's definition of the political as the friend/enemy
distinction.]{.underline} We live in a world, he says, in which
associations with likeminded others are our only means of security and
happiness. Indiscriminate concourse of all with all cannot be the
foundation for necessary political discriminations. Thus, the
anthropological presupposition of evil, guilt, and violence is designed
to expose what Schmitt sees as the duplicity of liberal theory, which
consists in using the promise of formal equality to camouflage political
power by displacing it in the realms of economics and morality. Liberal
theory denies original enmity by assuming the innate goodness of the
human being. [Those]{.underline}---communitarians and liberals alike---
[who say there is no war presuppose a counterfactual ''ontological
priority of non-violence,'' a ''state of total peace'']{.underline} 3
[that invites universal inclusion based on the ''essential homogeneity
and natural virtue of mankind.]{.underline}'' 4 [If, in such a benign
state of nature, violence were to break out, such]{.underline} common
Equity.'' Such a ''Criminal'' has ''declared War against all Mankind,
and therefore may be destroyed as a Lyon or a Tyger, one of those wild
Savage Beasts, with whom Men can have no Society nor Security.'' 5 The
[violence would]{.underline} be considered a perversion and, if all else
were to fail, would [have to be extirpated by an even greater
violence.]{.underline} To cite John Locke, this ''State of perfect
Freedom'' and universal ''Equality,'' governed solely by reason and
natural law, can be disturbed only by an ''Offender'' who ''declares
himself to live by another Rule, than that of reason and political, on
this view, emerges only as the result of the Fall---that is, emerges
[only to fight the war against war]{.underline}, a war always initiated
by a sinful or bestial other. [It seeks to make itself superfluous by
restoring]{.underline} or, more progressively, establishing for the
first time [this natural order of peace. Should one demur and find the
perfect state to be less than advertised, then one's demurral would most
assuredly be recognized not as legitimate political opposition, but
rather as evidence of]{.underline} greed, moral perversity, or some
other [pathological behavior. With its pacific presuppositions,
liberalism]{.underline}, according to Schmitt, [dissolves the
specificity of the political and hides the necessarily asymmetric power
relations that mark all political maneuverings]{.underline}. [By way of
an anthropological sleight of hand, liberalism represents itself as an
ethos, a moral and economic emancipation, and not as what it really
is]{.underline}, namely, [a power-political regime with traditional
power-political aims.]{.underline} For Schmitt,
[distinctions]{.underline}, rather than the effacement of distinctions,
[structure the space within which we live, including the space of the
political. Only within structured space]{.underline}, space literally
[marked by human activities,]{.underline} by human [groupings and the
boundaries they draw, do terms achieve their meanings.
Norms,]{.underline} he repeatedly stated, [are derived from
situations,]{.underline} normal situations; [they are not derived
logically from underived first principles]{.underline}. Categories like
''liberty'' and ''equality'' can have political significance only when
defined and delineated within the sphere of the political. They are
neither natural nor innately human qualities; they are not self-evident
truths. Consequently, [Schmitt's suspicion of liberalism, pacifism, or
any other -ism that denies an initial and therefore ever-present
potential war of all against all is a suspicion of those who wish to
make their operative distinctions invisible, and thus incontestable, by
claiming the immorality or illegality of all distinction]{.underline}.
Schmitt's [insistence]{.underline}, then, [on our ''evil'' nature is
evidence neither of his existential misanthropy nor]{.underline} even,
necessarily, of [his conservative authoritarianism, but rather of his
desire to secure the autonomy and necessity of that human mechanism
called ''the political.']{.underline}' To the question of whether [there
is]{.underline} a [war]{.underline}, Schmitt emphatically answers
''yes''---by which he means to affirm [not armed conflict or bloodshed
as a virtue in and of itself, but]{.underline} rather [the necessity
of]{.underline} the view that [the]{.underline} proverbial [state of
nature is]{.underline}, as Hobbes knew, a state [marked by imperfection,
and]{.underline} that [this imperfection manifests itself as violence
and the guilt associated with it.]{.underline}

### Western moral superiority

#### The US puts forth the guise of a higher moral figure for arms control, asserting how other countries should reduce arms -- this is because other countries are always seen as the "Rest", more dangerous and something that should be sanitized

**Mathur 15** (Ritu Mathur, "Sly civility and the paradox of
equality/inequality in the nuclear order: a post-colonial critique",
11/18/15)

The fear of 'leaving nuclear weapons in the hands of black Africans' and
the deliberate 'destruction of archival records documenting the weapons
program' in South Africa is construed as a '[radical production of
ignorance and invisibility, perpetuated under the guise of proliferation
prevention]{.underline}' (Hecht 2012, 145). The postcolonial states now
venture towards acquiring nuclear weapons themselves. They argue that
the NPT has implicitly legitimized nuclear weapons (Singh 1998, 1). They
insist on [the principle of 'global disarmament or equal and legitimate
security for all]{.underline}' (Singh 1998, 2; Young 1966, 151, 153).
But as Victor Villanueva observes there is 'a difference between
speaking and being heard, that if one is constantly speaking but is
never heard, never truly heard, there is, in effect, a silence, a
silencing. . .how racism seems always to be an appendage. . .but not
quite integral, even when race is the issue' (Villanueva 1999, 653).
This silence is compounded with skeptical conceits that undermine the
technological prowess of postcolonial states to build nuclear weapons.
The struggle to acquire nuclear weapons by postcolonial states is
premised on their acknowledgement of practices of sly civility by
Western powers that persistently seek to use 'international law to
enslave instead of empower the non-European world' (Mallard 2014, 8).
The dense web of Safeguard Agreements subjects the signatory
postcolonial states to practices of intense 'verification' to ensure
that there is no diversion of nuclear energy from peaceful uses to
nuclear weapons. Similarly, other safeguards are imposed on the sale of
'research' reactors to developing countries on a case by case basis
judging conditions of 'stability' in the country. Despite these
circumstances the postcolonial 'outlier' states are held responsible for
exploiting the ambiguities and opacities in the interpretation of legal
agreements. The acquisition of nuclear weapons by some of these
postcolonial states and their acceptance of the rules of the global
non-proliferation regime is either interpreted as a 'sign that it was
ready to harmonize its legal views with those of the rest of the world'
or critiqued as 'the silent subversion of the whole nonproliferation
regime' (Mallard 2014, 15). The imperative to embrace modernity with its
'scientism' and 'technicism' is recognized by postcolonial states but it
is qualified by their critique of the unprecedented power of nuclear
weapons to unleash destruction and reiterated demands for disarmament.
But these demands are silenced with the Western insistence on their need
'to learn from Europe' and follow strategies of 'harmonization' and
'normalization' of their conduct with the established nuclear order
(Mallard 2014, 257--8, 281--2). In a gesture to reclaim and restore some
measure of respect the postcolonial states suggest that it is their
ancient civilizational heritage that can provide the mantra of
'scientific temper' to this quest for scientific modernity. [The
postcolonial states assert the need for a modernity based on a
civilization with a propensity towards ethical and moral
conduct]{.underline} (Chacko 2011, 185). They argue that the 'scientific
temper' has to be cultivated by drawing upon the ancient spiritual
strength vested in the civilizational heritage of India and China
(Chacko 185--208; Nehru 1980, 429). [This harking back to ancient
civilizations for spiritual superiority that will provide]{.underline}
the scientific temper to [technological prowess is nothing but an
attempt by postcolonial states to represent themselves as authoritative
moral figures in the field of arms control]{.underline} and disarmament.
It is as representatives of ancient civilizational orders that [they
then make their chivalrous commitments towards ameliorating the paradox
of equality/inequality]{.underline} in the nuclear order. [These
commitments include]{.underline} a moratorium on [testing, no first-use
policy and global disarmament to create a moral and ethical
civilizational order]{.underline}. But even this last morsel of respect
grounded on civilizational morality is snatched with undue haste and
callousness. The dynamic of difference is recaptured in the simple
equation of 'West and the Rest' and is unleashed with a forceful
velocity in the field of arms control and disarmament (Huntington 1997,
8). In this script [the 'West' as an identifiable, significant,
respectable entity is susceptible to nuclear threats from the amorphous
'Rest]{.underline}'. Huntington cites the growing nexus of cooperation
between the Islamic-Sinic civilizations, 'to develop their military
capabilities, particularly weapons of mass destruction and the missiles
for delivering them, so as to counter the conventional military
superiority of the West' (185). He concludes that the non-proliferation
efforts of the West are doomed to failure given the commercial
incentives and the desire to protect local hegemonies (190--1). The
argument on civilizational morality is mocked and marginalized as the
primordiality of civilizations is asserted and a warning issued for an
impending clash of civilizations due to failure of nuclear
non-proliferation. Huntington flirts with the possibility of a universal
standard of civilization conditional to the acceptance of a shared
language such as human rights (Huntington 1997, 59). But Donnelly is
emphatic in his insistence on human rights as a new standard of
civilization (Donnelly 1998, 1--23). Several scholars explore the
possibility of regulating and prohibiting weapons with the help of human
rights standards in international law (Felice 1998; Yanik 2006; Jawale
2012). [Several humanitarian petitions have been issued championing the
cause of nuclear disarmament]{.underline} but the current
'self-consciously grafted' discourses on human rights as a standard of
civilization to regulate and prohibit weapons generates a degree of
scepticism '. . .(as. . . the preference of the term civilization
reminds us) [a higher moral goal that some cultures may better reflect
than others in their conduct of hostilities]{.underline}' (Kinsella
2011, 138; Johnson 1983, 32). These concerns are not hypothetical as it
is claimed that 'contemporary international human rights norms, no less
than the classic standard of civilization, are European in origin' and
that '[the rise of universal human rights ideas presents a story of
moral progress]{.underline}' (Donnelly 1998, 20).

### Asia-Pacific

#### Their invocation of the Asia-Pacific is a manifestation of US imperialism. This community was created to deny the waning of US superiority by integrating outsiders into the democratic universalism of America's civilizing mission. This is the transition from hegemony as territorial expansion to flexible neoliberal dominance that operates through non-territorial imperial tactics like the 1ac's paternalistic oscillations 

**Jungha 14.** Kim, University of Pennsylvania, \"Trauma Of Empire:
Violence, Minor Affect, And The Cold War Transpacific\" (2014). Publicly
Accessible Penn Dissertations. Paper 1332.

As Rachel Lee observes, [the idea of the Asia-Pacific stands on a
tension between the global and the local, between economic boundlessness
and geographical moorings]{.underline}. In one respect, **[the
Asia-Pacific]{.underline}** constitutes a particular type of globalism:
transnational economism that undermines territorial nationalism.18 In
another, it **[represents an offshoot of a long genealogy of U.S.
imperialis]{.underline}**m, one that Victor Bascara defines as "[the
ideologies and attendant discourses of how the United States imagined
and explained its varieties of growth.]{.underline}"19 [The concept of
the Asia-Pacific in the late Cold War period offered a particular
American framework for the United States to respond to the economic
successes of East Asian nations]{.underline}, Japan in particular. As
Lee writes, "**[A primary reason for evoking a postnational community,
then, is to deny the waning of U.S. superiority by incorporating
"outsider" threats into a new transnational coalition]{.underline}**."20
However, the **[idea of disseminating capitalist universal teleology
across the Pacific can also be traced back to U.S. imperial endeavors to
incorporate the potential "enemies" of the Cold War to the body of
democratic capitalism, from the former Japanese enemy of World War II,
and anti-colonialist nationalists of Korea in the early 1950s, to the
Vietnamese communists]{.underline}**. From this perspective, [the
Asia-Pacific is an imaginary Cold War geopolitical entity that is
promoted in a particular historical moment of capitalist (not just
territorial) expansion; it thus fundamentally characterizes the project
of U.S. imperialism in Asia during the latter half of the twentieth
century]{.underline}. **[The Asia-Pacific is teleology, but its
teleological character]{.underline}**, to borrow Connery's words,
"**[has been shaped]{.underline}** in part **[by a residual American
frontierism]{.underline}**."21 In this context, my dissertation
contrasts an array of Asian American cultural productions with the
teleological geographical imagining of the Asia-Pacific and examines how
these texts alternatively imagine other temporalities and different
linkages across national borders. The writers I explore, including
Jessica Hagedorn, Jane Jeong Trenka, Aimee Phan, and Ruth Ozeki, offer
the cultural realm of the "Asia/Pacific" with a slash as a sign of
tension and contestation against the "**[Asia-Pacific"]{.underline}** as
it **[stands for free market ideology and America's unique civilizing
mission of democratic universalism.]{.underline}** These writers present
a range of historical scenes of the Cold War across the Pacific, [from
the metropolitanization of Manila in the 1960s, and the refugees and
transnational adoptees produced by Cold War's "hot wars" in Korea and
Vietnam, to the economic alliance between Japan and the United
States.]{.underline} [These historically and geographically diverse
sites are interlinked]{.underline} not simply [through the shared
experience of U.S. Cold War dominance and neoliberal governance, but
also through literary mediations establishing an affective transnational
zone: an alternative historical space that at once reveals the
contradictions of "liberal empire" and produces an eccentric temporality
disrupting its forms of linear progress]{.underline}. Linking the Cold
War with the history of American hegemony in Asia, Jodi Kim suggests "[a
critical genealogy of the Cold War as a genealogy of American empire,
one that reframes the Manichaean U.S.-Soviet Cold War rivalry and shows
how it was...triangulated in Asia]{.underline}."22 [Recasting the
dominant Cold War historiography]{.underline} that [has]{.underline}
[shed light]{.underline} primarily [on]{.underline} the facets of a
[Western inter-imperialist]{.underline} war over "cold" ideologies, Kim
turns to multiple [**scenes of "hot" wars intersecting with U.S. Cold
War intervention and militarism in Asia and to the gendered racial
formulation of Cold War epistemology around the figure of Asia.** Not
just as a historical epoch]{.underline} that ended with the fall of the
Berlin Wall in 1989, [but as "a structure of feeling" and "a
hermeneutics" that has enjoyed its epistemological, affective power for
supporting capitalist liberal forms of "developments,"]{.underline} the
Cold War represents a particular conjuncture of U.S. liberal empire in
Asia. In this revisionist perspective on the Cold War, Kim situates
Asian American critique as an analytic, not as an identity category, for
understanding the specificity of American imperialist practices in Asia.
This dissertation is aligned with Kim's work in that it attempts to
reveal the critical genealogies of American imperialism in the Cold War
by excavating the dimension of the repressed in U.S. nationalist
ontology. Mobilizing Asian American cultural forms beyond the terrain of
liberal multiculturalism, which manifested itself as an
institutionalized and commodified appreciation of racial difference
within the national, Trauma of Empire ruminates on the way these texts
emerge as a transnational minor cultural formation and render
temporalities supplemental to the developmental narrative of U.S.
imperialism. Put differently, [rather than offering an aestheticized
sign of difference incorporated into the national body, the corpus of
Asian American cultural texts I explore presents heterogeneous
symptomatic sites where the remainders and reminders of U.S. Cold War
trauma testify to their own seething presence and demand their own mode
of representation.]{.underline} **[From the perspective of the genealogy
of imperial formations, U.S. Cold War hegemony in Asia marks a
fundamental transition from territorial expansion to a more flexible and
neoliberal dominance]{.underline}**. As Kim notes, this does not mean
that territorial domination completely lost its controlling power in the
Cold War. Rather, it suggests that **[the Cold War opened a new phase of
"an imperial governmentality whose dominant logics have operated (and
continue to do so) through a flexible combination of 16 nonterritorial
imperial tactics."]{.underline}**23 [Following the "loss" of China to
Mao's communist party in 1949, America's heightened anxiety over "Red
Asia" was transformed and translated to an official political
language---the well-known domino theory.]{.underline} As an abstract
entity consisting of a number of dominos, [**Asian nations were
considered objects that should be checked and protected from the threats
of communism**. This patronizing gesture of the United
States]{.underline}, however, [was not politically disinterested: the
"democratizing mission]{.underline}," as Kim notes, **[was "an attempt
to install governments and economic systems favorable to U.S. interests
in the name of 'democracy' and 'collective security']{.underline}**."24
[This extraordinary logic of democratic solidarity across the Pacific
masking U.S. economic and military interests in the region provides the
ground for the workings of liberal empire]{.underline}. Each of my
chapters highlights specific cultural scenes in which Asian American
writers alternately map out and critically index histories of American
liberalism as it intersects with U.S. imperialism and its governing
tactics for political, economic, and cultural domination in the Cold War
transpacific. The cultural texts I examine, most of which were produced
after the "end" of the Cold War, either critically look back on that era
or interrogate the neocolonial and neoliberal global capitalist
formations directly or indirectly deriving from Cold War dynamics.
Trauma of Empire begins with Hagedorn's Manila in the 1960s, which
represents the fantasy of the AsiaPacific in the form of a project to
build a global cultural center in a neocolonial city, and which
materializes this fantasy's constitutive contradiction in the haunting
of dead laboring bodies. It ends with Japan-U.S. virtual interconnection
in Ozeki's novel, set against the backdrop of American beef export to
Japan in the 1990s and the process of neoliberal subject making embedded
within this economic exchange. While Hagedorn's text presents a
neocolonial practice that intensively and extensively extracts surplus
value from Filipino labor, Ozeki sheds light on a more invisible and
insidious mode of domination involving U.S-led neoliberal globalization.
Between these two antipodal scenes of the Asia-Pacific economic
"alliance," neocolonial exploitation of Third World labor and neoliberal
regulation of the "faithful" Cold War partner, respectively, I situate
stories of diasporic orphans who are uprooted by Cold War's "hot wars"
in Korea and Vietnam. Bracketed by these first and last chapters dealing
more directly with the intersection of U.S. imperialism and global
capitalism and with subjective responses to that violence, the two
chapters in between explore ways exilic subjects of split kinship
grapple with historical memories against the post-Cold War discourses of
reconciliation and forgetting. As this outline of my dissertation
reveals, U.S. imperialism of the Cold War is heterogeneous in its
aspects and manifestations. Indeed, **[U.S. empire is]{.underline}**, to
borrow Ann Laura Stoler's words, **[a "flexible empire" in its "active
realignment and 18 reformation...\[an\] empire that puts movement and
oscillation at the center."]{.underline}**25 The aim of this
dissertation is thus not to narrate a coherent and exhaustive history of
U.S. imperialism in the Cold War Asia; as Kim observes, the Cold War was
itself "an unruly set of engagements,"26 and attempting to narrate U.S.
Cold War history in Asia in a single seamless project would be
impractical. This dissertation's more modest and focused goal is to
trace and qualify the various forms of violence that this flexible
empire employs and to theorize the way literature registers the effects
and aftereffects of adjustable imperial power. While my chapters are
organized around specific nation-states of the Philippines, Korea,
Vietnam, and Japan, this particular geographical linkage does not
indicate that I argue for any historical commonality among these
countries other than their shared experience of U.S. influence. My focus
is rather on the way the peripheral subjects of the texts I survey,
whose physical and [psychic dislocations stem from Cold War dynamics
between Asia and the United States, develop affective modes of
reciprocity and intimacy and collectively act out and work through
imperial violence.]{.underline}

### **[China/Russia]{.underline}**

#### **Current policy reinforces the management of weapons through the ideas of superiority and rationality. The 'special responsibility' that the US has to handle proliferation of weapons on other countries is put onto China and Russia through the invocation of 'progressive enlightenment values'.**

**Mathur 15** (Ritu Mathur, "Sly civility and the paradox of
equality/inequality in the nuclear order: a post-colonial critique",
11/18/15)

The responsibility for this myth-making is primarily attributed to
states from the NonAligned Movement whose delegations at the NPT Review
Conference in 1995 are dismissed as being 'full of polemic and emotion
but devoid of any reasonable substance' (Krause, 491). [A third
projection stipulates]{.underline} that [the]{.underline} NPT accorded
the '[possibility of greater mastery of the political
sphere]{.underline} and of reining in forces which, if states were left
to their brutish ways, could result in a lethal nuclear anarchy' (Walker
2007, 437). [It derides China and Russia for not sharing
the]{.underline} same sense of '[special responsibility' vested in the
US]{.underline} leading the West in its effort [to 'handle' the
'difficult cases]{.underline}' against proliferation [of
weapons]{.underline} (Ruhle 2007, 519). [These projections
are]{.underline} then [deployed]{.underline} further [to justify
invocation of 'progressive enlightenment values]{.underline}' (Walker
2007, 433). It is argued that this has made it 'easier to draw states
into a rule based order that could moderate the power play that nuclear
weapons encouraged' (433). Secondly, it has helped banish 'romantic
politics inimical to restraint' (433). Finally, [it has helped 'erect
guards against the "unreasonable rationality]{.underline}"
[that]{.underline} always [lurks where politics and technology
meet]{.underline} in a competitive and interest driven environment'
(433). [The]{.underline} oxymoronic [idea of threat from 'unreasonable
rationality' is]{.underline} further [burnished with assertions of
'inherent superiority]{.underline}' of the ordering strategy and fearful
prognosis of an alternative that is perpetually vulnerable to
catastrophe (433). [The emphasis is]{.underline} no longer on
recruitment of new members but [on compliance of members to the existing
constitutional order]{.underline}. The problem of compliance is that
[the others 'may not have the power to create order but they do have the
power to cause]{.underline} some [disorder]{.underline}' (Roberts 2007,
529). [The problem of 'acceptance]{.underline}' [of the existing
international order]{.underline} in a manner [that upholds 'the existing
structure of obligations' continues to preoccupy the]{.underline}
attention of the [West]{.underline} even as it acknowledges that
'inequality is seen by the have-nots as less inevitable and acceptable'
(Kissinger 1957, 172--3; Hassner 2007, 463). There is concern that
'power and legitimacy' of the international nuclear order 'have been
profoundly modified in a direction unfavourable to the West' (463). It
is observed that 'the authority of the West' has 'considerably weakened'
and 'given a rise to a general feeling in the "rest" that they no longer
have to accept and follow rules which they have not created and which
they feel are intended to perpetuate a domination which belongs to the
past' (463). A perceived desire for 'new rules' and the insistence that
'these rules should be written less by a declining "West" than by an
ascending "Rest"' has generated a sense of profound vulnerability in the
West' (463). The West is now perplexed that the rest in their quest for
nuclear weapons is 'bound to think that the American strategic
establishment saw nothing wrong with nuclear weapons as long as they
were confined to the developed world and has discovered their madness
when they have become accessible to newcomers' (465). While there is an
admission that the NPT is an 'unfair treaty' with Critical Studies on
Security unequal obligations there is a reluctance to address the
problem of disarmament and insistence on projecting a threat from the
rogue states (Krause 2007, 492). [Any consideration of disarmament
is]{.underline} further [mocked based on the lack of]{.underline}
'positive acknowledgement', 'little evident [domestic]{.underline} or
overseas [sympathy' and improbability of 'gratitude and restraint' from
the non-Western countries towards the British experience of reductions
in its]{.underline} nuclear [arsenal]{.underline} (Schulte 2007,
505--6). [There is now a concerted effort to 'forget or downplay. . .the
hypocrisy]{.underline} which prevailed almost without exception [among
nuclear powers]{.underline}, and to a large extent also among
non-nuclear states, [about getting rid of their]{.underline} own nuclear
[weapons]{.underline} and reaching nuclear disarmament' (Hassner 2007,
462). On the contrary [there is self-congratulatory mood in the West at
the maintenance of 'a certain balance of hypocrisy' that has yielded
'positive results]{.underline}' (463). [These positive results
are]{.underline} described by Pierre Hassner in the following words:
'[The]{.underline} official [designation of]{.underline} nuclear
[weapons as illegitimate]{.underline}, [the commitment to get rid of
them in an ideal world]{.underline}, the need to justify their
possession by some kind of alibi was a positive factor' (463). However,
these positive results are now qualified by fears of an erosion of an
international political order based on 'mutual interests and shared
myths' that is now being 'poisoned by absolute hostility, or a search
for revenge, or at least an ever-deepening distrust and contempt' (463).
These fears are compounded by a growing realization that 'the
traditional instruments of technology denial were becoming less and less
effective' (Krause 2007, 496).

### Israel

As a diasporic people, [Jews were often viewed as quintessential
cosmopolitans]{.underline} -- a transnational community that was at home
everywhere (and nowhere). Throughout the Diaspora**[, Jews were
typically concentrated in itinerant trade, money lending and other
economic pursuits that depended on ramified networks of international
contacts, crossing a myriad of national and political
borders]{.underline}**. These networks also extended to the world of
learning, as rabbis and students travelled far and wide, from Alsace in
the west to Russia in the east. As students, itinerants, merchants and
migrants, [the Jews of early modern Europe were more mobile -- and
perhaps more visible -- than many other groups, bringing to mind the
'wandering Jew' of the popular imagination and of anti-Jewish
stereotypes]{.underline}.51 51. For more on this issue, see, Slezkine

natural audience for transnational ideologies and movements**[? Did a
transnational (or supra-national) way of life naturally lead to a
cosmopolitan way of thinking, a cosmopolitan Weltanschauung, a seemingly
natural marriage of convenience between Jews and cosmopolitanism? While
we cannot draw a causal relationship, it is worth noting that, among
many Jews, the ideal of a common humanity was quite often promoted by
individuals whose mobility and mercantile lifestyles brought them into
regular contact with wider segments of Christian -- and Jewish --
society]{.underline}**. In this respect, scholars have devoted
considerable attention to the 'Court Jews' of Central Europe and, more
recently, to the 'Port Jews' of Trieste, Odessa, Southampton, Salonika,
Newport and elsewhere.52 52. Carsten Carsten, F.L. 1958. The Court Jews.

who, in the words of Daniel M. Swetschinski, were engaged in two
simultaneous endeavours: 'the universalistic "cosmopolitan" striving
towards religious or ethical harmony and the more particularistic,
"reluctant" definition of a Portuguese Jewish identity']{.underline}.53

universal and the particular, or, in the words of the Russian-Jewish
poet Judah Leib Gordon (1830--92), about allowing an individual to be 'a
man in the streets and a Jew at home'.54 54. Quoted in Stanislawski

enlighteners (maskilim) and religious reformers not only highlighted the
humanistic elements within Judaism (and the Jewish tradition), but they
also glorified the Jewish people as the natural mediators between the
particular and the universal in an idealised society that viewed
individuals first as members of humanity, then as members of a smaller
subgroup. Many of these Jewish enlighteners also envisioned a 'neutral
society' in which a shared humanity -- rather than different religions,
races or nations -- determined the relations between Jews and
Christians.]{.underline}** The reality, of course, deviated from the
ideal, but Jacob Katz could still speak of a 'semi-neutral society' in
which the friendship between Moses Mendelssohn and Gotthold Ephraim
Lessing served as a model for relations between Christians and Jews.55

View all notes Katz did not conceive of the 'semi-neutral society' as a
form of cosmopolitanism, but others will assert that this may only be a
matter of semantics. As Michael A. Meyer has argued, [it was the
eighteenth-century cosmopolitan ideal that 'created a place for a
"virtuous Jew" \[like Mendelssohn\] in the intellectual world outside
Judaism'. This ideal -- 'that men were first of all human beings and
only secondly members of a particular nation and religion' -- animated
the writings of Mendelssohn and his disciples, but it proved impossible
to put it into practice.56 56. Meyer Meyer, Michael A. The Origins of

members of humanity and not specific nations**]{.underline}. In a
'semi-neutral' society, where social relations and civil rights were
still partly a function of religion[, Jewish enlighteners aimed to find
a common ground between Judaism and Christianity, one that would help
create the social conditions necessary for the emancipation of the Jews
and their unprejudiced acceptance as equals. For Mendelssohn, the key
figure of the Jewish enlightenment, this meant equating Judaism with
rational and universally apprehensible Natural Religion and defending
Jewish ceremonial law as an alternative pathway to the same universal
truths that were obtainable by human reason alone. In this view, the
universalistic ideal was not impeded by Judaism\'s particularism, but
rather fostered and mediated]{.underline} by it.57 57. Mendelssohn

Mendelssohn rejected the idea of a unified religion, but some of the
more radical Jewish enlighteners, such as Mendelssohn\'s disciple David
Friedländer, entertained something along these lines, when he proposed
conversion to Protestantism, while at the same time rejecting the

trouble embracing).

### Russia 

#### The 1AC's fight for a global democratic peace in the name of morality furthers a liberal order which breaks down the friend-enemy distinction -- leads to nihilism and endless violence. And, their otherization of Russia is an attempt to colonize the non-Western world -- creates a self-fulfilling prophecy that makes war inevitable

The disappearance of the Westphalian relationship of "just enmity" has
been thought of as one of the main strengths of the "post-political"
global governance. Based on the influential analysis by Mouffe (2000),
the concept of the "post-political" refers to governmental practices
that are premised on consensus, rather than struggle, as the basis of
the [liberal international order]{.underline}. Its [proponents often
emphasize that,]{.underline} "even though liberal states have become
involved in numerous wars with non-liberal states, constitutionally
secure [liberal states have yet to engage in war with one
another]{.underline}" (Doyle, 1983: 213). The [harmony of international
relationships derives from the general understanding that peace and
cooperation bring more benefits]{.underline} than their absence. The
phenomenon of [enmity appears only in the context of something to
be]{.underline} eventually neutralized or [turned into
friendship]{.underline}. The establishment of the [European Union,
democratic states and the transatlantic security cooperation signifies
the movement towards the concept of international
"friendship]{.underline}" (Prozorov, 2006: 86). The point of departure
for the liberal project to eliminate war is its belief in the sanctity
of the freedom of the individual (Doyle, 1983). Despite acknowledging
difference on the surface, [liberals]{.underline} see individuals to be
fundamentally uniform in the sense that all are concerned with
self-preservation and prosperity. Consequently, all "[share an interest
in peace, and should want war only as an instrument to bring about
peace]{.underline}" (Owen, 2000: 344). This is connected to Nader's
(1990) belief that conflict is a feature of a necessarily unhealthy,
outdated and dysfunctional society. The [behaviour of the non-liberal
"other" is perceived as inherently irrational]{.underline}. Nader's
concept of "harmony ideology" argues that aspiring for harmony and
minimizing confrontation brings real harmony and security in the world.
The apparent condition for such ultimate harmony seems to be a world
consisting of only liberal democratic states, for only they can
represent the actual will of their citizens to live in peace and
stability. In addition to the discursive de-legitimization of conflict,
there is its [increasing "moralization]{.underline}" (Mouffe, 2000;
Prozorov, 2006; Garsten and Jacobsson, 2011). The tendency of moral
evaluation of codes of conduct has been intensified since the Second
World War, when the [concept of the enemy started having an inherently
negative connotation]{.underline}. The most apparent example of this was
the [creation of International War Crimes Tribunals after the Second
World War and the new category of "crimes against
humanity]{.underline}". Since then, [the notion of humanity has become
the liberal raison d'etat corroborated by the United Nations Charter.
Any obstacle ---whether war, authoritarianism or anarchy---becomes
illegitimate by definition]{.underline}. A [consensual model of politics
suppresses the possibility of dissent by purifying the political agenda
from potentially contentious issues. The expression of frustrations,
antagonisms and disagreements occur outside of legitimate
channels]{.underline}. Usually, such dissidence is spontaneous,
short-lived and unable to pose a significant threat to global
governance. However, the attitude towards dissidence changes when it
comes to dissidence of the state in the international arena.
[Non-liberal states are viewed as]{.underline} potentially
[dangerous]{.underline}, since they may seek to usurp other states.
Thus, a considerable emphasis falls at the pre-emption of conflict and
state misbehaviour. [Global police power plays a distinct pre-emptive
role]{.underline} in global governance, significantly weakening the
regulatory capacity of the state (Ryan, 2013). The global police can be
understood as "a supranational investigative body with enforcement
powers" that maintains good international order (Bowling and Sheptycki,
2012: 130). It operates through different transnational regulatory
bodies, such as NGOs, international organizations, states, public and
private actors, united by the common task of [maintaining global
security and liberal order]{.underline}. The idea of a global police
takes its origins from the notion of a "good neighbourhood", which was
then transformed into "one neighbourhood" and embodied in the creation
of United Nations (Ryan, 2013: 448). The actions of the global police do
not depend on democratic approval, and there is no counter-power that
can legitimately scrutinize them (Jennar, 2004). This is sometimes
called "[governance without government]{.underline}", which, as Garsten
and Jacobsson (2011: 425) clarify, is governance through "[steering"
from heterarchical power centres]{.underline}. In contrast to the
conventional understanding of police, the regulatory modes of the global
police are not limited to rulesetting, but also [include monitoring and
"soft law]{.underline}"---quasi-legal guidelines and codes of practice
(Ibid.). Rather than being constraining, various centres of the global
policing gradually encourage and discipline states to frame their
policies in accordance with global models (Meyer, 2007: 263). In the
postCold War era, [guiding Russia and many East European states towards
the liberal future became one such example]{.underline} (Ryan, 2013).
[In the case of an international threat, the enforcing capacities of
global policing depend on the pre-emptively formed consensus against
specific activities that are recognized to endanger international
security]{.underline}. The dissenting actor faces criminalization of
their behaviour, its universal condemnation and general isolation.
According to Articles 41 and 42 of the UN Charter (1945), if the threat
is not liquidated, the UN may choose to take more forceful action.
Various governmental bodies unite in using "[diplomatic pressure or
incentives, economic measures or coercive action, often in
combination]{.underline}" (Feinstein and Slaughter, 2004: 145). In the
case of the current crisis in Ukraine, the [preemptive measures taken
against Russian aggression were the economic sanctions]{.underline}
imposed against Russia's major officials. The EU and NATO also suspended
their cooperation with Russia, aiming to achieve its political and
economic isolation. Placing global policing into the wider implications
of the "postpolitical" global order, the thesis of a leading
International Relations theorist, Wendt (2003), on the inevitability of
a world state illustrates a self-evident conclusion of liberal
governance. According to Wendt, the most formidable inadequacy of the
current collective security system is its voluntary status, which is
unable to eradicate the possibility of conflict completely. Its
member-states still retain their sovereignty and are likely to disobey
when they find it beneficial (Wendt, 2003). Thanks to a much stronger
capacity of enforcement, a world state would ensure against the
instability of collective security. Together with it comes the necessity
to eliminate all the possibilities of state dissidence. Yet, Wendt
(2003: 523) wonders whether the purpose of retention of sovereignty is
anything else than "retention of the right to decide, unilaterally, to
revoke an actor's recognized status and possibly kill them". As Prozorov
(2006: 87) argues, the ultimate goal of the liberal project is the
disappearance of the international as such and creation of "a
self-immanent system without an outside". Schmitt's critique of
liberalism Schmitt founds his critique of the liberal international
order on his concept of "the political". For the purposes of clarity,
"the political" is defined here as the struggle that roots any given
sociopolitical order, and from which basic governmental principles
derive. Starting from [Schmitt's]{.underline} early writings, such as
Political Theology (\[1922\] 2005) and The Concept of the Political
(\[1927\] 2007b), until his more mature works, such as Nomos of the
Earth (\[1950\] 2003), he insists that the [core of the political is the
struggle between friends and enemies]{.underline}. The political should
be distinguished from all other spheres of human activity (moral,
aesthetical or economic), as the friend-enemy antinomy constitutes an
independent criterion of judgement and action. Put differently, the
[political enemy does not need to be evil or ugly to remain "the
other]{.underline}". As the political is also the strongest antagonism,
[everything becomes divided according to the friend-enemy distinction
should conflict arise.]{.underline} Accounting for the political as a
domain of struggle shows that [war is unavoidable in international
relations]{.underline}. It is not to say that the political is nothing
more than a state of war, but it, nonetheless, remains an existential
possibility. Reflecting on global [liberal governance]{.underline},
Schmitt criticizes its [attempts to subdue the political to the rule of
law.]{.underline} He confronts the [liberal tendency to escape conflict
and to shield behind the fragile foundations of liberal normativism and
legal formalism. Liberal politics is but the ignorance and negation of
politics, its eradication]{.underline}. As Schmitt puts it, [there is
"no liberal politics, only a liberal critique of politics]{.underline}.
The systematic [theory of liberalism concerns almost solely the internal
struggle against the power of the state]{.underline}" (Schmitt: 70).
[However, as the most extreme antagonism, the political sources its
energy literally from everywhere and cannot be eradicated]{.underline}.
Therefore, [liberalism succeeds only in temporarily masking the
political]{.underline} through non-political language. Schmitt's
underlying concern is that the [dominance of secular
liberalism]{.underline} and rational individualism can be
[detrimental]{.underline} for sustaining the meaningfulness of life. In
his essay given as a lecture, "The Age of Neutralisations and
Depoliticisations" (\[1929\] 2007a: 95), Schmitt expresses his concern
that the "soulless mechanism" of modern technocratic governance will
cause the decay of spiritual life. Inspired by Max Weber's analysis of
"rationalization", he claims that modern technology and bureaucracy
replace human action and thought, causing increasing "disenchantment".
Strauss (1991) rightfully highlights the [presence of morals in
Schmitt's theory, as it is ignorance of the masses which Schmitt views
as the most corrupting force]{.underline}. If through participation in
politics one learns responsibility and reason, then, without the
political, one ceases to be a human (Darby, 2000). The [logical outcome
of such conditions "is a society that is held together by the market
place, where isolated individuals as competitors exchange
commodities]{.underline}" (Turner, 2002: 106). In short, Schmitt fears
that the sweeping blow of globalization and technocratic governance will
engender a society full of neutralized and vegetative bodies. On the
international level, de-politicization negates the existence of a
struggle between groups over what is right. Contrary to encouraging war
between states, Schmitt claims that political violence cannot be
justified unless it is a response to a threat to a group's "way of
life". As Warren (1988: 35) states, to define the political "only in
terms of conflict, would miss its distinctive qualities and potentials".
In the situations "when, at least potentially, one fighting collectivity
of people confronts a similar collectivity", the [friend-enemy
distinction encourages citizens to take responsibility]{.underline} and
sacrifice life for their form of existence (Schmitt: 28). It [ensures
against]{.underline}, what Warren (1988: 31) calls "a Nietzschean
world", or, in simplified terms[, a nihilistic world in which states
cannot preserve the meaningfulness of life]{.underline} of their
communities. Without the international political space, communities
would be unable to maintain their values, principles and beliefs. As
McLoughlin (2009: 143) states, "[liberalism]{.underline} negates
\[politics\] \[...\] as a locus of value and [reduces public political
concerns to private moral or economic ones". The political with its
friend-enemy distinction holds an intrinsic ethical value because it
gives meaning to the existence of the international]{.underline}. Since
"the concept of the state presupposes the concept of the political",
Schmitt (\[1927\] 2007b: 19) grants the state with the role of
organizing, managing and channelling political conflict. As put by
McLoughlin (2009: 141), "the ability to decide for a substantive value
and to realise it within the world \[...\] raises individuals up out of
the pursuit of their individual interests", and unites them into a true
political community---the state. Thus, the [state has to be autonomous
from all social institutions and interests to be able to make most
suitable decisions in life-and-death situations to preserve its way of
life]{.underline}. It requires a strong sovereign who would represent a
unified will of the people and remove internal opposition. Globalization
of the political as the strongest antagonism further reinforces
Schmitt's emphasis on the need for state sovereignty. Russia: view from
the receiving end of global governance Recovering sovereignty.
Inheriting Schmitt's view of the political, [Russia's political identity
has been largely based on differentiating itself from
others]{.underline} (Tsygankov, 2013). [Rejecting the concept of "global
democracy", Russia has introduced its own alternative concept of
"sovereign democracy"]{.underline} (Herpen, 2014: 57), for public good
is a relational term that depends on a concrete situation (Oates, 2007).
[Sovereign democracy implies that the state alone can set the criteria
of democracy for itself, protecting its unique statehood against the
intrusion by the world police power]{.underline}. According to this
theory, the aggregation of internal consensus and stability are
necessary for the state to be able to defend itself in the case of
external threats. Thus, the Russian political system [places state
sovereignty above the rule of law.]{.underline} Since no
juridico-political order can exist without an enforcing authority, the
president is given an unquestionable authority. This conviction guides
most of the decisions of the main party, United Russia, as much as the
overriding majority of other parties (Ibid.). Vladimir Putin's authority
equally prevails in the upper and the lower houses of the parliament,
the judiciary and the countless "backdoor" meetings and rigged elections
(Motyl, 2016). Electoral fraud and manipulated media work hard to
eliminate any chances of political opposition. Russia's legal system is
not inoperative, but serves only those who are willing to abandon their
animosities and unite in strengthening the state. After all, following
Schmitt, the Russian government considers its opponents to be by
definition outside the state law (Grigorov, 1997). Moreover, [what the
West defines as a neo-imperial "aggrandisement of state
power]{.underline}" (Herpen, 2014: 111) [and "war against
Ukraine]{.underline}" (Goble, 2016: 37), the [Russian state perceives as
the reconstruction of its unrestored unity]{.underline} (Tolz, 1998;
Laruelle, 2016). [For Russia, the transition to democracy and adaptation
to the liberal rules of international conduct became negatively
associated with losing state sovereignty]{.underline} (Fischer, 2012).
Since the times of Kievan Rus', Ukraine and Russia have battled and
identified themselves against common enemies. [Russia views the
Ukrainian land as]{.underline}, borrowing Lukyanov's (2010: 19) words,
"[a natural part of the country's historical and cultural
core]{.underline}". By supporting regime change in Ukraine and its
integration with the EU, the [West is thought to be meddling in Russia's
"legitimate interests]{.underline}". Accordingly, through the political
and military enlargements of the EU and NATO, the [West has been trying
to weaken its sovereignty by expanding its influence closer to Russia's
borders]{.underline} (Rajan and Rumer, 2015; Sakwa, 2015a). Therefore,
Russia perceived the overthrow of the government in Kyiv as a state of
exception that, by extension, threatened its sovereignty. The state of
exception can be characterized by a breakdown of order; an unpredictable
and uncontrollable situation when norms, legal rules and ethics lose
their validity (McLoughlin, 2009). According to Schmitt (\[1922\] 2005:
5), sovereignty belongs to whoever decides on the exception and whoever
is capable of dealing with it: "Sovereign is he who decides on the
exception". The sovereign decision cannot be foreseen by the
constitution. In fact, it must be constitutionally exceptional
(Grigorov, 1997: 275). From this perspective, the [annexation of Crimea
was Russia's response to the nationalist takeover, which threatened the
Russian minority living in Ukraine.]{.underline} In addition, the
[actions of the new Ukrainian government, such as the repeal of the law
that made Russian the second official language, endangered the
historical and cultural interconnectedness of two peoples]{.underline}.
This could also endanger Russia's "fabric of internal values" and, thus,
its way of life (Tsygankov, 2015: 293). Consequently, the Russian state
chose to restore the order by positioning itself superior to law and
interfering in the crisis. [In the West, most of the criticism of the
Russian state has come from a rather top-down perspective of liberal
governance.]{.underline} For instance, Herpen (2014: 57) confronts
Russia's coercive quest for power, the [absence of morals]{.underline}
and endorsement of the doctrine of social Darwinism, according to which
the strong ought to dominate the weak because of the very fact that they
are stronger. According to Bugajski (2009: 15), "instead of confronting
and expunging the Soviet past, the Putinists \[...\] diverted their
attention toward a new enemy, the rapacious West evidently intent on
dismembering Russia". Discussing the "paradoxes" of Russian politics,
Luzhkov (2003: 156), also condemns Russia's foreign policy for following
"the futile and mainly fabricated" rationale of "who to be friends
with". Nonetheless, the question arises: why would the state even think
of confronting a significant part of itself and, in doing so, weakening
its legitimacy before the people? The question is especially striking in
international relations, where sovereignty is vital for state survival
in the wake of the globalization of the political. Taking Russia's
perspective shows that the [relationship between the state and liberal
governance is inherently problematic because liberalism favours only
weak states]{.underline}. The sanctity of the way of life. Examining the
arguments for the incontestable powers of the state, the first question
that comes to mind is to what extent the public good depends on state
sovereignty. Indeed, from the liberal pluralist perspective, the
individual necessarily needs to be freed from the state. From this
perspective, it is not logical for Russian citizens to be proud of the
state aggrandizing power because it potentially amounts to the state
exerting more coercion. Nonetheless, the [perspective of the state helps
understand the concept of liberty not as an exclusive domain of the
individual, but as something that can be attributed to the political
community as a whole. Here, the state appears as the embodiment of the
overarching unity of differences within civil society]{.underline}
(Rasch, 2000). This unity constitutes its unique way of life, which the
state has to defend on the international level. As stated in Russia's
National Security Strategy, the state policy should be directed towards
"the reinforcement of the role of the state as guarantor of the security
of the individual" (Security Council of the Russian Federation, 2009).
According to Russia's Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev (cited in
Makarychev and Morozov, 2011: 362), "each country is supposed to
represent its own interests, instead of delegating its functions to EU,
NATO and other international organisations". This explains the
[citizens' pride in the state gaining more strength, as "freedom for
Russia" already ensures individual freedom]{.underline} and, thus,
stands before it (Putin, 2014a). But does state sovereignty still matter
in the liberal world where the individual difference is being
ever-increasingly accentuated and cherished? The answer that Schmitt
gives is a definite "yes". The reason for this is that [liberal
governance fosters global uniformity and hierarchy of values, while
shielding behind the preservation of difference on the molecular
level.]{.underline} More precisely, Schmitt objects to the attempts to
establish a global consensus over the universality of liberal values. In
his concise piece entitled The Tyranny of Values (\[1959\] 1996b),
[Schmitt develops a political critique of values]{.underline}, linking
it to his earlier remarks on global governance. Its main point is that
[value has a natural tendency to continuously valuate, and that this
valuation is not possible without simultaneously
de-valuating]{.underline}. As such, "\[[w\]hoever sets a value, takes
position against a disvalue by that very action]{.underline}" (Schmitt).
Wendt (2003: 525) insists that liberal governance does not foster
uniformity because the limitless tolerance and neutrality of viewpoints
allow the state to preserve its individuality. However, the narrative of
"particularism within universalism" (Ibid.) eventually turns into a
struggle for existence between the hegemonic and peripheral systems, for
"\[t\]he valuation pressure of the value is irresistible" (Schmitt). In
this case, the [notion of humanity as a community of universal values
---namely tolerance, neutrality, the rule of law, human rights and free
market---is detrimental because it supersedes the value systems of
individual states]{.underline}. Schmitt's critique resembles the "value
empire" narrative, which has been a prevailing critique of the EU among
the Russian elites in the last two decades (Averre, 2009: 1690).
According to Fischer (2012) and Sakwa (2015b), the [EU expansion is an
imperialist move to overtake Russia's sphere of influence through
entrenching liberal values]{.underline}. Hence, the Russian Foreign
Minister Sergei Lavrov (cited in Fischer, 2012: 39) asked: "We are
accused of trying to have spheres of influence. What is the Eastern
Partnership? Is it a sphere of influence, we would like to understand?"
Therefore, [Russia fears that it will no longer be responsible for its
way of life, which would be imposed on it by an external force, by
extension, disciplining its people]{.underline} (Odysseos, 2007). As
Meyer (2007: 264) claims, good citizenship of states depends on how well
they serve their "people". In turn, "these 'people' are defined in
standardised ways" (Ibid.). In so doing, liberal governance stands by
its claim to foster political plurality only insofar as plurality takes
place within the already predefined umbrella of difference. Defending
international pluralism? As show above, there is a strong correlation
between the sovereignty of the state and the preservation of its way of
life. Moreover, the two are closely intertwined when it comes to the
final justification of state dissidence---the recovery of pluralism
within the global order of autonomous states. Herein, Schmitt envisages
the international order to be a pluriverse rather than a universe,
representing a plurality of interests on the global scale. As put by
Rasch (2000: 12), Schmitt wants to begin "with a unity of difference to
attain a difference of unities". [International politics is essentially
a space of difference, which are often irreconcilable. Thus, the
possibility of conflict between states cannot be completely eradicated.
However, as political struggle sustains the meaningfulness of life,
there is nothing wrong with sovereign states asserting their power and
vitality against one another]{.underline} (Schmitt). In the case of
disagreement, it is [natural for states to group themselves into
"friends" and "enemies]{.underline}". Some states may choose to stay
neutral, but this does not make them "impartial" judges, since judging
also constitutes participating (Rasch, 2000). In such a way, wars would
be waged according to the ethics of raison d'état on how to best defend
one's way of life. Nevertheless, [in the modern world order, the
devaluation of different "ways of life" is done with a globalizing
force. In addition to the waves of de-politicization coming from the
centre of global governance, the negation of difference from below
causes the "abyss of total devaluation", the same nihilistic
world]{.underline} which Schmitt (1959 \[1996b\]) fears . However,
[nihilism can easily turn into a dangerous force once there appears an
actor or a group "strong enough to master the new technology" and chair
the new governance]{.underline} (Schmitt, 2007a: 94). Schmitt's
(\[1978\] 1987: 80) main [fear is the transformational of international
politics into "a world police power", where a particular group claims to
represent humanity at large]{.underline}. Schmitt (cited in Petito,
2007: 109) presumes that the Cold War was decisive in this sense, for
its "victor \[was doomed to become\] the world's sole sovereign".
Returning to Wendt's (2003) idea of a "world state", the [price of world
peace is the elimination of the international as space where it is still
possible to resist the totality of one order]{.underline} (Prozorov,
2006: 88). With the beginning of Putin's presidency, the emphasis on the
drecovery of pluralism within the international system has settled deep
into Russia's foreign policy agenda (Snetkov and Lanteigne, 2015).
[Putin]{.underline} (2007) [has criticized the global liberal governance
for being "a world of one master, one sovereign]{.underline}".
Consequently, the [modern international order is not the result of the
democratic will of the people, but of a club-like conglomerate of
liberal states.]{.underline} Thus, Russia depicts itself to be a
courageous bastion against the imperialist tendencies of Western
liberalism, especially its humanitarian militarism, political
unilateralism and undermining of state sovereignty. It aims to undermine
the dominance of the Western liberalism chaired by the United States by
transforming the "unipolar" international order into a "multipolar" one
(Ibid.). According to one of the most well-known radical right
theoreticians in Russia, Alexandr Dugin (cited in Laruelle, 2016: 8),
Russia's global mission lies in "the incarnation of the quest for a
historical alternative to Atlanticism". The Russian case shows that
resistance is concomitant to the de-politicization and neutralization of
the international order, calling for an even stronger suppression of
difference. As Prozorov (2006: 90) explains, [resistance is inevitable,
"as the Other is certain to resist its violent inclusion into the
homeland of liberal humanity"]{.underline}. To maintain its absolute
authority, [global governance decides to "push the discrimination of the
opponent into the abyss" by abusing the universality of liberal
principles]{.underline} (Schmitt: 321). Schmitt (\[1963\] 2004)
continues his analysis in Theory of the Partisan, stating that the
opponents of the global hegemony of liberalism become seen as inhuman, a
nonvalue. They are not recognized as an enemy, but are transformed into
"a disturber of peace" and thereby "an outlaw of humanity" (Schmitt:
79). The [conflation of politics with morality portrays the political
enemies of Western liberalism as morally corrupt "criminals", calling
for the global police intervention]{.underline} (Bessant, 2015: 335).
[War is no longer a legitimate act of state sovereignty to openly
promote its interests, but a crime against humanity. Therefore, from the
perspective of global governance, Russia's dissidence is merely a sign
of a neo-imperialist state desiring more power. Its strength and unity
are condemned; its weakness is praised. Accordingly, the main problem
with Russia is that it has failed to borrow liberal values and become a
"normal" state]{.underline} (Luzhkov, 2003: 156). In fact, [Russia
appears as "a mythical monster", which "every time it lies down on the
ground and appears finally defeated, it rises to power
again]{.underline}" (Herpen, 2014: 15). [It is a monster
because]{.underline}, as Shevtsova (2014: 74) claims, "[instead of
trying to join Western civilization, Russia is now striving to become
its antithesis". It necessarily needs to be turned into a liberal
democracy and embrace the technocratic governance in the name of an
external legitimizing authority. If, despite the recommendations of
global police, its resistance continues, it will no longer be a form of
dissent, but a criminal act. The more total global policing becomes, the
higher is the chance for the most extreme violence against the opponents
of the post-political international order. By claiming universal
validity, global liberal governance does not become "the opposite of
force, but a force that outlaws opposition]{.underline}" (Rasch,
2000:10). [The struggle for the highest values creates "ever newer, ever
deeper discriminations, criminalisations, and devaluations, until all
non-valuable life has been destroyed]{.underline}" (Schmitt: 94). As put
by Galli and Fay (2010: 6), the [notion of universalism "is
discriminatory in and of itself, as it tends to read exception as error,
injustice, immorality, or as the disturbance of unity that has no right
to existence and must, therefore, be removed"]{.underline}. Schmitt
(\[1929\] 2007a: 95) describes this dynamic by saying that "[the most
terrible war is pursued in the name of peace, \[and\] the most terrible
oppression is pursued in the name of freedom]{.underline}". Nonetheless,
even extreme eradication of opposition does not mean that resistance
disappears, but that it is kept "on hold" or finds a different
expression. All states are bearers of different ways of life, which
cannot be reconciled simply by uniting them in a unipolar world order.
According to Schmitt (Ibid.: 90), even "in the new domain, at first
considered neutral, the antitheses of men and interests will unfold with
a new intensity and become increasingly sharper". Despite being built on
the principles of neutrality and objectivity, the [new international
community is likely to "become immediately another arena of
struggle]{.underline}" (Ibid.). As Mouffe (2000: 5) explains, the excess
of consensus prevents conflict from channelling and causes it to become
necessarily "agonistic". Globalization is likely to cause resistance to
arise with a new, unprecedented force. However, the [radical unity of
the world now means that conflict can no longer be contained behind the
state borders]{.underline}. "The old gods rise from their graves and
fight their old battles" right at the centre of the liberal community
(Schmitt). In short, there is a [danger of state dissidence transforming
into radical resistance against liberal governance]{.underline}.

### [Saudi]{.underline}

#### The aff means of reducing arms sales to Saudi is a strategic interest in the name of human rights protection justified by the subordination of all states to sustain the US empire as a global hegemon in the international institution

**Gowan 2000** (gowan, peter. THE NEW LIBERAL COSMOPOLITANISM .
Retrieved from
http://www.geocities.ws/gennarolasca/liberalcosmopolitanism.pdf)

**[No less striking is the fact that in relation to some states which
are evidently pivotal to US strategic interests, there can be a marked
lack of concern to exert pressure for strong human rights protection, on
the part of the US.]{.underline}** **[Examples that are often cited are
Saudi Arabia]{.underline}** [**and the Gulf** States, Turkey, Israeli
activity in the occupied territories, Indonesia under
Suharto,]{.underline} etc. 3. Supra-state Global Governance or
Unipolarity? **[Any form of liberal cosmopolitan project for a new
global order must require the subordination of all states to some form
of supra-state planetary authority]{.underline}**. [The NLC blind-spot
about the role of the United States in the Pacific Union is compounded
by its misconception of relationship between the United States and the
various global governance regimes that are in place or being
canvassed**. There is no evidence that these institutions of global
governance have strengthened their jurisdiction over the dominant power
in the international system, the United States**]{.underline}. If
anything, the evidence of the 1990s suggests a trend towards these
organisations being able to function effectively only insofar as [they
correspond to the perceived policy priorities of the United States or at
least do not contradict or undermine American policy strategies. Indeed,
in many cases these regimes and multilateral organisations should rather
be viewed as instruments of US policy**. In the case of the UN, NLC
advocates can and do suggest that its weakening during the 1990s is
transitional, while the UN and its recalcitrant members gradually adapt
to the new liberal cosmopolitan norm**s]{.underline}. [But they must at
least acknowledge very powerful political resistance within the US to
any moves that may result in UN authority in any way infringing the
sovereignty and freedom of international action of the United
States.]{.underline} And this insistence an preserving absolute state
rights for the United States cannot be put down to long-standing
residues of prejudice against the UN. It has been evident in the stout
US resistance to the project, supported by all other members of the
Pacific Union, of establishing an international court of Human Rights
with full independence and binding jurisdiction over the internal
practices of states. **[This project would surely have been eagerly
embraced by a state which had become predominantly a vehicle for a
liberal international citizens' movement for liberal human rights. This
pattern has been repeated in relation to the major institutional
development in the field of Global Governance in the 1990s: the
emergence of the WTO. The US Congress's ratification of the WTO Treaty
explicitly makes US acceptance of its jurisdiction conditional upon the
WTO's being 'fair' to US interests.]{.underline}** And all who follow
international trade policy Peter Gowan 16 The New Liberal
Cosmopolitanism know that the word 'fair' in this context means serving
and defending US economic interests. And for successive US
administrations since the late 1980s this conditional general stance
towards the GATT/WTO has been combined in US trade policy, with explicit
determination to flout GATT/WTO rules where these are deemed 'unfair' to
US interests, an approach which Jagdish Bagwati has aptly called
'[aggressive unilateralism'. Bagwati highlights the creation and use of
the so-called Super 301 and Special 301 laws, but to these could be
added other instruments of US unilateralism on international economic
law, such as its use of antidumping]{.underline} instruments and
countervailing duties. All these instruments have been placed in the
service of US claims to have unilateral national authority to judge
which kinds of behaviour by other states in economic policy are 'unfair'
to the US, regardless of what rules are laid down within the GATT/WTO
framework. And the use of these instruments has been far from marginal
in US international economic policy. As Miles Kahler points out, "the
number of actions brought against 'unfair' trading practices --
anti-dumping, countervailing duties (subsidies) and section 301 --
increased dramatically" during the 1990s.24 In the words of Pietro
Nivola, "no other economic regulatory programme took on such an increase
in case-loads".25 **[And this refusal to be bound by cosmopolitan
economic law and to have been combined with vigorous attempts in some
fields to extend the jurisdictional reach of US domestic economic laws
internationally, applying it to non-American corporations operating
outside the United States.]{.underline}** Of actions in this field,
Kahler reports that "Here the list was long".26 In other important areas
of global governance of the world economy, such as finance and
international monetary relations, few would dispute the great
preponderance of the US government over institutional policy-making in
such bodies as the IMF and the World Bank. The readiness of the US
Treasury to openly assert its unilateralism and its use of the IMF as
its instrument has been a striking feature of the 1990s, as the 1995
Mexican Crisis and the East Asian financial crisis of 1997-98
graphically demonstrated.27.

### Taiwan

#### US means of reducing arms sales precedents endless military intervention as justification for sustaining democracy and globalized human rights 

**Wang 96 (**Wang , V. W.- C. Rethinking US-Taiwan Relations after the
Cold War: Creative Ambiguity vs. Assertive Democratization.)

Not infrequently these two sets of goals have seemed mutually
contradictory. For example, the August 17, 1982 Communique states: \"The
United States Government . [. . intends to reduce gradually its sales of
arms to Taiwan, leading over a period of time to a final
resolution.\"]{.underline} [While the P.R.C. understood this to mean
that the U.S. would gradually reduce, and eventually stop, arms sales to
Taiwan, the U.S. insisted that reduced U.S. arms sales to Taiwan would
be predicated upon the Chinese \"fundamental policy\" to strive for a
peaceful solution to the Taiwan question]{.underline}. When it comes to
U.S. commitment to Taiwan\'s security, the U.S. policy is also ambiguous
yet flexible. For example, Section 2 of the Taiwan Relations Act states
that it is the policy of the U.S. to \"consider any effort to determine
the future of Taiwan by other than peaceful means, including by boycotts
or embargoes, a threat to the peace and security of the Western Pacific
and of grave concern to the U.S.\" However, the U.S. commitment stops
short of a carte blanche to Taiwan. The same section only calls for the
U.S. \"to maintain the capacity . .. to resist any resort to force or
other forms of coercion that would jeopardize the security, or the
social or economic system, of the people on Taiwan**[.\" For years this
declaration has kept both Beijing and Taiwan wondering if the U.S. would
militarily intervene at all in the event of a P.R.C. attack against
Taiwan. Part of the suspense was cleared by the Clinton
Administration\'s decision to dispatch two aircraft carrier battle
groups to the Taiwan waters in March 1996 in 163 response to the
P.R.C.\'s military intimidation against Taiwan before the island\'s
first direct popular presidential elections]{.underline}**. In sum, this
policy essentially has postponed a fundamental and tough policy choice
between the P.R.C. and Taiwan. It arguably has achieved some success.
Those who were involved in the policy-making itself like to claim credit
for a policy that they **[claim has allowed the U.S. to establish
diplomatic ties with an important country on the world stage, and at the
same time safeguarded the security of a U.S. traditional
ally.]{.underline}**22 However, the balance between the two tracks,
U.S.-P.R.C. and U.S.-Taiwan relations, which this policy has so
painstakingly tried to maintain, as one writer puts, \"is becoming
increasingly difficult to maintain, or even to define with a high degree
of consensus.\" As a result, \"the modalities of U.S. policy toward
Taiwan are becoming outdated and dysfunctional in some instances.\"[23
The sources for this growing incongruity have to do with developments
within Taiwan, China, and the U.S.]{.underline} New developments in
Taiwan are especially important. 22 For example, Kent Wiedemann, Deputy
Assistant Secretary of State for East Asian and Pacific Affairs, in a
congressional hearing, self-congratulated that \"This \'one China\'
policy has worked exceptionally well, and has enabled the U.S. to
achieve progress toward all of U.S. objectives.\" **[He listed these
objectives as peace and stability in the Taiwan Strait area,
constructive engagement with China, continuation of strong economic and
cultural relations with the people of Taiwan, a]{.underline}**nd
peaceful resolution of the Taiwan issue by the Chinese themselves, which
he argued all the six administrations since 1972 have shared. H. Con.

Factors Shaping a New U.S. Policy Toward Taiwan Four sets of factors
provide the sources for significant or even fundamental adjustments of
U.S. policy toward Taiwan. **[The first set is developments in Taiwan.
Three factors are especially relevant: democratization, greater
international recognition, and institutionalized cross-strait ties.
Democratiza\~ tion has created a separate identity for
Taiwan.]{.underline}** It also shows that a consensus on Taiwan\'s
future does not yet exist among\' the people of Taiwan themselves. Such
consensus may, or may not, **[support unification with the
mainland.]{.underline}** In practice, the, notion of self-determination
for Taiwan can manifest itself at three levels: (1) direct and popular
election of top leaders, (2) plebiscite, and (3) a formal declaration of
independence. The first expression was realized in the March 1996
presidential elections. The results from this election mean that a
majority of Taiwanese voters reject China\'s sovereignty claim.24 They
also mean that Lee Teng-hui has the mandate to set the stage for the
second and third expressions, or accommodation with China. The assertion
in the Shanghai Communique that the Chinese on both sides of the Taiwan
Strait think that there is only one China, of which Taiwan is part, is
increasingly doubtful. [Indeed, in 1991 President Lee abrogated the
so-called Temporary Provisions (During the Period of Mobilization and
Suppression of Rebellion), thereby effectively treating the PRC as a
government (political entity) of China. This move was a tacit yet
unambiguous abandonment of the \"one-China\" policy]{.underline}.
Further, what if Chinese on one side of the Taiwan Strait (i.e., the
people on Taiwan**[), through free choice, declare de jure independence?
Should the U.S. accept this democraHc 24 In a four-way race, the
pro-status quo incumbent]{.underline}**, Lee Teng-hui, got 54 percent of
the votes; the pro-independence Peng Ming-Min 21 percent, the allegedly
pro-unification Lin Yang-kang 15 percent, and Chen Li-an 10 percent.
China took solace in that the two pro-unification candidates combined to
get more votes than the pro-independence Peng (25 percent vs. 21
percent). But actually anti-China votes amounted to 75 percent,
including Lee\'s. China\'s saber-rattling clearly backfired. New York
Times, March 24, 1996, pp. 1, 4, 14. 165 result and change its policy
toward Taiwan accordingly? Or should it continue to cling on a \"one
China\" policy that seemed diplomatically expedient for the U.S.?
[Democratization also leads to a call for greater international
recognition, which has the effect of internationalizing the Taiwan
issue. If the Taiwan issue is really a domestic issue, as China has
always claimed, then the principle of non-interference in internal
affairs would preclude any third country, including the U.S., to come to
Taiwan\'s aid in the event of a P.R. C. attack. **However, if the Taiwan
issue is an international one, then the principles of
self-determination, humanitarian intervention, and other U.N. actions
apply.2**]{.underline}5 In this context, it is easy to understand why
the people of Taiwan want a seat in the U.N. It is a natural extension
of their democratization process and it also has important security
ramifications. The U.S. actions in the Taiwan Strait in 1996 suggest
that Taiwan\'s future is far from being China\'s internal affairs alone.

#### One China DA turns the very form of all their perm arguments -- the symbolic representation of a new One China via violent assimilation of Taiwan is undergirded by a militant strategy that positions Taiwan out of Asia into the Western project of liberal globalization, erasing its political history. Affective and mythical dimensions that evoke images of Taiwanese aggression and irrationality are new discursive measures that force Taiwan into the project of 'becoming us'.

I have argued that [Taiwan\'s contentious past is strong enough that
it]{.underline} con- Ceptually [leads to a kind Of ahistorical
situation, where this]{.underline} contention [could dislodge Western
metanarratives]{.underline}. This is a case where [Taiwan is not
historiciz- able without acknowledging the rivalrous politics of
representation and resis- tance, which includes origin notions as well
as senses of discontinuity]{.underline}. Now I wish to shift to the
sense of Taiwan in a segment of the American media, here Los Angeles
Times editorials. My purpose in moving to the editor- ial is to show how
these editorials do not lead to a grasp of Taiwan as a com- plicated
place, or dehistoricize it. [This involves a discursive prose economy Of
restriction, which favors the mainland narrative of Taiwan\'s return,
which for Americans is the easy way out of confronting our own hegemonic
interests]{.underline}. In short, [representation for purposes Of
persuasion]{.underline}, as Old as rhetoric (i.e., poli- tics) itself,
[has become an Asia-for-Americans,]{.underline} where journalists as
well con- nected as Edgar Snow and scholars as well established as John
Fairbanks have made representations that saturate American readers in
narrativized, prosaic 32 The latter is a persistent prose form. Despite
some outstanding reporting and event analysis on Asia by some Los
Angeles Times writers[,\" construction of ideas and images of Taiwan
through the more directed editorial page remains a paramount instance of
misfiguration]{.underline}. [The editorial mode is]{.underline} an
everyday prose text that makes [a mental image or concept Of action and
relationship]{.underline}. The usual editorial is close to a mode of
persuasion and dissuasion when it brings current theories and politics
to pub- lic discourse, giving prosaic figuration. [For
example,]{.underline} there have been, nation- ally, hundreds Of
editorial columns using the phrase \"[Asian miracle]{.underline},\" [a
phrase that embeds Asian financial and cultural life in Western notions
of economics]{.underline}, [threaded to uncontested notions Of growth
and \"take-off,\" conjuring senses Of development, Asia simplified and
corresponding to the type, Asians R Us.]{.underline} While an exhibit by
a Taipei artist depicting Asian icons with Western pornog- raphy
\"growing onto\" sacred Asian sensibilities requires its own terms, once
described for an American audience as \"bold\" and \"audacious,\" it
acquires the historicizing functions of \"the first show that did
that,\" which feeds various senses that are potential misfigurations.
Further, my reading of the Los Angeles Times editorials on Taiwan
borrows from the conceptual framework of Tzvetan Todorov\'s The Morals
of History (1995), a book that takes great pains to set forth categories
Of figuring forth others in modern Western writing. Let me discuss
Todorov\'s book as a con- ceptual point Of entry to my \"local\" reading
of the Times. In surveying the his- tory of wordedness or interpretative
and ideological relations between Spanish conquerors and what they did
to Indian texts, using commentaries by oppo- nents of the conquest such
as Las Casas or apologists like Sepulveda, Todorov argues that [Western
assimilation smuggles in the premise of its own superior- ity;
for]{.underline} instance, [the rule of law is said to show our advanced
development de- spite the political violence of Western
history]{.underline}.34 [The West claims superiority as it tries to
avoid tagging others as inferior. **No one wants to admit to superior-
ism**]{.underline}, Todorov continues, **[so we privilege
dialogism]{.underline}**, to \"read myself in quota- tion marks,\" Often
favored when referring to Others.\" [Our affective feelings]{.underline}
for others, [say admiration for \"Asian loyalty]{.underline},\" [often
accompanies nonknowl- edge,]{.underline} as in the case of Montaigne\'s
regret for the slaughter Of the Aztecs, [which was based on a Western
failure to live up to its own ideals]{.underline}, not on the intrin-
sic worth of Aztec life. Of course emphasis upon a culture or
civilization\'s in- ternal articulation of differences---their make it
impossible to understand them at all. [In Todorov\'s notion of Western
wordedness, truth and misfiguration are al- ways
co-present]{.underline}. In addition to risks of superiorism, historical
writing presup- poses truth-disclosure, an intersubjective truth, not a
referential one. When is- sues of fact are unsettled, we expect a
\"depth of penetration\" to provide a collective interpretation that
spans group interests, serving as the basis for fur- ther discussions.
[This kind of truth aims at \"adherence among readers.\"]{.underline}
Here things get sticky. For with intersubjective interpretations, we are
interested not so much in adequacy of discourse to referent, but in
reaching agreement. Ad- herence is often at Odds with truth-adequation,
with its epistemic atomism Or regression to the facts, but insistence
that some facts cannot be explained away. How does one get from
\"facts\" to an inclusive discourse that actually absorbs each fact\'s
adequacy without distortion? Of all the facts, including those about
processes, available about Asian economies since 1970, how did the
phrase \"Asian miracle\" arise? Further, depth interpretations,
requiring adherence, giv- ing intersubjective connections, can be
coherent in one way, but can render a larger incoherence in relation to
another interpretation. [A coherent interpre- tation is bound to be
reductive just because it smoothes and resolves contention]{.underline}.
In sum, [in]{.underline} those [areas]{.underline} [ruled by
intersubjectivity---politics, culture, morality, aesthetics, and
language---truth as adequation and truth as disclo- sure opens onto the
consequence that coherence is not very intellectually stim-
ulating]{.underline}; [the possible incoherence is
stimulating]{.underline}. Try as he may, Montaigne\'s denunciation of
Eurocentrism in the name Of equality also gave Eurocentrism a lease on
life once Europeans used the ideal of equality, its irresistible coher-
ence, to oppress Africans, among others, in the nineteenth century.36
Another way Of putting Todorov\'s construal of history and misfiguration
is just to emphasize that representation and resistance can collide in
any public claim to mediate [representation]{.underline}. Public
newspapers such as the Los Angeles Times [can be used to intensify, slow
down, speed up, displace, etc. what \"counts\"]{.underline} as news,
namely, [decisions by governing bodies]{.underline}; in another
register, this means that one is al\'.vays caught up in privileging
certain mediating roles, such as those Of cultural guide, or political
prophet, or existential naysayer, or the wis- dom of the businessman.
This also occurs in Taiwanese life. For example, in July 1998 a
conference was held in Taiwan at Tsing-Hua University, with the title
\"Problematizing Asia. \" The conference continued lines of thought
opened by cultural (mainly British) and postcolonial studies. In the
announcement of the conference, via e-mail, the chief organizer said
that a gathering is necessary because of the coming into dominance of
the phrase \"rise of Asia\" (dated from the mid-1980s), specifically the
fact that [Asia was again an obsession of the West. Calling for an
\"intervention\" so as to \"fill the gap\" in what the various Western
and Asian discursive regimes have neglected]{.underline}, the
\"Problematizing Asia\" conference asked questions so broad that their
sheer scale dominated as rhetorical form. Citing \"local, national,
regional, international and global lev- els,\" the organizer asked,
\"How do we place \'Taiwan\' in these contexts?\" Here, a progressive
group\'s immediate worry was over Taiwanese nationalism---pro-
aboriginal/proindependence for Taiwan---a worry that seems to have
England at the time of Thatcher\'s ascendancy in mind, where right-wing
nationalism was revived, adding to the difficulties Of establishing a
new critical left. But should response to Thatcherist nationalism serve
as a model for Taiwanese in- tellectual resistance to Taiwanese
nationalism? One Can certainly see what is at stake when it comes to
concepts and im- ages of Asia in the editorial page of the Los Angeles
Times. As said above, there is more writing by the Times on Asia than
the editorials. Apart from headline stories, Jim Mann\'s \"international
outlook\" regularly gave a deep sense of the historical and temporal
issues involved. The business section reports on the fi- nancial
turmoil, from a persistently dreadful perspective of Asia as a place of
lower costs and infinite needs. I am going to restrict my comments to
the ed- itorials written by Tom Plate, who in the period under
discussion wrote all Of the editorials for the Times, whose byline
listed teaching in UCLA\'s commu- nication and policy studies program,
and who heads an Asia Institute at UCLA, an organization of schools and
corporate sponsors that promotes glo- balization in its \"moderate\"
form. The editorials discussed are an active attempt by the Times to
shape public opinion, the editorial itself timed to Asian \"events\" so
as to be more immedi- ate in its impact. Editorial practice often serves
to anticipate the possibilities Of a future event and because Of this
quality, its timing connects immediate and structural forces at once. An
editorial, in short, is one Of the forms in which readers do not grapple
with problems so much as receive interest and motivation, immediate
impressions, even if they are canceled the next day by another
editorial. They are more or less consistent tapes of guidance for the
uninitiated. [These impressions naturalize the political and
intellectual, giving it the form of the unquestionable]{.underline} (the
\"real\" right now). [An editorial aims not so much at instruction as at
guidance]{.underline}---[shaping consensus for tomorrow\'s conflicts,
defusing the contentiousness Of Other perspectives, leading its read-
ers to the necessity of what tomorrow is to look like. It is all about
the making of coherence.]{.underline} Let us start then with an
editorial from August 1997. Plate writes that the \"Pacific Rim
community\" is a real entity, required not just by the historical moment
of a \"Rise of Asia\" nor by trade concerns, but by the need for a
\"brain-trust\" of the \"best universities\" in the United States, Asia,
and Latin America. The president ofUSC is cited, for whom \"LA. is the
Rome of the (Pacific) Rim,\" a community of the best universities that
are \"brand names\" in Asia, where \"a U.S. degree is worn like a badge
of honor. \"38 There is said to be a \"bond\" between Pacific Rim
universities, a \"sunny optimism\" underlying their \"common
challenges\" concerning economic development, this positive model set
against a right wing in California protesting China\'s rent of docks at
Long Beach. There are Asians \"like us\" and there are Americans stuck
in Mc- Carthyism. In a few sentences the prose frees the West\'s global
community from opposition to it. In the same sentence, Los Angeles,
Tokyo, and Singa- pore are said to have replaced New York, Paris, and
Rome as world centers, but this is put hysterically: \"the university
group aspires to be this new com- munity\'s on-call brain cell, \" where
\"on-call\" privileges economic managers, fi- nancial traders, dealers
Of all sorts, including those involved in the circulation Of symbol,
sign, image. None Of this talk of corporate and university \"brain-
trusts\" is connected to such past practices as what happened with U .S.
profes- sors advising, say, the Chilean military and business interests.
In August of 1997, the column \"On Taiwan, Beijing Learns to Yawn\" com-
pliments Beijing over an impending visit from the president of Taiwan, a
one- night touchdown on U.S. soil (Hawaii). Beijing\'s not going berserk
is made a sign of its \"maturity\" and is opposed to the \"latest,
potentially trouble making\" move by Taiwan. The \"maturity\" Of 1997
corrects Beijing\'s being \'Sultratouchy\" in 1996, when it lobbed
missiles close to Taiwan. Beijing has earned the right to be touchy
because \"[Beijing]{.underline}, as well as a lot Of Chinese (and more
than a few people inside Taiwan) [regard Taiwan as an integral part Of
historic China]{.underline}.\" Rather than define \"integral\" and
\"historic,\" words with a large range Of PO- tential misfiguration,
[the article images Taiwan as provoking China, by having a \"perceived
campaign of clever resistance to the process of eventual reunifica-
tion]{.underline}.\" [\"Clever\" goes with \"trouble making,\" **giving
those Taiwanese the qual- icy \"aggressive, \"** while \"maturity\"
**and** \"touchy\" gives the mainland government the quality Of
\"**provoked**.\"]{.underline} This is the coherence of which Todorov
speaks--- [the Taiwanese are given a totalizing, overly coherent,
interpretation, in the negative]{.underline}. The next phrase reads:
\"In fact, [the diplomatic reality is that tiny but economically
over-achieving Taiwan is formally recognized as an independent
government by only 30 countries]{.underline}, one of which is Panama,
and not by either the U.N. or the U.S. But [its feisty government and
newfound democratic ways combine to create the effect of an independent
state, which stations an army of loyalists and lobbyists in
America]{.underline}.\"39 Let us name each of the pejora- tives ladled
over Taiwan, or the use of coherent history to delegitimize.
\"[Diplomatic reality]{.underline}\" [refers to
governmental]{.underline} and U.N. [acceptance of mainland Chinese
claims over Taiwan.]{.underline} This Omits the U.N. decision Of 1952
that affirmed self-determination as a principle for nonstates. \"Tiny\"
reduces and \"over-achieving\" goes with \"tiny\" to form the image Of
an aggressive group, with the insult or curse that Panama, alone Of the
thirty supporting govern- ments mentioned, recognizes Taiwan. [If Taiwan
is supported by Panama, then Taiwan must be eccentric or worse,
insignificant except as a problem.]{.underline} \"Feisty\" could be a
nod to something affirmative about Taiwan, but \"[newfound
democracy]{.underline}\" [undercuts]{.underline} that, depriving
[Taiwan\'s government of legitimacy, as if there is something suspect
about Taiwanese democracy**. Taiwan only looks like a country, but is
not one really. The reduction is \"confirmed\" by the rhetoric Of
militancy: \"stations\" an \"army\" in this country raises the ugly
specter of Tai- wan buying its legitimacy**]{.underline}. **[The
Taiwanese are construed as illegitimately ag- gressiv]{.underline}**e,
hence closer to Libya than to mainland China\'s claim Of historic
rights. In a single editorial, the historiographics of complexity are
ruined. It is the U.S. Congress that listens to Taiwan because Of
campaign contributions etc., but the State Department and presidency
are, one hopes, smarter about the long-term interests of that PacRim
community whose brain is \"on-line\" or \"on-call.\" [Rhetoric has eaten
into any semblance of objectivity, devoured it.]{.underline} In
Todorov\'s terms, [this]{.underline} specific editorial
[repeats]{.underline} Sepulveda\'s mode Of [superior- ism]{.underline},
[rhetoric blocking any sense here that Taiwan has grounds to resist
either China or America acting in China\'s interests]{.underline}-40
[Taiwan is removed from the Asia called for to participate in
Westerniza- tion/globalization]{.underline}. The Taiwanese should not
derail the United States\' ability \"to work both sides Of the Taiwan
strait. The [Taiwanese should be deprived Of \"leverage\" that would
\"imperil Sino-U.S. relations.\"]{.underline} In effect, the prose is-
sues warnings: if left to their own devices, the Taiwanese will
\"sabotage\" the fu- ture, an ominous throwback to the visual imagery of
the stealthy Asian spy out of anti-Japanese propaganda films of World
War Il. In another editorial, [Asians are cited to remind us of our own
better selves, readers getting ideals from unobjectionable \"others,\"
but subject to negative images]{.underline}---Taiwan is close,
negatively, to Malaysia, the prime minister of Malaysia is called
\"bush- league\" for distinguishing between foreign capital and foreign
rogue capital (i.e., currency speculators like George Soros).41 The
\"PacRim community\" would newer have allowed Indonesia\'s disastrous
forest fires to occur, for this group would have installed \"Asian
regionalization\" or Western-style crisis management. Westerners need to
pay attention to \"face,\" no perspective al- lowed but from those
Asians who are like us. The mayor Of Shanghai, Xu Kuangdi, is quoted as
saying, \"We like Americans \... (they are) easy to read and we Chinese
appreciate that,\" this in the context of Xu\'s identification with Rudy
Giuliani in New York or Richard Riordan in Los Angeles. Xu wants to
build Shanghai according to the logic of an American film: \"if we build
it, they will come.\" Who is quoting whom and what in this hallucination
Of identi- ties? [A Western image exported to an Asian leader just like
us returns as he is made to say what we approve of]{.underline}; [the
sense here, regular fare of the editorial, its antiproduction of
questions and problems, preserves Westernization as it turns Taiwan and
other places \"into history\" or out of the future.]{.underline} The
\"on-call brain cell\" of the PacRim community is mobilized in an edi-
torial of May 1998 and set against East Coast newspaper columnists who
op- pose Clinton\'s appearance at \*fiananmen Square in June Of 1998.
Plate Calls his rival East Coast journalists \"potentates,\"
orientalized in the negative, and who have no sense, he says,
ofTiananmen apart from June Of 1989; they should un- derstand that
Chinese leaders ceremonialize with all foreign dignitaries in Tiananmen,
so that its \"historical\" force, as opposed to its \"historic\"
associa- tion with the murder Of workers and students, is misunderstood
by critics. Clinton should not miss the opportunity to 100k \"like a
champ\" at Tianan- men, just as the Chinese leaders should not reject
\"a fabulous opportunity to look great.\" (Is all this Pop writing about

Even fright is proposed to the Times\' audience: \"are we really ready

Immediately after the election of the DPP candidate, a column took up
China\'s \"White Paper\" on Taiwan, released just before the March 2000
elec- tions. Here the party reaffirmed the 1949 One China principle,
which was re- ally, as noted above, a principle shared with the
Kuomintang insofar as they trace their genealogy to Sun Yat-sen\'s
reforms and the Republic of China of 1911. Why not discuss 1911? Citing
mainland Vice Premier Qian Qichen, the \"White Paper\" is affirmed as
the \"time-honored Chinese way of saying that Only the full course Of
history can correct an injustice built up over the course Of time. \"46
That is, [China\'s continuous historical claims to Taiwan are presented
as fact. The question of Taiwan\'s independence is nothing more, now,
than a \"negotiating point.\"]{.underline} In an editorial four days
after the defeat Of the KMT in Taiwan, the negative marker \"tiny
island\" returns, this time not to affirm Tai- wanese sovereignty, but
only as an end to the KMT \"behemoth\": the Taiwan political
transformation is not about independence, only the Taiwan middle class
pushed the DPP into office; the election was really about
\"corruption,\" the voters said to be concerned with globalization (
anticronyism), not pol- itics.47 [The discourse keeps on track the
affirmation of China as embodying historical continuity, this via the
motherland unity argument, a delegitimation Of the autonomy Of politics
on Taiwan. Globalization here is used as a lever of antilocal
politics]{.underline}.\" America should have a \"Goldilocks\" attitude
toward China: a \"just right\" attitude of balance, which nonetheless is
based on accep- tance of Beijing\'s demand that Taiwan is a
\"disrespectful, wayward son that must---somehow---be returned to the
family fold.\" 49 [Taiwan has been Oedipalized]{.underline} (the time
span Of the editorials roughly correlating with the time it takes to
manifest Oedipus in children). Citing yet another well-placed
\"source,\" a \"contact\" at the Rand Corporation, readers are told that
Americans must try to make sure that China is not placed in the vise
where they will in- vade Taiwan \"if they have no choice,\" i.e.,
Taiwan\'s political life must be de- politicized. Hence [American
foreign policy must \"avoid strategic intimacy\" with
Taiwan,]{.underline} or Congress must foreswear any \"formal alliance\"
with Taiwan. As before, Taiwan must not be treated as sovereign. In
fact, the American pub- lic must listen to our \"wise\" and enlightened
think-tank corporate \"players\" for whom the \"third way\" toward China
relations (here reduced to hawk/dove, containment/engagement) is
acongagement,\" or \"a little Of this, a little of that; lean a little
left, then to the right,\" this to pursue the inexorable aims Of glob-
alizati0n.50 Thus China\'s \"leftist purists\" who criticize Premier Zhu
Rongji for rushi or \"entry to the world\" (510balizationP and American
conservatives or liberal-unionists should both get out of the way. So
too must Taiwanese inde- pendence groups.\" [All this lopsided
\"coherence\" has the effect of making Taiwan disappear. Its history of
continuous discontinuity with invaders of all sorts is removed from
present discourse]{.underline}. That the KMT\'s fifty-year domination
might now dissolve, be made into something else, is unthinkable, i.e.,
that the island\'s self-sorting out can be achieved in its own
[register. Taiwan remains pre-historical, and not out of
choice.]{.underline} The editorial that calls Clinton and Zemin\'s
meeting \"historic\" also de- clares, \"[A new order is descending on
Asia.]{.underline} This is no historical accident.\" Thus, Jiang Zemin
and Zhu Rongji are not \"parochial \";52 one should be glee- ful over
Clinton\'s rejection in Beijing of independence for Taiwan (communism in
China and neoconservative-liberalism in America locked into No Clauses);
then a rhetorical question: whether Taiwan \"suddenly finds itself On
the wrong side of history. With but 21 million people (tiny, again) the
offshore island is a democracy that will never be a superpower or
threaten anyone militarily.\"53 The \"wrong side of history\" is a
phrase of pure terror---extreme disidentifica- tion with Taiwan\'s
actual political transformation in March 2000. Again, [the linkage to
China always makes Taiwan disappear into historiographic oblivion---
history used to denarrate. I call this a strong instance of historical
narration in the restrictive mode, disturbing because it gives its
readers the satisfactions of eliminating rival concepts and attending
social and political arrangements.]{.underline} In fact, these
editorials complete the dehistoricization of Taiwan: \"The United
Nations and the United States refuse to recognize Taiwan as an official
nation \... But even if you find no pathos at all in Taiwan\'s plight
\... the man- ner Of Beijing\'s resolution Of this grating rebuke (March
2000 elections) to mainland Communism will reveal much. \"54 [What
matters in this reduction Of conflict, in which \"historic\" and
\"historical\" and related terms are crucial stakes, is only how the
mainland is perceived by the West---China should avoid
violence]{.underline}. Those pesky and trouble-making Taiwanese should
listen to Clinton, who passes into the voice of speaking for the
Communist Party: \"his administration no longer wants the Taiwan tail to
wag the Sino-U .S. dog. Again: \"Clinton, like it or not Taiwan, has
forsworn U.S. support for formal Taiwanese independence.\" Perversely,
the elections Of 2000 are treated as if they were nothing but the KMT Of
1949. [**The editorials singled** out here testify to what Roland
Barthes called **myth**,]{.underline} [the editorial form conducive to a
particular mode Of mythmaking, realized in proverbial type utterances,

refusal Of any explanation, an unalterable hierarchy Of the
world.]{.underline} \"55 [They are prose-myth where the narrative
dimension has become a premise: restriction of history.]{.underline}
Todorov\'s concerns about the ideological effects of rigid coherence
seem confirmed by the editorials. [The complex historicity of Taiwan and
its conflicts with others do not transfer into productive repre-
sentation for its readers because Westernization---globalization---makes
focus on such local conflicts only instances Of further pragmatic
solutions]{.underline}. \"[One China, two systems\" is such a pragmatic
or Western mode Of coming to terms with conflicted
narratives/histories]{.underline}. In addition, the editorials belong to
prose, myth, and don the mask Of reflexive speech, [maxims that
\"overlay a world which is already made, bury the traces of this
production under a self-evident appearance \... the decorous equivalent
of a tautology]{.underline}.\" That is to say, the ed- itorials
discussed above never waver in their commitment to the rhetoric Of ex-
tending some existing facts on the ground, dubious as history, and as
such facts are attached and threaded to the institutions of this
university-based \"PacRim community,\" whose interests are confused with
the public, then it seems fair to ask how such misfiguration does not
convey pure politics, the politics of historical misrepresentation. The
editorials feel aimed at satisfying last readers, as discussed in
chapter I. Taiwan is an island at the edge Of continental Asia. [On
political and cul- tural grounds---regimes and resistances, involving
the use Of origins and narratives---there is not any plausible
historical argument for One China. **One China is a fiction. It is this
fiction that is now nearly impossible to speak to in** the midst of a
\"new class\" **discourse**, since one is immediately tagged as right
wing, antiprogressive, and antifuture if one objects to American
politics and multinational capitalism linked to Chinese]{.underline}
State-[Capitalism]{.underline}, among other things. But one can resist
the associations by suspending \"one story\" and shift- ing in thought
to the Taiwanese---the elections Of 2000 as a watershed in that it shows
Taiwan\'s difference in politics and historiography[. Imposed on Taiwan
is a \"burden Of history\" that prevents us from knowing
Taiwan]{.underline}---in Todorov\'s sense---[hence from knowing about a
specific force of]{.underline} dissidence, people not- like-us. In this
sense, [Westerners who venture to learn something of the pre- sent
conflicts between the United States, China, and Taiwan, might borrow an
idea from Jean Baudrillard, that Taiwan is not a matter of
finalities---but a \"so- ciety (that) is totally there at each
instant,]{.underline}\" 56 Which means: an affirma- tion of the island
Taiwan\'s resistance to history[. It should be unthinkable to make
Taiwan subject to the failures and power attacks of the Communist Party
of China, as America, even if by omission, **yokes Taiwan to the destiny

Following the annexation of Crimea[, concerns have sharpened in Eastern
Europe about Russia's possible future intentions]{.underline}. Poland,
the Czech Republic, and Hungary joined NATO in 1999, and Slovakia
followed in 2004. **[In addition to their membership in NATO and the EU,
these four countries cooperate on a range of regional issues and
interests as the Visegrád Group (V4).14 All four countries are generally
considered by U.S. officials to be strong NATO allies, and all four have
participated in the NATO-led mission in Afghanistan]{.underline}**. In
recent years, there have been some concerns in the United States and EU
about an apparent backsliding on democracy in Hungary, with 288 Paul
Belkin, Derek E. Mix and Steven Woehrel the recently reelected
government of Prime Minister Viktor Orbán demonstrating authoritarian
tendencies and moving toward closer relations with Russia. Geographical
proximity and long-standing historical relationships, including the
experience of Soviet domination during the Communist era, color
attitudes toward Russia in the V4 countries. Energy dependence is also
an important consideration in relations with Russia: about 59% of the
natural gas consumed in Poland, 80% in Hungary, 84% in Slovakia, and 57%
in the Czech Republic comes from Russia.15 In recent years, Russia has
been actively trying to extend its influence in the region through
energy deals and the acquisition of energy infrastructure. While
business usually centers on natural gas, Hungary also agreed to a deal
with [Russia's state nuclear company in early 2014 for the upgrade of a
Hungarian nuclear power plant, financed by a €10 billion (about \$13.7
billion) loan from Moscow. In late February 2014, the V4 foreign
ministers released a statement reiterating]{.underline} **[―their strong
interest in maintaining the sovereignty, independence, unity, and
territorial integrity of Ukraine\....‖16 While the government of Poland
has subsequently been at the forefront of arguments calling for a robust
response to Russia's actions, the governments of the other three
Visegrád countries, especially Hungary, have been more
reserved]{.underline}**. Despite possible reservations in those three
countries about additional economic sanctions, all V4 [members agreed to
the limited sanctions imposed thus far by the EU in response to the
annexation]{.underline}. The EU's common position is that the Crimea
referendum was illegal, and no EU member states recognize its outcome.17
Poland stands out among the V4 group as having the most difficult
relationship with Russia. Despite a mild thaw in the relationship after
the Polish president and nearly 100 high-level Polish officials were
killed in a 2010 airplane crash in Russia, Polish suspicions about the
nature of Putin's Russia have long persisted. Poland is by far the most
populous country, the largest economy, and the most significant military
actor of the V4.18 Like many European countries, Poland is in the midst
of a long-term transformation to a smaller, more capable, and more
deployable military. Despite budgetary pressures, Poland is pursuing a
broad equipment acquisition program linked to the need to phase out
remaining Soviet-era material. **[In an effort to upgrade its main
battle tanks and other armored vehicles, helicopters, air defenses,
drones, and individual soldier equipment, Poland has reportedly
significantly increased equipment expenditures.19 Poland has been a
leading allied participant in NATO's ―out of area‖ Afghanistan mission.
At the same time, given its enduring perception of NATO 289 Russia as a
threat, Poland has also been a leading voice in calls for NATO to focus
on its traditional vocation as an alliance of territorial defense.
I]{.underline}**n the wake of the Crimea annexation, Polish officials
have revived a long-standing wish to base U.S. forces on their
territory, calling for two NATO brigades (approximately 10,000 soldiers)
to be stationed in Poland as a security guarantee.20 The 12 U.S. F-16s
and 300 airmen deployed to Poland in March 2014 build on a small U.S.
aviation detachment that was established in Poland in 2012, which has
supported quarterly training rotations of 200 U.S. personnel operating
F-16s and C-130s. [Poland also participates in the U.S./NATO European
Phased Adaptive Approach missile defense system, intended to guard
against a possible Iranian missile threa]{.underline}t. Aegis-ashore
interceptors are scheduled to be deployed in Poland in 2018. The area
posing the most direct threat to Poland is Kaliningrad, a 5,800 square
mile Russian exclave wedged between Poland and Lithuania. Kaliningrad
has a heavy Russian military presence, including the Baltic Sea Fleet
and two airbases. In addition, Russia has reportedly stationed, or at
least threatened to station, Iskander short-range nuclear missiles
there.21 Compared to Poland, the militaries of the Czech Republic,
Hungary, and Slovakia are significantly smaller and possess more modest
capabilities. Each of the three countries also faces substantial
resource constraints and budget pressures: since 2008, the Czech
Republic has cut its defense spending by 16%, Slovakia by 22%, and
Hungary by 29%.22 Nevertheless, the Czech and Hungarian forces are
considered by military experts to be well-structured, well-equipped,
well-trained, highly capable for their size, and experienced from
**[participation in international deployments. Analysts observe that a
low defense budget presents the Slovak military with an especially
difficult challenge because it faces a need to replace a large
percentage of its ageing equipment. In recent years, the V4 countries
have sought to expand their cooperation from largely political matters
to include security and defense. T]{.underline}**he four generally
consult closely with one another in attempting to present a unified
**[regional stance within NATO and on issues related to the EU's Common
Security and Defense Policy (]{.underline}**CSDP). In 2013, the V4
countries launched plans to form an EU Battlegroup, a rapid reaction
force consisting of 2,500 to 3,000 troops, to be operational by 2016.
**[The V4 countries have also sought to increase military and industrial
cooperation in line with NATO's Smart Defense and the EU's Pooling and
Sharing initiative]{.underline}**. Current or prospective areas of such
cooperation include joint procurement of ammunition, armored vehicles,
individual soldier equipment, and battlefield imaging systems, as 290
Paul Belkin, Derek E. Mix and Steven Woehrel well as joint logistics
programs, and joint development of capabilities such as countering
improvised explosive devices (IED); chemical, biological, radiological,
and nuclear defense (CBRN); joint training of helicopter pilots and air
traffic controllers; and cyber defense

Westminster, held research positions at Harvard, Cornell, the University
of California, the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton, and the
Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique in Paris (Spring, Chantal,
The South Atlantic Quarterly, 104.2, "Schmitt's Vision of a Multipolar
World Orderf", WEA)

[Schmitt helps us]{.underline} to [realize]{.underline} that [it
is]{.underline} high [time to acknowledge the pluralist character of the
world and to relinquish the Eurocentric tenet that modernization can
take place only through Westernization. We should relinquish the
illusion that antagonisms could be eliminated by a unification of the
world]{.underline} transcending the political, conﬂict, and negativity.
[We must]{.underline} also [abandon the idea that the aim of politics is
to]{.underline} [establish consensus on one]{.underline} single [model.
The]{.underline} central [problem]{.underline} that [our]{.underline}
current unipolar [world is facing is that it is impossible for
antagonisms to find legitimate forms of expression. It is no wonder,
then, that those antagonisms, when they emerge, take extreme forms,
putting into question the very structure of the]{.underline} existing
[international order]{.underline}. In my view, [the lack of political
channels for challenging]{.underline} [the]{.underline} hegemony of the
neoliberal [model]{.underline} of globalization [fosters]{.underline}
discourses and practices of [radical negation]{.underline} of the
established order. [To create]{.underline} the channels for the
[legitimate expression of dissent, we need to envisage a pluralistic
world order constructed around]{.underline} a certain number of great
spaces and [genuine cultural poles]{.underline}.

The [new forms of terrorism reveal the dangers implied in the delusions
of the universalist]{.underline} globalist [discourse which postulates
that human progress requires]{.underline} the establishment of world
[unity based on the]{.underline} implementation of the [Western model.
This is why, against the illusions of the universalist humanitarians, we
must listen to Schmitt]{.underline} when he reminds us that ''the
political world is a pluriverse, not a universe.'' 8 [This
is,]{.underline} I believe, [the only way to avoid the ''clash of
civilizations'']{.underline} which was announced by Samuel Huntington
and to which, despite its intentions, the universalist discourse is in
fact contributing.

### At: friend-enemy bad

#### enmity doesn't subscribe to universal moral categories, so it doesn't commit unnecessary violence. Liberalism is worse because it treats its beliefs as inviolate and refuses to acknowledge the violence it enables

**Noorani, 5** -- Assistant Professor in the Department of Near Eastern
Studies at the University of Arizona (Yaseen, 2005, "The Rhetoric of
Security," CR: The New Centennial Review, 5.1, p. 18-20)

In The Concept of the Political, first published in 1932, Schmitt
develops the Hobbesian notion of the state of war always in effect among
nations. On this basis, he distinguishes the "political" from other
areas of human existence by its concern with the preservation of one's
existence as such. The agency that exists for the purpose of preserving
existence is the state, and its means of fulfilling this purpose is its
capacity to distinguish friends from enemies. [Schmitt's point of
departure is the possibility that some alien]{.underline} group of
[people may]{.underline} at some time [try to destroy the
group]{.underline} of [people to which I belong.]{.underline} In this
case, normative considerations go out the window, and [my
group]{.underline} of people [simply does what]{.underline}ever [it can
to preserve itself]{.underline} from extinction. According to Schmitt,
self-preservation is a primordial fact out- side of moral normativity.
[War]{.underline}, the readiness of combatants to die, the physical
killing of human beings who belong on the side of the enemy---all this
[has no normative meaning, but an existential meaning only]{.underline},
particularly in a real combat situation with a real enemy. [There exists
no]{.underline} rational purpose, no [norm]{.underline} no matter how
true, no program no matter how exemplary, no social ideal no matter how
beautiful, no legitimacy nor legality [which could justify men in
killing each other]{.underline} for this reason. [If]{.underline} such
[physical destruction of human life is not motivated by an existential
threat]{.underline} to one's own way of life, [then it cannot be
justified]{.underline}. (Schmitt 1996, 48--49) The idea here is that [no
end]{.underline} or objective having to do with the way we think things
ought to be [can justify]{.underline} dying and [killing. We are only
driven to these in cases of pure necessity]{.underline}, when we merely
need to survive. For Schmitt, this non-normative condition of the state
of war is the essence of the polit- ical, because [the possibility of
destruction at the hands of an enemy is always present and must
therefore govern the nature of social organization and political
authority]{.underline}. The problem with [liberalism]{.underline}, in
Schmitt's view, is that it [does not even take this foundational
eventuality of politics into account in formulating its principles.
Since liberal doctrine holds that individuals]{.underline} and nations
[may live peacefully by respecting each other's autonomy,]{.underline}
[liberalism provides no incentive for organizing society so as to
confront potential threats to it.]{.underline} Liberal principles
endanger the nation by placing all value in individual liberty and
rights and none in the requirements of national security. Indeed,
liberal individualism has no means of demanding self-sacrifice from
citizens for the sake of the nation. But most significantly, liberalism
can only call upon individuals to participate in a war that claims to be
moral and just, a war on behalf of humanity that supposedly aims at
putting an end to war. "When a state fights its political enemy in the
name of humanity, it is not a war for the sake of humanity, but a war
wherein a particular state seeks to usurp a universal concept against
its military opponent" (Schmitt 1996, 54). [The introduction of morality
into the nonmoral realm of self-preservation makes matters
worse]{.underline}, indeed vitiates the state of war entirely [by
condemning the enemy as an]{.underline} immoral and [inhuman agency that
must be exterminated. Such]{.underline} moral [claims]{.underline} for
prosecuting a war are designed to [veil ulterior motives, such as
greed]{.underline},6 or indicate internal fissures in the state, [the
posturing of political parties to gain power]{.underline} through
control of the govern- ment's authority to wage war. This sort of
political contestation within the state is for Schmitt the negative form
of politics that must be eliminated by the repudiation of moral
normativity in the political.7 "[The justification of war does not
reside in]{.underline} its being fought for [ideals]{.underline} or
norms of justice, [but in its being fought against a real
enemy]{.underline}" (49). [Sheer existence is the only standard
allowed]{.underline}, and protecting the existence of the nation/state
is the only orientation politics can have. [This ensures]{.underline}
for Schmitt [that only necessary wars will be fought]{.underline} and
that wars will indeed be fought when necessary.

#### Presupposing non-violence is worse---in practice, it requires violence and tries to inscribe an ontologically violent form of liberal monism

**Rasch 2004** -- PhD, Henry H. H. Remak Professor of Germanic Studies
at Indiana University (William, Birkbeck Law Press, "Sovereignty and its
discontents", p. 15-17)

What could be wrong with such a vision? Certainly it is neither
verifiable nor deniable empirically, so one cannot object on that
ground. Ontologies are posited, not proven; and the same goes for
philosophical anthropology at this level of abstraction. [What we
have]{.underline} in Milbank, then, [is an image of a primordially
pacified globe, and a lovely image it is. It satisfies]{.underline} the
demands, or so it would seem, of a non-Kantian ethics, based on
expansion rather than repression of desire,7 and [a quintessentially
enlightened theology that places original goodness over
sin]{.underline}. It also sketches the outlines for an ideal,
noncapitalist economics based on collective utilization of the commons,
and links this sketch, much like recent radical histories,8 to a
putatively pre-fallen stage of history of the human race not yet marked
by the doctrine of property and dominion. It conforms to the demand for
the symmetry and 'noble simplicity' of a classical aesthetics. [And its
portrayal of the political]{.underline}, to the extent that such a
portrayal exists, [does offer a distinct alternative to Schmitt's
friend/enemy model]{.underline}. But, not unexpectedly, here some
difficulties arise, because the image of peaceful harmony that is found
in the original text of peaceful creation is overlaid by the more
violent and imperfect second text. T[he question becomes: How do we
move]{.underline} from that second text [back]{.underline} to the first
one? [How]{.underline}, in other words, [do we convince those not
already willing to participate in the]{.underline} coming [community to
give up their]{.underline} 'sinful' [ways?]{.underline} The question is
a difficult one, because [if peace is the default mode]{.underline} of
the universe and violence only 'an unnecessary intrusion' brought into
the community by 'a free subject who asserts a will that is truly
independent of God and of others, and thereby a will to the inhibition
and distortion of reality' (Milbank, 1990, p 432), [how does one combat
that violence if not by violence? The exercise of a]{.underline}
corrective violence, a ['just' violence]{.underline}, aimed at the
sinful intrusion [is]{.underline}, of course, [a]{.underline}
traditional Christian [response]{.underline}.9 It is not, however,
Milbank's. Instead he offers something perhaps even more insidious.
Milbank opts for 'ecclesial coercion', a form of 'noncoercive
persuasion' (Milbank, 1990, p 418) that is a collective, communal
pressure expressed as 'social anger' or 'calm fury'. 'When a person
commits an evil act', Milbank writes, 'he cuts himself off from social
peace', because 'an individual's sin is never his alone ... its
endurance harms us all, and therefore its cancellation is also the
responsibility of all' (Milbank, 1990, pp 421, 422). Therefore,
non-coercive persuasion is the collective pressure of the group that
ideally leads to renewed voluntary conformity, the 'free consent of
will' (Milbank, 1990, p 418), on the part of the deviant individual.

[The political as Schmitt envisions]{.underline} it
[disappears]{.underline} completely [once one presupposes]{.underline}
the ontological priority of [non-violence. But what takes its
place?]{.underline} It may seem ironic, but once one renounces the
political and embraces the community based on harmonious universal
inclusion of the peaceful and absolute exclusion of 'sin', one seems to
have what Schmitt refers to as 'democracy' based on homogeneity. [When
one excludes the political, one has to guard the borders vigilantly
against those willful intruders]{.underline} who deviate from God's will
-- which also means that one need be ever vigilant within those borders
as well. [Such an atmosphere]{.underline}, it seems, [lends
itself]{.underline} well [to the]{.underline} description, cited above,
of the '[total state which no longer knows anything]{.underline}
absolutely nonpolitical' (Schmitt, 1976, p 25), [which is to say that
the political loses its autonomy and becomes conflated with the moral.
What then becomes of those who are not 'persuaded']{.underline}, who
adamantly refuse to 'participate'? Is 'sin' the only category available
to describe their behavior? And [is there no legitimate political
alternative to]{.underline} pure and [absolute consensus? Will all
dissent]{.underline} and all dissenters who refuse to repent [be
eternally damned?]{.underline} We know by now what question to ask, and
it is a quintessentially Schmittian question: [Who decides?]{.underline}
Who decides on what is and what is not peace, what is and what is not
violence, what is and what is not sin? And we know the answer: the
sovereign, here the far from non-coercive sovereignty of the collective
known as the Christian community. By extension, the same question can be
asked of the other proponents of the ontological priority of
nonviolence, that is, of Agamben and of Hardt and Negri. Does negating
the presupposition of violence negate the sovereign, or is not the
negation itself a sovereign act, one made by the theologian or the
philosopher, or by a liberal order that claims to have solved, once and
for all, the nihilistic problem of the political?

[Against this background, Schmitt's claim that]{.underline} 'all genuine
[political theories presuppose]{.underline} man to be
[evil]{.underline}, ie, by no means an unproblematic but a dangerous and
dynamic being' (Schmitt, 1976, p 61) [sounds less alarming and even
less]{.underline} traditionally [conservative]{.underline} than at first
glance. Even here, with regard to what would seem to be a basic
anthropological principle, Schmitt stands firmly within the horizon of
the modern, for he treats the thesis of the human's basic problematic
nature as a logical presupposition, a supposition made exclusively from
within the political, and neither as an anthropological fact nor a
presupposition that need be made in the same way elsewhere. Rather
surprisingly, he states: 'One must pay more attention to how very
different the anthropological presuppositions are in the various domains
of human thought.' The 'educator will consider man capable of being
educated', the jurist starts with the presupposition of goodness, the
theologian must start with sin and end with the possibility of
redemption, and the moralist must assume freedom of choice between good
and evil. But, '[because the]{.underline} sphere of the [political is in
the final analysis determined by the real possibility of enmity,
political]{.underline} conceptions and [ideas cannot]{.underline} very
well [start with an anthropological optimism. This would dissolve the
possibility of enmity and, thereby, every specific political
consequence']{.underline} (Schmitt, 1976, p 64). Indeed, the logical
chain seems to work in reverse. The presupposed nature of the political
determines the anthropological ground upon which it can rest. [Thus, it
is not a misanthropic pessimism that guides his preference for the
ontological priority of violence, but rather a logical
necessity,]{.underline} forced by the need to justify political
opposition. In all cases -- [the liberalism that neutralizes the
political to the point of oblivion]{.underline} and the total democracy
that creates the inescapable monism of the total community -- the
ontological priority of goodness and non-violence [leads, paradoxically,
to the impossibility of political life]{.underline}, if by political
life one wishes to advance the notions of dissent, argument, and the
type of pluralism that provides for the possibility of real and
meaningful disagreement because such disagreement can erupt
'existentially' as violent conflict. For this type of political
behavior, one must assume the human being to be a dangerous being, a
risky creature (Schmitt, 1976, p 58).

### At: you glorify war

#### To say that conflict is inevitable is not the same as celebrating it.

**Thorup, 06** -- Ph.D. dissertation @ the Institute of Philosophy and
the History of Ideas (Mikkel, January, 2006, "In Defence of Enmity --
Critiques of Liberal Globalism," p. 44)

Conflictuality has also invited positive receptions, for instance in
some republican interpretations as a cure for corruption (McCormick
1993, 2001) or in historical sociology focusing on the constructive
forces unleashed by conflict. As Charles Tilly (1985) famously said:
"States made war, and war made states". Lewis A. Coser wrote in his
classic The Functions of Social Conflict: "To focus on the functional
aspects of social conflict is not to deny that certain forms of conflict
are indeed destructive of group unity or that they lead to
disintegration of specific social structures. Such focusing serves,
however, to correct a balance of analysis which has been tilted in the
other direction" (1956: 8). At the same time as the pacifist and the
militarist approaches are unacceptable (in their radical form), they are
also inevitable and necessary (in the form I use them here). Because
they constitute the main sources of political debate and contest. It is
the claim that large parts of the history of political ideas can be read
and understood through the prism depoliticization/repoliticization,
where for instance liberals insist on depoliticization as the way to
overcome violence, force, coercion and, in this view, also the
political, whereas the different liberalism critiques insist on the
permanence of force, coercion and violence as (and as well as) the
political. In her book Political Theory and the Displacement of
Politics, Bonnie Honig differentiates between two approaches to
politics: A 'virtue theory of politics', which is a peace-perspective
and a 'virtù theory of politics', which is a conflict perspective, and
her description of the conflict perspective and its use covers very well
my use of it here: [To affirm the perpetuity of conflict is not to
celebrate a world without points of stabilization]{.underline}; it is to
affirm the reality of perpetual contest, even within an ordered setting,
and to identify the affirmative dimensions of contestation. It is to see
tha[t the always imperfect closure of political space tends to engender
remainders and that, if those remainders are not engaged, they may
return to]{.underline} haunt and [destabilize the very closures that
deny their existence.]{.underline} It is to treat rights and law as a
part of political contest rather than as the instruments of its closure.
It is to see that [attempts to shut down the agon perpetually
fail]{.underline}, that [the best]{.underline} (or worst) they [do is to
displace politics onto other sites]{.underline} and topics, [where the
struggle of]{.underline} identity and [difference, resistance and
closure, is then repeated.]{.underline} (1993: 15-16)

#### accepting the necessity of plurality and division is critical to effectively recognize the political nature of war and limit it.

**Zarmanian, 06** -- University of Milan (Thalin, "Carl Schmitt and the
Problem of Legal Order: From Domestic to International", Leiden Journal
of International Law, 19 (2006), pp. 51-52)

Because of its focus on enmity and conflict Schmitt's thought has often
been re- garded as militarist and war-oriented.42 In Der Begriff des
Politischen, however, Schmitt defended himself pre-emptively by stating
that [his definition of the essence of politics does not mean that war
is]{.underline} an ideal or [the goal of politics]{.underline}. He wrote
instead that [the goal of politics is rather to avoid war.]{.underline}
What he meant is only that the ever-present possibility of war is the
leading presupposition which determines in a characteristic way human
action and thinking and thereby creates a specifically political
behaviour.43 [A world in which the possibility of war no longer existed
would be a world in which a perfect order would be realized, because
the]{.underline} momentum of [indeterminacy which every
norm]{.underline} and principle [entails would have been eliminated.
This would be a world without the political]{.underline},
[but]{.underline}, Schmitt notes, [also a world in which only one
culture]{.underline}, one [civilization]{.underline}, one
[economics]{.underline}, one [morality]{.underline}, one
[law]{.underline}, one type of art, and one form of en- tertainment
[would exist]{.underline}. But as long [as the world remains a
pluriverse]{.underline}, [each]{.underline} of these
[realm]{.underline}s [is capable of giving rise to political
distinctions.]{.underline} Without giving him credit, Schmitt in his
writing made an assertion originally made by Hans Morgenthau in his
graduation dissertation.44 According to this assertion, the
friend--enemy opposition has no substance of its own. It is, rather,
defined by its intensity. The political can in fact derive its energy
from any realm (religious, economic, social, cultural, moral) but its
particularity is to drive the distinction within these realms to the
extreme de- gree of separation. Not every possible grouping, not every
element of distinction or separation between individuals, has a
political character, nor is the grouping along the lines of the
friend--enemy distinction the only one. According to Schmitt, the en-
emy is not morally bad, religiously heretical, or aesthetically ugly
simply by virtue of being the enemy. This means that even though single
individuals belong to the same cross-cutting groupings of the enemy, in
the critical case the one which is political -- that is, the one for
which the individual is ready to risk his life -- prevails over the
others. Therefore Schmitt's focus on intensity as the defining feature
of the political does not mean that he is a nihilist. To him, [conflict
is not an irrational drive or a normative necessity. It is]{.underline},
rather, [the result of a deliberate choice]{.underline} (a decision)
[about the binding substance of a people's political
existence]{.underline}:

### At: you use Schmitt-influenced Concepts

#### 1. Not the Schmitt k, not an endorsement of Schmitt's personal ptx, we have only mentioned Schmittian concepts because they are used in the literature critiquing political theology. This critique is using people like Rene Girard, Agamben, Arnedt, Derrida, Kosseleck and Negri, Foucault and Wendy Brown to forward a critical reading of the concept of political theology. This argument is a poor attempt to deflect from legitimate critique of the Aff through a sort of long shot guilt by association. None of our critique is primary source Schmitt and in fact the contemporary readers of Schmitt use him as part of the New Left's goal ot critique American imperialism after the collapse of the Soviet Union

**Piccone and Ulmen 02.** Ph.D. SUNY Prof. at Washington Univeristy, St.
Louis and writer Telos press, '2 \[Paul and Gary, "Uses and abuses of
Carl Schmitt", Telos, Winter p3\]

Yet, [hostility toward Schmitt\'s work is so intense that it spills over
onto what anti-Schmittians smear as \"Schmitt
apologists\"]{.underline}\--[those who view Schmitt as someone more
interesting and relevant than a mere Nazi ideologue.]{.underline} This
intensity cannot be explained solely in terms of differences of
scholarly opinion. It is rooted in more subtle political issues. (16)
While [the motivation seems to be]{.underline} clear, i.e., that the
\"apology\" somehow is related to a diabolical conservative attempt to
re-habilitate fascist or Nazi ideology by de-Nazifying Schmitt and
legitimating his dangerous ideas, the charge makes no sense and is a
typical result of the confusion of European and American political
realities. For example, [the alleged \"apologists\" have no connection
to conservatism]{.underline}: Joseph W. [Bendersky]{.underline} (author
of the first intellectual biography of Schmitt in English) [has always
been a liberal]{.underline}; George [Schwab lost several close family
members in Nazi camps and]{.underline} cannot possibly be suspected of
fascist sympathies; and [Telos]{.underline} (which published the first
special issue on Schmitt in English) [has been the main organ of New
Left philosophy and theory in the US since 1968]{.underline}. Thus, [the
conflict of interpretations is not between Left and
Right]{.underline}\--or between conservatives and managerial
liberals\--[but exclusively between what remains of the Left after the
debacle of the New Left in the 1970s and the collapse of the Soviet
empire in the late 1980s]{.underline}.

#### 2. We have no sympathy for Schmitt, but want to use concepts like friend-enemy and the political and the nomos to critique neo-conservative projects in disguise of humantiarin liberlaims such as the Aff

**Rasch 2005** -- PhD, Henry H. H. Remak Professor of Germanic Studies
at Indiana University (Spring, William, The South Atlantic Quarterly,
104.2, "Introduction: Carl Schmitt and the New World Order"

Those deliberations centered on a single text by a single author, Carl
Schmitt's Der Nomos der Erde im Völkerrecht des Jus Publicum Europaeum,
originally written in the 1940s, published in West Germany in 1950, and
translated into Spanish in 1979 and finally into French and English over
the past few years. 2 Nomos distills over twenty years of Schmitt's
thinking on international law. In part it undeniably reads like an elegy
on the passing of the Eurocentric world order associated with the
sixteenth-century conquest of the New World and the seventeenth-century
development of the European territorial nation-state system, the
so-called Westphalian order (named after the Treaty of Westphalia that
ended the Thirty Years' War). Tears shed over the decline and fall of a
global order that witnessed the rise of Spanish, British, French, Dutch,
and other empires with their concomitant genocide, slave trade, and
enduring legacies of racism are, to say the least, problematic tears
indeed. But the [interest that Schmitt's book]{.underline} (and related
writings) has [generated]{.underline} over the past decade and a half
elliptically [orbits]{.underline}, I believe, [around]{.underline} two
foci: (1) [Schmitt's realist, sober, and]{.underline} often [bitterly
skeptical account of]{.underline} the twentieth-century development of
international law and [international relations that exposes the
concealed]{.underline} or even unconscious agendas of American
[idealism]{.underline} and the type of normative theorizing represented
by John Rawls and Jürgen Habermas, [and]{.underline} (2) [the logical
structure Schmitt gives to that]{.underline} realist [account. The
structure Schmitt fixates on is a simple but powerful]{.underline} and
seemingly inescapable [dialectic of inclusion and
exclusion]{.underline}, a fatally necessary intertwining of ''good'' and
''bad'' orderings of human aﬀairs. [Reading Schmitt, one quickly
realizes that his prejudices and allegiances do not necessarily match
one's own. Yet]{.underline} one also soon learns that **[one need not
always sympathize with his sympathies to profit from his
insights.]{.underline}**

#### 3. Our alternative imagination is nothing like what they criticize---it's a foucauldian reading of Schmitt to understand difference in interaitional politics -- produces pluralistic difference, superior to fake liberal toleration which terminates in warfare

**Rasch 2003** - Professor and Chair of Germanic Studies, Indian
University Bloomington, Ph.D. U of Washington/ \[William, "Human Rights
as Geopolitics: Carl Schmitt and the Legal Form of American Supremacy",
Cultural Critique 54, pg. 120-147\]

Clearly, [neither Agamben nor Schmitt, despite the latter\'s nostalgia
for the older, Eurocentric order, advocates a return of the hegemonic
and genocidal relationship to the non-European world]{.underline}. But
they do fundamentally differ in their evaluation of the sovereign
exception. Schmitt, in his argument with abstract normativity,
steadfastly maintains that, whether it is acknowledged or not, order is
always spatially and concretely grounded. For him, the \"state of
nature,\" from which the law is banished but on which the law is based,
can be managed, controlled, localized, and limited but never eliminated.
[Order is localizable and therefore so is the state of
exception]{.underline} (Ausnahmezustand) [on which it is
grounded]{.underline}. [Agamben]{.underline}, on the other hand,
[implicitly believes in the possibility of a political order that would
not be based on an exclusion]{.underline}. [The insistence on localizing
a putatively logically necessary exception is]{.underline}, in
Agamben\'s view, [what drives modernity]{.underline}. Indeed, it is what
has driven us all straight to hell, because for Agamben the telos, or
logical consequence of such localization, is, quite simply if
melodramatically, Auschwitz. \"When our age,\" he writes, \"tried to
grant the unlocalizable a permanent and visible localization, the result
was the concentration camp\" (1998, 20). Thus, [rather than merely
\"limiting\" or \"civilizing\" the violence associated with a
fatalistically necessary state of exception, Agamben wishes to eliminate
it]{.underline}. Accordingly, [his vision of the political is
alternately nihilistic and utopian]{.underline}---that is---[hopeless
except for the one grand hope.\"Until a completely new
politics]{.underline} \... [is at hand,\"]{.underline} he writes,
\"[every new theory and every praxis will remain imprisoned and
immobile, and the \'beautiful day\' of life will be given citizenship
only either through blood and death or in the perfect senselessness to
which the society of the spectacle condemns it]{.underline}\" (11).
\[End Page 129\]

We will return to the issue of a \"completely new politics\" later. 3
For now I wish to investigate a second trajectory that the sovereign ban
traces, one that Agamben hints at, but does not examine. Agamben focuses
on the localization of the state of exception and its apotheosis in the
camp. If the first successful modern localization of the sovereign
exception is represented by the distinction between Europe and the New
World, then its culmination as the internment, labor, concentration, and
death camps of the twentieth century can be seen as a type of
reintroduction of the initial distinction within Europe itself---and, of
course, within the now \"civilized\" Western Hemisphere as well. One
thereby replaces the civilized/uncivilized distinction with
Aryan/non-Aryan, white/black, native/immigrant, or---and though Agamben
does not mention this possibility, some surely would---woman/fetus.
[There is]{.underline}, however, [a parallel if reverse way of dealing
with exclusion, and the remainder of this study will focus not on
localization but on the invisibilization of the exception in the
abstract moral and legal norm that informs the liberal rule of law and
its extension as universal human rights]{.underline}. With Europe
divested of its moral and political authority and integrated into a
larger, potentially global order, [the new American hegemony challenges
us to imagine a total, exceptionless inclusion of sovereign
peoples]{.underline} (Rawls 1999) [or sovereign individuals]{.underline}
(Habermas) [with no enabling exclusion]{.underline}. [Schmitt postulated
that whether one likes it or not, the norm rests on an
exception]{.underline}, inclusion on an exclusion. Schmitt would
therefore ask: can one think of the entire globe as a differentiated
unity without an outside? [The purpose of his much-maligned friend/enemy
distinction was neither to glorify war nor to justify the extermination
of the heterogeneous, but to show that a total or global \"inclusion of
the other,\"]{.underline} to use Habermas\'s threatening phrase (1998),
[could only occur if the otherness of the other]{.underline}, that which
makes him what he is, [is excluded from the world community. One cannot
help but draw the friend/enemy distinction]{.underline}, then, [when one
recognizes in the handshake of the purported friend the surreptitious
continuation of warfare by other means.]{.underline} Thus, the question
we need to ask is: on what exclusion is the ostensive universal
extension of human rights based? To repeat: it was Schmitt\'s contention
that America\'s greatest achievement involved making this new exclusion
invisible. If that is the case, then [our task is to bring that
exclusion back to light]{.underline}. \[End Page 130\]

# AFF AT: POLITICAL THEOLOGY

### Alt 🡪 war 

#### the alt leads to total war

**Moreiras, 04** -- Director of European Studies at Duke, (Alberto,
2004, "A God without Sovereignty. Political Jouissance. The Passive
Decision", CR: The New Centennial Review 4.3, p. 82-83, Project MUSE)

But the scandal gets worse, and this is something that Schmitt does not
point out. He does quote, with high praise ("it is impossible to
understand the concept of a just enemy better than did Kant" \[169\]),
Kant's definition of the just enemy. But [Kant's definition of the just
enemy is]{.underline} itself [scandalous, and]{.underline} potentially
[throws Schmitt's differentiation into disarray.]{.underline} For Kant,
"[a just enemy would be one]{.underline} that [I]{.underline} would be
[do]{.underline}ing [wrong by resisting]{.underline}, [but then he
would]{.underline} also [not be my enemy]{.underline}" (2003, 169). With
this, with what we could call Schmitt's refusal to deal with the
implications of the Kantian definition, although he himself provides it,
Schmitt shows a double face. It stands to reason that, if the notion of
the just enemy is an impossibility, that is, [if the enemy]{.underline},
[in virtue of his very justice, is always already a friend, then all
enemies]{.underline}, in order [to be enemies, must be
unjust]{.underline}. If all enemies are unjust, [then every single enemy
stands outside]{.underline} the jurisdiction of [the nomos. The nomic
order]{.underline} has then effective [jurisdiction only
over]{.underline} friends, [and]{.underline} it loses its universality.
It loses, indeed, more than its universality: it [loses its position as
a]{.underline} political [concept, since it cannot account
for]{.underline}, it can only submit to, [the friend/enemy
division]{.underline}. Hence, the order of the nomos and the order (or,
rather, the state) of any concrete politics are radically incompatible.
If there is politics, then there is no binding nomos. If there is a
nomos, the unjust enemy---and that means any enemy---falls outside the
political order. Schmitt's position in The Nomos of the Earth seems to
contradict his earlier position on the political successfully: the
notion of a nomos of the earth, of an order of the political,
accomplishes, perhaps against Schmitt's own will, a deconstruction of
his notion of the political. Or perhaps, on the contrary, we are faced
with the fact that Schmitt's own indications of the Kantian position
deconstruct the notion of an order of the political beyond every
concrete friend-enemy grouping and send us back to the absolute primacy
of the friend/enemy division in terms of a determination of the
politcal. Do we prefer to uphold the notion of a nomic order, or do we
prefer to abide by a savage, anomic notion of the political? Is there a
choice?4 [If all enemies are unjust enemies, all enemies must be
exterminated. There is no end and no limitation to war]{.underline}: war
is total, and that is so both for the friends of the nomos, and for
their unjust enemies. But total war cannot be a fundamental orientation
and a principle of order. The notion of total war announces the end of
any possible reign of nomic order. It also announces a radicalization of
the political, precisely as it opens itself to its most extreme
determination as war, now total. But a [total war without a nomos is a
totally unregulated]{.underline}, totally
[nondiscriminatory]{.underline} war, [without legality.]{.underline} And
[a war under those conditions cannot abide by]{.underline} a concept of
[friendship, since it has generalized the friend/enemy division into
their complete disruption. Friendship presupposes legality]{.underline}.
Faced with total war, [humanity finds itself deprived of]{.underline}
amity, just as it finds itself deprived of [enmity]{.underline}. At the
logical end of the concept, [the political division finds its own end.
Total war is the end of the political.]{.underline} The whole notion of
an order of the political has now been placed beyond the line. Total war
is an absolute threat.

### Alt doesn't sovle

#### **The alternative can't solve because it will never spill over---the international community has rejected the notion of enmity.** 

**Scheppele 04** (Kim Lane Scheppele, John J. O\'Brien Professor of
Comparative Law and Professor of Sociology at University of
Pennsylvania, 6 U. Pa. J. Const. L. 1001, Lexis Nexus, May 2004)

In this Article, I have tried to explain why the logic of [Schmitt\'s
analyses]{.underline} [no longer work]{.underline} as a practical matter
[to justify states of exception, even]{.underline} when it is clear to
the international community that something fundamental has changed in
the world system [since 9/11. The institutional]{.underline} elaboration
of a new [international system]{.underline} that has occurred since
Schmitt\'s time [make his ideas seem all the more dangerous, and yet all
the more dated. There are]{.underline} simply [fewer states]{.underline}
in the world [willing to tolerate]{.underline} either
[Schmitt\'s]{.underline} conception of [politics or his conception
of]{.underline} the defining qualities of [sovereignty.]{.underline}
Schmitt\'s philosophy has, in short, been met with a different
sociology. [For his ideas to be]{.underline} either persuasive or
[effective,]{.underline} they must be more than internally coherent or
even plausible; [they must be]{.underline} loosed in a context [in which
they can win against other competing ideas.]{.underline} Precisely
[because of the horrors of the twentieth century,]{.underline} much of
[the international community]{.underline} that [has entrenched both
democracy and the rule of law has turned away from]{.underline} these
extra-legal justifications for [states of exception]{.underline}**.**
Instead, such states have attempted to embed exceptionality as an
instance of the normal, and not as a repudiation of the  \[\*1083\] 
possibility of normality. Only the United States, with its
eighteenth-century constitution and Cold War legacy of exceptionalism,
seems to be soldiering on in this new legal space of conflict unaware
that the defining aspect of the new sovereignty is that even the new
sovereign is bound by rules.

### Alt links to self

#### The attempt at internal order through a well-defined sovereign makes war inevitable---enemies who cannot be made stable must be eliminated

**Shapiro**, Professor of Political Science at Hawaiʼi**,** 19**97**
\[Michael J., Violent Cartographies: Mapping Cultures of War, p. 72\]

To put the matter within the discourse of order, which emerged in the
discussion of Anggor cosmology, sensitivity to the ontological
dimensions of warfare should lead one to expect complementarity between
the orders of the self and those discerned in the world. Those who
regard any aspect of disorder within the self as intolerable---those who
demand a totally coherent and unified body---must necessarily engage in
a denial of the forces of disorder within the order of the self. Insofar
as this is the case, external disorder, practices in the world that do
not comport with the system of order within which one resides, will be
particularly threatening. When one recognizes in addition that the
collectivity or nation serves as a symbolic extension---the individual
body connects to the national body---the same structural logic linking
self and other at the level of individual selves also applies to the
link between the domestic and foreign orders. Denial of disorder within
the order for the collective body as a whole should lead to an
intolerance of an external order that fails to validate, by imitation,
the domestic order. Thus a nonimitative order will be interpreted as
disorder and, accordingly, as a threat. Moreover, the \"threat\" is
dissimulated because of the misrecognition involved in the very
constitution of the self, a failure to recognize dimensions of
incoherence and otherness within the self. Accordingly, the threat is
interpreted as a danger to the survival of the order rather than an
affront to the order\'s interpretive coherence. Having established a
basis for the suspicion that the modern nation-state, like the prestate
society, contains an ontological impetus to warfare and that in
modernity this often takes the form of extraordinary demands for
coherence within the orders of the self and the nation, the next move is
to deepen that suspicion by pursuing a recent case. Accordingly, in the
next chapter I pursue the ontological theme with special attention to
the selection and targeting of dangerous objects during the Gulf War.

### Desire =/= mimetic -- human experiences

#### Desire isn't mimetic -- proven by actual human experiences

**Landy 12** -- Joshua, Andrew B. Hammond Professor in French Language,
Literature and Civilization at Stanford University, "Deceit, Desire, and
the Literature Professor: Why Girardians Exist" Republics of Letters: A
Journal for the Study of Knowledge, Politics, and the Arts 3, no. 1
(September 15, 2012)
<https://arcade.stanford.edu/rofl/deceit-desire-and-literature-professor-why-girardians-exist>
//KohlW

But the hardened Girardians will say, "What do you mean, any desire,
even non-mimetic? There is no such thing as non-mimetic desire!" So
[let's return to Stage One of the theory: all desire is mimetic; we do
not desire things for intrinsic reasons, but only because a person we
admire in some way (a "mediator") has desired them first. Where to begin
with such a claim? Well, let's begin with pica. Pica is an eating
disorder whose sufferers feel an overwhelming desire to eat odd
things---things like paint, or pillow stuffing, or candle wax. Pica
sufferers tend to harbor deep shame about their desires, and as a
result, they do not talk about them; their condition is typically
discovered when they are rushed to the emergency room with stomach
pains. So I ask you: **where is the model for someone's desire to eat
paint**? Nobody talks about it, so nobody knows about it, so there
simply cannot be a model.]{.underline}22

To turn from something rather unhealthy to something perfectly healthy,
but still stigmatized in many contexts, [consider
homosexuality]{.underline}.23 [If a young woman growing up in Victorian
England]{.underline} (or in today's Iran24) [turns out to be someone who
desires other women, not men, where should we say she got this desire
from? **There is**, quite probably, **no one around to serve as a
model**: she may indeed feel horribly alone at first, precisely because
she knows no one else who professes to having such inclinations. But
perhaps a day comes when she discovers like-minded individuals and, as a
result, is finally able to divulge and indulge them. Surely it makes no
sense to say that she got these desires from her new friends. Where,
then, are the models that ostensibly inspired them?]{.underline}

[Maybe]{.underline} you'll say that [Girard isn't thinking about general
preferences]{.underline} like that; [he's thinking about specific
objects of desire]{.underline}. [He's thinking]{.underline}, say, [about
the time I watched]{.underline} Quentin Tarantino's [Kill
Bill]{.underline} just [because my]{.underline} good [friend Lanier
recommended it]{.underline} to me. [Fair enough; I did watch that
movie]{.underline} just because Lanier recommended it to me, and
[because I trust his judgment. But then it turned out to be one of the
worst films of all time, and when Lanier suggested I]{.underline} also
[watch the sequel]{.underline}, Kill Bill 2, strangely enough [I was not
filled with a burning desire to do so]{.underline}. Why not? What went
wrong? **[How did I manage to be unaffected by the very same
"mediator]{.underline}**"?25 [Perhaps you'll want to say that a
different mediator was the model---another friend, this time someone who
loathes Tarantino]{.underline}. [But then, who was the
meta-model]{.underline} who told me to pick the second model rather than
the first model for advice on what to watch? [And who was the
meta-metamodel---let's call it a super-model---**who told me to trust
that meta-model rather than some other meta-model** who might have told
me to stick with Lanier's judgment?]{.underline} **[These regresses have
to end somewhere]{.underline}**, and I don't think it's with Gisele
Bündchen.26

What Bakhtin understood---and Girard apparently did not---is that
**[most situations present us not with one but with multiple possible
models]{.underline}**. I can join the left-wing party, like my brother
David, or the right-wing party, like my brother Aron. [I can drink Coke,
as Penélope Cruz appears to be urging, or Pepsi, following the
promptings of Cindy Crawford. (I can even stick to water, following my
doctor's more sensible advice.)]{.underline} I can take up arms like
Malcolm X or resist nonviolently like Martin Luther King. I can be good
like Abel or bad like Cain, gracious like Saint Francis or vicious like
Sade. For Girardian hermeneuts, **[finding an apparent model is like
shooting fish in a barrel]{.underline}**: [there is always someone they
can point to as the ostensible origin of my actions. But what they can't
do is to explain the **mysterious lack of force field surrounding
everyone else**]{.underline}. Why, when I joined the left-wing party
(ostensibly borrowing brother David's example), was I not infected by my
other brother's desire? [Why, when I chose the glass of water, was I
immune to the combined charms of Mss. Crawford and Cruz?]{.underline}
[It's true that we tend not to make choices in splendid
isolation]{.underline}---I didn't invent the left-wing party, or
nonviolent resistance, or sugary drinks---[but we do make the choices.
Other people cannot make them for us]{.underline}, [precisely because
**there are too many other people**]{.underline}, with too many
different opinions.

### Girard is wrong/no explanatory power

**Their theory is that sin, in the Christian sense, makes human culture
ontologically irredeemable \-\-- this monolithic characterization of
culture erases nuance and turns itself**

**Ormerod 18** (Neil, Professor of Theology, in the Institute for
Religion and Critical Inquiry, Australian Catholic University, "René
Girard, Unlikely Apologist",

Girard and Culture As Kaplan notes, [Girard argues that the scapegoating
mechanism marks the origins of]{.underline} religion and
[culture]{.underline}, which are somewhat to be identified, sort of
religion-culture (109). [In this way Girard renders the universal
presence of primal religion more transparent]{.underline}, not as merely
the product of primitive superstition, but as inherent in the notion of
culture itself. [My]{.underline} [concern]{.underline} [here is that
Girard's portrayal of the origins of culture present culture itself as
intrinsically problematic]{.underline}; or as Milbank suggests, [there
is more than a hint here of the ontological priority of
violence]{.underline}. [Culture's origins lie in a primitive originating
murder]{.underline}, recast as a founding religious myth to mask its
true nature. Culture/religion is then built on a lie. The gospel is then
cast as the unmasking of this lie and the laying bear of the
scapegoating mechanism and our complicity in it. Again my concern is not
with the plausibility of this construct to explain important features of
primal religious culture. [The question is whether it is a complete
account]{.underline}. [Is there a place in our story of culture's
origins for intelligence, reasonableness and
responsibility?]{.underline} [Is there a place for a non-mimetic wonder
and awe in an awaking into consciousness of the universe of being in
those first human beings?]{.underline} In a more down-to-earth way, [is
there a place for the practical intelligence that developed the axe
heads and spears, the pottery and leatherwork, the nascent agriculture
and the like, that allowed human populations to grow and flourish
creating the leisure for an emerging mathematics and science to raise
above the demands of common sense and strive for genuine explanatory
knowing?]{.underline} If I may draw on Eric Voegelin's cultural
typology, [Girard is strong on cosmological culture]{.underline} in his
account of primal religious culture; and equally cognizant of
soteriological culture in the role he gives to the gospel; [but what is
missing is any recognition of the role of anthropological
culture]{.underline} (always keeping in mind that these are types, not
cultures per se).7 While [Girard]{.underline} acknowledges the
importance of Karl Jasper's notion of an axial period (115), it seems to
me that he [does not attend to]{.underline} the two different [responses
that emerge]{.underline} at this time [to cosmologically dominated
cultures]{.underline}: one anthropological as exemplified in the person
of Socrates; the other soteriological as initially revealed in the Old
Testament culminating in the person of Jesus. [These
represent]{.underline} two different [responses to the mimetic
crisis]{.underline}. [The first seeks an intelligent, reasonable and
responsible resolution to the crisis]{.underline}; the second is to
recognize the innocence of the victims of history. These possibilities
suggest three ways of resolution: the way of sacrificial violence (the
scapegoating mechanism); the way of self-transcendence
(anthropological); and the way of self-sacrificing love
(soteriological).8 One advantage here is that it allows us to understand
the scapegoating mechanism as parasitic on a more fundamental good; it
is a privation of the good and hence not in itself foundational to
culture. While it may share in the omnipresence of sin, still sin is not
fundamental to what it is to be human. Conclusion It seems to me what we
have playing out here in the realm of cultural anthropology is the very
traditional theological schema of grace, nature and sin. [Girard's
approach]{.underline}, it seems to me, [is a transposition into the
cultural realm of a very]{.underline} [Augustinian grace-sin
dialectic]{.underline}, [and carries with it all the problems associated
with that dialectic]{.underline}: e.g., rather than the total corruption
of the sinner [we now have the totally corrupt origins of human
culture]{.underline}. [Into this dark picture the recognition of a human
nature teleologically oriented to meaning, truth and goodness
offers]{.underline} [a shard of light]{.underline}, [something that may
be diminished by sin but never extinguished]{.underline}. Indeed I might
go so far as to suggest that [without the recognition of this "natural"
element, Girard's cultural grace-sin dialectic runs the risk of
perpetuating a further system of "us graced---them sinners" and
consequent mimetic doubling and the very scapegoating that he was
seeking to avoid.]{.underline}

Third, we stress that such [an approach to analysing political emotions
requires creativity and methodological pluralism. Emotions work in
exceptionally complex ways. No single method could possibly account for
their political significance and influence]{.underline}. The chapters in
this volume emphasize the need to draw on a range of different [methods,
from semi-structured interviews to discourse analysis, autoethnography,
content analysis and semiotics, among others. To validate such a broad
and diverse range]{.underline} of methods, [we need an epistemological
framework that eschews the need to arrive at overarching
models]{.underline} [and, instead, appreciates the
pluralism]{.underline} [and]{.underline} creativity and perhaps even
[elusiveness]{.underline} [that resides in each particular approach.
Such a framework requires reflections on both method and methodological
issues: that is, we need to discuss not only the tools needed to
investigate the political roles of emotions but also the epistemological
status attributed to these tools.]{.underline} Defining Feelings,
Emotions and Affect: Political and Methodological Implications Several
chapters in this volume highlight the difficulties involved with
defining emotions. Clément and Sangar (Chap. 1) mention how efforts to
pinpoint the nature of emotions are "highly contested and at times
par-ticularly fuzzy." Ringmar laments that the "vocabulary of affect is
hopelessly confused" and there is little agreement on how related terms
are used or, indeed, how they should be employed. We engage these
discussions here by highlighting how scholars differentiate
phenomenologically between feelings, emotions and affect. We do so not
to settle definitional disputes but to highlight how the struggle to
understand what emotions are goes to their very political core: it
highlights that emotions in all their guises, as distinguishable
emotions as well as more non-conscious feelings and affects, work at
different levels---from the individual to the collective---and that they
are always more than just personal reactions or expressions. Most
international relations scholars use the term "emotion" loosely, as a
broad umbrella term to denote a range of different phenomena. We do so
too in this chapter. But some scholars also draw a clear distinction
between emotions and feelings. Mercer (2014) refers to feelings as "a
conscious awareness that one is experiencing an emotion." Crawford
(2000, p. 125) sees emotions as "inner states that individuals describe
to others as feeling." But both Mercer and Crawford go further and
stress the need to capture the social dimensions at stake. This is why
Crawford (2014) highlights how emotions---individual and subjective as
they might be---are also always intertwined with pre-existing social,
cultural and political contexts. Mercer's very notion of "social
emotion" underlines this point too, for it captures how emotions become
intersubjective when they relate to something social that people care
about, whether it is power, status or justice. Reflecting on the
distinction between emotions and feelings might therefore help us
appreciate the connections between bodily based phenomena and the
processes through which emotions are communicated to others. While
feelings may emerge from within the body, they are at the same time
central to the politics of emotions. Feelings are internal in that they
are felt within bodies, yet they are in a sense external as well. Mercer
(2014) put it this way: bodies cause emotions but emotions cannot be
ontologically reduced to the body. Even though we experience emotion
emerging from our bodies, feelings are formed and structured within
particular social and cultural environments (Lutz, 1988). They are
constituted in relation to culturally specific traditions, such as
language, habits and memories. This is why Sangar, Clément and Lindemann
(Chap. 8) stress the need to "conceive emotions as social phenomena"
that can shape political attitude to a range of phenomena, including
war. Likewise, this is why Wolf (Chap. 10) believes that "emotions are
intrinsically public and therefore can be well established by analysing
social discourse." Karin Fierke (2014) goes one step further, stressing
that individual expressions of emotions "should not ultimately be the
focus of social and political analysis at the international level." This
is the case, she argues, because individual emotions are less
significant for understanding global politics than the emotions that
surround political phenomena. The distinction between emotions and
affect brings out socio-political issues in an even more pertinent way.
In some disciplines, such as geography, this distinction is so intensely
debated that scholars differentiate between "emotional geography" and
"affective geography" (see Thien, 2005; Thrift, 2004). Emotions are seen
as personal and often conscious feelings that have social meaning and
political consequences. Related phenomena can in this way be identified
and assessed. Affective dynamics, by contrast, are viewed as much
broader phenomena that exist both before and beyond consciousness: they
are a wide range of nonreflective and subconscious bodily sensations,
such as mood, intuition, temperament, attachment, disposition and even
memory. In an investigation of the politics and potentials of museums to
illuminate the human costs of war, Audrey Reeves (Chap. 5) insightfully
outlines the consequences of these emotions-affect distinctions for
international relations scholarship (see also Eznack, 2011, 2013;
Holmes, 2013; Ross, 2006, p. 199; Sasley, 2010). The difference between
emotion and affect pivots around the issue of representation (see Pile,
2010, pp. 6--10; Reeves, Chap. 5; Eroukhmanoff and Teles Fazendeiro,
Chap. 11). Those who theorize affect consider the phenomena as
inexpressible: it cannot be analysed through representations. The study
of affect thus opposes attempts to understand specific, seemingly
individualized emotions and moves towards an approach that studies how
particular feelings, sentiments and emotions together act as a type of
collective social force (Thrift, 2004, p. 60; see also Protevi, 2009).
Affect in this sense is "performative": it enables understandings of how
emotional flows both act upon individuals and in doing so enact
particular socio-political norms and behaviours. Emotional geographers
disagree with many of the charges made against them. They argue that
since emotions can only be understood through representations, it is
crucial to understand the respective practices (see also Bondi, 2005;
Eroukhmanoff and Teles Fazendeiro, Chap. 11; Reeves, Chap. 5; Thien,
2005; for a useful critical discussion of the affect/emotion discussion,
see Leys, 2011). To use the term "affect" is thus to make a shift from
isolating specific emotions to the more general recognition that
emotion, feeling and sensations combined generate often unconscious and
unreflective affective dispositions that connect and transcend
individuals (Massumi, 2002, pp. 27--28, 217; Thrift, 2004, p. 60). As
Ringmar (Chap. 2) puts it: "everything is couched in terms of affect."
In this sense, affect is always social and always "intertwined across
time" (Eroukhmanoff and Teles Fazendeiro, Chap. 11). This position also
resonates with international relations research. For Janice
Bially-Mattern (2014), the task of singling out certain emotions, such
as anger (see Heller, Chap. 4) becomes problematic as soon as one
recognizes, as most scholars meanwhile do, that emotions and cognition
are intrinsically interwoven and thus, by extension, hard to keep
conceptually separate. For Ross (2014, pp. 2, 17--19) too, anger, fear
or other emotions are socially constructed and somewhat arbitrary
categories that are not really able to capture the rich complexities of
how affective energies work and circulate between political actors and
communities. Affect can then provide the conceptual tools to understand
how a broad range of psycho-social predispositions produce or mediate
political emotions. Recent research by Lucile Eznack (2013) illustrates
the issues at stake. She shows how historically cultivated affective
dispositions---both positive and negative---can temper or exacerbate
hostilities between nation-states and in doing so influence the nature
of ensuing state behaviour. Juxtaposing US anger towards Britain in the
1956 Suez Crisis with that focused towards the Soviet Union during the
1979--1980 Afghanistan intervention, Eznack shows how anger at an
ally/friend and an adversary/ enemy alters according to the pre-existing
affective dimensions of their relations. Definitional disputes can never
be settled. Nor can concepts ever capture the far more elusive realities
they seek to define. This is why we consciously use the broad term
"emotion." But conceptual disputes provide a way into understanding the
substantive issues at stake, particularly the processes through which
feelings, emotions and affect are both individual and collective. There
is fairly widespread agreement that emotions are not only shaped by
historical and socio-cultural factors but also, and in turn, play a key
role in constituting collective identities and the type of political
values and practices associated with them. But figuring out suitable
methodological approaches for studying these collective emotions is, of
course, a far more difficult and contestable task. Understanding the
Politics of Emotions Beyond Social Scientific Models Most methodological
approaches to the study of emotions in international relations are
social science driven and, while useful, not enough to understand the
collective dimension of emotions. Some of most systematic methodological
debates so far have been carried out in political psychology and focus
on quantitative approaches. They deal, for instance, with the emotional
predispositions of leaders and samples of the population (Marcus, 2002,
pp. 235--236; Small, Learner & Fischhoff, 2006). [Neuroscientific
inquiries]{.underline} [have]{.underline} also [generated important
methodological advances, particularly with regard to the use of
experiments]{.underline}, be they laboratory, survey or field based.
These studies can make more reliable statements on issues of cause and
effect that qualitative emotions methods may be hard-pressed to do (see
Jeffery, 2014b; McDermott, 2011). [While experiments and other
quantitatively measurable methods can yield important insights, there
are nonetheless limits]{.underline} [to how much they can assess. Two
such methodological limits stand out. First, scholars can only measure
how people physiologically or behaviourally react or what they say they
feel. In addition, the respective methods often focus on individuals and
small groups, which do not operate at the same level and in the same way
as larger collectives. Indeed, if the methodological challenges are
significant when investigating individual or interpersonal emotional
dynamics they are far greater when it comes to analysing emotions at the
level of large collectives, such as in national and transnational
spheres]{.underline}. [States]{.underline}, for instance,
[have]{.underline} [no biological mechanisms]{.underline} [and thus
cannot experience emotions directly]{.underline}. How, then, can the
behaviour of states be shaped by emotions? Second, [traditional social
scientific notions of causality are limited in their ability to capture
the political impact of collective emotions]{.underline}. Take an
example from the topic that Sybille Reinke de Buitrago (Chap. 13) and
Gabi Schlag (Chap. 9) engage: the links between images, emotions and
politics. The [emotional dimensions]{.underline} of images [rarely cause
political events]{.underline}, at least not [in a linear
way]{.underline}. This is the case [even in instances where impact is
obvious]{.underline}. Consider the debates on the use of torture in the
war against terror. As early as the summer of 2003, it was publicly
known---in part through reports from Amnesty International---that US
troops were using torture techniques when interrogating prisoners in
Iraq. There was, how- ever, little public interest or discussion about
the issue. Domestic and international outrage only emerged in the spring
of 2004, in direct response to graphic photographs of US torture at the
Abu Ghraib prison facilities. The intensely emotional images of torture
managed to trigger major public discussions in a way that "mere" words
could not. But to attribute causality here is far from straightforward.
This is even more the case with instances where impact is more diffuse,
though equally clear. No method can, for instance, retrace the causal or
even the constitutive links between the highly emotional visual
representations of 9/11, the emergence of a discourse of evil and the
ensuing war on terror. And yet, hardly anybody would question that
images and emotions were key parts of the nature and impact of 9/11.
Indeed, the very attack was designed for maximum visual and emotional
impact. It was meant to do much more than kill physical bodies: the idea
was to create a spectacle that can circulate visually and instil fear.
Rather than speaking of linear causality here, one might use terms like
"discursive causality" (Hansen, 2006, p. 26) or "discursive agency"
(Bleiker, 2000, p. 208). Doing so illuminates how emotions often work
inaudibly but powerfully; over time and across space, by slowly
entrenching--- or gradually challenging---how we feel, view, think of
the socio-political worked around us. Ringmar (Chap. 2) speaks of the
"felt sense," of how feelings influence both cognitive thoughts and
broader political phenomena. Understanding how emotions work in such
indirect ways poses inevitable methodological challenges. But they can
be addressed and overcome. One of the most useful ways of doing so has
been advanced by Jacques Rancière. He speaks of the "distribution of the
sensible," that is, of how in any given society and at any given time,
there are boundaries between what can be felt and not, thought and not
and, as a result, between what is politically possible and not. These
boundaries are arbitrarily but often accepted self-evidently as common
sense (Rancière, 2004, p. 13; see also Rockhill, 2009, pp. 199--200).
Collective emotions are, in this sense, highly political insofar as they
can either entrench existing configurations of sensing, seeing and
thinking, or indeed, they can challenge them. The boundaries between
what is sensible and not sometimes shift rapidly, as in the case of
torture debates, but mostly they evolve gradually as the visual
world---and other representational stimuli---around us evolves.
Multidisciplinary Methods for the Study of Political Emotions Broadening
our understanding of how emotions work politically inevitably also
entails broadening the methodological framework we use to study
emotions. Rather than relying on social science methods alone, we should
complement them with modes of inquiry stemming from the sciences and the
humanities. The latter, for instance, consist of methods applied in,
say, ethnography, architecture, art history, musicology and media
studies. Only a multitude of methods can attempt to stitch together the
intricate and non-linear processes through which emotions shape the
political. Different methods illuminate different dimensions of the
links between emotion and politics. An adequate appreciation of the
political issues at stake is thus likely to emerge only from combining a
broad range of methods. The chapters in this volume offer an impressive
illustration of such an approach. The tools employed here include
phenomenology and psychoanalysis (Ringmar), content analysis (Heller; de
Buitrago), semi-structured interviews (Delori), autoethnography
(Reeves), discourse analysis (Wolf; Koschut), narrative analysis
(Sangar, Clément and Lindemann), audience observation (Schlag);
hermeneutics (Eroukhmanoff and Teles Fazendeiro). [Relying
on]{.underline} such [a broad set of methods]{.underline} [for the study
of political emotions seems commonsensical. In fact, many method
scholars acknowledge the need for pluralism]{.underline} [and recognize
that, by extension, their own approach is a "necessary but not
sufficient methodology"]{.underline} (Van Leeuwen & Jewitt, 2004, p. 5).
A content analysis, for instance, can identify important patterns but
say nothing about the political impact of emotions, just as a survey
experiment can gauge relative impact but offer no knowledge of the
origin or nature of links between emotions and politics. This is why
critical methods scholars argue against analytically separating sensory
domains (Mason & Davies, 2009, pp. 600--601). While commonsensical in
principle, the actual application of a multidisciplinary approach to the
study of emotions in world politics is far more complex and difficult.
Only very few researchers possess the methodological skills to navigate
across the wide range of methods necessary to assess the complexity of
the links between emotions and politics. Scholars who employ, say,
discourse analysis rarely have the skills to conduct large-scale
quantitative surveys. Likewise, researchers who do lab experiments are
not usually equipped to conduct a semiology. These practical challenges
to multidisciplinary research are significant but can be overcome. Extra
training can provide scholars with the skills needed to employ a wider
range of methods. Some of the chapters in this volume offer fantastic
examples of how this can be done successfully. Take the two chapters
that deal with the links between emotions, images and politics. Schlag
(Chap. 9) flags how a multitude of methods, from discourse analysis to
iconology, can be applied across multiple visual sites and modalities:
from the construction of an image to its content to its political
receptions (see Rose, 2008). Buitrago (Chap. 13), likewise, employs
content and visual analysis to great effect, arguing that zigzagging
between them better captures "the complex nature of emotions and their
various expressions and channels." A further challenge to
interdisciplinary work on emotions is linked to a deeply entrenched
antagonistic dualism that continues to separate those advocating
qualitative and quantitative methods. The divide between these
traditions is enforced not only by different methodological trainings,
but also by a range of epistemological assumptions that seem to make
genuine cross-method inquiries difficult. Quantitative methods tend to
be associated with positivist epistemologies while qualitative
approaches are meant to be post-positivist in nature. This is neither
accurate nor useful but, instead, and as Clément and Sangar (Chap. 1)
point out, leads to a "path dependency" that boxes them into "specific
ways of collecting and analysing." There is no reason why, for instance,
discourse analysis could not be combined with quantitative survey
experiments. Only through such unusual methodological combinations can
we hope to understand the politics of emotions across their origin,
history, meaning and causality. Towards a Pluralist Epistemological
Framework The biggest challenge to a truly pluralist approach to the
study emotions and politics is not of a practical but of an
epistemological nature. To use methods as diverse as discourse analysis
and quantitative surveys can only be done if each of these methods is
given the chance to work according to its own logic. A genuinely
interdisciplinary and pluralistic approach needs to abandon the idea
that all methods have to operate according to the same rules and
standards of evidence. To advance such a proposition is to go against
the grain of much of the philosophy of knowledge that drives the social
sciences. Manuel De Landa (2006, pp. 10--11) refers here to totalizing
forms of knowledge. In such systems, each component has to behave
according to an overall logic that structures the movement of parts. To
make sense and fit in, each methodological component of this system has
to operate according to the same principles: those of testable
hypotheses. Methods that do not fit these criteria are seen as
unscientific and illegitimate. This is the logic of aiming for
"generalizable" findings that test "causal relationships" (Heller, Chap.
4). The aim here is to avoid "arbitrary and unsystematic" methods, such
as discourse analysis, and, instead, aim for studies of emotions that
can deliver a "more systematic comparative picture of time and space,
with systematic comparative elements and a more longitudinal perspective
that can show what 'constitute' really entails" (Heller, Chap. 4). Our
suggestions fundamentally depart from such propositions. [We argue for a
heterogeneous combination of seemingly incompatible
methods]{.underline}. [Expressed in other words, multiple methods should
be used even if, or precisely because, they are not compatible with each
other]{.underline}. We draw on assemblage theory and [the]{.underline}
concept of rhizomes (Deleuze & Guattari, 1996) to defend an
[approach]{.underline} that we believe [is both necessary and
controversial: necessary because it is the most convincing way to
understand the complex links between emotions and politics]{.underline};
controversial because doing so breaks with deeply entrenched social
scientific conventions that require each methodological component to
behave according to the same coherent overall logic (De Landa, 2006, pp.
10--11). Assemblages are an alternative to totalities. They offer a
conceptual base for multidisciplinary and methodologically reflective
research. This is the case because assemblages, according to De Landa
(2006, pp. 10--11), are structured by relations of exteriority: the
properties and behaviour of its components neither have to explain the
whole nor fit into its overall logic. [Heterogeneity]{.underline} [is a
key feature here, for each component is both linked and
autonomous]{.underline}. De Buitrago (Chap. 13) appropriately speaks of
completing a "mosaic" of knowledge. Even Heller (Chap. 4), who pushes
for more generalizable proportions, recognizes that "the influence of
emotions is filled with spontaneous expressions of strong emotional
subjectivity." [When we pursue such inquiries into the politics of
emotions we could speak of "messy methods"]{.underline} (Aradau &
Huysmans, 2014, p. 607; Law & Urry, 2004, p. 390). [But messy here does
not mean that individual inquiries cannot be, at the same time,
meticulous, thorough and systematic]{.underline}. Discourse analysis,
for instance, does not necessarily need to be "arbitrary and unsys-
tematic" (Heller, Chap. 4), but can be carried out in as precise a
manner as any other method (see Koschut, Chap. 12; Dunne & Neumann,
2016; Hansen, 2006). The key is to recognize that the criteria by which
methodologies operate are not seen as being independent of their
specific purpose. Once we recognize these issues, methods cannot be
employed or understood without a proper engagement with methodologies.
This point has already been underlined by scholars working on critical
approaches to methods in politics and international relations. John Law
and John Urry (2004, p. 397), Lene Hansen (2006, p. ixi), Linda Tuhiwai
Smith (2012, p. ix), Patrick Jackson (2011, p. 25), Michael Shapiro
(2003, 2013) as well as Claudia Aradau and Jef Huysmans (2014, p. 598)
all stress that methods---that is, the tools we use to embark on
research--- are inevitably intertwined with the strategies that these
methods employ and the context within which they are carried out. The
task of methodologies is to challenge the idea of methods as neutral
techniques and to reflect upon the choices and implications that they
embody (see Clément and Sangar, Chap. 1). Implied---and at time
explicitly articulated---in these positions is the idea that one can
embark on systematic and rigorous research even while one accepts that
there are several and at times even incompatible models of doing so.
Although still fairly controversial in international relations, such
critical positions on methodology are not new. They have long been
debated in the philosophy of science or in quantum and complexity
theory. Consider, just as an example, how Paul Feyerabend (2002, pp. 1,
18, 160) argued decades ago that the numerous procedures that make up
the sciences have no common structure and that, as a result, "successful
research does not obey general standards; it relies now on one trick,
now on another." He presents the violation of existing basic rules as
the very process through which science progresses--- not towards a new
and better paradigm, but towards recognition that science, and the
methods it applies, is always incomplete and bound by its social
context. Conclusion Drawing on the chapters in this volume, we have
tried to outline a multidisciplinary and pluralist framework for the
study of emotions in world politics. To do so requires combining work on
methods (techniques, practices) with reflections on methodologies
(epistemological reflections on the potentials and limits of these
techniques and practices). We argued that [what is needed is not a
systematic theory of emotions, an attempt to fix the parameters of
knowledge once and for all, but a more open-ended search]{.underline}
[for the type of scholarly and political sensibility that could
conceptualize the influence of emotions even where and when it is not
immediately apparent. Numerous intangible but nevertheless important
political dimensions of emotions can be appreciated only if scholars
accept that insight cannot necessarily produce certainty]{.underline},
or at least not the type of knowledge that is objective, measurable and
falsifiable. [Accepting that knowledge about emotions is
inevitably]{.underline} partial and [contingent]{.underline} [does not
mean we cannot evaluate]{.underline} interdisciplinary and [pluralist
research. The key is to recognize that insights into the politics of
emotions should not be evaluated by some a priori standard of reference,
but by their ability to generate new and valuable perspectives on
political puzzles]{.underline}. This process is neither radical nor
unique to the task of assessing ephemeral phenomena, such as emotions.
It applies just as much to the domain of reason. Quentin Skinner is one
of numerous scholars who stress how our judgement of what is reasonable
depends not on some prior set of objective criteria, but on the concepts
we employ to describe what we see or experience as rational (Skinner,
2002, pp. 4, 44). For instance, if examinations of fear can provide us
with explanations of political behaviour that would not have been
possible through other forms of inquiry, then they have made a
contribution to knowledge, even though the so-generated insight may
remain contestable and, ultimately, un-provable. [Once the logic of
totality is forgone, the possibilities for investigating the
significance of emotions in world politics open up. It becomes possible
to combine seemingly incompatible methods]{.underline}, from
ethnographies to semiologies, surveys and interviews to discourse and
content analyses. [The logics according to which they operate do not
necessarily have to be the same, nor do they have to add up to one
coherent whole, for it is precisely through such creative openness that
we can hope to capture the complex ways emotions are intertwined with
world politics.]{.underline}

**Brown 07** (Chris Brown Professor of International Relations and
Convenor of the International Relations Department at the London School
of Economics. Writing in The international political thought of Carl
Schmitt: Terror Liberal War and the Crisis of Global Order pg 56-57)

The term ['humanitarian intervention' is a]{.underline} rather
[unfortunate]{.underline} recent [coinage]{.underline}. It refers to
circumstances where one state or a coalition of states intervenes by
force in the supposedly domestic affairs of another state ostensibly in
the interests of the population of the latter, for example to prevent or
curtail genocide or other gross violations of their human rights. It is
unfortunate because, apart from the fact that the adjective
'humanitarian' in itself raises all sorts of issues that will be
addressed later in this chapter, [it directs attention towards the
motives of the intervener as the key defining quality of this kind of
action]{.underline}, [with the implication that unless the intervening
states are pure at heart the intervention in question will not count as
properly humanitarian. Since]{.underline}, ex hypothesi, [states almost
always act for a variety of reasons, some altruistic, most not, this
kind of purism generally leads to the conclusion that no humanitarian
interventions have taken place, and that the claim of such motivation
always hides some darker intent]{.underline}. [This way of looking at
the issue is]{.underline}, I think, [mistaken]{.underline}. [From the
point of view of the victims of genocide]{.underline} or other forms of
serious oppression[, the motives of their rescuers are not a matter of
immediate importance]{.underline} -- to take one obvious example, [had
the]{.underline} French or [US government]{.underline}s
[acted]{.underline} effectively [to end the genocide in
Rwanda]{.underline} in 1994, [it seems unlikely that those whose lives
had been saved thereby would have worried too much about exactly why
their rescuers acted.]{.underline} In such extreme cases [outcomes are
what matter rather than intentions]{.underline}; indeed, in this
particular case it was precisely because any US action would have had to
have been motivated by altruism, since it had no substantial material
interests in Rwanda, that no such action took place.2 Having made this
point, I will simply assert -- since the scope of this chapter does not
allow me to discuss in detail the facts of each case -- that [there have
been a number of interventions since 1990 where states have used force
in circumstances where action has actually ended]{.underline}, or
curtailed, or prevented [large-scale human rights abuses and where the
motives of the interveners were to bring about this state of affairs,
or, at a minimum, were not inconsistent with this outcome. Such
was]{.underline}, I think, [the case in northern Iraq in 1991, in Bosnia
in 1994/1995, in Kosovo and East Timor in 1999 and, under rather
different circumstances, in Sierra Leone in 2001]{.underline}. This
chapter is devoted to trying to tease out how these actions should be
understood. I have suggested some problems with the term 'humanitarian
intervention', but some would wish to preserve this coinage suitably
shorn of its more implausibly altruistic implications. The term
'humanitarian war' is also sometimes used, and the claim made that this
kind of military action is qualitatively different from previous uses of
military force. This seems plausible, but what does this qualitative
difference amount to? And what principles are appropriate for judging
the morality of this kind of use of force?

### FW: policy focus good

#### Their authors are writing absolute BS to get grant money -- discussing actual policies is valuable

**Rosato and Schuessler 10** -- Sebastian Rosato, Assistant Professor of
Political Science at the University of Notre Dame, and John Schuessler,
Assistant Professor, Texas A&M, "A Realist Foreign Policy for the United
States" *Perspectives on Politics*, vol. 9, no. 4, 2011, pp. 803--819
DOI: 10.1017/S1537592711003963 //KohlW

One reason for this attitude is that [political scientists tend to shy
away from policy relevant work]{.underline}. According to Joseph Nye,
\"[scholars are paying less attention to ques- tions about how their
work relates to the policy world]{.underline}.\"6 [Why academics have
withdrawn to the ivory tower is an open question, but the professions
attitude toward policy work - ranging from indifference to hostility -
is at least partially to blame]{.underline}. \"In many departments,\"
notes Nye, \"**[a focus on policy can hurt ones
career]{.underline}**.\"7 Walt reaches the same conclusion: \"[Policy
relevance is simply not a crite- rion that the academy
values.]{.underline} Indeed, **[there is a clear bias against
it]{.underline}**.\"8 Similarly, Bruce Jentleson and Ely Ratner declare
that \"[academias dominant organizational culture . . . devalues policy
relevance]{.underline}.\"

Our own position is that [political scientists can and should contribute
to policy debates]{.underline}. The reason that [political scientists
can make a valuable contribution]{.underline} is simple, but cannot be
repeated enough: **[theory and pol- icy are inextricably
linked.]{.underline}** Although they may not be self-conscious in their
use of theory, [policy makers fig- ure out what events or factors to
focus on and what policies to pursue based on the theories they find
most convincing]{.underline}. As Walt points out, **[theory is
indispensable to policy]{.underline}** - to the extent that [it helps
decision makers to diagnose their problems, to anticipate events, to
formu- late prescriptions for action]{.underline}, and to evaluate the
results of their policies.10 Thus, **[we have a responsibility as
scholars to foster a robust debate about our preferred theories and
their competitors.]{.underline}** After all, wise policy choices depend
on a vigorous marketplace of ideas.

### Liberalism turn

#### Liberalism necessary to prevent w global conflict, prevent famine, disease to create material change in civil societies -- their analysis conflates humanitarian ethics as political maneuvering

**[Humanitarian intervention has become an important mode and even a
dominant frame of reference for Western political intervention in global
scenes of misfortune, both in cases of armed conflict and natural
disasters and around their more or less direct consequences in the form
of epidemics, famine, physical injury, and emotional trauma. No war is
now without its humanitarian corridors and its humanitarian
workers.]{.underline}** [And no Western military intervention into
another country is now without its justification on humanitarian
grounds]{.underline}.17 Previously the province of nongovernmental
organizations like the Red Cross, MSF, and many others in their wake and
intergovernmental bodies, notably the United Nations High Commission for
Refugees, humanitarian intervention has become a policy of nationstates,
whether because governments are developing their own activity in the
field (France, for example, has had several ministers for humanitarian
aid) or because they delegate it to paragovernmental agencies (such as
the Oxford Committee for Famine Relief \[Oxfam\] in the United Kingdom).
Whatever form it takes[, what appears to be emerging is a humanitarian
government at both the global and the local level, in the camps for
displaced persons there and in the social services for illegal
immigrants and asylum seekers here.18 This is a government that defines
itself through the introduction of morality into politics,]{.underline}
in a so-called New World Order that appears to have succeeded the
Realpolitik of the Cold War. l'intolérable (The Construction of the

government, see Didier Fassin, "Humanitarianism, a Nongovernmental
Government," in Non-governmental Politics, ed. Michel Feher (New York:
Zone Books, 2007), 149 --59. Humanitarianism as a Politics of Life 509 A
common interpretation of this new situation tends to distinguish and to
contrast politics and humanitarianism, declaring that the latter is
gradually replacing the former or even announcing the advent of
humanitarianism and the end of politics]{.underline}**.
**["Humanitarianism is not a political issue and it should remain
separate from political maneuvering," asserts Rony Brauman, a former
president of MSF. Pointing to the renaissance of nongovernmental
humanitarianism during the 1970s and 1980s, at a time when communism's
star was waning, he even sees in this new configuration a sort of
historical fluid mechanics based on the principle of the communicating
vessels: "I]{.underline}**t is as if, during these periods when the
ideological tide is going out, humanitarian action comes to occupy the
space left vacant by politics."19 Agamben offers a more radical version
of this thesis, suggesting **[that "the separation of politics and
humanitarianism that we are witnessing today represents the last phase
of the separation of human rights from civil right.]{.underline}**" For
the Italian philosopher, the image of the refugee becomes "the most
significant sign of bare life in our era," and he sees the refugee camp
as the "biopolitical paradigm." This being the case, [humanitarianism,
insofar as it distances itself from the figure of the nation-state,
abandons the political field.20 However, I believe that the contemporary
world does not become more intelligible viewed in these terms, and one
may doubt whether there exists, in one's own society or in any society,
a space empty of politics or even a space outside politics---all the
more given that these interpretations relegate the dominated and the
excluded to this depoliticized space, leaving the political space to the
dominant and the included]{.underline}. They are thus doubly
problematic---first empirically, for all investigations show that on the
contrary, [forms of political life continue to arise even in the camps,
and second ethically, since this reading appears to reinforce the
domination and exclusion by denying the possibility of a political life
to those who are subjected to them in practice.21 Other avenues
therefore need to be explored. In fact everything suggests that rather
than become separate, humanitarianism and politics are tending to
merge---in governmental, intergovernmental, and nongovernmental
spheres.]{.underline} In France at least three former presidents or vice
presidents of MSF have become ministers; some have been elected to
political office, others have entered the civil service at high
levels---not only in the traditional 19. See Rony Brauman, L'action
humanitaire (Humanitarian Action) (Paris: Flammarion, 2000), 61. He
recognizes, however, that "humanitarianism cannot be considered
apolitical" (61). 20. See Agamben, Homo sacer: Le pouvoir souverain et
la vie nue, 145. 21. See Liisa Malkki, Purity and Exile: Violence,
Memory, and National Cosmology among Hutu Refugees in Tanzania (Chicago:
Chicago University Press, 1995); and Michel Agier, Aux bords du monde,

2002). Public Culture 510 aid sector, but also in health and social
welfare. Conversely, former ministers of social affairs or of health
have become presidents of Action contre la faim (Action Against Hunger)
and the French Red Cross**[. Thus one is seeing a humanitarianization of
national health and social policy and a politicization of humanitarian
organizations. At the international level the process is even more
marked, and one sees how, particularly since the Rwandan genocide, with
the French army's belated Operation Turquoise, Western military action
in arenas of disaster or conflict is conducted under the banner of
humanitarianism, and increasingly insistent attempts are made to bring
nongovernmental organizations on board.22 When they intervened in Kosovo
and Iraq, the governments allied to the North Atlantic Treaty
Organization (NATO) and to the United States, respectively, spoke of the
humanitarian imperative, thus confirming that the legitimacy of
interventions was being displaced from the legal sphere]{.underline}**
(since they did not have the support of the United Nations) to the moral
sphere (the defense of human rights and even, more restrictively and
more specifically, the humanitarian right). **[Thus one can speak both
of the humanitarianization of international crisis management and of the
politicization of the nongovernmental humanitarian field. Rather than a
dissociation, what one is actually seeing is increasingly a merging of
politics and humanitarianism.]{.underline}**

#### **Utilitarian metric is key -- valueing all life as equal is fair for a liberal analysis** 

**Yurtoglu 18** (Yurtoğlu, N. (2018).

In effect this equality does not long withstand the test of the facts.
**[The hostage taking during the first days of the U.S. intervention
brought the humanitarian ideal back to harsh reality.]{.underline}** The
abduction of two team members paralyzed not only their four colleagues
but also the entire organization, which initially halted all activity
and then resolved to withdraw the mission.31 On the Iraqi side, no life
was saved; not one injured person was treated. [Above all, it became
clear that the organization itself could not countenance risking lives:
when the danger shifted from the hypothetical to the real, the
intervention was suspended in order to avoid risk to the staff abducted,
and when the two members were released by their abductors, at a time
when other aid organizations were setting to work in the vast arena of a
far from pacified country, the French section of MSF left Iraq, arguing
that the health situation did not after all give cause for concern and
that conditions of operation could in no way be considered secure. The
trauma of the abduction effectively highlighted the contradictions
inherent in a declared politics of risking lives that did not hold up in
the face of real danger]{.underline}. The case of Iraq is exemplary.
Each time a member of a humanitarian organization has been taken hostage
in recent years, in Colombia or the Caucasus, the mission in question
has been wholly diverted from its initial goals and has concentrated on
a single aim---saving the abducted companion. Moreover the protagonists
in conflicts are well aware of the Western world's sensitivity to
hostage taking and in some regions of the world take cynical advantage
of it, unconcerned about the difference between soldiers and aid
workers, private security guards and foreign 31. In the organization's
internal critical journal, significantly called DazibAG (no. 125
\[2003\]: 27), François Calas, the head of the MSF team in Iraq and one
of those who had been abducted by the Iraqi police, publicly expressed
his frustration as the organization left the country: ["The decision
taken by the French section to leave Baghdad seemed to me very
precipitate and has been justified after the fact on fallacious grounds.
Rather than qualifying the crisis, we disqualified it.]{.underline}
Ironically, one could say that we've come full circle and because we
failed to anticipate events, haste prevailed from beginning to end of
our intervention." **[Humanitarianism as a Politics of Life 515
journalists, and forcing states and nongovernmental organizations into
protracted and difficult negotiations in which the value of the lives of
those who have been abducted is assessed and translated into cash terms,
often very specifically and precisely.32 But even within this context,
even among the members of humanitarian organizations, not all lives have
the same value]{.underline}**. The most common distinction MSF makes in
its missions (like all foreign organizations, whether involved in aid or
development) is between "expatriates" and "nationals." Expatriates who
come almost exclusively from Western countries are volunteers of the
organization. Nationals are local agents who are considered as mere paid
employees. This distinction, which is seen as simply an operational
matter, not only involves huge differences in salary (and also
contractual terms, since many local agents are recruited for limited
periods, sometimes paid by the day) and in rights (particularly in
decision and voting processes) but also has consequences regarding
social and political protection. On the one hand, in the case of serious
illness the medical coverage for expatriates is equivalent to that of
the French system, while for nationals there is usually limited or no
health insurance**[. Even when MSF was involved in an ambitious
international program to promote antiretroviral drugs, its own local
agents suffering from AIDS, particularly in Africa, were not receiving
treatment.33 On the other hand, when violent disturbances arose, while
expatriates were usually spared, nationals enjoyed no institutional
immunity. One inquiry reveals that almost six of every ten deaths among
aid workers over the past twenty years were of local agents, but this is
certainly a substantial underestimate, particularly with regard to
Rwanda, as many of the locally employed staff did not appear on aid
organizations' staff lists.34 In 32. The financial conditions of Arjan
Erkel's release in Dagestan in 2004 have been publicly exposed, with the
Dutch government claiming €1 million from the Swiss section of MSF to
reimburse the ransom it paid to the kidnappers.]{.underline}** See
Philippe Ryfman, "Humanitarian Action on Trial," Messages: Journal
interne de Médecins sans frontières, no. 137 (2005): 16. 33. The
decision to give free antiretroviral drugs to national staff was finally
reached by the board of directors in 2003. Nevertheless, Bradol notes
that during his field visits, local staff members "were not usually
aware of this decision." See MSF, "Rapport moral 2003." 34. The
epidemiological study is Mani Sheik, Maria Isabel Gutierrez, Paul
Bolton, Paul Spiegel, Michel Thieren, and Gilbert Burnham, "Deaths among
Humanitarian Workers," British Medical Journal 321 (2000): 166 -- 68.
Between 1985 and 1998, 382 deaths were reported among staff of United
Nations and nongovernmental bodies, of which almost a third occurred
during the genocide in Rwanda. However, Bradol, who conducted a mission
for MSF in 1994, comments: "**[If we asked humanitarian organizations
for the list of their employees who died during the genocide, 90% would
be unable to give it. And this gives an indication of what has or has
not been done to help people when they really needed
help]{.underline}**." See Bradol, "La commémoration amnésique des
humanitaires" ("The Public Culture 516 other words, even within these
institutions---as in development and cooperative organizations,
too---distinctions are set up between foreign staff, almost always
Western and white, and local employees. **[These distinctions, in
addition to the material advantages conferred on foreign staff, are
augmented by much more serious disadvantages that for the local staff,
concern their very survival, whether they are endangered by illness or
war. The AIDS epidemic on the one hand, and the Rwandan genocide on the
other, cruelly exposed the workings of this process of exclusive
categorization. Thus, within the humanitarian arena itself hierarchies
of humanity are passively established but rarely identified for what
they are---politics of life that at moments of crisis, result in the
formation of two groups, those whose status protects their sacred
character and those whom the institutions may sacrifice against their
will. The protagonists in conflict are well aware of this distinction
when they abduct people. They know that only foreigners have market
value. Their compatriots are usually executed, as was the case in August
2006 for seventeen Sri Lankan Action contre la faim humanitarian workers
killed by military forces.]{.underline}**

### Liberalism defense

#### **empirically wrong---wars waged in the name of liberal humanitarianism have been far less bloody.**

**Brown 07** -- Professor of International Relations at the London
School of Economics and Political Science (Chris, "The International
Political Thought of Carl Schmitt: Terror, Liberal War, and the Crisis
of Global Order" 2007, Fellow in International Relations at the School
of Oriental and African Studies, University of London, and also teaches
Inter- national Relations at the University 'L'Orientale' in Naples,
Italy p. 67)

[**Schmitt's normative position is impossible to sympathize with**, but
the clarity with which he develops his argument is
admirable]{.underline}, as is his recognition of the changes in world
order that took place in the seventeenth and again in the twentieth
centuries. [**It is not necessary to share in Schmitt's nostalgia** for
the jus publicum Europaeum in order **to admire the precision with which
he delineates its characteristics**]{.underline}. He presents an account
of the European states-system which is rather more compelling than the
version of international society associated with English School writers
(Butterfield and Wight 1966; Bull 1977), or with the much less clearly
defined a-historical world of modern neo-realist theorists (Waltz 1979;
Baldwin 1993). The Nomos of the Earth is a book that should be on the
reading list of any international relations theorist. Still, [**one
might admire, but one should not endorse.** The picture of the world
that Schmitt presents invites us to accept that the 'humanized wars' of
the modern European states]{.underline}-system represent [not simply in
practice, but also in theory, an advance over]{.underline} the ['just
wars']{.underline} that preceded them, and the 'humanitarian wars' that
have followed them. That these humanized wars were generally less
terrible than their predecessors and successors is an empirical
judgement that can be contested, but that [the attempt to control and
limit the role of violence in human affairs is necessarily futile and
counter-productive is a normative position that **deserves to be
rejected**]{.underline}**.** Ultimately, [**Schmitt's critique** of the
notion of the Just War **rests upon a shaky empirical base and an
undesirable normative position**]{.underline} -- but it still represents
one of the most compelling critiques of the notion available. Schmitt's
critique of the Just War is not a critique that is based on
contingencies -- how Just Warriors behave -- but on fundamentals. He
takes us to the heart of the problem and demonstrates that both the
medieval Christian and the modern, liberal, legal/moral account of Just
War are unacceptable -- but if we believe that it is desirable to reduce
the role of violence in human affairs this should simply stimulate us to
rework the relevant categories to try to produce a more viable account
of the circumstances under which the resort to force might be justified.

### Perm

#### a productive use of their criticism requires holding the space of the political open to multiple perspectives and approaches.

**Thorup, 06** -- Ph.D. dissertation @ the Institute of Philosophy and
the History of Ideas (Mikkel, January, 2006, "In Defence of Enmity --
Critiques of Liberal Globalism," p. 39-40)

This text is mainly about the potential dangers of the liberal approach
to politics. But this is not turning it into an unqualified defence or
advocacy of the conflict perspective. As an illustration of the dangers
of what we can call 'manichean decisionism', I'll briefly mention an
article on Schmitt's concept of the political by Bernard Willms (1991),
in which he classifies two traditions of political thinking: [political
realism]{.underline} and political fictionalism (try to guess his
position!). Political fictionalism "subordinates politics to 'higher'
principles or 'truths'", whereas political realism is "the permanently
repeated attempt to conceive of politics as what in fact it is" (1991:
371). It is a (unintended) caricature on the self-professed realist's
sense of superiority because of their courage and ability to confront
the really real reality: Political fictionalisms help to satisfy man's
need for consolation, edification, hope and sense, tending to veil real
conditions of government. The political realist seeks to identify
necessities -- irrespective of their severity and without consideration
for any need for deceit under the existing government. (1991: 371-2)
This [is]{.underline} the kind of [reductionism of the
political]{.underline} that I want to avoid. [Working with Schmitt's
categories and critiques entails a danger of falling in the]{.underline}
(very self-comforting) [trap of proclaiming only one true]{.underline}
and 'hard' [version of the political and]{.underline} of [dismissing all
others as]{.underline} fictions and [wishful thinking]{.underline}.
Primacy of the political becomes primacy of foreign policy, organized
violence etc. [The political is effectively reduced to a few areas --
which is just what liberalism is criticized for doing. The friend/enemy
distinction]{.underline} or conflictuality [may often be a dominant
feature of the political, but that is not to say that it is]{.underline}
then [the political.]{.underline} As Ankersmit (1996: 127) says, that
would be the same as making the unavoidability of marital disagreements
into the very foundation of marriage as such. I want instead to argue
that the [political contains a number of styles, sides,
variants]{.underline} (or whatever one want to call it) that can very
loosely and ideal-typically be grouped in two main forms: Politics as
conflict and politics as technique, where neither of them can claim
exclusivity. So, I want to avoid a sterile discussion of what the
political really is. My interest is far more the various styles of the
political that are operative in political debate. Schmitt and many other
conflict theoreticians do not see the other face of the political as
anything other than a 'secondary', 'dependent', 'corrupted' expression
of politics. Liberals tend to exclude politics as conflict, confining it
to other spaces in time or geography, as aberration or relapse. What the
two [concepts]{.underline} each do is to [highlight a certain aspect of
the politica]{.underline}l, and my claim is that they are elements of a
unity. There's a certain pendulum process at work and I'll give that a
number of expressions, which basically states the not very controversial
thought that [the political world is located between the extremes of
repetition and break, stability and change, regime and
revolution]{.underline}, or, as I prefer to call them, [technique and
conflict]{.underline}. Depoliticization, then, is a way to describe the
attempts to or methods of making repetition, stability and regime
universal and eternal -- to place areas, practices and actors beyond
change and critique -- whereas repoliticization describes the opposite
movement -- disruption, change, recreation of the entire social space.

### Scapegoating/mimeticism = wrong

#### The scapegoating mechanism is just an easy explanation of the world to make you sound smarter and justify religion

**Landy 12** -- Joshua, Andrew B. Hammond Professor in French Language,
Literature and Civilization at Stanford University, "Deceit, Desire, and
the Literature Professor: Why Girardians Exist" Republics of Letters: A
Journal for the Study of Knowledge, Politics, and the Arts 3, no. 1
(September 15, 2012)
<https://arcade.stanford.edu/rofl/deceit-desire-and-literature-professor-why-girardians-exist>
//KohlW

To be fair, [very few people have been taken in]{.underline}, all in
all, [by the Girardian theory]{.underline} and method; [as Girard
himself recognizes, **actual anthropologists**]{.underline}
([and]{.underline}, one might add, actual
**[psychologists]{.underline}**) [have not paid him that much
attention]{.underline}.72 [Still]{.underline}, as we saw at the outset,
[he has a number of admirers in high places]{.underline}. I am sure it
helps that he writes truly beautifully, with a wonderful combination of
clarity, punch, and systematic rigor. I am also sure it helps that he is
an extremely nice person. (I've met him personally, and can attest to
this.) But an election to the Académie française and a creation of an
institute require more of an explanation than that. What, then, shall we
say?

It seems to me that [his followers have four reasons for being so
passionate about his work]{.underline}. **[One group is primarily
attracted by its religious dimension, in the hope perhaps that mimetic
theory can bring new souls to Christianity]{.underline}**. [That is a
pious wish explicitly expressed by Girard]{.underline},73 [and it may
seem to draw some plausibility from the fact that he himself, as he
tells us, converted to Christianity because of his discovery of the
scapegoat mechanism]{.underline}.74 (Fascinatingly, mind you---and to my
knowledge, no one has noticed this before---[that]{.underline} last
[claim is very unlikely to be true. Girard converted in
1959]{.underline},75 [while working on Deceit, Desire, and the Novel, a
book he published in 1961; while there is plenty of Christianity in that
book]{.underline},76 [there is not a **single scapegoat**]{.underline},
and [Violence and the Sacred, which contains plenty of scapegoats, was
published some **eleven years later**]{.underline}.) What is more, the
Girardian theory appears to offer an answer to the question why the
messiah has to come twice, not just once---or to put it another way, why
the First Coming appears to have changed so little.77

[A second group of followers hails from literature departments. Such
followers delight, I imagine, in the combination of negativity and
hyperbole]{.underline}---[that promise to provide a single unified
explanation]{.underline} of all phenomena while striking the proper
world-weary, Gauloise-smoking, leatherjacket-wearing pose---that has
been such catnip for critics over the years. [And they probably also
enjoy the ease with which the Girardian theory can be applied to works
of fiction]{.underline}. [All you need to do is to find, or indeed
invent, a "triangular" relationship among characters, then append
Girard's magic name, and hey presto, you have yourself an
article]{.underline}. The world of literary theory, like the world of
fashion, is one of those places where mimetic mechanisms do function;
with ironic appropriateness, the primary reason that people drop the
name "Girard" is that other people do.78

[The third, and most depressing, group comprises those who use the dread
word "**generative**" when speaking about Girard's
approach]{.underline}. Such people **[do not care whether a given theory
is true or false; all they care about is whether it spawns "interesting"
readings]{.underline}**. Now I'm prepared to concede that a reading of
Hamlet according to which the main character has no desires of his own
is an interesting one. But I think a reading of Hamlet according to
which the main character is riddled with body thetans is an even more
interesting one. (It has rockets! and aliens!) [Generative brigade, what
I said about Scientology was for you. If you wish to rule Scientology
out of court]{.underline} (and I tend to think you do), [it is not on
the grounds of its generativity but on the grounds of its
**accuracy**]{.underline}; and you should, it seems to me, start
applying the same standards to everything else.

[There is, however, a fourth reason for taking an interest in
Girard]{.underline}, and I believe it has been the single most
influential. This reason can be simply stated: [Girardian doctrine is a
theory of everything, **on the cheap**]{.underline}. It's one of those
systems that make **[you feel as though you know everything about
everything while in fact requiring you to know almost nothing about
anything]{.underline}**; it's enough to "know" the four stages mentioned
above and [bingo, you have an explanation for the stock market crash,
the evils of capitalism, and your neighbor's ugly divorce]{.underline}.

condemnations of people like Frazer and Auerbach and Plato80---not to

### Realism turn 

#### Their totalizing claims cannot be applied to domestic politics, structure, economic, sociological issues with the principle of international relations which explains the intricacies of realism -- prefer it to sustain nation state diplomacy and stability while criticizing the notion of liberalism -- best to prevent global war

As a result, the IR discipline has been divided into two main strands:
traditional or non-positivist and scientific or positivist
(neo-positivist). At a later stage the third strand: post-positivism has
been added. The traditionalists raise normative questions and engage
with history, philosophy and law. The scientists or positivists stress a
descriptive and explanatory form of inquiry, rather than a normative
one. They have established a strong presence in the field. Already by
the mid-1960s, the majority of American students in international
relations were trained in quantitative research, game theory, and other
new research techniques of the social sciences. This, along with the
changing international environment, had a significant effect on the
discipline. **[The realist assumption was that the state is the key
actor in international politics, and that relations among states are the
core of actual international relations.]{.underline}** However, with the
receding of the Cold War during the 1970s, one could witness the growing
importance of international and non-governmental organizations, as well
as of multinational corporations. This development led to a revival of
idealist thinking, which became known as neoliberalism or pluralism.
**[While accepting some basic assumptions of realism, the leading
pluralists, Robert Keohane and Joseph Nye, have proposed the concept of
complex interdependence to describe this more sophisticated picture of
global politics.]{.underline}** They would argue that there can be
progress in international relations and that the future does not need to
look like the past. The realist response came most prominently from
Kenneth N. Waltz**[, who reformulated realism in international relations
in a new and distinctive way. In his book Theory of International
Politics, first published in 1979, he responded to the liberal challenge
and attempted to cure the defects of the classical realism of Hans
Morgenthau with his more scientific approach, which has became known as
structural realism or neorealism]{.underline}**. Whereas Morgenthau
rooted his theory in the struggle for power, [which he related to human
nature, Waltz made an effort to avoid any philosophical discussion of
human nature, and set out instead to build a theory of international
politics analogous to microeconomics.]{.underline} **[He argues that
states in the international system are like firms in a domestic economy
and have the same fundamental interest: to survive. "Internationally,
the environment of states' actions, or the structure of their system, is
set by the fact that some states prefer survival over other ends
obtainable in the short run and act with relative efficiency to achieve
that end]{.underline}**" (93). Waltz maintains that by paying attention
to the individual state, and to ideological, moral and economic issues,
both traditional liberals and classical realists make the same mistake.
They fail to develop a serious account of the international system---one
that can be abstracted from the wider socio-political domain. Waltz
acknowledges that such an abstraction distorts reality and omits many of
the factors that were important for classical realism. It does not allow
for the analysis of the development of specific foreign policies.
However, it also has utility. Notably, it assists in understanding [the
primary determinants of international politics. To be sure, Waltz's
neorealist theory cannot be applied to domestic politics. It cannot
serve to develop policies of states concerning their international or
domestic affairs. His theory helps only to explain why states behave in
similar ways despite their different forms of government and diverse
political ideologies]{.underline}, and why, despite their growing
interdependence, the overall picture of international relations is
unlikely to change. According to Waltz, the uniform behavior of states
over centuries can be explained by **[the constraints on their behavior
that are imposed by the structure of the international system. A
system's structure is defined first by the principle by which it is
organized, then by the differentiation of its units, and finally by the
distribution of capabilities (power) across units. Anarchy, or the
absence of central authority, is for Waltz the ordering principle of the
international system]{.underline}**. The units of the international
system are states. Waltz recognizes the existence of non-state actors,
but dismisses them as relatively unimportant. Since all states want to
survive, and anarchy presupposes a self-help system in which each state
has to take care of itself, there is no division of labor or functional
differentiation among them. While functionally similar, they are
nonetheless distinguished by their relative capabilities (the power each
of them represents) to perform the same function. Consequently, Waltz
sees power and state behavior in a different way from the classical
realists. For Morgenthau power was both a means and an end, and rational
state behavior was understood as simply the course of action that would
accumulate the most power. In contrast, neorealists assume that the
fundamental interest of each state is security and would [therefore
concentrate on the distribution of power. What also sets neorealism
apart from classical realism is methodological rigor and scientific
self-conception]{.underline} (Guzinni 1998, 127--128). Waltz insists on
empirical testability of knowledge and on falsificationism as a
methodological ideal, which, as he himself admits, can have only a
limited application in international relations. **[The distribution of
capabilities among states can vary; however, anarchy, the ordering
principle of international relations, remains unchanged. This has a
lasting effect on the behavior of states that become socialized into the
logic of self-he]{.underline}**lp. Trying to refute neoliberal ideas
concerning the effects of interdependence, Waltz identifies two reasons
why the anarchic international system limits cooperation: insecurity and
unequal gains. In the context of anarchy, each state is uncertain about
the intentions of others and is afraid that the possible gains resulting
from cooperation may favor other states more than itself, and thus lead
it to dependence on others. "States do not willingly place themselves in
situations of increased dependence. In a self-help system,
considerations of security subordinate economic gain to political
interest." (Waltz 1979, 107). Because of its theoretical elegance and
methodological rigor, neorealism has become very influential within the
discipline of international relations. In the eyes of many scholars,
Morgenthau's realism has come to be seen as anachronistic---"an
interesting and important episode in the history of thinking about the
subject, no doubt, but one scarcely to be seen as a serious contribution
of the rigorously scientific theory" (Williams 2007, 1). However, while
initially gaining more acceptance than classical realism, neorealism has
also provoked strong critiques on a number of fronts.

Theories." Foreign Policy, no. 110, 1998, pp. 29--46. JSTOR,

**[Realism was the dominant theoretical tradition throughout the Cold
War. It depicts international affairs as a struggle for power among
self- interested states and is generally pessimistic about the prospects
for eliminating conflict and war. Realism dominated in the Cold War
years because it provided simple but powerful explanations for war,
alliances, imperialism, obstacles to cooperation, and other
international phenom- ena, and because its emphasis on competition was
consistent with the central features of the American-Soviet
rivalry.]{.underline}** Realism is not a single theory, of course, and
realist thought evolved considerably throughout the Cold War.
\"Classical\" realists such as Hans Morgenthau and Reinhold Niebuhr
believed that **[states, like human beings, had an innate desire to
dominate others, which led them to fight wars. Morgenthau also stressed
the virtues of the classical, multipolar, balance-of-power system and
saw the bipolar rivalry between the Unit- ed States and the Soviet Union
as especially dangerous.]{.underline}** By contrast, the \"neorealist\"
theory advanced by Kenneth Waltz ignored human nature and focused on the
effects of the international system. [For Waltz, the international
system consisted of a number of great powers, each seeking to survive.
Because the system is anarchic (i.e., there is no central authority to
protect states from one another), each state has to survive on its
own.]{.underline} Waltz argued [that this condition would lead weaker
states to balance against, rather than bandwagon with, more powerful
rivals.]{.underline} And contrary to Morgenthau, he claimed that
bipolarity was more stable than multipolarity. An important refinement
to realism was the addition of offense- defense theory, as laid out by
Robert Jervis, George Quester, and Stephen Van Evera. These scholars
argued that war was more likely when states could conquer each other
easily. When defense was easier than offense, however, security was more
plentiful, incentives to expand declined, and cooperation could blossom.
**[And if defense had the advantage, and states could distinguish
between offensive and defensive weapons, then states could acquire the
means to defend themselves without threatening others, thereby dampening
the effects of anarchy. For these \"defensive\" realists, states merely
sought to survive and great powers could guarantee their security by
forming balancing alliances and choosing defensive military
postures]{.underline}** (such as retaliatory nuclear forces). Not
surprisingly, Waltz and most other neorealists believed that the United
States was extremely secure for most of the Cold War. Their SPRING 1998

International Relations principle fear was that it might squander its
favorable position by adopt- ing an overly aggressive foreign policy.
Thus, by the end of the Cold War, realism had moved away from
Morgenthau\'s dark brooding about human nature and taken on a slightly
more optimistic tone. [Liberalism The principal challenge to realism
came from a broad family of liber- al theories. One strand of liberal
thought argued that economic inter- dependence would discourage states
from using force against each other because warfare would threaten each
side\'s prosperity. A second strand, often associated with President
Woodrow Wilson, saw the spread of democracy as the key to world peace,
based on the claim that democratic states were inherently more peaceful
than authoritarian states. A third, more recent theory argued that
international institutions such as the International Energy Agency and
the Inter- national Monetary Fund could **help overcome selfish state
behavior, mainly by encouraging states to forego immediate gains for the
greater benefits of enduring cooperation. Although some liberals flirted
with the idea that new transnational actors, especially the
multinational corporation, were gradually encroaching on the power of
states, liberalism generally saw states as the central players in
international affairs. All liberal theories implied that cooperation was
more pervasive than even the defensive version of real- ism allowed, but
each view offered a different recipe for promoting it**]{.underline}

### Use of Schmitt bad 

#### The friend enemy distinction cannot be separated from Nazism 

**Huysmans 99** (Jef, London Centre of International Relations at the
University of Kent, "Know your Schmitt: a godfather of truth and the
spectre of Nazism," Review of International Studies, p 323--328,
<https://oro.open.ac.uk/17244/1/download.pdf)>

In a recent article in the Review of International Studies Hans-Karl
Pichler argues that Hans Morgenthau's intellectual universe was
saturated by 'typically European philosophical problems' which he
transferred to an American political context.1 [He shows this by looking
at how Morgenthau tried to overcome the value determinacy of social
science, as pointed out by Weber, by grounding his political realist
theory in a Schmittean understanding of the political, which defines
war---**the friend/enemy distinction**---as the essence of the political
and founds it anthropologically in the evil, dangerous nature of human
beings. I have a problem with the article because Schmitt emerges as
just a serious political theorist, which he indeed was. But **he was
also more than an important political theorist. He was a member of the
Nazi party** between 1933 and 1936 **explicitly providing legal
justifications for the Nazi regime and its policies,** thus becoming for
some the Kronjurist of the Nazis]{.underline}. In that period also
**[anti-Semitic references started appearing in his work]{.underline}**.
Since then **[his name and work have carried the spectre of Nazism and
by implication of the Holocaust with them]{.underline}**. This spectre
is nowhere sensed in Pichler's analysis. It does not seem to have any
grip on Pichler's narrative. I think this is unfortunate because I
believe **[this spectre should always haunt any invoking of Schmitt or
Schmittean understandings of the political]{.underline}**. [The reason
is not to silence discussions about his understanding of the political,
but rather to render normative questions about the ethico-political
project his concept of the political incorporates as the kernel of any
working with or on Schmitt's ideas]{.underline}. Losing the spectre in
meta-theoretical puzzles and a history of ideas explicitly, Schmitt's
choice for the Nazis from the substance of his political theory. For
example, biographical evidence and substantial differences between
Schmitt's theory and the Nazi ideology have been used to conclude that
Schmitt was an opportunist using the Nazis to secure his career or that
he was simply misled by the Nazis.4 In comparison to this example,
Pichler's path is more implicit but not necessarily less effective in
losing [the haunting spectre of Nazism in the retrieval of Schmitt's
work]{.underline}. Pichler's implicit rehabilitation is not a result of
the substance of his argument but of the way in which he introduces
Schmitt in his analysis of Morgenthau's political realism. He inserts
Schmitt's political theory in a framework dominated by an
epistemological question: The aim of this article is to understand why
and how Morgenthau, in Politics among Nations, throws the Weberian
limitations on the objectivity of the social sciences overboard and
indulges in absolute statements.5 The genre within which his
interpretation develops is largely a history of ideas. He renders the
political theory of Morgenthau intelligible by looking at how it relates
to the ideas of two godfathers of 'truth' in the history of political
and social theory. Morgenthau's contribution to this history consists of
trying to establish political realism as a social science which tells
the truth about the political and avoids the pit- falls created by the
value determination of social theory. He uses a Schmittean understanding
of the political to do this. The international political refers to an
emergency situation in which the survival of the state is at stake and
which has its origin in the evil, i.e. dangerous, nature of human
beings. In this situation the state faces the choice of surviving or
perishing. The only way to survive is to maximise power. Consequently,
value questions about the definition of good or right are subsumed under
the necessity to maximise power to protect the survival of the state.6
This is a well-known story. Pichler's contribution consists of
emphasising the importance of Schmitt's concept of the political for
establishing the truth value of this realist theory of international
politics.7 To support his view Pichler introduces among others
biographical data, such as Morgenthau's recording of his meeting with
Carl Schmitt,8 which reveal a relatively intense relation between
Morgenthau and Schmitt. Introducing Schmitt's work by means of a history
of ideas shaped around an epistemological puzzle considerably limits the
possibility of incorporating the shadow of the Holocaust and Nazism in
the story. Let's discuss first the limiting effect of the
metatheoretical dimension. Since the 1980s---that is, following on from
the interparadigm debate---theoretical debates have been saturated by
ontological questions about the nature of international being and
epistemological questions about the validity of knowledge.9 The 2􏰀2
matrix of Hollis and Smith which relates the epistemological opposition
between explanation and understanding to an onto- logical opposition
between holism and individualism, and Keohane's opposition between
rationalism and reflectivism are among the most well-known boxing tools
in this debate.10 Although the metatheoretical perspective has certainly
enriched the debates in IR, it has also squeezed normative questions out
of the main picture. As Guzzini has recently argued, The
meta-theoretical debate of the last decade did, however, further remove
normative thought from the criteria which characterize theoretical
schools. This does not contradict the fact that normative theories have
seen a remarkable comeback in recent years. But they appear in a
different academic category altogether, which is something for
specialists and their journals, but not for International Relations at
large.11 As Guzzini states, this does not mean that normative questions
cannot be raised. Pichler, for example, touches upon the normative
dimensions of Morgenthau's work when he deals with the question why
Morgenthau 'argues so forcefully for the preservation of the state'.12
But, they are not the kernel of his discourse. They appear after the
metatheoretical discussion and are actually not really integrated into
it. In that sense, one could argue that normative questions have a
secondary status in Pichler's work. Moreover, supporting the
preservation of the state as a moral position is not really the most
interesting element of the ethico-political position of Schmittean
political realism. The more interesting question is what is the nature
and the status of the state that is to be preserved and how does the
state emerge in the Schmittean universe?13 Such a perspective would have
to include reflections on the aestheticisation of politics and violence
embedded in a vitalist critique of the enlightenment inspired by
Nietzsche and Kierkegaard, for example.14 [It would also have to engage
with Schmitt's view of modernity, his enmity towards liberalism and the
political theology of despair which is an important basis of his
critique of liberalism.15 Beside the metatheoretical perspective, a
history of ideas also limits the possibility of retrieving the
ethico-political questions of Schmitt's legacy.]{.underline} A history
of ideas looks at the succession of ideas and their mutual
fertilisation. Therefore it is not the preferred genre if one is
interested in integrating ideas in the intellectual and political
environment for the purpose of spelling out the practical significance
of the political theory. Consequently[, a history of ideas runs the risk
of losing the importance of Schmitt's political choice in
1933]{.underline}. [It is precisely this choice which grounds the
imperative for a critical response to any retrieval of Schmitt's ideas.
**Reducing this choice to an accidental event separates it from the
development of Schmitt's interpretation of the political and therefore
makes it easier to represent Schmitt as a major political theorist
offering excellent insights in the nature of the political while being
silent about the spectre of Nazism** and the tough ethico- political
questions it instigates.]{.underline}

#### **Schmitt's work can only be separated from Nazism by accepting the terms of liberalism -- this contradicts and undermines his entire political project.**

**Zhang, 04** -- Professor of Comparative Literature and Chinese and
Chair of Department of East Asian Studies at New York University
(Xudong, 2004, Cultural Critique, No. 58, "Multiplicity or
Heterogeneity? The Cultural-Political Paradox in the Age of
Globalization," p. 45)

But [the]{.underline} intellectual usefulness of [Schmitt]{.underline}
in today\'s critique of liberal imperialism goes only so far. Whereas
his description of the historically concrete processes of becoming
political boast conceptual clarity and is often dialectic in nature, his
[critique does not go beyond]{.underline} the confines of [liberal
ideology but rather constitutes a practice of its fundamental
assumptions]{.underline}. [This is indicated by his desire to define the
political as an autonomous domain of human affairs]{.underline}, where
it can be [sheltered from]{.underline} the concrete entanglement of
economic, [social]{.underline}, religious, and cultural [determinations
to reach its ontological purity]{.underline} and intensity. Not
surprisingly, [during]{.underline} the period of postwar German
[denazification]{.underline}, when forced to clarify the implicit or
explicit ties between his legal and political philosophy to the Third
Reich, [Schmitt defiantly]{.underline} and confidently [declared that
his analysis of]{.underline} the working of [the political is able to
withstand]{.underline} all conceptual and scholarly
[scrutiny]{.underline}. In the end, and in a way more complicated than
merely cynical, [Schmitt]{.underline} mobilized and [deployed liberal
values such as the autonomy and apoliticality of scholarly and
intellectual work to defend his]{.underline} own [writings, which are
antiliberal and political]{.underline} in nature. [Such a circle of
hermeneutics calls into question the limit of the Schmittian concept of
the political, above all his friend and enemy distinction, as
autonomous, existential, and totalistic.]{.underline}

#### **Schmitt is a Nazi apologist, his argument that liberalism causes atrocities is an attempt to explain away Nazi war crimes.**

**Brown 07** (Chris Brown Professor of International Relations and
Convenor of the International Relations Department at the London School
of Economics. Writing in The international political thought of Carl
Schmitt: Terror Liberal War and the Crisis of Global Order pg 63)

Most of the rest of this chapter addresses this task, but first there
are one or two preliminary features of Schmitt's critique which need to
be examined, specifically Schmitt's politics and his rather selective
use of historical materials. As to the former[, it has become somewhat
bad form to refer to Schmitt's leanings towards Nazism]{.underline}, in
much the same way that it is considered bad form to refer to Heidegger's
rather briefer ﬂirtation with the Nazis, [but it has to be said that
Schmitt's quasi-Nazi take on the world is not without significance in an
assessment of his international thought]{.underline} (Scheuerman 1999).
[Although Schmitt was expelled from the Nazi Party]{.underline} in 1936,
when [The Nomos of the Earth]{.underline} was written in the early 1940s
it certainly [retained traces of his earlier allegiance]{.underline}.
[The claim that the barbarism of the two world wars could be attributed
to Anglo- American liberal internationalism]{.underline}, and that
Wilsonianism was, in effect, responsible for the Second World War [needs
to be assessed in this light]{.underline}. It is certainly a commonplace
of realist analyses of 1930s international relations that liberal
internationalism contributed to the outbreak of the Second World War by
confusing Western public opinion as to the nature of the international
order and preventing it from adequately assessing the nature of the
threat posed by Hitler, but this is hardly the same as regarding liberal
internationalists as actually responsible for the war. One can read
Schmitt as arguing the more passive point that the real failure of
liberal internationalism lay in its inability to offer an alternative
basis for order to the JPE, but still, [on Schmitt's account, Germany in
1939--1945 was fighting a defensive war against US and British
imperialism and the horrors of the war, such as saturation bombing of
cities, emerged directly from the crusading approach of the
Anglo-Saxons]{.underline}, symbolized by their relentless demand for
German unconditional surrender[. Sixty years on, this appears every bit
as self- serving an account of the war as it would have done at the time
to the many victims of Hitler's war]{.underline}.7
