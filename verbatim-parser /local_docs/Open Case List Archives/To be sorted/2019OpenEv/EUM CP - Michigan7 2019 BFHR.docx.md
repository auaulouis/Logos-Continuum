monitoring program cannot provide assurances that foreign governments
are adhering to conditions placed on U.S. arms transfers. [Because
adherence to such conditions is one of the components in the
decision-making process of approving arms transfers, information
obtained from the end-use monitoring program could also be used in the

e\. [End-Use and End-User Monitoring Requirements Are]{.underline}
Insufficient Both ITAR and EARs attempt to curtail the transfer of
sensitive technologies through end-use monitoring requirements.
Technologies transferred under ITAR may not be used for unauthorized
purposes and the receiving party must agree not to re-transfer title or
possession of such defense articles or services.81 The ITAR end-use and
end-user requirements for exported items controlled under the USML are
monitored under the Blue Lantern Program, which reviews the end-use of
defense articles, defense services, and brokering activities exported
through commercial channels. 82 While [the Blue Lantern
program]{.underline} does make strides to monitor the enduse of those
technologies most vulnerable to exploitation, [it is a resource
constrained program]{.underline}.83 In [2012, the Blue Lantern Program
on a budget of \$2.1 million was only able to initiate 820 checks on
end-use and was only able to close 706 cases out of the 86,000 license
applications received for the same year]{.underline}.84 [This means that
less than 1% of the most sensitive technologies exported from the United
States were verified to be compliant]{.underline} with end-use and
end-user requirements.85 The EARs is similarly littered with
prohibitions on end-use and end-users and restrictions on re-transfer to
third parties.**[86 Despite these restrictions, enforcement of end-use
monitoring is often non-existent]{.underline}**. For example,
Congressional hearings after the Gulf War revealed that of the 771
export licenses granted for Iraq, only one was ever checked for its
end-use to ensure it was eing utilized for civilian purposes.87 A former
Chairman of the House Oversight Committee complained the "Commerce
Department issues licenses for commodities not knowing if the goods are
what they purport to be; ever reach their intended destination; or are
used for the stated legitimate purpose."88 He further noted certificates
not to re-export are "little more than paper salve to the conscience of
the government and U.S. corporations" and do little to prevent the
retransfer to sensitive technologies.89 The lack of monitoring under the
ITAR and EARs undermines the objectives of each regulation. Exported
sensitive technologies are easily being converted into destructive
devices that threat U.S. nation security interests.90 Partner and allied
nations that do not enforce U.S. end-use monitoring requirements are
oftentimes found to be the suppliers of otherwise controlled U.S.
technologies.91 Without a strong mechanism to ensure end-use and
end-user monitoring, the United States effort to prevent the transfer of
sensitive technologies to global bad actors is compromised.

administrative standpoint, a SECA allows a streamlined opportunity to
track exported items and technologies. The SECA [would be responsible

would create records from a technology transfer to be housed in one

end-user monitoring easier to track and enforce.]{.underline}** [To that
end, Congress must ensure strong enforcement provisions]{.underline} for
the SECA. The new SECA must have investigative authority to query end
users about the whereabouts and use of controlled technologies.
[End-users who fail to comply with the SECA's follow-up inquires must be
subject to various levels of legislatively-approved
sanctions]{.underline}, [including but not limited to warning letters,
watch lists, exclusions from end-use of certain technologies,
ineligibility for military sale, and suspension or cancellation of
contracts, and possibly sanctions]{.underline}. [The SECA must have the
responsibility for monitoring and reporting to Congress on multiple

recommendations to Congress for further legislative sanctions if it is

Bought Us? Not Much" ) mba-alb

[Congress rubber stamps]{.underline} these [requests with little regard
for whether this assistance achieves]{.underline} U.S. foreign policy
[objectives. It does the same when the executive branch]{.underline}
[requests]{.underline} congressional approval of [arms
sales]{.underline} for cold hard cash. Such docility might be good
industrial policy---after all, it creates jobs in key congressional
districts, provides corporate welfare for America's defense companies,
and helps maintain the defense industrial base. But it makes for lousy
foreign policy. The United States will continue to pour money down a rat
hole until Congress and the executive branch better understand why these
problems keep recurring and muster the political will to fix them. Based
on our experience in the State Department, here is our diagnosis of the
problem and some remedies for what ails U.S. military assistance in the
Middle East. In the U.S. foreign policy toolkit, security assistance and
arms transfers have become the instruments of choice for American
diplomats and soldiers. Grant assistance and weapons sales are treated
as Swiss Army Knives, all-purpose tools appropriate for use in virtually
any scenario. According to the prevailing view in the U.S. government,
security assistance works wonders: it builds the capabilities of partner
countries, provides influence over their policies, and guarantees access
to influential institutions and personalities in capitals across the
globe. If true, this would seem to more than justify the \$48.7 billion
the U.S. has spent on security assistance to the Middle East over the
past decade. In reality, U.S. military assistance promises more than it
delivers. There is scant evidence outside of a few isolated cases that
U.S. material support to Middle Eastern countries has fulfilled any of
these purposes. Recipients of U.S. funding and weapons have largely
failed to make major strides in their capabilities and, in some
instances, may have even regressed. Despite \$47 billion in U.S.
military assistance over 40 years, the Egyptian military has struggled
mightily to contain an ISIS-affiliate numbering no more than 1,200
militants. The Saudis barely used their American-made advanced combat
aircraft in the U.S.-led anti-ISIS operation in Syria, and \$89 billion
in arms sales to the kingdom over the last 10 years has not prevented
Riyadh from getting bogged down in an increasingly costly quagmire in
Yemen with U.S.-supplied weapons. The U.S. has sold hundreds of billions
of dollars in military hardware to Persian Gulf countries and yet
collectively they are not capable of defending the free flow of oil from
the Gulf against a militarily weaker Iran without U.S. assistance.
Likewise, the track record of using security assistance to increase U.S.
influence in the region is no more encouraging. [While recipient
countries are happy to utter platitudes about increased cooperation,
they generally]{.underline}---and successfully---[resist Washington's
requests to modify their policies in exchange for
assistance]{.underline}. Ongoing U.S. assistance to Egypt did not leave
Cairo open to American pleas to desist from forcibly dispersing two
largely non-violent sit[-]{.underline}ins in the capital, in which over
800 people were massacred. Likewise, [U.S. attempts to explicitly link
military assistance and arms sales to a recipient country's domestic
political behavior have not borne much fruit**.**]{.underline} For
instance, the Obama administration's suspension of some types of
military assistance to Egypt in 2013 did not lead to "credible progress"
toward democratic reforms. Nor did putting a \$4 billion arms package
for Bahrain on hold yield an improvement in that country's human rights
environment. Importantly, [these failures have more to do with a lack of
political will in Washington**, in which the U.S. capitulated before its
coercive measures could have the desired effect**]{.underline}, [than
any inherent limitation in what withholding weapons shipments can
accomplish]{.underline}. [But the frequency with which the United States
folds in these standoffs suggests a structural problem in U.S.
assistance mechanisms that undermines its efficacy as a tool of
influence.]{.underline} U.S. officials have excellent access in Middle
Eastern capitals, but it is hard to attribute this to military
assistance and arms sales. The United States remains a predominant
international player and most countries do not have the luxury of
ignoring Washington for long. Pentagon officials argue that the
provision of material support increases their contacts with foreign
militaries, creating opportunities to learn more about partner armed
forces. In practice, however, recipient [countries take great
precautions to limit and regulate U.S. access to their
troops.]{.underline} As an example, most Egyptian military personnel are
prohibited from interacting with U.S. officials, while a small core of
vetted senior officers are entrusted with managing Egypt's military
relationship with the United States. Under existing conditions, U.S.
interests and taxpayers are not the primary beneficiaries of military
assistance and arms sales. Instead, it is U.S. defense contractors and
regional militaries that often prioritize domestic political influence
over operational capabilities. In recent years, the U.S. arms industry
has registered record profits, a pattern likely to continue given
President Trump's initiative to expedite government approval of weapons
sales. Indeed, the State Department cleared a record number of arms
sales in Fiscal Year 2017 (\$75.9 billion). While champions of the U.S.
arms industry defend it as an engine of job growth, economists have
found that investments in other industries are more efficient job
generators. [Meanwhile, Middle Eastern militaries have exploited arms
sales to buttress their prestige]{.underline} and to support local
patronage networks, both of which help to sustain their dominant
position in domestic politics. Egypt's procurement of over 1,000 M1A1
Abrams tanks, for instance, has less to do with their military value
than with the Egyptian jobs supported by a co-production plant in
country. The Egyptian Armed Forces have so far opted not to deploy M1A1s
in combat in the restive Sinai Peninsula. In his State of the Union
address, President Trump endorsed "legislation to help ensure American
foreign-assistance dollars always serve American interests, and only go
to America's friends." But even when this assistance goes to America's
friends, it rarely serves American interests. [Decisions to sell weapons
to allies, friends, and partners often involve hand-waving and
intellectual laziness]{.underline}. It is unusual when clear objectives
with measurable benchmarks of progress are identified for weapons sales
and assistance levels. Instead, proponents of these sales invoke tired
bromides about how assistance will provide access to the recipient's
military leadership or further cement the bilateral relationship. But
[access should not be confused with influence]{.underline}---and
"relationship maintenance" should not be treated as an end in itself.
Washington has become so fixated on doling out billions of dollars for
this purpose that it often forgets what this assistance is for in the
first place: securing U.S. interests. [More often than not, our allies
and client states take the money and use their weapons in pursuit of
policies inimical to U.S. interests or kvetch about American
unreliability]{.underline}. Saudi Arabia, which has used
American-supplied weapons to visit ruin on Yemen and strengthen Jihadist
groups there, is a poster child for this phenomenon. So, too, is the
UAE, which is an accomplice in Riyadh's immoral and strategically
disastrous campaign in Yemen and used American-supplied weapons in Libya
in support of a renegade general. A second and related problem is that
the **[U.S. government does a poor job of holding allies and clients to
account for behavior that runs]{.underline}** **[counter to American
interests]{.underline}**. There is no systematic review of what U.S.
military assistance accomplishes. The key questions that rarely get
asked, let alone answered, are what does the U.S. want and expect from
the assistance we provide and how does this aid help or hurt America's
ability to achieve these goals? [If the U.S. cannot identify
actions]{.underline} that the recipient would not have otherwise taken
as a result of this assistance, [then]{.underline} [it]{.underline} is
nothing more than a welfare program, and [has two pernicious
effects]{.underline}. First, **[it encourages "moral
hazard"---recipients to do whatever they want with the assistance
without having to fear the consequences of their actions]{.underline}**.
Second, it creates "reverse leverage"--- Washington bends over backwards
to keep relations smooth and the assistance flowing, rather than
leverage the recipient's dependence on U.S. military support and
political commitments.

persist.]{.underline} [The most gaping vulnerability---and the most
dangerous one---is security sector assistance]{.underline}; associated
funds or weapons that are diverted may directly imperil U.S. interests.
In 2015, bribery and bid-rigging in an Afghan Ministry of Defense [fuel

increased costs to the Afghan government and U.S. taxpayers by more than
\$214 million. Have the gaps that produced that problem been corrected?
Not entirely. [Embassies and intelligence agencies are not regularly
tasked with assessing security sector corruption]{.underline} in advance
of new assistance agreements. [Department of Defense officers at post
have little training in identifying which units have been criminally
captured or are using coercive mechanisms to extract rents.]{.underline}
[When corruption is discovered, officers do not always report it back to
headquarters, out of fear that programs will be cut off
automatically.]{.underline} [Risk mitigation measures are also applied
unevenly.]{.underline} Sometimes [officers prioritize assistance that
cannot be easily pilfered]{.underline} (such as training instead of
equipment) [or require additional end-use monitoring.]{.underline} Yet
at other times, [some loss of U.S. assistance may be seen as inevitable
and acceptable.]{.underline} Frequently, these decisions are made at the

in devastating detail. [There are several steps that the Departments of

corruption via security assistance]{.underline}:

- [Instituting mandatory corruption risk assessments and mitigation
  plans, approved by senior leadership, for assistance above a

  implementation of the new strategy on preventing corruption in U.S.
  reconstruction efforts]{.underline}, tasked in the [National Defense

- [Applying principles advanced by the [Open Contracting

- [Focusing assistance in high-risk places on defense institution

- [Conditioning bilateral security assistance on domestic transparency

[Widespread corruption poses other serious challenges to providers of
military assistance. There is a danger that tilting aid too heavily
toward the defense sector can strengthen it at the expensive of civilian
institutions, undermining civilian control of the military. There is a
significant risk that this may be occurring among key recipients of U.S.
security assistance.]{.underline} The Security Assistance Monitor's
[assessment](http://securityassistance.org/fact_sheet/military-aid-dependency-what-are-major-us-risks-around-world)
of dependence on U.S. military aid demonstrates that, for 2014, U.S.
military aid accounted anywhere from 15% to 20% of defense expenditures
of recipient countries like Egypt, Pakistan, and Burundi; over 50% in
Liberia; and over 90% in Afghanistan[. A major impediment to combatting
corruption in military aid is the [lack of
transparency](http://www.politico.com/agenda/story/2016/03/the-pentagons-foreign-aid-budget-needs-oversight-000060)
regarding aid programs in the supplying countries.]{.underline} In the
United States, for example, military aid programs rapidly proliferated
in the 2000s. Of particular concern are the well over two dozen such
programs funded and implemented by the Pentagon. [There is no systematic
reporting to Congress on these programs, so it is difficult to determine
how many countries are recipients, what type of aid they receive, what
the aid is intended to accomplish, and whether the programs have been
effective.]{.underline} The Security Assistance Monitor maintains the
most comprehensive tracking of U.S. military and police aid, but this
invaluable data is no substitute for detailed reporting on the part of
the U.S. government. [Absent greater transparency, it is extremely
difficult to assess the extent and role of corruption in U.S. security
assistance programs. Corruption in military aid programs is not
inevitable. A greater focus on governance and anti-corruption
practices]{.underline} in the provision of military training [can be one
useful tool in stemming corruption.]{.underline} In fact, it appears
that the Department of Defense is slowly increasing some anti-corruption
training to foreign militaries. However, in more critical cases, [a
temporary suspension of security aid may be necessary to force recipient
militaries to clean up their acts.]{.underline} Corruption in defense
assistance programs is about more than just a diversion of funds. It is
also a threat to local, regional, and global security. Any effort to
reduce global corruption must make cleaning up corruption in military
aid programs a top priority.

investigations relating to bribery in the arms trade were concluded,
including cases involving the French arms company DCNS in Taiwan and the
British company BAE Systems in the United Kingdom and the United
States.2 [However, the length of time it took to conclude these cases
and the often **unsatisfactory outcomes** and **low punitive costs** for
the companies---not to mention the countless cases that are never
investigated---illustrate the **difficulties of tackling corruption** in
the arms trade and the reluctance of authorities to do so.]{.underline}
[This chapter attempts to unravel why **the arms trade has become
synonymous with corruption.**]{.underline} It argues that this
[corruption takes a heavy toll on buyer and seller countries,
**undermining democratic practice**, the **rule of law** and **global
security**.]{.underline} Section II defines corruption and briefly
discusses [the features of the arms trade that make it so
**susceptible** to this plague.]{.underline} Section III looks at the
case of a highly controversial weapon deal in South Africa that
exemplifies many aspects of corruption in the trade. Section IV reveals
the impact of this corruption in a broader context using the South
African and other examples. Section V concludes with suggestions for
multilateral, international and national initiatives that could limit
the extent of corruption in the arms trade and considers the rights of
those who suffer the consequences of corrupt deals. II. Understanding
corruption in the arms trade What is corruption? [Corruption is a term
with **great emotive force** that is often used without being
**precisely defined**. Even in key international agreements it is often
**left vague**.]{.underline} For example, the 2003 United Nations
Convention against Corruption (UNCAC) fails to define the term because
'consensus on the definition of corruption had not been reached during
the negotiating process'.3 Instead, UNCAC attempts to address 'specific
kinds of corruption' without providing a prescriptive overarching
definitional framework. Nonetheless, UNCAC is legally binding and
obliges member states to introduce legal mechanisms to limit corruption.
Like UNCAC, the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development
(OECD) refrains from providing a definition of corruption, despite
operating an anti-bribery and corruption programme and monitoring both
bribery and corruption. The OECD's 1997 Convention on Combating Bribery
of Foreign Public Officials in International Business Transactions
focuses on the specific issue of bribery that is directed at foreign
public officials.4 However, the convention is not legally binding and
instead requests that OECD member countries each enact supporting
legislation. Transparency International (TI) provides a rigorous
definition of corruption as 'the abuse of entrusted power for private
gains'.5 It further differentiates between corruption 'according to
rule' and corruption 'against the rule'. 'Facilitation payments, where a
bribe is paid to receive preferential treatment for something the bribe
receiver is required to do by law', constitute corruption according to
rule, whereas corruption against the rule is 'a bribe paid to obtain
services the bribe receiver is prohibited from providing'. This chapter
uses TI's definition but expands it to include the act of corrupting,
defined as offering or giving any inducement that may or does result in
undue advantage. This highlights both the need for successful
conspiracies of corruption to involve two or more willing participants
and that all parties, whether purveyors or recipients of such
inducements, should thus be considered corrupt. [Methods and means of
corruption in the arms trade Within the arms trade a wide range of
methods and means are used to purchase or acquire undue
influence.]{.underline} This chapter focuses on four of the most
frequently used: (a) bribery, (b) the failure to declare a conflict of
interest, (c) the promise of post-employment and (d) the offer of
preferential business access**. [Bribery]{.underline}** [is the first
and **most widely known method** that is **common to all types of weapon
transaction**.]{.underline} [In these instances, payments are made or
solicited in cash or kind (e.g. diamonds or other movable commodities)
to influence a procurement decision. Modern arms dealers most frequently
use a network of international banks to facilitate and obscure payments
and relationships.]{.underline} In addition, it is extremely rare to
find an instance of a supplier paying a bribe or inducement directly to
an official or institution. Instead, this is frequently the job of a
third party who 'greases the wheels' of arms deals. This provides a
legal remove between the supplier and the corrupting act. [In the case
of the al-Yamamah arms deal between the UK and Saudi Arabia---the
world's largest---as well as the example of South Africa below, it was
alleged that BAE Systems established a complex web of international
banking arrangements and third parties that was designed to provide the
greatest secrecy and obscurity for payments made to decision
makers.]{.underline}6 The second method, common to formal arms deals
involving governments, is failure to declare a conflict of interest,
whether it be a conflict preceding a potential deal or one actively
pursued in anticipation of a deal. In a conflict of interest case,
public officials or institutions have a financial stake---be it direct
or via a third party, often a relative or confidant---in a particular
arms supplier's success in securing a deal. Public officials may direct
contracts to the supplier in anticipation of personal financial reward,
sometimes through a financial interest in a company that anticipates a
substantial flow of income following the selection of a particular arms
supplier. A third method, occupying more of a legal grey area than those
above, is post-employment. Also known as the 'revolving door', it occurs
when public officials are employed by an arms company shortly or
directly after leaving office. In many instances the offer of employment
is made while the individual is still a public official adjudicating on
decisions to award business to a future employer.7 Certain countries,
such as the USA, legally require that public officials observe a
'cooling off' period before entering into private employment with a
company connected to previous work as a public servant. However, this
period is frequently short, sometimes ignored altogether or can be
mitigated by means of, for example, bonus payments made to the official
by the employing company.

[In the years since the Sept. 11th attacks, the United States has spent
huge
[sums](https://www.stimson.org/sites/default/files/file-attachments/CT_Spending_Report_0.pdf)
to help foreign military and police forces develop the capacity to fight
terrorism, with decidedly mixed results.]{.underline} Some of [the
biggest challenges to the effectiveness of U.S. counterterrorism aid can
be explained by one word: corruption.]{.underline} The failures of
U.S.-trained Afghan security forces are well known, but [the role of
corruption in fueling those failures is often not fully
appreciated.]{.underline} In April 2014, Gen. John Allen (retired), the
former commander of U.S. forces there,
[told](https://www.foreign.senate.gov/imo/media/doc/Allen_Testimony.pdf)
a U.S. Senate subcommittee that "for too long we have focused our
attention solely on the Taliban as the existential threat to
Afghanistan," but "they are an annoyance compared to the scope and
magnitude of corruption." [In Iraq, Mali, Nigeria, and Yemen, corruption
was at the root of why U.S. supported military and security forces were
unable to effectively respond to terrorist threats.]{.underline}
Transparency International has rightly attributed the
[collapse](http://ti-defence.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/The_Fifth_Column_Web.pdf)
of Iraqi Security Forces in the face of ISIS attacks in 2014 in part to
the appointment of sectarian leaders who were more interested in
"amassing personal fortunes through corrupt practices . . . than on
maintaining an effective fighting force." [Many of the corrupt
activities that fueled past U.S. counterterrorism problems are present
in other U.S. partners]{.underline}. A recent
[report](https://securityassistance.org/sites/default/files/SAM%20Corruption%20Report%20Final_1.pdf)
by the Security Assistance Monitor program at the Center for
International Policy has found that two-thirds of the recipients of U.S.
counterterrorism aid pose serious corruption risks[. The risks are
linked to the prevalence of practices such as favoritism, bribery, theft
of defense resources, drug trafficking, state capture, and government
fragmentation.]{.underline} [These activities can undermine U.S.
counterterrorism efforts by fueling terrorist group recruitment and
financing, demoralizing front-line soldiers, and limiting the use and
sustainability of U.S. provided equipment.]{.underline} For the last few
years, the United States has supported Egyptian efforts to secure the
Libyan-Egyptian border. However, there have been
[reports](http://ti-defence.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/The_Fifth_Column_Web.pdf)
that low-ranking Egyptian soldiers are accepting bribes on the Libyan
border to allow fighters "to smuggle money, people, and commodities
across the border." In Chad, President Idriss Déby has systematically
supported some military units and individuals and marginalized others to
help maintain his power. This rampant
[favoritism](https://securityassistance.org/sites/default/files/SAM%20Corruption%20Report%20Final_1.pdf)
has created factional divisions within the military and increased the
risk that the neglected Chadian military units involved in
U.S.-supported counterterrorism efforts in Chad or Mali will continue to
protest or even mutiny because of a lack of needed equipment, salaries,
or benefits. U.S. support to favored military units may also fuel these
divisions within the military. For several U.S. counterterrorism
partners, widespread bribery and other forms of corruption could lead to
serious deficits in skilled soldiers and needed equipment. It is
reportedly common that individuals will pay bribes to serve in a
particular unit or location or to avoid front-line duty in Azerbaijan.
In Saudi Arabia, arms purchases have often been used more to [line the
pockets](http://government.defenceindex.org/generate-report.php?country_id=6333)
of certain princes or strengthen military factions than to obtain needed
equipment for the country's defense. It also appears that terrorist
groups are benefiting from popular grievances against government
corruption in Bangladesh and Burkina Faso in their efforts to gain new
recruits or support for their causes. In Bangladesh, terrorist groups
are
[reportedly](https://www.crisisgroup.org/asia/south-asia/bangladesh/295-countering-jihadist-militancy-bangladesh)
seeking to "exploit resentment among some Bangladesh soldiers" that feel
marginalized by the ruling party. In response to these serious risks,
the United States is increasing some efforts to address corruption in
U.S. security cooperation. [This includes a relatively new
congressionally-mandated
[directive](https://open.defense.gov/portals/23/Documents/foreignasst/DoDI_513214_on_AM&E.pdf)
for the Pentagon to elevate assessments, monitoring, and evaluation of
U.S. security cooperation.]{.underline} In July 2018, the Defense
Department also sent to Congress a new strategy to prevent corruption in
stabilization operations. However, these initiatives are not yet
addressing the full range of corruption risks. In order to curb
corruption risks in U.S. counterterrorism aid programs, [the Pentagon
and the State Department would benefit from strengthened assessments of
corruption risks before providing assistance.]{.underline} [These
assessments should map the structure of corrupt networks in the
countries, including main revenue streams, external enablers and
facilitators, and connections with the military. They should also
provide a deeper analysis of the severity and nature of the corruption
risks, including possible connections with organized crime.]{.underline}
[Another key tool in fighting corruption is to increase the use of
restrictions and conditions on U.S. counterterrorism aid.]{.underline}
As part of this effort, it would be important to identify triggers that
could spark a possible revision or termination of certain types of
counterterrorism aid. These triggers could include the diversion of U.S.
weapons, cooperation with criminal organizations, increased factional
divisions, or elevated repression of opposition parties, journalists, or
marginalized groups. [The United States could also increase U.S. support
for and training on anti-corruption efforts in certain
countries.]{.underline} Even in U.S. partner countries where corruption
is widespread, U.S. support for transparency and oversight measures can
help build support for effectively reducing the serious risks of
corruption. Safety, security, and the wise use of tax dollars all demand
that the United States invest more into reducing corruption going
forward.

[The costs of corruption are not just financial: the money lost to
corruption is money that cannot be spent on health or education or
returned to taxpayers; the weakness of attempts to investigate and
prosecute corruption undermines a country's justice and oversight
institutions; and the poor procurement decisions that corruption in the
arms trade leads to in turn lead to the weakening of a country's ability
to defend itself.]{.underline} The [full implications of corruption in
the arms trade are best illustrated with examples from recent years that
affect rich and poor countries, both arms producers and arms purchasers,
in all parts of the world.]{.underline} The South African arms
deal---through its social and economic costs and impacts on South
Africa's actual security needs, democracy and the rule of law---has had,
and continues to have, a debilitating impact on the country[. It has
also damaged the rule of law in the UK as an exporter state. The
exorbitant costs have led to the sacrifice of much needed socio-economic
development.]{.underline} Despite the deal being estimated at just under
30 billion rand (\$5 billion) in 1999, the amount is more likely to be
in the region of 70 billion rand (\$11 billion) or more by the
contracts' conclusion, due to exchange rate fluctuations and the cost of
financing.58 This figure dwarfs what has been spent on far more pressing
priorities.

to set strict standards]{.underline}** **[about]{.underline}** the kinds
of **[governments that receive U.S. weaponry.]{.underline}** **[If we
don't do it, no other nation will]{.underline}**. As Jimmy Carter put it
in 1976, "we cannot have it both ways. [We can't be both the world's
leading champion of peace and the world's leading supplier of
arms."\[]{.underline}3\] I have been working on the issue of U.S. arms
transfers since the late 1970s, when the Carter administration's
policies of promoting human rights and arms transfer restraint were
beginning to give way to allegedly more "realistic," hardline policies.
Under the guise of strengthening longstanding allies like the Shah of
Iran and winning over former adversaries like the People's Republic of
China, the Carter administration walked away from its commitment to
reduce the United States role as the world's leading arms merchant.\[4\]
More than twenty years later, I believe more strongly than ever that
when it comes to arming human rights abusers, the self-appointed
"realists" are the ones who are living in a dream world, while the
advocates of restricting arms exports to repressive regimes are the ones
who are grounded in reality. From Iran to Indonesia, and from Central
America to the [Congo, our nation's role as the world's leading arms
merchant has done far more harm than good]{.underline}. **[Using arms
sales as a way to win friends and intimidate adversaries has not only
fostered serious human rights abuses in the recipient nations; it has
also undermined U.S. interests by spreading instability and fueling
conflict]{.underline}**.\[5\] [It's time to make human rights the
primary consideration in U.S. arms sales decision-making]{.underline},
not just one factor among many. We need to move beyond the point where,
on issues of national security concern, human rights considerations are
routinely cast aside in favor of more pressing, "pragmatic" concerns. At
the dawn of a new millennium, in the first few months of a new
administration and a new Congress, it is time to take a serious look at
the impact of U.S. arms sales on human rights with an eye towards
changing our arms sales policies for the better. It is my hope that
today's hearings will be an important step in that process. U.S. Policy:
Rhetoric Meets Reality [On paper, the United States probably has the
best laws anywhere on the issue of arms exports.]{.underline} On arms
and human rights, Section 502B of the Foreign Assistance Act mandates
that "no security assistance may be provided to any country the
government of which engages in a consistent pattern of gross violations
of internationally recognized human rights." On arms and aggression,
Section 4 of the Arms Export Control Act authorizes provision of U.S.
military equipment and training only for purposes of internal security,
"legitimate self-defense," or participation in United Nations
peacekeeping operations or other operations consistent with the U.N.
charter.\[6\] [In practice, U.S. arms transfer policy diverges sharply
from these sound principles of human rights and
non-]{.underline}aggression. Nearly six years ago, in one of the first
major research reports produced by my project, U.S. Weapons at War, we
took a look at just how large the gap between rhetoric and reality is in
U.S. arms transfer policy. I won't bore you with all the details, but I
will cite some of the relevant findings:

[By correcting this imbalance]{.underline}, **[H.R. 7080 will open
another avenue to ending U.S. enabling of other governments' gross
violations of international humanitarian and human rights
laws]{.underline}**. Nowhere is this avenue more needed than for Yemen's
internationalized civil war. There, parties to the conflict routinely
conduct indiscriminate attacks on civilians and have created a
humanitarian crisis that has pushed millions to the brink of starvation.
Yet, it is Saudi Arabia and the UAE, using U.S.-manufactured weapons and
logistical support, that have caused the majority of the conflict's
recorded civilian casualties. Causing further concern, a new documentary
aired by Deutsche Welle, presents credible evidence that the coalition
states have diverted U.S.-manufactured armored vehicles to unaccountable
non-state militias. Admittedly, the Senate has rarely made a serious
attempt to block an arms sale by resolution of disapproval, but support
for exercising greater Congressional oversight over arms sales seems to
be on the rise. And even when a resolution of disapproval fails to pass,
**[mere consideration of the legislation can send clear signals to the
executive branch and recipient countries]{.underline}** alike, **[and
can stimulate valuable policy debate]{.underline}**. While S.J. Res. 39,
a 2016 effort to block tank sales to Saudi Arabia, mustered 27 votes,
S.J. Res. 42, a June 2017 measure to freeze a sale of precision-guided
munitions to Saudi Arabia, garnered 47. The administration has not moved
forward with a further sale of as many as 120,000 precision munitions to
both Saudi Arabia and the UAE due to Senate opposition; the weapons'
traceable serial numbers, as damning as "made in the USA" stickers,
could embroil the United States in further strikes on buses, hospitals,
and homes. While the threat of unicameral opposition has worked for now,
the reforms advanced by H.R. 7080 would further increase the chances for
debate on arms sales in the Congress, and create a more efficient path
for the House and Senate to indefinitely arrest a sale. Had the
procedures outlined in H.R. 7080 been in place in June 2017, H.J. Res.
102 (the House companion to S.J. Res. 42), could have forced a vote on a
motion to discharge instead of dying quietly in committee, creating a
debate that, as it did on the Senate side, swayed moderate offices
against the sale and focused a news cycle on U.S. complicity in
Saudi-led coalition attacks on civilians. While the most recent and
egregious example, [Yemen is not the only case where enhanced
Congressional oversight is necessary to add reasonable constraints to
the arms sales process.]{.underline} By some credible estimates, the
[U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates [sells arms, including bombs
and missiles, to at least 62 countries that are an active party to a
conflict]{.underline}. Some countries to whom the United States sells
arms, such as Bahrain and Egypt, have demonstrated a consistent pattern
of human rights violations; others present a very clear risk of misuse
or diversion, or even the potential for mass atrocities. And [some
countries with lower levels of capacity simply require a greater degree
of due diligence to ensure equipment can be used
appropriately]{.underline}. **[If H.R. 7080 makes it more likely that
Congress could exercise more meaningful oversight in even a handful of
these cases, the risk of U.S. complicity in human rights abuses or the
next humanitarian disaster, wherever it is, could be meaningfully
diminished -- and at minimal opportunity cost]{.underline}**. H.R. [7080
does not have to become law this Congress to have an impact -- advocates
should view it as an organizing tool around which to rally,]{.underline}
**[and that could ease the way to reforms small and large which can
check the executive's nearly unfettered prerogative to sell weapons to
any regime]{.underline}**, regardless of their crimes. To begin, H.R.
7080 does not have to pass for next year's House to respect its
provisions as an intra-chamber rule: [regardless of eventual passage,
Democratic leadership should open this procedural path to the floor for
joint resolutions of disapproval as a matter of course]{.underline}.
Furthermore, if H.R. 7080 is reintroduced in the 116thCongress, it
should be resurfaced alongside a host of measures to strengthen
Congress's hand in overall arms export policy. These can include
requiring detailed and unclassified answers from the departments of
State and Defense concerning the likelihood that a sale of certain items
will exacerbate armed conflict or spur an arms race (theoretically a
judgment the executive already makes under AECA) and outlining robust
processes for monitoring the way weapons' are used among recipients with
a history of rights violations or violations of the laws of armed
conflict, and those for which the indicators suggest a high risk of
future violations. Congress should also consider lowering notification
thresholds, so that members can vet arms sales valued at less than \$50
million. The time is also long past for Congress to unequivocally
clarify that the Leahy Law applies to Foreign Military Sales (FMS) and
Direct Commercial Sales (DCS), thereby prohibiting State and Defense
from permitting the transfer or maintenance of defense articles to
security forces that have committed unconscionable human rights
violations with impunity. There is no simple trick to ending the
devastation yielded by the war and intervention in Yemen, which has
directly killed at least 57,000, contributed to the further deaths of
tens of thousands of children per year from preventable causes, and
threatened 14 million with famine. Yet without a congressional freeze on
weapons to the coalition states, there will never be enough political
space for peace negotiations to take root. So long as short-term profit
motive driving executive branch arms sales policy supersedes a
reasonable modicum of self-restraint, the Congress, and H.R. 7080
present the best opportunity to limit the risk that American weapons
will be involved in -- or aggravate -- both Yemen's catastrophe and the
next humanitarian crisis.

[**End-Use Monitoring** has come under **increasing
scrutiny**]{.underline} in the past year as a mission of great
importance but also [one that receives very little
attention.]{.underline} In an August, 2000 report to the Chairman of the
House Committee on International Relations, the General Accounting
Office (GAO) a number of weaknesses in existing program
(GAO/NSIAD-00-208). [The report focuses specifically on weaknesses in
DoD�s program for end-use monitoring noting a lack of **specific
observation** and **reporting requirements**, **ineffective
implementation** of end-use checks, and **lack of guidance** or
**procedures** for end-use check standards.]{.underline} Therefore, as
of the time of this writing, DoD�s End-Use Monitoring program is being
thoroughly reviewed for revision. DoD expects to issue revised policy
guidance by the end of FY01 but in the meantime, interim adjustments
will be made. Among those adjustments, DSCA will likely require Unified
Commands and SAOs to identify a single point of contact for end-use
monitoring issues. Until DSCA issues further policy, the information
provided in this chapter, particularly that concerning post-delivery
checks, remains valid. [As a **major arms exporter** and as a **leader**
in **worldwide arms control initiatives**, the U.S. has special
responsibilities related to control of U.S.-origin defense
items.]{.underline} [Of all responsibilities associated with management
of military articles and services, none is more important than ensuring
items are used to further the security of the United States, its
friends, and its allies.]{.underline} [The continual challenge of
meeting this responsibility grows as the variety and sensitivity of
items increases.]{.underline} Precautions, developed carefully and
refined through decades of experience, are taken to provide items only
to countries and international organizations with the capability and the
will to assure their full protection and use as prescribed in
pre-transfer agreements. [As with other aspects of national security,
both for the U.S. and countries receiving sensitive U.S. defense
articles or information, end-use monitoring permeates aspects of most
actions.]{.underline} Unlike actions which have a beginning and a
conclusion, security is persistent and continuous. [An effective
security process may become so familiar and routine as to operate almost
automatically, in virtual obscurity.]{.underline} Those responsible for
one part often do not see other parts which, together, provide controls
throughout an item�s life. This may be optimal for those intimately
familiar with the workings of security assistance programs. It is
proving inadequate for those only marginally familiar with U.S.
processes, who seek to know that controls provide reasonable assurance
items will be used only for the [intended purposes, misuse will be
detected, and any weakness of control will be found and

[There are clear rules against arms transfers to third parties. There
are also **end-use monitoring requirements** for U.S. arms exports, but
these checks are **hardly universal.**]{.underline} Given that at least
some of [the equipment found in militia hands can be tied to U.S. arms
sales, the Department of Defense, State Department, and Commerce
Department are clearly not adequately monitoring sales.]{.underline}
(Which U.S. agency is responsible for end-use checks depends on the type
of sale conducted.) The United States is the largest arms supplier to
Saudi Arabia and the UAE, two lucrative customers of the U.S. defense
industry. Saudi Arabia was the largest importer of U.S. arms, having
purchased \$112 billion in weapons from 2013 through 2017. The UAE was
the [second-largest
importer](https://www.npr.org/2018/10/15/657588534/fact-check-how-much-does-saudi-arabia-spend-on-arms-deals-with-the-u-s)

billion](https://static.wixstatic.com/ugd/3ba8a1_4498bdea89b148989be12b75281be4f5.pdf)
in weapons have been offered to the UAE in thirty-two separate deals
under the Pentagon's Foreign Military Sales program. [These arms sales
continue, despite both countries' history of diverting arms to favored
militias.]{.underline} Saudi Arabia has been purchasing weapons from
third parties to pass on to allied governments and groups at least since
the 1970s, sometimes on behalf of the U.S. government. Transparency
International's Government Defense Anti-Corruption Index ranks Saudi
Arabia and the UAE in its high-risk category for corruption, with Saudi
Arabia receiving a score of zero out of four (zero being the worst) and
the UAE receiving a score of one for lacking a well-scrutinized process
for arms export decisions that aligns with international protocols. The
CNN investigation comes as Congress ramps up its opposition to U.S.
support for the Saudi-led coalition. Former U.S. president Barack
Obama's administration only reluctantly agreed to support the Saudi-led
coalition as it went on the offense in 2015, seeing it as an unwinnable
proxy war against Iran. [Obama had put restrictions on arms sales and
intelligence cooperation with the coalition in 2016, but President
Donald Trump's administration lifted those restrictions in March 2017,
just prior to Trump's overseas visit to Saudi Arabia. Saudi human rights

in August 2018 that killed forty children, and the murder of Khashoggi
have shocked the U.S. public and Congress.]{.underline} In the National
Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2018, Congress required the
departments of Defense and State to certify that the Saudi-led coalition
was doing all it could to prevent civilian casualties; the State
Department failed to provide that justification when it was due earlier
this month. In December, the
[Senate](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/12/13/us/politics/yemen-saudi-war-pompeo-mattis.html)
approved a measure to end arms shipments to Saudi Arabia, despite the
Trump administration's strong opposition to the bill. The measure did
not have enough votes to override a presidential veto, but senators have
promised to introduce an even tougher bill in to override an expected
presidential veto. [The Trump administration **continues to approve**

independent civil society. [Information on defense policies, including
the war in Yemen, is kept secret by the monarchs and their inner
circles.]{.underline} Most available information on Saudi and Emirati
coalition operations and weapons transfers comes from external parties,
such as U.S. government weapons sales notifications, news organizations,
and human rights organizations. [Given the **lack of effective** Saudi
and Emirati citizen or parliamentary **oversight** on the conduct of the
war in Yemen and associated weapons transfers, it is crucial that the
United States and other arms-exporting nations conduct **additional due
diligence** and put **controls on any exports** to Saudi Arabia and the
UAE.]{.underline} The CNN investigation demonstrates that [the stringent
due diligence and **accountability** that should be required for such

[Data on traces of US-sourced firearms recovered in Canada and several
Latin American countries provides additional evidence of the continued
need for robust controls on authorized exports.]{.underline} In 2014
alone, the US Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF)
traced 2,162 firearms to 'foreign countries', meaning that the last
known authorized recipients were foreign military, law enforcement, or
private entities (see Table 5). [The data does not indicate when, where,
or how the firearms entered the black market. In contrast to the cases
of trafficking highlighted above, however, the majority of these 2,162
weapons were probably authorized exports, meaning that they were
licensed or otherwise approved for export by the US
government.]{.underline}

[**These** and other recent **examples of diversion of legally exported
small arms**]{.underline}45 [**confirm the** continued **need for**
robust export licensing systems and **post-shipment end-use monitoring
programmes.**]{.underline}

[Further complicating this already daunting policy challenge is the need
to prevent trafficking not only in small arms and their ammunition, but
also in their parts and accessories.]{.underline} As demonstrated above,
there is a massive global black market in these items that extends to
nearly every region of the world. [Illicit firearms parts and
accessories that circulate in this market are often assembled into fully
functional weapons, many of which are acquired by drug traffickers and
other criminals.]{.underline}

[These cases underscore the importance of controlling international
transfers of parts and accessories for small arms, and controlling
transfers of some of these items (such as receivers) as rigorously as
the weapons themselves. Yet controls on parts and accessories are often
significantly less extensive or robust than controls on weapons and
ammunition]{.underline}. At the international level, this disparity is
evident in the Arms Trade Treaty and, to a lesser extent, in the UN
Firearms Protocol.

[After the Russian annexation of Crimea in 2014, Ukrainian armed forces
**received significant assistance** from European and North American
partners.]{.underline} By the summer of 2016, [18 countries provided
non-lethal aid to Ukrainian armed forces.]{.underline}2 Top donors --
the United States, United Kingdom, and Canada -- have transferred
non-lethal equipment, deployed advisers to assist with reform of the
Ukrainian defence forces and provided training to selected Ukrainian
units; the Lithuanians have also delivered security assistance,
including bullets. Assi[sting the armed forces of aligned nations can be
beneficial to both donor and recipient. What is known as "security
assistance" in the US, "defence engagement" in the UK, and "military
aid" in Canada, can help allies address shared threats; foster
**cooperation** and **interoperability**; share **resources**; and build
up the capacity of **partner armed forces**.]{.underline} The components
of [security assistance usually include **donations** and sales of
**equipment**, training of **partner militaries**, and provision of
**advisers**; less often, assistance can also entail direct cash
transfers.]{.underline} [Security assistance, if not accompanied by
**robust analysis** of the requirements of the recipient forces, which
takes into account the local context, and monitoring programmes by both
the donors and the recipient, can be **wasted** or
**diverted**.]{.underline} In Mali, for example, failure to carry out a
comprehensive needs analysis and understand not only the armed forces,
but also their environment, meant that US assistance played into
existing divisions within the Malian Army and did not stave off its
collapse in 2012.3 [Corruption and impunity within defence and security
sectors create some of the most significant risks for diversion and
waste of security assistance. Widespread petty corruption exacerbates
the risk of diversion or waste at the tactical and operational levels,
while **systemic corruption** and **state capture** make the provision
of security assistance and enterprise fraught with **large-scale
strategic** and **political risks**. Evidence suggests that assistance
provided to Ukrainian armed forces between 2014-2015 was at a
significant risk of diversion, in large part due to low-level corruption
and criminal activity.]{.underline} In 2014-2015, Ukrainian courts
handed down 38 sentences related to theft committed by military
personnel within the Anti-Terrorist Operation (ATO). Thirty five of
these refer to irregularities in the supply of weapons and ammunition,
with the remaining three concerning the theft of a mobile radio station
(with a view to selling it for scrap), petrol, and diesel fuel.4 Other
charges include theft of helmets, clothing, footwear and food rations,
with officers detained as they attempted to sell a consignment worth
200,000 Hryvnia (approximately 7,500 USD).5 Rumours of a Canadian
shipment of security assistance being diverted from the frontline by
corrupt military officials prompted the Canadian government to involve
Ukraine's volunteer organizations (VOs), renowned for procuring and
passing supplies to frontline troops, in the distribution of their next
installment of military aid.6 Of course, while using VOs might have
solved the immediate issue of diversion in the short- term, in the long
run, using alternative or parallel structures to bypass formal
institutions only weakens them further. Corruption can also undermine
the Ukrainian Armed Forces in other ways as well, making the assessments
of the overall strength, capability and effectiveness of the fighting
force unreliable. For example, [issues which affect morale, the
integrity of personnel systems, or popular support for the military --
such as theft of military housing budgets or the ability to avoid
conscription through bribery.]{.underline} And as the RAND Corporation
noted, [the perception of corruption risks affecting **international
military assistance** -- whether justified or not -- can pose a problem
for donors, wary that **sensitive technologies** might be at risk of
diversion.]{.underline}7 This report aims to trace the processes and
practices governing the provision of security assistance to Ukraine,
including laws and procedures on the donor and recipient sides, as well
as oversight institutions in Ukraine. And [to diagnose weaknesses in the
systems, which can and do create the risks of **corruption**,
**diversion** and **waste**, undermining **military readiness** and
popular support for the war effort; to assess any progress since 2014;
and to offer **recommendations** on creating long-term, sustainable
improvement for the Ukrainian defence and security

[While tracking and monitoring procedures]{.underline} for
[security]{.underline} assistance have improved markedly, corruption
risks are still present on all levels, from strategic to tactical. On
the strategic level, the biggest risk is the failure to formulate
capability requirements clearly and effectively, and to implement a
robust requirements formulation process that includes the appropriate
political and oversight institutions. In addition, [the research found a
number of areas of potential **mismanagement** and **inefficiency**,
which result in **lower effectiveness** of security assistance and can
increase corruption risks related to misappropriation of
materiel.]{.underline} [Formulating strategic requirements Perhaps the
most significant issue which can contribute to corruption risks is the
continuing lack of **transparency**, **accountability**, and
**oversight**, particularly in the process of formulating requirements
and filling capability gaps based on those requirements.]{.underline}42
Elements of the process are in place, but they do not yet add up into a
robust, overarching process of planning and oversight, with civilian
oversight and involvement from the wider defence and security sector --
including relevant parliamentary committees. Ideally, security
assistance should complement state procurement, by identifying
requirements and shortfalls, providing assistance and thereby
alleviating pressures on the defence budget. [Though **security
assistance** and **procurement** are different areas of concern, and
this research only touches on problems with the procurement system, they
are related -- the failure to provide a **clear** and **transparent**
plan for what the Ukrainian defence establishment needs, and how the
State intends to fulfill those needs, leads to **poor coordination**,
opens the door to influence by powerful individuals and the largest
state-owned defence company Ukroboronprom, and ultimately reduces donor
trust. 43 And when donor states are helping to fund the Ukrainian
defence force, while elements of the Ukrainian defence budget are wasted
due to **corruption**, it represents a waste of taxpayer's money in
donor states.]{.underline}

There are two aspects of compliance I would like to touch on today. The
first relates to foreign partner nations, and the second to foreign and
U.S. commercial entities. If our EUM checks determine that an
unauthorized third party transfer has occurred, or that
previously-transferred sensitive U.S. technology has been exploited, [we
may be required under section 3 of the AECA to make a **report to
Congress** regarding the violation of our agreement with the foreign
entity.]{.underline} [There are a number of steps we may take to address
such situations, up to and including the suspension of defense sales or
exports to the country in question.]{.underline} Corporations involved
in the defense trade are responsible for ensuring their compliance with
the ITAR. Most U.S. defense manufacturers have personnel dedicated to
ensuring such compliance, and we work with hundreds of companies each
year to ensure they are aware of the requirements and to address any
compliance issues that may arise. [When **significant lapses** in
**compliance** occur in the context of DCS transactions, the AECA
authorizes a number of options for the U.S. government.]{.underline}
These include pursuit of civil cases against companies or individuals
who have violated the ITAR, potentially resulting in fines or export
restrictions, as well as criminal penalties implemented by our law
enforcement partners and the Department of Justice, if warranted. [Our
civil cases most frequently result in **administrative
settlements**]{.underline}, which often include Department oversight of
the steps the company takes to address the cause of their lapse in
compliance[. The Department may waive or reduce a civil monetary penalty
when companies agree to implement **compliance-improvement measures**.
In cases where criminal conduct has occurred, we assist our law
enforcement partners, including the HSI and FBI, to support criminal
proceedings by the Department of Justice.]{.underline}

And yet, there are limits to what can be achieved with the means to help
ensure that a recipient of U.S. made equipment "is complying with the
requirements imposed by the U.S. government with respect to use,
transfers, and security of defense articles and defense services; and
\[that\] such articles and services are being used for the purposes for
which they are provided".36

[A recent case where those limits are exceeded concerns deployment of
U.S. supplied goods by Saudi Arabia's armed forces.]{.underline} U.S.
arms export control authorities must have had reasonable assurance as to
the Saudi client's capacity and willingness to comply with the end-use
documentation of solely legitimate defensive use of the goods. [If the
Watch List led any red flags to be raised when the deal to supply such
goods was in the making, and even if such flags would have led to visits
in site, the final decision was to approve the arms
transfer.]{.underline} However as of mid-2015, some such equipment has
been used for offensive goals in operations, as a Saudi-led coalition
began deploying against Houthi strongholds in Yemen. [The deployments
were found to be in violation of international humanitarian
law.]{.underline} By 2016, the international Cluster Munitions Coalition
(CMC) reliably documented Saudi deployment of CBU-105 Sensor Fuzed

densely populated areas.37 CMC also revealed that "in recent years", a
Massachusetts-based company had obtained the licence from the U.S.
government to supply these weapons to Saudi Arabia (and other recipient
states that dispose of airborne means to deliver such weapons) under the
strict condition not to use these weapons in civilian areas.

Non-compliance with these end-use conditions was established by CMC, not
by Blue Lantern envoys. [The U.S. export control agencies are
nevertheless presumed eager to sanction non-compliant end-users, in line
with their mission, as well as within the legal framework that mandates
their activities.]{.underline} [**No information is available that the
U.S. export control system** (be that the Blue Lantern, or "Golden
Sentry" programme that concerns Foreign Military Sales of defence

for further supplies to the Saudi armed forces, nor to recover the
equipment that was transferred in the past, nor even to prevent further
unauthorised deployments of the equipment.]{.underline}**

A. Effectiveness of FMS End-Use Monitoring

[The AECA requires U.S. government agencies involved in arms transfers
to monitor the use of those arms by the recipient country]{.underline},
i.e., end-use monitoring ([EUM]{.underline}). 115Link to the text of the
note The DOS shares EUM responsibilities with the DoD: DOS administers
EUM for Direct Commercial Sales under a program called Blue Lantern,
while DoD administers EUM for all FMS under a program called Golden
Sentry. 116Link to the text of the note

The [EUM]{.underline} statutory [requirements]{.underline} are to
\"improve accountability\" for defense articles, to provide \"reasonable
assurance\" that the articles [are used consistent with the \"purposes
for which they are provided,\" and to prevent diversion]{.underline},
i.e., theft or illegal re-transfer. 117Link to the text of the note
Under Golden Sentry, there are two types of EUM: routine and enhanced.
118Link to the text of the note Generally, EUM under Golden Sentry
focuses on accountability, security, use and transfer or disposal of FMS
articles. 119Link to the text of the note Enhanced EUM measures\--such
as greater physical security/accountability requirements and possibly a
compliance assessment visit by DSCA\--are required for sensitive
articles and technologies such as NVDs, MANPADs, Advanced Medium Range
Air-to-Air Missiles (AMRAAM), cruise missiles (Tomahawk), and Unmanned
Aerial Vehicles (UAV). 120Link to the text of the note Routine EUM often
consists of a post-shipment check to ensure delivery of the articles by
the SCO, in conjunction with other duties. 121Link to the text of the
note

The recent GAO report discussing EUM highlights the difference between
DoD and DOS EUM procedures and database capabilities. 122Link to the
text of the note The report found \[\*215\] that the DoD EUM database,
the Security Cooperation Information Portal (SCIP), was capable of
confirming whether past inventories were conducted, but could not
confirm whether the inventories were conducted on schedule. The report
concluded, \"DoD does not currently have assurance that its personnel in
the Gulf countries completed past inventories on time, which may have
resulted in gaps in accounting for sensitive equipment shipped through
FMS.\" 123Link to the text of the note While the conclusion may be
accurate, the report may also mislead readers regarding DoD EUM
compliance. Specifically, Golden Sentry\'s inventory schedule is
self-imposed; AECA only requires \"improved accountability,\"
\"reasonable assurance\" of end-use and diversion prevention. 124Link to
the text of the note Measured against statutory requirements, DoD is
certainly compliant.

The same section of this report shows that the [six Gulf countries
surveyed purchased a total of 14,367 defense articles requiring enhanced
EUM as of August 2011, but 63 articles were lost or could not be
observed]{.underline}. 125Link to the text of the note The report does
not put the facts in context\--specifically, 63 [lost articles represent
less than one-half of one percent over three decades of FMS with six
different countries]{.underline}. 126Link to the text of the note
Moreover, [the majority of articles]{.underline} (73%) [transferred are
small, personal-sized NVDs]{.underline} which were sold beginning in the
1990s. 127Link to the text of the note [This feat of moveable property
accountability is remarkable by any standard, but particularly for a
military endeavor]{.underline}. 128Link to the text of the note [Such
positive results frequently escape U.S. military units conducting
inventories of U.S. equipment in garrison]{.underline}.

As these two examples show, [FMS EUM]{.underline} in the Gulf countries
**[meets or exceeds statutory requirements and has an effective
accountability record.]{.underline}** These positive aspects of FMS EUM
are not mentioned in the report, and tend to undermine the conclusion of
the report captured in the title, \"Implementation Gaps Limit the
Effectiveness of End-Use Monitoring.\" 129Link to the text of the note

[Post-delivery verification, end-use monitoring and exchange of relevant
information cannot guarantee that no more arms will be diverted from
legal exports. **It will remain inherently difficult to evaluate to what
extent the instruments discourage diversion schemes and effectively
prevent authorised arms transfers from becoming available to
unauthorised users.**]{.underline} Violations of non-re-export clauses
and other modes of illegal arms transfers are not usually advertised.
Such re-exports are unlikely to be reported -- especially in open
sources -- and evidence that they happened is rarely ever collated in
statistics. The [end-use monitoring]{.underline} instruments that have
recently been put in place [could create the illusion of control and
forge some sort of assurance that leads arms export licensing
authorities to OK end-users they would have had good reason to be
concerned about in earlier days.]{.underline}

[**These cases highlight the fact that things can and do go wrong after
arms are transferred,** regardless of the assessment
process]{.underline} that takes place before licences are issued. They
also point to the types of measures that Member States should consider
to either prevent misuse or diversion occurring, or to be quick to learn
of it when it does happen and take remedial steps to recover the
situation or prevent its repeat. Of **[course, almost by definition it
is impossible to know how frequently diversion takes
place]{.underline}**, **[and finding out is a large part of the
battle]{.underline}** (by definition, any examples we have are already
in the public domain, however there is no way of knowing how
representative these are). [In any event, Member States should be
building provision for comprehensive end-use checking, delivery
verification, follow-up monitoring and information-sharing as the means
by which the risks and consequences of diversion can be
minimised]{.underline}. Member States must stop regarding post-transfer
controls as a nonessential extra in the arms transfer control regime.
Instead, they should be seen as part of a virtuous transfer-control
circle -- measures taken after items are transferred can be used to
better inform assessment of subsequent licence applications.120

#### Geopolitics means arm sales remain

mba-alb

A recent case where those limits are exceeded concerns deployment of
U.S. supplied goods by Saudi Arabia's armed forces. [U.S. arms
export]{.underline} [control authorities must have had reasonable
assurance as to the Saudi client's capacity]{.underline} and willingness
to comply with the end-use documentation of solely legitimate defensive
use of the goods. **[If the Watch List led any red flags to be raised
when the deal to supply such goods was in the making, and even if such
flags would have led to visits in site, the final decision was to
approve the arms transfer]{.underline}**. [However as of mid-2015, some
such equipment has been used for offensive goals in
operations]{.underline}, as a Saudi-led coalition began deploying
against Houthi strongholds in Yemen[. The deployments were found to be
in violation of international humanitarian law]{.underline}. By 2016,
the international Cluster Munitions Coalition (CMC) reliably documented
Saudi deployment of CBU-105 Sensor Fuzed Weapons (weapons that disperse
canisters that release sub-munitions) in densely populated areas.37 CMC
also revealed that "in recent years", a Massachusetts-based company had
obtained the licence from the U.S. government to supply these weapons to
Saudi Arabia (and other recipient states that dispose of airborne means
to deliver such weapons) under the strict condition not to use these
weapons in civilian areas. [Non-compliance with these end-use conditions
was established by CMC, not by Blue Lantern envoys]{.underline}. The
U.S. export control agencies are nevertheless presumed eager to sanction
non-compliant end-users, in line with their mission, as well as within
the legal framework that mandates their activities. [No information is
available that the U.S. export control system]{.underline} (be that the
Blue Lantern, or "Golden Sentry" programme that concerns Foreign
Military Sales of defence articles and services via
government-to-government channels[) is currently taking action to recall
licences for further supplies to the Saudi armed forces, nor to recover
the equipment that was transferred in the]{.underline} [past, nor even
to prevent further unauthorised deployments of the
equipment.]{.underline} Proof of this unintended use would be expected
to feed into the Blue Lantern monitoring cycle, and as such provide the
U.S. export licensing authority with means to sanction this particular
violation of end-use conditions. These sanctions could become part of a
broader and longer-term endeavour to limit the use of any transferred
equipment to the specific importer and exporter agreed on at the time of
licensing[. Proven non-compliance with end-use documentation in one case
is sure to be noted and recorded in the Blue Lantern monitoring cycle.
Such records generate "flags" on its Watch List]{.underline}, [and can
impact decisions to authorise new export licences that identify the
once-non-compliant party as the end-user]{.underline}. In this
particular case, it is of note that Saudi armed forces hold a wide range
of U.S.- supplied goods. This context makes the Saudi armed forces
dependent on maintenance services and spare parts that the relevant U.S.
suppliers can continue to supply only if the U.S. export control
authority approves licence requests to that end. This gives the U.S.
arms export licensing system leverage to deny future licence
requests[**.** However, it would not seem certain that the leverage is
effectively used. **Geopolitical**]{.underline} **[considerations and
foreign policy choices may demand that the U.S. licensing authority
refrains from refusing further licence applications.]{.underline}**
[Unintended end-use of the cluster munition]{.underline}, as last
documented in February 2016, **[would appear likely to be downplayed by
the fact that these same Saudi forces are a major ally in the U.S.-led
airstrikes on Syria]{.underline}**. The discussed case can serve here as
a reminder that the situation in a recipient state may change. In Saudi
Arabia, the context of possession and use of the goods evolved
significantly over the past few years. In 2016 it no longer resembles
the context that U.S. (and many other Western) arms transfer control
authorities appraised in prior years, when they approved major export
licences to Saudi Arabia. These same export control authorities may not
come to the same decision about authorising transfer of the same goods
and same end-user, if the latter were subject of a new export licence
request. Transfer licences that were given at one time may be revoked,
to prevent more transfers taking place under the same licence. But
actual transfers authorised in the past when circumstances were
different are difficult to undo. In all likelihood, the recipient at
that time had intentions to use the goods in another way than a
"defensive mode" recorded in the end-use documentation that the
exporting country's authorities had judged bona fide. The type of
diversion in the documented case is one that takes transferred military
goods "away from intended end-use" at an appreciable time after
transfer. The diversion scheme, if there was one, could not possibly be
anticipated nor detected at the time the decision was made to authorise
that transfer.

### Grey Market

#### Stricter enforcement mechanism still [can't account]{.underline} for [grey-market items]{.underline} which creates [unidentifiable loopholes]{.underline}.

Foundations on issues relating to the intersection of military aid and

By contrast, in the black market, private dealers knowingly violate the
arms sales laws or policies of source, transit, and/or recipient states
for commercial gain. Also clearly within the black market are arms sales
to governments or guerrillas that have been placed under UN or other
legally binding arms embargoes. [Gray-market sales are **more
difficult** to classify. They include **legally questionable
transfers**, such as arms supplies authorized covertly by an exporting
government against the wishes of the importing government. Further
**complicating** the matter, many states have either **non-existent** or
**very weak** national laws and regulations in place to govern arms
production and trade, rendering distinctions about what is legal and
illegal **largely moot**.]{.underline} Moreover, the interactions
between legal and illegal markets are manifold. Arms that are originally
exported legally but that are not properly tracked or secured often fall
into illegal circulation---diversion, theft, and capture of state
security forces\' arms are a major source of black-market supply around
the world.

[From this brief survey it is clear that even among States recognised as
having relatively extensive end-use controls, no one country can be seen
to have a fully effective system. **The system in place in the US is the
most comprehensive, but nevertheless suffers from a lack of resources
and the fact that SALW issues are not prioritised, despite the
significant risks of diversion and misuse that accompany exports of
these weapons.**]{.underline} This underlines the importance of
establishing effective cooperation, including information sharing on
risks of diversion and misuse, amongst relevant actors. If the US, the
world's largest military exporter, has difficulties resourcing this
area, other, less affluent States will find operating alone even more
problematic.

Not all governments require end users to certify that weapons will only
be re-exported with the permission of the initial exporting authority.
In many cases, once weapons are in a particular state, it is up to that
state's government to decide upon re-exports. Again, the
[U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates [has the strictest
rules]{.underline} here, always insists on licensing re-exports even for
the export of components of weapon systems.[**19 This policy has brought
the United States in collision with other governments and the European
Union**,]{.underline} [which objects to US control over
components]{.underline} [that are used in the assembly of weapons in
Europe.]{.underline} This is part of a larger, controversial debate
about the appropriateness of extraterritoriality provisions.20 There
have been many cases of falsified end-user certificates. Arms dealers
and brokers have supplied licensing authorities with documents bearing
signatures of non-authorized persons and stating destinations that they
know to be incorrect. At least in the past, there existed a black market
for end-user certificates.21 **[State officials were willing to sign
false end-user certificates against the payment of certain
sums.]{.underline}** A number of such false end-user certificates have
been documented by experts monitoring arms embargoes. It is likely that
most falsifications of end-user certificates go by unnoticed, since the
widespread lack of end-user checks ---except in the case of the United
States---makes the detection of false end-use declarations largely
dependent on chance. For example, authorities may perhaps obtain reports
by NGOs, monitoring groups or journalists. End-user checks are difficult
but not impossible to carry out, as the US example shows. They require a
good legal basis, and staff with sufficient knowledge to inspect end
use. **[Many states are unwilling to follow the United States' lead to
base end-use inspection in domestic law]{.underline}**. An alternative
would be to require exporters to make the right of on-site inspection by
representatives from the exporting state a part of the arms transfer
contract. This also requires that governments reserve the right to
licence re-exports of arms

[Congress has long taken an interest in ensuring that arms sold to
foreign countries are used responsibly and for the purposes agreed upon
as part of their sale]{.underline} (a legal requirement for
certification that goes back to the 1960s). [In 1996, Congress amended
the AECA to include Section 40A (P.L. 104-164), which directs the
President to "establish a program that provides for end-use monitoring
in order to improve accountability with respect to defense articles
sold, leased, or exported under the AECA or FAA."]{.underline} 139 The
goals of end-use monitoring include preserving U.S. technological
superiority by impeding adversaries' access to sensitive items and
ensuring that arms are used solely by the intended recipients based on
the terms under which the sale is made. In addition, as part of the
standard terms and conditions of a letter of agreement (LOA), the
recipient country agrees to "permit observation and review by \...
representatives of the U.S. Government with regards to the use of such
articles." 140

[End-use monitoring has been an important consideration in evaluating
arms sales to Iraq, as Members of Congress try to balance the Iraqi
government's need for weapons to use against the Islamic State and other
threats with the potential for those arms to fall into the wrong hands,
including the very groups their use is intended to combat.]{.underline}
Since 2015, there have been widespread reports of the use of U.S.
weaponry by Popular Mobilization Forces or Units (PMFs or PMUs), some of
whom are supported by Iran. U.S. officials have reportedly denied the
existence of any confirmed instances of Iraqi forces transferring U.S.
arms to PMFs, and their Iraqi counterparts have stated that all
U.S.-provided weapons remain under Iraqi army control.141 [However,
**the challenges of tracking the whereabouts of U.S. arms are
considerable in a country that has received tens of billions of dollars
of weapons in the past decade alone**. 142]{.underline}

[**The challenges of accounting for the whereabouts of U.S. arms have
perhaps grown as the United States has transferred more weapons into
Iraq to help Iraqi forces confront the Islamic State.** In May 2017,
Amnesty International obtained (via a Freedom of Information Act
request) and released a September 2016 DOD audit that determined that
the Army "did not have effective controls" to track equipment transfers
provided to Iraqi forces through the Iraq Train and Equip Fund
(ITEF).]{.underline} The audit characterized the Army's recordkeeping as
inconsistent, out of date, and prone to human error.143 A DOD
spokeswoman stated, "**[The bottom line is that the US military does not
have a means to track equipment that has been taken from the Government
of Iraq by ISIL.]{.underline}**" 144 The implications for these sales
under the AECA are unclear. The DOD spokeswoman cited above explained
the situation by saying that "the current conflict in Iraq limits some
aspects of \... monitoring activities, including travel to many areas of
Iraq and access to Iraqi units in combat areas, as well as combat use,
damage and losses of war material." 145

#### Arms diversion lead to global violence and war

**Schroeder 7** -- Matt, "The Illicit Arms Trade," FAS,
<https://fas.org/asmp/campaigns/smallarms/IssueBrief3ArmsTrafficking.html>

[Illicit arms trafficking **fuels civil wars**, contributes to
sky-rocketing crime rates and feeds the arsenals of the world\'s worst
terrorists.]{.underline} Particularly troubling is the illicit trade in
[small arms and light weapons]{.underline} (SA/LW). SA/LW account for an
[estimated 60-90% of the 100,000+ conflict deaths each year]{.underline}
(Small Arms Survey 2005) [and tens of thousands of additional deaths
outside of war zones]{.underline}. They are also the weapons of choice
for many terrorists. Of the roughly 175 terrorist attacks identified in
last year\'s State Department report on Patterns of Global Terrorism,
approximately half were committed with small arms or light weapons.
Stemming the flow of these weapons is incredibly difficult. Unlike
weapons of mass destuction, small arms and many light weapons have
legitimate military, law enforcement, and/or sporting and recreational
uses. These uses preclude the types of outright bans on manufacture,
stockpiling and sales imposed - with some success - on landmines and
chemical and biological weapons. Instead, governments try to prevent the
diversion and misuse of SA/LW without unduly infringing upon legitimate
use and trade. This is no small feat. Plentiful, easy to conceal, and
lethal, SA/LW are a smuggler\'s dream and a law enforcement nightmare.
[**Hundreds of thousands** of small arms in leaky government arsenals
are vulnerable to theft, loss and diversion]{.underline}. Once acquired
by traffickers, these weapons are smuggled across national borders in
every conceivable way. They are hidden under sacks of vegetables in the
back of pick up trucks, packed into household appliances that are then
loaded onto cargo ships, even air-dropped out of old Soviet military
transport planes. [In the hands of terrorists and other criminals, these
weapons have the capacity to kill]{.underline} dozens, even **[hundreds,
of innocent civilians]{.underline}**. A shoulder-fired surface-to-air
missile - available on the black market for as little as a few thousand
dollars - can bring down a commercial airliner. Even a couple of \$100
assault rifles can inflict horrendous casualties, as evidenced by the
November 1997 terrorist attack in Luxor, Egypt, during which 6
terrorists armed only with assault rifles, pistols and knives
systematically slaughtered 58 tourists.

[It\'s well known that the United States exports billions of dollars\'
worth of arms and ammunition]{.underline} to its allies. What isn\'t as
widely understood is that many of the guns it supplies to \"partner
forces\" fighting wars in the Middle East - particularly to rebels in
Syria - are Soviet-style munitions such as RPGs and Kalashnikovs which
are obtained from manufacturers in Bulgaria, Serbia and other Eastern
European countries. There are many reasons for this, of which the most
obvious are that fighters in the region have long been familiar with
these types of weapons and would rather use them than anything else, and
they are relatively easy to obtain. Another reason is that [providing
guns which can\'t easily be traced back to the US puts a politically
convenient degree of separation between the US and those to whom the
arms go - even when the supplies have been sanctioned at the highest
level]{.underline}. Nevertheless, [the process still necessarily
involves complicated procurement and supply routes]{.underline}, [and a
less than diligent application of the \"rules\" that are theoretically
supposed to constrain the international sale and movement of guns into
such a volatile environment]{.underline} - embargos, sanctions,
\"[end-user\" certification]{.underline} and so on. **[It]{.underline}**
often **[requires officials to turn a blind eye]{.underline}** to less
than satisfactory paperwork, the use of private contractors to act as
cut-outs and trainers, and middlemen and dead-of-night cargo flights to
and from strange, out-of-the-way places. Meanwhile, a host of other
players, from Russia, to Turkey, to Saudi Arabia and Iran are all doing
variants of the same thing: providing deadly weapons to their own
proxies, which in the Syrian conflict alone has contributed to a death
toll of around 500,000, the vast majority of whom are civilians.
**[It\'s]{.underline}** also **[inevitable]{.underline}**, in this murky
world of shifting alliances and often hidden deals with irregular
militias on an ever-fluctuating battleground, **[that some of these arms
do not always end up where they were meant to]{.underline}**.

[To reduce unintentional diversion to armed groups, it is essential for
states to have responsibility over both their exports and imports. This
requires monitoring over international transfers as well as state agents
and weapon stockpiles]{.underline}: in other words, to increase both
internal and external monitoring[. We argue there are five aspects to
this monitoring]{.underline}: (1) Coordination and Oversight:
[Coordination on arms procurement by relevant government
agencies]{.underline} reduces duplication and [improves transparency and
oversight]{.underline} on not just on the arms procurement but also on
the activities of government and private agents involved. **[In most
countries, several agencies are involved in arms
procurement]{.underline}**. **[This has long been recognised as a source
of potential unintentional diversion]{.underline}**, simply **[because
it is almost impossible to coordinate government agencies/departments,

Post-delivery verification, end-use monitoring and **[exchange of

discourage diversion schemes]{.underline}** and effectively prevent

Violations of non-re-export clauses and other modes of illegal arms
transfers are not usually advertised. [Such re-exports are unlikely to
be reported -- especially in open sources -- and evidence that they
happened is rarely ever collated in statistics]{.underline}. [The
end-use monitoring instruments that have recently been put in place
could create the illusion of control]{.underline} and forge some sort of
assurance that leads arms export licensing authorities to OK end-users
they would have had good reason to be concerned about in earlier days.
Finally, even if transferred arms remain under the control of the
designated users and in the country that the end-use documentation
described as their destination**[, the use of the arms is not guaranteed
to be restricted to the purposes described in that
documentation]{.underline}**. Deployment for other purposes is a more
visible type of diversion than are hidden re-exports. Under current
conditions, however, such visible unintended use has not given
sufficient ground to try and recuperate the arms, or ensure that further
deployment is restricted to intended end-use.

controls as a nonessential extra in the arms transfer control regime.

better inform assessment of subsequent licence applications.120

postshipment checks, and when to close checks, and • stipulate that when
postshipment checks are requested, U.S. embassy personnel should conduct

e\. [End-Use and End-User Monitoring Requirements Are]{.underline}
Insufficient Both ITAR and EARs attempt to curtail the transfer of
sensitive technologies through end-use monitoring requirements.
Technologies transferred under ITAR may not be used for unauthorized
purposes and the receiving party must agree not to re-transfer title or
possession of such defense articles or services.81 The ITAR end-use and
end-user requirements for exported items controlled under the USML are
monitored under the Blue Lantern Program, which reviews the end-use of
defense articles, defense services, and brokering activities exported
through commercial channels. 82 While [the Blue Lantern
program]{.underline} does make strides to monitor the enduse of those
technologies most vulnerable to exploitation, [it is a resource
constrained program]{.underline}.83 In [2012, the Blue Lantern Program
on a budget of \$2.1 million was only able to initiate 820 checks on
end-use and was only able to close 706 cases out of the 86,000 license
applications received for the same year]{.underline}.84 [This means that
less than 1% of the most sensitive technologies exported from the United
States were verified to be compliant]{.underline} with end-use and
end-user requirements.85 The EARs is similarly littered with
prohibitions on end-use and end-users and restrictions on re-transfer to
third parties.**[86 Despite these restrictions, enforcement of end-use
monitoring is often non-existent]{.underline}**. For example,
Congressional hearings after the Gulf War revealed that of the 771
export licenses granted for Iraq, only one was ever checked for its
end-use to ensure it was eing utilized for civilian purposes.87 A former
Chairman of the House Oversight Committee complained the "Commerce
Department issues licenses for commodities not knowing if the goods are
what they purport to be; ever reach their intended destination; or are
used for the stated legitimate purpose."88 He further noted certificates
not to re-export are "little more than paper salve to the conscience of
the government and U.S. corporations" and do little to prevent the
retransfer to sensitive technologies.89 The lack of monitoring under the
ITAR and EARs undermines the objectives of each regulation. Exported
sensitive technologies are easily being converted into destructive
devices that threat U.S. nation security interests.90 Partner and allied
nations that do not enforce U.S. end-use monitoring requirements are
oftentimes found to be the suppliers of otherwise controlled U.S.
technologies.91 Without a strong mechanism to ensure end-use and
end-user monitoring, the United States effort to prevent the transfer of
sensitive technologies to global bad actors is compromised.

**[As the leading arms supplier -- and as the world's oldest, most
widely respected democracy -- the United States has a special obligation
to set strict standards]{.underline}** **[about]{.underline}** the kinds
of **[governments that receive U.S. weaponry.]{.underline}** **[If we
don't do it, no other nation will]{.underline}**. As Jimmy Carter put it
in 1976, "we cannot have it both ways. [We can't be both the world's
leading champion of peace and the world's leading supplier of
arms."\[]{.underline}3\] I have been working on the issue of U.S. arms
transfers since the late 1970s, when the Carter administration's
policies of promoting human rights and arms transfer restraint were
beginning to give way to allegedly more "realistic," hardline policies.
Under the guise of strengthening longstanding allies like the Shah of
Iran and winning over former adversaries like the People's Republic of
China, the Carter administration walked away from its commitment to
reduce the United States role as the world's leading arms merchant.\[4\]
More than twenty years later, I believe more strongly than ever that
when it comes to arming human rights abusers, the self-appointed
"realists" are the ones who are living in a dream world, while the
advocates of restricting arms exports to repressive regimes are the ones
who are grounded in reality. From Iran to Indonesia, and from Central
America to the [Congo, our nation's role as the world's leading arms
merchant has done far more harm than good]{.underline}. **[Using arms
sales as a way to win friends and intimidate adversaries has not only
fostered serious human rights abuses in the recipient nations; it has
also undermined U.S. interests by spreading instability and fueling
conflict]{.underline}**.\[5\] [It's time to make human rights the
primary consideration in U.S. arms sales decision-making]{.underline},
not just one factor among many. We need to move beyond the point where,
on issues of national security concern, human rights considerations are
routinely cast aside in favor of more pressing, "pragmatic" concerns. At
the dawn of a new millennium, in the first few months of a new
administration and a new Congress, it is time to take a serious look at
the impact of U.S. arms sales on human rights with an eye towards
changing our arms sales policies for the better. It is my hope that
today's hearings will be an important step in that process. U.S. Policy:
Rhetoric Meets Reality [On paper, the United States probably has the
best laws anywhere on the issue of arms exports.]{.underline} On arms
and human rights, Section 502B of the Foreign Assistance Act mandates
that "no security assistance may be provided to any country the
government of which engages in a consistent pattern of gross violations
of internationally recognized human rights." On arms and aggression,
Section 4 of the Arms Export Control Act authorizes provision of U.S.
military equipment and training only for purposes of internal security,
"legitimate self-defense," or participation in United Nations
peacekeeping operations or other operations consistent with the U.N.
charter.\[6\] [In practice, U.S. arms transfer policy diverges sharply
from these sound principles of human rights and
non-]{.underline}aggression. Nearly six years ago, in one of the first
major research reports produced by my project, U.S. Weapons at War, we
took a look at just how large the gap between rhetoric and reality is in
U.S. arms transfer policy. I won't bore you with all the details, but I
will cite some of the relevant findings: In the ten years from 1986 to
1995, the United States had delivered \$42 billion worth of armaments to
parties to 45 ongoing conflicts. Of the significant ethnic and
territorial conflicts under way during 1993/94 90 percent of them -- 45
out of 50 -- involved forces that had received U.S. weaponry or military
technology in the period leading up to the conflict. In a painful
demonstration of the "boomerang effect," U.S. arms or U.S. military
technology found its way into the hands of U.S. adversaries in Panama,
Iraq, Somalia, and Haiti. In addition, a significant portion of the \$6
billion in covert U.S. arms and training that went to Afghan rebel
groups in the 1980s was funneled to right-wing Islamic fundamentalist
forces that have utilized these resources to attack U.S. allies and U.S.
citizens.\[7\]

[By correcting this imbalance]{.underline}, **[H.R. 7080 will open
another avenue to ending U.S. enabling of other governments' gross
violations of international humanitarian and human rights
laws]{.underline}**. Nowhere is this avenue more needed than for Yemen's
internationalized civil war. There, parties to the conflict routinely
conduct indiscriminate attacks on civilians and have created a
humanitarian crisis that has pushed millions to the brink of starvation.
Yet, it is Saudi Arabia and the UAE, using U.S.-manufactured weapons and
logistical support, that have caused the majority of the conflict's
recorded civilian casualties. Causing further concern, a new documentary
aired by Deutsche Welle, presents credible evidence that the coalition
states have diverted U.S.-manufactured armored vehicles to unaccountable
non-state militias. Admittedly, the Senate has rarely made a serious
attempt to block an arms sale by resolution of disapproval, but support
for exercising greater Congressional oversight over arms sales seems to
be on the rise. And even when a resolution of disapproval fails to pass,
**[mere consideration of the legislation can send clear signals to the
executive branch and recipient countries]{.underline}** alike, **[and
can stimulate valuable policy debate]{.underline}**. While S.J. Res. 39,
a 2016 effort to block tank sales to Saudi Arabia, mustered 27 votes,
S.J. Res. 42, a June 2017 measure to freeze a sale of precision-guided
munitions to Saudi Arabia, garnered 47. The administration has not moved
forward with a further sale of as many as 120,000 precision munitions to
both Saudi Arabia and the UAE due to Senate opposition; the weapons'
traceable serial numbers, as damning as "made in the USA" stickers,
could embroil the United States in further strikes on buses, hospitals,
and homes. While the threat of unicameral opposition has worked for now,
the reforms advanced by H.R. 7080 would further increase the chances for
debate on arms sales in the Congress, and create a more efficient path
for the House and Senate to indefinitely arrest a sale. Had the
procedures outlined in H.R. 7080 been in place in June 2017, H.J. Res.
102 (the House companion to S.J. Res. 42), could have forced a vote on a
motion to discharge instead of dying quietly in committee, creating a
debate that, as it did on the Senate side, swayed moderate offices
against the sale and focused a news cycle on U.S. complicity in
Saudi-led coalition attacks on civilians. While the most recent and
egregious example, [Yemen is not the only case where enhanced
Congressional oversight is necessary to add reasonable constraints to
the arms sales process.]{.underline} By some credible estimates, the
[U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates [sells arms, including bombs
and missiles, to at least 62 countries that are an active party to a
conflict]{.underline}. Some countries to whom the United States sells
arms, such as Bahrain and Egypt, have demonstrated a consistent pattern
of human rights violations; others present a very clear risk of misuse
or diversion, or even the potential for mass atrocities. And [some
countries with lower levels of capacity simply require a greater degree
of due diligence to ensure equipment can be used
appropriately]{.underline}. **[If H.R. 7080 makes it more likely that
Congress could exercise more meaningful oversight in even a handful of
these cases, the risk of U.S. complicity in human rights abuses or the
next humanitarian disaster, wherever it is, could be meaningfully
diminished -- and at minimal opportunity cost]{.underline}**. H.R. [7080
does not have to become law this Congress to have an impact -- advocates
should view it as an organizing tool around which to rally,]{.underline}
**[and that could ease the way to reforms small and large which can
check the executive's nearly unfettered prerogative to sell weapons to
any regime]{.underline}**, regardless of their crimes. To begin, H.R.
7080 does not have to pass for next year's House to respect its
provisions as an intra-chamber rule: [regardless of eventual passage,
Democratic leadership should open this procedural path to the floor for
joint resolutions of disapproval as a matter of course]{.underline}.
Furthermore, if H.R. 7080 is reintroduced in the 116thCongress, it
should be resurfaced alongside a host of measures to strengthen
Congress's hand in overall arms export policy. These can include
requiring detailed and unclassified answers from the departments of
State and Defense concerning the likelihood that a sale of certain items
will exacerbate armed conflict or spur an arms race (theoretically a
judgment the executive already makes under AECA) and outlining robust
processes for monitoring the way weapons' are used among recipients with
a history of rights violations or violations of the laws of armed
conflict, and those for which the indicators suggest a high risk of
future violations. Congress should also consider lowering notification
thresholds, so that members can vet arms sales valued at less than \$50
million. The time is also long past for Congress to unequivocally
clarify that the Leahy Law applies to Foreign Military Sales (FMS) and
Direct Commercial Sales (DCS), thereby prohibiting State and Defense
from permitting the transfer or maintenance of defense articles to
security forces that have committed unconscionable human rights
violations with impunity. There is no simple trick to ending the
devastation yielded by the war and intervention in Yemen, which has
directly killed at least 57,000, contributed to the further deaths of
tens of thousands of children per year from preventable causes, and
threatened 14 million with famine. Yet without a congressional freeze on
weapons to the coalition states, there will never be enough political
space for peace negotiations to take root. So long as short-term profit
motive driving executive branch arms sales policy supersedes a
reasonable modicum of self-restraint, the Congress, and H.R. 7080
present the best opportunity to limit the risk that American weapons
will be involved in -- or aggravate -- both Yemen's catastrophe and the
next humanitarian crisis.

on Small Arms Transfers: A Human Rights Perspective," Working Paper 43,
<https://www.du.edu/korbel/hrhw/workingpapers/2007/43-waltz-2007_rev.pdf)//BB>

[The question of [who should receive US weapons has been
viewed]{.mark}]{.underline} primarily [[as a foreign policy
matter]{.mark}, and the State Department has been assigned principal
responsibility]{.underline} for overseeing the approval of authorized
arms deals. Full responsibility for the broad policy on small arms
transfers, however, is shared by several cabinet level offices,
including the Departments of Defense, Commerce, Justice, Homeland
Security, and Treasury as well as Department of State. Congressional
authority and oversight for implementing programs is exercised through
the House and Senate Appropriations committees, the Armed Forces
committees, and the International Relations committees---and various
subcommittees. More than a dozen quasi-independent agencies are involved
in the oversight and enforcement of the policy and its implementing
framework, with nearly as many distinct programs. It is only in
reviewing the array of these programs that the principled policy can be
fully appreciated. To facilitate that task, I have drawn on the
descriptive framework employed by Richard Grimmett in a 2006 background
paper on US small arms policy prepared for members of the US Congress.
As a publication of the bi-partisan Congressional Research Service, this
presentation can be viewed as a quasi-official view of current policy.
Grimmett describes US policy as a multi-pronged approach with four
principal objectives: • Efforts to curb black market or unauthorized
transfers of small arms to zones of conflict, to terrorists, to
international criminal organizations, and to drug traffickers • Attempt
to raise the arms export standards of other nations to US standards •
Streamline and strengthen US export procedures to improve accountability
without interfering with the legal trade in and transfer of arm0073 •
Support the destruction of excess stockpiles of small arms, particularly
in regions where conflicts have ended.18 In the numbered sections below,
programs that relate to each of these four objectives are discussed in
turn. 1. [[Curbing Black Market Transfers]{.underline}]{.mark} The first
element in [the multi-pronged policy]{.underline} as outlined in
Grimmett's CRS report [[involves]{.mark} efforts to curb]{.underline}
black market or [unauthorized transfers]{.underline} of small arms [to
zones of conflict, to terrorists, to international criminal
organizations, and to drug traffickers]{.underline}. Programs to
implement this prong of the policy range from [[criminal prosecutions
and law enforcement actions]{.underline}]{.mark} to end-use monitoring
and training programs for industry compliance. This is the most complex
aspect of the policy and as shown in Table 1, responsibility for
implementation is shared by five key agencies. Most of the illegal
traffic in weapons across US borders is in the outbound direction.
Although US Customs and Border Patrol have occasionally intercepted
small arms at or near import checkpoints,19 the most serious concern
extends from military weapons and defense articles procured in the US or
US territories and intended for illegal export abroad. Agents with the
Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco,
Firearms and Explosives (ATF) and the new Immigration Customs
Enforcement Agency (ICE) housed in the Department of Homeland Security
regularly intercept and prosecute arms deals involving light weapons. In
2006, for example, ICE agents foiled a plot to export scores of
state-of-the-art firearms, machine guns, sniper rifles and
surface-to-air missiles to Tamil Tigers in Sri Lanka.20 Illicit
commodities are often trafficked together, and it is not unusual for
enforcement actions to draw in agencies that are not usually responsible
for arms trafficking cases, such as the Drug Enforcement Administration
(DEA).21 In some cases, the ATF's National Tracing Center may also be
asked to assist with international criminal investigations through crime
gun analysis and its ability to track the movement of US-origin
firearms.22 Over a two-year period in the late 1990's, more than 150
cases investigated by ATF involved international small arms
trafficking.23 The law enforcement powers of these various agencies are
supplemented by the Treasury Department's Office of Foreign Assets
Control, which has authority under the Emergency Economic Powers Act to
freeze foreign assets under US jurisdiction. In April 2005, for example,
OFAC froze the assets of four individuals and 30 companies linked to
Russian arms trafficker Victor Bout.24 In addition to enforcement
mechanisms designed to stop criminal activity, the US has developed
programs to survey and track legitimate end-use of defense items sold
under commercial contract or supplied directly through
government-to-government deals. [Statutes impose constraints on both the
immediate end-user and eventual re-transfer]{.underline} of items on the
Munitions List, and if sufficient warning signs are triggered,
transactions may be subject to close scrutiny and sanction. Since 1990
the DDTC has run an inspection program for commercial sales known as
Blue Lantern,25 and in 2001, after a highly critical report from the US
General Accounting Office prompted Congressional intervention,26 the
Department of Defense launched a similar program, dubbed Golden Sentry.
Although neither program focuses primarily on small arms, [the [Blue
Lantern]{.mark} program [is required by statute to include among its
priorities weapons that can be]{.mark} [easily diverted, and Golden
Sentry includes surveillance]{.mark} of shoulder-fired
Stingers.]{.underline}27 From 2002-2004, Blue Lantern checks resulted in
52 unfavorable "determinations" involving small arms. A full 80% of
these incidents concerned arms destined for Latin American
countries\--with Bolivia heading the list\--but clients in Switzerland,
UK, Canada and Israel were also found suspect.28 The Blue Lantern
program rarely investigates more than 1% of all commercial transactions,
29 but **[[well publicized and]{.mark} [specific
results]{.mark}]{.underline}** [have earned it considerable respect
abroad]{.underline}.30 [In some cases, DDTC inquiries]{.underline}
**[[have led importing]{.mark} [countries to impose their own sanctions
or restrictions]{.mark}]{.underline}**.31 **[[Enforcement efforts and
dramatic]{.mark} [arrests naturally draw the most
attention]{.mark}]{.underline}**, but to curb black market activity, the
US actually places greatest emphasis on preventive actions and voluntary
compliance. As both a punitive measure and a preventive tool to
discourage illicit deals, agencies within the State Department and
Commerce Department collaborate to maintain and publicize lists of
parties who are debarred or otherwise restricted from trade in defense
or dual-use commodities. The DDTC screens export license applications
against a watchlist that in 2006 included more than 130,000 foreign and
domestic individuals and companies, and it also maintains a publicly
accessible list of embargoed countries.32 The Commerce Department's
Bureau of Industry and Security (BIS) gathers in one site a set of six
lists for exporters to check to ensure that their transactions do not
include parties debarred under ITAR provisions or are otherwise
restricted from the trade in defense or dual-use commodities.

[Today]{.underline}, four years later, [we have converted many of our
objectives into concrete regulations]{.underline}. With a few
exceptions, the U.S. Munitions List (USML) is being made into a positive
list that controls only items that provide the United States with a
significant military or intelligence advantage. Militarily less
sensitive items such as parts and components have been and continue to
be transferred from the licensing jurisdiction of State to that of
Commerce. License Exception Strategic Trade Authorization (STA) provides
flexible and refined licensing arrangements for trade with and among
close allies. **[Enhanced compliance and enforcement measures create
effective safeguards to deter diversion and misuse of controlled
items]{.underline}**. Although the government must make the final call
on what is in our foreign policy and national security interests, [**our
rules need to be transparent and predictable** so]{.underline}
[that]{.underline} you---[the]{.underline} manufacturing and exporting
[community---can be reliable, predictable, and successful
exporters]{.underline}. II. Efficiency As I stated at the 2010 Update
Conference, the [success]{.underline} of ECR [rests on two fundamental
principles]{.underline}: (**[1) the rules should be transparent and
predictable]{.underline}**; and (2**[) we must have]{.underline}**
streamlined processes and **[higher fences]{.underline}** [to control
sensitive items appropriately while facilitating exports of less
sensitive items to destinations and end users that do not pose
substantial national security, proliferation, foreign policy, human
rights, or similar concerns.]{.underline} To review briefly, we began
the United States Munitions List (USML) review process in 2010, and that
process has resulted in the removal, as far as we could, of the basket
categories that until now have accounted for about half of the 85,000
licenses issued annually by the Department of State. Military items that
do not warrant continued control on the USML are becoming subject to the
Export Administration Regulations (EAR) and the new \"600 series\"
controls on the Commerce Control List (CCL). At the risk of repeating
myself, transferring items to the licensing jurisdiction of the CCL is
not a decontrol. We made these changes because Commerce\'s regulations
allow for country-based license exceptions as well as distinctions based
on the technical parameters of an item. This is important because the
EAR enable the government to \"right-size\" controls on less sensitive
military items, such as parts and components for a military vehicle,
that are destined for our country\'s allies and other multilateral
control partners. Commerce and State have published final rules covering
controls on 15 categories of the CCL and USML. Commerce also published
in April 2013 a transition rule describing how items previously
controlled by the ITAR are dealt with under the EAR. In January 2013,
President Obama signed legislation restoring his authority to determine
the appropriate export controls for satellites and related items. The
May 2014 Commerce and State final satellite rules will transfer many
items to the CCL, including commercial communications and lower
performing remote sensing satellites, ground control systems, and
radiation-hardened microelectronics formerly controlled in Category XV
of the ITAR. The radiation-hardened microelectronics portions of the
rules took effect June 27. The rest of the rules will take effect
November 10. Turning to military electronics, the July 1, 2014 Commerce
and State rules add to the CCL certain military electronics equipment
and related articles formerly controlled by USML Category XI, plus
certain cryogenic and superconductive equipment that have been
controlled by \"catch-all\" provisions of the ITAR. The addition of
software and technology for certain wing folding systems to Commerce
ECCNs took effect on the date of publication. The other provisions of
Commerce rule will be effective on December 30, 2014. Commerce also
published on July 1st a notice requesting information about civil end
uses of microwave monolithic integrated circuit, or MMIC, power
amplifiers, as well as certain microwave transistors that will be
controlled as \"600-series\" items. The results of the massive list
review exercise, including the satellite and electronics rules, provide
exporters with a number of benefits, including: • vastly improved
interoperability with our closest friends and allies; • availability of
25% de minimis treatment to non-embargoed destinations, which should go
far toward accomplishing Defense Secretary Gates\'s instruction to
reduce incentives for non-U.S. companies to design out or avoid
U.S.-origin content and services; • eligibility for various license
exceptions, notably License Exceptions STA, GOV (for certain government
end users), and RPL (for replacement parts); • elimination, in many
cases, of the requirement for Manufacturing License Arrangements and
Technical Assistance Agreements---though we continue to control releases
of technology through simpler BIS authorizations; • ability to apply for
a license before a purchase order has been received; • elimination of
registration requirements; • elimination of defense service controls,
though again, we continue to control releases of technology in other,
simpler ways; • elimination of brokering constraints for less sensitive
military items, though we still control the transfer of the items
themselves; and • no registration or licensing fees. Many satellite and
electronics items that have been transferred to Commerce will be
eligible for License Exception STA, which permits the export of certain
items to 36 allied and friendly countries. STA in effect established a
license-free zone to cover the first transaction while creating new
safeguards to ensure that items are not diverted outside the designated
country group and the designated end users within that group. III.
Education and compliance [A core principle for our export control system
is ensuring an informed regulated commun]{.underline}ity**[. Neither you
nor we can reap the benefits of ECR without ensuring that the regulated
community understands and complies with the rules.]{.underline}** The
list review rules strengthen our national security. They also assist
you---our manufacturing and exporting community---by making it easier to
market to our closest friends and allies. There is no free lunch,
however, and ECR increases your compliance responsibilities. A more
nuanced export control system means a more complex system. We could have
a simpler system that maintains controls on virtually everything. But
the price for removing some license requirements is greater nuance and
greater reliance upon exporters to see to compliance. We in BIS are few
in number. We rely on industry as the front line in educating not only
internally, but also externally---the supplier base, and where
practicable, the customer base as well. The keys to successful
compliance include internal coordination---How has your company
developed and coordinated its internal ECR planning, ranging from the
training of staff, to reclassifying products, to revamping your IT
compliance tools? A second key is communication---How have you engaged
and trained your supplier base and your customers? If you are a U.S.
subsidiary of a foreign owned company, what compliance training and
processes are you providing to your foreign parent? Finally, have you
engaged in early collaboration with the U.S. Government to address
complex cases or instances where you may have violated our rules? Since
2010, we have been working hard to get the word out. BIS provides
comprehensive outreach services to exporters, ranging from seminars, to
online interactive tools, to weekly teleconferences, to one-on-one
exporter counselling. Notwithstanding fiscal austerity, the Bureau
conducted more than 200 ECR-related outreach activities during FY 2013,
including weekly interactive teleconferences, open to all, that are
conducted by Assistant Secretary Kevin Wolf. As we continue to implement
ECR, we will offer training materials, conduct webinars, and undertake
related actions, including the possibility of conducting joint outreach
to your foreign partners. It is imperative, though, that you play an
important role in educating your employees, suppliers, and customer
base. We are continuing to expand our public education effort, including
developing partnerships with non-profit educational groups representing
defense exporters, many of which are small and medium-sized enterprises.
Many of the items transferring from the USML to the CCL are manufactured
by small businesses. The Bureau is committed to helping our nation\'s
business, particularly small businesses, reach their commercial
potential while respecting U.S. national security. On Thursday,
representatives from the Small Business Administration and the Minority
Business Development Agency will participate in the Roundtable sessions
on exporting and small business. IV. Enforcement **[The enhancement of
our export compliance and enforcement capabilities is essential to the
success of ECR]{.underline}**. [We are coordinating interagency efforts
to conserve finite resources, increase our visibility into foreign
parties of concern, provide more clarity to exporters on how to address
red flags, and continue a layered approach to verifying
compliance.]{.underline} In response to current events and to concerns
that you have voiced to us, we will present a cyber threat panel this
morning comprising government leaders from various cyber disciplines.
They are here to explain the evolving threat posed to the United States,
as well as to discuss resources that are available to help defend
against those threats. Tomorrow afternoon Assistant Secretary David
Mills will discuss in depth the evolution of the Office of Export
Enforcement and the Office of Enforcement Analysis into a sophisticated
law enforcement agency, with criminal investigators and enforcement
analysts collaborating with our licensing officers to identify and act
upon violations. We have created the Export Enforcement Coordination
Center (E2C2) and the Information Triage Unit (ITU). The E2C2 ensures
that export enforcement agencies talk to one another and share relevant
information, while the ITU facilitates the review of license
applications by compiling, coordinating, and reporting intelligence
about foreign parties. Last December, BIS published a final rule that
strengthens the Unverified List (UVL) by increasing U.S. Government
visibility into transactions involving foreign parties whose bona fides
BIS has been unable to verify. We amended the regulations to (1) require
exporters to file an Automated Export System record for exports
involving a party listed on the UVL, and (2) suspend the availability of
license exceptions for parties listed on the UVL. In June, BIS added 29
persons to the UVL; BIS could not verify their bona fides because an
end-use check could not be completed satisfactorily. BIS is continuing
the layered approach to verifying compliance with License Exception STA.
The review of AES data, exporter, and consignee records, plus some
on-site document reviews, has resulted in a high degree of compliance
with the provisions of STA. We will continue to review STA transactions
to guard against misuse. [Finally, it is important to repeat that in our
enforcement, we are trying to focus on truly bad actors]{.underline},
not those who have a decent compliance program, make a mistake, and work
with us to remedy the situation. V. The Export Control Reform Box Score
What have been the results of the ECR national security investment to
date? Between October 15, 2013 and July 27th of this year, the number of
Commerce-specific ECR exports related to \"600 series\" items has
reached 29,000, with a value of \$1 billion. BIS\'s Munitions Control
Division has processed more than 5000 licenses with an average
processing time of 15.3 days. Exporters now can use STA and other
license exceptions to facilitate exports to key allies. STA has been
used for more than 3700 transactions. Exporters also have used other
license exceptions such as RPL, GOV, and Temporary Exports for an
additional 7800 transactions. The benefits include: • timely exports to
key defense allies; • no unexpected license provisos or conditions; •
lower Defense Department acquisition and research costs; • enhanced U.S.
and partner affordability throughout the product life cycle; and •
reduction of the licensing burden for exporters. The statistics I\'ve
cited will continue to grow as additional CCL categories become eligible
for \"600 series\" licensing treatment and/or license exceptions, and as
existing State Department licenses for these items are used up or
expire. VI. Other ECR Activities We have made significant progress but
more work remains to be done. In the past year, working closely with the
Department of Defense, BIS has made significant progress in converting
the interagency aspects of its export licensing from our thirty year-old
ECASS I.T. system to the Department of Defense\'s USXPORTS system. As
you may recall, the President directed that as part of the ECR
initiative, all U.S. Government agencies involved in export licensing
join USXPORTS. We have started the important late stage of this effort
known as end-to-end testing, and I\'m hopeful that all work will be
completed within the next few months. VII. Conclusion The success of
paradigm-changing initiatives such as ECR does not occur overnight.
Rather, it takes place in stages, much as a large building is
constructed starting with the foundation. Together, we have built the
foundation for a 21st Century export control system, establishing a
ground floor of efficient regulations that allow you---the
exporters---to make use of Commerce Department licenses and license
exceptions with appropriate compliance safeguards. **[Now we must
complete the higher floors by focusing on]{.underline}** education and
**[compliance to facilitate implementation of our rules.]{.underline}**
We look forward to your insights and questions. Thank you for your
continuing partnership and your participation in this conference.

Predictable foreign aid is important

[My research on foreign aid diplomacy suggests that there is yet another
reason we should care about the proposed cuts. Here's why:
Unpredictability and volatility in foreign aid undermines the ability of
donor officials to lobby for changes in recipient
countries.]{.underline} In a new book, "[The Development Dance: How
Donors and Recipients Negotiate the Delivery of Foreign
Aid](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1501709402?ie=UTF8)," I argue
that aid is about bargaining and diplomacy. Contrary to popular
conception, aid is not a unilateral gift. Foreign aid requires, in
President Trump's words, the "art of the deal." [But diplomacy is not
like the real estate business. To get the best deal, you need to be
**predictable**. For this study, I interviewed more than 150 donor and
recipient-government officials working in four countries: Ghana, Uganda,
Tanzania and Rwanda. I also carried out a
[survey](http://haleyswedlund.com/survey-of-donor-officials/) of
high-ranking donor officials working in 20 countries across sub-Saharan
Africa.]{.underline} What development practitioners told me is that
[donors get leverage with recipient governments by being able to make
promises to deliver aid. The more credible donor promises are perceived
to be, the more leverage donors get.]{.underline} [Recipient governments
do not just **passively receive aid** but rather actively attempt to
manage their foreign aid donors. They pay attention to how predictable
and consistent donors are with their aid dollars]{.underline},
[preferring to work with donor agencies that keep their word and deliver
what they promised.]{.underline} In all four countries, there are aid
units within the ministry of finance whose sole job is to dialogue with
donors, manage aid funds and represent the government's interests with
donors. In Rwanda, this government unit produces [annual
reports](http://www.devpartners.gov.rw/fileadmin/templates/documents/DPAF_FY2013-2014.pdf)
on the performance of individual donors --- an attempt to shame agencies
into upholding their commitments. [Aid recipients and donor agencies
actively negotiate aid contracts Politicians in donor countries
determine how much foreign aid a particular country gets.]{.underline}
But donor agencies like USAID are [responsible for delivering that
aid](https://www.amazon.com/Institutional-Economics-Foreign-Aid/dp/0521055393/ref=mt_paperback?_encoding=UTF8&me=).
In exchange for aid dollars, donor officials ask recipients to make
changes like implementing anti-corruption programs, establishing an
independent electoral commission or overhauling the country's primary
education system. This requires donor officials to
[negotiate](https://global.oup.com/academic/product/the-politics-of-aid-9780199560172?cc=nl&lang=en&)
with recipient governments over how and under what conditions aid will
be delivered. In Ghana, for example, the United States promised up to
[\$498.2
million](https://www.mcc.gov/where-we-work/program/ghana-power-compact)
to support the country's power sector over a five-year period. In
return, the government of Ghana committed to invest at least \$37.4
million of its own money. The government also promised to implement a
series of changes seen as necessary to improve the country's power
sector and encourage private sector investment. Aid dollars stimulated
these promises. [My research tells us that **credible promises** give
donor officials a stronger bargaining position with recipient
governments.]{.underline} If a donor agency is not able to keep its side
of the bargain, why should the recipient? U.S. credibility is at stake
That's why [drastic cuts in aid will hurt the U.S.'s ability to keep its
promises to countries like Ghana.]{.underline} Retracting aid promises
will discourage recipients from upholding their side of the bargain. It
will also undermine the U.S.'s credibility in future negotiations.
African governments like Ghana increasingly have access to financing
from "nontraditional" donors like China. Just last month, Ghana signed a
[\$10
billion](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-ghana-china-mou-idUSKBN19J25V)
memorandum of understanding with the Chinese to develop the country's
bauxite industry. Chinese financial assistance [should not yet be seen
as a replacement to traditional
aid](https://theconversation.com/is-china-displacing-traditional-aid-donors-in-africa-the-evidence-suggests-not-73452).
Chinese aid is concentrated in the productive sectors (infrastructure,
agriculture and mining) and mainly goes to Chinese companies. In
contrast, traditional aid is more likely to go directly to recipient
governments and supports social sectors like health and education. My
conversations with government officials, however, suggest that some
African governments see [Chinese aid as more
credible](https://academic.oup.com/ia/article-abstract/93/2/389/2981808/Is-China-eroding-the-bargaining-power-of?redirectedFrom=fulltext)
than assistance from traditional Western donors. This puts even more
pressure on traditional donors to offer credible promises of aid to
recipient governments. [My research tells us that **uncertainty** in
foreign aid **negotiations undermines** the ability]{.underline} of
USAID [to lobby for things including]{.underline} democratic overhauls,
increased [**transparency**]{.underline} and economic policy [that are
in the U.S. national interest. This should matter to a president
interested in making deals that benefit the American
people]{.underline}. To get the best possible deal for our aid dollars,
the assistance needs to be given in a predictable way.

#### The perm severs \-\-- that's a voting issue.

#### 1\-\--Reduce \-\-- the counterplan doesn't reduce, it a reform that includes a punishment that could not be imposed. That's a 'change of terms' not a reduction.

**Supreme Court of Missouri 73** -- (State ex rel. Cason v. Bond, 495
S.W.2d 385, Lexis)//BB

\"\* \* \* The fact that this section relates solely to appropriation
bills, in conjunction [[with the word \'reduce,\']{.underline}]{.mark}
indicates clearly that the expression \'items or parts of items\' refers
to separable fiscal units. They are appropriations of sums of money.
[[Power is conferred]{.underline}]{.mark} upon the Governor [[to reduce
a sum]{.underline}]{.mark} of money appropriated, [[or to
disapprove]{.underline}]{.mark} the appropriation
[[entirely]{.underline}]{.mark}. [[No power is conferred to **change the
terms of an appropriation except by reducing the
amount**]{.underline}]{.mark} thereof. Words or phrases are not \'items
or parts of items.\' [[This]{.mark} [principle applies to the
condition]{.mark}]{.underline} \[\*\*14\] attached to the appropriation
now [[in question]{.underline}]{.mark}. That condition is not an item or
a part of an item. The veto power conferred upon the Governor was
designed to enable him to recommend the striking out or reduction of any
item or part of an item. In the present instance His Excellency the
Governor did not undertake to veto the appropriation of \$100,000 made
by item 101, or any part of it, nor to reduce that amount or any part of
it apportioned to a specific purpose. He sought, rather, as shown by his
message, to enlarge the appropriation made by the General Court by
throwing the \$100,000 into a common fund to be used for any one of
several different purposes. We are of opinion that the power conferred
upon him by said article 63 does not extend to the removal of
restrictions imposed upon the use of the items appropriated.\"

#### 2\-\--Should \-\-- it requires a mandatory reduction

**Nieto 9** -- Judge Henry Nieto, Colorado Court of Appeals, 8-20-2009
People v. Munoz, 240 P.3d 311 (Colo. Ct. App. 2009)

[\"Should\" is \"used . . . to express duty, obligation]{.underline},
propriety, or expediency.\" Webster\'s Third New International
Dictionary 2104 (2002). Courts \[\*\*15\] interpreting the word in
various contexts have drawn conflicting conclusions, although [the
**weight of authority** appears to favor interpreting \"should\" in an
**imperative, obligatory sense**]{.underline}. HN7A number of courts,
confronted with the question of whether using the word \"should\" in
jury instructions conforms with the Fifth and Sixth Amendment
protections governing the reasonable doubt standard, have upheld
instructions using the word. [In the courts of other states]{.underline}
in which a defendant has argued that the word \"should\" in the
reasonable doubt instruction does not sufficiently inform the jury that
it is bound to find the defendant not guilty if insufficient proof is
submitted at trial, the courts have squarely rejected the argument. They
reasoned that [the word \"conveys a sense of duty and obligation and
**could not be misunderstood**]{.underline} by a jury.\" See State v.
McCloud, 257 Kan. 1, 891 P.2d 324, 335 (Kan. 1995); see also Tyson v.
State, 217 Ga. App. 428, 457 S.E.2d 690, 691-92 (Ga. Ct. App. 1995)
(finding argument that \"should\" is directional but not instructional
to be without merit); Commonwealth v. Hammond, 350 Pa. Super. 477, 504
A.2d 940, 941-42 (Pa. Super. Ct. 1986). Notably, [courts interpreting
the word \"should]{.underline}\" in other types of jury instructions
\[\*\*16\] [have]{.underline} also [found that the word
conveys]{.underline} to the jury [a sense of duty or obligation and
**not discretion**]{.underline}. In Little v. State, 261 Ark. 859, 554
S.W.2d 312, 324 (Ark. 1977), [the Arkansas Supreme Court interpreted the
word \"should\"]{.underline} in an instruction on circumstantial
evidence [as **synonymous with the word \"must\"**]{.underline} and
rejected the defendant\'s argument that the jury may have been misled by
the court\'s use of the word in the instruction. Similarly, [the
Missouri Supreme Court rejected a defendant\'s argument that the court
erred by not using the word \"should\" in an instruction]{.underline} on
witness credibility [which used the word \"must\" because the two words
have the **same meaning**]{.underline}. State v. Rack, 318 S.W.2d 211,
215 (Mo. 1958). \[\*318\] In applying a child support statute, [the
Arizona Court]{.underline} of Appeals [concluded that a legislature\'s
or commission\'s use of the word \"should\" is meant to convey **duty**
or **obligation**]{.underline}. McNutt v. McNutt, 203 Ariz. 28, 49 P.3d
300, 306 (Ariz. Ct. App. 2002) (finding a statute stating that child
support expenditures \"should\" be allocated for the purpose of
parents\' federal tax exemption to be mandatory).

#### If anything, it's a [future]{.underline} reduction, which also violates 'should'

**Summers 94** (Justice -- Oklahoma Supreme Court, "Kelsey v.

¶4 [The legal question to be resolved by the court is whether the word

The answer to this query is not to be divined from rules of
grammar;[15](http://www.oscn.net/applications/oscn/DeliverDocument.asp?CiteID=20287#marker3fn15)
it must be governed by the age-old practice culture of legal
professionals and its immemorial language usage. To determine if the
omission (from the critical May 18 entry) of the turgid phrase, \"and
the same hereby is\", (1) makes it an in futuro ruling - i.e., an
expression of what the judge will or would do at a later stage - or (2)
constitutes an in in praesenti resolution of a disputed law issue, the

For the purposes of this analysis, it appears instructive to consider
this particular case of non-compliance with end-use documentation as an
"unenvisaged" case of diversion. Such case needs to be distinguished
from diversion operations that are designed with the purpose to mislead
licensing authorities, and that enable authorised arms exports to be
transferred to unauthorised -- often illicit - end-use and end-uses.
[However large the difficulty the U.S. State Department's Blue Lantern
would face to predict changes in the importer's military policy, the
programme is proving rather effective in detecting, and preventing,
attempts to mislead the U.S. arms export control authority]{.underline}.
**[Year after year it reports "unfavourable" findings of Blue Lantern
checks that lead the requested licences to be denied, revoked or even
passed on to criminal investigation]{.underline}**. In the course of the
years examined in Table 3, the "unfavourable rate" was also seen to
diminish. Diligent scrutiny of end-use documentation is a key line of
defence against the latter, more deceptive type of diversion scheme,
where "such documents are effective only in the context of a broader
system that includes a thorough consideration of diversion risks at the
licensing stage, the verification of end-user documentation, and
complementary post-shipment controls".38 [In the Blue Lantern programme,
information gleaned from each of these controls and verifications is
additionally ensured to feed into a monitoring cycle, which revolves
around an agile and well-maintained information system]{.underline}. The
importance of that information cycle in effectively detecting and
preventing diversion is something that export licensing authorities
elsewhere might care to bear in mind.

### Problems

If the US sets an unreasonably high standard, then why would any county
ever assume they could meet it? They would think of the CP as just the
same as the plan and not choose to internally reform.

If diversion is an inevitable component of every single sale ever, then
that takes out the net-benefit because arms diversion is inevitable in
every sale after the CP too.

The thesis of the net-benefit is that someone needs to be entrapped and
imprisoned in a 'high profile' law enforcement case in order to justify
doing the plan. That's a problem.

If this CP is legitimate, then so is the CP that says 'do the plan if
the sun rises on the Monday after USMCA passes' -- it's just a delay CP
in disguise.

This CP always reduces, it makes that clear in the 1nc. So don't buy any
of the definitions on competition in the block.

Aff answers from the CP above apply (grey market, high now) \-\-- but,
go for perm/theory.

### Perms

Perm \-\-- do the plan with the justification of diverted weapons.
They've already diverted (based on the neg's arg), so there's no future
diversion key arg.

Perm \-\-- do the plan and apply heightened EUM to other arms sales.

the term *shall* in connection with only two of these eight earmarks;
the others say that USAID *should* make the prescribed amount available.

abandon any claim to sovereignty. You would be surprised at the
complexity of the directions. Because the main function of should in
modern American English is to express duty, necessity, etc. ( You should
get your flu shot before winter comes ), its use for other purposes, as
to form a subjunctive, can produce ambiguity, at least initially: I
should get my flu shot if I were you. Furthermore, should seems an
affectation to many Americans when used in certain constructions quite
common in British English: Had I been informed, I should (American would
) have called immediately. I should (American would ) really prefer a
different arrangement. As with shall and will, most educated native
speakers of American English do not follow the textbook rule in making a

Not all governments require end users to certify that weapons will only
be re-exported with the permission of the initial exporting authority.
In many cases, once weapons are in a particular state, it is up to that
state's government to decide upon re-exports. Again, the
[U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates [has the strictest
rules]{.underline} here, always insists on licensing re-exports even for
the export of components of weapon systems.[**19 This policy has brought
the United States in collision with other governments and the European
Union**,]{.underline} [which objects to US control over
components]{.underline} [that are used in the assembly of weapons in
Europe.]{.underline} This is part of a larger, controversial debate
about the appropriateness of extraterritoriality provisions.20 There
have been many cases of falsified end-user certificates. Arms dealers
and brokers have supplied licensing authorities with documents bearing
signatures of non-authorized persons and stating destinations that they
know to be incorrect. At least in the past, there existed a black market
for end-user certificates.21 **[State officials were willing to sign
false end-user certificates against the payment of certain
sums.]{.underline}** A number of such false end-user certificates have
been documented by experts monitoring arms embargoes. It is likely that
most falsifications of end-user certificates go by unnoticed, since the
widespread lack of end-user checks ---except in the case of the United
States---makes the detection of false end-use declarations largely
dependent on chance. For example, authorities may perhaps obtain reports
by NGOs, monitoring groups or journalists. End-user checks are difficult
but not impossible to carry out, as the US example shows. They require a
good legal basis, and staff with sufficient knowledge to inspect end
use. **[Many states are unwilling to follow the United States' lead to
base end-use inspection in domestic law]{.underline}**. An alternative
would be to require exporters to make the right of on-site inspection by
representatives from the exporting state a part of the arms transfer
contract. This also requires that governments reserve the right to
licence re-exports of arms

A recent case where those limits are exceeded concerns deployment of
U.S. supplied goods by Saudi Arabia's armed forces. [U.S. arms
export]{.underline} [control authorities must have had reasonable
assurance as to the Saudi client's capacity]{.underline} and willingness
to comply with the end-use documentation of solely legitimate defensive
use of the goods. **[If the Watch List led any red flags to be raised
when the deal to supply such goods was in the making, and even if such
flags would have led to visits in site, the final decision was to
approve the arms transfer]{.underline}**. [However as of mid-2015, some
such equipment has been used for offensive goals in
operations]{.underline}, as a Saudi-led coalition began deploying
against Houthi strongholds in Yemen[. The deployments were found to be
in violation of international humanitarian law]{.underline}. By 2016,
the international Cluster Munitions Coalition (CMC) reliably documented
Saudi deployment of CBU-105 Sensor Fuzed Weapons (weapons that disperse
canisters that release sub-munitions) in densely populated areas.37 CMC
also revealed that "in recent years", a Massachusetts-based company had
obtained the licence from the U.S. government to supply these weapons to
Saudi Arabia (and other recipient states that dispose of airborne means
to deliver such weapons) under the strict condition not to use these
weapons in civilian areas. [Non-compliance with these end-use conditions
was established by CMC, not by Blue Lantern envoys]{.underline}. The
U.S. export control agencies are nevertheless presumed eager to sanction
non-compliant end-users, in line with their mission, as well as within
the legal framework that mandates their activities. [No information is
available that the U.S. export control system]{.underline} (be that the
Blue Lantern, or "Golden Sentry" programme that concerns Foreign
Military Sales of defence articles and services via
government-to-government channels[) is currently taking action to recall
licences for further supplies to the Saudi armed forces, nor to recover
the equipment that was transferred in the]{.underline} [past, nor even
to prevent further unauthorised deployments of the
equipment.]{.underline} Proof of this unintended use would be expected
to feed into the Blue Lantern monitoring cycle, and as such provide the
U.S. export licensing authority with means to sanction this particular
violation of end-use conditions. These sanctions could become part of a
broader and longer-term endeavour to limit the use of any transferred
equipment to the specific importer and exporter agreed on at the time of
licensing[. Proven non-compliance with end-use documentation in one case
is sure to be noted and recorded in the Blue Lantern monitoring cycle.
Such records generate "flags" on its Watch List]{.underline}, [and can
impact decisions to authorise new export licences that identify the
once-non-compliant party as the end-user]{.underline}. In this
particular case, it is of note that Saudi armed forces hold a wide range
of U.S.- supplied goods. This context makes the Saudi armed forces
dependent on maintenance services and spare parts that the relevant U.S.
suppliers can continue to supply only if the U.S. export control
authority approves licence requests to that end. This gives the U.S.
arms export licensing system leverage to deny future licence
requests[**.** However, it would not seem certain that the leverage is
effectively used. **Geopolitical**]{.underline} **[considerations and
foreign policy choices may demand that the U.S. licensing authority
refrains from refusing further licence applications.]{.underline}**
[Unintended end-use of the cluster munition]{.underline}, as last
documented in February 2016, **[would appear likely to be downplayed by
the fact that these same Saudi forces are a major ally in the U.S.-led
airstrikes on Syria]{.underline}**. The discussed case can serve here as
a reminder that the situation in a recipient state may change. In Saudi
Arabia, the context of possession and use of the goods evolved
significantly over the past few years. In 2016 it no longer resembles
the context that U.S. (and many other Western) arms transfer control
authorities appraised in prior years, when they approved major export
licences to Saudi Arabia. These same export control authorities may not
come to the same decision about authorising transfer of the same goods
and same end-user, if the latter were subject of a new export licence
request. Transfer licences that were given at one time may be revoked,
to prevent more transfers taking place under the same licence. But
actual transfers authorised in the past when circumstances were
different are difficult to undo. In all likelihood, the recipient at
that time had intentions to use the goods in another way than a
"defensive mode" recorded in the end-use documentation that the
exporting country's authorities had judged bona fide. The type of
diversion in the documented case is one that takes transferred military
goods "away from intended end-use" at an appreciable time after
transfer. The diversion scheme, if there was one, could not possibly be
anticipated nor detected at the time the decision was made to authorise
that transfer.
