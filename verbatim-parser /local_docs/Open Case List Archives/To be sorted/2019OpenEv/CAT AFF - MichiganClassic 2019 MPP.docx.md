In April 2018, President Trump issued a national security presidential
memorandum replacing a January 2014 presidential policy directive which
specified the goals and requirements of the arms sales process. You can

This policy change is frequently called the "Conventional Arms Transfer
Policy."

This brief from the Arms Control Association provides a succinct
overview regarding how these changes will influence arms sales:

### Instability Advantage

#### Trump's conventional arms transfer policy will greatly expand the pace of arms exports while gutting oversight -- ensures weapons flow to dangerous actors and HR violators

Brian **Chang**, 12/20/**17**, Just Security, "By weakening arms export
controls, trump's national security strategy will create national and
global insecurity,"
https://www.justsecurity.org/49873/weakening-arms-export-controls-trumps-national-security-strategy-create-national-global-insecurity/,

The Trump Administration's newly launched National Security Strategy
will draw a lot of critiques of Trump's foreign policy worldview and
prescriptions, but not of its implications for arms control or human
rights. One important aspect of the 67-page strategy document that is
unlikely to get the sustained attention it deserves is how
[the]{.underline} Trump [administration's proposals to]{.underline}
[weaken arms export controls will lead to national and international
insecurity, and contribute to violations of human rights and
international humanitarian law]{.underline}. The Trump administration's
policy of increasing arms exports and its attempts to rewrite US arms
export regulations and processes, are a scandal that has not received
the attention it deserves in the present news cycle. [Trump's National
Security Strategy could result in the transfer of arms to autocratic
regimes that use them to violate human rights]{.underline}, [or the
diversion of arms to actors that might use them against US security
forces, or those of US allies]{.underline}. Individual sales proposals
and policy reform proposals over the past year have been troubling
enough, but the National Security Strategy confirms that these were not
exceptions, but part of a broader policy of encouraging the export of US
military equipment to strengthen the US defense industrial base, which
does not give adequate consideration to potential impacts on human
rights or national and international security. In the first 11 months of
2017, the Trump administration notified Congress of arms transfers
valued at \$80.7 billion, which is almost double the amount the Obama
administration sold in the same period in 2016 (\$58.6b). This included
approvals of arms transfers that the Obama administration had previously
blocked on human rights grounds after much effort by advocacy groups
such as Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch. Military aircraft
and bombs have been sold to air forces that face credible allegations of
unnecessarily bombing civilians, including Saudi Arabia, Bahrain and
Nigeria. The [Trump]{.underline} administration [has]{.underline} also
[proposed to or has already sold]{.underline} [guns to countries with
problematic human rights records including Mexico, Honduras, El
Salvador, Turkey, the UAE, Bahrain, Saudi Arabia and the
Philippines]{.underline}. Very few of these irresponsible arms deals
have received widespread public attention or pushback. Given the Trump
administration's stated National Security Strategy of encouraging arms
exports and weakening export controls, [these sales are likely to be
the]{.underline} mere [first rumblings of **an avalanche of arms sales
to rogue actors and human rights violators**.]{.underline} Too little
attention has been focused on the Trump administration's review of US
arms export controls, which is primarily focused on promoting the
competitiveness of the US defense industry by "removing unreasonable
constraints on the ability of \[US\] companies to compete," according to
National Security Council (NSC) sources. Another justification for the
review is to "strengthen the defense capabilities of US allies" which is
driven by the desire to create "high-quality American jobs," although
arms control advocates have shown that investments in defense creates
less jobs than investments in health care, clean energy, education or
even tax cuts. Although the NSC pays lip service to the importance of
ensuring that arms export controls are not removed at the expense of US
foreign policy interests, the review is clearly supported by lobbyists
for the defense industry and gun manufacturers. Trump has also
personally linked arms sales with trade imbalances, most recently
signaling to Vietnam that he wants them to buy more US arms to reduce
the US.-Vietnam trade deficit. The Trump administration's review of US
arms export controls includes proposals to weaken specific export
controls over a diverse array of weaponry ranging from small arms to
drones. In short, the Trump administration intends to change export
regulations so that gun manufacturers can export without adequate
background checks on the countries or security forces purchasing them,
even as we mourn the victims of gun violence linked to the inadequacy of
background checks here in the US. It has been reported that the
[Trump]{.underline} administration [intends]{.underline} [to shift some
gun and small arms sales from the US Munitions List to the Commerce
Control List]{.underline} soon, with reports indicating that [the
administration is close to finalizing proposed new rules]{.underline}.
Although advocacy and reporting on this proposal have been hindered by a
lack of transparency, this has not stopped a small group of dedicated
arms control advocates from highlighting that [the]{.underline}
anticipated [changes are likely to remove Congressional notification
requirements for arms sales, remove State Department oversight that
ensures these exports take into account national security, foreign
policy and human rights considerations, and ultimately make it much
easier for small arms manufacturers to obtain licenses to sell abroad,
with less accountability if the guns end up in the wrong
hands]{.underline}. Of arguably greater concern than the rollbacks of
individual export controls described above, the [Trump]{.underline}
administration [has signaled its intent to revise]{.underline} the
International Traffic in Arms Regulations ([ITAR]{.underline}), the
principal, overarching regulation governing arms exports. While public
details remain scarce, pro-arms export officials from the NSC and State
Department are emphasizing "export competitiveness" as the principal
motive behind the review, a motive confirmed by the National Security
Strategy. [Arms control advocates are particularly concerned that the
result of this rewrite could be that vetting criteria mandating
consideration of human rights concerns will be eliminated and replaced
with vetting criteria emphasizing the desirability of arms
exports]{.underline}. [The consequences of poorly regulated arms flows
are devastating]{.underline}, [with tens of thousands of people dying
each year]{.underline} due to the widespread availability of weapons on
black markets. In Iraq alone, poorly regulated US arms transfers ended
up providing ISIS with the weapons to commit mass atrocities in Iraq and
Syria, while also supplying paramilitary militias with the weapons to
abduct, "disappear," torture and execute thousands of mainly Sunni men
and boys. US-made weapons are also being used to enforce the Saudi-led
siege of Yemen, where thousands of civilians are being needlessly
starved and bombed, in flagrant disregard of international and US arms
export control law. The Trump administration should be fighting to end
the bloodshed in Yemen and US complicity in human rights violations by
threatening to end arms sales to members of the Saudi-led coalition,
rather than threatening to weaken human rights provisions in the
oversight of arms exports.

#### This policy shift will trigger arms races and interstate conflicts 

John **Haltiwanger**, 9/30/**17**, Newsweek, "trump will fuel war across
world by increasing US global arms sales,"
https://www.newsweek.com/trump-will-fuel-war-across-world-increasing-us-global-arms-sales-674586,
mm

President Donald [Trump is]{.underline} reportedly [planning to roll
back restrictions on]{.underline} U.S. arms sales abroad, [despite the
fact he\'s already selling record numbers of weapons to other
countries.]{.underline} Trump is planning to make these changes via an
executive order or memorandum at some point this fall, Politico reports.
In doing so, [experts worry the]{.underline} Trump [administration will
both intensify existing conflicts and spark new ones across the
globe]{.underline}. \"[The transfer of arms and the process of arms
racing has been a long-standing reason that conflicts begin, spread, and
escalate]{.underline},\" Dr. Brandon Valeriano, Donald Bren Chair of
Armed Politics at Marine Corps University, tells Newsweek. \"New weapons
give states the confidence they might not otherwise have to launch or
exacerbate ongoing antagonisms and hatreds. This new expansion of our
effort to promote the transfer of arms will have devastating effects on
the international community and will be the root of the evil that will
spread throughout the system,\" Valeriano adds. But the Trump
administration is seemingly more concerned with the economic benefits of
increasing arms sales than the overall impact it might have on the wider
world. [\"The presence of weapons almost always exacerbates conflict,
particularly in places of existing conflict or rising
tension]{.underline}\... The Trump administration is sending a clear
signal that profit, not people, is what matters most to this
government,\" says Allison Pytlak, a program manager in the disarmament
program of the Women\'s International League for Peace and Freedom.
\"The implications will be felt by the people living in countries and
cities that are already drowning in weapons.\" The National Security
Council confirmed to Politico Trump has \"undertaken a review of our
policy on arms sales and wherever possible is working to remove
unreasonable constraints on the ability of our companies to compete.\"
Generally, the president wants to make it easier for American arms
manufacturers to sell to international buyers and is also looking at
revamping export regulations on drone technology. On the latter point,
some experts say Trump might be onto something. \"An increased
willingness by the United States to export drones to responsible
countries can help advance US security goals of building the capacity of
allies and partners, and in a way that enhances interoperability with
the United States military,\" says Dr. Michael C. Horowitz, professor of
political science at the University of Pennsylvania. \"U.S. exports also
make it more likely that countries will use their drones in a way that
complies with the law of war, due to the training and support that goes
along with U.S. drone exports.\" Thus, there is arguably at least some
merit in increasing drone exports. From a broader standpoint, however,
reducing restrictions on arms exports overseas is a slippery slope. The
U.S. has long been the world\'s number one exporter of arms and Trump
has built on this precedent in a massive way since entering the White
House. The Obama administration was hardly reserved when it came to
international arms deals, but Trump is poised to outsell his predecessor
on a historic scale, according to recent data on weapons sales. In the
first eight months of 2017, Trump almost doubled the total value of U.S.
arms sales (to \$48 billion) than under Obama during the same period in
2016. Moreover, Trump could be complicit in war crimes due to some of
the arms sales he\'s already made. In Yemen, for example, it was
recently discovered a U.S.-made bomb was used by the Saudi-led coalition
in a strike last month that killed civilians, including children. It\'s
possible this bomb was sold via deals made under Obama, but the larger
point is Trump\'s apparent determination to sell more and more arms
arguably increases the probability he\'ll be linked to atrocities
committed by other countries. \"In the context of horrific human rights
abuses in the Middle East region, we\'re very concerned about the
possibility of easing restrictions on U.S. weapons sales overseas,\"
Raed Jarrar, Amnesty International\'s advocacy director for the Middle
East and North Africa, tells Newsweek. \"There is damning evidence that
many recipients of U.S. weapons in the Middle East \-- such as Saudi
Arabia, Egypt and Israel \-- are already involved in serious violations
of human rights and international law. [A decision to reduce
restrictions on global arms sales by the U.S. will be \"perceived by
foreign governments as a green light to continue, if not increase, their
disregard to human rights]{.underline},\" Jarrar adds. This is precisely
why there are restrictions on arms sales in the first place \-- to avoid
inflaming conflicts, limit the potential for human rights violations and
keep weapons out of the hands of dictators. \"Arms should only be given
to those states that are responsible, careful, and judicious in their
use of weapons. Are we convinced that we can trust those that will
receive these weapons to be as precise and careful?\" says Valeriano. In
the past, arms the U.S. has sold to foreign governments have also ended
up in the hands of terrorists \-- including ISIS \-- because America
didn\'t have stricter regulations and safeguards in place. In this
sense, rolling back restrictions is arguably very dangerous. Trump\'s
plan to ease restrictions could certainly create more jobs domestically,
but is it worth the chaos it could potentially induce abroad? The
concerns surrounding this move are compounded by the fact the Trump
administration is also dropping record numbers of bombs on targets in
the Middle East, which has led to a marked increase in civilian
casualties compared to during Obama\'s tenure.

#### We control multiple internal links to global instability -- blowback, entanglement and regional conflicts 

A. Trevor **Thrall and** Caroline **Dorminey**, 3/13/**18**, \[Thrall is
an associate professor at the Schar School of Policy and Government at
George Mason; Dorminey is a policy analyst at the Cato Institute-, Cato
Institute, "risky business: the role of arms sales in US foreign
policy,"
https://www.cato.org/publications/policy-analysis/risky-business-role-arms-sales-us-foreign-policy,
mm

Though arms sales are of marginal value to national security and the
pursuit of national interests, their negative consequences are varied
and often severe. [Arms sales can spawn unwanted outcomes on three
levels: blowback]{.underline} against the United States [and
entanglement]{.underline} in conflicts; [regional
consequences]{.underline} in the buyer's neighborhood, such as the
dispersion of weapons and increased instability; [and consequences for
the buyer itself]{.underline}, such as increased levels of corruption,
human rights abuses, and civil conflict. Effects on the United States.
Though the goal of arms sales is to promote American security and U.S.
interests abroad, at least two possible outcomes can cause serious
consequences for the United States. The first of these --- blowback ---
occurs when a former ally turns into an adversary and uses the weapons
against the United States. The second --- entanglement --- is a process
whereby an arms sales relationship draws the United States into a
greater level of unwanted intervention. Blowback. [The fact that the
United States has sold weapons to almost every nation on earth, combined
with frequent military intervention, means that blowback is an
inescapable outcome of U.S. arms sales policy.]{.underline} [American
troops and their allies have faced American-made weapons in almost every
military engagement since the end of the Cold War]{.underline},
including in Panama, Haiti, Somalia, Iraq, Afghanistan, Yemen, and
Syria. [And even where the United States has not yet engaged in combat,
American arms sales have bolstered the military capabilities of
adversaries once counted as friendly]{.underline}. [Blowback can occur
in at least three ways. First, a previously friendly regime becomes
unfriendly]{.underline}. For example, the United States sold billions of
dollars in weapons to the Shah of Iran during the 1970s in the hopes
that Iran would provide a stabilizing influence on the Middle East. The
sales included everything from fighter jets for air campaigns to
surface-to-air missiles to shoot down enemy fighters.70 After the 1979
revolution, however, Iran used those weapons in its war with Iraq and
enabled the new Iranian regime to exert its influence in the region.
Panama, the recipient of decades of American military assistance, as
well as host to a major military base and 9,000 U.S. troops, was a
similar case. In 1989, Gen. Manuel Noriega --- himself a CIA asset for
more than 20 years --- took power and threatened U.S. citizens,
prompting a U.S. invasion that featured American troops facing American
weapons.71 [Blowback also occurs when the United States sells weapons to
nations]{.underline} (or transfers them to nonstate actors)
[that]{.underline}, though not allies, [simply did not register as
potential adversaries at the time of the sale]{.underline}. The United
States, for example, sold surface-to-air missiles, towed guns, tanks,
and armored personnel carriers to Somalia during the 1980s. Few
officials would have imagined that the United States would find itself
intervening in Somalia in 1992, or that the United States and its allies
would provide billions in weapons and dual-use equipment to Iraq in an
effort to balance against Iran, only to wind up confronting Iraq on the
battlefield to reverse its annexation of Kuwait.72 [And finally,
blowback can occur when U.S. weapons are sold or stolen from the
government that bought them and wind up on the battlefield in the hands
of the adversary.]{.underline} For example, the Reagan administration
covertly provided Stinger missiles to the Mujahideen, who were fighting
the Soviets in Afghanistan during the 1980s; they in turn sold them off
eventually to Iran and North Korea, among others. More recently, the
Islamic State managed to capture from the Iraqi government a stunning
number of Humvees and tanks the United States had sold to Iraq to
rebuild its military capabilities after the 2003 invasion, as well as
enough small arms and ammunition to supply three divisions of a
conventional army.73 [These examples]{.underline} of blowback
[demonstrate how difficult it can be to forecast the long-term outcomes
of arms sales and how obvious it is that selling weapons carries a
number of risks]{.underline}. Predicting what exactly will happen is
hard, but [predicting that arms sales to clients with red flags are
likely to end badly is quite easy]{.underline}. Iraq was a fragile state
ravaged by a decade's worth of American intervention and rife with
terrorism and civil conflict; to transfer such large quantities of
weapons to its military and police force under such conditions was to
invite disaster. Entanglement. [Arms sales raise the risk of
entanglement in two ways. First, they can represent early steps down the
slippery slope to unwise military intervention.]{.underline} Consider a
case like the Syrian civil war or the many cases during the Cold War in
which the United States wanted to support rebels and freedom fighters
against oppressive governments.74 In the majority of those cases,
American leaders were wary of intervening directly. Instead, the United
States tended to rely on money, training, and arms sales. [But by taking
concrete steps like arms sales to support rebel groups, Washington's
psychological investment in the outcome tends to rise]{.underline}, as
do the political stakes for the president, who will be judged on whether
his efforts at support are successful or not. As we saw in the Syrian
civil war, for example, Barack Obama's early efforts to arm Syrian
rebels were roundly criticized as feckless, increasing pressure on him
to intervene more seriously.75 History does not provide much guidance
about how serious the risk of this form of entanglement might be. During
the Cold War, presidents from Nixon onward viewed arms sales as a
substitute for sending American troops to do battle with communist
forces around the world. The result was an astonishing amount of
weaponry transferred or sold to Third World nations, many of which were
engaged in active conflicts both external and internal. The risk of
superpower conflict made it dangerous to intervene directly;
accordingly, the Cold War-era risk of entanglement from arms sales was
low.76 Today, however, the United States does not face nearly as many
constraints on its behavior, as its track record of near-constant
military intervention since the end of the Cold War indicates. As a
result, the risk of arms sales helping trigger future military
intervention is real, even if it cannot be measured precisely. [The
second way in which arms sales might entangle the United States is by
creating new disputes or exacerbating existing tensions.]{.underline}
U.S. arms sales to Kurdish units fighting in Syria against the Islamic
State, for example, have ignited tensions between the United States and
its NATO ally Turkey, which sees the Kurds as a serious threat to
Turkish sovereignty and stability.77 Meanwhile, ongoing arms sales to
NATO nations and to other allies like South Korea and Taiwan have
exacerbated tensions with Russia, China, and North Korea, raising the
risk of escalation and the possibility that the United States might wind
up involved in a direct conflict.78 Regional Effects. A[rms sales do not
just affect the recipient nation; they also affect the local balance of
power, often causing ripple effects throughout the region.]{.underline}
Though advocates of arms sales trumpet their stabilizing influence, as
we have noted above, [arms sales often lead to greater tension, less
stability, and more conflict.]{.underline} Because of this --- and the
complementary problem of weapons dispersion --- [the regional impact of
arms sales is less predictable and more problematic than advocates
acknowledge]{.underline}. Instability, Violence, and Conflict. First,
[arms sales can make conflict more likely]{.underline}.79 This may occur
[because recipients of new weapons feel more confident about launching
attacks or because changes in the local balance of power can fuel
tensions and promote preventive strikes by others]{.underline}. A [study
of arms sales from 1950 to 1995, for example, found that]{.underline}
although arms sales appeared to have some restraining effect on
major-power allies, they had the opposite effect in other cases, and
concluded that "in[creased arms transfers from major powers make states
significantly more likely to be militarized dispute
initiators.]{.underline}"80 Another study focused on sub-Saharan Africa
from 1967 to 1997 found that "arms transfers are significant and
positive predictors of increased probability of war."81 Recent history
provides supporting evidence for these findings: since 2011, Saudi
Arabia, the leading buyer of American weapons, has intervened to varying
degrees in Yemen, Tunisia, Syria, and Qatar. Second, [arms sales can
also prolong and intensify ongoing conflicts and erode rather than
promote regional stability]{.underline}. Few governments, and fewer
insurgencies, have large enough weapons stocks to fight for long without
resupply.82 [The tendency of external powers to arm the side they
support]{.underline}, however understandable strategically, [has the
inevitable result of allowing the conflict to continue at a higher level
of intensity than would otherwise be the case]{.underline}. As one study
of arms sales to Africa notes, "Weapons imports are essential additives
in this recipe for armed conflict and carnage."83 Third, [this dynamic
appears to be particularly troublesome with respect to internal
conflicts]{.underline}. Jennifer Erickson, for example, found that
recipients of major conventional weapons are 70 percent more likely to
engage in internal conflicts than other states. Though halting arms
sales alone is not a panacea for peace and stability, arms embargoes can
help lessen the destructiveness of combat in both civil and interstate
wars simply by restricting access to the means of violence.84 Finally,
[because of their effects on both interstate and internal conflict, arms
sales can also erode rather than promote regional
stability.]{.underline} As noted in the previous section, where the
United States seeks to manage regional balances of power, arms sales
often create tension, whether because the American role in the region
threatens others or because American clients feel emboldened. [The
Middle East, for example, has seesawed between violence and tense
standoffs for the past many decades]{.underline}, at first because of
Cold War competition and more recently because of the American war on
terror. The notion that increased U.S. arms sales since 9/11 made the
Middle East more stable is far-fetched to say the least. Similarly,
though many argue that American security commitments to countries like
Japan, Taiwan, and South Korea have produced greater stability, there is
a strong case to be made that the opposite is now true. American support
of South Korea has driven North Korea to develop nuclear weapons; the
presence of U.S. missile defense systems in South Korea has aggravated
China, and American support of Taiwan produces continual tension between
the two powers.85 Dispersion. The United States uses a number of
procedures to try to ensure that the weapons it sells actually go to
authorized customers and to monitor the end use of the weapons so that
they do not wind up being used for nefarious purposes. The Department of
State even compiles a list of banned countries, brokers, and customers.
But most of these tools have proved ineffectual.86 Programs like Blue
Lantern and Golden Sentry aim to shed light on the service life of
American weapons sold abroad through end-use monitoring.87 While the
description of U.S. end-use monitoring ("pre-license,
post-license/pre-shipment, and post-shipment") sounds comprehensive,
it's actually anything but. In fiscal year 2016, the agency in charge of
approving and monitoring arms sales, the Directorate of Defense Trade
Controls (DDTC), authorized 38,398 export-license applications --- down
more than 50 percent from 2012 after the government shifted some weapons
to the Department of Commerce's purview.88 To oversee more than 35,000
export licenses annually, the DDTC has a full-time staff of only 171
people. The Blue Lantern program is executed by embassy staff in
recipient countries but administered back in Washington by only nine
State Department employees and three contractors.89 Twelve people can't
possibly track everything that happens to billions of dollars' worth of
advanced weaponry transferred to dozens of countries abroad each year.
Nor is the process designed to correct problems. On one hand, end-use
violations can result in individuals and companies being prevented from
making future purchases. On the other hand, [there is no evidence that
end-use monitoring has changed the pattern of American arms sales in any
way]{.underline}. The United States in truth has little or no control
over what happens to the weapons it sells to other nations. The result
is that year after year weapons of all kinds end up falling into the
hands of unreliable, risky, or just plain bad actors, at which point
they're used in ways neither the United States nor its customers
intended. American weapons have frequently wound up being used against
Americans in combat. And even more often, local and regional actors,
including criminal gangs, have employed them in their own conflicts. In
civil wars, regime collapse, or other extreme cases, factions steal
weapons and use them for their own purposes, as ISIS did in Iraq.90
Iraq, as previously noted, provides an excellent case study in the
inability of the United States to prevent dispersion. As part of U.S.
efforts to rebuild Iraq's military and security capabilities after the
2003 invasion, the United States sent Iraq roughly \$2.5 billion worth
of American weapons through 2014, including everything from small arms
to "armored personnel carriers, military helicopters, transport
aircraft, anti-tank missiles, tanks, artillery and drones." 91 Despite
the presence of thousands of U.S. troops in-country and the very close
relationship between those troops and their Iraqi counterparts, many of
those weapons went missing. Between 2003 and 2008 alone, 360,000 out of
1 million small arms disappeared, along with 2,300 Humvees. A sizable
chunk of this weaponry would later end up in the hands of ISIS. The
Iraqi army, trained and equipped by the American military, dissolved
when faced by ISIS and left their weapons behind for the terrorist group
to pick up and use for conquering and holding territory. A UN Security
Council report found that in June 2014 alone "ISIS seized sufficient
Iraqi government stocks from the provinces of Anbar and Salah al-Din to
arm and equip more than three Iraqi conventional army divisions."92 Data
collected by Conflict Armament Research in July and August of 2014
showed that 20 percent of ISIS's ammunition was manufactured in the
United States --- likely seized from Iraqi military stocks.93 In short,
dispersion enabled the spread of ISIS and dramatically raised the costs
and dangers of confronting the group on the battlefield. Regime Effects.
[Finally, arms sales can also have deleterious effects on recipient
nations]{.underline} --- [promoting government oppression, instability,
and military coups.]{.underline} As part of the war on drugs, America
inadvertently enabled the practice of forced disappearances. In the
cases of Colombia, the Philippines, and Mexico, American weapons feed a
dangerous cycle of corruption and oppression involving the police, the
military, and political leaders.94 Though the United States provides
weapons to Mexico ostensibly for counternarcotics operations, the arms
transferred to the country often end up being used by police to oppress
citizens, reinforcing the "climate of generalized violence in the
country \[that\] carries with it grave consequences for the rule of
law."95 Similarly, in Colombia and the Philippines the United States has
supplied arms in an effort to support governments against external
threats or internal factions and to combat drug trafficking, but with
mixed results. A study of military aid to Colombia found that "in
environments such as Colombia, international military assistance can
strengthen armed nonstate actors, who rival the government over the use
of violence."96 [Recent research reveals that American assistance
programs]{.underline}, like foreign military officer training, [can
increase the likelihood of military coups]{.underline}. U.S. training
programs frequently bought by other nations, most notably International
Military Education and Training (IMET), gave formal training to the
leaders of the 2009 Honduran coup, the 2012 Mali coup, and the 2013
Egyptian coup.97 In these cases, the training that was supposed to
stabilize the country provided military leaders with the tools to
overthrow the government they were meant to support.

#### [Every sale matters]{.underline} -- only a dramatic reduction in exports can reduce the probability of instability and war

A. Trevor **Thrall** **and** Jordan **Cohen**, 4/5/19, Defense One, "the
false promises of trump's arms sales,"
https://www.defenseone.com/ideas/2019/04/false-promises-trumps-arms-sales/156071/,
mm

[U.S. export deals are undermining regional stability]{.underline} and
sending jobs abroad. President Trump's love of arms sales is clear for
all to see. On his first trip abroad as a public servant, the new
president proudly announced a mammoth arms deal with Saudi Arabia, later
crowing that the deal would lead to one million new American jobs. Last
July, [his administration released a new Conventional Arms Transfer
policy that aims to streamline and supercharge arms exports]{.underline}
through a whole-of-government strategy. The results so far, according to
figures from a new report from the Security Assistance Monitor, have
been \$82.2 billion in arms sales in 2017 and another \$78 billion in
2018. Unfortunately, Trump's promises about the benefits of arms sales
are mostly empty, while the dangers are all too real. [Advocates of arms
exports have long argued that such sales are critical for promoting
regional stability in trouble spots around the world. But American arms
exports to the Middle East are doing the exact opposite]{.underline}.
Arms export data from the Stockholm International Peace Research
Institute show that the U.S. share of arms sales to the Middle East has
steadily increased over the past 15 years, yet with conflicts in Syria,
Yemen, and throughout North Africa, the region is as unstable as ever.
American arms sales to Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates have
already enabled those nations to carry out a bloody and catastrophic war
in Yemen, which has killed thousands of civilians, displaced most of the
population, and put millions more at risk of starvation and disease. By
continuing to sell weapons to Saudi Arabia even after attempts in the
U.S. Senate to halt them, the Trump administration will encourage more
Saudi intervention, further destabilizing the region. [And though
presidents tout export of arms as a good way to strengthen allies, the
truth is that the United States doesn't just sell weapons to responsible
nations]{.underline} such as Italy, the United Kingdom, and Belgium[.
Vast amounts of U.S. weapons are shipped to risky customers: fragile
states]{.underline} like Turkey, [nations embroiled in
conflicts]{.underline} like Saudi Arabia, [and oppressive
governments]{.underline} with horrendous human rights records like
Egypt, Bahrain, and the United Arab Emirates. [Since 2001, the U.S.
government has notified the public of arms sales totaling over \$560
billion to 167 countries. **Each of these sales adds a varying degree of
risk to the United States regarding potential blowback, entanglement,
dispersion, and increasing instability throughout the
world**]{.underline}.

#### Arm sales substantially increase the probability of instability and war -- rigorous academic studies prove

Sales: Pouring Gas on the Fires of Conflict,"

[Do arms sales cause war?]{.underline} Or do wars cause arms sales?
Critics of arms sales often argue that selling weapons abroad fuels
conflict. And indeed, one can point to one or more sides using American
weapons in many recent conflicts including Syria, Yemen, and Iraq.
Skeptics argue, on the other hand, that weapons don't start the fire and
that conflicts would arise whether or arms exporters like the United
States sell weapons abroad. The debate has important implications for
foreign policy. If selling or transferring weapons abroad makes conflict
more likely, or intensifies conflicts already in process, then the
United States should rethink its long-held policy of selling weapons to
pretty much any nation that wants them. If, on the other hand, arms
sales have no impact on conflict or make conflict less likely, then the
Trump administration's intention of expanding arms sales should be seen
as a positive move. As it turns out, several [academic studies have
looked at this question. The primary conclusion]{.underline} of these
works [is that]{.underline} although [arms sales]{.underline} do not
create conflicts out of thin air, they do [make conflict more likely
when the conditions for conflict are already present]{.underline}. The
basic logic behind this conclusion is fairly straightforward and has
been noted in the academic literature for some time. In a 1998 article,
"Arms Transfer Dependence and Foreign Policy Conflict," David Kinsella
argues that [states that enjoy a steady flow of arms]{.underline} --
especially from multiple countries -- [tend to pursue more aggressive
foreign policies.]{.underline} The increase in the recipient's military
capability makes victory in a potential conflict more likely, which in
turn raises the likelihood that the state will start disputes, demand
concessions from its neighbors in those disputes, and to escalate to
conflict if negotiations fail to produce the desired outcome. Using case
studies from Israel, Egypt, Syria, Iran, Iraq, India, Pakistan,
Ethiopia, and Somalia Kinsella finds that, when a country has more than
one weapons supplier, arms sales drastically increase the chances of
conflict. In their 2002 article, "The Arms Trade and the Incidence of
Political Violence in Sub-Saharan Africa, 1967-97," Cassady Craft and
Joseph Smaldone identify another mechanism by which arms sales can fuel
conflict. They find that [autocratic governments importing weapons are
more likely to use those weapons to oppress]{.underline}/mistreat/kill
[their own citizens since they now have a greater coercive
capability]{.underline}. But despite the straightforward logic behind
the arms sales/conflict connection, most work on the topic to date has
relied on case studies, which are wonderful for highlighting potential
causal mechanisms but not much use for establishing whether those
mechanisms hold across the time and space. [Until recently there had not
been any work using statistical methods]{.underline} that would allow
scholars [to state with confidence which direction the causal mechanism
actually flows]{.underline} -- that is, do arms sales precede conflict
or do impending conflicts lead to increased arms sales? Happily, [the
most recent article on arms sales by]{.underline} Oliver
[Pamp]{.underline} [and his colleagues]{.underline} in the January 2018
issue of the Journal of Peace Research entitled, "The Build-Up of
Coercive Capacities: Arms Imports and the Outbreak of Violent Intrastate
Conflict," [uses a simultaneous equations model to overcome this
problem]{.underline}. Looking at the relationship between arms sales and
the outbreak of civil conflicts, [the authors confirm the general thrust
of previous research, concluding that:]{.underline} "...[while arms
imports are not a genuine cause of intrastate conflicts, they
significantly increase the probability of an onset in countries where
conditions are notoriously conducive to conflict]{.underline}. In such
situations, arms are not an effective deterrent but rather spark
conflict escalation." This new confidence in the arms sales/conflict
connection should compel serious revision to American arms sales
policies. Since 2002 the United States has sold over \$286 billion
dollars of weapons to 167 countries. These exports have gone to numerous
countries where the conditions were or remain ripe for conflict. U.S.
arms transfers to an unstable Iraq preceded the emergence of the Islamic
State, but wound up helping amplify the Islamic State's military
capability when it took vast quantities of American weapons from
defeated Iraqi army units. U.S. arms sales over the past decade also
helped prepare Saudi Arabia to launch its disastrous intervention in
Yemen and enabled the Nigerian government to unleash more effective
violence on its own citizens, just to list a few examples. Academic
research often gets a bad rap in policy making circles. In the case of
arms sales and arms transfers, however, the scholarly literature has
correctly pointed out the serious risks involved[. If the United States
is serious about preventing conflict and managing regional stability in
trouble spots around the globe, it would do well to stop pouring gas on
the fire]{.underline}.

#### We control magnitude -- arms sales are responsible for half of annual global killings 

Kevin **Clarke**, 3/21/**17**, American Magazine, "master of wars: US
arms sales lead a world of conflict,"
https://www.americamagazine.org/politics-society/2017/03/21/master-wars-us-arms-sales-lead-world-conflict,
mm

On March 8, the Trump administration reversed a decision made by its
predecessor to suspend guided munitions sales to Saudi Arabia. The Obama
administration had grown weary of gruesome headlines generated by what
critics described as indiscriminate use of U.S.-made weapons by Saudi
coalition forces in operations over Yemen. A mostly Arab coalition
pulled together by the Saudi kingdom has been supporting Yemeni
government forces against Iran-supported Houthi rebels in Yemen for
three years. The conflict, described as a "quagmire" by a former State
Department official, has led to more than 10,000 noncombatant
fatalities, according to the United Nations. Yemen now teeters on the
edge of famine as the ongoing conflict disrupts what was already a
barely functioning state. Critics wonder if the Trump administration's
reversal signals a more tolerant attitude in Washington toward the
possibility of collateral damage in the various conflicts that U.S.
weapons sales help sustain. Restored sales to the Saudis will represent
just a fraction of total U.S. arms transfers this year. [The United
States is]{.underline} well-known as the world's biggest spender on arms
and weapons systems. Catholic bishops have regularly denounced as a
moral scandal a defense budget measured each year in the hundreds of
billions; \$657 billion is the anticipated request for 2018, a 10
percent increase over 2017 spending. Less noticed is the nation's status
as [the world's top merchant of arms]{.underline} and the government's
role as facilitator in that market. With a 33 percent share---roughly
\$38 billion in 2016---the United States dominates an annual global
weapons export market that has topped \$100 billion. "[The USA supplies
major arms to at least 100 countries around the world---significantly
more than any other supplier state]{.underline}," Aude Fleurant,
director of the Arms and Military Expenditure Program at the Stockholm
International Peace Research Institute (Sipri) reported in a press
release in February. In a historic address in Washington on Sept. 24,
2015, Pope Francis told Congress: Being at the service of dialogue and
peace\...means being truly determined to minimize and, in the long term,
to end the many armed conflicts throughout our world.... Here we have to
ask ourselves: Why are deadly weapons being sold to those who plan to
inflict untold suffering on individuals and society? Sadly, the answer,
as we all know, is simply for money: money that is drenched in blood,
often innocent blood. In the face of this shameful and culpable silence,
it is our duty to confront the problem and to stop the arms trade. The
pope's address drew ovations in Washington. That year the United States
once again led the world in arms transfer agreements, signing deals for
about \$40 billion, according to a congressional study---half of all
sales that year in the global arms bazaar. In fact repeated moral
denunciation of arms transfers has done little to restrain the lucrative
trade. SIPRI reports that [global arms transfers]{.underline} last year
[reached a volume not seen since the end of the Cold War.]{.underline}
Russian provocations in Ukraine and the continuing threat posed by ISIS
have proved significant drivers of U.S. weapons sales. The ISIS boom, in
fact, has propelled Middle Eastern states to top spots among U.S. arms
customers, despite historically low prices for oil, which had been a
significant drag on arms sales. U.S. and European arms merchants have
been the primary source for weapons bound for the Middle East, a volume
of arms transfers that has almost doubled over the last five years,
Sipri researchers say. [While big weapons sales attract headlines, the
world's small arms trade supports about **half of all global killing
annually**]{.underline}, according to an analysis by the Geneva
Declaration on Armed Violence and Development. The United States is no
slouch in that department either, ranking as both the world's top
exporter and top importer of small arms, according to the Geneva-based
Small Arms Survey. At a conference on March 2 at the United Nations
reflecting on Pope Francis' message for the 50th World Day of Peace,
Marie Dennis, co-president of Pax Christi International, argued that the
arms trade is one powerful component of a geopolitical infrastructure
that helps drive conflict. The event was sponsored by the Holy See's
Permanent Observer Mission to the United Nations. Ms. Dennis said more
intellectual and financial investment is needed to develop effective
nonviolent approaches to peacekeeping and peacebuilding. "Repeatedly
since 1945 the U.N. has been confronted with an enormous challenge,
facing complex and dangerous situations with relatively underfunded or
underdeveloped nonviolent strategies," she said. "At the moment of
crisis---in Aleppo or Mosel, Rwanda or the Balkans, the Philippines,
Haiti or South Sudan---we have time and again opened a toolbox that is
flush with military might, but woefully underinvested in the tools of
active nonviolence." The two-year-old U.N. Arms Trade Treaty represents
a first, multilateral effort to restrain the global arms trade, perhaps
setting the stage to address that imbalance. But the major arms
exporters Russia and China have refused to sign on, and the United
States, though a signatory, has yet to ratify the treaty and is unlikely
to do so anytime soon. [Persisting global insecurity and the big profits
generated by the ongoing arms market surge suggest progress on arms
trade restraint will be hard-won in the near term]{.underline}.

#### Small Arms and Light Weapons magnify this impact -- they are 'slow motion weapons of mass destruction'

(William **Hartung**, 7-12-**2019**, \"American Weapons Cause Chaos All
Over the World,\" No Publication,
https://warisboring.com/american-guns-cause-chaos-all-over-the-world/)//VP

Yes, those massive sales of tanks, helicopters, and fighter aircraft are
indeed a grim wonder of the modern world and never receive the attention
they truly deserve. However[**, a** potentially **deadlier aspect of the
U.S. weapons trade** receives even less attention than the sale of
big-ticket items: **the export of firearms, ammunition and related
equipment**.]{.underline} Global arms control advocates have
[termed](http://thehill.com/opinion/national-security/389255-deregulating-firearms-exports-risks-putting-guns-in-the-wrong-hands)
such [**small arms and light weaponry --- rifles, automatic and
semi-automatic weapons, and handguns** --- **"slow motion weapons of
mass destruction"** **because they're the weapons of choice in the
majority of the [40 armed
conflicts](http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sciencetech/article-4453666/The-world-war-Interactive-map-reveals-conflicts.html)
now underway around the world. They and they alone have been responsible
for [nearly
half](http://www.smallarmssurvey.org/fileadmin/docs/H-Research_Notes/SAS-Research-Note-60.pdf)
of the roughly 200,000 violent deaths by weapon that have been occurring
annually both in and outside of official war zones.**]{.underline} And
the Trump administration is now moving to make it far easier for U.S.
gun makers to push such wares around the world. Consider it an irony, if
you will, but in doing so, the president who has staked his reputation
on rejecting everything that seems to him
[tainted](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/may/11/donald-trump-barack-obama-legacy)
by Pres. Barack Obama is elaborating on a
[proposa](https://www.propublica.org/article/in-big-win-for-defense-industry-obama-rolls-back-limits-on-arms-export)l
originally developed in the Obama years. The crucial element in the new
plan: to move key decisions on whether or not to export guns and
ammunition abroad from the State Department's jurisdiction, where they
would be vetted on both human rights and national security grounds, to
the Commerce Department, whose primary mission is promoting national
exports. The [Violence Policy Center](http://vpc.org/about-the-vpc/), a
research and advocacy organization that seeks to limit gun deaths, has
indicated that such a move would ease the way for more exports of a
[long
list](https://www.forumarmstrade.org/uploads/1/9/0/8/19082495/examples_of_firearms_transferred_to_commerce_under_new_export_rules.pdf)
of firearms. Those would include sniper rifles and AR-15s, the
now-classic weapon in U.S. mass killings like the school shootings in
Parkland, Florida and Newtown, Connecticut. Under the new plan, the
careful tracking of whose hands such gun exports could end up in will be
yesterday's news and, as a result, U.S. weapons are likely to become far
more accessible to armed gangs, drug cartels, and terrorist operatives.
Pres. Donald Trump's plan would even eliminate the requirement that
Congress be notified in advance of major firearms deals, which would
undoubtedly prove to be the arms loophole of all time. According to
statistics gathered by the Security Assistance Monitor, which gathers
comprehensive information on U.S. military and police aid programs, the
State Department [approved\$662
million](https://securityassistance.org/fact_sheet/congressional-notifications-proposed-us-commercial-firearms-exports-2017)
worth of firearms exports to 15 countries in 2017. The elimination of
Congressional notifications and the other proposed changes will mean
that **[countries like Mexico, The Philippines, Turkey and the United
Arab Emirates, as well as various Central American nations, will have
far easier access to a far wider range of U.S. firearms]{.underline}**
with far less Congressional oversight. And [that, in turn, means that
U.S.-supplied weapons will play even more crucial roles in vicious civil
wars like the one in Yemen and are far more likely to make their way
into the hands of local thugs, death squads, and drug
cartels.]{.underline} And mind you, it isn't as if U.S. gun export
policies were enlightened before the Trump era. They were already
wreaking havoc in neighboring countries. According to a
[report](http://www.latimes.com/opinion/op-ed/la-oe-parsons-us-guns-abroad-20180206-story.html)
from the Center for American Progress, [an astonishing 50,000 U.S. guns
were recovered in criminal investigations in 15 Western Hemisphere
nations between 2014 and 2016.]{.underline} That report goes on to note
that 70 percent of the guns recovered from crime scenes in Mexico that
are sent to U.S. authorities for tracing are identified as being of U.S.
origin. The comparable
[figures](https://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/the-link-between-americas-lax-gun-laws-and-the-violence-that-fuels-immigration)
for Central America are 49 percent for El Salvador, 46 percent for
Honduras and 29 percent for Guatemala. While Trump rails ---
[falsely](https://www.npr.org/2018/06/22/622540331/fact-check-trump-illegal-immigration-and-crime)
--- against a flood of criminals washing across the U.S.-Mexico border,
he conveniently ignores this country's export of violence in the other
direction thanks to both legal and illegal transfers of guns to Mexico
and Central America. The **[United States has, in short, already
effectively weaponized both criminal networks and repressive security
forces in those countries. In other words, it's played a key role in the
killing of significant numbers of innocent civilians there, ratcheting
up the pressure on individuals, families]{.underline}**, and [tens of
thousands](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/migrant-children-at-the-border-by-the-numbers/)
of unaccompanied minors who have then headed for the United States
looking for a safer, better life. Trump's new proposal would potentially
make this situation far worse and his "[big, fat, beautiful
wall](http://www.latimes.com/politics/la-na-pol-trump-california-campaign-20160602-snap-story.html)"
would have to grow larger still. In the past, congressional awareness of
foreign firearm deals has made a difference. In September 2017, under
[pressure](http://www.middleeasteye.net/news/us-halts-arms-sales-erdogan-bodyguards-1467964562)
from Senators Patrick Leahy and Chris Van Hollen, both Democrats, the
Trump administration reversed itself and blocked a sale of 1,600
semiautomatic pistols to Turkey because of abuses by the personal
security forces of that country's president, Recep Erdogan. Similarly,
Senator Ben Cardin, a Democrat, persuaded the Obama administration to
halt a deal that would have sent 26,000 assault rifles to The
Philippines, where security forces and private death squads, egged on by
Pres. Rodrigo Duterte, were [gunning
down](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/apr/02/philippines-president-duterte-drugs-war-death-squads)
thousands of people suspected of, but not charged with or convicted of,
drug trafficking. As The Washington Post columnist Josh Rogin has
[noted](https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/global-opinions/new-trump-rules-could-put-american-guns-in-the-hands-of-dictators-terrorists-and-gangs/2017/09/24/7daa4ffe-9fe2-11e7-9c8d-cf053ff30921_story.html?utm_term=.a8e7ab870ad2),
under the new Trump rules, it will be nearly impossible for members of
Congress to intervene in such a fashion to stop similar deals in the
future. On the implications of the deregulation of firearms exports,
Cardin has [spoken
out](https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/global-opinions/new-trump-rules-could-put-american-guns-in-the-hands-of-dictators-terrorists-and-gangs/2017/09/24/7daa4ffe-9fe2-11e7-9c8d-cf053ff30921_story.html?utm_term=.a8e7ab870ad2)
strongly. "**[The U]{.underline}**nited **[S]{.underline}**tates," he
said, "**[should never make it easier for foreign despots to slaughter
their civilians]{.underline}** or for American-made assault weapons to
be readily available to paramilitary or terrorist groups ... The
administration's proposal makes those scenarios even more possible. [The
United States is, and should be, better than this]{.underline}." The
Trump plan is, however, good news for hire-a-gun successors to
Blackwater, the defunct private contractor whose personnel
[killed](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/apr/13/former-blackwater-guards-sentencing-baghdad-massacre)
17 civilians in Baghdad's Nisour Square in a notorious 2007 incident.
Such firms would be able to
[train](https://securityassistance.org/publication/proposed-firearms-export-changes-key-challenges-us-oversight)
foreign military forces in the use of firearms without seeking licenses
from the State Department, allowing them to operate in places like Libya
that might otherwise have been off-limits.

#### And arms sales create power imbalances -- states will proliferate nuclear weapons to equalize the playing field 

Charles D. **Ferguson**, **2010**, Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists,
"Next customer, please: The risk in conventional arms sales along with.
Nuclear energy deals," 66(6), p. 36-42, mm

At the same time [as major powers are saying that they want to rein in
nuclear proliferation, they are offering]{.underline} both nuclear
energy programs and [conventional weapons to client states]{.underline}.
Military arms sales may shore up certain countries' defenses, but [such
sales may also stimulate conventional arms races and conventional force
imbalances may serve as a rationale for states to acquire nuclear
weapons as great equalizers]{.underline}. [More nuclear weapons in more
states could increase the likelihood of losing control of these weapons
to terrorists, criminals, or other malicious actors]{.underline}. This
author evaluates nuclear energy deals that could result in changing
security perceptions and shifting security alliances, and writes that
such evaluations are important in the context of global security.
Military and nuclear suppliers have incentives to sell conventional arms
and nuclear technologies to clients, he writes, but both
[suppliers]{.underline} and clients [need to be aware of the potential
security consequences]{.underline}. A conventional or nuclear arms race
may not result in armed conflict, but would divert scarce
resources---especially in the developing world---from the civilian
economy. "The sharing of civilian nuclear \[technology\] will be one of
the foundations of a pact of confidence which the West must forge with
the Islamic world," French President Nicolas Sarkozy declared after
signing a peaceful nuclear energy cooperation agreement with Algeria in
December 2007 (Agence France Presse, 2008). In the following three
years, Sarkozy went on to tout the benefits of nuclear energy across the
Arab world by reaching out to Algeria, Jordan, Kuwait, Libya, Qatar,
Saudi Arabia, and the United Arab Emirates. But at the same time, France
is offering to sell these countries military equipment and is trying to
forge closer military ties with some through military bases and
exercises. France is not alone in pursuing nuclear technology
cooperation even as it promotes military relationships and sells
armaments. Russia and the United States have also taken advantage of
renewed interest in nuclear power and worries about military threats.
While the major powers do not intend to increase threats in politically
volatile regions, these nuclear and military sales could inadvertently
fuel fears. Faced with increasing economic competition in nuclear,
defense, and other industries, major powers are doing what comes
naturally: seeking customers. [Global security]{.underline}, however,
[may suffer at the expense of a market mentality---that is, by
stimulating conventional arms races]{.underline}, [which may lead to
war, or by increasing the rationale among client states for nuclear
weapons to counter conventional force imbalances.]{.underline} More
nuclear weapons in more states could increase the likelihood of losing
control of these weapons to terrorists, criminals, or other malicious
actors. Thus, it is worth evaluating the potential security consequences
of increased sales of conventional arms along with nuclear energy
technologies. Military needs meet energy needs The connection between
military partnerships and nuclear energy aid dates to the earliest years
of atomic energy. President Dwight Eisenhower's Atoms for Peace program,
which began in 1953, was designed to win clients for US nuclear
technologies and score a political advantage over Moscow. But in 1955,
the Soviet Union followed suit with similar offers to its clients
(Sexton, 1955). In fact, many former Warsaw Pact countries received
nuclear power assistance from the Soviet Union. The recipients of both
the Soviet and US programs often benefited from military partnerships
with these two major nuclear suppliers. Today, for example, half of the
28 NATO countries have peaceful nuclear power programs; of these 14
programs, all have received help from either the US or the Soviet Union
and now Russia. Also, other major non-NATO US allies such as Japan,
South Korea, and Taiwan rely on nuclear power to generate significant
portions of their electricity and have benefited significantly from
peaceful nuclear energy cooperation with the US. Partnerships with the
US and the Soviet Union offered security benefits from the 1950s to the
end of the Cold War. States within a military union pooled resources for
common defense. Nuclear-armed members could extend their nuclear
deterrents to non-nuclear armed members, thereby reducing the incentive
for further nuclear weapons programs within a union. Indeed, many
European states had explored these programs but refrained from pursuing
them due to the perceived effectiveness of security assurances, the
enactment of the 1970 Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty, and the economic
costs. Since the official dissolution of the Soviet Union in 1991,
several former Warsaw Pact states have joined NATO, thereby receiving US
assurances of nuclear deterrence. And while the US and Russia are no
longer enemies, political tension still exists between them. But the
likelihood of thermonuclear war between the US and Russia has
substantially decreased. [Today]{.underline}, instead of two
superpower-backed military blocs competing against each other, [we have
a more complex security environment with growing global security
concerns about nuclear proliferation and terrorism]{.underline}. And
while Russia and the United States are still major providers of
commercial nuclear technologies, as well as major sellers of
conventional arms (the United States led the world in arms sales with
about \$100 billion in arms deliveries between 2001 and 2008), other
states are now competing in these two lucrative fields (Grimmett, 2009).
France, Japan, and South Korea have emerged in the past decade as
leaders in the construction of nuclear reactors and provision of nuclear
energy services. All three states have leveraged the nuclear technology
assistance that they have received from the United States. While Japan
and South Korea are not major arms suppliers, France has ranked in the
top five global weapons suppliers during the past decade, along with the
United Kingdom and Germany. Global marketplace [While many countries
across the globe are buying arms, the major recipients of these sales
have been countries with growing nuclear power programs or a renewed
interest in nuclear power]{.underline}. From 2001 to 2008, of the total
\$377.5 billion in arms deliveries worldwide, \$116.9 billion worth of
arms went to the top 10 recipients, which have or want to have nuclear
power programs (Grimmett, 2009). These recipients from greatest to least
were: Saudi Arabia, China, India, Egypt, Israel, the UAE, Taiwan, South
Korea, Pakistan, and Malaysia. Of these, China, India, Taiwan, South
Korea, and Pakistan have nuclear power programs and want to increase
their numbers of nuclear plants. The remaining recipients--- Saudi
Arabia, Egypt, Israel, the UAE, and Malaysia---have all expressed
interest in acquiring their first nuclear plants. Major arms sales to
most of these states have preceded by decades the renewed interest in
nuclear power plants. Thus, interest in acquiring nuclear power or fears
about neighboring states' nuclear programs cannot account for all arms
purchases. Just in the past decade, arms sales worldwide have
substantially increased. From 2001 to 2004, there were \$156.1 billion
worth of global arms transfers, and in comparison, from 2005 to 2008,
there were \$221.4 billion worth of arms transfers (Grimmett, 2009).
While many sales were to countries without little or no interest in
acquiring nuclear power programs, sales to, for example, Middle Eastern
states, many of which have recently expressed strong interest in
peaceful nuclear power, have ramped up significantly. From 2001 to 2004,
these states accounted for 42.4 percent (\$33.9 billion) of all sales to
the developing world, and from 2005 to 2008, their proportional
purchases rose to 54.6 percent (\$83.3 billion) (Grimmett, 2009).
Similar trends have been evident in recent years in Southeast Asia and
South Asia, where interest is growing in expanding or starting nuclear
power programs. Faced with simultaneous increases in purchases of
conventional weapons and interest in nuclear power, leaders of states in
the Middle East, Southeast Asia, and South Asia will have to make tough
decisions about how to respond to these events. As the following
overview of recent developments in these regions indicates, these
leaders are acquiring conventional weapons usually to deter their
neighbors from conventional or nuclear attack, and sometimes for power
projection to control strategic bodies of water, such as the Persian
Gulf, the Indian Ocean, and the South China Sea. The latter development
could lead to greater probability of conventional armed conflict. And
[disparities in conventional military strength could increase
neighboring states' rationales for acquiring nuclear
weapons]{.underline}.

#### Proliferation ensures multiple scenarios for global war -- Optimist Theory is wrong

**Kroenig, 14** -- Associate Professor and International Relations Field
Chair, Department of Government, Georgetown (Matthew, February. "The
History of Proliferation Optimism: Does It Have a Future?" Journal of
Strategic Studies Vol 38, Issue 1-2.
http://www.matthewkroenig.com/The%20History%20of%20Proliferation%20Optimism_Feb2014.pdf)

First and foremost, [proliferation **optimists present an oversimplified
view of nuclear deterrence theory**]{.underline}. [Optimists
argue]{.underline} that since the advent of Mutually Assured Destruction
(MAD), any [nuclear war would mean national suicide and, therefore, no
rational leader would ever choose to start one.]{.underline}
Furthermore, they argue that the requirements for rationality are not
high. Rather, leaders must value their own survival and the survival of
their nation and understand that intentionally launching a nuclear war
would threaten those values. Many analysts and policymakers attempt to
challenge the optimists on their own turf and question whether the
leaders of potential proliferant states are fully rational.34 Yet, these
debates overlook the fact that, apart from the optimists, leadi[ng
nuclear deterrence theorists believe that nuclear proliferation
contributes to a **real risk of nuclear war even in a situation of MAD
among rational states**]{.underline}.35 Moreover, realizing that nuclear
war is possible does not depend on peculiar beliefs about the
possibility of escaping MAD.36 Rather, as we will discuss below, these
theorists understand that [some risk of nuclear war is **necessary in
order for deterrence to function**]{.underline}. To be sure, in the
1940s, Viner, Brodie, and others argued that MAD rendered war among
major powers obsolete, but nuclear deterrence theory soon advanced
beyond that simple understanding.37 After all, [great power political
competition does not end with nuclear weapons]{.underline}. And
[nuclear-armed states still seek to threaten nuclear-armed
adversaries]{.underline}. [States cannot credibly threaten to launch a
suicidal nuclear war, but they still want to coerce their adversaries.
This leads to a credibility problem: how can states credibly threaten a
nuclear-armed opponent?]{.underline} Since the 1960s, academic nuclear
deterrence theory has been devoted almost exclusively to answering this
question.38 And their answers do not give us reasons to be optimistic.
Thomas [Schelling was the first to devise a rational means by which
states can threaten nuclear-armed opponents]{.underline}.39 He argued
that [leaders cannot credibly threaten to intentionally launch a
suicidal nuclear war, but they can make a 'threat that leaves something
to chance'.]{.underline} 40 They can engage in a process, the nuclear
crisis, which increases the risk of nuclear war in an attempt to force a
less resolved adversary to back down. [As states escalate a nuclear
crisis there is an **increasing probability that the conflict will
spiral out of control** **and result in an inadvertent or accidental
nuclear exchange**]{.underline}. [As long as the benefit of winning the
crisis is greater than the incremental increase in the risk of nuclear
war, however, threats to escalate nuclear crises are inherently
credible]{.underline}. In these games of nuclear brinkmanship, [the
state that is willing to run the greatest risk of nuclear war before
backing down will win the crisis]{.underline}, as long as it does not
end in catastrophe. It is for this reason that Thomas [Schelling called
great power politics in the nuclear era a '**competition in risk
taking'**.]{.underline} 41 This does not mean that states eagerly bid up
the risk of nuclear war. Rather, they face gut-wrenching decisions at
each stage of the crisis. They can quit the crisis to avoid nuclear war,
but only by ceding an important geopolitical issue to an opponent. Or
they can the escalate the crisis in an attempt to prevail, but only at
the risk of suffering a possible nuclear exchange. Since 1945 there were
have been 20 high stakes nuclear crises in which 'rational' states like
the United States run a frighteningly-real risk of nuclear war.42 [By
asking whether states can be deterred, therefore, proliferation
optimists are **asking the wrong question**]{.underline}. [The right
question to ask is: what risk of nuclear war is a specific state willing
to run against a particular opponent in a given crisis?]{.underline}
Optimists are likely correct when they assert that a nuclear-armed Iran
will not intentionally commit national suicide by launching a
bolt-from-the-blue nuclear attack on the United States or Israel. This
does not mean that Iran will never use nuclear weapons, however. Indeed,
it is almost inconceivable to think that a nuclear-armed Iran would not,
at some point, find itself in a crisis with another nuclear-armed power.
It is also inconceivable that in those circumstances, Iran would not be
willing to run some risk of nuclear war in order to achieve its
objectives. If a nuclear-armed Iran and the United States or Israel were
to have a geopolitical conflict in the future, over the internal
politics of Syria, an Israeli conflict with Iran's client Hizballah, the
US presence in the Persian Gulf, shipping through the Strait of Hormuz,
or some other issue, do we believe that Iran would immediately
capitulate? Or is it possible that Iran would push back, possibly
brandishing nuclear weapons in an attempt to coerce its adversaries? If
the latter, there is a risk that proliferation to Iran could result in
nuclear war and proliferation optimists are wrong to dismiss it out of
hand. [An optimist might counter that nuclear weapons will never be
used, even in a crisis situation, because states have such a strong
incentive]{.underline}, namely national survival, to ensure that nuclear
weapons are not used. [But this objection ignores the fact that leaders
operate under competing pressures]{.underline}. [Leaders in
nuclear-armed states also have strong incentives to convince their
adversaries that nuclear weapons might be used.]{.underline}
Historically [we have seen that leaders take actions in crises, such as
**placing nuclear weapons on high alert** and **delegating nuclear
launch authority to low-level commanders**, to **purposely increase the
risk of nuclear war** in an attempt to force less-resolved opponents to
back down.]{.underline} Moreover, not even the optimists' first
principles about the irrelevance of nuclear posture stand up to
scrutiny. [Not all nuclear wars would be equally devastating.43 Any
nuclear exchange would have devastating consequences no doubt, but, if a
crisis were to spiral out of control and result in nuclear war, any sane
leader would rather face a country with five nuclear weapons than one
with 5,000]{.underline}. Similarly, any sane leader would be willing to
run a greater risk of nuclear war against the former state than against
the latter. Indeed, scholars have demonstrated that states are willing
to run greater risks and are, therefore, more likely to win nuclear
crises when they enjoy nuclear superiority over their opponents.44
[Proliferation optimists might be correct that no rational leader would
choose to launch a suicidal nuclear war, but, depending on the context,
**any sane leader would almost certainly be willing to risk
one**]{.underline}. Nuclear deterrence theorists have also proposed a
second scenario under which [rational leaders would be willing to
instigate a]{.underline} nuclear exchange: [limited nuclear
war]{.underline}.45 For example, [by launching a single nuclear weapon
against a small city, a nuclear-armed state could signal its willingness
to escalate a crisis]{.underline}, while leaving its adversary with
enough left to lose to deter the adversary from launching a full-scale
nuclear response. In a future crisis between China and the United
States, for example, China could choose to launch a nuclear strike on a
US military base in East Asia to demonstrate its seriousness. In that
situation, with the continental United States intact, would Washington
choose to launch a full-scale nuclear war on China that could result in
the destruction of many American cities? Or would it back down? China
might decide to strike after calculating that Washington would prefer a
humiliating retreat over a full-scale nuclear war. [If launching a
limited nuclear war could be a rational strategic move under certain
circumstances, it then follows that **the spread of nuclear weapons
increases the risk of nuclear use**]{.underline}. To be sure, some
strategic thinkers, including Henry Kissinger, advocated limited nuclear
war as a viable strategy only to recant the position later due to fears
of uncontrollable escalation. Yet, this does not change the fact that
[leading nuclear deterrence theorists maintain that limited nuclear war
is possible among rational leaders in a MAD world]{.underline}.46

#### Trump's CAT policy is a key part of his 'America first' agenda -- this will lead to the rapid and uncontrolled diffusion of advanced weapons systems 

Shimon **Arad**, 9/28/**18**, War on the Rocks, "Trump's Arms Exports
Policy: Debunking Key Assumptions,"
https://warontherocks.com/2018/09/trumps-arms-exports-policy-debunking-key-assumptions/,
mm

The [Trump]{.underline} administration [recently released its
new]{.underline} Conventional Arms Transfer ([CAT) policy designed to
increase]{.underline} the already well-established U[.S. dominance of
the global arms market.]{.underline} Increasing arms exports is seen as
an important part of the administration's aim to strengthen America's
economy and security. Traditionally, U.S. arms exports have been used as
tools of power and influence, giving it political leverage over clients.
Paradoxically, however, the emphasis placed on the economic utility of
arms sales by the Trump administration is increasing the bargaining
power of clients, thereby reducing U.S. political sway. The leverage of
client states and the U.S. arms industry is leading the administration
to release advanced military capabilities earlier than it would have
done otherwise and to play down human rights considerations raised by
Congress. Ironically, additional economic and security steps being taken
by the Trump administration may be undermining some of the intended
benefits of the new CAT policy. The president's economic protectionist
agenda, including the imposition of tariffs on steel and aluminum
supposedly because of national security considerations, could undermine
U.S. defense sales by driving up prices or by prompting retaliation from
affected arms clients. Political tensions between Washington and some
its allies and partners -- especially in NATO --- may also be
encouraging them to find ways to decrease their dependence on
American-made subsystems and to increase defense industrial cooperation
between them to the exclusion of the United States. This could
potentially reduce future U.S. arms and subsystem sales to these
countries and increase competition with them for global markets. [The
first CAT policy was introduced by]{.underline} President Jimmy
[Carter]{.underline} on May 19, 1977. [Its underlying principle was that
arms transfers were to be treated with a strong presumption of
denial]{.underline} "as an exceptional foreign policy implement" with
"the burden of persuasion ... on those who favor a particular sale,
rather than those who oppose it." To further this policy of self-imposed
restraint, Carter instituted a ceiling on the total dollar value of
American arms transfers to all but a few traditional allies. He pledged
that the United States would not be the first supplier to introduce into
Third World areas "newly developed, advanced weapons systems which could
create a new or significantly higher combat capability." In implementing
this policy, Carter issued the so-called "leprosy letter," instructing
American diplomats abroad to refrain from assisting the U.S. arms
industry in its efforts to secure foreign buyers. In April, the
[Trump]{.underline} administration [launched the fifth iteration of the
CAT policy,]{.underline} [designed to increase the exports of U.S. arms
as an integral part of its "America First" policy agenda. The present
version]{.underline} of the CAT policy prioritizes arms transfers as an
important tool of American foreign policy and, [in stark contrast to the
vision of Carter, is predicated on a strong assumption of
approval]{.underline} and the active advocacy of the U.S. government and
its diplomats with foreign leaders and governments to buy American-made
arms. The Trump administration presents its new arms policy as a
response to the ongoing strategic competition between the great powers.
Its argument is that the new CAT policy will enable Washington to
preserve international peace by strengthening the military capabilities
of its allies and partners, while reducing the need for American boots
on the ground; maintaining its influence over the policies and actions
of client states in key regions around the world; strengthening the U.S.
military by increasing interoperability with allies and partners;
supporting the defense industry; promoting new innovation; and
maintaining American jobs. The new policy also refers to the need for an
assessment of the risks that arms transfers may pose to human rights
violations, to technology transfer issues and/or U.S. nonproliferation
objectives. The Nervous U.S. Domination of the Arms Market The United
States dominates the growing global arms market and according to data
gathered by the authoritative Stockholm International Peace Research
Institute (SIPRI), its lead is expanding. The United States accounted
for 34 percent of total arms exports between 2013 and 2017, ranking it
significantly higher than its main competitors Russia (22 percent),
France (6.7 percent), Germany (5.8 percent), China (5.7 percent), and
Britain (4.8 percent). In FY 2018, the value of signed arms deals
continued to increase, reaching over \$46 billion, exceeding the \$41
billion figure of FY 2017. Undergirding this policy is Trump's vision
that economic security is national security. The defense and aerospace
industry is America's second-largest gross exporter. The industry
contributes approximately \$1 trillion annually to the U.S. economy and
employs around 2,500,000 people. On average, 30 percent of the
industry's annual revenue is through arms exports, which reduces the
need for domestic investment, reduces the cost-per-unit for the U.S.
military, and enables an increase of investments in innovation, thereby
retaining America's technological lead. However, a number of trends
combine to make Washington nervous about its lead in global arms sales.
The first is a growing effort by other technologically innovative arms
exporters to compete with the United States for markets. Arms sales by
Britain, France, Spain, China, and Russia have reduced America's
potential share of the important markets of the Middle East (49 percent
of the U.S. arms exports between 2013 and 2017) and Asia. To a certain
extent, the people behind the new CAT policy believe that the strict and
rigid regulatory and procedural frameworks that governed the arms
exports processes have undermined the U.S. competitiveness in the global
arms market and the implementation of the new policy is anticipated to
increase sales. A second trend is the deliberate policy of client states
to diversify their arms purchases. The Arab Sunni states, for example,
have in the last couple of years spent tens of billions of dollars on
European or Russian arms rather than on U.S.-made weapon systems. Even a
country like Egypt, which has received nearly \$80 billion in military
and economic aid over the past 30 years, has tapped from its reserves
and loans from Gulf states and from suppliers in order to purchase at
least \$13 billion worth of arms since 2013 from France, Russia, and
Germany rather than from the United States. The new CAT policy aims to
encourage allies and partners to buy U.S.-made arms, including by
increasing competitiveness by dropping surcharges on products and
lowering the costs of transportation. A third trend is the growing
demands of client states for more substantial offsets and localization
of production and maintenance, including the transfer of technology.
Thus, for example, under its Vision 2030, Saudi Arabia wants to
eventually subject foreign military contracts to a 50 percent
localization rule, based on a partnership model that includes the
sharing of technologies and skills. The Middle East's growing armored
vehicles market, which is expected to reach more than \$31 billion by
2021, is an example of a growing demand for the transfer of technical
knowledge which is used to strengthen an indigenous defense sector that
has already begun to export its own products. Some Western European
countries are more forthcoming on this issue than the United States.
However, some U.S. companies have begun forming subsidiaries abroad.
Mobilizing the Whole Arms Exports "Ecosystem" In essence, [the new CAT
policy is designed to improve the "mechanics" of the administration's
arms exports system]{.underline}. As explained by Deputy Director for
the Regional Security and Arms Transfers Laura Cressey: In sum, what
we're trying to do in this --- in this whole-of-government effort
looking at the arms transfer process really from soup to nuts is trying
to ensure that once we have decided that a transfer of a defense
capability to a partner is in the national security interest of the
United States, that we are able to effectively compete and efficiently
deliver the equipment to our partner as quickly as possible. This effort
is promoted by active leadership advocacy, including by the president
himself, and by hands-on marketing efforts by senior officials
participating in international arms-shows and by American diplomats
around the globe. Additionally, the administration is actively engaging
with the U.S. arms industry, including it in the interagency process of
implementing the new CAT policy. The U.S. Chamber of Commerce's new
Defense and Aerospace Export Council submitted, during the planning
phase of the new CAT policy, 30 recommendations on how to improve the
arms exports decision processes. Congress is also being engaged by the
administration and concerns being raised, especially over possible human
rights violations of client states, are being addressed at the highest
levels of the administration. Along with the reduction of surcharge and
transportation costs, a number of additional steps are being taken in
order to increase competitiveness. These include helping allies and
partners to identify their critical needs and expediting the transfer of
these capabilities. Furthermore, help for smaller allies to finance the
purchase of American weapons through payment schemes may be offered. The
administration is also engaging with industry to develop a strategy to
deal with the issue of offset demands from clients while being able to
effectively compete for sales. Debunking Key Assumptions Though
impressive in ambition, expectation, and design, the new CAT policy is
premised on a number of underlying assumptions that need to be examined.
First, there are those that believe that the implementation of the new
CAT policy should lead to a linear increase in annual arms exports. As
Undersecretary of State for Arms Control and International Security
Andrea Thompson recently projected about the level of arms exports for
2019, "the CAT policy will have been in place, we'll have gained those
efficiencies and feedback from industry and partners ... so I would
anticipate that would increase sales, one would think." However, the
annual worth of arms exports tends to be uneven and dependent on what
clients are seeking to buy. The sale of major and expensive weapon
systems, such as warplanes, can single-handedly boost the worth of arms
exports for any given year. The highest recorded year of arms sales was
FY 2012 totaling \$69.1 billion, but this included a single \$29 billion
deal for the sale of 84 F-15s to Saudi Arabia. According to the figures
of the Defense Security Cooperation Agency, in FY 2014 arms exports
totaled \$34.2 billion, FY 2015 totaled \$47 billion, FY 2016 totaled
\$33.6 billion, FY 2017 totaled \$41.9 billion, while FY 2018 has so far
totaled \$46.9 billion. Large-scale sales of major weapon systems create
capacity limits in consecutive years. For example, the surge in the sale
of advanced fighter jets to the Gulf countries during the Obama
presidency will slow down the future sale of these high-priced items in
the years to come, affecting overall totals of annual sales.
Principally, the periodic military needs of clients are going to play a
far larger role in determining whether the United States is going to
increase foreign arms sales in the coming years than the governmental
streamlining of organizations and procedures. Moreover, as noted above,
some of Washington's major clients, such as the Gulf states and India
have a deliberate policy of diversifying their arms imports. A
streamlined U.S. approach to arms exports makes little difference to
deliberate arms diversification strategies adopted by client countries.
At its core, a policy of diversification is designed to increase
leverage on the United States, to retain freedom of action, and to hedge
against possible negative U.S. regional policies and to push up the
quality of the capabilities being offered. Therefore, easing U.S.
defense export regulations or reducing surcharge rates will not
necessarily make much difference to the choices that these countries
will make regarding the purchase of American versus non-American-made
weapon systems. A case in point that highlights the potency of
self-serving strategic considerations on the negotiation of arms deals
is Qatar. Following the severing of diplomatic ties with Bahrain, Egypt,
Saudi Arabia, and the United Arab Emirates in June 2017, Qatar
negotiated arms deals with multiple exporters in an attempt to overcome
its regional isolation and broaden its international support and
partnerships. It signed deals with the U.S. for 36 F-15s (\$6.2 billion)
and precision-guided munitions, with Britain for 24 Eurofighters (\$6.7
billion), with Italy for helicopters (\$3 billion) and for warships (\$5
billion). In addition, it has negotiated deals with its regional partner
Turkey (\$700 million) as well as with Norway (\$1.9 billion). The
perception of favorable U.S. long-term regional policies by clients
around the world is far more likely to increase arms sales than the
enhanced processes incorporated into the new CAT policy. Additionally,
arms sales figures may be affected by other administration policy
initiatives outside of CAT, such as President Donald Trump's tariffs on
steel and aluminum imports. Ironically, the imposition of these tariffs
supposedly based on national security considerations could undermine
U.S. defense sales by driving up prices or from retaliation from
affected arms clients. The administration also uses export rules to
improve its commercial competition over other exporters dependent on
U.S. components. This is pushing traditional U.S. arms production
partners to become increasingly wary of continued cooperation and
potentially reducing future profits from the sale of U.S. subsystems to
allies and partners. A case in point is the U.S. refusal to authorize
the sale of parts for the sale of the French SCALP cruise missile to
Egypt. The French government is now seeking to reduce its reliance on
U.S.-made components in its weapon systems in order to increase their
exportability, potentially increasing future competition and reducing
U.S. revenues in the future. From a European perspective, the
uncertainty surrounding Trump's commitment to NATO's mutual defense
provision, as well as his rebukes over their financial commitments to
the alliance are unsettling, especially in light of Russia's resurgent
challenges in Eastern Europe. As the French Armed Forces Minister,
Florence Parly, recently said: Can we always count, in every place and
in every circumstance, on American support?...Listen to the statements
of the U.S. president, read his tweets: The message sent is clear and
without ambiguity...We have to count on ourselves ... build a European
strategic autonomy. On the industrial front, this push for more
strategic autonomy has already prompted some European countries to
increase their independence in major weapon system projects, including
the development of a next-generation fighter jet that will compete with
the F-35, and a new tank, potentially reducing markets for the U.S.
fighter. This brings us to another set of assumptions to do with
leverage: Presently, the global arms market, with the availability of
comparable U.S., European, Russian, and Chinese weapon systems, is a
"buyers' market." The prominence placed by the Trump administration on
the economic value of arms sales reduces U.S. leverage over affluent
clients. Presently, the administration continues to certify arms exports
for Saudi Arabia's Yemen campaign in spite of opposition from Congress,
out of fear that a cutoff of support could jeopardize \$2 billion in
weapon sales to the U.S.'s Gulf allies. The United States is not alone
in feeling the might of the "buyers' market." After nixing a planned
delivery of 400 laser-guided bombs to Saudi Arabia because of it's Yemen
campaign, Spain reversed its decision once more. Canceling the delivery
might have jeopardized a Saudi order of five Spanish corvettes worth \$2
billion, with thousands of jobs at stake. In addition, Germany has
approved the delivery of weapon systems to Saudi Arabia and the United
Arab Emirates in spite of a coalition deal between Germany's ruling
parties not to sell weapons to any of the sides involved in the fighting
in Yemen. The desire to increase revenues from arms exports in the
present "buyers' market" is leading the Trump administration to consider
the release of previously denied advanced capabilities for export. A
prime example is the administrations push to redefine the categorization
of unmanned aerial aircrafts to increase America's share of the global
market, that is expected to grow in worth from about \$6 billion in 2015
to \$12 billion in 2025. Easing previous restrictions, the
administration has also recently given permission to market armed drones
to India as well as to certain countries in Europe and the Asia-Pacific.
The Trump administration is also reported to be considering the sale of
the F-35 to the Gulf states even though this has been a denied
capability given America's commitment to Israel's qualitative military
edge. All told, [in the booming "buyers' arms market" the presumption of
approval policy is likely to increase the diffusion of progressively
more advanced U.S. military technologies and capabilities around the
globe]{.underline}. [Given the circumstances of reverse leverage, the
influence of the U.S. over the use of the arms it exports is unlikely to
be substantial. The United States has truly made an about face from the
policy of Jimmy Carter]{.underline}.

#### Trump's 'America First' policies undermine soft power -- diminishes the effectiveness of hegemony 

Joseph **Nye**, 5/6/**19**, Project Syndicate, "American soft power in
the age of trump,"

US President Donald [Trump's administration has shown little interest in
public diplomacy. And yet public diplomacy]{.underline} -- a
government's efforts to communicate directly with other countries'
publics -- [is one of the key instruments policymakers use to generate
soft power, and the current information revolution makes such
instruments more important than ever]{.underline}. [Opinion polls and
the]{.underline} Portland [Soft Power]{.underline} 30 [index show that
American soft power has declined since the beginning of Trump's
term]{.underline}. Tweets can help to set the global agenda, but they do
not produce soft power if they are not attractive to others. [Trump's
defenders reply that soft power]{.underline} -- what happens in the
minds of others [-- is irrelevant; only hard power]{.underline}, with
its military and economic instruments, [matters]{.underline}. In March
2017, Trump's budget director, Mick Mulvaney, proclaimed a "hard power
budget" that would have slashed funding for the State Department and the
US Agency for International Development by nearly 30%. [Fortunately,
military leaders know better]{.underline}. In 2013, General James Mattis
(later Trump's first Secretary of Defense) warned Congress, "If you
don't fund the State Department fully, then I need to buy more
ammunition ultimately." As Henry [Kissinger]{.underline} once pointed
out, [international order depends not only on the balance of hard power,
but also on perceptions of legitimacy, which depends crucially on soft
power]{.underline}. Information revolutions always have profound
socioeconomic and political consequences -- witness the dramatic effects
of Gutenberg's printing press on Europe in the fifteenth and sixteenth
centuries. One can date the current information revolution from the
1960s and the advent of "Moore's Law": the number of transistors on a
computer chip doubles roughly every two years. As a result, computing
power increased dramatically, and by the beginning of this century cost
0.1% of what it did in the early 1970s. In 1993, there were about 50
websites in the world; by 2000, that number surpassed five million.
Today, more than four billion people are online; that number is
projected to grow to 5-6 billion people by 2020, and the "Internet of
Things" will connect tens of billions of devices. Facebook has more
users than the populations of China and the US combined. [In such a
world, the power to attract and persuade becomes increasingly
important]{.underline}. But long gone are the days when public diplomacy
was mainly conducted through radio and television broadcasting.
Technological advances have led to a dramatic reduction in the cost of
processing and transmitting information. The result is an explosion of
information, which has produced a "paradox of plenty": an abundance of
information leads to scarcity of attention. When the volume of
information confronting people becomes overwhelming, it is hard to know
what to focus on. Social media algorithms are designed to compete for
attention. Reputation becomes even more important than in the past, and
political struggles, informed by social and ideological affinities,
often center on the creation and destruction of credibility. Social
media can make false information look more credible if it comes from
"friends." As US Special Counsel Robert Mueller's report on Russian
interference in the 2016 presidential election showed, this enabled
Russia to weaponize American social media. [Reputation has always
mattered in world politics, but credibility has become an even more
important power resource]{.underline}. Information that appears to be
propaganda may not only be scorned, but may also turn out to be
counterproductive if it undermines a country's reputation for
credibility -- and thus reduces its soft power. The most effective
propaganda is not propaganda. It is a two-way dialogue among people.
Russia and China do not seem to comprehend this, and sometimes the
United States fails to pass the test as well. During the Iraq War, for
example, the treatment of prisoners at Abu Ghraib in a manner
inconsistent with American values led to perceptions of hypocrisy that
could not be reversed by broadcasting pictures of Muslims living well in
America. Today, presidential "tweets" that prove to be demonstrably
false undercut America's credibility and reduce its soft power. The
effectiveness of public diplomacy is measured by minds changed (as
reflected in interviews or polls), not dollars spent or number of
messages sent. [Domestic or foreign policies that appear
hypocritical]{.underline}, arrogant, indifferent to others' views, [or
based on a narrow conception of national interest can undermine soft
power]{.underline}. For example, there was a steep decline in the
attractiveness of the US in opinion polls conducted after the invasion
of Iraq in 2003 . In the 1970s, many people around the world objected to
the US war in Vietnam, and America's global standing reflected the
unpopularity of that

[Under the Trump administration, the U.S. has **unquestionably
downgraded the importance of 'soft power'** and diplomacy with respect
to support for international treaties and organizations, **international
human rights, and the promotion of freedom and democracy**.]{.underline}
[Washington is simultaneously solidifying its position as the leading
global arms dealer]{.underline}. [The U.S. supplies some of the world's
most odious autocratic regimes with advanced weapon systems and
munitions.]{.underline} [A recent report by]{.underline} the Stockholm
International Peace Research Institute [(SIPRI) is the latest research
detailing the scale of the issue. From 2014 to 2018, the U.S. was the
world's top exporter of weapons, from advanced fighter jets to missiles
and bombs.]{.underline} [The U.S. now accounts for 36% of the total
volume of arms exports, up from 30% during the previous four-year time
period (2009-2013).]{.underline} SIPRI measures arms sales by volume and
does so in four-year blocks to more accurately evaluate the accuracy of
emerging trends. Following the U.S., the next four largest arms
exporters were Russia, France, Germany, and China, respectively. [The
destination for these sales has primarily been countries in the Middle
East]{.underline}. [**Saudi Arabia is now the world's largest importer
of weapons**, with an astonishing **192% increase in imports** between
2009-2013 and 2014-2018, the last two SIPRI reporting
periods]{.underline}. [These weapons are used to continue Riyadh's
disastrous war in Yemen]{.underline}. [The U.S. is directly supporting
that war]{.underline} through intelligence sharing and arms sales.
**[The bombs dropped on Yemeni schools and hospitals by Saudi
planes]{.underline}** likely **[came from the U.S.]{.underline}**, which
in turn bears responsibility for the civilian casualties. Additionally,
Riyadh wants to build up its military to counter Iran's influence in the
region, a goal shared by the Trump administration. The gap between
Iran's military capabilities and that of other Gulf countries is
widening due to strict sanctions on Iranian arms imports and the steady
increase in imports by rivals such as Riyadh and Abu Dhabi. In Egypt,
[President al-Sisi has solidified his autocratic grip on
power]{.underline} and has compiled a robust arsenal to use against the
persistent insurgent threat posed by the so-called Islamic State
affiliate in the Sinai, as well as against any other insurgency. Between
2014-2018, Egypt became the world's third largest importer of weapons.
Egypt has cracked down on even the slightest hint of dissent, from
journalists and activists to non-governmental organizations. [The U.S.
has long been a primary arms supplier to Egypt, regardless of its
history of authoritarian leaders, choosing a foreign policy posture
**more concerned with stability than the promotion of democracy and
human rights.**]{.underline} [Al-Sisi, and Mubarak before him, relied on
U.S. weapons imports to maintain the government's control over the
population]{.underline}. Moscow, Paris, and Berlin have also been major
suppliers of weapons to Cairo. [The Trump administration has been vocal
in its determination to increase arms sales to the highest
bidder.]{.underline} Arms sales to countries like Saudi Arabia are
assessed as a positive indicator of national power and influence. Recent
congressional votes to curtail the sale of weapons in support of the war
in Yemen are essential steps but likely will not have any near-term
practical impact. The total quantity of arms sales has not approached
peak-Cold War-era levels, and regions once plagued with persistent high
arms imports like Africa, and Latin America have seen decreases,
overall. But **[the increases to the ME]{.underline}**NA [**region are
dramatic and show no sign of abating**, as countries continue to spend
vast sums of money on expensive military hardware.]{.underline}

#### The link is reverse causal - Reducing arms sales bolsters soft power through effective dialogue and diplomacy 

A. Trevor **Thrall and** Caroline **Dorminey**, 3/13/18, \[Thrall is an
associate professor at the Schar School of Policy and Government at
George Mason; Dorminey is a policy analyst at the Cato Institute-, Cato
Institute, "risky business: the role of arms sales in US foreign
policy,"
https://www.cato.org/publications/policy-analysis/risky-business-role-arms-sales-us-foreign-policy,
mm

So far we have argued that arms sales lack a compelling strategic
justification, amplify risks, and generate a host of unintended negative
consequences. These factors alone argue for significantly curtailing the
arms trade. But the case for doing so is made even stronger by the fact
that [greatly reducing arms sales would also produce]{.underline} two
[significant benefits for the United States]{.underline} that cannot
otherwise be enjoyed. [The first benefit from reducing arms sales would
be greater diplomatic flexibility and leverage.]{.underline} Critics
might argue that even if arms sales are an imperfect tool, forgoing arms
sales will eliminate a potential source of leverage. We argue that, on
the contrary, [the diplomatic gains from forgoing arms sales will
outweigh the potential leverage or other benefits from arms
sales]{.underline}. Most importantly[, by refraining from arming nations
engaged in conflict, the United States will have the diplomatic
flexibility to engage with all parties as an honest broker]{.underline}.
[The inherent difficulty of negotiating while arming one side is obvious
today with respect to North and South Korea]{.underline}. After decades
of U.S. support for South Korea, North Korea clearly does not trust the
United States. [Similarly, U.S. attempts to help negotiate a peace deal
between the Israelis and Palestinians have long been complicated by
American support for Israel.]{.underline} To stop arming one side of a
contentious relationship is not to suggest that the United States does
not have a preferred outcome in such cases. Rather, [by staying out of
the military domain the United States can more readily encourage
dialogue and diplomacy]{.underline}. [Forgoing arms sales is likely to
be a superior strategy even in cases where the United States has an
entrenched interest. In the case of Taiwan,]{.underline} for example,
though it is clear that Taiwan needs to purchase weapons from other
countries to provide for its defense, those weapons do not have to be
made in the United States. [Having Taiwan buy from other suppliers would
help defuse U.S.-China tensions]{.underline}. Even if Taiwan's defenses
remained robust, China would clearly prefer a situation in which
American arms no longer signal an implicit promise to fight on Taiwan's
behalf. This could also promote more productive U.S.-China diplomacy in
general, as well as greater stability in the Pacific region. Most
important, [breaking off arms sales would also reduce the likelihood of
the United States becoming entangled in a future conflict between Taiwan
and China.]{.underline} [The second major benefit of reducing arms sales
is that it would imbue the United States with greater moral
authority]{.underline}. Today, [as the leading arms-dealing nation in
the world, the United States lacks credibility in discussions of arms
control and nonproliferation, especially in light of its military
interventionism since 2001. By showing the world that it is ready to
choose diplomacy over the arms trade, the United States would provide a
huge boost to international efforts to curtail proliferation and its
negative consequences]{.underline}. [This is important because the
United States has pursued and will continue to pursue a wide range of
arms control and nonproliferation objectives. The United States is a
signatory of treaties dealing with weapons of mass destruction, missile
technology, land mines, and cluster munitions, not to mention the flow
of conventional weapons of all kinds. The effectiveness of these
treaties, and the ability to create more effective and enduring arms
control and nonproliferation frameworks, however, depends on how the
United States behaves.]{.underline}

#### Soft power is key to hegemony

problem. Should we care?"

mm

[Gallup\'s latest numbers show the image of U.S. leadership abroad is
not good]{.underline} right now. Its approval rating is basically
unchanged from the all-time low set last year. Maybe this isn\'t
entirely a bad thing. Doing what\'s right isn\'t always popular.
President Donald Trump\'s America First foreign policy wasn\'t designed
to win friends around the globe. Trump believes that the U.S. has been
wronged in most international agreements. He notably pulled out of the
Trans-Pacific Partnership trade agreement, the Paris Climate Accord and
the Iran nuclear deal. He\'s renegotiating the North American Free Trade
Agreement and started trade wars with China, the EU and other
long-standing trade partners. He criticized NATO allies and opened a
direct dialogue with North Korea. These actions were intended to benefit
America, not make the country more popular. But [should we really care
what the world thinks of the U.S.? If you subscribe to the concept of
soft power, yes, we should. Where hard power is reflected in
America\'s]{.underline} ability to impose its [economic and military
might]{.underline} on others, [soft power is the type that makes people
in other countries want to align their interests with the
U.S]{.underline}. \-- not because they have to, but because they want
to. [Scholars have shown quantitatively that this type of influence
exists]{.underline}. [Researchers]{.underline} at Dartmouth and the
University of Sydney looked at the relationship between countries\'
voting patterns at the United Nations and their citizens\' attitudes
about U.S. foreign policy. They [found that \"public opinion about U.S.
foreign policy in foreign countries does affect their policies toward
the U.S]{.underline}.\" [This suggests that America\'s recent
unpopularity may be making it harder to lead globally.]{.underline} But
it might affect more than foreign countries\' policies toward the U.S.
Newer research at Berkeley indicates soft power may even negatively
affect trade. The researcher found that America\'s recent unpopularity
abroad is costing the country billions of dollars in global trade.

#### Hegemony prevents [great-power conflict]{.underline} --- multipolar revisionism [fragments]{.underline} the [global order]{.underline} and causes [nuclear war]{.underline}.

Each of these geopolitical challenges is different, and each reflects
the distinctive interests, ambitions, and history of the country
undertaking it. Yet [there is **growing cooperation** between the
countries that are **challenging** the **regional pillars of the
U.S.-led order.** **Russia** and **China** have **collaborated**
on]{.underline} issues such as energy, sales and development of
**[military technology]{.underline}**, opposition to additional U.S.
military deployments on the Korean peninsula, and naval exercises from
the South China Sea to the Baltic. In Syria, [Iran provided the **shock
troops** that helped keep Russia's ally]{.underline}, Bashar [al-Assad,
in power]{.underline}, as Moscow provided the air power and the
diplomatic cover. "[Our **cooperation** can **isolate
America**]{.underline}," supreme leader Ali Khamenei told Putin in 2017.
More broadly, [what links these challenges together is their
**opposition** to the constellation of **power, norms, and
relationships** that the U.S.-led order entails, and in their propensity
to use **violence**]{.underline}, coercion, and intimidation [as means
of making that opposition **effective**]{.underline}. Taken
collectively, [these challenges constitute a **geopolitical sea
change**]{.underline} from the post-Cold War era.

[The revival of [**great-power competition**
entails]{.mark}]{.underline} higher international tensions than the
world has known for decades, and the revival of [[**arms races, security
dilemmas**, and]{.mark} **other artifacts** of a more **dangerous
past**. It entails **[sharper conflicts]{.mark}** over the international
rules]{.underline} of the road on issues ranging from freedom of
navigation to the illegitimacy of altering borders by force, [and
**intensifying competitions** over states that reside at the
intersection of rival powers' **areas of interest**]{.underline}. It
requires confronting the prospect that [[**rival powers** could
**overturn** the]{.mark} **favorable [regional balances]{.mark}** [that
have **underpinned** the U.S.-led order]{.mark} for decades, and that
[they might construct **rival spheres of
influence**]{.mark}]{.underline} from which America and the liberal
ideas it has long promoted would be excluded. Finally, it necessitates
recognizing that [[great-power rivalry could lead to **great-power
war**]{.underline}]{.mark}, a prospect that seemed to have followed the
Soviet empire onto the ash heap of history.

Both [[**Beijing** and **Moscow** are]{.underline}]{.mark}, after all,
[**optimizing their forces** and **[exercising aggressively]{.mark}** in
preparation [for]{.mark} potential **[conflicts]{.mark}** with the
U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates and its allies; [[Russian
doctrine]{.mark} explicitly [emphasizes the]{.mark}]{.underline} limited
[[use of **nuclear weapons**]{.underline}]{.mark} to achieve escalation
dominance in a war with Washington. In Syria, [U.S. and Russian forces
even came into **deadly contact**]{.underline} in early 2018. American
airpower decimated a contingent of government-sponsored Russian
mercenaries that was attacking a base at which U.S. troops were present,
an incident demonstrating the increasing boldness of Russian operations
and the corresponding potential for escalation. [[The
world]{.underline}]{.mark} has not yet returned to the epic clashes for
global dominance that characterized the twentieth century, but it [[has
returned to]{.mark} the **historical norm** of **[great-power
struggle]{.mark}**]{.underline}, with all the associated dangers.

Those dangers may be even greater than most observers appreciate,
because if today's great-power competitions are still most intense at
the regional level, who is to say where these competitions will end? By
all appearances, [[Russia **does not**]{.mark} **simply [want to
be]{.mark}** [a "**regional power**"]{.mark}]{.underline} (as Obama
cuttingly described it) that dominates South Ossetia and Crimea.37 [[It
**aspires** to]{.mark} the **deep Europe[an]{.mark}** and
**[extra-regional impact]{.mark}** that **previous incarnations** of the
Russian state enjoyed]{.underline}. Why else would Putin boast about how
far his troops can drive into Eastern Europe? [[**Why else** would
Moscow]{.underline}]{.mark} be **[[deploy]{.underline}]{.mark}**ing
military power [[into the **Midd**]{.mark}**le
[East?]{.mark}**]{.underline} [**Why else** would it be continuing to
cultivate]{.underline} intelligence and [**military relationships** in
regions as remote as **Latin America?**]{.underline}

Likewise, [[China]{.mark} is **today** focused primarily on securing its
own **geopolitical neighborhood**, but it[s]{.mark} [ambitions]{.mark}
for **tomorrow** [are]{.mark} **clearly much
[bolde]{.mark}r.**]{.underline} Beijing probably does not envision
itself fully overthrowing the international order, simply because it has
profited far too much from the U.S.-anchored global economy. Yet [China
has nonetheless positioned itself for a **global challenge** to **U.S.
influence**]{.underline}. [[Chinese military forces are deploying **ever
farther**]{.mark} from China's immediate periphery; [Beijing has
**projected power** into the **Arctic** and **established
bases**]{.mark} and **logistical points** [in]{.mark} the
**[India]{.mark}n Ocean** [and]{.mark} **Horn of
[Africa]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Popular Chinese movies depict Beijing
replacing Washington as the dominant actor in sub-Saharan Africa---a
fictional representation of a real-life effort long under way. [The
**Belt and Road Initiative** bespeaks an aspiration to **link** China to
countries throughout **Central Asia, the Middle East, and
Europe**]{.underline}; BRI, AIIB, and RCEP look like the beginning of an
alternative institutional architecture to rival Washington's. In 2017,
[[Xi]{.underline}]{.mark} Jinping [[told the]{.underline}]{.mark}
[Nineteenth National Congress of the [C]{.mark}hinese [C]{.mark}ommunist
[P]{.mark}arty that [Beijing could]{.mark}]{.underline} now "**[[take
center stage]{.mark} in the world]{.underline}**" [[and act as an
**alternative** to **U.S. leadership**]{.underline}]{.mark}.38

These ambitions may or may not be realistic. But they demonstrate just
how significantly the world's leading authoritarian powers desire to
shift the global environment over time. The
**[[revisionism]{.underline}]{.mark}** we are seeing today [[may]{.mark}
therefore [be **only the beginning**]{.mark}]{.underline}. As
[[China]{.mark}'s power **continues to grow,** or if it is successful in
**dominating the Western Pacific**, it [will]{.mark} **surely [move
on]{.mark}** [to **grander endeavors**]{.mark}]{.underline}. If Russia
reconsolidates control over the former Soviet space, it may seek to
bring parts of the former Warsaw Pact to heel. Historically, [this has
been a recurring pattern of **great-power behavior**---interests
**expand with power**, the appetite **grows** with the eating,
**risk-taking** increases as **early gambles** are seen to **pay
off**]{.underline}.39 This pattern is precisely why the revival of
great-power competition is so concerning---because [**[geopolitical
revisionism]{.mark}** by **unsatisfied major powers** [has]{.mark} so
often [presaged **intensifying international
conflict**]{.mark},]{.underline} confrontation,
[[and]{.mark}]{.underline} even **[[war]{.underline}]{.mark}**. The
great-power behavior occurring today represents the warning light
flashing on the dashboard. It tells us there may be still-greater
traumas to come.

The threats today are compelling and urgent, and there may someday come
a time when the balance of power has shifted so markedly that the
postwar international system cannot be sustained. Yet that moment of
failure has not yet arrived, and so the goal of U.S. strategy should be
not to hasten it by giving up prematurely, but to push it off as far
into the future as possible. Rather [than simply
**acquiescing**]{.underline} [in]{.underline} the
**[decline]{.underline}** of a world it spent generations building,
[[America should]{.mark} **aggressively [bolster its
defenses]{.mark}**[,]{.mark} with an eye to **preserving** and perhaps
even selectively **advancing** its remarkable achievements.]{.underline}

### Plan

#### The President of the United States should issue a Presidential Policy Directive to establish a default "no sale" approach for Direct Commercial Sales and Foreign Military Sales of arms from the United States where sales are only authorized if the following three conditions are met: 1) there is a direct threat to American national security; (2) there is no other way to confront that threat other than arming another country; and (3) the United States is the only potential supplier of the necessary arms.

### Solvency

#### The plan dramatically reduces arms sales while still allowing for narrow instances of strategic and limited export agreements

[The United States should reorient its arms sales policy to ensure that
sales provide strategic benefits and to avoid producing negative
unintended consequences. At a practical level, this means **reducing
arms sales dramatically**]{.underline}, especially to nations with high
risk factors for negative outcomes. Officials should look for other ways
to conduct foreign policy in situations where arms sales have been
common tactics --- such as when the United States negotiates access to
military bases or seeks cooperation in the war on terror. [The arms
sales process should also be revised in order to ensure that all sales
receive more thorough scrutiny than has been the case to
date]{.underline}. [To implement this new vision for arms sales we
recommend the following steps]{.underline}: [Issue an Updated
Presidential Policy Directive on Arms Sales]{.underline} --- [Most
importantly, the president should issue a new Presidential Policy
Directive reorienting U.S. arms sales policy so that the new default
policy is "no sale]{.underline}." [The only circumstances in which the
United States should sell or transfer arms to another country are when
three conditions are met: (1) there is a direct threat to American
national security; (2) there is no other way to confront that threat
other than arming another country; and (3) the United States is the only
potential supplier of the necessary weapons. The reasoning behind
this]{.underline} recommendation is [threefold: first]{.underline}, as
noted, [the United States enjoys such a high level of strategic immunity
that there is currently no direct security rationale for arms sales to
any nation. Second, even if one believes that the United States has an
interest in helping other nations defend themselves]{.underline} against
internal enemies (e.g., Iraq, Afghanistan) or external ones (e.g., South
Korea, Taiwan, NATO countries), [there are other ways the United States
can help instead of supplying weapons. Finally, by halting the sales of
weapons the United States will decrease the risk of entanglement in
conflicts that do not directly involve American security]{.underline}.
It will also improve the diplomatic flexibility of the United States to
play the role of honest broker and to exert moral leverage on dueling
parties.

#### US action is key to global modeling -- it is the largest producer 

Andrew **Feinstein, 2012**, The Shadow World: Inside the Global Arms
Trade, p. 531, mm

[While 2010 saw the opening of negotiations on the ATT, it also marked a
high point in revelations of arms trade corruption. The reality is that
there will be no change in the way in which the arms trade operates
unless the biggest producer and consumer of weapons, the USA, is willing
to change]{.underline}. Is it feasible for a President in modern-day
America to lessen the unaccountability, the deception and the iron-like
grip on power and influence that the political, military and economic
interests of the military-industrial-Congressional complex exercise? Or
are we destined to continue living in a world dominated by the interest
of this largely unelected and deeply flawed iron triangle? [During the
course of the twentieth century, the trade in arms made viable and
fueled conflicts that cost the lives of 231 million people]{.underline}.
[The first decade of the twenty-first century has, if anything, been
more violent]{.underline}. [A basic commitment to universal human
rights]{.underline}, equality and justice, to the belief that it is
better to save a life by feeding a hungry stomach than to take a life by
producing another deadly weapon, [demands that this trade, one of the
most destructive and corrupting in human history, cannot be allowed to
continue in its largely unregulated]{.underline}, unscrutinized [current
form]{.underline}.

[This is not to say that unilateral American action will put an end to
the problems of the global arms trade]{.underline}. States would still
seek to ensure their security and survival through deterrence and
military strength. [Other weapons suppliers would]{.underline}, [in the
short run, certainly race to meet the demand]{.underline}. [But history
shows that global nonproliferation treaties and weapons bans typically
require great-power support. In 1969]{.underline}, for example, Richard

offensive-biological-weapons program and seek an international ban on
such weapons]{.underline}. [By 1972 the Biological Weapons Convention

## Instability Adv Extensions

### UQ -- ATI/CAT -- Reduces Oversight 

#### Small arms exports likely to suppress human rights -- most small arms lack congressional oversight.

**Abramson 18** (Jeff Abramson is a non-resident senior fellow for arms
control and conventional arms transfers at the Arms Control Association,
June 2018, "Firearm Export Rule Change Draws Criticism",
<https://www.armscontrol.org/act/2018-06/news/firearm-export-rule-change-draws-criticism>)//FD

With proposed rule changes affecting U.S. firearms exports, the Trump
administration is drawing criticism from domestic gun control advocates
and taking a further step to promote weapons sales, a hallmark of this
presidency. The proposed changes, announced May 14 and published in the
Federal Register on May 24, are open for public comment for 45 days. [If
implemented, licensing for the export of nonautomatic and semiautomatic
firearms and their ammunition will move to the Commerce Department from
the State Department, which administers the U.S. Munitions
List.]{.underline} Critics say the change will loosen U.S. control over
such exports to the benefit of U.S. gun manufacturers. ["Small arms and
light weapons are among the most lethal weapons that we and other
countries export because these are the weapons that are most likely to
be used to commit atrocities and suppress human rights, either by
individuals, nonstate groups, or governmental security and paramilitary
forces," Sen. Ben Cardin (D-Md.) said on May 15]{.underline}. Mike
Miller, acting deputy assistant secretary of state for
political-military affairs, said on May 22 that the change is justified
because the weapons involved are "widely available, generally in retail
outlets." He noted that the categories of firearms moved to Commerce
"will remain subject to export licensing requirements" and asserted that
"these changes do not decontrol export of firearms and ammunition." In
2017 the administration notified Congress of more than \$660 million of
proposed firearms sales regulated under the munitions list, according to
the Security Assistance Monitor. Some of those sales involved fully
automatic weapons that will remain on the Munitions List, making it
difficult to estimate the retail value of items moving to licensing at
Commerce. Nonetheless, many industry groups welcomed the changes.
President Donald Trump has frequently touted the economic benefits of
arms sales. In April, [the administration]{.underline} issued a
conventional arms transfer policy that emphasized the economic value of
the defense industry broadly and [promised the executive branch would
"advocate strongly" on behalf of U.S. companies.]{.underline} (See ACT,
May 2018.) Miller said that "he wouldn't necessarily pin \[the proposed
regulation changes\] directly" to the new conventional arms transfer
policy, but [others including Democratic lawmakers have pointed to gun
manufacturers and their supporters as the driving force behind the
proposed rules. "I encourage the American people and relevant
stakeholders to weigh in with the administration and speak out against
the forces really driving this policy change---the gun lobby," said
Cardin.]{.underline} Local news media in Connecticut and Florida
reported that Sen. Chris Murphy (D-Conn.) and Reps. Elizabeth Esty
(D-Conn.) and Ted Deutch (D-Fla.) also criticized the president for
aligning with gun manufacturers. A number of gun control advocates also
oppose the proposed change, including Robin Lloyd, director of
government affairs at Giffords, the gun safety group founded by former
Rep. Gabrielle Giffords (D-Ariz.) and her husband, retired U.S. Navy
Captain Mark Kelly. "It's clear the administration will do anything to
appease the gun lobby, even if it means putting profits over the safety
of people around the world," Lloyd said[. Efforts to revise the U.S.
Munitions List have been ongoing for decades]{.underline}, but early in
the Obama administration, the Export Control Reform Initiative was
launched, based on a review that found the United States was "trying to
control too much." Seeking to "strengthen the United States' ability to
counter threats such as the proliferation of weapons of mass
destruction," the administration made changes to 18 of the 21 categories
of major weapons and technology controlled under the munitions list,
moving many items to the Commerce Control List, with an idea of building
higher fences around fewer items. [Changes to the first three
categories, which cover close-assault weapons and combat shotguns, guns
and armaments, and their ammunition and ordnance, were considered by the
Obama administration, but never published.]{.underline} The Obama-era
delay can be attributed in part to the frequent national attention drawn
to firearms by mass shootings in the United States and a presidency more
inclined to support gun control efforts. [On May 15, Cardin called the
decision to move forward with changes "politically tone deaf as our
nation reckons with a gun violence epidemic." In September 2017, Cardin,
joined by Sens. Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.) and Patrick Leahy (D-Vt.),
sent a letter to Secretary of State Rex Tillerson expressing concerns
about the possible transfer to Commerce control, pointing to
congressional action in 2002 that required firearms sales valued at \$1
million or more be notified to Congress, a much lower dollar threshold
than for other weapons. Items moved over to Commerce control would no
longer be subject to such notification. With the rule release, Cardin
and others reiterated their concern regarding loss of congressional
oversight and broader worries about how firearms fuel
conflict.]{.underline}

### AT SQ Restrictions Solve

#### Current checks fail -- the US exports arms to almost everyone 

A. Trevor **Thrall and** Caroline **Dorminey**, 6/13/**18**, \[Thrall is
an associate professor at the Schar School of Policy and Government at
George Mason; Dorminey is a policy analyst at the Cato Institute\]Cato
Institute, "a new framework for assessing the risks from US arms sales,"
https://www.cato.org/publications/commentary/new-framework-assessing-risks-us-arms-sales,
mm

[On paper, the United States appears to have a robust procedure in place
to assess arms sales]{.underline}. Since 1976, the Arms Export Control
Act has required that the executive branch conduct a risk assessment for
large government-to-government sales of major conventional weapons
(commercial sales of many small and light weapons are covered by
different rules). Once a foreign government decides it would like to buy
an American system, it submits a letter of request. The request kicks
off an extensive process that runs through a variety of offices at the
Departments of Defense and State, as well as other agencies. The Country
Team Assessment is the American government's official risk assessment
and is intended to determine: how the \[weapon\] will be used, how it
contributes to the defense and security goals of the partner nation and
of the US, how it will change the partner country's military
capabilities, how the partner country will protect and safeguard
sensitive technology, and the partner nation's human rights record. Once
approved, the matter is turned over to Congress, which serves as an
emergency brake for this process. Absent sufficient congressional
opposition in the form of a veto-proof resolution of disapproval, the
sale is made. [In reality, the outcome of this process is almost
inevitably the same: approval]{.underline}. Though the United States
won't sell its latest technology to everyone, [it will sell most things
to just about anyone]{.underline}. Although a full explanation of this
is beyond the scope of our work, [three possible reasons are worth
noting. First, the benefits of arms sales are obvious and immediate,
while the negative consequences are often less obvious, tend to emerge
much later, and often receive little media coverage. Second, there is no
constituency in Washington opposing arms sales]{.underline}. Presidents
see them as a foreign policy tool, Congress sees them as economically
beneficial benefiting its constituents economically, and the defense
industry provides financial encouragement all around through campaign
donations. [Finally, the United States has been the world's leading arms
exporter for so long that the presumption that arms sales work seems to
have become ingrained in the national security bureaucracy]{.underline}.

#### Trump is rolling back export restrictions

Brian **Chang**, 12/20/**17**, Just Security, "by weakening arms export
controls, trump's national security strategy will create national and
global insecurity,"
https://www.justsecurity.org/49873/weakening-arms-export-controls-trumps-national-security-strategy-create-national-global-insecurity/,
mm

[The]{.underline} Trump [Administration's]{.underline} newly launched
National Security Strategy will draw a lot of critiques of Trump's
foreign policy worldview and prescriptions, but not of its implications
for arms control or human rights. One important aspect of the 67-page
strategy document that is unlikely to get the sustained attention it
deserves is how the Trump administration's [proposals to weaken arms
export controls]{.underline} [will lead to national and international
insecurity, and contribute to violations of human rights and
international humanitarian law]{.underline}. The Trump administration's
policy of increasing arms exports and its attempts to rewrite US arms
export regulations and processes, are a scandal that has not received
the attention it deserves in the present news cycle. [Trump's National
Security Strategy could result in the transfer of arms to autocratic
regimes that use them to violate human rights, or the diversion of arms
to actors that might use them against US security forces, or those of US
allies.]{.underline} Individual sales proposals and policy reform
proposals over the past year have been troubling enough, but the
National Security Strategy confirms that these were not exceptions, but
part of a broader policy of encouraging the export of US military
equipment to strengthen the US defense industrial base, which does not
give adequate consideration to potential impacts on human rights or
national and international security. In the first 11 months of 2017, the
Trump administration notified Congress of arms transfers valued at
\$80.7 billion, which is almost double the amount the Obama
administration sold in the same period in 2016 (\$58.6b). This included
approvals of arms transfers that the Obama administration had previously
blocked on human rights grounds after much effort by advocacy groups
such as Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch. Military aircraft
and bombs have been sold to air forces that face credible allegations of
unnecessarily bombing civilians, including Saudi Arabia, Bahrain and
Nigeria. The Trump administration has also proposed to or has already
sold guns to countries with problematic human rights records including
Mexico, Honduras, El Salvador, Turkey, the UAE, Bahrain, Saudi Arabia
and the Philippines. Very few of these irresponsible arms deals have
received widespread public attention or pushback. Given the Trump
administration's stated National Security Strategy of encouraging arms
exports and weakening export controls, these sales are likely to be the
mere first rumblings of an avalanche of arms sales to rogue actors and
human rights violators. Too little attention has been focused on the
Trump administration's review of US arms export controls, which is
primarily focused on promoting the competitiveness of the US defense
industry by "removing unreasonable constraints on the ability of \[US\]
companies to compete," according to National Security Council (NSC)
sources. Another justification for the review is to "strengthen the
defense capabilities of US allies" which is driven by the desire to
create "high-quality American jobs," although arms control advocates
have shown that investments in defense creates less jobs than
investments in health care, clean energy, education or even tax cuts.
Although the NSC pays lip service to the importance of ensuring that
arms export controls are not removed at the expense of US foreign policy
interests, the review is clearly supported by lobbyists for the defense
industry and gun manufacturers. Trump has also personally linked arms
sales with trade imbalances, most recently signaling to Vietnam that he
wants them to buy more US arms to reduce the US.-Vietnam trade deficit.
[The Trump administration's review of US arms export controls includes
proposals to weaken specific export controls over a diverse array of
weaponry ranging from small arms to drones]{.underline}. In short, the
Trump administration intends to change export regulations so that gun
manufacturers can export without adequate background checks on the
countries or security forces purchasing them, even as we mourn the
victims of gun violence linked to the inadequacy of background checks
here in the US. It has been reported that [the]{.underline} Trump
[administration intends to shift some gun and small arms sales from the
US Munitions List to the Commerce Control List]{.underline} soon, with
reports indicating that the administration is close to finalizing
proposed new rules. Although advocacy and reporting on this proposal
have been hindered by a lack of transparency, this has not stopped a
small group of dedicated arms control advocates from highlighting that
the anticipated changes are likely to remove Congressional notification
requirements for arms sales, remove State Department oversight that
ensures these exports take into account national security, foreign
policy and human rights considerations, and ultimately make it much
easier for small arms manufacturers to obtain licenses to sell abroad,
with less accountability if the guns end up in the wrong hands. Of
arguably greater concern than the rollbacks of individual export
controls described above, the [Trump]{.underline} administration [has
signaled its intent to revise]{.underline} the International Traffic in
Arms Regulations ([ITAR]{.underline}), the principal, overarching
regulation governing arms exports. While public details remain scarce,
pro-arms export officials from the NSC and State Department are
emphasizing "export competitiveness" as the principal motive behind the
review, a motive confirmed by the National Security Strategy. Arms
control advocates are particularly concerned that the result of this
rewrite could be that vetting criteria mandating consideration of human
rights concerns will be eliminated and replaced with vetting criteria
emphasizing the desirability of arms exports. [The consequences of
poorly regulated arms flows are devastating, with tens of thousands of
people dying each year due to the widespread availability of weapons on
black markets.]{.underline} In Iraq alone, poorly regulated US arms
transfers ended up providing ISIS with the weapons to commit mass
atrocities in Iraq and Syria, while also supplying paramilitary militias
with the weapons to abduct, "disappear," torture and execute thousands
of mainly Sunni men and boys. US-made weapons are also being used to
enforce the Saudi-led siege of Yemen, where thousands of civilians are
being needlessly starved and bombed, in flagrant disregard of
international and US arms export control law. The Trump administration
should be fighting to end the bloodshed in Yemen and US complicity in
human rights violations by threatening to end arms sales to members of
the Saudi-led coalition, rather than threatening to weaken human rights
provisions in the oversight of arms exports.

### Link -- Arms Sales -\> Instability/War

#### Trump's CAT eliminates oversight and increases SALW exports -- that fuels global conflcits 

William **Hartung**, 7/15/**18**, The Hill, "Trump's arms export rules
will undermine US security and risk human rights abuses,"
https://thehill.com/opinion/international/397096-trumps-arms-export-rules-will-undermine-us-security-promote-human,
mm

[One major flaw in the new plan is that it would eliminate notifications
to Congress of exports of firearms and related equipment worth \$1
million or more]{.underline}. Statistics gathered by the Security
Assistance Monitor have documented that the State Department approved
\$662 million worth of firearms exports to 15 countries in 2017,
including to places like Mexico, Honduras, El Salvador, the Philippines,
the United Arab Emirates and Turkey where [there is a risk that these
weapons will be used to abuse human rights, fall into the hands of
criminal gangs, or fuel devastating conflicts]{.underline} like the
Saudi/UAE-led intervention in Yemen. Absent notification, Congress and
the public would have little ability to debate, much less block, any of
these problematic exports. The administration rule has tried to obscure
the true danger of its approach by suggesting that the bulk of the guns
that are being removed from State Department oversight and licensing are
commercially available. For many of the firearms being deregulated, this
claim is dubious. More importantly, many of the guns involved are
military-grade, including sniper rifles. Others, like the AR-15, have
been used in tragic incidents of gun violence such as the Parkland,
Florida school shootings. Finally, in some cases, as with sniper rifles,
these weapons could end up being used against U.S. troops involved in
overseas operations. The Violence Policy Center has compiled a lengthy
list of military firearms and other especially dangerous weapons that
would be subjected to far looser restrictions under the proposed
administration plan. [The firearms slated for deregulation are the
primary tools in many of the world's most deadly conflicts, and have
rightly been described as "**slow motion weapons of mass
destruction**."]{.underline} They should be subjected to more rigorous
scrutiny, not less. In addition, the proposed rule would make it easier
for private military contractors like the firm formerly known as
Blackwater to train foreign security forces without a license, even for
destinations like Libya and China that raise significant security
concerns. In another particularly unwise change, many companies that
engage in firearms manufacturing would no longer have to register with
the State Department, which will make it much harder to track their
activities and prevent illegal sales or exports to security forces or
non-state groups that will use the weapons they make to do grievous harm
to civilians. This relaxation of the monitoring of manufacturing
activities will apparently extend to open source 3-D printing, meaning
that anyone could post non-proprietary instructions for to use this
process to produce untraceable hand guns and semi-automatic firearms
without have to register with State or seek an export license from
Commerce. T[his will be an invitation to arms proliferation on a scale
not yet seen]{.underline}. Congress should address the 3-D printing
issue alongside efforts to block the Trump administration's proposed
changes in firearms export regulations. The proposal would also lift the
obligation of U.S. arms exporting firms to report political
contributions to foreign officials and fees paid to marketing agents in
potential recipient countries. This would seriously hinder U.S. law
enforcement agencies' ability to root out corruption and illegal
transfers, which have long plagued the global trade in small arms and
light weapons. Last but certainly not least, taking dangerous firearms
off of the U.S. Munitions List, as the new proposal would do, would mean
that they are no longer described as "defense articles." As a result,
they would likely fall outside the jurisdiction of a web of carefully
constructed laws that impose specific human rights criteria on the
export of such weapons. [The concerns outlined here underscore the risks
inherent in the Trump administration's firearms deregulation scheme. The
bottom line is that implementing these rules]{.underline} as written
[would lead to additional unnecessary deaths, bolster repressive
regimes, and make it easier for terrorists and criminal gangs to inflict
violence on innocent individuals]{.underline}. For all of these reasons,
the new rule should be rejected. At a minimum, Congress should move to
restore the most important elements of the current regulatory scheme,
including notification of major firearms exports and limits on the
deregulation of military-grade firearms and guns most likely to be used
in mass killings.

#### The US regularly exports weapons to countries engaged in conflicts -- key source of instability 

**CIVIC and the Stimson Center**, 1/10/**18**, \[This report is a joint
initiative of the Center for Civilians in Conflict and the Stimson
Center\], "With Great Power: Modifying US Arms Sales to Reduce Civilian
Harm,"
https://www.stimson.org/sites/default/files/file-attachments/ArmsSales_WithGreatPower_FINAL.pdf,
mm

The global arms trade reached an estimated total value of \$91.3 billion
in 2015 (the last year when complete data was available).1 While [the
United States]{.underline} is not the only country that sells
conventional arms through government-to-government and commercial
transactions, it [holds an unrivaled dominance measured in global market
share]{.underline}. According to the Stockholm International Peace
Research Institute (SIPRI), the total value of international US arms
exports delivered in 2016 was close to \$10 billion, or 29 percent of
the total global export market.2 The US has maintained an average of 33
percent market share in international arms exports between 2011 and
2015, followed most closely by Russia (25 percent) and China (5.9
percent).3 These figures do not include transfer agreements, estimated
at \$40.2 billion, or over 50% of the global total, when last measured
in 2015.4 All reporting indicates that the US will remain the market
leader in 2017.5 [Of the 82 countries]{.underline}
[identified]{.underline} by the Uppsala Conflict Data Program [as a
party or secondary party to an armed conflict in 2016]{.underline}, [the
US delivered]{.underline} [major]{.underline} [military
items]{.underline} (measured in Foreign Military Sales) [to at least 62
of them]{.underline}; in 34 countries where conflict took place, the US
delivered arms in 27.6 Meanwhile, in 2016, armed conflict in as many as
34 countries killed an estimated 102,000 people and caused an
unquantified level of damage to civilian infrastructure, including
homes, schools, and hospitals.8 Although no single weapon or technology
caused this level of death and destruction, [the global arms trade has a
direct bearing on the effects of war on civilians]{.underline}. In the
2017 United Nations report on the Protection of Civilians in Armed
Conflict, the UN Secretary-General called specific attention to the
relationship between arms proliferation and human suffering in war,
noting that "high levels of arms and ammunition in circulation, combined
with poor controls on them, contribute to insecurity and facilitate
violations of international humanitarian and human rights law."9
Research by the International Committee for the Red Cross (ICRC)
confirms that "[when conventional arms]{.underline} are poorly regulated
and widely available, the humanitarian consequences are grim: violations
of international humanitarian law and human rights law, restricted
medical and humanitarian assistance, prolonged armed conflicts, and high
levels of armed violence and insecurity\...even after wars have
ended."10 Of mounting concern are the effects of explosive weapons used
in urban areas, as seen in recent military campaigns in Iraq and Syria.
According to data collected by Action on Armed Violence, civilians
represent approximately 92 percent of those reported killed and injured
when security forces employ explosive weapons in populated areas.11
Analysts estimate that explosive weapons led to the death of 32,000
civilians in 2016 alone.12 While improvised explosives caused much of
this damage, civilians also suffered the effects of commercially
available "smart" and "dumb" bombs, missiles, and mortars that were
dropped, launched, or shot from the ground, air, and sea. In addition to
civilian deaths and injuries, these weapons cause high levels of forced
displacement and critical damage to essential civilian infrastructure,
including hospitals, sanitation systems, and transportation systems
essential for food security. [With its outsized influence on the trade
and use of arms worldwide, the US has the ability, the opportunity, and
the responsibility to shape the arms trade to reduce harm to
civilians]{.underline}. Moreover, ensuring that US-made and -sold
weapons are deployed as intended, within the bounds of international
humanitarian and human rights law, is also a core US national security
interest. The 2014 US Conventional Arms Transfer Policy, enshrining 20
years of bipartisan policy on arms transfers13 recalls that, "In the
hands of hostile or irresponsible state and non-state actors ... weapons
can exacerbate international tensions, foster instability, inflict
substantial damage, enable transnational organized crime, and be used to
violate universal human rights."14

#### Small arms and light weapons magnify the link -- responsible for half of all violent deaths each year 

William **Hartung**, 8/15/**18**, Informed Consent, "How trump is
turning US diplomats into arms merchants to the world,"
https://www.juancole.com/2018/08/turning-diplomats-merchants.html, mm

Yes, those massive sales of tanks, helicopters, and fighter aircraft are
indeed a grim wonder of the modern world and never receive the attention
they truly deserve. However, a potentially deadlier aspect of the U.S.
weapons trade receives even less attention than the sale of big-ticket
items: the export of firearms, ammunition, and related equipment.
[Global arms control advocates have termed]{.underline} such [small arms
and light weaponry]{.underline} --- rifles, automatic and semi-automatic
weapons, and handguns --- "[slow motion weapons of mass destruction"
because they're the weapons of choice in the majority of the 40 armed
conflicts now underway around the world. They]{.underline} and they
alone [have been responsible for nearly half of the roughly 200,000
violent deaths]{.underline} by weapon that have been [occurring
annually]{.underline} both in and outside of official war zones. And the
[Trump]{.underline} administration [is]{.underline} now [moving to make
it far easier for U.S. gun makers to push such wares around the
world]{.underline}. Consider it an irony, if you will, but in doing so,
the president who has staked his reputation on rejecting everything that
seems to him tainted by Barack Obama is elaborating on a proposal
originally developed in the Obama years. The crucial element in the new
plan: to move key decisions on whether or not to export guns and
ammunition abroad from the State Department's jurisdiction, where they
would be vetted on both human rights and national security grounds, to
the Commerce Department, whose primary mission is promoting national
exports. The Violence Policy Center, a research and advocacy
organization that seeks to limit gun deaths, has indicated that such a
move would ease the way for more exports of a long list of firearms.
Those would include sniper rifles and AR-15s, the now-classic weapon in
U.S. mass killings like the school shootings in Parkland, Florida, and
Newtown, Connecticut. Under the new plan, the careful tracking of whose
hands such gun exports could end up in will be yesterday's news and, [as
a result, U.S. weapons are likely to become far more accessible to armed
gangs, drug cartels, and terrorist operatives.]{.underline} President
[Trump's plan would even eliminate the requirement that Congress be
notified in advance of major firearms deals]{.underline}, which would
undoubtedly prove to be the arms loophole of all time. According to
statistics gathered by the Security Assistance Monitor, which gathers
comprehensive information on U.S. military and police aid programs, the
State Department approved \$662 million worth of firearms exports to 15
countries in 2017. The elimination of Congressional notifications and
the other proposed changes will mean that countries like Mexico, the
Philippines, Turkey, and the United Arab Emirates, as well as various
Central American nations, will have far easier access to a far wider
range of U.S. firearms with far less Congressional oversight. [And that,
in turn, means that U.S.-supplied weapons will play even more crucial
roles in vicious civil wars]{.underline} like the one in Yemen and are
far more likely to make their way into the hands of local thugs, death
squads, and drug cartels. And mind you, it [isn't as if U.S. gun export
policies were enlightened before the Trump era. They were already
wreaking havoc in neighboring countries.]{.underline} According to a
report from the Center for American Progress, an astonishing 50,000 U.S.
guns were recovered in criminal investigations in 15 Western Hemisphere
nations between 2014 and 2016. That report goes on to note that 70% of
the guns recovered from crimes in Mexico are of U.S. origin. The
comparable figures for Central America are 49% for El Salvador, 46% for
Honduras, and 29% for Guatemala.

Finally, Trump's claims about the economic benefits of arms sales ring
the [hollowest of
all](https://www.thenation.com/article/pentagon-spending-is-a-poor-job-creator/).
For starters, not only won't arms sales create a million new American
jobs, but a great number of the jobs created by arms sales will go to
citizens of the purchasing nations. As the Security Assistance Monitor
[report](https://securityassistance.org/publication/trends-major-us-arms-sales-2018-trump-record-rhetoric-versus-reality)
notes, the number of licenses granted to weapons manufacturers outside
the United States doubled from 2017 to 2018. As a result, more than
one-quarter of all U.S. arms "sales" last year were deals to permit the
manufacturing of U.S.-designed weapons under license --- that is, they
created jobs in other nations instead of the United States. The report
also finds that the Trump administration has sharply increased the
number of deals in which foreign countries produce U.S.-developed
weaponry under coproduction agreements, further reducing the number of
U.S. jobs tied to arms sales. Weakening the economic rationale even
further is the fact that in order to seal major deals, American defense
contractors have to [offer massive discounts](https://i/), or offsets,
to the purchasing nations in the form of coproduction arrangements or
technology transfer. In 2014, for example, these offsets equaled roughly
one-third of the value of total U.S. arms sales. These offsets mean not
only that American arms sales are less profitable than they appear on
paper, but also that they lead to fewer jobs created in the United
States than many, including the president, would like to think. Trump's
big Saudi arms deal, for example, would likely lead to somewhere between
20,000 and 40,000 jobs, or less than two-tenths of one percent of the
American labor market. The unpleasant truth is that the underwhelming
economic benefits cannot justify Washington's love of arms sales. [Arms
sales simply do not benefit the U.S]{.underline}. economy [nearly as
much as Trump likes to claim]{.underline}. [Meanwhile, a large
percentage of American arms sales goes to countries with horrible human
rights records, to nations where arms are at risk of finding their way
into the wrong hands, and to nations embroiled in dangerous and
destabilizing conflicts. Given this, **it is long past time to rethink
American arms sales policy**.]{.underline}

#### Exports cause instability -- weapons each terrorists, criminal and corrupt governments

mm

U.S. President Donald [Trump's]{.underline} "Buy American" agenda is
taking a potentially deadly turn, with the administration expected to
issue new [regulations]{.underline} that [would make it easier
for]{.underline} U.S. [firearms]{.underline} and related ammunition [to
reach terrorists, criminal organizations and corrupt and abusive foreign
security forces]{.underline}. [The]{.underline} Trump administration's
proposed [regulations would]{.underline} likely [transfer responsibility
for reviewing licenses to export certain types of weapons]{.underline}
--- including assault-style rifles and pistols and armor-piercing sniper
rifles --- [from]{.underline} the [State]{.underline} Department [to the
Commerce Department]{.underline}. Although not as eye catching as an
F-35, [these small arms are]{.underline} often called "[the real weapons
of mass destruction]{.underline}." [Responsible for up to 1,000 deaths a
day, these weapons also threaten U.S. service members around the
world.]{.underline} The proposal has raised significant concerns,
including from U.S. law enforcement agencies that have fiercely opposed
the transfer of these items because of the increased risk that they may
land in the hands of unintended end users. [There are five key dangers
of shifting oversight of firearms exports to the Commerce
Department.]{.underline} [First, there is an increased risk of exports
to unauthorized end users and conflict zones.]{.underline} Under the
Commerce Department system, companies can generally use several broad
license exemptions to export military equipment without U.S. government
approval. When the U.S. government shifts oversight of firearms exports
to companies, it loses the ability to identify key warning signs,
including risky middlemen, unusual routes and mismatched weapons
systems, of a possible diversion of U.S. guns to terrorists, criminals
or conflict zones. Without U.S. oversight, the government also couldn't
stop the sale of firearms to foreign security force units accused of
serious human rights violations or corruption. [Second, a shift to the
Commerce Department could compromise the United States' ability to
investigate and prosecute arms smugglers]{.underline}. The Trump
administration's proposal would likely eliminate the current requirement
that individuals receive government approval before attempting to broker
a deal to non-NATO countries for firearms controlled by the Commerce
Department. The proposal might also remove the requirement that
companies first register with the U.S. government before engaging in
arms exports, which U.S. law enforcement has used to build
investigations against illegal arms traffickers. Furthermore, the
proposal could create greater legal ambiguity about restrictions on
firearms exports and, thus, impede U.S. law enforcement's efforts to
prosecute cases of illegal arms trafficking. Indeed, if an arms exporter
can show that a reasonable person would be confused by U.S. regulations,
the illegal exporter could escape prosecution. [Third, the proposal
risks losing key legal restrictions on dangerous arms
transfers.]{.underline} Commerce Department regulations, unlike the
State Department's, are not tied to all federal laws that regulate
security assistance, including the commercial export of defense articles
to foreign governments that support terrorism, violate internationally
recognized human rights norms or interfere with humanitarian operations
as well as country-specific controls imposed on nations of concern, such
as China. A shift to the Commerce Department would likely complicate, if
not end, State Department reviews of a recipient\'s human rights
violations, as the State Department bureau in charge of human rights may
face greater difficulties in pressing for restraint on risky firearms
exports. Such a shift would thereby dilute the State Department's
ability to prevent high-risk transfers. [Fourth, the Trump proposal
risks eroding global norms on firearms exports]{.underline}. Over the
past two decades, through bilateral and multilateral agreements, the
United States has successfully encouraged governments around the world
to adopt better laws and policies to stop irresponsible and illegal arms
transfers. Many of these agreements note the need to review export
licenses on a case-by-case basis, highlight the importance of brokering
registration and licensing and contain other key controls. If the United
States decides to reduce or remove some of these controls, many other
countries may choose to do so as well, particularly if it allows them to
better compete with the United States. [Finally, a shift would likely
result in less transparency in arms sales]{.underline}. The proposal
could eliminate both Congress's and the public's view of U.S. firearms
sales authorizations and deliveries around the world because the
Commerce Department's annual reports cover only about 20 countries.
Furthermore, there are no public end-use reports on arms exports
authorized by the Commerce Department such as those for exports
authorized by the State Department. The reports are useful to identify
key trafficking patterns that can help avoid risky arms transfers.
Although the Commerce Department maintains a regulatory process for
exports, its oversight is notoriously less robust than the State
Department's. Indeed, Congress has limited the executive branch's
authority to transfer military equipment to the Commerce Department to
only those articles that do not have "substantial military utility."
[While firearms might not appear to hold the destructive power of many
other conventional weapons systems, their potential impact can be
devastating. As such, they deserve greater, not less, scrutiny when
making export decisions]{.underline}.

### I/L -- Blowback

#### Arms exports trigger instability through blowback 

**Holden**, Paul. **2017**, Indefensible : Seven Myths that Sustain the
Global Arms Trade, Zed Books, p. 58-64, mm

[The first]{.underline} and probably best known [way]{.underline} in
which [arms get into the wrong hands is through]{.underline} what is
known as '[blowback']{.underline}: when a onetime ally to whom you have
provided weapons becomes an enemy. With that switch, enemies are able to
turn the weapons supplied against their one-time ally turned enemy.
[There are many examples]{.underline} of blowback, [but none is more
obvious]{.underline} [than]{.underline} the serious mess that has been
the US involvement in [Iraq and Afghanistan]{.underline}. In the early
1980s, Iraq, under the dictatorial leadership of Saddam Hussein,
launched a war against Iran. Iran had recently undergone a revolution
that had replaced the Shah of Iran (a long-time US and European ally,
despite his dictatorial rule) with a religious clique, the Ayatollahs,
that promised to convert Iran to Muslim orthodoxy. Iran declared the US
'enemy number one'. While the US was not above supplying weapons to Iran
(the Iran-Contra affair exposed how the US had set up an enterprise to
supply arms to Iran to secure the release of hostages and fund
right-wing paramilitaries in Nicaragua 1 ), it generally tilted its
support towards Iraq. This support was both financial and material. In
1989, FBI agents raided the Atlanta offices of the Italian Banca
Nazionale del Lavoro (BNL), based on a tip-off from two insiders. 2 It
soon emerged that the bank had been systematically supplying loans to
the regime of Saddam Hussein. Representative Henry B. Gonzalez, tasked
with investigating the matter, revealed that BNL had been Iraq's largest
source of loans from 1985 to 1989. This was done with the complicity of
the CIA and Washington. Remarkably, the loans had been guaranteed under
the cover of the Commodity Credit Corporation, a US government
agricultural loan facility. When Iraq defaulted on the loans, it was the
US taxpayer that paid the bill. 3 The loans that had been granted to
Saddam Hussein fueled an enormous program to buy weapons, mostly from
European suppliers, which was supported and aided by the CIA and
Washington; the program was given legal force by a National Security
Decision Directive (NSDD) signed by Ronald Reagan that stated it was US
policy to ensure Iraq won the war with Iran. Howard Teicher, a member of
the US National Security Council in charge of Political-Military Affairs
from 1982 to 1987 revealed in an affidavit that in 1995, Pursuant to the
secret NSDD, the United States actively supported the Iraqi war effort
by supplying the Iraqis with billions of dollars of credits, by
providing US military intelli­ gence and advice to the Iraqis, and by
closely monitoring third country arms sales to Iraq to make sure that
Iraq had the military weaponry required. 4 Between 1979 and 1985, when
reliable data ceases, Iraq increased its expenditure on weapons from
6.9% of its GDP to 27.5%. 5 During the early 1980s, Iraq became the
world's biggest importer of major weapons systems, only falling behind
India in 1986 and 1987. The Stockholm Peace Research Institute could
identify twenty-six different countries supplying weapons to Iraq at the
time. 6 The two largest suppliers of Iraq's major weapons systems during
the Iran‒ Iraq war were France (accounting for 28%) and the Soviet Union
(47%). 7 Thus, with direct funding from Washington, not only was Saddam
Hussein getting his hands on buckets of weapons, but he was buying a
good portion of them from the US' Cold War enemy, the USSR. A unilateral
US arms embargo placed on Iraq during the war meant that the US could
not supply weapons directly (hence the convoluted system described
above). But it made every effort to ensure that Iraq could import as
many 'dual-use' items from the US as possible. 'Dual-use' items are
items that have both military and civilian applications. Included in the
designation of 'dual-use' items were biological materials that could be
used in chemical and biological warfare. In the early 1990s, the US
Senate Committee on Banking, Housing and Urban Affairs released a report
confirming that The United States provided the Government of Iraq with
'dual use' licensed materials which assisted in the development of Iraqi
chemical, biological and missile-system programs, including: chemical
warfare agent precursors, chemical war­ fare agent production facility
plans and technical drawings (provided as pesticide production facility
plans); chemical warhead filling equipment; biological warfare related
materials; missile fabrication equipment; and, missile-system guidance
equipment. 8 The list of biological material the US provided was
shocking, including anthrax, botulinium, E.Coli as well as human and
bacterial DNA. 9 There is credible evidence that when the US invaded
Iraq in 1991, US troops were exposed to the very agents that the US had
supplied, over and above fighting against the weapons whose acquisition
the US had helped to fund and arrange. 10 In the aftermath of the fall
of Saddam Hussein, the world was witness to another type of blowback:
namely, when an ally is provided arms but fails to stop those arms being
stolen by enemies. Between 2003 and 2014, Iraq received weapons to the
equivalent value of \$4.115bn (not all of which were bought: many of the
weapons that were delivered took the form of aid transfers); of which
\$2.487bn, or more than 50%, came from the US. 11 Amongst the items
delivered are armored personnel carriers, military helicopters,
transport aircraft, anti-tank missiles, tanks, artillery and drones. 12
Between 2006 and 2009, for example, SIPRI reports that the US handed the
Iraqi army 8,500 advanced armored personnel carriers. 13 These figures
also ignore the mountains of light weapons imported into the country;
between 2003 and 2008, the US supplied over 1 million small arms (rifles
and handguns) to the Iraqi military and police, 360,000 of which simply
went missing. 14 The story comes full circle in 2014: blowback in the
form of the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIS -- also sometimes
referred to as ISIL or Daesh). Since 2013, ISIS, a hardline Islamist
militant group that has attracted global approbation for its brutal
tactics--- including mass executions of captured minority groups and
beheadings of journalists--- has gained control of significant portions
of Iraq and Syria. Originally armed with weapons sourced from an overly
well-stocked region, with Syrian and Iraqi stores particularly lucrative
sources, ISIS has overrun much of the northern quadrant of Iraq
bordering Kurdistan. 15 The Iraqi army, which was supposed to have been
well trained and armed, melted in the face of the ISIS onslaught;
illustrating yet again that no amount of material and technical training
can fix that which is badly governed. These military successes, in
particular the capture of Iraq's second city of Mosul, allowed ISIS to
acquire even more significant stockpiles of weapons, creating a feedback
loop in which ISIS uses existing weapons to acquire even more, some of
which had been provided to the Iraqi army by the US. 16 The size of the
seizures has been astonishing: a 2014 UN Security Council Report noted
that in June 2014 alone ISIS seized sufficient Iraqi government stocks
from the provinces of Anbar and Salah al-Din to arm and equip more than
three Iraqi conventional army divisions. 17 Reviewing the evidence, the
same report provided a chilling summary of the range of weapons ISIS has
at its disposal: From social media and other reporting, it is clear that
ISIL assets include light weapons, assault rifles, machine guns, heavy
weapons, including possible man-portable air defense systems (MANPADS)
(SA-7), field and anti-aircraft guns, missiles, rockets, rocket
launchers, artillery, aircraft, tanks (including T-55s and T-72s) and
vehicles, including high-mobility multi­ purpose military vehicles. 18
Hundreds of millions of dollars of weapons they use have been
instrumental in their rapid advance. 19 This is particularly true of
military infantry fighting vehicles--- Humvees and mine-protected
vehicles--- and long-range howitzers that inflict frightening damage on
civilian populations. When the US recently launched airstrikes against
ISIS fighters who had surrounded tens of thousands of civilians on a
barren mountainside, it was largely targeting weapons (in particular
mortars) that the US had itself made available in the region. The
seizure of US weapons, which ISIS mixes with arms acquired via other
means elsewhere (often smuggled in through routes that traverse Turkey
20 ), has not only further destabilized Iraq, but fed further violence
and devastation into the deadly Syrian conflict. Recent media reports
indicate that some of the US-seized weapons and armor--- Humvees in
particular--- have been seen in the hands of ISIS near Aleppo: a full
200 miles outside of Iraq. 21 [In a region where tensions are rife,
where violence is endemic and a peaceful solution a long way off, and
where predicting the political future is almost impossible, there
remains one constant: if people want to fight wars, they have more than
enough arms to do so for the foreseeable future.]{.underline} Indeed, in
2014 the London-based Conflict Armament Research published a report
based on spent ammunition found in ISIS-controlled areas. It found that
ISIS had been using ammunition from at least twenty-one different
countries manufactured over seventy years. Nearly 20% of the ammunition
discovered was supplied by the US in the 2000s. 22 There is, of course,
a caveat: after a while, the seized weapons systems will cease to be
functional without maintenance and a ready supply of spares. [It seems
obvious that this requires the US,]{.underline} in particular, [to put
in place stringent measures to stop such spares finding their way to
fighters whose stated aim is to attack US interests throughout the
region]{.underline}. [And yet]{.underline}, as we have seen in the last
chapter, [the US is now doing the exact opposite by radically revising
and liberalizing its Munitions Control list.]{.underline} Whether or not
this leads to further blowback is unclear, but, considering the past,
shouldn't the emphasis be on caution rather than profits?

and other [weapons]{.underline}, an arsenal that [Iran has used to exert
itself ever since]{.underline}. A more common example is when [American
troops end up fighting other forces armed with American-made weapons

in [Somalia in
1991](https://www.csmonitor.com/1992/1014/14012.html)]{.underline} with
weapons provided during the Cold War. Arms sales and transfers can also
harm the regions into which American weapons flow. Another danger is
dispersion --- when [weapons sold to a foreign government end up in the
hands of criminal groups or adversaries.]{.underline} This risk is
highest with sales or transfers to fragile states that are unprepared,
unwilling, or too corrupt to protect their stockpiles adequately. For
instance, despite America's efforts to train and equip the Iraqi army,
ISIL fighters in 2014 captured [three Iraqi army
divisions'](https://www.amnesty.org/en/documents/mde14/2812/2015/en/)
worth of American equipment, including tanks, armored vehicles, and
infantry weapons. American arms sales can also prolong and intensify
interstate conflicts[.]{.underline} Although the goal might be to alter
the military balance of a conflict to facilitate a speedy end, [sending
weapons can also encourage the recipients to continue
fighting]{.underline} even [with no chance of success, leading to more
casualties]{.underline}. Finally, [U.S. weapons sales]{.underline} in
the name of battling terrorism and insurgency [undermine U.S. national
security when they are made to corrupt regimes]{.underline} and to
nations with a history of human right violations. [American firepower
can enhance regime security and enable oppressive
governments]{.underline} to mistreat minority groups and wage inhumane
actions against insurgents or terrorist groups. Currently, Saudi Arabia
is waging war in Yemen using primarily [American
weapons](https://www.al-monitor.com/pulse/originals/2018/03/yemen-us-weapons-saudi-arabia-uae.html),
which the United States has continued to provide even though the Saudis
have been [cited
repeatedly](https://www.hrw.org/news/2017/09/12/yemen-coalition-airstrikes-deadly-children)
for human rights violations and targeting civilian populations. In
countries where serious corruption is endemic, American weapons can be
diverted from their intended recipients and wind up in the wrong hands.

arms and light weapons]{.underline} that the [United States sends
to]{.underline} Mexico and to several other [Latin American countries in

the very crimes they were meant to stop.]{.underline}

### I/L -- Refugee Flows

#### Arms sales fuel conflicts and refugee flows -- the U.S. is uniquely responsible 

William **Hartung**, 4/17/**18**, Medium, "how war and weapons trading
are fueling the global refugee crisis,"
https://medium.com/@williamhartung55/how-war-and-weapons-trading-are-fueling-the-global-refugee-crisis-1132c31cf1f3,
mm

Few would argue that [the world faces a refugee crisis, but not nearly
enough is being done to prevent the creation of new
refugees]{.underline} or to help those already displaced from their
homes. And while statistics can't fully capture the human suffering
involved, it is sobering to learn that the United Nations reports that
over 20 million people have been driven from their countries by war,
famine, and poverty, with over 40 million more displaced within their
own nations. There is no science involved in figuring out which factors
have the most impact on creating the massive flow of refugees that
characterize our world, but one thing is clear --- [war is a major
driver of this humanitarian catastrophe]{.underline}. According to the
most recent report by the United Nations refugee agency, more than half
of the world's refugees come from three countries that have been the
sites of brutal, multi-year conflicts --- Syria, Afghanistan, and South
Sudan. War is a direct cause of displacement, but it also increases the
risks of famine and disease, which also play a major role in driving
people from their home communities. There is plenty of blame to go
around for this dismal state of affairs, from the role of Russia and
Iran in propping up the murderous Assad regime in Syria, to internal
factions in South Sudan, to the Taliban and the U.S.-backed government
in Afghanistan. But this article will focus on the role of the United
States, not because it is the worst or only culprit, but because there
is --- or should be --- a better chance at changing misguided policies
in a democracy than there is in undemocratic regimes. The United States
is currently involved in eight wars --- in Iraq, Syria, Libya, Somalia,
Niger, Yemen, Afghanistan, and Pakistan. Together, these conflicts have
generated millions of refugees, and displaced millions more within their
home countries. U.S. military intervention isn't necessarily the primary
cause of the refugee flow in all cases, but it has generally made
matters worse --- in some cases much worse. If the United States wants
to make a constructive contribution to stemming worldwide refugee flows,
we need to rethink our all-war-all-the-time foreign policy. So far,
Donald Trump hasn't started any new wars, but his administration has
doubled down on the wars he inherited, dropping more bombs, launching
more drone strikes, and causing more civilian casualties. We can only
hope that Trump and his new "war cabinet" of John Bolton and Mike Pompeo
(yet to be confirmed as Trump's Secretary of State) don't get us
involved in yet another conflict, in Iran, North Korea, or elsewhere.
The recent U.S., French, and U.K. cruise missile strikes on Syria are a
case in point of what's wrong with the current foreign policies of the
United States and its allies. The Assad regime's chemical attacks on its
own population are horrific, but raining more bombs on Syria --- however
accurate the strikes may or may not be --- is no solution to the
suffering of the Syrian people. But there was a groundswell of support
in the media and some segments of the public to "do something" about
Assad's attack. And as Emma Ashford of the Cato Institute noted in an
op-ed in the New York Times, all too often "doing something" is defined
narrowly to mean taking military action. According to this militarized
logic, diplomacy --- which is practically a dirty word in Trump World
--- doesn't count. This is odd given the utter failure of the United
States' post-9/11 wars to achieve their stated objectives, but old, bad
ideas die hard. If President Trump were truly concerned with the fate of
the Syrian people, there are a number of non-military steps that would
do far more to help them than lobbing yet more bombs and missiles at
their country. For starters, he could agree to admit significant numbers
of Syrian refugees into the United States, rather than blocking
virtually all of them --- according to a recent report on NPR, the Trump
administration has let in a grand total of 11 Syrian refugees this year.
The United States could also increase its funding for U.N. humanitarian
efforts on behalf of refugees. There's plenty of money to be had if the
administration chose to spend even a little bit less on the Pentagon and
related agencies, which will receive \$700 billion this year, and more
on non-military tools of foreign policy. [The global arms trade is on
the rise, and the United States is by far the dominant
supplier]{.underline}, as has been the case for 25 of the last 26 years.
[And the United States has supplied weapons to over 60 countries
involved in conflicts]{.underline} large and small. Even more impressive
--- if that's the right word for it --- is the Cato Institute's finding
that the U.S. has provided weaponry to 85% of the world's nations during
this century. This is not a recipe for peace or conflict reduction. The
most egregious case of the use and abuse of U.S.-supplied arms is the
U.S.-backed, Saudi-led war in Yemen, which has killed thousands of
civilians through Saudi air strikes and put millions at risk of famine
and fatal disease due to a blockade that has limited the availability of
food, medicine, and clean water. Most of Yemen's displaced people are
still in the country, as the Saudi-led coalition has made it extremely
difficult for them to leave. [An unintended consequence of U.S. arms
sales that has also contributed greatly to the refugee crisis is the
leakage of U.S.-supplied arms to non-state actor]{.underline}s like ISIS
and the Taliban, and the wide dispersal of Libya arms caches throughout
North Africa after the overthrow of the Qaddafi regime. Reducing
conflict and its crushing human consequences will not be easy. But the
first step is putting more energy into resolving conflicts than is
currently being poured into fighting them with bombs and troops or
fueling them through weapons trafficking. As noted above, opening our
doors to many more refugees and generously funding humanitarian aid
efforts should be another pillar of a new approach. Stopping wars will
require beefing up diplomacy, not proposing deep cuts in the State
Department, denigrating career diplomats, and failing to even appoint
ambassadors to key nations. It will also require working closely with
allies and listening to the concerns of current and potential
adversaries, as was done in the negotiation of the landmark deal to curb
Iran's nuclear weapons capability. And finally, [we need a new arms
transfer policy that curbs shipments to human rights abusers and war
zones]{.underline} --- not through lip service, but through actual
reductions in sales. All of the above may seem like a pipe dream under
the "America First" approach of the current administration. But
administrations change, as does Congress, and if large numbers of people
don't demand an end to our policy of perpetual war and a resurgence of
diplomacy, it will never happen. It's time to get to work towards
building a better world, however long it may take to get there.

### 2AC MPX Mod -- Democracy/Poverty/Structural Violence

#### Arms sales contribute to global inequality and diminish democratic institutions 

Andrew **Feinstein, 2012**, The Shadow World: Inside the Global Arms
Trade, p. 524-525, mm

[An inestimably large amount of public money is expended on the arms
trad]{.underline}e[. This is not only in direct government
expenditures,]{.underline} which totals trillions of dollars a year, but
in massive state subsidization of R&D, export and other incentives,
wastage on unnecessary weapons systems, overspending by contractors and
bailouts of badly run companies. Even the jobs produced by the trade
cost significantly more to create and sustain than jobs in any other
sector, with larger amounts of public money spent on them. Almost any
other form of job creation would be more cost-effective. In addition,
[the socio-economic opportunity costs of the arms trade, especially but
by no means exclusively in developing countries, are
immeasurable]{.underline}. South Africa's experience was stark but not
uncommon. [In the late 2000s, as developed countries were forced to cut
back their public spending]{.underline} to pay for the bailout of banks
and the economic consequences of their hubristic investment strategies,
[defense-related spending was among the least affected]{.underline}.
[Instead, benefits to the poorest, education, health and public services
were hit the hardes]{.underline}t. Moreover, [the manner in which the
arms trade operates has an even more fundamental consequences: the
diminution of democracies where they exist, and the entrenchment of
undemocratic]{.underline}, often barbarous [states]{.underline}, such as
Saudi Arabia and Iran. The opaque way in which arms deals are concluded,
habitually among a small clique of people who share a narrow
self-interest, makes it impossible for the public to adjudicate whether
huge amounts of their money are being used in the best possible way.
[The close relationship between governments and
contractors,]{.underline} and the national security 'imperative', even
undermines meaningful judicial oversight. This is made worse by the
difficulty of substantive media and civil society scrutiny. National
security concerns, while sometimes legitimate, are often used to hide
information about malfeasance that would in no way undermine security.
Legislation overseeing the trade is inadequate and in many countries
non-existent. Debate about such legislation is seldom meaningfully
entertained. [All of this makes our hard-won democracies less
transparent]{.underline}, accountable and honest. And it results in
citizens being unable to determine whether decisions are being made in
the national interest, or in some other, narrower interest.

#### That exacerbates human insecurity -- outweighs on magnitude 

**Holden**, Paul. **2017**, Indefensible : Seven Myths that Sustain the
Global Arms Trade, Zed Books, p. 35-38, mm

In this chapter we have tackled the issue of security in a very
traditional sense, namely as a measure of protection against military
violence. This is, arguably, the way that many people understand the
concept of security: keeping the country safe from invasion or violence.
But there is a strong and emerging trend towards considering security in
a much broader--- and much more useful--- way. Driving this thinking is
the adoption of a paradigm that goes by the name of 'human security'.
Human security is defined by the United Nations as 'the right of all
people to live in freedom and dignity, free from poverty and despair'.
Underpinning this is the recognition that 'all individuals, in
particular vulnerable people, are entitled to freedom from fear and
freedom from want, with an equal opportunity to enjoy all their rights
and fully develop their human potential'. 58 When security is thought
about in this way--- and it is hard to argue that a population that is
chronically malnourished is not at risk--- the type of threats that need
to be addressed changes drastically. Instead of just focusing on threats
from war or conflict, human security requires us to look at all the
various risks that are faced in the world today that undermine human
dignity, drive poverty and put billions of people in a constant state of
emergency of survival. Some of these risks include access to clean
water, food security, climate change, health pandemics, violent
multinational organized crime and repressive states that use their
monopoly of violence to terrorize their own populations. [There is
little doubt that]{.underline}, when considered in this light, [the
world suffers a serious human security deficit. Global disease, poverty
and hunger]{.underline}, for example, [devastate]{.underline} lives in
[many parts of the world]{.underline}. It is estimated that 1.5 million
children under five die each year of vaccine-preventable diseases, 59
while 3.1 million children a year die from malnutrition. 60 Some
national leaders recognize this. An interesting example is Ethiopia,
long one of the poorest and most conflict-ridden countries in the world.
Following a devastating border war with neighboring Eritrea in
1998‒2000, and facing security threats from its other neighbors, Somalia
and Sudan, the Ethiopian govern­ ment published its national security
policy white paper in 2002. 61 Decrying what it called 'jingoism with an
empty stomach', Ethiopia put economic development at the centre of its
national security plan, with military spending (capped at 2% of GDP but
in practice lower) as subordinate to that goal. [Meanwhile, the world
stands on the brink of one of the biggest global
catastrophes]{.underline} in human history, [in the form of climate
change]{.underline}. With no substantial change in the way things are
done around the world, and no effort made to tackle global greenhouse
gas emissions, it is predicted that the earth's temperature will rise by
3.7 to 4.8 degrees Celsius by 2100. 62 [The consequences]{.underline} of
this [would be devastating]{.underline}, [threatening]{.underline}
human--- and national and international--- security in numerous ways: •
• • Increased drought in many parts of the world, leading to severe
water shortages. Greatly reduced global agricultural yields from
increased heat and reduced rainfall, as global food demand increases. A
major spread of tropical diseases such as malaria to new parts of the
world, potentially leading to millions of additional deaths. A major
increase in the prevalence and severity of natural disasters such as
hurricanes and flooding, with the potential to devastate low-lying and
coastal regions, a phenomenon that is already observable today. In the
extreme, low-lying areas and small island states becoming completely
uninhabitable. Vast refugee flows resulting from the above developments.
Increased internal and international tensions over water resources and
increasingly scarce fertile land. [Mass extinction]{.underline} of
species and loss of biodiversity, with severe consequences for humans
through the food chain. 63 But even rises of less than 2 degrees
Celsius, a level considered increasingly difficult to achieve, would
lead to many severe conse­ quences of the type listed above; [the more
action is taken to reduce emissions, the lower the likely temperature
rise, and the less probable the most dangerous impacts become.
Where,]{.underline} you might ask, [does military spending fit into
this? In two key ways.]{.underline} [First, military expenditure is
massive, and fails to]{.underline} substantially [tackle any of these
major threats to human security]{.underline}. If only a fraction of
military spending was focused on broader human security goals, the
improvement in the security profile of billions of people around the
world would be tremendous. The [second]{.underline} way in which
spending on weapons contributes to human security should also be
obvious: the goals of freedom from want and fear are most likely to be
achieved in democratic states that are accountable to their populations.
But, as we've discussed in detail above, [huge amounts of global
military spending is directed towards maintaining dictatorships or
repressive regimes]{.underline}. This is not just a problem of the
developing world. [The majority of military purchases by repressive
regimes are from the world's biggest arms dealers]{.underline}: the
permanent members of the UN Security Council. And even in democracies,
military spending that is tainted by corruption poses a major threat to
good governance, and can, in the worst case scenarios, create the
mechanisms by which democracy gets replaced by oligarchy and repression
(this is discussed in detail in Myth 5). Considering this, perhaps it is
time to recognize one powerful fact: **[even a small reduction in
defense spending]{.underline}**, one that sees resources properly
devoted to the human security dangers faced by the majority of the
world's population, [could actually make the world safer, healthier,
more prosperous and more secure]{.underline}.

### 2AC MPX Mod -- Middle East

#### Arms sales destabilize the Middle East -- creates spiraling security dilemmas that culminate in conflict 

Perry **Cammack** **and** Michele **Dunne**, 10/23/18, \[Cammack is a
nonresident fellow in the Middle East Program at the Carnegie Endowment
for International Peace; Dunne is an expert on political and economic
change in Arab countries\], Carnegie Endowment for International Peace,,

Beyond direct military involvement, [outside actors]{.underline}
[also]{.underline} [intervene]{.underline} indirectly [through arms
sales]{.underline} and security assistance, which can seem an appealing
way to influence the contours of a conflict without deploying troops or
undertaking military action. Moreover, for leading exporters, including
the United States and its European allies as well as Russia and China,
arms sales can generate significant economic benefits, and they have
become a diplomatic priority as well as a factor in the political
fortune of leaders in exporting countries. The Middle East is the most
militarized region in the world. Although numbering less than 6 percent
of the world's population and contributing less than 5 percent of its
GDP, it accounted for nearly one-third of the world's arms imports
between 2013 and 2017---more than doubling its share compared to the
previous five-year period.11 Saudi Arabia, Egypt, and the United Arab
Emirates were three of the four top arms importers in the world (with
Algeria and Iraq also in the top ten) between 2013 and 2017. All three
have intervened militarily in neighboring countries (Saudi Arabia and
the UAE in Yemen, Egypt in Libya) since 2013. Turkey and Israel (also a
significant exporter) were in the world's top twenty arms importers,
while Iran imported much fewer arms (primarily from Russia and China)
due to international sanctions.12 [Meanwhile, the United States was the
world's largest arms exporter]{.underline} between 2013 and 2017,
comprising some 34 percent of the global total, followed by Russia,
France, Germany, China, and the United Kingdom. The United States and
the UK were the major suppliers to Saudi Arabia, while the United States
and France have supplied Egypt as well as the UAE. Germany has
diminished its sales to Arab states, although it remains a major
supplier to Israel.13 [The]{.underline} April [2018]{.underline} U.S.
[presidential memorandum]{.underline} to streamline procedures for
conventional arms transfers issued by Donald Trump [is
unabashed]{.underline} regarding the economic advantages of arms
exports; its first paragraph hails "a dynamic defense industrial base,
which currently employs more than 1.7 million people."14 French
President Emmanuel Macron also has pushed aggressively for arms sales to
the Middle East, despite growing criticism of potential abuses related
to the technology provided.15 In addition to the economic benefits,
advocates of arms exports in democratic countries argue that arms sales
and security assistance programs can help to professionalize developing
militaries, and in this way can produce a moderating influence on
recipient nations.16 U.S. officials also tout the need to improve allied
states' capabilities to enhance the possibility of joint operations with
U.S. forces. [But is there evidence that the increased provision of arms
has helped to stabilize the Middle East]{.underline}, or even to provide
victory for key allies? [Unfortunately, the brutality of contemporary
Middle Eastern wars suggests that this flood of weapons has poured fuel
on the fire and made conflicts lengthier as well as
deadlier.]{.underline} First, [arms sales to belligerents in a conflict
are seldom a decisive factor, but rather invite a counterreaction by
opposing states]{.underline}, [thereby feeding civil wars rather than
extinguishing them]{.underline}. U.S. and European supply to the
Saudi-Emirati intervention in Yemen has coincided with Iran's increased
support for its Houthi partners.17 The provision of weapons by the
United States and several Gulf states to Syrian rebels initially helped
to tip the balance against the Syrian army. But this same support also
encouraged Iran to escalate its support, and once it became clear that
the Obama administration would not take direct military action against
the Syrian armed forces, Russia seized an opening to intervene and
defeat those same rebels, thereby decisively changing the contours of
the conflict. [Even worse, arms provided to militaries in fragile or
highly corrupt states can slip into the hands of terrorists, militias,
and other nonstate actors]{.underline}. Although the Houthi rebels have
reportedly received Iranian-supplied ballistic missiles, many of their
ballistic missile stocks are composed of Russian and North Korean
weapons originally provided to the Yemeni army and seized during Houthi
advances in 2013 and 2014.18 A comprehensive survey by Conflict Armament
Research of 40,000 combat items recovered from Islamic State fighters in
Syria and Iraq suggests that more than 50 percent of their weapons were
originally produced by Russia and China (many of them for the Syrian and
Iraqi armies), and 30 percent originated from Warsaw Pact--era Eastern
Europe. Three percent of weapons and 13 percent of ammunition were NATO
caliber, presumably seized from the Iraqi armed forces during the
Islamic State's advances in 2014.19 In one case, an advanced anti-tank
guided weapon was reportedly manufactured in Europe, sold to the United
States, supplied to a party in Syria, and transferred to the Islamic
State in Iraq, where it was recovered---all within two months of leaving
the factory.20 Unfortunately, [the advanced weapons systems being sold
to authoritarian Arab governments today may be used by insurgent
fighters in future wars.]{.underline}

### Middle East ext -- Arms Sales -\> Instability

#### Arms Sales increase instability in the Middle East

Last week France's foreign minister, Laurent Fabius, disclosed progress
in talks to sell Rafale fighter jets to the UAE, one of the Middle
East's biggest and most aggressive arms buyers. **[States in the Middle
East are now more prepared to use the weapons they are
buying.]{.underline}** [With conflicts raging in Syria, Iraq, Libya and
Yemen, and with Egypt also battling Islamist extremists in the Sinai,
the signs that Russia is preparing to increase its own arms
sales]{.underline} -- and to the Gulf states' biggest rival, Iran --
[are raising fears that **tensions will be stoked further
still.**]{.underline} [In particular, Saudi Arabia and Iran are facing
off in the conflict in Yemen]{.underline} where, despite the
announcement by Riyadh on Tuesday that it had halted its [month-long
bombing campaign]{.underline}, jets continued to strike Houthi rebel
positions close to the capital Sanaa, around the third city Taez, and in
the central town of Yarim. [According to the New York Times, defence
industry officials have notified Congress that they are expecting
additional requests from Arab states fighting Isis]{.underline} -- Saudi
Arabia, the UAE, Qatar, Bahrain, Jordan and Egypt -- [for thousands of
new US-made weapons, including missiles and bombs, to rebuild depleted
arms stockpiles]{.underline}. Ironically, among the key weapons
suppliers in the arms race are permanent members of the UN security
council who have been at the centre of two unconventional arms control
initiatives -- disarming the Syrian government's stockpiles of chemical
weapons and negotiating for a deal on Iran's nuclear programme. [The
scale of the arms race was revealed this year in reports published by
IHS Jane's Global Defence Trade Report and the Stockholm International
Peace Research Institute (Sipri).]{.underline} They showed how Saudi
Arabia had become the world's largest importer of weapons and fourth
largest military spender and that other Middle East states were sharply
increasing their arms purchases. Adding to the concern is the fact that
the spending spree on arms comes against the background of a marked
increase in military interventions by countries in the region since the
Arab spring in 2011. Saudi Arabia has intervened in Bahrain (at the
request of that kingdom's ruler during the so-called Pearl revolution),
in Yemen in 2009 and again in Yemen this year. In addition, [a new
Saudi-led and largely Sunni military alliance -- announced this
year]{.underline} and dubbed the "Arab Nato" -- [appears primarily
designed as a new foil to Iran in the **widening proxy conflict between
Riyadh and Tehran**.]{.underline} And [among those concerned by Saudi's
new military assertiveness]{.underline} - on the back of its arms buying
spree - [was the Iraqi prime minister, Abadi.]{.underline} "The
dangerous thing is, [we don't know what the Saudis want to do after
\[their intervention in Yemen]{.underline}\]," Abadi told US reporters
last week. "[Is Iraq within their radar]{.underline}? That's very, very
dangerous. The idea that you [intervene in another state unprovoked just
for regional ambition is wrong]{.underline}. [Saddam has done it before.
See what it has done to the country]{.underline}."

### 2AC MPX Mod -- Taiwan

#### US-Taiwan relationship angers China -- arms sales only add fuel to the fire 

**Horton** 7-9-**19** -- Contributing journalist based in Taipei, Taiwan
(Chris Horton, New York Times, "Taiwan Set to Receive \$2 Billion in
U.S. Arms, Drawing Ire from China,"
<https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/09/world/asia/taiwan-arms-sales.html>)//AL

[The United States has tentatively approved the sale of \$2 billion in
military hardware to Taiwan, demonstrating support for its unofficial
ally in a move likely to exacerbate deteriorating ties between
Washington and Beijing. The Defense Security Cooperation Agency, part of
the United States Defense Department, notified Congress of two proposed
arms sales on Monday.]{.underline} The first notification included 108
M1A2T Abrams tanks, as well as Hercules armored vehicles and heavy
equipment transporters. The second included more than \$220 million in
Stinger antiaircraft missiles. [The tentative approvals come as
relations between the United States and China are already being tested
by a trade war and the decoupling of technology supply chains. The
armaments would provide Taiwan with greater deterrence capabilities
against the growing military threat from China, experts
said.]{.underline} "These tanks and missiles will provide the Taiwan
army with a modern capability to deter and complicate the operational
planning of the People's Liberation Army forces that coerce and threaten
Taiwan," Rupert Hammond-Chambers, president of the U.S.-Taiwan Business
Council, said in a statement on Monday. "They will also offer new
opportunities to engage in cooperation with the United States in both
the deployment and operations phases." [United States lawmakers have 30
days to object to the sale, but they are considered unlikely to do so.
The approvals come as Taiwan's president, Tsai Ing-wen, prepares for a
trip this week to North America, a visit that could further anger
Beijing. The Taiwanese government said her first stop would be New
York.]{.underline} The United States broke formal diplomatic ties with
Taiwan's government in 1979 in order to establish relations with
[China's Communist government]{.underline}, which [claims the
self-governing island as its territory and has threatened to unify it
with the mainland by force.]{.underline} Shortly after the end of the
formal alliance, along with the American military presence there,
Congress passed the Taiwan Relations Act, which requires that the United
States provide Taiwan with weapons of a defensive nature to deter an
attack from China. In 1982, the United States broadened its support with
a document known as the Six Assurances, the first of which stated that
Washington would not set a date for ending arms sales to Taiwan. [Chang
Tun-han, a spokesman for Ms. Tsai, welcomed the news of the tentative
arms sales approvals on Tuesday.]{.underline} "The American government
continues to take concrete actions to fulfill its commitments under the
Taiwan Relations Act and the Six Assurances, assisting Taiwan in
strengthening its defensive capabilities," Mr. Chang said in a
statement. "We express our deepest gratitude." [At a regularly scheduled
news briefing in Beijing on Tuesday, Geng Shuang, spokesman for the
Chinese Foreign Ministry, expressed opposition to the sales, saying they
could harm relations between China and the United States.]{.underline}

#### And, U.S.-China war escalates and goes global -- Taiwan is the cause

[As China's power has grown]{.underline} in recent years,
[so]{.underline}, [too]{.underline}, [has the risk of war with the
U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates. [Under]{.underline} President
[Xi]{.underline} Jinping, [China has increased its]{.underline}
political and economic [**pressure** on Taiwan]{.underline} and built
military installations on coral reefs in the South China Sea, [fueling
Washington's **fears** that Chinese expansionism will threaten U.S.
allies and influence]{.underline} in the region. [U.S. destroyers have
transited the Taiwan Strait]{.underline}, [to **loud protests** from
Beijing]{.underline}. American policymakers have wondered aloud whether
they should send an aircraft carrier through the strait as well. Chinese
fighter jets have intercepted U.S. aircraft in the skies above the South
China Sea. [Meanwhile]{.underline}, U.S. President Donald [Trump has
brought]{.underline} long-simmering [economic disputes to a **rolling
boil**]{.underline}. A war between the two countries remains unlikely,
but [the prospect of a military
confrontation]{.underline}---[resulting]{.underline}, for example,
[from]{.underline} [a Chinese campaign against
**Taiwan**]{.underline}---[no longer seems]{.underline} as
[implausible]{.underline} as it once did. And [the odds of such a
confrontation going nuclear]{.underline} [are higher]{.underline} [than
most]{.underline} policymakers and analysts [think]{.underline}. Members
of China's strategic community tend to dismiss such concerns. Likewise,
U.S. studies of a potential war with China often exclude nuclear weapons
from the analysis entirely, treating them as basically irrelevant to the
course of a conflict. Asked about the issue in 2015, Dennis Blair, the
former commander of U.S. forces in the Indo-Pacific, estimated the
likelihood of a U.S.-Chinese nuclear crisis as "somewhere between nil
and zero." This assurance is misguided. [If deployed against
China]{.underline}, the Pentagon's preferred style of [conventional
warfare would be a]{.underline} potential [recipe for **nuclear
escalation**]{.underline}. Since the end of the Cold War, the United
States' signature approach to war has been simple: punch deep into enemy
territory in order to rapidly knock out the opponent's key military
assets at minimal cost. But the Pentagon developed this formula in wars
against Afghanistan, Iraq, Libya, and Serbia, none of which was a
nuclear power. [China]{.underline}, by contrast, not only [has nuclear
weapons]{.underline}; it has also **[intermingled]{.underline}** them
[with its conventional military forces]{.underline}, [making it
difficult to attack one without]{.underline} attacking [the
other]{.underline}. [This means that a]{.underline} major U.S. [military
campaign]{.underline} [targeting China's]{.underline} [conventional
forces]{.underline} [would]{.underline} likely [also threaten its
nuclear arsenal]{.underline}. [Faced with such a threat]{.underline},
Chinese [leaders could decide to use]{.underline} their [nuclear
weapons]{.underline} while they were still able to. As U.S. and Chinese
[leaders navigate a relationship fraught with **mutual
suspicion**]{.underline}, they must come to grips with the fact that a
[conventional war could skid into a **nuclear
confrontation**]{.underline}. Although this risk is not high in absolute
terms, its [consequences]{.underline} for the region and the world
[would be devastating]{.underline}. [As long as the U]{.underline}nited
[S]{.underline}tates [and China continue to pursue their
current]{.underline} grand [strategies]{.underline}, [the risk is likely
to endure]{.underline}. This means that leaders on both sides should
dispense with the illusion that they can easily fight a limited war.
They should focus instead on managing or resolving the political,
economic, and military tensions that might lead to a conflict in the
first place. A NEW KIND OF THREAT There are some reasons for optimism.
For one, China has long stood out for its nonaggressive nuclear
doctrine. After its first nuclear test, in 1964, China largely avoided
the Cold War arms race, building a much smaller and simpler nuclear
arsenal than its resources would have allowed. Chinese leaders have
consistently characterized nuclear weapons as useful only for deterring
nuclear aggression and coercion. Historically, this narrow purpose
required only a handful of nuclear weapons that could ensure Chinese
retaliation in the event of an attack. To this day, China maintains a
"no first use" pledge, promising that it will never be the first to use
nuclear weapons. The prospect of a nuclear conflict can also seem like a
relic of the Cold War. Back then, the United States and its allies lived
in fear of a Warsaw Pact offensive rapidly overrunning Europe. NATO
stood ready to use nuclear weapons first to stalemate such an attack.
Both Washington and Moscow also consistently worried that their nuclear
forces could be taken out in a bolt-from-the-blue nuclear strike by the
other side. This mutual fear increased the risk that one superpower
might rush to launch in the erroneous belief that it was already under
attack. Initially, the danger of unauthorized strikes also loomed large.
In the 1950s, lax safety procedures for U.S. nuclear weapons stationed
on NATO soil, as well as minimal civilian oversight of U.S. military
commanders, raised a serious risk that nuclear escalation could have
occurred without explicit orders from the U.S. president. The good news
is that these Cold War worries have little bearing on U.S.-Chinese
relations today. Neither country could rapidly overrun the other's
territory in a conventional war. Neither seems worried about a nuclear
bolt from the blue. And civilian political control of nuclear weapons is
relatively strong in both countries. What remains, in theory, is the
comforting logic of mutual deterrence: in a war between two nuclear
powers, neither side will launch a nuclear strike for fear that its
enemy will respond in kind. The bad news is that [one]{.underline} other
[trigger remains]{.underline}: [a **conventional war** that threatens
China's nuclear arsenal]{.underline}. [Conventional forces can threaten
nuclear forces in ways that **generate pressures** to
escalate]{.underline}---[especially when]{.underline} ever more capable
[U.S.]{.underline} conventional [forces face adversaries
with]{.underline} relatively small and [fragile]{.underline} nuclear
[arsenals]{.underline}, [such as China]{.underline}. [If U.S. operations
endangered]{.underline} or damaged [China's nuclear forces]{.underline},
[Chinese leaders might]{.underline} come to [think that Washington had
aims **beyond** winning the conventional war]{.underline}---[that it
might be seeking to]{.underline} disable or [destroy China's nuclear
arsenal]{.underline} outright, perhaps as a prelude to regime change.
[In the fog of war]{.underline}, [Beijing might]{.underline} reluctantly
[conclude that]{.underline} limited **[nuclear
escalation]{.underline}**---an initial strike small enough that it could
avoid full-scale U.S. retaliation---[was a viable option]{.underline} to
defend itself. STRAIT SHOOTERS [The most worrisome flash
point]{.underline} for a U.S.-Chinese war [is **Taiwan**]{.underline}.
[Beijing's]{.underline} long-term [objective of reunifying the island
with mainland China is]{.underline} clearly [in conflict with
Washington's]{.underline} longstanding [desire to maintain the status
quo in the strait]{.underline}. It is not difficult to imagine how [this
might lead to **war**]{.underline}. For example, [China could decide
that the]{.underline} political or military [window for regaining
control]{.underline} over the island [was closing and launch an
**attack**]{.underline}, [using air]{.underline} and naval [forces to
blockade Taiwanese harbors or bombard the island]{.underline}. Although
U.S. law does not require Washington to intervene in such a scenario,
the Taiwan Relations Act states that the United States will "consider
any effort to determine the future of Taiwan by other than peaceful
means, including by boycotts or embargoes, a threat to the peace and
security of the Western Pacific area and of grave concern to the United
States." [Were Washington to intervene on Taipei's behalf]{.underline},
[the world's sole superpower and its rising competitor would find
themselves in]{.underline} the first **[great-power war]{.underline}**
of the twenty-first century. [In the course of such a war]{.underline},
[U.S. conventional military operations would likely
**threaten**]{.underline}, disable, or outright eliminate some [Chinese
nuclear capabilities]{.underline}---whether doing so was Washington's
stated objective or not. In fact, if the United States engaged in the
style of warfare it has practiced over the last 30 years, [this outcome
would be all but **guaranteed**]{.underline}. Consider submarine
warfare. [China could use its]{.underline} conventionally armed attack
[submarines to blockade Taiwanese harbors]{.underline} or bomb the
island, [or to attack U.S.]{.underline} and allied [forces in the
region]{.underline}. [If that happened]{.underline}, [the U.S. Navy
would]{.underline} almost certainly [undertake an **antisubmarine
campaign**]{.underline}, [which would likely threaten
China's]{.underline} "boomers," the four [nuclear-armed ballistic
missile submarines]{.underline} that form its naval nuclear deterrent.
[China's]{.underline} conventionally armed and nuclear-armed [submarines
share the same]{.underline} shore-based [communications
system]{.underline}; [a U.S. attack]{.underline} [on]{.underline} these
[transmitters]{.underline} would thus not only disrupt the activities of
China's attack submarine force but also [cut off its boomers from
contact]{.underline} with Beijing, [leaving Chinese leaders **unsure**
of the fate of their naval nuclear force]{.underline}. In addition,
nuclear ballistic missile submarines depend on attack submarines for
protection, just as lumbering bomber aircraft rely on nimble fighter
jets. If the United States started sinking Chinese attack submarines, it
would be sinking the very force that protects China's ballistic missile
submarines, leaving the latter dramatically more vulnerable. Even more
dangerous, [U.S. forces]{.underline} hunting Chinese attack submarines
[could inadvertently sink a Chinese boomer]{.underline} instead. After
all, at least some Chinese attack submarines might be escorting
ballistic missile submarines, especially in wartime, when China might
flush its boomers from their ports and try to send them within range of
the continental United States. Since correctly identifying targets
remains one of the trickiest challenges of undersea warfare, a U.S.
submarine crew might come within shooting range of a Chinese submarine
without being sure of its type, especially in a crowded, noisy
environment like the Taiwan Strait. Platitudes about caution are easy in
peacetime. In wartime, when Chinese attack submarines might already have
launched deadly strikes, the U.S. crew might decide to shoot first and
ask questions later. [Adding to China's sense of
**vulnerability**]{.underline}, [the small size of its
nuclear]{.underline}-[armed submarine force means that just
two]{.underline} such [incidents would eliminate half of
its]{.underline} [sea-based deterrent]{.underline}. Meanwhile, any
Chinese [boomers that escaped this fate would]{.underline} likely [be
cut off from communication]{.underline} with onshore commanders, left
without an escort force, and unable to return to destroyed ports. If
that happened, [China would essentially have no naval nuclear
deterrent]{.underline}. The situation is similar onshore, where any U.S.
military campaign would have to contend with China's growing land-based
conventional ballistic missile force. Much of this force is within range
of Taiwan, ready to launch ballistic missiles against the island or at
any allies coming to its aid. Once again, U.S. [victory]{.underline}
would hinge on the ability to degrade this conventional ballistic
missile force. And once again, it [would be **virtually
impossible**]{.underline} to do so [while leaving China's nuclear
ballistic missile force unscathed]{.underline}. [Chinese conventional
and nuclear ballistic missiles are]{.underline} often [attached to the
same base headquarters]{.underline}, meaning that [they]{.underline}
likely [share transportation and supply networks]{.underline}, [patrol
routes]{.underline}, [and other **supporting
infrastructure**]{.underline}. It is also possible that they share some
command-and-control networks, or that the United States would be unable
to distinguish between the conventional and nuclear networks even if
they were physically separate. To add to the challenge, some of China's
ballistic missiles can carry either a conventional or a nuclear warhead,
and the two versions are virtually indistinguishable to U.S. aerial
surveillance. In a war, targeting the conventional variants would likely
mean destroying some nuclear ones in the process. Furthermore, [sending
manned aircraft to attack Chinese missile launch sites]{.underline} and
bases [would require]{.underline} at least [partial control of the
airspace over China]{.underline}, [which]{.underline} in turn [would
require weakening Chinese air defenses]{.underline}. But degrading
[China's coastal air defense network]{.underline} in order to fight a
conventional war [would]{.underline} also [leave much of its nuclear
force without protection]{.underline}. Once China was under attack, its
leaders might come to fear that even intercontinental ballistic missiles
located deep in the country's interior were vulnerable. For years,
observers have pointed to the U.S. military's failed attempts to locate
and destroy Iraqi Scud missiles during the 1990--91 Gulf War as evidence
that mobile missiles are virtually impervious to attack. Therefore, the
thinking goes, China could retain a nuclear deterrent no matter what
harm U.S. forces inflicted on its coastal areas. Yet recent research
suggests otherwise. [Chinese intercontinental ballistic
missiles]{.underline} are [larger and less mobile than]{.underline} the
[Iraqi Scuds]{.underline} were, and they are harder to move without
detection. [The U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates
[is]{.underline} also [likely to have been tracking them]{.underline}
much more closely in peacetime. As a result, China is unlikely to view a
failed Scud hunt in Iraq nearly 30 years ago as reassurance that its
residual nuclear force is safe today, especially during an ongoing,
high-intensity conventional war. China's vehement criticism of a U.S.
regional missile defense system designed to guard against a potential
North Korean attack already reflects these latent fears. Beijing's worry
is that this system could help Washington block the handful of missiles
China might launch in the aftermath of a U.S. attack on its arsenal.
That sort of campaign might seem much more plausible in Beijing's eyes
if a conventional war had already begun to seriously undermine other
parts of China's nuclear deterrent. It does not help that China's
real-time awareness of the state of its forces would probably be
limited, since blinding the adversary is a standard part of the U.S.
military playbook. Put simply, [the favored U.S. strategy to ensure a
conventional victory would]{.underline} likely [endanger]{.underline}
much of [China's nuclear arsenal]{.underline} in the process, at sea and
on land. [Whether the United States actually intended to
target]{.underline} all of China's nuclear [weapons would be
**incidental**]{.underline}. [All that would matter is that Chinese
leaders would consider them **threatened**]{.underline}. LESSONS FROM
THE PAST At that point, the question becomes, How will China react? Will
it practice restraint and uphold the "no first use" pledge once its
nuclear forces appear to be under attack? Or will it use those weapons
while it still can, gambling that limited escalation will either halt
the U.S. campaign or intimidate Washington into backing down? Chinese
writings and statements remain deliberately ambiguous on this point. It
is unclear which exact set of capabilities China considers part of its
core nuclear deterrent and which it considers less crucial. For example,
if China already recognizes that its sea-based nuclear deterrent is
relatively small and weak, then losing some of its ballistic missile
submarines in a war might not prompt any radical discontinuity in its
calculus. The danger lies in [wartime developments]{.underline} that
[could **shift** China's assumptions about U.S. intentions]{.underline}.
[If Beijing interprets the erosion]{.underline} of its sea- and
land-based [nuclear forces as a **deliberate effort**]{.underline} to
destroy its nuclear deterrent, or perhaps even as a prelude to a nuclear
attack, [it might see limited **nuclear escalation** as a way to force
an **end** to the conflict]{.underline}. For example, [China could use
nuclear weapons to]{.underline} instantaneously [destroy the U.S. air
bases that posed the biggest threat to its arsenal]{.underline}. [It
could also launch a nuclear strike with no]{.underline} direct [military
purpose]{.underline}---on an unpopulated area or at sea---[as a way to
**signal** that the U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates [had
crossed a redline]{.underline}. [If such escalation appears
far-fetched]{.underline}, [China's **history** suggests
otherwise]{.underline}. [In 1969]{.underline}, **[similar
dynamics]{.underline}** [brought China to the brink of nuclear war with
the Soviet Union]{.underline}. In early March of that year, Chinese
troops ambushed Soviet guards amid rising tensions over a disputed
border area. Less than two weeks later, the two countries were fighting
an undeclared border war with heavy artillery and aircraft. [The
conflict quickly escalated beyond what Chinese leaders]{.underline} had
[expected]{.underline}, [and before the end of March]{.underline},
[Moscow was making thinly veiled **nuclear threats**]{.underline} to
pressure China to back down. Chinese leaders initially dismissed these
warnings, only to radically upgrade their threat assessment once they
learned that the Soviets had privately discussed nuclear attack plans
with other countries. Moscow never intended to follow through on its
nuclear threat, archives would later reveal, but Chinese leaders
believed otherwise. On three separate occasions, they were convinced
that a Soviet nuclear attack was imminent. Once, when Moscow sent
representatives to talks in Beijing, China suspected that the plane
transporting the delegation was in fact carrying nuclear weapons.
[Increasingly fearful]{.underline}, [China test-fired a thermonuclear
weapon]{.underline} in the Lop Nur desert [and put its rudimentary
nuclear forces on alert]{.underline}---a dangerous step in itself, as it
increased the risk of an unauthorized or accidental launch. Only after
numerous preparations for Soviet nuclear attacks that never came did
Beijing finally agree to negotiations. China is a different country
today than it was in the time of Mao Zedong, but [the 1969 conflict
offers important lessons]{.underline}. [China started a war in which it
believed nuclear weapons would be **irrelevant**]{.underline}, even
though the Soviet arsenal was several orders of magnitude larger than
China's, just as the U.S. arsenal dwarfs China's today. [Once the
conventional war did not go as planned]{.underline}, [the Chinese
**reversed** their **assessment** of the possibility of a nuclear
attack]{.underline} [to a degree bordering on **paranoia**]{.underline}.
Most worrying, [China signaled that it was]{.underline} actually
[**considering** using its nuclear weapons]{.underline}, [even though it
had to expect]{.underline} devastating **[retaliation]{.underline}**.
Ambiguous wartime information and worst-case thinking led it to take
nuclear risks it would have considered unthinkable only months earlier.
This pattern could unfold again today.

### 2AC MPX Mod -- Terrorism

#### Arms sales increase the risk of terrorism

Discussions about [how to prevent the worsening acts of global terrorism
continue.]{.underline} However, as recent events such as the terrorist
attack on London Bridge and Manchester Arena show[, current measures are
largely ineffective]{.underline}. The actions of individuals willing to
kill themselves by perpetrating such acts of terrorism have created an
almost impossible barrier to effective security. Most terrorist acts
cause the death and injury of civilians. [The effects of armed conflict
and the international arms trade on the health of civilians has been
widely discussed in medical journals, but little changes, except perhaps
the increased effectiveness of traded weapons in killing and injuring
the greatest number of people (mostly civilians)]{.underline}.  In
recent years the increased targeting of healthcare workers and
facilities by armed factions using both legally and illegally bought
weapons has been well documented. On a recent visit to Saudi Arabia, the
US President Donald Trump secured a sale involving major weapons
worth US\$110 billion, he said: "One of the things that we will discuss
is the purchase of lots of beautiful military equipment because nobody
makes it like the United States. And for us that means jobs, and it also
means frankly great security back here, which we want." [This
inappropriate description of weapons neglects to refer to the effect
that these weapons have on civilians in countries such as Yemen, where
currently there are hundreds of thousands of starving]{.underline}
children, where health facilities and hospitals have been directly
targeted and are hardly functioning, where there is now a massive
cholera outbreak, and where unimaginable suffering is currently
happening on a daily basis. It is perhaps unsurprising that the "war on
terror" is being lost by rich countries who parade certain human rights
values, but by selling weapons allow these values to be ignored in the
pursuit of money and power. I have worked in the war zones of Pakistan
and Afghanistan for more than 20 years and local health workers have
frequently informed me that the sale of arms by the USA, UK, and other
European countries to potentially fragile countries, particularly in the
Middle East and South Asia, has created resentment and concern. Whilst
[a direct link between some of the acts of terrorism committed against
Western countries and the lucrative arms trade]{.underline} can never be
proven, it is plausible that it could be one of the responsible factors.
According to the latest data from the Stockholm International Peace
Research Institute (SIPRI), the USA was the largest exporter of major
conventional weapons in the period 2011-15, accounting for 33% of the
global volume of weapons sold. The Middle East was the main destination
of US weapons, accounting for 41% of US arms exports. In SIPRI's latest
data, in 2014, the global sale of US and UK major conventional weapons
amounted to US\$ 218 billion and US\$ 42 billion respectively. The
Norwegian Initiative on Small Arms Transfers (NISAT) describes the role
of small arms and light weapons in armed violence. [Their analyses show
that rich countries lead the world in exporting these weapons to fragile
states and often to both sides in individual conflicts.]{.underline}
With regard to the export of only one category of small arms, namely
"bombs, grenades, ammunition, mines and others," in 2015 the UK and the
US exported US\$48.5 million and US\$901.3 million worth of such weapons
respectively to Middle Eastern countries. And both the UK and USA
exported such weapons to Israel as well as to Israel's potential enemies
in the region. [It is not wrong, in my opinion, for countries to make
weapons purely for their own defence. However, I think that the sale of
weapons to other countries where armed conflict is already ongoing or
where the potential for conflict is likely, in order to make vast
amounts of money, is immoral, unacceptable, and inevitably will lead to
dangerous reactions, one of which might be acts of
terrorism]{.underline}. The problem, however, is that politicians fear
that they will not be re-elected if they stop arms trading, even though
most of the profit doesn't benefit their country, but rather the rich
and powerful shareholders of the companies who make them and their
employees. Health professionals witness at first hand the appalling
injuries and suffering created by "beautiful military
equipment." Advocacy by them to help stop the arms trade might have some
influence on the politicians involved in this lucrative business. A
decision by rich countries to cease arms trading could help to reduce
radicalization and terrorism in countries suffering the consequences of
armed conflict. This is surely worth considering as a matter of urgency,
alongside enhanced security activity and other measures.

March 31, 2016, Ak.)

It's the totally unthinkable question that Americans find themselves
confronting this week: **[What would]{.underline}** President Donald
**[Trump]{.underline}** **[do in a genuine national
crisis?]{.underline}** After a series of overseas terror attacks and
some startling statements about nuclear weapons and torture, the world's
attention has turned to Trump's foreign policy---an area where [he has
few advisers, no experience and a tendency to fire off answers and deal
with the fallout later]{.underline}. The reality of a Trump candidacy
has begun to set in: If Trump is elected and a major national crisis
hits, he'll be the one with his hands on the button. He'll be at the
head of the table in the Situation Room. His decisions would steer
America's immediate response and could set the course of American policy
for years. What's hard to project with a normal politician is nearly
impossible to guess with Trump. He has no foreign policy or public
service experience, which means there's no official record to consult,
and his public statements, while extreme, have been vague. The
saber-rattling statements that excite his supporters also suggest he has
disregard for linchpins of the global order like NATO, the Geneva
Conventions and the hard-won global nuclear-weapons limits. Politico
Magazine asked foreign policy and counterterrorism experts, historians,
Trump biographers, even psychologists to take a serious guess at how
he'd handle the days after a terrorist attack in the United States---all
based on what they know about Trump the candidate and what he'll be
facing if he gets elected. The responses were at times surprising, and
at times unsettling. Some focused on Trump's apparent hesitancy about
sending troops into combat, and predicted he'd act more like President
Barack Obama than President George W. Bush. Others looked at his
immigration rhetoric and foresaw a country newly divided, with patrols
stalking Muslim neighborhoods and religious hatreds bubbling to the
surface. One biographer, familiar with Trump's primal response to any
perceived insult, drew a frightening picture of a quickly escalating set
of attacks and responses, with major cities caught in the crossfire.
But, then again, another predicted that Trump would simply withdraw to
his Twitter account, riding out the threat with a lot of talk and little
action. \*\*\* "[He invites]{.underline} President Vladimir [Putin to
the White House]{.underline} ... [announces]{.underline} that [America
is withdrawing from NATO]{.underline} and ... [visits Tehran to open up
a new]{.underline} American [embassy]{.underline}." Jacob Heilbrunn is
editor of the National Interest. Donald [Trump]{.underline} has already
made it clear that he [regards]{.underline} much of [the global
order]{.underline} that was established by Harry S. Truman and Dean
Acheson after World War II [as]{.underline} impotent and
[obsolete]{.underline}. Almost as soon as he's sworn the oath to serve
as commander-in-chief, Trump will go to work to create a new one based
on the exercise of American military power and cooperation with
Washington's traditional adversaries such as Russia. So the real
question may be this: How would **[a 9/11 event]{.underline}**
**[accelerate]{.underline}** **[his]{.underline}** already **[existing
efforts to upend the American national security
establishment]{.underline}**? Following the attack, President Trump
builds upon his initial attempts to restore relations with Russia, which
included nuclear arms-control negotiations. He now invites President
Vladimir Putin to the White House---complete with a state dinner in his
honor. Trump, the consummate dealmaker, says that it's imperative to let
bygones be bygones in the interest of a united front with Russia to
defeat the Islamic peril. At the same time, [Trump
announces]{.underline} that [America is withdrawing from NATO and
concedes Russia's sphere of influence in]{.underline} Eastern
[Europe]{.underline}. [England]{.underline}, which has already withdrawn
from the European Union, [joins the U.S-Russia alliance]{.underline}. In
following this course, **[Trump invokes World War II]{.underline}** to
declare that he's simply following in Franklin Roosevelt's footsteps.
All of this is [music to the Kremlin's ears]{.underline}, which has
consistently bemoaned the fact that the Obama administration has spurned
its offers of cooperation. British, Russian and American warplanes bomb
targets in Syria and Iraq that served as staging grounds for the Islamic
State's assault on America. In addition, **[Trump pivots
from]{.underline}** America's traditional alliance with **[Saudi Arabia
to]{.underline}** working with **[Iran]{.underline}**; to general
astonishment, he visits Tehran to open up a new American embassy. Trump
says that the only predictable thing about his presidency is that he
will always seek to be unpredictable. **[Domestically]{.underline}**,
**[Trump]{.underline}** takes a hard line, arguing that it's time to
take the handcuffs off the FBI and CIA. He **[embarks]{.underline}**
upon **[a program to place]{.underline}** American **[Muslims in
camps]{.underline}**, a program overseen by the Justice Department as it
was during the Roosevelt administration in World War II, when
Japanese-Americans were interned. The Washington Post and New York Times
editorial pages denounce Trump's new policy, but it meets with general
approbation among the American population, a number of [Democratic
Senators and Congressmen in swing states sign off]{.underline} on the
measure, and [the Supreme Court upholds it in an 8-1
decision]{.underline}. With his decisive moves, Trump enrages liberal
and conservative elites but his approval ratings soar to over 80 percent
in numerous polls. The era of Trump has begun. \*\*\* "Tweet after tweet
congratulating himself on foreseeing the attack and ridiculing the
terrorists' masculinity, their intelligence, their family members, their
ethnic identity and/or religion" Gwenda Blair is author of The Trumps:
Three Generations That Built an Empire. Twitter would be Trump's
front-line counter-attack. Tweet after tweet congratulating himself on
foreseeing the attack and ridiculing the terrorists' masculinity, their
intelligence, their family members, their ethnic identity and/or
religion---along with any civil libertarian or moderate voices asking
for caution, consultation with allies, or more operational and regional
intelligence before initiating counter-offensives against targets either
inside or outside the United States. Next would be live streamed
appearances on CNN, Fox, MSNBC, etc. in which Trump denounced the
terrorists, their supporters, and any opposition to the use of any and
all tactics against captured terrorist suspects. Then he would change
into Donald Trump Menswear 100% silk PJs with gold-embroidered POTUS
seal on front pocket, stretch out on a super-luxury top-grain leather
Trump Home Furnishings chaise, chow down on a prime-cut Trump steak, and
turn on WWE. In the event the attacks continued, he might be moved to
more action. Potential steps might include **[curfews, quarantines
and]{.underline}**/or **[internment]{.underline}** in certain
communities, required [loyalty oaths]{.underline} for government
employees, teachers, uniformed services, etc., civil defense drills in
schools, factories, offices, and other large installations such as
airports, train stations, subway systems, and the adoption and frequent
testing of alerts through texts and loudspeakers. \*\*\* "There would be
no rallying around the idea of America and what it stands for because
Americans will be fighting about just that" Ian Bremmer is president of
Eurasia Group and a global research professor at New York University.
It's not an easy thing to say, but [America was fortunate that 9/11
happened when it did]{.underline}. [The United States was in great shape
back then, as was its economy. There was no serious social discontent
bubbling]{.underline} beneath the surface, and inequality was nowhere
near the wedge issue it is today. [Washington's alliances around the
world were strong]{.underline} back then, and [China was still
weak]{.underline}. Washington even had [decent relations with
Moscow]{.underline}---and they improved after the tragedy. So when 9/11
happened, the entire country---and the world---rallied around the
president. That's **[a far cry from]{.underline}** where the United
States is **[today]{.underline}**. And let's be honest---**[Trump in the
White House during a real national security crisis is]{.underline}** as
close to a near-**[dystopian]{.underline}** America as can be imagined.
If terrorists were to hit the United States, America's political
response would be closer to what France went through following its
November attacks, with Trump playing the reactionary role called for
France's ex-President Nicolas Sarkozy. [He'd push for overall
surveillance and monitoring of Muslims]{.underline} in the United
States. I'd imagine there would be [house arrests and
deportations]{.underline} for many. And while some Americans would cheer
this knee-jerk response, most will be horrified to find themselves
living in a country where nothing more than your religion makes you
suspect. Europe will be horrified as well, and won't be near the
steadfast ally it was in 2001. There would be no rallying around the
idea of America and what it stands for because Americans will be
fighting about just that. \*\*\* "A president with that personality
would experience a large terrorist event as an enormous narcissistic
injury ... and **[his rage would be white-hot]{.underline}**" Martha
Stout is a psychologist and author of The Sociopath Next Door. As a
psychologist who has spent her career studying human personality and its
variations, I can tell you that personalities don't have an off switch,
not even for dire emergencies. If we suffered another brutal terrorist
attack, I fear that President [Trump would exhibit the same bombast,
rage and impulsivity]{.underline} that he has shown in the campaign
trail and imperil his fellow human beings, perhaps with even more
lasting effects than those of the disaster itself. The personality that
underlies Trump's observable behaviors---a demeanor of personal
superiority, a focus on being admired, immediate heated anger when
challenged, an emphasis on unlimited success, and an apparent
expectation of automatic compliance---would be problematic in a U.S.
president at any time, and **[plainly dangerous]{.underline}** should
our nation experience another terrorist atrocity. A president with such
a personality would experience a large terrorist event as an attack on
him personally, **[an enormous "narcissistic
injury"]{.underline}**---what psychologists call a perceived threat to
self-worth---and his rage would be white-hot. The anger we have seen
directed at protesters during Trump rallies would be multiplied by an
unknowable factor. That whisper in the ear from an aide, telling him
that an event had occurred, would instantly evoke **[a need for
reprisal]{.underline}**, a desire **[to attack]{.underline}** and to do
so **[right away, using airstrikes]{.underline}**, **[boots on
the]{.underline}** **[ground, torture in interrogations and any
other]{.underline}** "powerful" **[tactic]{.underline}** that occurred
to him. If there is a positive thread in this psychologically predicted
scenario, it is that such a huge perceived injury to Trump's sense of
self-worth would compel him to focus utterly on the source of that
injury. He would be single-mindedly intent on destroying the terrorists
and would have no tolerance for those who might wish to refashion the
country's pain and anger into a willingness to attack a different
target. In the aftermath of our waking nightmare in 2001, we might have
benefited from some portion of that single-mindedness. Still, with a
President Trump, the surge of bigotry and the resulting deportation and
internment efforts would do their own inestimable damage. [Given a
re-terrorized nation, Trump's famous skill at gaining allegiance from
people through]{.underline} their heightened [fears]{.underline}
[might]{.underline} very well **[sway Congress]{.underline}** and result
**[in]{.underline}** the actual implementation of some of his ideas:
**[a wholesale military response]{.underline}**, a **[lockdown of Muslim
communities]{.underline}**, and **[attempts to deport]{.underline}**
large groups of people. With an unapologetically self-involved and
rage-prone commander-in-chief---which is what we evidently would be
getting with a President Trump---**[nothing]{.underline}** would be
**[off the table]{.underline}**. \*\*\* "We must also hope that a
President Trump, unlike candidate Trump, would show some signs of
awareness of the nature of the threat" Ambassador Dennis Ross is a
long-time U.S. Mideast negotiator and author of the recently published
Doomed to Succeed: The US-Israeli relationship from Truman to Obama. If
such an attack takes place, it would be clear that Trump's
ill-considered readiness to stop Muslims from gaining entry to the
country has not worked---no surprise here, as he is playing to the ISIS
playbook that seeks polarization and needs the image of a war on Muslims
to attract followers. The fact that Trump has little use for our
alliances like NATO also means in the first instance, his response would
likely be to go it alone. But against whom? Did the attackers come from
ISIS and had they gone to Syria? Was al Qaeda competing with ISIS to
show it remains relevant and capable of producing larger mass casualty
acts of terror than ISIS? Should it be ISIS, we know from candidate
Trump that when it comes to ISIS he will listen to the military. But the
military has not been notably more inclined than President Obama to
commit forces on the ground. However, should ISIS prove to be
responsible for a 9/11 type attack---and clearly the events in Brussels
show its leaders are trying---we will need a far more dramatic effort
against them on the group to demonstrate they are losing, and will lose
further from any such attacks. Perhaps Trump, who has made it clear he
is reluctant to use ground forces, will call for carpet-bombing as a
punishment for ISIS. That will shift the onus onto us without removing
ISIS from Mosul or Raqqa---the key symbols of their success to date. In
the aftermath of a 9/11 type attack we need to inflict real and symbolic
setbacks on ISIS to blunt its appeal and to restore confidence among our
own citizenry and that of those very Sunnis we would want to partner
with us. Are they likely to partner with us if we can't offer
unmistakable signs of success and of our resolve? They won't take a new
president's word for it---or buy his "believe me" declarations. Will
Trump change and see the value of working with others? Let's hope so,
but there is little in his posture to date that suggests he will do so.
We must also hope that a President Trump, unlike candidate Trump, would
show some signs of awareness of the nature of the threat. Show some
signs of awareness that actually having alliances like NATO helps with
partners, helps with intelligence, and helps legitimize our actions. A
President Trump will need to frame the challenge clearly and spell out
the mission and objective in a way that does not walk away from the
values that we embody. And a President Trump would have to show he will
act not impulsively but effectively, recognizing that a longer-term
strategy for the Middle East will be necessary, a strategy that is
designed to shore up the state system. That system is under attack and
restoring it is necessary to prevent ISIS or its successors from having
the operational space in which to thrive and develop. Withdrawing from
the Middle East will only foster a vacuum that allows the most extreme
forces to emerge and pose more threat to states in the region. Candidate
Trump's instinct toward isolation can hardly be reassuring in this
regard. \*\*\* "Let us imagine that when the new president enters the
Situation Room to talk over the latest disaster, he's got Steve Hadley
and Eric Edelman and Meghan O'Sullivan around the table" Stephen
Sestanovich is a professor at Columbia University and a senior fellow at
the Council on Foreign Relations. In the national-security business, we
are often asked to think the unthinkable---nuclear war, chaos,
pestilence. Contemplating a Donald Trump presidency should be all in a
day's work. Even so, I find myself wanting to dodge the worst-case
scenario. Perhaps this unlikely chief executive will prepare for his day
of reckoning by surrounding himself with solid advisers and by tending,
however belatedly, to America's most important global relationships?
It's not absurd to hope that long before taking office President Trump
will have reached out to the Republican foreign-policy establishment and
that, by playing on personal ambition and patriotism, he will have
convinced those who hoped to work for President Rubio or President Jeb
Bush to serve him instead. Nor is it absurd to think that, before a new
9/11, he will have realized that the United States cannot get much done
in the world unless key allies are with us. So let us imagine that when
the new president enters the Situation Room to talk over the latest
disaster, he's got Steve Hadley and Eric Edelman and Meghan O'Sullivan
around the table. (And maybe vice president Condi Rice ready to fly off
to Brussels to represent him at the next day's emergency session of
NATO.) Like I say, none of this is absurd. But I don't expect it.
Whatever you think of the results, the Republican Party's A-team was
across the table from George W. Bush on September 11, 2001. On September
11, 2017, by contrast, we are likely to have a foreign-policy line-up
that reflects the party's nervous breakdown in the 2016 campaign. The
administration will be thinly staffed and often inexperienced, divided
against itself, suspicious of the professional bureaucracy, struggling
to develop coherent policies, and never sure what the president wants.
Donald Trump's own ideas and instincts have to be part of the picture we
draw in our minds of how the United States would respond to a major new
terrorist attack. But the mind of the president is not the only thing to
worry about. When one of the central institutions of the American
political system simultaneously cracks up and wins the White House, the
country's ability to formulate and implement effective policy will
inevitably be damaged. The same will be true of our ability to call on
support from others. On September 10, 2001, no one thought that America
was in a profound internal crisis, much less fighting for its political
sanity. Apart from kooks, no one thought America deserved---or was
somehow asking---to be attacked. No one doubted the value of being our
friend. In 2017, in the early days of a Trump administration, all this
will have changed. A president who has made hostility to Muslims and
other minorities his calling card, who has suggested NATO may be
"obsolete," who boasts that we have our own problems to solve, may find
the rest of the world ready to let us do so. Around the table in the Sit
Room, no one may say this to the boss. But everyone will know it. \*\*\*
"I'm betting the Trumpian response would be a lot closer to what Barack
Obama might do than Bush 43" Aaron David Miller is vice president for
new initiatives and a distinguished scholar at the Woodrow Wilson
International Center for Scholars. His most recent book is The End of
Greatness: Why America Can't Have (and Doesn't Want) Another Great
President. Politics during a presidential campaign is about telling
folks what they'd like to hear; governing is about what they're likely
to get. And Donald Trump the candidate operates in a fantasy world on
foreign policy bringing to the debate on America's role in the world a
fantastical mix of isolationist and muscular nationalist rhetoric.
Meanwhile back on planet earth, Donald Trump as president will confront
the same gap between words and deeds that faced his predecessors and the
constraints that impinge on any president at home and abroad. I fear the
unpredictability of a Trump presidency. (I can barely utter those words
in close proximity.) Still if I had to wager, I'd bet that in Trump's
case---as for most bullies, and this one highly inexperienced in foreign
policy---risk aversion rather than risk readiness will prevail in
response to an ISIS style Paris or Brussels attack in the United States.
I know it's going to come as a shocker, but I'm betting the Trumpian
response would be a lot closer to what Barack Obama might do than Bush
43. We've seen that movie before Iraq; Patriot Act; waterboarding,
torture; tens of thousands of ground forces deployed; trillions
expended. Outside of the torture he's endorsed, Trump has opposed
wasting money in the Middle East nation-building; sending large numbers
of U.S. troops, etc. I'd expect more air and missile strikes, maybe more
special operators to Iraq and Syria in a stepped up campaign to deprive
ISIS of territory. Where I do worry greatly is what Trump might do on
the domestic side in the wake of such an attack---his rhetoric on Arab
and Muslim Americans, and policies on surveillance and immigration.
Remember Denzell Washington in "The Siege" where the U.S. military takes
over New York City and rounds up thousands of Arab and Muslims
Americans? There's a Constitution and institutions in this country that
will prevent him from going as far as that, but Trump has so far proved
to be a divider not a uniter or a reassurer. In the wake of a
significant terror attack by, say, ISIS, we need a president who's tough
and wise and who can bring us together not drive us apart; and not play
into or fuel the inevitable anger and fear that's going to be directed
at Muslims. Lee Atwater said it best. There's this small boat which
includes a small group of individuals who have the character and stature
to be president. That applies doubly during a crisis. And Trump's not in
it. \*\*\* "Trump, a thin-skinned malignant narcissist who can leave no
slight unavenged ... is the candidate most likely to overreact to a
terrorist event" John Gartner is a private-practice psychologist,
part-time assistant professor of psychiatry at Johns Hopkins University
Medical School and author of In Search of Bill Clinton: A Psychological
Biography. Trump, a thin-skinned malignant narcissist who can leave no
slight unavenged, no matter how slight (God help us if Kim Jong-un makes
fun of his hands), is the candidate most likely to overreact to a
terrorist event or threat in an impulsive, misguided and heavy-handed
way that would win us enemies and influence people around the world to
hate us. For example, his proposal to "register" all Muslims in America
will humiliate a proud people and radicalize scores of young people.
Malignant narcissists are not your garden-variety narcissists. They
combine narcissism with paranoia, anti-social traits and a propensity
for aggression. Trump sees threats where they don't exist---like Mexican
immigrants who "might be ISIS"---and feels no compunctions about
breaking rules, such as those against torture or collective punishment,
to lash out at those imaginary threats. The Geneva Convention is for
politically correct suckers. The law of the jungle, not the rule of law,
is the organizing principle of malignant narcissists. And **[if they
can't rule the jungle they'll burn it down]{.underline}**. Malignant
narcissism is an untreatable personality disorder, for the simple reason
that no one can ever tell the malignant narcissist he is wrong. Anyone
who questions a malignant narcissist's judgment is immediately dismissed
as an idiot or attacked as a threat. Anyone who questions their ruthless
tactics is belittled as soft and naive. It's not accidental that Trump
has said "my primary consultant is myself." The appeal of narcissistic
leaders is real and understandable. In America we've had a history of
charismatic hypomanic narcissists, warm narcissists if you will, like TR
and FDR, who were positive forces of nature, leading the country out of
hard times by using their larger than life personalities to inspire a
faith in America that made us feel larger against our enemies, while
single handedly pushing the nation in a more progressive direction that
broadened democracy to include the needs and voices of the many. But
even malignant narcissists, who concentrate all the power in themselves,
can lend strength, inspire confidence and chart a collective direction
for their country. [Hitler took a dispirited defeated nation in the
throws of depression]{.underline} and with the promise [to make Germany
great again]{.underline} turned it into a world power. But the downsides
are unimaginable: Hitler also [replaced democracy with dictatorship,
tolerance with genocide, and sowed the seeds of his nations
destruction]{.underline} with his ruthless will to conquer. In short, a
president [Trump]{.underline} is one of the biggest threats imaginable
to our national security. His need to appear strong will make us weak. A
malignant narcissist is much like a malignant tumor. Sooner or later it
[will kill the body politic]{.underline}. \*\*\* "The nihilistic Trump,
who regards human beings as brutish children, might well react to a
terror attack like a brutish child" Michael D'Antonio is author of more
than a dozen nonfiction books, including Mortal Sins and Never Enough,
Donald Trump and the Pursuit of Success. Within moments of our first
meeting, Donald Trump told me that if he is guided by any principle it
is this: "**[If you hit me, I'll hit back, ten times
harder]{.underline}**." (I came to think of this as the Trump Rule of
Ten.) In subsequent meetings he added to what might be called a personal
philosophy with references to how much he enjoyed conflict---"**[I
always loved to fight]{.underline}**"---and his belief that people are
"inherently dishonest." Add Trump's frequent references to the
viciousness that dwells in the human heart and his belief that character
is fixed at roughly age six, and you can imagine of way Trump could
respond to a terror attack on America. The nihilistic Trump, who regards
human beings as brutish children, might well react to a terror attack
like a brutish child. President [Trump would pressure intelligence
agencies to immediately identify the source]{.underline} of the attack.
[Civil liberties may be suspended]{.underline} in the emergency pursuit
of information, suspects and conspirators. Those taken into custody
would be tortured, if Trump deemed it necessary. **[Speed would
be]{.underline}** an **[important]{.underline}** part of the Trump
response to terror, so [we should not expect]{.underline} much
[deliberation]{.underline} or consultation [with Congress or
allies]{.underline}. And given his penchant for disproportional warfare,
**[he would order a massive military response]{.underline}** just as
soon as he felt confident about a target. In such a scenario, **[the
destruction of an office tower in New York would be answered with the
annihilation of a city]{.underline}** controlled by those Trump deemed
to have sponsored the attack. To get a sense of how this might work,
**[imagine the Bush]{.underline}** administration's **[tragedy in Iraq
carried out in]{.underline}** a matter of **[weeks, not
years]{.underline}**. If **[the targets of such a crude and violent
response]{.underline}** follow the established script, they
**[would]{.underline}** then **[attack the West on a scale that would
make Brussels, and Paris, and San Bernardino seem like
rehearsals]{.underline}**. As the fight escalates, according to the
Trump Rule of Ten, Americans would truly experience the terror the
attackers intend. If the actions of the President Trump that I describe
above seem too awful to consider, hope resides in the idea that much of
what the man says and does is, to echo a term he recently used on CNN,
"show business." If this is true, then we might discount the bellicose
rhetoric and the marginal figures he has named as advisers. However,
this wish, that Trump doesn't mean what he says, is a poor foundation on
which to place our confidence in the future. We shouldn't have to guess
about our president's temper. \*\*\* "As a self-professed America
Firster, Trump seemingly thinks of statecraft in terms of
profit-and-loss. Yet with apologies to Clausewitz, international
politics is not the continuation of business by other means" Andrew
Bacevich is author of the new book America's War for the Greater Middle
East: A Military History, to be published on April 5. Unmoored to
principles and precedents, possessing a remarkably shallow grasp of
history, Donald Trump is unlikely to demonstrate much by way of the cool
calculation that successful crisis management requires. True, the actual
exercise of power can educate, as it did in the case of John F. Kennedy,
for example. By the time of the Cuban Missile Crisis, JFK's "pay any
price, bear any burden" inclinations had given way to let's make a deal:
my nukes in exchange for yours and let's not do this again. Whether
Trump is similarly educable stands as an open question. Confronted with
some unexpected threat, would he pause to evaluate the precipitating
factors? Kennedy did, and it served him well. Or would he give in to an
impulse to lash out? That describes the George W. Bush administration's
response to 9/11. To put it another way, would intellect or emotion
shape Trump's approach to making decisions? More than anything else, of
course, Trump prides himself in being the dealmaker par excellence. Yet
based on his recent pronouncements---casually proposing to revive the
practice of torture, for example, or speculating that Japan and South
Korea might consider acquiring nuclear weapons---he appears all but
incapable of appreciating the possibility of adverse second order
consequences. True, for anyone running for president, a certain amount
of shooting from the hip is to be expected. Trump is hardly the only
candidate making bold statements---carpet bomb ISIS, move the U.S.
embassy in Israel to Jerusalem on day one. But in most cases such
promises are offered less as a serious basis for action than as a way of
currying favor with particular constituencies. In Trump's case,
unfortunately, it's hard to tell if he's striking a pose or making
statements that he intends to be taken seriously. (To be fair, it's just
as hard to interpret various off-the-wall statements made by Trump's
immediate rival Ted Cruz). As a self-professed America Firster, Trump
seemingly thinks of statecraft in terms of profit-and-loss. Yet with
apologies to Clausewitz, international politics is not the continuation
of business by other means. The object of the exercise is not simply to
gain some immediate advantage at the expense of others, but to enhance
the freedom, abundance, and security enjoyed by the American people
while at the same time promoting conditions that others---allies and
adversaries alike---find tolerable. Surrounding himself with advisers
who are somewhat more---what's the word? seasoned? sane?---might
encourage Trump to curb his wilder inclinations. But who in their right
mind would sign up to serve in his administration? Probably people who
think like Trump. Now there's a scary prospect. \*\*\* "**[A 9/11-style
attack on U.S. soil would mean]{.underline}** that **[any remaining
restraints to the use]{.underline}** of **[weapons of mass
destruction]{.underline}** ... **[would likely be swiftly swept
aside]{.underline}**" Elizabeth Borgwardt is a history professor at
Washington University and the author of The Nuremberg Idea, forthcoming
from Knopf. Donald Trump's March 21 interview with the Washington Post
editorial board should make every potential voter's blood run cold.
After noting that ISIS should be knocked out flat, yet indicating that
large numbers of U.S. troops should not be involved, Mr.
[Trump]{.underline} [suggested]{.underline} that [it was better to be
"unpredictable" in the face of U.S. enemies]{.underline}, before twice
dodging a question about whether he would advocate the use of tactical
nuclear weapons against ISIS. (To be fair, the interview transcript
indicates that much more time was spent discussing Mr. Trump's hand size
than anything to do with nuclear weapons.) All this was before the
attacks in Belgium; my sense is that a 9/11-style attack on U.S. soil
would mean that any remaining restraints to the use of weapons of mass
destruction---**[including nuclear weapons]{.underline}**---would likely
be swiftly swept aside. General Douglas MacArthur had notoriously
floated the idea of using nuclear weapons against China in the Korean
conflict (1950-53) when he was concerned about Chinese moves to support
North Korean aggression. In posthumously published interviews, MacArthur
said that he could have won the war in ten days: "I would have dropped
30 or so atomic bombs ... strung across the neck of Manchuria. For at
least 60 years there could have been no land invasion of Korea from the
North." Part of MacArthur's logic was that the United States would have
needed to fight communist China eventually, so it would be best to nuke
them while they were still weak, recovering from World War II and the
Chinese Revolution (1949), as opposed to fighting them later after they
had become much stronger. "That makes sense to me!" opined a Trump
backer with whom I recently spoke on this topic. And yet, I offered,
most Americans today are probably pretty happy that we didn't use
nuclear weapons against China in the Korean war, or would be if they
knew anything about that historical interlude. "I guess," he said. "But
[why not press your advantage when you have one?]{.underline}" I offer
this example because my sense is that **[in a putative Trump
administration, "the gloves would be off" and all
barriers]{.underline}**---including public
opinion---**[to]{.underline}** the **[first use]{.underline}** of
various kinds of weapons of mass destruction **[would]{.underline}**
likely **[be at an all-time low]{.underline}**. Bruce Cumings, the
leading U.S. historian of Korea, has commented on the MacArthur incident
in an analysis from back in 2004. Cumings noted that "MacArthur sounds
like a warmongering lunatic" for advocating the use of nuclear weapons,
but also explained that, astonishing as it might seem, the general
actually had some support for his outlandish proposal. Cumings also
noted that MacArthur's conduct, quite appropriately, contributed to the
celebrated war hero's dismissal by President Truman. But that was then.
\*\*\* "[Trump's foreign policy inexperience]{.underline} and the proven
tendency of one thing to lead to another in military [interventions
could easily mean a protracted U.S. involvement in a **ground war in
Syria**]{.underline}" Paul Pillar is nonresident senior fellow at the
Brookings Institution and at the Center for Security Studies at
Georgetown University. From 2000 to 2005, as the national intelligence
officer for the Near East and South Asia, he was in charge of the
analysis of those regions for the CIA and all other American
intelligence agencies. In a Trump presidency, the potentially moderating
influence of the national security establishment will be far less
powerful than Trump's own ideas and the political demands of a scared,
fired-up public in the aftermath of a terrorist attack like 9/11. If we
know one thing about Trump, it's his talent for providing an outlet for
cruder, simpler and more emotional demands of the general public---and
we will likely see that talent in his counterterrorism policies in the
days following an attack on the scale of 9/11. Trump's statements about
the use of torture have been specific enough that after an attack he
would feel almost obliged to re-institute it in the military and
intelligence agencies if he had not done so already. There would be
significant resistance to doing so, of course, and given how the issue
has been viewed and discussed in the past couple of years it may seem
unlikely that Trump would succeed in making this change. But current
public and congressional views of the issue are much different from the
views that prevailed in the immediate aftermath of 9/11. In the
aftermath of another 9/11-type attack, public moods and thus tolerance
of torture are likely to revert to what they were back then. Assuming
any connection at all could be made between the attack and a foreign
location---such as the ISIL-controlled enclave in Syria---a Trump
administration would launch a major military assault on the ostensibly
relevant foreign targets. Although some of Trump's statements during the
campaign suggest an aversion to large ground wars and to anything that
smacks of nation-building, the subsequent political and operational
momentum may overtake the aversion. Trump's foreign policy inexperience
and the proven tendency of one thing to lead to another in military
interventions could easily mean a protracted U.S. involvement in a
ground war in Syria. President Trump's relations with allies and other
foreign states in the aftermath of an attack would resemble the "for us
or for the terrorists" attitude of the George W. Bush administration but
with the addition of a generous dose of Trumpian bombast. There would be
much wincing in foreign capitals as governments tried to strike a
balance between supporting an America that had just been attacked and
not appearing to be bullied by the man in the White House. The rest of
what would be a distinctively Trump response to an attack would be felt
domestically. This would be the occasion for a President Trump to do
whatever he had not already done in restricting immigration. Beyond
that, candidate Trump has given us little specific to go on, but it is
likely that the status of Muslims in America and their relations with
fellow citizens would become as delicate and fraught as they ever have
been. Islamophobia will likely surge and relationships between Muslim
communities and police will likely worsen. A President Trump would be
more likely to exacerbate than to smooth the fears and suspicions
involved. \*\*\* "As president, Mr. Trump would indeed project strength
... But he would be incapable of ... thoughtful self-restraint" Joe
Burgo is the author of several books, including The Narcissist You Know:
Defending Yourself Against Extreme Narcissists in an All-About-Me Age.
If he were president, Mr. Trump would respond to a 9/11-type terrorist
attack much as he has responded to personal attacks throughout the
campaign. He would be preoccupied with his self-image and the need to
come across as a "winner" and not a "loser" upon the world stage. On
some level, he would experience the attack as an assault on his own
stature, a blow to his grandiose self-image, and would likely respond
with reflexive violence, as he usually does when attacked. In this case,
rather than verbal assaults, it might involve massive "carpet bombings"
without adequate intelligence, and an immediate declaration of war. In
times of crisis, frightened citizens need their president to project an
image of strength and confidence; at the same time, they need him to
remain thoughtful and not respond in a reactionary, thoughtless way that
might make matters worse. As president, Mr. Trump would indeed project
strength by presenting himself as a take-charge strongman who knows how
to deal with terrorists. But he would be incapable of the kind of
thoughtful self-restraint we need from our president in a time of
crisis: For Trump, an attack requires an immediate and overwhelming
assault on the perceived source of the attack. When Megyn Kelly
criticized him, he responded with outsized contempt, indignation and
blame, the "weapons" he consistently uses to annihilate his enemies.
It's frightening to imagine what he would do to annihilate the source of
a terrorist attack were he to have a nuclear arsenal at his disposal.
\*\*\* "Trump has given no suggestion that he would be more prudent
\[than Bush\]. Nor, for that matter, has Ted Cruz" Stephen Kinzer is a
visiting fellow at the Watson Institute for International Studies at
Brown University. His books include All the Shah\'s Men: An American
Coup and the Roots of Middle East Terror and Reset: Iran, Turkey, and
America\'s Future. Even imagining the craziness that might seize
President Trump in the wake of a terror attack is frightening. Most
likely, his response would be at least as irrational as what George W.
Bush did after 9/11. Bush took radical steps that ultimately harmed the
United States far more profoundly than the attack itself. Trump has
given no suggestion that he would be more prudent. Nor, for that matter,
has Ted Cruz. More interesting is the effect that Trump's rhetoric might
have in attracting an attack. Wise terror strategists---and there
evidently are some---realize that over-reaction to an attack on the
United States would be in their interest. A crackdown that restricted
the civil liberties of American Muslims would allow militants to paint
the United States as a relentless enemy of Islam. So would an American
military assault in the Middle East, especially if it were carried out
with ground troops. These would be godsends to terrorist recruiters. If
the next American president projects an air of measured calm, and does
not seem ready to lash out wildly if provoked by a terror attack, such
an attack will be less likely. But if President Trump were in **[power,
setting off a bomb on the Washington Mall]{.underline}** would be a
great temptation. Terror groups in the Middle East, especially ISIS, are
eager **[to]{.underline}** **[bait the United States into another
self-defeating disaster like]{.underline}** the **[Iraq]{.underline}**
War. Trump seems ready to be baited---so why not try? \*\*\* "If history
is any lesson, Trump would alienate American allies ... undermining U.S.
efforts to work together with other countries to combat transnational
terrorism" Mary Dudziak is professor of law at Emory University and
chair in American law and governance at the Library of Congress. In
light of Donald Trump's tendency to react to problems by blaming
minority groups, including Muslims, and promoting torture, we might
expect more of the same, perhaps at a greater volume, than we've seen so
far. That would serve Trump and the nation poorly. The way the United
States treats minority groups has had an impact on U.S. foreign
relations in the past, and would be a problem in a Trump presidency.
President Dwight D. Eisenhower was just one president who had to
confront the impact of prejudice against African Americans, and civil
rights-related unrest, on America's image around the world. When white
mobs protested the integration of nine African American students at
Little Rock, Arkansas' Central High School in 1957, it became a major
international story. American discrimination was condemned around the
world. It was also used against American interests, as the Soviet Union
featured U.S. racism as a principal theme in its anti-U.S. propaganda.
Eisenhower had not supported judicial action to integrate schools; but
prodded by his secretary of state and others, he sent federal troops to
Little Rock. One of the reasons for his turnabout was his hope to
restore the global image of American democracy, and keep American racism
from harming the nation's Cold War mission. The Trump campaign has
already generated international criticism for its hostility to Muslims
and Mexican immigrants. His inflammatory calls for the use of torture
would damage U.S. credibility on human rights. If history is any lesson,
**[Trump would alienate American allies]{.underline}** with these
policies, [undermining U.S. efforts to work together]{.underline} with
other countries [to combat transnational terrorism]{.underline}. \*\*\*
"There would be no telegraphing of policy decisions to allow those
responsible to adjust. And there would be public justifications about
'limits' and 'proportionality'" Stanley Renshon is a political science
professor at the City University of New York, is a certified
psychoanalyst and the author of 15 books, most recently National
Security in the Obama Administration: Reassessing the Bush Doctrine.
Trump would be angry, much as George W. Bush was after the 9 /11
attacks, but much less methodical. He would order all available
assistance to the victims, take to the airwaves to assure the American
people that the attack would not go un-avenged and then proceed to do
something dramatic, public and lethal. There would be with Mr. Trump no
publically drawn red lines that he takes pride later in not crossing.
There would be no telegraphing of policy decisions to allow those
responsible to adjust. And there would be public justifications about
"limits" and "proportionality." **[At minimum]{.underline}**, the
response would involve **[dramatic airstrikes against previously
off-limit targets]{.underline}**---[oil rigs, training grounds
and]{.underline} even targets within [urban]{.underline} areas, if
necessary---and ramped-up commando raids against those enemies and their
supporters, primarily **[in Syria, but world-wide as
well]{.underline}**. If the attacks were committed by immigrants or
Americans, I wouldn't rule out his [asking Congress for much tighter
controls on immigration and even the loss of legal status and
citizenship]{.underline} for any supporters found to be involved. The
intended message would be stark: attack us and you and those who support
you will pay an unbearable price. This rough response would very likely
provide some comfort to Americans, as George W. Bush's strikes against
the Afghan government and his subsequent strategy of preemptive attacks
against imminent threats did after 9/11. It would also signal to
America's allies and opponents that Mr. Trump's view that the United
States should fight back against being taken advantage of were not mere
words, but reflected a real emotional conviction. Though kumbaya
internationalists might think differently, this might have a sobering
and therefore salutary effect on both free-riding allies and
ever-watchful enemies. That said, an important question that will follow
is this: after his display of resolve and revenge, what better policies
will he put into to place, domestically and with our allies abroad, to
lessen the risks of further attacks going forward? That, not his first
and understandable impulse, will be a true measure of his presidency and
his maturity as a leader and a president. \*\*\* "Trump appears to
employ **[a much more externalizing style]{.underline}**. ... When he is
threatened his primary response seems to be to fight back" W. Keith
Campbell is the head of the Department of Psychology at the University
of Georgia In the case of threat, people have two general patterns of
responding---externalizing and internalizing. Externalizing involves
[responding boldly and aggressively to the source of the
threat]{.underline}; internalizing involves responding by turning
inward, including feeling depressed or blaming oneself for the threat.
Trump appears to employ a much more externalizing style. (A caveat: My
answer is highly speculative and based on general psychological models
and my observations of Donald Trump on the campaign trail alone.) When
he is threatened his primary response seems to be to fight back. He does
this even in the case of threats that seem purely adolescent---when the
size of his fingers were challenged, for example. If, in fact, his
aggressive style applies to threats to himself, the next question is
whether that style would apply to threats beyond him. We saw a recent
incident where supporters of an opposing campaign used Trump's wife in a
hostile campaign message. Trump's response on Twitter was to make what
appeared to be a veiled threat against the opposing candidate's wife.
So, in this case he acted aggressively against a threat to his wife. It
is plausible, then, that he would act in the same way if America were
attacked or threatened and he were president. His reaction would be to
attack the source of the threat. We saw that with his Brussels response,
when he immediately called for tougher border control and anti-terror
measures. Both internalizing and externalizing have a place in good
leadership. Internalizing can be seen as thoughtful but also feckless.
Externalizing can be seen as strong but also impulsive. Outside forces
know that if they provoke an externalizing leader they are likely in for
a fight. Ideally, this will lead to less provocation (this is part of
the "peace through strength" model). But while this approach works well
when dealing with other nations, [it is less certain when dealing with
nationless terrorists who might actually be looking to provoke an
aggressive military response]{.underline}.

### Terrorism ext -- Reducing Sales Solves

#### Reducing arms sales could reduce terrorism.

[A decision by rich countries to cease arms trading "could help to

consequences of armed conflict]{.underline}," argues David Southall, a
paediatrician and expert in international maternal and child hospital
healthcare in **The BMJ**today. [Whilst a direct link between some of
the acts of terrorism committed against Western countries and the
lucrative arms trade]{.underline} can never be proven, "it is plausible
that it could be one of the responsible factors," he adds. Southall has
worked in the war zones of Pakistan and Afghanistan for more than 20
years and believes that [the sale of weapons to other countries where
armed conflict is already ongoing or where the potential for conflict is
likely, in order to make vast amounts of money, "is immoral,
unacceptable, and inevitably will lead to dangerous reactions, one of
which might be acts of terrorism."]{.underline}

### 2AC MPX Mod -- Ukraine

#### US arms sales increase tensions with Russia -- stopping arms sales are the only way to avoid great power war 

**Carpenter 9-10**-18 -- Senior fellow in defense and foreign policy
studies at the Cato Institute and a contributing editor at TAC (Ted
Galen Carpenter, American Conservative, "Washington Quietly Increases
Lethal Weapons to Ukraine,"
<https://www.cato.org/publications/commentary/washington-quietly-increases-lethal-weapons-ukraine)//AL>

For all of the loose (frequently hysterical) talk in Congress, the
foreign policy community, and the news media about President Donald
Trump's alleged eagerness to appease Vladimir Putin, [U.S. policy
remains as confrontational as ever toward Russia. Among other actions,
the Trump administration has involved U.S. forces in NATO military
exercises (war games) in Poland and other East European countries on
Russia's border, as well as in naval maneuvers [in the Black
Sea](https://www.nato.int/cps/en/natohq/news_154386.htm) near Russia's
sensitive naval base at Sevastopol. Washington has even sent U.S. troops
as participants in joint military exercises [with Ukrainian
forces](https://www.cnn.com/2017/09/11/politics/us-troops-ukraine-nato/index.html)---an
act that Moscow considers especially provocative]{.underline}, given its
tense relations with Kiev. [On no issue is the administration's risky
course more evident than its military policy toward
Ukraine.]{.underline} Recent measures are certain to provoke Moscow
further, and [entangle the United States to an unwise extent with an
extremely murky, ideologically troubling Ukrainian regime. Secretary of
Defense James Mattis acknowledges that U.S. instructors are [training
Ukrainian military
units](https://www.defense.gov/News/Article/Article/1431947/us-troops-training-ukrainian-soldiers-mattis-says/)
at a base in western Ukraine. Washington also has approved two important
arms sales to Kiev's ground forces in just the past nine months. The
first transaction in December 2017 was limited to small
arms]{.underline} that at least could be portrayed as purely defensive
weapons. That agreement included the export of Model M107A1 Sniper
Systems, ammunition, and associated parts and accessories, [a sale
valued at \$41.5 million. A transaction in April 2018 was more serious.
Not only was it larger [(\$47
million)](https://abcnews.go.com/International/us-announces-sale-anti-tank-missiles-ukraine-russian/story?id=53450406),
it included far more lethal weaponry, particularly [210 Javelin
anti-tank
missiles](https://www.rferl.org/a/javelin-missile-delivery-ukraine-us-confirmed/29200588.html)]{.underline}---the
kind of weapons that Barack Obama's administration had declined to give
Kiev[. Needless to say, the Kremlin [was not
pleased](https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/russia-issues-stern-warning-us-is-fueling-new-bloodshed-in-ukraine/2017/12/23/7e90f78a-40bf-4967-95f0-af840a23ec63_story.html?utm_term=.d3217d74b629)
about either sale. Moreover, Congress soon passed legislation in May
that authorized \$250 million in military assistance, including lethal
weaponry, to Ukraine in 2019.]{.underline} Congress had twice voted for
military support on a similar scale during the last years of Obama's
administration, but the White House blocked implementation. The Trump
administration cleared that obstacle out of the way in December 2017 at
the same time that it approved the initial small-weapons sale. The
passage of the May 2018 legislation means that the [path is now open for
a dramatic escalation of U.S. military backing for Kiev. On September 1,
former U.S. Ambassador to NATO Kurt Volker disclosed during an
[interview with The
Guardian](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/aug/31/ukraine-kurt-volker-us-arms-supplies)
that Washington's future military aid to Kiev would likely involve
weapons sales to Ukraine's air force and navy as well as the
army.]{.underline} "The Javelins are mainly symbolic and it's not clear
if they would ever be used," Aric Toler, a research scholar at the
Atlantic Council,
[asserted](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/aug/31/ukraine-kurt-volker-us-arms-supplies).
One could well dispute his sanguine conclusion, but even Toler conceded:
"Support for the Ukrainian navy and air defence would be a big deal.
That would be far more significant." Volker's cavalier attitude about
U.S. arms sales to a government locked in a crisis with Russia
epitomizes the arrogance and tone-deaf nature of the views that too many
U.S. foreign policy officials exhibit regarding the sensitive Ukraine
issue. "We can have a conversation with Ukraine like we would with any
other country about what do they need. I think that there's going to be
some discussion about naval capability because as you know their navy
was basically taken by Russia \[when the Soviet Union dissolved\]. And
so they need to rebuild a navy and they have very limited air capability
as well. I think we'll have to look at air defence." One suspects that
Americans would be incensed at comparable actions by Moscow if the
geo-strategic situations were reversed. Imagine if Russia (even a
democratic Russia) had emerged from the wreckage of the Cold War as the
undisputed global superpower, and a weakened United States had to watch
as the Kremlin expanded a powerful, Russian-led military alliance to
America's borders, conducted alliance war games within sight of U.S.
territory, interfered in Canada's internal political affairs to oust a
democratically elected pro-American government, and then pursued growing
military ties with the new, anti-U.S. government in Ottawa. Yet that
would be disturbingly similar to what Washington has done regarding NATO
policy and U.S. relations with Ukraine. Moreover, although Kiev's
cheerleaders in the Western (especially U.S.) media like to portray
Ukraine as a beleaguered democracy that plays the role of David to
Russia's evil Goliath, the reality is far murkier. Putin's government
overstates matters when it alleges that Ukraine's 2014 Maidan revolution
was a U.S.-orchestrated coup that brought outright fascists to power in
Kiev. Nevertheless, that version contains more than a little truth.
Prominent, powerful U.S. figures, most notably the late Senator John
McCain and Assistant Secretary of State for European and Eurasian
Affairs Victoria Nuland, [openly
sided](https://www.cato.org/publications/commentary/americas-ukraine-hypocrisy)
with demonstrators seeking to unseat Ukraine's elected government.
Indeed, Nuland was [caught on
tape](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-26079957) with U.S.
Ambassador to Ukraine Geoffrey Pyatt scheming about the desired
composition of a new government in Kiev. It is unfair to portray
Ukraine's current administration led by President Petro Poroshenko as a
neo-fascist regime. Post-revolution elections appear to have been
reasonably free and fair, and there are major factions that are
committed to genuine democratic values. But [Ukraine also is hardly a
model of Western-style democracy. Not only is it afflicted with
extensive graft and corruption, but some extreme nationalist and even
[neo-Nazi
groups](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-cohen-ukraine-commentary/commentary-ukraines-neo-nazi-problem-idUSKBN1GV2TY)
play a significant role in the "new" Ukraine.]{.underline} The
notoriously fascist Azov Battalion, for example, continues to occupy a
prominent position in Kiev's efforts to defeat separatists in Ukraine's
eastern Donbass region. [Alexander Zakharchenko, prime minister of the
self-declared Donetsk People's Republic in the pro-Russia rebel-occupied
city of Donetsk, [was assassinated on September
1](https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/europe/pro-russian-rebel-leader-killed-in-eastern-ukraine-blast/2018/08/31/12a18336-ad37-11e8-b1da-ff7faa680710_story.html?utm_term=.fc482a2c6bab)
and officials there and in Russia are blaming Kiev. The Ukrainian
government has denied involvement.]{.underline} Other ultranationalist
factions act as domestic militias that attempt to intimidate more
moderate Ukrainians. Even [the Poroshenko government itself has adopted
troubling censorship measures and other autocratic policies. Officials
in both the Obama and Trump administration have taken a much too casual
attitude toward [U.S.
cooperation](https://www.thenation.com/article/americas-collusion-with-neo-nazis/)
with extremist elements and a deeply flawed Ukrainian government. Both
the danger of stoking tensions with Moscow and becoming too close to a
regime in Kiev that exhibits disturbing features should caution the
Trump administration against boosting military aid to Ukraine. It is an
unwise policy on strategic as well as moral grounds. Trump
administration officials should refuse to be intimidated or stampeded
into forging a risky and unsavory alliance with Kiev]{.underline} out of
fear of being portrayed as excessively "soft" toward Russia[. Instead,
the president and his advisers need to spurn efforts to increase U.S.
support for Ukraine.]{.underline} A good place to start would be to
restore the Obama administration's refusal to approve arms sales to
Kiev. [Washington must not pour gasoline on a geo-strategic fire that
could lead to a full-blown crisis between the United States and
Russia.]{.underline}

#### Nuclear war -- we're on the brink now

**Burns 19** \[Robert Burns, National Security Writer at The Associated
Press, 4-14-2019, \"The chill in US-Russia relations has some worried

[WASHINGTON --- It has the makings of a new Cold War, or
worse.]{.underline} The [deep chill in U.S.-Russian relations is
stirring concern in some quarters that Washington and Moscow are in
danger of stumbling into an armed confrontation]{.underline} that, by
mistake or miscalculation, could lead to nuclear war. American and
European analysts and current and former U.S. military officers say the
nuclear superpowers need to talk more. [A foundational [arms control
agreement is being
abandoned](https://www.militarytimes.com/news/your-military/2019/02/13/nato-is-getting-ready-for-a-russia-with-a-lot-more-missiles/)
and the last major limitation on strategic nuclear weapons could go away
in less than two years. Unlike during the Cold War, when generations
lived under threat of a nuclear Armageddon, the two militaries are
barely on speaking terms. \"During the Cold War, we understood each
other\'s signals. We talked,\"]{.underline} says the top NATO commander
in Europe, U.S. Army Gen. Curtis Scaparrotti, who is about to retire.
[\"I\'m concerned that we don\'t know them as well today.\"]{.underline}
Scaparrotti, in his role as [Supreme Allied Commander
Europe](https://www.defensenews.com/congress/2019/03/05/top-us-general-seeks-more-troops-warships-in-europe-to-counter-russia/),
has met only twice with Gen. Valery Gerasimov, the chief of the Russian
general staff, but has spoken to him by phone a number of other times.
\"I personally think communication is a very important part of
deterrence,\" Scaparrotti said, referring to the idea that adversaries
who know each other\'s capabilities and intentions are less likely to
fall into conflict. \"So, I think we should have more communication with
Russia. It would ensure that we understand each other and why we are
doing what we\'re doing.\" He added: \"It doesn\'t have to be a lot.\"
[The United States and Russia, which together control more than 90
percent of the world\'s nuclear weapons]{.underline}, say that in August
[they will leave the 1987 treaty that banned an entire class of nuclear
weapons.]{.underline} And there appears to be little prospect of
extending the 2010 New Start treaty that limits each side\'s strategic
nuclear weapons. [After a period of post-Cold War cooperation on nuclear
security and other defense issues, the relationship between Washington
and Moscow took a nosedive, particularly after Russian forces entered
the former Soviet republic of Georgia in 2008. Tensions spiked with
Russia's annexation of the Crimea in 2014 and its [military intervention
in eastern
Ukraine](https://www.militarytimes.com/news/your-military/2018/11/26/russias-conflict-with-ukraine-an-explainer/).
In response, Congress in 2016 severely limited military cooperation with
Russia.]{.underline} The law prohibits \"military-to-military
cooperation\" until the secretary of defense certifies that Russia \"has
ceased its occupation of Ukrainian territory\" and \"aggressive
activities.\" The law was amended last year to state that it does not
limit military talks aimed at \"reducing the risk of conflict.\"
Relations frayed even further amid U.S. allegations that Russia
interfered in the 2016 U.S. presidential election, although President
Donald Trump has doubted Russian complicity in what U.S. intelligence
agencies assert was an effort by Moscow to boost Trump's chances of
winning the White House. After a [Helsinki summit with
Putin](https://www.militarytimes.com/news/pentagon-congress/2018/07/18/trump-backs-down-under-fire-clarifies-on-russia-meddling/)
in July, Trump publicly accepted the Kremlin leader's denial of
interference. Marine Gen. Joseph Dunford, chairman of the Joint Chiefs
of Staff, said in an interview Friday that Russian behavior is to blame
for the strained relationship. \"It\'s very difficult for us to have
normal relationships with a country that has not behaved normally over
the last few years,\" Dunford said. \"There are major issues that affect
our bilateral relationship that have to be addressed, to include where
Russia has violated international laws, norms and standards.\" Dunford
said he speaks regularly with Gerasimov, his Russian counterpart, and
the two sides talk on other levels. \"I\'m satisfied right now with our
military-to-military communication to maintain a degree of transparency
that mitigates the risk of miscalculation,\" he said. \"I think we have
a framework within to manage a crisis, should one occur, at the senior
military-to-military level.\" James Stavridis, a retired Navy admiral
who was the top NATO commander in Europe from 2009 to 2013, says the
West must confront Russia where necessary, including on its
interventions in Ukraine and Syria. [But he believes there room for
cooperation on multiple fronts, including [the
Arctic](https://www.militarytimes.com/news/your-navy/2019/04/04/with-missiles-pointing-out-to-sea-northern-clover-stakes-russian-claim-on-arctic-waters/)
and arms control. **\"We are in danger of stumbling backward into a Cold
War that is to no one\'s advantage,**\" he said in an email exchange.
\"Without steady, political-level engagement between the defense
establishments, the risk of a true new Cold War rises
steadily.\"]{.underline} No one is predicting a deliberate Russian act
of war in Europe, but the decline in regular talks is a worry to many.
Moscow says it is ready to talk. [\"**Russia remains open for
interaction aimed at de-escalating tension, restoring mutual trust,
preventing any misinterpretations of one another\'s intentions, and
reducing the risk of dangerous incidents**]{.underline},\" the Russian
Ministry of Foreign Affairs said in a statement last week in response to
NATO\'s 70th anniversary celebration. Sam Nunn, who served in the Senate
as a Democrat from Georgia from 1972 to 1997, argues that dialogue with
Russia is too important to set aside, even if it carries domestic
political risk. \"You can\'t call time out,\" he said in an interview.
\"The nuclear issues go on, and they\'re getting more dangerous.\" Nunn
co-wrote an opinion piece with former Secretary of State George Shultz
and former Defense Secretary William Perry arguing that the U.S. and its
allies and Russia are caught in a \"policy paralysis\" that could lead
to a military confrontation and potentially the first use of nuclear
weapons since the U.S. bombed Japan in August 1945. [\"A bold policy
shift is needed,\" they wrote in the Wall Street Journal on Thursday,
\"to support a strategic re-engagement with Russia and walk back from
this perilous precipice. Otherwise, our nations may soon be entrenched
in a nuclear standoff more precarious, disorienting and economically
costly than the Cold War.\"]{.underline} A group of U.S., Canadian,
European and Russian security experts and former officials in February
issued a call for talks with Russia on crisis management. [\"The risks
of mutual misunderstanding and unintended signals that stem from an
absence of dialogue relating to crisis management \... are real,\" the
Euro-Atlantic Security Leadership Group said in a statement. It said
this could lead to conventional war with Russia or, in a worst case
scenario, "**the potential for nuclear threats, or even nuclear use,
where millions could be killed in minutes."**]{.underline}

### 2AC MPX Mod -- Yemen

#### US Arms Sales directly contribute to the Yemen crisis -- 10,000 people have died and 27 million are on the brink of famine

them more,"

[At least 140 people perished here in the Yemeni capital last fall when
a Saudi Arabian-led military coalition carried out a pair of [airstrikes
on a

Human rights groups labeled the attack a possible war crime and said the
bombs used were manufactured in the United States. The
[attack](http://www.latimes.com/world/la-fg-yemen-airstrike-march-20161009-snap-story.html),]{.underline}
one of the deadliest for civilians in the coalition\'s relentless air
war against Iranian-backed rebels in Yemen, [helped persuade the Obama
administration in December to block the sale of precision-guided
munitions to the Saudi military until it addresses problems with its
targeting. But the hold was lifted last month, when President Trump
announced a \$110-billion package of [proposed military sales to the
kingdom](http://www.latimes.com/world/middleeast/la-fg-yemen-us-arms-2017-story.html),
part of an effort to shore up a regional alliance against a resurgent
Iran. The decision has left many among Yemen\'s increasingly desperate
population feeling abandoned and betrayed.]{.underline} \"There is
nothing in this world that I hate more than Americans,\" Ali Mohammed
Murshed, a 32-year-old deliveryman in Sana, said as he paused to take in
the reception hall\'s charred and mangled frame on his way to visit a
friend. Murshed used to rent a house nearby, but fled with his family to
an in-law\'s home after their windows were blown out in the attack.
\"With all the arms they have given to Saudi Arabia, the Saudis have
achieved nothing after more than two years but killing civilians and
destroying infrastructure,\" he complained bitterly. [The State
Department says the arms package, announced during Trump\'s [recent
visit](http://www.latimes.com/nation/la-fg-trump-saudi-20170519-story.html)
to the Saudi capital, Riyadh, will help a key Middle East ally defend
itself against \"malign Iranian influence\" and contribute to
counter-terrorism operations across the region.]{.underline} In addition
to replenishing the kingdom\'s dwindling supply of precision-guided
bombs, the administration is offering howitzer artillery pieces,
Blackhawk helicopters and the antimissile system known as Terminal High
Altitude Area Defense, or THAAD. [The Saudis say they need the weaponry
to defend themselves against Yemeni rebels, who they charge are being
armed by Shiite Muslim Iran in a bid to increase its clout against the
region\'s Sunni monarchies.]{.underline} The rebels, known as Houthis,
surged out of their northern strongholds in September 2014 and seized
control of Yemen\'s capital with the help of rogue elements of the armed
forces loyal to the country\'s deposed strongman, Ali Abdullah Saleh.
Six months later, Saudi Arabia assembled a military coalition to restore
power to the internationally recognized president, Abdu Rabu Mansour
Hadi, who set up a parallel government in Yemen\'s southern port city of
Aden. The Houthis have lobbed thousands of mortar shells and rockets
into Saudi territory in response to the coalition\'s campaign and
claimed to have aimed a ballistic missile at Riyadh the day before Trump
arrived. (The strike was not successful.) \"We don\'t want people to
think we are purchasing weapons to have influence,\" said a high-ranking
Saudi defense official who was not authorized to discuss the deal
publicly. \"We respect the sovereignty of countries. But if there is a
threat to our borders, we need to defend ourselves.\" [Although all
sides in the war stand accused of abuses, United Nations officials
attribute most of the heavy civilian toll to the air campaign waged by
Saudi Arabia and its Persian Gulf allies. The fighting has killed more
than 10,000 people, destroyed vital infrastructure and pushed what was
already the Arab world\'s poorest nation to the brink of a [humanitarian
catastrophe](http://www.latimes.com/world/middleeast/la-fg-yemen-houthis-port-20170505-story.html).
Nearly a quarter of Yemen\'s 27 million people are \"one step away from
famine,\" U.N. humanitarian chief Stephen O\'Brien told the Security
Council last month. The economy is collapsing; government employees have
not been paid for months; prices for [food and
fuel](http://www.latimes.com/world/middleeast/la-fg-yemen-houthis-port-20170505-story.html)
have skyrocketed; half the country\'s health facilities are closed and a
raging cholera epidemic is killing hundreds. \"This is not an unforeseen
or coincidental result of forces beyond our control,\" O\'Brien said.
\"It is a direct consequence of actions of the parties and supporters of
the conflict]{.underline}.\"

President Trump seems to be obsessed with the alleged economic benefits
of the weapons trade. Given its numerous mentions of creating jobs,
making life easier for weapons contractors, and bolstering the U.S.
defense industrial base, one might think the Trump administration's new
directive is a statement of economic policy rather than a carefully
crafted expression of national security concerns. [It's not that human
rights considerations are completely absent in the new policy statement,
but **the document sets an extremely low bar. The directive calls for
observing existing law regarding human rights and arms transfers,
without pointing to specific sections of the law or how they will be
interpreted.** Thankfully, the Trump policy statement indicates that the
U.S. will not sell weapons to nations that may use them to commit
genocide or otherwise violate the laws of war. But this is hardly a
ringing endorsement of making human rights a major factor in arms sales
decisions, **and it is a far cry from the multiple mentions of human

human rights-based suspensions of sales to Saudi Arabia, Bahrain, and
Nigeria that had been imposed during the Obama era. The Saudi case is a
litmus test of whether human rights and broader security concerns will
have any role at all in the Trump administration's approach to arms
trading. The United States has long been a [top

that Saudi actions in Yemen "look like war crimes," which should be
reason enough for the Trump administration to stop selling arms that can
be used to prosecute the war in Yemen, even by the standards of its own,
watered-down policy statement. Arms sales decisions should be about
security, not jobs. [But **if jobs are going to be introduced as a

" Disappearing transparency in U.S. arms sales,"
https://www.lawfareblog.com/disappearing-transparency-us-arms-sales, mm

At the beginning of this year, the [Trump]{.underline} administration
[notified Congress of its plans to loosen the regulatory controls
on]{.underline} some U.S. [firearms exports]{.underline} and transfer
jurisdiction of these exports to the Commerce Department. This move
means that Congress will lose its oversight role on important and deadly
U.S. weapons, which in the past had allowed them to stop certain
problematic exports to Turkey and the Philippines. If anything, U.S.
weapons exports deserve higher scrutiny, rather than being treated as
mere business transactions and reduced to a streamlined export process
similar to that of tractor exportation. Controversies surrounding the
recipients, use and diversion of arms sales are by no means a new
phenomenon. What makes Trump's policies and abuse of power so dangerous
is the new precedent his administration has set allowing the executive
branch to make foreign policy decisions unilaterally. In effect, [arms
sales are now driving U.S. foreign policy instead of being used as a
tool for it.]{.underline} [The repercussions from this reversal could be
disastrous]{.underline}. [On top of eroding American values and
diminishing U.S. credibility]{.underline} among its partners, [some
countries have learned how to leverage our own "tool" against
us]{.underline}. Both [Turkey and Saudi Arabia have used their
geostrategic position to extract American arms, manipulate the terms of
U.S. arms sales, and play the United States against other powers all
while their human rights violations continue unabated]{.underline}. And
it's not just foreign governments that are finding it increasingly easy
to manipulate U.S. foreign policy; the Trump administration's policies
allow the U.S. defense industry, already highly adept at playing this
game, to maximize its profits at the expense of conflict and turmoil
around the world.

#### The new policy ensures arms will be sent to HR violators 

**Stohl 18** (Rachel Stohl

Program, 4/30/18,
<https://www.justsecurity.org/55496/trump-administrations-weapons-export-policies-stress-benefit-u-s-economy/>)

The new CAT policy outlines the purpose of arms sales, and places a keen
emphasis on the anticipated economic benefits of weapons transfers. As
the policy asserts, the purpose of arms transfers (under the Trump
administration) is to help the United States: "maintain a technological
edge over potential adversaries; strengthen partnerships that preserve
and extend our global influence; bolster our economy; spur research and
development; enhance the ability of the defense industrial base to
create jobs; increase our competitiveness in key markets; protect our
ability to constrain global trade in arms that is destabilizing or that
threatens our military, allies, or partners; and better equip our allies
and partners to contribute to shared security objectives and to enhance
global deterrence." These priorities sound reasonable in theory, but
[the arms trade does not work like the trade in cars or bananas. **A
focus on short-term economic benefits overlooks the realities of the
global arms trade, in which the wares being sold and transferred endure
long after the transfer is completed and can be used to promote or
undermine U.S. interests.** Recent transfers of weapons and vehicles
supplied to the Iraqi military, which were then seized by ISIS and used
against U.S. troops and interests is but one in a long book of
cautionary tales.]{.underline} Although the policy reflects themes
contained in the 2014 CAT policy, albeit with a significant bent towards
economic security as the frame, there is one significant addition.
Notably, [the policy includes an explicit reference to reducing the risk
of civilian harm]{.underline} that might stem from the transfer and use
of conventional weapons[, stating that it is the policy of the executive
branch to "facilitate ally and partner efforts, through United States
sales and security cooperation efforts, to reduce the risk of national
or coalition operations causing civilian harm."]{.underline} [This
represents the first such mention of civilian harm in a policy related
to arms transfers.]{.underline} The implementation of this will be
highly scrutinized, however, as we have already seen significant
civilian harm from U.S. weapons transferred to Saudi Arabia for use in
Yemen, for example, among other transfers of concern. The policy
contains criteria to guide U.S. arms transfer decisions, which remain
largely consistent with the criteria captured in the 2014 CAT policy.
They include U.S. national security, U.S. economic security and
innovation, relationship with allies and partners, human rights and
international humanitarian law, and non-proliferation. [Where these
criteria differ from previous policy pronouncements is again in the
framing, with the Trump administration focusing on the benefits, rather
than the risks, of arms exports.]{.underline} Perhaps [the **most
consequential effect of this approach** is that the Trump administration
**will no longer require the past behavior of a recipient State to be
factored into arms transfer decisions, which**]{.underline} seemingly
**[disregards statutory requirements to factor the past behavior of a
recipient State into an arms transfer decision]{.underline}.** Indeed,
**[the 2018 CAT policy eliminates a decision-making criterion from the
2014 policy that examined a recipient State's record of behavior on
human rights, counterterrorism, and the potential for
misuse]{.underline}**. Rather, the policy focuses on the potential
future risk of a transfer. [Past behavior is therefore overlooked if
governments promise to try harder]{.underline} not to intentionally
cause harm. In effect, [the message is that as long as future
transgressions are not intentional, if a transfer is in the economic
interest of the United States, potential risks can easily be
overlooked.]{.underline}

### AT "Trump Can't Wield Soft Power"

#### Trump can wield soft power

Andras **Simonya**, 1/2/**17**, the hill, "trump can surprise world by
using hard and soft power equally,"
https://thehill.com/blogs/pundits-blog/international/312399-trump-can-surprise-world-by-using-hard-and-soft-power,
mm

[It has been suggested that]{.underline} Donald [Trump will]{.underline}
be a president who will [focus on \"hard power]{.underline}\" to
underpin his foreign policy goals [rather than focusing on \"soft
power,\"]{.underline} which was Obama\'s preference. Both approaches are
one-sided, though, and both are wrong. The United States cannot just use
this or that; it needs to use both. Hard or soft, it\'s about power,
period. Time and again, we must remember how communism was defeated by a
combination of hard and soft power tools, the attraction of Western
freedoms, and a steadfast NATO, the U.S.-led Western military alliance.
While taking a strong stance on security and defense, [Trump needs
deploy]{.underline} American [soft power]{.underline} institutionally
[in his foreign policy]{.underline}. It is wrong to think that the
Russian \"attacks\" on the West are just temporary or tactical. They are
strategic, long-term and disruptive. Russia seems to have mastered our
abilities of the past, studied it well, combined it with new
technologies and made it highly effective. Expelling Russian diplomats
and \"experts\" is hardly the right response --- it is benign, soft and
short-term; too little, too late. Russian President Vladimir Putin
laughs at it. The grossly underestimated Russians have designed a
sophisticated toolbox of mixed power, with multiple tools and the
ability and infrastructure to deploy them. They have a design for each
country: The one for the United States is different from the one for
Hungary and still different from the ones designed for France or
Germany. But at all times, Russia has also combined the two ends of the
spectrum of power, like RT (its government-sponsored foreign TV network)
and the invasion of Ukraine simultaneously. While the Russian population
is living in a stagnant society both in terms of its economic situation
and in terms of democracy and the rule of law, Putin has not ceased to
spend money on, and use, the external factors of big-power politics. The
Obama administration was wrong about its perception of the world: The
idea that goodwill and goodness will be rewarded and reciprocated by
goodwill and goodness. This has led the West as a whole down a wrong
path; a dead-end street. It\'s time to make a U-turn. The successes of
Russia are in part the result of its sophistication but also a result of
the naivete of our democratic and liberal societies, the misguided
priorities of mainstream liberals in America and Europe. I have no idea
what the real Trump foreign policy will be. At this point, I come down
on the side of those who suggest that yes, the president-elect should
keep the world guessing, and should not reveal his intentions. He should
also rethink possibilities and opportunities and regroup the tools in
America\'s toolbox. I am indeed worried about the idea of a grand
bargain in the relationship between Russia and the West. Russian
history, and indeed Putin\'s own personal history, suggests that this is
a bad idea. Putin needs to be told in no uncertain terms that it\'s
future aggressions in Europe will be pushed back by military force. We
will not tolerate its interference into our democracies. It should also
be made clear that we are for cooperation, when certain conditions are
met, and that we will make every effort to figure out how to do this.
But then, [the two aspects of power politics need to be locked in
tigh]{.underline}t --- not as a matter of choice, but rather of
neccesity. Trump will also have to make it very clear that Russian
communication has no free reign in our societies. No, Putin cannot
interfere in our election process. RT and Russian social media cannot
spread lies and propaganda in our midst, while our communication in
Russia is hampered and restricted and journalists with dissenting views
are constantly harassed. Before he announces his policies toward Russia,
Trump should also put together a high-powered team to rethink how best
to make use of the combined power toolbox. He of all politicians is well
positioned to put communication to use for the advancement of American
and thus Western interests. [He is a master communicator]{.underline},
[and]{.underline} what worked in the election campaign (no, it wasn\'t
beautiful, but it was effective) [should now be used in his
international efforts.]{.underline} But this is no longer a one-man
show. He will need to involve players from a vast field. I remember the
enormous success of Nancy Brinker, former U.S. ambassador to Hungary,
who used her Susan G. Komen breast cancer organization to promote her
country and American values while working with the Hungarians on hard
military cooperation in Iraq and Afghanistan. She remains highly popular
in Hungary. That\'s the way to do it. No, this is not a return to the
past, but we can learn a lot from it. It is well-known how American
rock-\'n\'-roll culture, Levi\'s blue jeans, and cultural and scientific
contacts were part of the \"war effort\" during the Cold War. So even if
he doesn\'t know it, the president-elect is actually trying to work out
a detente with the Russians. But then his friend, former Secretary of
State Henry Kissinger, should tell him why detente worked: only because
the \"three baskets\" (strategic-military, economic and human-cultural)
were working hand in hand. President-elect Donald [Trump
should]{.underline} now [surprise the world and embrace the combination
of hard and soft power, and use it in his usual, hardheaded
manner.]{.underline}

### AT "Arms Sales k2 Influence"

#### Export controls are weak -- can't influence how other countries use our arms 

**Holden**, Paul. **2017**, Indefensible : Seven Myths that Sustain the
Global Arms Trade, Zed Books, p. 57-58, mm

Many weapons last a long time. If well-maintained, a gun can carry on
shooting for years, sometimes decades. Small arms and light weapons
(SALW) are particularly long-lived, but many mechanical weapons systems
are built to withstand hard conditions, neglect, and wear and tear.
Unexploded munitions from World War I battlefields were still killing
French and Belgian farmers into the 21st century. Kalashnikovs and
mortars from the 1960s can still function if they are given a basic
service and cleaning. Thus, if arms are to be supplied to an ally there
needs to be a reasonable likelihood that the receiver will remain an
ally for many decades to come, and won't be tempted to sell them on to a
less reliable customer--- perhaps when the ally wants to refurbish its
armory with newer weapons and discard its old stock. There also needs to
be enough capacity in the recipient state to make sure that arms are
used as intended, and not passed on or 'lost' by its military personnel.
Unfortunately, [too often the long-term security interests of the
supplier country take a backseat to the interests of the defense
companies and/or special interests looking to see weapons sold. The
consequences--- fighting enemies armed with weapons you supplied--- can
be severe. Despite the repeated claims that strong export controls in
places like the US and Europe prevent weapons getting into questionable
hands, the historical experience shows that the controls are often
weakly enforced]{.underline}. [Once you sift through the sordid history
of double-dealing and deadly conflict, it becomes clear that there are
multiple avenues by which arms can get into the wrong
hands.]{.underline} You may be asking: 'but what about that Arms Trade
Treaty we heard about? Didn't this take care of these issues?'
Unfortunately, no. The Treaty, discussed at the end of the chapter, is
full of holes, watered down after years of negotiation into a tool that
will achieve little good, and maybe even more bad.

#### Arms sales won't influence other states or promote American influence -- can't control how other states act 

A. Trevor **Thrall and** Caroline **Dorminey**, 3/13/18, \[Thrall is an
associate professor at the Schar School of Policy and Government at
George Mason; Dorminey is a policy analyst at the Cato Institute-, Cato
Institute, "risky business: the role of arms sales in US foreign
policy,"
https://www.cato.org/publications/policy-analysis/risky-business-role-arms-sales-us-foreign-policy,
mm

[Attempts to manage the balance of power and generate influence around
the world are heavily contingent on a number of factors, **most of which
lie outside American control.**]{.underline} Upon closer review, most of
the benefits of arms sales are less certain and less compelling than
advocates claim. [The hidden assumption underlying the balance of power
strategy is that the United States will be able to predict]{.underline}
accurately [what the impact of its arms sales will be.]{.underline} If
the goal is deterrence, for example, the assumption is that an arms sale
will be sufficient to deter the adversary without spawning an arms race.
If the goal is to promote stability, the assumption is that an arms sale
will in fact reduce tensions and inhibit conflict rather than inflame
tensions and help initiate conflict. These assumptions, in turn, depend
on both the recipient nation and that nation's neighbors and adversaries
acting in ways that don't make things worse. As it turns out, [these
are]{.underline} often [poor assumptions]{.underline}. Although arms
sales certainly enhance the military capability of the recipient nation,
[the fundamental problem is that arms sales often initiate a long chain
of responses that the United States generally cannot
control]{.underline}. The United States, after all, is not the only
country with interests in regional balances, especially where the
survival and security of local actors is at stake. [The United States is
neither the only major power with a keen interest in critical regions
like Asia and the Middle East, nor the only source of weapons and other
forms of assistance]{.underline}. Nor can it dictate the perceptions,
interests, or actions of the other nations involved in a given region.
For example, though a nation receiving arms from the United States may
enjoy enhanced defensive capabilities, it is also likely to enjoy
enhanced offensive capabilities. With these, a nation's calculations
about the potential benefits of war, intervention abroad, or even the
use of force against its own population may shift decisively. Saudi
Arabia's recent behavior illustrates this dynamic. Though the Saudis
explain their arms purchases as necessary for defense against Iranian
pressure, Saudi Arabia has also spent the past two years embroiled in a
military intervention in Yemen. [Likewise, arms sales can heighten
regional security dilemmas.]{.underline} Neighbors of nations buying
major conventional weapons will also worry about what this enhanced
military capability will mean. This raises the chances that they too
will seek to arm themselves further, or take other steps to shift the
balance of power back in their favor, or, in the extreme case, to launch
a preventive war before they are attacked. [Given these dynamics, the
consequences of arms sales to manage regional balances of power are far
less predictable and often much less positive than advocates
assume]{.underline}.54 This unpredictability characterizes even
straightforward-seeming efforts to manage the balance of power. The most
basic claim of arms sales advocates is that U.S. arms sales to friendly
governments and allies should make them better able to deter
adversaries. The best available evidence, however, suggests a more
complicated reality. [In a study of arms sales from 1950 to 1995,
major-power arms sales to existing allies had no effect on the chance
that the recipient would be the target of a military
attack]{.underline}. Worse, recipients of U.S. arms that were not treaty
allies were significantly more likely to become targets.55 [Nor is there
much evidence that arms sales can help the United States promote peace
and regional stability by calibrating the local balance of
power.]{.underline} On this score, in fact, the evidence suggests that
the default assumption should be the opposite. Most scholarly work
concludes that arms sales exacerbate instability and increase the
likelihood of conflict.56 One study, for example, found that during the
Cold War, U.S. and Soviet arms sales to hostile dyads (e.g.,
India/Pakistan, Iran/Iraq, Ethiopia/Somalia) "contributed to hostile
political relations and imbalanced military relationships" and were
"profoundly destabilizing."57 [There is also good reason to believe that
several factors are making the promotion of regional stability through
arms sales more difficult. The shrinking U.S. military advantage over
other powers such as China and the increasingly competitive global arms
market both make it less likely that U.S. arms sales can make a decisive
difference]{.underline}. As William Hartung argued as early as 1990,
"the notion of using arms transfers to maintain a carefully calibrated
regional balance of power seems increasingly archaic in today's arms
market, in which a potential U.S. adversary is as likely to be receiving
weapons from U.S. allies like Italy or France as it is from former or
current adversaries."58 In sum, [the academic and historical evidence
indicates that although the United States can use arms sales to enhance
the military capabilities of other nations and thereby shift the local
and regional balance of power, its ability to dictate specific outcomes
through such efforts **is severely limited.**]{.underline}

Arms for (Not That Much) Influence. [Successful foreign policy involves
encouraging other nations to behave in ways that benefit the United
States]{.underline}. As noted, [the United States has often attempted to
use arms sales to generate the sort of leverage or influence necessary
to do this. History reveals,]{.underline} however, [that the benefits of
the arms for influence strategy are limited for two main
reasons]{.underline}. [First, the range of cases in which arms sales can
produce useful leverage is much narrower than is often
imagined]{.underline}. Most obviously, [arms sales are unnecessary in
situations where the other country already agrees or complies with the
American position]{.underline} or can be encouraged to do so without
such incentives. [This category includes most U.S. allies and close
partners under many]{.underline}, though not all,
[circumstances]{.underline}. Just as clearly, [the arms for influence
strategy is a nonstarter when the other state will never agree to comply
with American demands.]{.underline} This category includes a small group
of obvious cases such as Russia, China, Iran, and other potential
adversaries (to which the United States does not sell weapons anyway),
but it also includes a much larger group of cases in which the other
state opposes what the United States wants, or in which complying with
U.S. wishes would be politically too dangerous for that state's
leadership.59 In addition, there are some cases in which the United
States itself would view arms sales as an inappropriate tool. The Leahy
Law, for example, bars the United States from providing security
assistance to any specific foreign military unit deemed responsible for
past human rights abuses.60 More broadly, arms sales are clearly a risky
choice when the recipient state is a failed state or when it is engaged
in a civil conflict or interstate war. Indeed, in such cases it is often
unclear whether there is anyone to negotiate with in the first place,
and governments are at best on shaky ground. At present the United
States bars 17 such nations from purchasing American arms. As long as
these nations are embargoed, arms sales will remain an irrelevant option
for exerting influence.61 Apart from these cases, [there is a large
group of nations with tiny defense budgets that simply don't buy enough
major conventional weaponry to provide much incentive for arms
sales.]{.underline} On this list are as many as 112 countries that
purchased less than \$100 million in arms from the United States between
2002 and 2016, including Venezuela, Jamaica, and Sudan. Lest this
category be dismissed because it includes mostly smaller and less
strategically significant countries from the American perspective, it
should be noted that each of these countries has a vote in the United
Nations (and other international organizations) and that many of them
suffer from civil conflicts and terrorism, making them potential targets
of interest for American policymakers looking for international
influence. By definition, then, the arms-for-influence strategy is
limited to cases in which a currently noncompliant country might be
willing to change its policies (at least for the right price or to avoid
punishment). [The second problem with the arms for influence strategy is
that international pressure in general]{.underline}, whether in the form
of economic sanctions, arms sales and embargoes, or military and foreign
aid promises and threats, [typically has a very limited impact on state
behavior]{.underline}. Though again, on paper, the logic of both
coercion and buying compliance looks straightforward, research shows
that leaders make decisions on the basis of factors other than just the
national balance sheet. In particular, leaders tend to respond far more
to concerns about national security and their own regime security than
they do to external pressure. [Arms sales]{.underline}, whether used as
carrots or sticks, [are in effect a fairly weak version of economic
sanctions]{.underline}, [which research has shown have limited
effects,]{.underline} even when approved by the United Nations, and tend
to spawn a host of unintended consequences. As such, the expectations
for their utility should be even more limited.62 A recent study
regarding the impact of economic sanctions came to a similar conclusion,
noting that, "The economic impact of sanctions may be pronounced ... but
other factors in the situational context almost always overshadow the
impact of sanctions in determining the political outcome."63 The authors
of another study evaluating the impact of military aid concur, arguing
that, "In general we find that military aid does not lead to more
cooperative behavior on the part of the recipient state. With limited
exceptions, increasing levels of U.S. aid are linked to a significant
reduction in cooperative foreign policy behavior."64 Perhaps the most
explicit evidence of the difficulty the United States has had exerting
this kind of leverage came during the Reagan administration. Sen. Robert
Kasten Jr. (R-WI) signaled the concern of many when he said, "Many
countries to whom we dispense aid continue to thumb their noses at us"
at the United Nations, and Congress passed legislation authorizing the
president to limit aid to any state that repeatedly voted in opposition
to the United States at the UN.65 In 1986, the Reagan administration
began to monitor voting patterns and issue threats, and, in roughly 20
cases in 1987 and 1988, it lowered the amount of aid sent to nations the
administration felt were not deferential enough. An analysis of the
results, however, found no linkage between changes in American support
and UN voting patterns by recipient states. The authors' conclusion fits
neatly within the broader literature about the limited impact of
sanctions: "The resilience of aid recipients clearly demonstrates that
their policies were driven more powerfully by interests other than the
economic threat of a hegemon."66 [The U.S. track record of generating
influence through arms sales specifically is quite mixed]{.underline}.
U.S. arms sales may have improved Israeli security over the years, for
example, but American attempts to pressure Israel into negotiating a
durable peace settlement with the Palestinians have had little impact.
Nor have arms sales provided the United States with enough leverage over
the years to prevent client states such as Iraq, Iran, Turkey,
Indonesia, and Morocco from invading their neighbors. Nor have arms
sales helped restrain the human rights abuses of clients like Chile or
Libya, or various Middle Eastern client states. [Although the United
States has used the promise of arms sales or the threat of denying arms
successfully from time to time, **the failures outnumber the
victories.**]{.underline} The most rigorous study conducted to tease out
the conditions under which arms for influence efforts are successful is
a 1994 study by John Sislin.67 Collating 191 attempts between 1950 and
1992, Sislin codes 80 of those attempts (42 percent) successful.
Sislin's analysis is incomplete, however, since he looks only at the
immediate benefits of arms sales and does not consider the long-term
consequences. Furthermore, a close look at the supposedly successful
attempts reveals that many of them are cases in which the United States
is in fact simply buying something rather than actually "influencing"
another nation. Thirty of the cases Sislin coded as successful were
instances of the United States using arms to buy access to military
bases (20 cases) or to raw materials (5 cases) or to encourage countries
to buy more American weapons (5 cases).68 Without those in the dataset,
the U.S. success rate drops to 31 percent. Finally, the conditions for
successful leverage seeking appear to be deteriorating. First, Sislin's
study found that American influence was at its height during the Cold
War when American power overshadowed the rest of the world. With the
leveling out of the global distribution of power, both economic and
military, the ability of the United States to exert influence has waned,
regardless of the specific tool being used. Second, as noted above, the
U.S. share of the global arms market has declined as the industry has
become more competitive and, as a result, American promises and threats
carry less weight than before. As William Hartung noted, "The odds
\[of\] buying political loyalty via arms transfers are incalculably
higher \[worse\] in a world in which there are dozens of nations to turn
to in shopping for major combat equipment."69

Rights' With Weak Response To Khashoggi Disappearance," December 09,

MK)

[Sen. Marco Rubio warned Tuesday that "there isn't enough money in the
world to purchase back our credibility on human rights]{.underline}" if
the U.S. government fails to punish Saudi Arabia over its alleged
involvement in the disappearance of Washington Post columnist Jamal
Khashoggi. Saudi Arabia is a longstanding U.S. partner on key Middle
East issues, including national and regional security, as well as a top
purchaser of American-made defense equipment. But Rubio (R-Fla.) told
CNN's "New Day" that the [U.S. ought to prioritize human rights over a
\$110 billion arms deal]{.underline} with the Saudi government. "I can
tell you that human rights is worth blowing that up and luring someone
into a consulate where they're murdered, dismembered and disposed of is
a big deal," Rubio, who sits on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee,
said. "It's a human being whose life was taken by a direct act of a
foreign government by luring him into a diplomatic facility in a third
country." Khashoggi is a Saudi journalist who had been living in exile
in the United States and has been critical of Saudi Crown Prince
Mohammed bin Salman and other members of the Saudi royal family. He was
last seen entering the Saudi Consulate in Istanbul on Oct. 2 to obtain
an official document required for his planned marriage. President Donald
Trump last week said he does not want to cancel an arms deal with Saudi
Arabia over concerns that such a move could negatively impact the U.S.
economy. Trump signed a memorandum in May, 2017, outlining intent from
the Saudi government to buy nearly \$110 billion in arms over the next
10 years. In an interview with CBS's "60 Minutes" that aired Sunday, the
president did say that there will be "severe punishment" over
Khashoggi's disappearance. But in a brief exchange with reporters on
Monday, Trump said he had spoken to Saudi Arabia's King Salman, who
Trump said "firmly denied any knowledge of" Khashoggi's disappearance.
"I don't want to get into his mind, but it sounded to me like maybe
these could have been rogue killers, who knows?" the president said.
"We'll try getting to the bottom of it very soon. His was a flat
denial." Rubio said that he realizes that selling weapons to another
country also gives us leverage, as buyers have to rely on the U.S. to
maintain the weapons. Still, he said, the benefits of prioritizing
defense sales do not outweigh the human rights costs. "[There isn't
enough money in the world to purchase back our credibility on human
rights and the way nations should conduct themselves]{.underline},"
Rubio said[. "We lose our credibility and our moral standing to
criticize]{.underline} \[Russian President Vladimir\] [Putin for
murdering people,]{.underline} \[Syrian President Bashar\] [Assad for
murdering people]{.underline}, \[Nicolás\] [Maduro in Venezuela for
murdering people, we can't say anything about that if we
allow]{.underline} Saudi Arabia to do [it and all we do is a diplomatic

with Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman: [Trump wouldn't

Unfortunately, Trump's claim to have secured \$110 billion in arms sales

have resulted, due mainly to lower oil prices and the Saudis' costly war
in Yemen. So in the Khashoggi affair, it appears that Trump is eager to
keep to his end of the bargain. He has avoided criticizing the Saudi
government over its alleged role in Khashoggi's disappearance to curry
favor with the monarchy over arms sales. Even in the face of [Turkish

US leverage While it's true that Russia and China are [indeed major
exporters](https://www.sipri.org/sites/default/files/2018-06/yb_18_summary_en_0.pdf)
of armaments, the claim that U.S. weapons can easily be replaced by
other suppliers is not -- at least not in the short term. First, once a
country is "locked in" to a specific kind of weapons system, such as
planes, tanks or naval vessels, the cost to
[switch](http://doi.org/10.1257/jep.8.4.65) to a different supplier can
be huge. Military personnel must be retrained on new equipment, spare
parts need to be replaced, and operational changes may be necessary.
After being so reliant on U.S. weapons systems for decades, the
[transition costs](http://www.dtic.mil/dtic/tr/fulltext/u2/a498941.pdf)
to buy from another country could be prohibitive even for oil-rich Saudi
Arabia. The second problem with Trump's argument is that armaments from
Russia, China or elsewhere are simply [not as sophisticated
as](https://ssi.armywarcollege.edu/pubs/display.cfm?pubID=1344) U.S.
weapons, which is why they are usually cheaper -- though the quality gap
is quickly decreasing. To maintain its military superiority in the
Middle East, Saudi Arabia has opted to purchase virtually all of its
weapons from American and European companies. That is why the U.S. has
significant leverage in this aspect of the relationship. Any [Saudi
threat](http://fortune.com/2018/10/14/saudis-threaten-retaliation-jamal-khashoggi/)
to retaliate against a ban on U.S. arms sales by buying weapons from
countries that have not raised concerns about the Khashoggi
disappearance would not be credible. And is probably why, despite
worries in the White House, such a threat has not yet been made. In many
ways, Saudi Arabia is locked in to buying U.S. weapons such as missiles
for F-15 fighters. [AP Photo/Scott

[Donald Trump's]{.underline} Middle East [policy represents a
significant change]{.underline} from that of Barack Obama. The president
is seeking to bolster Israel and Saudi Arabia, in particular, and to
isolate Iran. This agenda has emerged in piecemeal fashion rather than
as part of a coherent strategy -- and there are few indications that
administration officials have considered the long-term implications of
their approach. By Jack Thompson Barack Obama formulated a Middle East
strategy designed to repair the damage done during George W. Bush's
presidency. [The United States needed to rest an exhausted military,
replenish its soft power, and create political space for addressing
long-standing challenges]{.underline}. To this end, he reduced troop
levels in Iraq, avoided new large-scale military interventions, asked
allies to take more responsibility for regional security, and mostly
sought to address problems through diplomacy. He used a combination of
engagement and sanctions to induce Iran to halt its nuclear weapons
program, and sought to broker peace between the Israelis and
Palestinians along lines endorsed by the international community --
including a two-state solution, flexibility on the status of East
Jerusalem, and pausing the expansion of Israeli settlements on
Palestinian territory. To the dismay of allies such as Saudi Arabia,
Obama also encouraged democratic reforms in the region, though
inconsistently and with little success, and avoided overtly favoring
either side of the Sunni-Shia divide. Just as he promised during the
2016 campaign, [Donald Trump]{.underline} has taken a different
approach. Certainly, there are aspects of continuity. The president has
encouraged allies to accept more of the regional security burden,
resisted the temptation to send large numbers of troops to Syria and
other hotspots, and -- like Obama -- [tolerated Saudi Arabia's
intervention in Yemen]{.underline}. Yet in key respects, he has departed
from the policies of his predecessor. Relations with Riyadh have
improved notably, whereas during Obama's presidency the US and Saudi
governments were frequently at odds. Similarly, improving ties with
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's government, which suffered
during Obama's tenure, has been a priority. Trump has withdrawn from the
2015 deal designed to curtail Iran's nuclear weapons program -- formally
known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, or JCPOA -- and
reinstated sanctions on Tehran. Finally, [Trump has shown no interest in
promoting political reform or bolstering democratic norms]{.underline}
-- as he demonstrated soon after taking office with his so-called Muslim
travel ban. To the extent that [there is a discernable
pattern,]{.underline} it would appear that the president is promoting a
bloc led by Saudi Arabia,

repeatedly emphasized the importance of these arms deals for creating
jobs. Yet, in reality, these deals have minimal effects on employment.
Arms deals, compared to investment in education, health care and the
green economy, are the least efficient way to [create
jobs](https://www.peri.umass.edu/fileadmin/pdf/published_study/PERI_military_spending_2011.pdf),
according to a 2011 study conducted by economics professor Robert Pollin

Massachusetts. The study found that spending \$1 billion on the military
only generates 11,200 jobs, compared to 26,700 in education, 17,200 in
health care and 16,800 for the green economy. The United States
currently uses arms sales as singularly-focused financial transactions.
Instead, these deals should be used as an effective political
instrument. The Trump administration should shift arms sales from
unconditional transfers to conditional deals. Tying conditions to arms
sales effectively conveys U.S. expectations of its allies and clients.

must follow to gain export permit]{.underline}s. In the context of the
Yemeni civil war, the United States should suspend arms sales to
constrain Saudi Arabia's action. Specifically, the United States should
pressure the Saudis to immediately implement a ceasefire and set a
negotiation timetable for Saudi Arabia to work out a political solution
with Houthis in Yemen. At the same time, a ceasefire would allow Yemeni
civilians to gain access to humanitarian assistance. In so doing,
[United States could regain the moral high ground by
properly]{.underline} responding to the humanitarian crisis in Yemen.

[[concerned]{.underline}](https://www.cfr.org/expert-roundup/big-saudi-arms-sale-good-idea)
[about protecting US influence and stabilizing the Saudi-Iranian
relationship. They argue that cutting arms sales would reduce the US'
presence, embolden Iran and allow the Yemen conflict to further spiral
out of control. Iran is backing Houthi rebels that are fighting against
Saudi Arabia. If the US scales back its commitments to Saudi Arabia,
Iran could expand its regional influence and its purportedly violent
tendencies.]{.underline} However, as mentioned earlier, it is important
to note that [US arms sales are themselves perpetuating the conflict by
injecting weapons of war into Yemen. Saudi Arabia is the medium through
which myriad parties acquire arms. Ending the arms sales will mitigate
Saudi Arabia and Iran's thirsts for power by constraining the conflict's
capacity for violence.]{.underline} While the US government suggests
that arms sales incline Saudi Arabia to cooperate with the US' agenda,
the reverse is true. Rather than the United States gaining leverage
through arms sales, Saudi Arabia has gained more power instead. Patricia

that, empirically, [states that receive military aid are less
cooperative than states that do not. States that receive military aid
are willing to take advantage of their leverage]{.underline} because the
US often refrains from holding allied states completely accountable to
their commitments or to American principles. [Khashoggi's murder casts a

a blind eye]{.underline} to Saudi Arabia's blatant disregard for civil
liberties in the professed service of protecting America's economy.
Though not anywhere near as powerful as the US, [Saudi Arabia has
escaped the Khashoggi situation with its US arms deals intact. The

the international game but the [US has the biggest muscles to flex,

weapons [have American

or are maintained by American technicians. Saudi Arabia cannot find an
easy replacement for its US weapons imports: it would take decades for
Saudi Arabia to implement different systems and the transition costs of
such a switch would be monumental. By ending arms sales, the United
States can assert its sway over Saudi Arabia]{.underline}: if Saudi
weapons and systems are so reliant on US assistance, perhaps the Saudis
should be compelled to comply with new US terms; [Such a move would help
change the narrative that the US will never use its military aid

#### Soft power boosts hegemony -- creates a multiplier effect for hard power 

Daniel **Drezner**, **2019**, (prof. at the Fletcher School of Law and
Diplomacy at Tufts), presented at the American Political Science
Association Annual Meeting, "Power: A Temporal View,"
https://ndisc.nd.edu/assets/313840/power_paper.pdf, mm

Another way in which liberals believe in the temporal expansion of power
is through the concept of "soft power." As Nye (2004) defines it, [soft
power is the product of several components, including the execution of
wise policies.]{.underline} For Nye, successful policies beget even more
attractive forms of power, getting others to want what the actor wants.
This is in sharp contrast to realism's balance-of-power dynamic.
Furthermore, [Nye]{.underline} (2011, p. 21) [argues that soft power can
build off of hard power capabilities. Soft power has a multiplier effect
in Nye's rubric, extending the temporal reach of hard
power:]{.underline} "the resources often associated with hard power
behavior can also produce soft power behavior depending on the context
and how they are used. Command power can create resources that in turn
can create soft power at a later phase---for example, institutions that
will provide soft power resources in the future." [All of the liberal
paradigm's explications of power either implicitly or explicitly assume
increasing returns and an increasing temporal reach of power exercised
today]{.underline}.

### AT -- "Won't Sell to HR Violators"

#### A loophole in the CAT allows arms sales to the worst HR violators 

Alex **Emmons**, 7/20/**18**, The Intercept, "how a one-word loophole
will make it easier for the US to sell weapons to governments that kill
civilians,"
https://theintercept.com/2018/07/20/trump-conventional-arms-transfer-policy/,
mm

ARMS CONTROL [EXPERTS are raising concerns about a possible loophole in
the]{.underline} Trump administration's [new arms export
policy]{.underline}, [arguing that it gives the administration further
cover to sell weapons to some of the world's worst human rights
violators.]{.underline} When it was issued in April, the Trump
administration's Conventional Arms Transfer policy was widely panned by
critics for prioritizing the profits of weapons companies ahead of
transparency and human rights concerns. The White House was blunt about
its intentions, promising that the executive branch would "advocate
strongly on behalf of United States companies." But [one change in
particular may make it easier for American companies to sell weapons to
governments that routinely kill civilians in conflicts by discounting
killings that the governments claim are unintentional]{.underline}. The
change could have a significant impact on sales to Saudi Arabia and the
United Arab Emirates --- the top two U.S. weapons clients --- both of
which are engaged in a destructive bombing campaign in Yemen. [The
loophole hinges on the insertion of one word]{.underline} in a section
that is otherwise identical to the Obama administration's conventional
arms policy, which was issued in 2014. While the previous policy
prohibited arms transfers to countries that perpetrate "attacks directed
against civilian objects or civilians," the Trump administration policy
bars such transfers to countries that commit "attacks intentionally
directed against civilian objects or civilians". The release of the new
policy was followed by a two-month public comment period that ended last
month. On Monday, the State Department issued a fact sheet on the
policy's implementation, which promised it would energize a
"whole-of-government effort to expedite transfers that support \[the
administration's\] essential foreign policy and national security
objectives." Colby Goodman, a researcher on arms sales and director of
the Security Assistance Monitor at the Center for International Policy,
said [arms control groups had objected to the word
"intentional]{.underline}," but no change was reflected in the
guidelines released Monday. "Depending on how this policy is
implemented, this focus could make it harder for those in the U.S.
government \[with\] legitimate human rights concerns to block or modify
some proposed U.S. arms sales," Goodman told The Intercept. [The
loophole is particularly significant in light of the destructive Saudi
and Emirati-led bombing campaign in Yemen]{.underline}, where civilian
deaths are routinely termed inadvertent or unintentional. Throughout its
three-year bombing campaign, the Saudi and UAE-led coalition has
repeatedly bombed civilian targets, striking homes, markets, food
sources, and even schools, hospitals, and water infrastructure. These
attacks have become so common that human rights groups have called for
an arms embargo on Saudi Arabia. Both the Obama and Trump
administrations have resupplied the coalition through arms sales,
content with coalition claims that the strikes are unintentional
mistakes. Under Obama's 2014 policy, the U.S. rebuffed human rights
groups and sold the coalition more than \$20 billion in weapons. As part
of an effort to push back against criticism, Saudi Arabia and the UAE
formed a body called the "Joint Incidents Assessment Team" in 2015 to
investigate civilian deaths. But rather than holding the coalition
accountable, the body frequently parrots its rhetoric that strikes are
unintentional mistakes, according to Kristine Beckerle, Yemen researcher
at Human Rights Watch. "'I didn't mean to' is not a sufficient excuse
for the Yemenis still grieving \[for\] their loved ones killed or
wounded --- they deserve accountability, compensation," Beckerle told
The Intercept. "Even if the coalition didn't intend to bomb a wedding, a
home, a hospital, it doesn't necessarily follow the strike was lawful,
that an individual didn't commit a war crime --- there's a lot more to
the laws of war than that." In 2016, for example, the JIAT found that a
strike against a residential complex in western Yemen had been
"unintentional." Later that year, it found that the bombing of a
Médecins Sans Frontières-run hospital was an "unintentional error,"
despite the fact the buildings were clearly marked as MSF medical
facilities. And last year, after the coalition bombed a water factory in
Yemen's Hajjah directorate, the JIAT found that "the bomb went off
course and fell on the factory unintentionally." [The Trump
administration's policy may help the U.S. facilitate further arms sales
by relying on the pretext that these types of bombings, though
recurrent, are unintentional]{.underline}. "Those hoping this
administration might learn lessons from the past about how U.S. weapons
ended up being misused, or show proper restraint in sales to countries
such as Saudi Arabia and the UAE, have nothing to cheer in the new
policy or its implementation plan to date," said Jeff Abramson, a senior
fellow at the Arms Control Association. In May, shortly after the
coalition bombed a wedding party in North Yemen, the State Department
briefed Senate staff about another possible multibillion dollar sale of
air-to-ground munitions to Saudi Arabia and the UAE. The sale is
currently being held up by Sen. Bob Menendez, D-N.J., over concerns
about civilian casualties.

#### Loopholes ensure that we sell weapons to HR violators 

Michael **Selby-Green**, 7/25/**18**, Business Insider, "experts fear US
arms sales to human rights abusers will become easier thanks to a
'loophole' in Trump's new policy,"
https://www.businessinsider.com/loophole-could-make-us-arms-sales-to-human-rights-abusers-easier-2018-7,,
mm

[Arms control experts have voiced concerns over possible loopholes
in]{.underline} President [Trump\'s new arms export policy]{.underline},
which they argue may make it easier for US companies to sell weapon to
governments that violate human rights, The Intercept reported. In April
[the]{.underline} Trump [Administration issued its new Conventional Arms
Transfer policy]{.underline}. The new rules were criticised by human
rights groups and arms control advocates, including Amnesty
International and the Arms Control Association, for prioritising a
relaxed arms sales regime over transparency and human rights. The White
House said it would \"advocate strongly on behalf of United States
companies.\" The Intercept reported. The policy change [could ease the
path of arms transfers]{.underline} from the United States to, in
particular, its two largest weapons customers, Saudi Arabia and the
United Arab Emirates. Both are pursuing an ongoing bombing campaign in
Yemen which has so far killed over 5,000 civilians. [The loophole could
be created by a one-word change]{.underline} from Obama\'s Conventional
Arms Transfer Policy, issued in 2014. The old policy prohibited arms
transfers to countries that commit \"attacks directed against civilian
objects or civilians,\" whereas the Trump administration\'s new policy
bars transfers that are \"intentionally\" directed against civilian
objects or civilians. A two-month consultation period followed the
release of the new policy in April, which ended last month. On Monday
the State-department published a statement that said the policy would
energise a \"whole-of-government effort to expedite transfers that
support \[the administration\'s\] essential foreign policy and national
security objectives.\" Colby Goodman, an arms sales researcher and
director of the Security Assistance Monitor at the Center for
International Policy told The Intercept that arms groups had objected to
the word \"intentional,\" but no changes had been made. \"Depending on
how this policy is implemented, this focus could make it harder for
those in the U.S. government \[with\] legitimate human rights concerns
to block or modify some proposed U.S. arms sales,\" he said.
[The]{.underline} current administration\'s new [wording could help the
US sell arms to countries that repeatedly kill civilians]{.underline},
by relying on the argument that the civilian casualties are
unintentional. One Trump aide, speaking in April on the condition of
anonymity, told Reuters that the Trump adminstration has been aiming to
reduce human rights restrictions which have led to a \"veto\" over some
arms deals. Despite concerns from Amnesty International and other groups
over the new policy, the Obama administration also supported arms sales
to the Saudi-led coalition in Yemen, selling \$20 billion worth of
weapons in the face of opposition from human rights groups and under the
pretext that civilian casualties in Yemen were unintentional. \"Those
hoping this administration might learn lessons from the past about how
U.S. weapons ended up being misused, or show proper restraint in sales
to countries such as Saudi Arabia and the UAE, have nothing to cheer in
the new policy or its implementation plan to date,\" Jeff Abramson, a
senior fellow at the Arms Control Association told The Intercept.

### AT Alt Cause -- ATT Withdrawal

#### The plan fulfils the spirit of the treaty -- overcomes lack of ratification 

Pablo **Olabuenaga**, 5/8/**19**, Just Security, "why the arms trade
treaty matters - and why it matters that the US is walking away,"
https://www.justsecurity.org/63968/why-the-arms-trade-treaty-matters-and-why-it-matters-that-the-us-is-walking-away/,
mm

[It was not surprising]{.underline} or unexpected [when]{.underline}
President Donald [Trump]{.underline} [announced that the
U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates [would "withdraw" from
the]{.underline} Arms Trade Treaty ([ATT]{.underline}) in an April 26
address to the National Rifle Association (NRA). To a roaring crowd, he
declared: "Under my administration, we will never surrender American
sovereignty to anyone. We will never allow foreign bureaucrats to
trample on your second amendment freedom. I'm officially announcing
today that the United States will be revoking the effect of America's
signature from this badly misguided treaty." If anything, [Trump's
announcement is congruent with his administration's foreign policy
approach]{.underline}, which has consistently attacked multilateralism
and challenged international law. Examples of this pattern of conduct
are the withdrawal from the Paris Agreement in June 2017; the withdrawal
from UNESCO in October 2017; pulling out from the negotiations on the
Global Compact on Migration in December 2017; the unilateral military
attacks, together with France and the United Kingdom, against Syria in
violation of the UN Charter in April 2018; pulling out of the U.N.'s
Human Rights Council in June 2018; the withdrawal of both the Optional
Protocol of the 1961 Vienna Convention of Diplomatic Relations and of
the 1955 Treaty of Amity with Iran in October 2018; the withdrawal in
February from the Intermediate-range Nuclear Forces (INF) treaty with
Russia; or the recent decision to revoke the entry visa to the U.S. of
Fatou Bensouda, the prosecutor of the International Criminal Court. In
the case of U.S. withdrawal from the ATT, in addition to the political
considerations associated with it, the decision is based on a clear
misconception of what the treaty is and what it does. To better
understand the gravity of this misguided decision, it is important to
take a look at the history behind the treaty and at its content,
especially its object and purpose. Before the ATT entered into force on
Dec. 24, 2014, there were more international laws in the world
regulating the trade of bananas than the arms trade. For many years,
civil society had recognized this deficiency and called for global
action. In 1997, for example, a group of 19 eminent persons and
institutions that had received the Nobel Prize for Peace --- including
Dr. Oscar Arias Sánchez, former President of Costa Rica; Desmond Tutu;
José Ramos Horta and Amnesty International --- launched and
International Code of Conduct on Arms Transfers. This initiative made
its way to the U.N. a few years later via the Permanent Mission of Costa
Rica in New York. The lack of an international global framework for the
trade in arms was profoundly worrisome given the immense volume of the
global trade in conventional arms and its potential effect in the
disruption of peace and sustainable development. Former U.N.
Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon had indicated that: "The world is
overarmed and peace is underfunded. Military spending is on the rise.
Today, it is well above \$1 trillion a year. Let us look at Africa
alone. Between 1990 and 2005, 23 African countries lost an estimated
\$284 billion as a result of armed conflicts, fueled by transfers of
ammunition and arms --- 95 per cent of which came from outside Africa.
And globally, 60 years of United Nations peacekeeping operations have
cost less than six weeks of current military spending." After years of
informal discussions, and with mounting pressure from civil society, the
U.N. initiated a process to negotiate the first global international
agreement to regulate the licit trade in arms, finally putting an end to
this important gap in international law. This process was long and
complicated, as are most multilateral processes at the U.N. It included
the establishment of a Group of Governmental Experts (GGE) in 2008,
whose mandate was to examine the feasibility, scope and draft parameters
for a comprehensive, legally binding instrument establishing common
international standards for the import, export and transfer of
conventional arms. This was followed by the establishment, in 2009, of
an open-ended working group of the General Assembly to consider the
report of the GGE and the recommendation of an international instrument
on the matter. After this, the decision was made to establish a
preparatory committee, which had two sessions in 2010 and 2011,
respectively, followed by the U.N. Conference on the Arms Trade Treaty,
held in 2012. Then, the Final U.N. Conference on the Arms Trade Treaty
was convened in 2013, since no agreement could be reached the year
before. The final treaty text had to be adopted by consensus, according
to the Rules of Procedure of the Conference agreed to by the preparatory
committee. During the first Conference, both Russia and the U.S.
indicated that they were not ready to adopt the draft text put forward
by Argentinian President Roberto García Moritán. As a consequence, the
General Assembly convened the Final Conference, where general agreement,
including by Russia and the U.S., grew around the draft text prepared by
Australian President Peter Woolcott. However, on the last day of the
Final U.N. Conference (March 28, 2013), Syria, Iran and the Democratic
People's Republic of Korea (DPRK), blocked the adoption of the treaty by
consensus. Therefore, on April 1, 2013, a draft resolution was submitted
to the General Assembly for the adoption of the treaty. The resolution
was co-sponsored by 64 U.N. member States, including the U.S. The ATT
was consequently adopted by the U.N. General Assembly on April 2, 2013,
with 154 votes in favor and only 3 against (DPRK, Iran and Syria), and
with 23 abstentions. To this date, the treaty has 130 signatories and
101 States Parties. I had the opportunity to serve in the Mexican
delegation throughout the negotiation process, starting with the
negotiation and adoption of General Assembly resolution 64/48 in 2009,
and through the adoption of the treaty in 2013. I can attest to the hard
work and effort that it took both Amb. García Moritán and Amb. Woolcott,
as well as all delegations, to come together on an issue that has an
inherent trend to polarization and that touches upon very sensitive
issues for States including concerns about their own security and
stability. From the Mexican perspective, this is a particularly
important legal instrument given the great challenges and threats posed
by the illicit trade of arms that flows mostly from the U.S. border into
Mexico, fueling organized crime. To exemplify this, the negotiations
coincided with the exposure of the highly controversial U.S. Fast and
Furious operation, where the Phoenix Field Division of the Bureau of
Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF), allowed illegal gun
sales in an attempt to track the sellers and buyers, who were believed
to be connected to Mexican drug cartels. As Roberto Dondisch, chief
negotiator of the Mexican delegation, has written elsewhere ('El Tratado
de Comercio de Armas, un éxito de la diplomacia mexicana' in México y el
Multilateralismo del Siglo XXI), the U.S. and Mexico always kept a very
close relationship throughout the negotiations. Despite having
substantial differences in our approaches to certain aspects of the
treaty, we always maintained the utmost respect in our exchanges and we
worked hand in hand towards bridging those differences in favor of
achieving a meaningful legal instrument. The fact that both teams ---
led by Dr. Dondisch on the Mexican side, and by Amb. Thomas Countryman,
who left the State Department in January 2017, on the U.S. side ---
overcame what initially were perceived as irreconcilable positions and
ended up cosponsoring the draft resolution through which the ATT was
adopted by the General Assembly, proves that where there is a will,
there is a way. What does the ATT do? As indicated by its name, the Arms
Trade Treaty regulates the international licit trade of arms. Its object
and purpose, which is clearly spelled out in Article 1, is the
following: "The object of this Treaty is to: Establish the highest
possible common international standards for regulating or improving the
regulation of the international trade in conventional arms; Prevent and
eradicate the illicit trade in conventional arms and prevent their
diversion; for the purpose of: Contributing to international and
regional peace, security and stability; Reducing human suffering;
Promoting cooperation, transparency and responsible action by States
Parties in the international trade in conventional arms, thereby
building confidence among States Parties." Other relevant aspects of the
treaty to be highlighted are: i) its scope includes small arms and light
weapons; ii) State Parties have the obligation to establish and maintain
a national control system to regulate the export of
ammunition/munitions; iii) the treaty establishes a system to conduct an
assessment, including the consideration of possible mitigation measures,
before authorizing an export of weapons; iv) it includes measures to
prevent the diversion of arms, and v) it includes a yearly reporting
mechanism of authorized or actual exports and imports of conventional
arms. In a nutshell, the ATT sets out global standards to conduct legal
and rightful activities in a transparent manner. This, in turn, helps to
identify where and how arms are diverted into the illicit market and
raises the bar regarding accountability for irresponsible transfers of
arms. What does the ATT not do? It is not a disarmament treaty nor a
treaty for the reduction of arsenals; it does not prohibit the
international trade in arms, and; it does not regulate, in any way,
internal transactions, in particular the acquisition of arms by
civilians. Contrary to what Trump has declared, the treaty explicitly
reaffirms "the sovereign right of any State to regulate and control
conventional arms exclusively within its territory, pursuant to its own
legal or constitutional system." In other words, the ATT is absolutely
silent on controls, regulations, limitations, rights or obligations
regarding the domestic sale of arms. Therefore, claiming that the ATT
breaches sovereign rights of States, specifically the second amendment
to the U.S. Constitution, is not a matter of misinterpretation: It is
simply not true. It is also very important to understand what is the
extent of the legal obligations arising from signing the ATT. A
signatory to an international treaty is not a State Party. According to
Article 18 of the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties (VCLT) of
1969, a State that has signed a treaty has the obligation to refrain
from acts which would defeat the object and purpose of said treaty. No
more and no less. The signature does not unfold the totality of the
rights and obligations established in the treaty. This would only happen
if the State became a party, having expressed its consent to be bound,
namely through ratification, acceptance, approval or accession. It is
also worth noting that there is no such thing as a revocation of
signature of treaties in the VCLT. However, the obligation not to defeat
the object and purpose of a treaty arising from its signature lasts
until the State has made its intention clear not to become a party to
the treaty, which presumably will be the case of the ATT (as of the time
of writing of this essay, no notification in this regard has been
deposited by the U.S. before the U.N. Treaty Section, which serves as
depositary of the Treaty). The adoption of the ATT was widely praised,
and rightly so. Following the adoption of the ATT, the U.N. issued a
press release stating: "To a burst of sustained applause, the General
Assembly today voted overwhelmingly in favour of a "historic",
first-ever treaty to regulate the astonishing number of conventional
weapons traded each year, making it more difficult for them to be
diverted into the hands of those intent on sowing the seeds of war and
conflict." The President of the Final UN Conference, Amb. Woolcott,
wrote: "The UN had not seen success in negotiating a multilateral arms
control agreement since the 1990s. The adoption of the Treaty by an
overwhelming majority of States in the UN General Assembly is a major
achievement for the United Nations and for multilateralism. When the
Treaty's regular Conference of States Parties takes hold, it will
underscore that the discussion and scrutiny of the international arms
trade have firmly found a place on the multilateral agenda."
(Introduction to the book Weapons and international law: The Arms Trade
Treaty, 2015) Finally, In the preface to the book Le Traite sur le
Commerce des Armes by Loïc Simonet, Dr. Óscar Arias wrote: "...I am both
proud and deeply relieved that as I write these words in October 2014,
we have defied the odds. We have made history. The Arms Trade Treaty was
adopted on 2nd April 2013 by a large majority of the UN General
Assembly. (...) As we look back on our history of violence, we took a
powerful step towards peace. For the first time in history, a legally
binding instrument established a common regulatory framework for
international transfers of conventional arms, and therefore set up
universal legal standards for the arms trade, on one of the few areas of
global commerce which had escaped any control until now. The treaty has
the power to reduce human suffering and contribute to international
peace, security and stability. To be honest, it is an achievement I
never expected to witness. I never thought that an idea that first took
shape so many years ago would become a part of international law in my
lifetime." Given the great difficulties it encompassed as well as the
great real impact it can have on the ground in reducing human suffering,
the adoption of the ATT was indeed a historical achievement of the
international community. It also reaffirmed the relevance of the United
Nations and multilateral diplomacy, in particular in an area as
controversial as the regulation of conventional arms, and in which no
progress had been registered for so many years. According to Amnesty
International, more than 500 people die every day from gun violence, 44
percent of all killings globally involve gun violence, and there were
over 1 million firearm-related deaths globally between 2012 and 2016. In
contrast, military expenditure is on the rise. According to the
Stockholm International Peace Research Institute (SIPRI), the U.S.
continues to be the top global exporter of arms and the 13th global
importer (with Saudi Arabia holding the first position), with a total
military expenditure in 2018 of \$6.5 billion. This is more than 120
times the U.N. budget for the period 2018-2019. It is for these reasons
that the recent announcement to "revoke" the U.S. signature of the ATT
is so troubling. [The world is in]{.underline} dire [need
of]{.underline} [an]{.underline} effective implementation of the only
global legally binding [instrument that regulates]{.underline} the
international trade in [arms]{.underline}. And [for that to happen, it
is key to have on board the largest exporter in the world, **if not as a
State Party, at least as a responsible actor committed not to undermine
the object and purpose of the treaty**]{.underline}, which has at its
core international peace and security and, most importantly, the value
of the human person. Unfortunately, this political decision, based on
false premises, and coupled with a consistent pattern of attacks on
multilateral diplomacy, seems anything but promising.

Despite the many international, national, and NGO activities that have
been undertaken regarding conventional arms control in recent years,
[numerous challenges and obstacles remain in enhancing arms control
measures]{.underline}. The first challenge is the legitimacy of the
weapons. Conventional weapons, unlike weapons of mass destruction, serve
many purposes. They provide for the national defense and support
policing activities -- and small arms are regularly and legitimately
used for sport and hunting activities. It is undesirable and unlikely to
ban the majority of conventional weapons. [The challenge]{.underline},
then, [is to limit and constrain the trade in conventional weaponry to
prevent destabilizing build-ups and misuse.]{.underline} Because
conventional arms serve legitimate purposes, a second challenge arises
due to the role of arms producers and exporters. [Many countries produce
weapons]{.underline}, but the role of the major weapons producers and
exporters cannot be understated. The United States, Russia, China,
Britain, and France hold the lion's share of the global arms market --
**[with the United States leading the way]{.underline}**. He[sitance on
their part to enhance conventional arms trade controls has a significant
impact on the will and capability of the entire international community
to engage in stricter arms trade practices.]{.underline} A third
challenge to the development of stronger arms trade controls goes beyond
great power and major supplier concerns. Existing ideas and norms of
state sovereignty, national self-defense, self-determination, and
territorial integrity have an impact on political will more generally in
the international community. Many recent international agreements on
weapons control have, in fact, reiterated the norms of sovereignty,
national self-defense, selfdetermination, and territorial integrity,
which are grounded in the UN Charter itself.13 Moreover, Article 223 of
the Treaty of Rome, which established the basis for the European
Community and today's European Union, specifies that national
governments have exclusive control over national arms industries, arms
sales, and arms control decisions, providing additional hindrance to
state interests in multilateral arms trade controls in Europe.14
Ultimately, the fourth and perhaps the primary challenge facing arms
control today is the sheer complexity of the issue. The conventional
arms trade is comprised of weapons both big and small and characterized
by a multitude of issues such as supply and demand. Many factors affect
demand and sources of supply to provide the arms that states, non-state
actors, and individuals seek. It has become increasingly difficult to
control the flow of weapons in a growing global economy, and even more
difficult to reach all relevant arms trade actors and limit or constrain
their behavior. Today, cross-border mergers and acquisitions spread
weapons technology and governments become less able to control
arms-producing corporations. Weapons are increasingly assembled in more
than one country, making it hard to control the end product. Moreover,
developing countries have improved their own weapons industries,
lessening their reliance on traditional trading partners if avenues to
arms are closed. In addition, a growing illicit trade significantly
hampers the development and implementation of arms control measures.
Furthermore, the economic benefits of arms sales are increasingly
considered more important than the possible political consequences.
Despite the many challenges, [there are]{.underline} also [many
prospects for the future of international arms trade
controls]{.underline}. The past several years have indicated that
increased attention and activity has focused on better regulating the
international arms trade. Ideally, a more cooperative environment will
emerge and states, NGOs, and relevant arms trade actors will work
together to find common ground and agree to certain limitations on the
arms trade that will meet everyone's needs in forums that are not
necessarily based on consensus rule. The international community may
also continue to use economic tools such as development assistance and
trade, investment, and technology transfers as enticements when
negotiating arms controls in the developing world, and individual
governments can also use persuasion, through political dialogue, to help
enact arms controls in a bilateral agreement.15 Moreover,
[other]{.underline} international, regional, and [national measures
regarding the protection of human rights, reform of security sectors,
enhancement of the rule of law, and good governance will also have an
impact on the international arms trade as safer and more secure
environments emerge]{.underline}.16

#### The US will be modeled -- wields outsized influence in the arms trade 

**CIVIC and the Stimson Center**, 1/10/**18**, \[This report is a joint
initiative of the Center for Civilians in Conflict and the Stimson
Center\], "With Great Power: Modifying US Arms Sales to Reduce Civilian
Harm,"

mm

The global arms trade reached an estimated total value of \$91.3 billion
in 2015 (the last year when complete data was available).1 While [the
United States]{.underline} is not the only country that sells
conventional arms through government-to-government and commercial
transactions, it [holds an unrivaled dominance measured in global market
share]{.underline}. According to the Stockholm International Peace
Research Institute (SIPRI), the total value of international US arms
exports delivered in 2016 was close to \$10 billion, or 29 percent of
the total global export market.2 The US has maintained an average of 33
percent market share in international arms exports between 2011 and
2015, followed most closely by Russia (25 percent) and China (5.9
percent).3 These figures do not include transfer agreements, estimated
at \$40.2 billion, or over 50% of the global total, when last measured
in 2015.4 All reporting indicates that the US will remain the market
leader in 2017.5 [Of the 82 countries]{.underline}
[identified]{.underline} by the Uppsala Conflict Data Program [as a
party or secondary party to an armed conflict in 2016]{.underline}, [the
US delivered]{.underline} [major]{.underline} [military
items]{.underline} (measured in Foreign Military Sales) [to at least 62
of them]{.underline}; in 34 countries where conflict took place, the US
delivered arms in 27.6 Meanwhile, in 2016, armed conflict in as many as
34 countries killed an estimated 102,000 people and caused an
unquantified level of damage to civilian infrastructure, including
homes, schools, and hospitals.8 Although no single weapon or technology
caused this level of death and destruction, [the global arms trade has a
direct bearing on the effects of war on civilians]{.underline}. In the
2017 United Nations report on the Protection of Civilians in Armed
Conflict, the UN Secretary-General called specific attention to the
relationship between arms proliferation and human suffering in war,
noting that "high levels of arms and ammunition in circulation, combined
with poor controls on them, contribute to insecurity and facilitate
violations of international humanitarian and human rights law."9
Research by the International Committee for the Red Cross (ICRC)
confirms that "[when conventional arms]{.underline} [are poorly
regulated and widely available, the humanitarian consequences are
grim:]{.underline} violations of international humanitarian law and
human rights law, restricted medical and humanitarian assistance,
prolonged armed conflicts, and high levels of armed violence and
insecurity\...even after wars have ended."10 Of mounting concern are the
effects of explosive weapons used in urban areas, as seen in recent
military campaigns in Iraq and Syria. According to data collected by
Action on Armed Violence, civilians represent approximately 92 percent
of those reported killed and injured when security forces employ
explosive weapons in populated areas.11 Analysts estimate that explosive
weapons led to the death of 32,000 civilians in 2016 alone.12 While
improvised explosives caused much of this damage, civilians also
suffered the effects of commercially available "smart" and "dumb" bombs,
missiles, and mortars that were dropped, launched, or shot from the
ground, air, and sea. In addition to civilian deaths and injuries, these
weapons cause high levels of forced displacement and critical damage to
essential civilian infrastructure, including hospitals, sanitation
systems, and transportation systems essential for food security. [With
its outsized influence on the trade and use of arms worldwide, the US
has the ability, the opportunity, and the responsibility to shape the
arms trade to reduce harm to civilians]{.underline}. Moreover, ensuring
that US-made and -sold weapons are deployed as intended, within the
bounds of international humanitarian and human rights law, is also a
core US national security interest. The 2014 US Conventional Arms
Transfer Policy, enshrining 20 years of bipartisan policy on arms
transfers13 recalls that, "In the hands of hostile or irresponsible
state and non-state actors ... weapons can exacerbate international
tensions, foster instability, inflict substantial damage, enable
transnational organized crime, and be used to violate universal human
rights."14

### Solvency -- AT Circumvention

#### The plan won't be circumvented -- the presidential order mobilizes the executive branch against any agents that would attempt to ignore the plan

Contemporary Presidency: Do Presidential Memo Orders Substitute for

[Large, complex administrative systems require effective signaling to
efficiently coordinate activity. Increased public signaling by the White
House may be]{.underline} in part [a device intended to inform
bureaucrats of administration priorities in an increasingly divided and
contentious polity]{.underline}. [For that purpose, published memo
orders may be useful]{.underline}. [Public signaling]{.underline} about
policy objectives [through memo orders]{.underline} [may also have a
positive effect of guiding attentive groups to engage in **fire-alarm
monitoring** to assist the White House in enforcing its
goals]{.underline}. As administrative complexity increases, these may be
attractive strategies for the White House, but how this produces the
temporal pattern we observe is not entirely clear. Beyond partisan
conflict and administrative complexity, Cohen (2008) argues that
targeted communications has become more central to presidential
strategies during the relevant time period due to the rise of new media.
It is possible that we should view these orders not simply as
reinforcing substantive policy, but as in part an element of a political
communication strategy. This objective would be shared across parties.

### Solvency -- Presidential Directives -- Force of Law

#### Presidential directives have the weight of law -- Supreme Course precedent proves 

Graham **Dodds, 2013**, "Take Up Your Pen: Unilateral Presidential
Directives in American Politics," University of Pennsylvania Press,
p.10, mm

If executive orders, proclamations, memoranda, and other unilateral
[presidential directives]{.underline} merely expressed the president's
view, then they would be important but not necessarily determinative.
However, these directives [are not mere statements of presidential
preferences;]{.underline} rather, [they establish binding policies and
have the force of law, ultimately backed by the full coercive power of
the state.]{.underline} In Armstrong v. United States, 80 U.S. (13
Wall.) 154 (1871), [the Supreme Court considered the legal status of a
proclamation and decided that such directives are public acts to which
courts must ''give effect.'' In other words,]{.underline} [in the eyes
of the judiciary, unilateral presidential directives are just as binding
as laws]{.underline}. In 1960, Senator Robert Byrd (D-WV) advised his
colleagues, ''Keep in mind that an executive order is not statutory
law.''46 Politically, that may be true, as unilateral presidential
directives represent the will only of the chief executive and lack the
direct endorsement of congressional majorities. But [constitutionally
and legally, a unilateral presidential directive is as authoritative and
compulsory as a regular law,]{.underline} at least until such time as it
is done away with by Congress, courts, or by a future unilateral
presidential directive.

### Solvency -- Presidential Directives - AT Rollback (2AC Block)

#### Durable fiat prevents rollback -- this is the only legitimate interpretation of fiat and it's key to aff ground otherwise every aff would lose to future governments roll back the plan

#### Presidential directives are durable -- decades of data prove

Graham **Dodds, 2013**, "Take Up Your Pen: Unilateral Presidential
Directives in American Politics," University of Pennsylvania Press,
p.13,mm

Indeed, [unilateral presidential directives are fairly safe and durable
means of policymaking]{.underline}. [According to one study, 40 percent
of executive orders issued between 1959 and 1998 were still in effect as
of 2008, and the average executive order in that time remained unchanged
for twelve years]{.underline}.57 Altogether, [the above figures suggest
that executive]{.underline} orders and other [directives give presidents
a means of unilateral policymaking that may be largely immune from the
checks of the other two branches]{.underline}. And that points to one of
the ways in which unilateral presidential directives can be
constitutionally troubling. Unilateral presidential directives are
arguably in tension with two of the most fundamental aspects of the U.S.
constitutional architecture: the separation of powers and checks and
balances.58 Insofar as unilateral presidential directives enable the
executive to legislate unilaterally, they violate a strict separation of
powers. And insofar as the other two branches have often been unable or
unwilling to resist or reverse these executive edicts, unilateral
presidential directives also call into question the efficacy of
traditional checks and balances. But despite these constitutional
concerns---and because courts have accepted and even affirmed them, and
Congress seldom overrides them and usually passively acquiesces to
them---[unilateral presidential directives are a legitimate and binding
means of presidential policymaking.]{.underline}

#### The plan will be implemented as a presidential memo -- means it won't get rolled back

Graham **Dodds**, **2013**, "Take Up Your Pen: Unilateral Presidential
Directives in American Politics," University of Pennsylvania Press,
p.8-9, mm

In addition to executive orders and proclamations, [presidential
memoranda constitute a]{.underline} third, [important type of unilateral
presidential directives.]{.underline} Like executive orders and
proclamations, [memoranda are written documents via which the president
directs governmental actions]{.underline}. In one notable memorandum,
Bill Clinton directed the secretary of health and human services to end
the moratorium on funding research involving fetal tissue.37 Memoranda
are very similar to executive orders, and hence also to proclamations.
Phillip Cooper, a professor of public administration, calls memoranda
''executive orders by another name,'' and in Lower Brule Sioux Tribe v.
Deer, 911 F. Supp. 395, D.S.D. (1995), a circuit court suggested that
[memoranda are legally interchangeable with executive
orders]{.underline}.38 However, there is a key difference among these
three types of unilateral presidential directives, as memoranda are not
required be published, while executive orders and proclamations are.
According to the Senate report of 1974: ''If a document is not
specifically designated as an 'Executive Order' or 'Presidential
Proclamation,' the decision of whether or not it will be published as a
part of the public record is left to the discretion of the President and
his advisers. If he wishes a document to have 'general applicability and
legal effect,' he will presumably have it published. If, however, the
order is directed only to an official or an agency and does not purport
to regulate the conduct of private citizens, there is no legal necessity
for its publication. Most executive directives fall into this
category.''39 The Obama administration published most of its memoranda
and also listed them on the White House Web site, but earlier
administrations have been less forthcoming.40 [The lack of]{.underline}
publication and [publicity mean that memoranda may be more difficult for
Congress or courts or future presidents to reverse. Presidents are aware
of this, and the number of memoranda has been increasing over the past
few presidencies]{.underline}.41

#### This is normal means -- that's how the last CAT was implemented 

Justin **Doubleday**, 7/16/**18**, Inside defense, "White House approves
action plan for new conventional arms transfer policy,"
https://insidedefense.com/insider/white-house-approves-action-plan-new-conventional-arms-transfer-policy,
mm

President [Trump]{.underline} has [approved an implementation plan to
carry out the new conventional arms transfer policy]{.underline} aimed
at streamlining the international weapon sales process and boosting
American jobs. Tina Kaidanow, acting assistant secretary of state for
the bureau of political-military affairs, confirmed the implementation
plan had been approved in a call with reporters from the Farnborough
Airshow in the United Kingdom. Kaidanow is leading the U.S. delegation
at the show. In April, [Trump signed a national security policy
memorandum outlining a new arms transfer policy]{.underline} that calls
for the consideration of "economic security" when weighing the benefits
of a potential weapon sale. The idea is to boost American jobs and more
aggressively advocate on behalf of the U.S. defense industry by
competing for sales in key regions against firms from China and Russia.

### Solvency -- Presidential Directives -- AT Rollback (Congress)

#### Congress won't rollback the plan -- decades of data are on our side 

Graham **Dodds, 2013,** "Take Up Your Pen: Unilateral Presidential
Directives in American Politics," University of Pennsylvania Press,
p.12-13, mm

However, [the limits on unilateral presidential directives are less
confining that one might think]{.underline}. First, there is a great
deal of leeway between the limits of the Constitution and the will of
Congress. [As long as a unilateral presidential directive does not
clearly violate the Constitution or a law, it is potentially
legitimat]{.underline}e. Second, [while]{.underline} [the
legislative]{.underline} and judicial branches [can overturn unilateral
presidential directives, they seldom do so]{.underline}. In terms of the
judiciary's curtailment of unilateral presidential directives, Kenneth
Mayer reports that ''between 1789 and 1956, state and federal courts
overturned only 16 executive orders.''50 The number overturned in more
recent years has been correspondingly small: according to Terry Moe and
William Howell, of the roughly 4,000 executive orders issued between
1942 and 1996, only 86 were challenged in court, and presidents won in
86 percent of those few cases. The rare occasions when courts do
overturn executive orders may be dramatic, but they are very much the
exception rather than the rule.51 By some accounts, even the Court's
decision in Youngstown Sheet & Tube Co. v. Sawyer, 343 U.S. 579 (1952),
against Harry Truman's seizure of the steel industry was more of a fluke
than a broad, principled curtailment of unilateral presidential
action.52 It is not clear whether several court decisions against George
W. Bush's directives for suspected terrorists detained in Guantanamo
constitute a major rebuke or are of more limited or narrow significance.
Similarly, [congressional attempts to reverse particular executive
orders are rare and seldom successful.]{.underline} According to Neil
Kinkopf, a special assistant to the Office of Legal Counsel at the
Department of Justice under Clinton, ''In the 25 years
[from]{.underline} January [1973 through]{.underline} the end of
[1997]{.underline}, [legislation to overturn an executive order was
introduced on 37 occasions]{.underline}.''53 Moe and Howell report that
[only 3 of those 37 attempts were successful]{.underline}.54 According
to Mayer, ''Congress \[has\] explicitly invalidated an executive order
of any substance'' only twice since 1970.55 And Adam Warber finds that
while [Congress terminated 206 executive orders between 1936 and 2001,
those amounted to only 4.7 percent of all significant executive orders
issued during that time]{.underline}.56

#### Congress won't rollback the plan -- unpopular directives by Bush prove 

Graham **Dodds, 2013**, "Take Up Your Pen: Unilateral Presidential
Directives in American Politics," University of Pennsylvania Press,
p.243-244,mm

[As for the legislature, Congress has at times protested unilateral
presidential directives, but it has not done so consistently or
successfully]{.underline}.58 Congress could speak out against a
particular unilateral presidential directive, it could use its power of
the purse to block the implementation of a directive, it could reverse
or nullify a directive, and it could even pass legislation to curtail
executive unilateralism more generally. Additionally, Congress could
pass legislation to clarify the many different types of presidential
documents and require their regular publication, thereby possibly
preventing executive obfuscation by using memoranda and other directives
in lieu of executive orders and proclamations. A Senate report of 1974
noted that ''the fundamental ambiguity and arbitrariness in the use of
Executive orders remains one of the most troubling problems of public
administration yet to be resolved by Congress.''59 In terms of the
practice of presidents using different unilateral tools instead of
executive orders, the report stated that ''remedial legislation to
correct this recent practice of public administration should be a
priority for Congress.''60 Nearly four decades later, Congress has yet
to act on this priority. [And it does not appear that Congress will
stand up to the president anytime soon]{.underline}.61 Consider the
following account by the renowned author Joan Didion of a congressional
hearing during George W. Bush's first term: when a former longtime
member of the House of Representatives, Lee Hamilton, suggested at a
hearing of the Senate Governmental Affairs Committee that
recommendations of the 9/11 Commission could be put in effect by
''executive order,'' \[there was\] not only no polarization but
virtually no response, no discussion of why someone who had long
resisted the expansion of executive power now seemed willing to suggest
that a major restructuring of the government proceed on the basis of the
president's signature alone. ''And usually, given my background, you'd
expect me to say it's better to have a statute in back of it,'' he said.
Was he suggesting a way to shortcut the process on only minor points?
Or, since he seemed to be talking about major changes, was he simply
trying to guide the Senate to the urgency of the matter? Such questions
did not enter the discourse. There was only silence, general
acquiescence, as if any lingering memory of a separation of powers had
been obliterated.62 This clearly demonstrates the fact that [Congress is
simply not interested in reining in unilateral executive
policymaking]{.underline}. [The]{.underline} more recent examples of
Congress's reactions to George W. [Bush's controversial
directive]{.underline}s for detainment and domestic spying [underscore
the point]{.underline}, as [Congress initially expressed outrage, then
became silent, and eventually passed legislation essentially to endorse
the president's action]{.underline}. As Senator Sheldon Whitehouse
(D-RI) said in late 2007 regarding Bush's order for domestic spying,
''When the Congress of the United States is willing to roll over for an
unprincipled President, this is where you end up.''63

Graham **Dodds, 2013**, "Take Up Your Pen: Unilateral Presidential
Directives in American Politics," University of Pennsylvania Press,
p.243, mm

Even though it seems to go against the Madisonian system of the three
branches having the motive and means to resist encroachment upon their
own constitutional purview, the other two branches largely accept the
regular use of unilateral presidential directives for important
purposes. They could and should resist it, but they do not. [There are
likely a variety of reasons for the interbranch acquiescence to
executive unilateralism]{.underline}, but it nevertheless calls into
question the efficacy of the constitutional system.57 As we have seen,
[the judiciary began to accept executive orders and proclamations in the
early nineteenth century and has seldom questioned their propriety since
the early twentieth century]{.underline}. The court cases against
Truman's steel seizure, Clinton's ban on replacing striking workers, and
Bush's detention of suspected terrorists are the rare exceptions that
prove the rule. [Even with a more politicized judiciary and more brazen
unilateral presidential directives, it does not appear that courts will
significantly curtail executive unilateralism anytime soon.]{.underline}

### Solvency -- Presidential Directives -- AT Rollback (Executive)

#### Future presidents won't roll back the plan -- even ideological opposites will preserve it to institutionalize strong executive power

Sharece **Thrower**, July **2017**, (Ast. Prof. of political science at
Vanderbilt), American Journal of Political Science, "To Revoke or Not
Revoke? The Political Determinants of Executive Order Longevity," 61(3),
p. 654, mm

Consistent with previous arguments (Warber 2006),the results show
presidents are more likely to revoke ex-ecutive orders issued by
ideologically opposed administrations. These findings are consistent
with the idea that ideological drift can lead to policy termination
(Carpenter and Lewis 2004; Lewis 2002, 2003). Yet, no other studies have
systematically applied this to presidential unilateral-ism. Even
further, [this study is the first to show the limitations of ideological
drift by finding that the strength of an executive order's authority
mitigates its risk of revocation]{.underline}. [Put differently,
ideological targeting only occurs on executive orders based on weaker
constitutional author-ity]{.underline}. [Presidents' desire to maintain
sources of institutional authority and political support outweighs their
tendency to revoke orders from political adversaries. This finding shows
a limitation to ideological drift and sheds light on which policies are
more resilient]{.underline}, contributing to the larger literature on
policymaking and termination. Other studies of policy implements can
examine these and other limitations of ideological drift.

#### Presidential directive memos are particularly difficult for future presidents to roll back

Jon **Woolley** **and** Gerhard **Peters**, June **2017**, \[Woolley is
a prof. Of political science at the Univ. of CA, Santa Barbara; Peters
is a prof. Of political science at Citrus College and co-director of the
American Presidency Project\], Presidential Studies Quarterly, "The
Contemporary Presidency: Do Presidential Memo Orders Substitute for
Executive Orders? New Data," 47(2), Wiley Online Library, mm

[An enduring assumption about presidents is that they seek to make
innovations that will be difficult for subsequent presidents to
reverse]{.underline}. [This]{.underline}, for example, [provides a
powerful explanation for why presidents may choose to focus their
attention on making policy changes through regulations rather than
orders]{.underline}. [With regulations, responsibility for action is in
administrative agencie]{.underline}s[; regulations are far more
difficult to reverse than presidential orders]{.underline}. But this
interest does not seem to speak very clearly to the overall increase in
the volume of memo orders---even if memo orders are a more likely choice
than EOs to guide regulatory priorities. [Because memo orders take many
forms and are not centrally catalogued, it could be marginally more
difficult for incoming presidents to efficiently identify and reverse
all of the objectionable actions of their predecessors taken through
memo orders.]{.underline} But, given the timing of the rise of memo
orders, one would also need to argue that, as with the regulatory focus
noted above, it took some time for presidents to fully realize the
benefits of this practice. The notion that innovation often occurs
gradually is certainly a familiar one.

### Solvency -- Presidential Directives -- AT Rollback (National Security)

#### The national security nature of the directive ensures it will be upheld 

Graham **Dodds, 2013**, "Take Up Your Pen: Unilateral Presidential
Directives in American Politics," University of Pennsylvania Press,
p.187, mm

[When national security is at stake and the president acts in his
capacity as commander in chief, Congress, courts, and the American
people generally comply.]{.underline} (Harry Truman's steel seizure is
an important exception to this rule, and I discuss it in the section on
labor in this chapter.) And of course military matters often call for
exigent executive action. So [it makes sense that presidents have often
turned to unilateral directives for national security]{.underline} and
war. But this is especially so for presidents since FDR. Sometimes these
directives are military orders, but [presidents have]{.underline} also
[frequently used]{.underline} executive orders, proclamations,
memoranda, and other nonmilitary [unilateral directives to deal
with]{.underline} war and [national security.]{.underline}

### AT "Presidential Directive Spec"

#### The type of directive is irrelevant -- they are all functionally the same 

Graham **Dodds, 2013**, "Take Up Your Pen: Unilateral Presidential
Directives in American Politics," University of Pennsylvania Press, p.
5-6, mm

[There are over two dozen different types of unilateral presidential
directives]{.underline}. A study by the Congressional Research Service
(CRS) in 2007 identified twenty-seven distinct types: administrative
orders, certificates, designations of officials, executive orders,
general licenses, homeland security presidential directives,
interpretations, letters on tariffs and international trade, military
orders, thirteen different types of national security instruments,
presidential announcements, presidential findings, presidential
reorganization plans, proclamations, and regulations.17 That list fails
to mention presidential determinations and memoranda, so the total
number of types of unilateral presidential directives may be
twenty-nine.18 [But the different names do not always designate
different ''tools'']{.underline}: [many directives are very similar in
terms of their substance and authority, regardless of what the president
decides to call them]{.underline}.19 [And the definitions of many of
these devices are ambiguous or even nonexistent]{.underline}.

#### Lack of consistency means it is best to interpret directives broadly

Graham **Dodds, 2013**, "Take Up Your Pen: Unilateral Presidential
Directives in American Politics," University of Pennsylvania Press,
p.9-10,mm

[The ambiguous number and nature of unilateral presidential
directives]{.underline}, and the unclear relations among them, can
easily lead to confusion. For example, George H. W. Bush's Executive
Order 12,807 of 1992 was intended to direct the Coast Guard to return
Haitian refugees to Haiti. However, the order did not specifically
mention Haitian refugees per se. That detail was contained in a press
release, which stated: ''President Bush has issued an executive order
which will permit the U.S. Coast Guard to begin returning Haitians
picked up at sea directly to Haiti.'' In Sale v. Haitian Centers
Council, 509 U.S. 155 (1993), the Supreme Court ruled that the press
release was a sufficient articulation of the policy, as if inexactitude
in unilateral presidential directives were to be expected and
tolerated.43 [Such confusion can be compounded by the fact that
presidents are generally free to decide what to call a particular
directive and can even create entirely new types of directives if they
want]{.underline}.44 [Given the ambiguity among the different types of
unilateral presidential directives, it makes sense to construe the topic
broadly]{.underline}, [rather than to focus narrowly on one particular
type.]{.underline} This book focuses mostly on executive orders,
proclamations, and memoranda. They are arguably the most common, most
important, and most accessible types of unilateral presidential
directives, and they are similar in their justifications and usage.
Furthermore, I focus on nonmilitary directives, since military orders
are a fairly discrete set of unilateral presidential directives, and
insofar as they are rooted in the president's constitutional position as
commander in chief, they may be less constitutionally controversial. I
also exclude presidential signing statements from my analysis, since
they also constitute a distinctly different type of unilateral
presidential tool, and they differ from other directives in that they
are less clearly legally binding.45

Lastly, it is essential that the United States improve its ability to
partner with allies through defense trade, while at the same time
protecting sensitive technologies. While there has been significant
growth in defense trade during this administration, particularly with
emerging powers like India, there is room to do more. The United States
must continue to expand defense trade with new partners in Asia, Africa,
and Latin America, as well as with longstanding partners. However, [U.S.
ability to partner with countries and protect sensitive U.S.
technologies, is put at risk by our antiquated and unnecessarily
complicated system of export controls and regulations. Spread across
seven primary departments, the current export control system operates
under laws written in the 1970s and is designed to address the
challenges of the Cold War. It causes significant ambiguity and
confusion for U.S. companies and leads to jurisdictional disputes
between departments, delaying clear license decisions for months and
even years. This is bad for U.S. business, it is bad for enforcing U.S.
export control requirements, and it is bad for the ability to prosecute
those who violate U.S. export control laws.]{.underline}

### AT Assistance DA -- Assistance Bad

#### Robust evidence proves security assistance programs fail -- arms transfer will only aggravate security threats 

Christina **Arabia**, 7/15/**19**, Lawfare, \[director of the security
assistance monitor program at the Center for International Policy\],
" Disappearing transparency in U.S. arms sales,"
https://www.lawfareblog.com/disappearing-transparency-us-arms-sales, mm

In the nearly two decades since 9/11, [the United States has
increasingly relied on security assistance programs to]{.underline}
train, advise and equip foreign military and police forces in an effort
to [fight threats before they reach the United States]{.underline}.
These programs, mainly funded by the State Department and implemented by
the Defense Department, have continued to expand in scope, cost and
global reach under the assumption that the enhanced capabilities of
foreign partners would benefit U.S. national security. Between fiscal
years 2001 and 2018, the United States spent about \$310 billion through
security assistance and delivered more than \$330 billion in U.S.-made
weapons. But despite such staggering sums, [there is little evidence
that such programs have made the U.S. any safer.]{.underline} According
to a 2016 RAND Corp. report, [the rapid]{.underline} and piecemeal
[expansion]{.underline} [of]{.underline} Defense Department-funded
[security aid programs]{.underline}---referred to as "security
cooperation" or "building partner capacity" by the Pentagon---[led to
redundancies, limitations, gaps and incoherent strategy.]{.underline}
Problematic in their own right, these issues also hindered Congress from
providing effective oversight. Nowhere has this been more evident than
in the aftermath of the attack that killed four U.S. troops in Niger in
October 2017, when it was revealed that a number of senators were
completely unaware that the Defense Department had been conducting
security cooperation with Nigerien counterterrorism units. What's more,
[there is evidence that U.S. security assistance programs are fraught
with problems that]{.underline}, in some cases, [have increased the
threats that the assistance was intended to
combat]{.underline}---undermining U.S. goals in the process. In many
countries, [American weapons have been used to commit serious human
rights violations, increasing anti-American sentiment around the
world.]{.underline} They have contributed to the wasting of tens of
billions of dollars worth of taxpayer money as [foreign governments use
U.S. weapons improperly or divert them to U.S. adversaries]{.underline}.
[These setbacks have prolonged U.S. military engagements]{.underline} in
Afghanistan, Iraq and Syria, putting more American lives at risk. [Many
of these setbacks come from U.S. policies and programs that focus on
containing immediate security risks in fragile states yet fail to align
those goals with critical long-term strategies such as strengthening
governance. The "quick-fix" nature of security assistance often means
that programs are not tailored to the country's political context or the
structure of its security forces]{.underline}.

#### Security assistance through arms transfers creates a moral hazard that increases internal state conflict 

**Tankel, 18** -- Assistant Professor in the School of International
Service at American University and a non-resident senior fellow at the
Center for New American Security (Stephen, "Policy Roundtable: The Pros
and Cons of Security Assistance," The Future of Security Assistance,

Andrew Boutton draws on academic research, including his own, to dig
into why [efforts to build partnership capacity for internal defense ---
especially in the areas of counterterrorism and counterinsurgency ---
have often failed to achieve their objectives.]{.underline} [He assesses
various explanations, including selection bias, i.e., countries
receiving assistance that were already beset by numerous problems;
technical issues with capacity-building programs themselves; and
divergent threat perceptions between the United States and partner
countries]{.underline}. Boutton finds that although such variables do
matter --- more in some instances than others --- [the overriding
challenge, at least in countries where recipient regimes are riven by
internal power struggles and institutions are underdeveloped, is the
creation of moral hazard]{.underline}. Specifically, [leaders in these
countries use assistance and cooperation to coup-proof their regimes,
believing that the United States will not abandon them despite their bad
behavior. In some cases, security assistance and cooperation can
actually **provoke or increase internal violence as a
result**.]{.underline}

#### Empirics prove security assistance fails to stop terrorist and instability

**Boutton, 18** -- assistant professor of political science at the
University of Central Florida. His research interests include U.S.
foreign policy, terrorism, counterinsurgency, and the politics of
international cooperation in weak and authoritarian regimes. He received
his Ph.D. in international relations from Pennsylvania State University
in 2014. Prior to coming to UCF, he spent a year as a fellow at the
Strauss Center for International Security and Law at the University of
Texas (Andrew, "Policy Roundtable: The Pros and Cons of Security
Assistance," The Dangers of U.S. Military Assistance to Weak States,
November 20,
<https://tnsr.org/roundtable/policy-roundtable-the-pros-and-cons-of-security-assistance/)//vivienne>

In the years since World War II, [the United States has provided vast
amounts of military assistance to countries across the
globe]{.underline}. These countries have varied in their levels of
development and in their strategic importance to the United States. The
goal of [many of these post-9/11 programs has been to enable recipient
security forces to combat domestic insurgents, control their territory,
and withstand armed internal challenges]{.underline}.5 [The historical
record reveals that U.S. capacity-building efforts have often resulted
in **failure to achieve these goals**.]{.underline} What explains this?
[Selection bias]{.underline} undoubtedly [plays a minor
role]{.underline}: [Many recipient countries were already experiencing
persistent violence and serious political and institutional
dysfunction]{.underline}, which, [if they persist, can create the
impression that military assistance is failing.]{.underline} Other
explanations for these outcomes have emphasized [technical and tactical
problems with capacity-building]{.underline} [programs]{.underline},
which, while important, [overlook more fundamental political
obstacles]{.underline}. More recent explanations for the negative
consequences associated with military aid incorporate differences in
threat perceptions between the United States and host country,6 and the
problems of preference divergence inherent in U.S.-client
relationships.7 I build on these observations to argue that [in some
institutional contexts, U.S. military assistance will provoke or
escalate violence, even beyond what we might expect in the absence of
external assistance.]{.underline} Qualit[ative and quantitative evidence
suggests that in uncertain political environments --- where regimes are
riven by internal power struggles and institutions are underdeveloped
--- military aid can create a dangerous moral hazard.]{.underline}8 The
[provision of military assistance to vulnerable leaders increases
leaders' incentives to coup-proof their regimes, while also creating the
perception that the United States will continue to assist them in
dealing with the resulting violence. This combination explains why
capacity-building programs in weak states so often yield such
frustrating results.]{.underline} Coup-Proofing, Power Consolidation,
and Violence [Many of the top recipients of U.S. military
assistance]{.underline} --- both historically and since 9/11 --- [have
been institutionally weak and fragile]{.underline}. Leaders in these
countries are vulnerable to removal by government or military rivals,
and a unified, competent military capable of combating insurgents is
also capable of overthrowing the leader. As a result, [these leaders
have security priorities that differ substantially from those of the
United States.9 Rather than constructing competent and professionalized
militaries --- which is the stated aim of much U.S. military assistance
--- insecure leaders often seek to coup-proof their security forces in
order to ensure their own political and physical survival.]{.underline}
Coup-proofing refers to a broad set of actions a leader takes to prevent
a military coup. **[Paranoid leaders will often meddle with their
security forces]{.underline}**. For instance, they may sacrifice
competence in favor of political allegiance in military promotions,
removing qualified officers and stacking their security forces with
family or ethnic kin who are less competent but politically loyal.10
[Another typical action is to create bifurcated security forces, in
which smaller but politically reliable units tasked with regime
protection receive special treatment and U.S. military training,11 with
the rest left to wither on the vine. This reduces overall combat
leadership and effectiveness, and also degrades morale among the
rank-and-file soldiers whose career prospects are
blocked.]{.underline}12 Coup-proofed military forces are often unable or
unwilling to defend the regime,13 which explains why militaries in weak
states so often fold in the face of far smaller insurgent armies.
[Another form of coup-proofing involves the leader consolidating power
around himself and a small group of insiders. This entails denying the
broader population access to political power, using state resources for
patronage instead of public goods,14 and governing through exclusion by
eliminating rivals or potential rivals from the regime and military
through purges.]{.underline} From the leader's perspective,
coup-proofing may appear to be the best strategy to retain power.15
However, these actions have two important consequences that directly
undermine the objectives of most U.S. military assistance programs.
First, [power consolidation necessarily alienates powerful factions in
society and key figures in the regime or military]{.underline}. For
example, [if a leader purges the wrong military officer or attempts an
ill-timed power grab, it can provoke a backlash. The purged factions
often respond by launching a rebellion, and this dynamic has been shown
to be an important cause of civil wars, particularly in Africa.16
Second, by dividing the security forces and degrading their leadership
and morale, coup-proofing impairs the regime's ability to combat
domestic insurgents.]{.underline} These actions thus produce the dual
effects of increasing the likelihood of domestic insurgency while
decreasing the regime's ability to effectively deal with it. Although
leaders have other, more peaceful options to insulate themselves from
coups --- such as the formation of inclusive power-sharing agreements17
--- **[the provision of U.S. military assistance can induce
overconfidence in the recipient regime]{.underline}**.18 [This often
causes leaders to opt for these more aggressive forms of coup-proofing,
gambling that the United States will continue providing aid to help
quell the resulting violence.]{.underline}

### AT Assistance DA -- AT Allied Prolif

#### Even if the plan undermines certain security assurances -- plenty of obstacles prevent allies from going nuclear 

Jeffrey **Knopf**, **2017**, Contemporary Security Policy, "security
assurances and proliferation risks in the trump administration," 38(1),
JSTOR, mm

Assurance is partly a matter of perceptions. And the things U.S.
presidents do and say can affect these perceptions. Because of the
institutional features of U.S. alliances, [[a Trump administration
cannot completely undermine U.S. security
assurances]{.mark}.]{.underline} But it could increase the doubts in the
minds of key allies. [Fortunately, [security guarantees are not the only
factor that inhibits nuclear proliferation]{.mark}.]{.underline} Many
research studies, including my own referenced above, have found that
security guarantees can contribute to state decisions to forswear
nuclear weapons. But [it is important not to overstate the importance of
security assurances. [Even in cases where they were a major factor is a
country's decision to renounce nuclear weapons, this does not mean that
a weakening of security guarantees would automatically reverse that
decision]{.mark}]{.underline}. [[Once a state commits to a non-nuclear
course, multiple factors can come into play to reinforce that
decision]{.underline}.]{.mark} Non-proliferation has many causes, and a
weakening of one cause does not diminish the impact of the other factors
involved. [There are several considerations that could encourage states
to remain non-nuclear. [U.S. allies]{.mark} in Europe and the
Asia-Pacific that gave up]{.underline} potential [nuclear weapons
ambitions]{.underline} have [[all signed the]{.underline}]{.mark}
nuclear non-proliferation treaty ([[NPT]{.underline}]{.mark}) as
non-nuclear weapon states. [This creates a legal commitment they might
not wish to abrogate,]{.underline} for example [because doing so would
harm their reputations]{.underline} with respect to keeping their other
treaty commitments. In some cases, [[countries have also passed domestic
laws that similarly commit them to refrain from seeking nuclear
weapons]{.underline}]{.mark}. [The NPT]{.underline} also places peaceful
nuclear activities under international safeguards, which [makes it
harder for a state to develop a nuclear weapons capability without being
detected]{.underline}. [Furthermore, some countries have internalized
non-proliferation norms]{.underline} or embraced identities as advocates
for a nuclear-free world, [and it will not be an easy or quick matter to
rethink these identities. [Many countries also have strong domestic
opinion against nuclear weapons]{.mark}]{.underline} (though South Korea
is a major exception here), [and politicians who want to initiate a
nuclear weapons program will not necessarily be able to overcome these
domestic constraints]{.underline}. [Countries that explored]{.underline}
[nuclear weapons]{.underline} development [in the past]{.underline} only
to give up this option will likely also [have allowed aspects of
their]{.underline} relevant scientific [expertise and]{.underline}
technical [infrastructure to atrophy]{.underline}, [and it could take
some time to rebuild their capabilities.]{.underline} Finally, [even in
the face of doubts about]{.underline} the [credibility]{.underline} of
U.S. END, [[states could conclude that the security risks of seeking an
independent nuclear arsenal still outweigh the
benefits]{.mark}.]{.underline} In sum, [[even if]{.mark}]{.underline}
President [[Trump ends up weakening U.S. security
guarantees]{.underline}, **[this will not immediately open the
floodgates to a wave of new proliferation]{.underline}**]{.mark}. Any
moves by U.S. allies to consider a nuclear weapons option will likely be
slow and hesitant. This will leave time for another U.S. election cycle
to come around and perhaps produce another change of administration. If
the president who succeeds Donald Trump is committed to
non-proliferation, she or he will likely enter office in circumstances
in which it is still possible to repair the credibility of U.S. security
guarantees and prevent U.S. allies from going nuclear.

### AT Assistance DA -- Turn - Alliances Bad

#### Burden sharing fails in practice -- we shoulder most of the burden and it encourages free riding

Barry **Posen**, Jan/Feb **2013**, Foreign Affairs, (Posen is a Prof of
Poli Sci at MIT), \"Pull back: the case for a less activist foreign
policy,\" 92.1, Proquest

[[Another]{.underline} [problematic]{.underline} [response]{.underline}
[to]{.underline}]{.mark} the United States\' [[grand strategy comes
from]{.underline}]{.mark} its friends:
[[free-riding]{.mark}.]{.underline} The [Cold War alliances]{.underline}
that the country has worked so hard to maintain-namely, nato and the
U.S.- Japanese security agreement-have provided U.S. partners in Europe
and Asia with such a high level of insurance that they
[have]{.underline} [been]{.underline} [able to steadily shrink their
militaries and outsource their defense to Washington.]{.underline}
European nations have cut their military spending by roughly 15 percent
in real terms since the end of the Cold War, with the exception of the
United Kingdom, which will soon join the rest as it carries out its
austerity policy. Depending on how one counts, Japanese defense spending
has been cut, or at best has remained stable, over the past decade. The
government has unwisely devoted too much spending to ground forces, even
as its leaders have expressed alarm at the rise of Chinese military
power-an air, missile, and naval threat.¶ Although these regions have
avoided major wars, [the United States has had to bear more and more of
the burden of keeping the peace.]{.underline} It now spends 4.6 percent
of its gdp on defense, whereas its European nato allies collectively
spend 1.6 percent and Japan spends 1.0 percent. With their high per
capita gdps, these allies can afford to devote more money to their
militaries, yet they have no incentive to do so. And so while the U.S.
government considers draconian cuts in social spending to restore the
United States\' fiscal health, it continues to subsidize the security of
Germany and Japan. This is welfare for the rich.¶ U.S. [[security
guarantees]{.underline}]{.mark} also [[encourage]{.underline}]{.mark}
plucky [[allies to challenge more powerful states]{.underline}]{.mark},
confident that Washington will save them in the end-[**[a classic case
of moral hazard]{.underline}**.]{.mark} [[This phenomenon has caused the
United States to incur political costs, antagonizing
powers]{.underline}]{.mark} great and small for no gain [[and
encouraging them to seek opportunities to provoke the United States in
return]{.underline}]{.mark}. So far, the United States has escaped
getting sucked into unnecessary wars, although Washington dodged a
bullet in Taiwan when the Democratic Progressive Party of Chen Shui-bian
governed the island, from 2000 to 2008. His frequent allusions to
independence, which ran counter to U.S. policy but which some Bush
administration officials reportedly encouraged, unnecessarily provoked
the Chinese government; had he proceeded, he would have surely triggered
a dangerous crisis. Chen would never have entertained such reckless
rhetoric absent the long-standing backing of the U.S. government.¶ The
Philippines and Vietnam (the latter of which has no formal defense
treaty with Washington) also seem to have figured out that they can
needle China over maritime boundary disputes and then seek shelter under
the U.S. umbrella when China inevitably reacts. [Not only do these
disputes make it harder for Washington to cooperate with
Beijing]{.underline} on issues of global importance; they also [risk
roping the United States into conflicts over strategically marginal
territory]{.underline}.¶ Georgia is another state that has played this
game to the United States\' detriment. Overly confident of Washington\'s
affection for it, the tiny republic deliberately challenged Russia over
control of the disputed region of South Ossetia in August 2008.
Regardless of how exactly the fighting began, Georgia acted far too
adventurously given its size, proximity to Russia, and distance from any
plausible source of military help. This needless war ironically made
Russia look tough and the United States unreliable.¶ This dynamic is at
play in the Middle East, too. Although U.S. officials have communicated
time and again to leaders in Jerusalem their discomfort with Israeli
settlements on the territory occupied during the 1967 war, Israel
regularly increases the population and dimensions of those settlements.
The United States\' military largess and regular affirmations of support
for Israel have convinced Israeli hawks that they will suffer no
consequences for ignoring U.S. advice. It takes two to make peace in the
Israeli-Palestinian conflict, but the creation of humiliating facts on
the ground will not bring a negotiated settlement any closer. And
Israel\'s policies toward the Palestinians are a serious impediment to
improved U.S. relations with the Arab world.

#### Security assistance fails and increase the risk of nuclear war

Ted **Carpenter**, 7/14/**19**, (a senior fellow in security studies at
the Cato Institute), The National Interest, "America should rethink its
commitments to allies,"
https://nationalinterest.org/blog/skeptics/america-should-rethink-its-commitments-allies-66922,
mm

[Because the Cold War ended quietly, U.S. leaders concluded that
extended deterrence had worked]{.underline} well and that it would have
general applicability in a different era and under different
circumstances. [That may be a very faulty assumption]{.underline}.
Although Kremlin officials apparently believed that the United States
might risk even nuclear war to defend a major strategic and economic
prize like Western Europe, they may have far greater doubts whether
Washington would actually carry out a similar policy to shield small
countries on Russia's border. [At a minimum, the danger of
miscalculation is substantially greater. Extended deterrence also
entails elevated risks for the United States]{.underline} in its
confrontations with North Korea and Iran. Although the evidence is not
definitive, it is likely that Pyongyang already has a small nuclear
arsenal, and the North Korean regime certainly has worked diligently to
build a reliable missile delivery system. Iran's program is not as
advanced. Tehran has not conducted any nuclear tests (in contrast to
North Korea's multiple tests since 2006), and the multilateral Joint
Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA) which Tehran signed in 2015, put
major limits on its nuclear program. Washington's withdrawal from that
agreement angered the Iranian government, yet it is only now that Tehran
may have exceeded the limits the JCPOA set on uranium enrichment.
Washington clearly is worried about the nuclear ambitions of its two
adversaries. Yet the chance that Pyongyang would launch a premeditated
attack on the United States remains extremely remote---and will continue
to do so even if North Korea's nuclear arsenal expands. Several experts
have noted that nuclear weapons may be the ultimate deterrent, but they
are far less useful for intimidation, much less war fighting. Indeed,
the latter applies only if a country's political leadership is willing
to commit national and personal suicide. There is no evidence that North
Korea's leaders fit that description, and the same is true of Iranian
leaders. Even if Iran eventually builds a small nuclear arsenal, it is
more likely for the purpose of deterring any forcible regime-change
ambitions that Washington might harbor than waging a suicidal war by
attacking the American homeland. [The risk factor rises]{.underline},
though, [if the United States insists on continuing to shield allies and
clients in East Asia and the Middle East]{.underline}. Given the
political division of the Korean Peninsula and the tensions it has
generated over the past seven decades, the danger of an armed conflict
involving North Korea and its neighbors is ever present. [America
becoming entangled in such a conflict because of its security
guarantees]{.underline} to Seoul and Tokyo [is the one credible
scenario]{.underline} [that might culminate in a]{.underline} North
Korean [nuclear attack on the United States.]{.underline} A similar risk
is building in the Middle East, where the United States has foolishly
injected itself into Iran's quarrels with both Israel and key Arab
powers such as Saudi Arabia. Again, the likelihood of even a
nuclear-armed Iran launching an attack on the American homeland out of
the blue is highly improbable. A war between Tehran and one or more of
its adversaries that spirals out of control and snares the United States
because of Washington's implicit security commitments to Israel and/or
Saudi Arabia is, unfortunately, a much greater danger. [U.S. leaders can
retain a high level of confidence in the reliability of direct
deterrence. But extended deterrence]{.underline} in both East Asia and
the Middle East [entails an already excessive]{.underline}---[and
rising---level of risk]{.underline}. [Washington should inform its
allies that it is no longer willing to incur that risk]{.underline}.
Those allies would then need to decide whether to build their own modest
nuclear deterrents as a more reliable insurance policy. (Indeed, one of
the worst-kept secrets in international affairs is that Israel already
has such an arsenal.) In short, the United States needs to off-load the
risks to countries that have more direct interests at stake in deterring
North Korea and Iran.

#### Security commitments incentive client states to act aggressively -- creates a moral hazard and causes conflict -- empirical research proves 

Neil **Narang** **and** Rupal **Mehta**, **2017**, \[Narang is a prof.
of political science and UC-Santa Barbara; Mehta is a prof. of political
science at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln\], The Journal of Conflict
Resolution, "the unforeseen consequences of extended deterrence: moral
hazard in a nuclear client state," Sage, mm

In this article, we address a long-standing question in the academic and
policy communities about the role of nuclear umbrellas in broader
interstate relations. Specifically, [[we examine how client states
behave under the protection of a nuclear patron by investigating two
important dimensions of behavior: the initiation of militarized disputes
and bargaining outcomes short of war]{.mark}. [We find
that]{.mark},]{.underline} although client states protected under a
nuclear umbrella are no more likely to initiate MIDs against a target
state that escalate to war or the reciprocated use of force, [[these
states]{.underline}]{.mark}, nevertheless, [[appear more emboldened to
initiate]{.underline} [crises]{.underline}]{.mark}. However, these
crises tend not to escalate to higher levels of militarized conflict
because target states appear to act in equilibrium: preferring to settle
disputes peacefully rather than resist militarily through costly
fighting. [We find that client states protected under a nuclear umbrella
are more often the recipients of policy concessions from their targets
compared to states that lack protection under a nuclear
umbrella]{.underline}. [Together, [these results provide comprehensive
support for our argument that there is some risk of moral hazard in a
client state protected under a nuclear umbrella, as clients appear
**more emboldened** and **more successful** at revising the status
quo]{.mark} in expectation of a patron coming to their aid. The urgency
to understand the strategic consequences of nuclear umbrellas is perhaps
most real today,]{.underline} as the United States seeks to rebalance
its overall security portfolio to the Asia-Pacific in anticipation of a
rising China and to provide additional assurances to its allies in the
Middle East in light of potential proliferation challenges. And yet,
[[we have surprisingly little evidence that such commitments are
effective at reducing the risk of conflict]{.underline}]{.mark} on net,
given the widely presumed, but still untested, risk for moral hazard in
the client state. Meanwhile, policymakers in the United States and
abroad continue to propose expanding the US nuclear umbrella while
further reassuring allies covered within it. [Our research suggests that
the expansion of the nuclear umbrella may perversely exacerbate the
concerns of potential targets and inadvertently destabilize the status
quo by increasing the risk of a crisis and the opportunity for
bargaining to fail]{.underline}.

### AT Deterrence DA -- Not Key

#### No link -- reducing arms sales won't disrupt deterrence

A. Trevor **Thrall and** Caroline **Dorminey**, 3/13/18, \[Thrall is an
associate professor at the Schar School of Policy and Government at
George Mason; Dorminey is a policy analyst at the Cato Institute-, Cato
Institute, "risky business: the role of arms sales in US foreign
policy,"
https://www.cato.org/publications/policy-analysis/risky-business-role-arms-sales-us-foreign-policy,
mm

At the strategic level, the United States inhabits such an extremely
favorable security environment in the post-Cold War world that [most
arms sales do little or nothing to improve its security]{.underline}.
[Thanks to its geography, friendly]{.underline} (and weak)
[neighbors]{.underline}, [large and dynamic economy, and secure nuclear
arsenal, the United States faces very few significant
threats]{.underline}. There is no Soviet Union bent upon dominating
Europe and destroying the United States. China, despite its rapid rise,
cannot (and has no reason to) challenge the sovereignty or territorial
integrity of the United States. [Arms sales --- to allies or others ---
are unnecessary to deter major, direct threats to U.S. national security
in the current era]{.underline}.47 [Nor are arms sales necessary to
protect the United States from]{.underline} "falling dominoes," or the
consequences of [conflicts elsewhere]{.underline}. [The United States
enjoys]{.underline} what Eric Nordlinger called "[strategic
immunity]{.underline}."48 Simply put, [most of what happens in the rest
of the world is irrelevant to U.S. national security.]{.underline} The
United States has spent decades helping South Korea keep North Korea in
check, for example, but division of territory on the Korean peninsula
does not affect America's security. Likewise, civil wars in the Middle
East and Russia's annexation of Crimea might be significant for many
reasons, but those events do not threaten the ability of the United
States to defend itself. As a result, a decision to sell weapons to
Ukraine, Taiwan, or South Korea could significantly affect those
nations' security; doing so is not an act of ensuring U.S. national
security.

### AT DIB DA -- Foreign Sales Not Key

#### Foreign sales aren't key to maintain the defense industrial base

Andrew **Miller** **and** Seth **Binder**, 5/10/**19**, War on the
Rocks, "The case for arms embargoes against uncooperative partners,"
https://warontherocks.com/2019/05/the-case-for-arms-embargoes-against-uncooperative-partners/,
mm

Second, [Rounds]{.underline} also [overstates the costs of suspending
arms transfers]{.underline}. He is particularly focused on the potential
for losing "access," a term that encompasses relationships with the
recipient country's military leadership; insight into their views,
organization, and doctrine; and permission for the U.S. military to use
that country's bases and airspace. These are legitimate concerns, but
suspensions do not automatically compromise access. Egypt, for instance,
never curtailed the U.S. military ability to use the Suez Canal or
Egyptian airspace while arms transfers were on hold. And, while
intelligence about a foreign military is valuable, we often have other,
clandestine ways to acquire such information. Moreover, we should not
conflate access with influence. U.S. military officials had access to
their Egyptian counterparts during the events of 2013, but those
channels were of no use in deterring Egypt's military from removing the
country's democratically elected president. Nor has U.S access reduced
civilian casualties from Saudi-coalition bombing in Yemen. In these
cases, access without influence does not absolve the United States of
complicity. [The]{.underline} author's other [major concern is that arms
suspensions could result in the loss of arms sales to strategic
competitors like Russia or China.]{.underline} The jobs created by such
sales are not trivial matters, but [studies have found that they do not
provide the economic benefits or jobs that are often
touted]{.underline}. [Nor are these sales necessary to maintain the
military industrial base]{.underline}, [which is powered by billions of
dollars each year from domestic purchases]{.underline}, except in rare
cases. Fundamentally, the author's implicit argument --- that if the
United States reliably supplies weapons to strategically important
countries, they won't seek them elsewhere --- is suspect. Countries,
including close partners like Egypt and the United Arab Emirates, have
long sought to diversify their weapons stockpiles, and in an
increasingly multipolar world, more countries are seeking to diversify
their arms suppliers to maintain their own independence. While U.S. arms
will continue to compete with Russian or Chinese counterparts on a
sale-by-sale basis, it will become increasingly unrealistic to be the
exclusive supplier of any partner country, irrespective of how reliable
the United States is.

https://warontherocks.com/2018/04/americas-arms-sales-policy-security-abroad-not-jobs-at-home/,
mm

Even if the Trump administration boosts sales against such headwinds,
this will not create many additional jobs. [Arms exports are a
surprisingly inefficient means of employing people at home]{.underline}.
Using census data, [the Commerce Department estimates that a billion
dollars of defense exports would "create or sustain" 3,918
jobs]{.underline}, considerably fewer than the 5,700 jobs per billion
created by increased US exports more broadly. [Doubling]{.underline} the
United States' [annual]{.underline} [arms exports]{.underline} to \$40
billion, a highly unrealistic goal, [would]{.underline} thus [create
fewer than 80,000 new jobs]{.underline}. There are other industries the
United States can promote that will have larger effects on jobs. [One
reason defense exports appear to be inefficient employment generators is
that states that spend their own money on buying American weapons also
care about "jobs, jobs, jobs" for their own people, as well as
supporting their own aspirational defense industries. Most countries
require "offsets," mandating that a percentage of any arms
deal]{.underline} (often 50 to 100 percent) [must be re-invested in the
importing state's economy]{.underline}. Between 2013 and 2015, these
offsets, had the work been performed in the United States, would have
created or sustained over 46,000 jobs. In publicizing a recent Saudi
deal for 150 S-70 Black Hawk utility helicopters at roughly \$6 billion,
Lockheed Martin predicted that it would "support" 900 jobs. But half
those jobs would be in Saudi Arabia. [Yet another reason that arms
exports are an inefficient employment mechanism: Any additional U.S.
market share is likely to be heavily subsidized]{.underline}. In 2016,
the United States spent \$10 billion buying weapons for other countries,
roughly 10 percent of the entire global arms export market, equivalent
to Singapore's or Algeria's defense budget. Moreover, over the past six
years, the Defense Department waived another \$16 billion in normally
mandatory fees for Foreign Military Sales --- including \$3.5 billion
for a \$15 billion Saudi agreement --- largely to close deals that may
have gone to other suppliers. [In short, when it comes to boosting the
domestic economy, arms sales contain relatively little
juice]{.underline}. And, as we shall see, it may not be worth the
squeeze.

#### Not key -- most jobs are created abroad 

A. Trevor **Thrall and** Jordan **Cohen**, 4/5/**19**, Defense One, "the
false promises of trump's arms sales,"
https://www.defenseone.com/ideas/2019/04/false-promises-trumps-arms-sales/156071/,
mm

Finally, [Trump's claims about the economic benefits of arms sales ring
the hollowest of all]{.underline}. For starters, [not only won't arms
sales create a million new American jobs, but a great number of the jobs
created by arms sales will go to citizens of the purchasing
nations]{.underline}. As the Security Assistance Monitor report notes,
the number of licenses granted to weapons manufacturers outside the
United States doubled from 2017 to 2018. As a result, [more than
one-quarter of all U.S. arms "sales" last year were deals to permit the
manufacturing of U.S.-designed weapons under license --- that is, they
created jobs in other nations instead of the United State]{.underline}s.
The report also finds that [the Trump administration has sharply
increased the number of deals in which foreign countries produce
U.S.-developed weaponry under coproduction agreements, further reducing
the number of U.S. jobs tied to arms sales]{.underline}. [Weakening the
economic rationale even further is the fact that in order to seal major
deals, American defense contractors have to offer massive discounts, or
offsets, to the purchasing nations in the form of coproduction
arrangements or technology transfe]{.underline}r. In 2014, for example,
these offsets equaled roughly one-third of the value of total U.S. arms
sales. [These offsets mean not only that American arms sales are less
profitable than they appear on paper, but also that they lead to fewer
jobs created in the United States than many]{.underline}, including the
president, [would like to think]{.underline}. Trump's big Saudi arms
deal, for example, would likely lead to somewhere between 20,000 and
40,000 jobs, or less than two-tenths of one percent of the American
labor market. The unpleasant truth is that [the underwhelming economic
benefits cannot justify Washington's love of arms sales.]{.underline}
Arms sales simply do not benefit the U.S. economy nearly as much as
Trump likes to claim. Meanwhile, a large percentage of American arms
sales goes to countries with horrible human rights records, to nations
where arms are at risk of finding their way into the wrong hands, and to
nations embroiled in dangerous and destabilizing conflicts. Given this,
it is long past time to rethink American arms sales policy.

### AT Elections -- Link Turn -- Plan Unpopular

#### Cutting arms sales will trigger a national backlash -- Trump takes the blame since he passes the plan

William **Hartung**, 7/30/**16**, Mother Jones, "the us government is
literally arming the world, and nobody's even talking about it,"
https://www.motherjones.com/politics/2016/07/tomdispatch-dc-congress-defense-international-arms-business/,
mm

[Arms deals are a way of life in Washington]{.underline}. [From the
president on down, significant parts of the government are intent on
ensuring that American arms will flood the global m]{.underline}arket
and companies like Lockheed and Boeing will live the good life. From the
president on his trips abroad to visit allied world leaders to the
secretaries of state and defense to the staffs of US embassies, American
officials regularly act as salespeople for the arms firms. And the
Pentagon is their enabler. From brokering, facilitating, and literally
banking the money from arms deals to transferring weapons to favored
allies on the taxpayers' dime, it is in essence the world's largest arms
dealer. In a typical sale, the US government is involved every step of
the way. The Pentagon often does assessments of an allied nation's armed
forces in order to tell them what they "need"---and of course what they
always need is billions of dollars in new US-supplied equipment. Then
the Pentagon helps negotiate the terms of the deal, notifies Congress of
its details, and collects the funds from the foreign buyer, which it
then gives to the US supplier in the form of a defense contract. In most
deals, the Pentagon is also the point of contact for maintenance and
spare parts for any US-supplied system. The bureaucracy that helps make
all of this happen, the Defense Security Cooperation Agency, is funded
from a 3.5 percent surcharge on the deals it negotiates. This gives it
all the more incentive to sell, sell, sell. [And the pressure
for]{.underline} yet [more]{.underline} of the same [is always intense,
in part because the weapons makers are careful to spread their
production facilities **to as many states and localities as
possible.**]{.underline} [In this way, they ensure that endless support
for government promotion of major arms sales becomes part and parcel of
domestic politics.]{.underline} General Dynamics, for instance, has
managed to keep its tank plants in Ohio and Michigan running through a
combination of add-ons to the Army budget---funds inserted into that
budget by Congress even though the Pentagon didn't request them---and
exports to Saudi Arabia. Boeing is banking on a proposed deal to sell 40
F-18s to Kuwait to keep its St. Louis production line open, and is
currently jousting with the Obama administration to get it to move more
quickly on the deal. Not surprisingly, [members of Congress and local
business leaders in such states become strong supporters of weapons
exports]{.underline}.

### AT Fill-In DA -- Diversification Inevitable

#### Diversification is inevitable -- even are most reliable clients are turning to Russia and China

Andrew **Miller** **and** Seth **Binder**, 5/10/**19**, War on the
Rocks, "The case for arms embargoes against uncooperative partners,"
https://warontherocks.com/2019/05/the-case-for-arms-embargoes-against-uncooperative-partners/,
mm

Second, [Rounds]{.underline} also [overstates the costs of suspending
arms transfers]{.underline}. [He is particularly focused on the
potential for losing "access]{.underline}," a term that encompasses
relationships with the recipient country's military leadership; insight
into their views, organization, and doctrine; and permission for the
U.S. military to use that country's bases and airspace. These are
legitimate concerns, but suspensions do not automatically compromise
access. Egypt, for instance, never curtailed the U.S. military ability
to use the Suez Canal or Egyptian airspace while arms transfers were on
hold. And, while intelligence about a foreign military is valuable, we
often have other, clandestine ways to acquire such information.
Moreover, we should not conflate access with influence. U.S. military
officials had access to their Egyptian counterparts during the events of
2013, but those channels were of no use in deterring Egypt's military
from removing the country's democratically elected president. Nor has
U.S access reduced civilian casualties from Saudi-coalition bombing in
Yemen. In these cases, access without influence does not absolve the
United States of complicity. The author's other major concern is that
arms suspensions could result in the loss of arms sales to strategic
competitors like Russia or China. The jobs created by such sales are not
trivial matters, but studies have found that they do not provide the
economic benefits or jobs that are often touted. Nor are these sales
necessary to maintain the military industrial base, which is powered by
billions of dollars each year from domestic purchases, except in rare
cases. Fundamentally, [the]{.underline} author's implicit
[argument]{.underline} --- [that if the United States reliably supplies
weapons to strategically important countries, they won't seek them
elsewhere --- is suspect.]{.underline} [Countries]{.underline},
[including close partners]{.underline} like Egypt and the United Arab
Emirates, [have long sought to diversify their weapons stockpiles, and
in an increasingly multipolar world,]{.underline} [more countries are
seeking to diversify their arms suppliers to maintain their own
independence]{.underline}. [While U.S. arms will continue to compete
with Russian or Chinese counterparts on a sale-by-sale
basis]{.underline}, [it will become increasingly unrealistic to be the
exclusive supplier of any partner country, irrespective of how reliable
the United States is]{.underline}.

### AT Politics -- Plan Popular

#### Congress supports reducing the executive's authority to conduct arms sales

Elias **Yousif**, 7/9/**19**, The hill, "congress needs more authority
in international arms sales,"
https://thehill.com/opinion/international/452290-congress-needs-more-authority-in-international-arms-sales,
mm

[Lawmakers]{.underline} who are now wo[rking to retroactively block arms
sales to Saudi Arabia and the UAE should consider adding caveats to the
president's emergency authority.]{.underline} The Saudi Arabia False
Emergencies (SAFE) Act, recently taken up by the Senate, is a good
start, and a promising opening salvo for their recuperation of authority
over arms transfer decision-making. More importantly, [the bipartisan
frustration with the president's insistence on sending weapons over the
heads of lawmakers should catalyze a serious conversation]{.underline}
on how the sales process is vetted under the watchful gaze of the public
eye, and just how much power should be vested in the executive branch.
Wednesday's Senate Foreign Relations Committee hearing on the
president's emergency declaration that expedited arms shipments to the
Gulf should serve as the new frontline in Congress's tug of war with the
White House. Lawmakers should not only demand answers on this specific
episode, but also draw a line in the sand for their own authority in the
broader arms sales process. [Ultimately, in an era of partisanship,
enshrining a more direct role for lawmakers in the arms sales process is
a good opportunity **for bipartisan consensus**.]{.underline} With a
president who has shown norms to be insufficient a check on executive
power, it is high time that lawmakers make a final stand for their role
as arbiters of the exports that enable warfare and conflict across the
globe.

### AT Taiwan DA -- AT UQ -- Abandonment Inevitable

#### Calls for abandonment are increasing -- the status quo Taiwan policy is unsustainable 

Gong **Lin** **and** Wenxing **Zhou**, August **2018**, China Review,
"Does Taiwan Matter to the United States?" 18(3), Research Gate, mm

[Although the status quo maintainers still belong to the
mainstream]{.underline} in the United States, [many Americans have begun
to rethink the Taiwan issue]{.underline} in U.S.-China relations. Among
them [some experts argue fo]{.underline}r the policy of Taiwan
[abandonment]{.underline} with various degrees, either for the sake of
U.S.-China cooperation (e.g., Owens, Gilley, Kent, Freeman), avoiding
military conflict with China (Carpenter and Glaser), or acknowledgments
of the greater trend of China\'s eventual reunification (e.g.,
Shambaugh, Prueher, Swaine, Sutter, McDevitt, Brzezinski or
Mearsheimer). Unlike Washington\'s tacit acceptance of Taiwan\'s
unification with the mainland for working with the PRC to counterbalance
against the Soviet Union in the 1970s and early 1980s, the argument that
Taiwan has to or should be abandoned advocated openly in unofficial
views in recent years have \[End Page 199\] aroused more public
attention and therefore more criticisms and reactions from status quo
maintainers and the \"Cold War minders.\" It remains empirically
underexplored to what extent these debates over Taiwan abandonment will
shape U.S. policy toward the Taiwan Strait. Drawing on interactions
among Beijing, Washington and Taipei over the past decades, the answer
to the question is often a big yes, evidenced by policy adjustments
following policy debates and their impact on the future trend of
U.S.-Taiwan relations. It is clear that arguments of Taiwan abandonment
between 2009 and 2014 are coincided with increasing U.S.-China
cooperation and smoothly peaceful development of cross-Strait relations.
The growing but limited tensions in both U.S.-China relations and
domestic politics of Taiwan in the late years of the Obama
administration may have increased the incentive and faith for Taiwan
watchers in the United States who want to maintain the status quo and
even play the Taiwan card. This may explain the decreasing voice of
Taiwan abandonment in the last couple of years of the Obama
administration. However, [if cross-Strait relations continue
deteriorating]{.underline} and kindle a new crisis in the near future or
the mainland loses patience in using peaceful means to resolve the
Taiwan issue, [it is safe to expect that voices of abandoning
Taiwan]{.underline} and avoiding war [will rise]{.underline}. Meanwhile,
it is also worthy to observe whether the \"Cold War minders\" would take
the opportunity to squeeze the space left over for strategic ambiguity,
thus disturbing the current status quo. On the other hand, if---an even
bigger if under the DPP administration---the two sides of the Taiwan
Strait move to negotiation on political integration based on growing
economic and social integrations in the future, both Taiwan abandoners
and Taiwan card players are expected to make bigger voices, as the
status quo then will become less maintainable. Absent of these two
scenarios, experts in the United States will still remain divided with
different degrees on the significance of Taiwan in the American global
strategic chessboard, with views driven mainly by national interest or
moral value, or a combination of different dimensions of them. Taiwan
abandonment and Taiwan card manipulation as policy options or public
debate issues will never vanish in American politics in the foreseeable
future. [While the status quo maintainers still command the central
position in the academic and policy circles, Taiwan abandoners and card
players will squeeze into the mainstream and exert their]{.underline}
respective [influences]{.underline} in different periods of time. [Under
the unpredictable Trump administration, one should never rule out the
possibility of U.S]{.underline}. \[End Page 200\] [Taiwan policy
shifts]{.underline} from one view toward the other. [Given the relative
decline of U.S. supremacy in Asia-Pacific, \"it would be unsurprising if
Americans were to turn to a more non-interventionist foreign
policy]{.underline}.\"68 According to Frank Klingberg, U.S. foreign
policy has oscillated between isolationism (introvert phase) and
internationalism (extrovert phase), with 25 years as a circle. He
predicted in 1990 that the next introvert phase should begin to set in
around 2014.69 It is too early to judge whether the antiglobalization
atmosphere in the United States and the election of Donald Trump as U.S.
president would affirm this interesting forecast. It may be safer to
say, however, [the significance of Taiwan for U.S. policy makers will
continue to decrease if the PRC and the United States increase their
strategic cooperation in the future]{.underline}. Only under this
circumstance can the final resolution of the Taiwan issue free itself
from external interference and influence.

#### Trump will play the Taiwan card to get concessions from China -- abandonment is inevitable

Gong **Lin** **and** Wenxing **Zhou**, August **2018**, China Review,
"Does Taiwan Matter to the United States?" 18(3), Research Gate, mm

Indeed, U.[S. policy to Taiwan has become less predictable
since]{.underline} President [Trump came to office]{.underline}. Many
uncertainties, such as the power struggle inside Trump\'s policy-making
circle between the nationalists and internationalists and the policy
debates between the hardline and moderate Republicans, have resulted in
the unpredictability of Trump\'s policy to Beijing as well as Taipei.
However, against the backdrop of the ongoing wide-range U.S. debates
over Washington\'s China policy in academic and policy circles over the
policy of engagement and hedging, one cannot help but link the decisions
on Taiwan with U.S. intentions to balance against a rising China. In
other words, [the Taiwan card will continue to be played by the Trump
administration.]{.underline} Meanwhile, [it is not unlikely
that]{.underline} President [Trump may want to \"make a deal\" with
Beijing over Taiwan in exchange of economic gains as well as the Korean
Peninsula issu]{.underline}e about which he is more concerned. As
Raymond Burghardt indicated, [the U.S. Taiwan policy might be negotiable
with Beijing and used as strategic leverage for economic
interests]{.underline}.67 [This worrisome speculation has increased
Taiwanese concern of being abandoned by Americans]{.underline}.

### AT Taiwan DA -- AT "Arms Sales Deter China"

#### A nuclear war over Taiwan is coming now -- only accommodation prevents conflict

[Although a number of]{.underline} regional sovereignty and maritime
[disputes have the¶ potential to sour the U.S.-China relationship and
draw the United States into¶ crises that could escalate into larger
wars]{.underline}, [**the key danger** appears to be¶ Taiwan's
status]{.underline}. China has long made clear that it considers
unification a paramount¶ political and national security goal.62 In
contrast, at least until recently,¶ the disputes in the South China and
East China Seas seemed to be of secondary¶ importance, with the
sovereignty disputes concerning islets and very small¶ islands that are
strategically unimportant and have uncertain and negotiable¶ economic
value. The escalating troubles in the South China and East China¶ Seas
arguably reduce the special importance of Taiwan and weaken the case¶
for accommodation, which I address in a later section.¶ [The most direct
benefit of ending the U.S. commitment to Taiwan would be¶ a reduction in
the probability of war between the United States and China over¶
Taiwan's statu]{.underline}s. Current U.S. policy is designed to prevent
Taiwan from declaring¶ independence and to make clear that the United
States will not come to¶ Taiwan's aid if it does. Nevertheless, [the
United States will find itself under¶ pressure to protect Taiwan no
matter what the source of a Chinese attack]{.underline}.¶ [Whether
Taiwan provoked an attack might be unclear, which would increase¶
pressure for U.S. involvement]{.underline}. Moreover, the [United States
has limited control¶ over Taiwan's policy]{.underline}, [which puts it
in the unfortunate position of being hostage¶ to decisions made in
Taipe]{.underline}i. None of the above dangers is new, but others are.
[China's improved military¶ capabilities may increase its willingness
both to start and to escalate a Taiwan¶ crisis.]{.underline} Fifteen
years ago, [China]{.underline} had little capability to invade or
blockade¶ Taiwan. Today it [can]{.underline} begin to [imagine
successfully invading Taiwan, and its¶ capability will only increase
with time]{.underline}.63 Much of the concern about China's so-called
antiaccess/area-denial (A2/AD) strategy focuses on its ability to
reduce¶ the U.S. ability to come to Taiwan's aid.64 In addition to its
improved conventional¶ capabilities, [China is modernizing its nuclear
forces to increase their¶ survivability and their ability to retaliate
following a large U.S. counternuclear¶ attack]{.underline}.65 Arguably,
the United States' current ability to destroy most or¶ all of China's
nuclear force enhances its bargaining position in a severe crisis¶ or
conventional war over Taiwan. Consequently, [China's nuclear
modernization¶ may make China more willing to start a crisis, less
willing to make¶ compromises once conflict occurs, and **more willing to
escalate**]{.underline}.

#### Deterrence won't check a Taiwan conflict -- escalates to nuclear war

[[A crisis over Taiwan]{.mark} [could]{.mark}]{.underline} fairly

In addition to its improved conventional capabilities[, China is

appeasement; instead, it would find its appetite whetted and make even
greater demands afterward\--spurred by Washington\'s lost credibility as
a defender of its allies. The critics are wrong, however, because
territorial concessions are not always bound to fail. Not all
adversaries are Hitler, and when they are not, [[accommodation can
be]{.mark} an [effective]{.mark} policy tool]{.underline}. When an
adversary has limited territorial goals, granting them can lead not to
further demands but rather to satisfaction with the new status quo and a
reduction of tension.

#### China will inevitably try to seize Taiwan -- causes nuclear war

Hugh **White**, 4/15/**15**, Strait Times, (Professor of strategic
studies at the Australian National University in Canberra), "The harsh
reality that taiwan faces,"
http://www.straitstimes.com/opinion/the-harsh-reality-that-taiwan-faces,
mm

[China\'s new leadership]{.underline} under President Xi Jinping [seems
increasingly impatient to resolve]{.underline} [what it sees as the last
vestige of China\'s]{.underline} centuries of [humiliation]{.underline}
and increasingly confident of its growing power to act with impunity.
Already [there are signs that its stance on Taiwan is
hardening.]{.underline}¶ [That]{.underline}, in turn, [poses a huge
potential problem]{.underline} to the rest of the region and especially
to Washington. [The US has]{.underline} always [declared its commitment
to support Taiwan if China tries to compel reunificatio]{.underline}n.
The credibility of this commitment has now grown even more important
because it is seen as a crucial test of America\'s ability to preserve
the old US-led order in Asia in the face of China\'s relentless push for
a bigger role.¶ But the stark reality is that these days, [there is not
much the US can]{.underline} realistically [do to help
Taipei]{.underline} stand up to serious pressure from Beijing.¶ [Back in
1996]{.underline} when they last went toe-to-toe over Taiwan, [the US
could]{.underline} simply send a couple of [aircraft carriers into the
area to force China to back off. Today the balance of power is vastly
different: China can sink the carriers, and their economies are so
intertwined that trade sanctions o]{.underline}f the kind the US used
against Russia recently [are]{.underline} simply
[unthinkable]{.underline}.¶ This reality does not yet seem to have been
understood in Taiwan. The overwhelming desire on the island is to
preserve its democracy and avoid reunification by preserving the status
quo. But it understands that [China\'s patience is not
inexhaustible]{.underline} - [eventually China wants to get Taiwan
back]{.underline}.¶ [Taiwan]{.underline} also understands that it cannot
stand up to the mainland by itself, but it [hopes]{.underline} that by
slowly [expanding its international status]{.underline} and profile
within the status quo - without seeking independence - it [can build
support]{.underline} among regional countries as well as from the US,
[which will help it resist Beijing\'s ambitions]{.underline} for
eventual reunification.¶ Alas, [this seems an illusion]{.underline}.
There is a real danger that [the Taiwanese overestimate the
international support they can rely on]{.underline} if Beijing decides
to get tough.¶ No one visiting Taipei can fail to be impressed by what
the Taiwanese have achieved in recent decades, not just economically but
also politically, socially and culturally. But the harsh reality is that
[no country is going to sacrifice its relations with China in order to
help Taiwan preserve the status quo]{.underline}. China is simply too
important economically, and too powerful militarily, for anyone to
confront it on Taiwan\'s behalf, especially when [everyone knows how
determined China is to achieve reunification eventually. ¶]{.underline}
Even more worryingly, [this reality does not yet seem to have sunk in in
Washington]{.underline}, [where leaders still talk boldly about their
willingness to stand by Taiwan]{.underline} without seriously
considering what that might mean in practice. [Any US effort to support
Taiwan militarily against China would be almost certain to escalate into
a full-scale US-China war and quite possibly a nuclear
exchange.]{.underline} That would be a disaster for everyone, including,
of course, the people of Taiwan itself - far worse than reunification,
in fact.

### AT Taiwan DA -- Arms Sales Bad -- Security Dilemma (2AC)

#### Taiwan creates a security dilemma that fuels conflict -- accommodation is key

Charles **Glaser**, Mar/April **2011**, (Glaser is a professor in the
Elliott School of International Affairs at George Washington University.
He is also a fellow in the Kissinger Institute at the Woodrow Wilson
International Center for Scholars). Foreign Affairs, "will china's rise
lead to war? EBSCOhost, mm

[Realist analyses of]{.underline} how [power transitions]{.underline}
will play out [are based on the assumption that states accurately
perceive and respond to the international situations they
face]{.underline}. [Realist optimism]{.underline} in this case thus
[rests on the assumption that U.S.]{.underline} leaders appreciate, and
[will]{.underline} be able to [act on]{.underline}, [the]{.underline}
unusually [high degree of security that the United States actually
enjoys]{.underline}. Should this assumption prove incorrect, and
[[should the United States exaggerate the threat]{.mark} China poses,
[the risks of future conflict will be greater]{.mark}]{.underline}.
Unfortunately, there are some reasons for worrying that the assumption
might in fact be wrong.¶ For example, [[the]{.underline}]{.mark} popular
[[belief that a rising China]{.mark} [will]{.mark} severely
[threaten]{.mark} U.S. [security]{.mark} [could become a self-fulfilling
prophecy]{.mark}.]{.underline} Should [Washington]{.underline} fail to
understand that Chinas growing military capabilities do not threaten
vital U.S. interests, it [may adopt overly competitive military and
foreign policies]{.underline}, which may in turn signal to China that
the United States has malign motives. Should [China]{.underline} then
feel less secure, it [will]{.underline} [be more likely to adopt
competitive policies]{.underline} that the United States will see as
more threatening. [[The result would be a negative spiral
driven]{.mark}]{.underline} not by the international situation the
states actually faced but [[by]{.underline}]{.mark} their [[exaggerated
insecurities]{.mark}.]{.underline}¶ Moreover, states have often
overestimated their insecurity by failing to appreciate the extent to
which military capabilities favored defense. Before World War I, Germany
exaggerated the ease of invasion and therefore believed that Russia\'s
growing power threatened its survival. As a result, Germany launched an
unnecessary preventive war. During the Cold War, the United States
exaggerated the nuclear threat posed by the Soviet Union, failing to
appreciate that large improvements in Soviet forces left the key aspect
of the American deterrent\--a massive retaliatory capability\--entirely
intact. This did not lead to war, thankfully, but it did increase the
risks of one and led to much unnecessary tension and expenditure.
Washington will have to guard against making similar errors down the
road as China\'s conventional and nuclear forces grow and as clashes
over secondary issues strain relations.¶ There has been no U.S.
overreaction to the growth in Chinas military capabilities yet, but the
potential for one certainly exists. The current U.S. National Security
Strategy, for example, calls for the United States to maintain its
conventional military superiority, but it does not spell out why this
superiority is required or what forces and capabilities this requires.
For the foreseeable future, China will lack power-projection
capabilities comparable to those of the United States, but its military
buildup is already reducing the United States\' ability to fight along
China\'s periphery. This will soon raise questions such as precisely why
the United States requires across-the-board conventional superiority,
what specific missions the U.S. military will be unable to perform
without it, and how much the inability to execute those missions would
damage U.S. security. Without clear answers, the United States may well
overestimate the implications of China\'s growing military forces.¶ The
danger of an exaggerated security threat is even greater in the nuclear
realm. The Obama administration\'s 2010 Nuclear Posture Review holds
that \"the United States and China\'s Asian neighbors remain concerned
about China\'s current military modernization efforts, including its
qualitative and quantitative modernization of its nuclear arsenal.\" The
NPR, however, does not identify just what danger China\'s military
modernization poses. There is no prospect that any conceivable nuclear
modernization in the foreseeable future will enable China to destroy the
bulk of U.S. nuclear forces and undermine the United States\' ability to
retaliate massively. The most such modernization might do is eliminate a
significant U.S. nuclear advantage by providing China with a larger and
more survivable force, thereby reducing the United States\' ability to
credibly threaten China with nuclear escalation during a severe crisis.¶
The NPR says that the United States \"must continue to maintain stable
strategic relationships with Russia and China,\" but China has always
lacked the type of force that would provide stability according to U.S.
standards. If the United States decides that its security requires
preserving its nuclear advantage vis-à-vis China, it will have to invest
in capabilities dedicated to destroying China\'s new nuclear forces.
Such an effort would be in line with the United States\' Cold War
nuclear strategy, which placed great importance on being able to destroy
Soviet nuclear forces. This kind of arms race would be even more
unnecessary now than it was then. The United States can retain
formidable deterrent capabilities even if China modernizes its arsenal,
and a competitive nuclear policy could well decrease U.S. security by
signaling to China that the United States is hostile, thereby increasing
Chinese insecurity and damaging U.S.-Chinese relations.¶ There is no
question that China\'s conventional and nuclear buildups will reduce
some U.S. capabilities that Washington would prefer to retain. But the
United States should not rush to impute malign motives to those buildups
and should instead be sensitive to the possibility that they simply
reflect China\'s legitimate desire for security. When Donald Rumsfeld
was U.S. secretary of defense, he said, apropos of China\'s increased
defense spending, that \"since no nation threatens China, one must
wonder: Why this growing investment? Why these continuing large and
expanding arms purchases?\" The answer should have been obvious. If
China were able to operate carrier battle groups near the U.S. coast and
attack the U.S. homeland with long-range bombers, Washington would
naturally want the ability to blunt such capabilities, and if the United
States had a strategic nuclear force as vulnerable and comparatively
small as China\'s (now somewhere between a tenth and a hundredth the
size of the U.S. force), it would try to catch up as quickly as it had
the resources to do so. Those actions would not have been driven by any
nefarious plan to subjugate the world, and so far there are strong
reasons to believe that the same holds true for China\'s course.¶ In
sum, [[China\'s rise can be peaceful, but this outcome is far from
guaranteed]{.underline}]{.mark}. Contrary to the standard realist
argument, [the basic pressures generated by the international system
will not force the United States and China into conflict]{.underline}.
Nuclear weapons, separation by the Pacific Ocean, and political
relations that are currently relatively good should enable both
countries to maintain high levels of security and avoid military
policies that severely strain their relationship. The United States\'
need to protect its allies in Northeast Asia complicates matters
somewhat, but there are strong grounds for believing that Washington can
credibly extend its deterrent to Japan and South Korea, its most
important regional partners. [[The challenge]{.underline} [for the
U]{.underline}]{.mark}[nited [S]{.mark}tates [will come in making
adjustments t]{.mark}o its]{.underline} [policies in situations in which
less-than-vital interests (such as [Taiwan]{.mark})]{.underline} [might
cause problems and in making sure it does not exaggerate the risks posed
by China\'s growing power and military capabilities]{.underline}.

#### A power transition in Asia is inevitable -- China's rise can be peaceful, but failing to resolve the security dilemma will cause an arms race and war

[The [Asia]{.mark} Pacific [is]{.mark}]{.underline} a region
[[in]{.mark} geopolitical [transition]{.mark}]{.underline}. For decades,
regional stability has been maintained primarily through a U.S.-led
alliance system. Since the turn of the millennium, however, [[the
shifting]{.underline}]{.mark} political and economic
[[terrain]{.underline}]{.mark} [has]{.underline}
[[led]{.underline}]{.mark} many [[observers]{.underline}]{.mark}
[[to]{.mark} [expect]{.mark} an upsurge in military
[competition]{.mark}, [arms races, and the]{.mark} [possibility of a
**catastrophic military conflict**]{.mark}.¶]{.underline} The rapid
transformation of the region is not exclusively a story about China.
Indeed, the economies and militaries of the countries in Southeast Asia,
as well as China's large neighbors India and Russia, have also
experienced rapid growth. Meanwhile, U.S. allies South Korea and
Australia are significantly strengthening their militaries and becoming
increasingly active players in regional security. For its part, Japan
remains the world's third-largest economy, has considerable wealth and
military capabilities, and has begun to gradually increase its defense
spending. More generally, Japan's traditionally low-key security profile
appears to be undergoing changes of potentially immense long-term
significance.¶ Yet [the rapid rise of China]{.underline}, the resulting
shift in the distribution of regional material capabilities, [and
uncertainty about China's]{.underline} future [trajectory]{.underline}
[are]{.underline} arguably th[e main forces driving concerns about
possible arms races]{.underline}, now or in the \[End Page 55\] future.
In 2010 China became the world's second-largest economy. Its official
defense spending has nearly quintupled in nominal renminbi terms since
2002 and now ranks second only to that of the (globally distributed)
U.S. military. China's defense spending remains largely constant as a
percentage of its (rapidly growing) gross domestic product, though that
long-term trend has reversed itself for the last several years,
including a twice-as-fast projected increase in 2014.5 Widespread
concerns about the objective reality of China's rapidly increasing
military capabilities are exacerbated by its low military transparency,
which deepens general uncertainty and specific worries about its
capabilities and intentions.¶ [China's worsening relations with its
neighbors]{.underline} [may]{.underline} [exemplify the
challenge]{.underline} that any state [with]{.underline} such rapidly
increasing material capabilities has in [signaling
restraint]{.underline}. As [[China's]{.underline}
[leaders]{.underline}]{.mark} state, Beijing may be modernizing its
military forces primarily to compensate for decades of neglect, and its
leaders [[may]{.mark} sincerely [view its policies]{.mark} toward its
neighbors [as]{.mark} reactive and [defensive]{.mark}.]{.underline}
[[Yet]{.underline}]{.mark} the more important point is that regardless
of China's actual intentions, to other [states]{.underline} the
objective reality of [[Beijing's]{.underline}]{.mark} growing military
power, coupled with its rapidly expanding military
[[capabilities]{.underline}]{.mark} and recent policies vis-à-vis
disputed territory and features on its periphery, [[appear
provocative]{.mark} and]{.underline} newly "[assertive]{.underline},"
even aggressive.6 As a case in point, however controversial and
destabilizing, China's vast claims over islands and features in the
South and East China Seas predate its current "rise" by decades. Yet as
China's military capabilities grow, Beijing is increasingly capable of
asserting these claims in a manner that it was unable to only a few
years ago. Similarly, the growing frequency and geographical scope of
its patrols and exercises worsen tensions by creating far more
opportunities for a clash or incident, as Chinese \[End Page 56\]
vessels and aircraft increasingly cross paths with foreign militaries in
international waters.¶ [A decade ago, China's leaders appeared far more
sensitive to the dilemma their country faces as a rising
power]{.underline}; [the slogan "peaceful rise" and China's engagement
and reassurance of neighboring states of its peaceful intentions
encapsulated this self-awareness]{.underline}.7 At least seen from
Beijing, [[China's intentions may continue to be "peaceful]{.mark}" and
its military policy "defensive"]{.underline}---both now and in the
future---as its leaders often assert. Yet its future intentions are
unknowable---even to the most prescient of Chinese leaders. Under
anarchy and in the context of Beijing's rapid enhancement of military
capabilities, this uncertainty can create or exacerbate regional
instability. [To the extent that China's intentions are truly peaceful
and defensive, [if Beijing is unable to credibly convey them, its rise
is likely to]{.mark} increasingly [elicit]{.mark} backlash and
[counterbalancing]{.mark} from its neighbors]{.underline}.
[The]{.underline} perhaps unintended [result will be to]{.underline}
[worsen]{.underline}, rather than enhance, [China's
security]{.underline}---even to the point of self-encirclement. The net
result is high costs all around---in terms of wasteful military spending
and an increasingly unstable region even if a military conflict does not
occur---that leave all parties worse off.¶ [As in any strategic
interaction, it takes two to tango]{.underline}. Indeed, [[the United
States and its]{.mark}]{.underline} Asia Pacific security
[[allies]{.underline}]{.mark} and partners [[are engaging in extensive
efforts to hedge]{.underline}]{.mark} against both uncertainty and
Beijing's specific policies by balancing against China.8 Despite severe
domestic pressure to reduce defense spending, Washington has enhanced
what Secretary of State Hillary Clinton called "forward-deployed"
diplomacy, strengthening security ties with and among its allies and
partners and generally buttressing its military presence throughout the
Asia Pacific.9 Seen from Washington, the associated policies are, inter
alia, a defensive reaction to China's growing power and its policies.
They are intended to bolster the credibility of the long-standing role
of the United States in the region as "resident power," security
provider, and leader. Yet, regardless of [Washington's]{.underline}
actual [intentions]{.underline}, the associated policies and \[End Page
57\] rhetoric [may appear threatening to Beijing and,]{.underline}
consequently, [could trigger unwanted defensive
counterresponses]{.underline}.10¶ In short, at least on the surface,
[[deepening]{.underline}]{.mark} political
[[tensions]{.underline}]{.mark} and military competition unfolding in
the contemporary Asia Pacific [[appear to be driven]{.underline}]{.mark}
largely [[by]{.underline}]{.mark} action-reaction dynamics emblematic of
[[a]{.underline}]{.mark} structurally driven [[security
dilemma]{.underline}]{.mark}. Military competition, however, can have
different causes and take different forms. To what extent is the Asia
Pacific experiencing a security dilemma?

### AT Taiwan DA - Ext -- Security Dilemma -\> Asian Arms Race

#### The US/China security dilemma will set off an arms race in Asia

Adam **Liff** **and** John **Ikenberry**, Fall **2014**, (Liff is an
assistant professor at the school of global and international studies at
indiana university; Ikenberry is a professor of politics and
international affairs at princeton), Foreign Affairs, 39(2), Project
Muse, mm

The preceding empirical survey yields several preliminary conclusions.
First, [security dilemma dynamics appear to be important drivers of
states enhancing military capabilities in the increasingly volatile Asia
Pacific region]{.underline}. [This dynamic is unfolding between
China]{.underline} on the one hand [and the United States]{.underline}
and several of China's neighbors on the other. The cases can be divided
roughly into three categories based on the drivers of their military
capabilities enhancement measures vis-à-vis China. The first group of
states---in declining order of severity of observable policy
responses---includes the United States, Australia, Japan, and Singapore.
These states may also have long-standing interest-based disputes with
China---for example, Washington's frictions with Beijing over the
international status of Taiwan---but recent security policy shifts and
investments in enhancing military power also appear to be directly
attributable to China's growing military capabilities and uncertainty
about its strategic intentions. The second group of states have
significantly enhanced their military capabilities for reasons directly
connected to both China's military buildup in the abstract, and its more
provocative behavior vis-à-vis specific disputes over
material/territorial interests seen by their leaders as de facto
revisionist. The former is seen as posing a more abstract threat,
whereas the latter is perceived to be specific and imminent. Among the
cases examined above, Japan (East China Sea) also appears to fall into
this second category most clearly. The third group consists of states
whose efforts to enhance their military capabilities seem driven
primarily by perceived revisionist behavior vis-à-vis specific disputes
over material/territorial interests. Vietnam (South China Sea) falls
most clearly into this category.¶ Second, not all action-reaction
military competition in the region is exclusively the result of security
dilemmas. Direct conflicts over specific territorial/material interests
are also important drivers of mutual arming. Despite frequent overlap,
the conceptual distinction of causal mechanisms has theoretical and
practical significance. For example, the mutual military buildups of
\[End Page 86\] Vietnam and China seem to be driven primarily by a
direct clash of interests--- over territorial disputes in the South
China Sea---whereas the potential threat posed by China's military
buildup to Australia is far more abstract. Accordingly, Canberra's
efforts to enhance its military capabilities are more suggestive of a
traditional security dilemma dynamic. Although in both cases the
observable outcomes---mutual military buildups and tensions---are
similar, the core causal mechanism differs.¶ Third, [even in cases where
available evidence suggests that states' actual intentions may be status
quo, the other side may not recognize that fact, which in turn
exacerbates the security dilemma]{.underline}. Leaders from the three
clearest candidates for security dilemmas with China---the United
States, Australia, and Japan---have repeatedly voiced concern about
China's lack of transparency regarding its military spending,
capabilities, and intentions. China's leaders have repeatedly expressed
a desire to enhance "strategic trust" and to "reduce misunderstanding
and suspicion."125 Yet if China is a status quo power---setting aside
the important and complicated issue of its long-standing (and
destabilizing) territorial sovereignty claims---its relative lack of
military transparency appears to unnecessarily exacerbate extant
insecurities caused by its rapidly growing material capabilities and
military power. [Other states' defensive reactions]{.underline} to this
uncertainty in turn [feed back and, by appearing threatening to Beijing,
further intensify the security dilemma]{.underline}. Ultimately, [both
sides end up even more insecure and worse off.¶]{.underline} Fourth, a
[significant amount of the action-reaction dynamic evident in the Asia
Pacific]{.underline}---particularly in those states already possessing
advanced militaries---[manifests]{.underline} not [as]{.underline}
surging defense spending or quantitative personnel or arms buildups but
as less easily measurable---but no less important--- [efforts to enhance
military capabilit]{.underline}ies. [The region has yet to witness
traditional, full-scale arms races.]{.underline} Increases to defense
spending appear roughly consistent with economic growth and seem
sustainable, [for now]{.underline}. At least outside China, leaders
appear to have judged that targeted measures, rather than reflexive,
reciprocal buildups reminiscent of the dreadnought race of a century
ago, are more effective at enhancing military power in the twenty-first
century. This trend is evident in the relatively efficient steps that
the United States and China's neighbors have taken to shift their
postures toward likely trouble spots, strengthen alliance coordination
and military interoperability, preposition military assets, expand joint
exercises and force rotations, and so forth. \[End Page 87\] [States
across the region are adopting these measures in a manner consistent
with the security dilemma logic.]{.underline}¶ Finally, [perceived
intentions are significant in determining the incidence and intensity of
security dilemmas]{.underline}. Even under anarchy, [states' military
policy responses to others are shaped not just by the other side's
objectively identifiable capabilities, but also by international
politics]{.underline}: the [degree of mutual strategic (mis)trust, which
in turn powerfully shapes how attempts at reassurance]{.underline}
(i.e., signaling status quo intentions) [are perceived]{.underline}.

### AT Taiwan DA -- Arms Sales Bad -- US/China Relations (2AC)

#### Accommodation on Taiwan is key to US/Sino cooperation -- that solves warming, econ decline, and prolif

Bruce **Gilley**, January/February **2010**, Foreign Affairs, "not so
dire straits," 89(1), EbscoHost, mm

Taiwan has played a strategic role in U.S. foreign policy since the
1940s\--first it served as a buffer against communist expansion out of
North Korea, and more recently it has been a bulwark against a rising
China. It is strategically located along East Asian shipping lanes and
could provide another naval resupply site if China continues to limit
U.S. naval visits to Hong Kong. [Keeping [Taiwan]{.mark} within the U.S.
orbit]{.underline} has served Washington\'s interests by demonstrating
that the United States will continue to engage in Asia, despite talk of
a declining U.S. role in the region. The tragic result of this policy,
however, [[has]{.underline}]{.mark} been that it has [[played into
Beijing\'s fears of encirclement]{.underline}]{.mark} and naval
inferiority, [which]{.underline} in turn has [prompted
China\'s]{.underline} own [military buildup]{.underline}.¶
[[Finlandization wil]{.mark}l allow [Taiwan to break this cycle]{.mark}
[by]{.mark} taking itself out of the game and [moderating the security
dilemma]{.mark}]{.underline} [that haunts the Washington-Belling
relationship]{.underline}. The cross-strait freeze of 1995-2005 raised
fears in Washington that Taiwan was becoming a strategic liability for
the United States. Ma\'s policies have momentarily resolved that
concern. And if the United States uses the current opportunity to adjust
its own policies and support the détente, that concern could be rendered
moot. [This would make future provocations]{.underline} by either side
[less likely.¶]{.underline} Taipei\'s decision to chart a new course is
a godsend for [[a U.S]{.mark}.]{.underline} administration that
increasingly [[needs China\'s cooperation in]{.underline}
a]{.mark}chieving its highest priority: [[maintaining the peaceful
international liberal order]{.underline}. [The United States requires
Beijing\'s support on a host of pressing world issues\--from **climate
change to financial stability and nuclear
nonproliferation.**]{.underline}]{.mark} William Stanton, Washington\'s
de facto ambassador to Taiwan, admitted as much in October 2009,
declaring that \"it\'s in everybody\'s interests, including Taiwan\'s as
well, that the U.S. try to have a cooperative relationship with
China.\"¶ In recent years, the U.S.-Taiwanese relationship has been
increasingly dictated by the interests of narrow lobbies rather than
grand strategy. The U.S. arms industry, the Taiwanese military, and
Taiwanese independence activists together make a formidable force.
Before the current détente, Taiwan\'s staunch anticommunism and
adversarial policy toward China aligned well with Washington\'s own
ideology and militarized approach to the Taiwan Strait. But the recent
evolution of tactical and strategic thinking in Taipei and Beijing has
created a disjuncture. The adversarial status quo that the United States
has protected is no longer the status quo that the Taiwanese want
protected.¶ Obviously, if Ma were to compromise Taiwan\'s democratic
institutions in pursuit of détente with China, Washington would have
reason to complain. But if a democratic Taiwan continues to move into
Chinas orbit, Washington should follow the lead of the Taiwanese people
in redefining their future. In the past, U.S. \"noninterference\" meant
maintaining the balance of power across the strait and challenging
Beijing\'s provocations. Today, it means reducing the militarization of
the conflict and not interfering with Taiwan\'s Finlandization.¶ Even
from a strictly realist perspective, [there is no need for the United
States to keep Taiwan within its strategic orbit, given that U.S.
military security can be attained through other Asian bases and
operations.]{.underline} [[Taiwan\'s Finlandization should be
seen]{.underline}]{.mark} not as a necessary sacrifice to a rising China
but rather [as [an alternative strategy for pacifying
China]{.mark}]{.underline}[. [Washington should drop its zero-sum
view]{.underline}]{.mark} of the Taipei-Beijing relationship [[and
embrace]{.underline}]{.mark} the strategic logic underlying the
[[rapprochement]{.underline}]{.mark}\--in effect \"losing China\" a
second time by allowing Taiwan to drift into the PRC\'s sphere of
influence.

#### Lack of US/Chinese cooperation makes global instability inevitable -- causes war

**The Atlantic Council 2013** (The Atlantic Council, September 2013,

<http://www.atlanticcouncil.org/images/publications/China-US_Cooperation_Key_to_the_Global_Future_WEB.pdf>)

[The global future is likely to be increasingly volatile and
uncertain]{.underline}. The rate of change is increasing, driven by the
accelerating pace of technological development, unprecedented
urbanization and growth of the global middle class, and a wide range of
challenges beyond the control of any one country but potentially
affecting the prosperity and security of all countries**[. Disruptive
change in one geographic or functional area will spread
quickly]{.underline}**.. [No country, and certainly not those with the
largest populations and largest economies, will be immune. Global
challenges like climate change, food and water shortages, and resource
scarcities will shape the strategic context for all nations and require
reconsideration of traditional national concerns]{.underline} such as
sovereignty and maximizing the ability of national leaders to control
their country's destiny. What China and the United States do,
individually and together, will have a major impact on the future of the
global system. As importantly, our individual fates will be inextricably
linked to how that future plays out. The three illustrative scenarios
sketched out below underscore how critical [the future of the US-China
relationship is to each country and to the world]{.underline}. • [Global
Drift and Erosion]{.underline} (**[the present world
trajectory]{.underline}**)[: In a world in which nations fail to resolve
global problems and strengthen mechanisms of global cooperation,
**governments gradually turn inward**]{.underline}. Each nation seeks to
protect and advance its own narrow national interests or to preserve an
unsustainable status quo that is rapidly changing in ways that erode the
international order. The international community's lack of ability to
cooperate to meet global challenges leads to international crises and
instability. • Zero-Sum World: Unsustainable drift leads to a world of
predominantly zero-sum competition and conflict in the face of severe
resource constraints. **[The result is economic crises and internal
instability as well as interstate confrontation]{.underline}**. There is
risk of military conflict between major powers, which increases global
mistrust and uncertainty and fosters an "each nation for itself"
mentality that further undermines the ability of states to cooperate in
the face of growing common challenges. • Global Revitalization and
Cooperation: To escape the perils of drift or zero-sum competition,
leaders in countries with the most to lose work together to manage and
take advantage of global challenges and megatrends. Cooperation makes it
possible to achieve win-win outcomes that avoid or mitigate negative
consequences of increased demand for resources and the impact of climate
change as well as to harness new technologies to improve living
conditions through sustainable development. Cooperation creates and
utilizes new transnational institutions to prevent conflict and enhance
security for all. [China and the United States become more prosperous as
we work together]{.underline}. 6 ATLANTIC COUNCIL China-US Cooperation:
Key to the Global Future The possible futures sketched out above (and
developed at greater length below) are intended to stimulate thinking
about how current trends and uncertainties could lead to very different
global and national outcomes. For many reasons, [the United States and
China will have greater ability]{.underline} and incentives [than other
countries to cooperate in]{.underline} determining and [shaping
developments over the next two decades]{.underline}. Indeed, it is very
difficult to imagine a pathway to "global revitalization and
cooperation" in which China and the United States do not cooperate and
provide critical international leadership. Many factors will shape the
future, some of which are beyond the control of any nation state, but
China and the United States---and the character of the US-China
relationship---will be critical. The mutual dependence on each other's
economic performance and the success of the global economy as a whole
was demonstrated during the 2008 financial crisis that began in the
United States but quickly spread around the world. US and Chinese
leaders recognized that they were in the "same boat" strategically and
engaged in a closely coordinated response to the crisis, which played a
key---if not decisive---role in preventing the situation from becoming
much worse. [The need for joint and coordinated responses to economic
crises and to mounting economic challenges and threats is certain to
increase as globalization continues and interdependence
deepens]{.underline}.

### AT Taiwan DA -- AT Democracy/ILO Impact

#### Plan results in peaceful Taiwanese integration -- that triggers massive political reforms in China -- leads to gradual democratization 

Bruce **Gilley**, January/February **2010**, Foreign Affairs, "not so
dire straits," 89(1), EbscoHost, mm

IN 1995, at the end of the first détente, Chen-shen
[[Yen]{.underline}]{.mark}, a Taiwanese scholar and KMT adviser,
[[wrote]{.underline}]{.mark} a paper in the Taiwanese political journal
Wenti yu Yanjiu explicitly [[extolling the logic of
Finlandization]{.underline}]{.mark} (or fenlanhua in Chinese[) [for
Taiwan]{.underline}]{.mark}. By seeking Beijing\'s approval for an
expanded international voice, maintaining a foreign policy that did not
threaten China, and choosing leaders who enjoyed Beijing\'s trust, Yen
argued, Taiwan could do more to protect its internal autonomy and
economic prosperity than it could by challenging the rising superpower
on its doorstep. Moreover, [[Taiwan\'s]{.mark} long-term interests in
gaining true [independence]{.mark} [could]{.mark} only [be achieved by
democratization in China]{.mark}, [which would be more likely if Taiwan
avoided]{.mark} stoking a military or ideological
[confrontation]{.mark}]{.underline}. His conclusion echoed that of the
Athenians in Thucydides\' Melian dialogue: \"Given the responsibility to
protect its future existence,\" wrote Yen, \"a civilized country should
adjust itself to external realities.\" It has taken over a decade for
Yen\'s prescient views to gain currency, but they now have widespread
support.¶ Ma\'s pursuit of \"total normalization\" has enjoyed steady
and rising popularity in Taiwan since he came to office. It reflects a
view that the militarized approach to the cross-strait conflict that has
dominated both Taiwanese (and U.S.) strategic thinking since the days of
Chiang and Mao has not resolved the dispute and does not serve Taiwan\'s
present needs. [Just as Finland]{.underline}, a small country, [was able
to pioneer a nonmilitarized alternative to the Cold War, so, too, could
Taiwan play that role in the brewing U.S.-Chinese cold war in
Asia]{.underline}.¶ At present[, a rising [China threatens the
world]{.mark}]{.underline} primarily [[because there has been
little]{.underline}]{.mark} in the way of [domestic [political
liberalization]{.mark} to keep Beijing\'s]{.underline} increasing
economic and military [power in check]{.underline}. [[Taiwan could play
a far greater role in China\'s liberalization]{.underline}]{.mark} [if
it were to become a Finlandized part of the region]{.underline} and its
officials were able to move across the strait even more freely than they
do now. Already, [prominent Chinese liberals]{.underline}, such as Zhang
Boshu of the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences, are [arguing that the
mainland should draw lessons about political development from
Taiwan]{.underline}. As Sheng Lijun of the National University of
Singapore writes, \"[[With]{.underline}]{.mark} the
[[Taiwan]{.underline}]{.mark} political challenge,
[[Beijing]{.underline} [will]{.underline}]{.mark} sooner or later [[have
to improve its governance]{.mark} (including democracy, human rights,
and anti-corruption]{.underline}).\" [[Taipei\'s experience with
democratic reform offers many lessons for
Beijing]{.underline}]{.mark}\--especially because the formerly
authoritarian KMT\'s return to power in 2008 showed that the CCP could
one day hope to rule again even if the advent of democracy initially
brought another party to power.¶ [[Democratic reform in China will be
encouraged both by popular pressure to emulate
Taiwan]{.underline}]{.mark} (PRC citizens have already enthusiastically
adopted Taiwanese pop culture and business practices) [[and by the brute
necessity of managing the relationship in a way that meets the Taiwanese
electorate\'s high expectations of transparency and
accountability]{.underline}]{.mark}. Some may call it appeasement, but
if Taiwan uses appeasement to democratize and pacify a rising China, it
will be a worthy appeasement indeed.

#### Gradual transition key to prevent instability and total party collapse

As the Chinese Communist party inaugurates its new leadership, a
question on the minds of many Chinese and western observers is whether
the party will allow democratic reforms in China. The answer they get
from the party this time, as on previous similar occasions, is
unambiguous: the CCP has no intention to give up power. In his opening
speech to the 18th party congress last week, Hu Jintao, the outgoing
general secretary, dispelled any doubts about the party's resolve to
keep its political monopoly. [He pledged that the leadership would
"never take the evil road of changing flags and banners"]{.underline} --
[code for abandoning one-party rule While such a declaration must be
taken seriously, it is important also to remember that [the CCP]{.mark}
does not have the only say about China's future. In fact, its bravado
notwithstanding, the party [is facing unprecedented pressures]{.mark}
from all directions [to relinquish its power through democratic
reforms]{.mark}]{.underline}. The most important sign that one-party
rule is becoming more shaky is the return of the democracy debate. The
intellectual recognition that the status quo is unsustainable is always
the first and vital step towards changing it. In the Chinese case, this
intellectual awakening is driven by powerful trends in the Chinese
economy and society. Take, for example, China's economic performance,
which underpins the party's rule. With its recent slowdown, many people
are struggling to identify the causes. One argument that has gained the
most influence is that a pernicious form of statist crony-capitalism has
metastasised and is killing China's economy. Statist crony-capitalism
lies behind China's assorted economic ills: macroeconomic imbalances,
discrimination against the private sector, over-regulation, financial
repression and lack of innovation. Statist crony-capitalism first
emerged in the 1990s, when the CCP shifted from market-led reforms to a
state-led investment drive as the engine of growth. For a while, a set
of one-off favourable factors, such as the demographic dividend (leading
to a high ratio of workers to non-workers), globalisation and a credit
boom, delivered impressively high growth and concealed the costs of this
predatory system. [The economic slowdown now exposes the dark side of
statist crony-capitalism. [A consensus is fast emerging in
China]{.mark}: [economic reform]{.mark} today [requires]{.mark}
political reform, explicitly [democratic reform]{.mark} first. [Without
empowering the people]{.mark}, t[he entrenched groups]{.mark} -- local
governments, state-owned enterprises, central bureaucracies and families
of the ruling elites -- [will not cede their privileges
willingly]{.mark}.]{.underline} If the desire to revive economic growth
to stay in power is not sufficient to motivate China's new leadership to
gamble with political reform, then the country's escalating social
tensions will force their hands. [Fuelled by resentment against
inequality, corruption and environmental degradation, the Chinese
citizenry, now far more urbanised and connected by modern information
technologies than before, has begun to challenge the party on a wide
range of public policy issues]{.underline}. The most recent large-scale
environmental protests that forced the cancellation of mega-industrial
projects are only a harbinger of things to come. The 500-plus mass
protest incidents occurring daily are another indicator of the
restiveness of Chinese society. [Jamil Anderlini's gripping account of
the rise and fall of Bo Xilai and his family dynastyBased on
international experience, the party is likely entering a period of
crisis before its ultimate exit from power. Since Portugal began its
transition to democracy in 1974, roughly 80 countries have made similar
transitions from autocracy to varying forms of democracy.]{.underline}
To be sure, not all of the transitions have produced high-quality
democracies. But the striking fact today is that only a quarter of the
countries (48 out of 195) in the world are governed by autocracies. Many
factors were responsible for this political revolution. For China, the
most relevant are two: failure of one-party rule and the political
consequences of economic development. [[A one-party regime]{.mark} may
be the most sophisticated form of autocracy. But even such regimes
[cannot avert demise]{.mark}. Because of the rule of "adverse selection"
(autocracies attract opportunists and produce progressively weaker
leaders due to over-bureaucratisation and risk-aversion), one-party
regimes degenerate through organisational decay. While democracies can
renew themselves through political "creative destruction", one-party
regimes cannot. That is why the world's oldest democracies are more than
200 years old while the longest-ruling one-party regime -- the Soviet
Union -- lasted only 74 years. Now at 63 years in power, [the CCP will
soon be testing that limit]{.mark}.]{.underline} The political laws of
modernisation are also stacked against the party. It becomes almost
impossible to maintain autocratic rule in non-oil based economies as per
capita gross domestic product rises above a given level (about
\$4,000-\$6,000 in purchasing power parity). With its per capita GDP
close to \$8,400 in PPP, China is already an outlier. Of all the
autocracies or semi-autocracies with a higher per capita GDP than China,
almost all are oil-based economies. The CCP may have defied the odds so
far, but cannot do so indefinitely. [One thing we have learnt from
transitions to democracy since 1974 is that [regimes that initiate
change before they totally lose credibility fare far better than those
that resist democratisation until the bitter end]{.mark}. This
self-evident lesson ought to be abundantly clear to China's incoming
leaders.]{.underline}

### AT Terrorism DA -- Not Key

#### No link -- arms sales do not reduce the risk of terrorism 

A. Trevor **Thrall and** Caroline **Dorminey**, 3/13/18, \[Thrall is an
associate professor at the Schar School of Policy and Government at
George Mason; Dorminey is a policy analyst at the Cato Institute-, Cato
Institute, "risky business: the role of arms sales in US foreign
policy,"
https://www.cato.org/publications/policy-analysis/risky-business-role-arms-sales-us-foreign-policy,
mm

[Nor does the threat of]{.underline} transnational
[terrorism]{.underline} [justify most arms sales]{.underline}. Most
fundamentally, [the actual threat from]{.underline} Islamist-inspired
[terrorism]{.underline} to Americans [is extraordinarily]{.underline}
low. Since 9/11, neither al Qaeda nor the Islamic State has managed an
attack on the American homeland. Lone wolf terrorists inspired by those
groups have done so, but since 9/11 those attacks have killed fewer than
100 Americans, an average of about 6 people per year. There is simply
very little risk reduction to be gained from any strategy. The idea that
the United States should be willing to accept the significant negative
effects of arms sales for minimal counterterrorism gains is seriously
misguided.49 Moreover, even if one believed that the benefits would
outweigh the potential costs, [arms sales still have almost no value as
a tool in the war on terror for several reasons. First, the bulk of arms
sales]{.underline} (and those we considered in our risk assessment)
[involve major conventional weapons, which are ill suited to combatting
terrorism.]{.underline} [Many U.S. arms deals since 9/11 have involved
major conventional weapons systems such as fighter jets, missiles, and
artillery, useful for traditional military operations, but of little use
in fighting terrorists]{.underline}. Insurgencies that hold territory,
like the Islamic State, are one thing, but most terrorist groups do not
advertise their location, nor do they assemble in large groups. Second,
[there is little evidence]{.underline} from the past 16 years [that
direct military intervention is the right way to combat terrorism.
Research reveals that military force alone "seldom ends
terrorism]{.underline}."50 This comports with the American experience in
Afghanistan, Iraq, and elsewhere in the war on terror to date. Despite
regime change, thousands of air strikes, and efforts to upgrade the
military capabilities of friendly governments, the United States has not
only failed to destroy the threat of Islamist-inspired terrorism, it has
also spawned chaos, greater resentment, and a sharp increase in the
level of terrorism afflicting the nations involved.51 Given the
experience of the United States since 2001, [there is little reason to
expect that additional arms sales]{.underline} to countries like Saudi
Arabia, Pakistan, Qatar, or the United Arab Emirates [will reduce
terrorism]{.underline}, much less anti-American terrorism specifically.
Relatedly, [many arms deals]{.underline} since 9/11, [made in the name
of counterterrorism, were irrelevant to U.S. goals in the global war on
terror]{.underline} [because they provided weapons to governments
fighting terrorist groups only vaguely (if at all) linked to al Qaeda or
ISIS]{.underline}. Although selling weapons to the governments of
Nigeria or Morocco or Tunisia might help them combat violent resistance
in their countries, terrorist groups in those countries have never
targeted the United States. As a result, such arms deals cannot be
justified by arguing that they advance the goals of the United States in
its own war on terror in any serious way. Finally, [arms sales are
completely useless to combat the largest terrorist threat to the U.S.
homeland]{.underline} --- [lone wolf attackers already living in the
United States.]{.underline} As noted, none of the successful attacks in
the United States since 9/11 resulted from operations directed by al
Qaeda or ISIS. And in fact only two foiled attempts since then --- the
underwear bomber and the printer-bomb plot --- can be ascribed to al
Qaeda.52 Instead, in almost all cases, persons already living in the
United States, inspired by Islamist groups, decided to carry out attacks
on their own. Clearly, arms sales to foreign nations won't help with
that problem; rather, as many analysts have suggested, amplifying
conflicts abroad may well make the problem worse.53

### AT Terrorism DA -- Link Turn: Wrong Hands

#### Loose export laws ensure terrorists acquire American-made arms 

Daniel **DePetris**, 11/19/**18**, National Interest, "time to rethink
America's vast arms deals,"
https://nationalinterest.org/feature/time-rethink-americas-vast-arms-deals-36522,
mm

Selling weapons is big business for the United States. The State
Department cleared \$75.9 billion in arms deals in fiscal year 2017, a
one-year record since the Defense Security Cooperation Agency started
keeping tallies. President Donald Trump is a firm believer in selling
American weapons, aircraft, missiles, anti-air systems, and military
technology to overseas buyers, both to grow America's domestic defense
manufacturing workforce and to increase U.S. foreign policy leverage
over the countries choosing to buy American. The Cato Institute assessed
that [Washington has delivered a \$197 billion worth of conventional
weapons]{.underline} platforms, equipment, and related training services
[to 167 countries between 2002--2016]{.underline}. What Trump sees as
good business, however, many Europeans see as a contributor to
insecurity in conflict zones. This week, the European Parliament passed
a non-binding resolution all but condemning the United States for
systemically violating end-user agreements and making the world a more
dangerous place. While Brussels also denounced European countries like
Bulgaria and Romania for skirting European Union arms export procedures,
the bloc appeared to put most of the responsibility on Washington. In a
particularly pointed provision, the parliament called for an EU-side
embargo on defense transfers to the United States. It's a stunning
rebuke from Washington's European allies, but a nevertheless
understandable one given the [vast quantities of American military
equipment]{.underline} that [have been seized by terrorist organizations
on the battlefields of Iraq and Syria. In fact, the Islamic State has
been a prime benefactor of a loose U.S. arms export policy]{.underline},
one that is more reflexive---and based on short-term
considerations---than strategic. Who can forget the iconic image of the
black-clad, long-bearded Islamic State fighter doing doughnuts in a
U.S.-manufactured humvee? Or pictures of ISIS militants posing in front
of U.S.-made personnel carrier looted from the Iraqi army? [ISIS has
gotten its hands on so much U.S. weaponry that Washington has been
forced to bomb its own equipment to mitigate the damage.]{.underline}
Former Iraqi Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi estimated the loss of 2,300
humvees from Iraqi government stocks during ISIS's 2014 blitz into
Mosul. When Iraqi forces conducted a hasty retreat from Ramadi in 2015,
ISIS overran army warehouses and bases, claiming what a Pentagon
spokesman at the time said was one hundred heavy vehicles and "maybe a
half-dozen tanks." [The terrorist organization even converted "Made in
the USA" humvees into nearly impenetrable suicide car
bombs]{.underline}, a formidable foe to an Iraqi army suffering from
demoralization, poor leadership and exhaustion. [In Syria, American arms
destined for moderate opposition factions were forcibly seized by the
very terrorist groups the weapons were meant to combat]{.underline}. A
2017 report from Conflict Armament Research found multiple instances of
U.S.-purchased weapons from the Balkans being stolen, sold, or siphoned
off to more radical groups. Anti-tank weapons made in Europe, sold to
America, and transferred to Syrian opposition forces were later
discovered in the custody of ISIS. According to the report, "Supplies of
materiel into the Syrian conflict from foreign parties---notably the
United States and Saudi Arabia---have indirectly allowed IS to obtain
substantial quantities of anti-armour ammunition. These weapons include
ATGWs and several varieties of rocket with tandem warheads, which are
designed to defeat modern reactive armour."

## AT CPs

### AT Drone PIC -- Can't Solve Market (Timeframe)

#### We control timeframe -- Trump's ATI takes too long for benefits to kick in, negotiations take years, and interoperability problems 

**Divis, 7/11** -- Expert on Unmanned Aerial Vehicles and reporter for
Inside Unmanned Systems (Dee Ann, "Enthusiasm Builds for U.S. Military

[Under the new U.S. policy drone sales can now to go through the direct
commercial sales (DCS) process instead of the more time-consuming
foreign military sales (FMS) process]{.underline}. Under DCS, the
company negotiates its own deals with a potential customer and the
government is not involved in the fulfillment of the contract, according
to a chart prepared by consulting firm LM Defense. Under FMS, the
government negotiates the sale and gets involved in the deal, assuming
the risk of both parties delivering on their ends of the bargain. A
second change is that drones with strike-enabling technology, like laser
target designators, will no be longer considered to be "armed" UAS. This
should make them easier to export, said Schwartz. **[The new policies
have yet to trigger sales]{.underline}**, but this did not surprise
either Schwartz or Zaloga. [Military UAS are expensive, negotiations can
take years and now some countries have systems from China in their
inventory]{.underline}. "[It's going to take the U.S. a little while to
get back in there and convince them that they would be better off buying
U.S. systems]{.underline}," Zaloga said.

### AT Drone PIC -- Strict Restrictions Key

#### Strict restrictions are key to mitigate drone prolif and conflict 

**[Boyle '14]{.underline}**- Senior Fellow at the Foreign Policy
Research Institute (Michael J. Boyle, FPRI, "The Race for Drones" (2014)
pg. 93-94)//YGS

First, [the]{.underline} Obama [Administration should rethink its plans
to reclassify drones into categories under the MCTR regime]{.underline}
that would enable their widespread sale.90 [Before agreeing to sell
drones to the 66 states approved by the Pentagon, the United State
should do a full strategic assessment to determine whether the risk of
selling drones,]{.underline} even to allies, [outweighs the potential
benefits to industry]{.underline}. [It should]{.underline} also
[restrict the sale of sophisticated high-end drones and those with long
ranges or capability of flying in high altitude]{.underline}. In
addition, [the United States should be careful to restrict or ban sales
of drones to states]{.underline} (like Pakistan, Saudi Arabia and
others) [that are locked in intense geopolitical or regional rivalries
and will use them to test the nerves of their opponents.]{.underline}
[Second, if sales proceed, the administration should]{.underline}
consider applying strict end-user agreements that will [regulate how the
drones may be used when purchased. This is important particularly when
the purchased drones can be put to multiple purposes.]{.underline} While
enforcement of these agreements will be imperfect, and some states may
simply ignore some end-use restrictions, there is nevertheless a strong
incentive for prospective buyers seeking to maintain their access to
U.S. technology to pay heed to them. Such a step will not ensure that
Chinese or Russian drones, for example, are not misused, but it may
impose a limit on the misuse of drones by states that would prefer to
purchase the more sophisticated American technology. [The federal
government should also improve its oversight mechanisms for the sale and
use of U.S. drones and ensure adherence to strict licensing and
information sharing requirements within the federal agencies responsible
for the foreign sales.91 Third, the administration should consider
whether it has an opportunity to take a leading role in establishing
norms for the use and sale of drones abroad. The U.S. position, as the
world's leading developer of drone technology, provides it with
substantial leverage that it can use to establish some new rules of the
game which might limit the adverse effects of drones on the webs of
deterrent relationships that hold geopolitical and regional rivalries in
place]{.underline}. One option might be to back the development of an
international regulatory mechanism, along the lines of the Convention on
Certain Conventional Weapons (CCW), which could establish rules for how
drones may be sold and used.92 [Alternatively, the United States could
support the creation of a UN investigative body on drones which would
help to collect information on how drones are used and shame those who
use them carelessly or cruelly. But the United States should seize the
opportunity to take a leading role in developing "rules of the road" for
drone use in order to stop conflict spirals from emerging from accidents
or drone misuse.]{.underline}

### AT Drone PIC -- Regulations Fail

#### Regulations on drone sales are too lenient - drones fall into the hands of dangerous governments.

Industry sources say other [manufacturers are considering expanding
their product lines]{.underline}. The overall loosening of [drone export
rules would also help producers such as Boeing, Northrop Grumman,
General Atomics and Lockheed Martin]{.underline}, two industry sources
said. Shares of U.S. defense contractors gained on Tuesday after the
Reuters report. Kratos was up 2.7 percent, Textron rose 0.44 percent,
Boeing increased 1.7 percent and Northrop and Lockheed were both up
nearly one percent in mid-afternoon trade. Company officials declined to
comment ahead of the policy unveiling. [The smaller drones that meet the
new export guidelines are expected to be much cheaper]{.underline} than
high-end models such as the Predator and Reaper, both made by General
Atomics, which cost up to \$17 million apiece according to reports.
While they are less destructive than the larger drones, [their firepower
can destroy vehicles, small structures and armed positions. U.S.
officials contend that a more export-friendly approach will not only
help meet Trump's 2016 campaign promise to bolster America's "defense
industrial base"]{.underline} but also get foreign partners to take on
more of their own defense costs. [An increase in drones sales "could put
these weapons in the hands of governments that act irresponsibly with
their neighbors and against their own populations," warned Jeff
Abramson, a senior fellow with the Arms Control
Association]{.underline}, a non-partisan Washington-based organization
focused on global weapons proliferation threats. Trump's predecessor,
President Barack Obama, introduced revised rules in 2015 aimed at
increasing military drone exports. But U.S. manufacturers complained
they were still too restrictive. with a payload of over 1,100 pounds
(500 kg). However, the Trump administration is seeking to renegotiate
the MTCR accord to eventually make it easier to export the larger armed
drones.

### AT Drone PIC -- AT "Norms"

#### U.S. drone technology has fallen behind -- countries like China have better drones for cheaper. 

**Smith '18** 

(Gina Smith, author and entrepreneur in the tech industry, January 14,
2018,
https://siliconangle.com/2018/01/14/trumps-new-policies-seal-us-drone-industrys-doom-make-us-less-safe/) 

President Donald Trump's [new drone technology plans and policies won't
be enough to restore U.S. leadership in the sector,]{.underline}
according to a former intelligence official who helped Ronald Reagan amp
up critical American missile defense technology during the Cold War.
[What's more, the policies won't help protect American lives and
interests from drone-based terrorist attacks]{.underline}, Michael
Sekora, former director of Project Socrates, told SiliconANGLE in an
interview. The classified Defense Intelligence Agency tech initiative is
often credited with transforming Reagan's stalled "Star Wars" Strategic
Defense Initiative vision into a multitiered technology that leapfrogged
Soviet missile defense technology in the late 1980s. Sekora's commentary
arrives in the wake of news this past week that yet another American
drone hardware effort is grounded: On Monday, GoPro Inc. became the
third major American drone company to quit the drone hardware business.
Lily Robotics Inc. and 3D Robotics Inc. shuttered their respective drone
hardware plans in 2017, citing hard competition from Chinese drone
behemoth, Dà-Jiāng Innovations. DJI controlled more than 70 percent of
all commercial drone sales last year, according to Federal Aviation
Administration numbers released in November. Those losses are humbling,
Sekora said, when you consider that [the U.S. all but created the drone
sector and wielded near-monopoly control over it for years after its
first public use of military attack drones in Afghanistan following the
Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks.]{.underline} [But U.S. monopoly
control over drone tech evaporated a long time ago]{.underline}.
According to defense experts, some [90 nations now possess drone
technology]{.underline}. And a third of those --- including U.S. rivals
such as China, North Korea and Iran --- now also have full-blown
weaponized military drones. Worse, [terrorist organizations, rebel
groups and other nonstate enemies have drones now, too, raising fears
about potential drone-based terror attacks]{.underline}. "Terrorist
organizations have an interest in using drones, and we've seen that
overseas already with some frequency," FBI Director Christopher Wray
told lawmakers at a Senate Homeland Security hearing in September. "And
the expectation is it's coming here, too. Imminently." Military
technologists and various third parties are working hard on technology
to capture and destroy enemy UAVs, he said, but "it's a challenge." Big
drones are findable via radar and GPS detection, but it's far more
difficult to detect, defend against and destroy small consumer drones
that rogue actors such as the Islamic State, Hamas and Hezbollah now
freely buy and customize to surveil and attack their enemies. Such
drones, whether solo or in swarms, are small, fly too low to be detected
by radar and rarely rely on detectable GPS tech. [The Pentagon has
launched a \$700 million program to address the menace of drones from
the Islamic State and other terrorist groups]{.underline}. It gathers
U.S. military resources plus those from big defense contractors and
Silicon Valley. But the program is embryonic and still a long way from
reality. As a stopgap, the Pentagon has been sending teams of tech
experts to Syria, Iraq and Afghanistan to train and otherwise help
American troops defend against enemy drones. "These things are really
small and hard to detect, and if they swarm in groups, they can overload
our ability to knock them all down," J.D. Johnson, Raytheon Co.'s head
of army programs, said earlier this year. For instance, according to
U.S. intelligence reports, IS has been using DJI's tiny Phantom drone to
surveil its enemies or drop explosives on them (right). U.S. Central
Command has been training Army troops on third-party jamming technology
such as national lab manager Battelle Memorial Institute's DroneDefender
(below). It's a "point-and-shoot rifle chassis" that can disrupt a UAV's
radio control signals or GPS system, which stops target drones in
midflight and forces them to land. It's a good stopgap, but the U.S. is
still a long way from having a foolproof drone terrorism defense plan.
"I don't think (these technologies are) ready right now," former U.S.
Army Special Forces commander Michael Waltz told American journalists
earlier this year. "[We don't have the technology --- the detection
technology and the countermeasure technology --- truly in place yet."
The threat of drone-based terror attacks is a direct result of America's
lost leadership in the sector, because it no longer calls the shots on
drone technology. As a result, said Sekora, it has little influence over
who gets to buy and sell it.]{.underline} New policies are the answer,
according to the Trump administration and [the FAA]{.underline}, which
[recently broke out a spate of new drone policies]{.underline} to make
it easier for U.S. companies to build, test, license, fly and sell
drones here and abroad[. But policies such as the FAA's Unmanned Aerial
Systems Pilot Program]{.underline}, which it unveiled last month with
the tagline, "Make aviation great again," [won't win back American drone
dominance nor keep American enemies from droning up]{.underline}, said
Sekora. "These policies won't do it," said Sekora, who is now president
of the consulting firm Quadrigy, which sells a third generation of
Socrates TechSpace tools such as research and automated competitive
analysis. "They're just the same old State Department-type policy
statements written by committees of MBAs and private consultancies.
There's nothing strategic about them." Sure, deregulation will help line
a few pockets, he added, "but in the end, such policies "treat the
symptoms, but not the disease." That "disease," he said, is the selfsame
one Project Socrates identified four decades ago as the main reason for
America's declining economic competitiveness. Project Socrates was set
up in 1983 to identify [the reasons behind America's declining
competitiveness]{.underline} against rivals such as Japan and the former
Soviet Union. The main culprit? [A gradual American business shift from
technology-based strategi]{.underline}c planning [to]{.underline} what
Sekora calls "[financial-based strategic planning]{.underline}." "When
we applied that and other Socrates principles to "Star Wars," American
missile technology suddenly was able to rapidly surpass Soviet
technologies, said Sekora. A technology-based strategy plan required
then, as it does now, a fundamental business strategy paradigm shift: a
concerted effort among government, industry and academia to form the
alliances needed to gain competitive advantage. Such a technology-first
focus calls for American companies and government to focus mainly on
acquiring the best technologies, regardless of who builds them. Costs,
profits and other financial considerations take a backseat in such an
arrangement. That's the way American industry worked for generations, of
course. But after World War II, when a victorious America emerged as the
world's premier leader in countless industries, [companies stopped
worrying about gaining competitive advantage through the best
technologies and forging the industry, academic and government alliances
needed to get there]{.underline}. Instead, they began making business
decisions based on what would save or make the most money in the short
term. Gradually, quarterly results, budgets and profits became the
filters through which all decisions were made. That's sufficient when
there's no competition to speak of, he said, but it's a short-sighted
approach in today's crowded technology markets, many of which are now
dominated by China." When we forced a switch back to a 'best technology'
focus, 'Star Wars' tech leapt forward to surpass Soviet missile
defenses," Sekora said. Returning to that tech-first focus may be the
only way America can regain control and guidance of the exploding
commercial and military drone sectors, he said. [Only when the U.S. can
call the shots in terms of drone tech and who's allowed to buy and sell
it can it do anything about the drone terror threat.]{.underline}
Despite its apparent success, Pres. George H.W. Bush ended the Project
Socrates initiative in 1991. Reports at the time said Bush was violently
opposed to any government policy or organization that interfered with
American businesses. So Sekora and other members of the team launched
Quadrigy in Austin to continue work on Socrates and the automated tools
it developed to help industries, governments and academia develop deep,
detailed tech-based strategies. But in 2002, Socrates and Sekora were
back on Capitol Hill. Adm. Craig Dorman (ret.), then chief scientist of
the Navy, tapped Sekora to bring Socrates-style tech-based planning to
the military, beginning with the booming drone sector. Could Socrates
help retain American control of the space? "We set out to identify the
nature of drone technologies and strategies that countries all over the
world were already executing," he said. The resulting research "made
clear to us that almost all countries would soon have UAVs, minimizing
any competitive advantage the U.S. enjoyed at the time," said Sekora.
And when anyone can buy or sell drones, he realized, terrorists and
other nonstate actors would be able to leverage their power, which would
be a huge national security threat. "[All of this would soon have the
effect of immediately negating the strength of our drone-centered
military strategies at home and abroad]{.underline}," Sekora said. "So
we came up with a technology strategy for drone industry companies,
academics and government, which would enable the U.S. to maintain both
control and a competitive advantage in UAVs for many years well past
2013," he said. The plan relied on the creation of industrywide
alliances among academia, government and drone suppliers. Specifically,
it suggested an alliance between the DoD and Ford Motor Co., which was
working on drone sensor development. Dorman, Sekora and the Quadrigy
team pitched that technology-first drone strategy proposal to the
Defense Department, but the reception was cool. "Like a lot of people at
the time, [the Defense Secretary was certain that the U.S. would remain
the leading developer, manufacturer and arbiter of drone
tech]{.underline} because, he said, the barriers to entry were too high
for other nations," he said. Moreover, the department resisted what it
called "an unlikely and unprecedented alliance between Ford, the
government and industry," saying that tactic "was way too aggressive."
After months of debate and endless argument with the DOD, Sekora and
Dorman finally gave up. Fast-forward 16 years, and their predictions
have come true: [Today's drone sector is dominated by China, and
terrorist access to drones resulting from the drone tech diaspora now
constitutes a major national security threat]{.underline}. [Time is
running out for the U.S. to regain leadership]{.underline}. The election
of an outsider like Trump initially gave him hope that the U.S. would
once again use Socrates findings and tools to regain lost ground, but
Sekora said Trump's hiring strategy is a bad sign: "Almost without
exception, he only appoints people from the world of finance." Public
perception is a problem, too. Americans "can't understand that a couple
of smart college grads with the right degrees and backing will never be
able to outcompete China," he said. "[China is executing a
technology-first strategy that enables Chinese industry, academia and
government to work as a coherent team to systematically, offensively and
defensively outmaneuver all the fragmented players in
America."]{.underline} And ["anyone who believes that China's big gains
are due to cheap manufacturing and mere currency manipulation," he
added, "is terribly mistaken. China's rapid rise worldwide is 100
percent due to technology-based planning," he said. "If you can't see
that, you're not paying attention."]{.underline}

any, [states will use drones in the way that the United States currently
does, as a way to ruthlessly target militant networks in ungoverned
territories.]{.underline} Rather, [the proliferation of
drones]{.underline} will also be accompanied by rapid adaption of drones
to new, and perhaps unforeseen, civilian and military uses, which [will
have three consequences for the international system]{.underline}.
[First, the]{.underline} [proliferation of drones will reset the rules
and norms governing surveillance and reconnaissance and invite new
counter-measures that may paradoxically increase uncertainty between
regional rivals over the long run]{.underline}. [Second]{.underline}, as
a low-cost, apparently low-risk form of technology, [drones will become
increasingly useful to governments in testing the strategic commitments
and the nerves of their rivals.]{.underline} Even today, a number of
governments and rebel groups facing regional rivalries have started to
use drones in ways that chip away at the foundations of previously
stable deterrent relationships. [Third, the worldwide proliferation of
drones in contested airspace, and the increasing risk that a drone will
have an accident with a civilian aircraft, multiplies the chances of a
conflict spiral stemming from an accident or drone misuse. Given these
risks, it is in Washington's interest to take a leading role in slowing
the race for drones and developing new legal, institutional and
normative mechanisms to govern drone usage and sale in the
future.]{.underline}

**Even if U.S. tries to sell drones, nobody will buy them - China has
won the drone wars.**

[Even with the Trump administration reforms]{.underline}, [it may
ultimately be too late to capture an export market dominated by
China,]{.underline} as well as Israel. "[The Chinese have made a lot of
inroads into the market]{.underline}, and U.S. export policy has
definitely helped them, [because the U.S. has stayed out of a lot of
potential markets]{.underline}," says Philip Finnegan, the director of
corporate analysis at Teal Group in Fairfax, Virginia. "[While some
areas might be filled by Israeli manufacturers who are very
active]{.underline}, [the Middle East is one where the Israelis aren't
active]{.underline} for obvious reasons. And [so the Chinese have filled
the void]{.underline}." The CH-4, whose resemblance to the iconic
Predator is no accident, follows a long tradition of Chinese technology
manufacturing, whether in cars or smartphones: Make it look like a
name-brand Western equivalent, but build it cheaper and good enough to
get the job done. (Amusingly, a video at the show advertising the CH-4
called it "one of the best" UAVs in the world, as in, not the best.)
[Analysts have even
[suggested](http://www.atimes.com/chinas-armed-drones-appear-built-from-stolen-data-from-us-cyber-intrusions/),
albeit without proof, that China pilfered U.S. technical information for
its drone program]{.underline}. [China's sales have been buoyed by
developing countries looking to fight insurgencies]{.underline}, and
[one of the factors driving recent buys, including Iraq's, has been the
war on the Islamic State]{.underline}, which has also proved an
advertising boon to the Chinese. At the exhibit area for China's
Aerospace Long-March International Trade Co., the maker of the CH-4, a
video promoting the company's drones featured extensive footage released
by the Iraqi military showing strikes on Islamic State fighters. [The
Iraq military has already conducted at least 260 strikes against Islamic
State militants using the CH-4, with close to 100 percent
accuracy,]{.underline} according to a [Chinese-language
article](http://mil.news.sina.com.cn/jssd/2018-02-17/doc-ifyrrmye2266090.shtml).
(A Jordanian military officer told Foreign Policy that his country's
CH-4s, which are armed with Chinese AR-1 anti-tank missiles, similar to
the American Hellfire, have not fired weapons in combat yet.) Since
C[hina doesn't disclose all of its international customers,]{.underline}
it's hard to know the full extent of its sales[, but]{.underline} a
video on display at the exhibit [acknowledged Algeria, Nigeria, Jordan,
Zambia, Iraq, Saudi Arabia, Ethiopia, Turkmenistan, Pakistan, and
Myanmar as customers. Notably absent from that list is the United Arab
Emirates, which reportedly received its first CH-4 last
year]{.underline}. FP
[reported](http://foreignpolicy.com/2018/04/27/drone-wars-how-the-uaes-chinese-made-drone-is-changing-the-war-in-yemen/)
last month that the UAE used its Chinese drone to assassinate a Houthi
leader in Yemen. [While the Americans are just now moving forward with
selling armed drones, China has been going full steam
ahead]{.underline}. The CH-4 --- a medium-altitude, long-endurance UAV
--- is part of series of Rainbow drones produced by Aerospace Long-March
International. While the CH-4 physically resembles the American Reaper,
it is not as capable. It does not, for example, have a satellite link,
which means it must be operated within line of sight, which limits its
range and battlefield utility. China's newest drone, the CH-5, will have
a satellite link. Aerospace Long-March International was also marketing
smaller drones at SOFEX, including its CH-901, a minidrone that the
company calls a "suicide UAV." While eager to sell its products, the
company is also wary of scrutiny. Company representatives at the show
declined to speak to a reporter and refused to give business cards to
another visitor, an American who introduced himself as a "policy
advisor." Another Chinese company, called Shenzhen Precision Technology
Co., based in Shenzhen City, was at SOFEX advertising its small combat
drone that can shoot grenades. The 35-kilogram vertical takeoff and
landing drone can stay aloft for 20 minutes and has a range of 8
kilometers. Xue Kun, the company's executive director, says it took him
four years to design the drone, which he's selling, along with the
ground station, for \$300,000 each. He calls the concept an "air force
in a truck," because three can be loaded into a specially designed
carrying case attached to a vehicle. "[If you buy many, you can get a
discount]{.underline}," he says. "[I can also produce them locally, in
your country." He hasn't sold any of his combat drones abroad yet --- he
says they are used now only by Chinese police]{.underline} --- but he
hopes his attendance at SOFEX, his first opportunity to display a
mock-up of the drone at an international arms exhibition, would help
drum up sales. Operating Chinese drones rather than American ones offers
both economic and political advantages for some countries. [The Chinese
drones are much cheaper --- typically a quarter of the price of similar
American systems. China also is less likely to dictate how other
countries use them, whereas U.S. exports can come with
restrictions]{.underline}. The problem with allowing allies to buy
Chinese drones is not just financial. As Douglas Barrie, a senior fellow
at the U.K.-based International Institute for Strategic Studies, points
out, when foreign countries buy American weapons, the U.S. government
has the ability to exercise some control over how that technology is
used. "It's a balancing act, and it's very difficult to get right," he
says of U.S. export law. [The Chinese approach to selling weapons, he
says, is much more "transactional]{.underline}." [Now that the export
restrictions are being loosened, the United States does have the ability
to compete for more international sales, but the problem is that many
countries have already found what they need in Chinese
drones.]{.underline} Now, Barrie says, those countries might simply ask
themselves: [''Is the requirement fulfilled? This Chinese stuff is quite
good."]{.underline} [And then, even when they buy more drones, those
countries may simply stick with China. "Once you open the door," Barrie
says, "there's no guarantee you can close it."]{.underline}

**Trump\'s drone sale policy is dangerous -- easing restrictions
undermines our ability to set norms**

\"NEW RULES ON ARMED DRONE SALES LIKELY TO BENEFIT MIDDLE EAST STATES\".
States News Service, May 22, 2018)

Trump\'s expectations regarding armed drone sales will likely not
include the sale of unmanned armed drones comparable to America\'s most
sophisticated drone General Atomics\' MQ-9 Reaper, arguably the most
feared and sophisticated drone in operation today. Rather, [the new
policy is likely to lower barriers to sales of smaller hunter-killer
drones]{.underline}, which carry fewer missiles than the MQ-9 Reaper and
achieve shorter ranges as well. It is not yet clear whether smaller
American hunter-killer drones will attract the large numbers of foreign
buyers that the Trump administration has in mind for its expanded sales
of armed drones. Nevertheless, although h[unter-killer drones are
clearly less destructive than substantially larger MQ-9 drones, such
hunter-killer systems can still destroy military vehicles, protective
structures and armed positions at a cost substantially lower than the
price of the MQ-9 Reaper (roughly \$17 million dollars). It also appears
possible that the Trump administration will seek to weaken the
longstanding principle of applying the Missile Technology Control
Regime\'s \"strong presumption of denial,\" which automatically denies
approval of many drone sales in the absence of compelling security
reasons]{.underline}. [The current policy prescribes that buyers use the
weapons in strict accordance with international law. These]{.underline}
most sensible provisions [could very well fall prey to the Trump
administration\'s attempt to liberalize current drone policies. The
danger of liberalizing drone policy rules lies with the difficulty of
avoiding innocent civilian lives]{.underline}. A most telling and
detailed analysis of this danger was published in the New York Times in
November 2017. It found that while the American-led coalition claimed
that the ratio of civilian deaths to airstrikes against the Islamic
State in Iraq was one for every 157 strikes, the Times reporters found
that the number of civilian deaths was one for every five airstrikes, or
more than 31 times the Pentagon\'s claim. The Times team noted that
civilian casualties were at such a huge distance from official claims
that \"in terms of civilian deaths, this may be the least transparent
war in recent American history.\" [In another example, the frequency
with which innocent civilians are being intentionally or unintentionally
targeted in Yemen\'s civil war only seems to be expanding. On April 22,
2018, an air-strike by a Saudi-led coalition killed more than 20 people
at a wedding party, most of them children. Tit for tat killings are
routine in a seemingly never-ending war of attrition between Iran-backed
Houthis and Sunni Saudi Arabia.]{.underline} [Easier access to armed
drones and a weakening of international norms of]{.underline} behavior
are likely to increase the number of unintended civilian victims in
Yemen and other conflicts. Sadly, more than 10,000 people, including all
too many children, have lost their lives in Yemen, while disease runs
rampant. [The rapid development of UAV technology comes at no more
critical a time than the present.]{.underline} [The need for developing
international standards dealing with the export of such weapons systems
is imperative today. Such norms of behavior will become increasingly
critical as drone technology spreads not only to careful parties, but
more importantly to countries willing to misuse such unmanned systems.
Such norms and standards may well not be full-proof, but they are, in
any event, essential]{.underline}.

### AT Drone PIC -- Can't Solve Stability

#### Regulating drones fails -- armed drone exports will fuel global instability 

**Thrall & Dorminey '18** -- Thrall is an associate professor at George
Mason University's Schar School of Policy and Government where he
analyses the role of arms sales in U.S. foreign policy, Dorminey writes
at CATO about US defense budget, defense politics, force structure, and
involvement in the international arms trade (A. Trevor Thrall and
Caroline Dorminey, 4-19-2018, \"Trump's New Arms Sales Policy: What You
Should Know,\" Cato Institute,
https://www.cato.org/blog/trumps-new-arms-sales-policy-what-you-should-know)//VP

[On April 19, 2018]{.underline} the [Trump administration released an
updated version of the [U.S. Conventional Arms Transfer
Policy](https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/national-security-presidential-memorandum-regarding-u-s-conventional-arms-transfer-policy/)]{.underline},
the **[primary document outlining the strategy and guidelines for
American arms sales abroad]{.underline}**. Compared to the Obama- and
Bush-era guidelines, **[the Trump administration's policy emphasizes the
[economic
benefits](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/04/19/us/politics/trump-drones-sales.html)
from arms sales]{.underline}**. As a result, **[the new policy is
focused on streamlining the arms sales process, loosening controls on
what can be exported, and encouraging the U.S. government to be more
active in brokering deals.]{.underline}** At a news briefing announcing
the new policy Peter Navarro, assistant to the president for trade and
manufacturing policy, said that, "This will keep our defense industrial
base in the vanguard of emerging defense technologies while creating
thousands of additional jobs with good wages and generating substantial
export revenues." Though the consequences of this policy change will
take years to unfold, [there are several things we can already predict
about the limits and **dangers of the new policy**.]{.underline} Below
we list the most important areas to watch and provide links to some of
the best analysis available to date around the web. It's all about jobs,
but it won't create many. [If the administration's primary goal is to
enrich a few major defense contractors, it may succeed. If, on the other
hand, the goal is to create American jobs and bolster the economy more
generally, disappointment is inevitable]{.underline}. Jonathan Caverley,
writing at [War on the
Rocks](https://warontherocks.com/2018/04/americas-arms-sales-policy-security-abroad-not-jobs-at-home/),
argues: Even if the Trump administration boosts sales against such
headwinds, [this will not create many additional jobs. Arms]{.underline}
exports are a surprisingly inefficient means of employing people at
home. Using census data, [the Commerce
Department](https://www.bis.doc.gov/index.php/documents/pdfs/1620-twenty-first-report-to-congress-12-16/file)
estimates that a billion dollars of defense exports would "create or
sustain" 3,918 jobs, considerably fewer than the [5,700 jobs per billion
created by increased US exports more
broadly](https://www.trade.gov/mas/ian/build/groups/public/@tg_ian/documents/webcontent/tg_ian_005543.pdf).
Doubling the United States' annual arms exports to \$40 billion, a
highly unrealistic goal, would thus create fewer than 80,000 new jobs.
There are other industries the United States can promote that will [have
larger effects on
jobs](http://watson.brown.edu/costsofwar/files/cow/imce/papers/2017/Job%20Opportunity%20Cost%20of%20War%20-%20HGP%20-%20FINAL.pdf).
Unleash the drones Until now the United States has kept a close hold on
armed drones like the Predator and Reaper, [allowing
China](http://foreignpolicy.com/2018/05/10/china-trump-middle-east-drone-wars/)
to meet most of the global demand. [Under the new policy the United
States will begin to sell some drones through the [direct commercial
sales](https://www.state.gov/t/pm/rls/fs/2018/280506.htm)
process]{.underline}. In an oped for the [the Washington
Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/monkey-cage/wp/2018/04/20/a-new-u-s-policy-makes-it-somewhat-easier-to-export-drones/?noredirect=on&utm_term=.26126cee1eb7)
Michael C. Horowitz and Joshua A. Shwartz write: The [new policy goes
further than the Obama administration's [2015
guidance](https://2009-2017.state.gov/r/pa/prs/ps/2015/02/237541.htm)]{.underline}
in a few ways. This means U.S. manufacturers can export more directly to
other countries and bypass the [foreign military
sales](https://www.state.gov/t/pm/rls/fs/2018/280506.htm) process, which
entails more time-consuming involvement from the U.S. government.
Second, **[the new rules
[reclassify](https://www.state.gov/r/pa/prs/ps/2018/04/280613.htm)
drones with strike-enabling technology, like laser target designators,
as unarmed, which will make it easier to export them]{.underline}**.
Counterterrorism baked right in A much less visible policy change with
important ramifications is the move by the House Foreign Affairs
Committee [to
amend](https://foreignaffairs.house.gov/legislation/h-r-5677-international-security-assistance-act-of-2018/)
the Arms Export Control Act to include counterterrorism as an explicit
strategic justification for weapon sales. As Caroline [wrote for Ink
Stick](https://www.cato.org/publications/commentary/taxes-work-some-foreign-arsenal-assembly-required),
[this seemingly subtle **change in language expands the legal and
institutional footprint of the war on terror** and does so **despite**
the fact that most of the **major conventional weapons for sale by the
U.S. aren't much use for fighting terrorism or
insurgencies.**]{.underline} Every fed is now a salesperson With this
increased sales push, the Trump administration has established a new
"whole of government" approach. From the same
[Inkstick](https://inkstickmedia.com/your-taxes-at-work-some-foreign-arsenal-assembly-required/)
article, Caroline also notes, The change will effectively turn civil
servants who had been third-party brokers between foreign governments
and American defense contractors into de facto salespeople. Officials
talking up American defense products isn't new, but giving them the
directive to increase "economic security" gives profit a greater
emphasis --- with the commander-in-chief and his 2017 sales pitches to
the Saudis, for example, offering [model
behavior](https://www.defensenews.com/breaking-news/2017/06/08/revealed-trump-s-110-billion-weapons-list-for-the-saudis/)
in this regard. Arms sales will now (likely) cost U.S. taxpayers more
money It's still unclear how this strategy will be implemented at the
guidance and framework level, but there are several logical changes that
could flow from a new emphasis on profit. This could include a
transition from deals that use offsets as incentives to increased use of
Foreign Military Financing and other incentives that would shift the
burden of incentives from industry to the federal government. Caroline
explained the implications of this change,
[writing](https://inkstickmedia.com/your-taxes-at-work-some-foreign-arsenal-assembly-required/),
Currently, the majority of incentives to foreign buyers of American
weapons come in the form of offsets. These agreements are made once the
US government has cleared a sale and the company can liaise with
whichever foreign government is purchasing the product. Offsets are
meant to make the deals more attractive, and can include anything from
co-production to technology transfer to Foreign Direct Investments. This
takes a major cut out of any profit for the defense contractors, who
shoulder most of the cost. In 2014 alone, contractors
[reported](https://www.bis.doc.gov/index.php/forms-documents/pdfs/1449-final-20th-offsets-in-defense-trade-report-public-report)
\$20.5 billion in defense-related merchandise exports, with \$13 billion
worth of those sales including some kind of offset. The total value of
reported offset agreements for that year was \$7.7 billion --- over
one-third the value of total defense exports for that year. Obviously,
this makes offsets an unattractive option for increasing economic
security. The defense industry would prefer not to bear that burden---so
then how will diplomats sweeten the deal for interested buyers while
still protecting profit margins? ... Foreign Military Financing...to the
rescue? This type of financing comes directly out of the US federal
budget---specifically out of the State Department's portion. The [final
budget
omnibus](https://democrats-appropriations.house.gov/sites/democrats.appropriations.house.gov/files/wysiwyg_uploaded/Summary%20of%20FY2018%20Omnibus.pdf)
that was signed into law in March settled on \$6.1 billion to give
freely to other countries to purchase American weapons. That's
right---\$6 billion of American taxpayer dollars this year alone will go
towards subsidizing the arsenals of other nations so that they too can
"Buy American." Foreign Military Financing had, until now, been on the
decline. From 1985 to 2015 the program
[decreased](https://fas.org/sgp/crs/row/R40213.pdf) 50 percent in real
terms. With this new economic security component to stated guidance on
arms sales, there is a very real possibility that Foreign Military
Financing could continue to rise. Arms sales will continue to be a risky
business As we wrote in a [Cato Policy
Analysis](https://www.cato.org/publications/policy-analysis/risky-business-role-arms-sales-us-foreign-policy)
published in March, **[the United States has a poor track record when it
comes to assessing the potential risks from selling weapons
abroad.]{.underline}** [Since 2002 the United States has sold over \$300
billion worth of major conventional weapons to 167 countries including
places with repressive governments, histories of human rights abuses,
and which are engaged in active conflicts. U]{.underline}nfortunately,
despite the many negative unintended consequences that arms sales can
spawn, nothing in the Trump administration's new policy suggests it will
pay any more attention to these risks than previous administrations.
**[Given the administration's zeal to sell more weapons abroad, the most
likely outcome is even less sensitivity to downstream
risks]{.underline}**. Stay tuned.

### AT Drone PIC -- Asia Turn

#### The export of U.S. drones destabilizes South-East Asia - leads to terrorism and diplomatic feuds. 

**Sen '15 **

(Dr. Joydeep Sen, expert in South Asian politics, covers South and
South-east Asia for the Daily Brief, March 13,
2015, [[https://dailybrief.oxan.com/Analysis/DB198258/South-east-Asia-drone-sales-may-raise-terror-risks]{.underline}](https://dailybrief.oxan.com/Analysis/DB198258/South-east-Asia-drone-sales-may-raise-terror-risks)) 

Despite these positives, South-east Asian [UAV use presents a number of
risks and difficulties]{.underline}: [Policy lag.]{.underline} After
UAVs have been seen flying over unauthorised areas (such as over the
royal palace in Phnom Penh in February and near the Kuala Lumpur airport
runway in early March), [South-east Asian governments are beginning to
consider measures to regulate drone use. However, updating or devising
relevant policies will be a slow and uneven process, within which other
risks could flourish. Terrorism. The policy lag may contribute to
terrorist attacks.]{.underline} [There appears to be no notation or
control of drones being brought into South-east Asian countries for
casual/leisure use]{.underline}. Tourists report having brought
disassembled drones freely into Singapore, Thailand and Cambodia.
Potential terrorists could do likewise. [Despite UAV\'s benevolent uses,
Asian defence officials also fear that UAVs could be used for regional
terrorist attacks, particularly if Islamic State group (ISG) members
originally from South-east Asia return home from fighting in the Middle
East:]{.underline} Partly due to ISG\'s proven technological
orientation, [officials envision that former ISG personnel will probably
use UAVs for terrorism in the near future]{.underline}. [UAVs can be
modified to carry explosives, raising fears that they could replace
suicide bombers and be employed more easily and more often.]{.underline}
Exacerbating internal conflicts. Using drones to report information on
various forms of internal conflict, including large-scale demonstrations
or insurgencies, is inherently sensitive. Governments with internal
armed conflicts, such as Myanmar, will oppose the use of drones for
media coverage of such conflicts. Authoritarian governments, including
Vietnam, will probably attempt to control use of drones for reporting on
anti-government activities. However, such control will be difficult to
achieve since drones can be used for multiple purposes and offer
advantages to both sides of a conflict. Diplomatic spats. As the loss of
MH370 showed, [South-east Asian governments have weak communication
networks made worse by mutual distrust]{.underline}, which also applies
to communications with China (see SOUTH-EAST ASIA: MH370 exposes limits
of cooperation - May 28, 2014). [Malfunctioning drones veering off
course into foreign airspace/territory or a miscalculation in the use of
a UAV could spark significant diplomatic incidents, which could be fatal
in conflict areas]{.underline}. Armed drones sales. Thus far, South-east
Asia has focused on unarmed UAVs. Armed drones are significantly more
expensive, and require more complex infrastructure, including vehicle
and land systems and sophisticated radars. [South-east Asian countries
with strong military modernisation programmes, particularly Indonesia
and Singapore, already have drone programmes, while other South-east
Asian defence ministries are considering them]{.underline}. It is into
this context that the US may sell armed UAVs to South-east Asia. The
terms under which the United States lifted the ban on selling armed
drones are that governments wishing to buy US armed UAVs are required
to: have the necessary funds for the drones (some cost over 20 million
dollars); have the supporting infrastructure to use the drones; and be
allies or close security partners of the United States. As a close ally
with significant financial wealth, [Singapore is the frontrunner to buy
US-made armed UAVs first. While the Philippines is also a close
ally,]{.underline} it lacks equivalent financial resources. However, the
Philippines might access reduced prices through the FMS programme. US
concern over Thailand\'s military coup (May 2014) makes sales of armed
UAVs unlikely before the country returns to democratic government. Sales
of armed UAVs are unlikely to be made soon to Vietnam, Laos, Cambodia or
Myanmar, due to fears of misuse and diplomatic fallout, and as these
countries have relatively limited funds available. However, unarmed UAV
sales are possible. Indonesia may benefit from armed US UAV sales,
although it would need to convince the US State Department that the
drones were not intended for use internally, for instance on Papuan
separatists.

### AT Drone PIC -- Arms Race Turn

#### U.S. drone sales lead to drone proliferation. 

**Zenko and Kreps '14**

 (Micah Zenko and Sarah E. Kreps, senior fellow and political scientist
for CFR, June 2014)

[The Obama administration should pursue a strategy that places clear
limits on its own sale and use of armed drones lest these weapons
proliferate and their use becomes widespread]{.underline}. These are the
central findings of a new report by CFR Douglas Dillon Fellow Micah
Zenko and Stanton Nuclear Security Fellow Sarah Kreps, published by the
Center for Preventive Action (CPA). Although only five countries have
developed armed drones---the United States, Britain, Israel, China, and
Iran---[several]{.underline} other [countries have announced their own
programs.]{.underline} \"India reports that it will soon equip its
drones with precision-guided munitions and hopes to mass-produce combat
drones to conduct targeted strikes in cross-border attacks on suspected
terrorists. [Rebuffed by requests to procure U.S. armed drones, Pakistan
said it will develop them indigenously or with China\'s help to target
the Taliban in its tribal areas]{.underline}.\" The report also notes
that \"Turkey has about twenty-four types of drones in use or
development, four of which have been identified as combat drones,\"
while Switzerland, France, Italy, Spain, Greece, and Sweden \"have
collaborated on the Neuron, a stealth armed drone that made its first
demonstration flight in December 2012.\" Zenko and Kreps lay out several
reasons why armed drones are unique in their ability to destabilize
relations and intensify conflict. [Unmanned aircraft reduce the
threshold for authorizing military action by eliminating pilot casualty,
potentially increasing the frequency of force deployment.]{.underline}
[Because there is no onboard pilot, drones are less responsive to
warnings that could defuse or prevent a clash]{.underline}.
[Furthermore, countries may fire on a manned fighter plane, mistaking it
for an armed drone, which could increase the likelihood of
conflict]{.underline}. [In addition, the proliferation of unmanned
aircraft carries an increased risk of lethality because \"drones are, in
many ways, the perfect vehicle for delivering biological and chemical
agents.\"]{.underline} The authors write that [the Obama administration
faces two broad policy decisions: first, to determine the criteria and
principles that would guide exports of drones; and second, to cultivate
a set of norms and practices to govern their use.]{.underline} \"As the
lead user of drones, the United States has the unique opportunity to
determine which countries acquire these systems and hold them
accountable for how they use those drones,\" Zenko and Kreps assert.
[U.S. drone exports should require commitment to the following
principles: Peacefully resolving all outstanding border or maritime
disputes; peacefully brokering domestic political disputes; protecting
civilians from harm caused by other weapons platforms; and protecting
human rights. A set of norms to govern the use of drones would require
increased transparency on U.S. drone strike practices and targeting
decisions. \"A guiding principle for how the United States describes and
clarifies its drone operations should be based on type and specificity
of information it wants to see used by other armed drone
states.\"]{.underline} The report outlines other policy recommendations
for the Obama administration, including: Tasking the intelligence
community to publish an unclassified survey of the current and future
trends of unmanned military technologies---including ground, sea, and
autonomous systems---as they do for ballistic missiles and weapons of
mass destruction. [Commissioning an unclassified study by a federally
funded research institution to assess how unmanned aerial systems have
been employed in destabilizing settings and identify the most likely
potential future missions of drones that run counter to U.S. interests.
Directing administration officials to testify---for the first
time---before Senate and House Foreign Relations Committees]{.underline}
hearings on the principles and criteria that should guide armed and
unarmed drone exports. [Appointing a high-level panel of outside experts

transparency and potential effect on emerging proliferators, and propose

[The proliferation of drones to many states carries with it a second set
of risks that have been overlooked]{.underline} in much of the
controversy over the U.S. drones program in Pakistan and Yemen. [Even if

reasons. First, because drones are not manned aircraft, states may
calculate that their use is less consequential and risky than manned
aircraft]{.underline}. As David Hastings Dunn has pointed out, drones
appear as a disembodied threat, which seems to "enable their use with
domestic political impunity, minimal international response and low
political risk and cost."66 [Second, because drones are often physically
small, states may calculate that drones may be able to evade detection
in contested space, or at the very least be able to evade being shot
down. The result is that drones]{.underline} are a new form of
technology, particularly conducive to what Alexander L. George referred
to as "salami tactics"---that is, small steps used to [probe or test
deterrent relationships by violating commitments in a small but
measurable way]{.underline}.67 One example of such behavior occurred in
fall 2013, when [China surprised everyone by deploying a drone over the
contested Senkaku Islands in the East China Sea to test Japan's
commitment to its control over the islands.68 Japan scrambled F- 15
fighters in response and suggested that it might station Japanese
personnel on the island in retaliation. The situation escalated when
China extended its air defense zone in ways that covered these islands
and directly conflicted with Japan's self- declared air defense zone.
Japan approved a plan to shoot down Chinese drones that flew over the
disputed islands, and China responded by declaring that such an act
would constitute "an act of war."69]{.underline} In January 2014, Japan
announced plans to deploy three U.S.-made Global Hawk drones by
2015-2016 in an attempt to counter China's efforts to claim air and
naval dominance in the East China Sea and South China Sea.70 [The result
has been an unprecedented level of tension in a relationship that has
remained stable, and largely without such provocative incidents, for
decades]{.underline}. China's assertiveness in this incident suggests
that those who assumed that the country would be restrained in its drone
use for fear of escalation or international condemnation might be
mistaken.71 [The apparent low-cost nature of the technology makes these
kinds of probing attacks seem more attractive even to a generally
risk-averse government]{.underline} like China. [Drones provide the
illusion of a controllable risk especially if a government can convince
itself that the absence of human casualties from a shoot-down of the
drones makes the incident negligible. Yet apparently negligible
incidents sometimes have very real consequences. The risks of a conflict
spiral arising from the shoot-down of the drone or an
accident]{.underline} of some kind in the East China Sea [are real and
potentially dangerous,]{.underline} especially if either China or Japan
see their national interests or pride at stake in such an encounter. Now
that China appears willing to throw its weight around more in the Asian
region, its use of drones may increase as a way of testing Japanese
nerves and U.S. commitments to its allies.

#### Drone exports cause conflicts via miscalc and accidents

[Another reason to be concerned about the growing drone arms race is the
danger of accidents and the conflict spirals that can come from
them.]{.underline} [While drones are becoming more sophisticated, they
are still prone to frequent accidents.]{.underline} According to an
estimate in 2010, the United States has experienced at least 79 drone
accidents costing at least \$1 million each, as well 38 Predator and
Reaper drone crashes during combat missions in Afghanistan and Iraq.76
Drones such as the Pioneer and Shadow drones have even higher rates of
accidents.77 [A later estimate in 2014 put the total number of major
drone crashes at over 400 since 2001.78]{.underline} Although it is
estimated that many of these accidents are caused by human error, and
that accident rate is declining, [these rates are]{.underline} still
[much higher than comparable manned aircraft.7]{.underline}9 It is also
probable that less sophisticated and robust models sold by China and
other new suppliers will have a higher rate of accident than the more
robust American models. Simply as a matter of probability, [it is likely
that drone accidents will become more commonplace as more drones take to
the skies in the future. Drone accidents are more than just unfortunate
for those who happen to be hurt by them when they fall from the skies.
There is a serious risk that drones may interfere with civilian aircraft
and cause accidents with more substantial loss of life.]{.underline} In
2004, a German UAV nearly crashed into an Ariana Airlines Airbus A300
carrying 100 people in the skies over Kabul.80 Over the last ten years,
drones have been equipped with anti-collision software designed to avert
such crashes, but [dangers remain]{.underline}. One estimate in 2012
found that at least seven U.S. Predator or Reaper drones have crashed
overseas in the vicinity of civilian airports.81 In September 2013, the
United States was forced to move its drone operations from Camp Lemonier
in Djibouti due to concerns that drones would crash into passenger
planes from a nearby airport.82 [As drones proliferate around the world,
the dangers of conflict spirals from accidents and collisions with
civilian aircraft will multiply.]{.underline}

#### Drone Sales to Indian throw the balance of power off, risking conflict

urgent need to acquire heavier armed drones as a deterrent.]{.underline}
\"We have already taken notice of these reports. Be rest assured that
necessary measures are being taken at the right places,\" a top Indian
military official told the Asian Age. Correspondingly[, India\'s
purchase of drones, especially from the US, has been alarming to

### AT Risk Assessment CP -- Can't Solve

#### Risk assessments won't reduce dangerous arms sales -- the government lacks appropriate screening measures and will simply ignore the assessment 

A. Trevor **Thrall and** Caroline **Dorminey**, 3/13/18, \[Thrall is an
associate professor at the Schar School of Policy and Government at
George Mason; Dorminey is a policy analyst at the Cato Institute-, Cato
Institute, "risky business: the role of arms sales in US foreign
policy,"
https://www.cato.org/publications/policy-analysis/risky-business-role-arms-sales-us-foreign-policy,
mm

In order to comply with the Arms Export Control Act (AECA), the U.S.
government must generate a risk assessment in order to confirm that
sales are unlikely to produce unwanted outcomes. This requirement makes
sense, because history shows that arms sales can lead to a host of
negative, unintended consequences. These consequences come in many
forms, from those that affect the United States, such as blowback and
entanglement in foreign conflicts, to those that affect entire regions,
such as instability and dispersion, to those that affect the recipient
regime itself, such as enabling oppression and increasing the likelihood
of military coups. Forecasting how weapons will be used, especially over
the course of decades, is difficult, but history provides evidence of
the factors that make negative outcomes more likely. Sadly, however,
[even a cursory review of American arms sales over time makes it clear
that neither the White House, nor the Pentagon, nor the State Department
--- all of which are involved in approving potential sales --- takes the
risk assessment process seriously.]{.underline} [Historically, the
United States has sold weapons to almost any nation that wanted to buy
them --- suggesting that the risk assessment process **is rigged to not
find risk.**]{.underline} From 2002 to 2016, America delivered \$197
billion in weapons to 167 states worldwide.6 Thirty-two of these
countries purchased at least \$1 billion in arms. The Kingdom of Saudi
Arabia was America's biggest client, purchasing \$25.8 billion worth of
weapons --- including F-15s and a litany of helicopters, naval assets,
and associated munitions. As shown in Table 1, the top 10 clients
collectively bought \$124 billion in arms --- accounting for roughly
two-thirds of the value of America's total global exports since 2002.
[Given the amount of chaos, instability, and conflict in the world, it
is difficult to imagine what sort of process would assess as many as 167
of the world's roughly 200 countries as safe bets to receive American
weapons.]{.underline} Moreover, [the United States has a long history of
selling weapons to nations where the immediate risks were
obvious.]{.underline} From 1981 to 2010, the United States sold small
arms and light weapons to 59 percent and major conventional weapons to
35 percent of countries actively engaged in a high-level conflict. The
United States sold small arms to 66 percent and major conventional
weapons to 40 percent of countries actively engaged in a low-level
conflict.7 As one author noted, in 1994 there were 50 ongoing ethnic and
territorial conflicts in the world and the United States had armed at
least one side in 45 of them. Since 9/11, the United States has sold
weapons to at least two dyads in conflict: Saudi Arabia and Yemen, and
Turkey and the Kurds.8 To produce a risk assessment of American arms
recipients since 2002, we consulted previous research to identify the
risk factors most commonly associated with both short- and long-term
negative outcomes. Unfortunately, there are no hard data on the precise
relationship between many of these risk factors and the probability of
negative outcomes. We also lack data entirely for certain risk factors
that we would otherwise have included. A nation's previous use (and
misuse) of American weapons, for example, is clearly among the most
important factors to assess. Neither the government nor academic
research, however, exists to inform such an assessment. As a result, we
take a conservative approach, creating an index of overall riskiness
based on straightforward assumptions about the correlations between risk
factors and negative outcomes on data that are available, rather than
attempting to make precise predictions about the impact of each specific
risk factor, or speculating about the impact of factors we cannot
measure. The first risk factor we consider is the stability of the
recipient nation. We assume that fragile states with tenuous legitimacy
and little ability to deliver services and police their own territory,
or those that cannot manage conflict within their borders, pose a
greater risk for the dispersion and misuse of weapons. Research also
indicates that military aid can increase the likelihood of a military
coup, an outcome even more likely in the case of a fragile state.9 To
measure this factor, we take the most recent score for each nation on
the Fragile States Index, which determines a state's vulnerability by
looking at a range of economic, political, and social factors.10 The
second risk factor we look at is the behavior of the state toward its
own citizens. We assume that states that rank poorly on human rights
performance or that regularly use violence against their own people pose
a greater risk of misusing weapons in the short or long term. To measure
this we rely on two sources: Freedom House's Freedom in the World
rankings, which assess "the condition of political rights and civil
liberties around the world,"11 and the State Department's Political
Terror Scale, which provides a more specific measurement of a state's
use of torture and violence against its citizens.12 Finally, we consider
the level of conflict, both internal and external, each state is engaged
in. We assume that countries dealing with widespread terrorism and
insurgency, or actively engaged in an interstate conflict, also
represent higher risks of negative outcomes such as dispersion,
blowback, entanglement, conflict, and human rights abuses. Though the
United States may have reasons to provide arms to nations engaged in
such conflicts or dealing with terrorism, the risk of negative
consequences remains. To assess these factors, we rely on the Global
Terrorism Index, which measures the scope of terrorism in a country, and
the UCDP/PRIO Armed Conflict Dataset, published by the Uppsala Conflict
Data Program and the Peace Research Institute Oslo, which tracks each
country's involvement in wars as well as in smaller conflicts.13 To
gauge the riskiness of selling weapons to a given country, we combined
its scores on these five metrics into a single risk index score. Since
the measures all used different scales, we first recoded each of them
into three categories: low, medium, and high risk. For example, we coded
"not free" countries as high risk (3 points); "partly free" countries as
medium risk (2 points); and "free" countries as low risk (1 point). The
result was a risk index that runs from 5 (countries scoring "low risk"
on all measures) to 15 (countries scoring "high risk" on all measures).
To facilitate our reporting we then grouped the results into four risk
categories. We gave the Highest Risk designation to the 5 countries that
scored as "high risk" on every measure. At the other end of the
spectrum, the Lowest Risk category contains the 38 countries that rated
as "low risk" on all five measures. The categories between these two are
Very Risky (64 countries) and Somewhat Risky (60 countries). Table 2
reveals the distribution of countries across risk categories as well as
the average total arms sales by category since 2002. Three important
observations immediately emerge from the analysis. First, there are a
large number of risky customers in the world, and the United States
sells weapons to most of them. Thirty-five nations (21 percent) scored
in the highest-risk category on at least two metrics, and 72 (43
percent) were in the highest-risk category on at least one of the five
measures. There simply are not that many safe bets when it comes to the
arms trade. Second, the [data provide compelling evidence that the
United States does not discriminate between high- and low-risk
customers.]{.underline} The average sales to the riskiest nations are
higher than those to the least risky nations. Considering discrete
components of the index, for example, the 22 countries coded as "highest
risk" on the Global Terrorism Index bought an average of \$1.91 billion
worth of American weapons. The 28 countries in active, high-level
conflicts bought an average of \$2.94 billion worth of arms. Applying
our risk assessment framework to the list of 16 nations currently banned
from buying American weapons helps illustrate the validity of our
approach. The average score of banned nations is 11.6, with 12 nations
scoring 10 or higher. The highest-scoring nations were Syria, Sudan, and
the Democratic Republic of the Congo, with Iran, Eritrea, and the
Central African Republic not far behind. Clearly these are nations to
which the United States should not be selling weapons. What is
especially troubling is that the United States sold weapons to several
of these countries in the years right before sales were banned, when
most of the risks were readily apparent. Moreover, America's customer
list includes 32 countries with a risk score above the average of those
on the banned list. This reinforces our concern that [the U.S.
government does not block sales to countries that clearly pose a risk of
negative consequences.]{.underline} The third major observation is that
this lack of discrimination is dangerous. As simple as it is, our risk
assessment is a useful guide to forecasting negative consequences. The
five countries that scored as high risk on all five measures provide a
clear illustration of the risks of arms sales. This group, which
purchased an average of \$1.8 billion in U.S. weapons since 9/11,
includes Libya, Iraq, Yemen, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, and
Sudan. These five countries, recall, are classified by the various
metrics as: "terror everywhere," "not free," "most fragile," "large
impact from terrorism," and as being involved in high-level conflicts.
These governments have used their American weapons to promote
oppression, commit human rights abuses, and perpetuate bloody civil
wars. Within the Very Risky category, each country rated as "highest
risk" on at least one measure, and 30 scored as "highest risk" on at
least two measures. This group also represents the full range of
unintended consequences from arms sales. Afghanistan, Egypt, Somalia,
and Ukraine fall into this category. This group collectively spent an
average of \$1.38 billion over the time period. Since 9/11, the Kingdom
of Saudi Arabia (which scored a 12) invaded Yemen, intervened in Tunisia
and Syria, and provoked a crisis with Qatar, while cementing a track
record of human rights abuses and government oppression. Other states in
this category, such as Afghanistan (score of 14), have entangled the
United States in counterproductive conflicts since 9/11 and continue to
do so today. [Even arms sales to the less risky nations do not come
without risk.]{.underline} For example, the Somewhat Risky category
includes the United Arab Emirates, which is involved in an active
conflict in Yemen, as well as Georgia, which has dangerous neighbors.
Finally, the Lowest Risk category includes most of the NATO nations,
Taiwan, South Korea, and a range of other, mostly smaller nations with
stable governments, such as Barbados and Grenada, located in friendly
neighborhoods. These countries pose little risk for problems like
dispersion, destabilization, or misuse of weapons for oppression. [In
some cases]{.underline}, however, [arms sales could alter regional
balances of power in ways that increase tensions and the chance of
conflict]{.underline}. U.S. arms sales to NATO allies, as part of the
European Reassurance Initiative, for example, have upset Russian
leaders.14 Similarly, arms sales to Taiwan, itself not a risky customer,
have nonetheless raised tensions between China and the United States.15
In short, [even a relatively simple risk assessment makes it clear that
the policy of the United States is to sell weapons to just about any
nation that can afford them without much concern for the
consequences]{.underline}. Though the United States does limit its most
advanced weapons to allies16 and maintains a ban on the sale of
materials related to weapons of mass destruction,17 the United States
has sold just about everything else, in many cases to countries
embroiled in interstate and civil conflicts, to countries with
horrendous human rights records, and to countries that represent a risk
for entangling the United States in unwanted conflicts.
