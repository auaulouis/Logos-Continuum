## War

### Lashout

#### Containment strategy will cause China to lash out and regional instability

[Japanese policy-makers]{.underline} clearly [hope]{.underline} this
double strategy of engaging China in East Asia and soft [containment
globally will oblige Chinese policy-makers to come to an accommodation
with Japan\'s legitimate economic and security concerns]{.underline} and
with its continuing leadership aspirations in East Asia. In this way,
China\'s rise and Japan\'s relative decline can be carefully managed, it
is hoped for the benefit of region-building in East Asia. [Japan\'s
strategy is]{.underline}, though, [risk-laden. Its attempt to engage
China in East Asia through containment elsewhere clearly runs the risk
of a hostile Chinese counter reaction]{.underline} if it succeeds or is
not sufficiently carefully calibrated to assuage Chinese concerns at
being contained. The greater peril, though, lies in Japan\'s strategy
simply turning out to be ineffective in exerting any influence on
China\'s rise, thereby provoking a far stronger counterreaction from
Japan itself. Japan\'s bilateral and trilateral frameworks for engaging
China in East Asia are built on precarious foundations. Japan\'s
domestic constituency for engaging China has held for the moment, but as
the LDP\'s grip on power slips the Revisionists are increasingly likely
to search for legitimacy and to fulfil their political doctrine by
pressing a nationalist agenda, often directed against China. Japanese
policy makers\' [hesitation about engaging China may be compounded by
the failure to achieve progress]{.underline} on key bilateral projects.
For instance, Japan\'s government has already lodged protests with China
since January 2009 over its continuing explo ration of gas fields in the
East China Sea in contravention of the centrepiece agree ment of the
mutually beneficial partnership. [Japan\'s failure in bilateral
engagement with China is matched by a similar risk of the failure of
trilateral engagement]{.underline}. [Japan must hope that as it
increasingly throws in its security lot with the US there is no serious
increase in Sino-US security tensions, lest it become entrapped in an
active US containment policy of China]{.underline}, or even in military
conflict. Japan\'s other fear must be that it does not again experi ence
a policy of US \'passing\' Japan for China, a fear rendered more acute
by the advent of a new Democratic administration in [the
US]{.underline}. In this respect Japan may feel that it has lost the
reassurance of the US security backstop to fend off China\'s regional
rise. Japan may have been reassured thus far by the new Barack Obama
administration, with Secretary of State Hillary Clinton
[choosing]{.underline} Japan as the destination for her first overseas
visit in February 2009, and As? being the first foreign leader to visit
the new president in the White House the following month. However,
Clinton\'s apparent cosying up to Beijing on the latter part of her Asia
tour has not inspired confidence that the US is willing to give
exclusive backing to Japan\'s cause in the region. If its engagement
policy is undermined, Japan may then need to contemplate shifting [to
emphasize a default strategy of containing China. Japan would inevi
tably seek to do this first through stronger US?Japan alliance
ties]{.underline}, but then, if the US relationship were not seen to
function in support of its interests, by activating its own military
power. Japan might thus be returned to its long-feared scenario of
having to fend for its own security and undertake full remilitarization,
[which would lead it into a destructive downward-spiralling security
dilemma with China]{.underline}. The destructive impact for East Asia
region-building attempts, with the region denied opportunities for
cooperation between its two leading powers, are obvious. Similarly,
[open rivalry between Japan and China might spill over into full
competition for influence in other regions.]{.underline} Japan might
well lose this competition, but only after considerable disruption is
inflicted upon these other regions\' development and integration
efforts.

#### Taiwan independence forces China to react militarily

[What the Chinese are most afraid of is a real movement toward
independence. Which they have to stop. They have to continually warn
Taiwan - and the United States - that \"hey, don\'t push us too far. Or
we will be forced to react militarily.\" That doesn\'t mean they want to
invade Taiwan. They have a short timetable. The number one
principle\--if you are a Chinese leader\--is not that you have to regain
Taiwan in the next five years. It\'s that you can\'t lose
Taiwan.]{.underline} Why do they worry about a small island, like this?
[It\'s their unfinished civil war.]{.underline} It just looms very large
in the history and mythology of the People\'s Republic of China. They
fought a civil war with this nationalist government. They essentially
defeated them. The nationalists escaped to an island which they consider
an integral part of China. [And then, because of American support and
other intervening factors, they never finished. And I think especially
for the military, this is the main reason for being\--is to prevent
Taiwanese independence and some day retake Taiwan. \... I think
preventing Taiwanese independence is sort of a core principle of
politics here. And no politician could go against that.]{.underline}

How dangerous is the Taiwan issue? \... prior to the World Trade Center
bombing and its aftermath, if you asked where in the world could two
major nuclear powers come into conflict, I would have said that the only
probable place \-- and it is probably still the only probable place \--
where two big nuclear powers could come into conflict would be the
Taiwan [Strait. In effect, the prevention of Taiwan going independent is
absolutely critical to the legitimacy of the Chinese communist regime.
Chinese leaders believe that, if they were to let Taiwan go independent
and not respond, they would probably be overthrown by their own
nationalistic people. Therefore, I think they would be willing to engage
in what we might call \"self-defeating military adventures\" in order to
prevent that result, even if they knew they were going to lose. So in my
view, the key problem for the United States is how to deter the PRC from
using force against Taiwan.]{.underline} We have to be very clear about
that, because I think the United States would intervene if force were
used under most circumstances I can imagine. [But on the other hand, we
have to deter Taiwan from engaging in such risky behavior that they
precipitate an attack that will be destabilizing to Asia, destroy the
Taiwan economy and drag the United States into a regional conflict. And
what would provoke this \-- for China? They have a list of things that
would provoke, but basically, certainly a \... declaration of
independence would be one of those things. I would think it would
probably mean war]{.underline}. It would certainly mean some form of
military conflict or economic embargo or an attempt by the PRC to
destabilize Taiwan\'s economy. But let\'s put it this way: It would mean
a substantial escalation of conflict \... the inevitable result of
that\... So how long is China prepared to wait to make sure that Taiwan
becomes part of China? \...[As long as they have confidence that Taiwan
is not going to go independent and that the forces of economic
integration are gradually pulling Taiwan towards the mainland, I think
they can be very patient; and by \"very patient,\" I mean decades. Why
do they have this extraordinary military buildup of missiles opposite
Taiwan]{.underline}? I\'m not quite sure that the word \"extraordinary\"
is justified. But it is significant. They\'re probably adding maybe 50 a
year short-range and medium-range ballistic missiles in the area of the
Taiwan Strait in coastal China, and that\'s a significant threat. But in
the end, these missiles are, in effect, just large bombs. And if you
start using those missiles against the people of Taiwan, does anyone
seriously think this is going to increase the willingness of the people
of Taiwan to join in any significant political union with the PRC?
\...So my general advice to the PRC is find more positive reasons that
the people of Taiwan should want to be in some closer political
association with you. You might be able to prevent them declaring
independence with military force, but you will never achieve
reunification with those means. Does America have an obligation to
defend Taiwan if it\'s attacked[? We no longer have a treaty obligation
to come to the defense of Taiwan. What we have is what\'s called the
Taiwan Relations Act of 1979. This obligates the United States to sell
weapons of a defensive character to Taiwan. It obligates us to be
concerned about the situation in Taiwan and the region. And it obligates
the president of the United States to consult with Congress about what
to do. So, in a sense, we are obligated to be concerned and give Taiwan
the means by which it can defend itself, but we are not obligated to
come to the direct rescue.]{.underline}

#### US containment strategy leads to conflict with China

**Hu 2017** (Hu, Weixing. Head, Department of Politics and Public
Administration. \"China and the United States in the Asia-Pacific:
Towards a New Model or New Normal of Major Power Relations?\" *China: An
International Journal*, vol. 15 no. 1, 2017, pp. 63-82. *Project MUSE*,
muse.jhu.edu/article/650100.) VL

Obama's rebalance to Asia is changing the game of major power relations
in the Asia-Pacific as well as the future course of US--China relations.
[The rebalancing discourse has changed the US China policy debate and
reversed the "engagement and reassurance" policy]{.underline} in the
early months of the Obama administration. The Sino--US relations can be
characterised as both competitive and cooperative. But the competitive
part need not be tantamount to confrontation if the two countries can
manage the competition and reassure each other through cooperation. The
"pivot to Asia", however, has changed [China's threat perception and
significantly tipped the China--US relations to competition,
which]{.underline} could [increase the prospect of a potential China--US
collision]{.underline} in the Asia-Pacific. The self-fulfilling prophecy
further [intensifies the effect of a "security dilemma]{.underline}" and
poses challenges to the expansion of cooperation between the two
countries. When the idea of "pivot to Asia" was first introduced,
Beijing adopted a wait-and-see attitude. The Chinese Foreign Ministry
spokesperson commented, in a somewhat conciliatory tone, that China
supports "the constructive role played by the U.S. in the Asia-Pacific
region".[^12^](https://libproxy.library.unt.edu:2408/article/650100#f12)
However, as the motivations of the pivot policy became more obvious, it
began to draw considerable attention and debate within the Chinese
foreign policy
community,[^13^](https://libproxy.library.unt.edu:2408/article/650100#f13)
who generally believe that the [US]{.underline} pivot [is a new source
of tension and specifically targets China]{.underline}. The rebalancing
thus [implies Washington's readiness to intervene in the region and may
result in a more unsettling regional situation]{.underline} in the
future. Focusing on the main pillars of the rebalancing,
[Chinese]{.underline} elites and [policy]{.underline} analysts
[consider]{.underline} at least [three areas as major]{.underline}
sources of [threats]{.underline} to Chinese interest: [(i) the enhanced
US military presence and future regional security; (ii) the
Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) initiative and future regional
institution building; and (iii) the implications of a US role in
regional territorial and maritime disputes.]{.underline} First of all,
the Chinese threat perception post-September 11 had to be significantly
revised since the pivot calls for substantive reinforcement of the US
military presence in the Asia-Pacific region. As the Obama
administration tried to reduce the budget deficit and defence spending,
the Pentagon managed to prevent the impacts of budget cuts to have a
bearing on the US military presence in the Asia-Pacific. Instead of
extreme cutbacks across the board, the Pacific theatre actually
underwent further strengthening. According to US Defence Secretary
Ashton Carter, the Pentagon has committed to home-porting 60 per cent of
its naval and overseas air assets in the region and to modernising its
existing military footprint in Japan and South Korea, so that the US
military can continue to play a pivotal role from the sea, the air and
**\[End Page 68\]** underwater in the region. It has deployed some of
the most advanced capabilities, including F-22 and F-35 stealth fighter
jets, P-8A Poseidon maritime patrol aircraft, V-22 Ospreys, B-2 bombers,
and the latest surface warfare ships to the region. American troops have
also returned to old bases they abandoned after the Cold War. [The new
US military doctrine and concept]{.underline}, like the Air-Sea Battle
(ASB), [emphasises pre-emptive and deep strikes against Chinese military
facilities and deployments. This is a serious threat to China's national
security.]{.underline} Most importantly, Washington's so-called
"principled security
network"[^14^](https://libproxy.library.unt.edu:2408/article/650100#f14)
is clearly aimed at China or an anti-China coalition in the region.
Second, as the economic pillar of the rebalance, [the Trans-Pacific
Partnership (TPP) is viewed as politically motivated to hold back
China's growing economic power in the region.]{.underline} According to
Donilon, the TPP is a key tenet of the "concerted effort to develop and
strengthen regional institutions---in other words, building out the
architecture of Asia". In his view, an effective regional architecture
lowers the barriers to collective action on shared challenges and
creates dialogues and structures [that help encourage cooperation,
maintain stability, resolve disputes through diplomacy and ensure that
countries can rise
peacefully]{.underline}.[^15^](https://libproxy.library.unt.edu:2408/article/650100#f15)
In order to play a leading role in regional institution-building,
President Obama made great efforts to meet regional leaders and get
involved in regional dialogues and institution building. Among various
projects, the TPP is probably the central piece of the regional
architecture-building, in which Washington takes on a leadership role
while China is being excluded. While there is nothing wrong pushing
forward a high-standard free trade agreement in the region, [Beijing
feels that China should not be excluded]{.underline}. In this sense,
some [Chinese observers regard the TPP]{.underline} not as an economic
undertaking but primarily [as an instrument of US political strategy for
containing China and undermining the Asian-oriented
regionalism]{.underline} based on the ASEAN Plus Three process following
the 1998 Asian financial
crisis.[^16^](https://libproxy.library.unt.edu:2408/article/650100#f16)
Although thr TPP is doomed under the Trump administration, Washington
may still use other means to influence regional trade patterns and terms
of trade in its favour. Third and more importantly, the rebalance to
Asia is largely considered a political and diplomatic warfare targeting
China. It attempts to strengthen relations with US allies and other
emerging powers in the region, which would lead to a head-on competition
and even confrontation with China. This concerns not only exerting
regional influence and reshaping the regional strategic landscapes, but
also the possibility of involvement in territorial and maritime conflict
with China in the South and East China
Seas.[^17^](https://libproxy.library.unt.edu:2408/article/650100#f17)
Besides strengthening relations with US allies such as Japan, South
Korea, **\[End Page 69\]** Australia and other states in Southeast Asia,
the Obama administration is also working on partnership or cooperative
relations with India, Indonesia and other ASEAN countries including the
Philippines and Vietnam that have territorial and maritime disputes with
China. This is a new facet of the strategic rebalancing. The United
States' new relationship with India, as Donilon explained, is "one of
the defining partnerships of the twenty-first century...U.S. and Indian
interests powerfully converge in the Asia-Pacific, where India has much
to give and much to
gain".[^18^](https://libproxy.library.unt.edu:2408/article/650100#f18)
[There is no doubt that US efforts in modernising]{.underline} its
alliance system and reaching out to Asia's emerging powers will greatly
squeeze China's strategic space in the region, and curb the Chinese
influence earned from its "charm offensive" over the last 10 years. It
also signifies a dangerous game changer that places the United States in
a position that may [set off its involvement in conflict if]{.underline}
any [war breaks out between US allies and China.]{.underline}

#### China will use force if Trump continues with Taiwan

**Shepherd 17,** (Christian Shepherd is a journalist for Reuters,
January 15, 2017, "China will \'take off the gloves\' if Trump continues
on Taiwan, state media warns", Reuters,
<https://www.reuters.com/article/us-china-usa-trump-idUSKBN15001X>) DJ

BEIJING (Reuters) - [China will "take off the gloves" and take strong
action if U.S. President-elect Donald Trump continues to provoke Beijing
over Taiwan once he assumes office, two leading state-run newspapers
said on Monday. In an interview with the Wall Street Journal published
on Friday, Trump said the "One China" policy was up for negotiation.
China's foreign ministry, in response, said "One China" was the
foundation of China-U.S. ties and was non-negotiable.]{.underline} Trump
broke with decades of precedent last month by taking a congratulatory
telephone call from Taiwan President Tsai Ing-wen, angering Beijing,
which sees Taiwan as part of China. ["If Trump is determined to use this
gambit in taking office, a period of fierce, damaging interactions will
be unavoidable, as Beijing will have no choice but to take off the
gloves," the English-language China Daily said.]{.underline}
ADVERTISEMENT [The Global Times, an influential state-run tabloid,
echoed the China Daily, saying Beijing would take "strong
countermeasures" against Trump's attempt to "impair" the "One China"
principle. "The Chinese mainland will be prompted to speed up Taiwan
reunification and mercilessly combat those who advocate Taiwan's
independence," the paper said in an editorial]{.underline}. The Trump
transition team did not respond to Reuters' request for comment on the
Chinese articles. The Republican president-elect is sworn in on Friday.
[Chinese Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying said the United
States was clearly aware of China's position on "One
China."]{.underline} U.S. President-elect Donald Trump speaks during a
news conference in Trump Tower, Manhattan, New York, U.S., January 11,
2017. REUTERS/Shannon Stapleton "Any person should understand that in
this world there are certain things that cannot be traded or bought and
sold," she told a daily news briefing. ["The One China principle is the
precondition and political basis for any country having relations with
China." Hua added, "If anyone attempts to damage the One China principle
or if they are under the illusion they can use this as a bargaining
chip, they will be opposed by the Chinese government and
people.]{.underline} "In the end it will be like lifting a rock to drop
it on one's own feet," she said, without elaborating. The administration
of President Barack Obama has repeatedly reinforced the U.S. commitment
to the one China policy since Trump's call with the Taiwanese leader.
ADVERTISEMENT A senior Obama administration official said on Monday the
use of state media rather than a more formal statement or a speech
indicated the Chinese want Trump to know they are not "spoiling for a
fight, but are trying to warn him against provoking one that would end
badly for everyone." The situation may be more volatile than the
president-elect realizes, the official said Monday on the condition of
anonymity to avoid publicly criticizing Trump's remarks. Chinese
president Xi Jinping is concentrating more power in his own hands,
including command of the military, and increasingly invokes nationalism
as China tries to shift toward a domestic consumption-based economy from
an export-driven one, the official said. TAIWAN MAY BE "SACRIFICED" [The
Global Times said Trump's endorsement of Taiwan was merely a ploy to
further his administration's short term interests, adding: "Taiwan may
be sacrificed as a result of this despicable strategy."]{.underline} "If
you do not beat them until they are bloody and bruised, then they will
not retreat," Yang Yizhou, deputy head of China's government-run
All-China Federation of Taiwan Compatriots, told an academic meeting on
cross-straits relations in Beijing on Saturday. Taiwan President Tsai
Ing-wen smiles from her motorcade as she leaves to a meeting at Twitter
during a stop-over after her visit to Latin America in Burlingame,
California. REUTERS/Stephen Lam [Taiwan independence must "pay a cost"
for every step forward taken, "we must use bloodstained facts to show
them that the road is blocked," Yang said, according to a Monday report
on the meeting by the official People's Daily Overseas
Edition.]{.underline} T[he United States, which switched diplomatic
recognition from Taipei to Beijing in 1979, has acknowledged the Chinese
position that there is only "One China" and that Taiwan is part of
it.]{.underline} The China Daily said Beijing's relatively measured
response to Trump's comments in the Wall Street Journal "can only come
from a genuine, sincere wish that the less-than-desirable, yet
by-and-large manageable, big picture of China-U.S. relations will not be
derailed before Trump even enters office". But China should not count on
the assumption that Trump's Taiwan moves are "a pre-inauguration bluff,
and instead be prepared for him to continue backing his bet". ["It may
be costly. But it will prove a worthy price to pay to make the next U.S.
president aware of the special sensitivity, and serious consequences of
his Taiwan game," said the national daily.]{.underline}

[So-called friends of Taiwan in the United States are putting the island
at risk as never before. The Taiwan Travel Act, passed unanimously by
both houses of Congress, and
[signed](https://thediplomat.com/2018/03/the-taiwan-travel-act-in-context/)
by President Trump on March 16, 2018 without reservations, could gravely
erode the distinction between the United States' official relationship
with the People's Republic of China (P.R.C.) and its unofficial
relationship with Taiwan.]{.underline} The Taiwan Travel Act
[declares](https://www.congress.gov/bill/115th-congress/house-bill/535/text)
that "the United States Government should encourage visits between
officials from the United States and Taiwan at all levels," including
"Cabinet-level national security officials, general officers, and other
executive branch officials." These provisions are inconsistent with U.S.
commitments in a set of agreements known as the [Joint
Communiques](http://www.china-embassy.org/eng/zmgx/doc/ctc/), which
together with the [Taiwan Relations
Act](https://www.ait.org.tw/our-relationship/policy-history/key-u-s-foreign-policy-documents-region/taiwan-relations-act/)
provide the framework for the official relationship between Washington
and Beijing. Every U.S. president since the establishment of U.S.-P.R.C.
diplomatic relations in 1979, [including
Trump](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/02/09/world/asia/donald-trump-china-xi-jinping-letter.html),
has

this framework. Because of the U.S. pledge to maintain only unofficial
relations with the people of Taiwan, U.S. administrations have barred
senior U.S. government officials and military officers, especially those
with national security responsibilities, from visiting Taiwan. Failure
to abide by this decades-long practice would be inconsistent with the
U.S. pledge to maintain only unofficial relations with the people of
Taiwan, and would be an act of bad faith that would discredit the United
States [If the United States implements the Taiwan Travel Act in a
manner inconsistent with its traditional one-China policy, the principal
damage will be to Taiwan itself. Taiwan will experience reduced trade,
increased tensions, a heavier burden of military expenditures, and
poorer prospects.]{.underline} Moreover, Taiwan would compromise its
freedom of action on a key aspect of its own security, which is the
ability to calibrate the level of threat through careful management of
its relationship with mainland China. Unless wiser heads prevail, the
United States could unwittingly precipitate the most dangerous crisis
since the end of the Cold War. [To understand why the Taiwan Travel Act
is problematic, it's important to understand the one-China framework, a
legacy of the still not formally ended 1945-1949 Chinese Civil War.
Nationalist leader Chiang Kai-shek's flight from the mainland to Taiwan
in 1949 resulted in two competing Chinese governments, each claiming to
be the sole legitimate government of one China: the People's Republic of
China in Beijing, and the Republic of China in Taipei.]{.underline}
Foreign countries can only recognize one of the two governments as the
sole legal government of China, and only maintain embassies and
consulates in the territory controlled by the recognized Chinese
government. Relations with the unrecognized authorities have to be
conducted through unofficial entities, such as the American Institute in
Taiwan, the non-governmental organization that represents United States
interests on the island. In 1979, following U.S. recognition of the
People's Republic of China as the sole legal government of China,
Congress passed the Taiwan Relations Act, which has allowed the United
States to maintain a vibrant unofficial relationship with the island.
**[There Is Only One China, And There Is Only One
Taiwan](http://www.chinafile.com/reporting-opinion/viewpoint/there-only-one-china-and-there-only-one-taiwan)**
Over the decades, Taiwan itself has edged away from a one-China
framework. In 2016, the Taiwanese people elected a government that
pledged to maintain the status quo in cross-strait relations but that
[refused](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-taiwan-president/a-year-in-office-taiwans-tsai-seeks-beijings-goodwill-to-help-curb-anti-china-sentiment-idUSKCN18E3BF)
to repeat language affirming the one-China framework. In part, this
reflects shifting attitudes on the island[. Taiwan's population
increasingly identifies as Taiwanese rather than Chinese. Public opinion
surveys indicate that a growing majority of Taiwan residents
[favor](http://www.taipeitimes.com/News/front/archives/2016/05/31/2003647521)
independence over unification with China. However, because Beijing has
consistently asserted that it will use military force if necessary to
prevent Taiwan's separation from China, polls have consistently shown
that most Taiwanese [opt
for](https://www.brookings.edu/opinions/the-centrality-of-maintaining-the-status-quo-in-taiwan-elections/)
maintenance of the status quo over the dangers of an open quest for
independence.]{.underline} Meddling in this issue by the United States
is particularly sensitive from Beijing's standpoint. President-elect
Trump's
[unprecedented](http://www.chinafile.com/conversation/should-washington-recalibrate-relations-taipei)
telephone conversation with Taiwan President Tsai Ing-wen in December
2016, and his subsequent intimation that he might use the U.S.'s
traditional one-China policy as a bargaining chip with Beijing, set off
alarm bells in the Chinese capital. Following a spate of quiet but
intense diplomacy, the Trump administration confirmed that it would
abide by the traditional U.S. one-China policy, as set forth in the
Joint Communiques and the Taiwan Relations Act. This necessitates
continued maintenance of an unofficial relationship with Taiwan.
Tinkering with the one-China framework under these circumstances is a
recipe for disaster. At the 19th Party Congress in October 2017,
Communist Party Secretary Xi Jinping
[emphasized](http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/china/19thcpcnationalcongress/2017-11/04/content_34115212.htm)
that China "must uphold the principles of 'peaceful unification' and
'one country, two systems.'" And he stressed that China "will never
allow anyone, any organization, or any political party, at any time or
in any form, to separate any part of Chinese territory from China!" As
long as the one-China framework has remained intact, Beijing has shown
patience in waiting for "peaceful unification." This is important
because current trends do not favor early resolution of this issue.
**[Taiwan's China
Dilemma](http://www.chinafile.com/books/taiwans-china-dilemma)** China
and Taiwan share one of the world's most complex international
relationships. Although similar cultures and economic interests have
promoted an explosion of economic ties between them since the late
1980s, these ties have not led to an improved political relationship,
let alone progress toward the unification that both governments once
claimed to seek. In addition, Taiwan's recent Sunflower Movement
succeeded in obstructing deeper economic ties with China. Why has
Taiwan's policy toward China been so inconsistent?Taiwan's China Dilemma
explains the divergence between the development of economic and
political relations across the Taiwan Strait through the interplay of
national identity and economic interests. Using primary sources, opinion
surveys, and interviews with Taiwanese opinion leaders, Syaru Shirley
Lin paints a vivid picture of one of the most unsettled and dangerous
relationships in the contemporary world, and illustrates the growing
backlash against economic liberalization and regional economic
integration around the world. ---Stanford University Press Beijing's
concept of one country, two systems has never appealed to Taiwan. This
concept provides that unification of Hong Kong, Macau, and Taiwan with
mainland China would not alter their ability to preserve their own
respective political and economic systems. But since Hong Kong's 1997
reversion to the mainland, Beijing's application of the one country, two
systems concept to Hong Kong has not increased its attractiveness to
residents of Taiwan. Nor do they look with favor on the current effort
by the Party to tighten control over the lives of mainland China
citizens. [This is not the time to rock the boat. For nearly 40 years,
Taiwan has prospered in the shadow of mainland China. After adjusting to
the shock of the rupture of diplomatic relations with the United States
in 1979, Taiwan's far-sighted President Chiang Ching-kuo boldly began
opening up cross-strait relations with mainland China, liberalizing
Taiwan's political system, and shifting political power to the people.
Chiang's successors continued the process. The results have been
dramatic. Taiwan's
[exports](http://www.worldstopexports.com/taiwans-top-import-partners/)
to mainland China, including Hong Kong, are now over three times those
to the United States. Taiwan's per capita GDP of [nearly
\$50,000](https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/fields/2004.html#tw)
at purchasing power parity ranks just after Australia and ahead of
Denmark. The worries of Taiwan residents over being absorbed by mainland
China have been largely economic and social, not military.]{.underline}
**[Taiwan Needs to Hear Trump Say
'Democracy'](http://www.chinafile.com/viewpoint/taiwan-needs-hear-trump-say-democracy)**
Taiwan also has a unique global status. It is the only disputed
territory in the world that completely controls its domestic affairs. It
freely holds multi-party democratic elections, over which mainland China
exercises no control. It is a member of the World Trade Organization and
the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation forum. What it lacks is diplomatic
recognition by more than a handful of governments. Its desire for equal
status with independent countries in the international arena is
understandable, but this does not provide a compelling basis for actions
that could compromise the favorable position it now enjoys. [This
underlines the importance of avoiding actions that undermine the
one-China framework without adequate attention to the potential
consequences. There is a better way. The United States should maintain
the one-China policy that has served both it and Taiwan
well]{.underline}. The Taiwan Travel Act should be implemented in a
manner consistent with that framework. Blurring the distinction between
official and unofficial relations will damage U.S. credibility,
undermine Taiwan's future prosperity, and generate dangerous tensions.
Putting the future at risk is not good policy. In "Trump's Incredibly
Risky Taiwan Policy," Ambassador J. Stapleton Roy argues that the Taiwan
Travel Act puts Taiwan's future prosperity at risk and undercuts the
U.S. existing policy framework. His article, however, fails to mention
that long before the passage of this act Beijing had already increased
its aggressive rhetoric and shows of military might against Taiwan.
This---and not the Taiwan Travel Act---is the danger. We believe this
act reflects the robustness of U.S.-Taiwan relations, and that it could
be implemented in a constructive manner, based on the mutual trust
between the U.S. and Taiwan. When it comes to dealing with Beijing,
Taiwan has vowed to maintain the status quo and has pledged that it will
not turn to a path of confrontation. Taiwan's commitment to upholding
peace across the Taiwan Strait will not change. However, over the past
year, Chinese warplanes have conducted "island encirclement patrols"
around Taiwan numerous times, and launched flight routes in the Taiwan
Strait without any prior consultation with Taipei. Beijing also blocks
Taiwan's dignified and meaningful participation in the specialized
global agencies that are essential to its people's survival, such as the
World Health Organization and International Civil Aviation Organization.
These belligerent acts occurred even before the passage of the Taiwan
Travel Act, and they continue to persist. The Taiwan Travel Act
manifests U.S. commitment to maintaining peace and stability in East
Asia, and helps reaffirm Washington's broad and continuing support for
Taiwan. This helps boost Taiwan's confidence and willingness to continue
to exert maximum goodwill in order to safeguard the benign development
of cross-Strait relations. The Taiwan Travel Act also sends a clear
message to Beijing that aggressive behaviors only reinforce U.S.
commitment to the democratic Taiwan. As Ambassador Roy points out,
Taiwan has prospered under the shadow of mainland China over the past 40
years. Taiwan has been able to do so thanks in large part to the
flexibility of the U.S. policy framework. The Taiwan Travel Act adds to
that flexibility, and should be seen as an instrument that helps the
U.S. government better understand the political and security environment
in Taiwan[. In today's ever-complex international situation, it is far
more necessary to increase the opportunity for Taiwan and the U.S. to
engage with each other, to ensure not just peace in the Taiwan Strait,
but that of the entire region.]{.underline} J. Stapleton Roy, U.S.
Ambassador to China from 1991-1995, has condemned the Taiwan Travel Act
as provocative, and criticized its supporters as "so-called friends of
Taiwan." That label presumably applies to every member of the United
States Congress as well, since both the House and Senate passed the act
unanimously, and to President Donald Trump who signed it into law
without reservations. Roy objects to the act's call for "visits between
officials from the United States and Taiwan at all levels." He says the
law is inconsistent with the one-China framework under which Washington
recognized the People's Republic of China (P.R.C.) as the sole
government of that part of the original Republic of China called "the
Chinese mainland." When the Carter administration broke relations with
the remaining Republic of China on Taiwan in 1979, Congress immediately
passed the Taiwan Relations Act, mandating a healthy ongoing
relationship between Taiwan and the United States. Since then,
successive U.S. administrations have limited U.S.-Taiwan contacts to
lower-level officials. But circumstances have evolved significantly
since then, and Roy provides the historical context when he describes
the political situation on Taiwan after the change in diplomatic
relations: "Taiwan's far-sighted President Chiang Ching-kuo boldly began
opening up cross-strait relations with mainland China, liberalizing
Taiwan's political system, and shifting political power to the people.
Chiang's successors continued the process." [The Taiwanese people
struggled and sacrificed to achieve that political power and they have
exercised it by affirming their commitment to a democratic system. That
new reality clearly does not envision replacing the old yoke of
dictatorship with an even more oppressive one imposed by the Chinese
Communist Party.]{.underline} Roy concedes that Beijing's mistreatment
of Hong Kong under a "one country, two systems" formulation, and its
tightening control over the lives of Chinese citizens have "not
increased its attractiveness to residents of Taiwan." Indeed, he also
acknowledges that "a growing majority of Taiwan residents favor
independence over unification with China" and would choose "an open
quest for independence" were it not for Beijing's threat to use military
force in such a contingency. [But Roy fails to mention that the P.R.C.'s
official threat of force against Taiwan---the 2005 Anti-Secession
Law---goes well beyond a declaration of independence by Taiwan**. It
also claims a right to attack Taiwan if it simply takes too long to
accept "peaceful" unification.**]{.underline} Roy cites Communist Party
Secretary Xi Jinping's affirmation of Chinese designs on Taiwan. Yet,
his historical analysis does not recognize that the P.R.C.'s ongoing
threat of force undermines the very premise of Washington's diplomatic
switch. [The Taiwan Relations Act explicitly
[states](https://www.ait.org.tw/our-relationship/policy-history/key-u-s-foreign-policy-documents-region/taiwan-relations-act/)
that U.S. policy is "to make clear that the United States decision to
establish diplomatic relations with the P.R.C. rests upon the
expectation that the future of Taiwan will be determined by peaceful
means." Moreover, the other predicate of the initial U.S. policy has
also eroded. The Shanghai Communique
[stated](http://www.china-embassy.org/eng/zmgx/doc/ctc/t36255.htm)that
Washington "acknowledges that all Chinese on either side of the Taiwan
Strait maintain there is but one China and that Taiwan is a part of
China. The United States Government does not challenge that
position."]{.underline} If the statement ever reflected actual public
opinion in the P.R.C. and on Taiwan---rather than the view of *all
Chinese dictators*---it certainly is not true today. [Roy concludes:
"Putting the future at risk is not good policy." But that is exactly
what U.S. policymakers have done by not making clear to Beijing that
America will defend Taiwan's right to determine its own future. Now is
the time.]{.underline}

[As President Donald Trump continues to surround his administration with
people who -- when it comes to the issue of China -- will be nothing but
"yes men" who agree entirely with his administration's policies towards
Beijing. For someone who platformed his election campaign on ending
unnecessary wars and focusing more on making his country *"great
again,"* Donald J. Trump sure does voluntarily opt to appoint some of
the most hawkish people who exist in Washington's circles as part of his
advisory team]{.underline}. I could write an entire essay on this fact
alone, but the infamous past of the likes of John Bolton, Mike Pompeo
and Elliot Abrams is fast becoming common knowledge anyway. Trump's
latest warhawk, who appears all set to enter the fray which has to be
one of the most
[cursed](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2018/03/16/us/politics/all-the-major-firings-and-resignations-in-trump-administration.html)
administrations of all time, is Mark Esper, currently the Army's
civilian chief. Esper is Trump's favorite to lead the US military,
following the resignation of James 'Mad Dog' Mattis some time ago.
Apparently, no one is *"mad dog"* enough to keep up with Donald Trump.
[Esper has had a specific focus on China for decades (or so he says).
According to]{.underline}
[[Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-trump-esper-newsmaker/with-esper-pentagon-inherits-an-army-veteran-long-focused-on-china-idUSKCN1TJ30U),
Esper said he saw China as a personal priority as far back as the 1990s,
dating back to when he worked as an aide on Capitol Hill after serving
over ten years in the army.]{.underline} *"The issue of China,
competition with China, China's capabilities, is not a new one to me
\... That is both the foundation and the shaping of my views on these
various issues, because I've watched this evolution for 20 years now,"*
Esper said, further noting he was a Pacific war planner on the Army
staff, in the mid-1990s. So, what would a US military run by Esper look
like in the near future? Last year, at a Foreign Policy
[event](https://www.brookings.edu/blog/order-from-chaos/2018/06/25/secretary-mark-esper-and-the-future-of-the-u-s-army/)
at Brookings, Esper explained his vision for the future of the US
military moving forward. After explaining that his personal mantra is
*"the only way human beings can win a war is to prevent it ... the best
way to prevent a war is to be prepared to win it,"* Esper went on to
explain how -- in order to counter Russia and China -- the US military
would have to grow the regular army above 500,000 soldiers, among a host
of other things. It is worth noting at this point that Bolton himself is
also fond of quoting a similar ancient Roman battle philosophy
[being](https://theantimedia.com/bolton-china-russia/): *"if you want
peace, prepare for war"* (but I am sure this is just a coincidence).
*"One of the most dangerous places is high-intensity conflict. That\'s
where we could \[have\] a major war, and it would have a very
significant impact on the United States,"* Esper also recently
[told](https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/policy/defense-national-security/with-new-pentagon-chief-mark-esper-pompeo-gains-an-ally-in-west-point-classmate)
the Washington Examiner. *"So we have to build an army, a military, if
you will, that\'s capable of dealing with, again, Russia or China,
because we know that over the last 18 years as we focused on Iraq and
Afghanistan, the Russians and Chinese focused on modernizing their force
and trying to close the gap with the United States. That\'s what has our
attention right now."* [Despite this focus on China, it wouldn't be too
hard to determine where Esper's loyalties will ultimately lie in the
long run. In the not-so-distant past, Esper spent seven years as vice
president for government relations at defense contractor Raytheon --
where he]{.underline}
[[made]{.underline}](https://thehill.com/policy/defense/345619-trumps-army-secretary-pick-made-over-15m-at-raytheon)
[millions.]{.underline} In his soon-to-be confirmed role as defense
secretary, he is likely to have the ultimate
[decision](https://www.vox.com/world/2019/6/21/18701240/mark-esper-defense-secretary-pentagon-trump-nomination)
over which weapons the Pentagon buys. That being said, recently resigned
acting defense secretary Patrick Shanahan was a longtime executive at
Boeing -- further demonstrating how spoiled for choice America's
democracy really is. Esper also served in the 1991 Gulf War as an
infantry officer earning a Bronze Star, signalling that his entrenchment
within the US war machine runs almost as deep as one can go. Not to
mention that in 1986, he and Pompeo
[went](https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/policy/defense-national-security/with-new-pentagon-chief-mark-esper-pompeo-gains-an-ally-in-west-point-classmate)
through the US Military Academy together. Even in light of the
monumental legal
[hurdles](https://taskandpurpose.com/mark-esper-defense-secretary) that
should sit in Esper's way before he can technically take up the seat of
US defense secretary, it appears that Esper is already getting
first-hand exposure to the Trump administration. In fact, Esper was
allegedly at the White House last Thursday for
[meetings](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/21/us/politics/mark-esper-defense-secretary-nomination.html)
with the US president over how to respond to Iran's downing of a US
military drone. If the current US-Iran spat escalates further, we may be
witnessing a touch of what Esper will bring to the US foreign policy
establishment. News of Esper's nomination comes at the same time that
the US joint chiefs of staff announced a new nuclear
[doctrine](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/jun/19/nuclear-weapons-pentagon-us-military-doctrine)which
entails the Pentagon believing that using nuclear weapons could *"create
conditions for decisive results and the restoration of strategic
stability."* A nuclear operations doctrine published during the
administration of George W. Bush also helped pave the way for
pre-emptive nuclear strikes and the use of the US nuclear arsenal
against a widened range of targets. The Pentagon is also notably
expanding its rivalry with China to include a new arms race located in
space. In a new threat assessment of China's military, the Pentagon
cites "space" 86
[times](https://www.politico.com/story/2019/06/16/war-in-space-trump-china-1365842)
warning that the Chinese military is working on *"enabling long-range
precision strikes"* and developing directed-energy weapons for use in
outer space. For Beijing's part, a top Chinese major general who
co-authored a book entitled: Unrestricted Warfare: China's Master Plan
to Destroy America has
[warned](https://www.scmp.com/news/china/military/article/3014692/are-china-and-us-racing-towards-inevitable-military)
that US leaders preparing for an arms race in space should be prepared
to lose. *"China is not the Soviet Union,"* he said in an interview with
the South China Morning Post (SCMP). *"If the United States thinks it
can also drag China into an arms race and take down China as it did with
the Soviets ... in the end, probably it would not be China who is down
on the ground."* [At the end of the day, if the US wanted to avoid a
conflict with a nuclear power like China, one would have to envision
that it could at least take more precautionary measures to avert such a
catastrophe. Refraining from nominating people like Esper, who are to
work closely alongside established warhawks like John Bolton and Mike
Pompeo, would be a good start in this direction. While not often talked
about, Bolton has been a big]{.underline}
[[advocate](https://theantimedia.com/bolton-china-russia/) for pushing

Beijing's One China policy on Taiwan, a move which could also

As director of programme planning at the Secure World Foundation Brian
Weeden astutely
[noted](https://www.politico.com/story/2019/06/16/war-in-space-trump-china-1365842):
*"one of my biggest concerns is that for all the talk about how horrible
an armed conflict with China would be for everyone, all the current
policies and actions seem to be preparing for armed conflict instead of
avoiding it."* However, avoiding conflict is just simply not on Esper's
agenda. But don't take my word for it: *"My first priority will be
readiness -- ensuring the total Army is prepared to fight across the
full spectrum of conflict,"*
Esper[said](https://www.armed-services.senate.gov/imo/media/doc/Esper_11-02-17.pdf)
before the Senate Armed Services Committee in November 2017. *"With the
Army engaged in over 140 countries around the world, to include combat
operations in Afghanistan and Iraq, training rotations to Europe to
deter Russia, and forward deployed units in the Pacific defending
against a bellicose North Korea, readiness must be our top priority.\"*

How important is the Taiwan Strait? How dangerous is that area? [It is
potentially very dangerous. One of the things that we picked up on our
delegation in August when we were in China,is the constant theme from
them that \"This is important to us. Taiwan is important to us. We
don\'t want to wait forever. We want unification.\" And it\'s difficult
for the average American to understand why something like that could be
so important and why a little small place like Taiwan would be so
important to the PRC. But the fact of the matter is, it is true, it is
real, it is very important, and therefore very dangerous. So our policy
there has to be has to be sophisticated and very
courageous.]{.underline} I\'m glad that we\'ve got people like George
Bush and Colin Powell and Rumsfeld and Dick Cheney and people like that
on the job, quite frankly, [because I think that our relationship with
China over the next few decades is probably the single most important
issue facing our country.]{.underline} Why is that? [Because of the
potential threats, misunderstandings and conflict that we have there
\... right now, they pose the greatest potential. Hopefully, we can
build bridges, but we also have to draw lines. And when we draw lines in
the sand with regard to certain basic things that are vital to our
interest and to the interest of democracy and our friends around the
world, we have to be willing to back that up. If you\'re willing to back
it up, there is potential danger; there is potential
conflict.]{.underline} From your knowledge, can you give me a picture of
their military forces opposite Taiwan? [We know that they have 300-plus
missiles along the coast there, pointed toward Taiwan. And we know that
they\'re doing training exercises on those islands in the Strait. We
know, for example, that they\'re using American ships and submarines as
enemies in their training exercises]{.underline}. And they know that we
know that; they\'re sending a signal to us; they\'re sending a signal to
Taiwan. They\'re going to wait and see how we react to all of that. But
it\'s not like that there\'s any particular buildup right now. \...
It\'s what the potential there is over the next few years, and then over
the next several years. Could it just be a bargaining chip to make
America and Taiwan listen? Could be, could be. But when you\'re playing
poker, you don\'t know the answer to that until after the cards are laid
down, and then it\'s too late[. So if you look back over the long
history of China, they\'ve never tried to take over the world, but
they\'ve been quite aggressive in their own neighborhood \... in
carrying out their own purposes and interests in their sphere of the
world.]{.underline}

\...Why do you not renounce your use of force \[against Taiwan\]? \...
[I know there are people in the United States who use China\'s failure
to renounce the use of force against Taiwan as an excuse for the U.S. to
support Taiwan and sell arms to Taiwan. But their arguments cannot hold
water. Can I just say that that gives the impression to the Americans
that China is a bully]{.underline}? It is a threatening power. It\'s a
communist power which is threatening a small, tiny island. That, for an
American, is a very disturbing prospect. [Your impression]{.underline},
if you will permit me to say so[, is totally wrong. It suggests that the
United States is very keen on a peaceful solution to the Taiwan issue,
while mainland China wants to use military force. I think this is a
misunderstanding which gives a totally wrong impression.]{.underline}
[Actually, no one in the world is more eager than China to find a
peaceful solution to the Taiwan question. We have always advocated
peaceful reunification on the principle of one China, two
systems]{.underline}. Even after the tremendous changes last year in
Taiwan, we still advocate this principle, and hope to try our best to
seek a peaceful solution to the Taiwan question. This is our basic
principle and it has remained unchanged. [It is just because we want to
solve the Taiwan question peacefully that we cannot give up the use of
force. If we give up the use of force, that will only make a peaceful
solution impossible. For instance, if the Taiwan separatists declare
Taiwan independent, then how do we react? \...]{.underline} Furthermore,
it\'s entirely China\'s own internal affair if we deploy military
equipment on our own soil. If they do declare independence, what will
China\'s response be? \...[The key thing at the moment is that the
leaders of the Taiwan government do not adequately recognize the
one-China principle. They deny the 1992 oral understanding between us,
which states that the two sides of the Taiwan Strait should both use
oral expression to maintain the principle of one China. Actually, if the
Taiwan leader can acknowledge the one-China principle, and recognize the
1992 consensus, then talks across the Taiwan Strait can be resumed
immediately]{.underline}. However, if he\'s bent on having his own way,
and denies the principle of one China \-- or even goes as far as what
you said and declares independence \-- then our answer is very
clear-cut. We will not allow it to happen. [The final solution of the
Taiwan question and the ultimate reunification of the motherland is in
the common interest of the people of China \-- that is the 1.3 billion
Chinese people, including those on Taiwan Island. No force can stand in
the way of this.]{.underline} If the leadership in Taiwan declared
independence, you say you could not let that happen. The U.S. Defense
Department worries that if that did happen, your response would be to
use the many missiles you have got along the coast opposite Taiwan, and
that would be much more devastating than the bombardment of the islands
that happened in the 1950s, 1960s and 1970s. Is that the sort of
response you would have? [I have made our stand quite clear: Taiwanese
independence is equal to war. That\'s why the United States should not
support this movement; should not support independence for Taiwan. We,
the two sides, should make joint efforts to achieve a peaceful
settlement of the Taiwan issue.]{.underline}

Ultimately, the efªcacy of U.S. deterrence depends on Chinese interests.
Is China deterrable, or is it so dissatisªed with the status quo that it
is prepared to adopt high-risk policies to secure its objectives? Since
1949, when the Republic of China (ROC) leadership moved to Taiwan and
the PRC was established[, Taiwan has enjoyed de facto independence from
the mainland. Within the diplomatic cover of the "one-China principle,"
according to which the PRC and the ROC agreed that Taiwan was part of
China, Beijing has tolerated the status quo.]{.underline} Despite
China's interest in reversing the "humiliation" of Western and Japanese
imperialism and ending foreign interference in its domestic affairs,
Washington has successfully deterred Beijing from challenging the status
quo. Rather than go to war for uniªcation, [Chinese leaders have pursued
higher-value interests, including ideological objectives under Mao
Zedong and economic modernization under Deng Xiaoping and his
successors. China's tolerance of the status quo does not preclude it
from taking action if Taiwan were to challenge the status quo. Since the
mid-1990s, Taipei has adopted a series of measures suggesting to Beijing
that a secessionist movement is under way on Taiwan. For China, a formal
Taiwan declaration of independence would be the equivalent of a
declaration of war. It would challenge the nationalist legitimacy of the
Chinese Communist Party (CCP), which is based on erasing the humiliation
of past imperialist invasions]{.underline}. Thus as one observer has
noted, "no Chinese politician, strategist, or anyone else will dare to
abandon the objective of making Taiwan return and the uniªcation of the
motherland."17 Moreover, [Taiwan independence would increase the
likelihood that Taiwan could be used by a rival power to threaten PRC
security, much way that the United States used Taiwan in the 1950s in
its "containment" of China]{.underline}. The island is both the
"protective shield" (pingzhang) and the "strategic gateway" (suoyue) to
southeast China.[18 Chinese leaders also have a credibility problem.
Should Beijing fail to retaliate against a Taiwan declaration of
independence, secessionist movements in Tibet, Xinjiang, and other parts
of China could be emboldened to escalate their resistance to Chinese
rule.19]{.underline} For some observers, the issue is whether advances
in China's military capabilities have undermined the credibility of the
U.S. retaliatory threat just as Beijing is becoming increasingly
apprehensive that developments in Taiwan could lead to a declaration of
independence.20 Thus, to deter China from using force in a bid for
uniªcation, the United States requires both the military capability and
the credibility to pose an unacceptable expected cost to Beijing of U.S.
intervention.

Thus, a Chinese missile-based fait accompli strategy might be able to
wreak havoc in Taiwan, but Beijing cannot have high conªdence that it
would cause the government of Taiwan to accede to even symbolic
political uniªcation. [If Taiwan did not surrender, the ensuing
humiliation would devastate the CCP's legitimacy and signiªcantly
undermine it staying power. If Taiwan fought back, using its superior
air power to damage the Chinese navy and air force and to ªght the
mainland to a draw, the humiliation would be even
greate]{.underline}r.87 Should Chinese leaders then decide that they had
no choice but to prosecute a long-term war for uniªcation, the CCP would
face an even greater likelihood of U.S. intervention, military defeat,
domestic humiliation, and collapse. Chinese missiles and aircraft may be
a powerful deterrent, and a fait accompli strategy might be China's only
recourse should deterrence fail and Taiwan declare independence, but it
is not a reliable instrument of coercive warfare. [China faces a high
expected cost of use of force that deters it from using a fait accompli
strategy to challenge the status quo.]{.underline}

One of the most significant developments at China\'s 17th Party Congress
was what did not happen. In contrast to past party congresses, China\'s
Taiwan policy has been a non-issue this year, apparently unaffected by
the intense political jockey in the months preceding the Congress and
during the congress itself. This moderation in China\'s Taiwan policy
does not suggest that Chinese leaders have moved beyond the Taiwan
issue, that they understand that economics is more important than
national sovereignty. [Although Chinese business leaders, particularly
in Shanghai and in other coastal cities, prefer that China focus on
economic growth, rather than on preparations for war against Taiwan,
Chinese party leaders in Beijing remain fixated on Taiwan. **Taiwan is
the foremost symbol of Chinese nationalism. Taiwan\'s independence
movement challenges China\'s nationalist agenda of reversing the
humiliations of the imperialists by unifying lost territories. It also
threatens the nationalist legitimacy of the Chinese Communist
Party.**]{.underline} Moreover, China has a vital security interest in
Taiwan, a small island 90 miles from its coast (think Cuba). [For all of
these reasons, Taiwan has been an issue of war and peace for China that
continues to challenge U.S. cooperation and remains a political
vulnerability for Chinese leaders.]{.underline} Chinese moderation is
all the more remarkable, given the series of provocations from Chen
Shui-bian, Taiwan\'s leader. Over the past year, Chen has all but
declared formal Taiwan sovereign independence from mainland China. His
speech on Oct. 10, just prior to the opening of the Party Congress, was
particularly provocative. Chen Shui-bian has not only riled Beijing\--he
has displeased the Bush Administration, as well. Despite U.S. security
cooperation with Taiwan and American support for Taiwan\'s democracy,
state department officials have publicly criticized Chen\'s initiatives,
and the White House no longer urges Beijing to negotiate with Chen, but
rather encourages China to look forward to cooperation with Chen\'s
successors. The White House has also praised China\'s moderate response
to Chen\'s provocations. In the past, China would have responded to such
Taiwan provocations with combative rhetoric, deadlines for unification
and military threats. Over the past year, however, including during the
weeks leading up to the party congress, China has exercised considerable
restraint. Its propaganda machine has yet to turn its full attention on
Taiwan, and the Chinese military has been content to carry out its
routine annual exercises. In his speech to the party congress, Hu Jintao
offered to open peace talks with Taiwan. [These novel developments in
Chinese politics point to the growing sophistication of Chinese
policy-making and the awareness among Chinese leaders that short-term
Taiwan provocations are a mere prelude to long-term stability, and that
it is better for China to wait for political change on Taiwan than to
adopt policies that can only benefit Chen Shui-bian and undermine
Chinese cooperation with the United States and other
countries.]{.underline}

[Given the Taiwan issue and relations among China, the United States,
and Japan over it, the security dilemma does indeed apply to East Asia,
and in a particularly knotty way.10 China's stated goal of reunification
with Taiwan, when accompanied by the threat of violence to achieve this
objective, appears revisionist and irredentist to many regional and
global observers]{.underline}. Nev- ertheless, largely for reasons of
history and domestic politics, Beijing also has defensive motivations:
PRC leaders fear Taiwan's permanent independence from the Chinese
nation. Leaders in Beijing consider deterring that outcome a defensive
strategy because, at least until the early 1990s, leadership circles
both in Taipei and in Beijing had recognized Taiwan, in some abstract
sense, as part of a Chinese nation, whether that nation was designated
the PRC or the Republic of China (ROC). Only since the early 1990s have
top officials in Taipei, starting with former president Lee Teng-hui,
begun calling such a formula into question. [Preventing Taiwan's
permanent separation from the mainland and fostering eventual
unification are core goals of all Chinese nationalists. But the overall
objective is particularly important for today's Chinese Com- munist Pa
rty (CCP), which faces severe domestic legitimacy problems because the
PRC's Communist regime rules over a country in which very few people
believe in com- munism. **Moreover, CCP elites fear that dramatic
failure on Taiwan policy would allow currently disparate domestic
opposition groups to link with each other and with disgruntled
nationalists within the party in a manner that could threaten the
party's monopoly on power.** Because relations with Taiwan affect
domestic stability, success or failure on the Taiwan issue will likely
be a key standard by which CCP lead- ers' peers will judge individual
party leaders' acumen on the international stage, during the leadership
transition currently under way in China.]{.underline} That being said,
economic growth and job creation are also critical to the stability of
the regime in China. The goals of economic growth and nation- alism
sometimes pull Beijing in opposite directions. Good economic policy
requires further foreign penetration of the Chinese economy and positive
relations with the United States, Taiwan, and Japan---China's three
biggest economic partners---whereas nationalist posturing in military
and economic policy could easily injure relations with those major
trading and investment partners. An attack against Taiwan would risk not
only military disaster but also prolonged alienation of China's economic
partners. Beijing may be willing to fight over Taiwan even against
militarily superior foes, but it is hardly eager to do so. Thus,
deterrence is possible, but not simple.

#### **It's a matter of political identity, not territorial expansion**

[To a large degree, the Taiwan question is one more of the island's
political identity than of the PRC's territorial expansion. The danger
to the PRC is that Taiwan might eventually move from de facto
independence to le- gal independence, thus **posing an affront to
Chinese nationalism and a danger to regime stability in Beijing.**
Little evidence suggests that the PRC would like to occupy Taiwan and
run the island's day-to-day affairs, even if it could.]{.underline}

### AT: No Chinese Instability 

#### Preventing Taiwan independence is key to preventing the historical tragedy of a divided China 

**Lanoszka 18, (**Alexander Lanoszka is Assistant Professor of

Posture", Center for Security Policy Studies) DJ

There are at least two potential problems with this line of reasoning[.
The first is that President Xi appears to have taken a significant step
towards effectively consolidating control shortly after we left Taiwan
in early January 2018.]{.underline} Specifically, in March 2018, he
removed the ten-year term limit that has constrained every Paramount
Leader since Mao. No longer shackled by term limits, the already
consistent and relatively shockproof policies of the CCP are likely to
gain even more consistency under a potential "dictator-for-life." Such a
development does not bode well for Taiwan. [Although he pursued
rapprochement towards Taiwan early in his tenure as leader, President Xi
toughened his stance towards the island following the 2016 election of
pro-independence Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) candidate Tsai
Ing-Wen. At the 19th Party Congress, he articulated that China will:
"... resolutely uphold national sovereignty and territorial integrity
and **will never tolerate a repeat of the historical tragedy of a
divided country.** All activities of splitting the motherland will be
resolutely opposed by all the Chinese people. **We have firm will, full
confidence, and sufficient capability to defeat any form of Taiwan
independence secession plot. We will never allow any person, any
organization, or any political party to split any part of the Chinese
territory from China at any time or in any form."**]{.underline}78 Since
consolidating power, President Xi has indeed increased the pressure on
Taiwan. For example, China recently enacted 31 new policies designed to
attract more Taiwan citizens to China."79 After the U.S. Congress passed
the U.S.-Taiwan Travel Bill in March 2018, China retorted that the
legislation "severely violates the one-China principle, the political
foundation of the ChinaU.S. relationship."80 Moreover, PLA
warships---including the aircraft carrier have been circling Taiwan and
traversing the Strait itself.81 Military exercises have also been taken
place more frequently in the region and across the Strait. China has
stepped up efforts to restrict Taiwan's international space by flipping
diplomatic allegiances and barring attendance at international events.
[There is a second problem with placing too much faith in President Xi's
need to prioritize his domestic power base. It overlooks the possibility
that he might use provocations abroad as a way to consolidate control at
home.82 Autocratic leaders have often relied on adventurism abroad to
undercut political competition, distract domestic audiences, and rally
public opinion.]{.underline} War has a long and distinguished role in
the state-building process.83 It is worth pointing out that President Xi
may well be publicly telegraphing his long-range plans. He has, after
all, put his reform goals and timeline on record for all to see: by
2020, the PLA will achieve its basic mechanization goals, make strides
in the information domain, and improve its strategic capabilities
substantially; by 2035, it will be a completely modernized military; and
by 2050, it will possess first-class military forces. Several of these
new platforms have already been deployed near Taiwan. Having a
"first-class military" deadline not only provides a warning to the
United States and other countries but also conveys his expectations to
other political, economic, social, and military elites in China.
Nevertheless, as with the 2005 Anti-Secession Law, the target may be
painted and the red lines are drawn, but mobilization toward ends might
not be immediately forthcoming. China's calculus on whether to launch an
attack on Taiwan will largely depend on the factors described above.

#### A unified China is key to an overall Chinese unity 

**Lanoszka 18, (**Alexander Lanoszka is Assistant Professor of
International Relations at the University of Waterloo. Previously, he
taught at City, University of London and has held fellowships at the
Massachusetts Institute of Technology and Dartmouth College, November

Posture", Center for Security Policy Studies) DJ

[International and domestic political factors might also explain changes
in self-reported identity over time. Yang Zhong contends that the
growing salience of national identity stems not from a rejection of
Chinese culture but rather from **a rejection of China's CCP-dominated
government**]{.underline}.227 Alternatively, domestic politics might
play a larger role. As Professor Arthur Ding points out, more people
identified as Taiwanese when President Ma Ying-jeou and the KMT were in
power. By contrast, those numbers began to drop when President Tsai
Ing-wen and the Democratic Progressive Party came to power in 2016.228
Thus, it may be the case that people in Taiwan base their sense of
national identity, at least in part, on their perceptions about who is
in power and how they perform.

[From the perspective of effective deterrence, it is a problem if
**people shift their sense of national identity based on their
frustration with the government's performance.** If domestic politics
truly drive identity decisions, then political leaders and defense
planners will **experience more challenges leveraging national identity
as a unifying force.** To be sure, national identity might not be a good
predictor for an individual's willingness to fight. But it surely helps
develop national cohesion.]{.underline} Identity trends might also
impact China's decision-making. Some claim that the more Taiwan's
society identifies as Chinese, the more China's leaders will use
peaceful tools. [Conversely, the more China's leaders perceive a
persistent, possibly irreversible decline in Chinese identity within
Taiwan, the more they might adopt more provocative policies on
cross-Straits issues]{.underline}.229 It is worth noting that a recent
survey conducted by the Taiwan Foundation for Democracy found that
roughly two-thirds of respondents said that they would be willing to go
to war if China were to attempt a forceful unification of Taiwan.230
That number drops to 55% if Taiwan were to declare unilateral
independence.

[The Chinese Communist Party\'s power has long rested on four pillars:
economic growth, nationalism, repression and communist
ideology.]{.underline} The last of these withered away almost entirely
as China liberalized its economy, with slogans such as \"Long live the
invincible Marxism-Leninism theory\" replaced by \"To get rich is
glorious.\" Now the first pillar is unstable too. [All eyes are on the
gyrating Chinese stock market.]{.underline} [Its precipitous decline and
the surprise devaluation of the renminbi have been roiling world markets
and stoking fears of currency wars]{.underline} and beggar-thy-neighbor
trade policies. Given that only about 1% of our gross domestic product
comes from trade with China, the U.S. economy is hardly at risk. Yet
this summer\'s upheaval may accelerate developments that threaten the
peace of Asia and pose a strategic challenge to the West. [China\'s
economy has been slowing for a while. In this century\'s first decade,
10%-plus returns were the norm; lately the growth rate has hovered
around 7]{.underline}% --- if official figures are to be trusted, which
they are not. The Chinese people have begun to feel the effects, and so
has the government, with its reputation for sound economic stewardship
declining in parallel with the downward-sloping GDP growth charts.
[Xi]{.underline} Jinping came to power in 2012 determined to burnish the
leadership\'s credentials in this all-critical area. His [efforts have
taken two forms. The first has been an anti-corruption
campaign]{.underline} that plays to popular sentiments but has doubled
as a vehicle for a purge of political opponents. Three years into the
campaign, China\'s president has a large number of very bitter and
well-placed enemies, whose family fortunes and lives are on the line. At
the same time, [[Xi has been searching]{.mark} for ways [to reinvigorate
China\'s economy]{.mark}.]{.underline} One measure he embraced was to
talk up the stock market, which he promised the Chinese people would
create both personal and national wealth. [Almost right up to the
initial tremors heralding this summer\'s crash, state-run news outlets
were urging the population to buy stocks]{.underline}. As the Chinese
market soared, this may have seemed to Xi\'s colleagues in the Politburo
as a stroke of genius; millions of people were getting rich on paper,
and the Communist Party was getting the credit for it. It now must
appear to them --- and to an entire class of unhappy investors --- as a
monumental act of maladministration. 10,000 Syrian refugees isn\'t
enough --- the U.S. should admit more 10,000 Syrian refugees isn\'t
enough --- the U.S. should admit more Having lost ideological purity and
economic stewardship as claims to power, the party is left, at least for
the time being, with repression and nationalism. Accordingly, [[Xi has
cracked down on dissent]{.mark} with renewed vigor, sweeping up
democracy advocates, environmentalists, lawyers, champions of minority
group rights and anyone else who gets out of line]{.underline}.
Simultaneously, [[he\'s intensified a campaign to bolster]{.mark}
internal [support by riling China\'s neighbors]{.mark}]{.underline},
particularly the hated Japanese. In the last three years, [[China
has]{.mark} unilaterally [declared]{.mark} [an
air-defense-identification zone over]{.mark} i[slands]{.mark} also
[claimed by Japan, deployed oil rigs off]{.mark} the coast [of
Vietnam]{.mark} and [built]{.mark} an assortment of fortified
[artificial islands]{.mark} at strategic locations around the South
China Sea]{.underline}. [China\'s actions have created alarm in capitals
across Asia \[and have\] encouraged regional cooperation in an effort to
contain the increasingly menacing tiger]{.underline}. [These actions
have created alarm in capitals across Asia, provoked military buildups
and even encouraged regional cooperation in an effort to contain the
increasingly menacing tiger.]{.underline} China\'s bellicosity may
ultimately prove self-defeating as a national security strategy. Indeed,
[Chinese conduct appears inexplicable without reference to its domestic
sources]{.underline}. The [[costs of antagonism]{.mark} [are]{.mark}
evidently [offset by]{.mark} the internal [benefits]{.mark}]{.underline}
for Xi and the party\'s grip on power. Some [observers]{.underline}
perceive a silver lining in China\'s difficulties[,
believ]{.underline}ing that [a country preoccupied with internal
problems will be less aggressive and require fewer diplomatic, economic
and military resources to hold it in check. That is wishful
thinking]{.underline} rooted in a radical misreading of China\'s
domestic political dynamics. Prospects for conflict around China\'s
periphery and beyond are likely to rise commensurately with the scope of
the Communist Party\'s internal crisis. [It is not an accident that this
month [China dared to send its navy into U.S. territorial waters]{.mark}
next to Alaska, something it had never before attempted]{.underline}.
Even with the much-vaunted but underresourced \"pivot\" to Asia, the
United States was ill-prepared to meet the challenge of preserving peace
in the Pacific. [Now the danger we face is growing steadily. The
[anxieties]{.mark} [plaguing China\'s leaders,]{.mark} in place for
decades, [are fueling the belligerence of a rising]{.mark} power; the
stock market fiasco, coming on the heels of an economic slowdown, has
turned a scratch into gangrene.]{.underline}

#### Reduced legitimacy causes the CCP to [embrace nationalism]{.underline}\-\--that causes existing territorial disputes to escalate to armed conflict

University of San Diego, B.A. in Political Science from Villanova

Perhaps [[the most]{.underline}]{.mark} reasonable and [[likely
path]{.mark} the [CCP]{.mark} will [pursue to]{.mark}]{.underline}
[[shore up]{.mark} its [legitimacy]{.mark}]{.underline} [[is]{.mark} by
[embracing nationalism]{.mark}]{.underline}. There is a lot for the
Chinese to be proud of these days. They are a country that has risen
from the ashes of the Cultural Revolution to become the second largest
economy in the world. Most of the people of China no longer live a life
of subsistence, but one of material wealth. Many Chinese can now afford
things that were once considered luxury items such as televisions and
cars. China has firmly established itself as an economic power. China is
now not only economically strong, but also politically and militarily
strong on the international stage. After many years of subjugation,
exploitation, and humiliation at the hands of foreign powers China is
now a strong nation. China is powerful enough now to defend its borders
against any potential threat. Increasingly, China is also able to flex
its muscles beyond its own borders and territorial waters as exemplified
by China's recent establishment of an Air Defense Identification Zone
(ADIZ) over the disputed Senkaku/Diaoyu islands in the East China Sea.
[China's ability to project power is quickly catching up
with]{.underline} potential rivals such as [Japan and the United
States]{.underline}.¶ The use of nationalism to support regime
legitimacy is not a new concept for the CCP. Since the late 1970s the
CCP have been cultivating nationalism as a way to compensate for the
weaknesses of communist ideology. After the turmoil of the Cultural
Revolution and the "sanxin weiji" (three spiritual crises) the CCP
started using nationalism as a way to establish a hegemonic order of
political values and as a way to rally popular support behind a less
popular regime and its policies by creating a sense of community. The
CCP double downed on using nationalism as a way to unite the country and
reinforce its legitimacy after the Tiananmen Square protests in the
spring of 1989. Nationalism was viewed as a way to counter Western
liberal ideas and calls for democracy. As the CCP did after the protest
of 1989 and continues to do today, the party continues to sell itself as
the protector of the Chinese people against foreign aggression. If the
CCP were to allow weakness, disunity, and disorder at home it would open
a Pandora's box. Such chaos would weaken China and give foreign
aggressors the chance to reassert themselves. With China's history of
foreign exploitation, such an argument can carry a lot of weight in
China. China is once again a strong country and it does not want to fall
back into a role of subjugation.xxiii¶ The problem with nationalism is
it is a fickle beast. [[If the CCP were to]{.mark} strongly embrace and
[stoke nationalism, it would be hard to contain]{.mark}]{.underline} it.
If [the CCP]{.underline} were to define itself as the guardians of
Chinese nationalism it [would have to work]{.underline} hard [to ensure
it appeases the concerns of nationalist. China continues to
have]{.underline} a number of [[festering territory disputes
with]{.mark} its neighbors:]{.underline} the continued de facto
independence of [[Taiwan]{.underline}]{.mark}, its border with [[India,
and the Senkaku]{.underline}]{.mark}/Diaoyu [islands]{.underline} in the
East China Sea to name a few. With its history of foreign exploitation,
China is acutely sensitive to any territory dispute. [The [CCP would
have a]{.mark} very [hard time maintaining]{.mark}]{.underline} its
[[nationalist credentials if it]{.mark} were to [allow other countries
to assert control]{.mark} over any]{.underline} of the [disputed
areas]{.underline}. The Chinese leaders ran into this problem in the
late 1990s when there was a distinct rise in nationalism in China. The
authors of the popular [[nationalist]{.underline}]{.mark} book The China
That Can Say No were openly critical of the Chinese government for
taking a stance they viewed as too soft towards the United States and
Japan. They [[endorsed]{.mark} taking action to annex
Taiwan]{.underline} at any cost [and]{.underline} [open [confrontation
with Japan and the]{.mark}]{.underline} [[U]{.underline}]{.mark}nited
[[S]{.underline}]{.mark}tates. A move such as this would at best be
risky considering China was, and still is, dependent on Japan and the
United States to ensure its continued economic growth.xxiv¶ As a result
of China's history of humiliation and the CCP's need to strengthen its
nationalist credentials, [China is more likely than other countries to
use]{.underline} strong-arm tactics or [force to assert
itself.]{.underline} [Such moves are a double-edged sword]{.underline}
for the CCP. [They]{.underline} could [help the CCP]{.underline} to
[maintain]{.underline} its [credentials as the guardians of the Chinese
people]{.underline}, but this would be [at the expense of]{.underline}
hurting its standing in the international community, or worse, [sending
China on path towards armed conflict.]{.underline} [[When military
units]{.mark} of opposing countries [are]{.mark} in [close]{.mark}
proximity]{.underline} to each other [[and tensions]{.mark} run [high,
it can be]{.mark}]{.underline} very [[difficult to prevent]{.mark} acts
of [aggression from spilling over into armed
conflict.]{.mark}]{.underline} [[Posturing]{.mark} on one side [can be
viewed as]{.mark} an [imminent]{.mark} intent to
[attack]{.mark}]{.underline} on the other. China will have to balance a
fine line to ensure their actions are not viewed as too soft at home or
overly aggressive by the international community. If the CCP relies
heavily on nationalism to strengthen its legitimacy and it is viewed too
soft at home, it will hurt the staying power of the regime. [If China is
viewed as too aggressive by its neighbors, it could face]{.underline}
reduced foreign investment, sanctions, or worse, [armed
conflict]{.underline}. All of which would also hurt the economic growth
of China and as a result damage the legitimacy of the regime.

[[Should the CCP undergo]{.mark} some sort of [dramatic
transformation]{.mark}]{.underline} -- whether that be significant
reform or complete collapse, as some radical China scholars predict2 --
[[the implications for international and US national security are
vast]{.underline}. [Not only does]{.underline}]{.mark} [China and the
[stability of the CCP play a significant role in]{.mark} the maintenance
[of peace in the East Asian region, but China is]{.mark} also [relied
upon by]{.mark} many [members of the international community for
foreign]{.mark} direct [investment, economic stability and
trade.]{.mark}]{.underline} [[China plays a key role in maintaining
stability on the Korean Peninsula]{.underline}]{.mark} as one of North
Korea's only allies, and it is argued that [instability within the
Chinese government could also lead to instability in the already
sensitive military [and]{.mark} political situation across the
[Taiwan]{.mark} Strait]{.underline}. For the United States, [[the effect
of instability within the CCP would be widespread]{.mark} and
dramatic.]{.underline} [As the United States' largest holder of US
treasury securities, instability or [collapse of the CCP could threaten
the stability of the already volatile economic situation in the
US]{.mark}]{.underline}. In addition, [China is the largest trading
partner of a number of countries, including the US, and the US is
reliant upon its market of inexpensive goods to feed demand within the
US.]{.underline}

It is with this in mind that China scholars within the United States and
around the world should be studying this phenomenon, because the
potential for reform, [instability or]{.underline} even [collapse of
th[e CCP is of critical importance to the stability of the international
order]{.mark} as a whole]{.underline}. For the United States
specifically, the potential - or lack thereof - for reform of the CCP
should dictate its foreign policy toward China. If the body of knowledge
on the stability of the Chinese government reveals that the Chinese
market is not a stable one, it is in the best interests of the United
States to look for investors and trade markets elsewhere to lessen its
serious dependence on China for its economic stability, particularly in
a time of such uncertain economic conditions within the US.

China has long been a country with three of the most malleable
attributes required for membership in the "great power club". [China
enjoys vast territory, rich resources and a very large
population]{.underline}. However it has been, for decades, "a sleeping
giant" who's potential was not realized until it embarked on an
ambitious program of economic reforms and modernization in the late
1970s (Jones 2000). Since then China has awoken from her slumber and as
Napoleon once predicted now "astonishes the world". [Few nations have
changed so fast or as dramatically as China has since the
1970s]{.underline}. Lardy \[9\] asserts that prior to the late 1970s,
China was barely a participant in the world capital markets. She was not
a borrower either in the international commercial markets or from
international financial organizations such as the World Bank, did not
receive foreign aid from bilateral development agencies or private
foreign direct investment and did not invest abroad. [By the early
1990s, [**dramatic increases in China's economy and political power**
were among the **most important changes in international
politics**]{.mark}.]{.underline} Today, the world's most populous nation
has benefited from radically liberalizing its economy and has moved from
being a relatively insignificant corner of the world to a colossus
seeking to transform it (Rapley 2007). Equally impressive is Beijing's
move from producing low quality simple goods, exporter of raw materials
and importer of foodstuffs to being an exporter of labor intensive
consumer products and sophisticated high technology goods and an
importer of industrial products. All this she now does whilst [nurturing
a vibrant private sector and attracting nearly \$500 billion in Foreign
Direct Investment]{.underline} surpassing Japan in the region and second
only to the United States in the world. In short, China's GDP has
quadrupled from 1978 to 1998 and to the shock or perhaps fear of many,
it continues to grow. **[[Other economic indicators such as levels of
trade and foreign reserves have also leapt
forward.]{.underline}]{.mark}** This article explores the aspect of
[Chinese trade and its effects on international stability,]{.underline}
and their roles in Jamaica. The discourse is an evaluation of economics
and politics, with emphasis on the gamesmanship that is played by China
in seeking to attain world domination. DISCUSSION Naturally, with the
increase in GDP, China has sought to increase her defense budget and
modernize her military forces. Beginning in 1989, China's government
announced a succession of large peacetime increases in military
spending. Beijing now focuses on countering Washington's high tech
capabilities and precision weapons [ranging]{.underline} from
information networks to stealth aircraft, cruise missiles and precision
guided bombs \[8\]. Though Beijing claims that part of the increase is
to offset the effects of inflation and a decade of relative neglect
\[6\], many analysts put forward that China's ultimate long term
military modernization game plan is to deter, delay or deny US
intervention in Asian conflicts and to eventually replace the US as the
paramount military power in the Pacific. Despite the conflicting
arguments of China's real intensions as a super or global power, it
cannot be denied that China is now a force to reckon with and all things
being well, we may be looking towards a "Sino-century". Notwithstanding,
[China is the world's emerging great power that poses the most difficult
questions for the future of international peace and
stability.]{.underline} **[[The ways in which China can upset the status
quo can and will be looked at on three levels - the domestic or national
level, the regional level and the international]{.underline}]{.mark}**
or systematic [**[level]{.mark}**.]{.underline} The aim of this research
is to evaluate and analyze the meaning of [China's growth]{.underline}
at the three proposed levels while still attempting to
[link]{.underline} each evaluation [to the larger question of
international stability.]{.underline} On the national level, [China is
now facing a crucial test in its transition to a market
economy.]{.underline} China now experiences increased inflation, real
estate bubbles and growing shortages on key resources such as oil,
water, electricity and steel\[8\]. In addition, she faces tremendous
disruptions caused by her rapid growth, such as internal migration from
rural to urban areas, high levels ofunemployment, massive bank debt and
the increasing problems posed by an aging population \[7\]. Rapley in a
newspaper article in the Jamaican Gleaner (May 18, 2006) states that
though China has grown more in the last eight years than Jamaica has
since independence (45 years), it has not been so fortunate as to escape
the problem of grave social divisions (N/B this is not to imply that
Jamaica has been). A number of Political Scientists and International
Relations theorists write that China will become an economic superpower,
they even go as far as to predict by when and with what GDP, however
according to Lardy, they fail to include a number of factors about
Asia's rising star. Many fail to report that China's population now
exceeds 1.1 billion and will grow another hundred million in the coming
decades adding to the country's already present economic strains. They
have failed to report that China now exhibits a drastic divide between
its richest buyers and poorest beggars (Rapley 2006). They fail to
report that **[[China's economy is developing rapidly but is based on
labor rather than technology and is handicapped by logistics and
pervasive corruption]{.underline}]{.mark}** \[13\]. They also fail to
report that the **[[current rising social discontent as well as the
financial instability constantly threatens to produce a major
crisis]{.underline}]{.mark}** that may overturn China in particular and
the international arena in general. Suffice to say, many of these
writers fail to report that the mighty dragon has its ailments.
Political Scientists suggest that if China does not mend her internal
problems then she may very well crash. [Such a massive
bust]{.underline}, states Hoge, [would undoubtedly have dire
consequences for China]{.underline} herself. [However, the consequences
are even direr when one considers that China is now such a large player
in the global economy that its health is inextricably linked to that of
the system at large]{.underline}. In our now "globalized world", **[[a
collapsing China will jeopardize international
stability]{.underline}]{.mark}** as it will undoubtedly have a domino
effect- push one down and the others fall with it.

The West and China\'s Decline A great deal of evidence suggests that
China\'s current growth is unsustainable for a variety of reasons. If
so, it faces hard times ahead, regardless of the character of the
governing regime. **[[China\'s decline, especially if it results in
chaotic conditions there, is likely to damage the economic well-being of
the United States and the international community, which are depending
on China to be the engine of global economic growth and a partner for
peaceful cooperation on nuclear proliferation.]{.underline}]{.mark}**
Long-term economic stagnation or decline carries important implications
for the foreign policies of the United States and the international
community. Over the last three decades the United States and Europe have
followed a range of policies designed to integrate China into the global
economic and political systems. In recent years, however, a growing
chorus in Congress has argued that it is time, now that China is so
strong, to insist that it change its self-interested policies on
currency valuation, intellectual property protection, and human rights.
But changing U.S. and European direction at this time could be just the
wrong move. [Although China may look like a rising economic and
political competitor today, **[that situation could quickly
reverse.]{.mark}**]{.underline} The wildly erroneous predictions of
\"Japan as #1\" three decades ago should warn the outside world not to
over-react to the \"China threat.\" [Punitive U.S. measures in response
to China\'s mercantilist trade and currency policies]{.underline} and
disregard for intellectual property rights, however justifiable on the
merits, [could create the impression in China that the US has created,
or at least hastened and deepened its economic stagnation. **[The United
States should avoid providing the CPC regime any excuse to claim the
United States is the cause of China\'s woes. If the Chinese people as a
whole ever adopt that view, U.S.-China relations could be poisoned for
decades.]{.mark}** The United States and the international community
should also recognize that, [as China\'s economy deteriorates, any
confrontational military maneuvers are likely to be met with escalation
rather than compromise.]{.mark} Confrontation would tempt a struggling
CPC regime to adopt a jingoistic, rally-\'round-the-flag
patriotism.]{.underline} The CPC regime already inculcates and makes
political use of anti-Japanese feelings among Chinese born long after
the end of World War II. [\"Foreign threats\" would serve both to
encourage public unity and to justify crushing whatever real or
perceived internal opposition exists. It would also favor increased
military expenditures]{.underline} and distract people from adverse
economic and ecological developments. [[The United States should make
serious efforts to avoid becoming the new enemy. It will need to tread
carefully to avoid making China\'s economic decline worse both for China
and the rest of the world.]{.mark}]{.underline}

## One China Policy Good

[The \"One China\" policy, which means no official relations with
Taiwan, has worked for the past 38 years, former Ambassador Christopher
Hill said Monday, and he is not quite sure why President-elect Donald
Trump and his incoming administration feel the need to change
it.]{.underline} \"I understand things happen,\" Hill commented during a
panel discussion on [MSNBC\'s \"Morning
Joe.\"](http://www.msnbc.com/morning-joe/watch/-taiwan-is-the-most-emotional-issue-in-china-824920131754)
\"This was what he felt was a courtesy call. I get that. [What I worry
about is some sort of doubling down and deciding somehow we\'ve got to
make some big-time change in a policy that has served our interest very
well for almost 40 years.\"]{.underline} Two days after [accepting a
congratulatory
call](https://www.newsmax.com/Newsfront/donald-trump-taiwan-china-phone/2016/12/02/id/761934/)
from Taiwan President Taiwan President Tsai Ing-wen, Trump took to
Twitter on Sunday to reject the criticism of the call, and to tell his
Twitter followers he will not allow China to tell him who to speak with,
while airing his grievances about China\'s activities. But the One China
plan means no courtesy calls, Hill said Monday. \"[At the same time
we\'ve had something called a Taiwan Relations Act, which kind of lays
out what precisely the relationship with Taiwan is, including armed
sales,\" Hill said. \"Frankly, when you look around the world at all of
the mess going on whether in Syria, North Korea, one thing that isn\'t
broke that is the way in which we deal with China and Taiwan. So, you
know, the adage of it ain\'t broke, don\'t fix it.\"]{.underline} Trump
might want to change the policy, Hill said, but he should not do that
over the phone. \"He ought to consult with Congress and have some
studies, and he might want to talk to someone in the State Department
now and again about this,\" Hill said. \"We need the Chinese for North
Korea and need them to back off the South China Sea and be helpful on a
lot of issues.\" [However, he continued, the question is whether to
threaten to rip up agreements that have been in place for years over
those issues. \"I guess my point is I would like to see a little more
thoughtfulness on this and a little more consultation,\" Hill said. \"We
are not one-man rule in this country.\"]{.underline}

independence or not\*\*

[Chinese leaders in recent years have been following a coherent policy
toward Asia that emphasizes moderation and accommodation while
preserving core PRC interests. China\'s prevailing 'good neighbor'
policy approach---backed by improvement in US--China
relations---provides important opportunities and challenges for Taiwan.
It clearly inclines the PRC leaders to avoid more aggressive or
harder‐line tactics in the mix of carrots and sticks that makes up
China\'s recent approach toward Taiwan.]{.underline} To follow a more
disruptive course would undermine the influence and advantage Beijing
has been seeking with its ongoing moderate approach toward the United
States and other Asian powers. [The main challenge for Taiwan is how to
deal with the current balance of carrots and sticks in China\'s policy.
Much depends on the ability of Taiwan\'s leaders and populace to turn
the prevailing balance in PRC policy to Taiwan\'s advantage. This
presumably will involve reviving their economy, promoting effective
governance and prudent defense, while consolidating relations with the
United States and managing tensions in cross‐Strait relations to the
advantage of Taiwan\'s future security and development. Unfortunately,
there is no political consensus on Taiwan to mobilize domestic resources
and opinion in a concerted effort to protect Taiwan\'s future as an
entity independent of PRC control. Those outsiders who have followed
with positive interest Taiwan\'s remarkable development over the past
decades hope that Taiwan makes good use of the opportunities posed by
China\'s good neighbor policy to adopt prudent and concrete measures
beneficial to Taiwan\'s long range prospects.]{.underline}

[Earlier this week, president-elect Donald Trump threatened to reset the
relationship between the US and China, after receiving a congratulatory
and controversial phone call from Taiwan president Tsai
Ing-wen.]{.underline} "I fully understand the 'one China' policy, but I
don't know why we have to be bound by a 'one China' policy unless we
make a deal with China having to do with other things, including trade,"
[he told Fox News on Dec.
11](http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2016/12/12/chinese-media-calls-trump-ignorant-after-taiwan-comments.html).
[The "One China" policy refers to Beijing's position that Taiwan is a
province of China (despite the fact that it holds democratic elections
and is independently governed), and therefore other countries can have
formal diplomatic relations with either China or Taiwan, but not both.
Trump's conversation with Tsai was welcomed by Taiwan's supporters and
others who feel the US's approach to China has been too deferential. But
his statement about a "deal" implies that distancing himself from "One
China" is mere theater, at Taiwan's expense. Historically, the island
faced threats of "punishment" by China when foreign governments question
the Chinese Communist Party's stance on unification. As far back as
1996, after the US issued a visa to a Taiwanese president, Beijing
launched a [series of missile
tests](http://www.scmp.com/news/china/policies-politics/article/2054141/how-snub-one-china-policy-almost-led-beijing-and-us-war?utm_content=bufferfc63c&utm_medium=social&utm_source=twitter.com&utm_campaign=buffer)
in the Taiwan Strait order to demonstrate its displeasure. Right now,
China would have a number of tools at its disposal to hurt Taiwan---not
just military ones, but economic ones. That's because the island is more
economically dependent on China than ever before.]{.underline} From
nothing to number one [Over the past fifteen years Taiwan's economy has
become deeply linked with that of its neighbor. China is Taiwan's
largest trade partner, absorbing nearly 30% of Taiwan's exports by
value]{.underline}. Somewhat ironically, most of this growth took place
during the administration of Chen Shui-bian---the island's first
president from the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP), which broadly
advocates independence from China. [Despite promoting a distinct
Taiwanese national identity, Chen helped raise the value the island's
exports across the straits to \$66 billion by his eight-year term's end
in 2008. In 2015, exports accounted for [53% of Taiwan's
GDP](http://www.bcctaipei.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Taiwan-2016-Q1-Economic-Report-External.pdf),
and China is by far its leading market.]{.underline} Growth in trade was
more modest under the Ma Ying-jeou administration that took over from
Chen, though the Kuomintang (KMT) leader nevertheless deepened the
economic ties between the two countries. [In 2010 Ma signed the
[Economic Co-operation Framework
Agreement](http://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-pacific-11275274), which
removed tariffs on 539 goods going from Taiwan to China and 267 goods
going from China to Taiwan. He also opened the island to tourism from
China, which led to a boom in visitors from across the
straits---mainland Chinese nationals now account for about half of all
tourists in Taiwan. The closer links mean that Taiwan's non-Chinese
trading partners don't even come close. The number two exporting
destination, Hong Kong, is a special administrative region of China, and
the US is a distant third, absorbing just 12% of Taiwan's exports.
Tsai's administration remains aware of the island's dependence on China,
and a key part of her platform involves directing the economy
elsewhere]{.underline}. In an [interview with the Wall Street
Journal](http://blogs.wsj.com/chinarealtime/2016/10/05/taiwanese-president-tsai-taiwan-wont-succumb-to-chinas-pressure/),
she said she hopes to shift reliance away from tech and manufacturing
and towards "innovation," and also deepen relationships with Southeast
Asia. Taiwanese in China [About [2 million
Taiwanese](http://www.gvm.com.tw/Boardcontent_22051.html) (link in
Chinese) live in China permanently, running businesses large and small.
Known as *taishang*, these Taiwan businesses often employ
thousands---sometimes tens of thousands---of mainland Chinese in the
tech and manufacturing sector, and rely on a mixture of Taiwanese and
Chinese capital to fuel their business expansion. Foxconn, or Hon Hai,
is the largest with about one million employees on the mainland. Foreign
direct investment from Taiwan into China this year is has already
[exceeded \$10
billion](http://www.moeaic.gov.tw/system_external/ctlr?PRO=NewsLoad&lang=1&id=1135),
more than triple the amount [in
1993](https://www.ucm.es/data/cont/media/www/pag-72537/TUNG4M.pdf).
Foreign direct investment from China into Taiwan remains considerably
smaller, amounting to over \$215 million from January 2016 to October
2016, because the Taiwan government has limited what China can invest
in. These *taishang* are perhaps the group of Taiwanese nationals with
the most at stake, should Beijing follow through with its threats. Doing
business in China requires navigating through a complicated
bureaucrac]{.underline}y. It's easy for local and provincial officials
to find ways to throw obstacles in the way of Taiwanese businessmen, as
a punishment for holding the wrong passport. [Taiwanese businesses are
already feeling pressure owners will feel pressure to show more public
deference towards Beijing]{.underline}. Zhang Zhijun of the Taiwan
Affairs Council in Beijing said [after the Tsai
call](http://www.scmp.com/news/china/policies-politics/article/2054141/how-snub-one-china-policy-almost-led-beijing-and-us-war?utm_content=bufferfc63c&utm_medium=social&utm_source=twitter.com&utm_campaign=buffer)with
Trump that the government "absolutely will not allow them to support
Taiwan independence after they return to the island with money earned
from mainland." [In 2012, for example HTC chairwoman Cher Wang voiced
[support for the "One China"
principle](http://www.taipeitimes.com/News/editorials/archives/2015/06/20/2003621112),
just as the company's sales were starting to slow.]{.underline} This
year, a seafood restaurant published a [pro-"One China"
advertisement](http://www.taipeitimes.com/News/taiwan/archives/2016/12/10/2003660927)
in a local Taiwan newspaper, drawing similar criticism. The tech sector
[Technology in particular faces the most risk---eight of the island's
top ten revenue generators are involved in hardware manufacturing and
assembly, and all of them do business across the strait. As a worst case
scenario, political backlash could mean mainland partners dissolve their
contracts with Taiwanese manufacturers.]{.underline} Already, component
makers and designers like TSMC and MediaTek face [increased competition
from Chinese
counterparts](http://asia.nikkei.com/Business/AC/MediaTek-posts-record-sales-but-faces-stiff-competition),
many of whom are state-owned. Chinese device makers pressured by the
government could cancel contracts with Taiwanese chip makers and switch
to domestic rivals, like Tsinghua Unigroup or Spreadtrum. In the past
eight years, delegations from China have frequently come to Taiwan to
sign contract with local electronics equipment companies, says Ross
Darrell Feingold, a senior advisor at DC International Advisory, a
consultancy that advises clients on political risk in markets around the
globe. "That's probably not going to be happening with any frequency at
all in the coming years." A slowing economy [Taiwan's increased
dependency on China comes as the island is suffering economically
overall. GDP growth in 2015 was a paltry 0.4%. Economic malaise was a
large factor in the current president Tsai Ing-wen's [victory earlier
this
year](http://qz.com/596269/taiwans-new-president-is-a-female-academic-who-loves-cats-and-supports-gay-rights/),
as many young voters believe the beneficiary of increased economic ties
with China has been China, not Taiwan.]{.underline} Tsai's win has
already prompted Beijing to suspend regular [diplomatic talks with
Taiwan](http://www.scmp.com/news/china/policies-politics/article/1949425/beijing-threatens-suspend-talks-taipei-until-tsai-ing),
which could affect business ties, because she is a member of the broadly
pro-independence DPP party. China's economic slowdown isn't making
things any better, and Trump's possible upset of US-Taiwan relations
adds an extra layer of geopolitical tension to an already precarious
economic situation, Feingold says. ["China is unhappy and that does
create risks for people in Taiwan and companies in Taiwan," says
Feingold. "It's not necessarily the case that they're worse today than
they were before the phone call. But it's worth watching those risks and
public perception of those risks going forward."]{.underline}
