#### There are three standards: 

#### First is the grease trap---policy debate ultimately makes people worse at state governance---when they get out in the world actually trying to make change debaters find that their skills of speaking fast and using lingo like "uniqueness" and "impact turn" ultimately make their persuasion skills worse. People don't turn into politicians because of debate, they do debate because they already are politicians---it should be in our interest to ensure that politicians gain the worst skills possible so they can't spread their ideology and move the government to do worse---forcing aff teams to defend policy action and preserving policy only debate is key. 

#### Simultaneously, those who participate in political debate are actually less likely to become politicians in the future---our interp means that policy and right leaning teams will do less actions in the political

**[This study advances our understanding of

studies of American voting, but for which empirical evidence and
theoretical deelopement has been sorely lacking. Although the current
consensus suggests that political cross-pressures are of little, if any,
consequence for political participation, **[I find that [people whose
networks involve greater political disagreement]{.mark} [are]{.mark}
[less likely to participate in politics]{.mark}. Two social
psychological processes are suggested to account for this effect. First,
[those embedded in cross-cuttting]{.mark} social and political networks
[are]{.mark}, as a consequence, [more]{.mark} [likely]{.mark} [to hold
ambivalent]{.mark} political [views]{.mark}, [which]{.mark} in turn
[discourage]{.mark} political [involvement]{.mark}. [Second]{.mark},
[social accountability]{.mark} pressures [in cross- cutting]{.mark}
networks [discourage]{.mark} political [participation]{.mark};
[the]{.mark} inherently [controversial]{.mark} nature [of politics is
perceived to pose threats to]{.mark} the harmony of [social
relationships]{.mark}.]{.underline}** 838 A venerable tradition of
research within social psychological studies of voting behavior
emphasizes the problems posed by \"cross- pressures\" for individuals
faced with a voting decision. In early voting research, The People s
Choice suggested that **[[conflicts]{.mark} and inconsistencies among
the factors [influencing]{.mark} [a]{.mark}n individual\'s [vote]{.mark}
decision [discouraged voters]{.mark} from early involvement in the
campaign: \"Whatever the source of the conflicting pressures, whether
from social status or class identifica- tion, from voting traditions or
the attitudes of associates, the consistent result was to delay the
voter\'s final decision]{.underline}**\" (Lazarsfeld, Berelson, and
Gaudet 1944,60). The American Voter even more directly acknowledged the
problem of conflicting considerations surrounding political choices[:
**[The person who experiences some degree of
conflict]{.underline}**]{.mark} **[tends to cast his vote for President
with substantially less enthusiasm \... and he [is]{.mark} some- what
[less likely to vote at]{.mark} all than is the person whose partisan
feelings are entirely consistent]{.underline}**. \[\... \] If attitude
conflict leaves its impress on several aspects of behavior it also
influences what we will call the individual\'s involvement in the
election. (Campbell et al. 1960,83, **[Likewise, Hovland and colleagues
suggested that [the effects of conflicting social influences
included]{.mark} \"vacillation, [apathy]{.mark}, and loss of interest

#### Second is camouflage---speaking your method out loud lets policy teams and the PRL learn about what you're arguing and better prepare institutions to be able to stop it---in the face of those institutions you should embrace disguise in order to train yourself how to hide from the all seeing eye of the state. Then, when the time is right after you've left debate, you can use your skills to ambush people in their institutions and take it down from the inside. Without the opacity of our interpretation, leftist movements get easily co-opted. Specifically true of debate---activism can spark from anywhere, but debate is one of the few places where you can have both someone on the right and an audience that allows you to develop the skill of tricking them. 

#### Third is that information is dissuasive and you should endorse the arbitrariness of the rules of the game -- debate has no transformative power and rules of the game are not the law

In order to understand the conceptual difference, it is important to
note that when Baudrillard speaks of the law, he is not referring to law
only in the strictly judicial meaning of the term. Baudrillard is rather
drawing on a psychoanalytical tradition from Freud and Lacan in which
the concept of [law stands for]{.underline} any kind of [**social
regularity**, such as prohibitions, norms, values]{.underline}, morals,
conventions, and so on, [that structures the way we act and construct
meaning in society]{.underline}. Law constitutes the social order of
society. Viewed from the perspective of an individual immersed in the
daily life of society, [the difference between]{.underline} the
**[law]{.underline}** of society [and the **rule** of the game is a
difference between **necessity** and **arbitrariness**. The law consists
**not only** of]{.underline} a series of [**prohibitions** and
**norms**. It carries also an **account** of the **justification** and
**rationality** of the law. The law [tells us not only what we
**should** and **should not** do; it tells us **also
why**]{.mark}]{.underline} we should or should not do this or that. [The
law claims to be valid and necessary regardless of the opinions held by
the individual subject included in the law. The necessity of law is
founded on transcendence]{.underline}. This may be the transcendence of
a religious order, a principle of reason and rationality, or a system of
tradition. In any case [the law justifies itself with reference to some
order **beyond the immediate content** of itself]{.underline}. [Contrary
to the law, the [game]{.mark} and the rule [are **characterized
by**]{.mark} **their [arbitrariness]{.mark}**. The rule claims **no
justification** beyond its **immediate appearance**]{.underline}. It
does not profess to represent a higher religious order or rational
principle. In this way [[the rule is **purely immanent to the
game**]{.underline}]{.mark}. Furthermore, [the rule tells the subject
engaged in the game what to do and not to do, but it [**does not**
give]{.mark}]{.underline} him \[[them\] any [reasons
**why**]{.mark}]{.underline} he \[[[they\] should follow the
rule]{.underline}]{.mark}. When asked, [the rule provides **no other
justification** for itself than the **mere reference to the game**
itself]{.underline}: "Because these are the rules of the game!"
Baudrillard sums up the difference between the rule and the law: "The
Rule plays on an immanent sequence of arbitrary signs, while the Law is
based on a transcendent sequence of necessary signs."4 Think of the very
simple game you can play when walking on the street in which you are not
allowed to step on the lines between the flags of the pavement. The game
is instituted by the invocation of the rule "Don't step on the lines!"
This rule is purely arbitrary. The game could be played just as well
with the complete opposite rule: "You must step on a line for every
single step you take!" Furthermore, the rule gives no reason that it
should be followed. It has no "formal, moral or psychological structure
or superstructure"5 to support its functioning. [The functioning of the
game is **dependent** on the **voluntary submission** to the rule by the
players engaging in the game]{.underline}. [Compare this to]{.underline}
the traffic **[regulations]{.underline}** prescribed by law: "Don't walk
in the street." "Cross the street only at the green light."
[These]{.underline} regulations [apply **unconditionally** and **must be
obeyed** by anyone regardless of whether]{.underline} he wants \[[they
want\] to or not]{.underline}. Traffic [regulations come
with]{.underline} a series of explicit and implicit **[reasons why they
should be followed]{.underline}**, [for instance, that they secure the
social order]{.underline} of the traffic situation [for the safety of
everyone]{.underline}. The transcendence of law makes the validity of
law unconditional. It is not up to the individual subject of law to
decide whether he wants to submit to the law or not. [Conversely, the
**purely arbitrary character** of the rule **sets free the subject** and
**leaves it up to the individual** whether]{.underline} he [\[they\]
wants to participate in the game and become obliged by the rules of the
game or not]{.underline}. In Homo Ludens Huizinga indeed proposes
voluntariness and freedom as the first in his list of characteristics of
play.6 "because it's fun" Law as understood by Baudrillard not only
constitutes society. In the psychoanalytic tradition that Baudrillard is
drawing on, law also plays a crucial role in the very constitution of
the subject. To be a subject is to be subject to law. Without law, there
would be no subject. At first glance, law manifests itself as a
prohibition banning our access to certain objects and acts. We may think
of the law as an institution necessary in order to discipline our wild
and otherwise uncontrolled desires for different forbidden things such
as other people's property (Thou shalt not steal) or transgressive
sexual acts (Thou shalt not commit adultery). In this line of thinking,
a society without law would be an anarchical allagainst-all with
everybody satisfying her every desire at the expense of everybody else.
However, working along similar lines as Baudrillard, Zizek argues that
law has also the latent function of structuring our very being as
subjects since the law is what institutes our desires in the first
place. When the law tells us not to do this or that, it carries an
underlying fantasmatic message promising that beyond the prohibition of
the law lie the objects that may satisfy the desire of the subject.
Inherent in the law is the fantasy of what might happen if the law was
not there to prevent me from pursuing my immediate desires. As was the
case with the concept of law, it is important to note that the concept
of fantasy differs from its usual meaning. Here is how Zizek explains
the term: Fantasy is usually c\]onceived as a scenario that realizes the
subject's desire. This elementary definition is quite adequate, on
condition that we take it literally, what the fantasy stages is not a
scene in which our desire is fulfilled, fully satisfied, but on the
contrary, a scene that realizes, stages, the desire as such. The
fundamental point of psychoanalysis is that desire is not something
given in advance, but something that has to be constructed---and it is
precisely the role of fantasy to give the coordinates of the subject's
desire, to specify its object, to locate the position the subject
assumes in it. It is only through fantasy that the subject is
constituted as desiring: through fantasy, we learn how to desire.7 Based
on this understanding, Zizek often uses the concept of fantasy in
conjunction with the concept of ideology.8 Only on a very superficial
level is fantasy opposed to law in the sense that we fantasize about the
transgression or even the abolition of law. We might think here of
consumerist fantasies of the kind where we imagine gaining access to
products that we cannot afford to buy: "If only the law of property or
the law of equivalences did not prevent me from having this sweater or
that car I would . . ." On another level, fantasy and law work together
in structuring the desire of the subject. By restraining the subject's
access to the objects of desire designated by fantasy, law prevents the
subject from realizing that the qualities and possibilities for
enjoyment imagined to belong to the object are in fact projections of
the subject's own fantasy. In this way, the different laws of the market
restraining our access to consumer goods are the condition of
possibility for the fantasmatic projections about the amount of
happiness, enjoyment, and fulfillment we would attain if we had free and
unlimited access to these goods. The idea of law instituting order in an
otherwise anarchical world of unrestrained desire (e.g., in Hobbes) is
actually a myth produced in the domain of fantasy and ideology. First,
the myth gives legitimacy to law by explaining why it is necessary, but
second and perhaps more importantly the myth tells us what we would
really want if it were not for the law restraining us. Thus, the message
of the law is split into the explicit prohibition and the fantasmatic
injunction to transgress the law.9 In this way law interacts with
fantasy in the domain of ideology in order to teach the subject what and
how to desire. An important implication of this understanding of the
relation between fantasy and law is that even in transgression, the
subject does not move beyond the domain of law. A thief illegally
appropriating consumer goods by transgressing the law of property does
not violate the fundamental principles for the structuring of desire in
the consumer society. It may in fact even be argued that his
transgressive act confirms the desirability of the consumer goods. Since
the thief will go to such extremities in order to attain the goods, the
goods must indeed be something extraordinary. In Baudrillard's analysis
of the difference between law and rule, we find the following reflection
related to transgression: Ordinarily [we live within the realm of the
Law, **even when fantasizing its abolition**. Beyond the law we see
**only its transgression** or the **lifting of a
prohibition**]{.underline}. For [[the discourse of law]{.mark} and
interdiction [**determines the inverse discourse** of
transgression]{.mark} and liberation]{.underline}. [However, it is not
the absence of the law that is opposed to the law, but the
Rule]{.underline}.10 Instead of transgression or absence of law,
Baudrillard suggests the rule as being opposed to law. The argument is
here not that by following the rule of the game, the player is violating
the law of society. The point is rather the much more subtle one that
[by entering the sphere of the rule and [the game]{.mark} the player
[moves **beyond the ideological domain of the
law**]{.mark}]{.underline}. Law, desire, and subjectivity tie into each
other in a kind of Gordian knot. In the game, where law is substituted
for the rule, this knot is cut. In its explicit contingency, the rule is
not supported by fantasy. [[The rule **does not** hold a **promise of
satisfaction**]{.mark}; no sublime object is imagined beyond the rule.
The rule claims to be **nothing more than what it is**]{.underline}. So
what is the attraction of the rule and the game, if not satisfaction of
a desire? [[Entering the game means **voluntarily submitting** to an
**arbitrary rule** with **no higher meaning**]{.mark}. This act
is]{.underline}, however, [a way of **delivering oneself from the law**.
Since transgression is **already inscribed** in the law **even in the
violation** of a prohibition, we are **still [caught in]{.mark} the web
of [the law]{.mark}** []{.mark}and its **matrix of
satisfaction/unsatisfaction**. In the violation, we may contradict the
explicit word of the law but we are **[still confirming its]{.mark}
underlying [principle]{.mark}** of desire. When choosing to submit to
the rules of a game]{.underline}, however, [we **step into another
order** not structured by the law and desire. [We **renounce our
desire**]{.mark}]{.underline}, not in an ascetic abstinence from
particular objects of desire (which is by the way only an extreme
sublimation of the objects of desire), but [[by **letting ourselves be
seduced** into an order not promising **any**]{.mark} **kind of
[satisfaction]{.mark} at all**]{.underline}. In this way, [[we **move
beyond** the law]{.mark}'s matrix of
satisfaction/unsatisfaction]{.underline}. When obeying the law, our
conscious rational belief in it is supported by an unacknowledged
irrational belief. Yet, [entering the game, we **openly acknowledge**
the **pure contingency** of the rule, and so our conscious submission to
it is based on **no belief whatsoever**. We have [**no illusions** that
the game is **nothing but an illusion**]{.mark}]{.underline}, and so our
approach to the game is perhaps more "realistic" than our approach to
the law. [The game's **sole principle** . . . is that by choosing the
rule one is **delivered from the law**]{.underline}. Without a
psychological or metaphysical foundation, the rule has no grounding in
belief. [One **neither believes** nor **disbelieves** a rule---**one
observes it**]{.underline}. The diffuse sphere of belief, [the need for
credibility that encompasses the real, is **dissolved in the game**.
Hence their immorality: to proceed without believing in it, to sanction
a direct fascination with conventional signs and groundless
rules]{.underline}.11 In the game, [desire is **suspended** and so
is]{.underline} desire's eternal shadow figure,
**[unsatisfaction]{.underline}**, which is a necessary condition for the
reproduction of desire. [In the game, there is **no promise** and
therefore **no disappointment**. In the order of the law, we may find
enjoyment in the **momentary** and **partial satisfaction** of our
desires through obtainment of different objects. [The joy of the game
stems **not** from this]{.mark} kind of satisfaction [but]{.mark}
**exactly [from]{.mark}**]{.underline} the
**[[suspension]{.underline}]{.mark}** [of the
satisfaction/unsatisfaction matrix]{.underline}. In order to understand
the intensity of ritual forms, one must rid oneself of the idea that all
happiness derives from nature, and all pleasure from the satisfaction of
a desire. On the contrary, [games, the sphere of play, reveal a
**passion for rules**, a **giddiness born of rules**, and a force that
comes from **ceremony**, and **not desire**]{.underline}.12 As an
equivalent to the "giddiness" of which Baudrillard speaks here, we find
in Huizinga's characteristic of play the notion of "fun." [[People play
games **because it is fun**. Rather than providing]{.mark} a
**[full]{.mark}** and **conclusive [explanation]{.mark}** for the
engagement in games, the concept of [fun seems to **mark the
limitation** of]{.mark} such an [explanation]{.mark}. "The [fun]{.mark}
of playing]{.underline}," Huizinga notes, "[**[resists]{.mark} all
analysis**, **all logical [interpretation]{.mark}**]{.underline}."13
Think again of the game Don't Step on the Lines. [Why would someone
engage in this game?]{.underline} Why would someone chose to submit
himself to the stupid and completely arbitrary rule of not stepping on
the lines? [In the obvious absence of sanctions, potential rewards or
other kinds of meaningful satisfactions, the question can only be
answered: "**Because it's fun**."]{.underline} This, however, is
probably more of a displacement of the question than an actual answer.
In the tradition of psychoanalysis, we find also the concept of drive.
Drive is opposed to desire insofar as desire is focused on a particular
object imagined to provide satisfaction for the desire, whereas drive is
not directed at any object. Drive is a short circuit unmediated by
fantasy, where the joy of an act derives from the activity of acting
itself. Here is how Zizek defines the difference between drive and
desire: [Drive]{.underline} . . . [stands for the]{.underline}
paradoxical [possibility that the subject]{.underline}, forever
prevented from achieving his Goal (and thus fully satisfying his
desire), [can]{.underline} nevertheless [**find satisfaction** in
the]{.underline} very circular [movement of **repeatedly missing its
object**]{.underline}, of circulating around it.14 The point is here of
course that the concept of [drive as opposed to desire **provides an
account of fun**]{.underline} as opposed to the meaning of ordinary
goal-oriented behavior. Here is how the distinction between
goal-oriented desire and self-propelling drive turns out in the words of
the legendary poker player Nick "The Greek" Dandalos: "[The **next best
thing** to]{.underline} gambling and [winning is]{.underline} gambling
and **[losing]{.underline}**."15 game as parody We have seen that the
rule is opposed to the law and that the choice of the rule delivers the
player from the ideology of law. What does this say about the relation
between game and society? We might for a brief moment be tempted to
proclaim the playing of games as an act of criticism toward the ideology
of society. This, however, would be jumping ahead, and it would fit very
badly with the actual position held by different games in our society.
How would we think, for instance, of Champions League football as a form
of resistance toward society? Furthermore, our analysis has just shown
that [the domain of the rule and fun is characterized by
**arbitrariness** and **absence of meaning**]{.underline}. Hence, [[it
would be **contradictory** to project]{.mark} a certain **critical** and
**normative [intentionality]{.mark}** [into the]{.mark} **mere
engagement in a [game]{.mark}**]{.underline}. At the same time, the
analyses carried out in this book are motivated by the assumption that
there is indeed some kind of sociologically significant relation between
the games played in society and society as a whole. This assumption is
shared by Huizinga, whom we have already quoted saying: "All play means
something."16 [In order to **avoid the pitfalls** of **formally
fixating** the normativity of the meaning of games in relation to
society]{.underline} [by making]{.underline} general [statements such
as: "games constitute a critique of the ideology of
society]{.underline}," "games constitute a celebration of societal
values," "games constitute a way of governing the subjects of society,"
"games constitute a way of opposing dominant power structures of
society," and so on, we shall once again turn to Baudrillard for
conceptual support: [[The rule functions as the **parodic simulacrum**
of the law]{.mark}. **Neither** an **inversion** nor **subversion** of
the law, but its **reversion in simulation**]{.underline}. The pleasure
of the game is twofold: the invalidation of time and space within the
enchanted sphere of an indestructible form of reciprocity---pure
seduction---and the parodying of reality, the formal outbidding of the
law's constraints.17 Insofar as the game emerges as the institution of
an extra set of rules governing the subject, it seems to constitute an
addition to the order of the law. Perhaps the social significance of the
game lies, however, in the subtraction of fantasmatic ideology from the
prescriptions of law. [[**On an immediate level**, the rules]{.mark} of
a game **[look like the law]{.mark}** of society. The rule]{.underline}
"Don't step on the lines" **[looks like the regulation]{.underline}**
"Only walk on a green light." However, on closer inspection [[the rule
**lacks the fantasmatic support of ideology**]{.mark}. The game thus
presents the rule [in its **naked arbitrariness**]{.mark}]{.underline}.
[To the extent that the rules of a game **carry some similarity** to
particular laws of society, the institution of the game may **affect**
and **transform our view** of the **particular law**. The **subtraction
of ideology** in the game may **make us aware** of the **ideological
dimension** of the law, thus causing us to view the law in **the same
"naked arbitrariness" as the rule**]{.underline}. According to Zizek,
[any law is **inherently contradictory** and basically founded on a
**violent** and **illegitimate move** in which law constitutes itself as
law]{.underline}. The obvious example here is of course [the allegedly
humanistic laws of democracy]{.underline}, which [are **founded
on**]{.underline} the cruel, violent, and anything but democratic
**[brutality]{.underline}** of the French Revolution. Underneath the
surface of the normal, rational, legitimate, universal law lies a
traumatic truth about the abnormal, irrational, illegitimate, contingent
foundation of the law, and [for law to **function** this traumatic truth
must **remain concealed**]{.underline}. Zizek states: "Every reign of
law has its hidden roots in such an absolute---selfreferential,
self-negating---crime by means of which crime assumes the form of law,
and if the law is to reign in its 'normal' form, this reverse must be
unconditionally repressed."18 [The function of ideology is to **conceal
the traumatic contradictions** of law in order for law to function in a
smooth and orderly fashion]{.underline}. [When the rule]{.underline}, in
the words of Baudrillard, [functions as the **parodic simulacrum** of
the law, it **simulates the law** in the context of the play
world]{.underline}. Since the play world is devoid of the fantasmatic
projections of ideology, the rule stands forth in a more "naked"
appearance than the way we are used to seeing the law. [The rule of the
game **mimics law**. It **[does not pretend to be law]{.mark}**. In
fact, the rule does not pretend to be **anything more** or **less** than
what it is]{.underline}. [Given that the rule is **conventional** and
**arbitrary**, and has **no hidden truth**, it knows **neither
repression** nor the **distinction** between the **manifest** and the
**latent**. It **does not carry any meaning**, it does not lead
anywhere; by contrast, the Law has a **determinate
finality**]{.underline}.19 [The **absence** of any kind of
**justification** or **rationalization** transcending the rule
**produces a vacuum** around the game]{.underline}. Contrary to the laws
of the social order, [the game **does not explain** or **account for
itself**. It merely **offers itself**]{.underline}. Consequently, [the
game **does not pass** any **critical** or **normative judgment** on the
law and society. However, the **vacuum** produced by the rule--- the
space devoid of ideology constituted by the game---**opens the
potential** for **critical reflections** on the nature of law and
society]{.underline}. Indeed, [these reflections **cannot be made** from
**within the game**. The game **merely opens the space** for such
reflections]{.underline}.

## O/V

Extend our interpretation: affirmative teams should defend a
hypothetical plan fiating a substantial reduction of DCS and/or FMS of
arms sales from the United States,

This is NOT a normal framework argument---we believe that our framework
interpretation, while preventing affs from presenting non-normative
models of debate, is actually net better for leftist strategizing and
organizing over time.

Here's a key framing issue: people don't move towards politics because
of debate, they're interested in debate because they're already inclined
to be politicians---it's only a question of which interpretation can
best ruin the policy debaters who want to use the state to expand
anti-black, anti-queer capitalism. If we win at the end of the debate
that our interpretation is better for leftist movements overall EVEN IF
it does not produce the most productive debates we should still
win---the goal of debate is education anyway, which means you should
vote neg if you think we ruin right wing education while preserving the
safety of left wing movements.

with]{.underline} a series of explicit and implicit **[reasons why they
should be followed]{.underline}**, [for instance, that they secure the
social order]{.underline} of the traffic situation [for the safety of
everyone]{.underline}. The transcendence of law makes the validity of
law unconditional. It is not up to the individual subject of law to
decide whether he wants to submit to the law or not. [Conversely, the
**purely arbitrary character** of the rule **sets free the subject** and
**leaves it up to the individual** whether]{.underline} he [\[they\]
wants to participate in the game and become obliged by the rules of the
game or not]{.underline}. In Homo Ludens Huizinga indeed proposes
voluntariness and freedom as the first in his list of characteristics of
play.6 "because it's fun" Law as understood by Baudrillard not only
constitutes society. In the psychoanalytic tradition that Baudrillard is
drawing on, law also plays a crucial role in the very constitution of
the subject. To be a subject is to be subject to law. Without law, there
would be no subject. At first glance, law manifests itself as a
prohibition banning our access to certain objects and acts. We may think
of the law as an institution necessary in order to discipline our wild
and otherwise uncontrolled desires for different forbidden things such
as other people's property (Thou shalt not steal) or transgressive
sexual acts (Thou shalt not commit adultery). In this line of thinking,
a society without law would be an anarchical allagainst-all with
everybody satisfying her every desire at the expense of everybody else.
However, working along similar lines as Baudrillard, Zizek argues that
law has also the latent function of structuring our very being as
subjects since the law is what institutes our desires in the first
place. When the law tells us not to do this or that, it carries an
underlying fantasmatic message promising that beyond the prohibition of
the law lie the objects that may satisfy the desire of the subject.
Inherent in the law is the fantasy of what might happen if the law was
not there to prevent me from pursuing my immediate desires. As was the
case with the concept of law, it is important to note that the concept
of fantasy differs from its usual meaning. Here is how Zizek explains
the term: Fantasy is usually c\]onceived as a scenario that realizes the
subject's desire. This elementary definition is quite adequate, on
condition that we take it literally, what the fantasy stages is not a
scene in which our desire is fulfilled, fully satisfied, but on the
contrary, a scene that realizes, stages, the desire as such. The
fundamental point of psychoanalysis is that desire is not something
given in advance, but something that has to be constructed---and it is
precisely the role of fantasy to give the coordinates of the subject's
desire, to specify its object, to locate the position the subject
assumes in it. It is only through fantasy that the subject is
constituted as desiring: through fantasy, we learn how to desire.7 Based
on this understanding, Zizek often uses the concept of fantasy in
conjunction with the concept of ideology.8 Only on a very superficial
level is fantasy opposed to law in the sense that we fantasize about the
transgression or even the abolition of law. We might think here of
consumerist fantasies of the kind where we imagine gaining access to
products that we cannot afford to buy: "If only the law of property or
the law of equivalences did not prevent me from having this sweater or
that car I would . . ." On another level, fantasy and law work together
in structuring the desire of the subject. By restraining the subject's
access to the objects of desire designated by fantasy, law prevents the
subject from realizing that the qualities and possibilities for
enjoyment imagined to belong to the object are in fact projections of
the subject's own fantasy. In this way, the different laws of the market
restraining our access to consumer goods are the condition of
possibility for the fantasmatic projections about the amount of
happiness, enjoyment, and fulfillment we would attain if we had free and
unlimited access to these goods. The idea of law instituting order in an
otherwise anarchical world of unrestrained desire (e.g., in Hobbes) is
actually a myth produced in the domain of fantasy and ideology. First,
the myth gives legitimacy to law by explaining why it is necessary, but
second and perhaps more importantly the myth tells us what we would
really want if it were not for the law restraining us. Thus, the message
of the law is split into the explicit prohibition and the fantasmatic
injunction to transgress the law.9 In this way law interacts with
fantasy in the domain of ideology in order to teach the subject what and
how to desire. An important implication of this understanding of the
relation between fantasy and law is that even in transgression, the
subject does not move beyond the domain of law. A thief illegally
appropriating consumer goods by transgressing the law of property does
not violate the fundamental principles for the structuring of desire in
the consumer society. It may in fact even be argued that his
transgressive act confirms the desirability of the consumer goods. Since
the thief will go to such extremities in order to attain the goods, the
goods must indeed be something extraordinary. In Baudrillard's analysis
of the difference between law and rule, we find the following reflection
related to transgression: Ordinarily [we live within the realm of the
Law, **even when fantasizing its abolition**. Beyond the law we see
**only its transgression** or the **lifting of a
prohibition**]{.underline}. For [[the discourse of law]{.mark} and
interdiction [**determines the inverse discourse** of
transgression]{.mark} and liberation]{.underline}. [However, it is not
the absence of the law that is opposed to the law, but the
Rule]{.underline}.10 Instead of transgression or absence of law,
Baudrillard suggests the rule as being opposed to law. The argument is
here not that by following the rule of the game, the player is violating
the law of society. The point is rather the much more subtle one that
[by entering the sphere of the rule and [the game]{.mark} the player
[moves **beyond the ideological domain of the
law**]{.mark}]{.underline}. Law, desire, and subjectivity tie into each
other in a kind of Gordian knot. In the game, where law is substituted
for the rule, this knot is cut. In its explicit contingency, the rule is
not supported by fantasy. [[The rule **does not** hold a **promise of
satisfaction**]{.mark}; no sublime object is imagined beyond the rule.
The rule claims to be **nothing more than what it is**]{.underline}. So
what is the attraction of the rule and the game, if not satisfaction of
a desire? [[Entering the game means **voluntarily submitting** to an
**arbitrary rule** with **no higher meaning**]{.mark}. This act
is]{.underline}, however, [a way of **delivering oneself from the law**.
Since transgression is **already inscribed** in the law **even in the
violation** of a prohibition, we are **still [caught in]{.mark} the web
of [the law]{.mark}** []{.mark}and its **matrix of
satisfaction/unsatisfaction**. In the violation, we may contradict the
explicit word of the law but we are **[still confirming its]{.mark}
underlying [principle]{.mark}** of desire. When choosing to submit to
the rules of a game]{.underline}, however, [we **step into another
order** not structured by the law and desire. [We **renounce our
desire**]{.mark}]{.underline}, not in an ascetic abstinence from
particular objects of desire (which is by the way only an extreme
sublimation of the objects of desire), but [[by **letting ourselves be
seduced** into an order not promising **any**]{.mark} **kind of
[satisfaction]{.mark} at all**]{.underline}. In this way, [[we **move
beyond** the law]{.mark}'s matrix of
satisfaction/unsatisfaction]{.underline}. When obeying the law, our
conscious rational belief in it is supported by an unacknowledged
irrational belief. Yet, [entering the game, we **openly acknowledge**
the **pure contingency** of the rule, and so our conscious submission to
it is based on **no belief whatsoever**. We have [**no illusions** that
the game is **nothing but an illusion**]{.mark}]{.underline}, and so our
approach to the game is perhaps more "realistic" than our approach to
the law. [The game's **sole principle** . . . is that by choosing the
rule one is **delivered from the law**]{.underline}. Without a
psychological or metaphysical foundation, the rule has no grounding in
belief. [One **neither believes** nor **disbelieves** a rule---**one
observes it**]{.underline}. The diffuse sphere of belief, [the need for
credibility that encompasses the real, is **dissolved in the game**.
Hence their immorality: to proceed without believing in it, to sanction
a direct fascination with conventional signs and groundless
rules]{.underline}.11 In the game, [desire is **suspended** and so
is]{.underline} desire's eternal shadow figure,
**[unsatisfaction]{.underline}**, which is a necessary condition for the
reproduction of desire. [In the game, there is **no promise** and
therefore **no disappointment**. In the order of the law, we may find
enjoyment in the **momentary** and **partial satisfaction** of our
desires through obtainment of different objects. [The joy of the game
stems **not** from this]{.mark} kind of satisfaction [but]{.mark}
**exactly [from]{.mark}**]{.underline} the
**[[suspension]{.underline}]{.mark}** [of the
satisfaction/unsatisfaction matrix]{.underline}. In order to understand
the intensity of ritual forms, one must rid oneself of the idea that all
happiness derives from nature, and all pleasure from the satisfaction of
a desire. On the contrary, [games, the sphere of play, reveal a
**passion for rules**, a **giddiness born of rules**, and a force that
comes from **ceremony**, and **not desire**]{.underline}.12 As an
equivalent to the "giddiness" of which Baudrillard speaks here, we find
in Huizinga's characteristic of play the notion of "fun." [[People play
games **because it is fun**. Rather than providing]{.mark} a
**[full]{.mark}** and **conclusive [explanation]{.mark}** for the
engagement in games, the concept of [fun seems to **mark the
limitation** of]{.mark} such an [explanation]{.mark}. "The [fun]{.mark}
of playing]{.underline}," Huizinga notes, "[**[resists]{.mark} all
analysis**, **all logical [interpretation]{.mark}**]{.underline}."13
Think again of the game Don't Step on the Lines. [Why would someone
engage in this game?]{.underline} Why would someone chose to submit
himself to the stupid and completely arbitrary rule of not stepping on
the lines? [In the obvious absence of sanctions, potential rewards or
other kinds of meaningful satisfactions, the question can only be
answered: "**Because it's fun**."]{.underline} This, however, is
probably more of a displacement of the question than an actual answer.
In the tradition of psychoanalysis, we find also the concept of drive.
Drive is opposed to desire insofar as desire is focused on a particular
object imagined to provide satisfaction for the desire, whereas drive is
not directed at any object. Drive is a short circuit unmediated by
fantasy, where the joy of an act derives from the activity of acting
itself. Here is how Zizek defines the difference between drive and
desire: [Drive]{.underline} . . . [stands for the]{.underline}
paradoxical [possibility that the subject]{.underline}, forever
prevented from achieving his Goal (and thus fully satisfying his
desire), [can]{.underline} nevertheless [**find satisfaction** in
the]{.underline} very circular [movement of **repeatedly missing its
object**]{.underline}, of circulating around it.14 The point is here of
course that the concept of [drive as opposed to desire **provides an
account of fun**]{.underline} as opposed to the meaning of ordinary
goal-oriented behavior. Here is how the distinction between
goal-oriented desire and self-propelling drive turns out in the words of
the legendary poker player Nick "The Greek" Dandalos: "[The **next best
thing** to]{.underline} gambling and [winning is]{.underline} gambling
and **[losing]{.underline}**."15 game as parody We have seen that the
rule is opposed to the law and that the choice of the rule delivers the
player from the ideology of law. What does this say about the relation
between game and society? We might for a brief moment be tempted to
proclaim the playing of games as an act of criticism toward the ideology
of society. This, however, would be jumping ahead, and it would fit very
badly with the actual position held by different games in our society.
How would we think, for instance, of Champions League football as a form
of resistance toward society? Furthermore, our analysis has just shown
that [the domain of the rule and fun is characterized by
**arbitrariness** and **absence of meaning**]{.underline}. Hence, [[it
would be **contradictory** to project]{.mark} a certain **critical** and
**normative [intentionality]{.mark}** [into the]{.mark} **mere
engagement in a [game]{.mark}**]{.underline}. At the same time, the
analyses carried out in this book are motivated by the assumption that
there is indeed some kind of sociologically significant relation between
the games played in society and society as a whole. This assumption is
shared by Huizinga, whom we have already quoted saying: "All play means
something."16 [In order to **avoid the pitfalls** of **formally
fixating** the normativity of the meaning of games in relation to
society]{.underline} [by making]{.underline} general [statements such
as: "games constitute a critique of the ideology of
society]{.underline}," "games constitute a celebration of societal
values," "games constitute a way of governing the subjects of society,"
"games constitute a way of opposing dominant power structures of
society," and so on, we shall once again turn to Baudrillard for
conceptual support: [[The rule functions as the **parodic simulacrum**
of the law]{.mark}. **Neither** an **inversion** nor **subversion** of
the law, but its **reversion in simulation**]{.underline}. The pleasure
of the game is twofold: the invalidation of time and space within the
enchanted sphere of an indestructible form of reciprocity---pure
seduction---and the parodying of reality, the formal outbidding of the
law's constraints.17 Insofar as the game emerges as the institution of
an extra set of rules governing the subject, it seems to constitute an
addition to the order of the law. Perhaps the social significance of the
game lies, however, in the subtraction of fantasmatic ideology from the
prescriptions of law. [[**On an immediate level**, the rules]{.mark} of
a game **[look like the law]{.mark}** of society. The rule]{.underline}
"Don't step on the lines" **[looks like the regulation]{.underline}**
"Only walk on a green light." However, on closer inspection [[the rule
**lacks the fantasmatic support of ideology**]{.mark}. The game thus
presents the rule [in its **naked arbitrariness**]{.mark}]{.underline}.
[To the extent that the rules of a game **carry some similarity** to
particular laws of society, the institution of the game may **affect**
and **transform our view** of the **particular law**. The **subtraction
of ideology** in the game may **make us aware** of the **ideological
dimension** of the law, thus causing us to view the law in **the same
"naked arbitrariness" as the rule**]{.underline}. According to Zizek,
[any law is **inherently contradictory** and basically founded on a
**violent** and **illegitimate move** in which law constitutes itself as
law]{.underline}. The obvious example here is of course [the allegedly
humanistic laws of democracy]{.underline}, which [are **founded
on**]{.underline} the cruel, violent, and anything but democratic
**[brutality]{.underline}** of the French Revolution. Underneath the
surface of the normal, rational, legitimate, universal law lies a
traumatic truth about the abnormal, irrational, illegitimate, contingent
foundation of the law, and [for law to **function** this traumatic truth
must **remain concealed**]{.underline}. Zizek states: "Every reign of
law has its hidden roots in such an absolute---selfreferential,
self-negating---crime by means of which crime assumes the form of law,
and if the law is to reign in its 'normal' form, this reverse must be
unconditionally repressed."18 [The function of ideology is to **conceal
the traumatic contradictions** of law in order for law to function in a
smooth and orderly fashion]{.underline}. [When the rule]{.underline}, in
the words of Baudrillard, [functions as the **parodic simulacrum** of
the law, it **simulates the law** in the context of the play
world]{.underline}. Since the play world is devoid of the fantasmatic
projections of ideology, the rule stands forth in a more "naked"
appearance than the way we are used to seeing the law. [The rule of the
game **mimics law**. It **[does not pretend to be law]{.mark}**. In
fact, the rule does not pretend to be **anything more** or **less** than
what it is]{.underline}. [Given that the rule is **conventional** and
**arbitrary**, and has **no hidden truth**, it knows **neither
repression** nor the **distinction** between the **manifest** and the
**latent**. It **does not carry any meaning**, it does not lead
anywhere; by contrast, the Law has a **determinate
finality**]{.underline}.19 [The **absence** of any kind of
**justification** or **rationalization** transcending the rule
**produces a vacuum** around the game]{.underline}. Contrary to the laws
of the social order, [the game **does not explain** or **account for
itself**. It merely **offers itself**]{.underline}. Consequently, [the
game **does not pass** any **critical** or **normative judgment** on the
law and society. However, the **vacuum** produced by the rule--- the
space devoid of ideology constituted by the game---**opens the
potential** for **critical reflections** on the nature of law and
society]{.underline}. Indeed, [these reflections **cannot be made** from
**within the game**. The game **merely opens the space** for such
reflections]{.underline}.

### Camouflage Extension

Extend the camouflage impact---our interpretation of debate ensures that
K teams learn how best to hide themselves from the watchful eye of the
PRL. When confronted with the state, you should learn guerilla
warfare---empirically proven it succeeds better---just look at
Vietnam---when the left makes themselves obvious to institutions, they
get shut down really fast---our interp teaches teams to disguise
themselves while learning what policy teams think they can beat the left
with so we can use it against them in the future when we actually move
out of debate into creating larger movements. This turns the aff---their
aff exposes themselves to policy debate which means they learn how best
to shut down their movement---our interp instead leads to teams learning
how to hide themselves which means they can sabotage policy debate while
learning the skills to hide in the real world.

First, **[[political inaction could be induced by]{.mark} the attitudi-
nal ambivalence that [cross-cutting exposure]{.mark} is likely to
engender within an individual]{.underline}**. **[[If citizens are
embedded]{.mark} [in]{.mark} [networks that do]{.mark} not
[reinforce]{.mark} their [viewpoints]{.mark}, [but]{.mark} instead tend
to [supply]{.mark} them with [political information]{.mark}
[that]{.mark} [challenges]{.mark} their [views]{.mark}, [then]{.mark}
such [cross-cutting]{.mark} exposure [could make people
uncertain]{.mark} of their own positions with respect to issues or
candidates, [and make them less likely to take]{.mark} political
[action]{.mark} as a result. In this case it is intrapersonal conflict
that drives the effect, and the chain of events is one in which
cross-cutting exposure leads to ambivalence which, in turn, reduces
political participation]{.underline}**. A relatively recent resurgence
of interest in ambivalence that is, the simultaneous presence of both
positive and negative considerations directed toward the same attitude
object has been noted in both qualitative and quantitative approaches to
understanding political attitudes**[. For example, in her in-depth
interviews with Americans, Hochschild (1981,1993) noted a tremendous
amount of vacillation and [uncertainty in people\'s views]{.mark}, most
of which [appeared to be driven by competing]{.mark} values and
[considerations]{.mark} as applied to political questions [rather than
from a lack of political expertise]{.mark}]{.underline}**. Likewise,
efforts to better understand responses to survey questions have
suggested that citizens\' opinions are comprised of competing ideas and
considerations (Zaller and Feldman 1992; Zaller 1992), and that, as a
result, ambivalence is often difficult to distinguish from nonattitudes
as typi- cally measured (see also, Alvarez and Brehm 1995,1997**[).
[In]{.mark} studies of issues ranging from [race to abortion]{.mark},
ambivalence has been found to play an important part in the formation of
citizens\' attitudes. The consequences of political [ambivalence]{.mark}
have been less widely explored, although they [appear to include more
moderate]{.mark} political [positions]{.mark}, [less]{.mark}
[certainty]{.mark} in political judgments (Guge and Meffert 1998),
[delayed formation]{.mark} [of voting intentions, and instability
in]{.mark} candidate [evaluations]{.mark} (Lavine 2001).]{.underline}**

**[The second possible reason that [cross-cutting]{.mark} political
networks would [discourage political participation]{.mark} is
[because]{.mark} cross-cutting [networks]{.mark} [create the need to be
ac- countable]{.mark} to conflicting constituencies.]{.underline}**
According to this social psychological mechanism, **[the problem is not
that one is internally conflicted over which side to support, but rather
that [one feels uncomfortable taking sides]{.mark} in the face of
multiple competing constituencies. The need for social accountability
creates anxiety because interpersonal [disagreement threatens social
relationships]{.mark}, [and there is no way to]{.mark} please all
members of one\'s network and thus [assure]{.mark} social
[harmony]{.mark}.]{.underline}** As Green, Visser, and **[Tetlock
suggest, \"[The decision maker is]{.mark} caught in the middle, [pushed
one way]{.mark} by part of the group, [and pulled the other way by an
opposing faction]{.mark}. [The individual is forced to defend a]{.mark}
position in what may be perceived as a [\'no win\' situation]{.mark}, in
which one side will inevitably be alienated\" (2000, 4). If this
mechanism alone were at work, we would expect mainly public forms of
political participation to be affected]{.underline}**; in private
situations such as the voting booth, cross-cutting networks should pose
few problems due to social accountability. **[Qualitative evidence in
support of the idea that people avoid politics as a means of maintaining
interpersonal social harmony has been around for some
time.]{.underline}** In the mid 1950s, **[Rosenberg (1954-55), noted in
his in- depth interviews that [the threat to]{.mark} interpersonal
[harmony was a significant deterrent to political
activity]{.mark}.]{.underline}** More recent case studies have provided
further support for this thesis. In her study of New England town meet-
ings and an alternative workplace, Mansbridge (1980) similarly observed
that conflict avoidance was an important deterrent to political
participation (see also Eliasoph 1998**[). In their focus group
discussions, Conover and Searing (1998) also found considerable evidence
that people were both aware of and wary of the risks of political
discussion for interpersonal relationships. As one of their focus group
participants put it,]{.underline}** \"It\'s not worth it\... to try and
have an open discussion if it gets them \[other citizens\] upset\"
(1998,25). Verba and Nie (1972) applied a similar logic to their
analysis of political participation in which activities were
differentiated not only on the basis of the extent of initia- tive
required, and the scope of the outcome, but also on the extent to which
conflict with others was involved. Moreover, in a recent analysis of
national survey data, **[Ulbig and Funk (1999) found that individual
differences in conflict avoidance were negatively related to political
participation of some kinds, [particularly]{.mark} more public
participatory [acts such as protesting, working on a campaign, and
political discussion.]{.mark}2 The idea that conflict avoidance
discourages participation is also consistent with social psychological
research on how people handle nonpolitical interpersonal disagreements.
[When a person confronted with a difference of opinion does not
shift]{.mark} to the other person\'s views [or persuade]{.mark} them to
adopt his or her own views, [the]{.mark} most likely
[alternative]{.mark} reaction [is to devalue the issue
itself]{.mark}]{.underline}** (e.g., 2Research on the \"spiral of
silence\" similarly contends that perceived minority status will affect
political preferences by discour- aging the expression of political
viewpoints that are perceived to be unpopular (Noelle-Neumann 1974).
However, in this case political discussion is the dependent, rather than
the independent variable. But if one considers discussion as a form of
political participation, the spiral of silence can be interpreted as
suggesting that fear of interpersonal conflict inhibits participation,
as also shown by Ulbig and Funk (1999). Nonetheless, the hypothesis that
perceived support for one\'s opinions in the broader political
environment relates to willingness to speak out publicly has received
very limited support to date (see Glynn, Hayes, and Shanahan 1997).
Steiner 1966). **[[By devaluing politics]{.mark} and avoiding political
controversy, [people]{.mark} effectively [resolve the
problem]{.mark}]{.underline}**. **[In [a]{.mark} recent
[experiment]{.mark} [manipulating exposure to arguments on opposite
si]{.mark}des of an issue, as well as whether subjects were accountable
to conflicting or unified constituencies, Green, Visser, and Tetlock
(2000) [found]{.mark} that]{.underline}** **[[cross-pres- sured subjects
engaged]{.mark} [in]{.mark} many decision-evasion tactics (including
buckpassing, [procrastination, and exiting]{.mark} the situation) in
order to avoid accountability to contradic- tory
constituencies]{.underline}**. **[If we generalize these findings
outside the laboratory, [we would expect]{.mark} [those]{.mark}
[with]{.mark} high levels of [cross-cutting exposure]{.mark} in their
personal networks [to put off political decisions]{.mark} as long as
possible or altogether, thus [making]{.mark} their [political
participation]{.mark} particularly [unlikely]{.mark}]{.underline}**. In
the analyses that follow, I first examine to what extent cross-cutting
exposure within social networks does, in fact, have adverse implications
for political participation of various kinds. Second, I evaluate the
extent to which these two proposed processes of influence intrapersonal
ambivalence and interpersonal social accountability account for the
overall impact of network diversity on political participation.

-look at the cross cutting exposure vs frequency of political
talk---differentiates between "debate" and "discussion" where
"debate"🡪less political activism while "discussion"🡪more. Therefore, you
have an incentive to do force policy teams to do more debate.

[reading]{.underline} with the tape of [Johnson's beating, we can see
the ways optics,]{.underline} as that which both includes and exceeds
narrative, [produces Johnson as the "no-body"]{.underline} da Silva
asked us to think.3 Franz Fanon's often-cited passage from 1952 on his
experience of watching a film in a Paris theater sketches the multiple
spaces of seeing and being seen that constitute the visual as a
racialized practice. Fanon states (1967: 140) "I cannot go to a film
without seeing myself. I wait for me. In the interval, just before the
film starts, I wait for me. The people in the theater are watching me,
examining me, waiting for me." Fanon suggests that [the anticipation of
blackness in the viewing apparatus of the cinema]{.underline}, which I
would extend to viewing beyond the theater as well, [is imbued with a
form of anti-blackness that is]{.underline} not only seen but also
otherwise [sensed.]{.underline} Perhaps the most generative aspect of
this analysis is that **[even before the film begins, the racialized
gaze is there, anticipating him,]{.underline}** while he also awaits its
arrival. Fanon's scheme both expands the "time" of [the
film]{.underline}, meaning it [does not begin or end with the rolling of
images]{.underline}, and moves us away from assuming that the most
insipid forms of colonial racism, here [anti-blackness, appear through
image alone]{.underline} (Keeling 2003; Marriott 2007). Expanding the
time of the image and the image of time allows us to read the murder of
Duanna Johnson as the narrative conclusion of the beating tape. Further,
while [Fanon]{.underline} was writing specifically about the cinematic,
his [scheme allows us to build a similar analysis of our psychic bonds
with and through surveillance as genre in the contemporary
moment.]{.underline} The CCTV footage of Johnson functions much like
what Gilles Deleuze (1989: 101), after Henri Bergson, called a
"time-image." For Deleuze, **[a time-image is the collapsing of past,
present, and future that "makes time frightening and
inexplicable"]{.underline}** (101). While Deleuze was talking about
simultaneity in narrative cinema, [the time-image]{.underline} here
[might help us understand the specific genre of the tape where past and
future are remade through the present.]{.underline} Or, in other words,
[the time-image of the tape reminds us that]{.underline}, perhaps for
Johnson, **[there is no moment other than the time of
violence.]{.underline}** Here, Fanon's insistence that the time of the
image does not align with the opening scene of the film and Deleuze's
time-image illustrate the brutal semiotics of violence that await, in
the interval, both the structure of the visual and the structure of life
outside the theater for trans women of color. Given that representation
produces and does not simply echo what is assumed to reside in the real,
what, then, might representation and recognition offer for a trans
politics that resides on the side of flourishing? [By way of obscuring
the question of reparation and redistribution**, [representation has
been produced as the]{.mark} primary [site]{.mark} of struggle [over
"diversity"]{.mark}**]{.underline} for mainstream politics (including
mainstream LGBT politics) in the United States. [[The]{.mark} last
decade has witnessed a]{.underline} vast [[proliferation of trans
representations]{.mark} that [are offered as remedy to the relentless
economic, psychic, affective, and physical violence]{.mark} many [trans
people]{.mark},]{.underline} and in particular trans women of color,
[[endure.]{.underline}]{.mark} **[[These]{.underline}]{.mark}**
expanding **[[representations are]{.mark} also used to buttress an
argument [supporting the unfolding *progress* of dominant
culture]{.mark}.]{.underline}** Yet, if we return to CeCe McDonald's
words that open this essay, we know that with [[this]{.mark} increased
[representation]{.mark}]{.underline} comes heightened, or at least
[[sustained,]{.mark} instances of [violence]{.mark}]{.underline}. While
2014 was named the "Trans Tipping Point" by Time magazine, this year,
[[2016, has]{.mark} counted [the highest number of trans women of color
being]{.mark} violently [murdered]{.mark} in the United
States]{.underline}. Yet, following the Johnson tape, if we are to
understand the visual itself as technologies of anti-black and
anti-trans optics, then how might we continue the important project of
representation in a visual regime hostile to black trans life?
**[[Rather than]{.mark} an [opening to]{.mark}ward [recognition]{.mark},
a position where one can make a claim instead of being exclusively
claimed, [representation for Johnson is the prefiguration of her
undoing]{.mark}.]{.underline}** Her [[being "clocked" as trans led to
her]{.mark}]{.underline} initial [[arrest]{.underline}]{.mark},
subsequent [beating, and,]{.underline} even [perhaps,]{.underline} her
[murder]{.underline}. Being clocked, or [being seen as trans,
enacts]{.underline} the double bind of recognition: **[being seen by the
other brings you into the world, but more often than not it is also that
which might bring you out of it.]{.underline}** [[Through
representation]{.underline}]{.mark}---both the CCTV video and
descriptions of Johnson in court---[[the defense
was]{.underline}]{.mark} able to produce what Judith Butler (1993) and
others have called a reversal of defense, where the party harmed is,
through the magic of the law, [transformed into the [assumed
aggressor.]{.mark}]{.underline} [**[Johnson]{.underline}**]{.mark}, and
not the state, **[[is made to hold the burden of
proof]{.mark}.]{.underline}** Tracing a genealogy of the racial and
gendered parameters of recognition from G. W. F. Hegel and Fanon to da
Silva and McDonald and beyond, how might we imagine the project of
recognition as both nondialectical and nondevelopmental? The brutal
scene of Johnson's beating, replayed as the composed testimony of the
quiet court, reminds us that [recognition is not a smooth space of
inevitability]{.underline}, even in struggle. **[[Johnson's]{.mark}
trans [identity forces us against]{.mark}]{.underline}** a substitutive
logic, to once again face **[the ways]{.underline}** race and gender, as
**[[lines of recognition, symbols, and embodied parameters, ask for
more]{.mark}.]{.underline}** While Fanon rightly turns our attention to
the limits of recognition in the colonial scene, he also maintains the
teleology of subjectivity by holding on to the dialectics of structure,
even for those deemed nonsubjects. Or, if for him revolutionary violence
offers a way through the violence of anti-black coloniality, how might
we push further on Fanon for those who must remain, as da Silva might
suggest, "no-bodies against the state"? [Johnson's attack and its
cinematic afterlife capture the structures of recognition and
misrecognition, representation and disappearance that constitute the
work of gender and race in and as the fields of the visual.]{.underline}
While writing from a place of gender self-determination that works
toward gender as an opening, what is left of our various analytics of
recognition? Or, [how might we return to the beating tape: not simply to
offer yet another way to imagine what we already know---that race,
gender, and violence are tightly bound--- but to ask how this bind might
be undone?]{.underline}4 Furthermore, what tactics of production and
sabotage might bring about visual cultures that detonate the
never-ending list of anti-trans violence? This question specifically
addresses those trapped in the interval of seeing and being
seen**[.]{.underline}** We must pose it without a fantasy of closure. To
put it another way, at the center of the problem of recognition lies
this: **[[how can we be seen without being known and]{.mark} how can we
[be known without being hunted]{.mark}?]{.underline}**5 Indeed, [[being
a "no-body against the state]{.mark},"]{.underline} a position some are
already forced to live, [[stands against]{.mark} the sovereign promise
of [positive representation]{.mark}.]{.underline} Read not as absolute
abjection but as a tactic of interdiction and direct action, **[[being a
"no-body"]{.mark} might [force the visual order of things to]{.mark} the
point of [collapse]{.mark}.]{.underline}** On the issue of recognition
and radical singularity, Édouard Glissant (1997: 190) has stated, "[from
the perspective of **[Western thought]{.mark}**, we discover that its
[**basis is this requirement for transparency**. In order to
understand]{.mark} and]{.underline} thus [accept you, [I have to measure
your solidity with the ideal scale]{.mark} providing me with grounds to
make comparisons and,]{.underline} perhaps, [judgments**. [I have to
reduce]{.mark}**]{.underline}." [This reduction]{.underline}, which
Fanon might call being overdetermined, [is]{.underline}, as we know,
[[unequally]{.mark} distributed and mandated]{.underline}. **[Glissant
offers [a totality o]{.mark}f [relation in opacity, the]{.mark} radical
[work of nontransparency]{.mark} that [allows]{.mark} for [non-
dialectic difference---the]{.mark} collectivization of [radical
singularity]{.mark}.]{.underline}** Glissant continues, "[[Agree
not]{.mark} merely [to the right of difference but]{.mark},]{.underline}
carrying this further, agree [**[also to the right of opacity]{.mark}
that is not enclosure within an impenetrable autarchy** but [subsistence
within an irreducible singularity]{.mark}]{.underline}" (190). We might
read the current order of popular trans representation to be a variation
of agreeing to the "right of difference," as transparency is the
precondition of visibility politics. [[Opacity is]{.underline}]{.mark}
here [[useful]{.mark} not necessarily as a practice of "going stealth,"
[residing]{.mark} below or [beside the regimes of being seen but not
known]{.mark},]{.underline} although it might be. For Glissant (1997:
193), **[it is [a form of solidarity without being
grasped]{.mark}.]{.underline}** Here, I am suggesting that it might be
one form a radical trans politics might take. Opacity with
representation: an irreconcilable tension that opens to something other
than the pragmatism of the transparent and its visual economies of
violence.6 There is no return and no triumphant narrative to be gleaned
here, either from the brutal attack on Johnson or her subsequent death.
[There are]{.underline}, of course, [countless instances of trans/queer
people organizing, thriving, and resisting, even in the midst of
ruthless encounters.]{.underline} Furthermore, anti- trans and
anti-black optics of the visual must be confronted, by expanding and
dangerous practices that open the frame while also doing away with its
necessity. And yet **[there is the inescapable fact that [the archive of
harm]{.mark}, dismemberment, state-sanctioned torture, and death
[is]{.mark} still [unfolding.]{.mark}]{.underline}** **[[This]{.mark}
unfolding]{.underline}**, which we might call modernity, **[[continues

Political Science, Vol. 46, No. 4 (Oct., 2002), pp. 838-855, The
Consequences of Cross-Cutting Networks for Political Participation \|zH

**[The second possible reason that [cross-cutting]{.mark} political
networks would [discourage political participation]{.mark} is
[because]{.mark} cross-cutting [networks]{.mark} [create the need to be
ac- countable]{.mark} to conflicting constituencies.]{.underline}**
According to this social psychological mechanism, **[the problem is not
that one is internally conflicted over which side to support, but rather
that [one feels uncomfortable taking sides]{.mark} in the face of
multiple competing constituencies. The need for social accountability
creates anxiety because interpersonal [disagreement threatens social
relationships]{.mark}, [and there is no way to]{.mark} please all
members of one\'s network and thus [assure]{.mark} social
[harmony]{.mark}.]{.underline}** As Green, Visser, and **[Tetlock
suggest, \"[The decision maker is]{.mark} caught in the middle, [pushed
one way]{.mark} by part of the group, [and pulled the other way by an
opposing faction]{.mark}. [The individual is forced to defend a]{.mark}
position in what may be perceived as a [\'no win\' situation]{.mark}, in
which one side will inevitably be alienated\" (2000, 4). If this
mechanism alone were at work, we would expect mainly public forms of
political participation to be affected]{.underline}**; in private
situations such as the voting booth, cross-cutting networks should pose
few problems due to social accountability. **[Qualitative evidence in
support of the idea that people avoid politics as a means of maintaining
interpersonal social harmony has been around for some
time.]{.underline}** In the mid 1950s, **[Rosenberg (1954-55), noted in
his in- depth interviews that [the threat to]{.mark} interpersonal
[harmony was a significant deterrent to political
activity]{.mark}.]{.underline}** More recent case studies have provided
further support for this thesis. In her study of New England town meet-
ings and an alternative workplace, Mansbridge (1980) similarly observed
that conflict avoidance was an important deterrent to political
participation (see also Eliasoph 1998**[). In their focus group
discussions, Conover and Searing (1998) also found considerable evidence
that people were both aware of and wary of the risks of political
discussion for interpersonal relationships. As one of their focus group
participants put it,]{.underline}** \"It\'s not worth it\... to try and
have an open discussion if it gets them \[other citizens\] upset\"
(1998,25). Verba and Nie (1972) applied a similar logic to their
analysis of political participation in which activities were
differentiated not only on the basis of the extent of initia- tive
required, and the scope of the outcome, but also on the extent to which
conflict with others was involved. Moreover, in a recent analysis of
national survey data, **[Ulbig and Funk (1999) found that individual
differences in conflict avoidance were negatively related to political
participation of some kinds, [particularly]{.mark} more public
participatory [acts such as protesting, working on a campaign, and
political discussion.]{.mark}2 The idea that conflict avoidance
discourages participation is also consistent with social psychological
research on how people handle nonpolitical interpersonal disagreements.
[When a person confronted with a difference of opinion does not
shift]{.mark} to the other person\'s views [or persuade]{.mark} them to
adopt his or her own views, [the]{.mark} most likely
[alternative]{.mark} reaction [is to devalue the issue
itself]{.mark}]{.underline}** (e.g., 2Research on the \"spiral of
silence\" similarly contends that perceived minority status will affect
political preferences by discour- aging the expression of political
viewpoints that are perceived to be unpopular (Noelle-Neumann 1974).
However, in this case political discussion is the dependent, rather than
the independent variable. But if one considers discussion as a form of
political participation, the spiral of silence can be interpreted as
suggesting that fear of interpersonal conflict inhibits participation,
as also shown by Ulbig and Funk (1999). Nonetheless, the hypothesis that
perceived support for one\'s opinions in the broader political
environment relates to willingness to speak out publicly has received
very limited support to date (see Glynn, Hayes, and Shanahan 1997).
Steiner 1966). **[[By devaluing politics]{.mark} and avoiding political
controversy, [people]{.mark} effectively [resolve the
problem]{.mark}]{.underline}**. **[In [a]{.mark} recent
[experiment]{.mark} [manipulating exposure to arguments on opposite
si]{.mark}des of an issue, as well as whether subjects were accountable
to conflicting or unified constituencies, Green, Visser, and Tetlock
(2000) [found]{.mark} that]{.underline}** **[[cross-pres- sured subjects
engaged]{.mark} [in]{.mark} many decision-evasion tactics (including
buckpassing, [procrastination, and exiting]{.mark} the situation) in
order to avoid accountability to contradic- tory
constituencies]{.underline}**. **[If we generalize these findings
outside the laboratory, [we would expect]{.mark} [those]{.mark}
[with]{.mark} high levels of [cross-cutting exposure]{.mark} in their
personal networks [to put off political decisions]{.mark} as long as
possible or altogether, thus [making]{.mark} their [political
participation]{.mark} particularly [unlikely]{.mark}]{.underline}**. In
the analyses that follow, I first examine to what extent cross-cutting
exposure within social networks does, in fact, have adverse implications
for political participation of various kinds. Second, I evaluate the
extent to which these two proposed processes of influence intrapersonal
ambivalence and interpersonal social accountability account for the
overall impact of network diversity on political participation.

Johnson is gone, but the tape remains. How might we read, or radically
misread, the visual grammar of the tape to understand both the kinds of

You can use a lot of the stuff from black framework and just, your aff
to heg offense against this argument. Go for stuff like "announcing our
aff k2 solvency", as well as arguments like Louisville proving solvency
for leftist affs creating change.

## Method Debate Good

#### 2. [Left v Left debate is good\--]{.underline}makes us better decision-makers around leftist politics, key to leftist advocacy skills and political planning.

Davis, A. Y., & Barat, F. (2016). Freedom is a constant struggle:
Ferguson, Palestine, and the foundations of a movement. Chicago, IL:
Haymarket Books.

**[[What can we do? How can we do it? With whom? What tactics should be
used? How should we define a strategy that is accessible to everyone,
including a general public that has reached levels of depoliticization
that can make atrocities seem acceptable? What is our vision?]{.mark}
How can we make sure "we" are talking to "everyone"? How can we catalyze
and connect sustainable, cross-border, and radical
movements?]{.underline}** **[[These are the]{.underline}]{.mark}** types
of **[[questions]{.underline}]{.mark}** that many **[[activists
ask]{.underline}]{.mark}** themselves on a daily basis, questions that
are anchored in the present and will shape our future. **[[It is easy to
feel discouraged and simply let go.]{.underline}]{.mark}** There is no
shame in that. We are, after all, engaged in a struggle that seems, if
we look at it using a mainstream political framework and through a mass
media prism, unwinnable. On the other hand**[[, if
we]{.underline}]{.mark}** take a step back**[[, look at]{.mark} things
from [a broader angle]{.mark}]{.underline}**, reflecting on **[[what is
happening all over the world and the history of
struggle]{.underline}]{.mark}**, the history of solidarity movements, it
becomes clear, sometimes even obvious, that **[[seemingly indestructible
forces can be,]{.underline}]{.mark}** **[thanks to]{.underline}**
people's willpower, sacrifices, and **[actions, easily
[broken]{.mark}]{.underline}**. When I first thought of producing a book
with Angela Davis, my **[[main goal]{.underline}]{.mark}** was to talk
about our struggle **[[as activists]{.mark}. [To try to
define]{.mark}]{.underline}** it **[[in real and concrete
terms]{.underline}]{.mark}**. To try to understand what it means to
people engaged in it. Where and how does it start? Does it ever end?
What are the essential foundations for building a movement? What does it
mean physically, philosophically, and psychologically?
