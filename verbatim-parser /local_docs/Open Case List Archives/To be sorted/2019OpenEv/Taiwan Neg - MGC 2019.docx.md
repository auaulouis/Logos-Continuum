It was a very forceful reminder of just how sensitive an issue Taiwan is
for the Chinese government. The very word "Taiwan" is guaranteed to
bristle with any official as I, in my own small way, discovered. Now Xi
Jinping has once again raised the issue, on the 40th anniversary of a
landmark "message to compatriots" that urged Taiwan to embark upon
peaceful reunification. The president was conciliatory -- but, as has
long been the case, he refused to rule out military action if Beijing's
ambitions are rudely thwarted by a declaration of independence
from Taiwan. This matters more than most distant territorial scraps
because it is part of a long list of Chinese geopolitical grievances.
Though its support of Taiwan is far weaker than it used to be, America
is still the guarantor of Taiwan's security and is therefore a third
party in the dispute[. President Trump's trade war with
China]{.underline} (and a complex range of territorial waters disputes
with, among others, the Philippines, Vietnam, Japan and Malaysia) also
[adds to the tensions, and they have started to fester and feed upon
each othe]{.underline}r. **[The obvious answer is for President Trump
and President Xi to settle all these matters with a "grand
bargain".]{.underline}** [The outlines of this are already clear: the
prize for Beijing is reunification, and the US should usher Taiwan
towards reunification under the "one nation, two systems"
mode]{.underline}l proposed by China. This model was broadly followed
when Hong Kong and Macau were handed back by Britain and Portugal in the
1990s. It would be a fine thing for the Chinese president to present to
his people on the 70th anniversary of the revolution this year[. In
return, China should stop manipulating its currency and distorting its
economy, and eliminate its still vast trade surplus with the US to
trivial level]{.underline}s. [It should also settle up its more
outrageous claims to the seas around its coastline. Chuck in some
environmental initiatives]{.underline} (which would also level the
economic playing field), [a clampdown on intellectual property theft and
some reduction in China's neocolonial activities in Africa, and the
world could be a much safer, more prosperous place]{.underline}. As
Nixon and Henry Kissinger recognised half a century ago[, it would also
reset the balance of power away from the other global superpower,
Russia.]{.underline} [With strong leaders -- and Trump and Xi at least
qualify as that -- **such a deal is surely possible**. Moreover, the
Chinese claim to Taiwan is difficult to argue with. Taiwan is simply a
post Cold War anomaly. China's offer was perfectly clear
and fair]{.underline} -- especially if Taiwan is accepted to be part of
China, as it has long been (and as the Taiwanese government once used to
so violently insist[). Xi said, for example: "On the basis of ensuring
China's sovereignty, security and interests of development, the social
system and way of life in Taiwan will be fully respected, and the
private property, religious beliefs and legitimate rights and interests
of Taiwan compatriots will be fully protected after peaceful
reunification is realised.]{.underline}" More ominously, and as ever,
there is a threat: "We make no promise to renounce the use of force and
reserve the option of taking all necessary means." Taiwan has soured
relations between the west and Beijing since 1949, when Mao won the
civil war and his opponents, the Kuomintang, fled to a few offshore
islands, the largest of which was Taiwan, itself recently occupied by
imperial Japan[.]{.underline} It is rather as if a bunch of renegades in
the English Civil War in the seventeenth century wound up on the Isle of
Wight and declared themselves the sole legitimate government of the
entire nation. Having failed in that quixotic enterprise, they now wish
to declare themselves independent. That is, more or less, what is
happening in Taiwan. [It is getting a bit ridiculous, and it is
maddening the Chinese government. Increasingly anachronistic, Taiwan
-- even now formally known as the Republic of China -- used to claim
sovereignty over the entire nation, and was backed in its claim by a
belligerent America.]{.underline} The US refused to recognise even the
existence of "Red China" until president Richard Nixon, the former Cold
War warrior, made his historic trip to the People's Republic in 1972 and
president Jimmy Carter normalised diplomatic relations with Beijing in
1979. [The PRC then also displaced Taiwan on the UN Security Council.
Since then, the Taiwanese have been slowly losing the diplomatic and,
for that matter, the economic battle with a reforming, growing
China]{.underline}. In the Mao era, China was an economic pygmy; today
its economy is the largest in the world, if you remove the distortions
of exchange rates. It is bigger than America and Germany combined, seven
times bigger than Britain, and 20 times larger than Taiwan. The People's
Army has a million soldiers. It has 260 nuclear warheads. Diplomacy has
to take some account of these towering realities. The irony is that
where once "Nationalist" [Taiwan used to stress the unity of China and
its claim of sovereignty over the entire territory, it is now Beijing
that is anxious to reassert its claim of sovereignty over Taiwan, while
many Taiwanese want formal independence]{.underline}. Referring to
recent setbacks for her party, the president of Taiwan, Tsai Ing-wen,
now declares: "I must emphasise that the election results absolutely do
not mean that grassroots public opinion in Taiwan favours abandoning our
sovereignty, nor do they mean that the people want to make concessions
regarding Taiwanese identity." No -- but they would like their economy
to start growing again, and the obvious answer to that is economic
reunification with the mainland. The election of a female president in
Taiwan in 2016 from a party that couldn't have existed for most of
Taiwan's history in the one-party state run by the Kuomintang highlights
the big new barrier to Chinese reunification. This is the second irony:
this is no longer a tussle between opposing authoritarian ideologies --
communist dictatorship China vs capitalist dictatorship China, as Taiwan
is now a full democracy and China is no longer fully communist[. It does
feel bad to be abandoning a proper democracy such as Taiwan. Yet China's
overwhelming military and economic superiority in the region does,
indeed, as President Xi implies, mean that **reunification is
inevitable.** History proves that the most successful diplomatic
initiatives, the ones that seem so bold and innovative at the time,
are merely the acceptance of the inevitable:]{.underline} Nixon's
historic mission to China itself; the release of Nelson Mandela and a
multi-racial South Africa; the existence of the state of Israel; the end
of the British Empire and its transformation into a Commonwealth; the
collapse of the USSR. These moments in history all required transforming
a kind of defeat into a victory. Xi Jinping plainly sees this, and
perhaps the authorities in Taiwan too[. If only we could be confident
that Trump is also willing to accept realit]{.underline}y. There seems
to be a growing mood of hawkishness towards China in the US
administration -- a hostile speech by US vice president Mike Pence last
year being a prominent example. [Western security services fret about
the power of Chinese companies such as Huawei, and arrest its
executives. It is, frankly, getting very dangerous. Time for a Xi-Trump
summit, and a "grand bargain]{.underline}". If Trump can do it with
North Korea, why not China?

[A 'grand bargain' is based on the notion that coexistence among states
(and especially major powers) is built upon reciprocal commitments, or
fundamental political compromises]{.underline}, which allow some form of
strategic exchange and interdependence to develop. Between great powers,
grand bargains in their most advanced form must entail some form of
negotiated constraints to their exercise of power. Grand bargains
basically involve implicit or explicit agreement about the mutually
acceptable terms on which peaceful relations can be conducted. These
include understandings about recognition and status, mutual rights and
responsibilities, mutual spheres of influence, terms of exchange and
conditions of restraint[. It is on this basis that scholars sometimes
argue that the United States and China, or China and Japan, will need to
negotiate a grand bargain between themselves and even with other key
states in East Asia for regional security and stability to
prevail]{.underline}.6 In general[, the big advantage of a 'bargain'
approach]{.underline} to understanding and influencing great power
[relations is its innate relationality: the reciprocal and transactional
assumptions underpinning bargains obliges us to examine and try to
reconcile the preferences]{.underline}, goals and tactics of each of the
parties involved. [This sits in contrast to the one-sided notions of
containment or appeasement that often seem to dominate debates about how
to respond to China's rise,]{.underline} for example. Thinking about
bargains involves taking seriously what the other side wants and values.
[Moreover, a grand bargain approach helps us to grasp the complexity of
international orders.]{.underline} On the one hand, it connotes linkage
across issue areas (as Glaser suggests). [But it also crucially entails
a systemic perspective beyond bilateral relationships; for instance, a
grand bargain lens should additionally allow us to probe the broader
regional and historical contexts that clearly affect the attractiveness,
viability and scope of any putative new US--China bargain]{.underline}

Returning to North-East Asia, the ideational, domestic political and
strategic complexities that many scholars so vividly underscore on the
US side are replicated on China's part. [First]{.underline} (and perhaps
helpfully for anyone inclined to propose new bargains), [the idea of
strategic bargains comes naturally to many Chinese foreign policy
interlocutors and their counterparts]{.underline}. For example, both
China and Japan see the recent intensification of their territorial
dispute in the East China Sea as resulting from the other side reneging
on their 1972 normalization agreement to set aside the dispute: the
Chinese perceive Tokyo to have reneged on it in 2012 when the Noda
Government bought the Senkaku Islands, while the Japanese see Beijing as
having reneged earlier in the 2000s by significantly New Directions in
Strategic Thinking 2.0 60 increasing paramilitary and military
operations in the area and allowing more aggressive forms of
confrontation on the ground. In the South China Sea too, the Chinese see
then Secretary of State Hillary Clinton's 2010 diplomatic intervention
in publicly criticizing Chinese assertiveness as reneging on US
professions of neutrality, while many Americans viewed reports of
Chinese pronouncements about the area as a 'core interest' as evidence
of an expanding Chinese sphere of claimed influence reneging on
professions of 'peaceful rise'[. Second, there is a Chinese discourse
considering what a strategic bargain with the United States might look
like, particularly since talk of a 'G2' and since President Xi Jinping
introduced his notion of 'a new model of major power
relations']{.underline}. In a fairly typical liberal vein, [Wu Xinbo
argues that 'it is time for China and the United States to try to reach
an understanding on the evolving regional architecture through candid
dialogue']{.underline}, one encompassing 'more equal relations between
the two sides of the Pacific'.20 The theme of a more equal exchange is
echoed in a recent Shanghai Academy of Social Sciences project on
US--China relations, [which states that China would support a 'positive
leadership role' for the United States if the latter would also support
a 'more positive and vigorous role in East Asia' that 'leaves more room
for maneuver for China in terms of claiming territorial rights and
military development']{.underline}. Specifically, the United States
needs to 'recognize China's sovereignty claims within its historical
rights', 'avoid getting involved in the territorial disputes between
China and its neighbors', and 'should never interfere militarily in the
disputes and crises between China and its neighbors'.21 At least one
Chinese scholar, Shi Yinhong, has explicitly discussed what a more equal
bargain between China and the United States would look like at a broader
grand strategic level. His proposition is for a 'peaceful "final
settlement"' based on 'selective preponderance' in complementary
realms.22 [The United States would accept China's leading position in
Asia based on its superior economic size, trade volume and regional. The
prospects for a Great Power 'grand bargain' in East Asia influence;
mutual deterrence based on China having military parity and even
marginal superiority in China's offshore areas (with Taiwan's eastern
shore being the 'prudent' line); peaceful reunification of Taiwan with
the mainland; and China 'maintaining strategic space in a substantial
but still narrow span of the western Pacifi]{.underline}c'[. In return,
China would accept US overall military superiority globally and in the
central and western Pacific, and preponderant US influence in other
world regions.]{.underline}

#### To solve for a net benefit of US/China War, or Taiwan/China/US War, here are the seven steps to truly solve this. From a United States Task Force on US/China Relations. Maybe it would have planks, maybe we could use Climate Change to connect with China as it states in Part 5.

**[First, the United States should publicly call out Chinese practices
and firmly stand against China when it conducts itself in ways harmful
to U.S. interests]{.underline}**, even if responding comes with economic
costs to ourselves. However, decisive action against Chinese conduct
should always be accompanied by a clear set of achievable demands. And
as the United States responds, the measures taken should always be
carefully designed to protect specific U.S. interests, not used simply
as a form of retaliation or competition for their own sake, or for
political grandstanding. **[Second, the United States should avoid
adopting exclusionary policies that irreversibly delink the two
economies and societies]{.underline}**. While there will sometimes be a
clear national security case for maintaining production capabilities in
specific sectors inside the U.S[., destroying global production chains
and seeking to replace them with two rival economic blocs, at this stage
of the relationship, would not only hinder our own economy and
innovation ecosystem, but also make China more of a possible security
threat by reducing the U.S. economic leverage on i]{.underline}t.
**[Third, in competing with China, we should always strike a judicious
balance between protecting national security and preserving our own open
society]{.underline}**. The United States [must avoid overreactions to
perceived China threats that could trigger an anti-Chinese "red
scare.]{.underline}" We should beware the dangers of repeating the
mistakes of the McCarthy era by casting unfair suspicion on all ethnic
Chinese and others who have close ties with China**[. Fourth, the United
States should pursue cooperation with China on those global and regional
issues where it is clearly in our national interest to do so and where
China is willing.]{.underline}** In the past, [China has voluntarily
collaborated with the United States on such critical areas as climate
change, preservation of the oceans, fighting pandemics, developing
third-country infrastructure investment, counter-terrorism, and nuclear
non-proliferation]{.underline} in North Korea and Iran. Washington
should continue to seek to engage Beijing to work with us on both these
areas and new ones such as the global refugee crisis. One area where the
Trump administration has been particularly remiss is climate change.
During the Obama administration, the U.S. and China had, after many
years of trying, finally developed a very constructive collaboration on
many aspects of the climate challenge. The Paris Climate Accord involved
an historic moment of cooperation to address a major shared global
challenge. It also provided an ongoing forum in which the United States
could cooperate with China on a critical common problem, a very real
threat to our planet. [Regrettably, the United States has now withdrawn
from the climate accord, abandoning not only the best current effort to
mitigate this daunting global challenge, but also dismantling one of the
most fruitful areas of joint United StatesChina
collaboration]{.underline}. **[Fifth, in seeking to induce positive
changes in Chinese behavior, the United States should enhance its
coordination with friends and allies rather than act
alone]{.underline}**. Whenever possible, the United States must operate
on the basis of established multilateral agreements and principles that
are shared by allies and friends, fortifying them and using them as the
focal points for joint action. And because of the political backlash
against China's increasingly assertive posture abroad, there may be new
opportunities for concerted action**[. Sixth, the United States should
neither stop advocating for its own liberal democratic values, nor
surrender hope that many Chinese share these values]{.underline}**. A
deeply rooted liberal tradition exists in China, even if it has been
temporarily forced into quiescence by the present resurgence of
authoritarian controls[. But it is far from dead, and its suffocation by
the party leaves many Chinese intellectuals quietly
chafing.]{.underline} We should not forget that the party's dictatorial
rule has always waxed and waned and that the tolerance of the urban
middle class for repression could well weaken as economic growth slows.
Moreover, we would forget at our peril the ways in which China has
unpredictably changed in the past and will certainly do so again in the
future. [Finally, our best defense will always be to be a better version
of our own democratic selves]{.underline}. In this new era of growing
competition, the United States must protect and strengthen our own
innate advantages. [These include both our soft- and hard-power assets.
So, even as we maintain our hard-power assets, we must also reaffirm our
own commitments to a free and open society, an effective democracy, a
dynamic economy, greater investment in education and research,
consistent support for a vibrant civil society, and a commitment to
rebuilding our nation's infrastructure]{.underline}. These societal
strengths will be fundamental to America's international leadership and
its national security and will undergird our ability to compete with an
increasingly challenging China.

Although China's rise has inevitably increased frictions, engagement has
helped avoid potentially disastrous US---China confrontation by giving
China a continuing stake in the relationship with the US and its
neighbors. [**It is in China's interest to work with the US** because
China is far from the position to step into America's shoes as a
hegemonic power and take the role of global leadershi]{.underline}p.
[Global leadership is costly; it means asking people to contribute to
others' well-being and send soldiers to die far from home. Seeking
reform of global governance, Beijing has yet to mount serious responses
to global problem]{.underline}s, such as the refugee crisis or Syria's
civil war. China's rise is not necessarily America's decline. [While it

nevertheless, benefited immensely from the US-led order underpinning
stability and prosperity in the region]{.underline}. Beijing has already
paid a price for its confrontational policy alienating the US. China
would benefit from friendly rather than hostile relations with the US
and nations on its borders**[. It is not in China's interest to escalate
tensions with the US]{.underline}** [also because a Sino-American
showdown may risk dooming China's economic transition and political
stability]{.underline}. After remarkable GDP growth for many years,
China has experienced difficult transition from reliance on low-cost
manufacturing and exporting products to high-tech innovations and
consumption-driven economy. [Beijing has made clear that it does not
want to fight the trade war that would harm the Chinese economy much
more than the American economy]{.underline}. No alternative is as big
and lucrative as the American market for China's export. In addition,
China's tight import control has hurt not only American producers but
also Chinese consumers. [Ordinary Chinese would welcome reduced import
tariffs, which means cheaper foreign products and services for the
average Chinese consumers]{.underline} \[Xie 2018\].

## Recognize Taiwan

Support in Washington for the idea of abandoning Taiwan is a mistake.
The United States should recognize it.

The chorus of opinion leaders and pundits in the United States calling
for Washington's "abandonment" of Taiwan is getting louder, a symptom of
a growing, but false, perception in the U.S. that China holds the key to
all of Washington's problems. This isn't only a dangerous misreading of
Beijing's intentions, but also reflects a lack of public understanding
about Taiwan's sovereign status. **[Unification]{.underline}** --- by
force if necessary --- **[with Taiwan is a top priority for
Beijing]{.underline}**. Yet, although relations between Taipei and
Beijing have thawed in recent years under President Ma Ying-jeou's
administration, **[[Chinese military capabilities and missile
deployments across the Strait have not only increased with growing
sophistication and lethality, but Beijing's military ambitions have
extended beyond the Strait]{.underline}]{.mark}**. The arguments coming
from the abandon-Taiwan camp were taken to a new low by a New York Times
op-ed piece last month titled "To Save Our Economy, Ditch Taiwan." In
the article, the author expresses the hope that if the U.S. were to
"give up" Taiwan, Beijing would accommodate Washington's interests ---
to the point that Beijing would write off \$1.14 trillion of
Washington's debt and halt its support for Iran, North Korea, Syria and
Pakistan. The writer's argument depends on his assumption that the
current cross-strait "status quo" is unsustainable. In other words,
Taiwan's absorption by China is inevitable and therefore the U.S. should
ditch Taiwan. His assertion misses an important fact:
**[[Taiwan]{.mark}, under its existing constitutional framework, [exists
as an independent, sovereign state. The absence of official diplomatic
relations does not negate this objective
reality]{.mark}]{.underline}**[. **[If Washington were to revoke the
terms of the T]{.underline}**]{.mark}**[aiwan [R]{.mark}elations
[A]{.mark}ct, [the U.S. would essentially be condoning the absorption of
one state by another state]{.mark}]{.underline}**. However, neither the
Chinese Nationalist Party (KMT) nor the Democratic Progressive Party
would ever subjugate the Republic of China/Taiwan to Chinese Communist
Party rule. The partisan political environment in Taipei doesn't serve
Taiwan's national interests when political parties vilify their
opponents' position to the extreme. However, partisan bickering is a
facet of every multiparty democracy. And the U.S., of all places, should
understand how democracies work. Moreover, **[[if Beijing wants to
genuinely engage in political dialogue with Taiwan, then it should do so
with dignity by first accepting that it is engaging another sovereign
government.]{.mark} This is the only way to build cross-strait political
trust]{.underline}**. **[[As Washington moves to re-establish its
presence]{.mark} and develop comprehensive ties with the Asia-Pacific
region, [the need for clarity on Taiwan's sovereignty will become an
important factor for perceptions of the United States' staying power in
the region]{.mark}]{.underline}**. U.S. Assistant Secretary of State
Kurt Campbell stated at a House of Representatives hearing earlier this
year [that **[how the United States manages the U.S.-Taiwan relationship
"will have a great impact on the way our partners view us across the
Asia-Pacific region]{.underline}**]{.mark}." **[Ambiguity from
Washington over Taiwan's sovereignty would only embolden Beijing's
claims.]{.underline}** If some are proposing the "abandonment" of
Taiwan, then an equally radical solution should be on the table. **[To
clear any doubt about U.S. commitment to the Asia-Pacific and check
Beijing's wanderlust, [Washington should recognize that
Taiwa]{.mark}n]{.underline}**, under its existing constitutional
framework, [**[is an independent, sovereign state]{.underline}**.
**[This]{.underline}**]{.mark} would be a **[bold move by
Washington]{.underline}** that [**[would help create the conditions for
negotiations on equal footing and facilitate enduring peace and
stability across the Taiwan Strait and the Asia-Pacific
region]{.underline}**.]{.mark}

Regarding the third potential crisis-generator --- China's aggressive
actions in the South China Sea --- nothing was said publicly by either
capital during or after the Florida meeting. China's militarization of
its artificial islands continued apace. [Trump was uncharacteristically
silent on the subject, but his actions spoke louder than
words]{.underline}. He unleashed the U.S. Navy to conduct full-fledged
freedom of navigation operations to challenge China's illegal
territorial claims, a contrast to the Obama administration's
watered-down innocent passages. **[Now it is time for the president also
to address two other matters long-neglected by his predecessors, both
affecting the security of Taiwan]{.underline}**. [The first is the
question of arms sales to Taiwan]{.underline}, administration action
mandated by the Taiwan Relations Act (TRA) of 1979. Passage of the TRA
by veto-proof margins reflected congressional anger at the Carter
administration's severing diplomatic relations with Taipei in favor of
Beijing and termination of the U.S.-Taiwan Mutual Defense Treaty. [Ever
since, Congress has pushed successive administrations to fulfill U.S.
legal obligations to sell Taiwan the weapons it needs to defend itself
against Chinese aggression. The executive branch has often demurred,
delayed, and denied Taiwan's requests, sometimes for good reason, such
as inadequate strategic planning, technical proficiency, or committed
funding.]{.underline} But [every sale]{.underline}, no matter how large
or how advanced the weaponry involved, [inevitably meets with fierce
opposition from the People's Republic]{.underline}, [threatening to
jeopardize the entire U.S.-China relationship. And Washington,
ever-sensitive to Beijing's moods, has been on the defensive about
Taiwan's defensive arms.]{.underline} That was particularly true of the
Obama administration, which shelved a package of essential arms that had
long been pending. Now the Trump team is reported to be putting together
an even more robust arms deal but is delaying its announcement for fear
of [interrupting]{.underline} [China's promised help with North Korea.
The problem is that despite its rhetoric, Beijing, again, is not
delivering]{.underline}, and [Pyongyang knows it still has China's
indulgence to move ahead with its weapons programs. Trump should show
China that he cannot be strung along and approve the Taiwan arms sale
expeditiously.]{.underline} While he is at it, [the president should
correct a decades-long mistake in U.S. policy: the unwillingness to
state forthrightly that America will defend its democratic ally against
any aggressive moves by China]{.underline}. [That means abandoning the
outdated doctrine of strategic ambiguity, which states that we might or
might not defend Taiwan "depending on the circumstances."]{.underline}
Since 1995, when the official equivocation was explicitly declared by
the State Department as a cautionary amber light, China has read it
instead as an inviting green light to build up its surface and
underwater fleets and ballistic missile arsenal to create "the
circumstances" that would keep the United States away from a
cross-strait conflict. [The Chinese deterrent strategy, known as
anti-access and area denial, shows signs of working:]{.underline} [if
Washington is reluctant to do all it can to help Taiwan defend itself,
why should Beijing expect that the United States will itself step
directly into the fray? Only a straightforward declaration by the U.S.
president will convince China of that commitment]{.underline}. [Donald
Trump is the one best positioned to provide China, Taiwan, the region,
and the world with the strategic clarity that this Asian flashpoint
requires.]{.underline}

[It is notable how far the United States has backslidden from its
commitment to a peaceful resolution to allowing Beijing to strangle
Taiwan slowly, while still [carefully framing its actions so as not to
upset
Beijing](https://www.navytimes.com/news/your-navy/2016/09/26/white-house-tells-the-pentagon-to-quit-talking-about-competition-with-china/).
Beijing holds no such scruples]{.underline}. Indeed[, it appears the
"peaceful" solution the Chinese Communist Party seeks is to facilitate
Taiwan's isolation and collapse]{.underline}. The PRC only fears
consequences and its continued hostility shows it sees few coming. But
[the stakes are far higher than simple U.S. credibility]{.underline}.
[If the United States allows the PRC to bully and destroy Taiwan, it
sets the precedent that power is to be used by larger nations to
dominate smaller ones]{.underline}. In a callous world it may be true
that might makes right, but this is not the world the architects of the
international system left to us, nor is it a world compatible with a
strong America. [The United States and its many allies uphold a system
in which strength is used to prevent domination. It does not dismiss

One China, Two Systems? The United States, for its part, has for 40
years tried to thread the needle between appeasing China and backing
Taiwan's independence in all but name. Under the naïve leadership of
[President Jimmy
Carter,](https://theweichertreport.com/2018/08/31/jimmy-carter-the-indecisive-hawk/)
U.S. policy shifted away from active support of Taiwanese independence.
Instead, Carter
[embraced](https://www.ait.org.tw/our-relationship/policy-history/key-u-s-foreign-policy-documents-region/u-s-prc-joint-communique-1979/)
the Chinese concept of ["One China, Two
Systems."](https://www.hongkongfp.com/2019/04/13/swap-freedom-one-country-two-systems-myth-world-must-support-brave-taiwan/)This
was a shocking giveaway to Beijing, trading real leverage for empty
rhetoric. Ever since, Taiwan has existed in a precarious diplomatic gray
zone: it is neither totally sovereign nor subordinate to China. What's
more, China has been emboldened to wage a ceaseless, decades-long
economic war upon the United States. "[One China, Two Systems" is a lie.
There is only one China, with its Communist system, and one Taiwan, with
its democracy.]{.underline} Given 40 years of history, China wouldn't
expect the United States to be so bold so suddenly---even with a
disruptor like Donald Trump in the White House. In the past, the Chinese
have said Americans would be unwilling to trade Los Angeles for
Taipei---a thinly veiled warning that Beijing would respond to
U.S.-backed Taiwanese independence with nuclear weapons. Nuclear Perils

[China certainly poses [a serious nuclear
threat](https://nationalinterest.org/blog/buzz/why-you-should-fear-chinas-nuclear-weapons-56212)]{.underline}.
Beijing has spent much time and effort building its ["underground Great
Wall,"](https://jamestown.org/program/chinas-underground-great-wall-and-nuclear-deterrence/)
an intricate, 3,107-mile system of concrete tunnels where the Chinese
store and transport an unknown number of nuclear weapons. [And
certainly, China would increase its military brinkmanship. **But China
would also have to contend with the judgment of the world as its leaders
make short-sighted decisions in competition with the United States.**
And what would the United States do?]{.underline} [Until recently, our
options were limited]{.underline}. U.S. missile defenses are sparse. But
[what we do have is deterrence. It should come as no surprise that China

and so has pursued its mid-range missile program unhindered. [Today, as

Taiwan as a separate state from China---privy to all of the same

described Taiwan as an "unsinkable aircraft carrier." [From the U.S.
perspective, the island provides an advantageous geostrategic position
for American and allied forces to undermine China's hegemonic grand
strategy]{.underline}. Lose that, and China has the ability to push
beyond its maritime borders and threaten Japan, the Philippines, and
other distant places. For their part, the leaders of Taiwan have long
abandoned the pretense that theirs is the only legitimate government of
China and favored independence from their larger, authoritarian
neighbor. As the great Chinese strategist Sun Tzu once said, "Let your
plans be dark and impenetrable as night, and when you move, fall like a
thunderbolt." If Trump were to suddenly announce a complete
reorganization of America's defense posture in northeastern Asia, the
Chinese would be off-balance. [America's goal is to either force China
to comport with a "rules-based order"]{.underline} (which is unlikely[)
or to weaken China so much that it cannot threaten the U.S.-led
international order any longer. Recognizing Taiwanese independence would
completely upend the Chinese position]{.underline}. Consider, too, [if
the United States announced that it would most]{.underline}---if not
all---[of its forces from South Korea and reposition them in Taiwan,
this might also prompt Kim Jong-un to seek accommodation with the West
rather than continue to let himself be used as China's
pawn.]{.underline} Each time tensions between China and the United
States increase, North Korea has conveniently been stirred into taking
action that distracts Washington from dealing more forcefully with
Beijing. At some point, Kim will want to remove himself from China's
vice-grip and secure his own interests. Right now, [the Chinese are
convinced they can weather the Trump trade storm. But as Trump said in

Consequently, there is a risk that Beijing planners and decision-makers
might determine they could launch a successful offensive against Taiwan.
That perception in Beijing makes aggression in the strait and a war with
the United States more likely. The bipartisan National Defense Strategy
Commission listed aggression against Taiwan as a top concern, arguing
that [allowing China to absorb Taiwan by military force would constitute
a "**crushing blow to America's credibility and regional
position."**]{.underline} In addition to genuine hard-power concerns,
[there is also a matter of principle. When an authoritarian power
threatens and bullies a democratic people, America is not
neutral]{.underline}. Furthermore, [providing Taiwan the means to defend
itself is not just consistent with sound policy and good principle ---
it is the law.]{.underline} The Taiwan Relations Act made clear that the
establishment of diplomatic relations with Beijing rested on the
expectation that the future of Taiwan would be "determined by peaceful
means." [To make this a reality, the law says the U.S. will provide the
weapons "necessary to enable Taiwan to maintain a sufficient
self-defense capability."]{.underline} Admittedly, successive U.S.
administrations have interpreted and implemented this rather vague
statute differently. However, [what seems clear is that Taiwan's ability
to defend itself against an increasingly belligerent and capable
military threat from the mainland is in doubt]{.underline}. That would
suggest that the current arms package under consideration is not only
permissible and advisable under the law, but essential. [The
administration deserves credit for expanding freedom of navigation
operations in the Taiwan Strait and, at least initially, asking Congress
to support new arms sales to Taiwan]{.underline}. Those are good first
steps, but they are not enough. In addition to providing these arms
without delay and stopping the erosion of U.S. military superiority
vis-a-vis China, [**Washington should also provide Taiwan the fighter
aircraft and other weapons it needs to make Beijing think twice before
undertaking aggression in the strait**.]{.underline} In its report this
month, [the Pentagon reiterated the U.S. commitment to Taiwan's
self-defense, invoking the words of the Taiwan Relations
Act.]{.underline} Those are good words. But in any potential
conversation with President Xi this week, [President Trump would do well
to remember that it will take more than words to deter aggression from
the bullies in Beijing.]{.underline}

LLP, an international law firm." Forget Pete Buttigieg. **[The mayor
with a real shot at a presidency is]{.underline}**n't
**[in]{.underline}** Indiana but **[Taiwan]{.underline}**. **[Han
Kuo-yu, the newly minted Kuomintang (KMT) mayor of Kaohsiung, Taiwan,
attracted fervent crowds on his tour of the United States this month. He
was topping the polls for the 2020 presidency at home]{.underline}**,
where political watchers saw a U.S. grand tour to be a precursor to a
presidential campaign. **[But just as Han's momentum seemed unstoppable,
Terry Gou, Taiwan's richest man]{.underline}** with an estimated net
worth of \$7.6 billion, **[announced that he would join the KMT's
presidential primary]{.underline}**. **[Since Han has indicated that he
won't join the primary, the KMT will have to decide between a coronation
for Gou or resorting to a special procedure for enlisting
Han.]{.underline}** Gou is taking a page out of the playbook of Donald
Trump, with whom he maintains a personal relationship, and was
reportedly inspired by Han's surprising electoral victory in Kaohsiung
in November 2018. If either Gou or Han leads the KMT to a victory at the
presidential election, it could have big implications for Taiwan's
relationship with China---and with the United States. But will the
intricate Gou-Han dynamic give the incumbent Democratic Progressive
Party (DPP) a window to curtail a resurgent KMT? Han is good at selling
pineapples---one of his city's main exports---while Gou wants to sell
semiconductor chips. Han is an expert in mobilizing support on the
ground, while Gou commands from the top down. Han's welcome parties in
Boston, Los Angeles, and San Jose, jammed with his fans and reporters
from Taiwan and the United States, ran like political rallies with
hundreds of supporters chanting, "Han Kuo-yu! Han Kuo-yu! Run for
president and save Taiwan!" Han asked the audience to return home to
cast their votes because the 2020 presidential election is "a matter of
life and death" for Taiwan. Then entered Gou, who claimed to have been
enlisted by the sea goddess Matsu, a popular deity in Taiwan and
southern China, to pursue a presidential bid. Gou is said to be the only
Taiwanese citizen who has both Trump and Xi Jinping on speed dial. Like
Han, Gou was born to parents who came from mainland China. Han and Gou
went to the same primary school in Banqiao, a suburban town near Taipei.
Forty-five years ago, Gou founded Foxconn, which became the world's
largest contract manufacturer of electronics, with factories in many
countries, including mainland China, where it employs 1.3 million
people. The two have much in common---in March, Gou visited Kaohsiung to
pose for pics with Han, promising to bring 3,000 jobs to the city. Like
Han, Gou promotes closer ties with Beijing. But Gou's personal fortune
is so much tied to his businesses in China that it inevitably invites
questions as to whether his investments will make him susceptible to
political influence or blackmail. Taiwan has long suffered from a
country cousin syndrome---eclipsed by China's outsized economy and
growing power despite experiencing rapid industrialization and high
growth rates as one of the Four Asian Tigers from the 1960s to 1990s.
The unification/independence debate and intermittently flaring tensions
with China have paralyzed the island's economic growth and relationships
with the outside world. Gou has openly expressed his fear of a possible
war across the Taiwan Strait. His international standing and business
acumen could open the doors for Taiwan's beleaguered industries. **[Han
is also much friendlier to Beijing than the current DPP government. He
has not been afraid of alienating pro-DPP voters in Kaohsiung, a deep
green (the DPP's color) city, by openly recognizing the 1992
Consensus]{.underline}**, which he referred to in a speech at Harvard
University as a practical and realistic basis to interact with China.
Taiwanese President Tsai Ing-wen has refused to endorse the 1992
Consensus or the idea of "one country, two systems." Han's position on
China reflects his belief that provocation of China has not helped the
cause of Taiwan. Yet at the same time, he emphasized his view of the
1992 Consensus as "one China, respective interpretations," rather than
"one country, two systems" as currently applied to Macau and Hong Kong.
This is a direct departure from Xi's proposal at the beginning of this
year. The delicate politics inside the KMT saw two other senior
politicians, former New Taipei City Mayor Eric Chu and former
legislative speaker Wang Jin-pyng, announcing their candidacies. With
Gou joining the fray, any botched nomination process could disrupt the
party's unity and could cost it the chance of winning back the
presidency and legislature. **[Han cannot join the KMT's primary because
he could face potential criticism for using Kaohsiung merely as a
steppingstone for his greater political ambition.]{.underline}** Based
on a
[survey](https://cc.tvbs.com.tw/portal/file/poll_center/2019/20190401/4c27ecc17b1682d9d2b35d347e389dc1.pdf)conducted
by the Taiwanese broadcaster TVBS in March, **[52 percent of Kaohsiung
citizens do not support Han's presidential candidacy]{.underline}**
because they want the mayor to focus on his campaign promises to the
city. Unless he can prove that has already led the city forward, jumping
to the presidency will be a hard sell. **[This gives Gou a first-mover
advantage]{.underline}**. The question is whether Gou can dominate the
polls the way Han has achieved. If the KMT prematurely dismisses the
possibility of enlisting Han, it could find itself in an awkward spot of
trying to resurrect Han's candidacy if Gou fails to rally the crowd and
command a significant margin against his DPP opponents. According to a
[survey](https://udn.com/news/story/6656/3763990) released by Shih Hsin
University on April 18, **[Gou leads with 35.6 percent support in a
three-way race with Taipei Mayor Ko Wen-je (25.2 percent), an
independent, and Tsai (27.1 percent)]{.underline}**. If the **[DPP
replaces Tsai with William Lai, who formerly headed the Executive Yun,
Gou still tops the polls at 32.1 percent]{.underline}**. But a Gou-Han
comparison leaves the two neck and neck with 29.8 percent for Han, 29
percent for Gou, and a huge (41.2 percent) number of people undecided.
Among all presidential hopefuls, Han was originally the first to achieve
40 percent support. An **[Apple Daily]{.underline}**
[poll](https://tw.appledaily.com/new/realtime/20190415/1551057/)
released on April 15 found Han with 40 percent in a three-way race with
Ko (26.5 percent) and Tsai (26 percent). If the DPP selects Lai as its
nominee, Han still leads with 39 percent, over Lai's 26.5 percent and
Ko's 28 percent. Another **[TVBS survey released in March showed that
young voters aged 20-29 and 30-39 supported Ko more than all other
potential candidates]{.underline}**. So regardless of the lineup, a KMT
candidate will need to win over more support from the millennials, who
bear the brunt of Taiwan's stagnant economy, and watch for a potential
Tsai-Ko pairing. **[Both Gou and Han are advocates for stronger
China-Taiwan relations]{.underline}**, but their
[detractors](https://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2019/04/taiwanese-populist-han-kuo-yu-china/587146/)
are already warning against the risk of political infiltration as a
result of closer economic ties, pointing to issues such as Beijing's
interference in recent elections. (From my own firsthand observations in
Kaohsiung, my hometown, the groundswell of real support for Han was
undeniable.) Han's meetings with officers of Hong Kong and China during
a recent trip, while racking up a slew of orders for Kaohsiung's fresh
produce, generated a political firestorm with accusations from Tsai's
government that he had "sold Taiwan out to China." Gou will face an even
heavier barrage of such challenges. **[Gou also faces another challenge:
whether his communication style will be reminiscent of the old KMT
establishment. The DPP will likely also try to dig into Gou's extensive
business dealings and expose any potential flaws.]{.underline}** That's
a real challenge for whoever emerges as the front-runner. In the coming
weeks or months, whoever ends up being KMT designee will need to clearly
articulate his views about cross-strait relations and come up with
concrete proposals to rejuvenate Taiwan's economy. He also needs to
address the thorny subject of safeguarding Taiwan's security interest by
"ring-fencing" the many forms of influence China tries to exert. Any
rift within the KMT will give the DPP an opening to hold onto its power.
Taiwan cannot gain by closing its doors to China or the world. **[Any
KMT nominee will need to tread a fine line between seeking broader
exchanges with China and maintaining Taiwan's democratic
identity]{.underline}** while finding a potential way out of the
nonproductive binary oppositions: unification versus independence,
engagement versus disengagement, etc. **[If either Gou or Han can
deliver on that without compromising Taiwanese values, advocates for
Taiwan in the United States can feel comfortable with the idea of their
victory.]{.underline}**

### No invasion: Ships

[China is stepping up its military capability to invade
Taiwan]{.underline}, [but]{.underline} might [lack the core assault
landing capabilities to conquer the self-ruled island]{.underline},
military experts said. The assessment follows an annual report to the US
Congress saying China was likely to be preparing a plan to take Taiwan
by force, while simultaneously deterring, delaying, or denying any
third-party intervention on the island's behalf. The 136-page report,
"Military and Security Developments Involving the People's Republic of
China 2019," was released last week and listed a number of options,
including a blockade to cut off Taiwan's imports accompanied by
large-scale missile strikes and the occupation of Taiwanese administered
islands like Quemoy (also known as Kinmen) and Matsu. [An air and
missile attack might aim to destroy important military and
communications infrastructure, while a full-scale invasion might start
at northern or southern points along Taiwan's west coas]{.underline}t,
according to the Pentagon report**[. Experts have cast doubt on the
Chinese military's ability to launch an amphibious operation to invade
Taiwan]{.underline}**. Experts have cast doubt on the Chinese military's
ability to launch an amphibious operation to invade Taiwan. Photo: Weibo
Turning to Taiwan's defenses, the report noted the island's advantages
continue to decline as China's military modernization proceeds, with
significant problems in recruiting sufficient military personnel. Taiwan
also faces "considerable equipment and readiness challenges," the report
said. [Military analyst Collin Koh, from the S. Rajaratnam School of
International Studies at Singapore's Nanyang Technological
University]{.underline}, [said an amphibious operation to take over the
island]{.underline}, as outlined in the report, [was unlikely due to
China's inadequate sealift capability and the inability of its
amphibious forces to work in concert with other services]{.underline}.
"Amphibious assault landing operations are, after all, highly complex
operations that require so many moving parts across branches and
services that it'll take much effort and time to promote and inculcate
that concept and spirit of fighting jointly and in an integrated
manner," he said. [Koh's view was echoed by Timothy Heath, a senior
international defense research analyst at the US think tank Rand, who
said **inadequate numbers of ships capable of transporting troops for an
invasion remained an important shortfall for any Chinese military plan
to invade Taiwan.**]{.underline} "Amphibious assault ships and other
vessels for conveying combat troops onto the beaches of Taiwan are
essential because invasion is the only way the PLA can guarantee
conquest of Taiwan," said Heath, adding that the PLA currently has a
relatively modest inventory of such ships. Ties between Beijing and
Taipei nosedived after Tsai Ing-wen was elected president in 2016. Ties

Li Jie said China's armed forces could accomplish goals as long as
orders came from China's top leaders, despite various weaknesses in the
Chinese military. "And, when compared to the past, China's amphibious
combat capabilities have already improved after extensive training in
recent years," Li said. Ties between Beijing and Taipei nosedived after
Tsai Ing-wen from the independence-leaning Democratic Progressive Party
became the island's president in May 2016 and repeatedly refused to
endorse the "1992 consensus" which refers to an understanding that there
is only one China, though each side may have its own interpretation of
what constitutes "China." [Beijing responded by stepping up military and
diplomatic pressure against the island, ramping up live-fire military
exercises and luring away Taiwan's diplomatic allies. China has ramped

destroyers, USS Preble and USS Chung-Hoon passed within 12 nautical
miles of Gaven and Johnson reefs in the Spratly Islands, drawing
immediate criticism from Beijing. [The House of Representatives on
Tuesday unanimously backed legislation supporting Taiwan. Under the
Taiwan Relations Act, the United States is bound by law to help defend

selling the island more than \$15 billion in weapons since 2010,

campaign would attack targets on the Chinese mainland, raising some
inherent risks of nuclear escalation. Nevertheless, he contends that
[U.S. policymakers are sensitized to the dangers and can manage the
problem through the careful design of military campaigns]{.underline}.15
Vincent Manzo, a Pentagon analyst, also soberly recognizes escalatory
risk but argues that a [U.S. campaign can be designed to limit the
possibility that China would view it as threatening the country's
nuclear deterrent.]{.underline} For example, the United States could
geographically circumscribe the range of its operations on Chinese
territory or conduct most of its attacks with stand-off weapons that
would reduce the need to suppress Chinese air defenses.16 My own
conversations and interviews with numerous other current and former U.S.
government officials, both military and civilian, suggest that many
share Colby's and Manzo's views.17 On occasion these views have surfaced
publicly, as when former Director of National Intelligence and retired
Commander of U.S. Pacific Command Adm. [Dennis Blair recently described
the possibility of nuclear escalation]{.underline} between the United
States and China [as "somewhere between zero and nil."]{.underline}18
Many Chinese analysts echo this relaxed view. As Fiona Cunningham and
Taylor Fravel report, "[China's strategic community does not share U.S.
concerns about nuclear escalation]{.underline} from the implementation
of the AirSea Battle Concept. Its members understand that the aim of the
AirSea Battle Concept is to defeat Chinese 'antiaccess' capabilities and
involves a blinding campaign. Nevertheless, most sources . . . did not
believe that the AirSea Battle was relevant to Chinese nuclear weapons."
Cunningham and Fravel do not accept these optimistic Chinese views
uncritically, however. They note that Chinese confidence that an AirSea
Battle-- style campaign would not lead to nuclear escalation is in
tension with stated Chinese concerns about how U.S. missile defenses and
conventional prompt global strike might affect China's nuclear
retaliatory capabilities.20 Nevertheless, Cunningham and Fravel do
question some of the pessimists' concerns. For example, Cunningham and
Fravel show that "the majority of China's nuclear missiles are not
collocated with conventional ones."21 Hence they argue that the chance
that the United States might mistakenly target Chinese nuclear missiles
in a campaign against the conventional ones is lower than often assumed.
Cunningham and Fravel also echo [Chinese doubts about whether U.S.
attacks on China's conventional command and control would impinge on
China's nuclear command and control]{.underline}; the two types of
launch brigades use different command chains, and Chinese command and
control systems exhibit significant redundancy.22

### No Lashout

#### No diversionary war for xi ☺

**Yin 19** (George Yin, 1-22-2019, \"Domestic repression and
international aggression? Why Xi is uninterested in diversionary
conflict,\" Brookings,
<https://www.brookings.edu/articles/domestic-repression-and-international-aggression-why-xi-is-uninterested-in-diversionary-conflict/>)
RK

The theory of diversionary wars posits that leaders often have the
incentive to pursue aggressive foreign policies in order to divert the
domestic audience's attention from domestic troubles. Through
international conflict, leaders can either foster national solidarity or
demonstrate their competence. Could Xi seek to consolidate power by
adopting an assertive foreign policy in his second term? Crucially,
[diversionary war theory rests on a number of assumptions, two of which
do not hold for Xi today. Assumption 1: Leaders prefer foreign adventure
over addressing domestic troubles.]{.underline} As discussed earlier[,
in the realm of domestic policies, Xi has been criticized for primarily
two things: his promotion of his cult of personality and a slowing
Chinese economy overly focused on inefficient SOEs.]{.underline} It is
easy for Xi to dial back his cult of personality, and he has already
done so. Reverting his policy of guo jin min tui ("as the state
advances, the private sector retreats") is not going to be easy and
would entail important financial system and legal reforms (see
discussions from the 2018 Chinese Economists 50 forum), but is quite
doable. [There is little reason **why Xi would want to create
international tension to distract his critics when it is much more
straightforward to directly address the domestic issue**s]{.underline}.
Furthermore, [**a diversionary skirmish** involving Vietnam or the
Philippines over one of the South China Sea islands **would hardly be
significant enough for diversion**.]{.underline} To rally the nation
behind him, Xi must pick on Taiwan, Japan, or even the United States.
The problem is that [a confrontation with either Taiwan or Japan is
highly risky]{.underline}. The Chinese military, which has not fought a
war since the Sino-Vietnamese conflict in 1979 and is embroiled in
corruption scandals, might well suffer defeat. Perhaps China could take
on the United States in the economics arena, but [China has been unable
to react effectively to the ongoing trade war with the United States.
**CCP elites do not want international conflict**, especially one
involving the United States.]{.underline} Assumption 2: [Key domestic
political players want conflict.]{.underline} Most importantly, [the CCP
elites do not want international conflict, especially one involving the
United States.]{.underline} [This is not because the CCP elites like the
United States, which is still seen by many as an imperial power that
supports Japanese militarism and secessionism in Taiwan, Hong Kong,
Tibet, and Xinjiang.]{.underline} However, in Fan's words, it is
important "to deal with domestic issues before pacifying the barbarians"
(an nei rang wai). [In the eyes of his critics, any foreign adventure
would indicate that Xi was getting the priorities wrong and further
deviate from Deng's grand strategy of fostering a favorable foreign
environment to promote development. **A diversionary conflict is
therefore likely to further galvanize Xi's opposition.**]{.underline} In
conclusion, [the Xi administration's performance since 2012 has been
attacked by a wide range of groups that constitute China's governing
elites; Xi can do little to eliminate rival factions who are waiting for
the opportune moment to strike back.]{.underline} **[Xi is unlikely to
be interested in a foreign adventure that would at best distract him
from domestic power struggles, and at worst provide more political
ammunition for his opponents to use against him]{.underline}**. Instead,
[Xi actually faces a lot of pressure to improve China's relations with
the U.S. in his second term, which could help him deal with his domestic
troubles or at least not exacerbate them.]{.underline} [Some may wonder
whether Xi would risk looking weak in the eyes of his domestic rivals if
he makes policy adjustments]{.underline}---e.g. [conceding to some U.S.
demands in order to de-escalate the trade war]{.underline}---[in order
to fend off his domestic critics]{.underline}. For two reasons, [this
should not be an important concern for Xi. First, Xi already has a
reputation for strength, possibly for too much strength]{.underline}.
**[Tempering this image of strength might not to be Xi's
disadvantage.]{.underline}** [Second]{.underline}, ultimately, **[the
most important thing is how the Xi administration
performs.]{.underline}** Since Deng, [top CCP leaders are evaluated by
the party elites according to three metrics: political stability,
economic development, and successful management of Sino-American
relations]{.underline}. The current administration passes when it comes
to the first metric, but has been underperforming on the latter two
metrics. Policy adjustment, therefore, is necessary. [A reputation for
competence is much more important than a reputation for strength, even
if appearing weak might be a concern.]{.underline} This paper's argument
has a few policy implications for the United States. From the U.S.
perspective, the current trade war with China is opportune. The Chinese
economy is sluggish, and the trade war could push many Chinese exporters
to bankruptcy and lead to mass unemployment. Xi needs to avoid this
development, even if it means allowing the United States to extract
substantial concessions with threats of further tariffs. Overall, Xi is
likely to be more susceptible to U.S. pressure today on issues ranging
from intellectual property rights to North Korea. However, the United
States should be careful with the issue of Taiwan. T[aiwan's pursuit of
de jure independence is probably the only issue that could unite the
rival CCP factions under Xi for conflict. While now is a good
opportunity for the United States to strengthen its relationship with
Taiwan and meet less Chinese opposition, it is essential for the United
States to maintain its position that it opposes either Taiwan or China
unilaterally changing the status quo.]{.underline}

### No CCP Collapse

#### No CCP collapse \-- their misunderstanding of the Chinese system leads to flawed predictions

**Kroeber**, 3/13/**15**- senior foreign policy fellow at Brookings and
editor of the journal China Economic Quarterly (Arthur R. Kroeber,
3/13/15, "When Will China's Government Collapse?,"
<http://foreignpolicy.com/2015/03/13/china_communist_party_collapse_downfall/>)

**[Neither China nor its Communist Party is cracking up.]{.underline}**
I have three reasons for this judgment. First, none of the factors
Shambaugh cites strongly supports the crackup case. Second, the balance
of evidence suggests that Xi's government is not weak and desperate, but
forceful and adaptable. Third, the forces that might push for systemic
political change are far weaker than the party. Shambaugh thinks the
system is on its last legs because rich people are moving assets abroad,
Xi is cracking down on the media and academia, officials look bored in
meetings, corruption is rife, and the economy is at an impasse. This is
not a persuasive case. True, many rich Chinese are moving money abroad,
both to find safe havens and to diversify their portfolios as China's
growth slows. But in aggregate, capital outflows are modest, and plenty
of rich Chinese are still investing in their own economy. Following an
easing of rules, new private business registrations rose 45 percent in
2014 --- scarcely a sign that the entrepreneurial class has given up
hope. **[The crackdown on free expression and civil society
is]{.underline}** deeply distressing, but **[not]{.underline}**
necessarily a **[sign of weakness. It could]{.underline}** equally **[be
seen as an assertion of confidence in the success of China's
authoritarian-capitalist model, and a rejection of the idea that China
needs to make concessions to liberal-democratic ideas to
keep]{.underline}** on **[going.]{.underline}** It is also related to
the crackdown on corruption, which Shambaugh wrongly dismisses as a
cynical power play. Corruption at the end of the era of Xi's predecessor
Hu Jintao had got out of control, and posed a real risk of bringing down
the regime. A **[relentless drive to limit corruption was essential to
stabilize the system, and this is precisely what Xi has delivered. It
cannot work unless Xi can demonstrate complete control over all aspects
of the political system, including ideology.]{.underline}** As for the
economy and the reform program, it is first worth pointing out that
**[despite its severe slowdown, China's economy continues to grow faster
than that of any other major country in the world.]{.underline}** And
**[claims that the reform program is sputtering]{.underline}** simply
**[do not square with the facts.]{.underline}** 2014 saw the start of a
crucial program to revamp the fiscal system, which led to the start of
restructuring local government debt; first steps to liberalize the
one-child policy and the hukou, or household registration system
(discussed for years but never achieved by previous governments);
important changes in energy pricing; and linkage of the Shanghai and
Hong Kong stock markets. News reports suggest that we will soon see a
program to reorganize big SOEs under Temasek-like holding companies that
will focus on improving their flagging financial returns. These are all
material achievements and compare favorably to, for instance, the utter
failure of Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe to progress on any of the
reform agenda he outlined for his country two years ago. Finally,
**[there is no evidence that the biggest and most important political
constituency in China --- the rising urban bourgeoisie --- has much
interest in changing the system.]{.underline}** In my conversations with
members of this class, I hear many complaints, but more generally a
satisfaction with the material progress China has made in the last two
decades. Except for a tiny group of brave dissidents, **[this group in
general displays little interest in political reform and none in
democracy.]{.underline}** One reason may be that they find uninspiring
the record of democratic governance in other big Asian countries, such
as India. More important is probably the fear that in a representative
system, the interests of the urban bourgeoisie (at most 25 percent of
the population) would lose out to those of the rural masses. **[The
party may]{.underline}** well **[be somewhat insecure, but the only
force that might plausibly unseat it is more insecure still. Predictions
of Chinese political collapse have a long and futile history. Their
persistent failure stems from a basic conceptual fault. Instead of
facing the Chinese system on its own terms and understanding why it
works]{.underline}** --- which could create insights into why it might
stop working --- **[critics judge the system against what they would
like it to be]{.underline}**, and find it wanting. **[This embeds an
assumption of fragility that makes every societal problem look like an
existential crisis.]{.underline}** As a long-term resident of China, I
would love the government to become more open, pluralistic and tolerant
of creativity. That it refuses to do so is disappointing to me and many
others, but offers no grounds for a judgment of its weakness. **[Seven
years ago]{.underline}**, in his excellent book China's Communist Party:
Atrophy and Adaptation, **[Shambaugh described the Party as "a
reasonably strong and resilient institution....]{.underline}** To be
sure, **[it has its problems and challenges, but none present the real
possibility of systemic collapse." That was a good judgment then, and it
remains a good judgment now.]{.underline}**

#### No escalation or draw-in in the South China Sea.

\*\*gendered language modified

**[History]{.underline}** initially **[suggests]{.underline}** that
**[the S]{.underline}**outh **[C]{.underline}**hina
**[S]{.underline}**ea **[is not a flashpoint]{.underline}**. The [loss
of life resulting from]{.underline} the [use of force there pales in
comparison to]{.underline} those in [East Asia's traditional
flashpoints]{.underline}. For instance, in the unresolved Korean War
(1950--53), which remains at the heart of continuing tensions on the
Korean Peninsula, an estimated two million military personnel were
either killed or unaccounted for.7 A comparable number of casualties
occurred in the Chinese Civil War (1946--1949), which left today's
Taiwan flashpoint as a direct product.8 Further, at a time when some
analysts are talking up the prospects of war between China and Japan
over the Senkaku/Diaoyu Islands, it is worth recalling that an estimated
15--35 million perished during the course of the second Sino--Japanese
War (1937--45).9 While history is not destiny, more recent estimates
suggest that the combustion of any one of these flashpoints today could
prove equally devastating. Richard Bush and Michael O'Hanlon of the
Brookings Institution, for example, predict that a conflict over Taiwan
could spark a nuclear war involving 1.5 billion people and produce a
fundamental change in the international order.10 Similar estimates
produced at the time of the 1993--94 North Korean nuclear crisis
suggested that war on the Korean Peninsula could cost half a million
lives and up to US\$1 trillion in its first ninety days.11 Conflict
between Asia's two most powerful navies in the East China Sea could
prove equally devastating, particularly given that China and Japan are
also the world's second- and third-largest economies, respectively.
Total trade between these two historical great powers of East Asia
currently stands at U.S. \$345 billion.12 [It is **hard to envisage a
credible scenario** where a skirmish in the **S**]{.underline}outh
**[C]{.underline}**hina **[S]{.underline}**ea [could erupt into a
conflict of similar proportions]{.underline}. [The nationalist
foundations of these disputes are **fundamentally different** from those
underpinning East Asia's traditional flashpoints]{.underline}. By way of
example, recent polling suggests that 87 percent of the Chinese public
view Japan negatively, whilst 50 percent anticipate a military dispute
with Japan.13 Reflecting this sentiment, when Tokyo announced its
decision to purchase contested Islands in the East China Sea from their
private owner in September 2012, this sparked widespread anti-Japanese
protests across China that spread to more than 100 cities.14 Such
[public displays of nationalist sentiment stand in marked contrast to
June 2013 anti-China protests in Hanoi following]{.underline} Vietnamese
[allegations that a Chinese vessel had rammed and damaged a Vietnamese
fishing boat]{.underline}. Subsequently, [a **mere 150 protesters**
gathered in the city center]{.underline}.15 [Crowds of comparable size
have attended anti-Chinese protests in the Philippines]{.underline}. For
instance, a March 2012 protest outside the Chinese Embassy in Manila
that organizers expected to draw 1,000 protesters attracted barely half
that number.16 The [strategic geography]{.underline} of the South China
Sea [also **militates against it being a genuine
flashpoint**]{.underline}. [Throughout history, large bodies of water
have tended to inhibit]{.underline} [the]{.underline} [**willingness**
and **ability** of adversaries to wage war]{.underline}. In The Tragedy
of Great Power Politics, for instance, John Mearsheimer refers to "the
stopping power of water," writing of the limits that large bodies of
water place on the capacity of states to project military
power---relative, at least, to when they share common land borders.17
[Even when clashes]{.underline} at sea [do occur]{.underline}, [history
suggests]{.underline} that [these generally afford states~~men~~
**greater time and space to find diplomatic solutions**]{.underline}. As
Robert Ross observes, in such cases "[neither side has to fear
that]{.underline} the other's [provocative diplomacy or movement of
troops is a prelude to attack]{.underline} and immediately escalate to
heightened military readiness. [Tension can be **slower to develop**,
allowing]{.underline} the protagonists [time to **manage** and **avoid**
unnecessary escalation]{.underline}."18 [Ross' observation]{.underline},
in turn, [dovetails]{.underline} elegantly [with the issue of
proximity]{.underline}, which Hoyt regards as a defining feature of a
flashpoint. [The antagonists in the **S**]{.underline}outh
**[C]{.underline}**hina **[S]{.underline}**ea disputes [are **less
proximate**]{.underline} than in the case of the Korean
Peninsula---where the two Koreas share a land border that remains the
most militarized on earth. The same can be said of the Taiwan
flashpoint. Indeed, the proximity of Taiwan to the mainland affords
Beijing [credible strategic options]{.underline}--- [and]{.underline}
arguably even [incentives]{.underline}---[involving]{.underline} the
[use of force]{.underline} that [are **not available**]{.underline} to
it [in the **S**]{.underline}outh **[C]{.underline}**hina
**[S]{.underline}**ea.19 Finally, and related to the third of Hoyt's
criteria, [the **S**]{.underline}outh **[C]{.underline}**hina
**[S]{.underline}**ea **[cannot be said to engage the vital interests of
Asia's great powers]{.underline}**. To be sure, much has been made of
India's growing interests in this part of the world--- particularly
following reports of a July 2011 face-off between a Chinese ship and an
Indian naval vessel that was leaving Vietnamese waters.20 However, [New
Delhi's interests]{.underline} in the South China Sea [remain
overwhelmingly economic, not strategic, driven]{.underline} as they are
by the search for oil. Moreover, even if New Delhi had anything more
than secondary strategic interests at stake in the geographically
distant South China Sea, it is widely accepted that India's armed forces
will for some time lack the capacity to credibly defend these.21
Similarly, while much has been made of Tokyo's willingness to assist
Manila with improving its maritime surveillance capabilities,22 for
reasons of history and geography, [Tokyo's interests in the
Senkaku]{.underline}/Diaoyu [Islands]{.underline} dispute, the [Korean
Peninsula, and]{.underline} even the [Taiwan]{.underline} flashpoint
**[dwarf those]{.underline}** which **[it has at stake in
the]{.underline}** more **[distant S]{.underline}**outh
**[C]{.underline}**hina **[S]{.underline}**ea. [The extent to which this
body of water]{.underline} genuinely [engages]{.underline} the [vital
interests of China and the **U**]{.underline}nited
**[S]{.underline}**tates **[continues to be overstated]{.underline}**

### Turn- Strategic Ambiguity Bad 

#### Strategic Ambiguity prevents conflict---flexibility in policy solves war and PRC relns

**Chen 14** (Dean Chen- Associate Professor of Political Science at
Ramapo College of NJ, "An Indispensable Pillar of Obama's "Pivot" to
Asia: Continuing Strategic Ambiguity across the Taiwan Strait," from
"The US Strategic Pivot to Asia and Cross-Strait Relations Economic and
Security Dynamics" Ed. Peter Chow) RK

In this author's view, [the United States is unlikely to abandon Taiwan
or jettison its strategic ambiguity policy,]{.underline} at least in the
foreseeable future. Some proponents of strategic clarity, including
Charles Glaser, have urged that Washington, in order to pacify Beijing,
should consider withdrawing from its commitment to Taiwan because the
island is an "insigniﬁcant" national security interest.98 Nevertheless,
[even though abandoning Taiwan may signiﬁcantly strengthen US-PRC
relations]{.underline}, [accommodating Beijing may also be construed as
America's power decline and losing its resolve in East
Asia]{.underline}.99 [Appeasement]{.underline}, in other words, **[may
not be necessarily peace inducing and could even enlarge Beijing's
ambition, thus compromising Washington's policy to rebalance in the
Asian Paciﬁc.]{.underline}** Nancy Tucker held the view that "[strategic
clarity is not the solution to U.S. policy problems in the Taiwan
Strait. Even though it appears to be the direction in which many
analysts currently wish to travel, it fails to remedy existing problems
and could make them worse]{.underline}." Moreover, [strategic ambiguity
"has been about peaceful resolutio]{.underline}n,\[and\]as [policy
makers push to \[clarify\] what they would do under speciﬁc
circumstances, they edge ever closer not just to abandoning
ambiguity]{.underline}, but also to taking sides in the standoff in the
strait."100 In other words, **[taking a clear stance on the Taiwan issue
would be counterproductive to peace and stability in the Asian Paciﬁc
region]{.underline}**.101 Consequently, America's consistent adherence
to strategic ambiguity is illustrated in the Obama administration's
recent endorsement of Taiwan's participation in the International Civil
Aviation Organization (ICAO). While acknowledging that Taiwan's
exclusion from this specialized UN agency would place millions of
Taiwanese passengers ﬂying between Taiwan and America at an
extremelydisadvantageousposition,thepresidentalsomadereferencetothe"one
China" framework.102 In a statement released on July 12, 2013, Obama
said, The United States fully supports Taiwan's membership in
international organizations where statehood is not a requirement for
membership and encourages Taiwan's meaningful participation, as
appropriate, in organizations where its membership is not
possible\...Consistent with my constitutional authority to conduct
foreign affairs, my administration shall construe the Act to be
consistent with the "one-China" policy of the United States, which
remains unchanged, and shall determine the measures best suited to
advance the overall goal of Taiwan's participation in the ICAO.103
Nonetheless, [despite the seemingly durable and consistent US security
commitment toward Taiwan, as well as its strategic ambiguity
policy]{.underline}, [there]{.underline} [are]{.underline} also [no 100
percent guarantees that America's interests, given the changing
international structure, would not experience an immediate sharp
turn]{.underline}. World Wars I and
IIshooktheUnitedStatesoutofitslong-standingforeignpolicyisolationismand
commercial protectionism and transformed the nation into a global
hegemonic power with far-reaching military and economic inﬂuence across
the world.104 Similarly, [America may also change its interests toward
Taiwan, especially if the island loses its strategic and normative
appeals in the midst of increasingly complicated and tensed US-PRC
relations]{.underline}. Indeed, John Mearsheimer suggests that the
United States, on the one hand, has "powerful incentives to make
\[Taiwan\] part of a balancing coalition aimed at containing China. On
the other hand, [there are good reasons to think that **with the passage
of time the beneﬁts of maintaining close ties with Taiwan will be
outweighed** by the potential costs]{.underline}, **[which are likely to
be huge]{.underline}**." [The duration of US-Taiwan strategic
relationship, therefore, becomes "an open question," and the island may
be forced]{.underline}, in the long run, to accept the "Hong Kong
strategy" or China's "one country, two systems" formula.105
[Taiwan]{.underline}, however, [has two important assets that, if
exercised skillfully, would guarantee its continued importance in
America's strategic calculations.]{.underline} [First]{.underline}, one
predominant advantage of Taiwan [is its liberal democratic
identity]{.underline}. Being the ﬁrst ethnically and modern Chinese
democracy,106 Taiwan, more than any other democratic states in East
Asia, assumes a uniquely normative function in America's constructive
engagement policy toward China. Its successful
transitionfromanauthoritarianLeninistparty-statetoavibrantmultipartydemocracy
in the 1990s serves a great example for mainland China.
[Second]{.underline}, [Taiwan's de facto autonomy---as a separate
political entity from mainland China---further reinforces its strategic
value]{.underline}. **[This allows Taiwan to simultaneously cultivate
salutary ties with China through socioeconomic channels while
maintaining close security and political relations with the United
States.]{.underline}**

### Deterrence 

#### us is the only one stopping china from taking over taiwan

**Easley 2016** (Easley, Leif-Eric- fellow at Shorenstein APARC, B.A,
Ph.D. March 2016. "Grand Bargain or Bad Idea? U.S. Relations with China
and Taiwan." *International Security*, vol. 40, no. 4, Spring 2016, pp.
178--185. *EBSCOhost*, doi:10.1162/ISEC_c_00239.) VL

[Points of friction in U.S.-China relations abound]{.underline}---from
cyber espionage and human rights to trade disputes and financial
governance. [Abandoning Taiwan will not stop Chinese military
modernization, antiaccess/area denial development, or the targeting of
U.S. bases in Japan and South Korea with Chinese
missiles.]{.underline}11 The United States has numerous reasons for
conducting surveillance and freedom of navigation operations, so those
activities Glaser identifies as [irritants to China would not end, even
if Taiwan were no longer a subject of disagreement]{.underline}. Foreign
policy ambition in Beijing has outgrown the 1950s and 1990s cross-strait
crises; Chinese internal debates tend to paint the United States as a
global competitor, benchmark U.S. global capabilities, and derive
legitimacy from contrasting Chinese political values with "Western" or
"universal" values.12 Glaser does not mention Chinese efforts at
building up alternative institutions such as the Shanghai Cooperation
Organization, Conference on Interaction and Confidence-Building Measures
in Asia, Boao Forum for Asia, and Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank,
or China using issues of historical animosity to drive a wedge between
Japan and South Korea. He thus underestimates the apparent Chinese
strategy of not directly confronting the United States globally, while
attempting to dilute U.S. alliances in Asia, pursuing a Chinese-centered
regional architecture, and changing the status quo in maritime areas
without going so far as to trigger conflict or a coherent balancing
coalition.13 Rather than alleviate frictions, a grand bargain would
likely motivate beliefs that China could eventually dismantle the U.S.
security architecture in Asia, emboldening actors on the [Chinese
side]{.underline} to [pursue their interests more assertively. U.S.
abandonment of Taiwan would entail repealing the Taiwan Relations Act,
ending the legal basis for defense cooperation and arms sales,
immediately undermining deterrence, and steadily International Securit,
degrading Taiwan's defense capabilities in ways difficult to
reverse.]{.underline}14 Meanwhile, China's salami tactics, in
combination with its ability to quickly redeploy military assets it
might agree to pull back and its demonstrated long-term approach to the
East China and South China Seas, make any such deal as Glaser suggests
not credible. Chinese official documents give no reason to believe that
Beijing would be conciliatory on other claims if the United States
accommodated China on Taiwan.15 Taipei also claims sovereignty over the
Japanese-controlled Senkaku Islands in the East China Sea. Beijing's
legal claim to these islands, which it calls the Diaoyu Islands, heavily
relies on the history of the Republic of China and the status of "Taiwan
Province."16 Meanwhile, [Taiwan maintains troops and recently upgraded
its facilities on Taiping]{.underline}/Itu Aba, the largest naturally
occurring feature of the disputed Spratly Islands, where China has been
engaged in land reclamation and construction on features it controls.
[U.S. abandonment of Taiwan would likely make Chinese decisionmakers
believe they could strengthen their claims in the East China and South
China Seas by coercing Taipei]{.underline} to consolidate its positions
with those of Beijing. Beijing's assertive policies contrast to the
responsible, measured, and cooperative approach Taipei has taken to
managing disputed claims in the East China and South China Seas.17 Far
from being the dangerous source of entrapment Glaser describes, [Taiwan
is a valuable strategic and economic partner.]{.underline}18 In June
2015, the United States and Taiwan signed the Global Cooperation and
Training Framework agreement to jointly offer capacity building in areas
such as public health, women's empowerment, environmental protection,
and maritime safety. Leaders across Taiwan's political spectrum have
internalized lessons from the provocative Chen Shui-bian years and are
not about to risk the lives and treasure of their people for the sake of
forcing Washington's hand vis-à-vis Beijing. Moreover[, the United
States has historically managed to deter challengers and restrain
partners, preventing both sides from initiating or escalating conflicts.
The U.S. defense commitment to Taiwan is not preventing something good
from happening, but rather preventing some seriously bad things from
happening.]{.underline}20 U.S. defense exchanges and intelligence
sharing with Taipei may annoy nationalists in Beijing, but they help
avoid miscalculation, support escalation control, and discourage
provocation and aggression. Glaser discounts the negative effects of
abandoning Taiwan on U.S. military capabilities and intelligence
gathering in Asia, freedom of navigation, and maritime and energy
security. Under his proposed bargain, the [United States would
be]{.underline} avoiding hypothetical costs and pursuing uncertain
benefits while [giving up known military benefits and incurring
unnecessary strategic costs]{.underline}.

China-US economic ties. In 2016, the volume of Sino-American bilateral
trade in goods reached \$519.6 billion and trade in services amounted to
\$110 billion while two-way investment stock exceeded \$170 billion. It
is estimated that 26% of Boeing airplanes, 56% of soy beans, 16% of
automobiles and 15% of integrated circuits made in the US were exported
to China that year. On personnel exchanges, there were 14,000 people
travelling between China and the US on a daily basis and there are now
over 300,000 Chinese students in the US, taking up one third of the
total foreign students.¶ It seems that President **[Trump's "America

American officials as an indication of the imbalance in China-US trade.
Deficit or surplus is a fact in bilateral trade and the figure for 2016
is \$347 billion. The key is to find ways and means to reduce deficit
and restore balance in trade. According to a Financial Times report,
**[the summit agreed "a hundred days negotiation on trade", mainly
focusing on opening financial and beef markets in China. Trade is not
one way street and it needs mutual benefits to sustain
it.]{.underline}** In other words, **[it is by no means a "zero-sum"

QNB", 9-19-2016,
http://www.hellenicshippingnews.com/china-economy-in-a-tightrope-qnb/\]

Stimulating China's economy while avoiding a hard landing has put
Chinese policymakers on a "tightrope," QNB said in a report. The two
most recent market turbulences were caused by concerns about the Chinese
economy, according to QNB. While **[the]{.underline}** January **[2016
market volatility was triggered by fears about a]{.underline}**
potential **[Chinese currency crisis]{.underline}**, the turmoil of
August 2015 was caused by worries about a possible disorderly slowdown
in China. However, market attention seems to have been diverted away
from China as the focus has shifted to other global issues such as
Brexit, the US Federal Reserve, and the Japanese economy, QNB said.
"This raises the question whether things have genuinely improved in
China or whether markets are being complacent. We believe that on both
the currency and the growth fronts, risks in China have subsided. "Let
us start with the currency situation. The market turbulence in early
2016 was triggered by large capital outflows from China, representing
Chinese borrowers repaying some of their external debt," QNB said. The
move was motivated by the cuts in Chinese interest rates, expectations
about higher US rates, and potential devaluation of the Chinese
currency, QNB said. These factors, it noted, would have resulted in
higher debt service burden for Chinese residents borrowing in foreign
currency. The resulting large capital flight put downward pressure on
the yuan, which forced the authorities to use their reserves to defend
the currency. The large drawdown of reserves, which declined by nearly
20% between mid-2014 and January 2016, spooked investors who worried
about an out-of-control weakening of the yuan, QNB said. **[However, the
situation seems to have stabilised recently]{.underline}**, QNB said.
International reserves have been maintained at around \$3.2tn since
February 2016. Going forward, the International Monetary Fund
(**[IMF]{.underline}**) **[expects pressure on]{.underline}** the
**[currency]{.underline}** **[to ease]{.underline}** as outflows related
to external debt repayment decelerate. External **[debt has been reduced
from]{.underline}** nearly **[17% of GDP]{.underline}** **[in 2014
to]{.underline}** around **[12%]{.underline}** currently, **[according
to the IMF]{.underline}**, which also believes that the current stock of
debt is less sensitive to interest rate movements or expectations about
future currency direction as it is mainly related to trade financing.
"Regarding growth, have things improved on that front? 'Hard' data (such
as real GDP growth, retail sales, and industrial production) suggest
that the economy has slowed down in an orderly manner, reducing fears
about a potential hard landing," QNB said. But **[survey data, which
tend to be more forward looking]{.underline}**, **[suggest that activity
has turned a corner]{.underline}** since it bottomed out in September
2015. Furthermore, **[survey data point to a broad-based pickup in
activity, covering both the manufacturing and the service
sectors]{.underline}**. **["What caused this uptick in Chinese
activity?]{.underline}** Mainly **[policy stimulus]{.underline}** from
the authorities **[on both the monetary and fiscal sides]{.underline}**.
On the monetary side, interest rates were cut five times in 2015. As a
result, three-month deposit rates fell from 2.35% in early 2015 to 1.10%
by October 2015," QNB said.

#### Ending arm sales to Taiwan increases threat of china/Taiwan conflict

Cross-Straight affairs. Scott L. Kastner -- a politics in professor at

publications. William L. Reed -- professor at the University of

76wpm.15](https://www.jstor.org/stable/10.1525/j.ctt1w%2076wpm.15)) SD

How would a reduced US security commitment to Taiwan affect the
likelihood of cross-Strait conflict? More concretely, what would happen
if the United States were to terminate arms sales to the island?
Remember that in our simple model conflict occurs if Taiwan claims a
level of sovereign status to the left of point R on the I-U continuum.
How, then, might an end to arms sales affect the probability that
Taiwan's claimed status would lie to the left of point R? Here, we begin
by considering the most intuitive, direct ways that changing levels of
arms sales to Taiwan could affect the parameters of the model and the
associated implications. In the following subsection, we consider more
indirect and nonintuitive effects of ending arms sales, which in turn
serve to qualify points made in this subsection. Intuitively, it would
seem [that US arms sales to Taiwan directly affect both the costs (cc)
that China would expect to pay in a cross-Strait military conflict and
the probability (p) that China would win such a conflict]{.underline}.
On the margins at least, arms sales should improve Taiwan's military
capabilities relative to those of the PRC, thereby reducing p and
increasing cc. Of course, p and cc are determined not simply by the
balance of power between China and Taiwan but also by likely US behavior
in the event of a cross-Strait war: US intervention would at a minimum
greatly complicate the PRC's ability to prevail in a cross-Strait war
and would certainly increase China's expected costs of such a conflict.
Thus a higher likelihood of US intervention implies a smaller p and a
larger cc. [Arms sales to Taiwan]{.underline}, in turn, may [signal some
level of US commitment to the island. To the extent that arms sales to
Taiwan do in fact increase confidence in Beijing and Taipei that the
United States is likely to intervene in a cross-Strait conflict,
continued US arms sales to Taiwan imply a smaller p and larger cc than
would be the case in the counterfactual world where the United States
did not sell weapons to Taiwan]{.underline}. These direct effects
suggest, then, that [ending arms sales should reduce China's expected
costs of war and increase the probability of PRC victory]{.underline};
R, in turn, should shift to the right. This makes intuitive sense: to
the extent that the balance of power in the Taiwan Strait favors the
PRC, we might expect Beijing to be more demanding on sovereignty issues
(and less tolerant of outcomes that diverge sharply from its ideal point
of unification). [Were R to shift to the right of Taiwan's actual
status, the model suggests that the PRC would prefer to fight a war
rather than to accept a continuation of that status quo; military
conflict would ensue if Taiwan failed to accommodate this new reality by
redefining its sovereign status]{.underline} (i.e., to push the status
quo back to the right of R). [Given the obviously high costs of war for
Taiwan---costs that would presumably be especially high in the absence
of any US security commitment to the island---leaders in Taipei would
have strong incentives to avoid this outcome by bowing to new power
realities and accommodating the PRC on sovereignty issues to some
degre]{.underline}e. Yet there are some reasons to think that
accommodation in this regard would be difficult. Recall that in recent
decades the primary strategic challenge in cross-Strait relations can be
characterized as a problem of deterrence, with the PRC trying to deter
Taiwan efforts to redefine its sovereign status in a way that conflicts
with PRC hopes for unification. But if R were to shift right of the
status quo, the model suggests that the cross-Strait relationship would
instead be characterized by a problem of compellence. Here, [a war could
occur, not because the PRC fails to deter unilateral Taiwan changes to
the status quo, but rather because the PRC fails to compel Taiwan to
alter the status quo in a way that is more to Beijing's
liking]{.underline} (remember that once R shifts right of the status
quo, Beijing's expected war payoff exceeds its utility for a
continuation of the status quo). Nevertheless, commitment problems could
complicate the search for a peaceful accommodation even if Taiwan
recognized that R had moved to the right of the status quo and even if
Taiwan was in principle willing to bargain away some of its
sovereignty.17 The reason is that the issue being bargained over,
Taiwan's sovereign status, could affect future bargaining power between
the two sides: that is, bargaining some of its sovereign status to avoid
war in the short term could further diminish Taiwan's future bargaining
power vis-à-vis Beijing. Even if the United States were to stop selling
arms to Taiwan and renounce any security commitment to the island,
Taiwan would remain qualitatively different from areas under direct PRC
control. It would continue to be self-governing and democratic, it would
continue to maintain armed forces, and it would---for all intents and
purposes---continue to resemble an independent country on all dimensions
except international legal recognition. But [Taiwan's continued
otherness in this regard opens the door to possible US intervention in a
cross-Strait conflict even after a US decision to end its security
commitment to Taiwan]{.underline}. Leaders in Washington, for instance,
might revise their view of the PRC, especially in the aftermath of an
attack on Taiwan, and particularly if renouncing the security commitment
entailed a quid pro quo PRC pledge. Thus[, even after the United States
ended arms sales to Taiwan and renounced a security commitment to the
island, the probability of US intervention in a cross-Strait conflict
would not drop to zero]{.underline}---in contrast to the likelihood of
US intervention in other areas of China such as Tibet (or, for that
matter, Hong Kong). [But the more Taiwan accommodated PRC demands by
allowing itself to become something more resembling Hong Kong or Tibet
than an independent country, then the more the probability of US
intervention would begin to approach zero as it does for other areas
under direct PRC control]{.underline}. Such intervention would
increasingly, and unambiguously, represent intervention in a civil,
rather than an international, conflict.18 Thus any bargain involving a
reduction in Taiwan's sovereignty should independently reduce Beijing's
expected costs of war, thus pushing R even further to the right. The
credibility of Beijing's commitment to such a bargain would therefore be
suspect, as once it was implemented Beijing would have incentives to
demand an even more favorable bargain (and Taiwan would not be in a
position where it could refuse). Fearon develops a similar model where
states bargain over strategic territory and the outcome of the
negotiations explicitly shifts the balance of power.19 This change in
the balance of power happens because the outcome of the negotiation
transfers territory to a rival state and thereby improves that rival's
fighting capacity. When this type of dynamic is at work, reaching a
settlement becomes difficult because the consequence of the shift in
power caused by a settlement may be less desirable than fighting and
forgoing any negotiations. Although a hypothetical bargain between the
PRC and Taiwan is not over strategic territory, it is certainly possible
that a similar dynamic is at work as the PRC and Taiwan negotiate over
Taiwan's sovereignty. Inasmuch as giving up sovereignty to the PRC
strengthens the PRC's bargaining leverage, [Taiwan may come to the
conclusion that risking war is preferable to any negotiated settlement
with the PRC over unification]{.underline}. In other words, [Taiwan may
conclude that it would be better to roll the dice in a war with China
today than to accept the terms of an obsolescing bargain likely to
result in a progressively more subordinate status within a unified
China]{.underline}. Therefore, in the same way that bargaining over
strategic territory is complicated by the strategic consequences of any
deal that might be struck, [bargaining over unification can be dangerous
because it has implications for the future bargaining power of the PRC
and Taiwan]{.underline}. In summary, [ending arms sales to Taiwan would
have the potential to increase instability in the Taiwan Strait. Such a
shift in US policy could alter the balance of power in the Taiwan
Strait, which in turn could shift the strategic dynamic from deterrence
to compellence]{.underline}. In turn, there are reasons to believe that
a China-Taiwan relationship in which China tried to compel steps toward
unification would be more conflict prone than one where the PRC tried to
deter Taiwan steps toward independence, as credible commitment problems
could make it difficult for Taiwan to accommodate new power realities.

[China's integrated strategic deterrence]{.underline} concepts and
[capabilities create]{.underline} several possible [escalation
risks.]{.underline} [One challenge]{.underline} for escalation
management [derives from organizational issues, specifically the
diffusion of various parts of China's]{.underline} integrated strategic
[deterrence posture across multiple components of the PLA and the
absence of an entity such as United States Strategic Command
(USSTRATCOM) to integrate and coordinate the employment of these
capabilities.]{.underline} In particular, [this could be problematic for
strategic signaling purposes.]{.underline} One possibility is for China
to coordinate and de-conflict the different aspects of its integrated
strategic deterrence at the level of the Central Military Commission,
China's highest level of military leadership. Another possibility is to
give the leading role to China's strategic missile force, the PLA Rocket
Force (previously known as PLASAF), which could carry out this function
under the direct command of the Central Military Commission and the
leadership of the CCP. China's strategic missile force controls the
majority of China's nuclear weapons and its most potent long-range
conventional strike capabilities, and it appears poised to play a
central role in counter-space operations and "space deterrence." China
describes the PLA Rocket Force as China's "core force for strategic
deterrence,"5 as it did PLASAF prior to the January 2016 reorganization.
As the PLA Rocket Force continues to develop its nuclear, conventional,
space, and perhaps information warfare capabilities, it could
increasingly be considered a powerful integrated strategic deterrence
force in its own right. For example, SMS 2013 highlights the missile
force's role in enabling the PLA to expand its operations into other
domains, most notably space. The book suggests that China's strategic
missile force will focus on "developing new types of operations methods"
and will thus play an increasingly important role in the space and
information domains.6 [The problem of ambiguity arises regarding whether
a particular deterrence action is a nuclear or conventional signal
because the PLA Rocket Force controls both nuclear and conventional
ballistic missiles. Moreover, several other parts of the PLA spread
across multiple services control other integrated strategic deterrence
capabilities.]{.underline} Beyond the PLA Rocket Force, these include,
at a minimum, PLAN, PLAAF, and PLA Strategic Support Force. [As for
nuclear weapons, PLA Rocket Force and PLAN currently control nuclear
capabilities, and PLAAF may join them if it deploys dual-capable bombers
armed with nuclear weapons in the future.]{.underline} PLA Rocket Force,
PLAN, and PLAAF all control important capabilities that contribute to
conventional deterrence. As for space and cyberspace, prior to the
January 2016 reorganization, PLAAF and PLASAF appeared to be contending
for influence in military space and counter-space, an area in which the
General Staff Department and the General Armaments Department also
played important roles. [Similarly, multiple components of the PLA
either play a role in cyber operations or may aspire to do so. This
raises questions about how China would think about actually integrating
disparate]{.underline} Implications and Conclusions 53 [instruments of
strategic deterrence, given that these different parts of the PLA
control capabilities such as silo-based and road-mobile ICBMs and
long-range conventional missiles; nuclear-powered ballistic missile
submarines; ASAT weapons; and information- and electronic- warfare
capabilities. Indeed, this diffusion of strategic-deterrence
capabilities across multiple parts of the PLA may make truly integrated
employment of these capabilities for signaling purposes challenging and
therefore make managing escalation as envisioned in PLA publications
much more difficult]{.underline} in practice than in theory.

Proposals to scale back US security ties to Taiwan are controversial,
however, and several scholars have written thoughtful critiques of the
idea. These critiques have generally made a few key points. First[, it
is not]{.underline} self-[evident that ending security ties with Taiwan
would in fact transform the US-China relationship]{.underline}: [the
interests of the two countries arguably clash]{.underline} on many other
issues (North Korea, maritime disputes in East Asia, economic issues),
[and it is unclear why Beijing would yield on these]{.underline} other
issues if only the United States were to adopt a policy on arms sales
that---from Beijing's vantage---the United States had already committed
to follow in the 1982 joint communiqué. Second[, the United States'
reputation in the region could be at stake. Some worry that walking away
from a commitment to Taiwan would send a troubling signal to other US
allies in East Asia. Beijing might likewise view US concessions on
Taiwan as a sign of weakness and conclude that Washington was unlikely
to challenge the PRC on other issues in the region]{.underline}. Third,
ending arms sales---because it would add to Taiwan's sense of

reduced US commitment to [Taiwan]{.underline} would facilitate a
peaceful resolution to the dispute. [Finally, and relatedly, ending arms
sales would likely undercut Taiwan's deterrent capabilities, which in
turn could encourage a more coercive PRC approach to the
island.10]{.underline}

**[Risks of Appeasement over Taiwan]{.underline}** At the same time,
Barack Obama and his **[administration would incur serious costs should
they seek to fix U.S.---China relations by walking away from
Taiwan.]{.underline}** The Taiwan Relations Act (TRA) of 1979 and Ronald
Reagan's Six Assurances of 1982 created a framework for
Washington---Taipei interaction after the United States withdrew
diplomatic recognition in 1979.6 Although neither measure involved a
legally binding expectation that Washington come to Taiwan's
rescueparticularly if it requires the use of forcethey do provide for
the supply of defensive weapons and maintaining a U.S. capability in the
region to help Taiwan. They have prevented successive administrations
from pressuring Taiwan into cross-Strait negotiations or undertaking
mediation, lest Washington become responsible for implementing
agreements and managing the consequences of failure. **[Various U.S.
interests support continuing arms sales to]{.underline}**, and close
economic relations with, an autonomous **[Taiwan]{.underline}**. For
instance, the **[U.S. defense industry profits from]{.underline}**, and
so encourages, **[Taiwan's weapons procurement]{.underline}**.
Diplomats, the Pentagon, scholars, and other analysts have argued that
**[arms sales help Taiwan defend itself, strengthen morale among
Taiwan's population, deter Beijing, insure Taipei has the confidence to
negotiate with China, and that if talks go wrong Taiwan could fight
until U.S. forces arrived]{.underline}**. **[Weapons

be had for Americans]{.underline}**. **[F-16 fighter aircraft illustrate
the critical significance of defense contractors in sustaining the
Taiwan relationship]{.underline}**. George H. W. Bush, ignoring
commitments to Beijing as well as objections from within his
administration, decided to sell 150 fighters to Taipei during the 1992
presidential election campaign, hoping to insure re-election by
providing a \$4 billion contract and 5,800 jobs to General Dynamics'
operations in Texas.7 In 2011, a bipartisan group of 45 U.S. senators
advocating new F-16 sales and upgrades of existing aircraft not only
warned President Obama that Taiwan would be forced to ground some 70
percent of its fighters by 2020 without U.S. action, but that Lockheed
Martin's F-16 **[production line would shut down without orders for
Taiwan]{.underline}**. Industry analysts estimate this would mean the
loss of some 11,000 jobs in 43 states.8 Another side to U.S. abandonment
of Taiwan is the trajectory of events that would follow such a momentous
alteration of U.S. policy. Would it help or hurt U.S. interests that
Taiwan, almost certainly, would not be able to sustain its de facto
independence, and would be compelled, in some form, to accommodate
China's unification agenda? That alone could be profoundly disturbing to
American liberals as well as conservatives for whom Taiwan's vibrant
democracy has appeared to be a vanguard for political development in
Asia. China has promised it would not station forces on Taiwan, use the
island to project power into the Pacific, interfere with critical
commercial and military sea lanes, or control Taiwan's affairs apart
from foreign and military relations. It has pledged to facilitate
Taiwan's presence in international organizations and be generous in
multiplying and deepening economic ties. But **[as the application of
China's ''one country, two systems'' formula in Hong Kong has
demonstrated, 26 nurturing democratic institutions under a communist
umbrella is all but impossible.]{.underline}** So if China were to be
perceived as coercive, unreasonable, or unjust, **[Taiwan's fate would

[Miscalculation and Misperception]{.underline} [The transmission of

nuclear crises, strategic communication between adversaries
is]{.underline} simply [crucial]{.underline}. [There are numerous
examples of miscommunication in past nuclear crises.]{.underline} In
1962, for example, Washington conveyed a series of signals to Moscow
that should have been sent by Moscow to Soviet submarines but were not
actually sent until some days later---only for the information to be
flatly ignored. In the contemporary world[, the potential for
bad]{.underline} communication [or]{.underline} even [lack of
communication should be taken into account, and new problems must be
factored in as well, including cyberattacks]{.underline} on command and
control systems. A world of [deception might ensue from the rise of
China, given the importance of this concept in the Chinese defense
doctrine. Mobility and concealment are key to their nuclear
development]{.underline}: Knowing the number of missiles will avail
their enemies nothing if they do not know the location of their targets.
Only maintaining finetoothed-comb surveillance of all the land areas and
the vast oceans, which is pretty impractical, might solve the problem.
[Some may argue that both deception and concealment give Beijing a sense
of confidence that enhances their overall stability, but this is hardly
the view of China's neighbors, perplexed by the continuous lack of
transparency]{.underline} concerning both current holdings and future
intentions. [This is likely to increase the risk of misperception and
miscalculation in the future.]{.underline}

[How Limited Can War Be? Several of America's previous limited wars were
fought against vastly weaker and nonnuclear powers. Yet China is not
vastly weaker than the United States, and the United States would be
unwise to assume crisis or conflict with China would remain
limited.]{.underline} Carl von Clausewitz theorized that war is a
"paradoxical trinity---composed of primordial violence, hatred, and
enmity,"38 and [conclusions extrapolated from previous wars cannot
completely inform American policymakers in their thinking about the
possibility of conflict with China.]{.underline} Many current
[discussions of the likelihood of conventional confrontation leading to
nuclear conflict are not logically consistent.]{.underline} Writers
often simplify their analyses and presume the use of nuclear weapons is
so unlikely it can simply be ignored. As an example, defense policy
advisor Michael Pillsbury specifically depicts 16 Chinese fears, 6 of
which specifically apply to conventional crisis or conflict scenarios:
fear of an island blockade, fear of aircraft carrier strikes, fear of
major airstrikes, fear of attacks on strategic missile forces, fear of
jamming or precision strikes, and fear of attacks on antisatellite
capabilities.39 Yet [despite China's proximate fears, some analysts
propose strategies that directly stimulate those fears while ignoring
the nuclear threat.]{.underline}40 In the Journal of Strategic Studies,
Sean Mirski of Harvard Law School explores how the United States might
implement a blockade strategy against China but also admits, "The United
States will probably never have to consider implementing a blockade in
the context of an unlimited war because such a conflict . . . could only
arise subsequent to a total breakdown in nuclear deterrence."41
Additionally, T.X. Hammes of the National Defense University promotes a
distant blockade of China that "establishes a set of concentric rings
that denies China the use of the sea inside the first island chain,
defends the sea and air space of the first island chain, and dominates
the air and maritime space outside the island chain."42 [All these
concepts fail to adequately consider that China is a nuclear capable
nation with several hundred warships. Even though not all of those
warships are extremely able or their crews proficient, analysts should
not assume China would allow the United States to starve China's economy
with a blockade. A blockade would threaten China's regime and easily
cause it to resort to force, and perhaps nuclear force. Precisely
because some analysts do not understand China's psychology and assess
scenarios devoid of nuclear risk, promoting these strategies may
increase the likelihood of nuclear miscalculation.]{.underline} Finally,
the [precedent of U.S. actions will determine the future validity of
extended nuclear deterrence]{.underline}, and [if U.S. commitment is
rapidly eclipsed by desires to de-escalate, other nations may find
renewed desire to both increase their own conventional weapon
capabilities and seek their own nuclear arsenal]{.underline}. Nations
such as [Japan and South Korea may decide America's extended deterrent
guarantees are unreliable and pursue nuclear weapons]{.underline} as
security against nuclear attack.43 [The United States must anticipate
how difficult it might be to pursue a limited conflict due to the
political pressures to defend other nations]{.underline} in the region
and prevent nuclear proliferation.

Choice between Military Competition and Accommodation," International
Security, Volume 39, Number 4, Spring 2015, pp. 49-90 (Article)) RK

If accommodation on Taiwan would increase U.S. security even without
reciprocal Chinese concessions, then it is necessary to consider whether
**[the greater beneªts]{.underline}** that **[would]{.underline}** **[be
provided by a grand bargain warrant the risks of forgoing the beneªts of
unilateral accommodation altogether.]{.underline}** In other words,
**[if a grand bargain is likely infeasible, should the United States
unilaterally end its commitment to Taiwan? It is necessary to consider
this possibility because the long-standing disputes in the South China
and East China Seas might continue to defy resolution.]{.underline}**
**[Possibly most signiªcant, the recent escalation of tensions between
China and Japan,]{.underline}** and the hardening of their positions,
**[suggests that the prospects for resolution of the Senkaku/Diaoyu
dispute are decreasing.]{.underline}** Although the probability of
achieving a grand bargain may be low, **[the United States should not
now unilaterally end its commitment to defend Taiwan. China appears too
likely to misinterpret such a large change in U.S. policy, which could
fuel Chinese overconªdence and intensify challenges to U.S.
interests---most importantly, the U.S. security role in Northeast
Asia.]{.underline}** In large part, **[this judgment is informed by
China's more assertive regional policies and pronouncements over the
past decade.]{.underline}** I do believe, though, that this is a close
call. **[Prior to 2008 or so, unilateral accommodation might have been
the United States' best option]{.underline}**. Thus, a sustained
moderation in China's policies could support a different decision in the
future. Finally, U.S. pursuit of a grand bargain would not prevent the
United States from eventually moving to unilateral accommodation---if
during U.S. pursuit of a grand bargain China made clear that agreement
was impossible, unilateral accommodation would remain a fallback option.
U**[.S. unilateral adoption of less dramatic changes in the government's
Taiwan policy---most importantly, slowing or ending U.S. arms sales to

RK

[The U.S. has sold arms to Taiwan since establishing diplomatic
relations with the People's Republic of China]{.underline}. These [arms
sales help the U.S. to fulfill the security commitment to the island
based on the]{.underline} 1979 Taiwan Relations Act ([TRA]{.underline}).
However, with the current approach, the U.S. is failing to help Taiwan
to deter China, and also risks U.S.-Taiwan-China trilateral relations.
Instead, [the U.S. can sell more arms]{.underline}, especially those for
defensive purposes, to Taiwan in a steady stream of small increments.
The U.S. should announce and deliver arms packages separately, bringing
the price tag for each sale below \$1 billion. The advantages of this
approach are significant: Bolster U.S. credibility. China's severe
complaints about U.S. arms sales raise insecurity and doubts not only in
Taiwan, but also with other U.S. allies in the region: South Korea and
Japan. With the suggested approach---selling more arms, but below the
radar --- the United States can uphold its security commitments as well
as international obligations. It will significantly enhance U.S.
credibility in the region, especially among U.S. allies. Stabilize
U.S.-Taiwan-China trilateral relations. Smaller arms deals between the
U.S. and Taiwan are much less likely to irritate China. China will find
it difficult to impose severe sanctions because of an arms deal only
worth millions of dollars. The U.S. has been balancing between China and
Taiwan since 1979, and has successfully avoided significant conflict
across the strait. Peace has provided the environment for the growth of
Taiwan's democracy, as well as the vast increase of trade between the
U.S. and China. This policy will help the U.S. to maintain the status
quo. Secure Taiwan and its democracy. **[The increased number of arms
sold will equip Taiwan with better capability to deter China. If China
were to conduct an attack, Taiwan would be able to resist longer before
the U.S. came to rescue.]{.underline}** Facing the rapid rise of Chinese
military power and [the prospect of decreased U.S. arms sales, Taiwan
has become more and more vulnerable against China. This policy will help
to secure Taiwan and its democracy.]{.underline}

At the G-20 summit this week, Chinese President Xi Jinping may pressure
U.S. President Donald Trump to halt a planned U.S. arms deal with
Taiwan. Xi may even offer a tantalizing (but unreliable) concession on
the trade dispute in return for concessions on Taiwan. Accepting such an
offer would undermine U.S. national security and the democratic
principles Americans support. [Bullies tend to start fights they think
they can win, an important consideration when it comes to deterring
Beijing from aggression against Taiwan. Unfortunately, due to China's
massive military mobilization and Washington's past reluctance to
provide sufficient arms to Taiwan, the military balance of power in the
Taiwan Strait has shifted in Beijing's direction]{.underline} ---
[making war there more likely. **To begin reducing this risk**,
**Washington would be wise to follow through on delivery of the pending
arms package for Taiwan.** Based on the hope that economic
liberalization would lead to political liberalization, Washington
facilitated Beijing's integration into the global economy]{.underline}.
American support for China's entry into the World Trade Organization
epitomized this strategy. Unfortunately, [increased wealth did not
launch an inexorable march toward freedom in China.]{.underline}
Instead, the Chinese Communist Party, or [CCP, used its financial
windfall to fund a major military expansion, bully its neighbors and
attempt to push the U.S. out of the region.]{.underline} These [dynamics
have been perhaps most pronounced in the Taiwan Strait.]{.underline}
Taiwan is prosperous and democratic, which creates an uncomfortable
contrast for the CCP and an object of emulation for its subjects on the
mainland. As in Hong Kong, the people of Taiwan have grown accustomed to
their freedoms and are reluctant to give them up. Impatient --- and
determined to exert control over the island --- [Beijing has employed
political and military means to isolate and intimidate
Taiwan]{.underline}. First, Beijing has pressed countries to cut ties
with Taiwan. [In 2018 alone, China successfully pressured three more
countries to sever Taiwanese relations]{.underline}, leaving only 17
that recognize the island's government. Taiwan's diplomatic isolation
makes American support all the more important. More dangerously, **[due
primarily to its extraordinary military buildup, Beijing is moving ever
closer to an ability to successfully invade the island]{.underline}**.
The U.S. Defense Department's Indo-Pacific Strategy Report released this
month notes that "China has never renounced the use of military force
against Taiwan, and continues to develop and deploy advanced military
capabilities needed for a potential military campaign." Indeed, [as
demonstrated by an increased number of military exercises near Taiwan,
the report warns that the People's Liberation Army is "preparing for a
contingency to unify Taiwan with the mainland by force."]{.underline} In
the past, [Taiwan's superior technology and geography gave Taiwan a
military edge when it came to a potential conflict in the
strait]{.underline}. [However]{.underline}, as the Pentagon noted, [due
to China's military buildup, those advantages are now largely
gone.]{.underline} In fact, as the Defense Intelligence Agency's 2019
report on Chinese military power assessed, "[Beijing's longstanding
interest to eventually compel Taiwan's reunification with the mainland
and deter any attempt by Taiwan to declare independence has served as
the primary driver for China's military modernization]{.underline}."
Simultaneously, [based on an overzealous and counterproductive desire in
previous administrations to avoid offending Beijing, Washington has
often been reluctant to provide Taiwan the arms it needed. Fearful to
not provoke the Chinese]{.underline}, the Obama administration rejected
Taiwanese requests for 66 new F-16 fighter jets --- instead only
offering modifications for its aging aircraft. Admittedly, America's
arms sales to Taiwan are relatively modest compared to China's military
buildup. However, **[the failure to provide Taiwan the required weapons
exacerbated the shift toward Beijing in the military
balance]{.underline}**. As a result, across most combat domains, Beijing
has established both a quantitative and qualitative advantage over
Taiwan.

There are certain **[core issues troubling the Sino-U.S.

and human rights, the **[challenges currently testing the bilateral

contrary, an **[American abandonment of Taiwan might only succeed in

desire to see America progressively retreat from the Indo-Pacific
theater]{.underline}**. Bonnie Glaser and Nancy Bernkopf Tucker have
expressed their concerns \[12\] over such a development, cautioning that
**[A decision to jettison Taiwan, or even cut back significantly on U.S.
support, would prove to an increasingly confident China that Washington

unreliable]{.underline}**...Accordingly, **[a U.S. sacrifice of Taiwan,
while gratifying, could not thoroughly slake a continuing need for
Beijing to demonstrate its power. Indeed, the sacrifice might promote
new appetites and necessitate fresh efforts to satisfy that
need.]{.underline}**

#### Keeping military commitments and arms sales to Taiwan is key to effective containment and preventing miscalc

**Office of Defense Studies '15**

(Office of Defense Studies at the Ministry of National Defense, Republic
of China, December 2015, "Challenges and Opportunities in the South
China Sea," p. 7, JH)

Given the structural stress in the US-China power transition and the
uncertainty about China's foreign policy goals, how does Taiwan fit into
this? As noted above, US security objective in Asia is to maintain a
balance of power and to prevent any country from dominating the region.
In this strategic context, **[Taiwan's geographical location is of
particular importance to the US]{.underline}**. **[The island controls
the sea lines of communication]{.underline}** (SLOCs) **[extending from
Japan to Southeast Asia and serves as a check on China's maritime
expansions into the East and the South China Seas.]{.underline}** **[As
China rises, Taiwan's strategic value to the US will rise]{.underline}**
as well. The imperatives of the balance of power will prompt Washington
to give more thought to Taiwan's defense needs. **[Taiwan has
substantial economic and military resources to contribute to America's
balancing efforts.]{.underline}** For their own strategic interests,
"\[US policy makers\] will be inclined to back Taiwan no matter what."16
Far from being a strategic liability, as advocates of abandoning Taiwan
believes, Taiwan is a strategic asset for the US and its allies. During
Cold War, Gen. Douglas MacArthur famously referred to Taiwan as an
"unsinkable aircraft carrier." Today, **[China's strategic planners see
Taiwan as an integral part of its future naval power]{.underline}**, as
a way to break out of the encirclement of the First Island Chain.
**[Beijing's acquisition of Taiwan would enhance China's naval
capabilities and give the PLA Navy greater strategic depth. It would
adversely affect Japan's maritime security]{.underline}**, making it
more difficult for the US to defend its ally. **[Taiwan's close location
to the Philippine Sea and the Luzon Strait would also provide the PLA
Navy easy access to the South China Sea, an area fraught with
territorial disputes.]{.underline}** The changing international
structure will push Washington and Taipei into closer defense
cooperation. The security interests of both countries are compatible.
**[It makes good strategic sense for the US to help strengthen Taiwan's
defense capabilities to deter a Chinese attack]{.underline}**. **[US
arms sales to Taiwan]{.underline}**, rather than being an unnecessary
provocation to China, as those in favor of abandoning Taiwan believe,
actually **[strengthen regional stability.]{.underline}** **[A basic
requirement for effective deterrence in the Taiwan Strait is that Taiwan
should at least have the capabilities to withstand an initial Chinese
attack until the US has sufficient time to respond.]{.underline}** The
arms sales not only fulfill a legal obligation under the Taiwan
Relations Act but also serve US strategic interests. A **[robust defense
makes Taiwan less vulnerable to China's military coercion and helps
preserve regional peace. China is opposed to US arms sales for the
simple reason that a militarily weak Taiwan will be more compliant to
Beijing's demands. But a weakly defended Taiwan could temp Chinese
leadership to use the implied threat of force to coerce the island into
negotiations for unification.]{.underline}** **[Once this process is
started]{.underline}**, it would be difficult for the US to stay on the
sideline and watch a democracy being forced to accommodate an
authoritarian state under duress. For their part, the Chinese leaders
would find it difficult to back down without losing domestic legitimacy.
**[A spiral of escalation would generate perilous dynamics and threaten
regional peace. Conversely, a well-defended Taiwan would reduce this
source of dangerous miscalculation]{.underline}**, which
counterintuitively is also in China's interest.17
