I did not know it then, but three years later, I would be a doctoral
student at UC Berkeley and knee deep in the Movement for Black Lives.
The example that BYP 100 set for us during MLK Weekend reminds us of the
radical potential of Black youth politics. [[Here you have

lens---[[organize for redistribution with a thorough critique of the
political economy and]{.underline}]{.mark} its [[connections to
state-sanctioned violence.]{.underline}]{.mark} [[They see
the]{.underline}]{.mark} connections to the investment in carceral
technologies of violence5 and the divestment in their lives through the
[[neoliberal marriage between the state and public
services.]{.underline}]{.mark}6 I participated in [[BlackXMas

[[pressured the University of California]{.mark}]{.underline} system

thread was a focus on state-sanctioned and funded models of violence,
and they all became targets. 4. Robin D.G. Kelley, Freedom Dreams: The

ABOLITION Within the social movement repertoire of this new generation,
[[the digital literacy of young activists was activated in order to
spread a coherent message about the need to divest monies from
oppressive entities and invest them in the growth of our
communities]{.underline}]{.mark}, which can be seen in Figure 3.9 In
conjunction with the assault that Black students took on their
universities across the country, we are witnessing something that is
otherwise unprecedented: the radical potential of Black youth organizing
and politics.

#### Narratives and critique of social oppression are good for debate -- those who have experienced oppression firsthand have the knowledge to end it

[[The term "critical" in Critical Black Youth Politics serves a specifc
function]{.underline}]{.mark}, and that function is [[rooted in an
analysis of the ways that]{.underline}]{.mark} hegemony, dominance,
[[and social stratifcation shape our]{.underline}]{.mark} everyday
[[lives]{.underline}]{.mark}. [[This]{.underline}]{.mark} particular
segment of Critical Black Youth Politics [[is predicated on the idea
that power has an influence in our collective life
outcomes]{.underline}]{.mark}, and that by naming the ways that this
power operates, one can work to transform the context where power is
situated. **[[Without that analysis, specifically of race,
class,]{.underline}]{.mark}** FIGURE 3. MATERIAL FROM THE MOVEMENT FOR

oppression]{.underline}]{.mark}**, which Daniel Solorzano and Dolores

oppression, one can potentially reinforce respectability, and reinforce
the standards of "who" gets to be advocated for and who gets to be a

[[The Ella Baker model of leadership]{.underline}]{.mark}, even though

in the notion that the people who are the most impacted by interlocking
systems of oppression are the experts in their own experiences, that
they have the knowledge to liberate themselves.]{.underline}]{.mark}**
This tradition of participation and inclusion fueled the Mississippi
freedom movement and organizations like the Student Nonviolent
Coordinating Committee (SNCC),12 which are being adopted today by
organizations such as the Black Liberation Collective,13 the national
organization that helped to coordinate the #StudentBlackout movement.14

For better or worse, [the U.S. academy]{.underline} (both the specific
institutional site of the college/university and the broader, shifting
political-intellectual terrains of "the academy") may be one fruitful
place from which to catalyze this work. [Activisms]{.underline} that
[form in confrontation with]{.underline}    a[the academy]{.underline}'s
long historical [complicities in racial/colonial genocide]{.underline}
might be understood within an "urgency imperative" that [seeks to
denaturalize]{.underline} and ultimately [dismantle the conditions in
which]{.underline} these [systems of massive violence]{.underline} are
reproduced.  There are thriving circuits of [radical
thought]{.underline} that [aim to do]{.underline} just
[that]{.underline}: for example, the very presence of anticolonialism,
black radicalism, Native American feminism, and prison abolitionism as
recognizable streams of scholarly and pedagogical labor within
institutional spaces---and more importantly, the vibrant and urgent ways
in which many (though still far too few) people inhabit these spaces has
become a matter of life and death in more ways than one. The capacities
to produce such scholarship (including the creation of counterarchives,
vital epistemological and theoretical tools, course syllabi, and
mentorship) have been hard-won by multiple histories of liberation
struggle and intense intellectual innovation, and cohere in the academy
through affinities of ideas, analytics, and scholars whose work is
mutually nourishing and critically enabling. The
"[activist]{.underline}" importance of these circuits cannot be
overstated; at their best, their [political-intellectual work
is]{.underline} engaged in something resembling a collective [standoff
with]{.underline} the most mundanely violent forms of [dehumanization,
humiliation, displacement, and immobilization.]{.underline} The
interrogations are grave: What are the ethical and political
implications of chronicling the racial-sexual violence of U.S. lynching
in continuity with less spectacular (and differently gendered) forms of
antiblack state and state-condoned violence such as police abuse,
welfare policy, and school segregation? To what degree have the critical
renarrations of the U.S. racial colonialist project ---from the Americas
to the Philippines---enabled a productive denaturing of the violent,
theological mythologies of liberal white humanism, multiculturalist
democracy, and national progress (all of which require a code of silence
on the actual existence of colonized peoples on U.S. sovereign and
occupied soil)?^5^ These are just two examples in which dedicated
activist scholarly labor has uncovered the unexceptional normal of
genocidal and protogenocidal social logics. 

Such [intellectual practices can renarrate racial terror and
misery]{.underline}, the forms of suffering endemic to multicultural
civil society. Within this collective work, there is possibility for
effective (though never permanent) denaturalizations---and
politicizations---of the forms of human suffering, entrapment, and
vulnerability that are otherwise routinely embedded in the current
world's institutional protocols, and death-inducing organization of
resources.

## A2 Reform

#### Activism through the state is impossible. The structure of racial oppression can't be reformed

[[Even though Black youth are positioned in]{.underline}]{.mark} civil
[[society]{.underline}]{.mark} as amoral, deviant, and [[in need of
state intervention,]{.underline}]{.mark} young [[Black people across the
country are engaging in]{.underline}]{.mark} a new wave of
[[intersectional Black organizing that has not been seen on such a
popular scale]{.underline}]{.mark} in this country.
[[These]{.underline}]{.mark} young [[people]{.underline}]{.mark}---my
generation---[[are currently providing a counter to the cultural matrix
that some scholars use to examine the plight of young Black
people]{.underline}]{.mark} without seeking the transformation of the
context that caused said plight.18 This deficit model of understanding
fails to capture political agency, and presents Black youth as merely
static in our conditions. However, for some scholars, engaged Black
youth are not enough. Technologies of control are the only interventions
that come from scholarship 16. Shawn A. Ginwright, Black Youth Rising:

College Press, 2010). 17. Juliet Hooker. "Black Lives Matter and the

focus on our "decisions" to buy fast food and not catch the bus, without
questioning the structural conditions that lead to such decisions.
**[[The political and intellectual left]{.underline}]{.mark}**, even
with claims to social justice and social change, **[[still cannot
reconcile the call of Black people to make their lives matter to a state
that is literally invested in their demise.]{.underline}]{.mark}**19 The
unsettling notion of Black Lives Matter highlights a fundamental faw in
racial equity reform logic: that **[[Blackness cannot be reconciled in
an anti-Black state with a political economy built on their backs and
indigenous land.]{.underline}]{.mark}** **[[This is why claims to
"reform" are largely absent from the rhetoric of Black youth
organizers]{.underline}]{.mark}** in this movement. **[[We recognize the
failures of attempting to be incorporated into a state dependent on our
suffering]{.underline}]{.mark}**, and that is why we are calling for
abolition, redistribution, and intervention into the settler colonial
project of expendable Blackness.20 We also recognize what Lester Spence
refers to as the neoliberal turn in Black politics.21 As corporations
and the privatization of activism have invested interests in our
continued racialized suffering,22 [[we have]{.underline}]{.mark} largely
[[rejected the calls of "efficiency"]{.underline}]{.mark} and
"participation[" [in a polity where marginalization is its only frame of
reference.]{.mark}]{.underline}23

## Carceral violence v women

#### Prisons are the epicenter for experimentation on women's bodies , however the oppression spills into the practice of gynecology 

**Schmid 18** (Anastazia Schmid has spent nearly 18 years behind bars
for killing her abusive partner, Tony Heathcote.) ("Crafting the Perfect
Woman: How Gynecology,Obstetrics, and American Prisons Operate to
Construct and Control. Women," Abolition: A Journal of Insurgent

In another case study on injuries and diseases of female genitals,
Parvin quotes a colleague about the concealment of "foreign bodies" in a
woman's vagina, "Levrat says that he has removed a sponge which had been
in the vagina twenty-three years, and had only then begun to cause
injurious results." Furthermore he cites another ludicrous case titled
"double vagina" declaring, "coitus had for some years been practiced
through the urethra." These case studies and publications of female
'medical conditions,' despite being far-fetched even for archaic times
were nonetheless believed. Are we to assume toxic shock (identified as
such or not) ceased to exist and men's engorged penises were small
enough to fit inside a urethra in the nineteenth century? Regardless of
what we may think reading such farcical statements, [[the field of
gynecology and obstetrics were founded on these beliefs solidified by
male physicians]{.underline}.]{.mark} Those of us who actually have
vaginas intrinsically know what utter nonsense this is, but [[women's
words about their lives and bodies (incarcerated or otherwise) are
almost completely absent or discredited in early records of female
medical science]{.underline}.]{.mark} Perhaps by some strange irony[,
[the primordial fear of women holding men's penises captive provides
unconscious justification for a male-dominated criminal justice system
that holds women's entire bodies captive]{.mark}]{.underline}.
Interestingly, no one seems to question why a counterpart to gynecology
as a specialized field of medicine ceases to exist, or the deeper
implications as to why it ceases to exist. There is no exclusive medical
field limited and dedicated solely to the study, functions, treatment,
and diseases of the penis and testicles, particularly not as a
profession created and dominated by women. I can't help but note [[the
extreme sardonicism that penology is the study of prisons, not penises,
or that prisons became the ideal location to conduct gynecological and
obstetrics experimentation]{.underline}]{.mark}. Interestingly, not all
women at the reformatory acted alone in acts of sexual misconduct. The
1881 investigation also reported nefarious happenings involving prisoner
pregnancy, abortions, and infanticide. Nancy Clem, another prisoner at
the reformatory, reported night watchman, Mr. Barrett as the sexual
assailant of Molly Scott and Nancy Evans. While additional allegations
of illegitimate pregnancies and abortions were claimed to be performed.

## WS Impact Ext

#### White supremacy in the US has led to the killing of people of color through the US's history with the slave trade and genocides, and currently through mass incarceration of people and color and the daily murder of black people by white cops whose actions are never penalized

K. Laaman is an Anti-Imperialist political prisoner, imprisoned for
actions carried out by United Freedom Front (UFF) a left-wing guerrilla
group active in the US in the early \'80s. OL)

[Life in the United States includes white cops routinely]{.underline},
that is, [on a daily basis, killing people of color.]{.underline} The
government and [legal authorities always have and continue to rule
almost all of these killings as]{.underline} lawful and [acceptable
actions of the state]{.underline}. So how can this be, that in the 21st
century in a country supposedly based on law, Black people and other
people of color can be routinely abused and even killed by agents of the
state? It's not a mistake and it isn't about Republicans or Democrats.
**[[It is a historical and ongoing reality that people of color face
institutional disparity and discrimination from all aspects of the U.S.
state apparatus]{.underline}]{.mark}**. On a human individual level, [a
large percentage of white people have at least some prejudicial
attitudes towards people of color]{.underline}. It is true that
throughout history, especially in the 20th century, great leaders and
massive popular struggles confronted and challenged institutional
discrimination and racist practices. Marcus Garvey, W.E.B. Dubois,
Malcolm X, Rosa Parks, Martin Luther King Jr., Cesar Chavez, Fannie Lou
Hamer, H. Rap Brown, Huey P. Newton, Assata Shakur, all these and so
many more outstanding reformers and/or revolutionary leaders and
activists, contributed signifcantly to the struggle for justice,
freedom, and equality for Black people and all people of color in the
United States. Yes, progress has been made. Barack Obama, the frst Black
man to be president, was twice elected. Yet [**[everywhere we
look]{.mark}**, right on the surface and especially if we dig
deeper,]{.underline} **[[institutional discrimination, prejudice, and
racist practices and abuses continue in all aspects of
life]{.underline}]{.mark}** in the United States. In 2016, the United
States is a majority white country**[[. The United States comprises 5
percent of the world's population, but incarcerates 25 percent of the
world's prisoners]{.underline}]{.mark}**. **[[The majority of prisoners
across the]{.underline}]{.mark}** **[[U]{.underline}]{.mark}**nited
**[[S]{.underline}]{.mark}**tates **[[are people of
color]{.underline}]{.mark}**. And on a daily basis **[[Black men,
women]{.underline}]{.mark}**, **[[and]{.underline}]{.mark}** even
**[[children are]{.underline}]{.mark}** [shot]{.underline} and often
**[[killed by mainly white cops, who]{.underline}]{.mark}**
[almost]{.underline} **[[always are cleared of any
wrongdoing]{.underline}]{.mark}**. These are the indisputable realities
in early twenty-first century life in the United States. If we look back
**[[historically we can see even more blatant and vicious racist
abuses]{.underline}]{.mark}** and practices in all areas of life,
**[[directed against all people of color]{.underline}]{.mark}**. [This
began with the earliest European contact and conquest of the
Americas]{.underline}. **[[Genocide, land theft, slavery of Indigenous
people and the African slave trade]{.underline}]{.mark}**, this was the
origin of all the modern countries in North, Central and South America.

#### In order to resist white supremacy, white people must use their privilege to dismantle racist institutions

From the early period of colonialism[**[, when white supremacy was being
constructed on lies]{.mark}**, material benefts based on white skin
privileges, **[and the super exploitation of Black labor, there also was
opposition and resistance to this hateful thinking and prac-
tice]{.mark}**]{.underline}. [[**Native and Black people found many ways
to resist and op- pose slavery, from running away to burning down the
plantation**,]{.mark} sometimes with the slave owner still
inside]{.underline}. From these earliest times of resistance**[[, there
were white people who supported and assisted with the escapes and
uprisings. The "underground rail- road" was operational for well over
100 years. Networks]{.underline}]{.mark}**, often of white homes and
farms, **[[gave refuge and assistance to Blacks who escaped from slave
plantations and traveled north]{.underline}]{.mark}**, sometimes all the
way to Canada, to seek freedom. [The Abolitionist movement actively
worked for the end of slavery. It included many white activists and
leaders. Although fewer in number, there also were militant white
abolitionists like John Brown, who literally, with guns in hand, freed
Black people held as slaves on plantations in Missouri and Virginia.
There have always been white people, often in leftist and revolutionary
organizations and sometimes from religious groups, who have allied with
and supported the freedom strug- gle and the National Liberations
struggles of New African/Black, Native/Indigenous, Puerto Rican and
Chicano people]{.underline}. White people were in the Civil rights
movement, communists in labor and community struggles, and students,
antiracists and anti- imperialist activists supported the Black Power
struggles. In the eighties and nineties the John Brown Anti-Klan
Committee active- ly organized against racist attacks and terror,
whether the racists were in white robes or blue uniforms. Other
antiracist formations, like the Partisan Defense Committee, which is
still active today, organize large anti-Klan rallies in many cities. [In
2016**[, we see the Movement for Black Lives mobilizing on a nationwide
level]{.mark}**]{.underline}, including the recent release of their
comprehensive platform**[[. We also see this movement gaining solidarity
and support from a va- riety of white activists and organizations, as
well as from other communities and people of
color.]{.underline}]{.mark}** [**[White supremacy]{.mark}**, in theory
and in actual racist practice, **[has always had opposition. This
resistance has and does include white people acting as allies and
supporters of nationalist organizations and working in multinational
formations.]{.mark}**]{.underline}

## Abolition Key/Method Solvency

Only through Intense Dreaming and embracing the politics of Indigenous
resurgence can we work towards denaturalizing white settler colonialism,
carceral feminisms and their genealogies

Palacios 16(Lena Palacios, "With Immediate Cause: Intense Dreaming as
World-Making," *Abolition: A Journal of Insurgent Politics,* no. 1 WITH
IMMEDIATE CAUSE INTENSE DREAMING AS WORLD-MAKING *Lena Palacios We
cannot live without our lives.)\*
---Banner held by Combahee River Collective members protesting the
sexual assault and murder of twelve Black women in the Boston area in
the first six months of 1979. The body count of stigmatized,
criminalized, incarcerated,\
legally eliminated, socially dead, expendable and disposable, sexually
violated, tortured, missing, and murdered Indigenous girls, girls and
women of color, queer and trans youth of color continues to climb. The
growing murder suicide rates, statistics of missing and murdered
Indigenous and Black women, should no longer surprise or overwhelm us
but incite us to urgent action and theorization in line with radical
women of color feminist movements mobilizing to end gendered and
racialized violence endemic to the carceral state. A feeling of mortal
urgency hounds us everywhere, every day, all the time, all at once in
white settler societies liken ours; it surrounds, envelops, and blankets
us, most often lulling us into a deep, depressed, dreamless stupor
rendering us hopeless and immobilized. Many of us have already lost the
battle. How many Black and Indigenous girls and women have had their
lives cut short by interpersonal, intimate, state and state-sponsored
violence since the Black socialist lesbian feminist Combahee River
Collective first held up that banner boldly declaring "We cannot live
without our lives" and initiated a self-help and antiviolence community
mobilization in the late seventies? At other times, when not killed-off,
bought-off, co-opted, or placated by the carceral state and its
so-called kinder and gentler politics of recognition and reconciliation
and its nonprofit, professionalized social service apparatuses, we
channel the pent-up sum of our intergenerational rage into "dreaming
big" and "making power" within our families, intimate relations, and
communities. The mortal urgency lies in us staying dormant and
continuing to patiently\
over-rely on the carceral state to guarantee the health of our lands and
waterways, our human and civil rights, our bodily integrity, our safety
and security, our health and well-being, our children's futures rather
than aligning ourselves with radical Black feminist, Indigenous
de-colonial, and prison abolitionist movements. We fail to listen and
actively disengage with these (re)emergent and resurgent movements that
resist the liberal and neoliberal state's politics of recognition,
visibility, and inclusion at our own peril. Five hundred years after the
advent of colonial genocide and chattel slavery, the stakes are as high
as ever. As Ntozake Shange declares, "We all have immediate cause." As
Indigenous feminist Paula Gunn Allen put it, so much has been taken away
by racialized gendered violence and carceral state violence that "the
place we live now is an idea."2 I am compelled by the kinds of futures
that Indigenous feminists and radical women of color feminists envision,
and create, outside of Western, non-Indigenous inflections of
sovereignty, the nation-state, and a liberal politics of recognition.
[[In order to support these generative and transformative projects and
ways of knowing, we need to visualize, speak, and practice toward what
we do dream and create.]{.underline}]{.mark} According to Dian Million,
["[intense dreaming" is indispensable to the urgent demand made by
Indigenous feminist activist-scholars to sidestep the "static
taxidermies" of Western epistemologies and to privilege Indigenous
non-Western ways of knowing]{.underline}]{.mark}Million writes,
[Dreaming . . . is the effort to make sense of relations in the worlds
we live, dreaming and empathizing intensely our relations with past and
present and the future without the boundaries of linear
time.]{.underline} [[Dreaming is a communicative sacred activity.
Dreaming often allows us to creatively side-step all the neat little
boxes that obscure larger relations and syntheses of imagination. . . .
Dreaming, theory, narrative, and critical thinking are not exclusive of
each other. They form different ways of knowing,]{.underline}]{.mark}
and I will ask that we might imagine them as uneasy relations and
alliances that may acknowledge inclusion while we call for respecting
necessary boundaries. For me, [[Million's highly generative "intense
dreaming" is founded in radical relational imaginings, the politics of
mutual respect and accountability, and transformative justice feminist
praxis]{.underline}]{.mark}. Beyond the rational, Western ways of
knowing, there are relational ways of knowing that draw from sources we
feel, desire, dream, and empathize with rather than from detached
positions we rationalize from. The activist scholarship of Indigenous
feminist and radical women of color feminists free up our imaginations
about what world we really want to live in. Acknowledging that our
minds, hearts, and political imaginations have been captured by the
carceral state and white settler imaginaries, I push back throughout my
activist-scholarship against a purist politics that mistakenly believes
that there is a clearly demarcated and pure "outside" to the current
system. As Million reminds us, "we dance in a politically electrified
field most of our lives."5 Indigenous feminist conceptualizations of
sovereignty and decolonization as well as Black radical feminist
political claims to what Saidiya Hartman would call statelessness,
homelessness, and motherless-ness have, however, furnished new ways for
breaking the stranglehold of carceral state necro-power as well as
provided answers to the questions that have weighed most heavily on my
mind throughout this project: [[To whom do we run for cover from the
carceral state? What do these political formations and autonomous spaces
that do not rely on the nation-state look and feel like? Can we actually
achieve a freedom from interpersonal, sexual, and carceral state
violence? The felt theory and activist-scholarship of Indigenous
feminist and radical women of color feminist
formations,]{.underline}]{.mark} [specifically feminist formations like
INCITE! Women of Color Against Violence, Young Women's Empowerment
Project, Sista II Sista, Project NIA, UBUNTU, the Bay Area
Transformative Justice Collective, Families of Sisters in Spirit (FSIS),
No More Silence (NMS), and the Native Youth Sexual Health Network
(NYSHN), or those found in the Free CeCe Campaign or the Idle No
More/Indigenous Nationhood Movement]{.underline} [[have helped us to
denaturalize white settler colonialism, carceral feminisms, and their
genealogies. Our present reality no longer has to be
assumed]{.underline}. [Driven by a principled sense of mortal urgency,
grassroots, volunteer-led, local and transnational
groups]{.underline}]{.mark} like FSIS, NMS, and NYSHN, for example,
[[embrace a politics of Indigenous resurgence and are interested in
nurturing self-determined and community-led responses to racialized
gendered violence targeting Indigenous girls and women rather than
relying on the]{.underline}]{.mark} Canadian [[nation-state and further
engaging with and appealing to state institutions and government
bodies]{.underline}]{.mark}. In their joint statement, "It Starts With
Us," which lays the groundwork to support the resurgence of
community-based responses to violence, these three Indigenous-led
organizations name specific forms of state violence and identify the
harms of going through "the proper channels" of state-led
interventions---by way of providing testimonies to British Columbia's
Missing Women Commission of Inquiry to making recommendations to the
United Nations Committee for the Elimination of Discrimination against
Women (CEDAW).7 For these organizations, heightened calls for a national
inquiry into the phenomenon of missing and murdered Indigenous women in
the wake of the disappearance and murder of Loretta Saunders, a pregnant
young Inuk graduate student who was writing her thesis on the murders of
three Nova Scotia Indigenous women, is a waste of time. More than a
waste of time, however, an inquiry, as Robyn Bourgeois argues, "allows
the Canadian state to *appear* that it is doing something about violence
against women *without ever having to actually do anything.*"9
Establishing an inquiry or special committee to examine an issue that
has successfully been defined in mainstream media and civic forums as a
social problem has historically been a common strategy by the state to
silence the voices of opposition. After warning other Indigenous women
who are advocating for the inquiry about how the "colonial government
can, and will, define, dictate, and decide the purpose, mandate,
process, and outcome of that inquiry," Andrea Landry deploys an outlaw
discourse that delegitimizes an inquiry "established by a structure
meant to murder, rape, and annihilate the Indigenous self."10 Landry
writes, "If the colonial government were to put the dollars in to 'fix'
an issue that they continuously create and justify, and if we were to
agree to work together, we would be shaking hands with and embodying the
oppressor."11 Landry powerfully equates Indigenous women's falling prey
to the "assimilative lure of the statist politics of recognition"12 in
the form of a national inquiry to that of the visceral pain induced by
internalized oppression and violent victimization at the hands of the
white-settler state. [[While nothing can be gained from engaging in a
liberal politics of recognition, inclusion, and visibility---for
Indigenous women, in particular---everything can be lost. Instead of
engaging with carceral and settler states, these radical Indigenous
feminists are "call\[ing\] attention back to ourselves; we have the
answers and solutions . . . we always have]{.mark}.]{.underline}" The
solutions in which communities are already actively engaged range from
Indigenous resurgence, teach-ins and critical education, media-arts
justice, Inquiry," community accountability and transformative justice,
supporting Indigenous people in the sex trades and street economies,
centering Indigenous youth leadership and intergenerational organizing,
and Annual February 14th Memorial Marches for Missing and Murdered
Women,14 to the "countless acts of hidden resistance and kitchen table
resistance aimed at ensuring their children and grandchildren could live
as *Indigenous* Peoples." [[It is imperative to provide a historical
context and to mine the genealogy of Indigenous, queer woman of color
feminist antiviolence activism in order to denaturalize the present; the
ability to remember something differently tells us that the carceral
state, carceral feminisms, and white settler futurity are not inevitable
and can be dismantled.]{.underline}]{.mark} The powerful analytics and
politics discussed here have refused to reproduce what Sandy Grande
would call the "theory of property holders" perpetuated in "whitestream
feminisms." Additionally, as Audra Simpson reminds us---her people---the
Mohawks of Kahnawake are "nationals of a precontact Indigenous polity
that . . . insist on being and acting as peoples who belong to a nation
other than the United States or Canada" and who intimately understand
that "there is more than one *political* show in town" beyond the much
sought-after and presumed "benevolence" of a multicultural, liberal
politics of recognition.17 [[While the "place we live now" may seem
forlorn, barren, and desolate for Indigenous feminist and radical women
of color feminists, there is a historical context and precedent for
antiracist feminist antiviolence coalition- and movement-building by
those under siege by white settler colonialism and carceral state
violence.]{.underline}]{.mark} While a political formation based in
transformative feminist and prison abolitionist praxes may seem
incommensurable and (often) impractical in activist circles that
privilege short-term legal remedies over long-term political
movement-building, it is not---and never has been---an impossible
politics. It is both possible and preferred. To underscore the
historical continuity of the imaginative visioning and intense dreaming
of Indigenous feminist and radical women of color feminism, I briefly
return here to the importance of intergenerational, historical memory. I
want to return to a brief discussion of a grassroots, feminist
antiviolence movement---active approximately thirty-five years
ago---that went beyond discursive resistance and mere survival to engage
in transformative feminist praxis and speculate about Black female
bodily integrity and Black socialist lesbian feminist sovereignty: [[the
Combahee River Collective. Black women, "Third World" women of color,
and Indigenous activists within the decolonized space of transformative
justice feminist organizing, engage in ceremony and the communicative
sacred activity of dreaming. Those of us currently working to build a
community accountability activist circle driven by criminalized and
formerly incarcerated women intimately know another world is
possible.]{.underline}]{.mark} At one of our organizing meetings, I
would like us to continue to "learn in social action"19 and study
together one of the early transformative justice feminist projects
advanced by the Combahee River Collective, a Boston-based Black
socialist lesbian feminist organization that began as a chapter of the
short-lived National Black Feminist Organization in 1974.20 The Combahee
River Collective's widely circulated, bilingual Spanish English pamphlet
entitled "Black Women: Why Did They Die?" addresses the sexual assault
and murder of twelve Black women and one white woman in the Boston area
in the first months of 1979.21 Preceding a list of transformative
justice-like measures Black, Puerto Rican, and other "Third World" women
could take to protect themselves, participate in radical self-defense
classes, and build community safety programs,22 the pamphlet forwards an
intersectional analysis of the murders that goes "beyond 'Don't walk
home alone at night.'"23 Immediately following the analysis is a poem by
Ntozake Shange entitled "with no immediate cause," which discusses the
state's complicity in racialized gendered violence and Shange's own
feelings of impotence to stem the crushing tide of racist, misogynist
violence.24 Noting the devaluation of Black girls' lives by the carceral
state, the pamphlet authors write: "The mother of a fifteen-year-old
girl, one of the first two victims, says that when she reported the
disappearance of her daughter to the police, they hesitated to file a
report, claiming that the girl had probably gone off with a pimp."25
Their analysis investigated the complicity of the racialized carceral
state and the mainstream media in these young women's murders,
underscoring the difficulties of forging alliances with both white
mainstream feminists and hetero-patriarchal Black male leadership. The
pamphlet challenged the call for Black men to "protect their women" and
called out white feminists' investments in upholding normative white
femininity that racializes Black men as well as Black women.26 The
authors noted that "when eleven white women were raped in another part
of Boston, all describing their assailant as a Black man, the press and
the city officials were quick to recognize their plight and a great deal
of attention was drawn to their situation."27 Through their collective
analysis, the Combahee River Collective underscored how a singular focus
on race or gender unwittingly reproduced the normative narratives of the
carceral state and the normative institutions of middle-class
domesticity, white femininity, and "proper" sexuality. Such a
perspective was therefore inadequate to address the interlocking forms
of violence targeting Black, Latina, and other "Third World" women of
color. The group CRISIS, with a focus on self-help and anti-violence
community mobilization, and the Committee for Women's Safety, a
coalition of Black, Latina, and white antiracist feminists working to
develop programs for community safety, were formed as a result of
Combahee's transformative justice feminist praxis. I would argue that
the majority---if not all---of the feminism of color and trans-feminism
of color antiviolence movements recognize the Combahee River Collective
as one of their direct antecedents. As Robin D. G. Kelley states,
[["Radical black feminists have never confined their vision to just the
emancipation of black women or women in general or all black people for
that matter. Rather they are the theorists and proponents of a radical
humanism committed to liberating humanity and reconstructing social
relations across the board]{.underline}]{.mark}."29 Demonstrating this
radical humanism and one of the most compelling aspects of Combahee's
antiviolence organizing work, I have found especially moving a
photograph that depicts a banner held by a group of Black and Latina
demonstrators at one of the many rallies to protest the murders and lack
of police accountability. The banner reads, "3rd World Women: We Cannot
Live Without Our Lives."30 The banner tells us how Black women and other
women of color's lives have been marked for legal elimination, social
death, and extermination by the carceral state. When the promise of life
is not extended universally by the state or when life is premised merely
on surviving legacies of interpersonal and state violence, it is
rendered meaningless, a "death in life" without ceremony. Every day that
these prison abolitionist and transformative justice collectives meet,
break bread together, and model mutual responsibility and accountability
in order to interrupt interpersonal, sexual, and state violence against
Indigenous and Black girls and women in their families, communities,
schools, and workplaces, they evoke both their ancestors and descendants
and partake in ceremony. Every time these collectives of girls and women
engage in a politics that calls for collective *self*-recognition and a
"turning away" from the carceral state, every time they daydream about
the Americas disappearing into a singular landmass and sacred place
called Turtle Island, these collectives engage in ceremony. The kinds of
futures evoked during these ceremonies are the worlds of which our
abolitionist movements dream.
