# CNDI 2019 \-\-- End-Use Controls CP

## Executive Summary

Hello! Welcome to the world of Golden Sentries and Blue Lanterns!
Whenever we sell arms to a foreign agent, through foreign military or
direct commercial means, we have guidelines for how they are meant to be
used. These rules, and the infrastructure for enforcing them, are
generally called something like end-use monitoring. The issue with end
use now is that a. countries can just be shady, b. the responsibility
for doing end use monitoring is split between different offices in the
federal government depending on whether the sale is direct commercial or
foreign military, c. it's generally under resourced and lacks
consistency in enforcement.

The counterplan basically works by saying that we should strengthen the
U.S.'s regime of end use monitoring instead of restricting the sale of
arms per se. Ideally, this would be in coordination with a strong
disadvantage so that the CP can absorb aff offense while allowing the
disad to outweigh.

It's useful to see title 22 for a fuller description of end use and
legislation behind it:\

### 1NC -- End-Use CP

#### The United States federal government should

#### create a new Single Export Control Agency tasked with oversight and control of US arms sales.

#### ensure the agency has broad enforcement and end-use and end-user monitoring authority. 

#### substantially increase funding for the Blue Lantern and Golden Sentry programs.

#### That'll solve the case -- it streamlines existing programs and ensures broad compliance with end-use restrictions.

Control: A Review of the Obama Administration's Export Control Reform
Initiative and Suggestions for the Future," CITBA Policy Paper, May 13.
2014, <http://citba.org/documents/2013-JessicaEddy.pdf>)

VI\. Legal Solutions to Strengthen Export Control Reform While the Obama
Administration's is implementation of some of the goals of the ECRI,
more actions are required to ensure the total permanency of the export
control reform efforts and the protection of U.S. interests. First, as
part of the export control overhaul, new Congressional legislation is
needed to establish a single export agency, a single export control
list, and more authority to ensure end-use and end-user monitoring.
Second, the United States must seek ways to enhance international arms
trade controls worldwide. Defense Trade Treaties and ratification of the
United Nation Arms Trade Treaty are two avenues to increase export
controls globally in areas that are beyond U.S. jurisdiction. a. New
Congressional Legislation [New legislation is needed]{.underline} to
ensure the Obama Administration's ECRI is carried through into the
future in order to overcome the archaic export control framework now in
place. While the President has the Constitutional mandate as Commander
and Chief that gives him or her authority over issues affecting national
security, this position is not entrusted with authorities specifically
enumerated to Congress.135 Congress is specifically granted the
authority to "regulate commerce with foreign nations."136 Therefore,
because the purpose of export controls is to regulate sensitive
technologies within commerce, Congress has the ultimate authority to
legislate in this area.137 While the current ECRI efforts to overhaul
the USML and CCL are authorized, [[Congress should]{.mark} act to
con[solidate the existing export control framework into a comprehensive
regulatory scheme that ensures efficiency, transparency, and
accountabili]{.mark}ty. In order to accomplish these goals, [new
legislation should encompass a single export agency, a single export
control list, and **more robust end-use and end-user
requirements**]{.mark}.]{.underline} i. **[Single Export Control Agency
(SECA)]{.underline}** The Obama Administration identified the need for a
single export control agency (SECA) to administer and oversee the export
control regime, but has yet to detail what this agency's functions
should be and under what authority it should operate. Under Executive
Order 13558, President Obama created the Export Coordination Enforcement
Center (ECEC) is housed under the Department of Homeland Security.138
The ECEC is an interagency group that takes a whole-of-government
approach to "strengthened and coordinated enforcement of United States
export control laws and enhanced intelligence exchange in support of
such enforcement efforts."139 The group coordinates efforts of the
Departments of State, Treasury, Defense, Justice, Commerce, Energy,
Homeland Security, the Office of the Director of National Intelligence,
other executive branch departments, agencies, or offices as the
President, from time to time, may designate.140 While this Executive
Order takes a step in the right direction of creating a single agency,
it falls short of creating the type of agency with the weight and
authority to oversee all export control issues. The ECEC is a
coordination body only. It specifically does not "provide exclusive or
primary investigative authority to any agency."141 It lacks any true
independence because its function and administration are subject to the
Department of Homeland Security and its budget.142 The ECEC has no
authority to resolve jurisdiction conflicts between agencies, and the
Executive Order is silent both on concurrence of certain agencies when
making export control determination, as well as how conflict resolution
should occur.143 Furthermore, because the ECEC is the creation of
Executive Order, it is subject to the whims of political tides. The
ability of each successive administration to shape the ECEC based on the
current political climate leaves one of the most critical national
security functions open to an unchecked political or public caprice. The
ECEC does not go far enough to resolve the over-complexity that exists
under today's export control regime. A legislatively-created SECA is
required to ensure successful export control overhaul. [A [SECA is
essential to create transparency and consistency]{.mark} in U.S. export
control regulation]{.underline}s. However, an agency that lacks
authority to resolve the issues noted above is insufficient from
overhauling export control. Conversely, a complete divorce from the
current export control authorities would have unintended consequences.
Each of the agencies currently involved in the export control regime
bring a unique perceptive on questions of technology control and a new
SECA must ensure a hostile approach to account for the military,
political, and economic impacts of approving or denying a license
request. [To that end, Congress should enact legislation creating a new
SECA independent of, but informed by, the Department of State, Commerce
and Defense that currently oversee this regime.]{.underline} However,
such legislation must be carefully crafted to ensure no usurpation or
duplication of effort for the critical missions these agencies otherwise
fulfill as part of their mandate. In other words, the new SECA must
thrive and be successful because of the inputs of the existing export
agencies versus trying to re-create or self-inform on military,
political, and economic factors relevant to export control license
approvals. At a basic level, [the [SECA should act as an administrative
coordinating venue but with strong enforcement
oversight]{.mark}]{.underline}[.]{.mark} It should be overseen by a
Secretary responsible for coordinating the positions of each existing
agency and ensuring consensus and concurrence is reached on controlled.
Input from the existing agencies would be mandatory and consultation
required when consensus is not reached. For unresolved issues of high
importance (such as national security, foreign policy, or economic
impact, etc.) the SECA should be responsible for presenting export
control decisions to the President for final determinations. [The [SECA
must be required to report to Congress when proposed exports]{.mark} of
major defense equipment, articles, and services meeting specific dollar
thresholds [are triggered]{.mark} under a license or treaty, regardless
of their military or dual-use status.]{.underline}144 **[[The SECA must
also have enforcement and end-use and end-user monitoring
authority]{.underline}]{.mark}**.145 [[It must have the right to
bring]{.mark} civil and criminal [actions against exporters or
purchasers that knowingly]{.mark} and willingly [violate export control
regulations]{.mark}. Finally, it should be required to report to
Congress on administrative and criminal violations of export
laws]{.underline}. ii. Single Export Control List (SECL) The Obama
Administration's efforts to review and delist technologies on the USML
are a positive step in moving the ECRI forward. However, the USML and
CCL must be collapsed into one list to form a single accumulative list
of export controlled items. Congress should ensure this consolidation
through legislation that requires the single export control list (SECL)
to take primacy and detailing what items are controlled on what level.
The SECL should be a culmination of both military and dual-use
technologies. It should offer varying levels of control to account for
the range of least sensitive to most critical technologies. When
possible, controlled items should specify what technical parameters of a
particular technology are controlled. The SECL must harmonize existing
licensing requirements and policies and ensure the license application
process is clear and transparent to industry. The list should be subject
to annual review to determine appropriate removal of items which have
little or no military or intelligence significance. Such a review must
include a foreign availability assessment to determine whether sensitive
technologies are already available globally and evaluate if U.S.
controls are warranted if a positive determination is found. A SECL
overseen by a SECA eliminates the jurisdictional issues that exist under
the current export control framework. Additionally, a SECL benefits U.S.
manufactures by reducing the compliance costs to both large firms and
SMEs who would have a one-stop-shop when determining if technology is
controlled or not. A SECL administered by a SECA would also ensure
consistency in licensing applications reviews, as well as a consolidated
record of decisions and actions associated with controlled technologies.
This would create the much need transparency, consistency, and
accountability that is lacking in the current export control regime.
iii. **[Enhancing End-Use and End-User Monitoring and
Enforcement]{.underline}** [New [legislation must also ensure the SECA
has strong **oversight** and enforcement authority]{.mark}]{.underline}.
From an administrative standpoint, a SECA allows a streamlined
opportunity to track exported items and technologies. [[The SECA would
be responsible for]{.mark} tracking the life cycle of a technology
export from licensing application through **[end-use and end-user
monitori]{.mark}ng**.]{.underline} This would create records from a
technology transfer to be housed in one place in one system. [[This
consolidation will make end-use and end-user monitoring **easier to
track and enforce**]{.underline}]{.mark}. To that end, Congress must
ensure strong enforcement provisions for the SECA. The new SECA must
have investigative authority to query end users about the whereabouts
and use of controlled technologies. [End-users who fail to comply with
the SECA's follow-up inquires must be subject to various levels of
legislatively-approved sanctions]{.underline}, including but not limited
to warning letters, watch lists, exclusions from end-use of certain
technologies, ineligibility for military sale, and suspension or
cancellation of contracts, and possibly sanctions. The SECA must have
the responsibility for monitoring and reporting to Congress on multiple
export control offenders. It should also make recommendations to
Congress for further legislative sanctions if it is found that an allied
or partner nation are not abiding by the terms of end-use and end-user
restrictions against third-party transfers. The SECA recommendations
should include country monitoring to identifying systemic issues,
removing STA exemption eligibly, or sanctions for repeat end-use and
end-user violations. **[[Congressional action]{.mark} to overhaul the
current export control regime by legislatively creating a SECA, SECL,
and [enhanced end-use]{.mark} and end-monitoring [controls will]{.mark}
ensure export control accomplishes the objectives of [protect]{.mark}ing
[national security and technological
superiority]{.mark}]{.underline}**[.]{.mark}

[Monitoring]{.underline} is the process by which efforts are tracked to
determine whether inputs (e.g., training and money) have [translated
into intermediate objectives]{.underline} (e.g., number of people
trained and equipment obtained). Evaluation is the process by which
policymakers and implementers examine the extent to which security
cooperation activities have achieved their stated objectives. [This
process is critical to providing leaders and decisionmakers with an
understanding of what is working]{.underline} and what is not. Planning,
monitoring, and evaluation are crucial to ensuring that SSA activities
are supportive of U.S. objectives. Accordingly, [the U.S. security
cooperation workforce must be trained to conduct baseline assessments,
establish SMART objectives that articulate desired end
states]{.underline}, define metrics by which to measure a program's
success, evaluate risks and identify mitigation steps, and design
programs with strong feedback loops. An upfront approach to SSA will
help policymakers articulate long-term security cooperation objectives
and measure progress against those objectives throughout the life cycle
of the program. [Monitoring and evaluation (M&E) also plays a vital role
in enhancing oversight of how training and equipment are employed by
partner nations]{.underline}. **[Specifically, end-use monitoring (EUM)
pro- grams aim to reduce the security risks involved in transfers of
U.S. arms and equipment by ensuring that they are not misused and remain
within the security force to which they are assigned]{.underline}**.18
The two primary U.S. government EUM programs are Blue Lantern and Golden
Sentry. DoS's Directorate of the Defense Trade Controls (DDTC)
coordinates the Blue Lantern program, in which U.S. embassy officials
conduct pre-license checks and post-shipment verifications of items
transferred via Direct Commercial Sales (DCS).19 DoD's Defense Security
Cooperation Agency (DSCA) manages the Golden Sentry program, which
performs an analogous function for foreign military sales (FMS)
transfers.20 [Strengths, Weaknesses, and Gaps Strong strategic and
programmatic planning, monitoring, and evaluation enhances the ability
of U.S. policymakers and planners to precisely target SSA]{.underline},
gauge its return on investment, and link it to strategic objectives. In
the short term, M&E can help implementers identify and address
programmatic weaknesses and gaps. Over the long term, M&E enables
organizations to absorb and apply lessons learned and best practices to
future engagements.21 In recent years, interest from senior
policymakers, the requirements of the Presidential Policy Directive 23
on Security Sector Assistance (PPD 23), and pressure from Congress have
pushed agencies to think more strategically about SSA and improve M&E
mechanisms.22 Yet, despite increased policy and legislative attention,
**[DoD and DoS are still in the early stages of their efforts to
implement consistent M&E systems]{.underline}**. As indicated in the
flowchart above, DoD is taking steps to improve its planning process for
SSA, designing a new system to distill partner and U.S. objectives,
requirements, and M&E criteria. Policymakers at DoD have developed a
"concept-first approach" to encourage upfront analysis and strong
program design. [Broadly, however, planning of SSA programs and
activities is still inhibited by U.S. agencies' **failure to
coordinate** with partner countries and with each other.]{.underline}
U.S. agencies responsible for SSA may not coordinate with partner
countries and design projects with both U.S. and partner country
objectives in mind. [This can result in a misalignment of goals,
decreased partner country buy-in, or diminished strategic impact. Lack
of interagency coordina- tion and a dearth of strategic guidance
documents hinder the U.S. government's ability to prioritize funding and
resources, though both DoD and DoS are taking steps to improve these
gaps]{.underline}.23 In addition, many experts in the DoD operational
community worry that a lengthy planning, monitor- ing, and evaluation
process will impede the U.S. ability to respond to short-term
operational requirements critical to U.S. interests (e.g., terrorist
threats). Several factors contribute to inadequate monitoring of U.S.
SSA. First, the U.S. government lacks a central system that tracks all
SSA and is accessible to all the relevant stakeholders. With dozens of
offices in different agencies responsible for developing and
administering SSA programs, it is difficult for planners and
implementers to visualize the full picture of SSA programming for a
country or region.24 Second, the system is only beginning to adapt to
design programs with SMART objectives and strong feedback loops that
facilitate M&E. Without specific goals and clear metrics identified in
the planning stage, effective monitoring and evaluation are nearly
impossible. Third, most agencies' workforces do not receive adequate
training on program design, planning, and M&E. Thus, instead of focusing
on the long-term implications and objectives of SSA programs and
activities, agencies instead fixate on present-day relations and
short-term outcomes.25 **[Well-designed and administered EUM programs
reduce the security risks inherent in transfers of arms and
equipment]{.underline}**. [However, the U.S. government occasionally
struggles to implement EUM programs, for several reasons.]{.underline}
First, while there is abundant policy guidance for the implementa- tion
of DoD's Golden Sentry program, **[there is a dearth of guidance for
DoS's Blue Lantern program.]{.underline}** For instance, Blue Lantern
policy does not specify the criteria U.S. embassy employees should use
to determine whether to make site visits to partner nation military
facilities to validate Blue Lantern compliance.26 Instead, all site
visits are deemed optional and are thus unevenly conducted. [Second,
government audits have demonstrated that agencies struggle to maintain
record-keeping systems on EUM implementation]{.underline}. [Third, due
to staffing transitions and **limited staffing**, U.S. embassies
sometimes lack the personnel to carry out routine EUM in a timely
manner]{.underline}.27 Finally, "pseudo" FMS programs (those that do not
require partner nation signature on requisite program paperwork), such
as the Iraq Train and Equip Fund (ITEF), are not subjected to Golden
Sentry monitoring and thus rely on other (and at times inconsistent)
embassy and intelligence reporting sources to ensure appropriate use.28

#### Stricter end-user control solves violence but maintains leverage for an effective arms agreements.

**Spindel '19** (Jennifer, 5-14-2019, \"The Case for Suspending American
Arms Sales to Saudi Arabia,\" War on the Rocks,
https://warontherocks.com/2019/05/the-case-for-suspending-american-arms-sales-to-saudi-arabia/)

**[The United States could]{.underline}**, in theory, **[impose stricter
end-user controls on Saudi Arabia]{.underline}**. [This would have the
advantage of keeping Saudi Arabia within the world of U.S. weapons
systems, and might prevent it from diversifying its suppliers, which
would ultimately weaken any leverage the United States might have.
Longer-term, it would not be to America's advantage if Saudi Arabia
takes a lesson from Turkey, and starts courting Russia as a new arms
supplier]{.underline}. It is difficult to enforce end-user controls,
since, once a weapon is transferred, the recipient can use it however it
wishes. It might also be the case that Saudi Arabia would object to
stricter end-user controls, and would seek new suppliers as a result.
[An arms embargo will not be a panacea]{.underline}. But not doing
something sets a problematic precedent, and allows the difficulty of
coordinating an arms embargo outweigh the potential benefits of one. [An
embargo is unlikely to have an immediate effect on Saudi
behavior]{.underline}, because an embargo would be a political signal,
rather than a blunt instrument of coercion. [It will take time for a
multilateral embargo to emerge and be put into place, and the United
States should work with its allies to help support their ability to
participate in the embargo]{.underline}. Not acting, however, would
continue to implicitly endorse Saudi behavior, and would make it more
difficult for U.S. allies to believe that future threats of an embargo
are credible.

### 2NC Solvency -- Diversion

#### Strong EUM systems check unauthorized use.

[**Strengthening**]{.underline} national and international [**end-use
monitoring (EUM) must be a top priority** for arms exporting states. EUM
is designed to ensure the proper use of exported weapons and encompasses
all laws, policies, regulations, and procedures used to
verify]{.underline} that a foreign government or [the authorized foreign
recipient]{.underline} of defense articles [is using and controlling
them in accordance with the terms and conditions of a
transfer]{.underline}. Many countries have non-existent or weak end-use
monitoring provisions**[. End-use monitoring must be conducted on a more
systematic and complete basis]{.underline}** -- [at both pre-shipment
and post-shipment points. Moreover, a common end-user certificate that
is not easily forgeable must be developed in order to ensure that trades
are legitimate and that weapons end up in the hands of the intended
user]{.underline}.

#### EUM solves diversion and misuse of weapons. 

**Vranckx '16** (An, Associate Research Fellow at UNU-CRIS and published
a variety of articles on arms sales, "CONTAINING DIVERSION: Arms end-use
and post-delivery controls," GRIP REPORTS 2016/4
http://www.smallarmssurvey.org/fileadmin/docs/L-External-publications/2016/GRIP-2016-Containing-diversion.pdf)

Under review has been a long list of initiatives, measures and
instruments to (better) authenticate end-user documentation for arms
exports. Their potential was discussed to strengthen the lines of
defence against those keen on circumventing restrictions and undermining
arms transfer controls. [Increasingly more research and reports on such
practices make arms control practitioners aware of diversion
risks]{.underline} and inspire reflection on what they can do to contain
such risks. All stakeholders are also encouraged to share information
and cooperate to detect and avoid diversion of authorised arms export
transfers. The evolution is clear and positive, and progress undeniable.
While relatively good news for business, the observed overall decrease
of the denial to-approval ratio in export licensing by EU member states
is not by definition a sign of progress in all respects. If a cue can be
taken from the US Department of State's Blue Lantern, the post-shipment
and end-use monitoring programmes that EU countries authorities are
putting in place will bring down their export licensing
denial-toapproval ratio further. [No true progress is made if export
control authorities drop their guard before they can monitor end-use
sufficiently well beyond the delivery phase.]{.underline} A position
articulated on this matter nearly a decade ago is well worth recalling:
"\[W\]here specific concerns exist, **[delivery verification and end-use
monitoring can be an invaluable tool in subsequent licensing decisions,
thus helping to prevent future diversion and misuse]{.underline}**. Note
that such checks should not be an excuse for undertaking less stringent
pre-licensing checks; they should be used as an additional safeguard.
[The two systems should complement each other, setting up a 'virtuous
loop', with post-delivery verifications feeding into subsequent
pre-licensing risk assessments]{.underline}". 77

#### Improved End-Use Monitoring solves. 

**Stohl '2** (Rachel, Senior Analyst, Center for Defense Information,
"Arming the Weak: U.S. Post-Sept. 11 Arms Trade Policy," September 2002,
http://mstohl.faculty.comm.ucsb.edu/failed_states/2002/papers/RStohl.pdf)

**[Improve End-Use Monitoring.]{.underline}** [If the United States
continues to]{.underline} build connections to states of concern and
increases [weapons exports to these countries, then the United States
must **at least improve end-use monitoring**]{.underline}. When the
United States began air-strikes in Afghanistan in October 2001, U.S.
planes were threatened by Stinger missiles that had been provided to the
mujahidin by the United States in the 1980s. Since at least the
mid-1990s, the use of legally exported U.S. weaponry to bomb and burn
Kurdish villages in southeastern Turkey has been documented. Turkish
forces have also used U.S.-supplied light weaponry in specific human
rights violations, ranging from torture to indiscriminate firing on
civilians. [The current U.S. end-use monitoring (EUM) system prevents
the United States from predicting where U.S. weapons will end up or how
they will eventually be used.]{.underline} [While the United States has
some of the most comprehensive export control and end-use provisions
codified in law, **current efforts to monitor U.S. arms exports are
insufficient**.]{.underline} [Today, EUM is centered on an initial
license application review]{.underline}, which ensures that U.S. weapons
are exported to certified end-users, [but does not place a similar
emphasis on what happens to those exports once they are
shipped]{.underline}. That means that countries with worrisome human
rights records, evidence of poor weapons security management, and those
that have active terrorist groups operating within their borders, still
receive U.S. weaponry.

### 2NC Solvency -- Resources

#### Reform is key -- strengthening end-use regimes with consistent funding and coordination solves abuses. 

**Thomas '17** (Clayton, Analyst in Middle Eastern Affairs for the
Congressional Research Service, "Arms Sales in the Middle East: Trends
and Analytical Perspectives for U.S. Policy, Report #44984, October 11,
2017, <https://fas.org/sgp/crs/mideast/R44984.pdf>)

End-Use Monitoring (EUM) Congress has long taken an interest in ensuring
that arms sold to foreign countries are used responsibly and for the
purposes agreed upon as part of their sale (a legal requirement for
certification that goes back to the 1960s). In 1996, Congress amended
the AECA to include Section 40A (P.L. 104-164), which directs the
President to "establish a program that provides for end-use monitoring
in order to improve accountability with respect to defense articles
sold, leased, or exported under the AECA or FAA." 139 [The goals of
end-use monitoring include preserving U.S. technological superiority by
impeding adversaries' access to sensitive items and ensuring that arms
are used solely by the intended recipients based on the terms under
which the sale is made]{.underline}. In addition, as part of the
standard terms and conditions of a letter of agreement (LOA), the
recipient country agrees to "permit observation and review by \...
representatives of the U.S. Government with regards to the use of such
articles." 140 End-use monitoring has been an important consideration in
evaluating arms sales to Iraq, as Members of Congress try to balance the
Iraqi government's need for weapons to use against the Islamic State and
other threats with the potential for those arms to fall into the wrong
hands, including the very groups their use is intended to combat. Since
2015, there have been widespread reports of the use of U.S. weaponry by
Popular Mobilization Forces or Units (PMFs or PMUs), some of whom are
supported by Iran. U.S. officials have reportedly denied the existence
of any confirmed instances of Iraqi forces transferring U.S. arms to
PMFs, and their Iraqi counterparts have stated that all U.S.-provided
weapons remain under Iraqi army control.141 However, the challenges of
tracking the whereabouts of U.S. arms are considerable in a country that
has received tens of billions of dollars of weapons in the past decade
alone. 142 The challenges of accounting for the whereabouts of U.S. arms
have perhaps grown as the United States has transferred more weapons
into Iraq to help Iraqi forces confront the Islamic State. In May 2017,
Amnesty International obtained (via a Freedom of Information Act
request) and released a September 2016 DOD audit that determined that
the Army "did not have effective controls" to track equipment transfers
provided to Iraqi forces through the Iraq Train and Equip Fund (ITEF).
The audit characterized the Army's recordkeeping as inconsistent, out of
date, and prone to human error.143 A DOD spokeswoman stated, "The bottom
line is that the US military does not have a means to track equipment
that has been taken from the Government of Iraq by ISIL." 144 The
implications for these sales under the AECA are unclear. The DOD
spokeswoman cited above explained the situation by saying that "the
current conflict in Iraq limits some aspects of \... monitoring
activities, including travel to many areas of Iraq and access to Iraqi
units in combat areas, as well as combat use, damage and losses of war
material." 145 [End-use monitoring is considered an important part of
ensuring that recipient governments in the Middle East adhere to **human
rights standards**]{.underline}. [In April 2016, the Government
Accountability Office (GAO) published a report that recommended
"**strengthening" end-use monitoring** of military
equipment]{.underline} sold to Egypt, citing the Egyptian government's
failure to admit U.S. officials to storage sites and other issues.146
Similar GAO reports have been published on aid to Lebanon (February
2014)147 and GCC countries (November 2011).148 [Common recommendations
across these reports include  **greater coordination** between the
Departments of State and Defense]{.underline} (which operate two
different EUM programs),  [more comprehensive vetting of recipients of
security assistance, and  the development of guidance]{.underline} (by
both departments) [establishing procedures for documenting end-use
monitoring efforts and violations thereof.]{.underline} Members of
Congress may consider whether existing EUM frameworks are sufficient,
and **[whether additional authorities, appropriations, or other
legislative directives might support, streamline, or otherwise
strengthen these efforts]{.underline}**.

#### And increasing guidance and resources are sufficient to solve. 

**United States General Accounting Office 2000** (August 2000, "Foreign
Military Sales: Changes Needed To Correct Weaknesses in End-Use
Monitoring Programs" <https://www.gao.gov/assets/230/229480.pdf>)

The Security Assistance Management Manual requires that field personnel
observe and report, during the course of their other duties, on foreign
governments' use of U.S. defense articles and services transferred
through the FMS program. The manual does not prescribe standard end-use
monitoring procedures because the extent of observation will vary
considerably from country to country. As a result, the level of
observation of U.S.-supplied defense equipment varies greatly. Because
DSCA has not issued specific guidance on when to perform the function,
field personnel interpret the requirement to observe and report
differently and have different interpretations of the activities they
should perform. Field personnel in 40 of the 68 countries we surveyed
told us that they did not carry out day-to-day observation and reporting
on host country use of U.S. defense articles and services, while field
personnel in 28 countries said they did. For example, field personnel in
one country we visited, where nine military personnel are assigned to
security assistance, told us that they had many opportunities to visit
foreign military facilities where U.S.-supplied weapons were stored and
to observe the use of such equipment. However, field personnel in
another country, where only four military personnel are assigned to
security assistance, told us that they spend most of their time in their
office or meeting foreign military officials, only occasionally visiting
military facilities, so they do not observe the use of U.S.-supplied
weapons. Both countries purchased substantial amounts of U.S. defense
articles and services through the FMS program. In 1991, we reported that
U.S. military officials in seven countries we visited interpreted the
requirement to observe and report on host country utilization of U.S.
defense articles and services differently and told us that they did not
have structured programs to perform this function.10 At the time, **[we
recommended that DSCA develop accountability standards for the types and
amount of control that a recipient country should apply to U.S. defense
items. We also recommended that DSCA revise the Security Assistance
Management Manual to specify the monitoring required to provide
reasonable assurance that recipient countries are meeting conditions
pertaining to use]{.underline}**, security, and transfer **[of U.S.
defense articles and services. As a result of our recommendations, DSCA
sent a message to field security assistance offices in October 1991
reiterating monitoring guidance in the Security Assistance Management
Manual. However, it did not develop accountability standards or specify
the extent of monitoring needed]{.underline}**. According to several of
them, field personnel are limited in carrying out day-to-day
observations because DSCA has not issued specific guidance on when to
perform this function or provided sufficient resources to perform the
function on a regular basis. Field personnel contrasted the lack of
guidance for end-use monitoring under the FMS program with the specific
guidance they are provided on how to monitor equipment granted to
foreign countries under the Military Assistance Program,11 which
requires field personnel to track equipment transferred under the
program through detailed inventories. Unified Command officials told us
that they do not hold field personnel accountable for not performing the
observation function for equipment transferred though the FMS program
because of the lack of guidance from DSCA. The officials also told us
that they want field personnel to spend their time on their primary
duty, which is to work with foreign governments on planning the
acquisition of defense equipment.

### 2NC Solvency -- Small Arms

#### End Use Monitoring key to illicit small arms transfers.

**Schroeder 2016** \[Matt. "Dribs and Drabs: The Mechanics of Small Arms
Trafficking from the United States." Small Arms Survey, 2016. Matt
Schroeder is a senior researcher at Small Arms Survey
http://www.smallarmssurvey.org/fileadmin/docs/G-Issue-briefs/SAS-IB17-Mechanics-of-trafficking.pdf\]\
\
For policy-makers, these cases offer several important insights. The
first is that **[strong arms export licensing and end-use monitoring
systems are necessary]{.underline}** but not sufficient. There is no
indication that any of the traffickers profiled in the 159 cases applied
for arms export licences or attempted to manipulate the licensing
system. In interviews, US officials confirmed that few, if any, US-based
small arms traffickers apply for export licences.41 Some exporters do
attempt to modify arms export documentation illicitly, usually to
increase the quantity of items authorized for export. But most of these
exports are to legitimate end users.42 Nevertheless, **[recent examples
of attempted and successful diversions of authorized (licensed) exports
underscore the continued need for robust arms export
controls.]{.underline}** A US State Department document obtained by the
Small Arms Survey describes several recent diversion schemes that were
detected and, in some cases, thwarted by export licensing officials and
end-use monitoring programmes**[. In one case, licensing officials
denied a request to export firearms to a private reseller in South Asia
after a check by embassy staff revealed substandard stockpile security,
inadequate sales records, and the 'apparent manufacture of unlicensed
replicas'.]{.underline}**43 In another case, a postshipment check of
'military-grade' rifles that had been exported from the United States to
the armed forces of a former Soviet Republic revealed that the rifles
had been illegally re-exported to private end users in Central
America.44 **[Data on traces of US-sourced firearms recovered in Canada
and several Latin American countries provides additional evidence of the
continued need for robust controls on authorized exports.]{.underline}**
In 2014 alone, the US Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and
Explosives (ATF) traced 2,162 firearms to 'foreign countries', meaning
that the last known authorized recipients were foreign military, law
enforcement, or private entities (see Table 5). The data does not
indicate when, where, or how the firearms entered the black market. In
contrast to the cases of trafficking highlighted above, however, the
majority of these 2,162 weapons were probably authorized exports,
meaning that they were licensed or otherwise approved for export by the
US government. These and other recent examples of diversion of legally
exported small arms45 confirm the continued need for robust export
licensing systems and post-shipment end-use monitoring programmes.
Further complicating this already daunting policy challenge is the need
to prevent trafficking not only in small arms and their ammunition, but
also in their parts and accessories. As demonstrated above, there is a
massive global black market in these items that extends to nearly every
region of the world. Illicit firearms parts and accessories that
circulate in this market are often assembled into fully functional
weapons, many of which are acquired by drug traffickers and other
criminals. These cases underscore the importance of controlling
international transfers of parts and accessories for small arms, and
controlling transfers of some of these items (such as receivers) as
rigorously as the weapons themselves. Yet controls on parts and
accessories are often significantly less extensive or robust than
controls on weapons and ammunition. At the international level, this
disparity is evident in the Arms Trade Treaty and, to a lesser extent,
in the UN Firearms Protocol.

### 2NC Solvency -- Congressional War Powers

#### Evaluate war powers not through the resolution but through the ability of Congress to actually exercise their authority. Creating a single export authority solves the knowledge gap that prevents Congress from intervening in arms sales now.

**Abramson 2019** (Jeff, "Proposed Small Arms Transfers: Big
Implications for U.S. Foreign Policy" via armscontrol.org March 26 2019
<https://www.armscontrol.org/print/10389> Jeff Abramson is a
non-resident senior fellow for arms control and conventional arms
transfers at the Arms Control Association. He also manages the Landmine
and Cluster Munition Monitor, the de facto monitoring regime for the
Mine Ban Treaty and Convention on Cluster Munitions, and organizes
the [Forum on the Arms Trade](http://www.forumarmstrade.org/).

He served as a policy advisor and director to the secretariat of Control
Arms, the global civil society alliance that championed the adoption of
the Arms Trade Treaty that for the first time established global
regulations for the trade in a wide array of conventional weapons. He is
also the former deputy director of the Arms Control Association and
former managing editor of their publication Arms Control Today.)

**[Under the current system, the State Department regulates the export
of military equipment and the Commerce Department controls so-called
dual use items]{.underline}**. **[The State Department employs more
vigorous oversight powers than the Commerce Department]{.underline}**,
including a registration regime that provides insight into the
manufacturing of weapons. **[The Export Control Reform Initiative, begun
under the Obama administration, upended this arrangement, transferring
licensing authority for a significant percentage of military equipment
to the Commerce Department]{.underline}**. The rationale for the shift
was that the State Department should focus on weapons that provide the
United States with a critical military or intelligence advantage or are
inherently for military end use. Most Commerce-licensed items, however,
are not subject to Congressional notification requirements or the
prohibition on further transfers to governments that misuse U.S.
weapons. Such misuse appears to have recently occurred with Saudi Arabia
and the United Arab Emirates, who reportedly transferred U.S. weapons to
al Qaeda -linked militias in
Yemen.[2](https://www.armscontrol.org/print/10389#_edn2) During the
previous administration, however, the first three categories of the U.S.
Munitions List, addressing firearms and their ammunition, were not
changed, perhaps because those leaders correctly understood the unique
dangers these weapons posed and that the logic behind the reform
initiative did not apply well to them. Last year, the government\'s
approach changed. **[The Trump administration proposed new rules that
would move semi-automatic and certain nonautomatic weapons and their
ammunition, as well as some other weapons to Commerce Department
control]{.underline}**. This generated thousands of public comments, the
majority of which were
negative.[3](https://www.armscontrol.org/print/10389#_edn3) Early last
month, the administration presented revised versions of those rules that
that mostly ignored expressed concerns and started a 30-day
Congressional review before the rules could be officially published. In
late February, Senator Robert Menendez sent a letter to Secretary of
State Mike Pompeo placing a hold on the proposed rules change, giving
Congress time to act. We commend Representative Norma Torres, and
co-sponsor Chairman Eliot Engel for introducing H.R. 1134, the \"Prevent
Crime and Terrorism Act,\" which would keep the control lists from
changing. In the Senate, Menendez, Ranking Member of the Senate Foreign
Relations Committee, introduced S.459, the \"Stopping the Traffic in
Overseas Proliferation of Ghost Guns Act,\" which also prohibits the
changes. These legislative efforts have the backing of a wide range of
civil society organizations, including Amnesty International USA, Brady,
Giffords, Global Exchange, the Violence Policy Center, and the Arms
Control Association.

Dangers of the new approach

**[The proposed regulatory changes are problematic for several
reasons]{.underline}**. First, the types of weapons the administration
wants to remove from State Department review and Congressional
notification actually merit the tightest export control because of their
real and potential role in fueling violence, including violence against
U.S. military and law enforcement personnel. Research indicates that the
types of weapons being transferred to Commerce control---AR- and AK-type
rifles and their ammunition---are "weapons of choice" of drug
trafficking organizations in Mexico and other Central American
countries.[4](https://www.armscontrol.org/print/10389#_edn4) Many can
also be easily converted to fully automatic
weapons.[5](https://www.armscontrol.org/print/10389#_edn5) Many sniper
rifles that would be moved to Commerce control are currently in U.S.
military use, again undermining the core distinction between these
weapons. Second, the fact that these weapons may be widely available in
the United States does not mean they should be widely exported. In many
of the countries where these weapons are likely to be marketed, they are
considered military weapons and are tightly
controlled.[6](https://www.armscontrol.org/print/10389#_edn6) As Kristen
Rand of the Violence Policy Center argued in a press briefing earlier
this month, \"...the fact is that many of these guns and other weapons
are identical or virtually identical to military firearms. The fact is
that anyone can build their own army with guns you can buy retail in the
United States.\"[7](https://www.armscontrol.org/print/10389#_edn7)
Third**[, by shifting licensing authority to the Commerce Department,
these weapons will be removed from the statutory regime devised by
Congress for these weapons.]{.underline}** This has significant
implications because there are a number of counterterrorism,
humanitarian, and human rights provisions of the Foreign Assistance Act
and the Arms Export Control Act that are all tied to the State
Department's control list. It would also undermine statutory
prohibitions on transfers to specific countries, such as the Tiananmen
Square sanctions.[8](https://www.armscontrol.org/print/10389#_edn8) To
begin with, **[Congress will not be notified of the sale of these
weapons]{.underline}**. In 2002, Congress amended notifications
requirements so it would be informed of sales authorized by the State
Department for firearms valued at \$1 million or more. No such
notification requirements exist if these weapons are transferred to
Commerce control. **[In recent years, Congressional involvement has
helped forestall firearms transfers to repressive forces in Turkey and
the Philippines, but it is difficult to imagine how Congress could do
that moving forward if never provided the information that such sales
were under consideration. When items controlled by the State Department
are misused or re-transferred without permission, the State Department
is required by Section 3 of the Arms Export Control Act to notify the
Congress. That Act conditions the sale of weapons on compliance with
end-use agreements]{.underline}**. Any use of the weapons for anything
other than legitimate defense purposes is not permitted. Section 3
requires the suspension of further sales and deliveries to any recipient
that violates the end-use agreements. The Commerce Department typically
does not require such end-use agreements, without which there are
significant legal hurdles to suspending deliveries once sales are
approved if the recipients prove to be untrustworthy. If licensing
authority shifts to the Commerce Department, then these statutory
requirements will no longer apply. Therefore, if foreign security
personnel misuse U.S. weapons or transfer weapons to organized crime
networks, the Congress would not be notified and there would be no
statutory requirement to suspend further sales or deliveries to the same
security forces. Unfortunately, this is all too common. For example, in
Guatemala, the government used U.S. military vehicles to surround the
U.S. Embassy when it was displeased with the United States stance on
anti-corruption
investigations.[9](https://www.armscontrol.org/print/10389#_edn9) The
proposed shift of jurisdiction to Commerce would also undermine key
components of the Foreign Assistance Act. The Secretary of State is
required by that Act to suspend the sale of weapons to countries that
consistently violate human rights. No such requirement would exist for
the Commerce Department under the proposed rule. While the Commerce
Department has stated that it would consult with State Department, there
is no statutory requirement that the Secretary of State consent to any
transfers. Under the current system, if the State Department fails to
implement these human rights provisions, there is a procedure for
expedited Congressional review. So, the proposed rule would undermine
both this Committee's jurisdiction over a major component of U.S.
foreign policy and the authority of the Secretary of State.

### 2NC Solvency -- AT: Solvency Deficits

#### Their evidence is descriptive of the status-quo. Monitoring programs like Blue Lantern can be effective, but lack funding, oversight, and enforcement -- the CP would reverse that. 

**Eddy '14** (Jessica, J.D. from George Mason, "Re-focusing Export
Control: A Review of the Obama Administration's Export Control Reform
Initiative and Suggestions for the Future," CITBA Policy Paper, May 13.

**[End-Use and End-User Monitoring Requirements Are
Insufficient]{.underline}** Both ITAR and EARs attempt to curtail the
transfer of sensitive technologies through end-use monitoring
requirements. Technologies transferred under ITAR may not be used for
unauthorized purposes and the receiving party must agree not to
re-transfer title or possession of such defense articles or services.81
[The ITAR end-use and end-user requirements for exported items
controlled under the USML are monitored under the **Blue Lantern
Program**]{.underline}, [which reviews the end-use of defense articles,
defense services, and brokering activities exported through commercial
channels.]{.underline} 82 While [the Blue Lantern program does make
strides to monitor the end-use of those technologies most vulnerable to
exploitation, **it is a resource constrained program**]{.underline}.83
In 2012, the Blue Lantern Program [on a budget of \$2.1
million]{.underline} was only able to initiate 820 checks on end-use and
was only able to close 706 cases out of the 86,000 license applications
received for the same year.84 This means that [less than 1% of the most
sensitive technologies exported from the United States were
verified]{.underline} to be compliant with end-use and end-user
requirements.85 The EARs is similarly littered with prohibitions on
end-use and end-users and restrictions on re-transfer to third
parties.86 [Despite]{.underline} these [restrictions, enforcement of
end-use monitoring is often non-existent. For example, Congressional
hearings after the Gulf War revealed that of the 771 export licenses
granted for Iraq, only one was ever checked for its end-use to ensure it
was being utilized for civilian purposes]{.underline}.87 A former
Chairman of the House Oversight Committee complained the "Commerce
Department issues licenses for commodities not knowing if the goods are
what they purport to be; ever reach their intended destination; or are
used for the stated legitimate purpose."88 He [further]{.underline}
noted [certificates not to re-export are "little more than paper salve
to the conscience of the government and U.S. corporations" and do little
to prevent the retransfer to sensitive technologies]{.underline}.89 The
lack of monitoring under the ITAR and EARs undermines the objectives of
each regulation. Exported sensitive technologies are easily being
converted into destructive devices that threat U.S. nation security
interests.90 Partner and allied nations that do not enforce U.S. end-use
monitoring requirements are oftentimes found to be the suppliers of
otherwise controlled U.S. technologies.91 [Without a **strong mechanism
to ensure end-use and end-user monitoring**, the United States effort to
prevent the transfer of sensitive technologies to global bad actors is
compromised]{.underline}.

#### Allied nations will follow U.S. end use controls.

Control: A Review of the Obama Administration's Export Control Reform

b\. [**Strengthening International Arms Trade Controls Globally** U.S.
attempts to control sensitive technologies through export control is no
longer a unilateral effort]{.underline}. U.S. executive or legislative
action alone will not ensure effective export controls of sensitive
technologies because such actions have limited influence outside of U.S.
jurisdiction. [Once the U.S. approves the export of a sensitive
technology, the end-use and end user is potentially beyond the U.S.
export controls regimes reach. Global allies and partners developing or
receiving sensitive technologies must be part of the solution for
controlling such technologies diversion]{.underline}. [The United States
must encourage and facilitate other nations to enact similar export
control legislation on a domestic level. If other nations enact similar
domestic legislation, the U.S. benefits from those protections when
exporting sensitive technologies. U**.S. end-use and end-user
requirements will also more likely be respected by nations engaged with
the United States** to prevent the illicit transfer and derivation of
sensitive technology]{.underline}. A global approach becomes
particularly apparent as regional stability becomes more vulnerable to
the nefarious use of dual-use technologies.146 Guns, missiles, and
nuclear bombs are rapidly being replaced with just as destructive
computer viruses and electronic equipment. [While political influence
should be utilized to help ensure global controls, two efforts can be
taken by the United States to help established stronger export controls
for sensitive technologies from an international law
context.]{.underline} **[Two such legal mechanisms include country
exemptions through use of Defense Trade Treaties and ratification of the
UN Arms Trade Treaty]{.underline}**.

#### Allied and business relationships reduce transfer risk -- prove they'll follow monitoring

**CSIS Panel '18** (Featuring: Jeff Abramson, Senior Fellow, Arms
Control Association Dak Hardwick, Assistant Vice President,
International Affairs, Aerospace Industries Association Moderator:
Andrew Philip Hunter, Director, Defense-Industrial Initiatives Group and
Senior Fellow, International Security, "U.S. Arms Transfer Policy:
Shaping the Way Ahead," August 8, 2018,
https://www.csis.org/analysis/us-arms-transfer-policy-shaping-way-ahead)

MR. HUNTER: OK. So risk -- how does risk fit into the policy?

MS. CRESSEY: So [risk is something that we have to -- I think we have to
factor into every decision that we make.]{.underline} All of my
colleagues are very aware of risk, whether you are looking at the
release of a technology, the sale of a system, the situation within that
country, the situation within that region. [So I would say that the
assessment of risk is baked into the entire process from the beginning
to the end, including end-use monitoring, whether it's a direct
commercial sale or a foreign military sale.]{.underline}

We also have very strict retransfer provisions that are within the --
whether it's -- again, whether it's a direct commercial sale and built
into the license or whether it's a foreign military sale and built into
the contract or the letter of offer and acceptance. So in order to
retransfer an item, they have to come back to my office, if it's a
foreign military sale, to get that kind of -- that kind of approval. And
if that doesn't happen, then we have -- you know, we have other
provisions to deal with countries that transfer in contravention of
their agreements.

So I would say that we are very much aware of risk. Jeff has pointed out
the kinds of things that we are dealing in. We are not talking about
paper, we're not talking about transferring -- we're talking about
transferring lethal equipment, so risk is something that is baked in, I
think, every step of the way.

MR. HUNTER: Jeff?

MR. ABRAMSON: It's easy to forget that -- I mean, the U.S. is by far the
world's largest arms dealer and growing its share. If you look at the
SIPRI reports, the U.S. is not suffering; it's growing, and it has great
influence, and for decades has argued for responsible arms trade. And I
think as we assess the policy, if this is setting the standard for the
next 50 years, is it the standard that we want other countries to
follow. I think that if it is, we need to make that portion of the case,
[and if we are concerned that some countries are not acting as
responsibly as they should, how do we convince them to act more
responsibly. And that's where I think we stress these end-use monitoring
agreements, we stress pieces of our continuing process that we want
other countries to follow]{.underline}, and it's an unfair criticism to
say this, but I don't think this administration or this president is
particularly proud or fond of multilateralism, but ultimately that is I
think the approach that you have to take here. There is an arms trade
treaty that is signed in a hundred countries -- almost all of our allies
included are part of it -- and how do we figure out ways to build the
multilateral system at the same time because if the problem is other
countries acting poorly, and we're presenting a model, is that model one
that they are going to want to replicate.

If we figure out how to do it faster and better, how do we show we're
doing it, taking account of all these risks?

MR. HARDWICK: So, Andrew, if I can just very quickly -- I want to say
something differently about risk than what I think other panelists have
said. So risk can be -- so risk can be mitigated by processes. That part
is true; I think that's what you have heard. But [risk is also mitigated
by relationships.]{.underline} And I want to emphasize that because [the
government-to-government relationship that occurs between the United
States and other countries is so critical to ensuring]{.underline} that
whatever [risk]{.underline} we think there is [in transferring an item
is mitigated]{.underline} is really important.

But the other relationship that has developed that we don't talk about
very often is [the relationship between the industry partner and the
country in question]{.underline} because those relationships [are baked
in for years]{.underline} because what happens is as soon as you start
working with a country, you also start working with their supply chain,
with their in-country partners, and [those relationships are developed,
and continue, and endure even beyond the government-to-government
relationships.]{.underline}

So we don't necessarily talk about those relationships very often, and
so what you will see is that [risk reduction occur both on the
government-to-government level as well as the industry-to-country
level]{.underline}. That is so important in making sure that you are
making the right decisions when it comes to sales in countries around
the world.

DoD should continue to institutionalize its new planning process. In
parallel, DoS should be developing its own system for holistic planning,
monitoring, and evaluation as part of its ongoing reorganization and
reform effort. Training and education across the DoD and DoS workforce
for SSA planning, monitoring, and evaluation should be prioritized and
resourced. **[Agencies responsible for developing and administering SSA
programs should more actively and closely collaborate with partner
countries on program design. This will help ensure an alignment of
objectives and encourage partner buy-in. Additionally, there should be
an increased emphasis on interagency coordination.]{.underline}**
Specifically, a DoS \'conductor\' for security sector planning and
cooperation should be identified and empowered to bring together
interagency actors to develop a common plan for partner countries.**[\'
To help facilitate this, Congress should conduct a review of Title 22

programs. Enhancing interagency coordination and empowering a DoS
conductor will go a long way toward ensuring that SSA is linked to
strategic objectives. To facilitate strong program design and M8E,
agencies must invest in recruiting and training a workforce fluent in
theories of change and capable of designing and implementing M&E
regimes? USAID\'s M&E best practices can serve as a useful guide and
training resource for other U.S. agencies conducting SSA. To improve DoS

checks, Dos should ensure that its workforce is resourced to
consistently conduct checks and should foster greater host government
cooperation by utilizing available Blue Lantern outreach programs.
Second, to improve partner oversight and accountability, Blue Lantern
implementation guidance should articulate the conditions under which
site visits are required to complete a pre-license screening.-\" Third,
to improve tracking of FMS weapons, the DoD should assess and address
gaps in its documentation and record-keeping procedures and subject ITEF
programs to EUM.

Another reason the United States tends to be restrained in arms sales is
the accompanying "red tape," much of which the Trump initiative will
seek to remove. U.S. regulations surpass those suggested in the
[toothless U.N. Conventional Arms Trade
Treaty](https://www.bloombergquint.com/opinion/2017/10/14/targeting-international-trade-in-conventional-weapons),
which four of the most important market-makers --- [Russia, China,
India, and Saudi
Arabia](http://foreignpolicy.com/2013/04/02/u-n-passes-landmark-arms-trade-treaty-some-major-powers-abstain/)
--- have not bothered to even sign. **[The United States makes onerous
demands --- including on-site inspections on sovereign territory --- of
importing states to ensure weapons do not get transferred to third
parties, and require that these weapons only be employed for their
intended use]{.underline}** (i.e. self-defense). While not always
consistently enforced, **[these requirements remain a powerful latent
foreign policy tool.]{.underline}** Contrary to what industry lobbyists
might say, this is not a source competitive disadvantage. It is a sign
of American market power and a source of American influence. [A Russian
observer, writing in a U.N.
report,](http://www.unidir.org/files/medias/pdfs/background-paper-transfer-of-defense-technologies-should-they-be-included-in-the-att-vadim-kozyulin-eng-0-260.pdf)
notes rather drily that the U.S. export control system is both much more
effective than any other country's and "frequently used for influencing
the end-user's foreign policy." The United States has used these rules
to limit and shape proliferation, from banning [the sale of Israeli
airborne early warning systems to
China](https://www.armscontrol.org/act/2000_09/israelsept00) to
preventing the [transfer of used light aircraft from Spain to
Venezuela](https://www.defenseindustrydaily.com/love-on-the-rocks-casas-600m-venezuelan-plane-sale-in-heavy-turbulence-01887/).
It strictly regulates, [when it wants
to](https://www.stimson.org/sites/default/files/file-attachments/ArmsSales_WithGreatPower_FINAL.pdf),
how these weapons are used by the purchasing states themselves. **[Even
France, a longtime ally in counter-terror and major power in its own
right, [needs to get U.S. approval before deploying its own
Reapers](https://warontherocks.com/2017/09/the-french-turn-to-armed-drones/).
The capability and value of the American product]{.underline}** (as well
as the continued alignment of both countries' interests) **[are enough
for France to swallow its sovereign pride]{.underline}** on this front.
U.S. arms exports rely on a simple bargain**[: Clients join an
American-dominated global supply chain in return for better value
weapons, larger orders of subcomponents from local firms, and access to
leading-edge weapons technology. These smaller states, in turn,
surrender to the United States large swathes of their foreign and
defense policies, including foregoing sales to regimes that threaten
U.S. interests]{.underline}**. The process is characterized by hard
bargaining and by a considerable degree of coercion by the United
States, such as [when it temporarily kicked Israel out of the Joint
Strike Fighter
program](https://www.defenseindustrydaily.com/reports-israel-frozen-out-of-f35-development-0377/)
for selling unmanned aerial vehicle parts to China. Sovereign states are
of course reluctant to hand over their foreign policy, but the United
States can use financial incentives (thereby reducing the economic
benefit at home) to convince countries to buy American. Consider the
formidable missile defense complex the United States is trying to create
in South Asia among itself, Japan, and South Korea. Trump has suggested
that, contrary to current agreements, South Korea pay for the THAAD
missile defense system, at a billion dollars a battery, deployed in
North Gyeongsang province: "[We're going to protect them. But they
should pay for that, and they understand
that](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-trump-interview-highlights/highlights-of-reuters-interview-with-trump-idUSKBN17U0D4)."
But South Korea [has already paid a heavy
price](http://money.cnn.com/2017/08/30/news/economy/china-hyundai-south-korea-thaad/index.html)
for deploying THAAD due to Chinese economic retaliation. And there are
massive security spillovers if South Korea continues to participate.
Japan and South Korea's participation in the Aegis system, for example,
pulls two states loath to cooperate with each other bilaterally into
something resembling a collective-security network. If economic
concessions on THAAD or a [possible \$1.7 billion Aegis missile
purchase](https://www.cnbc.com/2017/09/11/south-korea-missile-defense-thaad-system-cant-do-the-job-alone.html)
are necessary to bring South Korea into this network, that may be a
price worth paying.

### NB -- Solves Defense Industry DA

#### The counterplan threads the needle -- it provides Congress increased authority while maintaining the level of arms sales that the defense industry needs.

**[The United States is the largest arms supplier to Saudi Arabia and
the UAE, two lucrative customers of the U.S. defense
industry]{.underline}**. Saudi Arabia was the largest importer of U.S.
arms, having purchased \$112 billion in weapons from 2013 through 2017.
The UAE was the [second-largest
importer](https://www.npr.org/2018/10/15/657588534/fact-check-how-much-does-saudi-arabia-spend-on-arms-deals-with-the-u-s)
of U.S. arms in the same time span. Since 2009, over [\$27
billion](https://static.wixstatic.com/ugd/3ba8a1_4498bdea89b148989be12b75281be4f5.pdf)
in weapons have been offered to the UAE in thirty-two separate deals
under the Pentagon's Foreign Military Sales program. These arms sales
continue, despite both countries' history of diverting arms to favored
militias. Saudi Arabia has been purchasing weapons from third parties to
pass on to allied governments and groups at least since the 1970s,
sometimes on behalf of the U.S. government. Transparency International's
Government Defense Anti-Corruption Index ranks Saudi Arabia and the UAE
in its high-risk category for corruption, with Saudi Arabia receiving a
score of zero out of four (zero being the worst) and the UAE receiving a
score of one for lacking a well-scrutinized process for arms export
decisions that aligns with international protocols. The CNN
investigation comes as Congress ramps up its opposition to U.S. support
for the Saudi-led coalition. Former U.S. president Barack Obama's
administration only reluctantly agreed to support the Saudi-led
coalition as it went on the offense in 2015, seeing it as an unwinnable
proxy war against Iran. Obama had put restrictions on arms sales and
intelligence cooperation with the coalition in 2016, but President
Donald Trump's administration lifted those restrictions in March 2017,
just prior to Trump's overseas visit to Saudi Arabia. Saudi human rights
abuses in Yemen using [U.S.
weapons](https://edition.cnn.com/interactive/2018/09/world/yemen-airstrikes-intl/index.html),
such as the airstrike on a [school
bus](https://edition.cnn.com/2018/08/17/middleeast/us-saudi-yemen-bus-strike-intl/index.html)
in August 2018 that killed forty children, and the murder of Khashoggi
have shocked the U.S. public and Congress. In the National Defense
Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2018, Congress required the
departments of Defense and State to certify that the Saudi-led coalition
was doing all it could to prevent civilian casualties; the State
Department failed to provide that justification when it was due earlier
this month**[. In December, the
[Senate](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/12/13/us/politics/yemen-saudi-war-pompeo-mattis.html)
approved a measure to end arms shipments to Saudi Arabia]{.underline}**,
despite the Trump administration's strong opposition to the bill**[. The
measure did not have enough votes to override a presidential veto, but
senators have promised to introduce an even tougher bill in
2019.]{.underline}** Last week, the
[House](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/13/us/politics/yemen-war-saudi-arabia.html)
also passed a measure to end U.S. assistance to the Saudi-led coalition
in Yemen, but again without enough votes to override an expected
presidential veto. The Trump administration continues to approve arms
shipments to the Saudi coalition. In 2018 alone, the United States
directly sold \$4.4 billion in arms to Saudi Arabia, and the
administration approved the latest sale of [Patriot missile
upgrades](https://www.al-monitor.com/pulse/originals/2019/01/saudia-arabia-us-missile-defense-boost-khashoggi.html)
in December. Tens of billions of dollars in

part of the controversial, alleged May 2017 [\$110 billion arms
deal](https://www.brookings.edu/blog/markaz/2017/06/05/the-110-billion-arms-deal-to-saudi-arabia-is-fake-news/)
with Saudi Arabia. **[The Trump administration has shown little
inclination to loosen its close ties with Saudi Arabia and the UAE
despite the death of Khashoggi or the conduct of the war in
Yemen.]{.underline}** The monarchs of Saudi Arabia and the UAE can
conduct these proxy operations and divert equipment with no oversight
and almost no input from their own citizens. Both countries are absolute
monarchies, and their legislative bodies are advisory and contain only
regime-approved members. Both countries also stamp out any free press
and most independent civil society. Information on defense policies,
including the war in Yemen, is kept secret by the monarchs and their
inner circles. Most available information on Saudi and Emirati coalition
operations and weapons transfers comes from external parties, such as
U.S. government weapons sales notifications, news organizations, and
human rights organizations. **[Given the lack of effective Saudi and
Emirati citizen or parliamentary oversight on the conduct of the war in
Yemen and associated weapons transfers, it is crucial that the United
States and other arms-exporting nations conduct additional due diligence
and put controls on any exports to Saudi Arabia and the
UAE]{.underline}**. The CNN investigation demonstrates that the
stringent due diligence and accountability that should be required for
such sales has not been conducted**[. As the Trump administration
continues to approve arms sales, an emboldened Congress inches ever
closer---often across partisan lines---to cutting off those very same
sales.]{.underline}**

Control: A Review of the Obama Administration's Export Control Reform
Initiative and Suggestions for the Future," CITBA Policy Paper, May 13.

Despite the fact that the United States leads the world in conventional
arms trade, [the over-complicated and cumbersome export control regime
threatens to weaken the defense industry as a whole]{.underline}, as it
already has done in some sectors. For instance, [companies]{.underline}
producing computers (Hewlett-Packard and IBM), communications satellites
(Hughes, now Boeing), aerospace technologies (United Technologies), and
machine tools (MAG Industrial Automation Systems) [have voiced concerns
about the uneven competition between U.S. and foreign industry due to
ITAR and EARs restrictions]{.underline}.92 U.S. components are being
designed out of foreign systems and some foreign companies, such as the
satellite manufacturer Thales Alenia Space and the rocket motor
manufacturer Swiss Propulsion Laboratory, advertise its products as
"ITARfree" and totally free of U.S. content.93 In some cases, there is
evidence that ITAR and EARs have solidified market niches for foreign
competitors in the areas of aerospace (the European Aeronautic Defence
and Space Company), satellites (Thales Alenia Space), composite carbon
manufacturing equipment (the Spanish firm M. Torres), and night vision
equipment, which is produced by numerous firms in France, Israel, South
Africa, China, and Russia.94 [The restrictions also impact who can work
for U.S. industry and often time cuts out or compartmentalizes the
brightest and best foreign scientists and researchers whose work could
potentially contribute to the development and innovation of various U.S.
technologies]{.underline}.95

[The]{.underline} ITAR and EAR [restrictions create an estimated \$9
billion per year loss to U.S. industry]{.underline} due to
over-restrictive export controls. 96 [This is significant because one
third of defense industry output is supported by defense exports and the
regulations affect industry's ability to create American jobs and invest
in new defense capabilities for the future.]{.underline} 97 Moreover,
[this loss is often unjustified because the Department of State and
Commerce approve the majority of export license
application]{.underline}. In April 2010, former Defense Secretary Gates
called for the removal of licensing requirements for the bulk of the
tens of thousands of license applications to the European Union and
North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) countries that overwhelming
received approved export license and insisted resources should be
concentrated on placing "higher walls...around fewer, more critical
items."98

#### Overhauling End Use is uniquely key to maintaining defense industry sales to allies.

Control: A Review of the Obama Administration's Export Control Reform

VII\. Conclusion The current export regime created under AECA and EAA is
archaic and does not meet the needs of U.S. national security and
foreign policy objectives. The framework is complex, duplicative, and
has caused confusion for not only U.S. industry, but foreign purchasers.
The licensing requirements differ under ITAR and EARs and jurisdiction
conflicts arise. Moreover, what is often caught in the ITAR and EARs
licensing process has no true bearing on U.S. national security
concerns. The Obama Administration has taken the first steps to overhaul
this outdated system. Efforts to review the USML and convert dual use
items to the control of the Department of Commerce will help to
eliminate the bureaucratic burden that U.S. manufacturer's face when
trying to export less critical and sensitive technologies. Creating STA
exemptions for countries also eliminates unnecessary bureaucratic
resources for license application that are approved in the majority of
cases. Despite these efforts, [more reform overhauls are needed to
update the current U.S. export regime. Congress must act to pass new
legislation to ensure export control is consistent and transparent into
the future. Such legislation must ensure a new SECA is created with
enough authority to coordinate input from all interested U.S.
agencies.]{.underline} Additionally, a new SECL must be established in
order to ensure protection of the U.S. "crown jewel" technologies that
have high implications for U.S. national security. The SECA must also
ensure the controls placed on sensitive technologies are upheld by
foreign purchasers and must have the ability to take remedial actions
for non-compliance. [The U.S. must also work with partner nations and
allies to help enhance export controls of sensitive technologies
worldwide.]{.underline} This can be done by promoting other allies and
partners to enact and implement convention arms and dual-use
technologies legislation on a domestic level. The DTT process and
ratifying the UN Arms Trade Treaty are two mechanisms that can help
promote U.S. interests and controls over sensitive technologies
worldwide[**.** Overhauling the U.S. export control legal framework is
imperative to ensuring national security and foreign policy objectives
are accomplished. It is also **essential to ensure the U.S. can maintain
its healthy U.S. defense industry, which creates American jobs and
fosters the U.S. economy**.]{.underline} [Congress]{.underline} and the
Obama Administration [need to]{.underline} build on the ECRI steps to
[ensure a holistic, robust approach to export control reform is adopted
to]{.underline} enhance national security and **[guarantee U.S.
technological edge.]{.underline}**

members. The senators requested an immediate briefing by senior Trump

Citing that UAE officials recently confirmed to Congressional staff that
at least some of the reported transfers did in fact occur, [the Senators
laid out the serious implications of the allegations]{.underline} and
expressed their alarm that such actions would be taken by American
allies. "[We expect vital security partners like Saudi Arabia and the
UAE to show due care with respect to **protecting transfers of sensitive
U.S. military technology**]{.underline}," wrote the senators, who
concluded their letter with a list of specific questions intended to
shed light on the startling accusations in the media reports. "Negligent

The text of the letter can be found here and below:

Dear Secretaries Pompeo and Shanahan:

We write to express our deep concern over recent media reports that
Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates (UAE) may have transferred
U.S. origin weapons, including small arms, anti-tank missiles and
armored vehicles to armed Yemeni groups that include affiliates of al
Qaeda fighters and hardline Salafi militias. UAE officials recently
acknowledged to Congressional staff that at least some of the reported
transfers did in fact occur, and claimed that U.S. officials were aware
of these transfers. Such transfers are almost certainly in direct
violation of sales agreements made between the U.S. and Saudi Arabia and
the UAE, and a violation of Section 3 of the Arms Export Control Act.
They may also contravene certifications made to Congress that such
transfers would not take place. We are further concerned that, according
to the reports, some of these weapons and vehicles may have been
captured by Iran-backed Houthi forces, potentially giving Iran and its
proxies like the Houthis and Hezbollah access to sensitive U.S. military
technology.

[Negligent treatment of sensitive U.S. military technology]{.underline},
including the possible violation of important restrictions on third
party use, could further destabilize the region, [endanger U.S.
personnel and worsen the suffering of]{.underline} ordinary
[Yemenis]{.underline} by intensifying the fighting and making a peaceful
political solution for Yemen more difficult to reach. We expect vital
security partners like Saudi Arabia and the UAE to show due care with
respect to protecting transfers of sensitive U.S. military technology.

To maintain critical cooperation with these partners in pursuit of
shared interests across the region, [we must **ensure compliance with
U.S. laws and regulations.**]{.underline} To that end, [we request a
briefing]{.underline} by senior officials who are fully knowledgeable on
these matters and are prepared [to address the following]{.underline}
has soon as reasonably possible, but no later than March 4, on the
following:

[The amount and types of U.S. military equipment that may have been
transferred or lost by Saudi Arabia]{.underline} and the UAE to armed
groups in Yemen and the identity of those armed groups;

[The amount and types of U.S. military equipment that may remain in the
possession of armed groups in Yemen]{.underline} and the identity of
those groups;

The amount and types of U.S. military equipment that may have been
captured by Houthi forces, along with the likelihood and implications of
Iranian access to them;

Which officials in the U.S. government were made aware of these
transfers and when;

The efforts, if any, being made by the U.S., Saudi Arabia and the UAE to
recover such lost or transferred equipment and the amount of equipment
recovered so far;

[If there are grounds to believe that such equipment may have been
transferred in violation of agreements with the U.S.,]{.underline} and
the extent to which Saudi Arabia and the UAE were made aware that such
transfers violate the terms of sale for this equipment; and

**[Steps being taken to ensure that inappropriate transfers or losses do
not happen in the future]{.underline}**, including the results and
status of any investigations undertaken by the Department of State and
Department of Defense concerning these allegations.

## Solvency Deficits

### No Solvency -- Intentional Diversion

#### CP can't solve intentional diversion -- just an illusion of control.

**Vranckx '16** (An, Associate Research Fellow at UNU-CRIS and published
a variety of articles on arms sales, "CONTAINING DIVERSION: Arms end-use
and post-delivery controls," GRIP REPORTS 2016/4
http://www.smallarmssurvey.org/fileadmin/docs/L-External-publications/2016/GRIP-2016-Containing-diversion.pdf)

In the short term, calls for information sharing on an ATT-wide scale
and EU countries' actual end-use monitoring programmes won't close the
virtuous loop in the same way as the Blue Lantern. Their arms export
control authorities may also want to hold on to the awareness that in
the foreseeable future, the exports they authorise will remain more
likely to be diverted than are exports by U.S. companies, that are
embedded in the US's encompassing military, diplomatic and economic
grid. [Post-delivery verification, end-use monitoring and exchange of
relevant information cannot guarantee that no more arms will be
**diverted** from legal exports]{.underline}. [**It will remain
inherently difficult** to evaluate to what extent the instruments
discourage diversion schemes and effectively prevent authorised arms
transfers from becoming available to unauthorised users.]{.underline}
**[Violations of non-re-export clauses and other modes of illegal arms
transfers are not usually advertised]{.underline}**. [Such re-exports
are unlikely to be reported -- especially in open sources -- and
evidence that they happened is rarely ever collated in
statistics.]{.underline} [The end-use monitoring instruments that have
recently been put in place could create **the illusion of
control**]{.underline} and forge some sort of assurance that leads arms
export licensing authorities to OK end-users they would have had good
reason to be concerned about in earlier days. Finally, **[even
if]{.underline}** [transferred arms remain under the control of the
designated users and in the country that the end-use documentation
described as their destination**, the use of the arms is not guaranteed
to be restricted to the purposes described in that documentation.**
Deployment for other purposes is a more visible type of diversion than
are hidden re-exports.]{.underline} Under current conditions, however,
such visible unintended use has not given sufficient ground to try and
recuperate the arms, or ensure that further deployment is restricted to
intended end-use.

#### Aff key -- Saudi interests mean they ignore end-use controls

CNN
[broke](https://www.cnn.com/interactive/2019/02/middleeast/yemen-lost-us-arms/)
an important story today outlining how Saudi Arabia and the United Arab
Emirates (UAE) have intentionally transferred American-made weapons to
violent non-state actors. Intended as a government to government sale,
everything from American rifles to Oshkosh armored vehicles to TOW
anti-tank missiles have made their way into the hands of "[Al
Qaeda-linked fighters, hard-line Salafi militias, and other factions
waging war in
Yemen](https://www.cnn.com/interactive/2019/02/middleeast/yemen-lost-us-arms/)."
Although the extent of the problem in Yemen is disturbing, [the illegal
dispersion of American weapons is nothing new. And the fact that Saudi
Arabia]{.underline} and the UAE [are unreliable customers should not
come as any surprise]{.underline}. American experience in the Middle
East has long demonstrated that sending weapons into conflict zones is a
recipe for trouble. After the U.S. invasion of Iraq, for example, the
United States provided Iraq with a vast amount of weapons and equipment
in order to rebuild the Iraqi army. Later, however, the Islamic State
(ISIS) [wound
up](https://www.amnesty.org.uk/how-isis-islamic-state-isil-got-its-weapons-iraq-syria)with
almost an entire division's worth of American equipment after defeating
the Iraqi army in 2014, helping fuel its emergence. This equipment found
its way into Syria, where ISIS also [stole American-supplied
rockets](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/checkpoint/wp/2017/12/14/how-u-s-weapons-helped-isis-fuel-the-industrial-revolution-of-terrorism/?utm_term=.b93c2a0a3de4)
just weeks after they were sent to arm Syrian rebels fighting ISIS and
Assad. Nor is the problem of dispersion limited to the battlefield.
American weapons often wind up crossing national borders to be sold to
the highest bidders on the black market. The CNN report notes that
[Yemeni black markets are showcasing American weapons, but so are
markets in
[Somalia](https://www.voanews.com/a/somalia-weapons-12feb13/1601850.html),]{.underline}

America](https://www.latimes.com/opinion/op-ed/la-oe-muggah-arming-latin-america-20150118-story.html)**.**]{.underline}
Losing weapons to adversaries and criminals makes life difficult enough.
[What makes the Yemen case particularly troublesome is the fact that
Saudi Arabia]{.underline} and the UAE [**felt free to give up control**
over American weapons **on purpose**. The Saudi coalition hoped to gain
traction and support from the militias in the complex political
landscape of the protracted conflict. The fact **that such transfers
were technically illegal meant little.** Though arms sales advocates
argue that selling weapons to allies will allow the United States to
influence their behavior, Yemen illustrates the exact opposite. When
arms sales customers have more immediate concerns in their own backyard,
their willingness to take direction from Washington, D.C.
dwindles.]{.underline} Policy makers should take this report as an
opportunity to rethink U.S. arms sales policy. As we have shown in
[previous
research](https://www.cato.org/publications/policy-analysis/risky-business-role-arms-sales-us-foreign-policy),
these challenges are not impossible to predict. [Some countries to which
the United States transfers weapons, like Saudi Arabia]{.underline},
Egypt, Afghanistan, Sudan, and Iraq, [represent greater risks for
unintended negative consequences than others]{.underline}. A more
prudent arms sales policy would acknowledge that promises and [end-use
monitoring are **insufficient** to prevent the misuse of American
weapons abroad]{.underline}. In some cases, **[not selling weapons may
be the only way to prevent downstream problems.]{.underline}**

### No Solvency -- Noncompliance

#### End use fails -- Egypt proves noncompliant governments will drag their feet and refuse end use checks.

According to OMC-E officials and documentation, on at least two
occasions before fiscal year 2015, Egyptian officials prevented U.S.
personnel from conducting required physical security inspections at a
storage site housing many of Egypt's U.S.-origin NVDs that at the time
were subject to Golden Sentry enhanced end-use monitoring.34 In each
instance, Egyptian officials brought the NVDs to a central location,
enabling DOD personnel to conduct serial number inventories.35 While
[Egypt, as a sovereign nation, is not subject to U.S. government
requirements unless it has agreed to them with the U.S. government, the
Egyptian government has committed in writing to permit inspections of
NVD storage facilities.]{.underline} The Security Assistance Management
Manual includes standard terms and conditions that must be included in a
Letter of Offer and Acceptance,36 including a provision in which the
purchaser agrees to permit scheduled inspections or physical inventories
upon the U.S. government's request, except when other means of end-use
monitoring verification shall have been mutually agreed. Five of the six
Letters of Offer and Acceptance covering NVDs subject to enhanced end
use monitoring physical security inspections as of December 1, 2014,
included such a provision. According to the manager of the Golden Sentry
program at the Defense Security Cooperation Agency, one Letter of Offer
and Acceptance did not contain this provision because the NVDs were
provided on a grant basis and the Egyptian government agreed to permit
observation of the items under a separate exchange of letters. In
addition to the terms and conditions in the Letters of Offer and
Acceptance, a June 2012 control plan for the physical security and
accountability of NVDs signed by the Egyptian Ministry of Defense notes
that NVD storage facilities will be subject to compliance assessments,
audits, and inventories by U.S. representatives.37 Nonetheless, [during
a]{.underline} February 2012 [Compliance Assessment Visit, Egyptian
officials prohibited DOD inspectors from accessing an NVD storage
facility, which prevented the inspectors from assessing whether the
proper physical security measures were in place]{.underline}, according
to DOD officials. This contributed to DOD's assessment that [Egypt's
procedures to comply with the conditions of the transfer agreements for
U.S.-provided defense articles needed improvement.]{.underline} In
October 2014, [Egyptian officials again prohibited OMC-E personnel from
accessing the same NVD storage facility to verify physical
security]{.underline}, according to DOD documentation. A senior OMC-E
official stated that he asked Egyptian officials to comply with the
requirement to permit physical inspections of NVD storage facilities but
the [officials did not comply]{.underline}. According to another OMC-E
official responsible for Golden Sentry end-use monitoring in Egypt, the
Egyptian Armed Forces told OMC-E officials that they brought the NVDs to
a central location to be inventoried for OMC-E's convenience and
security because the NVDs were deployed with units located around the
country, including some unsafe locations. The same official noted that
the OMC-E explained to its Egyptian counterparts that DOD's policy
required them to either verify the physical security of the facilities
where the NVDs were housed or review the Egyptian Armed Forces' log
books to confirm that the NVDs were deployed with military units in the
field and were no longer in storage. However, [Egyptian officials were
not responsive to either of these requests for reasons]{.underline} that
are unclear, according to the OMC-E official.

### No Solvency -- Enforcement

#### United States' geopolitical interests mean that end use monitoring for Saudi Arabia is not and likely will not be enforced.

**Vranckx '16** (An, Associate Research Fellow at UNU-CRIS and published
a variety of articles on arms sales, "CONTAINING DIVERSION: Arms end-use
and post-delivery controls," GRIP REPORTS 2016/4
http://www.smallarmssurvey.org/fileadmin/docs/L-External-publications/2016/GRIP-2016-Containing-diversion.pdf)

A recent case where those limits are exceeded concerns deployment of
U.S. supplied goods by Saudi Arabia's armed forces. U.S. arms export
control authorities must have had reasonable assurance as to the Saudi
client's capacity and willingness to comply with the end-use
documentation of solely legitimate defensive use of the goods. If the
Watch List led any red flags to be raised when the deal to supply such
goods was in the making, and even if such flags would have led to visits
in site, the final decision was to approve the arms transfer. However as
of mid-2015, some such equipment has been used for offensive goals in
operations, as a Saudi-led coalition began deploying against Houthi
strongholds in Yemen. The deployments were found to be in violation of
international humanitarian law. By 2016, the international Cluster
Munitions Coalition (CMC) reliably documented Saudi deployment of
CBU-105 Sensor Fuzed Weapons (weapons that disperse canisters that
release sub-munitions) in densely populated areas.37 CMC also revealed
that "in recent years", a Massachusetts-based company had obtained the
licence from the U.S. government to supply these weapons to Saudi Arabia
(and other recipient states that dispose of airborne means to deliver
such weapons) under the strict condition not to use these weapons in
civilian areas. Non-compliance with these end-use conditions was
established by CMC, not by Blue Lantern envoys. **[The U.S. export
control agencies are nevertheless presumed eager to sanction
non-compliant end-users,]{.underline}** in line with their mission,
**[as well as within the legal framework that mandates their activities.
No information is available that the U.S. export control
system]{.underline}** (be that the Blue Lantern, or "Golden Sentry"
programme that concerns Foreign Military Sales of defence articles and
services via government-to-government channels) **[is currently taking
action to recall licences for further supplies to the Saudi armed
forces, nor to recover the equipment that was transferred in the past,
nor even to prevent further unauthorised deployments of the
equipment.]{.underline}** Proof of this unintended use would be expected
to feed into the Blue Lantern monitoring cycle, and as such provide the
U.S. export licensing authority with means to sanction this particular
violation of end-use conditions. These sanctions could become part of a
broader and longer-term endeavour to limit the use of any transferred
equipment to the specific importer and exporter agreed on at the time of
licensing. Proven non-compliance with end-use documentation in one case
is sure to be noted and recorded in the Blue Lantern monitoring cycle.
Such records generate "flags" on its Watch List, and can impact
decisions to authorise new export licences that identify the
once-non-compliant party as the end-user. In this particular case, it is
of note that **[Saudi armed forces hold a wide range of U.S.- supplied
goods]{.underline}**. This context makes the Saudi armed forces
dependent on maintenance services and spare parts that the relevant U.S.
suppliers can continue to supply only if the U.S. export control
authority approves licence requests to that end**[. This gives the U.S.
arms export licensing system leverage to deny future licence requests.
However, it would not seem certain that the leverage is effectively
used. Geopolitical considerations and foreign policy choices may demand
that the U.S. licensing authority refrains from refusing further licence
applications.]{.underline}** Unintended end-use of the cluster munition,
as last documented in February 2016, would appear likely to be
downplayed by the fact that these same Saudi forces are a major ally in
the U.S.-led airstrikes on Syria. The discussed case can serve here as a
reminder that the situation in a recipient state may change. In Saudi
Arabia, the context of possession and use of the goods evolved
significantly over the past few years. In 2016 it no longer resembles
the context that U.S. (and many other Western) arms transfer control
authorities appraised in prior years, when they approved major export
licences to Saudi Arabia. These same export control authorities may not
come to the same decision about authorising transfer of the same goods
and same end-user, if the latter were subject of a new export licence
request. Transfer licences that were given at one time may be revoked,
to prevent more transfers taking place under the same licence. But
actual transfers authorised in the past when circumstances were
different are difficult to undo. In all likelihood, the recipient at
that time had intentions to use the goods in another way than a
"defensive mode" recorded in the end-use documentation that the
exporting country's authorities had judged bona fide. The type of
diversion in the documented case is one that takes transferred military
goods "away from intended end-use" at an appreciable time after
transfer. The diversion scheme, if there was one, could not possibly be
anticipated nor detected at the time the decision was made to authorise
that transfer. For the purposes of this analysis, it appears instructive
to consider this particular case of non-compliance with end-use
documentation as an "unenvisaged" case of diversion. Such case needs to
be distinguished from diversion operations that are designed with the
purpose to mislead licensing authorities, and that enable authorised
arms exports to be transferred to unauthorised -- often illicit -
end-use and end-uses. However large the difficulty the U.S. State
Department's Blue Lantern would face to predict changes in the
importer's military policy, the programme is proving rather effective in
detecting, and preventing, attempts to mislead the U.S. arms export
control authority. Year after year it reports "unfavourable" findings of
Blue Lantern checks that lead the requested licences to be denied,
revoked or even passed on to criminal investigation. In the course of
the years examined in Table 3, the "unfavourable rate" was also seen to
diminish. Diligent scrutiny of end-use documentation is a key line of
defence against the latter, more deceptive type of diversion scheme,
where "such documents are effective only in the context of a broader
system that includes a thorough consideration of diversion risks at the
licensing stage, the verification of end-user documentation, and
complementary post-shipment controls".38 In the Blue Lantern programme,
information gleaned from each of these controls and verifications is
additionally ensured to feed into a monitoring cycle, which revolves
around an agile and well-maintained information system. The importance
of that information cycle in effectively detecting and preventing
diversion is something that export licensing authorities elsewhere might
care to bear in mind.

#### End-use controls fail -- no enforcement and Saudi Arabia won't cooperate. 

**Spindel '19** (Jennifer, 5-14-2019, \"The Case for Suspending American
Arms Sales to Saudi Arabia,\" War on the Rocks,
https://warontherocks.com/2019/05/the-case-for-suspending-american-arms-sales-to-saudi-arabia/)

[The United States could, in theory, impose stricter end-user controls
on Saudi Arabia]{.underline}. This would have the advantage of keeping
Saudi Arabia within the world of U.S. weapons systems, and might prevent
it from diversifying its suppliers, which would ultimately weaken any
leverage the United States might have. Longer-term, it would not be to
America's advantage if Saudi Arabia takes a lesson from Turkey, and
starts courting Russia as a new arms supplier. [**It is difficult to
enforce end-user controls**, since, once a weapon is transferred, the
recipient can use it however it wishes.]{.underline} [It might also be
the case that Saudi Arabia would object to stricter end-user controls,
and would seek new suppliers as a result.]{.underline} An arms embargo
will not be a panacea. But [not doing something sets a problematic
precedent, and allows the difficulty of coordinating an arms embargo
outweigh the potential benefits of one.]{.underline} An embargo is
unlikely to have an immediate effect on Saudi behavior, because an
embargo would be a political signal, rather than a blunt instrument of
coercion. It will take time for a multilateral embargo to emerge and be
put into place, and the United States should work with its allies to
help support their ability to participate in the embargo. [Not acting,
however, would continue to implicitly endorse Saudi behavior, and would
make it more difficult for U.S. allies to believe that future threats of
an embargo are credible.]{.underline}

### No Solvency -- Knowledge Sharing

#### End use fails -- lacks knowledge sharing from State Department.

**United States General Accounting Office 2000** (August 2000, "Foreign
Military Sales: Changes Needed To Correct Weaknesses in End-Use
Monitoring Programs" <https://www.gao.gov/assets/230/229480.pdf>)

For example, under the first standard, [field personnel are required to
conduct an end-use check]{.underline} [within 60 days of
the]{.underline} State Department's [notification]{.underline} to
Congress [that an end-use violation has occurred.]{.underline} The main
purpose of these checks is to verify that the host country is committed
to proper control and use of U.S.-origin items. [The State Department
reported 12 countries to Congress for end-use violation]{.underline}s in
fiscal years 1997-99. [Field personnel in **only one** of these
countries]{.underline}, however, [responded]{.underline} in our survey
[that they had carried out an end-use check]{.underline}. A DSCA
official told us that because the State Department is responsible for
reporting end-use violations to Congress, [DSCA assumed that State
Department personnel at the embassy were notifying military field
personnel of violations in their country]{.underline}. However, [DSCA
officials **did not actually determine whether a mechanism was in place
to notify field personnel**]{.underline}. [Field personnel]{.underline}
in the countries we visited told us that they sometimes learn about
alleged violations through their embassy but [**do not know whether the
violations have been reported** to Congress, thereby requiring an
end-use check]{.underline}. From the establishment of the standard in
1996 through March 2000, [the State Department did not provide any
information on end-use violations to DSCA.]{.underline} State Department
officials told us that due to the political sensitivity of the violation
reports, they only provide the reports to select Members of Congress and
are not required to provide them to DSCA.14 According to these
officials, the information contained in these violation reports could
seriously harm U.S. relations with the country involved if it was
inadvertently released. In March 2000, DSCA and State officials
developed a procedure for State to provide DSCA with a summary of the
information contained in the violation reports. However, [the State
Department does not plan to provide DSCA with the reports themselves.
DSCA advised that **without the violation reports, field personnel would
not have sufficient information to determine when to conduct end-use
checks** on the basis of a specific violation]{.underline}. Field
personnel could benefit from such information by using it to determine
which countries have weaknesses in their ability or willingness to
protect U.S. technology. Field personnel could then more carefully
monitor sensitive or vulnerable defense equipment transferred to these
countries through the FMS program. In addition, information on a
country's ability or willingness to protect U.S. technology is one of
the factors used in the process of approving the transfer of U.S.
defense equipment.

#### There's a unique net benefit to ending all arms sales -- the State Department and the Commerce Department both loosely monitor arms sales in the first place.

**Yablon 2019** \[Alex, "Oversight of International Gun Sales is in
Shambles" 8 March 2019 via The Trace. Alex is an experienced reporter
for respected journalistic outfits such as Vice and The Trace
<https://www.thetrace.org/2019/03/state-department-gun-exports-oversight/>\]

The State Department is supposed to notify Congress if it approves sales
of firearms worth \$1 million or more, or major weapon systems like
vehicles or missiles worth \$14 million or more. Lawmakers can delay or
reject an application if they have concerns. In one case reviewed, the
State Department neglected to alert Congress of a sizable sale of
assault rifles to the Philippines less than a year after legislators
quashed a similar export package to the same country**[. In October
2016, Senator Ben Cardin of Maryland]{.underline}**, the ranking
Democrat on the Foreign Relations Committee, **[[denied a sale of 26,000
assault
rifles](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-philippines-usa-rifles-idUSKBN12V2AM)
to the Philippines]{.underline}**. Cardin noted that Philippine
President Rodrigo Duterte's war on drugs had resulted in 2,300
extrajudicial executions. Days later, Duterte [called
Democrats](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-philippines-usa-rifles/philippines-duterte-rails-at-u-s-monkeys-for-halting-gun-sale-idUSKBN12X18O)
who had opposed the deal "fools" and "monkeys." **[Then in July 2017,
the Philippines applied to buy 400,000 AR-15 rifles, two million
30-round magazines, 586 million rounds of ammunition, and 426,448
cleaning and maintenance kits. According to the OIG report, the State
Department did not notify Congress before rubber stamping the
deal.]{.underline}** Officials with the State Department told auditors
it approved the application without telling Congress because the
computer the officer used to review the application had "dropped" the
last zero from the dollar value of the deal, an error neither the
officer or the auditors could replicate. A State Department spokesman
said the department had since created a new end-use training program, a
database of officers who have performed the checks, and is in the
process of creating a refresher course. The deal was terminated in
November of that year, but only once the American Embassy staff in
Manila told superiors they could not locate the Florida-based gun dealer
who was selling the guns to the Philippines. The report said the unnamed
dealer "disappeared." The report doesn't say if any guns were shipped
before the termination, and the State Department has no mechanism for
clawing back gun sales approved in error. The March GAO report suggests
that the Commerce Department could make similar mistakes when it takes
over oversight of gun exports. **[The GAO found that State and Commerce
hadn't yet figured out how they would share "watch lists" of suspicious
or prohibited customers. Commerce doesn't typically require additional
checks on end users of exports that it currently oversees. When Commerce
does perform end user checks on other exports it currently reviews, 90
percent of the time the checks occur after the good have already been
shipped.]{.underline}** (State typically checks suspicious sales before
shipment). The department doesn't require exporters to disclose if they
offered political contributions, gifts, commissions, or fees as part of
sale. Furthermore, Commerce does not have any relevant staff assigned to
review firearm sales to the Western Hemisphere, Afghanistan, Burma,
Laos, Afghanistan, or anywhere in Africa, aside from Egypt. The
department told the GAO it has no plans to assign personnel to cover
firearm sales to these countries. Instead, it will provide oversight
with staff who either visit the countries temporarily or do not have
experience reviewing arms deals.

## Net Benefit Answers

### Links to Industry DA

#### End-use control triggers the industry DA -- increasing oversight lengthens the licensing process.

**FAS 13** \[Federation of American Scientists 9-9-2013, \"U.S. Arms
Export Controls \"Reforms\",\"
https://fas.org/programs/ssp/asmp/issueareas/us_arms_export_reform.html\]

For many years, arms export control policy was based on preservation of
national security and the need for allies to keep weapons technology out
of the hands of Eastern Bloc countries. With the end of the Cold War,
arms export control has become more complicated and difficult. The
post-Cold War global arms market is extremely competitive; defense firms
compete for an ever-greater share of a smaller pie. Partly in response
to this competition, [the defense industry has put tremendous pressure
on the U.S. government to **speed up the arms export licensing
process**, which industry claims is too slow and therefore **threatens
its market share.**]{.underline}

At the same time, the need for rigorous export controls has never been
greater. Arms traffickers roam the planet looking for weapons and
defense technologies that they can sell, at a huge profit, to rogue
states, terrorists and other dangerous individuals and groups.
[Preventing]{.underline} these [individuals]{.underline} and countries
[from acquiring U.S. defense technology is the primary objective of the
licensing process that **industry seeks to streamline.**]{.underline}
Thus, [government agencies responsible for controlling arms exports are
confronted with the unenviable task of balancing **industry\'s demands
for decontrol** with the need to keep dangerous technologies out of the
hands of unauthorized end-users.]{.underline}

[The defense industry\'s efforts began to bear fruit]{.underline} in May
2000, [when]{.underline} the [Clinton]{.underline} administration
[unvieled]{.underline} the the Defense Trade Security Initiative - a set
of [changes]{.underline} to the arms export licensing system [designed
to **expedite weapons exports**]{.underline} to NATO members, Japan, and
Australia, and to increase cooperation between European and American
weapons manufacturers. These changes ranged from creating new export
licenses for entire weapons systems to expediting license reviews for
NATO members. [The most far reaching reform would be to exempt favored
allies from some arms export license requirements]{.underline} in
exchange for modifications to their export licensing systems (the U.S.
government is trying to encourage other states to tighten their export
controls by offering them license-free U.S. weapons exports as a
reward).

The Arms Sales Monitoring Project is concerned that the defense
industry\'s push to reduce restrictions on arms exports, even to allied
countries, will increase the likelihood that US weapons will be diverted
to agents of rogue regimes, terrorists and criminals. Below is a
collection of our analysis, along with relevant media reports and
government documents.

next showdown between Trump and Congress,\" RT International,
https://www.rt.com/usa/461714-saudi-arms-senate-veto/\]

The disapproval motion is just one prong of the Senate's attack on the
arms deal. [A resolution introduced by Murphy and Young]{.underline} on
Monday [would direct the Trump administration to **provide a report on
Saudi Arabia's human rights record** and Congress to hold a subsequent
vote before the deal could go through.]{.underline} Such a decision
would affect not only the \$8 billion deal in the pipeline, but all
future weapons sales to Riyadh.

While both measures signal discontent in the Senate, the president's
veto power remains his trump card. [Though]{.underline} Sen. Bob
[Menendez]{.underline} (D-New Jersey) [said that the passing of the
disapproval measures is \"just a question of process]{.underline} at
this point," [it **remains unclear** whether enough Republicans will
vote to pass them with a veto-proof supermajority.]{.underline}

And, **[while some Republicans are willing to vote to rebuke the
president, others are keen to preserve the status quo]{.underline}**,
despite concerns over Saudi Arabia's behavior.

"[They're going to buy 'em from somebody," said]{.underline} Sen. John

the Saudis, one of our best allies against our Iranian enemies, is
important."

[Murphy's move to request a human rights report also faces another
**potential stumbling block.**]{.underline} Once passed, the Trump
administration would have 30 days to respond to the human rights query,
and a vote would then have to be scheduled. [With Congress' August

### Perm Solves

**Thrall and Dorminey 2018** (A. Trevor and Caroline, "Risky Business:
The Role of Arms Sales in U.S. Foreign Policy" via *The CATO Institute*
13 March 2018
<https://www.cato.org/publications/policy-analysis/risky-business-role-arms-sales-us-foreign-policy#full>
[A. Trevor Thrall is an associate professor at the Schar School of
Policy and Government at George Mason University and a senior fellow at
the Cato Institute. ](http://www.cato.org/people/trevor-thrall)[Caroline
Dorminey](http://www.cato.org/people/caroline-dorminey) is a policy
analyst at the Cato Institute.)

The United States should reorient its arms sales policy to ensure that
sales provide strategic benefits and to avoid producing negative
unintended consequences. At a practical level, this means reducing arms
sales dramatically, especially to nations with high risk factors for
negative outcomes. Officials should look for other ways to conduct
foreign policy in situations where arms sales have been common tactics
--- such as when the United States negotiates access to military bases
or seeks cooperation in the war on terror. The arms sales process should
also be revised in order to ensure that all sales receive more thorough
scrutiny than has been the case to date. To implement this new vision
for arms sales we recommend the following steps:

1.  **Issue an Updated Presidential Policy Directive on Arms Sales** ---
    Most importantly, the president should issue a new Presidential
    Policy Directive reorienting U.S. arms sales policy so that the new
    default policy is "no sale." The only circumstances in which the
    United States should sell or transfer arms to another country are
    when three conditions are met: (1) there is a direct threat to
    American national security; (2) there is no other way to confront
    that threat other than arming another country; and (3) the United
    States is the only potential supplier of the necessary weapons.\
    \
    The reasoning behind this recommendation is threefold: first, as
    noted, the United States enjoys such a high level of strategic
    immunity that there is currently no direct security rationale for
    arms sales to any nation. Second, even if one believes that the
    United States has an interest in helping other nations defend
    themselves against internal enemies (e.g., Iraq, Afghanistan) or
    external ones (e.g., South Korea, Taiwan, NATO countries), there are
    other ways the United States can help instead of supplying weapons.
    Finally, by halting the sales of weapons the United States will
    decrease the risk of entanglement in conflicts that do not directly
    involve American security. It will also improve the diplomatic
    flexibility of the United States to play the role of honest broker
    and to exert moral leverage on dueling parties.

2.  **Immediately Stop Selling Weapons to Risky Nations** --- **[The
    first step in implementing a new approach should be to stop selling
    weapons to the countries most likely to misuse weapons or to lose
    control of them]{.underline}**. Based on the risk assessment
    described here, we recommend that the United States immediately halt
    the sale of weapons to any nation that scored in the "highest risk"
    category for any risk factor, or which is actively engaged in
    conflict. Taking this action would immediately add 71 nations to the
    list of embargoed nations until further notice. This simple and
    commonsense step would mitigate some of the worst negative
    consequences and stop the United States from enabling conflicts
    abroad.

3.  **Improve and Respond to End-Use Monitoring** --- The United States
    should significantly expand its tracking of the use and misuse of
    American weapons. **[The current system of end-use monitoring does
    not collect enough data on how weapons are used once they are
    transferred. This is largely because the system is designed to
    monitor and prevent instances of dispersion and corruption and is
    not necessarily focused on the use of force by the client military
    and government. Rather than focusing on tracking abuse down to a
    single military unit, end-use monitoring should hold countries
    accountable for the actions of their militaries as a
    whol]{.underline}**e. End-use monitoring should take into account
    the bigger picture of a country's strategic environment and should
    assess weapons sales based on a proposed customer's history,
    actions, and participation in ongoing conflicts. End-use monitoring
    should be tracked and reported annually, and the results should be
    made public to enforce oversight and give Congress the information
    needed to make better-informed decisions.

4.  **Amend the AECA to Require Congressional Approval for All Arms
    Sales** --- Finally, we recommend that the AECA be amended to
    require congressional approval for all arms sales. The current law
    is designed to make arms sales easy by making it difficult for
    Congress to block them. Blocking a sale requires a majority vote in
    both houses of Congress, with such votes typically cropping up
    inconveniently in the middle of other, more-pressing issues on the
    legislative agenda. Congress has exerted little or no influence over
    arms sales and has allowed the executive branch near-complete
    autonomy. Requiring a congressional vote to approve arms sales, on
    the other hand, would subject arms deals to much more intense
    scrutiny than has traditionally been the case, and blocking
    misguided arms sales would be much easier. Requiring a separate
    piece of legislation to approve each arms deal, not simply requiring
    a resolution against, would encourage deliberations about the
    strategic benefits of any proposed deal.
