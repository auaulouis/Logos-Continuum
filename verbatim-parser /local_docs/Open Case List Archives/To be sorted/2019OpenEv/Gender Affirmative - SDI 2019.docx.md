#### The resolution calls for technocratic attempt to objectively manage war/escalation. This [REINFORCES]{.underline} military industrial logic and pushes gendered violence to the periphery- [CEMENTING]{.underline} and [CONTROLLING]{.underline} the conditions for extinction

**Krause 12**

(Keith, PhD IR@Geneva, Leashing the Dogs of War: Arms Control from
Sovereignty to Governmentality in Reconceptualising Arms Control:
Controlling the Means of Violence, ed. Cooper & Mutimer)

So what remains is a set of formal **[[arms
control]{.underline}]{.mark}** agreements, mostly bilateral, but also a
few that were multilateral, designed to manage the potentially most
dangerous and destabilizing aspects of inter-state conflict dynamics.
They [[channeled]{.underline}]{.mark} the
[[confrontation]{.underline}]{.mark} between the superpowers **[[into a
technical and problem-solving logic]{.underline}]{.mark}** that would
facilitate decision making about [[what kinds of weapons to produce and
deploy]{.underline}]{.mark}, and [[under what circumstances to
use]{.underline}]{.mark} them. In addition, after some of the conceptual
confusions of early nuclear strategy (such as Massive Retaliation), arms
control became part of the logic by which decisions over appropriate
(rational) strategies could be designed. In the 1960s and 1970s, in
context of the East-West conflict and nuclear proliferation, maintaining
the conditions of stable deterrence and reducing the risk of war was
perhaps a politically and normatively laudable goal. But [**[arms
control]{.mark}** [was]{.mark}]{.underline} thus also [[linked to
deterrence theory]{.underline}]{.mark} and practice, and [to [the entire
functioning of the so-called m]{.mark}ilitary-[i]{.mark}ndustrial
[c]{.mark}omplex]{.underline}, and **[[not something distinct and in
opposition to it]{.underline}]{.mark}**. [[This vision would
not]{.underline}]{.mark} necessarily [[be accepted by
those]{.underline}]{.mark} -- such as researchers at the Stockholm
International Peace Research Institute (SIPRI) and other think-tanks --
[[who saw themselves as growing out of]{.underline}]{.mark} the
[[peace]{.underline}]{.mark} and anti-nuclear weapons
[[movement]{.underline}s]{.mark}, [but]{.underline} I think **[the
policy acceptability of SIPRI's work]{.underline}** (for example) [[came
precisely from its progressive acceptance of the **underlying rules of
the game**]{.underline}]{.mark}.19 What were these rules of the game?
There are four elements of the Cold War practice of arms control that
warrant a deeper exploration in order to illustrate the normalizing and
sovereign logic of arms control. The [first]{.underline} element was
[the attempt by proponents of arms control to distinguish it
from]{.underline} advocacy of [disarmament]{.underline} in any form.
Disarmament was associated with the failed attempts to negotiate
reductions in armaments during the interwar period. In the 1950s and
1960s, it was associated with the peace and anti-nuclear movements, and
was [seen as the preserve of impractical idealist efforts]{.underline}
-- at best politically naïve; at worst politically suspect. As Jeffrey
Larsen notes, 'in the early 1960s international security specialists
began using the term arms control in place of the term disarmament,
which they believed lacked precision and smacked of utopianism. The
seminal books on arms control published in that era all referred to this
semantic problem'.20 So [[arms control was
presented]{.underline}]{.mark} by its practitioners
[[as]{.underline}]{.mark} directed towards controlling or [[regulating
the numbers, types, deployment or use of certain types or quantities of
arms]{.underline}]{.mark}, and [disarmament was]{.underline} defined as
involving the [reduction or the elimination]{.underline} of particular
weapons and weapons systems, and/or foreswearing of acquisition of new
weapons.21 Although occasionally agreements were signed that did
eliminate weapons systems or particular classes of weapons, most notably
the 1987 Intermediate Nuclear Forces (INF) treaty that eliminated an
entire class of nuclear weapons, when seen as part of the broader
spectrum of nuclear capabilities, such restrictions were tilted more
towards the control side of the equation.22 Overall, **[[arms control
reinforced, not undermined, sovereign state
power]{.mark}.]{.underline}** The [second]{.underline}, related, element
was **[the technocratic or problem-solving orientation]{.underline}** of
arms control practices. Its [[political acceptability came from its
claim to operate within the **same policy frame**]{.underline}
[as]{.underline}]{.mark} other forms of military-strategic thinking,
including of course [[deterrence theory and]{.underline}]{.mark}
strategy, [[alliance-building]{.underline}]{.mark}, and the entire
**[[military-industrial logic]{.mark}]{.underline}** that shaped Western
(and arguably Eastern) security policy. More importantly, however, [[it
provided legitimacy to a counter-intuitive set of policy
prescriptions]{.underline}]{.mark} (such as leaving your own civilian
population vulnerable to nuclear attack, or revealing the equivalent of
state secrets as part of confidence-building measures). And finally, the
technocratic approach also was, in its strongest version, opposed to the
irrational and uncontrollable prescriptions of what, as early as
President Eisenhower, was called the military-industrial complex. High
level [proponents]{.underline} of arms control (Secretary of Defense
Robert McNamara, for example, as well perhaps as Secretary of State
Henry Kissinger), [regarded the defence establishment as unable to set
limits]{.underline} on its threat assessment and concomitant arms
acquisitions[. They wished to subject security policy to **rational
managerial techniques,**]{.underline} including such ideas as
diminishing marginal returns to investments in new weapons, cost-benefit
analysis for weapons systems, and trade offs between competing goals
(the guns-versus-butter debate).23 As Henry Kissinger is once purported
to have said, 'What in the name of God is strategic superiority? What is
the significance of it, politically, militarily, operationally, at these
levels of numbers? What do you do with it?' thus expressing his
frustration with the inability of the nuclear defense establishment to
provide a rationale for its weapons acquisition plans.24 Even more
hawkish arms controllers subscribed to the rational calculus, with, for
example, Paul Nitze arguing, with respect to ballistic missile defense
(Star Wars), that it had to be cost effective on the margin in order to
make strategic sense.25 [[Arms control was thus **more
rational**]{.underline}]{.mark} -- [[and promised to achieve the same
national security goals]{.underline}]{.mark} (including war-fighting
dominance) [at lower cost]{.underline}. But the actual achievements of
arms control negotiations, treaties and agreements are difficult to
assess, even if we use some counter-factual analysis. As noted above,
[[arms control failed to stem the technological arms race]{.mark},
[failed to reduce spending]{.mark}]{.underline} on weapons, [[and
perhaps played]{.underline}]{.mark} only [a [marginal role in preventing
a violent superpower confrontation]{.mark}]{.underline}. **[In all of
its forms]{.underline}**, [**[arms control was not a transformative
paradigm]{.mark}** -- but a techno-managerial project]{.underline}. The
[transformation]{.underline} of inter-state relations [via]{.underline}
either [nuclear disarmament or nuclear holocaust was to be avoided at
all costs]{.underline}, and the management of the superpower arms race
was a sort of via media between these two Manichean visions.
Parenthetically, [[some]{.underline}]{.mark} prominent
[[advocates]{.underline}]{.mark}, such as Robert McNamara, or President
Barack Obama, who have argued prominently for the complete abolition of
nuclear weapons[, [claim]{.mark}]{.underline} implicitly or explicitly
that **[[there is a seamless conceptual thread]{.underline}]{.mark}**
that [goes [from arms control to]{.underline}]{.mark} nuclear
[[disarm]{.underline}]{.mark}ament, and that [all that distinguishes one
from the other is the relative time horizon]{.underline} or degree of
pragmatism of the advocates.26 But [[this is both **conceptually and
practically unlikely**]{.underline}]{.mark} -- **[[if arms
control]{.underline}]{.mark}** [[is a set of techno-managerial
practices]{.underline}]{.mark} fully [[integrated
into]{.underline}]{.mark} the [[Cold War logic]{.underline}]{.mark} of
national security strategy, **[[then it is unable to make the leap to
disarmament]{.underline}]{.mark}** -- [which involves an **entirely
different idea** about the place of violence in social and political
life]{.underline}. [Recent debates]{.underline} [around]{.underline} the
ratification of the [New START]{.underline} treaty in late 2010
[illustrated]{.underline} how it hardly represented a step towards
deeper nuclear reductions. [[The third core element of the arms control
paradigm was that]{.underline}]{.mark} [the Weberian state's monopoly
over]{.underline} the use of [lethal force could not only be
used]{.underline} to impose order [domestically]{.underline} and to
create social peace but that **[[it could also be projected
outwards]{.underline}]{.mark}** [[to create a form of international
order that]{.mark} reduced the risk of violence]{.underline}. Just [as
the domestic form]{.underline} of the Weberian monopoly [[renders the
population]{.mark} vulnerable to the predatory state]{.underline} (so
much so that scholars such as Rudolph Rummel could argue that democide
-- state-sanctioned killing of citizens -- was a greater risk than
war);27 [the international form also involved rendering entire
populations **[totally vulnerable to nuclear
holocaust]{.mark}.**]{.underline} [[In the name of]{.mark} national
[security **the very survival of the entire population** could be put at
risk]{.mark}]{.underline}, through policies such as Mutual Assured
Destruction or treaties such as the Anti-Ballistic Missile (ABM) treaty.
**[It is difficult to find a better example of techno-managerial logic,
instrumental rationality and the assertion of sovereign power at
work.]{.underline}** Although perhaps an extreme example, this [faith in
the ability of states to exercise restraint]{.underline} over the use of
force, also [underlay the entire edifice of nuclear deterrence
policy]{.underline} and strategy. [The final element]{.underline} was
that the [arms control]{.underline} paradigm, like the much older
balance of power system, [was not a mechanism for maintaining order that
eliminated war]{.underline} or the use of force from the international
system. [It assumed that the main risk to be prevented was that of
large-scale]{.underline} inter-state [war]{.underline} between great
powers or the superpowers, [and that a trade-off between this
risk,]{.underline} [and the risk of]{.underline} (or fact of)
[small]{.underline} and large [wars,]{.underline} especially **[in the
postcolonial world, was an acceptable one]{.underline}**. The use of
violence was either to be part of the logic of so-called limited
(nuclear) war or to be confined to the periphery, to such places as
Indochina, Angola, and Afghanistan (although this was hardly peripheral
to the Soviet Union). This was analogous to the operation of the 19th
century balance of power system, which sanctioned the partitions of
Poland, the Crimean War, and so forth in the name of maintaining
systemic stability. Similarly, the logic of limited nuclear war, as
presented by scholars such as Henry Kissinger, rested upon the
assumption that the use of force could be carefully calibrated and
controlled.28 [[The neo-colonialist]{.underline}]{.mark} and political
[[implications of pushing]{.underline}]{.mark} the problem of [[war to
the periphery are of course clear]{.underline}]{.mark}, and one could
argue that the [[arms control]{.underline}]{.mark} paradigm sketched
above, especially the treaties that stabilized the nuclear confrontation
between East and West (SALT I and II), [[made certain kinds of proxy
wars more possible]{.underline}]{.mark} or acceptable [[by creating
escalatory fire-breaks]{.underline}]{.mark} that facilitated the
relatively risk-free provision of military assistance to client states
and movements. These fire breaks were easier to create in the global
South, where American and Russian troops managed to avoid confronting
each other directly, but less easy to create in Europe. The history of
attempts to achieve mutual and balanced force reductions (the 1975 name
for what in the late 1980s became the Conventional Forces in Europe (CFE
Treaty), and of debates over the necessity for intermediate range and
tactical nuclear weapons in Europe, and the problem of extended
deterrence (or the nuclear umbrella) all point towards a set of tensions
or contradictions within the logic of arms control. (23-6)

#### Masculinized IR is the root cause of war

**Hutchings 08**

Kimberly is a Professor at the London School of Economics, Men and
Masculinities Vol 10 No 4, "Making Sense of Masculinity and War," p.
Ebsco

In this article, my interest is not in a first-order investigation of
the relation between war and masculinity, but rather in the ways in
which this relation is construed in two different modes of theorizing
about war in the study of international relations. The first mode of
theorizing is to be found in scholarship explicitly concerned with
gender and war; the second is located in accounts and explanations of
the changing nature of war, in particular, in advanced industrial
societies. I will argue that [the link between masculinity and war made
in both these literatures has nothing to do with the substantive meaning
of either masculinity or war]{.underline}, or with a straightforward
causal or constitutive relation between the two; rather, [war is linked
to masculinity because the formal, [relational properties of
masculinity]{.mark} as a concept [provide a framework through which war
can be rendered]{.mark} both [intelligible and acceptable]{.mark} as a
social practice and institution.]{.underline} In the first part of the
article, I examine the gender and war literature. As we will see,
accounts of the masculinity--war relation in theories of gender and war
differ in many respects. However, I will argue that they also have
something in common. In each case, the necessity of the war--masculinity
relation is grounded, even if only contextually, in a set of substantial
commonalities. For instance, [qualities such as [aggression,
rationality]{.mark}, or [physical courage are identified]{.mark} both
[as]{.mark} an [essential]{.mark} component [of war and]{.mark} also of
[masculinity]{.mark} at a given place or time]{.underline}. Yet, at the
same time, the war and gender literature has increasingly made clear
that the meaning of masculinity in relation to war shifts across a
continuum of varied and sometimes mutually contradictory values.
Moreover, [recent work]{.underline} in both feminist and masculinity
studies literatures [has shown how [privileged versions]{.mark} of
masculinity [feed off contrasts]{.mark} both [with alternative
masculinities and with a]{.mark}n oppositional, [feminized
"other]{.mark}."]{.underline} In contrast to this, [the meaning of war
in the gender and war literature is treated as settled and
straightforward since [war is usually understood in]{.mark} traditional,
[Clausewitzian terms]{.mark}]{.underline}. I will argue that two ways of
understanding the war--masculinity relation are opened up by the gender
and war literature. The first directs us to the way in which war plays a
special role in anchoring the concept of masculinity, providing a fixed
reference point for any negotiation or renegotiation of what masculinity
or, in particular, hegemonic masculinity may mean. This way of
understanding reinforces the common-sense status of assumptions about
the material necessity of the relation between war and masculinity and
can work to block a full appreciation of quite how the war--masculinity
relation works, not only as a given social reality, but also as a
framework for thought. The second way of understanding the
war--masculinity relation focuses less on the substantive
characteristics of either masculinity or war and more on the work done
by the formal, relational properties of masculinity as a concept. [This
latter way of thinking enables more radical questions to be asked, not
only about]{.underline} causal or conditional [connections between war
and masculinity, but also about the grip exerted by the idea of those
connections on our social scientific imagination]{.underline}. In the
second part of the article, I explore some influential accounts of how
war has changed or is changing. In different ways, all these accounts of
the changing nature of modern warfare disrupt the substantive grounds on
which the war--masculinity link has been made in both traditional war
studies accounts and in the gender and war literature. Nevertheless, in
spite of this, I will argue that in each case, we find a reinvention of
that link as the medium through which the different authors both make
sense of and evaluate what they see. In this case, we can see how
masculinity provides an interpretive reference point for the description
and evaluation of contemporary developments in warfare. Even though
gender is not the primary concern of any of these thinkers, their
argument can be analyzed as a renegotiation of the meaning of hegemonic
masculinity in relation to war, as a way of making sense of the way in
which war is changing. However, we also see that the role of masculinity
in these arguments is not tied to any fixed content. Instead, it is the
formal properties of masculinity as a relational concept, drawing its
meaning from a logic of contrast (between different masculinities) and a
logic of contradiction (between masculinity and femininity),that enable
it to act as a prism through which to see, and make sense of, war. I
will conclude that the implication of the argument concerning
masculinity in both gender and war and war studies literatures is that
we need to look more closely at the formal properties that enable the
concept of masculinity to make war intelligible,both analytically and
normatively, regardless of the ways in which war may be changing. The
overwhelming message of existing scholarship on war and gender is that
[[masculinity is crucial to the ways in which war gains its meaning and
legitimacy in social life]{.underline}]{.mark}. This idea has even
gained recognition in the international policy community, which has
recently begun to take on board the view that masculinity can be seen as
a significant explanatory variable in political violence and therefore
as a problem that needs to be addressed by institutional actors seeking
to limit levels of political violence in the twenty-first-century world
(Breines, Connell, and Eide 2000). These arguments suggest that the
relation between masculinity and war is in some sense either causal or
constitutive, though different authors differ about how precisely the
relation works. [On some accounts, masculinity figures as the key
underlying cause of war]{.underline} (Hartsock 1989); [on other
accounts, it is the social practice of war that requires the production
and reproduction of masculine men]{.underline} (Goldstein 2001).
Alternatively, scholars may see the relation as mutually constitutive
and mutually reinforcing, with masculinity acting as an enabling
condition of war, and vice versa (Elshtain 1995; Enloe 2000; Barrett
2001). These differences reflect differences in the accounts of gender
on which scholars of gender and war rely. For some scholars, the
war--masculinity relation is grounded in underlying structures of
gendered psychic formation that explain sexual difference (Hartsock
1989). For others, gender is a socially constructed reflection of the
functional needs of societies, which include the need to make war
(Goldstein 2001). For others, the relation between gender and war is
discursively, rather than materially, produced or caused (Elshtain 1995;
Barrett 2001). A variety of feminist theorists in the 1980s focused
their attention on how both [the [practice and legitimization]{.mark} of
war]{.underline} (for both men and women) [[depended on and reinforced a
clear and hierarchical distinction between masculinity and
femininity]{.underline}]{.mark}. Although much of this feminist work was
primarily concerned with exploring the consequences of this for the role
of women and the feminine in relation to war, feminist attention also
focused specifically on the role of men and masculinity in war.3Hartsock
(1989) argued that the [[ideology of masculinity]{.underline}]{.mark},
which, she claimed, [reflected the interests of particular elite groups
of men across time, [was the **root cause of war and militarism in
Western cultures**]{.mark}]{.underline}. Cohn (1989) demonstrated the
ways in which [an association with masculine qualities permeated the
discourse of nuclear defense intellectuals and enabled them to give
meaning and value to their work.]{.underline} In her book Women and War,
Elshtain (1995) demonstrated how [[discourses of]{.underline}]{.mark}
patriotism and [[just war are]{.mark} fundamentally [gendered masculine
and reflect and reinforce a sexual division of labor in war as well as
providing resources]{.mark} to legitimate war.]{.underline} In all these
arguments, the link between masculinity and war lies in shared norms.
The standards that govern the being and conduct of men overlap with the
standards that govern the being and conduct of war makers, from foot
soldiers to weapons experts to generals and political leaders. At the
same time, however, this picture is complicated by the fact that the
[norms of masculinity]{.underline} are variable and [enforce not
only]{.underline} hierarchical [distinctions between men and women, but
also between different men. The [highly rational, technologically
skilled nuclear intellectual]{.mark}]{.underline} []{.mark}(unemotional,
rational, calculating) discussed by Cohn (1989) [[is]{.mark} a very
[different]{.mark} archetype [from the "just
warrior"]{.mark}]{.underline} (chivalrous, protective) presented in
Elshtain's (1995) work, and again different from the heroic figure
(courageous, strong, death defying) in Hartsock's (1989) account. [The
continuum of masculine qualities appears]{.underline} not only [to be
flexible]{.underline}, but also to contain significant tensions between
different elements (e.g., risk taking and rationality or discipline).
This permits distinctions between different, more or less adequate
grades of masculinity, in addition to the possibility of failed or
deviant modes. In more recent feminist work on gender and war, this
complexity of the relation between masculinity and war is acknowledged
(Enloe 2000; Cockburn and Zarkov 2002; Cohn and Enloe 2003). Thinkers
such as Enloe (2000; Cohn and Enloe 2003) repeatedly make the point that
masculinity in the context of the military operates as a kind of
intersection of hierarchies, in which a dominant hierarchical
distinction between masculine and feminine sustains other hierarchies
within and between men and women in different categories of military
life. Enloe's analysis can be distinguished from earlier feminist
arguments that treated masculinity as a much more homogenous concept
(e.g., Hartsock 1989). Nevertheless, it continues to point to the
mutually reinforcing relation between masculinity and war and the links
between ideals of masculinity and exemplary or necessary military
virtues or qualities. One of the ways in which recent feminist work on
gender and war has tried to reconcile recognition of the complexity of
masculinity with its significance for war is through using the notion of
hegemonic masculinity, pioneered in the work of Connell (1995; Cockburn
and Zarkov 2002; Whitworth 2004):4 The term "[hegemonic masculinity"
refers to a particular idealized image of masculinity in relation to
which images of femininity and other masculinities are marginalized and
subordinated.]{.underline} The hegemonic ideal of masculinity in current
Western culture is a man who is independent, risk-taking, aggressive,
heterosexual and rational. (Barrett 2001,79) Barrett's definition of
hegemonic masculinity, which builds on the work of Connell (1995),
appears in the context of an article titled "The Organizational
Construction of Hegemonic Masculinity: The Case of the US Navy." In this
article, [Barrett]{.underline} (2001) [shows how the association of
qualities and attributes with masculinity valorizes those attributes
(and thereby devalorizes others) and how [this process of valorization
helps to construct and sustain the skills needed to fulfill various
tasks within the organization]{.mark}]{.underline}. The article is a
useful demonstration of how the notion of hegemonic masculinity gives
purchase to the analysis of military culture because of the way that
that culture depends on subtle and not so subtle distinctions between
different ways of doing masculinity as well as on a value system in
which the denigrated feminine other (represented by homosexual men and
women) plays a crucial role. Barrett traces the complex ways in which
the hierarchy between different forms of masculinity plays off the
hierarchy between masculine and feminine. Players of all the roles in
the navy identify with the idea of hegemonic masculinity but are able to
differentiate themselves from others by associating other roles with the
less than masculine. This is done partly through the differentiation of
elements of hegemonic masculinity, which are then hierarchically ordered
(e.g., "risk taking" being given priority over "rational," or vice
versa). Barrett is insistent that the gendered value system that
sustains naval hierarchy is not a straightforward reflection of an
existing gender order but rather is constructed through a complex
process of training of different ranks, formally and informally. We see
hegemonic masculinity here as a form of disciplinary power through which
subjects are produced, one that feeds off but also reworks existing
assumptions about gender and values and one that is very hard to counter
within military culture. [Barrett]{.underline}'s (2001) argument
exemplifies a range of work that uses the idea of hegemonic masculinity
in relation to the understanding of war and [makes a powerful case for
the military as the exemplary context in which hegemonic masculinity
matters]{.underline} (Enloe 2000; Cockburn and Zarkov 2002; Cohn and
Enloe 2003). As with the work of a range of feminist writers, Barrett's
argument operates at two different levels. On one hand, [Barrett draws
attention to the match between the characteristics of hegemonic
masculinity and the functional requirements of a military
machine]{.underline}. On the other hand, Barrett demonstrates how the
[inculcation of these characteristics draws on the capacity of the idea
of masculinity to embed hierarchies of value in the attitudes of the
naval officers themselves]{.underline}. There is, however, a tension
between these levels of argument, which works through the gender and war
literature but is rarely explicitly acknowledged. This is a tension
between a causal or conditional argument (in which masculinity is
materially necessary to war because of what war is taken for granted to
be) and an argument in which it is the formal, relational properties of
the concept of masculinity that render war both intelligible and
acceptable. In the former case, war anchors masculinity, in the sense
that the meaning of masculinity reflects the requirements of war. In the
latter case, masculinity anchors war, in the sense that it provides a
framework through which war may be recognized, understood, and judged.
These arguments are in tension not because it is impossible for both to
be true, but because the former argument tends to reify the meanings of
both masculinity and war, whereas the latter argument requires a much
greater openness and flexibility in how the concept of masculinity is
thought and renders its relation with war contingent, rather than
necessary.

#### Challenges to militarism requires a shift in terminology---[ONLY]{.underline} situating feminism within the broader challenge to militarism solves

First is to defend the use of the concept at all. According to Mary
Kaldor, [[the concept of militarism has outlived its usefulness]{.mark}
as it is 'drawn from the Cold War and before'**: [the changes with the
end of the Cold War necessitate new terms]{.mark}.**]{.underline}56
[[To]{.mark} [capture the ways that organised violence blurs
state/non-state and national/foreign boundaries]{.mark}]{.underline},
whether in the form of paramilitary groups, organised crime or terrorist
cells, or in the form of peacekeeping troops, Kaldor coins the terms
'Netforce' and 'Protectionforce' respectively.57 Kaldor restricts the
concept of militarism to 'the new American militarism' and the
'neo-modern militarism' ('the evolution of classical military forces in
large transition states' practising inter-state war or
counterinsurgency) of states such as Russia, China, and India.58 [But in
differentiating some types of organised violence as
not-militarism]{.underline}, [we lose the opportunity to compare them,
to see the overlaps, similarities, and differences in modes of organised
violence]{.underline}. [[Feminists have long been able to capture
this]{.mark} with the concept of militarism, [showing]{.mark} us t[hat
**'it is not quite so easy to set aside "ordinary"
aggression**]{.mark}**, force or violence** [as "not war]{.mark}"'59 --
es[pecially when we pay attention to **the experience of violence in the
global South**]{.mark}]{.underline}.60

Second, and relatedly, the specificities of combinations of actors,
degrees of state support, and so on, are subject to empirical and
historical specificity, and a common rubric of militarism helps us
understand similarities and differences between them. Working in a
historical sociological tradition, Bryan Mabee and Srdjan Vucetic draw
up a typology of forms of contemporary militarism.61 They contrast
Michael Mann's concept of civil society militarism -- 'the use of
organized military violence in pursuit of social goals that is
"state-supported, but not state-led"'62 -- to 'nation-state militarism'
in both its authoritarian and liberal forms; to 'neoliberal militarism'
structured around socioeconomic liberalisation; and to 'exceptionalist
militarism' seen in practices associated with the War on Terror.
[[Feminists tend not to operate in such formal typological ways]{.mark},
[but have long been articulating the idea of war and militarism as a
spectrum]{.mark} or a system, in which the forms, intensities, and
characteristics may vary[, but the **gendered basis of violence is
central**]{.mark}]{.underline}.[63 And [a focus on militarism can be
usefully mobilised to consider the connections and feedback
loops]{.mark} between Northern and Southern practices, giving a more
internationalised account that is better attuned to the operation of
power in contexts of armed violence]{.underline}. Indeed, Rita
Abrahamsen refers to 'global militarism in Africa' because '**[while
militarism is always specific (and often national), it is also
simultaneously global']{.underline}**, and the'analytical challenge is
to capture at one and the same time the global and the local, and their
intersection in particular locations'.64

[**[Reading gender into (in)security and militarization is]{.mark}**
particularly **[important]{.mark}** [for understanding]{.mark} the ways
men, women, masculinities, and femininities have been constructed in
[dominant discourses of militarism]{.mark} [in terms of enacting
war]{.mark}. It]{.underline} [also illuminates the roles played by
various categories of men and women (physically, symbolically, and
ideologically) in supporting and challenging war and
militarism]{.underline}. As discussed earlier in the chapter, there is a
commonly held assumption that men have an innate predisposition to war.
Feminists have challenged the essentialism of this view and have shown
that many men in various contexts have either been against war or have
tried to avoid being participants in it. For example, men have avoided
conscription and have been involved in protesting against war
(Ehrenreich 1999). Ehrenreich argues that individual impulses of men or
aggressive male instincts do not lead to the complicated, orchestrated,
highly organized undertaking of war. She posits instead that "no
plausible instinct would impel a man to leave his home, cut his hair
short, and drill for hours under the hot sun" [(]{.underline}Ehrenreich
1999). Moreover, "it is a large step from ... biologically innate
leanings toward individual aggression, to ritualized, socially
sanctioned, institutionalized group warfare" (Kroeber and Fontana, cited
in Ehrenreich 1999, 118).

In addition, war would not be possible without women's cooperation,
support, and co-optation (Enloe 1989; Pettman 1996). Although they are
not always willing collaborators, women and the dominant notions of
femininity that are attached to them in hegemonic gender discourses,
support militarism through their performance of specific gendered roles.
[Women's performances of acceptable femininity become relegated to
supportive roles, which are not always invisible or
passive.]{.underline} Women have played a range of roles in the
practices and processes of militarism in complex and historically
contingent ways. They have supported masculine militarism in a material
sense by providing services to men and the military, stepping into
traditionally masculine arenas and roles when men are at war, as
military personnel and as citizens who provide the votes and tax revenue
necessary for war (Pettman 1996, 91--96).

Women and femininities also play an important role in service of
ideological campaigns during times of war. Women have been held up as
symbols of motherhood during times of war and in its aftermath[. In
various historical contexts, women's belonging to the nation has been
constructed around a duty toward the state in sacrificing their sons for
the good of the nation and providing future soldiers (Steans 2008,
171).]{.underline} In the recent past, the ethnic conflicts in the
former Yugoslavia (circa 1991--1999) involved the mobilization of
motherhood as symbolic of the nation. In the postwar period[, motherhood
has remained attached to women and has become a security
strategy.]{.underline} Performance of acceptable femininity is linked to
the willingness to become a mother. In Serbia, motherhood has become
part of the security discourse, as the ability of the nation to defend
itself is portrayed as being dependent on ensuring a rising birth rate
(Bracewell 1996).

[The U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates [instigated the
W]{.underline}ar [o]{.underline}n [T]{.underline}error (with the United
Kingdom joining as a key ally) [in response to the September
11]{.underline}, 2001, al-Qaeda attacks on US soil. **[It illustrates
the intersection of gender and race in making war within the logic of
militarism]{.underline}**. [[The construction of the world post-9/11 in
dominant political and academic discourses has taken for
granted]{.underline}]{.mark} (and in some cases has purposefully
deployed) [[assumptions about the naturalness of binaries of gender and
race]{.underline}]{.mark}, **[[particularly via
orientalism]{.underline}]{.mark}**. This [discourse of gendered
racialization **constructs** an Arab and Muslim as being of the East
**in opposition** to the West]{.underline}. A contemporary example is
Samuel Huntington's (1996) clash of civilizations thesis, which posits
that distinct cultural boundaries are the fault lines of global
conflict, and in particular, a long-standing conflict between the West
and the Arab or Muslim Other. In official US government administration
and mainstream media discourses in Western states (e.g., CNN, Fox News,
NBC, and popular news magazines such as Newsweek and Time), gendered and
orientalized representations of the Eastern Other were deployed to
facilitate military interventions as part of the War on Terror (Cloud
2004; Stabile and Kumar 2005).

The official discourse by the US administration constructed the War on
Terror as necessary to combat future threats of terrorism (defined
broadly but in practice limited to Islamist violence aimed at Western
targets and interests). During the course of the War on Terror, [[a
range of binaries situated the West in]{.mark} [opposition to the
East]{.mark}.]{.underline} For example, good versus evil, civilized
versus barbaric, [[rational versus irrational, and progressive versus
backward were invoked to construct the attacks,]{.mark}]{.underline} the
configuration of the world after these attacks, and the characteristics
of various peoples and groups. The deployment of masculinities and
femininities in and beyond the context of military interventions under
the War on Terror were instrumental in making the US military
interventions into Afghanistan and Iraq possible---and even necessary.

Thus, [[the War on Terror represents a discourse informed by
gender]{.mark}]{.underline} and race (specifically, orientalist
racialization) and illustrates the complex roles of men, women,
masculinities, femininities, and feminisms in militarism and war.
[[The]{.mark} War on Terror discourse has been constructed around a
dichotomy between the civilized, moral, and [benevolent]{.mark}
masculinity of the [West and the **barbaric**, **backward**,
**oppressive**, and **deviant** masculinity of the "brown man"]{.mark}
as well as the free, Western woman and the oppressed, subjugated "brown
woman"]{.underline} (Nayak 2006; Khalid 2011). These hierarchical
categorizations reflect what has been described earlier in the chapter
as a militarist concern with competing masculinities. A rational,
assertive masculinity was harnessed in official US and mainstream media
texts. This has been central to constructing the authority of the George
W. Bush administration in War on Terror discourse, with a concern for
security centered on the competing masculinities embodied in and
performed by us and them (Tickner 2002; Ferguson 2005; Shepherd 2006).

In this discourse, [[the]{.underline}]{.mark} [[U]{.mark}nited
[S]{.mark}tates [and its allies performed an acceptable masculine
function as defenders of civilization and liberators of the
oppressed]{.mark}]{.underline}. [The male enemy, [the Other, embodied a
barbaric masculinity expressed through irrational violence and
misogyny]{.mark}.]{.underline} A dual role was played by women in this
discourse, both as visible symbols of our success in achieving female
liberation (symbolizing Western civilization) and as potential victims
of the uncontrolled male other. This is exemplified in the US rescue of
Jessica Lynch in the war in Iraq, in which the image of a young white
female American soldier became symbolic of the egalitarian nature of the
US self, as a place of civilized values. Lynch, as a solider captured by
Iraqi forces, also functioned as a symbol of US masculine power against
the barbaric uncontrolled masculinity of the Other, who posed a threat
to our women (Kumar 2004; Pin-Fat and Stern 2005).

Not only were feminist language and concerns deployed in the discourse,
but some American feminists also colluded with the US administration.
Most notably, the prominent liberal US-based feminist organization
Feminist Majority Foundation (FMF) did not condemn the possibility of a
US-led war in Afghanistan insofar as it would (it was claimed) liberate
Afghan women. While the FMF has a long tradition of campaigning against
gender-based violence, including in Afghanistan, its support for the
2001 US-led war in Afghanistan reflected an orientalist belief that
women's liberation through war was worthwhile despite the devastating
effects it would have on Afghans, particularly women and children. As
the FMF's concern for the welfare of women in Taliban-ruled Afghanistan
aligned with the Bush administration's rhetoric of (female) liberation,
women's rights discourses became co-opted into a broader discourse of
gendered orientalism that constructed other women as voiceless victims
of a barbaric (Other, male) enemy (Khalid 2011).

Thus, the political and media discourse (including the FMF's statements)
that drew on feminist concerns and used feminist language functioned to
make more plausible the liberationist goal of the War on Terror by
reinforcing the construction of us as progressive and enlightened and
them as backward and barbaric. The mainstream media and some liberal
feminist arguments enabled the Bush administration to more convincingly
present itself as bringing women's rights to the backward East. The
United States, in contrast, was positioned as enlightened, civilized,
and justified in pursuing military interventions (Russo 2006; Khalid
2011). [[Dominant discourses not only harnessed anxieties around]{.mark}
the masculinity of the United States after the [9/11]{.mark} attacks (as
war serves as a means of reasserting masculinity) [but also attempted to
camouflage the patriarchal and militarized masculinity operating in
Feminist perspectives on militarism and war the push to
war]{.mark}.]{.underline} Co-opting the language of feminism and women's
rights was vital to the success of the militarist project. [As Enloe
argues, [patriarchy]{.mark} (which underscores militarism) "[has
survived because of its facile adaptiveness]{.mark}, not because of its
rigidity" (2000, 285).]{.underline}

However, other feminists argued that war (whether in Iraq, Afghanistan,
or elsewhere) does not empower women, as its architects claim. Feminist
activists and scholars agitated against the 2003 US-led war against
Iraq. Code Pink: Women for Peace was one of the most prominent of these
movements (Cockburn 2007: 65). Code Pink is a nongovernmental
organization that describes itself as a "grassroots peace and social
justice movement working to end US-funded wars and occupations, to
challenge militarism globally, and to redirect our resources into health
care, education, green jobs and other life-affirming activities"
(CodePink, n. d.).

War and militarism are often considered to be the domain of those men
who are involved in the military and elite politics. However, feminist
analyses have shown that the practice and impact of militarism is much
more ubiquitous, operating far beyond these realms into the everyday.
[[Militarism affects all facets of life]{.mark}, engaging various groups
of men, women, and children [in either knowing or unintentional support
of its values and activities]{.mark}]{.underline}.

[[Gender]{.mark}, as a hierarchical configuration of various expressions
and performances of masculinity and femininity, [shapes ideas of war,
peace, and (in)security and is central to understanding the ways
militarism and military conflicts are enabled]{.mark} and played
out]{.underline}. Gender is also configured through war and militarism,
in that men and women are created through the military and militarism
and through prescriptions of acceptable behavior and punishment for
deviancy. As such, militarism institutionalizes sexual differentiation
and produces and reproduces not only masculinity but also femininity
(Eisenstein 2008, 35). In societies [characterized by patriarchal gender
regimes, [masculinity is associated with authority,]{.mark} coercion,
[and violence that]{.mark}, supported by subordinate femininity, [are
both essential to militarism and dependent on militarism and war]{.mark}
[for its (re)production]{.mark} (Cockburn 2010, 152).]{.underline} [The
violence of war... produces re-burnished ethnic identities, sharpened by
memories of wrong and a desire for revenge.]{.underline} It produces
particular gender identities---armed masculinities, demoralized and
angry men, victimized femininities, types of momentarily empowered
women. But these war-honed gender relations, "after war" (which may
always equally be "before war"), again tend to feed back perennially
into the spiralling continuum of armed conflict, for ever predisposing a
society to violence, forever disturbing the peace. (Cockburn, 2010, 152)

[[Feminist research on militarism has made significant
progress]{.underline}]{.mark} in destabilizing the basic assumptions of
militarist ideology and processes, **[[but there still remains much to
be done]{.underline}]{.mark}**. For example, standpoint feminists have
illuminated the alternatives to masculine militarism in terms of
highlighting how characteristics not typically associated with
masculinity (e.g., nurturing, compassion, and nonviolence) can be useful
in world politics. [[Poststructuralist feminist understandings]{.mark}
of war, peace, and militarism [grapple with]{.mark} the ways these
[characteristics]{.mark} are [attached to sexed bodies]{.mark}
(masculine with men, feminine with women) [and interrogate the assumed
naturalness of these]{.mark}. **[By doing so]{.mark}**, **[the gender
dimensions of the institutions of militarism can be
challenged]{.mark}**.]{.underline} For example, the presence of women in
combat roles and high positions within the military may be seen as a
sign of gender equality and an avenue through which to impart feminine
characteristics' to a male-dominated institution. However, the
increasing number of women in the military has not led to a rejection of
key assumptions or characteristics of masculine militarism. Rather,
women's roles in the military are still linked to the feminine and
function to support the masculinity of the state and its militarism, as
illustrated by Jessica Lynch's rescue.

The unnamed norm in mainstream discussions of war and peace remains
masculinity. It is only when the privileging of masculinity at the very
heart of (mainstream) research and social organization (both domestic
and international) is interrogated that the ideational and material
expressions of militarism can be challenged. There is also a need for
the intersection between gender and race to be addressed in
understanding how militarism is (re)produced and deployed, specifically
in justifying and enacting military operations. The military engagements
of the War on Terror illustrate that gendered and racialized
constructions of the world and the people in it are central to
militarism and have devastating material effects on those who are deemed
to be in need of (imperial) liberation by those who subscribe to
(masculinist) militarism. This expression of militarism also highlights
the ways some feminist activism and activists play a crucial role in
supporting militarism as much as others undermine it. It is vital to
understand the complexity of feminisms in relation to militarism.

[[Feminist approaches to research and activism provide **alternatives**
to the **dichotomies** that **shape dominant understandings** of]{.mark}
war, peace, and human [behavior in militarist
societies]{.mark}.]{.underline} Feminist scholarship, for example, has
illustrated the value of employing a dual focus, both interrogating
elite politics and recovering knowledge about the marginalized and
oppressed (often those who are deemed to be made secure through
militarism). In particular, **[[anti-imperialist feminist scholarship
can]{.underline}]{.mark}**, [as Russo (2006) explains, [help us to
resist hegemonic and imperialist power by **uncovering** the ways this
power operates so that we can disrupt rather than (re)produce relations
of imperialist domination]{.mark}. Employing a self-reflexive feminist
ethic can encourage us to be attentive to the ways our own privilege
shapes our approaches to conducting research (Ackerly and True
2008).]{.underline} Importantly, this feminist ethic and the research it
is used to produce are also helpful in shaping approaches to feminist
activism, by centralizing the importance of looking outside the contexts
of mainstream institutions and discourses, and recognizing the
complexities of addressing the multiple sites and intersectionalities of
gendered militarism.

#### Framing matters---challenging the justification for US militarized masculine protection shifts public discussion and opens space for reclaiming violent gendered discourses.

Administration", Politics & Gender (2005), 1:1:9-38 Cambridge University

I assume in this analysis that [how [issues of women\'s]{.mark} rights
and [equality are framed matters---and it matters even more when the
framing is being done by the spokespeople for the world\'s most]{.mark}
politically, economically, and [militarily dominant
state]{.mark}.]{.underline} [**[Rhetoric is never merely
rhetoric]{.mark}**; **[it constructs a particular]{.mark}** (if
incomplete) **[worldview]{.mark}** that enables us to see certain
connections, yet occludes others]{.underline}. Like a picture frame,
[[the rhetorical framing of political issues **shapes** and
**contextualizes** the perspective of the audience.]{.mark}]{.underline}
This idea of "framing" has been theoretically elaborated in a number of
disciplines, including sociology, psychology, and political science. 7
While scholars have not reached consensus about how precisely to define
the term, they converge on the basic idea that frames are conceptual
structures that enable us to make sense of information by selectively
presenting it from a particular viewpoint. This concept primarily has
been used to explain how journalists frame stories in mass communication
(Iyengar 1991) and how surveys frame questions in social science
research (Kahneman and Tversky 1984), although the concept broadly
understood has relevance to a variety of applications. For example,
Robert Entman describes framing as a feature of "a communicating text"
(1993, 52). This suggests that the analysis of framing may be helpful
for understanding speeches, protest signs, literature,
advertisements---in short, anything that we can characterize as a text.
The [[empirical literature]{.mark} on framing
[confirms]{.mark}]{.underline} my contention [[that **frames do
matter**]{.mark} because they affect audience perceptions]{.underline}.
8 However, this does not mean that when issues are presented to us in a
particular way, we simply adopt that perspective uncritically. Rather,
as researchers have noted, we respond to frames on the basis of our
existing perspectives. 9 Accordingly, we should not expect that the Bush
Administration, nor any other source of framing discourse, will succeed
at imposing a single perspective on its audience. Different people will
respond to the same framing rhetoric in different ways. 10 Drawing on
this work, I characterize frames as constructions that enable a
particular view of the world but do not guarantee that audience members
will adopt it. While to this extent I follow the general trends of the
literature, I also add to it an account of an aspect of framing that has
been largely undertheorized: its dialogicality. 11 [Rhetorical frames
are introduced into an existing discursive context in which other frames
are already operative]{.underline}. Like interlocutors in a dialogue
responding to what the other says and how it is said, [agents attempting
to frame an issue respond to the framing discourse that has preceded
them.]{.underline} This response is neither identical with nor wholly
unrelated to what has come before. Rather[, it makes use of and
redeploys existing modes of discourse]{.underline}. Indeed, even where a
frame is intended to construct an entirely new issue for an audience, it
is intelligible as a frame only insofar as it builds on narratives and
ideas already in currency. 12 We might think of this in terms of how
William Sewell has described human agency: as "the capacity to transpose
and extend schemas to new contexts" (1992, 18). In political discourse,
we use existing rhetorical frames, but we also transform them as we
apply them to different situations. 13 Furthermore, influential
[**[framing rhetoric]{.mark}** does more than just respond to what has
come before: It **also [shapes the discursive context to which future
actors will have to respond]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Clever framing
disarms opponents by making likely lines of attack seem illegitimate or
morally questionable. Consider how opposition to Senator Eugene
McCarthy\'s witch-hunt was immobilized for a long time by the rhetorical
threat of being named un-American. Or consider how opponents of abortion
reframed their position as pro-life, a frame which has the effect of
placing pro-choice activists on the moral defensive. [[Even the most
hegemonic of discourses never completely forecloses alternatives, but it
does help to shape the terrain for resistance]{.underline}]{.mark}.
Accordingly, attention to dialogicality shows that framing rhetoric does
work, not just by placing limits on how we view the world but also by
placing limits on how our interlocutors may respond to our worldview.
This dialogical understanding of frames can help us to analyze the Bush
Administration\'s feminized security rhetoric as a kind of political
action that aims to shape how Americans think about women\'s rights. It
accomplishes this by drawing on an already existing feminist rhetoric of
women\'s rights. However, I hypothesize that the Bush rhetoric on women
is not a straightforward repetition of feminist discourse (whether
cynical or sincere); rather, it represents a different way of framing
women\'s issues. We should not presume that just because this rhetoric
often sounds familiar, it is necessarily feminist. The Bush
Administration, as I argue here, makes use of existing discourses of
respect, democratic peace, and feminism; yet it alters each of these
discourses by combining them in novel ways and extending them to new
contexts. Accordingly, we should not assume that the administration\'s
use of the rhetoric of women\'s rights will look exactly like
preexisting modes of feminist discourse: We should expect to find
differences. However, many political actors might attempt to reframe
women\'s rights without achieving any results. What makes the Bush
Administration\'s rhetoric worthy of study is the likelihood that it has
had and will have significant influence over how women\'s rights and
equality are framed. This is likely since, at least within American
public discourse, the Bush Administration has enjoyed a kind of
hegemonic authority to set the terms for discussion of women\'s rights
and status---because of its access to media, political, and budgetary
resources. While this authority is not unchallenged, we can expect that
the executive branch has the opportunity to shape how many Americans
think about women\'s rights and feminist issues. 14 In particular, as a
right-wing administration with a reputation for social conservatism, the
current government may have the capacity to influence citizens who would
not give credence to arguments for women\'s rights coming from feminist
organizations or leftist politicians. While there is no reason to
suppose that the Bush Administration rhetoric will be uniformly
influential on Americans, there is reason to suppose that it can have
some effect on how many citizens view their world. The coalition behind
the Global Scorecard, for instance, has seemingly accepted this rhetoric
as feminist. When we examine the Bush Administration\'s
[**[words]{.mark}** from the perspective of framing]{.underline}, then
it is clear that these [**[are]{.mark}** not mere]{.underline}
[words]{.underline} but, rather, [[**a form of political action**---one
that aims to change **how we think about women\'s
rights**]{.mark}.]{.underline} Consequently, [separating criticism of
words from criticism of deeds]{.underline}, as many feminists have done,
[is an ineffective response]{.underline}. We need to reveal that [these
**[words are deeds]{.mark}**---that the Bush Administration is engaged
in the very political act of shifting the discursive terrain for
women\'s rights]{.underline}. As the official quoted at the beginning of
this section states, "we create our own reality." Insofar as this is the
reality in which feminists now find themselves, we need to analyze its
logic as fully as possible. Accordingly, in the remainder of this essay
I engage in interpretive analysis of the Bush Administration\'s
feminized security rhetoric in order 1) to reveal how it frames women\'s
rights, and frames them in a way that is different from what came
before; and 2) to contest it by identifying what kinds of responses it
renders ineffectual and what kinds it enables. Before turning to the
analysis of the Bush Administration\'s rhetoric, I should clarify the
methodology I have used to identify it. First, by the term "Bush
Administration" I mean to refer to a collection of individuals in
prominent positions in the executive branch under President George W.
Bush: These include Bush himself, First Lady Laura Bush, cabinet
members, and other top executive branch officials and political
advisers. I focus on the leadership because I assume that of all the
people working in the administration, these few will have the greatest
access to the media to convey their message, and they will be perceived
as the most authoritative by their audience. In short, I expect the
leadership of the administration to have the greatest influence on how
citizens frame their world. I take the statements of these officials as
indicative of the position of the administration as a whole. I do not
presume anything about the intentions of any particular individual,
about whether he or she is a sincere or cynical advocate of women\'s
rights. 15 I find it reasonable to suppose that most if not all public
comments made by these people have been approved as representing the
position of the administration: They are spokespeople for the
administration and so can reasonably be expected to be expressing a
somewhat coherent, consistent, and coordinated position on the
issues---regardless of their individual motives or beliefs about the
language they use. Indeed, the rhetorics used by these officials are
consistent enough that it is either extraordinary chance that they are
so coordinated or they really have intentionally coordinated with one
another. This feminized security rhetoric has become commonplace in the
administration, so much so that it is typical for an official who gives
a speech about American actions in Iraq and Afghanistan or about the
U.S. policy of promoting democracy around the world to draw the
connection to the pursuit of women\'s rights. Accordingly, I have
focused my attention here on speeches and other texts that are focused
on women\'s issues or that announced new policies or initiatives
regarding women. These include a variety of official and public
documents produced throughout Bush\'s first term in office, from both
before and after September 11, 2001. I have examined documents posted on
whitehouse.gov, the official White House Website (such as speeches by
the President and the First Lady, policy reports, and press briefings);
op-eds and other opinion pieces written by members of the Bush
Administration; interviews and quotations reproduced in the media; and
other policies and public speeches available from additional sources
(such as former UN Ambassador John Negroponte\'s speeches before the
Security Council). The majority of these texts are attributed to
President Bush, Laura Bush, or former Secretary of State Colin Powell.
The most surprising absence from these texts is Condoleezza Rice, who
served as National Security Adviser during Bush\'s first term in office.
As a woman in charge of national security, we might suppose her to be an
obvious choice to be a spokesperson for this rhetoric. However, where
she has talked about the relation of women\'s rights to national
security, it has been only as a passing reference in a speech focused on
some other matter (e.g., Rice 2002). She is often mentioned in speeches
as an example of the success of women\'s rights in the United States, 16
but she was never the one who introduced any new policies or initiatives
on women. Rather, Laura Bush is the woman who most frequently
represented the administration on women\'s issues. Rice\'s relative
silence about women may be due in part to her role as National Security
Adviser. For example, at the G-8 Summit in 2004, she attended the
meetings, while Laura Bush hosted a separate event about women\'s issues
for the other wives of world leaders (Rice 2004). However, having Laura
Bush be the primary female spokesperson for women\'s rights may also be
a strategic choice on the part of the administration. 17 Whereas Dr.
Rice is a single, childless, and ambitious career woman, Mrs. Bush is a
wife and mother who quit her job to raise her children. She has
evidenced no career aspirations at odds with those of her husband.
Through her role as First Lady acquired by virtue of her marriage to the
president, she literally embodies the notion that women\'s primary
identification should be with her family. Consequently, she seems
comparatively nonthreatening as an advocate of women\'s rights since her
personal choices to date seem to correspond with relatively traditional
gender roles. When I began to examine how the Bush Administration was
framing women\'s rights issues in relation to national security, I
realized that [[there is]{.mark} not one but [multiple rhetorical
strategies at work]{.mark}]{.underline}[.]{.mark} This is because Bush
and his spokespeople draw upon different preexisting discourses to
express a commitment to women\'s rights: [first, [a discourse of
chivalrous respect for women, which reinforces the administration\'s
contrast between the civilized world and the barbaric]{.mark} Taliban
and Hussein regimes]{.underline}; [[and second, a discourse of
democratic peace,]{.mark} which reflects the administration\'s policy of
seeking to build democracy]{.underline} in Iraq and Afghanistan. I
distinguish two different rhetorics, corresponding to these discursive
sources. While these rhetorics are often used separately, they are also
frequently deployed in the same speech or statement. Consequently, I
feel justified in treating them as if they are each different components
of the same overall framing strategy. [[These two]{.mark} rhetorics
share one very important feature in common: They both [position
Americans as superior]{.mark} to some particular others in terms of
their treatment of women]{.underline}; accordingly, [both rhetorics
motivate [and justify intervention]{.mark} in other countries [in the
name of women\'s rights]{.mark}.]{.underline} However, whereas the
rhetoric of democracy clearly positions women\'s rights as a national
security concern, the rhetoric of respect draws no similar connection.
This is significant because it means that, in the current political
climate in which national security is of prime importance, the rhetoric
of democracy is much more rhetorically powerful in making women\'s
rights a central (rather than a marginal) concern in U.S. foreign
policy. I treat each of these rhetorics in turn. The Rhetoric of Respect
Respect for women is a Bush Administration foreign policy priority.
---"U.S. International Women\'s Initiatives Fact Sheet," March 8, 2004
18 [There was little discussion of women\'s rights by the Bush
Administration before September 11]{.underline}. 19 Women\'s rights were
generally mentioned only on ceremonial occasions celebrating women
(e.g., G. W. Bush 2001e), they were usually mentioned by Laura Bush
rather than her husband, and they were mentioned as an achievement that
had successfully occurred in the past. 20 [[The primary message]{.mark}
of these early speeches [is that women\'s rights have already been
achieved in the U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates]{.underline}; [[gender
inequality no longer exists]{.underline}]{.mark}. Insofar as women\'s
rights are today only imperfectly enjoyed, this is simply a function of
a lack of enforcement of the existing laws. 21 No new laws, no new
rights are necessary. Consequently, the women\'s movement is always
referred to in the past tense---women struggled once upon a time for
their rights, and inequality is a matter of the past (G. W. Bush 2001e;
L. Bush 2001b). [Suffrage is an achievement that we should all be proud
of, [but there is no continuing need for women to organize and struggle
for rights]{.mark}---at least [in the U]{.mark}nited
[S]{.mark}tates]{.underline}. Indeed, reading through the statements by
the president and the First Lady during the first 233 days of the
administration, one might never know that the women\'s movement is still
quite active. Immediately after 9/11, this narrative of women\'s rights
as already achieved in the United States appears in Bush Administration
discourse in the context of a rhetoric of respect for women. Our respect
for women at home should motivate us to care about the status of women
abroad. 22 This rhetoric predates 9/11, but it does not seem to have
been explicitly connected with women\'s rights until afterward. 23 After
September 11, the recognition of women\'s rights is figured as a sign of
respect for women. [Civilized nations and civilized peoples respect
women, and therefore treat them with dignity and recognize their
righ]{.underline}ts. The United States clearly respects its women since
it has for almost a century now recognized women\'s rights.
[Afghanistan, by contrast, did not respect its women under Taliban
rule]{.underline}. [Accordingly, Afghanistan was uncivilized and needed
to be brought under control and domesticated]{.underline}. This
rhetorical strategy works, then, by redeploying an existing conservative
narrative of chivalry: [Those who respect their women are civilized;
those who do not are barbarians.]{.underline} 24 Laura Bush delivered a
key speech that connected this rhetoric of respect to U.S. national
security policy on November 17, 2001, in the first presidential radio
address to the nation delivered in full by a First Lady. 25 In her brief
speech, Bush catalogs the horrible acts committed or threatened by the
Taliban against Afghani women: "Women have been denied access to doctors
when they\'re sick. Life under the Taliban is so hard and repressive,
even small displays of joy are outlawed---children aren\'t allowed to
fly kites; their mothers face beatings for laughing out loud. Women
cannot work outside the home, or even leave their homes by themselves"
(2001a). Yet she is quick to tell us that this disrespect is a
characteristic of the Taliban regime in particular, not of Islam in
general, which we learn is a civilized religion that emphasizes respect
for women: "Only the terrorists and the Taliban forbid education to
women. Only the terrorists and the Taliban threaten to pull out women\'s
fingernails for wearing nail polish. The plight of women and children in
Afghanistan is a matter of deliberate human cruelty, carried out by
those who seek to intimidate and control" (2001a). The Taliban have
shown themselves to be uncivilized not only because they have harbored
terrorist organizations but also because they lack respect for women.
Listening to her speech, [we learn that we should therefore equate the
struggle for women\'s rights with the war on terror:]{.underline} "[The
fight against terrorism is also a fight for the rights and dignity of
women]{.underline}" (2001a). We are instructed by her model to feel a
kind of instinctual, natural outrage at the Taliban. This is what her
example of having one\'s fingernails pulled out does: It elicits a
visceral revulsion, a kind of Rousseauean pity at the pain of another.
26 We should do more than just feel outrage, however. We should also
speak out about it. We should speak out against the Taliban, which is to
say that we should speak out in support of the U.S. military action
against the Taliban. [This is what civilized people do: Like chivalrous
knights in shining armor, they rush to the aid of defenseless women and
children everywhere]{.underline}: "Civilized people throughout the world
are speaking out in horror---not only because our hearts break for the
women and children in Afghanistan, but also because in Afghanistan we
see the world the terrorists would like to impose on the rest of us. All
of us have an obligation to speak out" (L. Bush 2001a). Here the
language of respect enters the picture: "We respect our mothers, our
sisters and daughters. Fighting brutality against women and children is
not the expression of a specific culture; it is the acceptance of our
common humanity---a commitment shared by people of good will on every
continent" (L. Bush 2001a). Unlike the Taliban, we respect our mothers,
sisters, and daughters. This is a sign that we, unlike they, are
civilized people. [[This rhetoric]{.underline}]{.mark} obviously was
politically useful at the time; it helped to demonstrate that the Bush
Administration was not anti-Muslim, only antiterror; it also [[helped to
construct an image of a natural solidarity among "civilized
peoples"]{.mark} who ought to support a U.S.-led war on
terror]{.underline}. This language does so not only by drawing a
distinction between civilized and uncivilized people but also by calling
for a vague course of action: respect for women. Laura Bush does not
specify a catalog of rights that women do or should have; she simply
calls for respect. This is a language that is not threatening to those
U.S. allies who do not themselves fully recognize women\'s rights but
who do claim to respect women. 27 In other words, this language of
respect is only contingently connected to women\'s rights: There are
lots of ways to respect women, only some of which include recognizing
women as rights-bearing subjects. However, this language of respect is
also consistent with other ways of conceptualizing women. As I have been
suggesting, [Laura Bush invites us [to imagine ourselves as the
chivalrous masculine protectors who must defeat the misogynist
enemy]{.mark} and show Afghani women the respect that the Taliban
refuses them]{.underline}. [**Women are victims, vulnerable, in need of
masculinist protection**, here embodied in the figure of the United
States, which is willing to intervene and protect them from the
indignities suffered at the hands of the Taliban.]{.underline} 28 [Women
are identified with the family: They are mothers, sisters, and
daughters---rather than citizens.]{.underline} 29 They are conduits of
civilization and culture: The Taliban men are uncivilized, but there is
no corresponding concern that the Afghani women are also uncivilized.
Rather than being a radical rhetoric in unconditional support of
women\'s rights, [the rhetoric of respect is only contingently related
to rights, and it reinscribes traditional gender roles of chivalrous
male protectors rescuing female damsels-in-distress.]{.underline} Not
only is this rhetoric contingently connected to rights but it is also
only contingently connected to national security. In other words, in an
era immediately following 9/11 in which security concerns dominated and
legitimated all kinds of political programs, women\'s rights were being
framed in terms having little or nothing to do with security. We can see
this by looking at the September 2002 "National Security Strategy"---the
document that outlines the Bush doctrine of preemptive war. It contains
only three passing references to gender in 35 pages of text. 30 The most
important of these is found in a list of eight "nonnegotiable demands of
human dignity" that the United States must "champion": the rather
ambiguous demand of "respect for women" (2002, 3). Although respect for
women is nonnegotiable, it makes no other appearance in the document.
The message is that national security is not really related to respect
for women---or to women\'s rights---in any significant way. 31 The
failure of the Taliban to respect women simply demonstrates how
uncivilized they are; the Taliban do not pose any particular threat to
the United States on account of disrespecting women. The fight against
terrorism may also be a fight for the rights and dignity of women, but
according to the logic of this rhetoric, it is simply unclear whether
supporting women\'s rights would be an effective way to fight terrorism.
The Rhetoric of Democracy Ensuring women\'s rights benefits individuals
and their families, strengthens democracy, bolsters prosperity, enhances
human rights and advances religious tolerance. It is at the core of
building a civil, law-abiding society, which is an indispensable
prerequisite for true democracy. The advancement of issues of concern to
women has been a long-standing American goal. This administration has
intensified that pursuit. ---Under Secretary for Global Affairs Paula J.
Dobriansky 32 The connection between supporting women\'s rights and
achieving national security is made explicit in the second rhetoric: a
rhetoric that relates women\'s issues to the creation of stable
democracies around the world. The framing logic of this rhetoric differs
from that of respect in several important ways. First, whereas the
rhetoric of respect was only contingently connected to women\'s rights
and a conception of women as rights-bearing citizens, the rhetoric of
democracy is unmistakably a rhetoric of women\'s rights. Second, this
rhetoric ties women\'s rights directly to U.S. national security. This
has the effect of making women\'s rights an issue that (rhetorically, at
least) is central to U.S. foreign policy. This is the kind of language
that has earned the Bush Administration\'s rhetoric on Iraq and
Afghanistan good grades from feminist groups for over a year: it is a
rhetoric that takes women\'s rights seriously. As an example of this
rhetoric, consider an op-ed entitled "Women in the New Iraq." The
article was written by Deputy Secretary of Defense Paul Wolfowitz and
appeared in the Washington Post on February 1, 2004. [Wolfowitz begins
by discussing a new women\'s center in Iraq dedicated to women\'s
rights]{.underline}. [Soon,]{.underline} however, [he gets to his main
point: democracy]{.underline}. The women he met on his recent visit to
Iraq want to protect their rights. [Yet, by his account, these women
want their rights not so much for themselves but because they understand
that women\'s rights are necessary in order to create and maintain
democracy]{.underline} in Iraq, and in order to make the world as a
whole safer. While in Iraq, Wolfowitz met with a delegation of women
leaders, who "told us that if Iraq is to become a democracy, women must
have an equal role and more women should be included in Iraqi governing
bodies and ministries." 33 [These women have numerous concerns, among
them being a concern "that if women are not involved \[in drafting a new
constitution for Iraq\], women will not be guaranteed equality under the
law," but this concern is hardly the most important one for
Wolfowitz]{.underline}. [As he notes, "they also pointed out that we are
now engaged with Iraqis in seeking a far greater prize: a chance for
lasting change in the region that will help make our country and the
world safer.]{.underline}" 34 Wolfowitz clearly agrees with the logic of
this delegation as he reports it. [Women\'s rights are not to be
protected qua rights, but rather because they are an important indicator
of the democratization of a state]{.underline}: "A government that does
not respect the rights of half its citizens," Wolfowitz continues to
write in language that evokes feminists all the way back to Mary
Wollstonecraft, "cannot be trusted to safeguard the rights of any." [It
is because we need to be able to trust other governments to be
democratic]{.underline} (that is, to respect the rights of all of its
citizens) [that we need to make certain that they recognize women\'s
rights]{.underline}. This, he tells us, is the rationale for U.S. policy
and funding to support women\'s rights in Iraq. President Bush himself,
Wolfowitz reminds us, made the connection between women\'s rights and
Iraq policy clear in his State of the Union address in January 2004,
when he said that "our aim is 'a peace founded upon the dignity and
rights of every man and woman.' " 35 [We can now trace out the reasoning
that leads Wolfowitz to support women\'s rights in Iraq]{.underline}.
First, [it is essential to our national security that other countries
democratize]{.underline}. The peace that Bush refers to in the State of
the Union address is, as he himself notes, a democratic peace (G. W.
Bush 2004). In other words, the Bush Administration is appealing to a
long-standing view whose roots can be traced back to Immanuel Kant
(\[1795\] 1991) that democracies will not go to war against one another.
The presumption made by Wolfowitz and others is that only if countries
like Iraq are democratic can we expect that their leaders will not seek
to go to war with the United States and will not harbor terrorists.
Accordingly, the security of the United States requires the creation of
democracies to replace failed and dictatorial regimes around the world.
Second, Wolfowitz\'s argument rests on certain assumptions about what
counts as a democracy. Most importantly[, a democracy is a form of
government that respects the rights of all of its citizens---whether
male or female. Therefore, it is in the interests of U.S. national
security to support women\'s rights in Iraq in order to make sure that
the new Iraqi government is indeed a democratic one.]{.underline}
[Women\'s rights are then best understood as an instrumental
good]{.underline}, according to the logic of this rhetoric. They are
instrumental first in securing democracy: A state that recognizes
women\'s rights is a democratic state. In turn, then, women\'s rights
are instrumental in securing U.S. national security. Yet the rhetoric
often sounds more idealistic, as if Americans ought to be committed to
ensuring women\'s rights as a good in and of themselves. We can see this
when we look at the larger context of the quotation Wolfowitz takes from
the State of the Union address. Bush stated: "America is a nation with a
mission, and that mission comes from our most basic beliefs. We have no
desire to dominate, no ambitions of empire. Our aim is a democratic
peace---a peace founded upon the dignity and rights of every man and
woman. America acts in this cause with friends and allies at our side,
yet we understand our special calling: This great republic will lead the
cause of freedom" (G. W. Bush 2004). 36 Here, Bush speaks idealistically
of freedom and rights as if they are ends in themselves. Yet he
simultaneously reaffirms the realist premise that if rights are
important, it is because international peace requires the recognition of
rights: Even as Americans lead the cause of freedom, they do so with the
aim of creating a democratic peace. In fact, it is characteristic of
this rhetoric connecting women\'s rights to democracy that it conflates
idealist and realist positions on rights. Consider Laura Bush\'s remarks
on efforts to promote women\'s human rights globally on March 12, 2004:
"For a stable world, we must dedicate ourselves to protecting women\'s
rights in all countries. Farahnaz Nazir, founder of the Afghanistan
Women\'s Association, said, 'Society is like a bird. It has two wings.
And a bird cannot fly if one wing is broken.' Without women, the goals
of democracy and peace cannot be achieved. Women\'s rights are human
rights, and the work of advancing human rights is the responsibility of
all humanity" (G. W. Bush and L. Bush 2004). 37 Women\'s rights are
human rights---but we must dedicate ourselves to protecting them for a
stable world. The argument epitomized by Wolfowitz\'s op-ed is only one
version of the rhetoric of democracy. I have identified three different
arguments that connect women\'s rights to democratic peace, and it is in
these arguments that we can see the tremendous influence of feminist
activism on the Bush Administration. All three are present in the
quotation with which I began this section: "Ensuring women\'s rights
benefits individuals and their families, strengthens democracy, bolsters
prosperity, enhances human rights and advances religious tolerance." The
first argument is the Wolfowitz argument: Where women\'s political
rights to vote and participate in self-government are recognized, there
we can be assured is a democratic government. This claim is as old as
the movement for women\'s suffrage. The second line of argument takes
the recognition of women\'s rights---political, social, and
economic---to be necessary for sustainable prosperity. As George W. Bush
notes, "The economic empowerment of women is one effective way to
improve lives and to protect rights. Each year for the past five years,
the United States government has provided an average of \$155 million in
small loans, micro-loans. About 70 percent of those benefit women. It
turns out the world is learning what we know in America: The best
entrepreneurs in the country are women. In America, most new small
businesses are started by women. With the right help, that will be the
case around the world, as well" (G. W. Bush and L. Bush 2004). 38
Entrepreneurial women, in turn, are the sign of a free market economy,
which is itself taken as a stand-in for a democratic government. The
connection between women\'s enjoyment of their rights and general
prosperity---while it is not always linked to free market economics as
it is here---has been well established. 39 Indeed, feminist Katha
Pollitt makes a very similar argument in her criticisms of Bush\'s
policies. 40 The third line of argument is a bit more subtle. It
connects the recognition of women\'s rights to a secular society---which
in the context of Afghanistan and Iraq means a society governed by
secular rather than sharia law. Dobriansky suggests, for example, that
ensuring women\'s rights also ensures religious tolerance. The
institutionalization of women\'s rights is in direct contradiction with
the imposition of sharia law; therefore, the support of women\'s rights
and political participation is a way of supporting secular government,
government that tolerates a variety of religions. This, again, is a
claim made by feminist activists, Muslim and non-Muslim alike. In all
three of these logics, women\'s rights are taken to represent democracy:
whether these rights signal women\'s political participation, women\'s
social and economic participation, or the absence of sharia law. Indeed,
the Bush Administration goes so far to connect women\'s rights and
democracy that they are often treated in speech as if they were
synonymous: The one stands for the other. Speaking on global women\'s
human rights, George W. Bush tells us that "\[t\]he advance of women\'s
rights and the advance of liberty are ultimately inseparable" (G.W. Bush
and L. Bush 2004). And so, in his remarks, Bush slides back and forth
between talking about women\'s rights and talking about democracy, as if
he is always talking about the same thing. I quote from his speech at
length to show how he constantly shifts from women to democracy and vice
versa---as if they really were the same: By radio and television, we\'re
broadcasting the message of tolerance and truth in Arabic and Persian to
tens of millions of people. And our Middle East Partnership Initiative
supports economic and political and educational reform throughout the
region. We\'re building women\'s centers in Afghanistan and Iraq that
will offer job training and provide loans for small businesses and teach
women about their rights as citizens and human beings. We\'re active.
We\'re strong in the pursuit of freedom. We just don\'t talk a good game
in America \[sic\], we act. In Afghanistan, the U.S.-Afghan Women\'s
Council is developing projects to improve the education of women, and to
train the leaders of tomorrow. You heard Laura talk about her deep
desire to help train women to become teachers, not only in the cities,
but in the rural parts of Afghanistan. We\'ll succeed. We\'ll follow
through on that initiative. We\'re pursuing a forward strategy of
freedom---that\'s how I like to describe it, a forward strategy of
freedom in the Middle East. And I believe there\'s no doubt that if
America stays the course and we call upon others to stay the course,
liberty will arrive and the world will be better off. The momentum of
freedom in the Middle East is beginning to benefit women. That\'s
what\'s important for this conference. A free society is a society in
which women will benefit. (G. W. Bush and L. Bush 2004) What are the
rhetorical effects of equating democracy with women\'s rights in this
way? To begin with, [this way of framing women\'s rights has the effect
of occluding the fraught relationship between real democracies and
women\'s rights]{.underline}. [Even a cursory look at the history of
democracy shows that there is no necessary connection between democracy
and women\'s rights]{.underline}: [Most democracies have not recognized
women\'s rights, or at least have only partially done so]{.underline}.
Furthermore, [the elision of women\'s rights with democracies makes it
difficult to see any tension within contemporary states between the
realization of democracy and the realization of women\'s
rights.]{.underline} [Bush\'s words are also very
reassuring]{.underline} to Americans. His equation of women\'s rights
with democracy means that [if the United States has already successfully
achieved women\'s rights, then it must be a democracy; and if the United
States is a democracy, then it must already recognize women\'s
rights]{.underline}. He accomplishes this in his speech through a
variety of techniques. First, [he begins by showing his audience that
women are present in the highest levels of U.S. government]{.underline}.
He makes a point of introducing all of the female cabinet members, as
well as other women serving in the administration who are present at the
meeting. (Three of the women he mentions are his sister, Dick Cheney\'s
daughter, and Donald Rumsfeld\'s wife, all of whom hold their positions
arguably because of patronage and nepotism---but he shows no trace of
irony in referring to these women as examples of women\'s rights and
democracy at work.) He demonstrates that women have arrived in the
United States---just look at how many of them he can show us! We are
reassured that women can rise to the top and that, therefore, we must
live in a democratic society. Next, just as Laura Bush listed the train
of Taliban abuses against women in her radio address, George W. Bush
reminds us of what women suffered under the Taliban and Saddam
Hussein---and that they no longer suffer because of U.S. military
intervention. By contrast, his list of abuses reminds us that women in
America really do seem to enjoy their rights after all. In the United
States, we know that women and girls can become educated. In the United
States, women can already receive the training to become teachers. In
the United States, we do not have rape chambers or torture chambers. In
the United States, women are not forced to wear the burka or to stay in
at night. [The United States seems to be an egalitarian paradise by
comparison with these oppressive regimes---what could women have to be
concerned about here]{.underline}? Therefore, [his narrative reassures
us that women in the United States have their full rights---there is no
additional work necessary to achieve them]{.underline}---and
consequently, the United States must be a democracy. Correspondingly,
this narrative motivates us to be concerned about women\'s rights and
democracy abroad. [We are liberators, agents of civilization, progress,
democracy; because we have already achieved these things for ourselves,
we must now bring them to others]{.underline}. In a new way, this
rhetoric lands us in the same place as does the respect rhetoric: [We
need to act as masculinist protectors of women\'s rights around the
world.]{.underline} We can see this in a story that Bush recounts of
being hailed by an Iraqi woman (and member of the Iraqi Governing
Council) as "my liberator," just before she burst into tears. Her tears
provoke laughter from Bush\'s audience---a gentle laughter. Yet when he
admits that he himself cried in response, he is greeted with
enthusiastic applause. 41 This is the appropriate response to the
rhetoric of democracy: We must feel compassion for those around the
world who do not have rights or democracy, and we must be motivated to
bring it to them---for the sake of national security. Now that we have
taken a closer look at the logic of the Bush Administration\'s feminized
security rhetoric, we can turn to analyzing what this way of framing
women\'s rights does. Recall that frames are sources of meaning; they
help us to structure and make sense of our world. Consequently, the
successful reframing of an issue alters how many people perceive it. It
creates, as the Bush official suggested to Ron Suskind, a new reality.
How we perceive "reality" in turn affects our priorities, our
allegiances, and our decisions. So [[what kind of a reality is created
by this rhetoric]{.underline}]{.mark}? I suggest that it can be captured
by two narratives. 42 [[The first]{.mark} of these [is a narrative of
**masculinist protection**]{.mark}. [We are superior to you]{.mark}
(because we are civilized, or because we have a democracy), [and
therefore]{.mark} we must take on the role of your
protecto]{.underline}r. [[We will go to war against those who would hurt
you, and we will bring you civilization and
democracy]{.mark}.]{.underline} As Ann Tickner (2001, 57) suggests, a
variant of [this narrative has long been used to motivate military
forces: Men must fight wars in order to protect innocent women and
children]{.underline}. Here, [the feminization of the victims of the
Taliban and of Saddam Hussein serves to masculinize and justify U.S.
military actions]{.underline}. [The second narrative is that of
international women\'s liberation. Women\'s rights were achieved for
Americans long ago, and so there is no need for feminists to agitate for
them at home]{.underline}. The work to be done is to be done abroad.
[Even if there are still problems that American women face---for
example, sexual harassment, domestic violence---these are nothing
compared to the atrocities that women suffered under the
Taliban]{.underline} and in the rape camps of Saddam Hussein. So our
attentions are best directed toward liberating women in other countries.
Both of these narratives are problematic from a feminist perspective.
[**[The first]{.mark}** is troubling because]{.underline} it trades on
notions of men as protectors and women as victims that feminists have
long criticized. In particular, [**[by casting the United States as a
protector,]{.mark}** [it obscures the many ways that our **military
actions increase the insecurity of women** in the countries where we
wage war and try to install democracy]{.mark}]{.underline}. 43 [**[The
second]{.mark}** is disturbing because it [undercuts the **motivation
for domestic activism**]{.mark}]{.underline}. [Feminists clamoring for
rights at home are more likely than not to be seen as privileged whiners
who cannot appreciate how good they have it, in comparison to the brave
women of Iraq and Afghanistan who struggle against true
adversity.]{.underline} Yet even as the Bush Administration rhetoric
frames women\'s rights in these objectionable ways, I do not believe
that we should simply condemn it, for there are also reasons to
celebrate this feminization of security. [I celebrate this rhetoric not
because it is feminist]{.underline} (as the Global Scorecard coalition
seems to think), [but rather for the perverse reason that it represents
the co-optation of feminism.]{.underline} The Bush Administration\'s
repeated insistence on its record of standing up for women\'s rights
demonstrates how feminists have successfully reshaped the worldviews of
many Americans over the years. Appeals to women\'s rights are no longer
treated as completely marginal, nor are they voiced primarily by members
of the Democratic Party. Rather, Bush---a very socially conservative
Republican---ran for re-election in 2004 in part on his record of
pursuing women\'s rights in Afghanistan and Iraq. 44 [As uncomfortable
as some of his policies may make feminists, we have to allow ourselves
to recognize the gains we have made in framing women\'s rights as an
important political issue for the Left and the Right]{.underline}. [We
should also be heartened by the]{.underline} Bush [Administration\'s
ability to co-opt feminist concerns, because this suggests that we, in
turn, might co-opt their concerns for feminist ends]{.underline}.
[Rhetorical frames]{.underline}, as I have argued, [are
transposable]{.underline}. Our worldviews are not fixed once and for
all, but may be shifted. Just as the Bush Administration has lifted
elements of feminist rhetoric to suit its own agenda, we in turn can
lift pieces of its rhetoric and redeploy them in new contexts for
feminist ends. This, I expect, is a difficult process, especially since
feminist groups have considerably less influence and power than the
office of the president. Nonetheless, I believe that we need to embrace
the struggle to frame women\'s rights in a feminist way as an important
political activity. This is an activity in which many feminists are
already engaged, but it is an activity that is devalued and undermined
when feminists themselves insist upon drawing a stark division between
words and deeds. What my analysis suggests is that [**[the more
effective strategies of resistance will be those that respond to and
directly contest the shift in the rhetoric]{.mark}** of women\'s rights
effected by the Bush Administration]{.underline}. For example, if we are
told that women\'s rights are instrumentally valuable for national
security, then feminists might do well to reframe their demands in terms
of security. In other words, [the Bush rhetoric gives women\'s groups in
Iraq, Afghanistan, and the United States a powerful lever to use against
Washington\'s foreign policy]{.underline}. [Insofar as women\'s rights
are seen as instrumental to national security, they have a kind of
centrality and rhetorical purchase]{.underline} in the war on terror
that they have not had in the past---especially with a conservative
administration. If feminists can frame their concerns as concerns about
security, they may be able to expand their domestic audiences. [[The
feminist scholarship in **i**]{.mark}nternational **[r]{.mark}**elations
on the concept of [security provides an example]{.mark} of what this
might look like: It aims to replace a notion of state security with one
of **personal security for women**]{.underline}---[that is]{.underline},
[security from]{.underline} war, from [domestic violence, and from
rape]{.underline} (e.g., Tickner 1992, 2001). 45 T[o demonstrate that
many women in the United States lack this personal security is to
undermine the Bush logic that women at home no longer have anything to
complain about, for it reveals the continuity between our grievances and
those of the women of Afghanistan and Iraq.]{.underline} 46 Yet
mainstream feminist activists in America have been surprisingly
reluctant to take advantage of the power of security discourse. Insofar
as they have made use of it, they do not seem to make any attempt to
resignify or challenge the dominant understanding of security. 47
Another approach might be to resist the Bush Administration\'s framing
of women\'s rights by redeploying the rhetoric of democracy. [Recall
that part of the logic of this rhetoric is that the recognition of
women\'s rights and the realization of democracy are equivalent. Why not
take this equation seriously and use it to examine democracy in the
United States]{.underline}? [If a democracy is a government that
recognizes women\'s rights, then can we say that the United States is
truly democratic]{.underline}? After all, [if we restrict our notion of
equal rights to political rights, American women are significantly
behind women from other countries]{.underline}. Consider that [Iraq and
Afghanistan have equal rights provisions written into their
constitutions]{.underline}, [and they have quotas for female
representatives that far exceed the current percentage of women in
Congress]{.underline}. 48 [The administration has supported these
attempts to institutionalize women\'s rights---abroad.]{.underline} Why
not leverage the administration\'s record of supporting women\'s rights
in new democracies in order to pressure it to support similar provisions
at home: an Equal Rights Amendment and legislative quotas? 49
Furthermore, we could use the rhetoric of democracy to critique Bush\'s
domestic policies regarding women. Insofar as his domestic policies
undermine women\'s rights, the logic of his own rhetoric would suggest
that they simultaneously undermine democracy in the United States. So,
for example, we might argue that the administration\'s underfunding of
the Violence Against Women Act (VAWA) encourages the violation of
women\'s rights. Since [American women\'s security in their own persons
is denied by a government that does not actively seek to eradicate
gendered violence, women cannot be expected to enjoy citizenship equally
with men.]{.underline} Accordingly, the United States under Bush\'s
rule, while it aspires to be democratic, is actually wide of the mark.
Both of the rhetorical strategies I have only briefly outlined here
refuse to accept the Bush Administration premise that feminism at home
is irrelevant. Yet they do so in ways that importantly acknowledge the
power of words to shape our way of seeing the world. They contest and
redeploy the dominant framing rhetoric by transforming it anew into a
rhetoric that is feminist. My analysis does not point to a wholly new
strategy or course of action for feminists. Indeed, it confirms the
value of some of the actions that many feminists are already taking. It
helps us to understand better why we should be engaged in rhetorical
struggles over the framing of women\'s rights in relation to national
security. This struggle is difficult---but we should be heartened by the
power and influence feminism has had in framing public discourse, given
that Bush clearly thinks he needs to talk about women\'s rights in order
to woo women voters. We should also be heartened by the example that the
Bush Administration gives us of how [the terms of discourse can be
shifted through **co-optation** and **transposition**.]{.underline}
[Understanding that the Bush Administration\'s rhetoric neither wholly
embraces feminism nor completely rejects its accomplishments gives us
reason to be optimistic---cautiously optimistic---that we, too, can
again have a significant impact on how women\'s rights are framed, at
home and abroad]{.underline}.

According to conventional accounts of international relations (IR),
scholars focus on war (predominantly as a means to providing the
sovereign state with security) and the existence of war\'s corollary is
a foundational assumption that goes largely unquestioned. Peace must
exist, for international relations are not characterised by perpetual
conflict. However, [[peace is]{.mark} implicitly
[defined]{.mark}]{.underline}, in dichotomous terms, [by the absence of
violent conflict, [as \'not-war\']{.mark}]{.underline}. Of more
analytical interest is conflict, which is always a possibility and
which, moreover, occurs between states. [[I]{.mark}nternational
[r]{.mark}elations as a discipline]{.underline}, narrowly conceived,
[[is]{.mark} largely [unconcerned with activities that occur within the
state]{.mark}]{.underline}[.]{.mark} Minimally, feminist and other
critical approaches to IR seek to correct such disciplinary myopia.

Morgenthau\'s \'political man\' (1973, pp. 15--6) -- in order to
construct the state as actor, the now dominant neo-realism abstracts the
human subject from its disciplinary musings, leading to the infamous
\'black box\' model of the state. Early feminist scholarship challenged
this assumption as well, arguing that individuals, as human subjects in
all their messy complexity, are an integral part of international
relations (see Shepherd, 2007, pp. 240--1). [[Attention to]{.mark} the
human subject]{.underline} in I/international R/relations -- or, as
Christine Sylvester phrases it, \'relations international\', [to
emphasise the embedded nature of all kinds of relations in the
international sphere, including power relations and [gender
relations]{.mark}]{.underline} []{.mark}(Sylvester, 1994, p. 6; see also
Enloe, 1996) -- [[allows]{.mark} critical [scholars to look
beyond]{.mark} the disciplinary [obsession with war]{.mark}. Further, it
allows us to investigate one of the simplest insights of feminist IR,
which is also one of the most devastating: [the war/peace dichotomy is
gendered]{.mark}, misleading [and]{.mark} potentially
[pathological]{.mark}]{.underline}. In this essay, I address each of
these concerns in turn, developing a critique of the war/peace dichotomy
that is foundational to conventional approaches to IR through a review
of three recent publications in the field of feminist security studies.
These texts are Cynthia Enloe\'s (2007) Globalization and Militarism,
David Roberts\' (2008) Human Insecurity, and Mothers, Monsters, Whores:
Women\'s Violence in Global Politics by Laura Sjoberg and Caron Gentry
(2008). Drawing on the insights of these books, I ask first how violence
is understood in global politics, with specific reference to the
gendered disciplinary blindnesses that frequently characterise
mainstream approaches. Second, I demonstrate how a focus on war and
peace can neglect to take into account the politics of everyday
violence: the violences of the in-between times that international
politics recognises neither as \'war\' nor \'peace\' and the violences
inherent to times of peace that are overlooked in the study of war.
Finally, I argue that [**[feminist security studies offers a]{.mark}n
important [corrective to]{.mark} the [foundational assumptions of IR,
which]{.mark} themselves [can perpetuate the very]{.mark} instances of
[violence that they seek to redress]{.mark}**[. If we accept the core
insights of feminist security]{.mark} studies -- the [centrality of the
human]{.mark} subject, the [importance of]{.mark} particular
[configurations of masculinity and femininity, and the gendered
conceptual framework that underpins]{.mark} the discipline of [IR -- we
are encouraged to envisage a]{.mark} rather [different politics]{.mark}
of the global]{.underline}. From Boudica to Bhopal As Sjoberg and Gentry
recount (2008, pp. 38--9), Boudica was an Iceni queen who led an
uprising against the Roman forces occupying the British Isles circa 61
AD. Prior to launching the attack, Boudica\'s refusal to allow a Roman
general to claim ownership of her land resulted in the rape of her two
daughters as punishment. However, \'many inherited tales about Boudica
do not emphasise her personal or political motivations, but the savage
and unwomanly brutality of her actions\' (Sjoberg and Gentry, 2008, p.
39). Almost two thousand years later and half a planet away, a toxic gas
leak in 1984 at a Union Carbide plant in Bhopal, India caused the
immediate deaths of approximately 3,000 people and left tens of
thousands suffering the after-effects for decades (Roberts, 2008, p.
10). At first reading, little links these two accounts of quite
different forms of violence. The first is an instance of violent
resistance against imperial oppression, and Boudica has been vilified,
her efforts delegitimised, in much the same way as many actors in
\'small wars\' tend to be in global politics today (see Barkawi, 2004).
The second is perhaps more usefully seen as the result of structural
violence, following Johan Galtung\'s explanation of the same, as
\'violence where there is no such actor\' (cited in Roberts, 2008, p.
18). However, by asking questions about Boudica and Bhopal that are born
of a \'feminist curiosity\' (Enloe, 2007, p. 1, p. 11), these texts
demonstrate connections beyond the simplistic equation that is
applicable to both: actor/structure plus violence equals death. In Human
Insecurity, Roberts poses the question, \'What is violence?\' (2008, p.
17). This is a question rarely asked in international relations.
Violence is war: large-scale, state-dominated, much studied, war.
However, the three texts under review here all offer more nuanced
theories of violence that focus analytical attention on complex
constructions of agency (institutional and international), structure,
and the global context that is product and productive of such violence.
Through an intricate and beautifully accessible analysis of modernity
--\'that pot of gold at the end of the global rainbow\' (Enloe, 2007, p.
64) -- Enloe encourages her readers to seek the connections between
globalisation and militarisation, arguing that at the heart of this
nexus lie important questions about violence and security. Roberts notes
a broad dissatisfaction with the concept of \'human security\' (2008,
pp. 14--7), offering instead his investigative lens of \'human
insecurity\', defined as \'avoidable civilian deaths, occurring
globally, caused by social, political and economic institutions and
structures, built and operated by humans and which could feasibly be
changed\' (p. 28). Placing the human at the centre of concerns about
security immediately challenges a conventional state-based approach to
security, as Enloe explains. In a convincing account of the hard-fought
expansion of the concept of security, mapped on to strategic and
organisational gains made by various feminist organisations, Enloe
reminds us that **[[if we take seriously the lives of women -- their
understandings of security -- as well as on-the-ground workings]{.mark}
of masculinity and femininity, [we will be able to produce more]{.mark}
meaningful and more [reliable analyses of \'security\']{.mark}--
personal, national and global]{.underline}** (Enloe, 2007, p. 47). This
latter quote typifies an approach for which Enloe has become somewhat
famous. In the early 1980s, Enloe began asking the questions for which
she is rightly acknowledged as a key figure in feminist security
studies, including Does Khaki Become You? (Enloe, 1983) and \'where are
the women?\' (Enloe, 2000; see also Enloe, 2004). Inspired by her own
curiosity about the roles played by women and the functions performed by
gender in the militarisation of civilian life, Enloe has explored
prostitution, marriage, welfare and war making with an eye to the
representation (both political and symbolic) of women. In Globalization
and Militarism she offers detailed vignettes that illuminate just how
interwoven violence is with the quest for (various types of) security,
and demands that nothing is left unquestioned in a critical analysis of
these concepts. Even baby socks (embossed with tiny fighter planes, a
gift to the parent of a small boy) have something to tell us about
gender, militarism and the casual representations of violence and war
that society accepts (Enloe, 2007, pp. 143--4). Following a similar
logic, although he initially defines human insecurity as avoidable
civilian deaths, Roberts focuses on \'preventable female deaths \... and
avoidable deaths in children under five\' (2008, p. 31). While this
conflation of \'civilian\' with \'women and children\' is rather
problematic (see Carpenter, 2006), in asking not only, where are the
women? but also, why are they dying in such disproportionate numbers?
Roberts enhances his critique of \'most security studies \... \[that\]
largely \[miss\] the scale of avoidable human misery and avoidable human
death\' (2008, p. 4). As mentioned above, [Roberts uses Galtung\'s
concept of structural violence to draw attention to the manifest ways in
which an increasingly interconnected [global system relies on gender and
violence]{.mark} (and gendered violence) [for its perpetuation]{.mark}:
\'The process of [globalization]{.mark}]{.underline}, to which few are
ideologically or otherwise opposed, [[is an essential]{.mark} conveyor
and [articulator of]{.mark} the [masculinity]{.mark} that underpins
andrarchy\']{.underline} (Roberts, 2008, p. 157). Whereas Enloe offers a
persuasive and accessible account of patriarchy, a concept familiar to
feminist and non-feminist scholars alike (Enloe, 2007, pp. 66--8),
Roberts suggests \'andrarchy\' as an alternative, which he defines as
\'the gender-partisan ideological domination and rule structure that
determines and sustains the general relative power of males over females
globally\' (Roberts, 2008, p. 140). However, it is difficult to see how
this reformulation either differs substantively from patriarchy as an
analytical tool or assists in the construction of an alternative theory
of global violence that centralises the individual, and therefore takes
gender seriously, in that it seems to essentialise violent actors
(males) and violated victims (females). In contrast, [Enloe\'s
explanation of patriarchy challenges]{.underline} such [essentialism as
its first point of critical intervention. That is, the assumption of
essential differences between men and women is part of patriarchal
ideology, feeding into stereotypical notions of how such men and women
should behave, which in turn constitute recognisable discourses of
gender: sets of narratives about masculinity and femininity and how
these are, in general, respectively privileged and
marginalised]{.underline}. The most theoretically coherent account of
gender and violence offered in these three texts comes from Sjoberg and
Gentry and employs the notion of discourse to great effect. Whereas
Roberts seeks to map out a consciously structural account of global
violence, where the structure in question is a hybrid of andrarchy and a
\'rapacious, increasingly competitive and hyper-masculine\'
neoliberalism (Roberts, 2008, p. 118), Sjoberg and Gentry offer a more
sophisticated analysis of structure and agency in their \'relational
autonomy framework\' that accounts for both individual agency and
structural constraint (Sjoberg and Gentry, 2008, pp. 189--98). When
people perform acts of political violence, they argue, this is a
conscious choice, but crucially individuals \'choose within a specified
spectrum of socially acceptable choices\' (p. 190). \'In its simplest
form, relational autonomy is the recognition that freedom of action is
defined and limited by social relationships\' (p. 194) and this has
profound implications for the study of violence in global politics.
Sjoberg and Gentry use this insight to demonstrate that women\'s
violence in global politics is rendered unintelligible, through
narrative representations of the perpetrators as mothers, monsters or
whores (in media discourse and academic discussion), rather than as
autonomous agents. From the abuses of prisoners held at Abu Ghraib
prison in Iraq, via the \'black widows\' of Chechnya, to female
perpetrators of genocidal violence in Rwanda, the authors show how
representations of women\'s violence conform to and further confirm the
stereotypes of violent women as either mothers (supporting or vengeful),
monsters or sexually deviant whores (Sjoberg and Gentry, 2008, pp.
30--49). The very different theories of violence outlined in these three
texts all contribute to the development of a more comprehensive and
holistic understanding of violence in global politics. [By [insisting
that i]{.mark}nternational [r]{.mark}elations [are also gender
relations]{.mark} -- by demanding that we recognise that states are an
analytical abstraction and politics is practised or performed by
gendered bodies]{.underline} -- all of the [authors [put forward
theories of violence that are corrective of gender
blindness]{.mark}]{.underline}, in that [the violences in question are
simultaneously gendered and gendering]{.underline} (see Shepherd, 2008,
pp. 49--54). They are gendered because they have different impacts on
male and female bodies (Enloe, 2007, p. 13), both materially as people
experience violence differently depending on their gender (and race,
class, sexuality and so on) and also discursively, as what we expect of
men and women in terms of their behaviours, violent and otherwise, is
limited by the meaning(s) ascribed to male and female bodies by society.
Regarding the former, Roberts proposes that we term the global
victimisation of women \'structural femicide\' (Roberts, 2008, p. 65),
but does not sufficiently engage with the question of whether defining
gendered violence as violence against women (and children) functions to
constitute the subject of \'woman\' as a perpetual victim, in need of
protection and lacking in agency (Shepherd, 2008, p. 41). In contrast,
Sjoberg and Gentry neatly articulate the interplay between material and
discursive violence as they write a theory that accounts \'for people\'s
impact on global politics and for the impact of narratives others
construct for and about them\' (Sjoberg and Gentry, 2008, p. 216,
emphasis in original). Thus, violence is gendering as our understanding
of politics is in part reproduced through violent actions. [Through
discursive violence against individuals]{.underline} -- for example,
representing Chechen women suicide terrorists as \'black widows\', which
demands that they are attributed the characteristics of the venomous and
deadly black widow spider and, further, that their violence is grounded
in familial loss, \'born directly of a desire for vengeance for the
deaths of their husbands and sons\' (Sjoberg and Gentry, 2008, p. 100)
rather than as the result of a process of political decision making --
[our understanding of that individual and of the act of violence itself
is produced]{.underline}. Similarly, through material acts of violence,
discourses of gender are given physical form; the detainees at Abu
Ghraib who were forced to simulate oral sex with each other were forced
to do so in part because of crude cultural understandings of
homosexuality as deviant and homosexuals as lesser men -- that is, as
women. To force a man to perform oral sex on another man is to undermine
his masculinity and simultaneously to reinforce the gendered power
relations that claim privilege for masculinity over femininity,
heterosexuality over homosexuality -- power relations that render such
an act intelligible in the first instance. Such understandings of
violence are beyond the remit of conventional state-based approaches to
international relations. However, [\'it is by tracking the gendered
assumptions about how to wield feminization to humiliate
male\[s\]]{.underline}\' (Enloe, 2007, p. 115) [and how to represent
gendered individuals in such a way as to render some acts of violence
intelligible as political and others as monstrous that we can begin to
piece together a useful feminist account of global violence, which is a
necessary component of understanding security]{.underline}. Everyday
Violence and In-Between Days In addition to questioning what violence
is, how it is represented and with what effects, [feminist security
studies scholarship also asks which violences are considered worthy of
study and when these violences occur]{.underline}. Expanding the concept
of violence that underpins feminist analysis, as outlined above, allows
us to take seriously what Arthur Kleinman (2000) refers to as \'the
violences of everyday life\'. [[Beyond a narrow focus on war]{.mark} and
state-based violence [lies]{.mark} a plethora of [everyday
violences]{.mark} that feminist security studies seeks to
address]{.underline}. In the field of security studies the [broadening
and deepening]{.underline} of the concept of security, [such that it is
no longer assumed to apply only to the sovereign state, has demonstrated
the multiple insecurities experienced by individuals and social
collectives]{.underline} (Booth, 2005, pp. 14--5). The development of
the concept of \'human security\' largely took place within the
parameters of a wider disciplinary debate over the appropriate referent
object for security studies (the individual, society, the state) and the
types of threat to the referent object that would be recognised. In a
move similar to Ken Booth\'s (1991) reformulation of security as
emancipation, Roberts\' [quest for individual empowerment seeks to
overcome]{.underline} the \'élite-legitimized disequilibrium\' that
results in the [manifest insecurity of the majority of the world\'s
population]{.underline} (Roberts, 2008, p. 185). As might be expected,
the violences Roberts identifies are innumerable. [In addition to the
physical violences]{.underline} of \'infanticide, maternal mortality,
intimate (\"domestic\", \"honour\" and \"dowry\") killings and lethal
female genital mutilation; and avoidable deaths in children under five\'
(Roberts, 2008, p. 31), his [analysis attacks the institutional
structures]{.underline} of the dominant international financial
institutions (pp. 117--35) [and the andrarchal]{.underline} and
neoliberal [discourses that sustain them]{.underline} (pp. 136--58). In
short, Roberts\' answer to the question of which violences matter in
global politics is quite simple: all of them. However, while studies of
human security, he argues, seek to provide the human with security, his
reformulated analytic takes as its starting point human insecurity; that
is, he starts with the threat(s) to the sovereign subject rather than
the subject\'s ontological condition. Roberts suggests that this
circumvents the disciplinary definitional problem with human security --
identified by Roland Paris (2001), Edward Newman (2001; 2004) and others
-- but I cannot see how this is the case, given that the answer to the
question \'what is it that humans do to make the world a more dangerous
and dysfunctional place?\' (Roberts, 2008, p. 28) is also quite simple:
we live in it. Thus Roberts\' analytic seems to suffer the same lack of
definitional clarity -- and therefore policy relevance -- that he
ascribes to more conventional approaches; it is no easier to identify,
quantify and ultimately reduce the threats experienced by coexisting
human subjects than it is to provide those human subjects with security,
if security can first be defined as freedom from fear or want. I do not
espouse some construction of human nature (if such a thing were to
exist) that assumes essential selfishness and a propensity for violence,
nor do I assume that security is a zero-sum game, in that one person\'s
security must always be at the expense of another\'s, but I recognise
that even the most well-intentioned security policy can have unforeseen
and sometimes disastrous effects. Sometimes, moreover, as Sjoberg and
Gentry demonstrate, the decision to perform acts of political violence
that are a source of insecurity for the intended victims can be
understood if not condoned. Enloe\'s analytical remit is similarly
wide-ranging to Roberts\', in that she focuses on processes --
globalisation and militarism -- that are inherently violent. However,
although Enloe also insists that all violences should count in the study
of global politics, she grounds this claim in an analysis of specific
sites of violence and demonstrates with startling clarity just how
everyday items -- for example, sneakers -- are both globalised and
militarised: Threaded through virtually every sneaker you own is some
relationship to masculinized militaries. Locating factories in South
Korea \[in the 1960s and 1970s\] was a good strategic decision in the
eyes of those Oregon-headquartered male Nike executives because of the
close alliance between male policymakers in Washington and Seoul. It was
a relationship -- unequal but intimate -- based on their shared
anticommunism, their shared commitment to waging the Cold War, and their
shared participation in an ambitious international military alliance
(Enloe, 2007, p. 28). By drawing her readers\' attention to the ways in
which discourses of gender (ideas about how \'proper\' men and women
should behave) function, Enloe reminds us that [adhering to ideals of
masculinity and femininity is both productive of violence and is a
violence in itself, a violence against the empowered human subject.
\'Ideas matter\',]{.underline} she concludes, ideas [about]{.underline}
modernity, [security]{.underline}, violence, threat, trust. \'Each of
these ideas is fraught with blatant and subtle presumptions about
masculinity and femininity. Ideas about both masculinity and femininity
matter. This makes a feminist curiosity a necessity\' (Enloe, 2007, p.
161). [While conventional studies of IR and security may be willing to
concede that ideas matter]{.underline} (see Finnemore and Sikkink,
2001), [[paying close attention to the work that gender does allows for
a fuller understanding of why it is that particular violences fall
outside the traditional parameters of study]{.underline}]{.mark}. As to
the question of when violence is worthy of study, all three texts
implicitly or explicitly draw on the popular feminist phrase: \'the
personal is political\'. This slogan neatly encapsulates the feminist
critique of a supposed foundational divide between the private and the
public realms of social life. In arguing that the personal is political,
feminist theory refuses to accept that there are instances of human
behaviour or situations in social life that can or should be bracketed
from study. At its simplest, this critique led to the recognition of
\'domestic violence\' as a political, rather than a personal issue (see,
for example Moore, 2003; Youngs, 2003), forming the foundation for
critical studies of gendered violence in times of war and in times of
peace that would otherwise have been ignored. Crucially, Enloe extended
the boundaries of critique to include the international, imbuing the
phrase with new analytical vitality when she suggested, first, that the
phrase itself is palindromic (that is, that the political is also
personal, inextricably intertwined with the everyday) and, second, that
the personal is international just as the international is personal.
\'The international is personal\' implies that governments depend upon
certain kinds of allegedly private relationships in order to conduct
their foreign affairs. \... To operate in the international arena,
governments seek other governments\' recognition of their sovereignty;
but they also depend on ideas about masculinised dignity and feminised
sacrifice to sustain that sense of autonomous nationhood (Enloe, 2000,
pp. 196--7). These ideas about dignity and sacrifice are not neatly
contained within the temporal boundaries of any given war, nor are they
incidental to the practice of warfare. Further, [there is]{.underline}
of course also [the question of who gets to define or declare war, or
peace]{.underline}. While some of the violent women whose actions are
analysed by Sjoberg and Gentry perform their violences in wartime (for
example, Lynndie England, who received the most attention from global
media of the women involved in prisoner abuse at Abu Ghraib; see Sjoberg
and Gentry, 2008, pp. 67--70), [others are fighting wars that are not
sanctioned by the international community]{.underline} (such as the
Chechen women \[pp. 97--111\] and female Palestinian suicide bombers
\[pp. 112--40\]). As discussed above, [ideas]{.underline} about
masculinity and femininity, dignity and sacrifice may not only be
violent in themselves, but [are also the product/productive of physical
violences]{.underline}. With this in mind, [the feminist argument that
\'peacetime\' is analytically misleading is a valid one. Of interest are
the \'in-between days\' and the ways in which **[labelling periods of
war or peace as such can divert attention away from the myriad violences
that inform and reinforce social behaviour]{.mark}**]{.underline}.
[\[W\]ar can surely [never be said to start and end at a clearly defined
moment.]{.mark} Rather, [it seems part of a continuum]{.mark} of
conflict, expressed now in armed force, now in economic sanctions or
political pressure. A time of supposed peace may come later to be called
\'the pre-war period\'. During the fighting of a war]{.underline},
unseen by the foot soldiers under fire, [peace processes are often
already at work. A time of postwar reconstruction]{.underline}, later,
[may be re-designated as an inter bellum-- a mere pause between
wars]{.underline} (Cockburn and Zarkov, cited in El Jack, 2003, p. 9).
[Feminist security studies interrogates the pauses between wars, and the
political processes -- and practices of power -- that demarcate times as
such]{.underline}. In doing so, [not only is the remit of recognisable
violence]{.underline} (violence worthy of study) [expanded, but so too
are the parameters of what counts as IR]{.underline}. Everyday violences
and [acts of everyday resistance]{.underline} (\'a fashion show, a tour,
a small display of children\'s books\' in Enloe, 2007, pp. 117--20) [are
the stuff of relations international and, thus, of a comprehensive
understanding of security]{.underline}. In the following section I
outline the ways in which taking these claims seriously allows us to
engage critically with the representations of international relations
that inform our research, with potentially profound implications. The
Violent Reproduction of the International As well as conceiving of
gender as a set of discourses, and violence as a means of reproducing
and reinforcing the relevant discursive limits, **[[it is possible to
see security as a set of discourses]{.underline}]{.mark}**, as I have
argued more fully elsewhere (Shepherd, 2007; 2008; see also Shepherd and
Weldes, 2007). Rather than pursuing the study of security as if it were
something that can be achieved either in absolute, partial or relative
terms, **[[engaging with security as discourse enables]{.mark} the
[analysis of how these discourses]{.mark} function to
[reproduce]{.mark}, through various strategies, [the domain of the
international with which IR is]{.mark} self-consciously
[concerned]{.mark}]{.underline}**. Just as violences that are gendering
reproduce gendered subjects, on this view states, acting as
authoritative entities, perform violences, but violences, in the name of
security, also perform states. These processes occur simultaneously, and
across the whole spectrum of social life: an instance of rape in war is
at once gendering of the individuals involved and of the social
collectivities -- states, communities, regions -- they feel they
represent (see Bracewell, 2000); building a fence in the name of
security that separates people from their land and extended families
performs particular kinds of violence (at checkpoints, during patrols)
and performs particular subject identities (of the state authority, of
the individuals affected), all of which are gendered. All of the texts
under discussion in this essay argue that it is imperative to explore
and expose gendered power relations and, further, that doing so not only
enables a rigorous critique of realism in IR but also reminds us as
scholars of the need for such a critique. [The critiques of IR offered
by feminist scholars are grounded in a rejection of]{.underline}
neo-realism/[realism as a dominant intellectual framework for
academics]{.underline} in the discipline and policy makers alike. As
Enloe reminds us, \'the government-centred, [militarized version of
national security]{.underline} \[derived from a realist framework\]
[remains the dominant mode of policy thinking\']{.underline} (Enloe,
2007, p. 43). [Situating gender]{.underline} as a central category of
analysis [encourages us to \'think outside the \"state security
box]{.underline}\"\' (p. 47) [and to remember that]{.underline} \'the
\"[[individuals\" of global politics]{.underline}]{.mark} do not
[[work]{.underline}]{.mark} alone, live alone or politic alone -- they
do so [[in interdependent relationships with
others\']{.underline}]{.mark} (Sjoberg and Gentry, 2008, p. 200) [[that
are inherently gendered]{.underline}]{.mark}. One of the key analytical
contributions of all three texts is the way in which they all challenge
what it means to be \'doing\' IR, by recognising various forms of
violence, interrogating the public/private divide and demanding that
attention is paid to the temporal and physical spaces in-between war and
peace. [Feminist security studies should not simply be seen
as]{.underline} \'women doing security\', or as [\'adding women
to]{.underline} IR/[security studies\']{.underline}, important as these
contributions are. Through their theorising, the [authors]{.underline}
discussed here [reconfigure what \'counts\' as IR]{.underline},
challenging orthodox notions of who can \'do\' IR and what \'doing\' IR
means. The [[practices of power needed to maintain dominant
configurations of international relations are exposed]{.mark}, and
critiquing the productive power of realism as a discourse is one way in
which the authors do this]{.underline}. Sjoberg and Gentry pick up on a
recent theoretical shift in Anglo-American IR, from system-level
analysis to a recognition that individuals matter. However, as they
rightly point out, the individuals who are seen to matter are not
gendered relational beings, but rather reminiscent of Hobbes\'
construction of the autonomous rational actor. \'\[T\]he narrowness of
the group that \[such an approach\] includes limits its effectiveness as
an interpretive framework and reproduces the gender, class and race
biases in system-level international relationship scholarship\' (Sjoberg
and Gentry 2008, p. 200, emphasis added). [[Without paying adequate
attention to the construction of individuals as gendered]{.mark} beings,
or to the reproduction of widely held ideas about masculine and feminine
behaviours]{.underline}, Sjoberg and Gentry remind us that [[we
will]{.mark} ultimately [fail \'to see and deconstruct the increasingly
subtle, complex and disguised ways in which gender pervades
international relations and global politics]{.mark}]{.underline}\'
(2008, p. 225). In a similar vein, Roberts notes that \'human security
is marginalised or rejected as inauthentic \[because\] it is not a
reflection of realism\'s (male) agendas and priorities\' (2008, p. 169).
The \'agendas and priorities\' identified by Roberts and acknowledged by
Sjoberg and Gentry as being productive of particular biases in
scholarship are not simply \'academic\' matters, in the pejorative sense
of the term. As Roberts argues, \'Power relationships of inequality
happen because they are built that way by human determinism of security
and what is required to maintain security (p. 171). Realism, as academic
discourse and as policy guideline, has material effects. Although his
analysis employs an unconventional definition of the term \'social
construction\' (seemingly interchangeable with \'human agency\') and
rests on a novel interpretation of the three foundational assumptions of
realism (Roberts, 2008, pp. 169--77), the central point that Roberts
seeks to make in his conclusion is valid: \'it is a challenge to those
who deny relationships between gender and security; between human agency
(social construction) and lethal outcome\' (p. 183). In sum, all three
texts draw their readers to an inescapable, and -- for the conventional
study of IR -- a devastating conclusion: the dominance of
neo-realism/realism and the state-based study of security that derives
from this is potentially pathological, in that it is in part productive
of the violences it seeks to ameliorate. I suggest that critical
engagement with orthodox IR theory is necessary for the intellectual
growth of the discipline, and considerable insight can be gained by
acknowledging the relevance of feminist understandings of gender, power
and theory. The young woman buying a T-shirt from a multinational
clothing corporation with her first pay cheque, the group of young men
planning a stag weekend in Amsterdam, a group of students attending a
demonstration against the bombing of Afghanistan -- studying these
significant actions currently falls outside the boundaries of doing
security studies in mainstream IR and I believe these boundaries need
contesting. As Marysia Zalewski argues: International politics is what
we make it to be \... We need to rethink the discipline in ways that
will disturb the existing boundaries of both that which we claim to be
relevant in international politics and what we assume to be legitimate
ways of constructing knowledge about the world (Zalewski 1996, p. 352,
emphasis in original). Conclusion: \'Let a Hundred Flowers Bloom, Let a
Hundred Schools of Thought Contend\' (Mao Tse-Tung) In this essay, I
have used the analysis of three contemporary publications in the field
of feminist security studies to demonstrate three significant sets of
analytical contributions that such scholarship makes to the discipline
of IR. Beyond the war/peace dichotomy that is frequently assumed to be
definitive of the discipline, we find many and various forms of
violence, occurring in and between temporally distinct periods of
conflict, which are the product/productive of socially acceptable modes
of gendered behaviour, ways of being in the world as a woman or man. I
have also argued that critical engagement with conventional, state-based
approaches to (national) security must persist as the academic
discourses we write are complicit in the construction of the global as
we understand it. Further, [**[\'if all experience is gendered, analysis
of gendered identities is an imperative starting point in the study of
political identities and practice\']{.underline}**]{.mark} (Peterson,
1999, p. 37). To this end, I conclude by suggesting that we take
seriously Enloe\'s final comment: \'Tracking militarization and
fostering demilitarization will call for cooperative investigations,
multiple skills and the appreciation of diverse perspectives\' (2007, p.
164). While there has been intense intra-disciplinary debate within
contemporary feminist security studies over the necessary \'feminist
credentials\' of some gendered analyses, it is important to recognise
the continual renewal and analytical vigour brought to the field by such
debates. Broadly speaking, there are two positions we might map. On the
one side, there are those who refuse to reduce gender to a variable in
their research, arguing that to do so limits the critical insight that
can be gained from treating gender instead as a noun, a verb and a
structural logic (see, for example, Sjoberg, 2006; Zalewski, 2007). On
this view, \'gender\', whether deployed as noun, verb or logic in a
particular analysis, cannot be separated from the decades of feminist
scholarship that worked to explore, expand on and elucidate what gender
might mean. On the opposing side are scholars who, typically using
phrases such as \'balanced consideration\' (Jones, 1998, p. 303) and
\'an inclusive perspective on gender and war\' (Griffiths, 2003, pp.
327--8, emphasis in original), manipulate gender as a variable in their
research to \'extend the scope of feminist IR scholarship\' (Caprioli,
2004, p. 266) and to draw conclusions regarding sex-specific behaviours
in conflict and post-conflict situations (see also Caprioli and Boyer,
2001; Carpenter, 2006; Melander, 2005). Crucially, however, scholarship
on both sides of this \'divide\' coexists, and in doing so encourages
\'the appreciation of diverse perspectives\'. While bracketing feminist
politics from the study of gender is an overtly political move, which
can be presented as either strategic (Carpenter, 2006, pp. 6--10) or as
common sense, in that it \'enhances \[the\] explanatory capabilities\'
of feminist security studies (Caprioli, 2004, p. 266), all
interrogations of security that take gender seriously draw attention to
the ways in which gender is at once personal, political and
international. Although it might seem that conceiving of gender as a
variable adheres both to a disciplinary narrative that rewards
positivist and abstract theory (without messy reference to bodies) and
to a neo-/anti-/post-feminist narrative that claims \'we\' have solved
the gender problem (see Zalewski, 2007, p. 303), at the very least such
approaches give credence to the idea that gender matters in global
politics. Mary Caprioli suggests that \'IR feminists shattered the
publishing boundary for feminist IR scholarship, and tackled the
difficult task of deconstructing IR theory\' (2004, p. 257). I would
caution that it is perhaps too soon to represent the shattering and
tackling as a fait accompli, but with the vital interjections of texts
such as those discussed here, [security studies scholars may yet
envisage a politics of violence and human subjectivity that transcends
the arbitrary disciplinary boundaries which constrain rather than
facilitate understanding]{.underline}.

[**[I]{.mark}**nternational **[r]{.mark}**elations [was born with the
goal of advising statesmen]{.mark}]{.underline} about how to bring an
end to war or at least to manage international politics to make war less
likely. [[Feminism]{.underline}]{.mark}, however, [[was borne out of
activism, from **outside the war system**]{.mark}, when women had no
institutional channels for voice via the nation-state]{.underline}
[because they were not citizens with political rights]{.underline}.
[[This **different situatedness**]{.underline}]{.mark}, as highlighted
by feminist reflexivity[, **[leads to different types of knowledge:
knowledge for]{.mark}**]{.underline} the purpose of the [**[control and
management of human subjects]{.mark}** that can be empirically proven
and validated]{.underline}, **[[versus knowledge
for]{.underline}]{.mark}** the purpose of [[**social change**,]{.mark}
which involves uncovering practical knowledge from people's everyday
lives to liberate them from oppressive structures.]{.underline}

Advocating the latter form, Jane Addams argued that [[**knowledge should
be judged on how applicable it is**, rather than whether it can be
proven]{.underline}]{.mark}. Similarly, [**[i]{.mark}**nternational
**[r]{.mark}**elations [feminist]{.mark} methodologists]{.underline}
Ackerly and True (2010, 75[) [argue that research]{.mark}]{.underline}
questions [[should]{.mark}]{.underline} aim to [[open windows of
possibility for new forms of knowledge that address real world
problems]{.underline}]{.mark} rather than fill narrow gaps in existing
knowledge. [**[Research questions should emanate from a range of
sources]{.mark}** and informants, including **from practice, from
women's experiences and the experiences of individuals** and
organizations **[seeking to bring about social
change]{.mark}**]{.underline} (see Confortini 2012).

Although they were barred from most positions in the academy, many of
the feminist pragmatists who studied at the University of Chicago at the
turn of the twentieth century were sociologists. With an ontology
grounded in human relations, [feminist approaches are more compatible
with sociological approaches to international relations.]{.underline}
[International relations feminists]{.underline} generally [prefer
constructivist rather than rationalist approaches]{.underline} more
typical of liberal microeconomics, a model on which conventional
international relations theory has built its epistemology (Locher and
Prügl 2001). Additionally, feminists claim that **[[knowledge based on
the standpoint of women's lives]{.underline}]{.mark}**, particularly
marginalized women, **[[leads to more robust
objectivity]{.underline}]{.mark}**, not only because [[it broadens the
base from which we derive knowledge]{.underline}]{.mark}, but also
because [[the perspectives of]{.underline}]{.mark} "outsiders" or
[[marginalized people]{.underline}]{.mark} may [[reveal aspects of
reality obscured by]{.mark}]{.underline} more [[orthodox approaches to
knowledge building]{.underline}]{.mark} (Hill Collins 1991, 36).

[Post-positivist international relations methodologies]{.underline} seek
to [give a full account of the research process as a social and ethical
process]{.underline} (Jackson 2011). [[Critical feminist]{.mark}
methodology [builds reflexivity into all stages of the research
process]{.mark}]{.underline} as a core ethic that improves research
practice (Ackerly and True 2010). Feminist methodology aims to be
reflexive about the opportunities as well as the blind spots opened up
by all social and political inquiry. [It seeks to achieve strong
objectivity]{.underline}, paradoxically [by socially situating that
knowledge and being conscious of the effects of subjectivities---not
just in terms of their potential bias and limitations]{.underline} but
rather[, in terms of the]{.underline} power of certain "standpoints"
[and situatedness of researchers to generate critical
knowledge]{.underline} (Harding 1991, especially chap. 6).

[Critical knowledge]{.underline} is knowledge that [is able to
scrutinize the origins, sources, and interests associated with dominant
forms of knowledge]{.underline} [to gain a better]{.underline} and more
complete [purchase on the social and political world]{.underline}, be it
the social forces driving war and conflict or those embracing positive
peace. [Critical i]{.underline}nternational [r]{.underline}elations
[feminism involves being attentive]{.underline}, at all stages of the
research process, [to the power of different epistemologies; to
boundaries that include, exclude, and marginalize; to all social
relationships, including that between the researcher and the researched;
and to situating oneself as a researcher or experimenter in the
field]{.underline}. It is the commitment to inclusive inquiry and to
building a broad community of inquiry that makes this contemporary
research practice pragmatist. In particular, WPS scholarship includes
conflict-affected women as knowers who can identify and give meaning to
problems of conflict and peace and whose everyday practices prefigure
solutions (Bjorkdahl and Selimovic 2015; George 2016).

Julian, PhD IR@Sussex, International Relations as the Imperial Illusion;
or, the Need to Decolonize IR in Decolonizing International Relations
ed. Jones

Whatever the paucity of references to or uses of the history of the
colonized (subaltern and otherwise dispossessed), [[IR
scholarship]{.mark} is able [to present the colonized]{.mark} as much
**[through omission]{.mark}** [and **unspoken** assumption]{.mark} as by
direct reference.]{.underline} There are four principal (and no doubt
complementary) paths one can take in exposing the nature and effects of
these omissions and assumptions. First, there is the general critique of
Eurocentrism in which [[the]{.underline}]{.mark} now global dominance,
indeed [[intellectual hegemony, of]{.underline}]{.mark} the European
[\"[enlightenment\" social scientific traditions has effected the
silencing or permanent subordination of subaltern
knowledge]{.underline}]{.mark}, including historical knowledge. Here,
\"subaltern\" and \"colonized\" are synonymous. Second, there is the
profoundly important critique of \"oriental ism\" in which the Western
imagination tells us little or nothing about \"the rest\" but everything
about the West. Here, \" nothing\" and \"the rest\" are synonymous.
Third, there is the recording, tracing, and critique of [the profound
political economic inequalities that were generated by colonial (or
imperial) international order and [that]{.mark}]{.underline} have
[[result]{.mark}ed [in the **perennial extermination** of the
colonized]{.mark}]{.underline}. Here, \"colonial order\" and
\"inequality\" are synonymous. Finally, one could demonstrate the
contradiction, partiality, differentiation, and inconsistency of
ostensibly universalist doctrines, most obviously of human rights and
human equality, in the constitution of the colonial (or imperial) order.
Here, \"partiality\" and \"universality\" are synonymous. The removal or
discounting of the subordinated from their own history is secured often
through the simplest of techniques, such as in the repetition of simple
phrases. Thus, in his critical assessment of Said\'s work, Bruce Robbins
takes Disraeli\'s imperial dictum that \"the East is a career\" and
comments that his phrase is briefly and brilliantly offensive.
Activating the convention by which an empty, immobile point on the
compass is held capable of condensing millions of undescribed personal
destinies, the sentence equates these missing millions with a single
individual \'s rising curve of professional accomplishment. The
individual who is to enjoy the career is elided, as if in pretense of
equal exchange for the elision of the colossal human diversity that is
to be its raw material; in the space of symmetrical impersonality thus
cleared , the static East can be spurred into movement, metamorphosed
into the kinesis of a (Western) \'·pursuit.,,25 So, in a phrase, is
captured the essence of imperial administration and the attitude to
subject peoples. And [[it is the task of overturning a deep and long
established attitude that any call for decolonizing lR must
face]{.underline}]{.mark} . This attitude in fact tells the story of
Western supremacy-its historical and historiographical evolution- by
presupposing Western supremacism. Guha identifies the problem clearly
when he counterposes Hegel\'s characterization of world history with
what is historically entailed in the production of that world history.
Thus, quoting Hegel, world history moves on a higher plane than that to
which morality properly belongs \.... The deeds of great men who are
individuals of world history . .. appear justified not only in their
inner significance \... but also in a secular sense.26 In this way, the
historical function and purpose of the imperial nation or state is
presented as already peculiar and elevated and not prone to the limiting
conditions and considerations that characterize the subordinate. What
does this abstraction mean concretely? Imperialism is author of history,
author of law, author of historical subject, author of indictment,
author of judgment. For example, \"By inventing a universal humanity and
endowing this juridical abstraction with inalienable rights, it absolved
Europe of crimes both past and future ,\" Bess is opines before asking
whether \"Enlightenment thought, like storm-bearing Clouds, already
carries future horrors within it, formulating the limits of universality
in such a way as to make Europe its sole guardian?\"27 Correspondingly,
Guha argues that [[from the point of view of those left out of
World-history]{.mark} [this]{.mark} advice amounts [to
**condoning**]{.mark}]{.underline} precisely such \" world-hi storical
deeds\"-[[the **rape of continents, the destruction of cultures, the
poisoning of the environment**]{.underline}]{.mark}-as helped \" [[the
great men]{.mark} who \[were\] [the individuals of world
history]{.mark}\" [to build empires and trap their subject
populations]{.mark}]{.underline} in what in the pseudo-historical
language of imperialism could describe as Prehistory.28 [Imperial rule
makes itself known as imperial rule through the power of universalizing
its own story and **self-validating its own story**]{.underline}. The
twin of this is to deprive the subordinated of the capacity to tell
their own story and to determine an alternative legitimation and
self-validation. (33-4)

## Case

### Solvency Ext -- Generic/Academics

#### Fem IR bottom up approach is superior--- It avoid the pitfalls of state cooptation

[In contrast to an ontology that depicts states as individualistic
autonomous actors]{.underline}, typical of conventional social science
perspectives on international relations, and of liberal thinking more
generally, [[fem]{.mark}inist [ontologies are grounded in social
relations that are constituted by historically unequal political,
economic, and social structures]{.mark}.]{.underline} Whereas
conventional international relations theory usually starts its analyses
at the structural level, seeing a world of states, [**[feminists employ
a bottom-up strategy]{.mark}**, starting from the lives of individuals
and their relationships]{.underline}. Focusing much of its attention on
the behavior of great powers, international relations depicts states as
like units whose internal behavior is not necessary to understanding
their international behavior in an anarchical system. Working from the
local to the global, feminists begin from the lives of individuals,
[[examining how they are situated in]{.underline}]{.mark} historically
[[gendered and racialized social and economic structures]{.mark} and how
these]{.underline} unequal [structures impact their lives]{.underline}.
[They connect the lives of individuals to international structures [and
proposals for more just]{.mark} and equal **[forms of global
governance]{.mark}**]{.underline}. These proposals were evident in the
Hague women's call for an International Court of Justice in 1915; they
were present also in WPS advocates' call for an International Criminal
Court in the 1990 and a reformed UN today (see Chappell 2016). Rather
than seeing states as "like units," [feminists see "gendered
states,"]{.underline} although this gendering manifests in quite
different ways, given geopolitical locations and intersecting identities
and inequalities (see Parashar, Tickner, and True 2018; Peterson 1992).

Jane Addams' settlement movement reflected this distinct feminist
ontology---starting from social relations rather than the system level
of relations between states (Waltz 1979). Comprised of immigrants from
various countries, Hull House was a cosmopolitan microcosm of the world,
where residents learned to live together in spite of their differences.
Addams described the settlement founders as "experimenters." However,
unlike the scientific approach to conducting natural experiments, where
the researcher stands at a distance from the object of study to generate
empirically verifiable knowledge, the settlement residents thought of
themselves as both the knowers and the known of the experiment. Similar
to feminist methodology today[, the process of working together to
explore new ideas for crosscultural cooperation]{.underline}
[was]{.underline} judged as [more meaningful than research findings that
could withstand falsification]{.underline}. "Truth" in Hull House, in
WWI women's peace activism, and in [[i]{.mark}nternational
[r]{.mark}elations [feminism]{.mark} today [is always **provisional**,
open to and shaped by human relations]{.mark} and
experience.]{.underline}

The settlement movement and women's transnational peace activism of the
early twentieth century foreshadowed WPS feminist activism today. Over
the past thirty years, [dialogues between women from different conflict
zones have been brokered by women's International NonGovernmental
Organizations (INGOs)]{.underline} that, together with feminist
scholars, played such an important role in getting the UNSC to adopt the
resolutions that comprise the WPS agenda (Cockburn 1998; Giles and
Hyndman 2004). [These efforts]{.underline} exemplify the feminist
pragmatist method, [amplify]{.underline}ing [the voices of refugee and
displaced women and survivors]{.underline} of conflict-related SGBV [by
bringing them to international fora to share their practical knowledge
of how best to protect vulnerable populations and enable their
participation]{.underline}. Most recently, solidarity dialogues
facilitated by the WILPF and the Swedish women's rights organization,
Kvinna til Kvinna, involved bringing together women from Syria and
Bosnia, and from Bosnia and Ukraine, to learn from one another's
experiences of conflict and postconflict (WILPF 2014; 2015). These
[[dialogues]{.underline}]{.mark} have [[enable]{.underline}]{.mark}d
[women [activists to analyze and learn from what works in their
comparative experiences, in order to plan and implement a human rights
and social justice--informed platform to end conflict and build
peace]{.mark}]{.underline}. Like many of the WWI peace activists, these
activists from conflict zones argue that an egalitarian and lasting
peace requires the elimination of gender oppression and injustice. In
other examples, women's INGOs, coordinated by the NGO working group on
WPS, have brought women activists from conflict zones to brief UNSC
members on their analysis of the conflict, their experiences of
insecurity, and the peace-building challenges they are confronting on
the ground (Cook 2016).30

[It is significant]{.underline}, however, that, [[in spite of this
ongoing activism]{.mark} inside interstate institutions]{.underline},
[highlighting "truths" about conflict from local
experiences]{.underline}, [[the]{.underline}]{.mark} earlier
[[commitment]{.underline}]{.mark} of WWI women's peace activists
[[to]{.underline}]{.mark} complete disarmament **[[and regulating the
global arms]{.underline}]{.mark}** industry [[has mostly disappeared
from today's]{.underline}]{.mark} WPS [[agenda]{.mark}.]{.underline}
[[This illustrates a feminist pragmatic choice of what issues can best
be pursued through international institutions]{.mark}
today]{.underline}. But it also [**[exposes the lack of compatibility
between the ontologies of feminist peace and the state
system]{.mark}**.]{.underline}

In all these examples, [[feminist knowledge]{.mark} emerges from
practice]{.underline} and vice versa, to inform further strategy,
advocacy, and theorizing about how to build positive peace. [The
[challenge]{.mark} for **[i]{.mark}**nternational **[r]{.mark}**elations
scholarship]{.underline} [is **to make visible and recover this
alternative**, feminist tradition of knowledge about peace and war.
Whose knowledge is remembered and whose is forgotten, and how ideas are
put into practice]{.underline} or sustained and built on in the academy,
[are as much a feature of global power politics as are relations among
states]{.underline}. When early feminists were writing, women did not
yet have the right to vote and were barred from many institutions of
higher learning and research. As a result, Addams and other feminists
who were thinking and writing on pragmatist approaches to peace could
not directly shape the international relations discipline that emerged
after WWI. That task has passed to contemporary feminists to excavate
this knowledge as they have developed feminist international relations.
[[Feminists have adopted a]{.underline}]{.mark} similar [grounded
approach]{.underline}, asking questions about "where are the women in
international politics" (Enloe 2014) [and forging an [ontology of global
politics from the personal to the international]{.mark}.]{.underline}
Such an approach involves including the experiences of communities most
disempowered, such as conflict affected women and girls, all the way to
the structures and institutions of global governance.

#### Academics should critically investigate arms control theory

21st Century: Controlling the Means of Violence in Reconceptualising
Arms Control: Controlling the Means of Violence, ed. Cooper & Mutimer

The period between 1960 and 19[[61]{.underline} [saw the emergence
of]{.underline}]{.mark} some of the [[key texts upon which Cold War arms
control]{.mark} **practice and [theory]{.mark}** [was
built]{.mark}]{.underline}. This included the Daedalus special issue on
arms control of 1960, Schelling and Halperin's Strategy and Arms
Control, and Hedley Bull's The Control of the Arms Race both of which
appeared in 1961.1 The same year also witnessed the publication of
Donald Brennan's edited book, Arms Control, Disarmament and National
Security, based on the articles in the earlier special issue of
Daedalus.2 The influence of the Daedalus publication in particular is
reflected in the journal's production of further special issues on arms
control in 1975 and 1991 each of which reviewed progress on the agenda
of the 1960 publication and assessed the new arms control challenges
emerging on its fifteenth and thirtieth anniversary respectively.3
[Given the fiftieth anniversary]{.underline} of the Daedalus special
issue has only just passed and that the same landmark has now been
reached for the other publications[, [it is an apposite time
to]{.mark}]{.underline} once again [[review the arms control
agenda]{.underline}]{.mark} of the 1960s, [to consider new practices
that have emerged s]{.underline}ince then [and]{.underline} to [ask
whether either are fit for purpose in a post-Cold War, post-9/11
era]{.underline}, apparently replete with new arms control challenges.
Over and above the question of timeliness however, the production of
this special issue was animated by our concern that [[the]{.mark}
[academic community has largely been reduced]{.mark}]{.underline}, on
the one hand, [[to recording the new practices or]{.mark} [challenges of
arms control]{.mark}]{.underline} (although often using language other
than that of arms control), [[rather than **shaping the former or
anticipating the latter**]{.underline}]{.mark}. On the other hand, [[it
has engaged in an extensive reconceptualization of
security]{.underline}]{.mark} and its associated practices [[that
has]{.underline}]{.mark}, nevertheless[, [managed to pay scant attention
to]{.mark}]{.underline} questions of [a[rms and their
control]{.mark}]{.underline}. [[Instead]{.underline}]{.mark}, it has
tended to be **[[the policy]{.underline}]{.mark}** or NGO
**[[community]{.underline}]{.mark}** that [[has driven new
agendas]{.underline}]{.mark} in arms control [[rather than the
academy]{.underline}]{.mark}. Moreover, [[given the predominantly
**problem-solving orientation**]{.underline} [of academic arms
control]{.underline}]{.mark}, [[there has not even
been]{.mark}]{.underline} much that can be described as **[[an attempt
to critically reflect on the relationship between current practice and
traditional arms control theory]{.mark},]{.underline}** [on the security
**framings underlying current policies**]{.underline} [or on the
functions served by the current global architecture of arms
control]{.underline}. In part, this may reflect one of the downsides of
the widening and deepening of security studies that has occurred since
the 1980s, which has arguably resulted in relatively less attention
being paid by more critical analysts to some of those areas normally
associated with the thinner and shallower notion of security held in
traditional security or strategic studies. (1)

[[violence against men]{.underline}]{.mark}. Men mostly kill each other,
inside and outside of conflict. A big part of this is about preserving
or protecting their masculinity---a masculinity that makes male bodies
more expendable. Women and children, obnoxiously lumped together in
countless resolutions and reports, are more likely be deemed "innocent
civilians," while men are more likely be to be considered militants or
combatants. In conflict, civilian men are often targeted---or counted in

### Impx Ext---War inevitable

#### Global politics centered around masculine IR means war inevitable

the War on Terror at The University of New South Wales. She currently

Oxford University Press, Pg 7-8)

The masculinity of the state and its role in the global arena is central
to mainstream theorizing about security and international politics. For
example, [Francis Fukuyama highlighted the tension between gender
equality and militarism when he warned that the breakdown of sex
segregation in the military would be dangerous. He saw the world as
requiring a toughness and aggression in international politics that
would be undermined by a female presence in the military]{.underline}
(Fukuyama 1998). His analysis has been critiqued by feminists who point
to the gendered and racialized underpinnings of his understanding of
international politics. [[Fukuyama's assessment of the world is
undergirded by the assumption that global politics is inevitably driven
by competing masculinities, and security is threatened by
femininities]{.underline}]{.mark}. As Barbara Ehrenreich writes, this
world view indicates a concern that "the female, and hence over-kindly,
heads of state who arise in the northern democracies will be a poor
match for the macho young males whom he expects to dominate the south"
(1999, 122). There is an intersection between gender and race here that
is reflected in a masculinist concern for protecting the feminine (read
female political leaders) from the uncontrolled, immature, and
threatening masculinities of the global South, embodied in "Slobodan
Milosevic, Saddam Hussein, and Mobutu Sese Seko" (Tickner 1999, 6).
Further, these views not only serve to fuel questions about the
legitimacy of women in international politics but also work to justify
broader mainstream (realist and neorealist). [[I]{.mark}nternational
[R]{.mark}elations [perspectives that reinforce "polarized views of the

versus zones of turmoil]{.mark}" (Tickner 1999, 5).]{.underline} [In
[this worldview,]{.mark} the [feminization of world politics would
ultimately leave the West vulnerable in a world that is assumed
inevitably to be centered on masculine states and groups vying for
pow]{.mark}er.]{.underline} To be concerned with security then does not
simply focus on the identification of an external threat but also
involves the construction of the self and state identity (Campbell
1992). Identity creation can be seen as binary, whereby the self is
created only by reference to the Other. [[Militarism]{.mark}, while it
might be [thought to function]{.mark} [as]{.mark} a mechanism [to ensure
security and avoid war]{.mark}, [actually "sustains a war-like peace
that revolves not only around preparation for collective conflict but
also around a war-like politics"]{.mark} (Elshtain and Tobias 1990,
x).]{.underline} Militarism requires the construction and (re)production
of seemingly immutable and fixed identities of us, placed in opposition
to them, with which military personnel as well as civilians are
encouraged to identify. [The interplay between nationalism (the carving
out of us vis-à-vis the Other) and militarism (which conceives of a
world under constant threat) transforms the Others into enemies, and the
(re)production of enemy Others perpetuates the need for
militarism.]{.underline} Thus, there is a nexus between militarism, war,
and (in)security that requires some interrogation of the ways
representations and narratives based on gendered assumptions function as
discourses that make it necessary to engage in war and militarism to
ensure security.

[The idea that the U.S. military-industrial complex can be
pro-women]{.underline} is not just an internal rebranding exercise: It
[is used to justify disastrous U.S. military interventions around the
world.]{.underline} In his book Ideal Illusions, historian James Peck
shows how this is part of a larger trend that developed during the Cold
War when, as an anti-communist strategy, [the United States revamped its
image as the human rights protector]{.underline} of the world [to
justify its military empire]{.underline}. [The U.S. claim that
it]{.underline} uniquely [protects women's rights was part of this
larger picture.]{.underline}

[The George W. Bush administration]{.underline} famously [justified the
war in Afghanistan by arguing that it would rescue women from the
Taliban.]{.underline} On Nov. 17, 2001, [Laura Bush]{.underline} gave
the president's weekly radio address, [proclaim]{.underline}ing, "Afghan
women know, through hard experience, what the rest of the world is
discovering: [the brutal oppression of women is a central goal of the
terrorists]{.underline}." Media outlets dutifully followed suit: In
2010, Time ran a cover showing "Bibi Aisha" with her nose cut off, with
the headline, "What Happens If We Leave Afghanistan." Of course, [the

pundits [who popularized the rhetoric of "saving women"]{.underline} are
forced to [answer]{.underline} to [how this war has actually
harmed---and killed---women in Afghanistan.]{.underline}

[The 2011 bombing of Libya was cheered as the first U.S. war led by
women]{.underline}, as noted by The Daily Beast, which reported that
"\[t\]he Libyan airstrikes mark the first time in U.S. history that a
female-dominated diplomatic team has urged military action." [The fact
that command of the Libya air strategy was given to a woman]{.underline}
officer [was]{.underline} also [celebrated]{.underline} in The Guardian
[as "a boost to women in the]{.underline} US [military who complain
daily about discrimination]{.underline}." Are these celebrated woman
architects of war required to answer to today's nightmarish conditions
in Libya where Black people are now bought and sold in open-air slave
markets? [Do cheerleaders of the intervention]{.underline} actually
[examine whether U.S. military intervention]{.underline} in Libya, or
anywhere, [leads to improved conditions for women?]{.underline}

[Narratives about saving women are also prevalent in the U.S. War on
ISIS]{.underline}. While there is no doubt that women face horrific
treatment at the hands of ISIS, [rape, enslavement and abuse has been
used to justify a brutal U.S. bombing campaign that has caused thousands
of civilian deaths in Syria and Iraq]{.underline} and relaxed standards
for killing civilians in both countries---opening the door to more
civilian deaths. Meanwhile, [atrocities against women perpetrated by
U.S. ally Saudi Arabia go unpunished,]{.underline} revealing that the
need to protect women is contingent on U.S. geopolitical interests.

[These tropes]{.underline} are not new. They [come from]{.underline} the
playbook of [U.S. and Western European colonization,]{.underline} in
which [colonizers argue that their presence helps women, and their exit
would do them grave harm]{.underline}. In just one example, Lord Cromer,
who was the British consul general in Egypt from 1883 to 1907, cited the
veil---and women's well-being---to argue Egyptians should be forcibly
civilized. "The position of women in Egypt, and Mohammedan countries
generally, is, therefore a fatal obstacle to the attainment of that
elevation of thought and character which should accompany the
introduction of Western civilisation," he once declared. Yet, as
feminist scholar Leila Ahmed has pointed out, at the same time Cromer
was railing against the veil, he was agitating in favor of the
subordination of women in England, as a leader of the Men's League for
Opposing Women's Suffrage.

In her work, "A vocabulary for feminist praxis: on war and radical

articulates a bold vision for feminism[. "This more radical feminism is

assume that democracy requires capitalism]{.underline}, a feminism that
is bold and willing to take risks[, a feminism that fights for women's
rights while simultaneously recognizing the pitfalls of the formal
'rights' structure of capitalist democracy."]{.underline}

According to Christine Ahn, the founder of Women Cross DMZ, a global
network of women mobilizing to end the Korean War, "[Celebrating the
rise of women in these institutions of domination, whether Pentagon
contractors like Lockheed Martin or the CIA (which has been responsible
for secret torture programs and covert overthrows of democratic regimes

#### Gendered violence is rooted in the US military -- impossible be liberated from a system that refuses to recognize the violence

[U.S. military intervention is particularly bad for women]{.underline}:
**[It remains deeply interconnected to sexual and gender
violence]{.underline}**, for people in the military, for military
spouses, and for people living in or near the estimated 1,000 U.S.
military bases around the world or where U.S. military actions occur.
[From Japan to the Philippines, local populations have long protested
the presence of the U.S. military---and the environmental destruction
and sexual violence it brings.]{.underline}

[The impacts of war---such as reduction in basic services, electricity,
and access to food and water, loss of family members, and increased
rates of illness and disability---**all increase women's vulnerability
to assault and worsen the conditions of women's labor.**]{.underline}
Women are predominantly responsible for caring for sick and disabled
people, children and elders---and the conditions for doing that work
worsen severely in war conditions. [The U.S. military is also the
largest polluter in the world. It is difficult to argue that its
activities are "good for women" when it contributes to climate change
and the poisoning of air, water and land that endangers all
people.]{.underline}

[The U.S. military is also profoundly violent towards women within its
own rank]{.underline}s. According to Veterans Affairs records, 1,307,781
outpatient visits took place at the VA for Military Sexual Trauma
(MST)-related care in 2015. [Approximately 38 percent of female and 4
percent of male military personnel and veterans]{.underline} have
experienced Military Sexual Trauma[---a euphemism for rape or sexual
assault. Research reveals that 40 percent of women homeless veterans
have experienced sexual assault in the military]{.underline}. (Far less
is known or publicly reported about the U.S. military's sexual violence
against occupied peoples.)

**[Service members are punished for speaking out.]{.underline}** A
report from the Department of Defense finds [58 percent of women and 60
percent of men who report sexual assault face retaliation.]{.underline}
And 77 percent of retaliation reports alleged that retaliators were in
the reporter's chain of command. A third of victims are discharged after
reporting, typically within 7 months of making a report. [A report from
Harvard Law School's Veterans' clinic finds sexual assault victims
receive harsher discharges from the military, with 24 percent separated
under less than fully honorable conditions, compared to 15 percent of
all service members.]{.underline}

[Women who drop out of the military because they have been sexually
assaulted cannot rise through the ranks. The media portrayal of the
women who have climbed to the top of the military and intelligence
apparatuses,]{.underline} however, relies on bootstrap tough-it-up
narratives that implicitly victim-shame women, [often framing failure to
achieve what they did in terms of women's lack of confidence that
creates obstacles to their success.]{.underline} Lynn Dugle, CEO of
Englity and former CEO of Raytheon, tells Politico, "One of my biggest
challenges has been resisting the temptation to tell myself I couldn't
do something. I didn't think I was ready to be president of a
multibillion-dollar business at Raytheon when I was offered the role. I
continually remind myself to have courage and confidence."

Wendt, Alexander.is Mershon Professor of International Security and
Professor of Political Science at The Ohio State University. He received
his PhD in 1989 from the University of Minnesota, and before coming to
OSU in 2004 had taught previously at Yale University, Dartmouth College,
and the University of Chicago.Wendt is interested in philosophical
aspects of social science, with special reference to international
relations. He is the author of several well-known journal articles, as
well as Social Theory of International Politics (Cambridge, 1999), which
in 2006 received the International Studies Association award for "Best
Book of the Decade" in the field. In the 2013 TRIP survey of 1400
International Relations scholars he was named as the most influential
scholar in the field over the past 20 years. \"Constructing
International Politics.\" International Security 20, no. 1 (1995): 71.
doi:10.2307/2539217.

[[The descriptive issue is]{.mark} the [extent]{.mark} to which states
engage in practices [of realpolitik]{.mark} (warfare, balancing,
relative-gains seeking[) versus accepting the rule of law]{.mark} and
institutional constraints on their autonomy [States sometimes do engage
in power politics, but this hardly describes]{.mark} all of the
[past]{.mark} 1300 [years]{.mark}, and [even less today]{.mark}, when
[most states follow most international law most of the time,]{.mark}15
and when [war and security dilemmas are the exception]{.mark} rather
than the rule, [Great Powers no longer]{.mark} tend to [conquer small
ones]{.mark}, and [free trade is expanding rather than
contracting]{.mark}.16 The relative [frequency of realpolitik, how-
ever, has nothing to do with \"realism.\" Realism should be seen as an
explana- tion of realpolitik, not a description of it]{.mark}.
Conflating the two makes it impossible to tell how well the one explains
the other, and leads to the tautology that war makes realism true.
[Realism does not have a monopoly on the ugly and brutal side of
international life. Even if we agree on a realpolitik description, we
can reject a realist explanation. The explanatory issue is why states
engage in war or peace.]{.mark} Mearsheimer\'s portrayal of
constructivist \"causal logic\" on this issue is about 30 percent right.
The logic has two elements, structure and agency]{.underline}. On the
one hand, construc-tivist theorizing tries to show how the social
structure of a system makes actions possible by constituting actors with
certain identities and interests, and material capabilities with certain
meanings. [[Missing from Mearsheimer\'s ac- count is]{.mark} the
constructivist [emphasis on how agency and interaction produce and
reproduce structures of shared knowledge over time]{.mark}.
S]{.underline}ince it is not possi- ble here to discuss the various
dynamics through which this process takes place,17 let me illustrate
instead. And since Mearsheimer does not offer a neorealist explanation
for inter-state cooperation, conceding that terrain to
institutionalists, let me focus on the \"hard case\" of why states
sometimes get into security dilemmas and war, that is, why they
sometimes engage in real- politik behavior.

### 2AC AT: Fem IR fails

#### Post-structuralist feminism good

\--gender is constructed thru social exchange... "refer to as given"

**Khalid 14**

(Maryam Khalid recently completed her Ph.D. on gender, orientalism, and
the War on Terror at The University of New South Wales. She currently
teaches in politics and law at Macquarie University, and her current
research focuses on gender, race, and international relations, "Feminist
perspectives on militarism and war: Critiques, contradictions, and
collusions,"
https://www.oxfordhandbooks.com/view/10.1093/oxfordhb/9780199943494.001.0001/oxfordhb-9780199943494-e-006,
Oxford University Press, pg 3)

Standpoint feminism interrogates this type of research agenda by
conceptualizing the state as a "set of patriarchal practices" and
through uncovering the impacts of these practices on "real living women"
(Hansen 2010, 21). In this approach, [[gender]{.mark} [is constructed
through social understandings of masculinity and
femininity.]{.mark}]{.underline} However, standpoint feminism
presupposes that biological sex is given, and it is only gender as
masculinity and femininity that is socially and culturally constructed.
[[Poststructuralist feminists]{.mark} [point out that this would be to
"refer to a 'given' sex or a 'given' gender without first inquiring into
how sex and/or gender is given"]{.mark} (Butler 1990, 6). As such,
[poststructuralist feminists seek to interrogate both the biological and
social as constructe]{.mark}]{.underline}[d]{.mark}. [This approach
views sex and gender as discursive constructions, [meaning that they are
not intrinsically fixed or binary (]{.mark}e.g., transgender and
transsexual categories complicate the binary).]{.underline} As Judith
Butler explains, gender is not simply the cultural construction and
inscription of meaning onto a pregiven sex but should be seen as "the
very apparatus of production whereby the sexes themselves are
established" (1990, 7). Christine Sylvester argues that this means that
men and women are not prediscursive but rather that they are "the
stories that have been told about 'men' and 'women'" (1994, 4[). In this
sense, [gender is more than simply "a noun (i.e., an identity]{.mark})
and a verb (i.e., a way to look at the world ...), but also a logic
which is produced by and productive of the ways in which we understand
and perform global politics"]{.underline} (Shepherd 2010, 5). [Gender is
thus a set of relations of power]{.underline}, and this understanding
informs the chapter as a whole. The latter part of the chapter explores
the power of gender as a discursive/regulatory mechanism in reference to
the Wars on Terror in Afghanistan and Iraq. These examples demonstrate
the function of gender as discourse, in terms of its power to
(re)produce and naturalize particular (dominant/hegemonic) notions of
what it means to be masculine and feminine and to attach them to sexed
bodies. Reading gender into militarism, and understanding militarism as
configured by gendered logics, thus entails viewing gender as
encompassing not only men and women but also masculinities,
femininities, sex, and sexuality as constructed and contingent. Thus[,
[understanding how militarism is gendered requires inquiring into the
ways men and women come to be considered as such and how processes of
gendering and militarism are interconnected]{.mark}, often leading to
the violence of war and other military activities.]{.underline}
Feminists have shown that patriarchal and sexist institutions and
structures are hallmarks of highly militarized societies (Reardon 1996).
Militarized states and societies are shaped around the notion that
social stability is best achieved through hierarchical gender relations
typical of military institutions and practices. Indeed, gendered
relations of power are (re)produced beyond state institutions. For
example, [the heterosexual male-headed family unit has been a vital part
of the defense of the nation and its security interests in militarized
societies]{.underline} (Horn 2010, 59--60). Social acceptance of war and
state violence as necessary is (re)produced in nonstate or military
arenas through the glorification of war, the valorization of aggressive
masculinities, and the presentation of these as natural and necessary.
[Cynthia [Enloe points out that militarism "affects not just the
executives and factory floor workers who make fighter planes,]{.mark}
landmines and intercontinental missiles, [but also the employees of food
companies, toy companies, c]{.mark}lothing companies, film studios,
stock brokerages and advertising agencies" (2000, 2). Thus, [the
language, ideas, and relationships associated with militarism operate in
the]{.mark} seemingly [mundane]{.mark}, apolitical, and
[everyday.]{.mark} Sports and other competitive activities demonstrate
this, employing references to the annihilation and obliteration of the
Other.]{.underline} [[Enloe's interrogation]{.mark} of the reasoning
behind the decision to add weapons-shaped pasta to Heinz canned soup
[points to the unproblematized acceptance of militarized imagery]{.mark}
far beyond military institutions (Enloe 2000). War, aggression, and
violence are presented as an innate expression of masculinity by male
bodies in popular culture.]{.underline}

<https://plato.stanford.edu/archives/sum2019/entries/feminism-ethics/>

Critics of utilitarianism include those who specifically resist the
expectation of [[utilitarian]{.mark} impartiality]{.underline}, insofar
as impartiality [in [decision-making ignores]{.mark} emotional
connections or personal relationships with particular
beings]{.underline}. **[[Feminists]{.underline}]{.mark}** have advanced
criticisms of impartiality from the points of view of care ethics
(Noddings 1984; Held 2006; Ruddick 1989), ecofeminist or environmental
ethics (Adams 1990; Donovan 1990; George 1994; Warren 2000), and
analytical social ethics (Baier 1994; Friedman 1994). [[Impartiality may
yield implausible requirements to value the well-being of all
equally]{.mark} regardless of one's commitments, material circumstances
in a nonideal world, or obligations of caring]{.underline} (Walker 1998;
Walker 2003). [[Impartiality]{.mark} as a desirable quality of moral
agents may overly idealize moral agency]{.underline} (Tessman 2015) [or
tacitly [presume a biased perspective in favor of]{.mark} adult,
racially privileged, [masculine agents in a formal or public
sphere]{.mark} whose decisions are unencumbered by relationships of
unequal power]{.underline} (Kittay 1999).

Some [[feminists criticize consequentialism for failing to capture the
qualitatively problematic nature of oppressions that are not reducible
to harms]{.underline}]{.mark} (Frye 1983; Card 1996; Young 2009). For
example, **[[Card argues]{.underline}]{.mark}** **[[that even if certain
behavior does not produce more harm than good, its symbolism could
violate one's dignity]{.underline}]{.mark}**. Her example is the case of
women being barred from Harvard's Lamont Law library even when helpful
male classmates provided them photocopies of course readings (2002,
104--105). Card also objects on Rawlsian grounds that the wrongness of
slavery was not the balance of benefits and harms, contra
consequentialism, but the fact that trade-offs could never justify
slavery (2002, 57).

### 2AC AT: Consequentialism Good

#### Consequentialism demands optimization -- strategy + seemingly indirect paths towards achieving goals are most effective

**Guay 05**

Robert Guay, PhD in philosophy from University of Chicago, Associate
Professor of Philosophy at Binghamton Universtiy, \"A Refutation of
Consequentialism,\" Metaphilosophy, Vol. 36, No. 3 (April 2005), pp.
349-351

Consequentialism demands optimization. [[It is not enough to make
everyone better off]{.mark},]{.underline} with whatever meaning one
assigns to this phrase. [The very best possible outcome must come to
pass]{.underline}; [otherwise the antecedent action is morally
defective]{.underline}.3 Presumably, then, it is not enough for each
individual action to be optimific relative to its contemporaneous
alternatives. That is, [it seems possible that a series of optimific
actions could produce a worse outcome than an entirely different,
incompatible sequence of actions]{.underline}. A consequentialist theory
of right action is thus subject to what might be called a global
consistency requirement: that is, [a present right action cannot
preclude a remotely available course of action with an even better
outcome or outcomes]{.underline}. 1 call it a consistency requirement
merely to emphasize that [the range of outcomes relevant to assessment
cannot be arbitrarily restricted.]{.underline}

[[We can imagine situations in which]{.underline}]{.mark}, at various
intervals, [[one does the very best that one can but still falls into a
terrible]{.mark}]{.underline} and avoidable [[mess]{.underline}]{.mark}:
starting down the wrong path may have very distant, but very dire,
consequences. [Such situations illustrate the distinction between
tactics]{.underline}, [in which available means are employed to achieve
immediate ends, and strategy, in which]{.underline} seemingly
**[[indirect routes are the best means to achieve long-range
ends]{.mark}.]{.underline}** An analogous situation arises in the
Prisoner\'s Di lemma. There of course the inconsistency between
suboptimal outcome and seemingly optimific actions stems from the
interpersonal feature of the situation, rather than a temporal feature.
But either way, [[a poor outcome could be the result of apparently
correct actions]{.underline}]{.mark}. Against this, a global consistency
requirement insists that [an action must be not only tactically correct
but also compatible with what is strategically optimific]{.underline}.

Of course, one can say that tactical actions are not in fact optimific
when they conflict with a better strategy; [the agent ideally, with
perfect knowledge of present and future contingencies and ability to
coordinate with others, would take all strategic possibilities into
account]{.underline}. But this would just be to say that global
consistency is an ineliminable component of consequentialism. In any
case, whatever the relation between global consistency and
consequentialism, **[[it is]{.underline}]{.mark}** nonetheless **[[hard
to see how consequentialism could sanction the actions that lead to a
suboptimal outcome]{.underline}]{.mark}**.4 To do so would categorically
privilege action in a way that qualifies the moral import of the good.
If reasons for action in a specified context were the matter to be
evaluated, then there would perhaps be some leeway to limit the scope of
examination to the tactical possibilities available in a particular
situation. But this cannot be the case with a consequentialist standard
of right. [**[The best possible outcome must serve as the rigid moral
touchstone]{.mark}**.]{.underline}

This should provoke one early question: When is the best outcome? Apart
from a Day of Reckoning, [**[causal chains do not simply come to an
end]{.mark}**. [Our short-term actions sometimes have long-term or
long-distance effects]{.mark}]{.underline}, so to measure the
consequences of our actions, we need to specify a finish line. Not all
finish lines are the same: it is of course generally not the case that
the best outcome with respect to time t is compatible with the best
outcome with respect to any other time. A great achievement in the
future might be possible only at the expense of our immediate good;
sloth might be the best we can hope for tomorrow and the day after but
be incompatible with something better next year. [Even if we measure the
good]{.underline} in a manner similar to that recommended by Bentham,
[as accumulating over time as the product of intensity and duration, the
same incompatibility arises. One path to take might leave us better off
in the long run but not catch up with an alternative until very, very
far in the future]{.underline}. And [[one cannot simply say that one
should always look to the long run, because the long run has no end;
that would leave the moral assessment of our actions infinitely
deferred]{.underline}]{.mark}. But I leave this aside for now, because
it is the sort of thing that can be answered by stipulation, however
arbitrarily.

[U.S. military intervention is particularly bad for women: It remains
deeply interconnected to sexual and gender violence, for people in the
military, for military spouses, and for people living in or near the
estimated 1,000 U.S. military bases around the world]{.underline} or
where U.S. military actions occur. From Japan to the Philippines, local
populations have long protested the presence of the U.S. military---and
the environmental destruction and sexual violence it brings.

[The impacts of war]{.underline}---such as reduction in basic services,
electricity, and access to food and water, loss of family members, and
increased rates of illness and disability---[all increase women's
vulnerability to assault and worsen the conditions of women's labor.
Women are predominantly responsible for caring for sick and disabled
people, children and elders]{.underline}---and [the conditions for doing
that work worsen]{.underline} severely [in war conditions]{.underline}.
The U.S. military is also the largest polluter in the world. It is
difficult to argue that its activities are "good for women" when it
contributes to climate change and the poisoning of air, water and land
that endangers all people.

[The U.S. military is also profoundly violent towards women within its
own ranks]{.underline}. According to Veterans Affairs records, 1,307,781
outpatient visits took place at the VA for Military Sexual Trauma
(MST)-related care in 2015. [Approximately 38 percent of female and 4
percent of male military personnel and veterans have
experienced]{.underline} Military Sexual Trauma---a euphemism for [rape
or sexual assault]{.underline}. Research reveals that [40 percent of
women homeless veterans have experienced sexual assault in the
military.]{.underline} (Far less is known or publicly reported about the
U.S. military's sexual violence against occupied peoples.)

Service members are punished for speaking out. A report from the
Department of Defense finds [58 percent of women and 60 percent of men
who report sexual assault face retaliation.]{.underline} And 77 percent
of retaliation reports alleged that retaliators were in the reporter's
chain of command. [A third of victims are discharged after
reporting]{.underline}, typically within 7 months of making a report. A
report from Harvard Law School's Veterans' clinic finds [sexual assault
victims receive harsher discharges from the military, with 24 percent
separated under less than fully honorable conditions]{.underline},
compared to 15 percent of all service members.

[Women who drop out of the military because they have been sexually
assaulted cannot rise through the ranks]{.underline}. [The media
portrayal of the women who have climbed to the top of]{.underline} the
[military and intelligence apparatuses]{.underline}, however, [relies
on]{.underline} bootstrap tough-it-up [narratives that]{.underline}
implicitly [victim-shame women]{.underline}, often [framing failure to
achieve what they did in terms of women's lack of
confidence]{.underline} that creates obstacles to their success. Lynn
Dugle, CEO of Englity and former CEO of Raytheon, tells Politico, "One
of my biggest challenges has been resisting the temptation to tell
myself I couldn't do something. I didn't think I was ready to be
president of a multibillion-dollar business at Raytheon when I was
offered the role. I continually remind myself to have courage and
confidence."

### 2AC AT Racism turn

#### No link and we solve the impact---Their understanding of fem IR doesn't take into account recent developments that center intersectionality within the feminist analysis

**Garkoti** 12/12/**17**

"Intersectionality and International Relations" by Pratha Garkoti is 22
years old student, currently pursuing masters in Gender Studies. She
finds it to be one of the best decisions she has taken so far.
<https://genderedpathwaystoeducation.wordpress.com/2017/12/12/intersectionality-and-international-relations/>

[[It is often misconstrued that]{.underline}]{.mark} International
Relations (**[[IR]{.underline}]{.mark}**) [[as a discipline deals only
with]{.mark} manly issues like realism, war, military]{.underline} and
soldiering; in other words -- [[issues that are
"masculine"]{.underline}]{.mark} which results in classifying this
discipline as a "men's club" ( (Enloe, 1989)\[1\]. This is also evident
from the fact that "most of the key players in this discipline-
diplomats, policymakers, academic professionals have been and still are-
males who come from patriarchal social and political backgrounds"
(Tickner, 1992), as a result of which we can see that this masculinized
and gendered discourse thrives on marginalizing and invisibilizing a
woman's work, worth and labour thereby making it hard for them to be
perceived as first-class citizens capable of holding positions of power
(Tickner, 1995). Therefore, there is a need to use gender as a category
for analyzing international politics, and to recognize that "gender is
an integral, and not an accidental feature of the worldwide structure of
diplomatic, military and economic relations." (Parpart & Zalewski, 2008,
p. viii). Given the fact that gender as a perspective has made inroads
to law, health, medicine et al, it is high time that it is recognized,
acknowledged and included in this discipline of IR too because we should
not forget that while "gender is not a part of the core of International
Relations as a discipline, it most certainly both structures and is
structured by the practice of international politics." (Enloe, 2012)
Hence, the political salience of gender and gender identity should not
be underestimated in the study and practice of International Relations.

But the problem does not end just yet. [[The subjugation of
women]{.underline}]{.mark} that happens **[[does
not]{.mark}]{.underline}** and cannot ever **[[imply that all women are
equally oppressed]{.underline}]{.mark}** because in some ways or the
other, **[[parameters like class and race also creep
in]{.underline}]{.mark}**. While the feminist movement is made up of
millions of women trying to fight the patriarchy and misogyny, not all
those women experience the same levels of discrimination. **[[An
immigrant woman of colour might have to face not only sexism, but also
racism]{.underline}]{.mark}** in her struggle for success; something a
white woman from a privileged background has probably never experienced.
This is when '[[intersectionality']{.underline}]{.mark} comes to the
front. It [[developed as a feminist analytical tool to study the
imbrications of the various intersecting systems of
oppression]{.underline}]{.mark} [[and has become the **predominant way**
of conceptualizing the relation between systems of
oppression]{.underline}]{.mark} which construct our multiple identities
**[[and our social locations]{.underline}]{.mark}** in hierarchies of
power and privilege. (Ackerly & True, 2008)

(Simon, PhD, Geography@Ottawa, Critical Geopolitics and the Control of
Arms in the 21st Century in Reconceptualising Arms Control: Controlling
the Means of Violence, ed. Cooper & Mutimer)

[[Much]{.underline}]{.mark} obviously [[needs to be done in terms of the
arms trade]{.mark} and]{.underline} the possibilities of tackling
[proliferation]{.underline} in terms of the consequences for human
rights specifically and human security more generally.48 In borrowing
the slogan from the World Social Forum for this concluding section of
this essay[, [the argument returns to the possibility of
alternatives]{.underline}]{.mark}[,]{.underline} [not just where they
are usually investigated]{.underline} in the contemporary scholarly
engagements with activist movements and those getting arrested in
protests against various 'global' projects, **[but also in [the logics
of critical geopolitics challenging the terms of political
discourse]{.mark}]{.underline}** [[where it is frequently **most
seductive,**]{.underline} [in the **specification of contexts**
which]{.underline}]{.mark}, once so specified, **[[then apparently
require certain modes of conduct]{.underline}]{.mark}**.49 As Spiegel
and Le Billon suggest, [the invocation **of simple geopolitical
verities**]{.underline}, in their case **[a brutal regime]{.underline}**
(Mugabe's Zimbabwe), and **[[an evil arms
supplier]{.underline}]{.mark}** state (China), and [[heroic narratives
of resistance]{.underline}]{.mark} to the arms trade by South African
dock workers refusing to allow 'the ship of shame' to come into port to
unload weapons and ammunition, **[[run into much more complex
geographies when resistance is mobilized to political
violence]{.underline}]{.mark}**.50 The international trade of weapons
and the various financial organizations, shipping companies and other
agents involved in this case alone make the reality of global
interconnection much more complicated. [Political campaigns calling for
boycotts and]{.underline} international [sanctions]{.underline} [became
caught up in confusion and counter claims]{.underline}, all of [which
suggest]{.underline} to Spiegel and Le Billon **[[that larger questions
about complicity in violence]{.mark} and support of regimes that use
violence on their own populations need investigation]{.underline}**.
[Which [suggests]{.mark} once again [the importance of **larger
political movements** against war]{.mark}]{.underline}[, **[and the arms
trade in general]{.underline}** **[rather than particular campaigns
against particular]{.underline}**]{.mark} ships or
**[[shipments]{.underline}]{.mark}**. It is clear from this case that
when focussed only on Chinese actions resistance was quickly drawn into
geopolitical arguments and mutual recriminations, charges of hypocrisy
and malfeasance that did not help prevent the continued violence in
Zimbabwe. But what is clear in all this is the global interconnections
of politics, violence and a global public concerned, albeit
sporadically, about political violence are part of the current policy
picture. It is also clear that such civil society initiatives are a
fixture in the politics that President Obama discussed in Prague even
though there is no reason to assume that the protestors will support
American initiatives on weapons or disarmament. The [growing
interconnections]{.underline} and the potential for economic and
political cooperation now [suggest]{.underline} the [possibilities of
grappling with weapons]{.underline} issues and the technologies of
destruction in matters that are much **[more nuanced]{.underline}**
[than simple invocations of **virtue and perfidy residing in particular
states**]{.underline}. With clear rules for assistance, trading, and aid
in a crisis the possibilities of confrontation are reduced and the need
for complicated technological weapons reduced. Double standards and
self-serving attempts to use diplomacy as a means of strategic
competition by other means will no doubt persist for a long time to
come. If arms control is to be about more than this, then the
geopolitical contexts within which these debates take place need much
more attention. None of this suggests that pure 'enlightenment' where
all the political leaders suddenly come to their senses and decide to
come to common agreement over global problems is going to happen
imminently.51 But it does suggest that the changing context of
globalization presents opportunities to deal with numerous matters in a
more productive atmosphere where pressing problems of mutual interest
can be addressed. To do so requires, in the short run, tackling the
legacy of the War on Terror, with its remilitarization of international
politics. Continued American actions in Asia, while ostensibly
consistent with the nuclear free world eventually policy of the Obama
administration, nonetheless continue the military policies of his
predecessor. While Colin Gray may be correct in arguing that America is
the leading state on the planet for the foreseeable future, and can act
as hegemon in some ways, his warnings about overreach are more
especially germane to questions of how arms control and international
cooperation play out in coming years.52 The rise of Asian powers makes
it especially clear that there are limits to American capabilities, and
that arms control will have to recognize the geopolitical circumstances
of globalization and imminent problems of climate change, urbanization,
energy shortages, and numerous related issues. As some recent
commentators have suggested the [[shifting patterns of geopolitical
change are beginning to produce **alternative visions of arms
control**]{.underline}]{.mark} and disarmament, [ones]{.underline} that
are [not about American technological dominance and
surveillance]{.underline}, as in the Cold War model, [but]{.underline}
ones [of larger cooperative international arrangements and [regimes that
**do not rely on maintaining the existing geopolitical order**]{.mark}
**as it has come to be known**]{.underline}.53 The simple point that
most of the existing nuclear-armed states have been reluctant to give up
their nuclear weapons, while insisting that other states not acquire
them and conveniently ignoring those that have done so outside
international regimes, is not forgotten by many emerging states. It's
worth remembering that some of the peace activists in New Zealand in the
1980s, while advocating nuclear free zones, explicitly saw the spread of
weapons from metropolitan states as the threat that needed to be
contained. **[Geography matters greatly in how threats are
understood.]{.underline}** The initiative by Turkey and Brazil in May
2010 to defuse the standoff on the Iranian nuclear issues may only be
the beginning of diplomatic initiatives from the growing group of second
tier states, those Parag Khanna calls the second world.54 in light of
President Obama's speech in Prague where he insisted that people must
demand an end to nuclear weapons, there is a rich irony in how quickly
this particular initiative was dismissed in Washington and demands for
negotiations between Tehran, Washington and European states were
reiterated. American control of the agenda was apparently much more
important than an innovative solution, and one that would have
legitimized other states as actors on the arms control agenda worldwide.
[None of this is surprising if the **authoritarian pedagogue model based
on the American credo**]{.underline}, to once again invoke Andrew\'
Bacevich's formulation, [remains as the **dominant script of American
policy**]{.underline}. Nonetheless [the assumption that arms control can
remain a matter of control of arms by the major powers]{.underline} of
the Cold War era [is now\' clearly in doubt]{.underline}. Numerous
proposals for the reform of the United Nations Security\' Council imply
a refusal to allow the nuclear powers to dictate the terms of world
order in perpetuity. [The **geographical loci** of policy initiative
may]{.underline} indeed [shift in unpredictable w\'ays]{.underline}.
[Paying attention to the geopolitical world orders that rising powers
are seeking to shape, rather than operating within a simple geography of
the existing metropolitan states policing a world of peripheral dangers,
would be a most useful **start in thinking about innovation in policy
making**]{.underline}, [not to mention scholarly
analysis]{.underline}.[Facing challengers may be much less important in
the coming decades than facing challenges, whether it's from ecological
disruption, diseases, or simply economic instability.]{.underline} But
**[[continuing to pose policy options in terms of competitive state
actions is]{.mark} itself [the major obstacle to progress on
numerous]{.mark} pressing human security [issues and arms control in
particular]{.mark}]{.underline}**.55 [For the structural realists this
is the only game in town]{.underline}; **[[for the rest of us this game
is precisely the problem that needs to be
tackled]{.mark},]{.underline}** and while multilateral arms control is
but one of the many methods whereby the logic of that game might
continue to be effectively constrained, it has a role to play in
dissipating the dangerous political prejudices that Peter Kropotkin
warned about a long time ago.(50-2)

#### Our interpretation plus our solves all their impacts---several reasons 

#### a) Our interp sets a limit on critical affirmatives. Any affirmative that doesn't oppose Arms Sales isn't T.

#### b) zero lose of clash you still get all your anti-Arms Sale arguments.

#### c) only a permutation allows for our types of affirmatives but their interp doesn't allow for critical theory affirmatives the impact is the reduction of activism and research needed to challenge domination.

For all these developments, the human security agenda's take on war,

This paper recommends that [[those concerned with critical
thinking]{.underline}]{.mark} at the post-secondary level [[expand their
view consistent with advocates of educational reform in precollege
education]{.underline}]{.mark}. [Critical thinking]{.underline} at the
college level **[needs a paradigm more deeply rooted in the social and
moral requirements]{.underline}** of thinking in a complex world,
including a more critical look at prevailing practices. This requires,
first, that the normative force of educational reform through critical
thinking be made transparent in its application to post-secondary
education, and, second, that the theoretic weakness of prevailing
conception of informal logic be exposed.

This is a dangerous inquiry, for **[[informal logic has yielded a happy
compromise]{.underline}]{.mark}** for critical thinking advocates at the
college level. [Rather than explore the institutional and pedagogical
reasons that critical thinking is so rare among our
students]{.underline}, [[most critical thinking
advocates]{.underline}]{.mark} at the college level
[**[limit]{.underline}** [interventions to the safe
area]{.underline}]{.mark} of first-level courses, freeing other faculty
for business as usual. **[[But there is danger]{.mark} in the politics
of informal logic]{.underline}** based approaches as well. [[In their
search for **generality**]{.underline}]{.mark}, informal logic courses
look to available content, **[[usually short selections from the press
or popular essays]{.underline}]{.mark}** [that present issues freed from
the complexity]{.underline} of learning in the academic disciplines.
This opens such courses to the charge that in attempting to teach
available general rubrics applicable to non-academic, content **[[they
teach little of value]{.underline}]{.mark}** when contrasted with the
depth and breadth of information and skills included in the traditional
academic disciplines (See McPeck, 1981 for the classic statement of the
complaint).

Of course, limiting critical thinking to first level courses renders
such a charge less serious then it otherwise might be, but **[[the
cost]{.underline}]{.mark}** [[is the isolation of critical
thinking]{.underline}]{.mark} and informal logic skills and attitudes
[[from]{.underline}]{.mark} teaching across [[the]{.underline}]{.mark}
**[[subject areas]{.underline}]{.mark}**. And to the extent that the
underlying goals of **[[critical thinking are crucial to all learning
and its application]{.underline}]{.mark}**, and to the extent that
informal logic forms an essential part of the theory of inquiry, the
standard approach trivializes the project to inform thinking and
learning by the insights available from within both of these fields.

**[[The problem goes deeper]{.underline}]{.mark}**. Even **[[if
successful]{.underline}]{.mark}** to some degree, introductory level
critical thinking courses seen as requiring no more than the remediation
of student deficits [[enable]{.underline}]{.mark} self-serving
[[university departments]{.underline}]{.mark}, essential to the academic
industry of lowest level thinking skills courses, **[[to sidestep the
moral and epistemological critique of education]{.underline}]{.mark}**
found in the critical thinking movement, most notably, that of Harvey
Siegel, Richard Paul, and from critical theory, Henry Giroux (Siegel,
1988; Paul, 1990; Aronowitz and Giroux, 1991). Whether it is Siegel\'s
reminders of the rights of learners, Paul\'s emphasis on the moral and
social reflexiveness of \'strong-sense\' critical thinking, [[or
Giroux\'s concern with]{.underline}]{.mark} issues of
**[[domination]{.underline}]{.mark}**, critical thinking presents a
challenge to much that is standard in university instruction in North
America and perhaps elsewhere.

The Westernized Perspective of Forensics Currently, [[the polyethnic and
polycultural student population is comprised of various groups]{.mark}
(i.e. Blacks, Native Americans, Latin Americans, Asian Americans,
reentry, etc.) [with **unique, subjective and characteristic ways of
behaving, thinking, and communicating**]{.mark}]{.underline}. This is
significant in view of Albert and Triandis\' (1985) argument that
because cultural elements are functional \"[individuals who have
appropriate patterns and personalities for a particular environment will
fare well and will receive positive outcomes in that
environment]{.underline},\" but [[when \"individuals from one culture
are forced to adopt a very different cultural pattern\...they]{.mark}
are likely to [experience]{.mark} [high levels of]{.mark}
[stress]{.mark}, [a **reduction in positive
outcomes**]{.mark}]{.underline}, **[[lower
self-esteem]{.underline}]{.mark}**, **[anomie]{.underline}**,
**[[and]{.mark} [general demoralization]{.mark}]{.underline}**\" (p.
391). In light of Albert and Triandis\' argument, [a possible
explanation for a lack of cultural diversity within forensics\'
organizations to date is that [forensics competition fosters a climate
of assimilation,]{.mark} one [in **which \"minority culture members
adopt the norms and values of the dominant group**]{.mark}**,\" rather
than a climate of pluralism**]{.underline} (Cox, 1991, p.35). The
importance of the assimilative versus pluralistic environment is
crystallized when we recognize that forensics activities uphold an
\"argumentative perspective in examining problems and communicating with
people\" (Bartanen, 1995, p. 2). An argumentative perspective is one
that involves the use of reasons in support of acts, beliefs, attitudes
and values. Essentially a westernized perspective founded on the
philosophies of classic rhetoricians such as Aristotle, Protagoris, and
Quintilian, and modern rhetoricians such as Stephen Toulmin, Chaim
Perelman, and Richard Weaver, the argumentative perspective promotes
\"rationality in the pursuit of knowledge,\" (Kim, 1985, in Samovar and
Porter, 1991, p. 404). In contrast, an Eastern perspective \"places an
emphasis on perceiving and knowing things and events holistically and
synthetically, rather than analytically\" (p. 403). The significance of
these differences is marked, with Eastern thought comprised of vague,
sometimes imprecise statements utilizing circular reasoning, while
Western thought is comprised of logical and analytical categorizations,
utilizing linear reasoning. In forensic competitions, then, where events
are prescribed, speakers are expected to conform to critic-as-audience
expectations asserting the Western argumentative perspective; such
expectations and assertions equate to utilization of standardized events
and conformity constraints. Consequently, in prepared platform speaking
events such as persuasive or informative speaking, as well as limited
preparation events like impromptu and extemporaneous speaking, critics
expect to and do hear speeches conforming to Western rhetorical
conventions: an introduction with a thesis and preview; a body made up
of three to five points, well supported by evidence; and a conclusion
that reviews and sums up what has been presented. In addition to this
basic format, critics will also be evaluating clarity and precision of
language, careful enunciation and correct pronunciation of vocabulary,
and nonverbal behaviors like direct eye contact, appropriate facial
expressions, and vocalics. In events like debate, critics will evaluate
speakers on the analytical expertise with which they approach the topic,
the amount and credibility of their evidence, and their rhetorical
strategies in attempting to defeat opponents. Finally, critics
evaluating oral interpretive events not only assess the ability of
speakers to develop characterizations and emotive levels, but also to
create introductions functioning as arguments supported by the
literature presented. Prescribed in such a manner, [forensic
competitions **function monoculturally, effectively offering the
dominant Westernized perspective**]{.underline}. Yet **[[forensic
programs exist in environments that are not
monocultural]{.underline}]{.mark}**. Consequently, [the polycultural
environment within which forensics thrives contains a multiplicity of
communicative styles]{.underline} \-- styles that have been for the most
part ignored, marginalized, and silenced in the world of competitive
speech and debate. As Barlund (1975) notes, communicative styles may be
defined as: By communicative style is meant the topics people prefer to
discuss, their favorite forms of interaction \-- ritual, repartee,
argument, selfdisclosure \-- and the depth of involvement they demand of
each other. It includes the extent to which communicants rely upon the
same channels \-- vocal, verbal, physical \-- for conveying information,
and the extent to which they are tuned to the same level of meaning,
that is, to the factual or emotional content of messages (p. 12). To
better understand the significance of Barlundís definition, a
consideration of culturally different communicative style is warranted.
A Multicultural Communicative Style [Although the foundation of
forensics events may have been grounded in the ancient rhetoric of
Greece and Rome, the globalization of American culture **calls for a
more diverse rhetorical competency**]{.underline}. One of the ways such
competency can be developed is by reviewing different multicultural
communicative styles. To accomplish this we will briefly examine some
features of Asian culture as an exemplar of multicultural differences
affecting forensic participation. Although this perusal is limited, it
should offer insight into potential multicultural impacts. Perhaps the
single most important feature affecting communicative styles within some
Asian cultures centers around Confucianism, a philosophy encouraging
both reciprocity and group harmony \-- empathetic understanding of the
other, and self-sacrifice for the good of the community. Consequently,
cultures upholding Confucianism as their dominant paradigm place high
value on group conformity and relational ethics, resulting in
communication patterns designed to \"initiate, develop, and maintain
social relationships\" (Yum, 1988, p. 384) Subsequently, such cultures
are more interested in the process by which communication occurs rather
than its outcome, most often utilizing indirect communication as a
primary tool of the communication event. The impact of Confucianism on
the communicative styles of its proponents is profound. First,
communication is designed to induce cooperation among group members, and
second, to promote relationships rather than individual goal
attainments. In the world of forensic competitions, such commitment to
the group disallows satisfaction in individualized success, while at the
same time creating an environment fraught with face-losing potential.
Imagine the shame evident in the one team member who does not advance to
awards, or that debate team who drops in the final round. Such
face-losing occurrences are common in current forensic practices, and
may account for the small number of known debate societies within
collectivist societies. Equally relevant to this examination of
multicultural differences is nonverbal communication. Culturally bound,
nonverbal communication is an area in which misunderstanding between
cultures has the potential to flourish. For example, Japanese display
rules prohibit negative facial expressions; consequently, it is common
for the Japanese to smile even when angry (Argyle, 1982, p. 63).
Consider the confusion during an interpretation of literature in which
an angry or distraught character smiles in what is perceived an
inappropriate moment. The same would hold true if this competitor was
attempting to persuade the audience concerning some grave or
life-threatening matter. Given Western cultural nonverbal norms,
forensic critics would assess the smiling competitor negatively, and the
competitor would suffer the impact on the ballot. It is not unlikely
such negative attribution would result in the competitor not advancing
into the final round, and thus, the competitor would not have
opportunity to contribute to the overall success of the team through
acquisition of sweepstakes points. Again, such an outcome would
constitute loss of face for the competitor, a serious offense in many
Asian cultures. Beyond facial expression, noted cultural differences in
nonverbal communication range from amount and frequency of eye contact
to arrangements of time and space, as well as appropriateness of
gestures. Any of these holds the potential for negative impact within a
forensics tournament, either in a round of competition, or during social
interaction between rounds. [The consequences of such misunderstandings
may be that **[multicultural students,]{.mark} feeling uncomfortable in
the Westernized cultural realm of forensics, [will leave the activity in
order to maintain their own cultural
perspectives]{.mark}**[.]{.mark}]{.underline} From this brief overview
of some of the inherent differences within multicultural approaches to
communicative style, it is evident that [[the current underlying
philosophy of forensic competitions needs to expand]{.mark} if
accommodation of cultural dissimilarities is to take place]{.underline}.
The question remains: How? Toward Pluralism in Forensics It has been
argued that [[forensics is]{.underline}]{.mark} (or should be)
**[[primarily an educational enterprise, rooted in pedagogy, rhetoric,
and research]{.underline}]{.mark}**. If this is so, then in advancing
into the 21st century, an era in which societies will increasingly
become multicultural, it makes sense to adopt Albert and Triandis\'
(1985) objective of effectuating intercultural education within a
multicultural society. The aim of this objective is \"to prepare
individuals to function effectively in both their culture of origin and
in their new culture\" (p. 391). [**[Implementing this objective in
forensics will not be easy. Change never is]{.mark}.** However, while
human beings do **not automatically embrace the unknown, [inability to
move beyond a state of stasis equates to stagnation in human
development]{.mark}**. Within the world of forensics, [coaches, critics,
and competitors must continually adapt,]{.mark} evolving in their
interactions with an ever-changing environment, **[or risk
extinction]{.mark}**. The possibility for forensic multicultural
evolution can be strengthened in several ways.]{.underline} First,
[[those of us involved in the activity **must hone our self-diagnostic
skills**]{.mark}**; in other words, [we must consistently]{.mark} and
honestly [examine what we are doing, why, and with what effect. Are we
\"doing the greatest good for the greatest
number]{.mark}**]{.underline}?\" If not, why not? Second, [[we must
recognize the potential for educational gain when we expose ourselves
and our students to multicultural awareness, knowledge, and
acceptance]{.underline}]{.mark}. Not only will our learning experience
be enriched, but we may also be led to explore identities and to
question cultural domination, thereby increasing acceptance of
differences. Finally, we [must begin to begin. We cannot advance beyond
our current state until we initiate action. This can be accomplished in
many different ways]{.underline}.

How do feminists use gender and patriarchy to describe the field of
international relations (IR)? Overall, [[feminist theory says that most
of the key players in IR,]{.underline}]{.mark} such as diplomats,
policymakers, heads of government, and academic professionals, [[have
been, and still are, males who come from patriarchal social and
political backgrounds. Thus, discussions within IR remain largely
constrained by those who lack consideration of women's roles in world
politics]{.underline}]{.mark} (because they have not been trained to
value and include the perspective of women). [[Should IR perpetuate the
exclusion of women from its discipline, along with their potential
contributions and additional viewpoints, IR will remain a prime example
of patriarchy, in both its practice and accomplishments. Indeed, IR is
frequently referred to as the "last bastion of the social sciences,"
indicating how rigid it remains in reconsidering itself through the
'gender lens.']{.underline}]{.mark}

Accessed 9/9/2015, rwg)

Tickner argues that IR is gendered to "marginalize women' s voices , "
and stresses " that women have knowledge , perspectives and experiences
that should be brought to bear on the study of international relations."
For example, Tickner would argue that [[security]{.mark}, a main topic
in IR, [should]{.mark} not only be understood as "defending the state
from attack," but should [also consider that security for women "might
be different]{.mark}]{.underline} because women are more likely to be
attacked by men they know, rather than strangers from other states." In
other words, in contrast to traditional IR views that view security as
protecting the state from other states, feminists argue the topic of
security should address acts of rape and violence, not only from foreign
perpetrators, but from their own fellow citizens as well. Feminists
would also add that occurrences of rape increase during times of war,
and is even used as a method of ethnic cleansing among the rivalries
within their state, yet would never enter into typical IR discussions
that focus solely on state-to-state interaction, simply because IR
discussions traditionally remain focused on states as the key actors.
Thus, [[the topic of security shows how gender consideration]{.mark},
excluded from the very beginning of the discussion, [results in
**policymaking** that would be subsequently exclusive of, and likely
**detrimental** to women.]{.mark}]{.underline} [Prior to discussing any
IR topic,]{.underline} [[standpoint feminist IR]{.mark} theory [would
**first** challenge those participating in the discussion, and those
defining the key terms and issues, by critically asking them if the
normative perspectives and working vocabulary are broad enough to
effectively accommodate issues affecting women]{.mark}]{.underline}.

Gender Lens Investing

Outlining GLI and its limitations

To begin, it is necessary to further explain the emerging (and
multifaceted) field of \[End Page 69\] GLI. According to several groups
that are seeking to advance this broad field - or what some refer to as
a 'movement' - [GLI fuses the moral imperative to support women together
with the thesis that it makes good business sense to invest in companies
that support women in leadership and throughout society.]{.underline}
Thus, [GLI is based on 'the business case' for gender
equality.]{.underline}

[Among the self-proclaimed leaders of the field is [the Women Effect
Investment team]{.mark} at the Criterion Institute, which is a US-based
initiative aimed at building interest in GLI. The team explains that it
is trying to build the field of GLI in order to create 'durable and
systemic change for women worldwide]{.underline} - both as investors and
beneficiaries of invested capital'.3 In their survey of approaches to
GLI, [the team [found]{.mark} that most [projects involve]{.mark} one or
more of three primary ['gender lenses']{.mark}: (1) those [that increase
access to capital for women entrepreneurs]{.mark} and have women in
leading positions; (2) those that [promote gender equity in the
workplace]{.mark} and across the supply chain; [and]{.mark} (3) those
that [create products]{.mark} and services [that benefit women]{.mark}
and girls.]{.underline}

[[Catalytic Women]{.mark} is another driver of the field of GLI, seeking
to offer 'tools and training to donors, investors and advisors who want
to align money and values', and to [empower individuals to engage in
social impact investing]{.mark} and strategic giving.]{.underline}
Founded in San Francisco several years after the Criterion team,
[Catalytic Women is focused on women's financial empowerment for three
main reasons: women are the majority of asset owners; women make most
giving decisions; and women are more likely to be interested in
investments that offer both a good return on investment and a social
impact.]{.underline} In its guide for gender-based impact investing,
[[Catalytic Women explains that social impact can be achieved
through]{.mark} a variety of financial vehicles, including traditional
giving]{.underline} (donations, philanthropy, etc), [internet-based
lending platforms]{.underline} (including crowdfunding, P2P platforms,
online microcredit organisations), [and what they call 'double/triple
bottom line investments' - debt or equity impact investments that
include angel funding, community investment notes, social investment
loan funds and socially responsible mutual funds.]{.underline} Though I
am not aware of any estimates of the size of the GLI industry, [it is
clearly growing as part of the broader move toward [socially responsible
investments]{.mark}]{.underline} (or 'impact investments'), which
amounted to \$500 billion of investment in 2014 and are projected to
rise to \$1 trillion by 2020.4

Despite the wide range of GLI products available, the focus in this
article is \[End Page 70\] mainly on gender lens mutual and investment
funds, most of which operate out of the US and Western Europe. Using
different means of evaluating 'gender equality', [these funds have taken
the work of Criterion and others as an impetus to develop this newest
version of socially responsible investment. The Matterhorn Group at
Morgan Stanley]{.underline}, for instance, [launched The Parity
Portfolio in 2013, which it describes as a gender lens portfolio
strategy that 'seeks to achieve financial returns through capital
appreciation and current income', while also having 'an impact on social
returns through gender parity in corporate America']{.underline}.5 [The
Parity Portfolio focuses mainly on women's representation on corporate
boards, investing only in those companies with three or more women board
members. The London-based Barclays bank set up its Women in Leadership
ETN]{.underline} (Exchange Traded Notes) [in June 2014, which follows an
Index that evaluates the performance of US firms with a female CEO or a
board of directors that is at least 25 per cent women.]{.underline}6

For my purposes here, however, I will mainly focus on [[the Pax Ellevate
Global Women's Index Fund]{.underline}]{.mark} (PXWIX), which was
established in the US in 2006. The Fund, which has a portfolio that
amounts to almost \$66 million, [[claims to be 'the only mutual fund in
the U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates [that focuses on investing in]{.mark}
the highest-rated [companies]{.mark} in the world in [advancing women's
leadership']{.mark}.]{.underline}7 [In order to determine whether or not
a company meets its gender criteria, [the Fund uses the MSCI World Index
to identify companies]{.mark}, which are then [evaluated for:
representation by women]{.mark} on the board of directors;
representation of women in executive management; presence of Woman Chief
Financial Officers; presence of Woman Chief Executive Officers; [and
whether the company is a signatory to]{.mark} the Women's Empowerment
Principles ([WEPS]{.mark}).]{.underline}

[MSCI then performs a calculation based on market capitalisation,
leading to the Pax Global Women's Leadership Index.]{.underline}

[[The inclusion of the]{.mark} Women's Empowerment [Principles]{.mark}
is important here, as this initiative]{.underline}, which is a joint
initiative of the United Nations Global Compact and UN Women, [seeks to
promote the development of a more 'socially conscious' capitalism. The
WEPs operate as a voluntary set of principles that aim to help
businesses to empower women in the workplace, marketplace and community.
Specifically, they are to: (1) establish high-level corporate leadership
for gender equality; (2) treat all women and men fairly at work -
respect and support human rights non-discrimination; (3) ensure the
health, safety and well-being of all women and men workers;
(4)]{.underline} \[End Page 71\] [promote education, training and
professional development for women; (5) implement enterprise
development, supply chain and marketing practices that empower women;
(6) promote equality through community initiatives and advocacy; and (7)
measure and publicly report on progress to achieve gender
equality.]{.underline}

As has been argued elsewhere, [from a critical feminist perspective, the
WEPs [are problematic for a number of reasons]{.mark}, including the
ways in which they legitimise the growing power of corporations, and
naturalise and normalise the fusion of gender equality to participation
in the capitalist market economy.]{.underline} That is, [while they may
improve the economic situation of some women in the short term, [they
fail to consider]{.mark} decades of feminist [research suggesting that
**entry into capitalist**]{.mark} **labour [markets]{.mark} may
[fuel]{.mark} gender and class [inequalities by adding paid work to the
vast amounts of unpaid work]{.mark} already [performed by women,
and]{.mark} by [integrating women into]{.mark} labour [markets that are
becoming]{.mark} increasingly [precarious for]{.mark} both [men and
women]{.mark}**.]{.underline}8

However, the WEPs are nonetheless a useful indicator of the commitment
of corporations to the improvement of gender equality beyond the
boardroom, extending throughout the supply chain. In this sense, the
Fund goes much further than the Morgan Stanley and Barclays funds, which
focus solely on women's representation on corporate boards. But the
criteria underpinning the Pax Ellevate Global Women's Index Fund are not
given equal weighting, and the representation of women on corporate
boards and in management is given the greatest amount of weight. That
is, companies that fall short of the overall gender analytics but have
30 per cent of women on their board of directors may still be included
in the Index.

In terms of supporting companies with a greater percentage of women in
the boardroom, the Fund does indeed seem to be quite effective. Among
the 400 companies in the Index, women constitute 29 per cent of board
members and 22 per cent of senior managers. This is quite a bit higher
than the respective 16 per cent and 12 per cent found for companies in
the MSCI World Index, though it is far from gender-equal. However, it is
not at all clear whether or not the existence of this Fund (or other
funds) is actually responsible for encouraging companies to change the
gender composition of boards or to sign on the Women's Empowerment
Principles, though this may be the case.9 Perhaps more importantly, the
focus on empowering women in the boardroom and upper level management
ultimately means the empowerment of wealthy (and predominantly white)
women in the Global North. Similarly, the investors who are supposedly
'empowered' through their \[End Page 72\] socially responsible
investments are also wealthy women and men, as the minimum investment
for the Pax Fund is \$250,000.

Thus, [insofar as GLI industry advocates]{.underline} (such as the
Criterion Institute and Catalyst) [have explained that a gender lens
involves looking beyond women in the highest levels of employment, and
involves changes in gender norms and the value attributed to women's
productive contributions to society, these have generally not been taken
on board by gender lens mutual and investment funds. Rather, it is the
more easily measured (and monitored) criteria]{.underline}, such as the
proportion of women on corporate boards, [that have made their way to
the top of the agenda.]{.underline}

It is also important to note that these are voluntary and
investor-driven initiatives, and have taken place in the US, which,
along with the UK, has followed the recommendations of the banking
industry and avoided institutionalising gender quotas. This is in
contrast to moves elsewhere in Europe, including Germany, which has
legislated gender quotas that require large companies to have 30 per
cent of all supervisory board positions held by women by 2016.

At the same time, [despite the claims underpinning the wider GLI field
that this trend will ultimately improve the condition of women
worldwide, [investment funds are]{.mark} predominantly [focused on
companies based in the US and Europe]{.mark}. In the case of the Pax
Fund, 52.5 per cent of the portfolio is based in the US.]{.underline}10
[The geographical limitations of this attempt at social transformation
is further [evidenced in the fact that]{.mark} **the criteria used has
led to firms such as [Lockheed Martin]{.mark}**]{.underline} (a major
arms manufacturer) **[[being dubbed 'gender friendly']{.mark}. Given the
centrality of arms sales to the perpetuation of violent
conflicts]{.underline}** - which, as the feminist literature on gender,
peace and security has documented, very often include gender-based
violence - [**this claim is deeply problematic**.]{.underline}

**[GLI and the reproduction of neoliberal 'common sense']{.underline}**

While the discussion up until now has mainly focused on the things that
GLI initiatives claim to be doing, I will now turn to a discussion of
some of the ways in which [the [discourses used by leaders of this
movement]{.mark} are serving to [reproduce]{.mark} particular sets of
[assumptions]{.mark} - [about gender, finance, and the]{.mark} mutual
[compatibility of gender equality and]{.mark} the deepening of
[financial relations]{.mark} globally.]{.underline} That is, I look at
some of the less obvious things that the [GLI discourses]{.underline}
are doing \[End Page 73\] to [shape the way we think about the
relationship between gender, finance and capitalism more
broadly.]{.underline}

[Much of [the discourse reaffirms]{.mark} a particular [Western version
of liberal feminism that sees the expansion of capitalism as something
that can be harnessed]{.mark} for progressive social change and women's
(economic) empowerment]{.underline} - a version of feminism that I have
described elsewhere as ['Transnational Business Feminism']{.underline}.
This term [is [meant to describe a]{.mark} political-economic [project
that brings certain feminist ideas into conversation]{.mark} with the
knowledge being produced by transnational corporations regarding the
'gender dividend' that can be gained from investing in women as workers
and consumers.]{.underline}11 **[[Transnational Business Feminism seeks
to work through neoliberal capitalism rather than to challenge
it]{.underline}]{.mark}**, in contrast to critical feminists working
within the socialist, Marxist, post-structural and/or post-colonial
traditions. The latter group of feminists have argued that
[[neoliberalism]{.mark} has [created and sustained gender-based
inequality]{.mark} and oppression [through the]{.mark} creation of a
global [workforce]{.mark} that is precarious for both men and women,
through the ongoing [failure to recognise women's unpaid labour]{.mark},
through the [erosion of public supports for social provisioning]{.mark},
through the [protection of the rights of corporations]{.mark} above
those of people, [and]{.mark} through a number of [other
means]{.mark}.]{.underline}

In the rest of the article I draw attention to [[discourses that:
support gender equality as 'smart economics'; essentialise women's
'feminine' characteristics]{.mark}, which are regarded as useful for
reducing financial risk; [and position neoliberalled capitalism as the
best]{.mark}, if not the only, [means]{.mark} of addressing gender
inequality. **Each of these discourses [fits within a broader]{.mark}
neoliberal common [sense that fails to consider the ways in which
neoliberalism]{.mark} itself may work both to [reproduce gender
inequality, and]{.mark} to [limit critical feminist praxis]{.mark} that
seeks to promote an alternative to neoliberal finance-led
capitalism**.]{.underline}

Finance is key to achieving gender equality, which is 'smart economics'

It is quite clear that [proponents of GLI have primarily advocated a
'business case' for gender equality.]{.underline} The business case for
gender equality is not itself new. Rather, it dates back to development
initiatives of the 1980s and 1990s that sought to improve economic
growth by incorporating women into the market economy as producers and
consumers. **[Ignoring the idea popular among critical scholars at the
time that]{.underline}** \[End Page 74\] [**integration into the global
market was itself responsible for forms of inequality and
'underdevelopment'**, this approach viewed market expansion as key to
women's economic empowerment.]{.underline} More recently, [this view was
reiterated by the World Bank in its 2012 World Development Report,
Gender Equality and Development, which noted that addressing gender
inequalities 'is smart economics'. It is instrumental to development, it
is argued, because it can 'enhance economic efficiency and improve other
development outcomes'.]{.underline}12 Thus, [rather than simply being an
end in itself, **[within this framing gender equality is ultimately
'economically sound' in the sense that it promotes
growth]{.mark}**.]{.underline}

The business case discourse is clearly and explicitly articulated by GLI
advocates. As the chief operating officer of Barclays' Women in
Leadership ETN explains, in the context of a 'large and growing pool of
investors that have socially responsible mandates', they are 'moving
into this exchange-traded way of investing in diversity'.13 Upon
purchasing the women's network 85 Broads (which later became a partner
in the Pax Ellevate Global Women's Index Fund), Sallie Krawcheck stated
that she wanted to 'move from advocacy of women to the smart business of
real investment in women'.14 Joseph E. Keefe, the president and CEO of
Pax World Funds, noted that 'among the many contributions that women can
make to a company, it turns out that share price may be the most
significant of all'.15

While these GLI advocates are not concerned with gender equality in the
realm of 'development' per se, [the business case presented here clearly
resonates with the discourse promoted by the World Bank and other
neoliberal development institutions. This thinking reflects a certain
neoliberal common sense about the high cost of discrimination, not
simply]{.underline} (or even primarily) [in terms of costs for women as
a group, but in terms of costs for business. It is presumed to be
'smart' to be concerned about the ability for businesses to grow and to
increase their share price. From a critical feminist perspective,
however, gender equality is important for reasons that surpass corporate
profitability. **[Corporate profitability may]{.mark} also [turn out not
to be so good for everybody]{.mark}**: in many instances, the [benefits
of growth do not 'trickle down' to]{.mark} workers, particularly those
on the lower rungs of the corporate ladder, which is [where women tend
to be concentrated]{.mark}. Nor do these benefits necessarily trickle
down to the wider population through taxation, given that many
corporations exploit tax havens and other loopholes.]{.underline}

In the smart economics discourses, [the [incorporation of women into
the]{.mark}]{.underline} \[End Page 75\] [[workforce does not have to
involve]{.mark} identifying and [challenging]{.mark} historically
constituted gender [power relations]{.mark}, because the issue is framed
around 'diversity'. Specifically, [much of this reasoning is grounded
in]{.mark} an economic theory called [Diversity Prediction
Theorem]{.mark}, which is [based on the claim that a more diverse crowd
is more likely to generate diverse responses]{.mark} and therefore
achieve optimal outcomes (i.e. profits). **[This]{.mark} then
[depoliticises the issue of gender inequality]{.mark}**, which critical
feminists have linked, among other things, to the ways in which the work
done by men and women]{.underline} (including unpaid work in the home)
[is valued differently. At the same time, **[it essentialises women by
assuming that they will behave in a particular way that is different to
how men behave]{.mark}**.]{.underline} This takes us to a second common
theme in the discourses of GLI advocates.

Women display 'feminine' characteristics that are natural and universal,
and these characteristics are good for limiting risk in finance

While gender lens mutual funds may be helping to carve out a space for
women in the boardrooms of some companies, [**[the discourse may do as
much to reproduce gender stereotypes as to challenge them]{.mark}**.
Indeed, there are numerous examples of industry advocates drawing on
gender stereotypes as a means of legitimating their specific form of
'expertise'. A report published by the National Council for Research on
Women, called Women in Fund Management, offers a number of clear
examples. For instance it quotes Glenda Stone]{.underline} (who is the
chief executive and founder of a British recruitment and market
intelligence company and co-chair of the UK women's Enterprise
Taskforce): ['as investors, women do 60 per cent more work than men
before making a decision. They think in a more holistic, futuristic way
... They are good at spotting trends and market rises, partly because
they are socially very aware and they can spot the implications of
social observations'.]{.underline}16

[The report also cites a poll carried out in 2009, which found that
'most asset managers surveyed think women have an advantage over men in
asset management, especially over the long term'. Those polled described
women's investment styles as 'methodical, loyal and
consistent']{.underline} (p11). [The report further notes that 'in the
largely homogeneous, male-dominated world of investment management,
men's tendency to assert dominance in aggressively risky decision-making
is amplified and, in fact, helps explain the "group think" or herd
mentality noted by so many in the recent]{.underline} \[End Page 76\]
[financial crisis']{.underline} (p10). [The crisis itself 'compels us to
ask whether we can afford NOT to tap the differing experiences,
perspectives and investment styles that women bring to fund
management']{.underline} (p9).

[From a critical feminist perspective, **[the problem with this sort of
discourse is]{.mark}**]{.underline} not so much that it misrepresents
how women behave - these differences may indeed manifest themselves in
particular environments - but rather [**[that it neglects all kinds of
factors that help to explain why men and women behave
differently]{.mark}**. Rather than being rooted in some innate
biological differences, [women's tendencies to display more caring,
careful, long-term oriented and risk averse]{.mark} behaviour have been
[conditioned by the gender-based division]{.mark} of labour [under
capitalism]{.mark}, under which women have tended to do the majority of
domestic labour, child-rearing and carework. This is not to suggest that
all women behave in this way, but rather that there is an historically
rooted assumption that this constitutes proper 'feminine'
behaviour.]{.underline} Nor is it to suggest that stereotypes are always
imposed externally. Rather, as Melissa Fisher has pointed out in her
ethnography of women on Wall Street, women working in finance draw on
these stereotypes themselves, mobilising idealised notions of femininity
as a means of selling themselves as possessing the particular expertise
needed to best market financial products and to protect the long-term
interests of clients and firms.17 Nonetheless, this discourse about
women's behaviour in finance essentialises women and assumes homogeneity
in terms of class, race, ethnicity, sexuality, etc. At the same time, it
essentialises men, assuming that they are somehow intrinsically wired to
engage in aggressive risk-taking, without sufficiently questioning the
ways in which this is promoted by a gendered institutional culture and a
system of rewards that encourages this behaviour.

Major [[media outlets are fawning over the fact]{.mark} that [women are
taking]{.mark}]{.underline} over [[top positions in the country's
largest weapons companies and]{.mark} in [U.S.
defense]{.mark}]{.underline} and intelligence agencies. From MSNBC to
Politico to NowThis, a number of [prominent publications are [framing
this]{.mark}]{.underline} ascent [[as an indicator of overall progress
for women]{.underline}]{.mark}---and of increased equity in the
organizations they are now leading.

Women are now the CEOs of four out of the country's five biggest
military contractors, writes Politico reporter David Brown, noting that,
"across the negotiating table, the Pentagon\'s top weapons buyer and the
chief overseer of the nation\'s nuclear stockpile now join other women
in some of the most influential national security posts[." Brown hails
the developments as a "watershed" moment]{.underline}, citing Kathleen
Hicks, senior vice president at the Center for Strategic and
International Studies, a think tank whose top corporate funders are
weapons contractors, as asserting that "the national security community"
is more of a meritocracy than other fields.

Throughout the article, [the women leading these organizations proclaim
that women can make it to the top if they believe in
themselves]{.underline}. They [call on well-worn gender
stereotypes]{.underline} to assert that women have something special to
offer because of their unique talent at negotiating, their fierce
protectiveness as mothers, and their "different perspective" on problem
solving. [The article]{.underline} even [[includes patronizing praise of
how women's leadership in the military can result in innovative
solutions]{.underline}]{.mark} like wrapping sensitive equipment in
pantyhose to keep out sand.

Yet, [**[feminists should not]{.mark}** [view this "rise" of
women]{.mark} as a win]{.underline}. [[Feminism]{.mark},]{.underline} as
the most recent wave of imperial-feminist articles shows, [[is]{.mark}
increasingly [being co-opted to promote]{.mark}]{.underline} and sell
[[the U.S. m]{.mark}ilitary-[i]{.mark}ndustrial [c]{.mark}omplex:
[a]{.mark} profoundly violent [institution]{.mark} [that will never
bring liberation]{.mark} to women]{.underline}---whether they are within
its own ranks or in the countries bearing the greatest brunt of its
brutality. As Noura Erakat, a human rights attorney and assistant
professor at George Mason University, put it in an interview with In
These Times, [[women's inclusion]{.mark} in U.S. military institutions
"[makes the system subjugating]{.mark} us **[stronger and more difficult
to fight]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Our historical exclusion makes it
\[appear\] desirable to achieve \[inclusion\] but that\'s a lack of
imagination. [Our [historical exclusion should push]{.mark} us [to
imagine a better system and]{.mark} another [world]{.mark} that's
possible."]{.underline}

This pro-military media spin is no accident: [[Weapons contractors are
working hard to sell a progressive, pro-women brand to the
public]{.underline}]{.mark}. Raytheon and other [firms spend millions on
public relations painting themselves as noble empowerers of women and
girls in the sciences]{.underline}. [Raytheon champions its partnership
with Girl Scouts of the USA]{.underline}. "Through a multiyear
commitment from Raytheon, Girl Scouts will launch its first national
computer science program and Cyber Challenge for middle and high school
girls," states a promotional page. A high-dollar promotional video
quotes Rebecca Rhoads, president of Raytheon's global business services,
as stating, "[Raytheon's vision]{.underline} about making the world a
safer place [and the girl scouts' vision]{.underline} of making the
world a better place [couldn't be more well-suited as
partners]{.underline}." [Such a claim is]{.underline} particularly
[brazen, coming from a company that supplies]{.underline} a steady
stream of [bombs for the U.S.-Saudi war in Yemen, which has unleashed a
famine that has killed]{.underline} an estimated [85,000 Yemeni
children]{.underline} under the age of five.

[Lockheed Martin]{.underline}, by far the biggest arms producer in the
world with \$44.9 billion in arms sales in 2017, [manufactured the
500-pound laser-guided MK 82 bomb that struck a Yemeni school bus last
August]{.underline}, killing 54 people (44 of them children).
[But]{.underline} that doesn't stop [the company]{.underline} from
presenting itself as a progressive organization that recruits---and
supports---women scientists. A page on its website quotes the Langston
Hughes poem, "A Dream Deferred," to make the case the the company helps
girls achieve their dreams. "This poem was one of my favorites from my
high school English class, but, now, as I consider my Community Service
and Engagement with the Lockheed Martin community, I personally know
what can happen to a dream deferred, when many say no, but I say, 'Yes
you can,'" the page states. In her speech at the 2015 World Assembly for
Women in Tokyo[, the company's chairperson]{.underline}, president and
CEO Marillyn A. Hewson [said that "it is just as important to support
women as they work to lift themselves up and raise up each
other.]{.underline} Because taking responsibility for our own careers is
empowering in and of itself."

[[Faux feminist P.R. is not just for private
corporations]{.mark}---**[it is also being used to sell woman-led CIA
torture]{.mark}**.]{.underline} [Gina [Haspel]{.mark}, who once oversaw
torture at a black site in Thailand]{.underline}, now [[runs the CIA,
and the Trump administration defended her from critics of
torture]{.mark} **[by pointing out the fact that she is a
woman]{.mark}**]{.underline}. "Any Democrat who claims to support
women's empowerment and our national security but opposes her nomination
is a total hypocrite," said Press Sec. Sarah Sanders on Twitter.

Yet, Erakat asks, "[How are you going to celebrate women in high
military ranks as an achievement when all they do is fulfill an agenda
that was never created through a feminist framework]{.underline}? Haspel
was an architect of our torture regime. Why would I celebrate her?"

Meanwhile, [[the war criminals of yesteryear are being rehabilitated by
this "girl-power" coverage]{.underline}]{.mark}. Last April, The
Washington Post ran a story with the eyebrow-raising headline, "'The
kids, they love Madeleine Albright': How a veteran diplomat got turned
into a girl-power icon." In 1996, Albright, the then-U.S. ambassador to
the United Nations, told "60 Minutes" that the half-million Iraqi
children killed by the U.S. sanctions regime were "worth" it.

["**[It's a very white, imperialist, liberal understanding of feminism
to think that the promotion of women at the top of militarization and
militarism is advancing women]{.mark}**,"]{.underline} says Kara
Ellerby, author of No Shortcut to Change, who derides what she calls the
"add-women-and-stir" approach. "Sure, it\'s great that you have a woman
at the head of Raytheon, but what about the women who those bombs are
being dropped on?" Ellerby emphasizes to In These Times. "[From a global
perspective, putting women in charge of U.S. military dominance is not
remotely feminist: It\'s imperialist."]{.underline}

[Analysing [configurations of gender inequality]{.mark} rather than
single outcomes [opens a wider perspective on gender
stratification]{.mark}, and suggests a different outlook for
understanding the implications of welfare states on it]{.underline}. The
interpretative framework developed in this paper views the **[[uneven

paradoxical consequence of welfare state activity when highlighting one

justifiable, or even worthwhile, within its particular ideological and
institutional context.]{.underline}

[[Identifying configurations of gender inequality rather then
configurations of welfare policies provides a counterpoint to mainstream
studies]{.mark} which have been primarily interested in the welfare
state, and]{.underline} investigated gender inequality as a way of
exemplifying its significance for various forms of stratification.
Accordingly, Esping-Andersen (1990, 1999) and Korpi (2000) cluster
countries into regimes on the basis of welfare state characteristics and
then validate these clusters by predicted outcomes, principally women's
employment levels. As the main concern of this paper is gender, it

[[Marxist-socialist critiques have several
dimensions]{.underline}]{.mark}. In terms of political economy, critics
of the state note its exploitative foundations and insist that \"for all
its complexity, differentiation and even contradiction, the state works
to facilitate the appropriation and centralisation of wealth . . . ; to
protect this appropriation through the means of coercion, both
domestically and internationally; and to legitimate these two functions
in the interests of social stability. **[[Feminist standpoint theorists
add that the state is historically, structurally
patriarchal]{.underline}]{.mark}**116 This is evidenced in the
accumulation process of early as well as modern state formation: the
appropriation of women\'s productive and reproductive labor is not
incidental to but a condition of the centralization of allocative and
authoritative resources117 in state formation.

[[State formation is the process of reordering social

Since World War 11, [[economic developments have exacerbated the
contradictions between capitalism, liberalism, and
masculinism]{.underline}]{.mark}; the expansion of the welfare state has
instituted \"public patriarchy,\" in which the control over women\'s
reproductive (\"domestic\") labor has shifted from individual males in
the family to the political economy of the state. The consequences of
women entering the public sphere [[the liberal feminist strategy-are
seen to be]{.underline}]{.mark} complex and
**[[contradictory]{.underline}]{.mark}**; they include general increases
in the double-day of work for women, greater awareness of the wage
differentials between women and men, increasing numbers of \"working
mothers\" and women as single heads of household, and expansion of the
state\'s role as \"the great collective father-figure.\" The
society-wide pattern is one of a shift from \"private (husband)
patriarchy\" to \'public (state) patriarchy,\" but not to women\'s
equality with men.

[[To the extent that liberal feminists fail to problematize masculine
and feminine identities]{.underline}]{.mark}, and especially their
embodiment in the private sphere, **[[they fail to challenge the
patriarchal basis of the bourgeois state]{.underline}]{.mark}**. \"As a
result of their pluralist view of governmental politics, they have been
unable to deal with the question of economic class and racial privilege
either. [[The subversive potential of liberal feminism
is]{.underline}]{.mark} weakest when women are envisioned as isolated
individuals, and **[[strongest]{.underline}]{.mark}** **[[when
addressing the \'cross-economic class and racial identity of women as a
sexual class]{.underline}]{.mark}**. Without challenging liberalism\'s
model of atomistic, rational, and interest-serving individuals,
feminists find themselves struggling for equal access to a zero-sum
contest or competition, which they then enter with a \"handicap.\" Women
may be permitted to compete; some individuals may win token prizes; but
those who write the rules, assess qualifications for participation,
train the players, referee the play, own the concession stands, announce
the game, and evaluate the winners retain masculinist (racist and
classist) identities.

As Mary G. Dietz cogently puts it: "**[[access is not
enough]{.underline}]{.mark}**.\" However, to note that liberal feminism
is insufficient is not to argue that it is unnecessary or unimportant.
[[**On the contrary, by using gender as a unit of analysis**, feminist
scholars]{.mark} have [revealed]{.mark} the inegalitarianism behind [the
myth of equal opportunity and made us aware of how such presumptions
deny the social reality of unequal treatment, sexual discrimination,
cultural stereotypes, and women\'s subordination]{.mark}]{.underline}
both at home and **[[in the marketplace]{.underline}]{.mark}**. To the
extent that this sort of gender analysis leads to positive political
programs . . . feminists give indispensable assistance to liberal
practice.

Or, as Eisenstein puts it in terms of exposing the patriarchal state:
Each time an accommodation is sought between feminist demands and
liberal patriarchal needs, it becomes more possible to examine the real
purposes of the state. , , . The demand for women\'s equality even in
the purely legal-formal sense has the subversive quality of questioning
the male domination of public life.

The problem lies in the boundaries imposed by liberal acceptance of
gendered domains: women (as manifestations of woman\") cannot
participate as \"equals\" in a domain constituted as and reserved for
manifestations of masculinity understood as that which is \"not woman.\"
[[By criticizing masculinism in traditional constructions of politics
and the public domain, feminist standpoint theorists go further than
\"an understanding of power as access and a conception of citizenship as
civil liberty]{.underline}]{.mark}.\"l14 There are many articulations of
feminist standpoint; the two major orientations to be treated here are
Marxist-socialist and culturalfeminist (\"maternalist\') .

The dominant discourse on globalization that describes and theorizes the
above changes has a hidden commonality: gender and often race are
invisible. [[Globalization is presented as gender
neutral]{.underline}]{.mark}, even though some theorists do pay some
attention to women, the family and women's employment (e.g. Castells
2000). **[[This ostensible gender neutrality masks the "implicit
masculinization of these macro-structural models]{.underline}]{.mark}**"
(Freeman 2001; see also Ward 1993). **[[The implicit masculine
standpoint in the ruling relations]{.underline}]{.mark}** (Smith 1987)
[from which theories of society have been constructed impedes adequate
analysis]{.underline}. For example, unpaid caring, household, and
agricultural labor, along with much informal economic activity that
maintains human life (Elson 1994; Mies 1986), do not enter the analyses
or are assumed to be in unlimited supply. The omission of, mostly
women's unpaid work seriously biases discussions of the penetration of
capitalist globalizing processes and limits understanding of both
negative consequences and potentials for opposition (Bergeron 2001;
Gibson-Graham 2002).

["[Gendering" the discourse of globalization exposes the discontinuities
between]{.mark} the [realities]{.mark} of women's and men's lives and
mainstream scholarly work about global processes]{.underline}. Combined
with integral attention to race and ethnic processes, [["gendering"
should produce a better understanding of contemporary global
issues]{.mark}.]{.underline} Before presenting some of the extensive
feminist work that has gendered globalization research and theory, I
briefly examine the concept of gender. [Gender as used here is defined
as inequalities, divisions, and differences socially constructed around
assumed distinctions between female and male]{.underline}. [Gender is a
basic organizing principle in social life, a principle for allocation of
duties, rights, rewards, and power, including the means of
violence]{.underline}. [Gender is a factor in organizing daily life for
individuals, families, communities, and societies as large
structures.]{.underline} Women are usually disadvantaged in terms of
power and material and status rewards. [Gender]{.underline} is neither
an essential attribute of individuals nor a constant in social life, but
[consists of material and symbolic aspects of existence]{.underline},
[constantly produced and reproduced in the course of ongoing social
activities and practices]{.underline}. [Gender]{.underline} necessarily
[involves]{.underline} bodies of actual people and the ways that they
see and experience themselves, their [identities.]{.underline} This
implies that there are many versions of gender, different masculinities
and femininities, lived differently in different times and places, but
also varying within particular times and places. Although there are many
versions of masculinity and femininity and many ways of organizing
gender differences, heterosexual gender is the norm almost everywhere.
[[Most feminist analysts of gender and globalization use some such
notion of gender as socially produced and highly variable, while
recognizing the predominant subordination of women within gender
relations]{.mark}.]{.underline}

[[Socialist feminists]{.underline}]{.mark}, on the other hand, [[have
argued that women will remain marginalized in national
economies]{.underline}]{.mark} and the international political economy
as long [[as they are kept responsible for reproductive
work]{.underline}]{.mark}, As Lynne Segal points out, [[the maintenance
of the private sphere where women are to perform their undervalued
reproductive work serves men, the state, and
capitalism]{.underline}]{.mark}, whether in current capitalist or
socialist societies.

Women\'s central economic role can be masked by ideas about women\'s
separate sphere, which suggest women\'s apparent unimportance in the
economic relations of capitalism. It is women\'s servicing of men and
children in the home which allows for their greater exploitation in the
workforce, thus maintaining existing capitalist hierarchies of labour.
Women\'s domestic lives are crucial to the maintenance of male
dominance. But [[women\'s subordinate economic position in the labour
market is equally crucial to the maintenance of men\'s
power]{.underline}]{.mark} in the home.

Maria Mies also argues that it is in the interest of **[[both capitalist
and socialist states]{.underline}]{.mark}** to [[keep women marginalized
in informal and formal economic systems]{.underline}]{.mark}. The
[[growth-oriented modernization]{.underline}]{.mark} strategy of
industrialization **[[demands a \"dual\" economy]{.underline}]{.mark}**,
which consists of a modern, capital-intensive, socialized, \"formal\'
sector with waged labour as the dominant production relation, and a
\"subsidiary\" labour-intensive, non socialized (\"private\"),
technologically backward \"informal sector.\"

**Zanger 81**

(Abbey Zanger- Graduate Representative Organization, The Johns Hopkins
University, Feminism and the Critique of Capitalism, International Labor
and Working Class History Number 20, Fall 1981, pp. 68-69)

On April 24th and 25th, the Johns Hopkins University\'s Graduate
Representative Organization held its spring symposium. This year\'s
topic was \"Feminism and the Critique of Capitalism.\" The conference,
attended by about 400 people during the two days, was considered a great
success by conference organizers. Papers were presented by nationally
and internationally known feminists. In the first session, Barbara
Ehrenreich suggested that the current popularity of contemporary
anti-feminism may derive from the 19th century feminist goal to make men
more responsible within the family. Barbara Winslow followed Barbara
Ehrenreich, arguing that these movements can be resisted, as they have
been historically, [by [feminists organizing]{.mark} as and **[with
working class women around economic and political
needs]{.mark}**]{.underline}.

Second session contributors [[discussed the relationship between
patriarchy and capitalism]{.underline}]{.mark}. Zillah [[Eisenstein
identified a radical potential within liberal feminism]{.mark}, which
she [sees as a tradition capable of undermining patriarchy]{.mark} as it
operates at a state level]{.underline}. Like Eisenstein, Nancy Hartsock
addressed the nature of the Western State and suggested that \"[because
the construction of political life is rooted in male sexuality, and
because male sexuality is historically linked with violence and death,
political life has . . . been most fundamentally concerned with making
war and creating structures for domination]{.underline}.\" Julia
[Ericksen examined the interrelationship between women\'s position in
the labor force and their position in the home]{.underline}.

The third session began with Joan [[Smith]{.underline}]{.mark}, who
[[argued the necessity of viewing working class, sex and race as part of
the unity of the structure of capitalism. Marx]{.mark},]{.underline} she
observed, [**[did have the beginnings of a theory of the family and of
women\'s oppression]{.mark}**---a theory which must be developed today
by first analyzing the relationship between production and reproduction.
She sees this relationship being restructured in the current crisis by
state and new right attacks on women; **[thus the fight against these
attacks has to be a mass political attack against the
state]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Natalie Sokoloff followed with a
documentation of the attacks against women---attacks on women\'s
reproductive freedom, the so-called \"protection of the family,\" and
attacks on affirmative action. She discussed some of the effects of
these attacks on women\'s position in the labor market and in the
family.

[[Power is dealt with in a dichotomous way]{.underline}]{.mark} by
socialist women and radical feminists. In these analyses, [they see
power as deriving from either one's sex or one's economic class
position]{.underline}. The [**[critique of power as it is rooted in the

critique of power as it is rooted in the bourgeoisie/proletariat

[either the social relations of production or the social relations of
reproduction', domestic or wage labor, the private or public realms, the
family or the economy, ideology or material conditions, the sexual
division of labor or capitalist class relations, as
oppressive]{.underline}. [Even though almost all women are implicated in
both sides of these activities, "woman" is dealt with as though she were
not.]{.underline} Such a [conceptual picture of woman hampers one's
understanding of the complexity of her oppression. Dichotomy wins out
over reality.]{.underline} I will attempt here to replace this
dichotomous thinking with a dialectical approach.**[2 [The synthesis of
radical feminism and Marxist analysis is a necessary first step in
formulating a cohesive feminist political theory]{.mark}]{.underline}**.
[[This new formulation]{.underline}]{.mark}, Socialist Feminism, is not
a mere adding together of these two theories of power. It
[is]{.underline} rather [a real mix of the [interrelationships between
capitalism and patriarchy]{.mark} as expressed through the sexual
division of labor. To define capitalist patriarchy as the source of the
problem is at the same time to **[suggest that socialist feminism is the
answer]{.mark}**.]{.underline} My discussion uses Marxist class analysis
as the thesis, radical feminist patriarchal analysis as the antithesis,
and from the two evolves the synthesis of socialist feminism. I will
argue that the **[[recognition of class analysis, patriarchal theory,

The aforementioned narrow constructions of masculinity and femininity
have become accepted as common sense and are essential to rather than
simply a product of elite politics and the military-industrial complex.
E[nloe, writing in Feminist perspectives on militarism and war the
1980s, demonstrated that it was vital to the militaristic project to
ensure a large proportion of men who accepted the warrior or protector
role]{.underline} (Enloe 1983). While gender roles have transformed both
in the military and wider society (particularly in developed militarized
societies), with women taking on combat roles, the privileging of
masculinities over femininities remains central to both the military and
militarism (Peterson 2010). [[The widespread use of militaristic
language **outside**]{.mark} of military contexts and the minimization
of the effects of violence that accompany this [are indications of
societal acceptance of militarism.]{.mark} The results of the violence
of militarism are also [made tolerable through a process of
sanitization]{.mark}.]{.underline} For example, Carol Cohn argues that
the euphemistic terms clean bombs, collateral damage, and peacekeeping
missiles are examples of the inverted meanings of military doublespeak
that obfuscates the often devastating material impacts of war (1987;
1990, 33-- 35). The importance of militarism as a key institution of the
state also lies in its role in constructing national interest.
[[Inherent in this is the creation]{.underline}]{.mark} [[and deployment
of identity categories]{.underline}]{.mark} [[and hierarchies in
which]{.underline}]{.mark} gender, sexuality, race, and class [[converge
to reflect a binary of us--them both within and outside the
state]{.underline}]{.mark}. [[The construction]{.underline}]{.mark} of
these identity categories [[(re)produce the concern]{.underline}]{.mark}
with being able to assert power (us over them, masculine over feminine)
**[[that lies at the heart of militarism]{.underline}]{.mark}**.
International politics also plays a role here because the national
interest is constructed in part through interstate engagements in the
international arena. Thus[, [hierarchical power relations and
structures]{.mark} (of gender, race, and economics) are [mutually
reinforced across the domestic and international and are reflected in
national interests (]{.mark}Horn]{.underline} 2010). Delimiting what
counts as us and them in both the domestic and international arenas is
itself gendered (and often racialized), marking out what is acceptable
performance of masculinity and of femininity and which bodies can
legitimately perform such behaviors. [[Nationalist identity making not
only constructs us but also the Other as the enemy and perpetuates the
very notion of (in)security that legitimizes
militarism]{.mark}.]{.underline} In times of war, in particular, this is
reflected in the construction of a homefront in support of the national
interest, which reflects highly gendered and heteronormative
understandings of men, women, children, and the family
unit[.]{.underline} Thus, t[he characteristics and behaviors of us--them
versus the enemy are based on dominant male and female stereotypes and
the concomitant division of roles such as the masculine protector and
feminine victim.]{.underline} The identities and hierarchies central to
militarism are, in feminist analysis, always gendered in that they rely
on and reproduce a binary division between acceptable masculine and
feminine roles.
