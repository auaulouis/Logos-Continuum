The murder of dissident Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi has intensified
Washington's debate over the war in Yemen. On February 13, by a 248-177
vote, the House of Representatives passed a War Powers Act resolution to
end U.S. participation in the war. [But officials in Washington, D.C.
don't generally know that under terms of a little noticed U.S. law,
**President Donald Trump could end the Yemen War in a matter of
days.**]{.underline} U.S. arms manufacturers such as Boeing and Lockheed
Martin supply 57 percent of the military aircraft used by the Royal
Saudi Air Force. The U.S. corporations hire hundreds of U.S. civilian
mechanics and technicians to repair, maintain and fuel fighter jets and
helicopters. [The Arms Export Control Act requires Saudi Arabia to use
the military equipment for legitimate self defense. Under terms of a
little noticed U.S. law, President Donald Trump could end the Yemen War
in a matter of days. Saudi Arabia's consistent pattern of
disproportionate attacks on civilians belies any claim of self defense,
according to Brittany Benowitz, an attorney and former Congressional
staffer who analyzes arms control issues. "The Trump Administration is
currently not complying with the requirements of the Arms Export Control
Act," she told me. The act requires the President to stop supplies of
spare parts and maintenance of Saudi fighter planes if they violate the
act. Those measures would undermine Saudi military capability fairly
quickly, much faster than banning new arms sales, according to William
Hartung, a defense analyst at the Center for International Policy. "It
would affect their ability to fight immediately," he said in an
interview.]{.underline}

Congressional oversight of foreign policy hasn't always been this way. A
far cry from today's marginalized and demoralized bodies, Congress'
foreign affairs committees once stood side-by-side with the presidency
at the center of America's foreign policymaking. One need only look at
Henry Cabot Lodge's famous campaign leading to the Senate's 1919
rejection of the Treaty of Versailles and the League of Nations, on the
grounds that the Senate had not been adequately consulted, to see the
impact of aggressive congressional oversight of foreign policy. Or
consider the heady era of the mid-20th century, when Congress faced a
new international landscape shaped by two world wars and the emergence
of the Cold War and mutually assured destruction. Far from shrinking
from these responsibilities, Congress undertook a historic effort to
write --- and then re-write --- the rules of the road for foreign
policy. In 1951, lawmakers replaced the Marshall Plan with the Mutual
Security Act, then overtook that legislation ten years later with the
Foreign Assistance Act of 1961, which remains the foundational statute
governing U.S. aid overseas. Congress enacted the War Powers Act in 1973
and, in 1976, passed the landmark Arms Export Control Act. As
congressional oversight of foreign policy gained strength during the
Vietnam War, scholar Linda Fowler notes that "the Senate Foreign
Relations Committee was at the vanguard of the resurgence of Congress in
international affairs," citing the panel's establishment of a special
investigative subcommittee to examine executive branch foreign policies.
That subcommittee, chaired by Sen. Stewart Symington, identified a range
of executive branch abuses, uncovered expansive military operations
whose existence or scope had been previously undisclosed, and paved the
way for the Church Committee and, ultimately, establishment of the
Senate Select Committee on Intelligence. It also defined for Congress a
role of comprehensive, sustained oversight of U.S. foreign activities,
presence, and commitments. These debates were messy, complex, and
occasionally partisan, but the results were substantial. [However, the
1980s and 90s saw the beginning of a dramatic decline in congressional
engagement --- and effectiveness --- in conducting foreign policy
oversight. Fowler's work documents the decrease in oversight hearings
conducted by both the Foreign Relations and Armed Services Committees in
the Senate, beginning in the 1990s. Likewise, Congress' ability to enact
legislation setting out the priorities, expectations, and authorities of
the State Department crumbled.]{.underline} This final installment in a
three-part series (part I addressed defense oversight and part II
examined intelligence) about congressional national security oversight
argues regular State Department authorization bills --- and their focus
on bureaucratic and programmatic management --- are essential to
effective oversight. And effective oversight in this arena has never
been more urgently needed: Draconian cuts to both State and the U.S.
Agency for International Development proposed in the Trump
administration's 2018 and 2019 budgets present America's foreign policy
establishment with a colossal crisis. Regardless of the outcome of
November's mid-term elections, both the House and Senate foreign affairs
committees will see new leadership. These new leaders will have an
opportunity to set their committees on a path to reestablish their place
at the center of foreign policymaking. Doing so will require a smart
strategy for regaining the committees' capacity to legislate, a renewed
focus on structural and management issues impacting the foreign policy
enterprise, investment in the committees' own oversight capacity, and
attention to long-simmering cross-committee jurisdictional challenges.
Righting the Legislative Ship Congressional oversight of foreign policy
has suffered from many of the same challenges as other committees:
inadequate staff capacity, a disrupted appropriations process, inability
to work cross-jurisdictionally on multi-dimensional challenges, and
political polarization. However, the preeminent challenge by far for the
House Foreign Affairs Committee and the Senate Foreign Relations
Committee, the State Department's primary oversight committees, is far
simpler: their inability to legislate. As Kay King noted in her study
Congress and National Security, [Congress has failed since 1985 to
overhaul the legislation that provides strategic guidance for
foreign-assistance programs, instead making piecemeal changes that have
often led to incoherence and excessive bureaucracy. Congress has
produced a bill to guide State Department activities only sporadically
since 2000. This has not been for lack of effort, as the HFAC and SFRC
often hold hearings, mark up bills, and vote them out of committee (and,
in the House, get them passed by the full chamber), only to see them
fall victim to concerns about poison pill amendments or more urgent
business... The inability to legislate results from a range of factors,
but three loom large. First, as King notes, foreign policy legislation
is rarely seen as an urgent priority in light of the Executive Branch's
primacy in foreign affairs. Military force authorizations and sanctions
legislation are the most common exceptions. Second, members have
demonstrated a tendency to pursue controversial debates that derail
underlying bills --- in the form of the "poison pill" amendments King
mentions or within the bills themselves. Common examples, which are
often driven by narrow domestic constituencies, include international
family planning, U.S. policy toward Cuba, and issues associated with the
Israeli-Palestinian conflict. Conversely, a third reason is that foreign
policy legislation rarely addresses priorities of broader voting bases,
depriving such bills of an important impetus for Congressional
action.]{.underline} Foreign assistance authorization bills legislate
priorities and permissions relating to assistance provided to other
nations. State Department authorizations are meant to legislate
authorities and expectations for State Department organization,
processes, personnel policies, and overseas operations. These
authorization bills are key vehicles for legislative oversight. As King
notes, both categories of legislation have been sorely lacking: Congress
failed to pass a single State Department authorization bill from 2002
until 2016, when it passed a pared-down version short on both detail and
impact. The State Department is beset by numerous long-standing issues
that effective oversight legislation could have resolved, ranging from a
byzantine and dysfunctional bureaucratic structure to programmatic
constraints that prevent or complicate implementation of desired policy
approaches caused by legislation unamended in decades. A good example is
the well-intentioned Section 660 of the Foreign Assistance Act, which
constrains assistance to police forces and interior ministries despite
those institutions' central roles in combating terrorism, illicit
trafficking, corruption, transnational organized crime, and other
threats to U.S. national security. It is no accident that the Department
of Defense, which is provided an annually refreshed authorization bill
by Congress without fail, has long been viewed as a more effective
organization than the State Department. [The inability of the two
foreign affairs committees to legislate disempowers them vis-à-vis other
committees, adding to power imbalances within the broader national
security community. It also creates significant risk --- which numerous
events in the last few decades have borne out --- of executive branch
overreach. Fixing Congress' foreign policy oversight, therefore, means
forging a long-term legislative strategy that gradually rebuilds the
committee's oversight muscles. Here are a few suggestions for shaping
that strategy:]{.underline} First, start small and grow. Both the State
Department and Foreign Assistance authorization bills can be so
sprawling and cumbersome that they become too big not to fail. Such
bills repeatedly stall over partisan debates on issues like abortion
policies and support for the United Nations. When Congress passed the
Department of State Authorities Act in 2016, the first legislation
approximating a State Department authorization in 14 years, it was both
a commendable success and a case study in the committee's legislative
challenges. The bill covered tremendous ground, ranging from
international adoptions to Inspector General audits of the Broadcasting
Board of Governors. However, to secure passage, the committees had to
craft a bill that was mostly non-binding, consisting largely of
Sense-of-Congress statements and reporting requirements, thereby
limiting its impact. Rather than trying to cover the gamut in a single
bill, foreign policy oversight committees should break down their
priorities into small, digestible chunks that will encounter less
political headwind. While the committees do pass targeted legislation on
a regular basis, such legislation focuses almost exclusively on
providing direction for specific foreign policies, rather than
addressing structural or management issues. For example, three-quarters
of the way through the current Congress, only one of the 17 bills or
resolutions reported out of the House Foreign Affairs Committee --- the
Cybersecurity Diplomacy Act introduced following former Secretary of
State Tillerson's elimination of the State Department Cyber
Coordinator's office --- addresses structural or management concerns.
And there is much to do in this arena: A shortlist of priorities would
include organizational reforms to address overlapping missions,
byzantine bureaucracy, and dysfunctional hierarchies; updates to foreign
assistance legislation to address emerging threats, obsolete
programmatic constraints, and evolving interagency roles; reforms to
personnel training and career development; a reexamination of resource
allocation and oversight processes; and attention to festering
infrastructure needs. But all of this doesn't need to be done at once as
part of an annual authorization bill. Many pressing needs represent
low-hanging fruit that could be addressed with bipartisan support and
would be unlikely to encounter much resistance or require significant
time on the House and Senate floors. The committees have developed a
preference for seeking to address organizational and programmatic
reforms through comprehensive authorization bills instead of narrow,
focused efforts, perhaps because of challenges obtaining time for
debating such legislation on the House and Senate floor, perhaps as a
strategy for building coalitions of supporters interested in various
individual provisions, or perhaps simply out of habit. Pressing forward
with targeted, tailored bills to address discrete subsets of the foreign
policy enterprise, on the other hand, would improve their ability to
make progress on oversight priorities, even if they don't succeed in
addressing all of these priorities immediately. That progress would
enable the committees to enhance their oversight and give much-needed
direction to the State Department, while paving the way for broader
legislation in the future by gradually eliminating lingering minor
issues. Second, focus on bureaucratics and programmatics. Too often, the
committees have focused their energies on high-profile foreign policy
crises rather than the bureaucratic and programmatic issues so vital to
ensuring the executive branch can respond to such crises effectively.
For example, during the 18 months of the 115th Congress, the House
Foreign Affairs Committee has held 17 committee or subcommittee hearings
on Iran and North Korea alone, and only two examining State Department
organizational or management issues (excluding annual budget hearings,
which cover a broad array of topics). Though U.S. policy toward North
Korea and Iran is clearly important, in the long run, how the State
Department and related agencies are organized, manned, resourced,
prioritized, and empowered to execute activities will determine how
effective America's response is to these issues and any other crisis.
[Third, prioritize results over turf. Recent years have provided
numerous examples of instances in which the foreign affairs committees,
needing to pass important legislation but failing to obtain floor time
to debate it, have refused opportunities to attach their legislation to
other measures. While piling non-germane legislation on defense bills is
not ideal, these committees must be greedy and legislatively
opportunistic to escape their current quagmire.]{.underline} To draw
upon an example I experienced first-hand as a staff member for the
Senate majority leader, consider the Senate Foreign Relations
Committee's proposed Embassy Security Act, introduced in 2013 following
the attacks against U.S. diplomatic facilities in Benghazi, Libya. After
a handful of senators blocked this urgent bipartisan legislation from
passage by unanimous consent, committee leaders had an opportunity to
attach the legislation to the must-pass defense authorization bill, and
did so in the Senate, but let it drop from the conference agreement due
to concerns about the appearance of ceding jurisdictional ground to the
Armed Services Committee. Instead, the bill languished unpassed for
three years before some, but not all, of its provisions finally passed
in 2016. The price for maintaining the jurisdictional high ground
amounted to three years of inaction and loss of key elements of the
bill, including allocations of funding for implementing critical
security measures. Other congressional committees are far more assertive
in their efforts to add priorities onto moving legislative vehicles. The
foreign affairs committees' territorialism is shortsighted and
counterproductive. Given the huge number of competing bills and
amendments, it makes little sense to stand on principle while
opportunities to achieve meaningful legislation go by. Indeed, there are
some benefits to be found in purposefully considering foreign policy and
defense legislation simultaneously. Many experts have argued for a more
holistic Legislative Branch approach to national security oversight,
such as the development of a single national security budget. There is
undoubtedly value in approaches that enable lawmakers to draw
connections between disparate national security activities, and to
consider trade-offs across the entire U.S. government's equities. While
a unified budget may be distant notion today, a more feasible approach
may be structuring simultaneous debate of State Department and/or
foreign assistance authorization legislation and defense authorization
legislation. Investing in Foreign Policy Oversight A viable legislative
strategy, buttressed by refocused oversight, would help foreign policy
committees regain their relative power and relevance in Congress. But
effective foreign policy oversight also requires that these committees
address many of the same challenges plaguing their counterpart
committees in the intelligence and defense arenas. [One such challenge
is how to handle cross-jurisdictional issues in collaboration with other
oversight committees. Like the other committees examined in this series,
foreign policy oversight committees face numerous cross-jurisdictional
concerns. Congress' foreign affairs committees formally share
jurisdiction with the banking and commerce oversight committees on a
range of international trade issues, including export controls, overseas
trade promotion, the International Monetary Fund, and the Committee on
Foreign Investment in the United States. Informally, they compete with
the armed services committees on oversight of overseas military
operations, security assistance, and decisions to use military force.
And while the committees assert jurisdiction over diplomatic service,
the fact that numerous government departments --- including the
Departments of Agriculture, Commerce, and Treasury and the Federal
Bureau of Investigation --- maintain substantial foreign service or
embassy attaché programs can introduce challenges there, too. One of the
trickier issues has been the committees' roles in overseeing covert
action programs and other sensitive intelligence matters. In recent
years, leaks have appeared to increasingly put highly secretive covert
action programs in the headlines. Given the approval roles of U.S.
ambassadors as chiefs of mission in the countries where such actions are
conducted, foreign policy committees have argued they ought to be privy
to details about covert action programs before they are in the
headlines. Additionally, media coverage of alleged covert action
programs has dramatically affected sensitive diplomatic initiatives with
important countries, both partners and adversaries. Yet, the committees
are currently denied access to covert action compartments.]{.underline}
Committee leaders have sought arrangements that would enable the
committees' chairmen and ranking members to receive routine briefings
from the intelligence committees on relevant covert action details. Such
an approach seems rational and justifiable, and memoranda of agreement
between these committees, in coordination with the Executive Branch,
could set the terms of access and provide for policing of these
privileges. Another potential approach would be to formally create a
"Gang of Sixteen" --- expanding the current Gang of Eight, which
consists of the Republican and Democratic lawmakers in the House and
Senate and on the two intelligence committees, to include committee
leaders of both the defense and foreign policy oversight committees in
the House and Senate. While cumbersome, this approach would
appropriately recognize the increasingly multi-dimensional nature of our
national security environment. It would also enable more fruitful
consideration of cross-jurisdictional equities and help guard against
situations in which the Gang of Eight can become captive, voluntarily or
involuntarily, to the intelligence community. Cross-committee memoranda
of agreement could improve cross-jurisdictional oversight in other areas
as well, such as complex operations involving military, humanitarian,
and governance dimensions. Likewise, as previous articles in this series
have proposed for other committees, tools such as joint hearings and
cross-committee task forces may be beneficial. Whatever the mechanism,
increasing collaboration across artificial jurisdictional lines is an
imperative for effective oversight in our current security environment,
which no longer lends itself to stovepiped concepts of U.S. government
action and influence. Conclusion Oversight is a profound responsibility,
deeply embedded in the Constitution's grant of powers to the Legislative
Branch. Effective oversight means a serious, objective, and persistent
examination of whether the Executive Branch is making use of the
taxpayer resources entrusted to it in ways that are effective,
efficient, accountable, and in accordance with law and congressional
direction. It also means --- critically, in this era of increasingly
sophisticated threats and responses --- helping to educate the public.
To achieve both goals, it must be conducted with balance,
bipartisanship, and restraint against tendencies to pursue political
vendettas. [As this series has examined oversight committees in three
core areas of our national security --- foreign policy, defense, and
intelligence --- a few common themes have emerged. First, national
security oversight committees are understaffed and under-resourced.
Congress, which controls our nation's purse strings, is simply choosing
not to invest in oversight. In fact, according to research by the
Congressional Research Service (itself woefully underresourced), the
size of the staffs of these national security committees has not changed
significantly in the past two decades, despite monumental changes in the
national security landscape.]{.underline} According to the Congressional
Research Service's research, from 1987 --- before the fall of the Berlin
Wall, the rise of the internet, or the emergence of the 24-hour news
cycle --- to 2016, the number of professional and support staff serving
on the Senate's Armed Services, Foreign Relations, and Intelligence
Committees actually declined by one staff billet. Congress spends less
than \$25 million a year to sustain the House and Senate Armed Services
Committees responsible for overseeing defense and related activities
worth nearly three quarters of a trillion dollars annually. For such
sensitive and high-stakes activities, we cannot afford to pinch pennies.
[The lack of mechanisms for cross-jurisdictional oversight is an equally
problematic shortcoming. To conduct effective oversight of the myriad
multi-dimensional challenges we now face --- hybrid warfare,
cybersecurity, terrorism financing, to name a few --- cross-committee
collaboration must become the norm rather than the
exception.]{.underline}

#### Only the CP solves- Congress fails in oversight with arm sales- the CP ensures compliance

Saudi Arms Deals. It Can Again",

Most members of Congress accept that the U.S. will sell huge quantities
of weapons to the rights-abusing state. It doesn't have to be that way.
["That should've happened so fast that Congress couldn't step
in."]{.underline} These were the words of Democratic Senator Jeanne
Shaheen at February's prestigious Munich Security Conference, in a panel
discussion on whether President Obama should have used military force
against the Syrian government in 2013. The senator's comments succinctly
capture the "don't ask us" mantra that the current United States
Congress has increasingly followed when faced with questions of war,
peace, and America's role in the world --- a clear abdication of its
duties under Article 1 of the constitution. But not every Congress has
rolled over so easily. Indeed, in the past Congress has asserted itself
in ways that now seem almost unthinkable: denying and opposing
presidential requests for arms sales, scrutinizing intelligence
agencies, and questioning the foreign policy of the executive. Today's
elected representatives must look to this legacy if they are to save
themselves from irrelevance. "No Sale" "House Rings up 'No Sale' on
AWACS," ran the headline of an October 15, 1981 article in the Christian
Science Monitor. "AWACS" --- Airborne Warning and Control System planes
--- were, at the time, some of the most impressive pieces of equipment
that the American military machine could offer. Following the Soviet
invasion of Afghanistan and the Iranian Revolution in 1979, the Reagan
administration hoped to sell \$8.5 billion worth of these planes to
Saudi Arabia, ostensibly to "protect our vital interests in an unstable
area exposed not only to historic Arab-Israeli rivalries but
increasingly to threats from the Soviet Union and its proxies." Yet,
throughout a four-hour floor debate, members of Congress repeatedly
rebuked the executive. Although many were repeating the talking points
of the pro-Israel lobby --- objecting to the arms deal because Saudi
Arabia "bankrolls PLO terrorists" --- others cited fears of a "spiraling
Middle East arms race," "genuine concerns about the internal stability
of the Saudi Arabian government," and the potential for the loss of
"important technological secrets" if "the Saud royal family, an
unrepresentative ruling elite, should be overthrown." The House rejected
the sale by a margin of 301 to 111, but because the Senate narrowly
approved it after massive pressure from the president, Congress was
unable to exercise a legislative veto. However, the battle continued
throughout the 1980s, with legislators forcing the administration to
shelve proposed sales of F-15 fighter jets and maverick missiles to the
Saudi kingdom in 1987. Although Congress did not always prevail in these
disputes, it had acted on concern over what a 1982 congressional report
described as "the explosive growth of major cash sales of weapons to
Third World nations" in the 1960s and 1970s, along with "mistrust of the
executive branch in the wake of the Vietnam War and the Watergate
controversy." It passed legislation allowing for the veto of arms deals
worth over \$25 million with a joint congressional resolution of
disapproval. It mandated the disclosure of data on arms transfers at the
beginning of each year. And it even confronted the nation's intelligence
agencies and multinational corporations for abuses at home and abroad in
the famous 14 reports and countless hearings of the Church Committee.
President Reagan still sold weapons to Saudi Arabia, terrorized
Nicaragua, and funneled weapons to jihadists in Afghanistan, while his
successors showed little fidelity to the 1973 War Powers Resolution
passed in response to the excesses of the Nixon administration. But
members of Congress at least seemed eager to put up a fight. "Raising
Questions," Then Doing Nothing us-saudi-relations-obama-salman (Photo:
White House / Wikipedia) Fast-forward to 2010 and what was then the
biggest arms deal in U.S. history: \$60 billion worth of F-15s, F-15
upgrades, helicopters, missiles, night-vision goggles, and radar warning
systems --- all for Saudi Arabia. Several things had changed since the
1980s. The Soviet Union left Afghanistan and, of course, collapsed.
Fifteen Saudi hijackers contributed to the worst attack on U.S. soil
since Pearl Harbor. The State Department firmly identified Saudi Arabia
as "a critical financial support base for al-Qa'ida, the Taliban, LeT
\[Pakistan-based Lashkar-e-Taiba\], and other terrorist groups... which
probably raise millions of dollars annually from Saudi sources." So, if
anything, the strategic case for arming Saudi Arabia had diminished ---
and the dangers of pouring weapons and money into a theocracy with a
taste for foreign adventurism had become well-known. Yet President
Obama's arms deal encountered no serious opposition in Congress. 198
House members signed a letter of concern about the sale, but a proposed
joint resolution to block the sale never even made it to the floor for a
vote. Similarly, in January 2008, after the Bush administration notified
Congress that it wanted to sell the Saudis 900 JDAM bomb guidance kits,
a joint resolution of disapproval was also introduced, but failed to
pass. What explains Congress's quiescence? On the one hand, it seems
that Israel, while still uneasy about weapons flowing to Saudi Arabia,
is not objecting with the same force that it did in the 1980s. The
country is more confident now that it retains a "qualitative military
edge" in the region, and that Saudi support for Palestinian rights is
largely rhetorical. Thus, members of Congress who support the House of
Saud no longer have to fear a serious backlash from the "Israel Lobby."
There is some truth to this, but it's far from the whole picture.
Indeed, as noted above, past congressional opposition to Saudi arms
deals (in, for instance, the 1981 debates) has not focused exclusively
on Israel's concerns, but also fears about the stability of the Saudi
royal family, the proliferation of conventional weapons in the Middle
East, and even the belief that oil-for-arms is no sound basis for a
coherent foreign policy. Can Congress Resist the Arms Companies? [It is,
however, hard not to notice how congressional interest in arms deals has
receded as money from arms companies has increasingly lined the pockets
of representatives and their political action committees.]{.underline}
The defense sector fully supports equal opportunity here, giving
Republicans and Democrats \$16.9 million and \$11.1 million respectively
through the 2016 election cycle. This is up from \$10.8 and \$5.8
million in 2002, and \$4 and \$4.5 million in 1990. Of our 435 current
members of the House of Representatives, 389 have received some campaign
money from the defense industry, along with 96 out of 100 senators. Each
of the top five donors from the industry are among the top ten most
profitable arms companies in the world. [It's not always easy to prove
that this money independently impacts behavior, as elected
representatives never admit as much openly. Nevertheless, it's hard to
believe that your congressperson just happened to share the same policy
goals as Lockheed Martin --- and that the bag of cash was incidental.
The wider public certainly doesn't buy this argument.]{.underline} Some
young and relatively new members of Congress --- like Reps. Ro Khanna of
California and Tulsi Gabbard of Hawaii --- are trying to restore the
legislature's role in scrutinizing foreign policy and arms transfers.
Libertarian Republicans like Rand Paul have long pushed for this, only
to come up against decades of congressional lethargy, combined with the
financial and political power of Lockheed, Raytheon, Boeing, and
Northrup Grumman, among others. As Saudi Arabia continues to pummel
Yemen with American weaponry, the few voices of dissent on Capitol Hill
must be amplified. A bipartisan bill invoking the War Powers act to cut
off support for the Saudi campaign --- introduced on February 28 by
Senators Bernie Sanders (I-VT), Chris Murphy (D-CT), and Mike Lee (R-UT)
--- is an important step in this direction. [Come November, with the
public's help, such moves may even gain more co-sponsors and allies.
Until then, we can take heart from the fact that Congress has been here
before --- and, occasionally, done its job.]{.underline}

DISCRETION." 93 Notre Dame L. Rev. 1569. Lexis.

[The Supreme **Court**]{.underline} has often [recognized that
**e**xecutive **o**rders are **binding**, **supreme law**]{.underline}
so long as they comport with statutory and constitutional limits. A
useful example can be found [in Old Dominion Branch]{.underline} No.
496, where [the]{.underline} Supreme [Court held that labor
disputes]{.underline} between federal employers and federal employees
[were controlled]{.underline} (at that time) [by President
Nixon\'s]{.underline} [E]{.underline}xecutive [O]{.underline}rder 11491.
n142 The Court held that the executive order was \"a reasonable exercise
of the President\'s responsibility for the efficient operation of the
Executive Branch,\" not inconsistent with statutes; accordingly,
[the]{.underline} [Court]{.underline} further [**concluded**, \"we have
**no difficulty** **concluding** that the Executive Order is **valid**
and may create **rights** protected against inconsistent state laws
through the **Supremacy Clause**.\"]{.underline} n143 Indeed, if
executive orders are in fact legally binding, as suggested by the
historical experience outlined at the outset of this Article, then
[agencies]{.underline} would [lack any power or discretion to second
guess the President\'s judgment]{.underline}. [Agencies are not obliged
to respond to questions challenging the constitutionality of the
statutes that mandate their action]{.underline}, n144 [because they
cannot resolve squarely presented constitutional issues]{.underline}.
n145 If executive orders are superior law, just as statutes are superior
law, then agencies cannot challenge their lawfulness in the course of a
rulemaking. But this does impose upon the agencies and courts a duty to
discern whether an executive order genuinely is an executive order. As
noted above, not all presidential instructions are orders. Indeed, not
all executive orders are truly orders - some merely request that
agencies take action. n146 [Only once it is clear that the President has
ordered an agency to take action can an agency be bound]{.underline}.
And similarly, the agency and the court must be precise in defining
precisely what the President has ordered. In Sherley, the agencies\' and
court\'s work was made easier by the fact that commenters were clearly
challenging the President\'s order: he had ordered the agencies to
increase stem cell research funding, while the commenters wanted the
agencies to decrease or eliminate such funding. n147 Had the commenters
merely asked the agency to increase funding only by a small amount, then
the President\'s order would not have dictated the agency\'s outcome. In
that respect, Sherley seems to echo decisions by the Supreme Court and
D.C. Circuit recognizing the ramifications of [executive
orders]{.underline} that substantively **[tie agencies\'
hands]{.underline}**. The most immediate analogy would be to the OIRA
context itself. As noted above, the executive orders
[creating]{.underline} the centralized White House regulatory review
process included [**not just procedural commands**, but also

Foreign Policy Vacuum Created by an 'America First' White House?"

Since the end of the Second World War, the United States has been mostly
a force for order in the world. But many analysts argue that during the
first year of Donald Trump's presidency, America has become a deeply
destabilizing country. [Trump is often described as volatile and
provocative, dispensing with, and often shattering, established norms of
international behavior and civil discourse]{.underline}. He has derailed
the Trans-Pacific Partnership trade agreement, disparaged NATO and
withdrawn the United States from the Paris climate accord. He has
scolded America's most loyal allies in Europe and elsewhere, taunted
enemies such as North Korea and praised Russian President Vladimir Putin
even as Russia's meddling in the 2016 election continues to dog his
administration. Critics posit that Trump's White House staff is
inexperienced and lacks top-tier policy experts. The administration has
dueling power centers and a weak inter-agency process. Secretary of
State Rex Tillerson has struggled to find a clear role in shaping
American foreign policy. He has left scores of senior jobs unfilled and
has supported deep cuts in the State Department budget. Tillerson is
also frequently and publicly undercut by Trump. [A question cascading
across the United States and in overseas capitals is whether Congress
will step in to fill the void and stabilize American foreign
policy]{.underline} during this time of disruption from the White House.
"That's the big question and the answer is not clear to me," said Leon
Panetta in an interview with The Diplomat. Panetta is a former
congressman, White House budget director, White House chief of staff,
CIA director and secretary of defense. "We are in uncharted territory.
We have never had a president like this, certainly in modern times. [We
need to have some checks on this president who is
impulsive]{.underline}, who governs by tweets and whose tweets are
usually based on impulse and emotion, not any real analysis. [Can
**Congress** provide this check? **Probably not**]{.underline} by
itself, but it can be part of the answer," he said. Panetta pointed out
that [the **president** is **always the main driver** of America foreign
policy. "It's really clear that in our system the president has the
primary power to deal with foreign policy. Congress has a role to play,
but it's frankly]{.underline} a [secondary]{.underline} role. [It's very
difficult for 535 members of Congress to get their act together to
direct foreign policy]{.underline} and to get it in a better place.
[It's very difficult for Congress to agree on coherent alternatives to
the president's policies. This is an inherent challenge]{.underline} and
it's [made much worse now by our current partisan divisions. There is no
reason to believe the Republican leadership in Congress is willing to
challenge Trump]{.underline} on foreign policy," he said. That is not to
say that Congress is powerless, especially because it holds the
all-important power of the purse --- i.e., funding the government. This
means lawmakers can exert their will over the presidency in a variety of
ways. For instance, GOP defense hawks have largely dismissed the steep
budget cuts Trump has proposed for the State Department. Congress has
also pushed through tough sanctions on Russia and North Korea. And
because Trump has punted the issue of the nuclear deal with Iran to
Capitol Hill, it is now up to lawmakers to decide whether to reinstitute
sanctions on Tehran and potentially scuttle the agreement. Lawmakers can
also use the bully pulpit to spotlight issues. This is what Senate
Foreign Relations Committee Chairman Bob Corker (R-Tenn.) --- who has
publicly questioned the president's fitness and criticized his fiery
rhetoric on North Korea --- did with a recent hearing examining the
executive's authority to use nuclear weapons. But Corker told The
Diplomat that while Congress has considerable foreign policy powers, the
president's power is more substantial. "Under our system, the executive
branch has a lot of authority in foreign policy. [Congress
can]{.underline} play a role. We can [ask questions, hold
hearings]{.underline}, explore issues," Corker said. He added that
[Congress has control over the nation's finances but this]{.underline}
often [wields **limited influence** over foreign policy. "We do have the
power of the purse, but when you have American troops in harm's way,
there is an understandable **reluctance to cut off
funds**]{.underline}." Some analysts dispute the assertion that Trump's
foreign policy is perilous. Matthew Kroenig, an associate professor of
government at Georgetown University, argues that while this president's
approach is unconventional, his policies are basically sound. In an
April 2017 essay in Foreign Affairs, Kroenig said Trump has been
hammered by a negative and unfair press that has focused heavily on
early policy missteps, slowness in staffing national security positions
and controversial statements. He argues that critics often fail to give
Trump sufficient credit where credit is due. Trump's foreign policy, he
declares, is "for the most part, well suited for the challenges ahead."
He adds that Secretary of Defense Jim Mattis, National Security Adviser
H.R. McMaster and Secretary of State Tillerson constitute a top-notch
foreign policy team. Both House Speaker Paul Ryan (R-Wis.) and Senate
Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) often say it's more important to
pay attention to what Trump does than what he says, adding that Trump's
actual policies are conservative and sound. Still, the prevailing
perspective among foreign policy experts in both parties is that Trump's
approach to foreign policy is at least disruptive and often dangerous.
In an October 2017 essay in The Atlantic, Eliot Cohen, a professor at
the Johns Hopkins University's School of Advanced International Studies
and a former official in the George W. Bush administration, charges that
Trump's policies have substantially weakened the United States. He
concedes that Trump inherited a difficult set of international problems
but says he has made them much worse through incendiary language and
ill-conceived policies. "Trump seems incapable of restraining himself
from insulting foreign leaders.... He cannot himself articulate a
worldview that goes beyond a teenager's bluster. He lays out his
resentments, insecurities, and obsessions on Twitter for all to see,
opening up a gold mine to foreign governments seeking to undermine and
manipulate the American president," Cohen writes. "In short, foreign
leaders may consider Trump alarming, but they do not consider him
serious. They may think they can use him, but they know they cannot rely
on him.... And so, already, they have begun to reshape alliances and
reconfigure the networks that make up the global economy, bypassing the
United States and diminishing its standing." Cohen also contends that it
is now apparent Trump will not change. "Matters will not improve. Trump
will not learn, will not moderate, will not settle into normal patterns
of behavior. And for all the rot that is visible in America's standing
and ability to influence global affairs, more is spreading beneath the
surface," he asserted. "Even barring cataclysmic events, we will be
living with the consequences of Trump's tenure as chief executive and
commander in chief for decades." The Constitution divides foreign policy
authority between the legislative and executive branches. It gives
Congress the power to declare war, raise military forces and regulate
commerce. The Senate is also charged with providing advice and consent
on treaties and nominations. Much of **[the president's foreign policy
power comes from his executive authority]{.underline}** and his role as
commander in chief of the military. The president has the explicit power
to appoint and receive ambassadors and, thus, the power to recognize
foreign governments and conduct diplomacy. [Analysts say **the
president's most significant informal power** is having the **most
prominent platform and the loudest megaphone** to **set the agenda** of
American foreign policy. Former House Foreign Affairs Committee Chairman
Lee Hamilton]{.underline} (D-Ind.) [told]{.underline} The Diplomat
[that]{.underline} Congress has critical foreign policy powers if it
chooses to exercise them. "[Congress has]{.underline} considerable
[authority in foreign policy, but it has to focus its demands and be
**persistent**]{.underline}. [Congress can]{.underline} do a lot to
shape and influence American foreign policy --- if it wants to. It can
hold hearings and force the administration to explain and defend its
policies. It can [pass legislation]{.underline} to change policies, [but
that's hard to do]{.underline}. It can use its funding powers to support
programs and scare the hell out of the administration. This is a
powerful tool." [Hamilton does not anticipate the current
Republican-controlled Congress will challenge Trump on international
policy, however]{.underline}. "[The prospects are not good that this
Congress will do much]{.underline}. We seem to be in a period of
considerable passivity. [The leaders of the Republican Party are
**deeply reluctant** to take on Trump, probably because he remains
popular in a strong segment of the Republican Party]{.underline}. If
Trump's support among Republicans erodes further, Republican leaders may
become more active. But so far, they don't want to take on Trump
voters," he said. [Senate Historian Emeritus Donald Ritchie cautioned
that **Congress's international reach is limited.** "**Unlike the
presidency**, Congress is not a singular institution so it is very
difficult for it to act in a coherent way. It's **diverse** and
**diffuse** and this makes it hard for Congress to act in a coordinated
way on foreign policy]{.underline}," Ritchie said. "[Congress can direct
public attention to an issue, interrogate]{.underline} administration
[officials]{.underline}, ask hard questions, press for answers, [request
reports]{.underline}. It can [pass legislation]{.underline} related to
foreign policy, reject nominations and treaties, fund programs [or
withhold funds]{.underline} from programs. It can have a say on foreign
policy, **[but it's very hard for it to dominate the foreign policy
debate]{.underline}**," Ritchie said. Former Senate Foreign Relations
Committee Chairman Richard Lugar (R-Ind.) told The Diplomat that
Congress can play a constructive role on specific issues such as trade,
immigration reform and bolstering traditional alliances. He added that
[lawmakers can]{.underline} also [give]{.underline} thoughtful
[**speeches** that send **messages of assurance** to the
world]{.underline}. "We do need members to speak out forcefully and to
offer an informed view of the world. It takes a certain courage and a
clear view of the world. Are there risks? Yes, but this is important
work to do and this work is more important than the longevity of
individual careers," Lugar said. He cited Congress's role in challenging
the Reagan administration's policy on apartheid in South Africa in the
1980s and in creating the Nunn-Lugar program to secure weapons of mass
destruction in the former Soviet Union in the 1990s. Lugar, as a former
senator and a respected statesman, has delivered several wide-ranging
foreign policy speeches that challenge Trump's "America first" policy.
He hopes more lawmakers will use their platforms to articulate
worldviews that are more in line with America's traditions. "President
Trump's view of the world is negative. Others need to project hope and
optimism and let the world know there is still support for this
perspective in the United States," Lugar said. Congress will have ample
opportunity to project this perspective and influence American foreign
policy in the coming months. There will be renewed attention on the
international nuclear agreement with Iran that imposed strict
restrictions on the country's stockpiles of uranium and its ability to
enrich these materials. In return, the United States, the United Nations
and the European Union agreed to lift sanctions that have crippled the
Iranian economy. Under American law, the president must certify every 90
days that Iran is complying with this agreement. Trump declined to make
this certification in mid-October and Congress has 60 days to decide
whether to re-impose sanctions. Iranian officials view the certification
procedure as an internal American affair, but have signaled that if
sanctions are re-imposed, Iran would no longer feel bound by the
agreement. Congress must also approve a fiscal year 2018 budget that
funds the federal government. The final agreement is expected to reject
many of the spending cuts that Trump proposed for the State Department
and other international programs. In addition, many of the major
domestic proposals that Congress is grappling with, including tax reform
and immigration, have far-reaching international repercussions.
Individual lawmakers have also asserted themselves on various issues
during Trump's presidency. For example, [Sen. Tim Kaine
(D-Va]{.underline}.) and Sen. Jeff Flake (R-Ariz.) have reintroduced
legislation providing a new authorization for the use of military force
to guide America's battle against terrorism (also see "No U.S. President
Has Wanted a New AUMF. Congress Is Starting to Disagree" in the
September 2017 issue of The Diplomat). Kaine also [wrote a prominent
essay in Foreign Affairs]{.underline} this past summer [calling for a
new American grand strategy]{.underline} in a hyper-connected world.
[The nation needs a new]{.underline} bipartisan [security
strategy]{.underline}, Kaine wrote, **[but]{.underline}** added that
"**[the strategy]{.underline}** itself **[must come from the
president]{.underline}**, [to whom the Constitution gives significant
powers to formulate and execute foreign policy." He said ideas can come
from Congress, think tanks, academics, military leaders, diplomats,
foreign allies, journalists and citizens. But]{.underline} he observed
that [Congress has not been **assertive** in the foreign policy realm.
"Most **other nations**,]{.underline} furthermore, [are **used to strong
executives and expect the same from the U.S. president**. So **no
lasting strategy will ever catch hold absent a clear articulation by the
commander in chief**]{.underline}," he wrote.

University in Japan, "Congress Should Act on Khashoggi Murder", Pacific
Council on International Policy,

November 1, 2018)

A remarkable thing has happened in Washington since the dissident
columnist Jamal Khashoggi was killed inside the Saudi consulate in
Istanbul: Not only has Congress taken an activist role around the issue,
but it has done so in a way that stands in sharp contrast to the
divisive partisanship which has come to define the body in recent years.
Earlier this month, more than 20 senators --- a list that included
Republican and Democratic members of the Senate Foreign Relations
committee --- wrote a letter to President Trump calling for an
investigation into Khashoggi's disappearance. They invoked the Global
Magnitsky Act, legislation that authorizes sanctions against those
responsible for extrajudicial killings, torture or other serious
violations of human rights. The Trump administration seems almost
singularly focused on continuing lucrative arms sales to Riyadh, and
Trump surrogates such as his advisor and son-in-law Jared Kushner have
hinted that the benefits of the relationship to the United States will
win at the end of the day. Congressional outrage may have convinced the
Trump administration to leave Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin out of
an important investors' conference in Riyadh (Mnuchin still traveled to
Riyadh to discuss other matters of bilateral concern) and revoke the
visas of 21 identified suspects in the killing. But it does not appear
that Congressional outrage will convince the White House to reevaluate
the U.S. relationship with the Saudi monarchy. Rather, the Trump
administration seems almost singularly focused on continuing lucrative
arms sales to Riyadh, and Trump surrogates such as his advisor and
son-in-law Jared Kushner have hinted that the benefits of the
relationship to the United States will win at the end of the day.
[America's capacity to **promote human rights** is strongest when the
various tools it can bring to the table --- sanctions, diplomatic
pressure, and congressional action --- are deployed along with
high-level attention and pressure from the White House**. Absent policy
coherence at the top, the effectiveness of these tools quickly break
down**. Repressive regimes gauge the resolve of the United States. If
they sense that they can \"wait out\" any criticism emanating from
Washington, or if they sense that the criticism lacks teeth, they are
unlikely to cage their repressive behavior. This is especially true if
the foreign government knows the United States perceived that interests
are at stake. For example, Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed Bin Salman knows
that the Kingdom's support is critical to some of Trump's major foreign
policy initiatives, such as isolating Iran.]{.underline} America's
capacity to promote human rights is strongest when the various tools it
can bring to the table --- sanctions, diplomatic pressure, and
congressional action --- are deployed along with high-level attention
and pressure from the White House. [Accordingly, while ostensibly
promoting reforms, Mohammed Bin Salman has presided over the worst
escalation of repression in the kingdom's history, not to mention
pursuing a reckless war in neighboring Yemen. Not coincidentally, this
has coincided with Trump's presidency, and his administration's close
embrace of the crown prince. Mohammed Bin Salman may have concluded that
he could get away with such a brazen and brutal act, calculating that in
the end, the White House would have his back. If other autocrats see
Riyadh emerge from this crisis largely unscathed, America's ability to
promote human rights abroad will be left in tatters.]{.underline} The
Khashoggi affair is a moment for Congress to force the administration's
hand. [However, **Congress controls the purse strings and can reject
arms sales**. It has used this power in the past to ensure human rights
are part of U.S. policy, such as in the case of Egypt.]{.underline} But
it often does so in a way that gives presidents an easy way to
circumvent the legislation. For example, Congress previously inserted a
provision in the defense spending bill conditioning arms sales to Saudi
Arabia and the United Arab Emirates on an improved human rights record
in the devastating Yemen war. However, it left the determination of
compliance to Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, who certified that the
Saudis and Emiratis were complying with these conditions. Human rights
groups and the United Nations think otherwise. The Khashoggi affair is a
moment for Congress to force the administration's hand. One way Congress
could send a strong message is to mandate conditions on arms sales to
the Kingdom without a including a loophole that allows the White House
to waive the conditions based on national security considerations. [In
fact, Congress could be our last, best hope to check the president's
disregard for America's traditional human rights and democracy-promoting
role. While Congressional statements and threats may limit the Trump
administration's impulses to look the other way and hope that the news
of Khashoggi's killing is overtaken by new headlines, it is doubtful if
this will be enough to overcome Trump's instinct to avoid pushing the
kingdom meaningfully on human rights. **Legislative deference to the
executive branch rests on a lack of will rather than a lack of power.**
Congress took bold action around arms sales and human rights in the
1970s. But it is unclear if that kind of resolve exists among Trump's
Republican allies in Congress today. Legislative deference to the
executive branch rests on a lack of will rather than a lack of power.
While the U.S. Constitution gives Congress clear prerogatives over
foreign policy, since 9/11 members of Congress have too frequently
deferred to executive power. The Khashoggi affair could be a moment of
truth, when Congress takes determined action to push back on an
administration that has hurt America's moral standing in the
world.]{.underline}

[Which brings us to]{.underline} Donald [Trump. The world is now dealing

them.]{.underline} He just likes to talk about "tearing them up" no
matter what the consequences may be. [Trump is]{.underline} also [a
serial fabulist who lies with facility and frequency]{.underline} yet
has yet to pay any political penalty for his disinterest in truth.
Determined to outdo his predecessor in every way, [Trump uttered six
times as many falsehoods in his first 10 months as president as Obama
did in his entire two terms.]{.underline} [Add to that the frenetic
pasce of turnover within the White House and the cabinet, and you have
an environment where **no policy utterance can be expected to have a
shelf life greater than a week or two.**]{.underline} Under these
conditions, [why would any sensible government take America's word for
anything? Why would any halfway smart adversary make substantial
concessions to the United States in exchange for U.S. promises,
assurances, or pledges?]{.underline} [Why offer up a quid in exchange
for its pro quo?]{.underline} Based on its recent track record, and the
character of the current U.S. president, [no adversary would concede a
thing unless it were 100 percent certain the U]{.underline}nited
[S]{.underline}tates [would deliver as promised]{.underline}. "Trust but
Verify" indeed. Given this situation, how long will it be before those
with whom the United States is negotiating start demanding intrusive
verification procedures or other guarantees designed to ensure that
America doesn't sign a deal and then tear it up a year later or demand
that it be renegotiated? How long before other important states decide
they cannot base their foreign-policy decisions on expectations or
assurances from the United States because Washington simply cannot be
trusted to do what it says it will? There are already worrisome signs of
precisely this sort of trend. According to the Pew Research Center, the
number of people who trust U.S. leadership has dropped from an average
of 64 percent at the end of the Obama administration to roughly 22
percent during Trump's first year in office. Even more remarkably, a
larger percent of people around the world have confidence that Chinese
President Xi Jinping and Putin will "do the right thing in world
affairs" than the current U.S. president. When you're trailing those two
ruthless operators, it's time to start asking why nobody trusts you. To
be sure, this is not to say that nobody trusts anyone from the United
States anymore. U.S. business leaders continue to strike mutually
beneficial deals with foreign counterparts; the beleaguered and
understaffed diplomatic service continues to forge cooperative
arrangements all over the world; U.S. intelligence agencies continue to
collaborate with foreign countries under the protective umbrella of
mutual confidence; and countless military-to-military engagements take
place every day on a basis of mutual respect and regard. Indeed, given
the time, money, attention, and lives that the United States has
expended to reassure others about its credibility, it would be odd if
other states had no confidence in Washington at all. It would be a vast
overstatement, therefore, to conclude that past U.S. opportunism or the
unreliable character of Trump had led others to conclude that the United
States as a whole was totally unreliable. Nonetheless, acquiring a
reputation for being untrustworthy is costly. When trust disappears,
reaching cooperative agreements inevitably requires more intrusive and
formal stipulations and arrangements (like the JCPOA or most
multilateral trade agreements) in an effort to cover every possible
contingency and to make it easier to detect violations (and thus to
deter cheating). A lack of trust also encourages states to make
worst-case assumptions about what others will do and to prepare for
those contingencies. The United States has troops in South Korea because
it doesn't trust the North, and North Korea went to enormous lengths to
build a nuclear bomb because it doesn't trust the United States.

December 14, 2018)

Introduction and summary It has been 17 years since the Congress enacted
the Authorization for Use of Military Force (AUMF) against Al Qaeda and
the Taliban in response to the terrorist attacks on 9/11.1 However, the
AUMF, which empowered the president to use "all necessary and
appropriate force" against all actors linked to 9/11---those actors
being Al Qaeda and the Taliban---has been stretched beyond its original
intent. The United States is now relying on the AUMF as the legal
authority to conduct wars against multiple terrorist groups in at least
seven different countries.2 GET THE LATEST ON FOREIGN POLICY AND
SECURITY Email The duration of these conflicts---already the longest by
far in U.S. history---and the ever-expanding list of countries involved
has sparked justifiable concerns that the United States is caught up in
waging endless war.3 The wars now being fought in seven countries---all
relying on the authority of the AUMF---show no signs of ending either.
Moreover, there is no strategy for winning them, and their costs
continue to mount. The war in Afghanistan alone is costing 45 billion a
year in addition to the incalculable loss of American and Afghan lives.4
Yet Congress has been largely absent from the decision-making when it
comes to these wars. Tellingly, some congressional members, when asked
by reporters about military actions in Niger that cost the lives of four
U.S. service members, expressed surprise that the United States was at
war there.5 To the extent there has been congressional engagement, it
has largely focused on a debate about replacing the 2001 AUMF with a new
one. But simply enacting a new authorization to explicitly cover the
ongoing wars in any of these countries would fail to address the most
pressing question: What should be done about these ongoing wars, and,
most fundamentally, does it make sense for the United States to continue
them? Consequently, Congress should: Put on hold consideration of a new
or revised 2001 AUMF Request that the Trump administration provide, in
unclassified form, a complete list of countries in which the United
States is at war relying upon the 2001 AUMF; organizations the United
States is fighting in those countries; and the countries where the
United States is providing partner assistance against terrorist groups,
even if U.S. troops are not participating in hostilities Hold robust
hearings into these ongoing conflicts in the mold of the Fulbright
Hearings into the Vietnam War Use all available means to obtain critical
information about the state of the wars, including enforcement of
current reporting requirements on the executive branch Examine each
conflict separately---in a country-by-country, conflict-by-conflict
manner---to ensure that each conflict gets individualized congressional
oversight and that there is an individualized decision about how to move
forward in each case The issue confronting Congress is not whether to
authorize a new war---that was the question before it in 2001. Rather,
Congress must now decide whether the current wars should continue, and
if so, how? To answer that question, Congress must first conduct
meaningful oversight of the multiple wars now being fought. It is only
then that Congress and the American people will have a better
understanding of these ongoing conflicts and the best path forward in
each of them. [Trump's lack of strategy is a recipe **for endless war**
President Donald Trump inherited from the Obama administration a set of
conflicts in six countries---Afghanistan (including the border region of
Pakistan), Yemen, Somalia, Iraq, Syria, and Libya---relying on authority
of the 2001 AUMF and with significant guidelines and parameters.6 The
Obama administration published its policies, including detailed
descriptions of its rules for targeting combatants, limiting civilian
casualties, the battlefield capture of combatants, the detention of
combatants, and their prosecution in either criminal courts or military
commissions at the end of its term in office in December 2016.7 While
the Obama administration applied more stringent parameters to the scope
of the authority of the 2001 AUMF than the Bush administration did with
the global war on terrorism, both the number of countries in which the
United States was at war and the groups against which it was fighting
were larger by the end of the Obama administration than they were at the
beginning.8 Nearly two years into its own term, the Trump administration
has an incoherent strategy for the wars it's waging against terrorist
groups. One the one hand, the Trump administration has escalated the
wars, expanded into new countries, and cast off many of the limits
imposed during the Obama administration.9 On the other hand, President
Trump regularly claims that he wants to end U.S. involvement in these
wars. To date, he has yet to visit any of the troops in any of the
theaters of conflict, and his stated defense strategy is shifting toward
Russia and China and away from fighting terrorism.10 This incoherence is
contributing to concerns that the United States is mired in an endless
war. Under President Trump, the United States is known to be currently
at war in Afghanistan and the border region of Pakistan, Iraq, Syria,
Yemen, Somalia, Libya, and Niger, relying on the authorities of the 2001
AUMF.11 Without much, if any, public debate or discussion, the Trump
administration has escalated the U.S. involvement in each of these
conflicts.12 Specifically, the Trump administration has:]{.underline}
Nearly doubled the number of U.S. troops fighting in Afghanistan13
Dramatically accelerated the air war in Afghanistan, Syria, Iraq,
Somalia, and Yemen and loosened the rules of engagement14 Declared parts
of Somalia and Yemen to be areas of active hostilities, which previously
had not been designated15 Conducted twice the number of airstrikes in
Libya than have been publicly acknowledged16 Expanded the mission of the
nearly 1,000 U.S. troops in Niger, going beyond the original
train-and-assist mission announced by the Obama administration when it
first sent 100 troops to the country in 2013. He has expanded the
mission to include combat operations17 This silent surge stands in stark
contrast to the ambivalence President Trump and his administration have
shown toward these wars. Even while increasing the number of U.S. troops
in the war in Afghanistan, Trump has suggested that he wants to pull out
and never even met with the outgoing U.S. commander, Gen. John
Nicholson, in the 20 months their tenures overlapped.18 Trump has also
said he "want\[s\] to get out" of the fight against the Islamic State
(IS) in Syria.19 And, earlier this year---despite currently fighting
wars against terrorist groups in at least seven different
countries---the Defense Department announced it was shifting its focus
toward great power competition with countries such as Russia and China
and away from fighting terrorism.20 Stuck between escalation and
ambivalence, the wars grind on. More congressional oversight of the wars
is urgently needed Congressional oversight of the wars against terrorist
groups has been insufficient for some time now. But the
Republican-controlled 115th Congress did not do nearly enough to examine
the current state of these multiple ongoing conflicts, especially in
contrast to past congressional oversight of another long war in U.S.
history: Vietnam. That must change. The foreign policy and armed
services committees in both the House and the Senate have primary
oversight responsibility for the conduct of these wars. In 2017 and
2018, those four committees held a total of 16 full committee hearings
on the broad subject of these various ongoing wars or the countries in
which these wars are being fought. Of these hearings, there were only
three in the House, and three hearings in the Senate were closed.21
While public hearings were held on most of the conflicts in which the
United States is currently engaged, there were not nearly enough in
total, considering their importance. Both the House Foreign Affairs
Committee and the Senate Foreign Relations Committee held one full
committee hearing on Afghanistan during the 115th Congress.22 The fight
against IS in Syria and Iraq got more attention, but only in the Senate,
with four full committee hearings. There were no hearings on this
particular conflict in the House.23 And despite U.S. involvement in two
ongoing wars in Yemen, only two hearings were held during the 115th
Congress, both in the Senate Foreign Relations Committee.24 The way the
115th Congress handled the Niger ambush is particularly instructive.
Several members of Congress expressed surprise that the United States
was even fighting there when the ambush was publicly revealed. However,
there were no public hearings into U.S. military involvement there in
either the House or Senate.25 The Senate Armed Services Committee has
held the only two hearings on U.S. involvement in Niger. However, both
of those were closed and focused on the investigation and report on the
ambush that killed four U.S. Green Berets, not on the overall mission
and strategy in Niger.26 By contrast, the Senate Foreign Relations
Committee, under the leadership of Sen. William Fulbright (D-AR), held
two sets of probing examinations of the Vietnam War, one in 1966 and
another in 1971.27 The first series, in 1966, was a national sensation
featuring high-ranking administration officials and prominent former
government officials and thought leaders.28 The hearings were broadcast
live on both CBS and NBC, two of the three national television networks
at the time.29 And, over a five-week period in January and February
1971, Sen. Fulbright held 22 hearings over eleven days on Vietnam, more
than have been held in the entire 115th Congress by the four committees
described above.30 To its credit, the 115th Congress has adopted some
relevant reporting requirements. One such requirement, for example,
directs the Trump administration to provide an update to an Obama
administration report on the legal and policy frameworks for the United
States' use of force.31 But, in responding to this requirement, the
Trump administration provided less public information than had the Obama
administration. Notable action in this Congress related to the wars has
primarily occurred around the 2001 AUMF. In late June 2017, Rep. Barbara
Lee (D-CA) proposed an amendment to the Defense Appropriations Act that
would sunset the entire 2001 AUMF in 240 days. In a surprise move, the
House Appropriations Committee approved this amendment by a voice
vote.32 House Republican leaders stripped the provision from the bill
considered on the House floor.33 But the surprisingly easy win by
critics of the 2001 AUMF signaled much greater bi-partisan discontent
with the wars against terrorist groups than was previously understood.34
Senate Foreign Relations Committee Chairman Bob Corker (R-TN) and Sen.
Tim Kaine (D-VA) introduced a revised AUMF in May 2018, which is
intended to replace the existing 2001 AUMF and also repeal the 2002 AUMF
that authorized the Bush administration's invasion of Iraq.35 The
proposal explicitly authorizes all of the current wars that are being
fought under the 2001 AUMF and would establish a mechanism for expanding
the list of wars deemed authorized even without a congressional vote---a
list that would most certainly only increase over time. Essentially,
this new AUMF would enshrine endless war as the norm.36 The Senate
Foreign Relations Committee previously held two hearings on the AUMF in
this Congress but none on this new proposal.37 As it currently stands,
it does not appear as if this version of a modification to the 2001 AUMF
will move forward. [**Endless war is not inevitable if Congress plays
its proper role** Congress has not yet conducted sufficiently thorough
oversight of these complex and evolving conflicts to make an informed
decision about their continuation. And such decisions are a prerequisite
to deciding on the need for and consequences of any new or revised AUMF.
Therefore, revising the 2001 AUMF should be put on hold and Congress
must conduct an extensive assessment of the U.S. wars against terrorist
groups that claim 2001 AUMF authorization. Congress needs to examine
these conflicts in detail and, importantly, come to its own conclusions
about the current state of these wars and the best future direction for
each. In order to do so, the House and Senate foreign policy and armed
services committees should take a page from Sen. Fulbright's book and
hold a series of hearings with both administration witnesses and outside
experts to probe the wars in depth. The hearings need to be public, and
where there is relevant classified information, an unclassified summary
should be used in order to assure necessary information is communicated
broadly to both Congress and the American people. Furthermore, the
hearings should be supplemented by other means of obtaining the relevant
information, including written requests for information and reporting
requirements.]{.underline} As a threshold matter, Congress must require
the Trump administration to provide a complete and public list of all
countries in which the United States is currently engaged in military
operations claiming authorization under the 2001 AUMF and the identities
of the groups it is fighting. The Trump administration also needs to
publicly identify where it is providing lethal assistance to partners
and whether there is a risk that such assistance will involve U.S.
forces in military operations, as apparently happened in Niger.38 While
some of this information is outlined in the Trump administration's March
2018 report to Congress, that report includes a classified annex that
could list additional countries or enemies. For example, in an effort to
authorize all of the current wars, the Corker-Kaine AUMF included
authorization of force in Mali, even though that country is not listed
in the public section of the Trump administration's report on the
countries in which the United States is at war.39 These wars need to be
examined on a country-by-country, conflict-by-conflict basis to the
satisfaction of Congress and, ultimately, the American people. But there
are overriding questions common to all, including the following: What is
the current threat posed by each of the enemy groups to the United
States, to U.S. interests more generally, and to the population of the
country and region in which the enemy operates? What is the Trump
administration's estimate of the threat? Does it differ from Congress'
conclusions? How has that threat changed over time? How have U.S.
military operations and other factors affected the threat? What is the
Trump administration's strategy for dealing with the threat in each
specific country and is their description of their strategy consistent
with their actions? What are the strategic costs and risks, including to
the U.S. military, regional peace and security, and other U.S.
interests, of continuing with the status quo? What options are available
to the United States, including, in particular, diplomatic,
humanitarian, foreign aid, and multilateral alternatives to deal with
the threat? In the short-term? Medium-term? Long-term? What are the
costs and risks of such alternative options? There are also a set of
additional general questions relating to the unintended consequences of
U.S. military engagement, which need to be understood before deciding
how the United States should proceed. They include, for example: What
has been the effect of U.S.-inflicted civilian casualties on the
involved populations, even when those casualties have been
unintentional? What has been their effect on overall counterterrorism
efforts and efforts to promote democracy and human rights? Are
hostilities involving civilian casualties likely to continue? What can
be done to reduce civilian casualties? Similarly, what has been the
effect of the United States' use of drone strikes on the attitudes
toward the United States and toward the targeted terrorist groups by the
population in those countries where strikes have taken place? What has
been the overall effect of U.S. counterterror policies---torture and
unfair detention among others---that have been the subject of sustained
international criticism, such as those implemented at Guantanamo and Abu
Ghraib, even after the U.S. has changed those policies? Will continuing
current counterterror operations erode the ability of the United States
to champion the values of democracy and human rights around the world?
What has been the effect of the wars on overall regional stability? On
the growth of democratic and accountable regimes? On dealing with
sectarian and ethnic tensions? And what is the likely effect on these
areas going forward? At the same time, the bulk of the work Congress
needs to do requires examining the conflicts individually by country.
Such a country-by-country analysis is consistent with U.S. government
practices. That's the approach the U.S. government generally used in the
past when deciding whether to send U.S. military forces to fight abroad,
and it tracked its progress on that basis. Congress will have to decide
on a country-by-country basis regarding what to do going forward. Of
course, some of the conflicts bleed over national boundaries, and
conditions in one country have an effect on neighboring countries and
the region at large. But only a country-by-country analysis will provide
the necessary information to illuminate the available options. The
largest and most pressing conflict is in Afghanistan and across the
border of Pakistan. While the U.S. government still refuses to
acknowledge that it is fighting the Taliban and its allies with air
strikes in Pakistan, there is no doubt that such operations are part of
the ongoing war in Afghanistan.40 The war in Afghanistan is plagued by
multiple layers of stalemate. A complete military victory by either the
U.S.- and NATO-backed Afghan government forces or the Taliban and other
insurgents is extremely unlikely. Despite this military quagmire, there
is no sign of a political consensus between and within the warring sides
in Afghanistan on how to end the fighting. Moreover, in the United
States, there is neither the appetite for a return to a more robust
military commitment (for example, up to 100,000 troops) nor is there a
clear mandate for the withdrawal of U.S. military forces. That leaves
the United States with 15,000 troops fighting in Afghanistan at the cost
of \$45 billion a year with no identifiable plan for change.41 It should
be noted, that despite his announced desire to withdraw U.S. forces,
Trump has failed to begin serious discussions; examine the consequences
of U.S. withdrawal; determine how it could be responsibly accomplished;
and ascertain what could be done to ameliorate the conditions for the
Afghan people should the U.S. withdraw. Without detailing the many
specific questions that Congress needs to examine, this summary recital
illustrates the importance of a country-by-country review. Evaluation of
U.S. options and decisions on the way forward needs to be based on an
understanding of the local conditions, including the stance of the
national governments in each separate country. Each review needs to be
based on an evaluation of the specific threats posed by terrorist groups
operating in a specific country and on the position of U.S. allies,
including their willingness to help or their criticism of current
operations. The situation in Yemen, for example, with multiple conflicts
between both local groups and outside countries is much different from
the situation in Somalia. Similarly, the conflict against IS, which
continues in Syria and Iraq, must be understood in all the ways it
differs from the ongoing conflict against IS in Libya. Even though those
conflicts all involve IS and have created massive refugee crises, they
differ in many significant ways, including, for example, the response of
the national governments of each country. Once the policy options and
costs and benefits of continued U.S. military operations in each country
are understood, the analysis of the legality of any continued operations
will also depend on the country-specific conditions. For example, the
consent or lack of by the respective country's national government and
the existence of recognized armed conflicts in the country must be a
consideration. Moreover, one of the most important issues---the threat
posed to the United States or U.S. interests from terrorist groups---can
only be properly understood by looking at the groups operating in a
specific country. For example, the AQAP---the Al Qaeda group in
Yemen---has focused in the past on attacking U.S. targets, including
inside the United States, in a way that al-Shabab---the Al Qaeda
affiliate in Somalia---has not.42 Just as importantly, a
country-by-country examination is key to ensuring that Congress and the
American public are fully informed concerning all the places where the
U.S. military is fighting or is at risk of fighting terrorist groups. As
outlined above, it is not clear that Congress has been kept fully
informed of those places and conflicts. Moreover, it appears that
train-and-assist missions carried out by U.S. troops to aid countries in
Africa that may be confronting local terrorists or insurgencies pose
serious risks. Such risks include both loss of American life and
involvement in hostilities---conflicts that are neither authorized by
Congress nor known about by the American people. Conclusion [Many
congressional leaders and policy advocates have noted that the AUMF
enacted in 2001 has been stretched far beyond its original intent during
the unforeseen 17 years of war since.43 But simply enacting a new
authorization to explicitly cover the ongoing wars in any of the seven
countries noted above would not fulfill Congress' constitutional war
powers responsibilities. Over the past 17 years, Congress has failed to
fulfill its constitutional responsibility to decide whether the U.S.
should go to war in new countries or against new groups. The wars that
the United States are now engaged in were started without congressional
debate or vote. Fulfillment of its constitutional responsibility
requires Congress to examine the costs, benefits, and outcomes of and
alternatives to America's ongoing and seemingly endless wars. Congress
should do so in a manner that ensures that both it and the American
people are fully informed in order to be sufficiently positioned to
evaluate those questions and decide on a path forward. Only after
Congress concludes that task will the question of whether new legal
authorities are needed for these existing wars be an appropriate one for
consideration.]{.underline}
