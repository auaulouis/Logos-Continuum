#### Japan alliance is on the brink---perception of US abandonment guarantees prolif and East Asian war

**Monteiro 18** (Nuno P. Monteiro, Director of International Security
Studies and Associate Professor of Political Science at Yale University,
"Cascading Chaos in Nuclear Northeast Asia", The Washington Quarterly,
41:1, 97-113)

[Since the end of the Cold War, Japan's security concerns focus on a
rising and revisionist **China and** on **North Korea**
provocations.]{.underline} When Pyongyang first tested a nuclear weapon
in 2006, Prime Minister Shinzo Abe reaffirmed Japan's adherence to the
three nonnuclear principles, while President George W. Bush reasserted
the U.S. commitment to Japanese security.42 President Barack Obama
offered similar assurances after each subsequent North Korean nuclear
test.43 [Japan's nuclear forbearance is certainly made easier by
Japanese public opinion, which is frequently described as allergic to
nuclear weapons as a result of the attacks on Hiroshima and Nagasaki, a
feeling that was only reinforced with the disaster at
Fukushima.]{.underline}44 [Nevertheless, **reliable U.S. security
assurances**, supported by the presence of a large number of U.S. troops
in Japan, have played a **key role** in maintaining Japan's **unique
forbearance against nuclear weapons**.]{.underline} After all, Japan is
the world's third largest economy and possesses full control of the
nuclear fuel cycle, yet remains a nonnuclear state. [Faced with a rising
and increasingly assertive China and with a rapidly growing North Korean
nuclear ability to target the Japanese islands, Tokyo more than ever
**relies on U.S. security guarantees** to be able to deter aggression
without its own autonomous nuclear arsenal. Should the Trump
administration **question U.S. commitments** to its East Asian allies,
Tokyo may be pushed to **change its policy of nuclear
forbearance**.]{.underline} As with South Korea, Washington might still
attempt to deter Japanese nuclearization by imposing economic sanctions
on Japan while denying it credible security guarantees. [In our view,
despite the deep level of international integration of the Japanese
economy and the strong preference of Japanese leaders to remain embedded
in the U.S.-led economic order, the dire security situation in which
Japan would be left in this scenario would likely lead Tokyo to push
toward nuclear acquisition despite any sanctions.]{.underline} The key
source of instability in this scenario, however, would stem from
Beijing's likely reaction to a Japanese proliferation effort. Given the
short breakout period Tokyo enjoys, Beijing's leadership would have to
decide fast on China's policy[. A preventive counterproliferation strike
against Japan would be exceedingly costly and, for now, likely to be
beyond the technical capability of the Chinese military, but a forceful
**Chinese** reaction, including threats of military action, is not
beyond the realm of the possible. This risk of Japanese nuclear
acquisition would, of course, **be compounded by eventual South Korean
nuclearization**. Were Seoul to build an autonomous nuclear arsenal,
Tokyo would be greatly tempted to do so as well.]{.underline} In what
concerns U.S. nuclear nonproliferation policy, then, U.S. security
commitments to each of its two main East Asian allies are deeply
interconnected. [The removal of U.S. security guarantees to either South
Korea or Japan would trigger a process that would **vastly augment
instability in East Asia.**]{.underline}

US Credibility

A third error in the "abandon Taiwan" argument is its damaging effect on
US credibility for defending allies and partners. [For extended
deterrence to work, the credibility of the state for defending an ally
is critical.]{.underline} The deterrent state must make the adversary
believe that its commitment to defend the ally is credible. [A state's
credibility is linked across issues that share similar
dimensions]{.underline} such as geography, history, and strategic value.
[The state's action on one issue sends a signal to the adversary about
the extent of its interests on that issue. Because of issue linkage, the
adversary may use the information to update its assessment of the extent
of the state's interests on another similar issue. The state's
concession on one issue could cause the adversary to raise doubt about
the state's resolve in protecting another similar interest]{.underline}.
[Ending a security commitment to an ally would likely lead the adversary
to question the credibility of the state's commitment to another
ally]{.underline}. Moreover, [for allies, the same logic applies to
their assessment of the credibility of the state's security commitment
to them]{.underline}. **[The state's concession on another similar issue
could lead its allies to doubt the state's credibility for meeting its
commitments to them]{.underline}**. [This in turn could cause the ally
to reevaluate its strategic alignment,]{.underline} seek an alternative
partner, [or **embark on a military buildup**]{.underline}.39

**[The US security commitment to Taiwan is linked to the credibility of
the United States for defending allies and partners in
Asia.]{.underline}** A [decision to abandon Taiwan would damage US
credibility throughout the region]{.underline}. First, [China would
likely view the concession as a weakening of US resolve for protecting
other interests in Asia.]{.underline} [If China concludes that US
accommodation on Taiwan is a result of China's rising military
capabilities, the same shift in the military balance would likely lead
China to reduce its assessment of US resolve for defending other
interests in Asia. This might encourage China to adopt a more hardline
approach toward the Senkaku/ Diaoyu Islands dispute with Japan,
believing that China's rising power had weakened US resolve to defend
Japan. Seeing the United States as a "paper tiger," China might also
become more aggressive in pursuing its territorial interests in the
South China Sea]{.underline}. Thus, [abandoning Taiwan would have a
weakening effect on the credibility of similar US commitments in
Asia]{.underline}. As Nancy Tucker and Bonnie Glaser argue, "China would
respond to appeasement as have virtually all governments: It would
conclude that a weaker United States lacking vision and ambition could
be pressured and manipulated."40

Second, [abandoning Taiwan would reduce allies' confidence in the
credibility of US security commitment to them]{.underline}. [Given the
similarity in geographical location, Japan would]{.underline} likely
[see the accommodation of China on Taiwan as a weakening of US resolve
in contesting Beijing's claims to disputed oil fields and islands in the
East China Seas]{.underline}. [The change in regional balance of power
in China's favor combined with a perceived weakening of US credibility
could lead Tokyo to **relax its constitutional constraint on the armed
forces**]{.underline}. [A remilitarized Japan would amplify security
concerns across the region]{.underline}. [South Korea]{.underline},
facing the diminished credibility of the US alliance, [might calibrate
that its security is better served by realigning with
China]{.underline}, as ancient Korea did in the Chinese tribute system.
Likewise, [Southeast Asian states would see US accommodation on Taiwan
as a weakening of credibility in contesting Chinese territorial claims
in the South China Seas.]{.underline} [At a time when Asian states need
the United States to counterbalance Chinese power, a US decision to
abandon Taiwan would be particularly alarming, **sending shock waves
across the region.**]{.underline} As Shelley Rigger argues, "[If
Washington appears to be backing away from its commitment to the
alliances and institutions in which it has invested so much, other
governments will take that as a sign that they may not be able to rely
on US-backed security arrangements to ensure their future security,
forcing them to become more competitive and
individualistic.]{.underline}"41

[The history of the Korean War demonstrates the logic of issue linkage
for the credibility of extended deterrence]{.underline}. [Despite North
Korean leader]{.underline} Kim Il [Sung's repeated requests for Soviet
assistance in attacking South Korea, Stalin rejected him for fear of a
possible US intervention]{.underline}. [When US Secretary of State Dean
Acheson made an important speech in]{.underline} January [1950 outlining
US defense perimeter in Asia, the line of defense]{.underline} extended
from the Aleutians through Japan and Okinawa to the Philippines---both
[Korea and Taiwan were conspicuously left out. This omission led to the
Communist assessment that the United States would not intervene in the
Korean peninsula, **which caused US deterrence failure**]{.underline}.
As one North Korean official recounted, after the Acheson speech Kim Il
[Sung "was convinced that the US would not enter the Korean
War."]{.underline}42 North Korea's invasion of South Korea on June 25,
1950, caught the United States by surprise. [At stake was US
credibility]{.underline}. "A North Korean victory," writes historian
Chen Jian, "would damage the credibility of American policy in East
Asia."43 [The outbreak of the Korean War compelled the United States to
send troops to shore up its credibility in Asia.]{.underline} As Thomas
Christensen points out, "Truman dispatched American forces in order to
punish aggression and save American reputation for resolve against
communist expansion."44 [In the end, the United States paid a high price
to shore up its credibility]{.underline}.

Thus, [if Washington ends its commitment to Taiwan and China uses
military force against the island, it would be **extremely difficult**
for the United States to stand on the sidelines without **damaging US
credibility across Asia**]{.underline}. [Circumstances
would]{.underline} likely [compel the United States to intervene and to
save its reputation from further deteriorating---but at **a much higher
cost**]{.underline}.

#### East Asian prolif causes nuclear war. 

**Tan 15** -- Associate Professor At the University of New South Wales
(Andrew T.H., Security and Conflict in East Asia, p. 31)

[East Asia's arms race leads to the classic problem of the security
dilemma, in which a state that is perceived as becoming too powerful
leads to counter-acquisitions by other states. This results in
misperceptions, conflict spirals, heightened tensions and ultimately
open conflict, thereby destroying the very security that arms are
supposed to guarantee]{.underline} (Jervis 1976). East Asia's sustained
economic rise since the end of the Korean War in 1953 and [the lack of
any major conflict since has lulled many into believing that growing
economic interdependence will make war unlikely in that
region]{.underline} (Khoo 2013: 47-48). However, **[this is a false
premise as significant historical antagonisms have
remained.]{.underline}** [Japan's imperialism prior to 1945 and its
failure adequately to account for its past continues to stir up strong
nationalist emotions in China and South Korea]{.underline}. In
additions, **[the divisions between North Korea and South Korea are as
strong as intractable as ever, leading to an arms race on the Korean
peninsula]{.underline}**. [The situation is compounded by the weakness
or absence of regional institutions, regimes and laws that could
regulate interstate relations, build trust and confidence- and
security-building measures]{.underline} which were in pace in Europe
during the Cold War and helped to calm tensions as well as contain the
arms race exist in Asia. Within East Asia itself, [the Six-Party Talks
have focused only on the Korean issue and have not managed to stem North
Korea's open brinkmanship]{.underline} that in early 2013 almost brought
the Korean peninsula to war again. [The arms race in East Asia is
dangerous owing to the increased risk of **miscalculation as a result of
misperception**]{.underline}. Chinese policymakers appear to be
convinced that Japan is dominated by right-wing conservatives bent on
reviving militarism (Glosserman 2012). At the same time, [there is also
a perception within China that given its growing strength, it should now
aggressively assert what it perceives to be its legitimate claims in the
East and South China Seas]{.underline}. Thus, China's nationalist
discourse perceives that the problems about disputed territory emanate
from other powers, not China (Sutter 2012). [The consequences of
conflict between China and Japan, on the Korean peninsula or over
Taiwan, however, will not stay regional]{.underline}. As a key player in
East Asia[, the USA, which has security commitments to Japan and South
Korea, residual commitments to Taiwan, and troops on the ground in East
Asia and in the Western Pacific, **will be drawn in.** The problem is
that any conflict in East Asia is not likely to remain conventional for
long]{.underline}. In fact, **[it is likely that it would rapidly
escalate into a nuclear war]{.underline}** [because three of the key
players, namely China, North Korea and the USA, possess nuclear
weapons.]{.underline}

2\. [Security cooperation is **generally strong**]{.underline} --- and
expanding to new frontiers [Despite Trump's]{.underline} well-known
[criticisms of alliances and burden-sharing, this visit was devoted to
reaffirming the commitment of the U]{.underline}nited
[S]{.underline}tates [and Japan to their long-standing security
relationship]{.underline}. Trump visited the U.S. naval base at Yokosuka
and gave a speech aboard the USS Wasp emphasizing American military
might. He also visited the JS Kaga, an Izumo-class helicopter carrier
that Tokyo views as a symbol of its increasing contributions to the
alliance and to regional security. In addition, [the two leaders
announced plans for a]{.underline} U.S.-Japanese manned [moon
mission]{.underline}, a new area of bilateral cooperation that directly
responds to recent Chinese actions. In January, China became the first
country to land on the far side of the moon, and its space exploration
ambitions have reinvigorated U.S. interest in returning to the lunar
surface for the first time since 1972. [Trump directly linked the joint
mission to security concerns]{.underline}, saying, "From a military
standpoint, there is nothing more important right now than space." 3.
[But the allies continue to suffer from mixed signals]{.underline} [The
two leaders' symbolic displays of the strengths of the U.S.-Japan
relationship danced around **latent tensions in the security
arena**]{.underline} --- as illustrated by their divergent treatments of
the North Korean issue. For Japan, [Trump's visit was an opportunity to
**coordinate policy** and keep Tokyo's views in the picture]{.underline}
--- and minimize chances that Japan will be surprised by future
developments in U.S. talks with North Korea. Japan scored at least one
win. Trump met with the families of Japanese abductees on Monday,
reaffirming U.S. support for securing the return of Japanese citizens
kidnapped by North Korean agents in the 1970s and 1980s. This was a
political boon for Abe, who has been an advocate for the abductees'
return since early in his career. However, the visit also exposed
worrying gaps in the allies' perspectives. Trump minimized concerns
about North Korea's recent short-range missile tests, claiming that he
was personally not bothered by them. But the missiles that Trump
dismissed as "small weapons" pose a serious threat to Japan due to its
proximity to the Korean Peninsula. Abe hedged. He expressed "great
regret" over the tests and insisted that they violated U.N. policy, yet
he also maintained that Japan and the United States are "perfectly
aligned" with regard to sanctions. What happens now? Abe and Trump
pulled off a showy demonstration of the bonds between their two
countries. In addition to the personal rapport between the two leaders,
the U.S. and Japan share many common interests --- as well as common
adversaries. However, [Trump's trip]{.underline} also [revealed
persistent and troubling areas of divergence on]{.underline} issues such
as [trade and North Korea]{.underline}. [The U]{.underline}nited
[S]{.underline}tates [and Japan will eventually have to tackle these
disagreements.]{.underline} **[But]{.underline}** with this visit,
**[that day of reckoning seems to have been postponed]{.underline}** a
while longer.

#### Reduced arms sales shatters US alliance credibility and signals appeasement to China 

**Tucker & Glaser 11** (Nancy Bernkopf Tucker, Professor of History at
Georgetown University, PhD from Columbia, & \*Bonnie Glaser, Senior
Chair Fellow with the Freeman Chair in China Studies at CSIS, MA from
John Hopkins, "Should the United States Abandon Taiwan?," The Washington
Quarterly, Sept 14, <https://doi.org/10.1080/0163660X.2011.609128>)

Maintain, and Improve, Taiwan Ties In the 1940s, a vicious debate over
losing China tore at the fabric of U.S. politics. Although China had
never been America's to lose, diplomats, scholars, and politicians
involved in U.S.---China relations suffered. Neither they nor their
attackers could have imagined a time when prominent Americans would
publicly advocate giving away the Republic of China on Taiwan. So should
and will the United States abandon Taiwan? To date, Washington has not
decided to jettison Taiwan. And it should not. However frightening or
seductive China is, appeasing it by [sacrificing Taiwan would not be
good policy. Doing so might]{.underline} simplify and [improve
U.S.---China relations, but **only temporarily**]{.underline}. [China
would]{.underline} respond to appeasement as have virtually all
governments: it would [conclude that a weaker U]{.underline}nited
[S]{.underline}tates lacking vision and ambition [could be pressured and
manipulated]{.underline}. **[Both friends and rivals regionally and
globally would decide that the United States was not to be
trusted.]{.underline}** But, [if the United States]{.underline} will not
sever ties, should it nevertheless reduce its commitments to Taiwan? For
example, should the United States [curtail]{.underline} or forego [arms
sales]{.underline}? This might appear a compromise, avoiding both a
sharp break and the maintenance of a difficult status quo. The problem
is that [such an approach]{.underline} [would have]{.underline} largely
**[the same consequences as abandonment]{.underline}**: [Beijing
would]{.underline} still [see it as a demonstration of weakness,
and]{.underline} would seek to **[take advantage]{.underline}**. [Ending
arms sales]{.underline} while pledging to defend Taiwan should China
launch an unprovoked attack, as some have suggested, is unworkable
because [Taiwan would soon lack the capability to hold out until U.S.
forces arrive]{.underline}.23 Alternatively, selling arms, but making
clear that the United States would not intervene, would undermine
deterrence since China knows it can overwhelm Taiwan's limited
capability.

[Proposals to scale back US security ties to Taiwan are
controversial]{.underline}, however, and several scholars have written
thoughtful critiques of the idea. These critiques have generally made a
few key points. First, it is not self-evident that ending security ties
with Taiwan would in fact transform the US-China relationship: the
interests of the two countries arguably clash on many other issues
(North Korea, maritime disputes in East Asia, economic issues), and it
is unclear why Beijing would yield on these other issues if only the
United States were to adopt a policy on arms sales that---from Beijing's
vantage---the United States had already committed to follow in the 1982
joint communiqué. Second, [the U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates'
[reputation in the region could be at stake]{.underline}. Some worry
that [walking away from a commitment to Taiwan would send a troubling
**signal** to **other US allies in East Asia**]{.underline}. [Beijing
might]{.underline} likewise [view US concessions on Taiwan as a sign of
weakness and conclude that Washington was **unlikely to challenge the
PRC on other issues in the region**.]{.underline} Third, ending arms
sales---because it would add to Taiwan's sense of insecurity---could
actually make Taipei more hesitant about entering into sensitive
political talks with the PRC; thus it isn't clear that a reduced US
commitment to Taiwan would facilitate a peaceful resolution to the
dispute. Finally, and relatedly, ending arms sales would likely undercut
Taiwan's deterrent capabilities, which in turn could encourage a more
coercive PRC approach to the island.10

Taiwan will not help us with China," 11-29,
<http://www.aei.org/publication/why-giving-up-taiwan-will-not-help-us-with-china/>)

[Taiwan Still Matters to US Interests]{.underline} While Gilley may be
right in the long run---Taiwan's people and leaders may decide someday
that US defense assistance has become an obstacle to their preferred
path of rapprochement with the PRC---for now, [the]{.underline}
conventional strategic and normative [arguments for keeping the defense
relationship in place remain compelling.]{.underline} The most-cited
strategic argument for continuing US security assistance to Taiwan is
that [the existing security architecture in the Asia-Pacific region and
beyond serves the interests of many nations]{.underline}. Within the
network of global security relationships, [Washington's behavior toward
Taiwan indicates its attitude toward security assistance generally,
including its alliance commitments and willingness to honor other
obligations around the world]{.underline}. As retired admiral Eric
McVadon said, "[**American credibility as an alliance partner and as a
bulwark of peace and stability in the region and around the world would
be sorely diminished** were we to]{.underline} abandon the \[Taiwan
Relations Act\], [cease support of Taipei, and lead Beijing to conclude
that it can attack Taiwan and not be repulsed]{.underline}."\[6\] The
system of alliances the United States constructed in Northeast Asia
after World War II and the Korean War is not to be discarded on a whim.
From 1895 to 1945 Japan, Russia, and China battled for regional
supremacy, devastating huge swaths of Korea and China. American security
guarantees put in place in the mid-twentieth century suspended those
conflicts. [Ample evidence exists in current affairs---including
conflicts over contested islands in the East and South China Seas---to
suggest that military rivalry could return to East Asia.]{.underline}
[The US presence]{.underline}, however it may offend China, [actually
**lightens Beijing's military burden** by **restraining neighboring
countries' military investments** and **easing their strategic
anxiety**.]{.underline} As Glaser acknowledges, "the U.S. alliance with
Japan also benefits China by enabling Japan to spend far less on
defense. [Although the U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates' [power
far exceeds Japan's, China has seen the alliance as adding to regional
stability, because it fears Japan more than the U]{.underline}nited
[S]{.underline}tates."\[7\] Taming the military rivalries that once
ravaged Northeast Asia freed countries in the region to pursue domestic
development and provided a foundation for explosive economic growth and
a liberal economic order based on free markets and open trade. [Military
alliances stabilized the international system]{.underline} while new
economic and political organizations from the United Nations to the
World Trade Organization nurtured nations' shared interests. [This
system, in which the U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates [has
served as chief enforcer and guarantor, secured six decades of peace,
stability, and prosperity in]{.underline} non-Communist [Northeast
Asia.]{.underline} This US-led order is far from perfect. Developing
countries suffered terribly from proxy wars and economic isolation
during the Cold War, and since then new threats---from climate change to
transnational terrorism---have appeared. Although the bipolar
competition between two superpowers has disappeared, the need for global
cooperation to address economic and military challenges has not.
[Nations continue to look to the U]{.underline}nited
[S]{.underline}tates [to provide leadership in mobilizing]{.underline}
that [cooperation and addressing]{.underline} those [threats, and how
the U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates [manages its relationships
with]{.underline} longtime friends, including [Taiwan, is **an important
measure of its commitment** to that leadership role.]{.underline} Glaser
dismisses the idea that security assistance to Taiwan helps sustain the
postwar security architecture in East Asia. He writes, "the risks of
reduced U.S. credibility for protecting allies . . . should be small,
especially if any change in policy on Taiwan is accompanied by
countervailing measures."\[8\] Certainly, other nations differentiate
between Taiwan---which not only is not a formal US ally, but which the
US government does not even recognize as a state---and other US defense
partners. Nonetheless, **[no competent security planner would dismiss a
US retreat from a long-standing security commitment as
irrelevant]{.underline}**, [especially if it appears driven by American
weakness]{.underline}. [If Washington appears to be backing away from
its commitment to the alliances and institutions in which it has
invested so much, other governments will take that as a sign that they
may not be able to rely on US-backed security arrangements to ensure
their future security, forcing them to become more competitive and
individualistic]{.underline}. According to retired Army colonel and
military analyst Albert Willner, [America's friends already are on the
alert for signs of a decline in US commitments]{.underline}. He said in
an interview, "There is a growing sense in the world that the US is a
fair-weather friend, it won't be there for the long run. This causes
people in many countries to maneuver ahead of time, to get into position
in anticipation of the day the US pulls back. If the US makes decisions
regarding Taiwan that reinforce this perception, it will have profound
implications for our other relationships." [Another strategic interest
the U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates [has in maintaining close
ties to Taiwan rests with Taiwan's position on the front line of China's
rise]{.underline}. China's behavior toward Taiwan indicates how it will
perform its role as a lead actor on the world stage. As Randall
Schriver, a former deputy assistant secretary of state for East Asian
and Pacific affairs, put it, "Beijing's ambitions go beyond Taiwan, but
right now, it's the Taiwan issue that drives their military
modernization, so it's very important to us. Taiwan is a prism through
which we can understand China's evolution, and gain insights into it."
Richard Bush, a leading analyst of the US-PRC-Taiwan relationship,
summarized these concerns when he said, "How the [Taiwan]{.underline}
Strait issue is resolved [is]{.underline} an important test---perhaps
[the most important test---of what kind of great power China will be and
of how the US will play its role as the guardian of the international
system]{.underline}." By extension, [how the U]{.underline}nited
[S]{.underline}tates [and its allies treat Taiwan is an important
indicator of what other countries in the region can expect from
Washington as the PRC's influence expands]{.underline}. [They may ask,
if the U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates [acquiesces to a rising
China on the Taiwan issue, will it also acquiesce on issues important to
them?]{.underline}

[Abandoning Taiwan would erode American credibility in the Indo-Pacific
and add fuel to an ongoing **regional arms race**]{.underline}. Taiwan
policy cannot be compartmentalized, and viewed in isolation from the
pivot and U.S. policy towards Asia. [Decision-makers in Seoul, Tokyo,
and Manila would]{.underline} naturally [question U.S. resolve and
Washington's commitment to their security in the event of an abandonment
of Taiwan]{.underline}. [**Japan, in particular, would feel threatened**
by the stationing of Chinese forces on Taiwan]{.underline}---in essence
losing a valuable geopolitical buffer---[in such close proximity to its
southwestern approaches]{.underline}. [Heightened threat perceptions in
Tokyo, if combined with a lack of faith in the credibility of
U.S.]{.underline} conventional and nuclear [deterrence, **could lead
Japan to acquire a nuclear-weapons capability**]{.underline}. [The
corrosive effect of forfeiting Taiwan would]{.underline} also [extend to
other key allies such as South Korea, which might question Washington's
determination to defend it from North Korean aggression]{.underline}.
Indeed, [recent public-opinion polls have indicated that a growing
proportion of the South Korean public now favors the development of a
South Korean nuclear arsenal]{.underline}. Revealingly, [the reasons
invoked for such a shift were growing concerns]{.underline} over North
Korea's increasingly unpredictable and belligerent behavior, as well as
[over the continued viability of the U]{.underline}nited
[S]{.underline}tates' [security guarantee]{.underline}. Meanwhile,
[smaller regional states might find themselves both disinclined to place
their faith in the U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates, [and cowed
into submission by a more self-assured and advantageously positioned
China.]{.underline} [An abandonment of Taiwan could thus lead
to]{.underline} a creeping Finlandization---or **[rapid
nuclearization]{.underline}**---[of large tracts of the Indo-Pacific,
and,]{.underline} in time, [to **the sunset of American primacy in
Asia**]{.underline}. Taiwan, therefore, most certainly matters.

particular attention to public perceptions of nuclear armament. The
**[statistical analysis]{.underline}** relying on the survey data in
Japan has [found]{.underline} that [**people's threat perceptions**
powerfully determine their attitudes toward **nuclear
armament**]{.underline}. Specifically, the results indicate that it is
[people's perceptions of China as a military threat that **significantly
boost** their support for nuclear armament.]{.underline} Consistent with
the security model of nuclear proliferation, this study has verified
that [threat perceptions]{.underline} [powerfully shape the content of
public opinion regarding nuclear weapons]{.underline} (Beckman, 1992:
14). These findings have important implications for the prospect of
nuclear proliferation involving Japan. As of now, [most]{.underline}
scholars [dismiss the possibility]{.underline} of Japan's nuclear
armament. [Hughes]{.underline} (2007) [suggests]{.underline} that a
variety of [domestic constraints]{.underline} that [are]{.underline}
deeply [embedded]{.underline} in Japan will continue to prevent Japan
from pursuing the option of nuclear armament. Similarly, Yoshihara and
Holmes (2009) maintain that Japan will try to secure its survival in
strengthening its ties with the United States rather than attempting to
develop nuclear weapons (Hughes, 2006). **[Under the assumption that
Japan is protected by the US security guarantee]{.underline}**, Japan's
nuclear armament is unlikely. However, **[this does not mean that Japan
will never consider the option of nuclear armament]{.underline}**. Based
on the findings from this study, **[we can predict that people's support
for Japan's nuclear armament will grow along with increasing levels of
military threat from China]{.underline}**. [As China becomes more
aggressive with its growing military capability, the Japanese will be
increasingly concerned about the situation]{.underline}. As a
consequence, it is possible that Japan will eventually embrace the
option of nuclear armament to counter the threat from China. [As
Japanese history shows, a state's path **can change
drastically**.]{.underline} A state that was dictated by the fascist
ideology was transformed into a 'peaceful' country after the end of
World War II in 1945. [Facing external threat, one cannot deny the
possibility that Japan may turn its course once again to become a more
aggressive state]{.underline} in the international system. Indeed, [one
can observe a number of changes in Japan that could drive the country
toward the option of nuclear armamen]{.underline}t (Tanter, 2005). The
recent debate concerning the possible revision of the Japanese
constitution should be understood in this context (Japan Times, 2013).

[In Japan, members of the Liberal Democratic Party are more open to the
idea of nuclear weapons]{.underline}. Despite Japan's three non-nuclear
principles --- no possessing, manufacturing, or allowing nuclear weapons
on its territory -- [some LDP officials propose reinterpreting the
Constitution to permit some form of nuclear protection]{.underline}.
Former LDP Defense Minister Shigeru Ishiba suggested allowing U.S.
nuclear weapons on Japanese soil to deter North Korea, though he
condemned manufacturing their own weapons.\[8\] [This position is still
highly controversial in Japan: recent numbers show that fewer than one
in ten Japanese citizens support nuclear armament**, yet the LDP has
continued to win elections.\[9\]**]{.underline} Most recently, Prime
Minister Shinzo [Abe **received a stronger mandate** after calling for
snap elections in October 2017.\[]{.underline}10\] While LDP policies
extend beyond North Korea, [Abe campaigned on building up the Japanese
military and revising Article 9]{.underline}.\[11\] **[With the new
elections, Abe obtained the necessary majority to do so and plans to
rewrite the constitution by 2020.\[]{.underline}**12\] Despite the lack
of popular support among Japanese citizens, they would likely be more
inclined to accept nuclear armament if South Korea did so first. When
discussing a nuclearized Japan and South Korea, many scholars speak of
both acquiring nuclear weapons rather than simply one country. If the
security situation becomes dire enough, Japan will have little choice
but to allow nuclear weapons on its territory. [Japan and the U.S.
cooperate closely on security, but as early as 2012 the LDP recognized
Japan must do more to protect itself.]{.underline} When the opposition
party, the Democratic Party of Japan, lost to LDP in 2012, the ruling
government issued a new National Defense Program Guidelines (NDPG). It
expressed the need to maintain and strengthen ballistic missile defense,
in particular, to address the threat of nuclear weapons. The document
explicitly mentions North Korea, China, and Russia as posing the
greatest risks to Japanese security, though the government recognized
that the likelihood of conflict remained low at that time.\[13\] While
the NDPG states that Japan will play a "rigorous and active role in
nuclear disarmament and non-proliferation efforts," it also recognizes
that Japanese defense must be constantly reevaluated to ensure it is
meeting the necessities of the current security environment.\[14\] Given
North Korea's recent antagonistic behavior, Abe will likely try to
expedite the process of redefining Japan's pacifist constitution in
order to comply with the NDPG's directive of changing defense to meet
the security conditions. [Many in the international community have
expressed concerns over Japan's new]{.underline} defensive
[attitude]{.underline}, particularly at the UN. Every year, Japan
submits a resolution to the UN General Assembly on nonproliferation and
the elimination of nuclear weapons. This year, however, delegates
expressed apprehension about the wording of the resolution, raising the
possibility that Japan watered down the language in order to justify the
potential use of nuclear weapons.\[15\] Japanese officials claim,
however, that they faced pressure from the U.S. to make this
change.\[16\] [In the text of the resolution, rather than acknowledging
"the catastrophic humanitarian consequences of any use of nuclear
weapons," the new resolution says, "the catastrophic humanitarian
consequences of nuclear weapon use."\[17]{.underline}\] [This small
change in language contains drastic implications for Japan's efforts in
fighting North Korea because it no longer excludes the use of nuclear
weapons against the regime]{.underline}. **[The resolution demonstrates
that Japan is willing to risk its international image as the leader of
the nonproliferation movement in order to counter North Korea. Perhaps
the next step is to adjust its nuclear policy.]{.underline}**

//

ROKKASHO, Japan --- [More than 30 years ago]{.underline}, when its
economy seemed invincible and the Sony Walkman was ubiquitous, [Japan
decided to build a recycling plant to turn nuclear waste into nuclear
fuel.]{.underline} It was supposed to open in 1997, a feat of advanced
engineering that would burnish its reputation for high-tech excellence
and make the nation even less dependent on others for energy. Then came
a series of blown deadlines as the project hit technical snags and
struggled with a Sisyphean list of government-mandated safety upgrades.
Seventeen prime ministers came and went, the Japanese economy slipped
into a funk and the initial \$6.8 billion budget ballooned into \$27
billion of spending. [Now]{.underline}, Japan Nuclear Fuel Ltd.,
[the]{.underline} private [consortium]{.underline} building the
recycling plant, [says it really is almost done. But]{.underline} there
is a problem: [Japan does not use]{.underline} much
[nuclear]{.underline} [power]{.underline} any more. The country turned
away from nuclear energy after the 2011 Fukushima disaster, and only
nine of its 35 reactors are operational. It is a predicament with global
ramifications. [While waiting for the plant to be built, Japan has
amassed a stockpile of 47 metric tons of plutonium, raising concerns
about nuclear proliferation and Tokyo's commitment to refrain from
building nuclear arms]{.underline} even as it joins the United States in
pressing North Korea to give up its arsenal. I[n August, North
Korea']{.underline}s state-run Rodong Sinmun newspaper [accused Japan of
accumulating plutonium "for its nuclear armament." While waiting for the
plant]{.underline} in Rokkasho to be finished, [Japan has amassed a
stockpile of 47 metric tons of plutonium]{.underline}.CreditKo Sasaki
for The New York Times [Japan pledged]{.underline} for the first time
this past summer [to reduce the stockpile]{.underline}, saying the
recycling plant would convert the plutonium into fuel for use in
Japanese reactors. [But if the plant opens as scheduled]{.underline} in
four years, t[he nation's hoard of plutonium could grow]{.underline}
rather than shrink. That is because [only four of Japan's working
reactors are technically capable of using the new fuel]{.underline}, and
at least a dozen more would need to be upgraded and operating to consume
the plutonium that the recycling plant would extract each year from
nuclear waste. "At the end of the day, Japan is really in a vise of its
own making," said James M. Acton, a researcher at the Carnegie Endowment
for International Peace in Washington. "There is no easy way forward,
and all those ways forward have significant costs associated with it." A
handful of countries reprocess nuclear fuel, including France, India,
Russia and Britain. But the Japanese plan faces a daunting set of
practical and political challenges, and if it does not work, the nation
will be left with another problem: about 18,000 metric tons of nuclear
waste in the form of spent fuel rods that it has accumulated and stored
all these years. [Japan's neighbors]{.underline}, [most notably China,
have long objected to the stockpile of plutonium]{.underline}, which was
extracted from the waste during tests of the recycling plant and at a
government research facility, as well as by commercial recycling plants
abroad. Most of this plutonium is now stored overseas, in France and
Britain, but [10 metric tons remain in Japan]{.underline}, more than a
third of it in Rokkasho, the northeastern fishing town where the
recycling plant is being built. Engineers have repeatedly revised the
design of the Rokkasho plant to address water leaks and earthquake
safety, and it took years to develop a safe way to dispose of hazardous
byproducts.CreditKo Sasaki for The New York Times Japan says it stores
its plutonium in a form that would be difficult to convert into weapons,
and that it takes measures to ensure it never falls into the wrong
hands. But [experts are worried the sheer size of the stockpile --- the
largest of any country without nuclear weapons, and in theory enough to
make 6,000 bombs --- could be used to justify a nuclear buildup by North
Korea and others in the region.]{.underline} Any recycling plan that
adds to [the stockpile looks like "a route to weaponize down the
road]{.underline}," said Alicia Dressman, a nuclear policy specialist.
"[This is what really concerns Japan's neighbors and
allies."]{.underline} Japan maintains that its plutonium is for peaceful
energy purposes and that it will produce only as much as it needs for
its reactors. "We are committed to nonproliferation," said Hideo
Kawabuchi, an official at the Japan Atomic Energy Commission. But [the
launch of the]{.underline} Rokkasho [plant has been delayed so
long]{.underline} --- and popular opposition to restarting additional
nuclear reactors remains so strong --- [that skepticism abounds over the
plan to recycle the stockpile]{.underline}. Critics say Japan should
concede the plant will not solve the problem and start looking for a
place to bury its nuclear waste.

Many **[experts]{.underline}** [believe that Japan]{.underline} [could
produce **nuclear weapons within 6 months**]{.underline} of deciding to
do so, and some believe that Tokyo is pursuing a "nuclear hedging"
strategy. Japan has done little to mollify these concerns. In fact, it
has often encouraged them, with a Japanese official recently saying off
the record that ["Japan already has the technical capability \[to build

China and South Korea have voiced concern about [Japan's intention to
upgrade its military capabilities]{.underline}, largely grounded in
suspicions that Japan will inch toward returning to its pre-1945
militarism. Some analysts caution that selling the F-22s to Japan [could
destabilize the region]{.underline}, possibly even [sparking an arms
race, and]{.underline} contribute to an image of Japan becoming
America's proxy in the region. The sale could **[complicate the U.S.
effort to manage its relationship with China]{.underline}**. South Korea
has already registered its unease at Japan acquiring F-22s, and at one
point suggested that it may seek a deal to purchase the aircraft in
order to match Japan's capabilities.10 Although the Lee Myung-bak
government has made moves to strengthen U.S.-South Korean alliance, the
Seoul-Washington relationship has been strained at times over the past
several years, and some South Koreans chafe at indications that the
United States prioritizes defense ties with Japan above those with
Korea.

### 2NC Democracy Add-On

#### US commitment to Taiwan key to global democracy 

**Shelley 11** \-\-- PhD in Government, Harvard (Brown Professor of East
Asian Politics at Davidson College in North Carolina, leading authority
on Taiwan who has been studying and visiting Taiwan for nearly three
decades, visiting researcher at Chengchi University in Taipei and a
visiting professor at Fudan University in Shanghai, "Why giving up
Taiwan will not help us with China," 11-29,
<http://www.aei.org/publication/why-giving-up-taiwan-will-not-help-us-with-china/>)

Beyond these strategic arguments, moral reasons exist for why the United
States should not be hasty in ending its security assistance to Taiwan.
One is that [Washington and Taipei share decades of]{.underline}
friendship, [cooperation, common purpose]{.underline}, and shared
sacrifice. US officials tend to trust democratic Taiwan more than the
authoritarian PRC. The United States made itself responsible for Taiwan
when it required Taipei to restrain its own ambitions in exchange for
American support. And as McVadon observed, affinity with Taiwan comes
naturally to Americans of a certain age: "Americans of my generation
feel close to Taiwan, have affection for its people, and cannot bring
themselves to succumb to the reasoning that we would be better off by
abandoning support for Taiwan. Taiwan is like a blood brother; it need
not do any more to warrant loyalty. The PRC is, in contrast, a stranger.
Its qualities run hot and cold. Its origin and upbringing create
uncertainties; trust has to be developed. And these feelings, in both
cases, are reciprocal. . . . It is easy to feel close to Taiwan."
Fidelity to American values also matters to Taiwan policy because [US
treatment of Taiwan stands as a **critical test** of America's
commitment to its core foreign policy values: democracy, freedom, and
market economics. Taiwan's democratic transition signals success for
America's efforts to encourage democratization around the world without
outside intervention or bloodshed. "Taiwan has grown into a society that
represents most of our important values that we try to promote elsewhere
in the world,"]{.underline} says an American diplomat with experience in
Taiwan and China. "Look at all we've done to promote these values in
Iraq and Afghanistan. Taiwan achieved everything we want, all on its
own." "[It sounds syrupy]{.underline}," says another former US official,
"[but Taiwan can offer hope to other countries. The fact that it can
stay vibrant in spite of all its limitations is inspiring]{.underline}."
[If societies aspiring to install or consolidate democratic political
systems look to Taiwan for inspiration, they look to the
U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates [and its allies for signs that
they will support young democracies]{.underline}. Nancy Bernkopf Tucker,
the leading historian of US-Taiwan relations, pointed out that "the US
bears some responsibility for Taiwan's democracy, not least because it
made those changes with encouragement and pressure from us." The
diplomat quoted above concurs: "[If we are seen as reducing our
commitment to Taiwan, **it will have an impact on our position around
the world**. It would seem we don't believe in our own
values]{.underline}. [Taiwan]{.underline} is a means to an end for the
US, at least in the sense that it [helps us maintain our values and
credibility around the world. Our presidents describe Taiwan as a
**beacon of democracy**]{.underline} in their congratulatory statements,
but when we get down to business, that conviction is not carried out
with the gusto it deserves." Critics of Glaser's Foreign Affairs article
stressed this argument, prompting him to reply: "Although my article
focused on U.S. national security interests, it is true that [the
U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates [has a significant interest in
supporting freedom and democracy around the world, including in Taiwan.
These interests offer the strongest argument for Washington to maintain
its current commitment to Taipei]{.underline}. But the United States
should pursue these other interests \[support for freedom and
democracy\] only if they do not pose a serious national security
risk."\[9\] Perhaps Glaser is right that the United States cannot afford
to sacrifice other interests to protect Taiwan's democracy. But would a
retreat from the security relationship really serve the interests Glaser
sees as more important?

[As one of the countless millions of people who were freed or protected
from totalitarianism by the U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates of
America, [it is easy for me to talk about the past]{.underline}. To talk
about the belief of the American people and their leaders that this
country was exceptional, and had special responsibilities to match its
tremendous power. That a nation founded on freedom was bound to defend
freedom everywhere. I could talk about the bipartisan legacy of this
most American principle, from the Founding Fathers, to Democrats like
Harry Truman, to Republicans like Ronald Reagan. [I could talk about how
the American people used to care deeply about human rights and
dissidents in far-off places, and how this is what made America a beacon
of hope, a shining city on a hill. America led by example and set a high
standard, a standard that exposed the hypocrisy and cruelty of
dictatorships around the world]{.underline}. But there is no time for
nostalgia. [Since the fall of the Berlin Wall, the collapse of the
Soviet Union, and the end of the Cold War, Americans]{.underline}, and
America, [have retreated from those principles]{.underline}, [and the
world has become much worse off as a result]{.underline}. American
skepticism about America's role in the world deepened in the long,
painful wars in Afghanistan and Iraq, and their aftermaths. Instead of
applying the lessons learned about how to do better, lessons about
faulty intelligence and working with native populations, the main
outcome was to stop trying. [This result has been a tragedy for the
billions of people still living under authoritarian regimes around the
world, and it is based on faulty analysis. You can never guarantee a
positive outcome]{.underline}--- not in chess, not in war, and certainly
not in politics. [The best you can do is to do what you know is right
and to try your best]{.underline}. I speak from experience when I say
that [the citizens of unfree states do not expect guarantees. They want
a reason to hope and a fighting chance. People living under
dictatorships want the opportunity for freedom, the opportunity to live
in peace and to follow their dreams. From the Iraq War to the Arab
Spring to the current battles for liberty from Venezuela to Eastern
Ukraine, people are fighting for that opportunity, giving up their lives
for freedom. The U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates [must not
abandon them]{.underline}. [The U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates
[and the rest of the free world has an unprecedented advantage in
economic and military strength]{.underline} today. [What is lacking is
the will]{.underline}. The will [to make the case to the American
people, the will to take risks and invest in the long-term security of
the country, and the world. This will require investments in aid, in
education, in security that allow countries to attain the stability
their people so badly need. Such investment is far more moral and far
cheaper than the cycle of **terror**, **war**, **refugees**, and
**military intervention** that results when America leaves a vacuum of
power. The best way to help refugees is to prevent them from becoming
refugees in the first place]{.underline}. [The Soviet Union was an
existential threat]{.underline}, and this focused the attention of the
world, and the American people. [The]{.underline}re [**existential
threat** today is not found on a map, but **it is very real**. The
forces of the past are making steady progress against the modern world
order. **Terrorist movements in the Middle East**, **extremist parties
across Europe**, a **paranoid tyrant in North Korea threatening nuclear
blackmail**, and]{.underline}, at the center of the web, [**an
aggressive KGB dictator in Russia**. They all want to turn the world
back to a dark past because their survival is threatened by the values
of the free world, epitomized by the U]{.underline}nited
[S]{.underline}tates. [And they are thriving as the U.S. has retreated.
The global freedom index has declined for ten consecutive years. No one
like to talk about the U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates [as a
global policeman, but **this is what happens when there is no cop on the
beat**. American leadership **begins at home**]{.underline}, right here.
[America cannot lead the world on democracy and human rights if there is
no unity on the meaning and importance of these things. Leadership is
required to make that case clearly and powerfully]{.underline}. Right
now, [Americans are engaged in politics at a level not seen in decades.
It is an opportunity for them to rediscover that making America great
begins with believing America can be great]{.underline}. [The Cold War
was won on American values that were shared by both parties and nearly
every American]{.underline}. Institutions that were created by a
Democrat, Truman, were triumphant forty years later thanks to the
courage of a Republican, Reagan. [This bipartisan consistency created
the decades of strategic stability that is the great strength of
democracies. Strong institutions that outlast politicians allow for
long-range planning. In contrast, dictators can operate only tactically,
not strategically, because they are not constrained by the balance of
powers, but cannot afford to think beyond their own survival. This is
why a dictator like Putin has an advantage in chaos, the ability to move
quickly. This can only be met by strategy, by long-term goals that are
based on shared values, not on polls and cable news]{.underline}. [The
fear of making things worse has paralyzed the U]{.underline}nited
[S]{.underline}tates [from trying to make things better. There will
always be setbacks, but the U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates
[cannot quit. The spread of democracy is **the only proven remedy for
nearly every crisis that plagues the world today**. **War**, **famine**,
**poverty**, **terrorism**--all are **generated and exacerbated** by
authoritarian regimes. A policy of America First inevitably puts
American security last]{.underline}. [American leadership is required
because **there is no one else**, and because it is good for America.
There is no weapon or wall that is more powerful for security than
America being **envied**, **imitated**, and **admired** around the
world. Admired **not for being perfect**, but for having the exceptional
courage to always **try to be better**]{.underline}. Thank you.

There is no doubt that the American people are tired of risk, war, and

freedom. [The United States played a pivotal role in building Taiwan's
democratic system, celebrating it as **a role model for
Asia**]{.underline} in general **[and China]{.underline}** in
particular. [China]{.underline} may be economically capitalist as much
as communist, but [politically]{.underline} it [remains a communist
autocracy]{.underline}. Its people are denied human rights, political
participation, and free expression. The contrast is stark, and [the need

clear,]{.underline} but this is not enough. [Talk of the United States

Risks of Appeasement over Taiwan At the same time, Barack Obama and his
[administration would incur serious costs should they seek to fix
U.S.---China relations by walking away from Taiwan.]{.underline} The
Taiwan Relations Act (TRA) of 1979 and Ronald Reagan's Six Assurances of
1982 created a framework for Washington---Taipei interaction after the
United States withdrew diplomatic recognition in 1979.6 Although neither
measure involved a legally binding expectation that Washington come to
Taiwan's rescue particularly if it requires the use of force they do
provide for the supply of defensive weapons and maintaining a U.S.
capability in the region to help Taiwan. They have prevented successive
administrations from pressuring Taiwan into cross-Strait negotiations or
undertaking mediation, lest Washington become responsible for
implementing agreements and managing the consequences of failure.
[Various U.S. interests support continuing arms sales to]{.underline},
and close economic relations with, [an autonomous Taiwan]{.underline}.
For instance, **[the U.S. defense industry profits from]{.underline}**,
and so encourages, **[Taiwan's weapons procurement]{.underline}**.
Diplomats, the Pentagon, scholars, and other analysts have argued that
[arms sales help Taiwan defend itself, strengthen morale among Taiwan's
population, deter Beijing, insure Taipei has the confidence to negotiate
with China,]{.underline} and that if talks go wrong Taiwan could fight
until U.S. forces arrived. [Weapons manufacturers also focus on the
money and the jobs to be had for Americans]{.underline}. F[-16 fighter
aircraft illustrate the **critical significance** of defense contractors
in sustaining the Taiwan relationship]{.underline}. George H. W. Bush,
ignoring commitments to Beijing as well as objections from within his
administration, decided to sell 150 fighters to Taipei during the 1992
presidential election campaign, hoping to insure re-election by
providing a \$4 billion contract and 5,800 jobs to General Dynamics'
operations in Texas.7 In 2011, a bipartisan group of 45 U.S. senators
advocating new F-16 sales and upgrades of existing aircraft not only
warned President Obama that Taiwan would be forced to ground some 70
percent of its fighters by 2020 without U.S. action, but that Lockheed
Martin's F-16 production line would shut down without orders for Taiwan.
Industry analysts estimate this would mean the loss of some 11,000 jobs
in 43 states.8 Another side to U.S. abandonment of Taiwan is the
trajectory of events that would follow such a momentous alteration of
U.S. policy. Would it help or hurt U.S. interests that Taiwan, almost
certainly, would not be able to sustain its de facto independence, and
would be compelled, in some form, to accommodate China's unification
agenda? That alone could be profoundly disturbing to American liberals
as well as conservatives for whom Taiwan's vibrant democracy has
appeared to be a vanguard for political development in Asia. China has
promised it would not station forces on Taiwan, use the island to
project power into the Pacific, interfere with critical commercial and
military sea lanes, or control Taiwan's affairs apart from foreign and
military relations. It has pledged to facilitate Taiwan's presence in
international organizations and be generous in multiplying and deepening
economic ties. But as the application of China's ''one country, two
systems'' formula in Hong Kong has demonstrated, 26 nurturing democratic
institutions under a communist umbrella is all but impossible. So if
China were to be perceived as coercive, unreasonable, or unjust,
Taiwan's fate would undermine U.S.---China relations, nullifying the
original purpose of abandonment.

## CP -- China QPQ 

### 1NC China QPQ 

#### Plan: The United States federal government should not substantially reduce its security commitment to Taiwan, including the Direct Commercial Sales and Foreign Military Sales of arms from the United States to Taiwan, unless the People's Republic of China agrees to binding resolution of maritime disputes and acceptance of the United States' long-term security role in East Asia. 

#### China says yes, but leverage is key -- solves territorial disputes, US hegemony, and avoids the alliance DA 

**Glaser 15** (Charles, professor in the Elliott School of International
Affairs and the Department of Political Science at George Washington
University, "A U.S.-China Grand Bargain?," International Security, Vol.
39, No. 4, pp. 49--90)

Therefore, the question arises whether policies exist that would reduce
the risks while preserving the benefits of U.S. accommodation on Taiwan.
If combining certain concessions by China in an overall package---a
grand bargain, for lack of a better term---could achieve this goal, then
[the U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates' [**best option** might be
to make ending its commitment to Taiwan **contingent** on China **making
concessions of its own**]{.underline}. The preceding analysis suggests
that [the U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates [should design such a
grand bargain]{.underline} with a variety of purposes in mind: [to gain
info]{.underline}rmation [about the nature and extent of China's
motives; to demonstrate its resolve to retain U.S. security commitments
in the region; and,]{.underline} related, [to preserve the credibility
of its commitments to its allies]{.underline}. Likely the most common
way to envision a grand bargain is as an agreement in which two actors
make concessions across multiple issue to create a fair deal---that is,
one in which both benefit equally---that would have been impossible in
an agreement that dealt with a single issue. A different way to envision
a grand bargain is as an agreement in which the states trade across
multiple issues, making both states better off, but not necessarily
equally. A grand bargain in Northeast Asia is likely to take the latter
form, partly because the agreement would be in response to a power shift
that favors China and partly because China's interests in the region are
greater than those of the United States. [The first component of a grand
bargain]{.underline}, and probably the most important, [would be for
China to resolve its maritime disputes on "fair" terms.]{.underline}100
Oddly, there seems to be both a little and a lot at stake in these
disputes. Gaining sovereignty over the offshore islands would strengthen
China's claims to the oil and gas reserves, which have increased the
importance of the disputes. At the same time, however, the disputes have
severely hindered the exploration and extraction of these resources, and
joint extraction and sharing agreements could provide all parties with
substantial resource benefits. Growing nationalism has given the
disputed territorial claims importance far beyond their material and
strategic value, and it has damaged the prospects for any type of
agreement. [An ideal solution would be for China and its neighbors to
place the territories under some sort of international control as a
maritime preserve and to share the resources]{.underline}.101 [Other
solutions include joint governance over the use of the islands/islets,
agreement not to object to other states' sovereignty claims, and
agreement to end unilateral military patrols near the disputed
territories.]{.underline}102 [China's willingness to reach an agreement
on the offshore islands and related maritime disputes would provide the
U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates [with valuable
info]{.underline}rmation. Most obviously, [it would demonstrate that
China's aims are limited]{.underline} (at least for now). Closely
related, [it would demonstrate a degree of reasonableness in Chinese
foreign policy priorities and decisionmaking: given that the value of
Taiwan dwarfs the value of these maritime disputes, Chinese
unwillingness to reach this type of bargain would indicate deep
inflexibility in its emerging foreign policy and possibly overconfidence
in its ability to use its growing power to achieve all of its
aims.]{.underline} [China's claims in these disputes are also weaker
than its claims to Taiwan]{.underline}: for example, China did not claim
the Senkaku/Diaoyu Islands until 1970, which suggests that it should be
able to moderate this claim if the benefits were sufficiently large. In
addition, an agreement would provide the United States with insights
into the balance of power within China's foreign policy decisionmaking.
[If China's more assertive policies have rejected the growing influence
of the People's Liberation Army, narrow nationalist pressures, or both,
then Chinese concessions would demonstrate that the country's leaders
could control these forces when the stakes are sufficiently
large]{.underline}. Taken as a whole, [this info]{.underline}rmation
[about China's goals would make U.S. accommodation over Taiwan less
risky. Insisting on Chinese concessions would]{.underline} also
[**demonstrate U.S. resolve** to protect American
interests]{.underline}. [By making its willingness to end its commitment
to Taiwan contingent on Chinese concessions, the United States would
make clear that it is willing to run the risk of protecting Taiwan and
its allies' interests in the South China and East China Seas, if China
were uncompromising]{.underline}. Once again, the key issue from the
U.S. perspective comes back to information---if China is more likely to
have unlimited aims, then the risks of U.S. accommodation are larger and
the United States should therefore be less willing to adopt this
strategy. As argued above, [China's refusal to accept a grand
bargain,]{.underline} especially one that is so clearly weighted toward
its interests (unless China is determined to push the United States out
of Northeast Asia), [would indicate more ambitious Chinese
aims]{.underline}. Thus, **[compared to unilateral
concessions]{.underline}**, [insisting on a package deal that included
Chinese concessions would demonstrate **a higher level of U.S.
resolve**]{.underline}. In addition, [resolution of the maritime
disputes would directly increase U.S. security by eliminating disputes
that, via alliance commitments, could draw the United States into
dangerous crises with China. A second component of a grand bargain would
be official Chinese acceptance of the the U]{.underline}nited
[S]{.underline}tates[' long-term security role in East Asia, including
its alliances and forward-deployed forces]{.underline}. There have been
periods when China viewed the U.S.-Japan alliance relatively favorable.
For example, in 1980 China's leader, Hua Guofeng, stated: "We appreciate
Japan's efforts to strengthen its alliance with the United States."103
Since then a variety of factors, including the decline of Soviet power
and the redefinition of the U.S.-Japan alliance starting in the
mid-1990s have reduced, if not eliminated, China's positive
assessment.104 In recent years, some Chinese elites have begun
expressing harshly negative views. For example, in 2014 the deputy chief
of the general staff of the People's Liberation Army described the U.S.
alliance system as "an antiquated relic of the Cold War that should be
replaced by an Asia-centric security architecture."105 Although open to
varying interpretations, President Xi Jinping's call for an Asian
security order managed by Asian countries and his criticism of
"alliances as unhelpful for the region's security" can be viewed as
offering a vision of the future in which the United States no longer
plays a security role in East Asia. Increasingly, there is support in
China for the conclusion that "in Beijing's eyes, the U.S. led security
architecture is outliving the usefulness it once provided by ensuring
the regional stability necessary for China's development. Instead, China
views the alliance system as increasingly incapable of providing lasting
security and itself a potential source of threat."106 [Especially in
light of Beijing's increasingly negative assessment, official
recognition and acceptance of the United States' continuing alliance
commitments would be a valuable signal]{.underline} (not cheap talk). It
[would indicate the dominance of certain domestic forces over others and
the Chinese leadership's willingness to accept domestic political costs
to advance China's foreign policy]{.underline}. Such action would not
guarantee stability in China's policy, but it would provide greater
confidence that China was willing to accept a revised geopolitical
status quo. Maybe more important, if China were unwilling (or unable) to
provide this official acceptance, the United States would have to be
more worried that China's leaders believe that its role in East Asia
requires pushing the United States out of the region.

#### Failure to resolves SCS territorial disputes ensures nuclear war 

**Rando 15** (Consultant- Asymmetric Global Solutions DBA,

Nuclear Confrontation, 9/29,
http://www.cbrneportal.com/fire-on-the-water-the-south-china-sea-and-nuclear-confrontation/)

Robert Kaplan, one of the world's foremost experts on China, has stated
"[The **S**outh **C**hina **S**ea will be the 21st Century's
**defining** **battleground**]{.underline}." The obsession with
supremacy in the South China Sea is certainly not a new phenomenon in
the realms of international security and maritime strategy. In
opinionated discussions related to naval warfare, prominent political
scientists and military strategists have been addressing the
geopolitical and military significance of the region for decades. For
example, the enlightening 1997 article "The Chinese Way", written in the
Bulletin of Atomic Scientists by Professor Chalmers Johnson of the
University of California-San Diego, noted significantly increased
defense budgets and expenditures in the region. In addition, the article
eludes to the fact that China had claimed the entire South China Sea and
would use its naval forces to counter any encroachment. The argument for
an increased U.S. naval presence in East Asia is certainly not without
precedent. [This contested aquatic region has tremendous geopolitical,
strategic and economic significance]{.underline}. While, the Persian
Gulf has immense importance and global recognition due to its strategic
location in the Middle East, as well its significance to global
commerce, industry and sought after oil, [the South China Sea is
crucially important to nations seeking to obtain their economic riches
and geopolitical advantages]{.underline}. The South China Sea is
geographically located near the Pacific Ocean and encompasses an area of
1.4 million square miles (3.5 million square kilometers). As a
semi-closed area, the South China Sea extends from the Singapore Strait
to the Taiwan Strait, with China, Indonesia, Malaysia, Brunei, the
Philippines, Vietnam, and Taiwan surrounding it. [In terms of economic
value, fishery stocks and potential fossil fuel reserves are two major
commodities that may spark **a**n armed conflict, even to the point of
**nuclear confrontation**.]{.underline} As a rich source of the region's
staple diet, fish, the sea guarantees a steady flow of food to the
countries of the region. Control and supremacy of the sea would also
assure claiming the much touted hydrocarbon reserves in the seabed,
possibly exceeding those of the OPEC nations such as Iraq and Kuwait.
The conquest of this vast resource would virtually assure energy
independence and high monetary returns for those that would gain
supremacy over the South China Sea. Thus, seizing the opportunity to
gain dominance will lead to control and manipulation of vital food and
energy resources, economic wealth and geopolitical power in the region.
[A scenario of regional and maritime domination and control could lead
to the partial or total exclusion of adjacent nation-states to access
any food or natural resources]{.underline} derived from a sea ruled with
an iron hand; [leading to a massive complex humanitarian catastrophe of
immense proportions from malnutrition and starvation, limitations in
energy production, and economic collapse.]{.underline} These factors
make the South China Sea a national security priority for nations in the
region, including one of the world's superpowers, China. The dependence
of China and other regional nations surrounding the South China Sea on
the Strait of Malacca is analogous in geopolitical and economic terms,
to the Strait of Hormuz in the Persian Gulf. Approximately one -third of
all global trade funnels through the strait and also serves as a conduit
for raw materials and energy needs for China and other adjacent
nation-states. [Such potential dominance in any region, leads to a
high-stakes game of **brinkmanship**, and at least the possibility of
**a regional war** which could conceivably escalate to engulf
nation-states **external** to the **region**]{.underline}al [sphere.
Tensions and skirmishes have the propensity to evolve into armed
conflict and **full-scale war**]{.underline}, and apprehensive leaders
and military planners in such a contested region serve as the
facilitators for disaster. China continues to assert sovereignty by
constructing man made islands using sand dredged from the sea bottom and
these artificial islands could be militarized. China has even affirmed
its desire to have a military presence on these islands; however, the
Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi, also professes the use of these land
masses to facilitate commerce via shipping lanes and to protect Chinese
fishing and other vessels from piracy. China will never cease its quest
for supremacy and its perceived "ownership" of the South China Sea, as
the legitimacy and structure of the Chinese government is based on
nationalism and achievement of the "Chinese Dream". The Chinese regime
continues to vehemently assert their perceived "right" to the South
China Sea, and it forges ahead with plans and operations that could lead
to naval warfare and conflict escalation. The knowledge that China
possesses formidable naval capacity and capabilities, including
nuclear-capable ballistic missile submarines, is, indeed, disconcerting
at the very least. As we examine and evaluate the "submarine factor", it
is evident that China's submarines have no practical value in its
disputes with Vietnam and the Philippines. Essentially, nuclear
ballistic missile capable submarines serve as a deterrent against
thermonuclear war. Without doubt, the primary reason that China
possesses nuclear-capable submarines is to deter an American attack,
although India's nuclear weapons are also a consideration for Beijing.
Nuclear capable submarines are capable of deep dive capabilities and
shorter launch to target times. While China's submarine capabilities may
appear worrisome to some, sudden deployment from port in a geopolitical
crisis would serve as a critical indicator to the US and Western allies,
and its submarine fleet still remains somewhat noisy and detectable.
China has already demonstrated its aggression at sea in several
instances, such as the ramming and sinking of a Vietnamese fishing boat
in disputed waters claimed by both countries in the region and an
ominous presence and military mobilization exercises which have been
monitored by military and intelligence assets. A report by the National
Air and Space Intelligence Center, indicates that Chinese SSBNs are able
to target portions of the U.S. from strategic operational positions near
the Chinese coast. China's Global Times published an unprecedented
report that revealed a nuclear missile strike on the western U.S. with
JL-2 missiles could generate up to 12 million American fatalities. The
Obama administration and senior U.S. naval officials have not retorted
to China's claims of a potentially devastating nuclear threat, which
included graphics showing radiological plumes and collateral damage
induced by radiation. The possibilities of China's anti-satellite
strategies to disable communications and intelligence-gathering
capabilities must also be taken seriously. Most assuredly, [the
**S**outh **C**hina **S**]{.underline}ea [would serve as an obvious
arena for the projection of Chinese power, including]{.underline}
conventional and, potentially, [**nuclear scenarios**.]{.underline}
Rando2China's South Sea naval facilities have seen significant upgrading
and expansion, such as the facilities on Hainan, and the nuclear
submarine base at Longpo serves as the first nuclear submarine base in
the South China Sea. The base also includes a submarine tunnel that is
part of an underwater complex of nuclear facilities on Hainan. Also,
[Chinese-Russian wargames]{.underline} are worrisome, which [adds to the
concerns of nuclear confrontation and consequences
globally]{.underline}. [The Chinese have asserted their right to defend
its territories]{.underline}, which in their view, includes the South
China Sea, and they have stated verbally, and by their aggressive
actions, that they will continue to pursue their strategic goals despite
the threat of confrontation and conflict. Many of the issues in
contention in the South China Sea will remain unresolved for, probably,
several years to come. We must remain balanced, and not overzealous in
our approaches to assisting with conflict resolution in the area. We
must apply reasonable diplomacy, without stirring up a hornet's nest
that would serve to be counterproductive and enhance animosities.
However, [the US]{.underline}, its allies, and other concerned
nation-states [must not refrain from being ever so vigilant and
proactive in achieving peaceful resolution, while at the same time
**maintain**ing our national defense and **security
postures**]{.underline}.

### 2NC AT: Say No

pp. 178--191)

Nevertheless, [the grand bargain would provide China with a major
achievement at]{.underline} arguably [little cost. Current Chinese
nationalist claims have blown the importance of]{.underline} the
maritime and sovereignty [disputes in the S]{.underline}outh China [and
E]{.underline}ast [C]{.underline}hina [S]{.underline}eas [far out of
proportion to their material value]{.underline}. [If China's
leaders]{.underline} decide to [prioritize other goals, they might be
able to deflate these nationalist claims, bringing them back in line
with their actual value and selling this new interpretation
domestically]{.underline}. At the same time, [Chinese leaders should
see]{.underline} that the [grand bargain would provide large benefits to
China, including elimination of the U]{.underline}nited
[S]{.underline}tates [as a barrier to bringing Taiwan under its full
sovereign control and]{.underline}, closely related, [a large reduction
in the security threat posed by the U]{.underline}nited
[S]{.underline}tates. [The grand bargain]{.underline}, therefore, [could
be appealing to a Chinese leadership that faces daunting domestic
challenges and intensifying regional opposition]{.underline} to its
assertive policies and growing military might. Thus, while the
probability of China accepting the grand bargain may be low, one should
not entirely discount the possibility.

\"**[should]{.underline}**\"[13](http://www.oscn.net/applications/oscn/DeliverDocument.asp?CiteID=20287#marker3fn13)

The answer to this query is not to be divined from rules of
grammar;[15](http://www.oscn.net/applications/oscn/DeliverDocument.asp?CiteID=20287#marker3fn15)
it must be governed by the age-old practice culture of legal
professionals and its immemorial language usage. To determine if the
omission (from the critical May 18 entry) of the turgid phrase, \"and
the same hereby is\", (1) makes it an in futuro ruling - i.e., an
expression of what the judge will or would do at a later stage - or (2)
constitutes an in in praesenti resolution of a disputed law issue, the
trial judge\'s intent must be garnered from the four corners of the
entire
record.[16](http://www.oscn.net/applications/oscn/DeliverDocument.asp?CiteID=20287#marker3fn16)
¶5 Nisi prius orders should be so construed as to give effect to every

People v. Munoz, 240 P.3d 311 (Colo. Ct. App. 2009)

"[Should]{.underline}" is "used . . . to express duty, obligation,
propriety, or expediency." Webster's Third New International Dictionary
2104 (2002). Courts interpreting the word in various contexts have drawn
conflicting conclusions, although the weight of authority appears to
favor interpreting "should" in an imperative, obligatory sense. A number
of courts, confronted with the question of whether using the word
"should" in jury instructions conforms with the Fifth and Sixth
Amendment protections governing the reasonable doubt standard, have
upheld instructions using the word. In the courts of other states in
which a defendant has argued that the word "should" in the reasonable
doubt instruction does not sufficiently inform the jury that it is bound
to find the defendant not guilty if insufficient proof is submitted at
trial, the courts have squarely rejected the argument. They reasoned
that the word "conveys a sense of duty and obligation and could not be
misunderstood by a jury." See State v. McCloud, 891 P.2d 324, 335 (Kan.
1995); see also Tyson v. State, 457 S.E.2d 690, 691-92 (Ga. Ct. App.
1995) (finding argument that "should" is directional but not
instructional to be without merit); Commonwealth v. Hammond, 504 A.2d
940, 941-42 (Pa. Super. Ct. 1986). Notably, courts interpreting the word
"should" in other types of jury instructions have also found that the
word [conveys]{.underline} to the jury a sense of [**duty** or
**obligation**]{.underline} and **[not discretion]{.underline}**. In
Little v. State, 554 S.W.2d 312, 324 (Ark. 1977), the Arkansas Supreme
[Court interpreted]{.underline} the word "[should]{.underline}" in an
instruction on circumstantial evidence [as synonymous with]{.underline}
the word "**[must]{.underline}**" and rejected the defendant's argument
that the jury may have been misled by the court's use of the word in the
instruction. Similarly, the Missouri Supreme Court rejected a
defendant's argument that the court erred by not using the word "should"
in an instruction on witness credibility which used the word "must"
because the two words have the same meaning. State v. Rack, 318 S.W.2d
211, 215 (Mo. 1958). In applying a child support statute, the Arizona
Court of Appeals concluded that a legislature's or commission's use of
the word "should" is meant to convey duty or obligation. McNutt v.
McNutt, 49 P.3d 300, 306 (Ariz. Ct. App. 2002) (finding a statute
stating that child support expenditures "should" be allocated for the
purpose of parents' federal tax exemption to be mandatory).

In uncritically signing on to the "new type of great-power relations"
slogan at the Obama-Xi Sunnylands summit in June 2013, the Obama
administration fell into a trap. It has what is most likely its last
major chance to dig itself out when Obama visits Beijing next month for
a follow-up summit. And he should make use of the opportunity. Although
some U.S. officials dismiss rhetoric as insignificant and see this
particular formulation as innocuous, Beijing understands things very
differently. At best, [U.S. acceptance of]{.underline} the
"[new]{.underline} type of great-power [relations]{.underline}" concept
[offers ammunition for those in Beijing]{.underline} and beyond [who

Chinese formulation, [Washington must]{.underline} proactively shape the
narrative. It should explicitly articulate and champion its own positive
vision for U.S.-Chinese relations, which should [accord China
international status **conditionally**]{.underline} \-- [**in return**
for Beijing]{.underline} abiding by twenty-first-century international
norms, [behaving responsibly toward its neighbors]{.underline}, and
contributing positively to the very international order that has enabled
China's meteoric rise. THUCYDIDES TRAP The "new type of great-power
relations" concept is appealing to so many policymakers and scholars in
both countries because of a misplaced belief in the Thucydides Trap.
This is a dangerous misconception that the rise of a new power
inescapably leads to conflict with the established one. The Chinese side
has exploited this oversimplified narrative to great effect:
[Xi]{.underline} himself [has warned of]{.underline} such [confrontation
as "inevitable," and leading Chinese international relations scholars
claim that it is an "iron law of power transition]{.underline}." Hillary
Clinton, the former U.S. secretary of state, echoed the sentiment at the
2012 U.S.-China Strategic and Economic Dialogue when she said that the
United States and China's efforts to avoid a catastrophic war are
"historically unprecedented" and that both sides need to "write a new
answer to the age-old question of what happens when an established power
and a rising power meet." A year later, at the Sunnylands summit, Tom
Donilon, then the U.S. national security adviser, explained that efforts
to reformulate the U.S.-Chinese relationship are "rooted in the
observation ... that a rising power and an existing power are in some
manner destined for conflict." Such sentiments are puzzling, especially
coming from Americans. They deny human agency (and responsibility) for
past \-- and possibly future \-- disasters. And they reject progress.
Further, they are based on a selective reading of modern history, one
that overlooks the powerful ways in which the norms that great powers
have promoted through their own rhetoric and example have shaped the
choices of contemporaneous rising powers, for better or for worse. Most
problematic, [the narrative of needing a "new model" to avoid otherwise
inevitable conflict is]{.underline} a negative foundation, [a dangerous
platform on which to build the future of U.S.-Chinese
relations]{.underline}. To be sure, Clinton, Donilon, and their
successors might understand all this but are prepared to dismiss
rhetoric and focus instead on action. This is surely what U.S. Secretary
of State John Kerry had in mind at the 2014 U.S.-China Strategic and
Economic Dialogue when he noted that "a new model is not defined in
words. It is defined in actions." Even so, flirting with the
Chinese-proposed slogan for bilateral relations, as the administration
has done, while dismissing it in private is dangerous. Chinese leaders
take such formulations extremely seriously: the phrase "new type of
great-power relations" appears repeatedly in their speeches, and
permeates Chinese media and public discourse on U.S.-Chinese relations.
[Uncritical embrace creates an unsustainable situation wherein each side
mistakenly expects unrealistic things of the other]{.underline},
[worsening the consequences when those expectations are ultimately
dashed]{.underline}.

#### China pockets the concession -- the CP is a distinct policy option that leverages sales 

**Gomez 16** (Eric, policy analyst for defense and foreign policy
studies at the Cato Institute, Masters of Arts in International Affairs
from the Bush School of Government and Public Service at Texas A&M
University, "A Costly Commitment: Options for the Future of the
U.S.-Taiwan Defense Relationship," 9-28,
<https://www.cato.org/publications/policy-analysis/costly-commitment-options-future-us-taiwan-defense-relationship>)

The United States should step down from the implicit commitment to use
military force to preserve Taiwan's de facto independence. American
credibility is slowly eroding as China becomes more powerful, and the
commitment will be more costly to maintain for a relatively minor
benefit. Broadly speaking, [the U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates
[has **two options** for how it could implement this policy option: it
could try to **draw concessions from China** to **get something in
return** for stepping down from the commitment, or it could
**unilaterally** drop the commitment]{.underline}. In either scenario,
Taiwan would have to take on sole responsibility for deterring Chinese
military action. [A policy that **wins concessions** from China would
be]{.underline} the **[more desirable]{.underline}** of the two options.
[Concessions could include resolution of other territorial disputes
involving China and American allies or dropping the Chinese threat to
use force against Taiwan]{.underline}. [This would be]{.underline}
characteristic of what Charles Glaser calls [a grand bargain, "an
agreement in which two actors make concessions across multiple issues to
create a fair deal ... that would have been impossible in an agreement
that dealt with a single issue."]{.underline}95 [Making the end of the
U.S. commitment to Taiwan contingent upon Chinese concessions to resolve
its other territorial disputes peacefully would benefit both the
U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates [and China.]{.underline}96 [The
U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates [would free itself of
a]{.underline}n increasingly [costly and risky commitment to Taiwan's
defense, **but only if China compromises** in ways that align with U.S.
allies' interests in the South and East China Seas]{.underline}.
[China]{.underline} would have to limit its objectives in the South and
East China Seas, but in return [would earn a major policy concession
from the U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates [on a **core national
interest** that has **much more importance** than the other territorial
disputes.]{.underline}

#### \--its consideration of any effort to determine the future of Taiwan by other than peaceful means a threat to peace and security 

#### \--its commitment to the availability of Taiwan's self-defense capability through defense articles and services

**Mazza 18** \-\-- research fellow, foreign & defense policy, at the
American Enterprise Institute (Michael, "The Coming Crisis in the Taiwan
Strait," 6/28,
<https://www.the-american-interest.com/2018/06/28/the-coming-crisis-in-the-taiwan-strait/>)

[In recent years, the U.S. government has tended to tie itself in knots
over balancing ties with Taipei and Beijing. Perhaps the best known
example of this predilection concerns Taiwan's request, during the
latter Bush years and the Obama Administration, for new
F-16]{.underline} C/D [fighter aircraft]{.underline}. As Defense News
reported in 2011, "Taiwan's June 24 petition to submit a letter of
request for new F-16 fighter jets was blocked by the U.S. State
Department under orders from the U.S. National Security Council, sources
in Taipei and Washington said." In other words, the Obama Administration
denied Taiwan's request to submit a request for the aircraft, thus
evading having to make any formal decision on the sale. Problems have
continued into the Trump Administration, as evidenced by the website
flag removals described above. Presumably an initiative arising from the
bureaucracy to ensure compliance with the "one China" policy, the effort
was too clever by half, serving only to further isolate Taiwan and give
the appearance of distance in the Washington-Taipei bilateral
relationship. Ironically, [it is a relatively straightforward affair to
counter Taiwan's international isolation within the bounds of the "One
China" policy. First, the United States should drop self-imposed
limitations on bilateral engagement. American and Taiwanese military
officers and civilian officials at all levels should be permitted to
meet]{.underline}---in both the United States and Taiwan. [The
militaries should exercise together in bilateral and multilateral
settings. When it comes to arms sales, Washington should treat Taiwan as
it does countries with which it has diplomatic ties. Sales should occur
with regularity rather than in bundles, and they should not be held
hostage to the U.S.-China diplomatic calendar]{.underline}. To its
credit, the Trump Administration has recently approved American
industrial participation in Taiwan's submarine program; it should next
convey a willingness to sell Taiwan the platforms it requires to ensure
a favorable air balance in the Strait. [For too long, Washington has
been hesitant to sell Taipei the defensive articles Taipei assesses it
needs most.]{.underline}

[It would be particularly valuable for the Trump Administration to
publicly affirm at a senior level that it is U.S. policy, as described
in the Taiwan Relations Act:]{.underline}

> [to consider any effort to determine the future of Taiwan by other
> than peaceful means]{.underline}, including by boycotts or embargoes,
> [a threat to the peace and security of the Western Pacific area and of
> grave concern to the United States;]{.underline}
>
> [to provide Taiwan with arms of a defensive character;
> and]{.underline}
>
> [to maintain the capacity of the United States to resist any resort to
> force or other forms of coercion that would jeopardize the security,
> or the social or economic system, of the people on
> Taiwan.]{.underline}

[The Administration should likewise affirm that it is committed to, per
the TRA, making "available to Taiwan such defense articles and defense
services in such quantity as may be necessary to enable Taiwan to
maintain a sufficient self-defense capability."]{.underline}

The U.S. Congress has done admirable work in this regard. The recently
passed Taiwan Travel Act, which the President signed into law, calls for
"visits between officials from the United States and Taiwan at all
levels." The 2018 National Defense Authorization Act included "sense of
Congress" language encouraging regular arms sales, inclusion of Taiwan
in military exercises, senior level exchanges, and naval port visits.
The NDAA also requires that, going forward, the Defense Secretary will
report to Congress on the status of Taiwan arms sales requests within
120 days of a request's submission.

The House and Senate have now passed their own versions of the 2019
NDAA. They did not, however, build on the advances of previous years.
The House version includes a well-intentioned but misguided provision
for a "comprehensive assessment of Taiwan's military forces," to be
conducted by the U.S. Secretary of Defense. Such an assessment risks
increasing tensions between the United States and Taiwan defense
establishments and making it more difficult for Taiwan to acquire the
defense articles it needs most. The House version does helpfully require
the Defense Secretary to brief Congress "on any plans . . . to carry out
senior-level defense engagement," but it does not mandate that
engagement. The Senate version likewise supports such engagement and
also encourages U.S. participation in Taiwan military exercises and vice
versa---like the House bill, however, nothing is mandated.

In the future, [Congress should consider mandating some of the actions
it has encouraged in "sense of Congress" language]{.underline},
especially regarding bilateral exchanges and bilateral exercises. In
future iterations of the NDAA, [Congress should]{.underline}, alongside
references to the Taiwan Relations Act and the Six Assurances, [include
as a statement of policy the secret presidential directive
that]{.underline} Ronald [Reagan issued in the wake of the third
communiqué. The memo should be restated in full:]{.underline}

> [The U.S. willingness to reduce its arms sales to Taiwan is
> conditioned absolutely upon the continued commitment of China to the
> peaceful solution of Taiwan-PRC differences]{.underline}. [It should
> be clearly understood that the linkages between these two matters is a
> permanent imperative of U.S. foreign policy]{.underline}. In addition,
> [it is essential that the quantity and quality of the arms provided
> Taiwan be conditioned entirely on the threat posed by the PRC. Both in
> quantitative and qualitative terms, Taiwan's defense capability
> relative to that of the PRC will be maintained.]{.underline}

[Such public affirmations of U.S. law and past policy statements will
reassure Taiwan (and its people) that the island does not stand alone,
and also ensure that American strategic ambiguity does not become **too
ambiguous**,]{.underline} [inadvertently **emboldening
Beijing**]{.underline}. Taiwan's first-ever mention in a National
Security Strategy was positive in this regard, with the NSS noting, "We
will maintain our strong ties with Taiwan in accordance with our 'one
China' policy, including our commitments under the Taiwan Relations Act
to provide for Taiwan's legitimate defense needs and deter coercion."
T[he Trump Administration]{.underline}, moreover, [should make clear
that if Beijing begins to rely predominantly on coercive tactics in the
Taiwan Strait, the White House will assess that to be a significant
change in the status quo]{.underline}, with potential implications for
the "One China" policy. For nearly four decades, the United States has
asserted that cross-Strait differences must be resolved peacefully and,
as President Bill Clinton noted nearly two decades ago, "with the assent
of the people of Taiwan." [If Beijing gives up on uncoerced
unification,]{.underline} as appears likely, [the "One China" policy
will no longer serve American interests. The Trump Administration should
begin considering alternatives now.]{.underline} To limit China's
economic leverage over Taiwan, Washington and Taipei should, despite
USTR's loaded agenda, prioritize a bilateral free-trade agreement. Doing
so would benefit both the American and Taiwanese economies, reduce
Taiwan's economic dependence on the mainland in relative terms, and
ensure that the island has the funds it needs to resource its defense
strategy. In the meantime, [the Administration should enhance efforts to
bolster Taiwan's quest for greater international space]{.underline}.
[Re-conceptualizing Taiwan]{.underline}'s exclusion from ICAO, INTERPOL,
and the WHO [as national security issues]{.underline} for the United
States [would send an **important signal abroad**]{.underline} and
encourage the State Department to act with greater urgency in support of
Taiwan's participation. In the event that Taiwan is excluded, [the
U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates [should embrace Taiwan's
positions as its own]{.underline} (where they do not conflict with
American interests) [and speak on its behalf during
assemblies.]{.underline} The Administration should also quietly
encourage partners like Japan, Australia, and India to deepen their own
engagement with Taiwan. Multilateral track 1.5 dialogues, like Taiwan's
Yushan Forum, provide an excellent opportunity for doing so. With Taipei
seeking discussions with partners on disaster relief, cyber issues, and
democracy promotion, as mentioned above, Washington should host quiet
trilateral meetings regarding cooperation in these and other relatively
unprovocative areas. Lastly, the United States must be sure its own
armed forces can deter and defeat Chinese aggression, as the TRA
requires. The NSS and the National Defense Strategy's focus on China's
challenge to U.S. interests, and last winter's congressional budget
deal, suggest that Washington is committed to doing so. A New Era [A new
era in cross-Strait relations is emerging. The two sides of the Strait
appear set to grow further apart even as Beijing grows more insistent on
unification in the coming years]{.underline}. That is not a recipe for
stability, let alone peace, in the Taiwan Strait. It [is incumbent upon
policymakers in Taipei and Washington to recognize this changing reality
and act accordingly. **To stave off an eventual crisis, both capitals
must work to ensure that Taiwan does not stand alone, that Taiwan's
people continue to believe in the feasibility of a free and (de facto)
independent future, and that the United States and Taiwan's armed forces
can deter and, if necessary, defeat Chinese aggression**]{.underline}.

<https://thehill.com/opinion/international/438775-save-the-taiwan-relations-act-but-scrap-ambiguity-defend-taiwan>)

[This past week marked the 40th anniversary of the Taiwan Relations
Act]{.underline} (TRA), the indignant congressional response to
President Jimmy Carter's switch of diplomatic relations from the
Republic of China on Taiwan to the People's Republic of China (PRC).
Carter simply put into place the scenario envisioned by President
Richard Nixon when he opened informal relations with the PRC. That
commenced the executive branch's initial abandonment of Taiwan in the
vain hope that Beijing would help the United States manage a graceful
exit from the Vietnam War. Nixon's national security adviser, Henry
Kissinger, negotiated with Premier Chou En-lai to produce the Shanghai
Communique --- the original sin of U.S.-PRC relations. In what Nixon
considered a masterpiece of ambiguity, it "acknowledged" the fact that
China claimed Taiwan and said "all Chinese" on both sides of the Taiwan
Strait (meaning the communist and anti-communist dictatorships) agreed.
[It did not state Washington's position on Taiwan's sovereignty as long
as it was resolved peacefully.]{.underline} But, while stating America's
precondition for a nonviolent resolution of Taiwan's status, [the
communique implicitly acknowledged that China reserved the right to take
Taiwan by force if it didn't go "peacefully."]{.underline} Indeed, when
Mao Zedong told Nixon and Kissinger that China could wait 100 years to
take Taiwan, Kissinger expressed surprise that it would take that long.
(Kissinger never wavered from that impatient expectation on Beijing's
behalf, publicly warning Taiwan in 2007 that "China will not wait
forever." Xi Jinping later came to power echoing Kissinger's adamant
approach over Mao's protracted timeline, saying the Taiwan question
cannot be passed "from one generation to another.") The TRA was intended
to correct that misalignment of U.S. policy. It provided that it is U.S.
policy "to provide Taiwan with arms of a defensive character and to
maintain the capacity of the United States to resist any resort to force
or other forms of coercion that would jeopardize the security, or the
social or economic system, of the people on Taiwan." It did not
unequivocally commit the United States to come to Taiwan's defense as
the now-scrapped Mutual Defense Treaty of 1954 had done after the Korean
War. Ever since, [Beijing has sought to undermine the TRA and make it
irrelevant to U.S.-China relations, while successive Congresses have
strived to reinforce and build upon it with further pro-Taiwan
legislation]{.underline}. Administrations of both parties have struggled
to uphold the peaceful purposes of the TRA while maintaining a balance
between reassuring/cautioning Taiwan and mollifying/warning China. The
pattern of presidential straddling is evident in a series of PRC
challenges since 1979. As soon as Ronald Reagan began his presidency in
1981, China started lobbying his administration to emasculate the TRA
provisions on arms sales to Taiwan. Somehow, Secretary of State
Alexander Haig maneuvered the pro-Taiwan president into agreeing to the
Third Communique, severely limiting future weapons transfers with the
stated aim of phasing them out entirely. After expressions of
congressional outrage, Reagan realized what he had done and immediately
accepted the Six Assurances requested by Taiwan: no revision of the TRA,
no change to Taiwan's sovereignty, no set date to end sales, no advance
U.S. consultation with China, no U.S. mediation role, and no U.S.
pressure for negotiations. A more kinetic PRC challenge to the TRA's
vaguely implied security commitments came in 1995 and 1996 when China
fired missiles toward Taiwan to protest President Lee Teng-hui's visit
to Cornell (after Congress pressured the State Department to reverse its
decision not to grant a visa), then during Taiwan's first direct
presidential election. President Bill Clinton first sent a U.S. carrier
through the Taiwan Strait, then half-apologized to China for the
"weather diversion." In the second incident, he dispatched two carriers
but kept them out of the Strait when Beijing threatened a "sea of fire."
In the brief interlude between those events, Chinese officials cut to
the chase and asked Joseph Nye, the defense department's chief Asia
official, how the United States would respond to a direct PRC attack on
Taiwan. Nye did not invoke the TRA, but said "it would depend on the
circumstances." [Beijing's take-away lessons from the statement and the
military confrontations: (a) Washington did not feel an iron-clad
commitment to Taiwan's security under the TRA, and (b) under the right
circumstances (from Beijing's perspective), America could be deterred
from intervening in Taiwan's defense]{.underline}. [For the next two
decades, China proceeded to build its attack sub]{.underline}marine
[fleet and anti-ship ballistic missile arsenal to create those
unpleasant circumstances, known as its anti-access/area denial strategy
\[A2/AD\]]{.underline}. [Touting Chinese confidence in its deterrent
effectiveness, a Chinese admiral recently threatened to]{.underline}
almost-[instantly kill 10,000 Americans by sinking a couple of U.S.
carriers]{.underline}. [In 2005, Beijing put a legal gloss on its
anti-TRA and anti-Taiwan campaign when it passed the Anti-Secession Law
proclaiming China's right and intention to attack Taiwan]{.underline},
even if it didn't declare independence but just took too long to submit
to "peaceful" unification. So, now [**Beijing has put all the pieces in
place for its contemplated seizure of Taiwan.** It is up to Washington
to invoke the TRA and tell China that attacking Taiwan certainly would
mean war with the United States]{.underline}. **[To be credible, the
warning has to be public]{.underline}**. [Chinese leaders have proved
themselves rational actors when they fully understand the consequences
of their actions, so **there would be no war**, even if Taiwan
politicians tried to take advantage of the U.S. security guarantee by
making moves toward formal independence.]{.underline} The China threat
toward Taiwan has to be confronted at some point. [Given the trade war
and other U.S. legal actions against malign Chinese actions, Washington
has greater leverage under this administration than it has experienced
in decades.]{.underline}

[[Taiwan's policy of maintaining the status quo with China]{.mark} won't
change despite a drubbing at local elections]{.underline} for the ruling
party, [Taiwan President Tsai]{.underline} Ing-wen [said]{.underline} on
Friday, adding democracy was the biggest difference with China. Meeting
a delegation from the U.S.-based National Committee on American Foreign
Policy, Tsai reiterated that her China policy would not change, and that
people were voting on local issues rather than on ties across the Taiwan
Strait. The pro-independence Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) suffered
a serious set-back at the Saturday polls, loosing key cities in mayoral
elections to the China-friendly Kuomintang, including the former DPP
stronghold of Kaohsiung in the south. China has heaped pressure on Tsai
since she took office in 2016, believing she wishes to push for the
island's formal independence, a red line for Beijing which claims
self-ruled Taiwan as its own. Meeting a delegation from the U.S.-based
National Committee on American Foreign Policy, [Tsai reiterated that her
China policy would not change, and that people were voting on local
issues rather than on ties across the Taiwan Strait]{.underline}. ["We
basically do not believe that in this local election people made a
choice on the cross-strait policy issue or made a major change," Tsai
said]{.underline}, in comments carried live on her Facebook page. "So
[**our policy on maintaining the status quo will remain unchanged**,"
she added.]{.underline} "While the DPP's performance left us
disappointed, democratic elections are our most cherished asset and our
greatest difference with China." [Beijing has barely contained its glee
at the election result, saying it showed Taiwan's people's desire for
better ties with China.]{.underline} Tsai said there were challenges in
the election, including fake news exacerbated by "outside forces" --- a
reference to China --- something she said any democracy faces. Tsai
faces re-election in a little over a year's time at Taiwan's next
presidential vote.

[Turning to relations with Beijing]{.underline}, support for immediate

[[Support for]{.mark} immediate [independence]{.mark}]{.underline} also

[agree that there is **no need for declaring

independent]{.underline}. Moreover, [almost 60 percent in both polls

2017. Following the DPP's victory in 2016, [the percentage of Taiwanese
who characterized cross-strait relations as hostil]{.underline}e

have stabilized]{.underline}. A majority agrees that relations are more
hostile than friendly, but the number remains steady at approximately 64

### 1NC Taiwan War -- No Solvency/Prolif Turn 

#### Arms sales preserve cross-strait peace -- the plan ensures Taiwan insecurity provoking conflict, prolif and collapse of diplomacy 

**Tucker & Glaser 11** (Nancy Bernkopf Tucker, Professor of History at
Georgetown University, PhD from Columbia, & \*Bonnie Glaser, Senior
Chair Fellow with the Freeman Chair in China Studies at CSIS, MA from
John Hopkins, "Should the United States Abandon Taiwan?," The Washington
Quarterly, Sept 14, <https://doi.org/10.1080/0163660X.2011.609128>)

The Obama administration should stop equivocating and move forward with
arms sales. There will never be a good time to sell weapons to Taiwan.
Diplomacy with China as well as congressional routines and requirements
invariably intervene what former deputy assistant secretary of state for
East Asian and Pacific affairs Randall Schriver has called ''the tyranny
of the calendar.'' Upgrading existing aircraft would be welcome, but
[Taiwan's aging and shrinking air force]{.underline} also [needs new
planes]{.underline}. Were the United States to wait and the F-16 C/D
production line to close, [Taiwan would have no other
source]{.underline}. Washington might well be faced with the complicated
dilemma of whether to sell even more advanced F-35s. Washington ought to
reassert its longstanding position to Beijing that [sales do not promote
Taiwan's separation from the mainland but]{.underline}, in the current
phase of cross-Strait relations, [**create an environment for improved
China---Taiwan relations**.]{.underline} Indeed, in the past two years,
the United States has sold almost \$13 billion in weapons to Taiwan, and
cross-Strait relations are in the best shape in decades. [In the absence
of U.S. backing, Taipei would]{.underline} likely [be too insecure and
Taiwan's leaders too vulnerable politically to negotiate with China.
Arms sales]{.underline}, therefore, [**facilitate** cross-Strait
compromise and should not be anathema to Beijing]{.underline}. The
United States should also accelerate dialogue with Taipei to promote
increased U.S.---Taiwan trade, reduce Taiwan's growing isolation from
regional and global trading blocks, and prevent yet more dependence on
China. Refusing to talk about a broad range of economic issues through
the only available dispute settlement mechanism, the Trade and
Investment Framework Agreement (TIFA), because of minor, if politically
thorny, problems like U.S. beef exports to Taiwan is a mistake. And
progress should be made on commonplace but important requests from
Taipei to join the U.S. visa waiver program and conclude a bilateral
extradition agreement. Higher-level contact between U.S. and Taiwan
officials ought to occur routinely. Even if presidential meetings are
not possible, dialogue between leaders should be facilitated by video
conferences and regular correspondence. Cabinet-level visits to Taiwan,
five of which occurred during the Clinton administration alone, could
quickly be resumed. The prolonged and ill-considered hiatus in those
visits during the George W. Bush and early Obama years is
self-defeating. Such trips are important symbolically, but they also
improve communication and raise awareness of common interests. Taiwan's
representatives also should be granted better access to U.S. officials
in Washington and not be barred from buildings such as the Department of
State. There is no formal agreement that requires such restrictions;
they are entirely self-imposed. Washington cannot sustain the
U.S.---Taiwan relationship unilaterally. Taipei has to assign priority
to strengthening ties with Washington, even as it improves relations
with Beijing. This will require tackling difficult domestic political
obstacles in Taiwan and should be a bipartisan endeavor. It will be
increasingly important to conduct relations in an environment of trust
and candor. There are risks to a strategy which strengthens rather than
abandons U.S. ties to Taiwan. If Washington continues to support Taiwan,
it must simultaneously find ways to convince Beijing that the United
States does not seek to prevent an accommodation between Taiwan and
China. The United States does not secretly promote independence or block
progress in cross-Strait relations. Rather, U.S. policy aims at
sustaining peaceful conditions in which Taiwan and China can reach a
long-term modus vivendi by themselves. Although the Six Assurances and
the Taiwan Relations Act attempted to keep the focus of U.S.---Taiwan
relations on the United States and Taiwan, China has always been a
critical variable and its importance is growing. But those who worry
that Taiwan policy will set back U.S.---China relations ought instead to
persuade China that, [in the absence of U.S. support, Taipei
would]{.underline} likely [**lose confidence** and put negotiations with
the mainland on hold. An abandoned and isolated Taiwan might, in
desperation, **declare independence** or even revive efforts to
**produce nuclear weapons**, not pursue unification]{.underline} as
Beijing assumes. So, in fact, [U.S. support is]{.underline} not harmful,
but [helpful to China's interests]{.underline}. The course of
cross-Strait relations does not lead inexorably in any one direction.
Taiwan's options remain open. [The United States wants Taiwan stable,
peaceful, and democratic]{.underline} for the people of Taiwan, [as a
model to others in East Asia, and as assurance of U.S. credibility and
dependability]{.underline}. The United States should not abandon its
principled dedication to freedom of choice, but should strengthen it.

#### Taiwan prolif causes regional arms racing and shooting war with China -- turns case

[Taiwan presents]{.underline} perhaps the least likely, but also [the
most provocative, case of nuclear weapons potential in the
region]{.underline}. In the 1970s and again in the 1980s, Taiwan
launched clandestine nuclear fuel reprocessing programs aimed at
providing it with its own nuclear deterrent against mainland China. Both
times, the United States forced Taiwan to abandon these programs.25
[Taiwan has stored spent nuclear fuel at three two-unit nuclear power
plants, which could be reprocessed into bomb-grade plutonium if Taiwan
built a facility to do so]{.underline}, as it attempted to do
clandestinely in the 1970s and 1980s. [Taiwan also possesses the
industrial and electronics expertise to assemble a deliverable nuclear
weapon. Taiwan is developing an indigenously produced long-range
land-attack cruise missile]{.underline} that in theory could be armed
with a nuclear warhead. The missile, named Cloud Peak, has a range of
1,200 and possibly 2,000 kilometers and will be mounted on mobile
transporters.26 [The leadership in Beijing would view a decision by
Taiwan to acquire nuclear weapons as **highly provocative** and quite
possibly a casus belli. Beijing would likely view such a development as
tantamount to a declaration of independence]{.underline}, something that
Beijing in the past has stated it would resist with force. Under current
circumstances, Taiwan appears to have no interest in this course. **[But
a withdrawal of the U.S. security presence would be a different
matter]{.underline}**, e[specially if it led to **nuclear and missile
races elsewhere in the region**. In that event a Taiwanese nuclear
program could go from being a highly remote case to perhaps **the most
likely path to war in the region**.]{.underline}

### \-\-- XT: Conflict UQ 

#### We control uniqueness for conflict and stability -- the status quo will prevail, but arms sales are key 

**Hutchins 18** (Reid Hutchins completed a Master of Strategic Studies
at the Australian National University and is currently a Ministerial
Liaison Officer at the ACT Government, "High Stakes Strategy in Taiwan,"

Is change on the cards? [As a new US administration seeks to reassure
China that its policies remain largely unchanged, the importance of
forging strong bilateral relations between the two great powers is
**paramount**]{.underline}. [Yet, it is still within US interests to
sell arms to Taiwan]{.underline}. The US is caught between honouring its
Taiwanese alliance and also quelling rising Chinese anxiety over its
territorial claims. As a way of countering China's own salami,
'divide-and conquer' tactics, the suggestion has been made that the US
could incrementally sell defensive arms to Taiwan over a period of time.
Continually delivering large arms packages has already spurred rapid
Chinese military modernisation over a number of years. A meeting of the
annual National People's Congress confirmed this anxiety, when it
announced a 7 per cent rise in the military budget. [While China, Taiwan
and the US have shifted their foreign policy to a varying extent,
**these shifts have not fundamentally altered the strategic interests of
each state vis-à-vis the other**]{.underline}. [There should never be
any certainty that trilateral relations will remain as they
are,]{.underline} especially given new reformist US and Taiwanese
administrations, [but each state has not yet demonstrated any signs of
changing their strategic objectives.]{.underline} What are the
motivations? China has taken great interest in the domestic politics of
Taiwan in recent years, as the island nation has gone through a
transitional government. Whilst there is always an element of the
unknown, President Tsai Ing-wen's Democratic Progressive Party (DPP)
will look to neutralise hostile territorial claims from China. Given
Taiwan's long record of arms deals with the US, China's President Xi
Jinping would likely have assumed that Trump's arms deal would go ahead.
[Xi will now continue a policy of incremental coercion in an effort to
influence Taiwan's political establishment and derail future arms sales
in the long term. Whilst China's primary goal is to politically unify
Taiwan with the mainland, Chinese policy-makers are
**pragmatic**]{.underline} and realistic [enough to know that the
feasibility of this goal can only be achieved in the long term. Taiwan
will continue to rely on US extended deterrence for its national
security. It will]{.underline} therefore [continue to pursue arms sales
agreements with the US and do whatever possible to preserve the
alliance]{.underline}. Based on previous condemnations, China's negative
response to the new deal was predictable. [**Tsai knew** that beyond
strong condemnation, **China will not escalate its rhetoric into a
significant hostile action**]{.underline}. Despite espousing
unpredictable foreign policy views, Trump was successfully convinced by
Tsai and his advisors to honour an important bilateral arms arrangement,
knowing a negative backlash for Sino-US relations would be inevitable.
As such, Trump will look to build trust and rapport with Xi---a greater
foreign policy priority than arms sales with Taiwan. [Tsai will look for
any opportunity to reaffirm the necessity of future US arms sales to
boost Taiwan's defensive military capability. Trump]{.underline} has
shown an adherence to the 'One China' policy in an effort to appease
China that it's business as usual. He [has so far **maintained the
status quo** regarding American commitments to Taiwan.]{.underline}
Senior military advisors will likely recommend that Trump maintain
bilateral military relations as a show of relevance and superiority in
the region. However, a US naval presence in Taiwan would be an undue
provocation to an already sensitive situation. To avoid alarming China
and disrupting Sino-US relations, the salami tactic of incremental arms
packages is a viable option that the US could consider. Large US
military transfers to Taiwan such as the sale of 150 fighter jets in
1992 drew strong condemnation from China, raising tensions throughout
the region. By making smaller but more regular arms sales to Taiwan, the
US is honouring its security arrangement and limiting Chinese anxieties.
China's perspective China views US arms sales to Taiwan as a threat to
its national and strategic interests. This threat is driven by a deep
sense of national humiliation suffered under foreign rulers during its
imperial past. This narrative has been espoused by Chinese foreign
policy-makers to promote nationalistic sentiment at home. For China,
national pride is at stake with regard to Taiwan in its pursuit for
national rejuvenation. The US presence in Taiwan threatens the source of
this national pride and revives painful historical memories of foreign
encroachment and occupation. Given that China believes Taiwan to be
indivisible from the PRC, US arms deals to a secessionist Taiwan is
viewed by China as hostile anti-Chinese behaviour. Taiwanese prospects
Taiwan is at the centre of a great power contest as it struggles to
achieve sovereignty from its powerful mainland neighbour, whilst having
the freedom to pursue greater relations with the West. As an island
nation that has forged a distinct political and social identity from the
mainland, Taiwan's foreign policy towards China has consistently been
one of self-determination. In an effort to achieve independence,
successive Taiwanese leaders have sought greater defensive military
capabilities to deter a potential Chinese assault. In December 2016,
President Tsai Ing-wen angered China by calling President Trump to
congratulate his win and reaffirm the alliance. With Trump's recent arms
sales approval, Taiwanese defence policy-makers have been appeased after
months of uncertainty. Taiwanese efforts to boost its military
capability has become a national priority as it looks to counterbalance
a more assertive China. [Whilst Taiwan does not have the capability to
defeat a conventional Chinese assault, it could inflict enough damage
for the cost to be too great to warrant attempting.]{.underline}
President [Tsai is faced with Taiwan's usual foreign policy
dilemma---appeasing China whilst still relying on US security
commitments. Through decades of careful diplomatic manoeuvring, **Taiwan
has been able to strike an uneasy balance between the US and China which
Tsai will want to preserve**]{.underline}. [So far, she has kept
satisfactory cross-strait relations by **keeping to the status
quo**]{.underline}. However challenges will always remain for any
Taiwanese leader who must play off two competing great powers.

#### Existing US posture deters initiation of conflict by [both sides]{.underline} -- accommodation ensures [fast escalation]{.underline}

Deterrence and Reassurance Last but not least, [abandoning Taiwan would
destroy the delicate balance between deterrence and
reassurance]{.underline}, a balance that is [critical to regional
stability]{.underline}. Current US policy toward Taiwan aims to achieve
dual deterrence. [Aside from deterring China from attacking Taiwan,
Washington also seeks to deter Taiwan from taking political initiatives
that could destabilize the situation]{.underline}.52 Deterrence alone,
however, is not sufficient to maintain the peace. [Effective deterrence
requires]{.underline} both [coercive threats and credible
reassurances]{.underline}. In addition to issuing the threats, [the
deterring state]{.underline} also [needs to reassure the target state
that if it does not alter the status quo, its core interests would not
be deprived.]{.underline} Otherwise, the target will have no incentives
to heed the threats. As Thomas Schelling points out, "any coercive
threat requires corresponding assurances."53 Thomas Christensen notes
that [successful deterrence requires "a mix of credible threats
and]{.underline} credible [reassurances" about the conditions under
which those threats would be carried out]{.underline}.54 The same logic
applies to dual deterrence. In such a situation, the deterring state
needs to deter not one but two states from destabilizing the status quo.
On the one hand, [the deterring state communicates coercive threats to
both target states about not changing the status quo]{.underline}. On
the other hand, [it needs to reassure the target states that their
interests will not be sacrificed if they do not take steps to change the
status quo]{.underline}. Without reassurance that their interests would
not be jeopardized, the target states would have no incentives to abide
by the deterrent threats. The 1995--1996 Taiwan Strait Crisis
demonstrates the imperatives of maintaining a delicate balance between
deterrence and reassurance. When Washington decided to issue a visa to
Taiwan President Lee Teng-hui to visit his alma mater, Cornell
University, in 1995, it deassured Beijing about the US commitment to the
one-China policy. Beijing responded to "creeping Taiwan independence" by
launching missiles off Taiwan's ports, prompting Washington to dispatch
two aircraft carriers to the region. In the aftermath of the crisis,
President Bill [Clinton attempted to calm Beijing's fear]{.underline}
while visiting Shanghai [in 1998 by publicly announcing]{.underline} the
"Three Noes" ([no support of Taiwan independence]{.underline}; no
support of "two Chinas" or "one China, one Taiwan"; and no support of
Taiwan's membership in any international organization that requires
statehood). **[But he overcorrected]{.underline}**. As Andrew Nathan
points out, [this "intentional tilt toward Beijing" was
counterproductive. It led President Lee to harden Taiwan's
position]{.underline} by declaring that cross-Strait relations were akin
to "special state-to- state relationship." **[Tensions quickly
escalated]{.underline}**, [with Beijing freezing all contacts with
Taiwan]{.underline}. Nathan concludes, "The United States' policy of
reassuring Beijing has also deassured Taiwan, thus worsening rather than
easing tensions."55 Thus, [accommodating China on Taiwan would have
the]{.underline} similar [effect of **deassuring Taiwan** and **raising
tensions**]{.underline}. It [would destroy the **delicate balance**
between deterrence and reassurance]{.underline}. **[Accommodation would
force Taiwan into taking risky political initiatives that could further
destabilize the Taiwan Strait]{.underline}**, as it did after President
Clinton's "three noes" announcement in 1998. [The current US policy of
strategic ambiguity has kept the peace in the region, and there is no
sound strategic rationale to change a successful policy.]{.underline}

### \-\-- XT: No Solvency/Prolif Turn 

#### Arms sales preserve stability -- the plan guarantees Taiwan clings to independence, increases risks of prolif, and emboldens Chinese coercion

Indeed, [even the best-case scenario for Beijing is unpredictable and
potentially destabilizing]{.underline}. We can say Gilley is right, and
Taiwan is moving toward Finlandization. In fact, there is ample evidence
for a consensus within Taiwan that deeper engagement with mainland China
is both inevitable and desirable. At the same time, however, [the
Taiwanese people are more attached than ever to their political autonomy
and distinctive identity. Withdrawing US security assistance would not
change these attitudes, but many Taiwanese people would view this
action]{.underline}, rightly or wrongly, [as a deathblow to the island's
autonomy.]{.underline} [Some would]{.underline} try to flee. Others
would [urge their government to **develop doomsday weapons** to keep the
PRC at bay, a desperate measure the U]{.underline}nited
[S]{.underline}tates [has so far dissuaded Taiwan from
pursuing]{.underline}. [Others]{.underline} still [would encourage
Taipei to hold out as long as possible]{.underline}. [The economic costs
of undermining the Taiwanese people's confidence in their own security
would be huge, and negotiating a peaceful, mutually acceptable
unification in such an environment would be **nearly
impossible**]{.underline}. To finish the job, [China would]{.underline}
almost certainly [be forced to resort to **coercive
measures**]{.underline}---precisely the expensive and risky undertaking
Chinese leaders are hoping to avoid. And [even if]{.underline} its
[coercive measures succeeded]{.underline} in winning the Taiwan
government's acquiescence, [integrating 23 million sullen and terrified
Taiwanese into the PRC would be yet another daunting and expensive
project]{.underline}. [US security assistance **stabilizes** both sides
of the Taiwan Strait by **reassuring the Taiwanese people** and
justifying Beijing's decision to be patient]{.underline}.

#### Plan won't encourage unification -- nationalism and public opposition outweigh 

**Roy 12** (Dr. Denny Roy is a senior research fellow in Asian security

<http://globalpublicsquare.blogs.cnn.com/2012/12/06/why-the-u-s-shouldnt-abandon-taiwan/>)

[Advocates of abandoning Taiwan may erroneously believe that halting
U.S. military and diplomatic support for Taipei would reduce tensions in
East Asia]{.underline}. This is certainly what Beijing would have us
believe. According to Chinese officials and commentators, U.S.
assistance to Taipei is all that stands in the way of peaceful
unification, and without it the people of Taiwan would stop resisting
and accept Beijing's terms for unification. This premise, however,
ignores an important reality: **[the main obstacle to unification is not
U.S. arms sales]{.underline}**, [but rather **Taiwanese nationalism**
and the wish of nearly all **Taiwan's people** not to be ruled by the
C]{.underline}hinese [C]{.underline}ommunist [P]{.underline}arty. Thus,
[withdrawal of U.S. support would not necessarily lead to a peaceful
resolution of the cross-Strait imbroglio.]{.underline} **[The opposite
outcome is]{.underline}** at least **[as likely]{.underline}**.
[Deterrence against an attack]{.underline} by the People's Liberation
Army [would be weakened, while Taiwan's people may well choose to fight
rather than capitulate.]{.underline}

#### The plan's signal of appeasement will only increase tensions and discourage diplomacy by both sides 

**Shelley 11** \-\-- PhD in Government, Harvard (Brown Professor of East

<http://www.aei.org/publication/why-giving-up-taiwan-will-not-help-us-with-china/>)

In practice, unfortunately, [there is no guarantee]{.underline} that [a
change in US policy toward Taiwan would]{.underline} instantly or
automatically [end, or]{.underline} even significantly [reduce, the
tensions the Taiwan issue creates in Sino-American
relations]{.underline}. [Ending security assistance to Taiwan would
**raise expectations in China** without removing the existing obstacles
to peaceful unification]{.underline}. [It]{.underline} likely [would
**provoke panic in Taiwan**, but it would not make the Taiwanese people
any more enthusiastic about unification. On the contrary, the more
vulnerable and threatened the Taiwanese people felt, the harder it would
be for them to consider China's overtures rationally.]{.underline} For
decades, the United States has justified arms sales to Taiwan on the
grounds that Taipei can negotiate with Beijing more effectively from a
position of strength than of weakness. It is easy to dismiss this logic
as a rationalization, but as Randall Schriver said, "[In what other
instance involving a negotiation is the weaker party better
off?]{.underline} . . . [Historically, what you find is where there
is]{.underline} equal power---or, at least, [credible deterrent
power---you get **better outcomes**]{.underline}." [Neither Beijing nor
Taipei is well served by a negotiating process that leads to a **bad
deal**, including **one Taiwanese citizens cannot accept**]{.underline}.
[Successfully pressuring Taiwan's negotiators into accepting a deal
might seem like a victory for Beijing, but if Taiwan's domestic politics
make it impossible to implement the deal, the long-term result might be
**worse than no deal at all**.]{.underline}

#### Causes "envelope pushing" by both sides 

**Shelley 11** \-\-- PhD in Government, Harvard (Brown Professor of East

<http://www.aei.org/publication/why-giving-up-taiwan-will-not-help-us-with-china/>)

Both authors, in other words, admitted that some kind of US security
guarantee was necessary for Taiwan: in exchange for ending arms sales,
the United States would need to make an implicit (or explicit) "promise
to intervene." Three serious problems with this line of argument exist.
First, [in the absence of arms sales, a promise to intervene might not
be credible]{.underline}. [Could the U]{.underline}nited
[S]{.underline}tates [mount a successful defense of Taiwan if the island
had been disarmed?]{.underline} Second, [such a policy invites
**envelope pushing** on **both sides of the strait**. America's
decades-old policy of strategic ambiguity is based on the idea that
keeping the two sides guessing about how the U]{.underline}nited
[S]{.underline}tates [will react in a crisis **restrains** Taiwan's
tendency toward **recklessness** and Beijing's tendency toward
**aggression**]{.underline}. Gilley and Glaser are recommending the
United States ditch that policy.

## AT: US-China Relations ADV

### 1NC Appeasement Turn 

#### Chinese strategic motives inevitably derail relations -- only maintaining Trump's current strategy can deter erosion of global order and stability 

**Blackwill 5/7/19** (Robert D., Henry A. Kissinger senior fellow for
U.S. foreign policy at the Council on Foreign Relations, "Trump Deserves
More Credit for His Foreign Policies,"
<https://foreignpolicy.com/2019/05/07/trump-deserves-more-credit-for-his-foreign-policies/>)

For example, long [before Trump]{.underline} took office, [successive
U.S. administrations pursued approaches to China that misread Beijing's
strategic intentions. While U.S. presidents crafted optimistic
statements about the relationship]{.underline} over a nearly 20-year
period, [Beijing implemented a grand strategy designed to undermine
U.S.-Asian alliances]{.underline}. [China used geoeconomic tools to
coerce its neighbors and others into its sway]{.underline}, most
recently through the Belt and Road Initiative. [It violated
international commercial practices]{.underline}, including by
[committing massive theft of U.S. intellectual property]{.underline}.
[It manipulated its currency for trade benefits, threatened Taiwan,
built up its military forces to push the United States beyond Japan and
the Philippines, constructed and militarized artificial islands in the
**S**]{.underline}outh **[C]{.underline}**hina **[S]{.underline}**ea [in
violation of international law, systemically and brutally violated the
human rights of its own people, and patiently and incrementally built
its power and influence with the strategic goal of replacing the
U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates [as the primary power in
Asia]{.underline}. This U.S. misunderstanding of China's objectives over
nearly two decades ranks as one of the three most damaging U.S.
foreign-policy errors since the end of World War II, along with the 1965
military escalation in Vietnam and the 2003 invasion of Iraq. Indeed,
[this prolonged failure in China policy could turn out to be the biggest
U.S. policy deficiency in the past seven decades, given the accumulating
dangerous strategic consequences of the rise of Chinese power for
**world order**]{.underline} as well as for the United States and its
allies and friends. To its credit, **[the Trump administration has
adopted a much more clear-eyed approach to China that breaks with many
of the errors of the past]{.underline}**. [The president's
confrontational trade policy could lead to concessions from the Chinese
government that his immediate predecessors sought but could not get
through traditional diplomatic means]{.underline}. And on Oct. 4, 2018,
Vice President Mike Pence delivered the toughest speech on U.S.-China
relations by a U.S. administration since former U.S. President Richard
Nixon opened up the relationship. "China now spends as much on its
military as the rest of Asia combined, and Beijing has prioritized
capabilities to erode America's military advantages on land, at sea, in
the air, and in space," Pence said. "China wants nothing less than to
push the United States of America from the Western Pacific and attempt
to prevent us from coming to the aid of our allies." Although his
withdrawal from the Trans-Pacific Partnership and constant
confrontations with U.S. allies have weakened his administration's China
policy, [Trump's political push to address the increasing dangers of
Chinese power is more important]{.underline}---because his successor can
remedy these mistakes. [Without the president's initiative, Washington
might well have continued sleepwalking as Beijing drew large parts of
Asia into its orbit and away from the U]{.underline}nited
[S]{.underline}tates.

Does China Have Limited Aims? [The claim of a limited-aims China is not
backed up by logic and evidence]{.underline}. To begin with, [whether a
state has limited aims is private information that outsiders cannot
discern with confidence. States also have incentives to conceal or
misrepresent their true aims to mislead others and to gain
advantages]{.underline}. [More importantly, present aims can change in
the future as a state's power increases]{.underline}. [A state that
professes status quo aims today may shift to an expansionist stance in
the future when it has developed the capabilities to alter the status
quo]{.underline}, such as existing territorial arrangements and
alignment patterns among states. Thus, [claiming that China is motivated
by limited aims is **logically unpersuasive** and **empirically
unknowable**]{.underline}. In addition, **[there is no conclusive
evidence to support a limited-aims China]{.underline}**. [There is no
agreement, let alone consensus, among analysts when it comes to China's
foreign policy goals.]{.underline} Some view China as a conservative,
defensive power intent on protecting its territory, while others see
China as an aggressive, expansionist state seeking to dominate Asia.33
To complicate matters further, there are no widely accepted guidelines
for determining a state's foreign policy goals. After a conflict has
occurred, scholars often find themselves debating whether the initiator
was motivated by security or by greed. For instance, one hundred years
after the outbreak of World War I, there is still no consensus among
scholars about whether Germany was driven by the limited aims of
insecurity or by a greedy desire for hegemony. As Sebastian Rosato
persuasively argues, "if scholars armed with definitions and the
documentary record cannot agree about what states wanted long after the
fact, it is unlikely that great powers can do so in real time."34 [Since
we face uncertainty about China's foreign policy goals, **abandoning
Taiwan to China is highly risky and dangerous**.]{.underline} It [would
not convince Beijing that Washington harbors only benign intentions
toward China and seeks cooperative relations]{.underline}. Instead,
[Beijing is likely to see such a concession as a sign of **growing US
weakness** and as a vindication of China's successful pursuit of power.
US concession on Taiwan would also fuel **Chinese
nationalism**]{.underline}.35 It is dangerous to assume that, once
Washington abandons Taiwan, Beijing would restrain its foreign policy
ambitions or become a status quo power. On the contrary, [by acquiring a
forward base in the First Island Chain, China's capabilities to project
power would be substantially enhanced should Taiwan fall into Beijing's
orbit]{.underline}. Rather than limiting its aims, [Beijing would likely
push for **more concessions** on **other issues**]{.underline}. As John
Mearsheimer points out, "[appeasement is likely to make a dangerous
rival more, not less, dangerous.]{.underline}"36 [The structurally
driven imperatives for China to maximize relative power in Asia will not
stop at the waters of Taiwan]{.underline}. [We have evidence that
accommodation encourages more aggressive behavior by China]{.underline}.
[In the early years of]{.underline} the [Obama]{.underline}
administration, [the U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates
**[attempted]{.underline}** [to accommodate China]{.underline}
[by]{.underline} refraining from criticizing China's human rights
records, **[postponing arms sales to Taiwan]{.underline}**,
demonstrating willingness to respect China's "core interests," and
delaying meeting with the Dalai Lama. **[Instead of moderating its
foreign policy aims, China took these unilateral concessions as "signs
of American weakness, and proof that China could get away with more
assertiveness."]{.underline}**37 The outbreak of World War II in Europe
exemplifies the danger of accommodation as well as the inherent
difficulty of discerning an adversary's foreign policy goals. Before the
war, many European leaders and analysts considered Nazi Germany a
limited-aims state driven by its security needs. They found excuses for
Hitler's demands and proposed a policy of appeasement. Winston
Churchill's warning about Hitler, which turned out to be correct, was
considered alarmist. During the Munich Crisis, Sir Neville Henderson,
the British ambassador in Berlin, found excuses in Hitler's action and
rationalized it in this way: "One must also try to understand the German
point of view. If we were in Germany's place what would we, in the midst
of all this war psychosis, be doing: exactly what I think the Germans
are today doing."38 In hindsight, policymakers misread Germany's foreign
policy goals and chose the disastrous policy of appeasement.

In Mr. Obama\'s second term the limits of such withdrawal from
conventional military commitments abroad will be tested. In East Asia,
[an assertive China has bullied the Philippines]{.underline} (with which
the U.S. has a 61-year-old defense pact) over the Spratly islands,
[and]{.underline} China has [pressed its claims on Japan]{.underline} (a
53-year-old defense pact) over the Senkaku Islands. [At stake are
territorial waters and mineral resources---symbols of China\'s drive for
hegemony and an outburst of national egotism]{.underline}. Yet when
Shinzo Abe, the new prime minister of an understandably anxious Japan,
traveled to Washington in February, he didn\'t get the unambiguous White
House backing of Japan\'s sovereignty that an ally of long standing
deserves and needs. In Europe, [an oil-rich Russia is rebuilding its
conventional arsenal while modernizing]{.underline} (as have China and
Pakistan) [its nuclear arsenal.]{.underline} Russia has been menacing
its East European neighbors, including those, like Poland, that have
offered to host elements of a NATO missile-defense system to protect
Europe. In 2012, Russia\'s then-chief of general staff, Gen. Nikolai
Makarov, declared: \"A decision to use destructive force pre-emptively
will be taken if the situation worsens.\" This would be the same Russia
that has attempted to dismember its neighbor Georgia and now has a
docile Russophile billionaire, Prime Minister Bidzina Ivanishvili, to
supplant the balky, independence-minded government loyal to President
Mikhail Saakashvili. In the Persian Gulf, American policy was laid down
by Jimmy Carter in his 1980 State of the Union address with what became
the Carter Doctrine: \"An attempt by any outside force to gain control
of the Persian Gulf region will be regarded as an assault on the vital
interests of the United States of America, and such an assault will be
repelled by any means necessary, including military force.\" [America\'s
Gulf allies]{.underline} may not have treaties to rely upon---but they
do [have decades of promises]{.underline} and the evidence of two wars
[that the U.S. would stand by them]{.underline}. Today they wait for the
long-promised (by Presidents Obama and George W. Bush) nuclear
disarmament of a revolutionary Iranian government that has been
relentless in its efforts to intimidate and subvert Iran\'s neighbors.
They may wait in vain. [Americans take for granted the world in
which]{.underline} they grew up---a world in which, for better or worse,
[the U.S. was the ultimate security guarantor of]{.underline} scores of
states, and in many ways **[the entire international
system]{.underline}**. Today we are informed by many politicians and
commentators that we are weary of those burdens---though what we should
be weary of, given that our children aren\'t conscripted and our taxes
aren\'t being raised in order to pay for those wars, is unclear. The
truth is that defense spending at the rate of 4% of gross domestic
product (less than that sustained with ease by Singapore) is eminently
affordable. The arguments against far-flung American strategic
commitments take many forms. So-called foreign policy realists,
particularly in the academic world, believe that the competing interests
of states tend automatically toward balance and require no statesmanlike
action by the U.S. To them, the old language of force in international
politics has become as obsolete as that of the \"code duello,\" which
regulated individual honor fights through the early 19th century. We
hear that international institutions and agreements can replace national
strength. It is also said---covertly but significantly---that the U.S.
is too dumb and inept to play the role of security guarantor. Perhaps
the clever political scientists, complacent humanists, Spenglerian
declinists, right and left neo-isolationists, and simple doubters that
the U.S. can do anything right are correct. Perhaps the president should
concentrate on nation-building at home while pressing abroad only for
climate-change agreements, nuclear disarmament and an unfettered right
to pick off bad guys (including Americans) as he sees fit. But [if
history is any guide, foreign policy as]{.underline} a political-science
field experiment or [what-me-worryism]{.underline} [will yield some ugly
results]{.underline}. [Syria is a harbinger of things to
come]{.underline}. In that case, the dislocation, torture and death have
first afflicted the locals. But it will not end there, as incidents on
Syria\'s borders and rumors of the movement of chemical weapons suggest.
[A world in which the U.S. abnegates its leadership will be a world of
unrestricted self-help in which China sets the rules of
politics]{.underline} and trade in Asia, [mayhem and chaos is the order
of the day in the Middle East, and timidity and appeasement paralyze the
free European states. A world]{.underline}, in short, [where the strong
do what they will, the weak suffer what they must, and those with an
option hurry up and get nuclear weapons]{.underline}.

about what they see as US interference in China's domestic affairs, [US
security assistance to Taiwan actually **reinforces** their current

undermine that goal.]{.underline} As long as Taiwan does not lunge for
formal independence, unification can wait. [US security
assistance]{.underline}---both the possibility of direct intervention

Democratic and Strategic Values The fourth error in the "[abandoning
Taiwan]{.underline}" argument is its [damage]{.underline} to the [US
policy of promoting democracy and freedom around the
world]{.underline}.45 US policymakers have spoken of Taiwan as a "beacon
of democracy."46 [Abandoning a democracy to an authoritarian government
would undercut Washington's stated interests in supporting democracy and
freedom around the world.]{.underline} [Both Taiwan and the
U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates [share common democratic
values. Forsaking Taiwan would jeopardize these values]{.underline}.
Charles Glaser agrees: "The United States has a significant interest in
promoting and protecting freedom and democracy around the globe. Cutting
the US commitment to Taiwan would put these values at risk."47 But he
argues that these values could be sacrificed for national security
interests: "Nevertheless, states usually should, and usually do, give
priority to their key national security interests. The United States
should not be an exception: it should pursue these political and
ideological interests only if the risks to its national security are
relatively small in comparison."48 In his view, supporting a democratic
Taiwan is incompatible with US national security interests, and
therefore, the United States should accommodate China on Taiwan. What
Glaser and others fail to recognize is that [protecting Taiwan serves
both US national security interests and democratic values. Taiwan's
geostrategic location is of particular value to US national security
interests. Taiwan's democracy reinforces its strategic values to the
U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates. As noted earlier, [the US
security objective in Asia is to maintain a balance of power and to
prevent any country from dominating the region. Taiwan is strategically
situated between the]{.underline} East China Sea \[[ECS\] and
the]{.underline} South China Sea \[[SCS\], two areas of rising
importance. Taiwan controls the]{.underline} sea lines of communication
([SLOCs) extending from Japan to Southeast Asia and serves as a check on
China's maritime expansions]{.underline} into the East and the South
China Seas. [As China rises, Taiwan's strategic value]{.underline} to
the United States [will rise as well]{.underline}. [Taiwan has
substantial economic and military resources to contribute to America's
Asia strategy. The imperatives of the balance of power will prompt
Washington to give more---not less---thought to Taiwan's geopolitical
importance]{.underline}. As John Mearsheimer points out, for their own
strategic interests, "\[US policy makers\] will be inclined to back
Taiwan no matter what."49 [Taiwan's geography serves as a strategic
constraint on the PLA's maritime expansion in the]{.underline} East and
South China Seas \[[ESCS]{.underline}\]. PLA leaders have stressed the
necessity of breaking out of the First Island Chain that runs from
Japan, Taiwan, and the Philippines, through the Indonesian archipelago.
In PLA writings, Taiwan is described as "Gibraltar of the East" and a
"springboard" to the Pacific: "[if the Taiwan problem is resolved, the
door to the Pacific Ocean will be opened for mainland China, thus
breaking the first island chain]{.underline}."50 Taiwan is crucial to
the PLA's attainment of command of the sea from the Yellow, East China,
and South China seas, which are critical to protecting China's
commercial interests and energy security. [The PLA's authoritative
Science of Military Strategy goes so far as to link Taiwan to the
rejuvenation of the Chinese nation:]{.underline} "If Taiwan should be
alienated from the mainland ... China will forever be locked to the west
side of the first chain of islands in the West Pacific.... \[If so\],
the essential strategic space for China's rejuvenation will be lost."51
Far from being a strategic liability, as advocates of abandoning Taiwan
believe, **[Taiwan is a strategic asset]{.underline}** for the United
States and its allies. During the Cold War, Gen. Douglas MacArthur
famously referred to Taiwan as **[an "unsinkable aircraft
carrier."]{.underline}** Today, [China's strategic planners see Taiwan
as an integral part of its future naval power, as a way to break out of
the encirclement of the First Island Chain. In the PLA's strategic
planning, Taiwan is part of the First Island Chain that the Chinese navy
must have access to. Beijing's acquisition of Taiwan would enhance
China's naval capabilities and give the PLA Navy greater strategic
depth. It would adversely affect Japan's maritime security, making it
more difficult for the U]{.underline}nited States [to defend its
ally]{.underline}. [Taiwan's close location to the Philippine Sea and
the Luzon Strait would also provide the PLA Navy easy access to
the]{.underline} South China Sea \[[SCS\], an area fraught with
territorial disputes]{.underline}.

[Abandoning Taiwan would likely fail to ameliorate the Sino-U.S.
Relationship. There are certain core issues troubling the Sino-U.S.
relationship that extend far beyond the Taiwan Strait. Whether it is
Beijing's assertiveness towards its neighbors,]{.underline} some of
whom, [like Japan and the Philippines]{.underline}, are treaty allies of
the United States, [or issues related to cyber-espionage and human
rights, the challenges currently testing the bilateral relationship are
**profound** and **numerous**]{.underline}. [China is a revisionist
power---and its claims on the international system do not end with
Taiwan. One should not surmise]{.underline}, therefore, [that Sino-U.S.
strategic competition would abate were the Taiwan issue to be
resolved]{.underline}. Indeed, [a growing body of work in the strategic
studies community has suggested that Sino-U.S. tensions are more
**structural** than conjectural, and are the natural result of the
friction that traditionally occurs between rising and established
powers]{.underline}. Furthermore, [while some may assume]{.underline}
that [China's absorption of Taiwan might provide]{.underline} at least
[a symbolic first step towards a more stable and peaceful relationship
between Washington and Beijing, this hypothesis]{.underline} also
[appears]{.underline} somewhat [untenable]{.underline}. To the contrary,
[an American abandonment of Taiwan might only succeed in
**emboldening**]{.underline}, [and **strengthening** hardline elements
within Beijing's leadership, by providing a material confirmation of
their]{.underline} long-held [desire to see America progressively
retreat]{.underline} from the Indo-Pacific theater. Bonnie Glaser and
Nancy Bernkopf Tucker have expressed their concerns over such a
development, cautioning that: [A decision to]{.underline} jettison
Taiwan, or even [cut back significantly on U.S. support, would prove to
an increasingly confident China that Washington has become weak,
vacillating and unreliable]{.underline}...Accordingly, [a U.S. sacrifice
of Taiwan]{.underline}, while gratifying, [could not thoroughly slake a
continuing need for Beijing to demonstrate its power.]{.underline}
Indeed, [the sacrifice might promote new appetites and necessitate fresh

Proposals to scale back US security ties to Taiwan are controversial,
however, and several scholars have written thoughtful critiques of the
idea. These critiques have generally made a few key points. First, [it
is not self-evident that ending security ties with Taiwan would in fact
transform the US-China relationship: the interests of the two
countries]{.underline} arguably [clash on **many other
issues**]{.underline} ([North Korea, maritime disputes in East Asia,
economic issues), and it is unclear why Beijing would yield on these
other issues if only the U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates [were
to adopt a policy on arms sales that---from Beijing's vantage---the
U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates [had already committed
to]{.underline} follow in the 1982 joint communiqué. Second, the United
States' reputation in the region could be at stake. Some worry that
walking away from a commitment to Taiwan would send a troubling signal
to other US allies in East Asia. [Beijing might]{.underline} likewise
[view US concessions on Taiwan as **a sign of weakness** and conclude
that Washington was **unlikely to challenge the PRC on other issues in
the region**.]{.underline} Third, ending arms sales---because it would
add to Taiwan's sense of insecurity---could actually make Taipei more
hesitant about entering into sensitive political talks with the PRC;
thus it isn't clear that a reduced US commitment to Taiwan would
facilitate a peaceful resolution to the dispute. Finally, and relatedly,
[ending arms sales would likely undercut Taiwan's deterrent
capabilities, which in turn could encourage a more coercive PRC approach
to the island]{.underline}.10

### \-\-- XT: China = Revisionist 

#### China is revisionist\-\--weak American responses embolden aggression.

**Choi 18**---Ji Young Choi, associate professor in the Department of
Politics and Government and affiliated professor in the International
Studies Program and East Asian Studies Program at Ohio Wesleyan
University ("Historical and Theoretical Perspectives on the Rise of
China: Long Cycles, Power Transitions, and China\'s Ascent," *Asian
Perspective*, Vol. 42, Issue 1, January-March 2018, pages 61-84,
Available through ProQuest)

I have explored in light of historical and theoretical perspectives
whether China is a candidate to become a global hegemonic power. The
next question I will address is whether the ascent of China will lead to
a hegemonic war or not. As mentioned previously, historical and
theoretical lessons reveal that **[a rising great power tends to
challenge a system leader]{.underline}** [when the former\'s economic
and other major capabilities come too close to those of the latter and
the **former is dissatisfied with the latter\'s
leadership**]{.underline} and the international rules it created. This
means that **[the rise of China could produce intense hegemonic
competition]{.underline}** [and even a **global hegemonic
war**]{.underline}. The preventive motivation by an old declining power
can cause a major war with a newly emerging power when it is combined
with other variables (Levy 1987). While a preventive war by a system
leader is historically rare, [a newly emerging yet even relatively weak
rising power at times challenges a much more powerful system
leader]{.underline}, as in the case of Japan\'s attack on Pearl Harbor
in 1941 (Schweller 1999). A historical lesson is that \"**[incomplete
catch-ups are inherently conflict-prone]{.underline}**\" (Thompson 2006,
19). This implies that [even though it falls short of surpassing the
system leader, the rise of a new great power can produce **significant
instability in the interstate system**]{.underline} when it develops
into a revisionist power. Moreover, [the]{.underline}
**[U]{.underline}**nited **[S]{.underline}**tates [and China are deeply
involved in **major security issues**]{.underline} [in East
Asia]{.underline} ([including the]{.underline} **[North Korean nuclear
crisis]{.underline}**, the **[Taiwan]{.underline}** issue, [and
the]{.underline} **[S]{.underline}**outh **[C]{.underline}**hina
**[S]{.underline}**ea disputes), [and we cannot rule out the possibility
that one of these regional conflicts will develop into a much **bigger
global war**]{.underline} in which the two superpowers are entangled.
According to Allison (2017), who studied sixteen historical cases in
which a rising power confronted an existing power, a war between the
United States and China is not unavoidable, but escaping it will require
enormous efforts by both sides. Some Chinese scholars (Jia 2009; Wang
and Zhu 2015), who emphasize the transformation of China\'s domestic
politics and the pragmatism of Beijing\'s diplomacy, have a more or less
optimistic view of the future of US-China relations. Yet my reading of
the situation is that [since 2009 there has been an increasing gap
between this optimistic view and what has really happened]{.underline}.
It is premature to conclude that China is a revisionist state, but in
what follows I will suggest some important signs that show **[China has
revisionist aims]{.underline}** at least [in the Asia Pacific and could
**develop into a revisionist power** in the future.]{.underline}¶
[Beijing has concentrated on economic modernization]{.underline} since
the start of pro-market reforms in the late 1970s and made efforts to
keep a low profile in international security issues for several decades.
It followed Deng Xiaoping\'s doctrine: \"hide one\'s capabilities, bide
one\'s time, and seek the right opportunity.\" Since 2003, China\'s
motto has been \"Peaceful Rise\" or \"Peaceful Development,\" and
Chinese leadership has emphasized that the rise of China would not
threaten any other countries. Recently, however, **[Beijing has adopted
increasingly assertive]{.underline}** [or even]{.underline}
**[aggressive foreign policies]{.underline}** [in international security
affairs]{.underline}. In particular, [China has been **adamant about
territorial issues**]{.underline} [in the East and South China
Seas]{.underline} [and is increasingly **considered as a severe
threat**]{.underline} [by other nations]{.underline} in the Asia Pacific
region. Since 2009, for example, Beijing has increased naval activities
on a large scale in the area of the Diaoyu/Senkaku Islands in the East
China Sea. In 2010, [Beijing announced that]{.underline} just **[like
Tibet and Taiwan]{.underline}**, [the]{.underline}
**[S]{.underline}**outh **[C]{.underline}**hina **[S]{.underline}**ea
[is]{.underline} considered [a]{.underline} **[core national
interest]{.underline}**. We can identify drastic rhetorical changes as
well. In 2010, China\'s foreign minister publicly stated, \"China is a
big country . . . and other countries are small countries and that is
just a fact\" (Economist 2012). In October 2013, Chinese leader Xi
Jinping also used the words \"struggle and achieve results,\"
emphasizing the importance of China\'s territorial integrity (Waldron
2014, 166-167). Furthermore, **[China has constructed]{.underline}**
man-made **[islands]{.underline}** [in the]{.underline}
**[S]{.underline}**outh **[C]{.underline}**hina **[S]{.underline}**ea
[to seek]{.underline} \"[de facto control]{.underline} over the
resource-rich waters and islets\" claimed as well by its neighboring
countries (Los Angeles Times 2015). As of now, China\'s strategy is to
delay a direct military conflict with the United States as long as
possible and use its economic and political prowess to pressure smaller
neighbors to give up their territorial claims (Doran 2012). These new
developments and rhetorical signals reflect significant changes in
China\'s foreign policies and signify that **[China\'s peaceful rise
seems to be over]{.underline}**.¶ [A rising great power\'s consistent
and determined policies to increase military buildups can be read as one
of the significant signs of the rising power\'s **dissatisfaction with
the existing order**]{.underline} [and its willingness to do
battle]{.underline} if it is really necessary. In the words of Rapkin
and Thompson (2003, 318), \"**[arms buildups]{.underline}** and arms
races . . . [reflect substantial dissatisfaction on the part of the
challenger and an attempt to accelerate the pace of military catchup and
the development of a **relative power advantage**]{.underline}.\" Werner
and Kugler (1996) also posit that if an emerging challenger\'s military
expenditures are increasing faster than those of a system leader, parity
can be very dangerous to the international political order. China\'s GDP
is currently around 60 percent of that of the United States, so parity
has not been reached yet. China\'s military budget, however, has grown
enormously for the past two decades (double-digit growth nearly every
year), which is creating concerns among neighboring nations and a system
leader, the United States. In addition to its air force, China\'s
strengthening navy or sea power has been one of the main goals in its
military modernization program. [Beijing has invested large financial
resources in constructing new naval vessels, submarines, and aircraft
carriers]{.underline} (Economist 2012). Furthermore, in its new defense
white paper in 2015, [Beijing made clear a vision to **expand the global
role for its military**]{.underline}, particularly its naval force, to
protect its overseas economic and strategic interests (Tiezzi 2015).¶
Sea power has special importance for an emerging great power. As Mahan
(1987 \[1890\]) explained cogently in one of his classic books on naval
strategy, Great Britain was able to emerge as a new hegemonic power
because of the superiority of its naval capacity and technology and its
effective control of main international sealanes. **[Naval power has a
special significance for China]{.underline}**, a newly emerging power,
as well as [for both **economic and strategic reasons**]{.underline}.
First, [its economy\'s rapid growth requires external expansion to
ensure raw materials and the foreign markets]{.underline} to sell its
products. Therefore, naval power becomes crucial in protecting its
overseas business interests and activities. Second, [securing major
sea-lanes becomes increasingly important as they will be crucial
lifelines for the **supply of energy, raw materials, and other essential
goods**]{.underline} [should China become involved in a hegemonic war or
any other **major military conflict**]{.underline} (Friedberg 2011). In
light of this, it is understandable why China is so stubborn over
territorial issues in the South China and East China Seas. In fact,
history tells us that many rising powers invested in sea power to expand
their global influence, and indeed all the global hegemons including
Great Britain and the United States were predominant naval powers.¶
Another important aspect is that [Beijing is beginning to voice its
dissatisfaction with the existing **international economic
order**]{.underline} [and take actions that could potentially change
this order]{.underline}. [The Chinese economy has]{.underline} overall
[benefited from the post-World War II international liberal order, but
the Bretton Woods institutions]{.underline} like the IMF and the World
Bank [have been **dominated by the**]{.underline}
**[U]{.underline}**nited **[S]{.underline}**tates [and its allies and
**China does not have much power**]{.underline} or voice in these
institutions. Both institutions are based in Washington, DC, and
[the]{.underline} **[U]{.underline}**nited **[S]{.underline}**tates [has
enjoyed the largest voting shares with its veto power]{.underline}.
Along with other emerging economies, [China has called for significant
reforms]{.underline}, especially in the governing system of the IMF, but
reform plans to give more power to China and other emerging economies
have been delayed by the opposition of the US Congress (Choi 2013). In
response to this, [Beijing recently took the initiative to create
new]{.underline} **[i]{.underline}**nternational
**[f]{.underline}**inancial **[i]{.underline}**nstitutions including the
AIIB. At this moment, it is premature to say that these new institutions
would be able to replace the Bretton Woods institutions. Nonetheless,
[this new development can be read as a **starting point**]{.underline}
[for significant **changes in global economic and financial governance**
that has been dominated by the United States since the end of World War
II]{.underline} (Subacchi 2015).¶ China\'s historical legacies reinforce
the view that **[China has a willingness to become a global
hegemon]{.underline}**. From the Ming dynasty in the late fourteenth
century to the start of the first Opium War in 1839, China enjoyed its
undisputed hegemonic position in East Asia. \"Sino-centrism\" that is
related to this historical reality has long governed the mentality of
Chinese people. [According to this]{.underline} hierarchical [world
view, China, as the most advanced civilization, is at the **center of
East Asia and the world**]{.underline}, [and all China\'s neighbors are
vassal states]{.underline} (Kang 2010). This mentality was openly
revealed by the Chinese foreign minister\'s recent public statement that
I quoted previously: \"China is a big country . . . and other countries
are small countries and that is just a fact\" (Economist 2012). This
view is related to Chinese people\'s ancient superiority complex that
developed from the long history and rich cultural heritage of Chinese
civilization (Jacques 2012). In a sense, China has always been a
superpower regardless of its economic standing at least in most Chinese
people\'s mind-set. The strong national or civilizational pride of
Chinese people, however, was severely damaged by \"the Century of
Humiliation,\" a period between the first Opium War (1839) and the end
of the Chinese Civil War (1949). During this period, China was
encroached on by the West and invaded by Japan, experienced prolonged
civil conflicts, and finally became a semicolony of Great Britain while
its northern territory was occupied by Japan. [China\'s economic
modernization is viewed as a **national project to lay an economic
foundation**]{.underline} [to overcome this bitter experience of
subjugation]{.underline} and shame and recover its traditional position
and old glory (Choi 2015). Viewed from this perspective, economic
modernization or the accumulation of wealth is not an ultimate objective
of China. Rather, [its final goal is to return to its traditional status
by expanding its **global political and military as well as economic
influence**]{.underline}. What it ultimately desires is recognition
(Anerkennung), respect (Respekt), and status (Stellung). These are
important concepts for constructivists who see ideational motives as the
main driving forces behind interstate conflicts (Lebow 2008). This
reveals that constructivist elements can be combined with long cycle and
power transition theories in explaining the rise and fall of great
powers, although further systematic studies on it are needed.¶
Considering all this, [China has always been a territorial power rather
than a trading state]{.underline}. [China does not seem to be
**satisfied only with the global expansion of international trade** and
the conquest of foreign markets]{.underline}. [It]{.underline} also
**[wants to broaden its]{.underline}** (particularly maritime)
**[territories and spheres of influence]{.underline}** [to recover its
traditional political status as the]{.underline} **[Middle
Kingdom]{.underline}**. As emphasized previously, the type or nature and
goals or ideologies of a rising power matter. Nazi Germany and Imperial
Japan (territorial powers) experienced rapid economic expansion and
sought to expand their territories and influence in the first half of
the twentieth century. For example, during this period Japan\'s goal was
to create the Japanese empire in East Asia under the motto of the East
Asian Co-prosperity Sphere. On the other hand, democratized Germany and
Japan (trading powers) that enjoyed a second economic expansion did not
pursue the expansion of their territories and spheres of influence in
the post-World War II era. Twentiethcentury history suggests that
[political regimes predicated upon]{.underline} **[nondemocratic or
nonliberal]{.underline}** [values]{.underline} and cultures (for
instance, Nazism in Germany and militarism in Japan before the
mid-twentieth century, and communism in the Soviet Union during the Cold
War) can [pose **significant challenges** to democratic and liberal
regimes]{.underline}. The empirical studies of Lemke and Reed (1996)
show that the democratic peace thesis can be used as a subset of power
transition theory. According to their studies, states organized
similarly to the dominant powers politically and economically (liberal
democracy) are generally satisfied with the existing international rules
and order and they tend to be status quo states. Another historical
lesson is that **[economic interdependence alone cannot prevent a war
for hegemony]{.underline}**. [Germany was one of the main trade partners
of Great Britain before World War I]{.underline} (Friedberg 2011), [and
Japan was the number three importer of American products before its
attack on Pearl Harbor]{.underline} (Keylor 2011). A relatively peaceful
relationship or transition is possible when economic interdependence is
supported by a solid democratic alliance between a rising great power
and an existing or declining one.¶ Some scholars such as Ikenberry
(2008) emphasize nuclear deterrence and the high costs of a nuclear war.
Power transition theorists agree that the high costs of a nuclear war
can constrain a war among great powers but do not view them as \"a
perfect deterrent\" to war (Kugler and Zagare 1990; Tammen et al. 2000).
The idea of nuclear deterrence is based upon the assumption of the
rationality of actors (states): as long as the costs of a (nuclear) war
are higher than its benefits, an actor (state) will not initiate the
war. However, even some rationalists admit that certain actors (such as
exceedingly ambitious risk-taking states) do not behave rationally and
engage in unexpected military actions or pursue military overexpansion
beyond its capacity (Glaser 2010). The state\'s behaviors are driven by
its values, perceptions, and political ambitions as well as its rational
calculations of costs and benefits. Especially, national pride,
historical memories, and territorial disputes can make states behave
emotionally. The possibility of a war between a democratic nation and a
nondemocratic regime increases because they do not share the same values
and beliefs and, therefore, the level of mistrust between them tends to
be very high. [China and the United States have enhanced their

Structural Causes of US-China Rivalry [Accommodationists misidentify
Taiwan as the principal cause of US-China problems. Rather, the root
cause of US-China tensions lies in the anarchic structure of the
international system, not Taiwan]{.underline}. [Structural pressures
permit war to happen, and Taiwan is only one of the many issues (such as
the Korean peninsula and territorial disputes]{.underline} in the East
and South China Seas) [that could ignite a war]{.underline} between the
United States and China. It [is anarchy, the absence of a central
authority above states, that makes China and the U]{.underline}nited
[S]{.underline}tates [fear the power of each other]{.underline}. [It is
anarchy that makes them suspicious of each other's
intentions]{.underline}. It is also anarchy that [makes mutual
assurances of goodwill fall flat in each other's capital]{.underline}.
[Taiwan operates independently of this structure; **abandoning it will
not remove the structural cause of US-China tensions**]{.underline}. In
anarchy, [great powers base their strategic decisions on the
capabilities of others, not intentions]{.underline}. In an anarchic
world in which each state can hurt one another, great powers will
compete for power to become substantially stronger than the others. The
ideal situation is to become the hegemon in one's own region.29 The
United States accomplished this feat in the Western Hemisphere through a
series of determined pursuits of power in the nineteenth century.
Washington also enforced the Monroe Doctrine to exclude outside powers
from meddling in its backyard. The same strategic logic applies to
China. [As power brings security, the pursuit of power has been the top
priority of Chinese statecraft]{.underline}. [The Chinese people know
very well about the "century of humiliation" when Qing China suffered
disgraceful defeat at the hands of technologically superior European
powers]{.underline} in the nineteenth century. [The lesson is well
learned: weakness invites aggression; strength begets
security]{.underline}. Henceforth, [a recurrent theme in modern Chinese
politics is how to build a strong country that is secure from foreign
encroachment]{.underline}. Today, [the Communist Party's sloganeering
of]{.underline} the China Dream and [the "great rejuvenation of the
Chinese nation" reflects this long-held aspiration.]{.underline} [The
ideal outcome is a maximization of its power advantage over
neighbors]{.underline}, as exemplified by the "era of strength and
prosperity" (shengshi) during the Han, Tang, Ming, and Qing dynasties.
Those were the days when China was the regional hegemon and enjoyed
plentiful security. Hence, [China's strategic aims are far broader than
acquiring Taiwan]{.underline}. [If China's present military and economic
power continues to grow, it will continue on the path to becoming the
most powerful state in Asia.]{.underline} China's rise, however, is
incompatible with US dominance. [As a regional hegemon, the
U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates believes that its [security
interests will be best served by not allowing another power to dominate
Asia]{.underline} (or Europe). "The interest of the United States of
America," declared President John F. Kennedy in 1963, "is best served by
preserving and protecting a world of diversity in which no one power or
no one combination of powers can threaten the security of the United
States."30 Simply put, the United States does not want a peer
competitor. Henry Kissinger emphasizes that "it is in the American
national interest to resist the effort of any power to dominate Asia"
(emphasis original).31 Joseph S. Nye, former US Assistant Secretary of
Defense for International Security Affairs, argues that maintaining
regional stability and "deterring the rise of hegemonic forces"
constitutes the rationale for stationing American troops in East Asia.32
[There is consensus among US policymakers and commentators that it is in
the national interest to prevent any power from dominating Asia and
Europe. Washington should maintain a regional balance of power to
preserve US preeminence in international affairs]{.underline}.
Apparently, the two structural factors---China's rising power and US
dominance---are not compatible. Both countries are locked in a security
dilemma in which one's moves to increase its own security will
invariably decrease the security of the other. [The security dilemma is
a product of states' uncertainty about each other's intentions under
anarchy. **It is a constant**, **not a variable**]{.underline}.
Therefore, **[accommodating China on Taiwan will not fundamentally
transform the problem of uncertainty about intentions, nor will it
moderate the security dilemma]{.underline}**. The structural
contradiction in US-China relations foretells a competitive dynamic in
the years ahead. [China's suspicions about US motives and intentions are
**structurally driven**,]{.underline} [just as US suspicions of China
are driven by the **same structural conditions**]{.underline}.
[Uncertainty about intentions is a built- in characteristic of an
anarchic system, generating the security dilemma and strategic
distrust.]{.underline} US policy toward Taiwan is tangential to the
distrust between Beijing and Washington. [Because Taiwan is not a direct
cause of US-China security competition, **abandoning Taiwan to China
will not ameliorate the security dilemma.**]{.underline} [The structural
tension remains. Aside from Taiwan, other issues could also ignite a
conflict, such as flare-ups in the Korean peninsula, the South China
Sea, or the East China Sea]{.underline}. It is worth noting that the
only war between China and the United States was the Korean War of
1950--1953. It was not fought over Taiwan.

### \-\-- XT: Realism True 

#### States are guided by offensive realism -- best historical evidence proves policies guided by accommodation will fail

Although most [accommodationists]{.underline} do not explicitly ground
their [argument]{.underline} in international relations theory, their
proposal [parallels]{.underline} [defensive realism]{.underline}.17
Defensive realism takes an optimistic view about the effects of anarchy,
arguing that the structure of the international system is generally
benign and does not always lead to competitive policies. In the
offense-defense balance, military technology and geography often favor
the defense. Security is thus plentiful.18 The best means for states to
be secure is to maintain the status quo. States should not attempt to
maximize relative power because it would trigger counterbalancing.
Defensive realists argue that states can convey reliable information
about their motives through costly signaling and policy choices. Both
China and the United States are secure because they enjoy "defensive
advantage" created by nuclear weapons and geographical separation. As
Glaser argues, "China's rise need not be nearly as competitive and
dangerous...because the structural forces driving major powers into
conflict will be relatively weak."19 The dangers come from secondary
disputes such as Taiwan. [A US accommodation on Taiwan would indicate US
benign motives toward China]{.underline}. If China reciprocates, such as
on the South China Sea or other issues, it would convey information
about the limited extent of China's foreign policy aims. China could
thus rise peacefully, a view that is in stark contrast to offensive
realism.20 [As a theory, defensive realism is]{.underline} an
intellectual cousin of [**idealism**. It describes how the world
**should work** instead of **how the world actually
works.**]{.underline} As Glaser makes clear, defensive realism "analyzes
the strategies a state should choose" (emphasis original) to achieve
their goals and as such, "it is a prescriptive, normative theory."21
[The problem with normative theory such as defensive realism is that
**it does not have much explanatory power**]{.underline}, as John
Mearsheimer points out.22 [The historical record is often at odds with
defensive realism, with great powers having behaved in ways that
contradict the theory]{.underline}. Defensive realism often attempts to
explain away these anomalies by incorporating non-structural variables
such as domestic politics or misperception into their theory.23 Like
idealism, [the policy prescriptions of defensive realism may appear
desirable, but they are **politically infeasible**]{.underline}.24
**[Their proposals provide little guidance to realistic policy
making.]{.underline}** In this article, I draw on [offensive
realism]{.underline} to [highlight the dangers of accommodating China on
Taiwan]{.underline}.25 Unlike defensive realism, [offensive realism
argues]{.underline} that [the structure of the international system
drives states to compete for power.]{.underline} [To be secure, major
states will maximize relative power until they have dominated the
system]{.underline}. [Great powers seek to establish hegemony in their
region, while preventing rival powers from dominating another
region]{.underline}. The offense-defense balance emphasized by
[defensive realism offers little guidance]{.underline} to international
politics [because it is inherently difficult both to distinguish defense
from offense and to operationalize the concept]{.underline}.26 States
cannot reliably convey their motives or intentions to others. [The
intentions of states are difficult to know, and even if known, present
intentions can still change in the future.]{.underline}27 [Because
states face uncertainty about the intentions of others under anarchy,
the security dilemma cannot be moderated]{.underline}. As Mearsheimer
points out, "little can be done to ameliorate the security dilemma as
long as states operate in anarchy."28 [Adopting offensive realism as the
theoretical baseline reveals the flaws of accommodationist arguments
favored by defensive realists]{.underline}.

Recalibrating US-Taiwan Relations Both Taipei and Washington share a
common interest in deterring China from using force in the Taiwan
Strait. As China continues to rise in power, we can expect US-China
security competition to intensify. [If Washington wishes to maintain its
preeminent position in Asia, it is in US strategic interest to include
Taiwan in its overall Asia strategy]{.underline}, along with Japan,
South Korea, and other allies. Given Taiwan's strategic value, the
changing international structure will likely push [Washington and
Taipei]{.underline} into closer defense cooperation. The [security
interests]{.underline} of both countries [are compatible. It makes good
strategic sense for the U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates [to
help strengthen Taiwan's defense capabilities to deter a Chinese attack.
Strong US-Taiwan security ties **ameliorate the power asymmetry** across
the Taiwan Strait and **increase the costs of China's military
coercion**.]{.underline} Accommodationists argue that US arms sales to
Taiwan are an unnecessary provocation to China. **[Ending arms
sales]{.underline}**, however, **[would be risky and
dangerous]{.underline}**. [A weakly defended Taiwan could tempt the
Chinese leadership to use the implied threat of force to coerce the
island into negotiations for unification. Once this process is started,
it would be politically difficult for the U]{.underline}nited
[S]{.underline}tates [to stay on the sidelines and watch a democracy
being incorporated into an authoritarian state under
duress]{.underline}. For their part, [the Chinese leaders would find it
difficult to back down without losing domestic legitimacy]{.underline}.
**[A spiral of escalation would generate perilous security dynamics and
threaten regional peace.]{.underline}** [Conversely, a well-defended
Taiwan would reduce this source of dangerous miscalculation, which,
counterintuitively, is also in China's interest]{.underline}.56 Thus,
[contrary to accommodationist argument, **US arms sales to Taiwan
strengthen regional stability**]{.underline}. A basic requirement for
effective deterrence in the Taiwan Strait is that [Taiwan should at
least have the capabilities to withstand an initial Chinese attack until
the U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates [has sufficient time to
respond]{.underline}. The arms sales not only fulfill a legal obligation
under the Taiwan Relations Act but also serve US strategic interests.
The \$1.4 billion [arms sales approved by]{.underline} the
[Trump]{.underline} administration in June 2017 [are consistent with the
US policy to support Taiwan to maintain a sufficient self-defense. A
robust defense makes Taiwan less vulnerable to China's military coercion
and helps preserve regional peace. China is opposed to US arms sales for
the simple reason that a militarily weak Taiwan would be more compliant
to Beijing's demands. China has continued its military buildup across
the Taiwan Strait to shift the military balance of power further in its
favor,]{.underline} despite evident improvements in cross-Strait
relations during Taiwan's Ma Ying-Jeou administration (2008--2016).
China has made significant advances in military hardware, demonstrated
its anti-satellite capabilities, continued development and deployment of
short- and medium-range conventional ballistic missiles, and upgraded
its A2/AD capabilities. In the Taiwan Strait, [the Chinese military aims
to raise the risks and costs of US intervention to deter Washington from
coming to Taiwan's rescue.]{.underline}

#### Ending arms sales spurs Chinese shift from deterrence to compellence -- Taiwan will refuse to bend, causing a China-Taiwan shooting war and US draw-in

WHY ENDING US ARMS SALES TO TAIWAN COULD BE DESTABILIZING How would a
reduced US security commitment to Taiwan affect the likelihood of
cross-Strait conflict? More concretely, what would happen if the United
States were to terminate arms sales to the island? Remember that in our
simple model conflict occurs if Taiwan claims a level of sovereign
status to the left of point R on the I-U continuum. How, then, might an
end to arms sales affect the probability that Taiwan's claimed status
would lie to the left of point R? Here, we begin by considering the most
intuitive, direct ways that changing levels of arms sales to Taiwan
could affect the parameters of the model and the associated
implications. In the following subsection, we consider more indirect and
nonintuitive effects of ending arms sales, which in turn serve to
qualify points made in this subsection. Intuitively, it would seem that
US arms sales to Taiwan directly affect both the costs (cc) that China
would expect to pay in a cross-Strait military conflict and the
probability (p) that China would win such a conflict. On the margins at
least, [arms sales]{.underline} should [improve Taiwan's military
capabilities relative to those of the PRC,]{.underline} thereby reducing
p and increasing cc. Of course, p and cc are determined not simply by
the balance of power between China and Taiwan but also by likely US
behavior in the event of a cross-Strait war: [US
intervention]{.underline} would at a minimum [greatly complicate the
PRC's ability to prevail in a cross-Strait war and would certainly
increase China's expected costs of such a conflict]{.underline}. Thus a
higher likelihood of US intervention implies a smaller p and a larger
cc. [Arms sales to Taiwan]{.underline}, in turn, may
[signal]{.underline} some level of [US commitment to the island. To the
extent that arms sales to Taiwan do in fact increase confidence in
Beijing and Taipei that the U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates [is
likely to intervene in a cross-Strait conflict, continued US arms sales
to Taiwan imply a smaller]{.underline} p \[[probability China would
win\] and larger]{.underline} cc \[[costs that China would pay in a
cross-Strait military conflict]{.underline}\] than would be the case in
the counterfactual world where the United States did not sell weapons to
Taiwan. [These direct effects suggest]{.underline}, then, [that ending
arms sales should reduce China's expected costs of war and increase the
probability of PRC victory]{.underline}; R, in turn, should shift to the
right. This makes intuitive sense: to the extent that the balance of
power in the Taiwan Strait favors the PRC, [we might expect Beijing to
be more demanding on sovereignty issues]{.underline} (and less tolerant
of outcomes that diverge sharply from its ideal point of unification).
Were R to shift to the right of Taiwan's actual status, **[the model
suggests that the PRC would prefer to fight a war rather than to accept
a continuation of that status quo]{.underline}**; military conflict
would ensue if Taiwan failed to accommodate this new reality by
redefining its sovereign status (i.e., to push the status quo back to
the right of R). Given the obviously high costs of war for
Taiwan---costs that would presumably be especially high in the absence
of any US security commitment to the island---leaders in Taipei would
have strong incentives to avoid this outcome by bowing to new power
realities and accommodating the PRC on sovereignty issues to some
degree. Yet there are some reasons to think that accommodation in this
regard would be difficult. Recall that in recent decades the primary
strategic challenge in cross-Strait relations can be characterized as a
problem of deterrence, with the PRC trying to deter Taiwan efforts to
redefine its sovereign status in a way that conflicts with PRC hopes for
unification. But if R were to shift right of the status quo, the model
suggests that the cross-Strait relationship would instead be
characterized by a problem of compellence. Here, **[a war could
occur]{.underline}**, not because the PRC fails to deter unilateral
Taiwan changes to the status quo, but rather **[because the PRC fails to
compel Taiwan to alter the status quo in a way that is more to Beijing's
liking]{.underline}** (remember that once R shifts right of the status
quo, Beijing's expected war payoff exceeds its utility for a
continuation of the status quo). Nevertheless, commitment problems could
complicate the search for a peaceful accommodation even if Taiwan
recognized that R had moved to the right of the status quo and even if
Taiwan was in principle willing to bargain away some of its
sovereignty.17 The reason is that the issue being bargained over,
Taiwan's sovereign status, could affect future bargaining power between
the two sides: that is, bargaining some of its sovereign status to avoid
war in the short term could further diminish Taiwan's future bargaining
power vis-à-vis Beijing. [Even if the U]{.underline}nited
[S]{.underline}tates were to [stop selling arms to Taiwan and renounce
any security commitment to the island, Taiwan would remain qualitatively
different from areas under direct PRC control. It would continue to be
self-governing and democratic]{.underline}, it would continue to
[maintain armed forces, and]{.underline} it would---for all intents and
purposes---[continue to resemble an independent country]{.underline} on
all dimensions except international legal recognition. [But Taiwan's
continued otherness in this regard opens the door to possible US
intervention in a cross-Strait conflict even after a US decision to end
its security commitment to Taiwan]{.underline}. Leaders in Washington,
for instance, might revise their view of the PRC, especially in the
aftermath of an attack on Taiwan, and particularly if renouncing the
security commitment entailed a quid pro quo PRC pledge. Thus, [even
after the U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates [ended arms sales to
Taiwan and renounced a security commitment to the island, **the
probability of US intervention in a cross-Strait conflict would not drop
to zero**]{.underline}---in contrast to the likelihood of US
intervention in other areas of China such as Tibet (or, for that matter,
Hong Kong). But the more Taiwan accommodated PRC demands by allowing
itself to become something more resembling Hong Kong or Tibet than an
independent country, then the more the probability of US intervention
would begin to approach zero as it does for other areas under direct PRC
control. Such intervention would increasingly, and unambiguously,
represent intervention in a civil, rather than an international,
conflict.18 Thus any bargain involving a reduction in Taiwan's
sovereignty should independently reduce Beijing's expected costs of war,
thus pushing R even further to the right. The credibility of Beijing's
commitment to such a bargain would therefore be suspect, as once it was
implemented Beijing would have incentives to demand an even more
favorable bargain (and Taiwan would not be in a position where it could
refuse). Fearon develops a similar model where states bargain over
strategic territory and the outcome of the negotiations explicitly
shifts the balance of power.19 This change in the balance of power
happens because the outcome of the negotiation transfers territory to a
rival state and thereby improves that rival's fighting capacity. When
this type of dynamic is at work, reaching a settlement becomes difficult
because the consequence of the shift in power caused by a settlement may
be less desirable than fighting and forgoing any negotiations. Although
a hypothetical bargain between the PRC and Taiwan is not over strategic
territory, it is certainly possible that a similar dynamic is at work as
the PRC and Taiwan negotiate over Taiwan's sovereignty. Inasmuch as
giving up sovereignty to the PRC strengthens the PRC's bargaining
leverage, [Taiwan may come to the conclusion that risking war is
preferable to any negotiated settlement with the PRC over
unification.]{.underline} In other words, [Taiwan may conclude that it
would be better to roll the dice in a war with China today than to
accept the terms of an obsolescing bargain likely to result in a
progressively more subordinate status within a unified
China]{.underline}. Therefore, in the same way that bargaining over
strategic territory is complicated by the strategic consequences of any
deal that might be struck, bargaining over unification can be dangerous
because it has implications for the future bargaining power of the PRC
and Taiwan. In summary, [ending arms sales to Taiwan would have the
potential to increase instability in the Taiwan Strait]{.underline}.
[Such a shift in US policy could alter the balance of power in the
Taiwan Strait, which]{.underline} in turn [could shift the strategic
dynamic from **deterrence** to **compellence**]{.underline}. In turn,
there are reasons to believe that [a China-Taiwan relationship in which
China tried to compel steps toward unification would be **more conflict
prone** than one where the PRC tried to deter Taiwan steps toward
independence,]{.underline} as credible commitment problems could make it
difficult for Taiwan to accommodate new power realities.

### \-\-- XT: Impact -- Heg 

#### Abandoning Taiwan locks-in Chinese hegemony and displaces US influence 

**Rehman 14** \-\-- PhD in Political Science from Sciences Po in Paris,
France (Iskaner, fellow at the Center for Strategic and Budgetary
Assessments in Washington D.C., "Why Taiwan Matters," 2-28,
<https://nationalinterest.org/commentary/why-taiwan-matters-9971>)

[Abandoning Taiwan might considerably enhance China's]{.underline}
military and geostrategic [position in Asia, and severely
weaken]{.underline} that of [the U]{.underline}nited
[S]{.underline}tates [and its allies. Proponents of
abandonment]{.underline} also tend to [overlook the considerable
geostrategic significance of Taiwan]{.underline}. Famously termed "the
cork in the bottle" of the South China Sea by Admiral Ernest King, and
dubbed an "unsinkable aircraft carrier" by General Douglas MacArthur,
[Taiwan occupies an enviable position at the heart of maritime
Asia]{.underline}, with the Luzon strait to its south, the East China
Sea to its north, and the Philippine Sea to its East. As U.S. Naval War
College professors James Holmes and Toshi Yoshihara have documented,
[Chinese strategists are well aware of Taiwan's rarefied strategic
location]{.underline}, and frequently refer to the island as the
"Gibraltar of the East," and as **[a future "springboard to the
Pacific."]{.underline}** [Authoritative Chinese writings such as The
Science of Military Strategy posit that,]{.underline}

[If Taiwan should be alienated from the mainland,]{.underline} China
will forever be locked to the west side of the first chain of islands in
the West Pacific, and...[the essential strategic space for China's
rejuvenation will be lost.]{.underline}

[China clearly]{.underline}, therefore, [views Taiwan as a highly
valuable **geostrategic asset**]{.underline}, rather than merely as an
unresolved territorial issue---[and for good reason]{.underline}.
Indeed, [if China were to occupy Taiwan, Chinese naval and air forces
could finally break out of the psychological and geographic barrier
formed by]{.underline} what Chinese naval strategists commonly refer to
as "[the first island chain."]{.underline} Moreover, [China would be
able to directly threaten Japan's southwestern approaches,
and]{.underline} potentially [sever its air and sea lines of
communication]{.underline}. After winning control over the Taiwanese
islet of Itu Aba in the South China Sea, which forms the largest island
in the Spratlys, [the PLA would]{.underline} also [be in a position to
exert stronger pressure on smaller littoral states throughout maritime
Southeast Asia.]{.underline} [Chinese submarines stationed
at]{.underline} the [Taiwan]{.underline}ese deep-water bases at Hualien
and Su Auo [would enjoy unfettered access to deep Pacific waters, both
expanding their operational reach and rendering them more difficult to
detect and prosecute in the event of conflict]{.underline}. U.S. forces
might then find themselves wrestling with a similar challenge to that
faced by the Royal Navy following the fall of France in World War II.
Indeed, in the summer of 1940, German U-boats, which had previously been
primarily confined to the North Sea and English Channel, were berthed in
newly acquired deep-sea ports along the French Atlantic coastline. [From
these new bases along the Bay of Biscay, they could rapidly disperse
into the deeper waters of the Atlantic Ocean, enabling them to pose a
far greater threat to allied shipping]{.underline}. [Chinese occupation
of radar sites on Taiwan's mountaintops would]{.underline} also [allow
the PLA to monitor and target American and Japanese naval
deployments]{.underline} with greater ease. More importantly, notes one
observer, "The Taiwan Strait would become an inland waterway," allowing
China to interdict the heavy flow of container traffic that transits
through the strait on a daily basis. Thus, in many ways, [a Chinese
occupation of Taiwan would amount to nothing less than **a tectonic
shift in the geostrategic balance of power** in Asia,]{.underline} much
as a successful Ottoman absorption of the isle of Malta would have
transformed the entire equilibrium of forces in the Mediterranean of the
sixteenth century. [A "post-Taiwan" PRC would find its geostrategic
position in Asia greatly strengthened, that of the U.S. and its allies
considerably weakened, and would be at far greater liberty to coerce its
neighbors]{.underline}. Moreover, [history suggests that sudden
territorial gains frequently foster desire amongst nationalistic elites
for further expansion]{.underline}, particularly if the state in
question harbors concerns over the security of its extended periphery or
over its future vulnerability to economic disruption. As China's
resource penuries and dependence on seaborne energy imports continue to
grow, this is an important element to keep in consideration. In this
light, [the continued lack of resolution over Taiwan has]{.underline},
in effect, [been **largely beneficial**,]{.underline} rather than
detrimental, [**to American grand strategy** in Asia by focusing the
PLA's strategic attention]{.underline}, thus [diverting it
from]{.underline} potentially [more ambitious undertakings
overseas]{.underline}. [If China gained control over Taiwan, the nature
of its military competition with the U]{.underline}nited
[S]{.underline}tates [would undoubtedly change, and take on a more
global character.]{.underline} After having spent several decades
focusing primarily on antiaccess and area denial, [the PLA would now be
able to invest more intensely in air and naval assets better suited for
power projection]{.underline}. As Robert D. Kaplan notes,

[If China succeeds in]{.underline}, in effect, [consolidating Taiwan,
not only will its navy be in an advantageous strategic position
vis-à-vis the first island chain, but \[\...\] its national energies
\[\...\] will be just as dramatically freed up to look outward in terms
of power projection, to a degree that has so far been
impossible.]{.underline}

Still, on balance, [the U.S. has been a positive force in the
world,]{.underline} especially for a unipolar power. Certainly, [it's
hard to imagine]{.underline} many [other countries acting as benignly if
they possessed the amount of relative power America had]{.underline} at
the end of the Cold War. Indeed, the British were not nearly as powerful
as the U.S. in the 19th Century and they incorporated most of the globe
in their colonial empire. [Even when it had to contend with another
superpower, Russia occupied half a continent by brutally suppressing its
populace]{.underline}. Had the U.S. collapsed and the Soviet Union
emerged as the Cold War victor, Western Europe would likely be speaking
Russian by now. [It's difficult to imagine China defending a rule-based,
open international order if it were a unipolar power, much less making
an]{.underline} [effort to]{.underline} [uphold a minimum level of human
rights]{.underline} in the world. Regardless of your opinion on U.S.
global leadership over the last two decades, however, [there is good
reason to fear its relative decline]{.underline} compared with China and
other emerging nations. To begin with, [hegemonic transition periods
have historically been the most destabilizing eras in
history]{.underline}. This is not only because of the malign intentions
of the rising and established power(s). Even if all the parties have
benign, peaceful intentions, [the rise of new global powers necessitates
revisions to the "rules of the road]{.underline}." [This is]{.underline}
nearly [impossible]{.underline} [to]{.underline} [do in]{.underline} any
organized fashion [given the anarchic nature of the international
system]{.underline}, where there is no central authority that can govern
interactions between states. [We are already starting to see the
potential dangers of hegemonic transition]{.underline} periods in the
Asia-Pacific (and arguably the Middle East). [As China
grows]{.underline} more economically and militarily powerful, [it
has]{.underline} unsurprisingly [sought to expand its]{.underline}
[influence in East Asia. This]{.underline} necessarily [has to come at
the expense of other powers]{.underline}, which so far has primarily
meant the U.S., Japan, Vietnam and the Philippines. Naturally, [these
powers have sought to resist Chinese encroachments]{.underline} on their
territory and influence, [and the situation grows more
tense]{.underline} with each passing day. Should China eventually emerge
as a global power, or should nations in other regions enjoy a similar
rise as Kenny suggests, this situation will play itself out elsewhere in
the years and decades ahead. [All of this highlights some of the
advantages of a unipolar system]{.underline}. Namely, [although the U.S.
has asserted military force quite frequently i]{.underline}n the
post-Cold War era, [it has only fought weak powers]{.underline} and thus
its wars have been fairly limited in terms of the number of casualties
involved. At the same time, [America's preponderance of power has
prevented a great power war,]{.underline} [and]{.underline} even
[restrained]{.underline} [major regional powers from coming to
blows]{.underline}. For instance, [the past 25 years haven't seen any
conflicts on par with the Israeli-Arab or Iran-Iraq wars of the Cold
War]{.underline}. [As the unipolar era comes to a close]{.underline},
[the possibility of great power conflict and especially major regional
wars rises dramatically]{.underline}. [The world will]{.underline} also
[have to contend with conventionally inferior powers like Japan
acquiring nuclear weapons]{.underline} to protect their interests
against their newly empowered rivals. But [even if the transitions
caused by China's]{.underline} and potentially other nations' rises [are
managed successfully, there are still likely]{.underline} [to be
significant negative effects on international relations]{.underline}. In
today's "globalized" world, [it is commonly asserted that many of the
defining challenges]{.underline} of our era [can only be solved through
multilateral cooperation]{.underline}. [Examples]{.underline} of this
[include climate change, health pandemics, organized crime and
terrorism, global financial crises, and the proliferation of weapons of
mass destruction, among many others]{.underline}. [A unipolar
system]{.underline}, for all its limitations, [is uniquely suited for
organizing effective global action on these transnational
issues]{.underline}. This is because there is a clear global leader who
can take the initiative and, to some degree, compel others to fall in
line. In addition, [the unipole's preponderance]{.underline} of power
[lessens the intensity of competition among the global players
involved]{.underline}. Thus, while there are no shortages of complaints
about the limitations of global governance today, there is no question
that global governance has been many times more effective in the last 25
years than it was during the Cold War. [The rise of China]{.underline}
[and]{.underline} potentially other powers [will create a new bipolar
or]{.underline} [multipolar order]{.underline}. This, in turn, will make
solving these transnational issues much more difficult. Despite the
optimistic rhetoric that emanates from official U.S.-China meetings, the
reality is that Sino-American competition is likely to overshadow an
increasing number of global issues in the years ahead. If other
countries like India, Turkey, and Brazil also become significant global
powers, this will only further dampen the prospects for effective global
governance.

Another [dubious assumption is that removing the Taiwan issue from
U.S.-China relations would clear the way for a vastly improved bilateral
relationship. It is true that Taiwan is the greatest single irritant in
U.S.-China relations]{.underline}, that U.S. support for Taiwan
reinforces Chinese suspicions of an American "containment" strategy, and
that the cross-Strait war scenario is a major rationale for China's
military modernization and buildup. [But neither U.S.-China relations
nor Chinese regional behavior would improve much, if at all, as a result
of a U.S. sellout of Taiwan. The Chinese would still have many other
reasons to believe the U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates [is
trying to keep China from rising, such as the U.S. alliances, increased
American security cooperation with other governments in the region, and

more to further the American agenda on issues such as the North

[since Chinese policy follows Chinese self-interests]{.underline}. [Most
importantly, Taiwan is not the source of China-U.S.
friction]{.underline}. [The two main Asia-Pacific powers are engaged in
a rivalry for regional leadership and, even more fundamentally, in a
struggle between two competing models for conducting international
relations]{.underline}: one based on modern international laws and
norms, and the other based on a return to the Sinocentric sphere of
influence that prevailed for much of history. [Rather than satisfying
and pacifying Beijing, a U.S. concession regarding Taiwan might embolden
Chinese demands for more concessions aimed at further weakening
America's strategic position in the Asia-Pacific region.]{.underline}

Although Trump entered office predicting he would improve relations with
Moscow, lawmakers of both parties continue to accuse Russia of
interference in U.S. elections and various other crimes. Sanctions
remain in place and may well expand. Neither Trump's praise nor
congressional punishment has persuaded Russia to change course. The same
goes for China. Trump will doubtless win some concessions from Xi,
perhaps expanded access for U.S. companies to the Chinese marketplace,
agreements on currency management, more Chinese purchases of American
soybeans and promises in principle to address other U.S. demands. [What
Trump cannot do is persuade Xi to overhaul China's broader economic
model]{.underline}. [The Chinese state will continue to subsidize

also limits to what Trump can offer to get that deal with Xi. If he

national security, [he'll get pushback from Congress.]{.underline} If he

U.S.-China relations have been rocky recently, owing primarily to
tensions in the South China Sea, China's new law governing foreign
non-governmental organizations, and friction over membership in China's
Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank and the U.S.-led Trans-Pacific
Partnership (TPP). In addition to these issues, Chinese and American

#### Arms sales don't impede cooperation -- China's all talk 

**Tiezzi 15** (Shannon, Editor-in-Chief at The Diplomat, former research
associate at the U.S.-China Policy Foundation, received her A.M. from
Harvard University and her B.A. from The College of William and Mary,

<https://thediplomat.com/2015/12/on-taiwan-arms-sales-chinas-bark-may-be-worse-than-its-bite/>)

So [we have two threatened response from China to]{.underline} the
latest [arms sale to Taiwan: sanctioning]{.underline} the [U.S.
firms]{.underline} involved [and scaling back military relations.
Neither of these threats are new]{.underline} -- so let's take a look at
how Beijing has delivered on its warnings in the past. The first arms
sale to Taiwan authorized by the Obama administration came in January
2010. Worth \$6.4 billion, the deal included 113 PAC-3 missile defense
missiles and 60 Black Hawk helicopters. China's response was more robust
than normal -- perhaps, as James Mann suggested in his book The
Obamians, because Beijing believed it had a shot at ending U.S. arms
sales to Taiwan once and for all under Barack Obama. Regardless, a
Chinese vice foreign minister summoned then-U.S. Ambassador to China Jon
Huntsman to issue a protest. Most relevant for today's context, Beijing
also threatened to sanction the U.S. companies involved in the sale, and
to cut off military exchanges with the United States. So [what became of
those threats? In the short-term, China did seriously curtail military
relations]{.underline}, shutting down military dialogues and exchanges
for almost all of 2010. The most noticeable effect was Beijing denying
then-Secretary of Defense Robert Gates permission to visit China after
the Shangri-La Dialogue in Singapore. That led Gates to publicly
chastise China in his speech at the Dialogue for breaking off military
relations "over something that is, quite frankly, old news."
[Eventually, U.S.-China relations warmed again]{.underline} (thanks in
part to the desire of both sides to make Hu Jintao's state visit to the
United States in 2011 a success) and Gates got to visit China in January
2011. Interestingly, [the promised sanctions against U.S.
firms]{.underline} (which, as is the case today, were always a vague
concept) [never came.]{.underline} That may be in part because two of
the firms involved in the 2010 sale -- Boeing and General Electric --
have major commercial interests in China. Actually following through on
sanctioning these companies would have been a serious escalation in an
already-tense relationship. In September 2011, the United States
announced a \$5.9 billion upgrade package for Taiwan's F-16A/B fighter
jets, to a fairly muted reaction from Beijing. Once again, a vice
foreign minister (this time Zhang Zhijun) summoned the U.S. ambassador
(then Gary Locke) to lodge a protest. Zhang warned the sale would
"inevitably" take a toll on the overall relationship, especially
military ties. Yet, [even though one Chinese military officer urged
China to "take revenge"]{.underline} in an article for the People's
Daily[, Beijing didn't take major steps to retaliate]{.underline} for
the sale. A few U.S.-China military contacts were postponed, but nothing
on the scale of 2010's break. Part of that, however, may have been
related to timing -- **[Beijing was unwilling to create a huge issue in
U.S.-China relations]{.underline}** only a few months before a heavily
anticipated tour of the United States by then president-in-waiting Xi
Jinping. Xi's February 2012 visit to the U.S. was seen as a display of
his foreign policy prowess ahead of his actually assuming China's top
leadership roles; Beijing needed the visit to go off smoothly.
Meanwhile, Taiwanese President Ma Ying-jeou, who had spearheaded a
warming of cross-strait relations during his first term, faced
reelection in January 2012. China's leadership may have decided to cut
Ma a break by not lashing out over the arms sale, in the hopes he would
win reelection (and he did). So, with that background, what should we
make of this week's reaction from Beijing? First, it's interesting that
China summoned the U.S. charge d'affaires, rather than Ambassador Max
Baucus himself, to lodge its protest -- that suggests a more moderate
response. Military relations will likely suffer in the short term, but
given the intense work both sides have put into institutionalizing those
ties since 2011, [a serious break]{.underline} a la 2010 [would be a
huge blow, and likely farther than Beijing wants to go for]{.underline}
the smallest [Taiwan arms sale]{.underline} yet of the Obama
administration. The proposed sanctions on U.S. companies are
interesting, as it provides a new lever for Beijing to pull when
responding to these arms sales. And despite what many observers dismiss
as pro forma responses from China, it should be noted that U.S. arms
sales to Taiwan remain the top issue of concern listed by Chinese
military officials when discussing the relationship. But [Beijing has
made the sanctions threat before and not followed through]{.underline}
-- much as the Obama administration has yet to follow through on its
threat to sanction Chinese companies profiting from cyber espionage. The
threat alone remains a useful policy tool, and Beijing may again decide
that warnings -- rather than action -- are enough.

### 1NC Relations -- Noko Defense 

#### No Korea war---expanded arsenals aren't unique

**Glaser 17**---Associate Director of Foreign Policy Studies at the Cato
Institute (John, "Calm Down About North Korea's Nukes," 3-7,
<http://www.defenseone.com/ideas/2017/03/calm-down-about-north-koreas-nukes/135934/>,
#thankyoudml)

On Monday, [North Korea once again test-launched ballistic missiles,
**feeding fears** about the erratic regime's progress on nuclear weapons
and what it might mean for regional security. But Americans and their
Asian allies have **good reason** to **calm their reflexive panic** over
this issue]{.underline}. Pyongyang's nuclear weapons program is widely
considered to be the most pressing international security issue today.
The regime has carried out five nuclear tests since 2006 and has vowed
to develop an intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM) that can deliver
a nuclear warhead to U.S. soil. A senior, if unnamed, Trump
administration official told reporters recently that the president
believes the "greatest immediate threat" to the U.S. is North Korea and
its nuclear program. Last week on CNN, Senator John McCain described it
as an "immediate danger," and brought up the prospect of preventive
military action because "they don't think like us" --- meaning that the
North Korean regime is not necessarily averse, the way other countries
are, to using nuclear weapons. [To some observers, the fact that North
Korea is trying to become a full-fledged nuclear power is **evidence
enough** of its aggressive intentions. Failing to somehow block
Pyongyang's path to the bomb, they argue, **risks nuclear war** with an
unstable, irrational, paranoid totalitarian state. But **scholarship
counsels** that we **keep a cool head**. **Few experts** go so far as to
suggest that Pyongyang would **initiate nuclear war**]{.underline} with
South Korea or the United States. [The North Korean regime would have to
be **eager to commit national suicide**, since such an act of aggression
would trigger a retaliatory response that would **promise its total
destruction**]{.underline}. Despite McCain's suggestion, [North Korea is
**just as deterred** by nuclear retaliation as was **the Soviet Union**,
or **Mao's China**. There is another argument]{.underline}, however,
[which says that while North Korea is unlikely to start a nuclear war,
its burgeoning nuclear arsenal will ultimately allow it to **coerce**
and **bully other countries**.]{.underline} This argument also holds
that nukes can enable states to act more aggressively at the
conventional level, since they know others will be deterred from full
retaliation. But [that **turns out not to be true**]{.underline}. In a
new book, political scientists Todd S. Sechser and Matthew Fuhrmann
argue that [nuclear coercion **doesn't really work**. They analyze
**multiple data sets** of **hundreds of historical examples** and find
that nuclear states **don't have more leverage** in settling territorial
disputes, they **don't initiate military challenges more often**, they
are **not more likely to escalate ongoing conflicts**, and they are
**not more likely to successfully blackmail adversaries**]{.underline}.
In short, [nuclear weapons **don't give states more coercive ability**.
**Recent history** with North Korea seems to **bear this
out**]{.underline}. In 2013, Pyongyang made a serious attempt at nuclear
coercion. Following its third nuclear test, in February of that year,
the Kim Jong Un regime threatened to bomb South Korea and the United
States with "lighter and smaller nukes." In response, the UN Security
Council imposed additional economic sanctions on North Korea, which
elicited an even bolder threat: the North unilaterally voided the 1953
armistice and threatened to "exercise the right to a pre-emptive nuclear
attack to destroy the strongholds of the aggressors." Presumably, these
[threats were aimed at making the menace of Pyongyang's nukes more
credible]{.underline} and at coercing the international community to
lift the devastating economic sanctions. [It **didn't work**. No one
found the threats credible, harsher sanctions were imposed, and joint
U.S.-South Korean military exercises proceeded apace]{.underline}.

#### North Korean nukes are inevitable

**Lankov, 17**---Professor at Kookmin University in Seoul (Andrei, "Why
Nothing Can Really Be Done about North Korea's Nuclear Program," Asia
Policy, Number 23, January 2017, #thankyoudml)

To prevent such an outcome, [North Korean decision-makers are not only
remarkably careful but also remarkably ruthless in their political
planning. They care about regime survival above all, treating all other
considerations as secondary. This is applicable to economic
growth]{.underline}, which in the majority of modern countries has
become the paramount factor in determining state strategy. That is not
to say that the North Korean elites \[End Page 105\] do not need
[economic growth]{.underline}---they do, of course. However, this issue
[is secondary to their supreme goal of state survival. This
prioritization of survival determines the regime's attitude to the
outside world]{.underline}. The regime has no ideological attachment to
any foreign state. Even though official propaganda continues to
reference socialism, [North Korean leaders are state-oriented
pragmatists]{.underline} who know perfectly well that Soviet-style
centrally planned economies do not work. They are willing and eager to
play neighboring states against one another to maximize gains. [This is
bad news for foreign diplomats since this worldview means that there is
very little chance for success in either the hard-line or soft-line
approach to the North Korean nuclear issue. The North Korean hereditary
elites will be remarkably indifferent to the promises of economic
benefits and remarkably tough and uncompromising when faced with outside
economic pressure and international sanctions. They do not trust the
benefits gained from denuclearization to be worth the tremendous
security risks, and they believe that giving into what they see as
foreign blackmail will merely invite more blackmail.]{.underline}
Unfortunately, [such attitudes have been reinforced by recent
experiences]{.underline}. Top [North Korean families
remember]{.underline} quite well [that]{.underline} Muammar [Gaddafi was
the only strongman in the modern world who agreed to surrender his
nuclear weapons program in exchange for promises of economic benefits.
The sorry fate of the Libyan dictator and many of his supporters serves
as a timely reminder of why his decision]{.underline}, once widely
eulogized by the foreign media, [was not that beneficial]{.underline}
after all. [The]{.underline} 1994 Budapest Memorandum on Security
Assurances ([Budapest Protocol]{.underline}) [has also served as a
warning against excessive belief in so-called security
guarantees]{.underline}. The Budapest Protocol provided Ukraine with
guarantees of its territorial integrity in exchange for the country
ridding itself of the nuclear weapons it inherited from the collapse of
the Soviet Union. As we know, these guarantees of security and
territorial integrity---provided by the Russian Federation, the United
States, and the United Kingdom---were of no help whatsoever when the
Crimean Peninsula was taken by Russia. [These]{.underline} two
[incidents]{.underline}, as well as the U.S. invasion of Iraq, [drove
home what the North Korean leaders have believed for decades---that
international obligations, treaties, guarantees, and written promises
are seldom worth the paper they are written on if not supported by
force]{.underline}. At the end of the day, [only might and power matter.
For an impoverished country such as North Korea, nuclear arms are the
only affordable kind of military might]{.underline}---ideally combined
with reliable delivery systems capable of striking the territories \[End
Page 106\] of all major powers, the United States above all. This
attitude was well-encapsulated in North Korea's reaction to Gaddafi's
fall. On March 22, 2011, the Korean Central News Agency quoted a
spokesperson for the North Korean Foreign Ministry who stated the
following: The present Libyan crisis teaches the international community
a serious lesson. It was fully exposed before the world that "Libya's
nuclear dismantlement" much touted by the U.S. in the past turned out to
be a mode of aggression whereby the latter coaxed the former with such
sweet words as "guarantee of security" and "improvement of relations" to
disarm itself and then swallowed it up by force. It proved once again
the truth of history that peace can be preserved only when one builds up
one's own strength as long as high-handed and arbitrary practices go on
in the world.5 [It is]{.underline} therefore quite [naive to expect that
promises of better trade conditions and economic benefits will in any
way make the North Korean government compromise on what it sees as a
basic condition of its survival]{.underline}. After all, [dead,
overthrown, or imprisoned leaders are not that interested in receiving
economic benefits]{.underline}.

[North Korea's missiles are still highly questionable]{.underline}, in
terms of reliability. Though North Korea has nukes, [they are really
quite small and most are not even as powerful as the Hiroshima
bomb]{.underline}. It is not clear that the North Koreans have been able
to design a nuke small enough to put on the tip of their missiles. [The
best North Korean missiles currently can barely reach the US West
Coast,]{.underline} but future missiles will have longer range. It is
likely, based on past tests, that [25% of North Korea's missiles would
malfunction and fail.]{.underline} At most, the North Koreans will have
a dozen missiles within the next few years, [compared to the US's 4,000
missiles with much larger payloads. The United States, South Korea and
Japan all have limited anti ballistic missile defense systems that would
surely shoot most if not all of them down in a full attack]{.underline}.
These systems are pretty good at regional or theater defense, they just
can't shoot down a large number of simultaneous incoming missiles. Even
if the North launched a dozen missiles and 10 of them worked, we would
probably shoot down at least 8 of them. The remaining 2 might hit their
targets and would cause extensive damage. That would be horrible. [But
the US would respond back and eliminate the North's capability to do
that again. It is very unlikely that China would get involved and North
Korea has no other allies, so there is virtually no chance of a wider
escalation]{.underline}. So, as you can see, the only real chance of any
sort of a nuclear war involving North Korea would result in a [small
exchange that was not likely to escalate]{.underline} and [would be
utter suicide for North Korea, so they are very unlikely to do
it.]{.underline}

For one, **[the most dangerous diseases are those that spread from one

then **[the population drops, and it becomes]{.underline}** **[less

naturally resistant or altogether immune to HIV, either because of their
CCR5 allele or their MHC Class I type. And there are a handful of people
who were infected with defective versions of HIV that didn\'t progress
to disease. ¶ We can see indications of this sort of thing happening in
the past, because our genomes contain **[many]{.underline}** instances
of **[pathogen resistance genes]{.underline}** that
**[have]{.underline}** **[spread through the whole
population.]{.underline}** **[Those]{.underline}** all started off as
