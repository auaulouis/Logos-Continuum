#### Plan: The United States Federal Government should reduce its sale of the Aegis Ashore ballistic missile defense system to Japan.

### Scenario 1- Strategic Stability

#### Increasingly advanced BMDs undermine Russian and Chinese deterrence and lead to regional instability

extending the frontiers of the Japan--US alliance," International
Affairs, <https://academic.oup.com/ia/article/94/4/755/5039998>)

[The prospect of significant power aggregation deriving from Japan--US
defence-industrial and military-operational integration in missile
defence is neither uncontroversial nor unproblematic. Missile defence
has attracted]{.underline} scholarly and diplomatic [criticism for
undermining the strategic balance between the Great Powers
and]{.underline} thus for [destabilizing international security. [China
and Russia]{.mark}]{.underline}, in particular, [[invoke failing
strategic stability in their]{.mark} vehement [opposition to US-led
missile defence efforts]{.mark}]{.underline}, whether
[[through]{.underline}]{.mark} NATO on Eurasia\'s Atlantic flank or
through [[Japan--US]{.underline}]{.mark} and US--South Korean
[[collaborations]{.mark} on its Pacific flank]{.underline}.60 In the
light of currently deployed missile defence systems, which fail to meet
the technical specifications for defence against strategic ballistic
missiles and whose inventories are far from sufficient to absorb
saturation attacks by shorter-range ballistic and cruise missiles,
Russian and Chinese concerns appear overstated, if not unwarranted.
However, notwithstanding its official rationale, [current [R&D in
missile defence]{.mark}, including rail guns and directed energy
weapons, offers the potential to [reduce]{.mark} allied [vulnerability
to strategic ballistic missiles]{.mark} and saturation missile attacks,
thereby [eroding Chinese and Russian deterrence]{.mark} vis-à-vis Japan
and the United States, [and]{.mark} thus [destabilizing relations
between the most influential actors in international
security]{.mark}]{.underline}. Further defence-industrial and
military-operational integration in missile defence hinges on the two
allies' willingness to accept the political and, potentially, strategic
costs of their power-aggregating efforts

#### Aegis Ashore is uniquely destabilizing due to offensive potential and information sharing with the U.S.

To this end, [[Japan]{.mark}]{.underline} has deployed two BMD systems,
the ground-based Patriot (PAC-3) and the maritime Aegis SM-3 IIA, and
[[is]{.mark} further [negotiating procurement of]{.mark}]{.underline}
two other systems from the USA -- THAAD and [[Aegis
Ashore]{.underline}]{.mark} (Weitz 2013; JIJI 2014). All of the above
mentioned BMD systems are of U.S. origin. The currently deployed
systems, PAC-3 and Aegis, provide for a relatively effective protection
against ballistic missiles, as the two systems together act as a
multi-tier defense system, a BMD system capable of destroying incoming
missiles at different altitudes -- outside and inside the Earth's
atmosphere (Ministry of Defense 2012: 187). The decision to deploy BMD
systems was made following the 1998 overflight of the North Korean
Taepodong missile over Japan. Prior to the Taepodong test, only few
domestic actors advocated for BMD system development and deployment,
most notably the Japanese Defense Agency (Oros 2008: 155). While North
Korean threat was the immediate impetus that persuaded a broader set of
policymakers to become involved with BMD systems, China has featured
prominently in the Japanese BMD discourse. On one hand, the Chinese
missile program is also identified as a threat. However, when making the
decision to collaborate with the USA on BMD development, special
attention was paid to the Chinese perception of any BMD undertakings of
Japan (Oros 2008: 160). It has been previously stated that Japanese
strategic culture rests on the following three basic tenets: (1) Japan
will not possess traditional military; (2) no use of force except in
self-defense; and (3) no participation in foreign conflicts (Oros 2014:
233). The shifts in security policy, which allowed Japan to work on the
development of BMD systems and later to deploy them, are in line with
the three tenets of the 'anti- militarist' strategic culture (Oros 2008:
149). Nevertheless, points were raised that the joint development of BMD
systems with the USA is in breach of Article 9 of the Constitution of
Japan. This issue was resolved when the Cabinet Legislation Bureau, the
office in charge of preparing new legislative proposals and making sure
they would pass the tests of constitutionality, has found that the
integration of BMD systems with the USA is not unconstitutional (Oros
2014: 237--238; Oros 2015: 153). Furthermore, legislative changes had to
be made to the arms export legislation which allowed for joint
production and technology transfers when it came to BMD development with
the USA (Oros 2014: 239). 17 [What makes the Japanese BMD systems
problematic for other regional actors, especially China, is the fact
that [with]{.mark} the [modern BMD]{.mark} systems [there is a thin line
between]{.mark} the purely [defensive]{.mark} nature of the systems [and
offensive capabilities.]{.mark} It has been demonstrated that, [by
making alterations to the SM-3 interceptor,]{.mark} the [Aegis]{.mark}
BMD system [has offensive potential]{.mark}. This allows it [to target
satellites]{.mark}, thus [making it an anti- satellite]{.mark} (A-SAT)
[weapon]{.mark}]{.underline}. 7 The offensive capabilities of Aegis are
not a given parameter, though. Converting Aegis from a defensive BMD
system into an offensive A-SAT system requires additional action on the
part of the system's operator (alteration of the SM-3 interceptor
missile). Looking back at the basic tenets of the Japanese strategic
culture, Japan is very unlikely to take such an action. [The [Japanese
cooperation with the]{.mark} [US]{.mark}A [is]{.mark} [another
concern]{.mark} that needs to be addressed]{.underline}. It has already
been mentioned that Japan had to reevaluate its arms export restrictions
in order to make the cooperation with USA possible. However, the USA has
played a much larger role in the Japanese BMD policy. The USA has been
exerting pressure on Japan to participate on BMD development ever since
the Reagan administration, when Japan was pushed to participate in
research, as part of the Strategic Defense Initiative (Oros 2008: 158).
[The decision to adopt U.S. systems, especially Aegis, has raised
questions regarding the prohibition of the exercise of collective
self-defense]{.underline}. The Japanese government has reiterated that
any BMD system will be used only for the purpose of protecting Japan,
will be operated on Japan's independent judgment, and that it will not
be used for defense of third parties (Chief Cabinet Secretary 2003).
Nevertheless, [[effective operation of]{.mark} the [Aegis]{.mark} system
[requires]{.mark} cooperation and [information sharing]{.mark} between
the Maritime Self-Defense Forces [and]{.mark} U.S. Navy. This [raises
doubts about the]{.mark} actual [independence of]{.mark} the [Japanese
BMD systems]{.mark} from its U.S. ally.]{.underline}

#### China won't undertake aggressive nuclear modernization absent Aegis Ashore -- they'll do the bare minimum necessary to maintain strategic stability 

**Chase 13** (Michael S. Chase, U.S. Naval War College Warfare Analysis
and Research Associate Professor, "China\'s Transition to a More
Credible Nuclear Deterrent: Implications and Challenges for the United
States," Asia Policy, Project Muse)

Shen Dingli of Fudan University argues that [[China's nuclear strategy
is "a type of minimum deterrence]{.underline}]{.mark}," one that is
"[commensurate with its NFU doctrine]{.underline}." 40 Shen highlights
what he characterizes as the uniqueness of China's approach to nuclear
deterrence among the acknowledged nuclear-weapon states, which he
attributes in large part to its status as the only permanent member of
the UN Security Council that adheres to an NFU policy. [Because its
policy and strategy are [limited to preparing for nuclear
retaliation]{.mark}, China needs fewer nuclear weapons]{.underline} than
the other major nuclear powers. [It]{.underline} also [does not need the
highly accurate strike capabilities required to launch a disarming first
strike against another nuclear power]{.underline}. In Shen's words,
"[for minimum deterrence, one only needs to assure a credible nuclear
retaliation so as to deter a first nuclear attack.]{.underline}" 41
Similarly, according to Teng Jianqun of the China Institute of
International Studies, [[China seeks to maintain a "minimum credible
deterrence]{.mark}" [capability]{.mark} by ensuring that the PLA has the
capability to retaliate following a nuclear attack.]{.underline} Teng
argues that China's current nuclear modernization should be seen in this
context. In his words, "[[the purpose of \[China's\] current nuclear
modernization is]{.mark} first and foremost [to guarantee the]{.mark}
security and [reliability of nuclear weapons in the face of]{.mark}
threats, such as the [U.S. development and deployment of ballistic
missile defenses]{.mark}]{.underline}." 42 Sun Xiangli, deputy director
of the Arms Control Research Division at the Institute of Applied
Physics and Computational Mathematics in Beijing, has asserted that
China's nuclear strategy should be referred to as "defensive nuclear
deterrence characterized by the policy of NFU." In reaching this
conclusion, Sun argues that [enduring beliefs about the nature and
purpose of nuclear weapons have influenced China's strategic calculus
and served as a framework for the development of Chinese nuclear
forces]{.underline}. 43 [[Chinese leaders]{.underline}]{.mark} and
scientists [have [see]{.mark}n [nuclear weapons as]{.mark} basically
[useful for]{.mark} political reasons and [strategic deterrence]{.mark},
rather than as having real tactical or operational utility on the
battlefield. They have generally believed that the threshold for the
infliction of unacceptable damage is significantly lower than Western
strategists]{.underline} have often [claim]{.underline}ed. 44 Sun writes
that "based on these principles, and according to its economic,
technical and geographic conditions, [China has developed a limited
nuclear force]{.underline}." 45 At the same time, he argues that even
though China has felt that it only needs a relatively limited number of
nuclear weapons, "these [weapons must have a deterrent effect, and a
certain number and survival of the nuclear weapons must be
guaranteed]{.underline}." Sun explains, "In short[, the key to having a
credible nuclear deterrence is to guarantee an effective nuclear
retaliatory capability]{.underline}." 46 [What is required to do
so]{.underline}, however, [is subject to change over time]{.underline}:
in other words, Sun believes that [the number of nuclear weapons China
needs is not "immutably fixed" but is related to challenges to the
survivability of the force and its ability to penetrate enemy
defense]{.underline}s. Accordingly, [[an appropriate rule for
determining the size of China's nuclear force is that it must "be able
to mount a nuclear strike that can penetrate an enemy's missile defense
system after surviving a first strike.]{.underline}]{.mark}" Along
similar lines, Chu Shulong and Rong Yu of Tsinghua University have
described China's nuclear strategy as one of "dynamic minimum
deterrence." 49 They argue that this strategy retains key features of
the PRC's traditional approach while adjusting it to keep pace with
changes in the security environment and emerging threats. According to
Chu and Rong, "China has all along adhered to a strategy that may be
labeled as minimum deterrence. However, as circumstances are always
changing, the content, quantity, quality, and structure of minimum
deterrence also must change." 50 The approach is not tied to a specific
number of nuclear weapons but rather to the capability required to deter
powerful countries like the United States an d Russia. In short, Chu and
Rong assert that "the Chinese understanding and practice of the strategy
of minimum deterrence is dynamic---its features are continually adjusted
to meet the changing strategic environment and threat

#### Aegis Ashore escalates tensions between China and the U.S.--Japan alliance -- China perceives it as Japanese remilitarization and a threat to their second strike capabilities.

**Panda 18** (Ankit Panda, The Diplomat Senior editor specializing in
the Asia-Pacific region, "Will Japan\'s Aegis Ashore Radar Choice Elicit
China\'s Wrath," The Diplomat,
<https://search-proquest-com.dartmouth.idm.oclc.org/docview/2070751498?accountid=10422&rfr_id=info%3Axri%2Fsid%3Aprimo>)

Earlier this month[, reports citing sources within the Japanese Ministry
of Defense indicated that [Japan's deployment of]{.mark} the [Aegis
Ashore]{.mark} missile defense system [will be built around a]{.mark}
variant of Lockheed Martin's]{.underline} still-in-development [[Long
Range Discrimination Radar]{.mark} (LRDR), instead of the Raytheon SPY-6
radar]{.underline}. While details of the precise LRDR variant Japan will
use are unknown, it is likely that the radar will feature reduced range.
In any case, the full-fledged LRDR, as described by Lt. Gen. Samuel A.
Greaves, the director of the U.S. Missile Defense Agency, in testimony
earlier this year is a "midcourse sensor that will provide persistent
long-range midcourse discrimination, precision tracking, and hit
assessment and improve BMDS target discrimination capability while
supporting a more efficient utilization of the GMD interceptor
inventory." Setting aside the suitability of LRDR for Japan's midcourse
interception needs for a moment, [it bears interrogating whether [the
selection]{.mark} of [LRDR might emerge as a new thorn in Sino-Japanese
relations]{.mark}.]{.underline} As I explained last year, [China's
over-the-top reaction by U.S. Forces Korea to deploy a Terminal High
Altitude Area Defense battery in South Korea had to do primarily with
the the advanced, high resolution AN/TPY-2 radar accompanying the
launchers---not the launchers themselves]{.underline}. Similarly, [even
if the LRDR variant deployed by Japan is drastically different from the
GMD-supporting primary version in development for the United States,
it's far from clear that China will let that pass.]{.underline} (Beijing
declined U.S. invitations for technical talks over THAAD in 2016.) [The
idea behind Chinese opposition to advanced missile defense sensors in
Northeast Asia is simple: [China fears]{.mark} that [U.S.]{.mark}
efforts to establish [theater-wide missile defense sensors could
erode]{.mark} [the efficacy of the country's]{.mark} relatively [lean
strategic deterrent]{.mark}]{.underline}[.]{.mark} In specific terms,
Beijing was concerned that the United States could operate the AN/TPY-2
radar, now located in South Korea's Seongju county, in forward-based
mode. The United States, meanwhile, has claimed that the radar will
operate exclusively in terminal mode, which allows the THAAD system to
serve a defensive role against prospective ballistic missile threats
from North Korea. Not only is LRDR being designed with support for the
United States' Ground-Based Midcourse Defense (GMD) system in mind,
[the]{.underline} U.S. National Security Strategy ([NSS]{.underline})
published earlier this year [emphasized U.S. intentions to "cooperate on
missile defense with Japan and South Korea to move toward an area
defense capability." That's not the same thing as homeland missile
defense, but, along [with]{.mark} a prospective [LRDR deployment in
Japan, Beijing will have reason for concern]{.mark}.]{.underline} (The
NSS does also note that "enhanced missile defense is not intended to
undermine strategic stability or disrupt longstanding strategic
relationships with Russia or China," though the administration's
upcoming Missile Defense Review may tweak that view[.) Should Tokyo give
Beijing assurances that its LRDR will be discrete from the U.S. homeland
missile defense sensor networks, it's unlikely that China would take
this for granted---China cast aside similar assurances on the AN/TPY-2
deployed in South Korea]{.underline}. For the moment, China has not
chosen to treat reports of Japan's selection of LRDR in the same way
that it dealt with the THAAD deployment in South Korea. Part of the
reason for this might be that the Japanese Ministry of Defense has yet
to confirm the decision on-the-record, or, more realistically, that
Japan's deployment of Aegis Ashore remains years away in 2023. Tokyo and
Beijing are currently undergoing a broader diplomatic thaw anyway and it
may not be in China's interest to rock the boat over a deployment that
is far from proximate. Either way, the few Chinese official statements
that have addressed the Japanese Aegis Ashore deployment decision have
been careful not to overtly condemn Tokyo. Last August, following
U.S.-Japan military-to-military talks on Aegis Ashore deployment
acceleration, the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs issued a
cautionary note, but stopped short of condemning Japan. "The Chinese
government always maintains that the missile defense issue should be
handled cautiously as it bears on global strategic stability and the
mutual trust between major countries," [spokesperson Hua
Chunying]{.underline} added at the time. "While taking into account
their own security interests, all relevant parties should respect the
legitimate security concerns of other countries, jointly follow the
principles of upholding global strategic stability and undiminished
security for all countries and safeguard the international security
environment featuring peace, stability, equality, mutual trust,
cooperation and win-win outcomes," she added. In December, when Japan's
decision to select Aegis Ashore over THAAD was announcement, Hua
[was]{.underline} more [pointed in her criticism]{.underline}, [tying
Tokyo's procurement decision to historical tensions in East Asia. "[Due
to]{.mark} what happened in [history, Japan's moves in]{.mark} the
fields of [military and security are always followed closely by
its]{.mark} Asian [neighbors]{.mark} and the international
community]{.underline}." She continued: "[[When it comes to the
anti-missile issue, the Chinese]{.mark} [governmen]{.mark}t]{.underline}
always [[believes]{.mark} that [it bears on the global strategic
stability and]{.mark} the [mutual trust between
countries]{.mark}.]{.underline} It bears noting, however, that we have
yet to see anything from China coming close to the high-level critical
rhetoric that South Korea saw when in exploratory talks over the
deployment of THAAD on its territory. As the United States and South
Korea debated the merits of deployment, none other than Chinese Foreign
Minister Wang Yi felt it necessary, as early as February 2016, to
emphasize that "the monitoring scope of \[THAAD's AN/TPY-2\] X-Band
radar, goes far beyond the defense need of the Korean Peninsula." The
official Chinese reaction was specific. [[Tokyo may find itself
facing]{.underline}]{.mark} similar [[Chinese concerns as 2023
approaches]{.mark} and more specifics emerge about its Aegis Ashore
deployment plans. In the meantime, China is no doubt going to keep a
close eye on Japan's choices and evolving U.S.-Japan cooperation on
ballistic missile defense.]{.underline}

#### Aegis Ashore's advanced missile defense capabilities wreck Chinese deterrence - spurs nuclear modernization and expansion

**Zhang 15** (Dr. Baohui Zhang, Linghan University Political Science
Professor and Asian Pacific Studies Director, *China\'s Assertive
Nuclear Posture: State Security in an Anarchic International Order*,
2015, pp. 103-4)

[[China's]{.mark} recent [efforts to modernize and expand]{.mark} its
[offensive nuclear capabilities are rooted in the rise
of]{.mark}]{.underline} the [[US]{.mark} [defensive systems that]{.mark}
could seriously [compromise Chinese nuclear
deterrence]{.mark}]{.underline}. US missile defense, which includes both
ground-based midcourse defense system (GMD) and various theater-
oriented missile defense (TMD) systems, is widely seen by Chinese
military experts as a fundamental threat to its strategic deterrence.
Until recently, the Chinese military tended to believe that US missile
defense could not effectively deter major nuclear powers such as China
and Russia. However, [[due to the]{.mark} steady [maturing of a
multilayered]{.mark} US [missile defense,]{.mark} Chinese [nuclear
experts are losing confidence in China's offensive
capabilities]{.mark}]{.underline}[.]{.mark} This pessimism is best shown
in an important 2008 interview of Wang Wenchao in a Chinese military
magazine. As identified by the magazine, Wang is [the chief designer of
China's sea-based strategic missiles]{.underline}. In this interview,
Wang [expressed grave pessimism about the ability of Chinese nuclear
forces to penetrate US missile defense]{.underline}. As he stated, "I
have done a research: facing a multi-tiered missile defense system, if
any single layer can achieve a success rate of 70%, then 100 single
warhead missiles could all be intercepted even if they are mounting a
simultaneous attack." 24 Therefore, Yao Yunzhu, a PLA nuclear strategist
at the Academy of Military Sciences, suggests that US missile defense
has had a profound impact on China's nuclear deterrence. As she points
out, "missile defense has made China increasingly worried about the
credibility of its deterrence against the United States. \... Among the
many influences on Chinese nuclear thinking, the development and
deployment of missile defense is the most important one. [[China
must]{.mark} consider how to [maintain a credible second strike
capability against US missile defense]{.mark}]{.underline}." 25 [Wu
[Chunsi]{.mark}, a civilian expert on nuclear deterrence, [emphasizes
the impact of]{.mark} US [missile defense on China's no-first-use
doctrin]{.mark}e]{.underline}. She argues that [[missile defense
makes]{.mark} the doctrine increasingly [difficult to maintain because
it gives the US]{.mark}A [a double advantage in offensive first-strike
capability and]{.mark} a [credible defensive
capability.]{.mark}]{.underline} As she observes: China's No First Use
constrains its ability to counter American missile defense systems.
Assuming a war between the two countries, [[China]{.mark}, limited by
its No First Use policy]{.underline}, obviously [[could not launch a
first strike]{.mark} against the United States]{.underline}. On the
other hand, [the limited number of [Chinese nuclear missiles
would]{.mark} definitely [become targets for American preemptive
strikes]{.mark}.]{.underline} Given the US ability to attack hard
targets, [[how many of China's]{.mark} intercontinental [missiles could
survive a first strike and then manage to penetrate]{.mark} American
[missile defense system]{.mark}s?]{.underline} This obviously is an
important issue for the Chinese strategic community to consider. 26
Recently, [Chinese strategists have been focusing on the threat posed by
a sea-based theater missile defense]{.underline} (TMD)
[system]{.underline}. This system, [based on Aegis equipped
warships]{.underline}, is already becoming operational and is being
deployed very [close to China]{.underline}. A Chinese military magazine
organized a symposium to examine the impact of US sea-based missile
defense on China's nuclear deterrence. One article claims that [this
sea-based capability will "forwardly extend US anti-missile deployment
and compromise deterrence effectiveness by our strategic nuclear
forces]{.underline}." 27 Analysts believe that [[if Chinese strategic
missiles were launched]{.mark} from the first layer of inland
provinces]{.underline} such as Henan and Jilin, [where China's nuclear
forces are rumored to be deployed, US [TMD]{.mark}]{.underline} in the
Pacific [[could intercept these missiles]{.underline}]{.mark} during the
boost phase of the flight, when the missile speed is relatively slow.
Further, these [[American warships could serve as an early warning for
missile defense]{.underline}]{.mark} in North America, [[improving the
probability of]{.underline}]{.mark} eventual [[successful
interception]{.mark} of Chinese nuclear missiles]{.underline}. The
latest PLA assessments believe that US missile defense will achieve
significant progress toward combat effectiveness by 2030. According to
Li Fang and Yang Zhu, two PLA analysts, by then the US mid-course
interception system will "possess full and complete combat
capabilities." In the meantime, the US ability for boost phase
interception will also "see steady breakthroughs." Most importantly,
[the sea-based Aegis missile defense system "will possess the ability of
intercepting intercontinental ballistic missiles]{.underline}." 28 Thus,
[[US missile defense has sown the seeds for China's nuclear
expansion]{.mark}.]{.underline} Indeed, [[Chinese military
strategists]{.mark} all [recommend such a course of action]{.mark} to
maintain a credible nuclear deterrence]{.underline}. For example, Yao
Yunzhu claims that "China must evaluate the survivability and
sufficiency of its nuclear arsenal. China must also consider what kind
of nuclear capability can ensure the mutual deterrence between the two
countries." 29 Other PLA strategists are more blunt in their
recommendations. As proposed by Hou Xiaohe and Zhang Hui from the PLA
National Defense University, "[[We must]{.mark} first [massively
improve]{.mark} the development and modernization of [our strategic
weapons, increase the accuracy and penetration ability of our]{.mark}
medium and long range [missiles]{.mark} to allow our lance to pierce the
shield of missile defense, and thereby restore strategic nuclear balance
between China and the United States]{.underline}." 30 More specifically,
[Hou and Zhang suggest that [China needs to "develop nuclear
missiles]{.mark} equipped [with multiple warheads to overwhelm the US
defensive system]{.mark}."]{.underline}

[China is the only nuclear weapon state recognized by the
Nonproliferation Treaty that is actively expanding its nuclear
arsenal.]{.underline} Its nuclear forces have increased modestly from an
estimated [130 to 200
warheads](http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/00963402.2006.11460990)
in 2006 to an [estimated
170](https://www.belfercenter.org/sites/default/files/legacy/files/ChinaNuclearModernization-hzhang.pdf)
to [260
today](http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/00963402.2016.1194054).
The [qualitative
changes](http://carnegieendowment.org/2015/04/01/china-s-offensive-missile-forces-pub-59613)
to its nuclear forces have been more significant, with the introduction
of more mobile solid-fueled missiles, multiple independently targetable
reentry vehicles (MIRVs), and [an emerging fleet of nuclear-powered
ballistic missile submarines
(SSBNs](http://ndupress.ndu.edu/Media/News/Article/1013472/chinas-future-ssbn-command-and-control-structure/)).
[This modernization program has raised concerns]{.underline} over the
past several years [that **[China]{.mark} is currently attempting or
[might]{.mark} soon [attempt a nuclear breakout]{.mark}.** Concerns of a
Chinese breakout come in two forms: [either]{.mark} that [Beijing will
develop a nuclear warfighting capability that could neutralize U.S.
conventional superiority, or]{.mark} that Beijing [will expand its
strategic arsenal to achieve parity with the U]{.mark}nited
[S]{.mark}tates, [which could undercut U.S. security commitments
to]{.mark} its [regional allies]{.mark}.]{.underline} While China is
indeed in the midst of a significant modernization effort, [the
[changes]{.mark} to its nuclear forces [do not yet represent a
fundamental strategic shift]{.mark}. Rather, **[China's nuclear
evolution appears to be driven by a desire to maintain a secure
second-strike capability]{.mark} in the face of advancing U.S.
capabilities, which Beijing believes might threaten its nuclear
deterrent.**]{.underline} As I demonstrate in a [new article in the
Nonproliferation
Review](http://tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/10736700.2017.1371406),
China's nuclear arsenal and strategy are constrained by its limited
views of the utility of nuclear weapons. Moreover, Beijing would face
several "harder" technical constraints in pursuing the kind of nuclear
breakout about which some commentators warn. Concerns of an Impending
Chinese Breakout First, some [commentators [have
argued](http://nationalinterest.org/feature/welcome-china-americas-nuclear-nightmare-11891)
that China may be currently developing a nuclear warfighting capability,
or at least the nuclear arsenal to support one]{.underline}. A nuclear
warfighting capability can refer to either a force designed to attack an
adversary's nuclear arsenal, or a nuclear force designed for use on the
battlefield, though most commentators mean the latter when referring to
China. [These [developments]{.mark}]{.underline}, they argue, [[could
lead to China introducing nuclear weapons into an otherwise conventional
conflict]{.mark}.

[observers](http://foreignpolicy.com/2013/09/03/think-again-american-nuclear-disarmament/)
have contended that [China may attempt]{.mark} a "sprint to parity," [a
rapid buildup]{.mark} in its strategic nuclear arsenal [until it has
roughly as many nuclear weapons as the]{.mark} [U]{.mark}nited
[S]{.mark}tates]{.underline} ([One

even fantastically claimed, based on an analysis of the underground
tunnel system designed to protect China's missiles, that it may already
possess more than 3,000 nuclear weapons). [This would entail a dramatic
expansion in the size of China's nuclear arsenal.]{.underline} China's
Current Nuclear Posture China's nuclear forces and policies are
constrained, first and foremost, by the country's [distinctive approach
to nuclear

As Jeffrey Lewis has written, Chinese leadership has historically
believed that nuclear deterrence is largely [unaffected by the size and
configuration of the adversary's nuclear
arsenal](https://mitpress.mit.edu/books/minimum-means-reprisal), so long
as the country can threaten a counterstrike of a few --- or even one ---
nuclear warheads. Marshall Nie Rongzhen, a leading figure in China's
early nuclear weapons program, called this "[the minimum means of
reprisal](https://mitpress.mit.edu/sites/default/files/titles/content/9780262622028_sch_0001.pdf)."
[Recent
research](http://www.mitpressjournals.org/doi/abs/10.1162/ISEC_a_00215)
by Fiona Cunningham and M. Taylor Fravel, based on reviews of Chinese
doctrinal and academic writings and interviews with Chinese military and
civilian experts, indicates that these fundamental views have not
changed and that China is likely to continue adhering to its relatively
restrained strategy of "[assured
retaliation](http://www.mitpressjournals.org/doi/abs/10.1162/ISEC_a_00016)."
In [recent Track-1.5 and Track-2
dialogues](https://calhoun.nps.edu/bitstream/handle/10945/34335/2013%20005%20US-China%20Strategic%20Dialogue%20VII%20Report-Public.pdf?sequence=1#page=12)
between the United States and China, Chinese participants have said that
China could credibly threaten the United States with only "a few," a
"handful of," or even "one" nuclear warhead. Designed to support more
limited goals, China's nuclear forces are generally believed to be
smaller and less alerted than those of other states. The country has yet
to develop [an early warning
system](https://thediplomat.com/2015/05/strategic-warning-and-chinas-nuclear-posture/)
and some experts believe China would [wait several
days](https://www.sipri.org/sites/default/files/files/books/SIPRI03Zarimpas/SIPRI03Zarimpas.pdf#page=70)
after suffering a nuclear strike before launching its own nuclear
counterattack. Observers believe Beijing does [not mate its nuclear
warheads to missiles](https://www.armscontrol.org/act/2011_03/LiBin) in
peacetime, instead [storing them
separately](https://project2049.net/documents/chinas_nuclear_warhead_storage_and_handling_system.pdf).
According to the counting rules of the New START treaty, China has
[nearly zero deployed nuclear
weapons](https://www.armscontrol.org/act/2011_03/LiBin). [China's
ongoing nuclear modernization program is indeed significantly changing
the character and configuration of the country's nuclear forces. But
these changes appear to be driven by a desire to maintain the
survivability of the country's second-strike capability, not a
fundamentally new view of nuclear weapons in Beijing. **[[China has

[d]{.mark}efen[s]{.mark}e](http://www.ucsusa.org/sites/default/files/legacy/assets/documents/nwgs/china-missile-defense.pdf)
[as serious threats to its nuclear forces]{.mark}**[.]{.mark} Regardless
of whether these concerns are reasonable, they appear sincere. By
deploying more mobile missiles, [China hopes to]{.mark} increase the
survivability of its overall deterrent. By deploying SSBNs and equipping
some of its land-based missiles with [MIRV
capability](https://thebulletin.org/what-if-china-develops-mirvs8133),
it hopes to [enhance its ability to penetrate U.S. missile
defenses]{.mark}.]{.underline} Hard Constraints In addition to these
"softer" political constraints on a Chinese nuclear breakout, China
would face several "harder" technical barriers to both developing a
nuclear warfighting capability and undertaking a sprint to parity. A
nuclear warfighting capability would require China to deploy a more
diversified nuclear force, with smaller-yield warheads affixed to more
accurate missiles. However, the country's current warhead designs,
designed for the more limited strategy of assured retaliation, are too
heavy and too powerful. During the Cold War, the average yield of U.S.
tactical weapons was [reported to be 4
kilotons](https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/politics/1978/12/11/natos-atomic-stockpile-primarily-political-weapons/9fceeb3b-3b62-484b-8f2b-26ecf0f35616/?utm_term=.9c1eba8f95d3),
and NATO war planners set an upper [limit of 10
kilotons](http://ssi.armywarcollege.edu/pdffiles/pub1103.pdf#page=69)
for bombs that could be used on their own territory. More recently, the
nuclear warhead for the U.S. Tomahawk cruise missile had a variable
yield of 5 to 150 kilotons and weighed 130 kilograms. By comparison,
China's smallest nuclear warhead is estimated to have a yield of 200 to
300 kilotons and to weigh 500 kilograms. China's [record of nuclear
weapons
testing](http://physicstoday.scitation.org/doi/full/10.1063/1.2982122)
does not give it an ideal basis for developing reliable, smaller, modern
designs. Most of China's tests involved heavy, high-yield devices.
Beijing did successfully test an [enhanced radiation
device](http://ndupress.ndu.edu/Portals/68/Documents/stratperspective/china/ChinaPerspectives-8.pdf)
in the late 1980s that could serve as the technical foundation for
tactical nuclear weapons, though it's not clear this design would be
suitable for developing a robust warfighting arsenal. Even if China were
to rely on this design, it might face production constraints stemming
from limited tritium and fissile material stockpiles. China might choose
to resume nuclear testing to develop newer warhead designs, but it would
take time and resources to design and certify new warheads, and the
international community would detect any new testing. Finally, China
generally lacks the supporting infrastructure needed to employ a nuclear
warfighting capability. Such a capability would require developing new
technical capabilities, organizational arrangements, and operational
practices, which China has generally avoided. For instance, a nuclear
warfighting capability would likely require more flexible command and
control arrangements, including delegating more authority to military
commanders, as Pakistan has done to support its ["asymmetric escalation"
strategy](http://www.mitpressjournals.org/doi/abs/10.1162/isec.2010.34.3.38).
By contrast, China has prioritized strict political control over its
nuclear weapons, keeping its [nuclear forces somewhat
insulated](http://ndupress.ndu.edu/JFQ/Joint-Force-Quarterly-83/Article/969665/pla-reforms-and-chinas-nuclear-forces/)
from its conventional ones. China would face similar constraints in
attempting a strategic sprint to parity. The most significant challenge
is its limited fissile material stockpile. China's modern warhead
designs use plutonium fuel, but analysts believe Beijing last produced
weapons-grade plutonium in 1991 and that it currently maintains a
[stockpile of only 1.8 metric
tons](http://fissilematerials.org/library/gfmr15.pdf). In addition,
China has relied on [conservative warhead
designs](http://scienceandglobalsecurity.org/archive/sgs02degeer.pdf)
that use more fuel than other countries' warheads. Given these high fuel
requirements and its limited stockpile, in a best-case scenario China
could produce no more than 250 to 450 plutonium-based warheads. China
could resort to using uranium-based designs, though it faces a limited
uranium stockpile as well. More significantly, the uranium designs it
has tested in the past were relatively unsophisticated and ill-suited
for a modern arsenal. To develop modern and reliable uranium-based
warheads, China would likely have to resort again to testing new
designs. Certainly, [**[China possesses the]{.mark}** underlying
[**economic, industrial, and technological bases** on which
**to**]{.mark} either **[develop a nuclear warfighting
capability]{.mark}** or attempt a sprint to parity.
However]{.underline}, attempting either form of nuclear breakout would
entail significant changes to China's nuclear program, possibly
including developing new warheads, resuming weapons testing, renewing
weapons-grade fissile material production, and significantly changing
operational practices. Given China's [historically conservative
approach](https://csis-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/s3fs-public/legacy_files/files/publication/111123_Jansson_NuclearScholar_web.pdf#page=174)
to its nuclear weapons program, [it appears unlikely that it could
undertake a]{.underline} military significant [nuclear
breakout]{.underline} in the near term or accomplish one in the long
term [without being detected.]{.underline} Analysts who have warned of
an impending nuclear breakout may be assuming that China's ongoing
modernization program is more expansive than it is, conflating a push
for greater survivability with a desire for "usability," or viewing the
modest quantitative growth in China's arsenal as a prelude to something
much more expansive. Certainly, China has made tremendous progress in
developing and deploying advanced ballistic missile systems, which would
be a crucial component of any nuclear warfighting capability. Indeed,
[some
observers](https://www.rand.org/content/dam/rand/pubs/research_reports/RR1600/RR1628/RAND_RR1628.pdf#page=129)
worry that the hardware and operational practices associated with the
conventional force could bleed over and end up benefitting the nuclear
force. But a broader review of the other technical requirements of
either developing a nuclear warfighting capability or pursuing strategic
parity suggests China would nonetheless face harder obstacles. Policy
Implications The constraints on China's nuclear forces have important
implications for U.S. policy. Policy decisions should rest on realistic
threat assessments of China's nuclear program and avoid provoking
self-fulfilling prophecies. Washington should recognize the constraints
on Beijing's nuclear policy and work to reinforce those constraints and
maintain strategic stability. First, [observers should watch for
indicators that China is fundamentally altering its approach to nuclear
weapons. This could include more obvious moves such as the resumption of
production of military fissile material, new rounds of nuclear weapons
testing, or a shift in political statements about the purpose of China's
nuclear weapons.]{.underline} Important indicators might also be
subtler, such as [changes in the organization and operation of the
military
organizations](http://www.npolicy.org/article.php?aid=1258&rid=2) that
operate China's nuclear weapons. Second, the United States should
attempt to strengthen and reinforce the constraints on China's program.
[Ratifying the Comprehensive Test Ban
Treaty](http://foreignpolicy.com/2016/04/22/the-united-states-needs-to-step-up-and-ratify-the-nuclear-test-ban-treaty-china/)
would strengthen the international norm against testing, while [funding
the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty
Organization](https://www.armscontrol.org/Issue-Briefs/2017-05/us-support-ctbto-enhances-us-global-security)
increases the chance of detecting tests should they occur. (Though it
would likely be more difficult to detect small-yield tests of tactical
warheads compared to the massive tests of China's past, the history of
the international monitoring system is cause for optimism. For example,
it detected North Korea's 2006 nuclear test, which had [an estimated
yield of only 0.6
kilotons](https://www.armscontrol.org/issuebriefs/CTBT-Myths-vs-Realities).)
The United States should also attempt to stem the rise of [reprocessing
in East
Asia](https://thebulletin.org/confronting-plutonium-nationalism-northeast-asia9617),
which could raise regional anxieties by lowering the barriers to some
states producing nuclear bombs. Finally, [**policymakers should
recognize that [Chinese nuclear policies are driven]{.mark}** in part
**[by perceived threats from the U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates**
itself. **Expanding** conventional prompt global strike,
**[b]{.mark}allistic [m]{.mark}issile [d]{.mark}efen[s]{.mark}e, and the

#### Nuclear war with China results in millions killed, radiation poising, and a nuclear winter. 

**Wittner 11** (Professor of History @ State University of New
York-Albany, Lawrence S. Wittner, "Is a Nuclear War with China
Possible?," Huntington News, Monday, November 28, 2011 - 18:37 pg.
http://www.huntingtonnews.net/14446)

[While nuclear weapons exist, there remains a danger that they will be
used]{.underline}. After all, for centuries national conflicts have led
to wars, with nations employing their deadliest weapons. The current
[deterioration of U.S. relations with China might end up providing us
with yet another example of this phenomenon.]{.underline}

[The gathering tension between the United States and China is
clear]{.underline} enough. [Disturbed by China's growing economic and
military strength, the U.S. government recently challenged China's
claims in the South China Sea, increased the U.S. military presence in
Australia, and deepened U.S. military ties with other nations in the
Pacific region]{.underline}. According to Secretary of State Hillary
Clinton, the United States was "asserting our own position as a Pacific
power."

But need this lead to nuclear war?

Not necessarily. And yet, there are signs that it could. After all,
bot[h the United States and China possess large numbers of nuclear
weapons.]{.underline} [The U.S.]{.underline} government th[reatened to
attack China with nuclear weapons during the Korean War
and]{.underline}, later, [during the conflict over the future of China's
offshore islands, Quemoy and Matsu.]{.underline} In the midst of the
latter confrontation, President Dwight Eisenhower declared publicly, and
chillingly, that U.S. nuclear weapons would "be used just exactly as you
would use a bullet or anything else."

Of course, China didn't have nuclear weapons then. Now that it does,
perhaps the behavior of national leaders will be more temperate. But
[the loose nuclear threats of U.S. and Soviet government officials
during the Cold War, when both nations had vast nuclear arsenals, should
convince us that, even as the military ante is raised, nuclear
saber-rattling persists.]{.underline}

Some pundits argue that nuclear weapons prevent wars between
nuclear-armed nations; and, admittedly, there haven't been very
many---at least not yet. But [the Kargil War of 1999, between
nuclear-armed India and nuclear-armed Pakistan, should convince us that
such wars can occur]{.underline}. Indeed, in that case, [the conflict
almost slipped into a nuclear war.]{.underline} Pakistan's foreign
secretary threatened that, if the war escalated, his country felt free
to use "any weapon" in its arsenal. During the conflict, Pakistan did
move nuclear weapons toward its border, while India, it is claimed,
readied its own nuclear missiles for an attack on Pakistan.

At the least, though, don't nuclear weapons deter a nuclear attack? Do
they? Obviously, NATO leaders didn't feel deterred, for, throughout the
Cold War, NATO's strategy was to respond to a Soviet conventional
military attack on Western Europe by launching a Western nuclear attack
on the nuclear-armed Soviet Union. Furthermore, if U.S. government
officials really believed that nuclear deterrence worked, they would not
have resorted to championing "Star Wars" and its modern variant,
national missile defense. Why are these vastly expensive---and probably
unworkable---military defense systems needed if other nuclear powers are
deterred from attacking by U.S. nuclear might?

Of course, the bottom line for those Americans convinced that nuclear
weapons safeguard them from a Chinese nuclear attack might be that the
U.S. nuclear arsenal is far greater than its Chinese counterpart. Today,
it is estimated that the U.S. government possesses over five thousand
nuclear warheads, while the Chinese government has a total inventory of
roughly three hundred. Moreover, only about forty of these Chinese
nuclear weapons can reach the United States. Surely the United States
would "win" any nuclear war with China.

But what would that "victory" entail? [[A nuclear attack by China would
immediately slaughter at least 10 million Americans]{.mark} in a great
storm of blast and fire, while [leaving many more dying]{.mark} horribly
[of sickness and radiation poisoning]{.mark}]{.underline}. [[The Chinese
death toll]{.mark}]{.underline} in a nuclear war [[would be far higher.
Both nations would be reduced to smoldering, radioactive
wastelands]{.mark}.]{.underline} Also, [[radioactive debris]{.mark} sent
aloft by the nuclear explosions [would blot out the sun and bring on a
"nuclear winter"]{.mark} [around the globe---destroying agriculture,
creating worldwide famine, and generating chaos and
destruction]{.mark}.]{.underline}

Moreover, [[in another decade the extent of this catastrophe would
be]{.mark} far [worse.]{.mark} The Chinese government is currently
expanding its nuclear arsenal]{.underline}, and by the year 2020 it is
expected to more than double its number of nuclear weapons that can hit
the United States. [The U.S. government, in turn, has plans to spend
hundreds of billions of dollars "modernizing" its nuclear weapons and
nuclear production facilities over the next decade]{.underline}

Block IIA), "We can provide the SM-3 Block \[II\]A ashore as an
under-layer capability for \[ground-based interceptors\]... . We can do

." Congress has recently mandated that, "if technologically feasible,"
the Block IIA missile be tested against an ICBM-range missile (US House

[The [Block IIA interceptors are intended for deployment]{.mark} on the
more than 85 Aegis ships that the US Navy plans to operate, as well as
[at]{.mark} land-based [Aegis Ashore missile defense
sites]{.mark}]{.underline}. [The interceptors, therefore, are to be
deployed in much larger numbers than the GMD interceptors -- totaling
perhaps 400 or more, based upon the premise that each Aegis BMD ship has
at least 90 vertical launcher cells that can house variety of
weapons]{.underline}. If, on average, five of these cells on each ship
housed Block IIA interceptors, the total would be 425 plus whatever
Block IIAs were deployed at Aegis Ashore sites, as Figure 2 illustrates
(Lewis 2018 Lewis, G. 2018. "Update to 'How Many SM-3 Block IIA
Interceptors?'" mostlymissiledefense blog, May 20.

[Russia, when it signed [New START]{.mark} in 2010, had nearly 50 times
more strategic nuclear ballistic missile warheads than the United States
had strategic-capable interceptors. Nevertheless, Russia stipulated that
the treaty]{.underline} (US Defense Department n.d. US Defense
Department. n.d. "New Start: Article-by-Article Analysis Unilateral

[...[may be effective]{.mark} and viable [only in conditions where there

Federation.]{.underline}

[The [US b]{.mark}allistic [m]{.mark}issile [d]{.mark}efense
[build-up]{.mark} [could]{.mark} similarly [lead China to significantly
increase the number and capabilities of its strategic ballistic
missiles]{.mark}.]{.underline} China already has been deploying
additional ICBM warheads and has begun deploying submarine-launched
ballistic missiles. [China's [development of ICBMs with multiple
warheads is]{.mark} widely viewed as, at least in part, [a response to
the US b]{.mark}allistic [m]{.mark}issile [d]{.mark}efense
[program]{.mark}.]{.underline}

[While [Russia and China]{.mark} understand the likely effectiveness of
countermeasures against the current US ballistic missile defense system,
they [harbor concerns about the US program's completely open-ended
nature]{.mark}]{.underline}. [[They]{.mark} also [are]{.mark} [concerned
that US leaders, in the belief that their defenses are effective, could
act]{.mark} more [aggressively]{.mark}]{.underline}. [In April, the
Russian Foreign Ministry issued a statement expressing concern on this
issue]{.underline} (ITAR-TASS 2018 ITAR-TASS. 2018. "US' Missile Shield

[The risk is that the availability of [a missile shield may give]{.mark}
grounds for [a]{.mark} vile [feeling of invincibility]{.mark} and
impunity [and]{.mark}, hence, [lure Washington into new dangerous
unilateral steps to achieve its goals on]{.mark} the global and regional
levels]{.underline}...

In fact, US political leaders are not being told about the vulnerability
of US ballistic missile defense systems to simple countermeasures. In
February, Gen. Lori Robinson, commander of the US Northern Command --
responsible for defending the United States against ballistic missiles
-- told Congress that she was "100 percent confident" in her ability to
defend the United States from a North Korean ballistic missile attack
(Robinson 2018 Robinson, L. 2018. "United States Northern Command and
United States Southern Command." Hearing before the Committee on Armed
Services, February 15. Stenographic Transcript.

In October 2017, President Trump, discussing the North Korean ICBM
threat, stated that "We have missiles that can knock out a missile in
the air 97 percent of the time..." (Kessler 2017 Kessler, G. 2017. "Fact

[Although China, Russia, and the United States have]{.underline}
together [experienced numerous crises]{.underline} and tensions since
the end of the Cold War, [one important reason that each state has
refrained from employing military force directly against the others is
their robust nuclear deterrents and survivable "second-strike"
capabilities---their assured ability to retaliate effectively with their
own nuclear forces even if they were attacked first]{.underline}.
Furthermore, US extended nuclear security guarantees---Washington's
promise to protect its allies against nuclear threats with nuclear
forces, if necessary---has dissuaded other potential nuclear weapons
states, namely Japan and South Korea, from pursuing their own nuclear
weapons capability. Despite doubts, these countries have continued to
place their faith in Washington's will and capacity to defend them
against North Korea and other threats. However, [[new military
technologies such as missile defenses, anti-satellite weapons]{.mark},
and hypersonic missile systems,]{.underline} could [[raise the risks of
nuclear weapons use in future crises]{.underline}]{.mark}, especially if
accompanied by certain risk-acceptant operational concepts. Ballistic
missile defense ([BMD) systems may convince their possessors that they
could launch a disarming first strike---expecting their missile shields
to protect them against any retaliatory strikes. Hypersonic delivery
systems present]{.underline} new [challenges for crisis stability due to
their rapid speed and unpredictable flight paths]{.underline}.
Furthermore, [states have incentives to use cyber weapons early in a
conflict to exploit]{.underline} any [vulnerabilities]{.underline} of
their opponent before their own can be neutralized by an enemy. [[States
may]{.underline}]{.mark} even [[consider launching their nuclear forces
before they have been attacked, such as on warning]{.mark} of an assault
[despite]{.mark} the [risks of misperception and
miscalculation]{.mark}]{.underline}. Chinese and Russian officials have
already complained about the allegedly disruptive nature of the
expanding US capabilities for missile defense, precision strikes, and
other strategic technologies. The [[strong US offensive
capabilities]{.mark}, both nuclear and conventional, [exacerbate these
concerns since they increase]{.mark} its [potential for successfully
pre-empting Chinese and Russian nuclear missiles]{.mark}]{.underline}
before they have been
launched.[^2^](https://www.hudson.org/research/11307-arms-racing-in-strategic-technologies-asia-s-new-frontier#footNote2)
Experts believe that [[the Chinese share Russian concerns about]{.mark}
"conventional counterforce" -- [US preemptive attacks using
non-nuclear]{.mark} hypersonic [weapons]{.mark} or even cruise missiles
[against the PLA's nuclear forces and]{.mark} command nodes and then
[using missile defenses to defeat a]{.mark}ny [ragged Chinese
counterstrike]{.mark}]{.underline}. Both countries are seeking to
overcome US offensive and defensive capabilities by actively researching
all these new strategic technologies for possible military application.
It is important not to exaggerate the potential for near-term
technological breakthroughs in these capabilities. By their very nature,
however, the pace and impact of these novel military weapons based on
revolutionary capabilities are hard to predict. Few existing treaties
explicitly constrain the quantitative or qualitative dimensions of these
new strategic technologies. [The best time to negotiate arms control
agreements limiting the development of potentially destabilizing systems
is before the weapons are deployed]{.underline}, but there are major
impediments to progress in this area.

#### Strategic stability collapse strongly incentivizes nuclear first strikes

**Weitz 15** (Richard Weitz, Center for Political-Military Analysis
Director, "Arms Racing in Strategic Technologies: Asia\'s New Frontier,"
Hudson Institute,
<https://www.hudson.org/research/11307-arms-racing-in-strategic-technologies-asia-s-new-frontier>)

Russian leaders have argued that US development of strategically
disruptive technologies such as hypersonic weapons, ballistic missile
defenses, and cyber weapons makes it harder for Moscow to accept more
cuts in offensive nuclear forces under any new arms control agreement.
Both Chinese and Russians fear that the expanding US strategic
capabilities threaten their capacity for assured nuclear retaliation and
thereby undermine their capacity to deter a direct US attack or
constrain US military interventions against other countries. [Though [US
BMD systems]{.mark} would have difficulty coping with a full-scale
Chinese or Russian missile strike, their [task would be much easier
following a US first strike that destroys many of the attackers'
missiles]{.mark} in their silos [and]{.mark}, through kinetic or cyber
strikes, [disrupts their strategic command-and-control
systems]{.mark}]{.underline}. In such a scenario, China or Russia might
even refrain from a retaliatory missile strike against the US homeland
since such a weak counterstrike could fail and provoke a full-scale
nuclear response. One way China and Russia can counter the risk of a US
pre-emptive strike with conventional, nuclear, or cyber weapons, and of
having their retaliatory missile strike weakened by US defenses, is to
deploy more and better missiles and nuclear warheads, making them more
capable of inflicting unacceptable damage on the United States. Yet,
[[some]{.mark} of their [responses]{.mark} can]{.underline} also [be
potentially destabilizing and [encourage first strikes, including
Russia's construction of massive liquid-fueled missiles]{.mark} that are
extremely vulnerable before launch, [its arsenal of]{.mark} potentially

### Scenario 2 -- Kuril Islands

#### Aegis Ashore decks Japan-Russia bilateral relations.

**Brown,** **18** (James D. J, associate professor in political science
at Temple University Japan and a specialist on Russo-Japanese relations,
The Case Against Aegis Ashore, Shingetsu News Agency,
http://shingetsunewsagency.com/2018/08/20/the-case-against-aegis-ashore/)

SNA (Tokyo) --- While the Abe administration presents Aegis Ashore as an
essential and relatively uncontroversial contribution to the defense of
Japan from the North Korean threat, in reality [the deployment of [this
missile defense system risks]{.mark} further [destabilizing the security
situation]{.mark} in Northeast Asia, especially [with regard to
Russia]{.mark}.]{.underline}

[In December 2017, the Japanese government formally decided to purchase
Aegis Ashore]{.underline}, the US-made ground-based ballistic missile
defense system. It is anticipated that two units will be installed, with
Akita and Yamaguchi prefectures identified as the candidate sites. [The
first of these deployments is planned to be completed during fiscal
2023.]{.underline}

The Abe administration has justified the purchase of this system as a
necessary response to the growth in the missile threat from North Korea.
Japan has two existing missile defense systems, but each has
limitations.

The first of these is the Patriot PAC-3, which can intercept incoming
missiles during their terminal phase. The units are mobile but provide
limited coverage, meaning that they can offer protection to specific
sites, such as central Tokyo or military installations, but not to the
country as a whole.

The PAC-3 system is therefore combined with Aegis-equipped destroyers,
whose interceptors can eliminate missiles during their mid-course phase.
This system can theoretically provide cover for all of Japan, but it is
dependent on keeping the Aegis-equipped ships on a continual cycle of
deployment in specific areas, something that places an enormous burden
on Japan's Maritime Self-Defense Forces.

As such, [there is an apparent logic in purchasing a third system that
can provide constant protection for all of Japanese
territory]{.underline}. Additionally[, the Aegis Ashore system has
superior capabilities and range than the existing Aegis-equipped
destroyers]{.underline}. In particular, it is claimed that it is better
at dealing with simultaneous launches as well as missiles on a lofted
trajectory, both things that North Korea has simulated in recent missile
tests.

Presented this way, it appears hard to argue with the decision to adopt
Aegis Ashore.

Yet, as time has passed, the chorus of opposition has grown louder.

Voices of Opposition

One criticism is that the introduction of the missile defense system
runs counter to the current trend of reduced tensions on the Korean
Peninsula. Indeed, some may argue that Aegis Ashore is now superfluous
following the meeting between President Donald Trump and Chairman Kim
Jong-Un in Singapore in June at which the North Korean leader agreed "to
work toward complete denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula."

This is, however, a weak argument since it is far from certain that the
North Korean commitment in Singapore was sincere. Furthermore, even if
denuclearization were to proceed smoothly, Pyongyang would still retain
a dangerous arsenal of non-nuclear missiles that are capable of reaching
Japan.

A more convincing criticism is of the cost of the system. It was always
known that Aegis Ashore would be expensive, but the extent is only now
becoming clear.

At the end of July, sources in the Ministry of Defense revealed that the
estimated cost of the two Aegis Ashore units had been revised up by
around 70%. With the inclusion of other elements, such as the
interceptor missiles, the total cost of the project is now expected to
exceed 600 billion yen (US\$5.4 billion).

This is an extraordinary spending commitment in a country where
government debt was equivalent to 253% of GDP in 2017, and where the Abe
administration pretends to be pursuing the goal of a fiscal surplus by
2025.

Separately, there are concerns within the local communities near where
the Aegis Ashore batteries are set to be located. These center on the
extent to which the presence of the missile defense units will make
their area a target for foreign military planners. Additionally, there
are worries about the health effects of the powerful, but largely
unproven, Lockheed Martin Solid State Radar that the Japanese government
has selected for use with the Aegis Ashore units.

A Destabilizing Factor in Northeast Asia

Both the expense of the system and its potential health implications are
genuine concerns, but perhaps the most serious worry about Aegis Ashore
is the destabilizing effect it could have on Northeast Asian security.
The Japanese government insists that it is a purely defensive system,
which will be under Japan's exclusive control. This is not, however, the
view of Japan's neighbors.

[Tokyo's decision to invest further in US missile defense has been
criticized by both China and North Korea. However, [the most strident
and sustained condemnation of Aegis Ashore has come from
Russia]{.mark}.]{.underline}

[Russia is the only peer of the United States when it comes to nuclear
weapons, and it has come to rely ever more on its vast strategic arsenal
since it lost the conventional superiority that the Soviet Union enjoyed
over the West in Europe]{.underline}. Moreover, [as the United States
has demonstrated its willingness to use military force internationally
since the 1990s, Russia has come to regard its nuclear capabilities as a
vital means of deterring US interventionism.]{.underline} [This has
become]{.underline} all the [more important following the recent
increase in tensions between Russia and the West, and Washington's
explicit identification of Russia as an adversary.]{.underline}

For this reason, [[Russian strategists regard US missile defense systems
as a leading threat to national security]{.underline}]{.mark}. [[From
Moscow's perspective, the U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates [is engaged in
a long-term project to undermine Russia's strategic deterrent]{.mark}
[and]{.mark} thereby [give itself a free hand to act without fear of
Russian retaliation]{.mark}.]{.underline}

[The crucial step in this regard was the decision of President George W.
Bush in 2002 to withdraw from the Anti-Ballistic Missile
Treaty]{.underline}. Signed in 1972, this agreement had barred
Washington and Moscow from deploying nationwide defenses against
strategic ballistic missiles. [The treaty's preamble described this as a
"substantial factor in curbing the race in strategic offensive
arms."]{.underline}

During the years since this withdrawal, [Moscow believes that the United
States has worked assiduously to surround Russia with elements of its
expanding missile defense system. Some of these units have been
installed within the United States itself, while others have been
planned for deployment on the territory of US allies.]{.underline}

[The Russian authorities claim that the US justifies these deployments
by using the excuse that the missile defense systems are needed to
protect allies from the threat of rogue states.]{.underline} In Europe,
Iran is the supposed threat; in East Asia, it is North Korea. In each
case, Russia believes that it is the real target.

[[Aegis Ashore is]{.mark} therefore [seen as]{.mark} just [the latest
link in the U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates' [expanding network of
missile defense systems,]{.mark} and [Moscow is dismissive of Tokyo's
claim that it will be an independent Japanese
system]{.mark}]{.underline}. This view was expressed [by Foreign
Minister Sergey Lavrov]{.underline} in January 2018, when he [told
journalists that, "We don't know any cases anywhere in this world where
the United States, having deployed its weapons systems, would hand the
control over them to a host country. I have strong doubts that they will
make an exception in this case]{.underline}."

This view will only have strengthened when [Isao Iijima,]{.underline} a
special advisor to Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, [told the media in June
that the decision to purchase Aegis Ashore was pushed upon Japan by the
United States.]{.underline}

[Prior to the final decision being taken, Russia intensively lobbied the
Abe administration not to agree to purchase further US missile defense
systems]{.underline}. This included the warning by Defense Minister
Sergei Shoigu in March 2017 that the deployment of such systems "will
destroy the balance in the Pacific region." [Having ignored these words
of caution, [Japan must expect]{.mark} some
[consequences]{.mark}.]{.underline}

[This was made clear immediately after the announcement of Japan's
decision to purchase the system when]{.underline} Russian Deputy Foreign
Minister [Sergei Ryabkov stated that Aegis Ashore will create "a new
situation, which we logically must take account of in our military
planning.]{.underline}" At the same time, [Maria Zakharova]{.underline},
chief spokeswoman for the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, [warned that [the
decision "will have a negative impact on]{.mark} the overall atmosphere
of [bilateral relations]{.mark}, including negotiations on the issue of
a peace treaty."]{.underline}

Although no explicit link has been made, [it is likely that the recent
intensification of the [Russian military presence on the]{.mark}
disputed Southern [Kuriles is connected with]{.mark} the [Aegis
Ashore]{.mark} decision]{.underline}. [In particular]{.underline}, in
January 2018, [the Russian government issued a directive which
designates the airport on the island of Iturup]{.underline} (Etorofu in
Japanese[) as dual-use.]{.underline} This opens the way for it to be
used for military jets and, sure enough[, Su-35S fighters were deployed
to the island in July.]{.underline}

Similarly[, it is possible that Russia's foot-dragging on the
implementation of joint economic activities with Japan on the disputed
islands is also a response to Aegis Ashore. This may be seen as an
effective way of punishing the Japanese government since Prime Minister
Abe has made the joint projects a prominent feature of his foreign
policy and has presented them as a stepping stone to the resolution of
the territorial dispute.]{.underline}

Causing a setback to bilateral relations with Russia might be a price
worth paying if Aegis Ashore were to radically improve Japan's security
situation. In reality, however, it will not.

No Lasting Gain in Security

Although Aegis Ashore would undoubtedly enhance the technical
capabilities of Japanese missile defense[, the system can still only
deal with a limited number of missiles and is not 100%
reliable.]{.underline} As such, just as Japan's sense of security did
not meaningfully change after the billions that were spent on PAC-3 and
the Aegis-equipped destroyers, so it will be with Aegis Ashore.

Indeed, [any small gain in security is certain to be swiftly eroded as
those [countries that feel threatened by Aegis Ashore adapt their
behavior or introduce more sophisticated weapons systems to overcome
Japan's additional layer of missile defense]{.mark}.]{.underline} In no
time at all, the military experts will be arguing that Japan needs to
spend yet more billions on some other new system that also offers no
more than a fleeting illusion of security. [In other words, [Japan
will]{.mark} simply have [contribute]{.mark}d [to an emerging arms race
and]{.mark} to [the intensification of nuclear tensions between the
U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates [and Russia]{.mark}.]{.underline}

[There is no question that Japan is genuinely facing a threatening
security environment]{.underline}. However, there is no technical fix to
this problem. Instead, lasting security can only be achieved through
diplomacy, confidence building, and mutual threat reduction.

[Ultimately, Aegis Ashore is an enormously expensive means of creating
insecurity for others while generating little added security for Japan
itself.]{.underline} There remains time for Japan to reconsider this
decision. It should do so as a matter of urgency.

by Reuters as saying following a meeting with his Russian counterpart,
Sergei Shoigu. A Japanese Ministry of Defense (MoD) [statement issued on
July
31](http://www.mod.go.jp/j/approach/exchange/nikoku/docs/2018/07/31_j-russia_2bi2.html)
reiterates that Russian military activities on the islands are
"incompatible" with "the position of Japan" and "regrettable[." [The
Japanese MoD singled out]{.mark} the [deployment of]{.mark} Russian
[military aircraft]{.mark} on the disputed islands [as a particular
source of concern.]{.mark} In March 2018, [the Russian Air Force
deployed two]{.mark} Su-35S [fighters to an

preceded by Russian Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev signing a decree
permitting the deployment of military aircraft to the civilian airport
in February 2018. Japan's Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MoFA) lodged an
official protest over the issue in the same month. [[Russia's military

[by Japan]{.mark}.]{.underline} The [Russian ministers]{.underline} once
again officially [restated their concerns over the deployment of the
Aegis Ashore ballistic missile defense systems during the two-plus-two
dialogue]{.underline} in Moscow on Tuesday. Russia is also concerned
over the stationing of additional U.S. missile defense systems to
Northeast Asia. For example, Russian President Vladimir Putin has
[repeatedly
expressed](https://thediplomat.com/2017/06/putin-russian-force-buildup-in-kuril-islands-a-response-to-us-military-actions/)
his apprehension over the deployment of the [Terminal High-Altitude Area
Defense
(THAAD)](https://thediplomat.com/2017/06/why-china-and-russia-continue-to-oppose-thaad/)
system to South Korea. As I [reported
previously](https://thediplomat.com/2015/10/putins-visit-to-japan-indefinitely-postponed/),
the Russo-Japanese dispute over the islands has been going on for many
decades: The disputed Northern territories -- known in Japanese as the
Shikotan, Kunashiri, Etorofu and the Habomai islets -- located in the
Sea of Okhotsk in the Northwest Pacific, were seized by the Soviet Union
in 1945. By 1949 the Russians had expelled all 17,000 Japanese residents
of the islands. Under the 1951 San Francisco Peace Treaty, Tokyo
renounced "all right, title and claim to the Kuril Islands"; however,
Moscow never signed the peace treaty and Tokyo refused to concede that
the four disputed islands were in fact part of the Kuril chain. Japan
has repeatedly
[rejected](http://english.hani.co.kr/arti/english_edition/e_national/701312.html)
Moscow's offer to settle the dispute with the return of the two smallest
territories of the chain, Habomai and Shikotan. [[The increasing Russian
military presence on the disputed island chain is bound to accentuate
the ongoing disagreement between Moscow and Tokyo]{.underline}]{.mark}.
The deployment of Russian military aircraft (as of now not on a
permanent basis) is just one item of a list of Japanese concerns
regarding Russian military activities on the islands. The Russian Navy
has also been considering establishing a permanent naval base for its
Pacific Fleet on one of the islands. Furthermore, the Russian MoD
announced that it [will deploy an army
division](https://thediplomat.com/2017/03/is-russias-military-deploying-10000-additional-troops-on-kuril-islands/)
there. Additionally, Russia stationed [anti-ship and missile defense
systems](https://thediplomat.com/2016/03/russia-to-deploy-missile-defense-systems-on-kuril-islands/)
on the disputed territories in 2016..

#### Heightened tensions around the Kuril Islands risk World War 3.

**Khanna, 18** (Parag Khanna, Senior Research Fellow in the Centre on
Asia and Globalisation at the Lee Kuan Yew School of Public Policy,
Avoiding World War III in Asia, National Interest,
https://nationalinterest.org/feature/avoiding-world-war-iii-asia-26313?page=0%2C2)

[[World War II still hasn't ended, yet World War III already
looms]{.mark}.]{.underline} When China and Japan agreed to normalize
relations in 1945, it was stipulated that the disputed Senkaku/Diaoyu
Islands (a string of uninhabited rocks equidistant from Japan, China and
Taiwan) would not be militarized and the dispute would be put off for
future generations. That future is here. The recent discovery of large
oil and gas reserves under the islands has heated up the situation
dramatically, with military budgets surging, and warships, coast guards
and fighter jets scrambling to assert control over the commons.

Meanwhile, tensions on the Korean Peninsula have drastically escalated
into the world's most dangerous flashpoint over the past seven decades
precisely because the Korean War itself was never formally ended in
1953. Despite the recent summit between Moon Jae-in and Kim Jong-un,
neither South nor North Korea has yet to formally recognize the other's
existence, each claiming to be the sole legitimate government of the
entire Korean Peninsula. Similarly, the unresolved status of the
princely state of Kashmir at the time of the partition of South Asia
into independent India and Pakistan in 1947 has been the direct or
proximate cause of three major wars and a near nuclear standoff in 2001
between the postcolonial cousins.

These three major Asian fault lines are a reminder that the biggest risk
of conflict in the twenty-first century stems from unsettled conflicts
of the twentieth century. [[Asia is awash in]{.mark} other
[still-disputed territories]{.mark} and boundaries [such
as]{.mark}]{.underline} Arunachal Pradesh (between India and China,
which Beijing calls "South Tibet"), the Spratly and Paracel Islands in
the South China Sea (claimed by numerous Asian countries) and [[the
southern Kuril Islands (where there is Russo-Japanese friction]{.mark},
with Tokyo calling them the "Northern Territories").]{.underline}

[[The world has been lucky that deterrence,]{.mark} economic integration
and a shared distaste for the past two centuries of Western domination
have [prevented Asia's major powers from crossing the
Rubicon]{.mark}.]{.underline} But rather than simply hope luck does not
run out, the solution to these tensions is to immediately seek permanent
settlement on peaceful terms.

[Ending interminably hot or cold wars requires a different approach to
diplomatic mediation than the ad hoc crisis management that has been the
norm in these and other conflicts.]{.underline} Indeed, there is a
significant leap from traditional mediation to outright settlement.
Mediating conflict without a settlement is like turning down the
temperature on a pressure cooker without switching it off: the food
inside will eventually burn and rot. The temperature can also be turned
back up, causing the top to eventually blow off. By contrast, settling a
conflict is like turning the stove off, removing the pressure cooker and
getting on with sharing the meal. Strategists focused on alliance
management and force posture would be well served to take a step back
and remember that military maneuvering is not an end in itself. More
fundamental than preparing for war is eliminating the need for it in the
first place.

#### US-Russia conflicts escalates to nuclear war -- extinction.

[The World is at a dangerous Crossroads.]{.underline}

[The Western military alliance is in an advanced state of readiness. And
so is Russia.]{.underline}

Russia is heralded as the "Aggressor". US-NATO military confrontation
with Russia is contemplated.

Enabling legislation in the US Senate under "The Russian Aggression
Prevention Act" (RAPA) has "set the US on a path towards direct military
conflict with Russia in Ukraine."

[[Any US-Russian war is likely to quickly escalate into a nuclear
war]{.mark}, since [neither the US nor Russia would be willing to admit
defeat, both have many]{.mark} thousands of [nuclear weapons ready for
instant use]{.mark}, and [both rely]{.mark} [upon Counterforce military
doctrine]{.mark} that tasks their military, in the event of war, to
preemptively destroy the nuclear forces of the enemy.]{.underline} (See
Steven Starr, Global Research, August 22, 2014)

The Russian Aggression Prevention Act (RAPA) is the culmination of more
than twenty years of US-NATO war preparations, which consist in the
military encirclement of both Russia and China:

[From the moment the Soviet Union collapsed in 1991, the United States
has relentlessly pursued a strategy of encircling Russia,]{.underline}
just as it has with other perceived enemies like China and Iran. It has
brought 12 countries in central Europe, all of them formerly allied with
Moscow, into the NATO alliance. US military power is now directly on
Russia's borders. (Steven Kinzer, Boston Globe, March 3, 2014, emphasis
added)

On July 24, in consultation with the Pentagon, NATO's Europe commander
General Philip Breedlove called for "stockpiling a base in Poland with
enough weapons, ammunition and other supplies to support a rapid
deployment of thousands of troops against Russia".(RT, July 24, 2014).
According to General Breedlove, NATO needs "pre-positioned supplies,
pre-positioned capabilities and a basing area ready to rapidly accept
follow-on forces":

"He plans to recommend placing supplies --- weapons, ammunition and
ration packs --- at the headquarters to enable a sudden influx of
thousands of Nato troops" (Times, August 22, 2014, emphasis added)

Breedlove's "Blitzkrieg scenario" is to be presented at NATO's summit in
Wales in early September, according to The London Times. It is a "copy
and paste" text broadly consistent with the Russian Aggression
Prevention Act (RAPA) which directs President Obama to:

"(1) implement a plan for increasing U.S. and NATO support for the armed
forces of Poland, Estonia, Lithuania, and Latvia, and other NATO
member-states; and

\(2\) direct the U.S. Permanent Representative to NATO to seek
consideration for permanently basing NATO forces in such countries."
(S.2277 --- 113th Congress (2013-2014))

More generally[, [a scenario of military escalation prevails with both
sides involved in extensive war
games]{.underline}]{.mark}[.]{.underline}

In turn, the structure of US sponsored military alliances plays a
crucial role in war planning. We are dealing with a formidable military
force involving a global alliance of 28 NATO member states. In turn, the
US as well as NATO have established beyond the "Atlantic Region" a
network of bilateral military alliances with "partner" countries
directed against Russia, China, Iran and North Korea.

#### The Kuril Island Dispute prevents repair of Japan-Russia relations. 

**Miller 2012** (J. Berkshire Miller, senior fellow with the Japan
Institute of International Affairs, Japan, Russia Should Look To Each
Other, Forbes,
https://www.forbes.com/sites/jonathanmiller/2012/09/26/japan-russia-should-look-to-each-other/#34dd3b577cca)

[[Unfortunately for those hoping for a reset in Japan-Russia relations,
there are serious obstacles that prevent their partnership from
expanding beyond its current state]{.mark}.]{.underline} The two
countries have gone to war twice in the past century. The first occasion
demonstrated to the world that Japan had arrived as a legitimate
military power with its stunning defeat of the Russian Empire in the
Russo-Japanese war of 1904-5. The second had a different result after
the Soviet Union sent the Red Army into Manchuria to claim territorial
spoils from a fatally crippled Imperial Japan at the conclusion of World
War II.

While the legacies of historical wounds often remain potent, [it is
their tangible element that complicates attempts to repair frayed
relationships]{.underline}. [This is the case with Japan and Russia as
[both states have been denied a]{.mark} cathartic [restart due to the
festering territorial dispute over the Southern Kuril
Islands]{.mark}]{.underline} (referred to as the Northern Territories in
Japan). There are positive signs, however, as the two countries work
together on several important bilateral and multilateral issues such as
nuclear non-proliferation, counterterrorism, energy security and
information technology. So while [[the Kuril
dispute]{.underline}]{.mark} has thus far not made the two strategic
rivals, it [[has smothered any chance of a]{.mark} deep and
[comprehensive partnership.]{.mark}]{.underline}

The Kurils Row

[Diplomatic and legal attempts to decipher which country is the rightful
owner of the islands are muddied by a series of historical treaties
dating back to 1855]{.underline}. Tokyo claims that the sovereignty of
the Southern Kurils has never been debatable and that the four disputed
islands (Etorofu, Kunashiri, Habomai and Shikotan) have been part of
Japan since the early 19th century. This is confirmed, according to
Japan, by the Shimoda Treaty of 1855 and the Portsmouth Treaty of 1905
at the conclusion of the Russo-Japanese war.

This all changed when the Soviet Union took over the islands following
World War II. For its part, [Russia remains unyielding to Japan's
protests that the islands be returned]{.underline} by pointing to the
Yalta Agreement (1945) and Potsdam Declaration (1945) as proof of its
sovereignty. Russia also emphasizes that the 1951 San Francisco Treaty
serves as legal evidence that Japan acknowledged Russian sovereignty
over the islands, a claim Tokyo vehemently denies.

[[Because of the Kurils dispute, Japan and Russia have yet to]{.mark}
officially [sign a peace treaty concluding World War
II.]{.mark}]{.underline} There have been several attempts to reach an
accommodation to end the row, but [both sides have thus far been unable
to overcome domestic political opposition to a compromise.]{.underline}
While signing [a [treaty]{.mark}]{.underline} would be more ceremonial
than substantial, its [[absence signals a sustained deficit of trust
that has stymied any meaningful strategic
engagement]{.underline}.]{.mark}

The Kuril Islands, showing the de facto divisi\...

There have been a range of other proposals, both formal and informal,
since the Kawana summit. Russia once offered to return the two smaller
islands to Japan (Shikotan and Habomai). Other diplomatic attempts have
proposed the return of three islands to Japan (all except Etorofu) or
the joint administration of the islands with no one state having
sovereignty. Unfortunately, none of these compromises has been able to
satiate the domestic political demands in both countries. Nationalist
sentiment in Japan remains strong over the return of all four islands
and it is politically difficult for perpetually weak governments to
propose a compromise resolution. Similarly, th[e Russian public strongly
opposes a return of the islands to Japan.]{.underline} The islands are
home to thousands of Russian citizens and remain a nationalist badge
symbolizing its victory during World War II. But public sentiment is not
the only reason. [The islands are geopolitically important to Russia and
represent a strategic gateway to East Asia]{.underline} that complements
its port in Vladivostok.

#### Russia-Japan strategic partnership prevents Central Asian smuggling -- converging interest ensures regional stability -- Kurils are the only barrier.

[[Russia and Japan]{.mark} also [share a]{.mark} common [goal of
promoting security in Central Asia]{.mark}. [International crime and
drug trafficking]{.mark} from the region [has proliferated in recent
years]{.mark}]{.underline} due to instability in Afghanistan and the
border regions of Tajikistan. [[Both sides view the illicit narcotics
trade as a serious international security concern and have discussed
ways to cooperate]{.mark} with the US [to curb the flows]{.mark}. Japan
and Russia also can exploit their partnership [through joint investment
projects in Central Asia.]{.mark}]{.underline} While this region is
still in Russia's strategic sphere, Moscow's primacy is increasingly
being challenged by China and the United States. Japan can lend its
expertise in fields such as information technology and manufacturing and
combine this with Russia's regional influence and existing capital.

Moving Past the Kurils

[A strategic partnership between Russia and Japan clearly has it
merits]{.underline}. But what are the costs and is it palatable? [[Until
the Kuril dispute is resolved, the two will be inhibited from proceeding
further]{.underline}]{.mark}. Japan's differences with China, North
Korea and -- to a lesser degree -- South Korea have presented an opening
for repairing relations with Russia. In fact[, a closer relationship
with Moscow would help improve Japan's ties with China and Korea by
demonstrating its willingness to compromise on lingering issues from the
World War II.]{.underline}

Russia would also see its geopolitical standing in Asia increase with a
strengthened relationship with Tokyo. Russia realizes that Asia is
changing and its neglected status as a Pacific power will need to be
dusted off and refurbished. This can be done with or without Japan, but
having Tokyo onside makes the transition easier and could result in a
potential economic and security windfall.

[[A strong Russo-Japanese strategic partnership
would]{.mark}]{.underline} not only [[work on multilateral security
initiatives]{.mark} such as the Six Party talks and international
narcotic flows, but]{.underline} would also work to check a growing
China. [[Both countries]{.mark} tacitly [strive for this but recognize
the political difficulties due to the Kurils row]{.mark}]{.underline}.
[[Now is the time for a grand bargain on the
Kurils]{.underline}]{.mark}. For officials in Moscow and Tokyo,
resolving the territorial dispute will not come without cost -- both
politically and economically. It will take political courage to navigate
through such thorny issues, but [[it is imperative that Japan and Russia
commit to resolving the dispute]{.mark} if they wish to assume primary
roles in charting the future strategic course of the Asia-Pacific
region.]{.underline}

#### Smuggling causes nuclear terrorism -- drug routes generate unique vulnerability 

**Henderson, 17** (Sophie Henderson, Research Analyst at RUSI within the
National Security and Resilience team., Central Asia: A
Nuclear--Terrorism Nexus?, RUSI,
https://rusi.org/commentary/central-asia-nuclear%E2%80%93terrorism-nexus)

[[Central Asia\'s increasing vulnerability to the smuggling]{.mark} [of
nuclear fissile material poses a potential threat to international
security]{.mark}]{.underline} and requires a multilateral response.

Transnational smuggling routes throughout Central Asia are not a new
problem: [[the region has served]{.mark} for centuries [as a]{.mark}
vast [transit hub for both]{.mark} legal and [illicit trade]{.mark} to
Europe and the Middle East.]{.underline}

More recently, China's new transnational [One Belt, One Road (OBOR)
strategy]{.underline}, which seeks to revive Central Asia as a nexus of
regional trade, [was linked to the facilitation of illicit trade and
transnational crime]{.underline} in a report by the UN Office on Drugs
and Crime (UNODC).

[This fear was exemplified on 7 March, when the Kyrgyz Republic arrested
several drug control officers for illegally possessing over 7 kg of
heroin. In a region where state security services actively participate
in a lucrative opiate trade out of Afghanistan, this is hardly
surprising.]{.underline}

What is less clear is the extent to which these same drug trafficking
methods and routes are being used to smuggle bomb-grade nuclear material
from former Soviet states to terrorist groups.

When ruled by the USSR, the five Central Asian states -- Kazakhstan,
Tajikistan, Kyrgyzstan, Uzbekistan and Turkmenistan -- played a key role
in developing weapons of mass destruction by producing fissile material
and using their large, sparsely populated lands for testing.

Since their independence, these states were quick to dismantle their
nuclear facilities and expatriate any inherited nuclear missiles to
Russia. By 2009, Central Asian states had signed and ratified the
Central Asian Nuclear-Weapon-Free-Zone Treaty (CANWFZ).

Although concerns were raised over the treaty's ambiguous language,
which might allow Russia to deploy nuclear weapons in Central Asia under
the premise of providing 'military assistance', all permanent members of
the UN Security Council ultimately supported the treaty.

Thus, the willingness of Central Asian governments to combat nuclear
proliferation provides an encouraging space for security cooperation
between the West and Russia. Despite the achievement of CANWFZ, however,
[[the region's lack of physical security, pervasive drug trafficking
trade and increased connectivity,]{.mark} facilitated by OBOR[, make
Central Asia vulnerable to nuclear
trafficking]{.mark}]{.underline}[.]{.mark}

[[Central Asia is]{.mark} geographically [positioned to be a transit
route between countries that possess weakly guarded fissile
material]{.mark}, especially those in the former Soviet Union, and those
that seek it, such as groups in Iraq, Afghanistan, Turkey, and
Syria.]{.underline}

[[The region is]{.mark} already [a transit route for]{.mark} a lucrative
[drug trade]{.mark}. The UNODC estimates that in 2010, drug traffickers
in the region made a net profit of \$1.4 billion from trafficking heroin
out of Afghanistan, equal to roughly a third of Tajikistan's
GDP.]{.underline}

[An estimated 200 kg of heroin and 50 kg of opium are trafficked daily
across the Tajikistan--Afghanistan border. These]{.underline} staggering
[numbers reveal the cracks in Central Asia's physical
security.]{.underline}

[Border security forces in the region often lack the funding, equipment,
and training to effectively combat trafficking]{.underline}. Inadequate
salaries also motivate many border guards to turn a blind eye to
trafficking by accepting bribes or getting involved themselves. Some
reports suggested that state officials are also involvement in the drug
trade.

[Thus, [the success of Central Asia's drug trade indicates]{.mark} that
[there are routes through which nuclear material can be smuggled]{.mark}
and that [the ability or willingness of some states to police them is
minimal.]{.mark}]{.underline}

Nuclear trafficking in the former USSR was a key concern immediately
following its collapse. Alarmist predictions of rampant nuclear
trafficking throughout Russia, Central Asia and the Caucasus, were
largely proved to be exaggerated, and these fears receded.

However, [[recent cases of nuclear smuggling]{.mark} along Central
Asia's periphery and security concerns over OBOR [highlight]{.mark}ed
[the need to renew security cooperation and non-proliferation
efforts]{.mark} in the region.]{.underline}

Recent media reports identified Moldovan criminal groups that attempted
to smuggle radioactive materials to Daesh (also known as the Islamic
State of Iraq and Syria, or ISIS) in 2015.

[Between January and June 2016, there were three incidents in Georgia of
groups attempting to smuggle radioactive material, specifically Cesium
137 and Uranium 235 and 238, presumably to Turkey. Uranium 235 can be
used in nuclear weapons, while Uranium 238 can be used to make
plutonium, a key ingredient in nuclear weapons.]{.underline}

[[Cesium 127 can be used in a 'dirty bomb]{.underline}]{.mark}', a
speculative explosive device that would spread harmful radioactive
material across a large area; [[Daesh is]{.mark} considered [capable of
producing dirty bombs]{.mark}.]{.underline}

It is likely that most of this nuclear material comes from Russia. In
January 2016, three Georgians were caught attempting to sell Cesium 137
in containers that were labelled in Russian.

Additionally, the 2016 Nuclear Security Index, created by nuclear
security experts and the Economist Intelligence Unit, ranked Russia as
the worst among 24 countries that possess weapons-usable materials. The
insecurity of Russia's nuclear stockpiles heightens concerns of the
material being trafficked out of Russia through Central Asia.

In addition to recent cases of nuclear trafficking on the borders of
Central Asia, OBOR exacerbates the risk of nuclear trafficking in the
region. China's strategy will dramatically increase transportation
connectivity across Central Asia, which risks further enabling the
smuggling of nuclear and other substances.

The 2016 UNODC report raised similar security concerns about OBOR,
arguing that 'intensifying inter-regional connections' for economic
integration can facilitate the activities of transnational criminal
networks and trafficking routes.

[[The elevated risk of nuclear smuggling]{.mark} in Central Asia [is
made apparent by recent cases of smuggling in the region's
periphery]{.mark} and the potential of OBOR's connectivity inadvertently
enhancing pre-established smuggling routes.]{.underline}

However, these increased risks also provide an opportunity for renewed
cooperation between the West and Russia in nuclear non-proliferation.
Non-proliferation is a relatively apolitical issue and thus there is
room for productive multilateral cooperation.

Efforts at increased information sharing, transparency, and reporting of
nuclear smuggling activity to the International Atomic Energy Agency
(IAEA) should be emphasised by all parties.

As a first step, all Central Asian states should sign up to the IAEA's
Convention on Nuclear Safety, as currently only Kazakhstan is a
Contracting Party. Additionally, reporting the seizure or loss of
nuclear material to the IAEA's Incident and Trafficking Database should
also be encouraged and promoted.

[[Central Asia's vulnerability to harbouring a potential
nuclear--drug--terrorism nexus poses a potential threat to international
security and requires]{.mark} a renewe[d multilateral commitment]{.mark}
and approach [to combating nuclear smuggling and
proliferation.]{.mark}]{.underline}

#### Nuclear terror causes extinction.

Bunn and Roth 17 (Matthew Bunn, Nickolas Roth, professor of practice at
Harvard Kennedy School former advisor in the White House Office of
Science and Technology Policy, Research associate at the Belfer Center's
Project on Managing the Atom at Harvard University, The effects of a
single terrorist nuclear bomb, Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists ,
https://thebulletin.org/2017/09/the-effects-of-a-single-terrorist-nuclear-bomb/)

The escalating threats between North Korea and the United States make it
easy to forget the "nuclear nightmare," as former US Secretary of
Defense William J. Perry put it, that could result even from the use of
just a single terrorist nuclear bomb in the heart of a major city.

At the risk of repeating the vast literature on the tragedies of
Hiroshima and Nagasaki---and the substantial literature surrounding
nuclear tests and simulations since then---[we attempt to spell out here
the likely consequences of [the]{.mark} [explosion of a single terrorist
nuclear bomb on a major city, and its]{.mark} subsequent [ripple
effects]{.mark} on the rest of the planet.]{.underline} Depending on
where and when it was detonated, [the blast, fire, initial radiation,
and long-term radioactive fallout from such a bomb [could leave]{.mark}
the heart of [a major city a smoldering radioactive ruin]{.mark},
killing tens or [hundreds of thousands of people and wounding]{.mark}
hundreds of thousands [more]{.mark}]{.underline}. [Vast areas would have
to be evacuated and might be uninhabitable for years]{.underline}.
[E[conomic, political, and social aftershocks would ripple throughout
the world.]{.underline} ]{.mark}[A single terrorist nuclear bomb would
change history]{.underline}. The country attacked---and the
world---would never be the same.

[The idea of terrorists accomplishing such a thing is, unfortunately,
not out of the question; it is far easier to make a crude, unsafe,
unreliable nuclear explosive that might fit in the back of a truck than
it is to make a safe, reliable weapon of known yield that can be
delivered by missile or combat aircraft.]{.underline} [Numerous
government studies have concluded that it is plausible that [a]{.mark}
sophisticated [terrorist group could make a crude bomb if they got the
needed nuclear material]{.mark}]{.underline}. And [in the last quarter
century, there have been some 20 seizures of stolen, weapons-usable
nuclear material, and at least two terrorist groups have made
significant efforts to acquire nuclear bombs.]{.underline}

Terrorist use of an actual nuclear bomb is a low-probability event---but
the immensity of the consequences means that even a small chance is
enough to justify an intensive effort to reduce the risk. Fortunately,
since the early 1990s, countries around the world have significantly
reduced the danger---but it remains very real, and there is more to do
to ensure this nightmare never becomes reality.

Brighter than a thousand suns. [Imagine a crude terrorist nuclear
bomb---containing a chunk of highly enriched uranium just under the size
of a regulation bowling ball, or a much smaller chunk of
plutonium---suddenly detonating inside a delivery van parked in the
heart of a major city]{.underline}. Such a terrorist bomb would release
as much as 10 kilotons of explosive energy, or the equivalent of 10,000
tons of conventional explosives, a volume of explosives large enough to
fill all the cars of a mile-long train. [In a millionth of a second, all
of that energy would be released inside that small ball of nuclear
material, creating temperatures and pressures as high as those at the
center of the sun]{.underline}. That furious energy would explode
outward, releasing its energy in three main ways: a powerful blast wave;
intense heat; and deadly radiation.

[The ball would expand almost instantly into a fireball]{.underline} the
width of four football fields, [incinerating]{.underline} essentially
[everything and everyone within]{.underline}. The heated fireball would
rise, sucking in air from below and expanding above, creating the
mushroom cloud that has become the symbol of the terror of the nuclear
age. [The ionized plasma in the fireball would create a localized
electromagnetic pulse more powerful than lightning, shorting out
communications and electronics nearby]{.underline}---though most would
be destroyed by the bomb's other effects in any case. (Estimates of
heat, blast, and radiation effects in this article are drawn primarily
from Alex Wellerstein's "Nukemap," which itself comes from declassified
US government data, such as the 660-page government textbook The Effects
of Nuclear Weapons.)

At the instant of its detonation, [the bomb would also release an
intense burst of gamma and neutron radiation which would be lethal for
nearly everyone directly exposed within about two-thirds of a mile from
the center of the blast]{.underline}. (Those who happened to be shielded
by being inside, or having buildings between them and the bomb, would be
partly protected---in some cases, reducing their doses by ten times or
more.)

The nuclear flash from the heat of the fireball would radiate in both
visible light and the infrared; it would be "brighter than a thousand
suns," in the words of the title of a book describing the development of
nuclear weapons---adapting a phrase from the Hindu epic the
Bhagavad-Gita. [Anyone who looked directly at the blast would be
blinded. The heat from the fireball would ignite fires and horribly burn
everyone exposed outside at distances of nearly a mile
away.]{.underline} (In the Nagasaki Atomic Bomb Museum, visitors gaze in
horror at the bones of a human hand embedded in glass melted by the
bomb.)

No one has burned a city on that scale in the decades since World War
II, so it is difficult to predict the full extent of the fire damage
that would occur from the explosion of a nuclear bomb in one of today's
cities. Modern glass, steel, and concrete buildings would presumably be
less flammable than the wood-and-rice-paper housing of Hiroshima or
Nagasaki in the 1940s---but many questions remain, including exactly how
thousands of broken gas lines might contribute to fire damage (as they
did in Dresden during World War II). On 9/11, the buildings of the World
Trade Center proved to be much more vulnerable to fire damage than had
been expected. Ultimately, [[even a crude terrorist nuclear bomb would
carry the possibility that the countless fires touched off by the
explosion would coalesce into a devastating firestorm]{.mark}, as
occurred at Hiroshima. In a firestorm, the rising column of hot air from
the massive fire sucks in the air from all around, creating
hurricane-force winds; everything flammable and everything alive within
the firestorm would be consumed. The fires and the dust from the blast
would make it extremely difficult for either rescuers or survivors to
see.]{.underline}

The explosion would create a powerful blast wave rushing out in every
direction. For more than a quarter-mile all around the blast, the pulse
of pressure would be over 20 pounds per square inch above atmospheric
pressure (known as "overpressure"), destroying or severely damaging even
sturdy buildings. [[The combination of blast, heat, and radiation would
kill virtually everyone in this zone]{.mark}.]{.underline} The blast
would be accompanied by winds of many hundreds of miles per hour.

The damage from the explosion would extend far beyond this inner zone of
almost total death. Out to more than half a mile, [the blast would be
strong enough to collapse most residential buildings and create a
serious danger that office buildings would topple over, killing those
inside and those in the path of the rubble]{.underline}. (On the other
hand, the office towers of a modern city would tend to block the blast
wave in some areas, providing partial protection from the blast, as well
as from the heat and radiation.) In that zone, almost anything made of
wood would be destroyed: Roofs would cave in, windows would shatter, gas
lines would rupture. Telephone poles, street lamps, and utility lines
would be severely damaged. Many roads would be blocked by mountains of
wreckage. In this zone, many people would be killed or injured in
building collapses, or trapped under the rubble; many more would be
burned, blinded, or injured by flying debris. In many cases, their
charred skin would become ragged and fall off in sheets.

[The effects of the detonation would act in deadly synergy. The smashed
materials of buildings broken by the blast would be far easier for the
fires to ignite than intact structures. The effects of radiation would
make it far more difficult for burned and injured people to recover. The
combination of burns, radiation, and physical injuries would cause far
more death and suffering than any one of them would alone.]{.underline}

The silent killer. [[The]{.mark} bomb's [immediate effects would be
followed by a]{.mark} slow, [lingering killer: radioactive
fallout]{.mark}]{.underline}. A bomb detonated at ground level would dig
a huge crater, hurling tons of earth and debris thousands of feet into
the sky. Sucked into the rising fireball, these particles would mix with
the radioactive remainders of the bomb, and over the next few hours or
days, the debris would rain down for miles downwind. Depending on
weather and wind patterns, the fallout could actually be deadlier and
make a far larger area unusable than the blast itself. [Acute radiation
sickness from the initial radiation pulse and the fallout would likely
affect tens of thousands of people.]{.underline} Depending on the dose,
they might suffer from vomiting, watery diarrhea, fever, sores, loss of
hair, and bone marrow depletion. Some would survive; some would die
within days; some would take months to die. Cancer rates among the
survivors would rise. Women would be more vulnerable than men---children
and infants especially so.

Much of the radiation from a nuclear blast is short-lived; radiation
levels even a few days after the blast would be far below those in the
first hours. For those not killed or terribly wounded by the initial
explosion, the best advice would be to take shelter in a basement for at
least several days. But many would be too terrified to stay. Thousands
of panic-stricken people might receive deadly doses of radiation as they
fled from their homes. Some of the radiation will be longer-lived; areas
most severely affected would have to be abandoned for many years after
the attack. The combination of radioactive fallout and the devastation
of nearly all life-sustaining infrastructure over a vast area would mean
that hundreds of thousands of people would have to evacuate.

Ambulances to nowhere. The explosion would also destroy much of the
city's ability to respond. Hospitals would be leveled, doctors and
nurses killed and wounded, ambulances destroyed. (In Hiroshima, 42 of 45
hospitals were destroyed or severely damaged, and 270 of 300 doctors
were killed.) Resources that survived outside the zone of destruction
would be utterly overwhelmed. Hospitals have no ability to cope with
tens or hundreds of thousands of terribly burned and injured people all
at once; the United States, for example, has 1,760 burn beds in
hospitals nationwide, of which a third are available on any given day.

And the problem would not be limited to hospitals; firefighters, for
example, would have little ability to cope with thousands of fires
raging out of control at once. Fire stations and equipment would be
destroyed in the affected area, and firemen killed, along with police
and other emergency responders. Some of the first responders may become
casualties themselves, from radioactive fallout, fire, and collapsing
buildings. Over much of the affected area, communications would be
destroyed, by both the physical effects and the electromagnetic pulse
from the explosion.

Better preparation for such a disaster could save thousands of
lives---but ultimately, [there is no way any city can genuinely be
prepared for a catastrophe on such a historic scale]{.underline},
occurring in a flash, with zero warning. Rescue and recovery attempts
would be impeded by the destruction of most of the needed personnel and
equipment, and by fire, debris, radiation, fear, lack of communications,
and the immense scale of the disaster. The US military and the national
guard could provide critically important capabilities---but federal
plans assume that "no significant federal response" would be available
for 24-to-72 hours. Many of those burned and injured would wait in vain
for help, food, or water, perhaps for days.

The scale of death and suffering. How many would die in such an event,
and how many would be terribly wounded, would depend on where and when
the bomb was detonated, what the weather conditions were at the time,
how successful the response was in helping the wounded survivors, and
more. Many estimates of casualties are based on census data, which
reflect where people sleep at night; if the attack occurred in the
middle of a workday, the numbers of people crowded into the office
towers at the heart of many modern cities would be far higher. The
daytime population of Manhattan, for example, is roughly twice its
nighttime population; in Midtown on a typical workday, there are an
estimated 980,000 people per square mile. A 10-kiloton weapon detonated
there might well kill half a million people---not counting those who
might die of radiation sickness from the fallout. (These effects were
analyzed in great detail in the Rand Corporation's Considering the
Effects of a Catastrophic Terrorist Attack and the British Medical
Journal's "Nuclear terrorism.")

On a typical day, the wind would blow the fallout north, seriously
contaminating virtually all of Manhattan above Gramercy Park; people
living as far away as Stamford, Connecticut would likely have to
evacuate.

Seriously injured survivors would greatly outnumber the dead, their
suffering magnified by the complete inadequacy of available help. [The
psychological and social effects---overwhelming sadness, depression,
post-traumatic stress disorder, myriad forms of anxiety---would be
profound and long-lasting.]{.underline}

The scenario we have been describing is a groundburst. An
airburst---such as might occur, for example, if terrorists put their
bomb in a small aircraft they had purchased or rented---would extend the
blast and fire effects over a wider area, killing and injuring even
larger numbers of people immediately. But an airburst would not have the
same lingering effects from fallout as a groundburst, because the rock
and dirt would not be sucked up into the fireball and contaminated. The
10-kiloton blast we have been discussing is likely toward the high end
of what terrorists could plausibly achieve with a crude, improvised
bomb, but even a 1-kiloton blast would be a catastrophic event, having a
deadly radius between one-third and one-half that of a 10-kiloton blast.

These hundreds of thousands of people would not be mere statistics, but
countless individual stories of loss---parents, children, entire
families; all religions; rich and poor alike---killed or horribly
mutilated. Human suffering and tragedy on this scale does not have to be
imagined; it can be remembered through the stories of the survivors of
the US atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, the only times in
history when nuclear weapons have been used intentionally against human
beings. [The pain and suffering caused by those bombings are almost
beyond human comprehension]{.underline}; the eloquent testimony of the
Hibakusha---the survivors who passed through the atomic fire---should
stand as an eternal reminder of the need to prevent nuclear weapons from
ever being used in anger again.

Global economic disaster. [[The economic impact]{.mark} of such an
attack [would be enormous]{.mark}. The effects would reverberate for so
far and so long that they are difficult to estimate in all their
complexity. Hundreds of thousands of people would be too injured or sick
to work for weeks or months]{.underline}. Hundreds of thousands more
would evacuate to locations far from their jobs. Many places of
employment would have to be abandoned because of the radioactive
fallout. [Insurance companies would reel under the losses; but at the
same time, many insurance policies exclude the effects of nuclear
attacks]{.underline}---an item insurers considered beyond their ability
to cover---so the owners of thousands of buildings would not have the
insurance payments needed to cover the cost of fixing them, thousands of
companies would go bankrupt, and banks would be left holding an immense
number of mortgages that would never be repaid.

[Consumer and investor confidence would likely be dramatically affected,
as worried people slowed their spending]{.underline}. Enormous new
homeland security and military investments would be very likely. If the
bomb had come in a shipping container, the targeted country---and
possibly others---might stop all containers from entering until it could
devise a system for ensuring they could never again be used for such a
purpose, throwing a wrench into the gears of global trade for an
extended period. (And this might well occur even if a shipping container
had not been the means of delivery.)

Even the far smaller 9/11 attacks are estimated to have caused economic
aftershocks costing almost \$1 trillion even excluding the
multi-trillion-dollar costs of the wars that ensued. The cost of a
terrorist nuclear attack in a major city would likely be many times
higher.

The most severe effects would be local, but the effects of trade
disruptions, reduced economic activity, and more would reverberate
around the world. Consequently, while some countries may feel that
nuclear terrorism is only a concern for the countries most likely to be
targeted---such as the United States---in reality it is a threat to
everyone, everywhere. In 2005, then-UN Secretary-General Kofi Annan
warned that [[these global effects would push]{.mark} "tens of millions
of people into dire poverty," creating ["a second death toll throughout
the developing world]{.mark}."]{.underline} One recent estimate
suggested that [[a nuclear attack in an urban area would cause a global
recession]{.mark}, cutting global Gross Domestic Product by some two
percent, and pushing an additional 30 million people in the developing
world into extreme poverty.]{.underline}

Desperate dilemmas. In short, an act of nuclear terrorism could rip the
heart out of a major city, and cause ripple effects throughout the
world. The government of the country attacked would face desperate
decisions: How to help the city attacked? How to prevent further
attacks? How to respond or retaliate?

Terrorists---either those who committed the attack or others---would
probably claim they had more bombs already hidden in other cities
(whether they did or not), and threaten to detonate them unless their
demands were met. The fear that this might be true could lead people to
flee major cities in a large-scale, uncontrolled evacuation. There is
very little ability to support the population of major cities in the
surrounding countryside. [The potential for widespread havoc and
economic chaos is very real.]{.underline}

If the detonation took place in the capital of the nation attacked, much
of the government might be destroyed. A bomb in Washington, D.C., for
example, might kill the President, the Vice President, and many of the
members of Congress and the Supreme Court. (Having some plausible
national leader survive is a key reason why one cabinet member is always
elsewhere on the night of the State of the Union address.) Elaborate,
classified plans for "continuity of government" have already been drawn
up in a number of countries, but the potential for chaos and
confusion---if almost all of a country's top leaders were killed---would
still be enormous. Who, for example, could address the public on what
the government would do, and what the public should do, to respond?
Could anyone honestly assure the public there would be no further
attacks? If they did, who would believe them? In the United States,
given the practical impossibility of passing major legislation with
Congress in ruins and most of its members dead or seriously injured,
some have argued for passing legislation in advance giving the
government emergency powers to act---and creating procedures, for
example, for legitimately replacing most of the House of
Representatives. But to date, no such legislative preparations have been
made.

In what would inevitably be a desperate effort to prevent further
attacks, traditional standards of civil liberties might be jettisoned,
at least for a time---particularly when people realized that the fuel
for the bomb that had done such damage would easily have fit in a
suitcase. Old rules limiting search and surveillance could be among the
first to go. The government might well impose martial law as it sought
to control the situation, hunt for the perpetrators, and find any
additional weapons or nuclear materials they might have. Even the far
smaller attacks of 9/11 saw the US government authorizing torture of
prisoners and mass electronic surveillance.

And what standards of international order and law would still hold sway?
The country attacked might well lash out militarily at whatever
countries it thought might bear a portion of responsibility. (A
terrifying description of the kinds of discussions that might occur
appeared in Brian Jenkins' book, Will Terrorists Go Nuclear?) With the
nuclear threshold already crossed in this scenario---at least by
terrorists---it is conceivable that some of the resulting conflicts
might escalate to nuclear use. International politics could become more
brutish and violent, with powerful states taking unilateral action, by
force if necessary, in an effort to ensure their security. After 9/11,
the United States led the invasions of two sovereign nations, in wars
that have since cost hundreds of thousands of lives and trillions of
dollars, while plunging a region into chaos. Would the reaction after a
far more devastating nuclear attack be any less?

In particular, the idea that each state can decide for itself how much
security to provide for nuclear weapons and their essential ingredients
would likely be seen as totally unacceptable following such an attack.
Powerful states would likely demand that others surrender their nuclear
material or accept foreign troops (or other imposed security measures)
to guard it.

That could well be the first step toward a more profound transformation
of the international system. [After such a catastrophe, [major powers
may feel compelled to more freely engage in preventive war]{.mark},
seizing territories they worry might otherwise be terrorist safe havens,
and taking other steps they see as brutal but necessary to preserve
their security]{.underline}. For this reason, foreign policy analyst
Stephen Krasner has argued that "[[conventional rules of sovereignty
would be abandoned overnight]{.underline}]{.mark}." Confidence in both
the national security institutions of the country attacked and
international institutions such as the International Atomic Energy
Agency and the United Nations, which had so manifestly failed to prevent
the devastation, might erode. The effect on nuclear weapons policies is
hard to predict: One can imagine new nuclear terror driving a new push
for nuclear disarmament, but one could also imagine states feeling more
certain than ever before that they needed nuclear weapons.

#### Plan: The United States Federal Government should substantially reduce its sale of the Aegis Ashore ballistic missile defense system to Japan.

### Scenario 1- Strategic Stability

#### Increasingly advanced BMDs undermine Russian and Chinese deterrence and lead to regional instability

[The prospect of significant power aggregation deriving from Japan--US
defence-industrial and military-operational integration in missile
defence is neither uncontroversial nor unproblematic. Missile defence
has attracted]{.underline} scholarly and diplomatic [criticism for
undermining the strategic balance between the Great Powers
and]{.underline} thus for [destabilizing international security. [China
and Russia]{.mark}]{.underline}, in particular, [[invoke failing
strategic stability in their]{.mark} vehement [opposition to US-led
missile defence efforts]{.mark}]{.underline}, whether
[[through]{.underline}]{.mark} NATO on Eurasia\'s Atlantic flank or
through [[Japan--US]{.underline}]{.mark} and US--South Korean
[[collaborations]{.mark} on its Pacific flank]{.underline}.60 In the
light of currently deployed missile defence systems, which fail to meet
the technical specifications for defence against strategic ballistic
missiles and whose inventories are far from sufficient to absorb
saturation attacks by shorter-range ballistic and cruise missiles,
Russian and Chinese concerns appear overstated, if not unwarranted.
However, notwithstanding its official rationale, [current [R&D in
missile defence]{.mark}, including rail guns and directed energy
weapons, offers the potential to [reduce]{.mark} allied [vulnerability
to strategic ballistic missiles]{.mark} and saturation missile attacks,
thereby [eroding Chinese and Russian deterrence]{.mark} vis-à-vis Japan
and the United States, [and]{.mark} thus [destabilizing relations
between the most influential actors in international
security]{.mark}]{.underline}. Further defence-industrial and
military-operational integration in missile defence hinges on the two
allies' willingness to accept the political and, potentially, strategic
costs of their power-aggregating efforts

#### Aegis Ashore is uniquely destabilizing due to offensive potential and information sharing with the U.S.

To this end, [[Japan]{.mark}]{.underline} has deployed two BMD systems,
the ground-based Patriot (PAC-3) and the maritime Aegis SM-3 IIA, and
[[is]{.mark} further [negotiating procurement of]{.mark}]{.underline}
two other systems from the USA -- THAAD and [[Aegis
Ashore]{.underline}]{.mark} (Weitz 2013; JIJI 2014). All of the above
mentioned BMD systems are of U.S. origin. The currently deployed
systems, PAC-3 and Aegis, provide for a relatively effective protection
against ballistic missiles, as the two systems together act as a
multi-tier defense system, a BMD system capable of destroying incoming
missiles at different altitudes -- outside and inside the Earth's
atmosphere (Ministry of Defense 2012: 187). The decision to deploy BMD
systems was made following the 1998 overflight of the North Korean
Taepodong missile over Japan. Prior to the Taepodong test, only few
domestic actors advocated for BMD system development and deployment,
most notably the Japanese Defense Agency (Oros 2008: 155). While North
Korean threat was the immediate impetus that persuaded a broader set of
policymakers to become involved with BMD systems, China has featured
prominently in the Japanese BMD discourse. On one hand, the Chinese
missile program is also identified as a threat. However, when making the
decision to collaborate with the USA on BMD development, special
attention was paid to the Chinese perception of any BMD undertakings of
Japan (Oros 2008: 160). It has been previously stated that Japanese
strategic culture rests on the following three basic tenets: (1) Japan
will not possess traditional military; (2) no use of force except in
self-defense; and (3) no participation in foreign conflicts (Oros 2014:
233). The shifts in security policy, which allowed Japan to work on the
development of BMD systems and later to deploy them, are in line with
the three tenets of the 'anti- militarist' strategic culture (Oros 2008:
149). Nevertheless, points were raised that the joint development of BMD
systems with the USA is in breach of Article 9 of the Constitution of
Japan. This issue was resolved when the Cabinet Legislation Bureau, the
office in charge of preparing new legislative proposals and making sure
they would pass the tests of constitutionality, has found that the
integration of BMD systems with the USA is not unconstitutional (Oros
2014: 237--238; Oros 2015: 153). Furthermore, legislative changes had to
be made to the arms export legislation which allowed for joint
production and technology transfers when it came to BMD development with
the USA (Oros 2014: 239). 17 [What makes the Japanese BMD systems
problematic for other regional actors, especially China, is the fact
that [with]{.mark} the [modern BMD]{.mark} systems [there is a thin line
between]{.mark} the purely [defensive]{.mark} nature of the systems [and
offensive capabilities.]{.mark} It has been demonstrated that, [by
making alterations to the SM-3 interceptor,]{.mark} the [Aegis]{.mark}
BMD system [has offensive potential]{.mark}. This allows it [to target
satellites]{.mark}, thus [making it an anti- satellite]{.mark} (A-SAT)
[weapon]{.mark}]{.underline}. 7 The offensive capabilities of Aegis are
not a given parameter, though. Converting Aegis from a defensive BMD
system into an offensive A-SAT system requires additional action on the
part of the system's operator (alteration of the SM-3 interceptor
missile). Looking back at the basic tenets of the Japanese strategic
culture, Japan is very unlikely to take such an action. [The [Japanese
cooperation with the]{.mark} [US]{.mark}A [is]{.mark} [another
concern]{.mark} that needs to be addressed]{.underline}. It has already
been mentioned that Japan had to reevaluate its arms export restrictions
in order to make the cooperation with USA possible. However, the USA has
played a much larger role in the Japanese BMD policy. The USA has been
exerting pressure on Japan to participate on BMD development ever since
the Reagan administration, when Japan was pushed to participate in
research, as part of the Strategic Defense Initiative (Oros 2008: 158).
[The decision to adopt U.S. systems, especially Aegis, has raised
questions regarding the prohibition of the exercise of collective
self-defense]{.underline}. The Japanese government has reiterated that
any BMD system will be used only for the purpose of protecting Japan,
will be operated on Japan's independent judgment, and that it will not
be used for defense of third parties (Chief Cabinet Secretary 2003).
Nevertheless, [[effective operation of]{.mark} the [Aegis]{.mark} system
[requires]{.mark} cooperation and [information sharing]{.mark} between
the Maritime Self-Defense Forces [and]{.mark} U.S. Navy. This [raises
doubts about the]{.mark} actual [independence of]{.mark} the [Japanese
BMD systems]{.mark} from its U.S. ally.]{.underline}

#### China won't undertake aggressive nuclear modernization absent Aegis Ashore -- they'll do the bare minimum necessary to maintain strategic stability 

**Chase 13** (Michael S. Chase, U.S. Naval War College Warfare Analysis
and Research Associate Professor, "China\'s Transition to a More
Credible Nuclear Deterrent: Implications and Challenges for the United
States," Asia Policy, Project Muse)

Shen Dingli of Fudan University argues that [[China's nuclear strategy
is "a type of minimum deterrence]{.underline}]{.mark}," one that is
"[commensurate with its NFU doctrine]{.underline}." 40 Shen highlights
what he characterizes as the uniqueness of China's approach to nuclear
deterrence among the acknowledged nuclear-weapon states, which he
attributes in large part to its status as the only permanent member of
the UN Security Council that adheres to an NFU policy. [Because its
policy and strategy are [limited to preparing for nuclear
retaliation]{.mark}, China needs fewer nuclear weapons]{.underline} than
the other major nuclear powers. [It]{.underline} also [does not need the
highly accurate strike capabilities required to launch a disarming first
strike against another nuclear power]{.underline}. In Shen's words,
"[for minimum deterrence, one only needs to assure a credible nuclear
retaliation so as to deter a first nuclear attack.]{.underline}" 41
Similarly, according to Teng Jianqun of the China Institute of
International Studies, [[China seeks to maintain a "minimum credible
deterrence]{.mark}" [capability]{.mark} by ensuring that the PLA has the
capability to retaliate following a nuclear attack.]{.underline} Teng
argues that China's current nuclear modernization should be seen in this
context. In his words, "[[the purpose of \[China's\] current nuclear
modernization is]{.mark} first and foremost [to guarantee the]{.mark}
security and [reliability of nuclear weapons in the face of]{.mark}
threats, such as the [U.S. development and deployment of ballistic
missile defenses]{.mark}]{.underline}." 42 Sun Xiangli, deputy director
of the Arms Control Research Division at the Institute of Applied
Physics and Computational Mathematics in Beijing, has asserted that
China's nuclear strategy should be referred to as "defensive nuclear
deterrence characterized by the policy of NFU." In reaching this
conclusion, Sun argues that [enduring beliefs about the nature and
purpose of nuclear weapons have influenced China's strategic calculus
and served as a framework for the development of Chinese nuclear
forces]{.underline}. 43 [[Chinese leaders]{.underline}]{.mark} and
scientists [have [see]{.mark}n [nuclear weapons as]{.mark} basically
[useful for]{.mark} political reasons and [strategic deterrence]{.mark},
rather than as having real tactical or operational utility on the
battlefield. They have generally believed that the threshold for the
infliction of unacceptable damage is significantly lower than Western
strategists]{.underline} have often [claim]{.underline}ed. 44 Sun writes
that "based on these principles, and according to its economic,
technical and geographic conditions, [China has developed a limited
nuclear force]{.underline}." 45 At the same time, he argues that even
though China has felt that it only needs a relatively limited number of
nuclear weapons, "these [weapons must have a deterrent effect, and a
certain number and survival of the nuclear weapons must be
guaranteed]{.underline}." Sun explains, "In short[, the key to having a
credible nuclear deterrence is to guarantee an effective nuclear
retaliatory capability]{.underline}." 46 [What is required to do
so]{.underline}, however, [is subject to change over time]{.underline}:
in other words, Sun believes that [the number of nuclear weapons China
needs is not "immutably fixed" but is related to challenges to the
survivability of the force and its ability to penetrate enemy
defense]{.underline}s. Accordingly, [[an appropriate rule for
determining the size of China's nuclear force is that it must "be able
to mount a nuclear strike that can penetrate an enemy's missile defense
system after surviving a first strike.]{.underline}]{.mark}" Along
similar lines, Chu Shulong and Rong Yu of Tsinghua University have
described China's nuclear strategy as one of "dynamic minimum
deterrence." 49 They argue that this strategy retains key features of
the PRC's traditional approach while adjusting it to keep pace with
changes in the security environment and emerging threats. According to
Chu and Rong, "China has all along adhered to a strategy that may be
labeled as minimum deterrence. However, as circumstances are always
changing, the content, quantity, quality, and structure of minimum
deterrence also must change." 50 The approach is not tied to a specific
number of nuclear weapons but rather to the capability required to deter
powerful countries like the United States an d Russia. In short, Chu and
Rong assert that "the Chinese understanding and practice of the strategy
of minimum deterrence is dynamic---its features are continually adjusted
to meet the changing strategic environment and threat

#### Aegis Ashore escalates tensions between China and the U.S.--Japan alliance -- China perceives it as Japanese remilitarization and a threat to their second strike capabilities.

**Panda 18** (Ankit Panda, The Diplomat Senior editor specializing in
the Asia-Pacific region, "Will Japan\'s Aegis Ashore Radar Choice Elicit
China\'s Wrath," The Diplomat,
<https://search-proquest-com.dartmouth.idm.oclc.org/docview/2070751498?accountid=10422&rfr_id=info%3Axri%2Fsid%3Aprimo>)

Earlier this month[, reports citing sources within the Japanese Ministry
of Defense indicated that [Japan's deployment of]{.mark} the [Aegis
Ashore]{.mark} missile defense system [will be built around a]{.mark}
variant of Lockheed Martin's]{.underline} still-in-development [[Long
Range Discrimination Radar]{.mark} (LRDR), instead of the Raytheon SPY-6
radar]{.underline}. While details of the precise LRDR variant Japan will
use are unknown, it is likely that the radar will feature reduced range.
In any case, the full-fledged LRDR, as described by Lt. Gen. Samuel A.
Greaves, the director of the U.S. Missile Defense Agency, in testimony
earlier this year is a "midcourse sensor that will provide persistent
long-range midcourse discrimination, precision tracking, and hit
assessment and improve BMDS target discrimination capability while
supporting a more efficient utilization of the GMD interceptor
inventory." Setting aside the suitability of LRDR for Japan's midcourse
interception needs for a moment, [it bears interrogating whether [the
selection]{.mark} of [LRDR might emerge as a new thorn in Sino-Japanese
relations]{.mark}.]{.underline} As I explained last year, [China's
over-the-top reaction by U.S. Forces Korea to deploy a Terminal High
Altitude Area Defense battery in South Korea had to do primarily with
the the advanced, high resolution AN/TPY-2 radar accompanying the
launchers---not the launchers themselves]{.underline}. Similarly, [even
if the LRDR variant deployed by Japan is drastically different from the
GMD-supporting primary version in development for the United States,
it's far from clear that China will let that pass.]{.underline} (Beijing
declined U.S. invitations for technical talks over THAAD in 2016.) [The
idea behind Chinese opposition to advanced missile defense sensors in
Northeast Asia is simple: [China fears]{.mark} that [U.S.]{.mark}
efforts to establish [theater-wide missile defense sensors could
erode]{.mark} [the efficacy of the country's]{.mark} relatively [lean
strategic deterrent]{.mark}]{.underline}[.]{.mark} In specific terms,
Beijing was concerned that the United States could operate the AN/TPY-2
radar, now located in South Korea's Seongju county, in forward-based
mode. The United States, meanwhile, has claimed that the radar will
operate exclusively in terminal mode, which allows the THAAD system to
serve a defensive role against prospective ballistic missile threats
from North Korea. Not only is LRDR being designed with support for the
United States' Ground-Based Midcourse Defense (GMD) system in mind,
[the]{.underline} U.S. National Security Strategy ([NSS]{.underline})
published earlier this year [emphasized U.S. intentions to "cooperate on
missile defense with Japan and South Korea to move toward an area
defense capability." That's not the same thing as homeland missile
defense, but, along [with]{.mark} a prospective [LRDR deployment in
Japan, Beijing will have reason for concern]{.mark}.]{.underline} (The
NSS does also note that "enhanced missile defense is not intended to
undermine strategic stability or disrupt longstanding strategic
relationships with Russia or China," though the administration's
upcoming Missile Defense Review may tweak that view[.) Should Tokyo give
Beijing assurances that its LRDR will be discrete from the U.S. homeland
missile defense sensor networks, it's unlikely that China would take
this for granted---China cast aside similar assurances on the AN/TPY-2
deployed in South Korea]{.underline}. For the moment, China has not
chosen to treat reports of Japan's selection of LRDR in the same way
that it dealt with the THAAD deployment in South Korea. Part of the
reason for this might be that the Japanese Ministry of Defense has yet
to confirm the decision on-the-record, or, more realistically, that
Japan's deployment of Aegis Ashore remains years away in 2023. Tokyo and
Beijing are currently undergoing a broader diplomatic thaw anyway and it
may not be in China's interest to rock the boat over a deployment that
is far from proximate. Either way, the few Chinese official statements
that have addressed the Japanese Aegis Ashore deployment decision have
been careful not to overtly condemn Tokyo. Last August, following
U.S.-Japan military-to-military talks on Aegis Ashore deployment
acceleration, the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs issued a
cautionary note, but stopped short of condemning Japan. "The Chinese
government always maintains that the missile defense issue should be
handled cautiously as it bears on global strategic stability and the
mutual trust between major countries," [spokesperson Hua
Chunying]{.underline} added at the time. "While taking into account
their own security interests, all relevant parties should respect the
legitimate security concerns of other countries, jointly follow the
principles of upholding global strategic stability and undiminished
security for all countries and safeguard the international security
environment featuring peace, stability, equality, mutual trust,
cooperation and win-win outcomes," she added. In December, when Japan's
decision to select Aegis Ashore over THAAD was announcement, Hua
[was]{.underline} more [pointed in her criticism]{.underline}, [tying
Tokyo's procurement decision to historical tensions in East Asia. "[Due
to]{.mark} what happened in [history, Japan's moves in]{.mark} the
fields of [military and security are always followed closely by
its]{.mark} Asian [neighbors]{.mark} and the international
community]{.underline}." She continued: "[[When it comes to the
anti-missile issue, the Chinese]{.mark} [governmen]{.mark}t]{.underline}
always [[believes]{.mark} that [it bears on the global strategic
stability and]{.mark} the [mutual trust between
countries]{.mark}.]{.underline} It bears noting, however, that we have
yet to see anything from China coming close to the high-level critical
rhetoric that South Korea saw when in exploratory talks over the
deployment of THAAD on its territory. As the United States and South
Korea debated the merits of deployment, none other than Chinese Foreign
Minister Wang Yi felt it necessary, as early as February 2016, to
emphasize that "the monitoring scope of \[THAAD's AN/TPY-2\] X-Band
radar, goes far beyond the defense need of the Korean Peninsula." The
official Chinese reaction was specific. [[Tokyo may find itself
facing]{.underline}]{.mark} similar [[Chinese concerns as 2023
approaches]{.mark} and more specifics emerge about its Aegis Ashore
deployment plans. In the meantime, China is no doubt going to keep a
close eye on Japan's choices and evolving U.S.-Japan cooperation on
ballistic missile defense.]{.underline}

#### Aegis Ashore's advanced missile defense capabilities wreck Chinese deterrence - spurs nuclear modernization and expansion

**Zhang 15** (Dr. Baohui Zhang, Linghan University Political Science
Professor and Asian Pacific Studies Director, *China\'s Assertive
Nuclear Posture: State Security in an Anarchic International Order*,
2015, pp. 103-4)

[[China's]{.mark} recent [efforts to modernize and expand]{.mark} its
[offensive nuclear capabilities are rooted in the rise
of]{.mark}]{.underline} the [[US]{.mark} [defensive systems that]{.mark}
could seriously [compromise Chinese nuclear
deterrence]{.mark}]{.underline}. US missile defense, which includes both
ground-based midcourse defense system (GMD) and various theater-
oriented missile defense (TMD) systems, is widely seen by Chinese
military experts as a fundamental threat to its strategic deterrence.
Until recently, the Chinese military tended to believe that US missile
defense could not effectively deter major nuclear powers such as China
and Russia. However, [[due to the]{.mark} steady [maturing of a
multilayered]{.mark} US [missile defense,]{.mark} Chinese [nuclear
experts are losing confidence in China's offensive
capabilities]{.mark}]{.underline}[.]{.mark} This pessimism is best shown
in an important 2008 interview of Wang Wenchao in a Chinese military
magazine. As identified by the magazine, Wang is [the chief designer of
China's sea-based strategic missiles]{.underline}. In this interview,
Wang [expressed grave pessimism about the ability of Chinese nuclear
forces to penetrate US missile defense]{.underline}. As he stated, "I
have done a research: facing a multi-tiered missile defense system, if
any single layer can achieve a success rate of 70%, then 100 single
warhead missiles could all be intercepted even if they are mounting a
simultaneous attack." 24 Therefore, Yao Yunzhu, a PLA nuclear strategist
at the Academy of Military Sciences, suggests that US missile defense
has had a profound impact on China's nuclear deterrence. As she points
out, "missile defense has made China increasingly worried about the
credibility of its deterrence against the United States. \... Among the
many influences on Chinese nuclear thinking, the development and
deployment of missile defense is the most important one. [[China
must]{.mark} consider how to [maintain a credible second strike
capability against US missile defense]{.mark}]{.underline}." 25 [Wu
[Chunsi]{.mark}, a civilian expert on nuclear deterrence, [emphasizes
the impact of]{.mark} US [missile defense on China's no-first-use
doctrin]{.mark}e]{.underline}. She argues that [[missile defense
makes]{.mark} the doctrine increasingly [difficult to maintain because
it gives the US]{.mark}A [a double advantage in offensive first-strike
capability and]{.mark} a [credible defensive
capability.]{.mark}]{.underline} As she observes: China's No First Use
constrains its ability to counter American missile defense systems.
Assuming a war between the two countries, [[China]{.mark}, limited by
its No First Use policy]{.underline}, obviously [[could not launch a
first strike]{.mark} against the United States]{.underline}. On the
other hand, [the limited number of [Chinese nuclear missiles
would]{.mark} definitely [become targets for American preemptive
strikes]{.mark}.]{.underline} Given the US ability to attack hard
targets, [[how many of China's]{.mark} intercontinental [missiles could
survive a first strike and then manage to penetrate]{.mark} American
[missile defense system]{.mark}s?]{.underline} This obviously is an
important issue for the Chinese strategic community to consider. 26
Recently, [Chinese strategists have been focusing on the threat posed by
a sea-based theater missile defense]{.underline} (TMD)
[system]{.underline}. This system, [based on Aegis equipped
warships]{.underline}, is already becoming operational and is being
deployed very [close to China]{.underline}. A Chinese military magazine
organized a symposium to examine the impact of US sea-based missile
defense on China's nuclear deterrence. One article claims that [this
sea-based capability will "forwardly extend US anti-missile deployment
and compromise deterrence effectiveness by our strategic nuclear
forces]{.underline}." 27 Analysts believe that [[if Chinese strategic
missiles were launched]{.mark} from the first layer of inland
provinces]{.underline} such as Henan and Jilin, [where China's nuclear
forces are rumored to be deployed, US [TMD]{.mark}]{.underline} in the
Pacific [[could intercept these missiles]{.underline}]{.mark} during the
boost phase of the flight, when the missile speed is relatively slow.
Further, these [[American warships could serve as an early warning for
missile defense]{.underline}]{.mark} in North America, [[improving the
probability of]{.underline}]{.mark} eventual [[successful
interception]{.mark} of Chinese nuclear missiles]{.underline}. The
latest PLA assessments believe that US missile defense will achieve
significant progress toward combat effectiveness by 2030. According to
Li Fang and Yang Zhu, two PLA analysts, by then the US mid-course
interception system will "possess full and complete combat
capabilities." In the meantime, the US ability for boost phase
interception will also "see steady breakthroughs." Most importantly,
[the sea-based Aegis missile defense system "will possess the ability of
intercepting intercontinental ballistic missiles]{.underline}." 28 Thus,
[[US missile defense has sown the seeds for China's nuclear
expansion]{.mark}.]{.underline} Indeed, [[Chinese military
strategists]{.mark} all [recommend such a course of action]{.mark} to
maintain a credible nuclear deterrence]{.underline}. For example, Yao
Yunzhu claims that "China must evaluate the survivability and
sufficiency of its nuclear arsenal. China must also consider what kind
of nuclear capability can ensure the mutual deterrence between the two
countries." 29 Other PLA strategists are more blunt in their
recommendations. As proposed by Hou Xiaohe and Zhang Hui from the PLA
National Defense University, "[[We must]{.mark} first [massively
improve]{.mark} the development and modernization of [our strategic
weapons, increase the accuracy and penetration ability of our]{.mark}
medium and long range [missiles]{.mark} to allow our lance to pierce the
shield of missile defense, and thereby restore strategic nuclear balance
between China and the United States]{.underline}." 30 More specifically,
[Hou and Zhang suggest that [China needs to "develop nuclear
missiles]{.mark} equipped [with multiple warheads to overwhelm the US
defensive system]{.mark}."]{.underline}

[China is the only nuclear weapon state recognized by the
Nonproliferation Treaty that is actively expanding its nuclear
arsenal.]{.underline} Its nuclear forces have increased modestly from an
estimated [130 to 200
warheads](http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/00963402.2006.11460990)

to [260
today](http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/00963402.2016.1194054).
The [qualitative
changes](http://carnegieendowment.org/2015/04/01/china-s-offensive-missile-forces-pub-59613)
to its nuclear forces have been more significant, with the introduction
of more mobile solid-fueled missiles, multiple independently targetable
reentry vehicles (MIRVs), and [an emerging fleet of nuclear-powered
ballistic missile submarines
(SSBNs](http://ndupress.ndu.edu/Media/News/Article/1013472/chinas-future-ssbn-command-and-control-structure/)).
[This modernization program has raised concerns]{.underline} over the
past several years [that **[China]{.mark} is currently attempting or
[might]{.mark} soon [attempt a nuclear breakout]{.mark}.** Concerns of a
Chinese breakout come in two forms: [either]{.mark} that [Beijing will
develop a nuclear warfighting capability that could neutralize U.S.
conventional superiority, or]{.mark} that Beijing [will expand its
strategic arsenal to achieve parity with the U]{.mark}nited
[S]{.mark}tates, [which could undercut U.S. security commitments
to]{.mark} its [regional allies]{.mark}.]{.underline} While China is
indeed in the midst of a significant modernization effort, [the
[changes]{.mark} to its nuclear forces [do not yet represent a
fundamental strategic shift]{.mark}. Rather, **[China's nuclear
evolution appears to be driven by a desire to maintain a secure
second-strike capability]{.mark} in the face of advancing U.S.
capabilities, which Beijing believes might threaten its nuclear
deterrent.**]{.underline} As I demonstrate in a [new article in the
Nonproliferation
Review](http://tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/10736700.2017.1371406),
China's nuclear arsenal and strategy are constrained by its limited
views of the utility of nuclear weapons. Moreover, Beijing would face
several "harder" technical constraints in pursuing the kind of nuclear
breakout about which some commentators warn. Concerns of an Impending
Chinese Breakout First, some [commentators [have
argued](http://nationalinterest.org/feature/welcome-china-americas-nuclear-nightmare-11891)
that China may be currently developing a nuclear warfighting capability,
or at least the nuclear arsenal to support one]{.underline}. A nuclear
warfighting capability can refer to either a force designed to attack an
adversary's nuclear arsenal, or a nuclear force designed for use on the
battlefield, though most commentators mean the latter when referring to
China. [These [developments]{.mark}]{.underline}, they argue, [[could
lead to China introducing nuclear weapons into an otherwise conventional
conflict]{.mark}.

believed that nuclear deterrence is largely [unaffected by the size and
configuration of the adversary's nuclear
arsenal](https://mitpress.mit.edu/books/minimum-means-reprisal), so long
as the country can threaten a counterstrike of a few --- or even one ---
nuclear warheads. Marshall Nie Rongzhen, a leading figure in China's
early nuclear weapons program, called this "[the minimum means of
reprisal](https://mitpress.mit.edu/sites/default/files/titles/content/9780262622028_sch_0001.pdf)."
[Recent
research](http://www.mitpressjournals.org/doi/abs/10.1162/ISEC_a_00215)
by Fiona Cunningham and M. Taylor Fravel, based on reviews of Chinese
doctrinal and academic writings and interviews with Chinese military and
civilian experts, indicates that these fundamental views have not
changed and that China is likely to continue adhering to its relatively
restrained strategy of "[assured
retaliation](http://www.mitpressjournals.org/doi/abs/10.1162/ISEC_a_00016)."
In [recent Track-1.5 and Track-2
dialogues](https://calhoun.nps.edu/bitstream/handle/10945/34335/2013%20005%20US-China%20Strategic%20Dialogue%20VII%20Report-Public.pdf?sequence=1#page=12)
between the United States and China, Chinese participants have said that
China could credibly threaten the United States with only "a few," a
"handful of," or even "one" nuclear warhead. Designed to support more
limited goals, China's nuclear forces are generally believed to be
smaller and less alerted than those of other states. The country has yet
to develop [an early warning
system](https://thediplomat.com/2015/05/strategic-warning-and-chinas-nuclear-posture/)
and some experts believe China would [wait several
days](https://www.sipri.org/sites/default/files/files/books/SIPRI03Zarimpas/SIPRI03Zarimpas.pdf#page=70)
after suffering a nuclear strike before launching its own nuclear
counterattack. Observers believe Beijing does [not mate its nuclear
warheads to missiles](https://www.armscontrol.org/act/2011_03/LiBin) in
peacetime, instead [storing them
separately](https://project2049.net/documents/chinas_nuclear_warhead_storage_and_handling_system.pdf).
According to the counting rules of the New START treaty, China has
[nearly zero deployed nuclear
weapons](https://www.armscontrol.org/act/2011_03/LiBin). [China's
ongoing nuclear modernization program is indeed significantly changing
the character and configuration of the country's nuclear forces. But
these changes appear to be driven by a desire to maintain the
survivability of the country's second-strike capability, not a
fundamentally new view of nuclear weapons in Beijing. **[[China has
identified]{.mark}](https://fas.org/nuke/guide/china/sms-2013.pdf#page=189)

[[b]{.mark}allistic [m]{.mark}issile
[d]{.mark}efen[s]{.mark}e](http://www.ucsusa.org/sites/default/files/legacy/assets/documents/nwgs/china-missile-defense.pdf)
[as serious threats to its nuclear forces]{.mark}**[.]{.mark} Regardless
of whether these concerns are reasonable, they appear sincere. By
deploying more mobile missiles, [China hopes to]{.mark} increase the
survivability of its overall deterrent. By deploying SSBNs and equipping
some of its land-based missiles with [MIRV
capability](https://thebulletin.org/what-if-china-develops-mirvs8133),
it hopes to [enhance its ability to penetrate U.S. missile
defenses]{.mark}.]{.underline} Hard Constraints In addition to these
"softer" political constraints on a Chinese nuclear breakout, China
would face several "harder" technical barriers to both developing a
nuclear warfighting capability and undertaking a sprint to parity. A
nuclear warfighting capability would require China to deploy a more
diversified nuclear force, with smaller-yield warheads affixed to more
accurate missiles. However, the country's current warhead designs,
designed for the more limited strategy of assured retaliation, are too
heavy and too powerful. During the Cold War, the average yield of U.S.
tactical weapons was [reported to be 4
kilotons](https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/politics/1978/12/11/natos-atomic-stockpile-primarily-political-weapons/9fceeb3b-3b62-484b-8f2b-26ecf0f35616/?utm_term=.9c1eba8f95d3),
and NATO war planners set an upper [limit of 10
kilotons](http://ssi.armywarcollege.edu/pdffiles/pub1103.pdf#page=69)
for bombs that could be used on their own territory. More recently, the
nuclear warhead for the U.S. Tomahawk cruise missile had a variable
yield of 5 to 150 kilotons and weighed 130 kilograms. By comparison,
China's smallest nuclear warhead is estimated to have a yield of 200 to
300 kilotons and to weigh 500 kilograms. China's [record of nuclear
weapons
testing](http://physicstoday.scitation.org/doi/full/10.1063/1.2982122)
does not give it an ideal basis for developing reliable, smaller, modern
designs. Most of China's tests involved heavy, high-yield devices.
Beijing did successfully test an [enhanced radiation
device](http://ndupress.ndu.edu/Portals/68/Documents/stratperspective/china/ChinaPerspectives-8.pdf)
in the late 1980s that could serve as the technical foundation for
tactical nuclear weapons, though it's not clear this design would be
suitable for developing a robust warfighting arsenal. Even if China were
to rely on this design, it might face production constraints stemming
from limited tritium and fissile material stockpiles. China might choose
to resume nuclear testing to develop newer warhead designs, but it would
take time and resources to design and certify new warheads, and the
international community would detect any new testing. Finally, China
generally lacks the supporting infrastructure needed to employ a nuclear
warfighting capability. Such a capability would require developing new
technical capabilities, organizational arrangements, and operational
practices, which China has generally avoided. For instance, a nuclear
warfighting capability would likely require more flexible command and
control arrangements, including delegating more authority to military
commanders, as Pakistan has done to support its ["asymmetric escalation"
strategy](http://www.mitpressjournals.org/doi/abs/10.1162/isec.2010.34.3.38).
By contrast, China has prioritized strict political control over its
nuclear weapons, keeping its [nuclear forces somewhat
insulated](http://ndupress.ndu.edu/JFQ/Joint-Force-Quarterly-83/Article/969665/pla-reforms-and-chinas-nuclear-forces/)
from its conventional ones. China would face similar constraints in
attempting a strategic sprint to parity. The most significant challenge
is its limited fissile material stockpile. China's modern warhead
designs use plutonium fuel, but analysts believe Beijing last produced
weapons-grade plutonium in 1991 and that it currently maintains a
[stockpile of only 1.8 metric
tons](http://fissilematerials.org/library/gfmr15.pdf). In addition,
China has relied on [conservative warhead
designs](http://scienceandglobalsecurity.org/archive/sgs02degeer.pdf)
that use more fuel than other countries' warheads. Given these high fuel
requirements and its limited stockpile, in a best-case scenario China
could produce no more than 250 to 450 plutonium-based warheads. China
could resort to using uranium-based designs, though it faces a limited
uranium stockpile as well. More significantly, the uranium designs it
has tested in the past were relatively unsophisticated and ill-suited
for a modern arsenal. To develop modern and reliable uranium-based
warheads, China would likely have to resort again to testing new
designs. Certainly, [**[China possesses the]{.mark}** underlying
[**economic, industrial, and technological bases** on which
**to**]{.mark} either **[develop a nuclear warfighting
capability]{.mark}** or attempt a sprint to parity.
However]{.underline}, attempting either form of nuclear breakout would
entail significant changes to China's nuclear program, possibly
including developing new warheads, resuming weapons testing, renewing
weapons-grade fissile material production, and significantly changing
operational practices. Given China's [historically conservative
approach](https://csis-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/s3fs-public/legacy_files/files/publication/111123_Jansson_NuclearScholar_web.pdf#page=174)
to its nuclear weapons program, [it appears unlikely that it could
undertake a]{.underline} military significant [nuclear
breakout]{.underline} in the near term or accomplish one in the long
term [without being detected.]{.underline} Analysts who have warned of
an impending nuclear breakout may be assuming that China's ongoing
modernization program is more expansive than it is, conflating a push
for greater survivability with a desire for "usability," or viewing the
modest quantitative growth in China's arsenal as a prelude to something
much more expansive. Certainly, China has made tremendous progress in
developing and deploying advanced ballistic missile systems, which would
be a crucial component of any nuclear warfighting capability. Indeed,
[some
observers](https://www.rand.org/content/dam/rand/pubs/research_reports/RR1600/RR1628/RAND_RR1628.pdf#page=129)
worry that the hardware and operational practices associated with the
conventional force could bleed over and end up benefitting the nuclear
force. But a broader review of the other technical requirements of
either developing a nuclear warfighting capability or pursuing strategic
parity suggests China would nonetheless face harder obstacles. Policy
Implications The constraints on China's nuclear forces have important
implications for U.S. policy. Policy decisions should rest on realistic
threat assessments of China's nuclear program and avoid provoking
self-fulfilling prophecies. Washington should recognize the constraints
on Beijing's nuclear policy and work to reinforce those constraints and
maintain strategic stability. First, [observers should watch for
indicators that China is fundamentally altering its approach to nuclear
weapons. This could include more obvious moves such as the resumption of
production of military fissile material, new rounds of nuclear weapons
testing, or a shift in political statements about the purpose of China's
nuclear weapons.]{.underline} Important indicators might also be
subtler, such as [changes in the organization and operation of the
military
organizations](http://www.npolicy.org/article.php?aid=1258&rid=2) that
operate China's nuclear weapons. Second, the United States should
attempt to strengthen and reinforce the constraints on China's program.
[Ratifying the Comprehensive Test Ban
Treaty](http://foreignpolicy.com/2016/04/22/the-united-states-needs-to-step-up-and-ratify-the-nuclear-test-ban-treaty-china/)
would strengthen the international norm against testing, while [funding
the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty
Organization](https://www.armscontrol.org/Issue-Briefs/2017-05/us-support-ctbto-enhances-us-global-security)
increases the chance of detecting tests should they occur. (Though it
would likely be more difficult to detect small-yield tests of tactical
warheads compared to the massive tests of China's past, the history of
the international monitoring system is cause for optimism. For example,
it detected North Korea's 2006 nuclear test, which had [an estimated
yield of only 0.6
kilotons](https://www.armscontrol.org/issuebriefs/CTBT-Myths-vs-Realities).)
The United States should also attempt to stem the rise of [reprocessing
in East
Asia](https://thebulletin.org/confronting-plutonium-nationalism-northeast-asia9617),
which could raise regional anxieties by lowering the barriers to some
states producing nuclear bombs. Finally, [**policymakers should
recognize that [Chinese nuclear policies are driven]{.mark}** in part
**[by perceived threats from the U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates**
itself. **Expanding** conventional prompt global strike,
**[b]{.mark}allistic [m]{.mark}issile [d]{.mark}efen[s]{.mark}e, and the

based on assumptions of an impending Chinese nuclear breakout should be
met with skepticism. [Rather than exacerbating these dynamics, **[the

#### Nuclear war with China results in millions killed, radiation poising, and a nuclear winter. 

**Wittner 11** (Professor of History @ State University of New
York-Albany, Lawrence S. Wittner, "Is a Nuclear War with China
Possible?," Huntington News, Monday, November 28, 2011 - 18:37 pg.
http://www.huntingtonnews.net/14446)

[While nuclear weapons exist, there remains a danger that they will be
used]{.underline}. After all, for centuries national conflicts have led
to wars, with nations employing their deadliest weapons. The current
[deterioration of U.S. relations with China might end up providing us
with yet another example of this phenomenon.]{.underline}

[The gathering tension between the United States and China is
clear]{.underline} enough. [Disturbed by China's growing economic and
military strength, the U.S. government recently challenged China's
claims in the South China Sea, increased the U.S. military presence in
Australia, and deepened U.S. military ties with other nations in the
Pacific region]{.underline}. According to Secretary of State Hillary
Clinton, the United States was "asserting our own position as a Pacific
power."

But need this lead to nuclear war?

Not necessarily. And yet, there are signs that it could. After all,
bot[h the United States and China possess large numbers of nuclear
weapons.]{.underline} [The U.S.]{.underline} government th[reatened to
attack China with nuclear weapons during the Korean War
and]{.underline}, later, [during the conflict over the future of China's
offshore islands, Quemoy and Matsu.]{.underline} In the midst of the
latter confrontation, President Dwight Eisenhower declared publicly, and
chillingly, that U.S. nuclear weapons would "be used just exactly as you
would use a bullet or anything else."

Of course, China didn't have nuclear weapons then. Now that it does,
perhaps the behavior of national leaders will be more temperate. But
[the loose nuclear threats of U.S. and Soviet government officials
during the Cold War, when both nations had vast nuclear arsenals, should
convince us that, even as the military ante is raised, nuclear
saber-rattling persists.]{.underline}

Some pundits argue that nuclear weapons prevent wars between
nuclear-armed nations; and, admittedly, there haven't been very
many---at least not yet. But [the Kargil War of 1999, between
nuclear-armed India and nuclear-armed Pakistan, should convince us that
such wars can occur]{.underline}. Indeed, in that case, [the conflict
almost slipped into a nuclear war.]{.underline} Pakistan's foreign
secretary threatened that, if the war escalated, his country felt free
to use "any weapon" in its arsenal. During the conflict, Pakistan did
move nuclear weapons toward its border, while India, it is claimed,
readied its own nuclear missiles for an attack on Pakistan.

At the least, though, don't nuclear weapons deter a nuclear attack? Do
they? Obviously, NATO leaders didn't feel deterred, for, throughout the
Cold War, NATO's strategy was to respond to a Soviet conventional
military attack on Western Europe by launching a Western nuclear attack
on the nuclear-armed Soviet Union. Furthermore, if U.S. government
officials really believed that nuclear deterrence worked, they would not
have resorted to championing "Star Wars" and its modern variant,
national missile defense. Why are these vastly expensive---and probably
unworkable---military defense systems needed if other nuclear powers are
deterred from attacking by U.S. nuclear might?

Of course, the bottom line for those Americans convinced that nuclear
weapons safeguard them from a Chinese nuclear attack might be that the
U.S. nuclear arsenal is far greater than its Chinese counterpart. Today,
it is estimated that the U.S. government possesses over five thousand
nuclear warheads, while the Chinese government has a total inventory of
roughly three hundred. Moreover, only about forty of these Chinese
nuclear weapons can reach the United States. Surely the United States
would "win" any nuclear war with China.

But what would that "victory" entail? [[A nuclear attack by China would
immediately slaughter at least 10 million Americans]{.mark} in a great
storm of blast and fire, while [leaving many more dying]{.mark} horribly
[of sickness and radiation poisoning]{.mark}]{.underline}. [[The Chinese
death toll]{.mark}]{.underline} in a nuclear war [[would be far higher.
Both]{.mark} nations [would be reduced to smoldering, radioactive
wastelands]{.mark}.]{.underline} Also, [[radioactive debris]{.mark} sent
aloft by the nuclear explosions [would blot out the sun and bring on a
"nuclear winter"]{.mark} [around the globe---destroying agriculture,
creating worldwide famine, and generating chaos and
destruction]{.mark}.]{.underline}

Moreover, [[in another decade the extent of this catastrophe would
be]{.mark} far [worse.]{.mark} The Chinese government is currently
expanding its nuclear arsenal]{.underline}, and by the year 2020 it is
expected to more than double its number of nuclear weapons that can hit
the United States. [The U.S. government, in turn, has plans to spend
hundreds of billions of dollars "modernizing" its nuclear weapons and
nuclear production facilities over the next decade]{.underline}

#### Aegis Ashore is the tipping point of BMD modernization -- causes buildup of ICBMS and ballistic missiles, nuclear arsenal expansion, and the adoption of launch-on-warning policies by China.

I[f deployed on a small number of offshore ships or at Aegis Ashore
facilities, using the long-range GMD radars for determining approximate
intercept points, Block IIA could cover the entire United
States.]{.underline} According to Rondell Wilson, lead engineer for air
and missile defense products at Raytheon (the manufacturer of the SM-3
Block IIA), "We can provide the SM-3 Block \[II\]A ashore as an
under-layer capability for \[ground-based interceptors\]... . We can do
that immediately (Drew and Dimascio 2017 Drew, J., and J. Dimascio.
2017. "New Trajectory: As Pentagon Adds Dollars for Missile Defense,
Raytheon Pitches SM-3s as ICBM Killers." Aviation Week and Space
Technology 179 (20): 58.

." Congress has recently mandated that, "if technologically feasible,"
the Block IIA missile be tested against an ICBM-range missile (US House
of Representatives 2017 US House of Representatives. 2017. "National
Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2018, Conference Report to

[The [Block IIA]{.mark} interceptors [are intended for
deployment]{.mark} on the more than 85 Aegis ships that the US Navy
plans to operate, as well as [at]{.mark} land-based [Aegis Ashore
missile defense sites]{.mark}]{.underline}. [The interceptors,
therefore, are to be deployed in much larger numbers than the GMD
interceptors -- totaling perhaps 400 or more, based upon the premise
that each Aegis BMD ship has at least 90 vertical launcher cells that
can house variety of weapons]{.underline}. If, on average, five of these
cells on each ship housed Block IIA interceptors, the total would be 425
plus whatever Block IIAs were deployed at Aegis Ashore sites, as Figure
2 illustrates (Lewis 2018 Lewis, G. 2018. "Update to 'How Many SM-3
Block IIA Interceptors?'" mostlymissiledefense blog, May 20.

[Russia, when it signed New START in 2010, had nearly 50 times more
strategic nuclear ballistic missile warheads than the United States had
strategic-capable interceptors. Nevertheless, Russia stipulated that the
treaty]{.underline} (US Defense Department n.d. US Defense Department.
n.d. "New Start: Article-by-Article Analysis Unilateral Statements."

[...may be effective and viable only in conditions where there is no
qualitative and quantitative build-up in the missile defense
capabilities of the United States \[and that\] the 'extraordinary
events' that could justify \[Russian\] withdrawal from the Treaty...
include a build-up in the missile defense system capabilities of the
United States that would give rise to a threat to the strategic nuclear
forces potential of the Russian Federation.]{.underline}

[The [US b]{.mark}allistic [m]{.mark}issile [d]{.mark}efense
[build-up]{.mark} [could]{.mark} similarly [lead China to significantly
increase the number and capabilities of its strategic ballistic
missiles]{.mark}.]{.underline} China already has been deploying
additional ICBM warheads and has begun deploying submarine-launched
ballistic missiles. [China's [development of ICBMs with multiple
warheads is]{.mark} widely viewed as, at least in part, [a response to
the US b]{.mark}allistic [m]{.mark}issile [d]{.mark}efense
[program]{.mark}.]{.underline}

[While Russia and [China]{.mark} understand the likely effectiveness of
countermeasures against the current US ballistic missile defense system,
they [harbor concerns about the US program's completely open-ended
nature]{.mark}]{.underline}. [[They]{.mark} also [are]{.mark} [concerned
that US leaders, in the belief that their defenses are effective, could
act]{.mark} more [aggressively]{.mark}]{.underline}. [In April, the
Russian Foreign Ministry issued a statement expressing concern on this
issue]{.underline} (ITAR-TASS 2018 ITAR-TASS. 2018. "US' Missile Shield
Gives it Wrong Feeling of Impunity and Invincibility -- Russian Foreign
Ministry." April 24.

[The risk is that the availability of [a missile shield may give]{.mark}
grounds for [a]{.mark} vile [feeling of invincibility]{.mark} and
impunity [and]{.mark}, hence, [lure Washington into new dangerous
unilateral steps to achieve its goals on]{.mark} the global and regional
levels]{.underline}...

In fact, US political leaders are not being told about the vulnerability
of US ballistic missile defense systems to simple countermeasures. In
February, Gen. Lori Robinson, commander of the US Northern Command --
responsible for defending the United States against ballistic missiles
-- told Congress that she was "100 percent confident" in her ability to
defend the United States from a North Korean ballistic missile attack
(Robinson 2018 Robinson, L. 2018. "United States Northern Command and
United States Southern Command." Hearing before the Committee on Armed
Services, February 15. Stenographic Transcript.

In October 2017, President Trump, discussing the North Korean ICBM
threat, stated that "We have missiles that can knock out a missile in
the air 97 percent of the time..." (Kessler 2017 Kessler, G. 2017. "Fact
Checker: Trump's Claim that a US Interceptor Can Knock Out ICBMs '97

[Thus, [large-scale deployment]{.mark} by the United States [of

[s]{.mark}ystems [could lock the world into high numbers of nuclear

#### Aegis Ashore is uniquely destabilizing -- it's more advanced than Aegis-equipped destroyers, and other Northeast Asian countries perceive it as a major security threat

**Brown,** **18** (James D. J, associate professor in political science
at Temple University Japan and a specialist on Russo-Japanese relations,
The Case Against Aegis Ashore, Shingetsu News Agency,
http://shingetsunewsagency.com/2018/08/20/the-case-against-aegis-ashore/)

SNA (Tokyo) --- While the Abe administration presents [[Aegis
Ashore]{.underline}]{.mark} as an essential and relatively
uncontroversial contribution to the defense of Japan from the North
Korean threat, in reality the deployment of this missile defense system
[[risks further destabilizing the security situation in Northeast
Asia]{.underline},]{.mark} especially with regard to Russia. In December
2017, the Japanese government formally decided to purchase Aegis Ashore,
the US-made ground-based ballistic missile defense system. It is
anticipated that two units will be installed, with Akita and Yamaguchi
prefectures identified as the candidate sites. The first of these
deployments is planned to be completed during fiscal 2023. The Abe
administration has justified the purchase of this system as a necessary
response to the growth in the missile threat from North Korea. [[Japan
has two existing missile defense systems, but each has
limitations]{.underline}]{.mark}. [The first of these is [the Patriot
PAC-3]{.mark}, which [can intercept incoming missiles during their
terminal phase. The units]{.mark} are mobile but [provide limited
coverage]{.mark}]{.underline}, meaning that [[they]{.mark} can [offer
protection to specific sites]{.mark}]{.underline}, such as central Tokyo
or military installations, [but [not]{.mark}]{.underline} to [[the
country as a whole. The PAC-3 system is]{.underline}]{.mark} therefore
[[combined with Aegis-equipped destroyers]{.underline}]{.mark}, whose
interceptors can eliminate missiles during their mid-course phase.
[[This system]{.underline}]{.mark} can theoretically provide cover for
all of Japan, but it [[is dependent on keeping]{.mark} the
Aegis-equipped [ships on a continual cycle of deployment]{.mark} in
specific areas, [something that places an enormous burden on Japan's
Maritime Self-Defense Forces]{.mark}]{.underline}. As such, [there is an
apparent logic in purchasing a third system that can provide constant
protection for all of Japan]{.underline}ese territory. Additionally,
[t[he Aegis Ashore system has superior capabilities and range than the
existing Aegis-equipped destroyers]{.mark}]{.underline}. In particular,
it is claimed that [[it is better at dealing with simultaneous launches
as well as missiles on a lofted trajectory]{.underline}]{.mark}, both
things that North Korea has simulated in recent missile tests. Presented
this way, it appears hard to argue with the decision to adopt Aegis
Ashore. Yet, as time has passed, the chorus of opposition has grown
louder. Voices of Opposition One criticism is that [the introduction of
the missile defense system runs counter to the current trend of reduced
tensions on the Korean Peninsula]{.underline}. Indeed, some may argue
that Aegis Ashore is now superfluous following the meeting between
President Donald Trump and Chairman Kim Jong-Un in Singapore in June at
which the North Korean leader agreed "to work toward complete
denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula." This is, however, a weak
argument since it is far from certain that the North Korean commitment
in Singapore was sincere. Furthermore, even if denuclearization were to
proceed smoothly, Pyongyang would still retain a dangerous arsenal of
non-nuclear missiles that are capable of reaching Japan. A more
convincing criticism is of the cost of the system. [It was always known
that Aegis Ashore would be expensive, but the extent is only now
becoming clear.]{.underline} At the end of July, sources in the Ministry
of Defense revealed that the estimated cost of the two Aegis Ashore
units had been revised up by around 70%. With the inclusion of other
elements, such as the interceptor missiles, [the total cost of the
project is now expected to exceed 600 billion yen (US\$5.4
billion]{.underline}). [This is an extraordinary spending commitment in
a country where government debt was equivalent to 253% of GDP in
2017,]{.underline} and where the Abe administration pretends to be
pursuing the goal of a fiscal surplus by 2025. Separately, there are
concerns within the local communities near where the Aegis Ashore
batteries are set to be located. These center on the extent to which the
presence of the missile defense units will make their area a target for
foreign military planners. Additionally, there are worries about the
health effects of the powerful, but largely unproven, Lockheed Martin
Solid State Radar that the Japanese government has selected for use with
the Aegis Ashore units. A Destabilizing Factor in Northeast Asia Both
the expense of the system and its potential health implications are
genuine concerns, but [perhaps [the most serious worry about Aegis
Ashore is the destabilizing effect]{.mark} it could have [on Northeast
Asian security. The Japanese government insists that it is a purely
defensive system]{.mark}, which will be [under Japan's exclusive
control. This is not]{.mark},]{.underline} however, [[the view of
Japan's neighbors]{.underline}.]{.mark} Tokyo's decision to invest
further in US missile defense has been criticized by both China and
North Korea. However, the most strident and sustained condemnation of
Aegis Ashore has come from Russia. Russia is the only peer of the United
States when it comes to nuclear weapons, and it has come to rely ever
more on its vast strategic arsenal since it lost the conventional
superiority that the Soviet Union enjoyed over the West in Europe.
Moreover, as the United States has demonstrated its willingness to use
military force internationally since the 1990s, Russia has come to
regard its nuclear capabilities as a vital means of deterring US
interventionism. This has become all the more important following the
recent increase in tensions between Russia and the West, and
Washington's explicit identification of Russia as an adversary. For this
reason, Russian strategists regard US missile defense systems as a
leading threat to national security. From Moscow's perspective, the
United States is engaged in a long-term project to undermine Russia's
strategic deterrent and thereby give itself a free hand to act without
fear of Russian retaliation. The crucial step in this regard was the
decision of President George W. Bush in 2002 to withdraw from the
Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty. Signed in 1972, this agreement had barred
Washington and Moscow from deploying nationwide defenses against
strategic ballistic missiles. The treaty's preamble described this as a
"substantial factor in curbing the race in strategic offensive arms."
During the years since this withdrawal, Moscow believes that the United
States has worked assiduously to surround Russia with elements of its
expanding missile defense system. Some of these units have been
installed within the United States itself, while others have been
planned for deployment on the territory of US allies. The Russian
authorities claim that the US justifies these deployments by using the
excuse that the missile defense systems are needed to protect allies
from the threat of rogue states. In Europe, Iran is the supposed threat;
in East Asia, it is North Korea. In each case, Russia believes that it
is the real target. [[Aegis Ashore is]{.underline}]{.mark} therefore
[[seen as]{.mark} just [the latest link in the United States' expanding
network of missile defense systems]{.mark}]{.underline}[,]{.mark} and
Moscow is dismissive of Tokyo's claim that it will be an independent
Japanese system. This view was expressed by Foreign Minister Sergey
Lavrov in January 2018, when he told journalists that, "We don't know
any cases anywhere in this world where the United States, having
deployed its weapons systems, would hand the control over them to a host
country. I have strong doubts that they will make an exception in this
case." [This view will only have strengthened when Isao [Iijima, a
special advisor to]{.mark} Prime []{.mark}Minister Shinzo [Abe, told the
media]{.mark} in June [that the decision to purchase Aegis Ashore was
pushed upon Japan by]{.mark} [the U]{.mark}nited
[S]{.mark}tates.]{.underline} Prior to the final decision being taken,
Russia intensively lobbied the Abe administration not to agree to
purchase further US missile defense systems. This included the warning
by Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu in March 2017 that [[the deployment of
such systems "will destroy the balance in the Pacific
region.]{.mark}"]{.underline} Having ignored these words of caution,
Japan must expect some consequences. This was made clear immediately
after the announcement of Japan's decision to purchase the system when
[Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Sergei Ryabkov stated that Aegis Ashore
will create "a new situation, which we logically must take account of in
our military planning]{.underline}." At the same time, Maria Zakharova,
chief spokeswoman for the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, warned that the
decision "will have a negative impact on the overall atmosphere of
bilateral relations, including negotiations on the issue of a peace
treaty." Although no explicit link has been made, it is likely that the
recent intensification of the Russian military presence on the disputed
Southern Kuriles is connected with the Aegis Ashore decision. In
particular, in January 2018, the Russian government issued a directive
which designates the airport on the island of Iturup (Etorofu in
Japanese) as dual-use. This opens the way for it to be used for military
jets and, sure enough, Su-35S fighters were deployed to the island in
July. Similarly, it is possible that Russia's foot-dragging on the
implementation of joint economic activities with Japan on the disputed
islands is also a response to Aegis Ashore. This may be seen as an
effective way of punishing the Japanese government since Prime Minister
Abe has made the joint projects a prominent feature of his foreign
policy and has presented them as a stepping stone to the resolution of
the territorial dispute. Causing a setback to bilateral relations with
Russia might be a price worth paying if Aegis Ashore were to radically
improve Japan's security situation. In reality, however, it will not. No
Lasting Gain in Security Although [[Aegis Ashore]{.mark} would
undoubtedly enhance the technical capabilities of Japanese missile
defense, the system [can]{.mark} still [only deal with a limited number
of missiles and is not 100% reliable]{.mark}.]{.underline} As such,
[just as [Japan's sense of security did not meaningfully change after
the]{.mark} billions that were spent on [PAC-3 and the Aegis-equipped
destroyers, so it will be with Aegis Ashore]{.mark}]{.underline}.
Indeed, [[any small gain in security is certain to be swiftly eroded
as]{.mark} those [countries that feel threatened by Aegis Ashore adapt
their behavior or introduce more sophisticated weapons systems to
overcome Japan's additional layer of missile
defense]{.mark}]{.underline}. In no time at all, the military experts
will be arguing that Japan needs to spend yet more billions on some
other new system that also offers no more than a fleeting illusion of
security. In other words, Japan will simply have contributed to an
emerging arms race and to the intensification of nuclear tensions
between the United States and Russia. There is no question that [Japan
is genuinely facing a threatening security environment. However, there
is no technical fix to this problem]{.underline}. Instead, [lasting
security can only be achieved through diplomacy, confidence building,
and mutual threat reduction.]{.underline} Ultimately, [[Aegis Ashore is
a]{.mark}n enormously expensive [means of creating insecurity for others
while generating little added security for Japan]{.mark}
itself]{.underline}. There remains time for Japan to reconsider this
decision. It should do so as a matter of urgency.

[Although China, Russia, and the United States have]{.underline}
together [experienced numerous crises]{.underline} and tensions since
the end of the Cold War, [one important reason that each state has
refrained from employing military force directly against the others is
their robust nuclear deterrents and survivable "second-strike"
capabilities---their assured ability to retaliate effectively with their
own nuclear forces even if they were attacked first]{.underline}.
Furthermore, US extended nuclear security guarantees---Washington's
promise to protect its allies against nuclear threats with nuclear
forces, if necessary---has dissuaded other potential nuclear weapons
states, namely Japan and South Korea, from pursuing their own nuclear
weapons capability. Despite doubts, these countries have continued to
place their faith in Washington's will and capacity to defend them
against North Korea and other threats. However, [[new military
tech]{.mark}nologies [such as missile defenses, anti-satellite
weapons]{.mark}, and hypersonic missile systems,]{.underline} could
[[raise the risks of nuclear weapons use]{.mark} in future
crises]{.underline}, especially if accompanied by certain risk-acceptant
operational concepts. Ballistic missile defense ([BMD) systems may
convince their possessors that they could launch a disarming first
strike---expecting their missile shields to protect them against any
retaliatory strikes. Hypersonic delivery systems present]{.underline}
new [challenges for crisis stability due to their rapid speed and
unpredictable flight paths]{.underline}. Furthermore, [states have
incentives to use cyber weapons early in a conflict to
exploit]{.underline} any [vulnerabilities]{.underline} of their opponent
before their own can be neutralized by an enemy. [[States
may]{.underline}]{.mark} even [[consider launching their nuclear forces
before they have been attacked, such as on warning]{.mark} of an assault
[despite]{.mark} the [risks of misperception and
miscalculation]{.mark}]{.underline}. Chinese and Russian officials have
already complained about the allegedly disruptive nature of the
expanding US capabilities for missile defense, precision strikes, and
other strategic technologies. The [[strong US offensive
capabilities]{.mark}, both nuclear and conventional, [exacerbate these
concerns since they increase]{.mark} its [potential for successfully
pre-empting Chinese]{.mark} and Russian [nuclear
missiles]{.mark}]{.underline} before they have been
launched.[^2^](https://www.hudson.org/research/11307-arms-racing-in-strategic-technologies-asia-s-new-frontier#footNote2)
Experts believe that [the [Chinese share]{.mark} Russian [concerns
about]{.mark} "conventional counterforce" -- [US preemptive attacks
using non-nuclear]{.mark} hypersonic [weapons]{.mark} or even cruise
missiles [against the PLA's nuclear forces and]{.mark} command nodes and
then [using missile defenses to defeat a]{.mark}ny [ragged Chinese
counterstrike]{.mark}]{.underline}. Both countries are seeking to
overcome US offensive and defensive capabilities by actively researching
all these new strategic technologies for possible military application.
It is important not to exaggerate the potential for near-term
technological breakthroughs in these capabilities. By their very nature,
however, the pace and impact of these novel military weapons based on
revolutionary capabilities are hard to predict. Few existing treaties
explicitly constrain the quantitative or qualitative dimensions of these
new strategic technologies. [The best time to negotiate arms control
agreements limiting the development of potentially destabilizing systems
is before the weapons are deployed]{.underline}, but there are major
impediments to progress in this area.

#### Strategic stability collapse strongly incentivizes nuclear first strikes

**Weitz 15** (Richard Weitz, Center for Political-Military Analysis
Director, "Arms Racing in Strategic Technologies: Asia\'s New Frontier,"

Russian leaders have argued that US development of strategically
disruptive technologies such as hypersonic weapons, ballistic missile
defenses, and cyber weapons makes it harder for Moscow to accept more
cuts in offensive nuclear forces under any new arms control agreement.
Both Chinese and Russians fear that the expanding US strategic
capabilities threaten their capacity for assured nuclear retaliation and
thereby undermine their capacity to deter a direct US attack or
constrain US military interventions against other countries. [Though [US
BMD systems]{.mark} would have difficulty coping with a full-scale
Chinese or Russian missile strike, their [task would be much easier
following a US first strike that destroys many of the attackers'
missiles]{.mark} in their silos [and]{.mark}, through kinetic or cyber
strikes, [disrupts their strategic command-and-control
systems]{.mark}]{.underline}. In such a scenario, China or Russia might
even refrain from a retaliatory missile strike against the US homeland
since such a weak counterstrike could fail and provoke a full-scale
nuclear response. One way China and Russia can counter the risk of a US
pre-emptive strike with conventional, nuclear, or cyber weapons, and of
having their retaliatory missile strike weakened by US defenses, is to
deploy more and better missiles and nuclear warheads, making them more
capable of inflicting unacceptable damage on the United States. Yet,
[[some]{.mark} of their [responses]{.mark} can]{.underline} also [be
potentially destabilizing and [encourage first strikes,
including]{.mark} Russia's construction of massive liquid-fueled
missiles that are extremely vulnerable before launch, its arsenal of
potentially thousands of tactical nuclear weapons, [China's co-location
of]{.mark} its [conventional and nuclear systems, or any l]{.mark}aunch
[o]{.mark}n [w]{.mark}arning [tactics]{.mark}.]{.underline} Furthermore,
[China and Russia are developing [counter-space and offensive cyber
capabilities]{.mark} designed to attack US command and control systems,
which [could contribute to]{.mark} inadvertent [escalation in a
crisis]{.mark}]{.underline}[.]{.mark}

### Scenario 2 -- Kuril Islands

#### Aegis Ashore decks Japan-Russia bilateral relations.

**Brown,** **18** (James D. J, associate professor in political science
at Temple University Japan and a specialist on Russo-Japanese relations,
The Case Against Aegis Ashore, Shingetsu News Agency,
http://shingetsunewsagency.com/2018/08/20/the-case-against-aegis-ashore/)

SNA (Tokyo) --- While the Abe administration presents Aegis Ashore as an
essential and relatively uncontroversial contribution to the defense of
Japan from the North Korean threat, in reality [the deployment of [this
missile defense system risks]{.mark} further [destabilizing the security
situation]{.mark} in Northeast Asia, especially [with regard to
Russia]{.mark}.]{.underline}

[In December 2017, the Japanese government formally decided to purchase
Aegis Ashore]{.underline}, the US-made ground-based ballistic missile
defense system. It is anticipated that two units will be installed, with
Akita and Yamaguchi prefectures identified as the candidate sites. [The
first of these deployments is planned to be completed during fiscal
2023.]{.underline}

The Abe administration has justified the purchase of this system as a
necessary response to the growth in the missile threat from North Korea.
Japan has two existing missile defense systems, but each has
limitations.

The first of these is the Patriot PAC-3, which can intercept incoming
missiles during their terminal phase. The units are mobile but provide
limited coverage, meaning that they can offer protection to specific
sites, such as central Tokyo or military installations, but not to the
country as a whole.

The PAC-3 system is therefore combined with Aegis-equipped destroyers,
whose interceptors can eliminate missiles during their mid-course phase.
This system can theoretically provide cover for all of Japan, but it is
dependent on keeping the Aegis-equipped ships on a continual cycle of
deployment in specific areas, something that places an enormous burden
on Japan's Maritime Self-Defense Forces.

As such, [there is an apparent logic in purchasing a third system that
can provide constant protection for all of Japanese
territory]{.underline}. Additionally[, the Aegis Ashore system has
superior capabilities and range than the existing Aegis-equipped
destroyers]{.underline}. In particular, it is claimed that it is better
at dealing with simultaneous launches as well as missiles on a lofted
trajectory, both things that North Korea has simulated in recent missile
tests.

Presented this way, it appears hard to argue with the decision to adopt
Aegis Ashore.

Yet, as time has passed, the chorus of opposition has grown louder.

Voices of Opposition

One criticism is that the introduction of the missile defense system
runs counter to the current trend of reduced tensions on the Korean
Peninsula. Indeed, some may argue that Aegis Ashore is now superfluous
following the meeting between President Donald Trump and Chairman Kim
Jong-Un in Singapore in June at which the North Korean leader agreed "to
work toward complete denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula."

This is, however, a weak argument since it is far from certain that the
North Korean commitment in Singapore was sincere. Furthermore, even if
denuclearization were to proceed smoothly, Pyongyang would still retain
a dangerous arsenal of non-nuclear missiles that are capable of reaching
Japan.

A more convincing criticism is of the cost of the system. It was always
known that Aegis Ashore would be expensive, but the extent is only now
becoming clear.

At the end of July, sources in the Ministry of Defense revealed that the
estimated cost of the two Aegis Ashore units had been revised up by
around 70%. With the inclusion of other elements, such as the
interceptor missiles, the total cost of the project is now expected to
exceed 600 billion yen (US\$5.4 billion).

This is an extraordinary spending commitment in a country where
government debt was equivalent to 253% of GDP in 2017, and where the Abe
administration pretends to be pursuing the goal of a fiscal surplus by
2025.

Separately, there are concerns within the local communities near where
the Aegis Ashore batteries are set to be located. These center on the
extent to which the presence of the missile defense units will make
their area a target for foreign military planners. Additionally, there
are worries about the health effects of the powerful, but largely
unproven, Lockheed Martin Solid State Radar that the Japanese government
has selected for use with the Aegis Ashore units.

A Destabilizing Factor in Northeast Asia

Both the expense of the system and its potential health implications are
genuine concerns, but perhaps the most serious worry about Aegis Ashore
is the destabilizing effect it could have on Northeast Asian security.
The Japanese government insists that it is a purely defensive system,
which will be under Japan's exclusive control. This is not, however, the
view of Japan's neighbors.

[Tokyo's decision to invest further in US missile defense has been
criticized by both China and North Korea. However, [the most strident
and sustained condemnation of Aegis Ashore has come from
Russia]{.mark}.]{.underline}

[Russia is the only peer of the United States when it comes to nuclear
weapons, and it has come to rely ever more on its vast strategic arsenal
since it lost the conventional superiority that the Soviet Union enjoyed
over the West in Europe]{.underline}. Moreover, [as the United States
has demonstrated its willingness to use military force internationally
since the 1990s, Russia has come to regard its nuclear capabilities as a
vital means of deterring US interventionism.]{.underline} [This has

his apprehension over the deployment of the [Terminal High-Altitude Area

system to South Korea. As I [reported
previously](https://thediplomat.com/2015/10/putins-visit-to-japan-indefinitely-postponed/),
the Russo-Japanese dispute over the islands has been going on for many
decades: The disputed Northern territories -- known in Japanese as the
Shikotan, Kunashiri, Etorofu and the Habomai islets -- located in the
Sea of Okhotsk in the Northwest Pacific, were seized by the Soviet Union
in 1945. By 1949 the Russians had expelled all 17,000 Japanese residents
of the islands. Under the 1951 San Francisco Peace Treaty, Tokyo
renounced "all right, title and claim to the Kuril Islands"; however,
Moscow never signed the peace treaty and Tokyo refused to concede that
the four disputed islands were in fact part of the Kuril chain. Japan
has repeatedly
[rejected](http://english.hani.co.kr/arti/english_edition/e_national/701312.html)
Moscow's offer to settle the dispute with the return of the two smallest
territories of the chain, Habomai and Shikotan. [[The increasing Russian

permanent basis) is just one item of a list of Japanese concerns
regarding Russian military activities on the islands. The Russian Navy
has also been considering establishing a permanent naval base for its
Pacific Fleet on one of the islands. Furthermore, the Russian MoD
announced that it [will deploy an army

#### Heightened tensions around the Kuril Islands risk World War 3.

[[World War II]{.mark} still [hasn't ended]{.mark}, yet [World War
III]{.mark} already [looms]{.mark}.]{.underline} When China and Japan
agreed to normalize relations in 1945, it was stipulated that the
disputed Senkaku/Diaoyu Islands (a string of uninhabited rocks
equidistant from Japan, China and Taiwan) would not be militarized and
the dispute would be put off for future generations. That future is
here. The recent discovery of large oil and gas reserves under the
islands has heated up the situation dramatically, with military budgets
surging, and warships, coast guards and fighter jets scrambling to
assert control over the commons.

Meanwhile, tensions on the Korean Peninsula have drastically escalated
into the world's most dangerous flashpoint over the past seven decades
precisely because the Korean War itself was never formally ended in
1953. Despite the recent summit between Moon Jae-in and Kim Jong-un,
neither South nor North Korea has yet to formally recognize the other's
existence, each claiming to be the sole legitimate government of the
entire Korean Peninsula. Similarly, the unresolved status of the
princely state of Kashmir at the time of the partition of South Asia
into independent India and Pakistan in 1947 has been the direct or
proximate cause of three major wars and a near nuclear standoff in 2001
between the postcolonial cousins.

These three major Asian fault lines are a reminder that the biggest risk
of conflict in the twenty-first century stems from unsettled conflicts
of the twentieth century. [[Asia is awash in]{.mark} other
still[-disputed territories]{.mark} and boundaries [such
as]{.mark}]{.underline} Arunachal Pradesh (between India and China,
which Beijing calls "South Tibet"), the Spratly and Paracel Islands in
the South China Sea (claimed by numerous Asian countries) and
[[the]{.mark} southern [Kuril Islands (where there is Russo-Japanese
friction]{.mark}, with Tokyo calling them the "Northern
Territories").]{.underline}

[[The world has been lucky that deterrence,]{.mark} economic integration
and a shared distaste for the past two centuries of Western domination
have [prevented Asia's major powers from crossing the
Rubicon]{.mark}.]{.underline} But rather than simply hope luck does not
run out, the solution to these tensions is to immediately seek permanent
settlement on peaceful terms.

[Ending interminably hot or cold wars requires a different approach to
diplomatic mediation than the ad hoc crisis management that has been the
norm in these and other conflicts.]{.underline} Indeed, there is a
significant leap from traditional mediation to outright settlement.
Mediating conflict without a settlement is like turning down the
temperature on a pressure cooker without switching it off: the food
inside will eventually burn and rot. The temperature can also be turned
back up, causing the top to eventually blow off. By contrast, settling a
conflict is like turning the stove off, removing the pressure cooker and
getting on with sharing the meal. Strategists focused on alliance
management and force posture would be well served to take a step back
and remember that military maneuvering is not an end in itself. More
fundamental than preparing for war is eliminating the need for it in the
first place.

#### US-Russia conflicts escalates to nuclear war -- extinction.

[The World is at a dangerous Crossroads.]{.underline}

[The Western military alliance is in an advanced state of readiness. And
so is Russia.]{.underline}

Russia is heralded as the "Aggressor". US-NATO military confrontation
with Russia is contemplated.

Enabling legislation in the US Senate under "The Russian Aggression
Prevention Act" (RAPA) has "set the US on a path towards direct military
conflict with Russia in Ukraine."

[[Any US-Russian war is likely to quickly escalate into a nuclear
war]{.mark}, since [neither the US nor Russia would be willing to admit
defeat, both have many]{.mark} thousands of [nuclear weapons ready for
instant use]{.mark}, and [both rely]{.mark} [upon Counterforce military
doctrine]{.mark} that tasks their military, in the event of war, to
preemptively destroy the nuclear forces of the enemy.]{.underline} (See
Steven Starr, Global Research, August 22, 2014)

The Russian Aggression Prevention Act (RAPA) is the culmination of more
than twenty years of US-NATO war preparations, which consist in the
military encirclement of both Russia and China:

[From the moment the Soviet Union collapsed in 1991, the United States
has relentlessly pursued a strategy of encircling Russia,]{.underline}
just as it has with other perceived enemies like China and Iran. It has
brought 12 countries in central Europe, all of them formerly allied with
Moscow, into the NATO alliance. US military power is now directly on
Russia's borders. (Steven Kinzer, Boston Globe, March 3, 2014, emphasis
added)

On July 24, in consultation with the Pentagon, NATO's Europe commander
General Philip Breedlove called for "stockpiling a base in Poland with
enough weapons, ammunition and other supplies to support a rapid
deployment of thousands of troops against Russia".(RT, July 24, 2014).
According to General Breedlove, NATO needs "pre-positioned supplies,
pre-positioned capabilities and a basing area ready to rapidly accept
follow-on forces":

"He plans to recommend placing supplies --- weapons, ammunition and
ration packs --- at the headquarters to enable a sudden influx of
thousands of Nato troops" (Times, August 22, 2014, emphasis added)

Breedlove's "Blitzkrieg scenario" is to be presented at NATO's summit in
Wales in early September, according to The London Times. It is a "copy
and paste" text broadly consistent with the Russian Aggression
Prevention Act (RAPA) which directs President Obama to:

"(1) implement a plan for increasing U.S. and NATO support for the armed
forces of Poland, Estonia, Lithuania, and Latvia, and other NATO
member-states; and

\(2\) direct the U.S. Permanent Representative to NATO to seek
consideration for permanently basing NATO forces in such countries."
(S.2277 --- 113th Congress (2013-2014))

More generally[, [a scenario of military escalation prevails with both
sides involved in extensive war
games]{.underline}]{.mark}[.]{.underline}

In turn, the structure of US sponsored military alliances plays a
crucial role in war planning. We are dealing with a formidable military
force involving a global alliance of 28 NATO member states. In turn, the
US as well as NATO have established beyond the "Atlantic Region" a
network of bilateral military alliances with "partner" countries
directed against Russia, China, Iran and North Korea.

### General BMDs

#### BMDs escalate tensions with Russia and China.

**Kelly 12/11/2017** (Tim Kelly, Tokyo-based Reuters Senior
Correspondent, "Russian military chief criticizes U.S., Japan and South
Korea drills," Reuters,
<https://www.reuters.com/article/us-northkorea-missiles-japan-russia/russian-military-chief-criticizes-u-s-japan-and-south-korea-drills-idUSKBN1E50X9>)

TOKYO (Reuters) - [Russia's military chief warned on Monday that
military exercises by Japan, the United States and South Korea aimed at
countering North Korea only raise hysteria and create more instability
in the region]{.underline}. Russian Chief of the General Staff of the
Armed Forces General Valery Gerasimov, issued his warning in Tokyo as
the United States, Japan and South Korea began a two-day exercise to
practice tracking missiles amid rising tension over North Korea's
weapons programs. "[Carrying out military training in regions
surrounding North Korea will only heighten hysteria and make the
situation unstable," Gerasimov said]{.underline} at the beginning of a
meeting with Japanese Minister of Defence Itsunori Onodera. [This week's
exercise by the United States and its two Asian allies, in which they
will share information on tracking ballistic missiles, comes just days
after large-scale drills by U.S. and South Korean forces that North
Korea said made the outbreak of war "an established fact".]{.underline}
North Korea says its weapons programs are necessary to counter U.S.
aggression. On Nov. 29, North Korea test-fired its latest ballistic
missile, which it said was its most advanced yet, capable of reaching
the mainland United States. [China has]{.underline} also [repeatedly
called for the United States and South Korea to stop their exercises,
which North Korea sees as preparation for an invasion]{.underline}.
Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Lu Kang, asked in Beijing about the
latest U.S., South Korean and Japanese drills, said the situation was in
a vicious cycle that if followed to a conclusion would not be in
anyone's interests. "All relevant parties should do is still to
completely, precisely and fully implement the relevant U.N. Security
Council resolutions toward North Korea, and do more for regional peace
and stability and to get all parties back to the negotiating table. Not
the opposite, mutual provocation," Lu said. Gerasimov's visit to Japan
is the first by a senior Russian military official in seven years and
follows the resumption of "two-plus-two" defense and foreign minister
talks in March after Russia annexed Crimea. Relations between Russia and
Japan have been hampered for decades over the ownership of four islands
north of Japan's Hokkaido, captured by Soviet forces at the end of World
War Two. Japan has declined to sign a formal peace treaty with Russia
until the dispute is resolved. Gerasimov also met Katsutoshi Kawano, the
chief of staff of Japan's Self Defence Forces. [China's Defence Ministry
said on Monday it had begun a planned joint simulated anti-missile drill
with Russia in Beijing, which had "important meaning" for both countries
in facing the threat from missiles]{.underline}. It said the exercise
was not aimed at any third party[. China and Russia both oppose the
development of global anti-missile systems]{.underline}, the ministry
added in a statement. China and Russia both oppose the deployment in
South Korea of the advanced U.S. Terminal High Altitude Area Defense
(THAAD) anti-missile system. [China in particular fears the system's
powerful radar could look deep into its territory, threatening its
security]{.underline}. The United States and South Korea say the system
is needed to defend against the threat of North Korean missiles. It is
not clear if this week's exercise by U.S., South Korean and Japanese
forces will involve the THAAD system.

#### Russia and china are taking retaliatory measures -- increasing tensions

**Lemon '18** (Jason Lemon, writer for Newsweek, previously a
contributor to The Atlanta Journal-Constitution, "RUSSIA AND CHINA WILL
RETALIATE AGAINST U.S. MISSILE SYSTEMS IN ASIA, AMBASSADOR WARNS",
Newsweek, 7/23/18,
<https://www.newsweek.com/russia-china-retaliate-against-us-defenses-asia-1037317>)

[[Russia and China plan to take retaliatory measures against the
deployment of U.S. missile defense systems in Japan]{.mark} and South
Korea, Moscow\'s ambassador to Beijing warned on Monday.]{.underline}

Speaking to reporters, Ambassador Andrei Denisov said such actions by
the neighboring Asian countries pose a security threat to Russia and its
regional ally China. He suggested that the decisions from Japan and
South Korea would require a response from Moscow and Beijing.

[\"Those who house such facilities on their territory, [which our
Chinese partners and we think pose a threat to our security,]{.mark}
essentially put their security in jeopardy, as we have to take some
retaliatory measures,\" Denisov said, Russian news agency Tass reported.
\"And this is absolutely obvious.\"]{.underline}

South Korea announced in mid-2016 that it supported the deployment of
the Terminal High Altitude Area Defense system, a U.S. missile defense
program. The decision came during the constant threat of a nuclear
attack from North Korea. However, in recent months, Seoul and Pyongyang
have significantly improved relations, signaling that a lasting peace
agreement could be possible. At the same time, skeptics suggest North
Korea\'s Kim Jong Un is merely pandering to ease international sanctions
so his country can continue to improve its nuclear capabilities.

[Japan agreed in December 2017 to expand its missile defense system with
the help of the U.S]{.underline}. The country plans to purchase and
deploy two Aegis Ashore missile defense systems, each costing about
\$900 million. They will be positioned in the north and southwest of the
country\'s principal island.

[The [warning from Russia follows similar statements regarding U.S.
defenses established in European countries neighboring the world\'s
largest nation.]{.mark}]{.underline}

European NATO members have eyed Moscow\'s apparent expansionist
ambitions with concern following a 2014 move to support separatist
Ukrainian rebels and annex the Crimean Peninsula. Russian neighbors
Poland, Norway, Latvia, Sweden, Estonia and Lithuania have raised
concerns that Russia could make similar moves against their sovereignty.

In early June, Norway announced it would more than double the presence
of U.S. Marines within its borders starting next year, leading Russia to
warn that there would be \"consequences.\" Reports also circulated in
May suggesting that Poland offered the U.S. \$2 billion to station
troops permanently within its borders. Moscow said such a move could
\"lead to counteraction from\" its side.

[[Recent satellite images]{.mark} also [suggest that Russia has expanded
a nuclear storage facility]{.mark} in its Kaliningrad enclave, located
near the borders with Poland and Lithuania, according to a report
released in mid-June by the Federation of American
Scientists.]{.underline}

Despite threats from Moscow, and Washington appearing to increase its
defensive posture against Russia around the world, President Donald
Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin recently met in Helsinki for
a high-profile summit. Following the meeting, the leaders said they
agreed to work together more closely on security and military issues.
They also said they discussed their nation\'s respective nuclear
arsenals.

Trump has hailed the meeting as a \"great success,\" while many in
Washington---from across the political spectrum---have condemned the
president for pandering to Moscow as the FBI continues to investigate
the president\'s campaign team for connections and alleged collusion
with the Kremlin.

### China Scenario -- General

#### Japanese possession of BMDs from the US causes China to feel threatened.

**Cronin**, March 19^th^, 20**02** (Richard P. Cronin, Specialist in
Asian Affairs Foreign Affairs, Defense, and Trade Division, Japan-US
Cooperation on Ballistic Missile Defense: Issues and Prospects,
Congressional Research Service,
https://heinonline-org.dartmouth.idm.oclc.org/HOL/Page?collection=congrec&handle=hein.crs/crsacky0001&id=1&men_tab=srchresults#)

Impact of Japan\'s active involvement in regional deployment of a BMD
system on U.S. operational flexibility.

[Given the historical mistrust of Japan\'s intentions and programs among
its Asian neighbors, a highly visible involvement by Japan in missile
defense, were it otherwise possible, could have negative implications
for U.S. security interests in Asia.]{.underline} [China, for instance,
might see an integrated U.S.-Japan BMD capability as more threatening to
its interests than a U.S. system alone, because of the implication that
Japan is joining a de facto collective security arrangement that is
aimed at China, especially in a confrontation involving
Taiwan.]{.underline} China and other neighboring countries may be less
than convinced that Article 9 will continue to inhibit Japan\'s
participation in collective security with the United States, especially
because the restriction has become the target of nationalist opposition
in Japan. [Thus for China, North and South Korea, and some Southeast
Asian countries, an integrated U.S.-Japan BMD system could be viewed as
symbolizing the remilitarization of Japan under the cloak of alliance
cooperation with the United States]{.underline}. [To the extent that
joint BMD deployment generated fears of a rearmed Japan, it could
detract from the acceptability of a U.S. BMD capability]{.underline}. On
the other side of the equation, Japan\'s neighbors are likely to regard
an independent Japanese BMD with even greater concern. For some of
Japan\'s neighbors, such as South Korea, a Japanese capability firmly
linked to that of the United States would seem more desirable. China, on
the other hand, opposes both deployment options.

#### **Chinese have a retaliation policy-they would immediately respond to a perceived nuclear attack increasing the risk for miscalc**

Fiona **Cunningham,** 12-xx-20**15,** \"Why China Won\'t Abandon Its
Nuclear Strategy of Assured Retaliation,\" Belfer Center for Science and
International Affairs,
https://www.belfercenter.org/publication/why-china-wont-abandon-its-nuclear-strategy-assured-retaliation,
accessed 7-12-2019 (Kent Denver\--EA)

[This policy brief is based on \"Assuring Assured Retaliation: China\'s
Nuclear Posture and U.S.-China Strategic Stability,\" which appears in
the fall 2015 issue of International Security. Bottom Lines A renewed
U.S. threat to China\'s nuclear deterrent]{.underline}. Chinese analysts
worry that advances in U.S. strategic capabilities could undermine
China\'s ability to retaliate against a U.S. nuclear attack.
[Continuation of China\'s strategy of assured retaliation. China is
unlikely to dramatically increase its relatively small nuclear force or
abandon its second-strike posture. Instead, China will modestly expand
its arsenal, increase the sophistication of its forces, and allow
limited ambiguity over its pledge not to use nuclear weapons
first]{.underline}. Potential pitfalls of limited ambiguity over
no-first-use. L[imited ambiguity over no-first-use allows China to avoid
an arms race, but it could increase risks of nuclear escalation in a
U.S.-China crisis]{.underline}. Limited ambiguity might also energize
U.S. pursuit of strategic superiority, if the United States sees it as a
broad exception to China\'s no-first-use policy. Whether China will
abandon its long-standing nuclear strategy of assured retaliation for a
first-use posture will be a critical factor in U.S.-China strategic
[stability. In recent years, the United States has been developing
strategic capabilities such as missile defenses and conventional
long-range strike capabilities that could reduce the effectiveness of
China\'s deterrent]{.underline}. Writings by Chinese strategists and
analysts, however, indicate that China is unlikely to abandon its
current nuclear strategy[. A Renewed U.S. Threat to China\'s Nuclear
Arsenal China\'s strategists perceive missile defense as the most
serious future threat to China\'s nuclear arsenal]{.underline}. They
worry that the current, limited U.S. development and deployment of a
missile defense system could be expanded in scope and effectiveness to
give the United States an effective shield against Chinese nuclear
missiles. [Even if the system cannot reliably intercept ballistic
missiles after they are launched, Chinese analysts are concerned that
missile defense deployments could trigger a regional arms race if other
countries see the U.S. commitment to the system as a proof of concept
that it may be effective]{.underline}. Chinese assessments of the threat
posed by conventional long-range strike capabilities are more mixed.
Some Chinese analysts do not think that a U.S. conventional attack on
China\'s nuclear arsenal would be very likely or effective. They believe
that China\'s efforts to protect its arsenal from a nuclear attack,
including hardening, dispersal, and mobility, would be sufficient to
protect China from a conventional attack as well. At the same time,
analysts worry that the United States may be more likely to use
conventional weapons than nuclear weapons against China\'s nuclear
arsenal. Further, some analysts are concerned that U.S. conventional
long-range strike capabilities, [if paired with improvements in U.S.
intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance systems, could reduce the
amount of strategic warning that China would receive of an incoming
attack. These capabilities could, therefore, undermine China\'s
deterrent]{.underline}. Continuation of China\'s Strategy of Assured
Retaliation China will not abandon its nuclear strategy of assured
retaliation in response to an increasingly clear U.S. commitment to
strategic primacy. Instead, to avoid Cold War--style nuclear competition
and the risk of arms racing, China is altering how it implements assured
retaliation. First, China is allowing limited ambiguity over the
application of its no-first-use policy. Debate among Chinese strategists
over the definition of \"[first use\" has created uncertainty over how
China would respond to attacks with conventional weapons on its nuclear
forces and infrastructure. The main purpose of such limited ambiguity is
to deter the United States from conducting such conventional
counterforce attacks. Chinese strategists are also debating whether a
launch-on-warning posture would be desirable and consistent with
China\'s]{.underline} no-first-use policy. Second, China seeks to
maintain the smallest nuclear arsenal capable of assuring retaliation
against a nuclear-armed adversary. In response to U.S. capabilities
developments, the Chinese are making qualitative and limited
quantitative improvements in the country\'s force structure. China is
modestly increasing the size and surviva[bility of its intercontinental
ballistic missile (ICBM) force as well as its ability to penetrate
missile defenses. It is equipping some of its ICBMs with multiple,
independently targeted reentry vehicles, developing glide technology,
and improving its strategic warning and command and control
systems]{.underline}. To counter future advances in U.S. strategic
capabilities, China is researching and developing missile defenses and
hypersonic weapons technology, as well as continuing to improve its
ballistic missile submarine force. Potential Pitfalls of Ambiguity over
[No-First Use Limited ambiguity over how China may define a \"nuclear
attack\" for its no-first-use policy allows it to maintain a smaller
arsenal than it would need if it adhered to a strict no-first-use
policy. Yet limited ambiguity also raises the risk of nuclear escalation
in a crisis, as it increases the likelihood that the United States could
mistake Chinese nuclear signaling for preparations to use nuclear
weapons]{.underline}. China\'s decision implies that it views the
economic, diplomatic, and strategic costs of arms racing as a bigger
threat to its national security than the risk of nuclear escalation in a
crisis. China is also relatively optimistic about [the risk of nuclear
escalation in any future U.S.-China crisis. A U.S.-China crisis would
most likely arise because of a dispute between a U.S. ally and
China]{.underline}. Few Chinese strategists believe that the stakes in
any U.S.- China crisis would be sufficient for either China or the
United States to risk nuclear escalation. Chinese analysts also regard
China\'s no-first-use policy as contributing to a clear firebreak
between nuclear and conventional conflict. They believe that the United
States would not be tempted to cross that threshold by attacking
China\'s nuclear arsenal with conventional capabilities, given the
limited ambiguity over China\'s no-first-use policy. Most Chinese
strategists do not acknowledge the risk of unintentional escalation in a
U.S.-China crisis. The United States does not share China\'s relative
optimism about the risk of nuclear escalation in a future U.S.-China
crisis. Western experts worry that escalation could occur if the United
States were to implement an AirSea Battle Concept--style campaign to
destroy China\'s conventional capabilities that simultaneously degraded
Chinese nuclear capabilities and their supporting infrastructure. One
reason for this divergence of opinion may be that Western analysts
believe that China\'s nuclear and conventional missile forces are
colocated, increasing the likelihood that a U.S. attack on Chinese
conventional land-based missiles could degrade China\'s nuclear
capabilities. Many Chinese analysts dismiss this risk, however, arguing
that China\'s conventional and nuclear capabilities are not colocated.
Open-source information about China\'s strategic missile forces, the
Second Artillery, indicates that China\'s nuclear missiles are, in fact,
not colocated with conventional ones. Within the Second Artillery,
missile launch brigades are organized based on either conventional or
nuclear armaments. Conventional and nuclear missile brigades do share
some infrastructure, but Chinese military texts describe steps that have
been taken to ensure redundancy in China\'s command and control
structures. Thus, any U.S. conventional attack on a Chinese conventional
missile brigade would probably not substantially degrade China\'s
nuclear capabilities. It could still significantly escalate a crisis,
however, because of the message such an attack would communicate about
U.S. willingness and capabilities to conduct a similar attack on a
Chinese nuclear brigad[e. China would likely respond by signaling its
resolve to retaliate if its nuclear weapons were attacked, which could
be misread by the United States as preparations for use. China\'s
decision to pair limited ambiguity over no-first-use with an otherwise
restrained nuclear posture could backfire. China likely underestimates
U.S. willingness to run the risk of nuclear escalation in a
crisis.]{.underline} In addition, if the United States views China\'s
limited ambiguity as a bluff because China otherwise adheres to its
no-first-use policy, it might ignore the risk of nuclear escalation in
conventional campaign planning, resulting in a deterrence failure in a
conventional conflict. Alternatively, if [the United States views
China\'s limited ambiguity as a sign that China may abandon its
no-first-use policy in circumstances other than a conventional attack on
its nuclear forces and infrastructure or nonnuclear strategic targets,
it may pursue strategic primacy more energetically, drawing China into
the very arms race it seeks to avoid]{.underline}. China\'s continuing
commitment to a nuclear strategy of assured retaliation indicates that
it will prioritize avoiding a nuclear arms race with the United States.
Nevertheless, leaders and militaries in both countries will need to be
exceptionally careful to avoid nuclear escalation in a crisis. Related

Department of Defense and its international partners.

WASHINGTON --- [In recent years, top defense officials and internal
Pentagon reports alike have cautioned about the rise of China as a
military power, in large part due to its investments in high-end
technologies like hypersonics and its development of indigenous
capabilities like stealth fighters and aircraft carriers]{.underline}.
[But it's not a piece of hardware that's most worrisome for American
interests, according to a new assessment by the Defense Intelligence
Agency. Instead, it's the worry that the Chinese service members behind
each system have reached a critical point of confidence where they now
feel that in combat, the People's Liberation Army can match
competitors.]{.underline} In the long term, that could be bad news for
America --- and especially for Taiwan. Speaking to reporters Tuesday
ahead of the new DIA 2019 ["China Military Power" report, a senior
defense intelligence official called the idea that Beijing might soon
trust its military capabilities well enough to invade Taiwan "the most
concerning" conclusion from the report. "The biggest concern is that
they are getting to a point where the PLA leadership may actually tell
\[President Xi Jinping\] they are confident in their capabilities. We
know in the past they have considered themselves a developing, weaker
power,]{.underline}" the official said. "As a lot of these technologies
mature, as their reorganization of their military comes into effect, as
they become more proficient with these capabilities, [the concern is
we'll reach a point where internally in their decision-making they will
decide that using military force for regional conflict is something that
is more imminent]{.underline}," the official added[. The Pentagon is
planning for war with China and Russia --- can it handle
both?]{.underline} War with China and war with Russia would have some
overlapping qualities, but the Pentagon needs to figure out how and
where to invest to deal with both[. The report is the first public
analysis of Chinese military power released by the DIA, and the official
said there is no classified version of this production]{.underline}. The

Patrick Shanahan, the acting secretary of defense, used his first staff
meeting to emphasize [the Pentagon's prime focus must remain on "China,
China, China." Based on its assessment of Chinese official papers and
statements, the DIA concluded that Chinese military modernization was
not undertaken with a major global war in mind, but rather in
preparation for further challenges to its regional efforts, potentially
leading to a local war.]{.underline} "Within the context of Beijing's
'period of strategic opportunity,[' as \[China\] continues to grow in
strength and confidence, \[U.S.\] leaders will face a China insistent on
having a greater voice in global interactions, which at times may be
antithetical to U.S. interests,"]{.underline} the agency reported. The
reclamation of Taiwan is a long-standing goal for Chinese leadership,
and Xi has made no secret of that desire[. The DIA notes that much of
China's military modernization has been focused on Taiwan, including the
emphasis on short-range missile technology that would largely be useless
in any other theater of combat.]{.underline} Keeping Taiwan safe at the
moment is a belief inside the PLA that the armed service doesn't have
the training, doctrine and readiness levels needed for a full-scale
invasion of the island. But should that change, the military has the
technology and numbers at hand to make such a move possible. "We don't
have a real strong grasp on when they will think that they are confident
in that capability," the official said. "They could order them to go
today, but I don't think they are particularly confident in that
capability." [Taiwan is not the only potential flashpoint identified by
the DIA. While China is unlikely to seek out an active conflict near
its]{.underline} territory, the official said, China's construction of
man-made, militarized islands in the South China Sea as well as its
assertion of rights to the Senkaku Islands in the East China Sea could
become points of tension. Here\'s the scoop on China\'s defense budget.
But so, too, could China's expanded interests around the world, the
official warned, citing the PLA's permanent base in Djibouti and
willingness to sail ships farther abroad. ["We now have to be able to
look for a Chinese military that is active everywhere," the official
said. "I'm not saying they are a threat or about to take military action
everywhere, but they are present in a lot of places, and we will have to
interact with them, engage with them, deal with them, monitor them more
broadly than we had to before]{.underline} when they were very
regionally focused near their own shores." [Technological upgrades While
doctrine may lag behind, China's investments in new technologies are
starting to bear fruit. In the more than 100-page assessment on China,
the agency noted China's continued modernization efforts of almost every
aspect of its ground, sea, air and space forces. The vast modernization
effort --- which includes the launch of its first independently
developed aircraft carrier in 2019, the continued development of the
Hong-20 nuclear-capable bomber and the emphasis it has placed in recent
years on professionalizing its ground forces]{.underline} --- has
[produced "a robust, lethal force with capabilities spanning the air,
maritime, space and information domains which will enable China to
impose its will in the region,"]{.underline} the DIA found. Getting near
par to American capabilities is one thing, but there are some areas
where China threatens to surpass America --- and may have already done
so. T[he first is with hypersonic weaponry --- delivery vehicles capable
of going Mach 5 or faster]{.underline}. In the last two years, the
Pentagon has been increasingly vocal about the need to invest more in
its hypersonic capabilities, both offensive and defensive, largely
because of how much China has put toward the new weaponry. "They are on
the leading edge of technology in that area \[and are\] getting to the
point where they are going to field this system," the official said
about hypersonic weapons, [singling out hypersonic glide vehicles for
ballistic missiles as the area in which Beijing has heavily invested.
More broadly, China remains a leader in precision-strike capabilities,
especially with medium- and intermediate-range ballistic
missiles]{.underline} --- something the official partly blamed on the
fact the U.S. and Russia were barred from developing such systems under
the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty. The sneaky ways China and
Russia could threaten US satellites The sneaky ways China and Russia
could threaten US satellites Kinetic attacks in space are still
possible, but nations are looking more towards electronic warfare and
cyber attacks, a report has concluded. By: Aaron Mehta, Mike Gruss
[China is also excelling at developing anti-satellite]{.underline}
capabilities. "In addition to the research and possible [development of
satellite jammers and directed-energy weapons, China has probably made
progress on kinetic energy weapons, including the anti-satellite missile
system tested in July 2014," the report reads. "China is employing more
sophisticated satellite operations and probably is testing on-orbit
dual-use technologies that could be applied to counterspace
missions]{.underline}." Said the official: "They've clearly been pushing
forward on trying to build this comprehensive capability that can
threaten U.S. and other satellites in all orbits, to build capability to
threaten all these systems. \... They think it's a potential
vulnerability for us and allied forces, although they themselves are
becoming more reliant on space-based capabilities."

#### japan's aegis ashore causes escalating tensions with china

**Ryall '17** (Julian Ryall, Japan Correspondent for The Daily
Telegraph, Member of the Foreign Correspondents' Club of Japan,
Bachelor's Degree in European Studies with French, Russian, Economics,
Politics & International Relations, "China, Japan wary of each other
over advanced missile radars", Deutsche Welle,
<https://www.dw.com/en/china-japan-wary-of-each-other-over-advanced-missile-radars/a-39041637>)

[The Japanese government has yet to comment on what is being seen as a
thinly veiled threat from China over its joint development with the US
of a new generation of missile defense radars that will strengthen
Japan\'s protective shield against any missile strike.]{.underline}

But political analysts here say Beijing\'s complaints are \"ridiculous\"
and that attempting to exert pressure to weaken Japan\'s defenses is
\"deeply unprincipled.\"

[China is also locked in a long-running dispute with South Korea over
the deployment of the US military\'s Terminal High Altitude Area Defense
(THAAD) anti-missile system, despite Seoul\'s efforts to convince
Beijing that it is designed purely to protect South Korean citizens from
a belligerent and nuclear-armed regime in North Korea.]{.underline}

China is worried that THAAD\'s powerful radar could gaze deep into
Chinese territory and imperil the nation\'s security by compromising its
missile capabilities.

Since the dispute arose, China has imposed a range of measures designed
to harm South Korean businesses - including a ban on the sale of package
tours to the country and a sharp increase in inspections of Korean
firms\' operations in China - although Beijing denies the changes are
related to the THAAD deployment.

The latest comments by a representative of the government in Beijing
have aroused concerns that similar unofficial sanctions could be used
against Japan.

Impact on regional stability

[Addressing a monthly press briefing at China\'s Defense Ministry
recently, spokesman Ren Guoqiang said Japan\'s development of advanced
radar systems designed to counteract incoming ballistic missiles would
have a negative impact on strategic stability and damage trust between
nations in the region.]{.underline}

He added that Tokyo should act \"cautiously\" and hinted that
neighboring countries would be alarmed at any improved military
capability because of imperial Japan\'s invasion and occupation of parts
of Asia and the Pacific in the early decades of the last century.

[\"Especially because of historical reasons, relevant moves by Japan in
the military and security field have always attracted close attention
from its Asian neighbors and the international community,\" Reuters
quoted Ren as saying. \"Japan should act cautiously on the anti-missile
issue,\" he added.]{.underline}

\"It is a typical Chinese comment and attitude,\" said Yoichi Shimada, a
professor of international relations at Fukui Prefectural University.
\"And it must be pointed out that China has already deployed a radar
system that is able to cover all the Japanese and US bases in Japan, so
this is another example of Beijing demanding one thing of its neighbors
but ignoring other nations\' concerns about its own abilities,\" he told
DW.

Shimada added that Japan would arguably not need to deploy new radar and
defensive missile systems if Beijing had not supported North Korea -
both politically and materially - over the last seven decades, during
which time the ruling Kim family in Pyongyang has been able to develop
nuclear weapons and appears close to perfecting an intercontinental
ballistic missile capable of reaching targets in the continental US.

[Recent missile launches]{.underline}

[Underlining Japan\'s need to be able to defend its territory and
population from unprovoked North Korean attacks, a missile was fired on
Sunday from a mobile launcher unit on the east coast of North Korea. The
weapon traveled an estimated 400 kilometers before falling into Japan\'s
exclusive economic zone in the Sea of Japan.]{.underline} The launch -
North Korean state media claimed it was a successful test of a new
guidance system - was the third in a little over three weeks.

\"China has played a big part in North Korea becoming a nuclear threat
and it is only sensible that Japan takes countermeasures against that
threat,\" Shimada said. \"For China to try to interfere in Japan\'s
defense is deeply unprincipled.\"

Garren Mulloy, an associate professor of international relations at
Daito Bunkyo University, said making reference to imperial Japan\'s
conquest of large parts of China is a \"common tool for Japan-bashing
because it is extremely easy to use.\"

[The real reason that Beijing has been so stridently opposed to the
deployment of both THAAD and now the land-based version of the Aegis
anti-missile system that is aboard a number of Japanese navy warships is
that it provides better defensive coverage, which impacts China\'s
offensive strategy, say observers.]{.underline}

[\"Basically, the Chinese have no right to make these sorts of demands
against its neighbors, in part because the situation we are in today in
Northeast Asia - a nuclear-armed North Korea - is in large part due to
Beijing\'s policies,\" Mulloy said.]{.underline}

\'To complain is ridiculous\'

[\"These developments are not aimed at China; they are simply a reaction
to the perceived threat of ballistic missiles coming from North Korea
and for Beijing to complain is ridiculous,\" Mulloy noted.]{.underline}

[Perhaps one of China\'s concerns is that the spread of such advanced
technology might next reach]{.underline} Taiwan, which Beijing still
regards as a renegade province and has vowed to one day incorporate into
the mainland regime.

[Shimada believes that China will continue to exert pressure against
Japan, but that the government of Prime Minister Shinzo Abe will be
strong enough to resist efforts to influence domestic
policies.]{.underline}

He is less optimistic about South Korea. \"There are clear parallels
with the situation in South Korea, but now they have elected what is
effectively a pro-Chinese and pro-North Korean government, I fully
expect the country to become a virtual protectorate of China,\" he
added.

### China Scenario - Aegis = Tipping Point 

#### Absent Aegis Ashore, China won't dramatically expand it's nuclear arsenal -- they want the bare minimum number of weapons to maintain a credible strategic strike capability 

**Chase 7/2013** (Michael S. Chase, U.S. Naval War College Warfare
Analysis and Research Associate Professor, "China\'s Transition to a
More Credible Nuclear Deterrent: Implications and Challenges for the
United States," Asia Policy, Project Muse)

[China's "no first use" nuclear policy and assured retaliation strategy
have remained relatively constant over the years.]{.underline} Recent
doctrinal publications, however, suggest that [the country's nuclear
missiles could also help deter conventional strategic
attacks]{.underline}. Moreover, China is currently modernizing and
expanding its nuclear force with the deployment of road-mobile
intercontinental ballistic missiles and the development of a submarine-
launched ballistic missile to arm its new nuclear-powered ballistic
missile submarines. After decades of reliance on a small and potentially
vulnerable strategic deterrent, [China is]{.underline} finally
[achieving the "lean and effective" nuclear force Chinese strategists
believe their country needs to protect its security]{.underline}. As a
result of these growing nuclear-deterrence capabilities, nuclear issues
will likely assume greater importance in the U.S.-China relationship.
policy implications [China's]{.underline} transition to a more [secure
second-strike capability is likely to contribute to greater strategic
stability in the U.S.-China relationship]{.underline}, but China's
larger and more sophisticated nuclear force will also create challenges
for U.S. policymakers. • [Trying to trump China's retaliatory capability
through a large-scale missile defense build-up would be costly and
counterproductive]{.underline}e for the U.S. • Instead, [Washington
should limit missile defenses]{.underline} intended to protect the U.S.
homeland [to a level appropriate for dealing with the much smaller
threat posed by North Korea, and pursue strategic stability with China
through mutual deterrence.]{.underline} • Washington should also
continue pressing for an official U.S.-China dialogue on strategic
deterrence, one that encompasses nuclear, space, cyber, and conventional
military capabilities. For many years, China's relatively small nuclear
force and stated adherence to a policy of "no first use" (NFU) of
nuclear weapons limited its salience in global debates about nuclear
issues. However, the country's growing strategic-deterrence capabilities
suggest this will soon change. Indeed, as a result of China's transition
to a larger and more sophisticated nuclear force, which will be centered
on road-mobile intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBM) and
nuclear-powered ballistic missile submarines (SSBN) armed with
submarine-launched ballistic missiles (SLBM), China is likely to become
a more important consideration in such discussions. As the country's
strategic-deterrence capabilities grow, nuclear issues appear poised to
assume greater significance in the U.S.-China security relationship. The
reasons for their increasing importance include heightened U.S.
attention to Asia-Pacific security issues, the changing balance of
conventional military power in the region, rising tensions over maritime
territorial disputes, and the implications of China's growing nuclear
capabilities for future arms control initiatives. 1 [China's nuclear
policy and strategy appear to have remained relatively constant over the
years]{.underline}, but recent doctrinal publications suggest that
[Chinese strategists see a role for nuclear capabilities in deterring
certain types of conventional strategic attacks.]{.underline} At the
same time, [the People's Liberation Army (PLA) is modernizing its
nuclear forces to enhance their survivability, increase their striking
power, and counter missile-defense developments]{.underline}. Official
Chinese sources indicate that [Beijing's goal is fielding a "lean and
effective" nuclear force that meets its evolving national security
needs]{.underline}. 2 China currently maintains the DF-3
intermediate-range ballistic missile (IRBM) and DF-21 and DF-21A
medium-range ballistic missiles (MRBM) for theater nuclear-deterrence
missions. The country's nuclear ICBM force consists of the older,
limited-range DF-4, the silo-based DF-5, and the recently deployed
road-mobile DF-31 and DF-31A. According to the U.S. Department of
Defense, China is enhancing its silo-based systems, deploying more
road-mobile ICBMs, and preparing to take its strategic deterrent to sea
\[ 72 \] •ch• inahul as a new generation of SSBNs enters service with
the PLA Navy (PLAN). 3 (It should be noted, however, that the new
submarines still await their intended armament, the JL-2 SLBM, which
remains under development.) In addition, China may be developing a new
road-mobile ICBM, possibly capable of carrying multiple independently
targetable reentry vehicles (MIRV). 4 The transition to more advanced
road-mobile ICBMs and SSBNs is particularly significant in that it
provides China with a much more survivable nuclear force. Although the
country's limited nuclear transparency complicates efforts to predict
future developments, recent trends offer a reasonable guide to
understanding the likely future direction of Chinese nuclear force
modernization. In recent years, [China has focused on enhancing the
survivability and striking power of its strategic
deterrent]{.underline}. This suggests that over the next fiv e to ten
years, Beijing can be expected to continue shifting to a larger and more
survivable nuclear force composed primarily of road-mobile ICBMs and
SSBNs[. Even as China's nuclear force continues to increase in size and
sophistication, Beijing is]{.underline} highly [unlikely to seek
numerical parity with the United States and Russia, even if the U.S. and
Russian arsenals fall to numbers well below current levels]{.underline}.
According to General Jing Zhiyuan, former commander of the Second
Artillery Force (which controls the PLA's strategic missiles), China's
limited development of nuclear weapons "will not compete in quantity"
with the nuclear superpowers. Instead, Jing writes that [Beijing intends
to maintain the "lowest level" of nuclear weapons that is sufficient to
safeguard its national security.]{.underline} 5 Nonetheless, this
statement indicates that China will deploy the forces it perceives as
required f r an assured retaliation capability, which is likely to
entail considerable growth in the size of its nuclear missile force.
Indeed, according to the U.S. Defense Intelligence Agency, the number of
Chinese ICBMs capable of reaching the United States "probably will more
than double" by 2025.

#### Aegis is the tipping point for Chinese nuclear expansion -- limiting Aegis capabilities solves

Fellow, "MINIMIZING THE LIKELIHOOD OF A CHINESE STRATEGIC NUCLEAR

[The second dynamic that could give rise to a buildup of China's
strategic nuclear forces is a thickening of]{.underline} U.S. national
[BMD]{.underline}. [China's leaders fears that]{.underline} regional and
national U.S. [BMD systems are intended to neutralize China's nuclear

assurances from U.S.policy makers stating otherwise. 25 More generally,

response to a perceived thickening of U.S]{.underline}. national BMD
caused by developments in U.S. regional [BMD capabilities]{.underline},
[China could expand its nuclear arsenal, including increasing its number
of strategic ballistic missiles, and potentially MIRVing
them]{.underline}.27 In discussing U.S. BMD capabilities, this report
focuses on the ability of U.S. interceptors to engage with incoming
warheads. Engagement is based on the burnout velocities of interceptors,
for which reasonably reliable public estimates are available. Engagement
does not imply the ability to actually intercept a warhead, especially
if the incoming missile uses decoys or other countermeasures. The
effectiveness of U.S. BMD systems against countermeasures remains in
question,29 in part because tests with realistic countermeasures have
not been conducted.30 This report does not address BMD system
discrimination and radar problems, but rather seeks to identify ways to
assuage China's worst-case scenario concerns given interceptor
engagement ability. [Despite current limitations of U.S. interceptor
discrimination capabilities, our Chinese interviewees expressed the
belief that, given enough time and money, the United States could
drastically improve these capabilities. Therefore, we believe that
limiting Aegis interceptor burnout velocities in a way that does not
reduce their effectiveness for regional defense can address some of
China's fears about U.S. BMD developments.]{.underline}

#### SM-3 missiles and Aegis capabilities pose a unique threat to Chinese deterrence

**Jones 2009** (Chris Jones, Center for Strategic and International
Studies Research Assistant, "Managing the Goldilocks Dilemma: Missile
Defense and Strategic Stability in Northeast Asia," Center for Strategic
and International Studies, Stratcom)

In conclusion, [the]{.underline} Obama administration's [effort to
recalibrate missile defense to better address regional missile threats
could actually increase Chinese concern about U.S. missile
defense]{.underline}. While the reduction in operational GroundBased
Interceptors should help reduce, though not ameliorate, Chinese concerns
about missile defense negating the reliability of their ICBM
second-strike capability, [the new missile defense architecture has
repercussions within Northeast Asia that could greatly concern China.
The increased emphasis upon the SM-3 missile, stationed on mobile
Aegis-capable ships, and movable THAAD batteries provides the United
States with additional capabilities that could be brought to bear in
regional contingency scenarios involving China, such as a conflagration
over Taiwan]{.underline}. In addition, [U.S. missile defense cooperation
efforts key regional allies, a priority in the BMDR, worry
Beijing]{.underline}. As China decides how to respond to the new 123
developments in U.S. missile defense, the United States should pursue
high-level strategic dialogues with China on the subject, while
remaining firmly committed to alliance commitments in the region.
U.S.-China strategic dialogues can help foster the trust and confidence
needed for strategic stability between the countries.

#### China is particularly concerned by advanced SM-3 missile interceptors 

**Colby and Denmark 4/2013** (Elbridge A. Colby and Abraham M. Denmark,

Consistent with this policy, [the United States]{.underline} is pursuing
two interrelated programs. First, it [continues to develop and deploy
theater missile defense systems that are designed to protect U.S.
forces, regional bases, as well as U.S. partners and allies]{.underline}
from the short- and medium-range ballis- tic missiles of potential
adversaries, including China, primarily with conventional contingencies
in mind. [Theater defenses include Patriot Advanced Capability-3 (PAC-3)
batteries, Terminal High Altitude Area Defense (THAAD) batteries,
Standard Missile-3 (SM-3) interceptors aboard Aegis cruisers, and
supporting radars and sensors.]{.underline} As part of its rebalancing
of forces, [the United States is planning upgrades to its missile
defense architecture in East Asia]{.underline}, including the deployment
of new X-band radars. Theater defenses will be sized to meet the threat
of shorter-range convention- all missiles from whatever quarter,
including China's anti-access/area-denial capabilities. However, these
interceptors have essentially no capability against China's long-range
nuclear-capable missiles. At the same time, the United States will
continue to build and posture a limited national missile defense
designed to protect the U.S. homeland against hostile nations with less
sophisticated long-range missile delivery capabilities, in particular
Iran and North Korea---but not Russia or China. Currently, the only
deployed system the United States has with any capability against
long-range missiles is the combination of 30 ground-based midcourse
interceptors at Fort Greeley in Alaska and Vandenberg Air Force Base in
California. [The United States also plans to develop more advanced
interceptors---such as the SM-3 Block IIB---that could have some
capability against ICBMs,]{.underline} but those capabilities are still
in the planning phase and are being designed to counter the missile
threat from Iran and North Korea. Nonetheless, [future variants of the
SM-3 are of particular concern to China because they blur the
distinction between national and theater missile defenses, creating
uncertainty for China's long-term planning]{.underline}.

#### Removing Aegis solves Chinese deterrence concerns 

**Hippel and Bin 1/2013** (Frank Von Hippel, Princeton Global Security
Professor, Li Bin, Carnegie Endowment for International Peace Senior
Fellow, "MINIMIZING THE LIKELIHOOD OF A CHINESE STRATEGIC NUCLEAR
ARSENAL BUILDUP," WWS 591F POLICY WORKSHOP REPORT)

For example, consider an ICBM launched from a base in central China
heading towards Washington, D.C. The trajectory of the warhead is shown
in orange in Figure 3 above. Block IA and IB interceptors could engage
this warhead before it reached its target, but, assuming that the
warhead is on a minimum- energy trajectory,37 they could be launched
only from the area shaded in red. If Block IIA has a burnout velocity of
4.0 km/s, interception could be attempted from the purple area. A faster
version of the SM-3 Block IIA interceptor, with a burnout velocity of
4.5 km/s, could be used to attempt an interception from the area shaded
in yellow. Finally, a Block IIB interceptor with a burnout velocity of
5.0 km/s could be used to attempt an interception from the area shaded
in light blue. [Block IIA and IIB interceptors greatly increase the area
where Aegis]{.underline} ship- or land-based [interceptors could be
stationed and still engage with a Chinese ICBM]{.underline}. Policy
Option: [The United States could refrain from deploying Block IIA or IIB
interceptors]{.underline} on U.S. Aegis ships or in North America.
![](media/image1.png){width="0.4395833333333333in"
height="9.027777777777777e-3in"} 7 Given that GMD already has an
adequate number of interceptors to defend against foreseeable North
Korean and Iranian threats, deployment of additional interceptors in
North America is unnecessary. Moreover[, such a deployment could trigger
a Chinese nuclear buildup. If the U.S. did not deploy Block IIA or IIB
interceptors on Aegis ships, China would be less concerned that U.S.
regional BMD interceptors could be used to thicken U.S. national
defenses against Chinese ICBMs and SLBMs. If China's concerns about its
second-strike capability remain, China may seek to increase its nuclear
arsenal. Not deploying Block IIA and IIB]{.underline} on ships or in
North America [could assuage Russian as well as Chinese fears that the
United States is developing a thick national BMD system, and could allow
the United States and Russia to agree to further arms reductions.
Choosing not to deploy Block IIA or IIB on Aegis]{.underline} ships [is
unlikely to harm U.S. regional missile defense
capabilities]{.underline}. Our calculations indicate that U.S. Aegis
ships, equipped with SM-3 Block IA and IB interceptors and other
defenses, would likely allow the United States to maintain its ability
to defend its carriers and bases from regional threats. In particular,
our calculations indicate that Block IA and IB interceptors likely have
the necessary burnout velocity to engage China's short-range ballistic
missiles, includingtheDF-21D. GiventheBMD coverage provided by
land-based interceptors and the Aegis-based Block IA and IB
interceptors, it appears unnecessary to deploy sea-based Block IIA or
IIB interceptors in East Asia. Additionally, the United States could
encourage Japan to consider only deploying the jointly-developed Block
IIA interceptors on land, not on Japanese Aegis ships. Japan should
consider whether it can adequately defend itself against the North
Korean threat with Aegis-based IA and IB and land-based IIA interceptors
because deploying IIA on Japanese Aegis ships may risk worsening
relations with China.

### Russia Scenario

#### The Aegis Ashore systems cause Russia-Japan tensions because of distrust surrounding future US involvement in controlling the weapon system.

**Plopsky**, 2/7/18 (Guy Plopsky, Political and military analyst with an
MA in International Affairs and Strategic Studies from Tamkang
University, Taiwan, "Russia's Objections to Japan's Aegis Ashore
Decision", The Diplomat,
https://thediplomat.com/2018/02/russias-objections-to-japans-aegis-ashore-decision/)

[Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe's Cabinet decision to procure two
Aegis Ashore systems with the stated purpose of strengthening Japan's
ballistic missile defense (BMD) capabilities in the face of persistent
North Korean provocations and threats drew heavy condemnation from
Russia's Ministry of Foreign Affairs]{.underline}. "\[T\]he adoption of
a decision to purchase and deploy these systems should be viewed as
disproportionate to the real missile threats in the region," declared
Russian Foreign Ministry spokesperson Maria Zakharova in late August
2017, adding that they "may undermine strategic stability in the
northern part of the Pacific." Deputy Foreign Minister Sergey Ryabkov
was equally critical in December, and proceeded to threaten that the
future presence of such systems in Japan is "something we certainly
cannot fail to take into account in our military planning."

[Objections to decisions made by the United States and regional allies
on the stationing of BMD assets in the Asia-Pacific region are not
new.]{.underline} The deployment of a U.S. Army Terminal High Altitude
Area Defense (THAAD) system to South Korea in 2017 was met with heavy
criticism from both Moscow and Beijing despite repeated reassurances
from Washington and Seoul that the purpose of the deployment was to
bolster South Korea's defense against a potential missile strike from
the North. For Russia, both the THAAD deployment and the Aegis Ashore
decision represent the continued expansion "of the U.S. global ballistic
missile defense system."

Unlike THAAD, however, the two Aegis Ashore systems are intended for
Japan's Ground Self-Defense Force (JGSDF). Tokyo has repeatedly conveyed
this point to Russian officials, reassuring them that the systems will
be operated by Japan. [Moscow]{.underline}, however, [continues to stick
to its accusations. "We heard the allegations that Japan would control
this system and that the United States would have no relation thereto,"
Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov told journalists in mid-January
2018, adding that "\[w\]e have serious doubts that this is so." This
dubious Russian assumption has served as the basis for all of Moscow's
objections to the installation of the systems, and is likely to damage
Russia's relationship with Japan as well as further strain U.S.-Russia
relations in the future.]{.underline}

#### The Aegis Ashore uniquely increases tensions between Russia and Japan and is the issue which prevents compromise over the Kuril Islands.

**Stratfor**, Aug, 20**18** (Russia, Japan: Representatives Struggle to
See Eye-to-Eye On Military Matters, Stratfor Worldview,
https://worldview.stratfor.com/article/russia-japan-representatives-struggle-military-matters-missiles-two-plus-two)

Japan and Russia held their third 2+2 meeting of foreign and defense
ministers on Aug. 1 in Moscow. Agreements were made on several points
related to the ongoing ministerial talks and respective approaches to
dealing with North Korea, but discussions failed to make progress on
some more contentious military issues. During the talks, officials
planned annual 2+2 vice-ministerial meetings, tabled two upcoming
September meetings between Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe and
Russian President Vladimir Putin, organized a Russian port visit and
arranged for a Japanese business delegation to the disputed Southern
Kurils. Notably, Russia offered to help resolve the issue of North
Korean abductions of Japanese nationals. However[, the two countries
were less aligned in other areas: Japan asked Russia to show restraint
in military buildups in the disputed Kuril Islands, while Russia
expressed concern about Japan\'s planned deployment of the Aegis Ashore
Ballistic Missile Defense System.]{.underline}

Why It Matters

[This latest meeting signals that, despite a committed effort on both
sides, Russia and Japan are still struggling to strengthen their
bilateral ties.]{.underline} Japan\'s status as a U.S. ally amid the
ongoing standoff between Russia and the West has been a barrier to
improving relations. In fact, the 2+2 dialogue itself was suspended from
2014 to 2017 following Russia\'s annexation of Crimea. [These
complications have stalled Tokyo\'s efforts to resolve its longstanding
territorial dispute over the Southern Kurils and complete a peace treaty
ending World War II. Japan has long hoped to trade economic concessions
in the islands for an easing of Russian territorial claims and military
deployments]{.underline}. In February, Moscow approved deployments of
military aircraft to the island chain.

Further Context

For several months now[, military deployments have been a particularly
thorny topic between Japan and Russia. Russia is concerned that Japan
could use its ballistic missile defense systems in conjunction with the
United States to threaten Russia\'s strategic nuclear
deterrent]{.underline}. For instance, Japan has chosen to use the Long
Range Discrimination Radar for its Aegis Ashore system, which is the
same radar that the United States will use with its Ground-Based
Midcourse Defense system in Alaska and California. [Russia is worried
that Japan will feed into the same network and help the United States
defend against a potential Russian attack.]{.underline} Aegis Ashore is
also compatible with midcourse interceptors that have a wider range than
the Terminal High Altitude Area Defense (THAAD) system deployed in South
Korea[. For Russia, there is the risk that these missiles could
eventually be used to intercept Russian missiles directed toward the
U.S. from positions in Japan. All in all, Moscow feels threatened by the
wider American buildup of ballistic missile defense]{.underline}, be it
in the United States or in allied territory in Europe and Japan.

[Russia is concerned that Japan could use its ballistic missile defense
systems in conjunction with the United States to threaten Russia\'s
strategic nuclear deterrent.]{.underline}

Japan\'s development of the Aegis Ashore system was initially justified
by the threat posed by North Korea, and Russia is still offering
unspecified assistance to Japan when it comes to dealing with Pyongyang.
But this will not eliminate the longer-term issues. A resolution on
North Korea would not change Japan\'s missile defense calculations,
given China\'s massive ballistic missile arsenal, which is far more
capable than North Korea\'s. And [while Japan would like to alleviate
military tension with Russia to the north so it can focus on China in
the south, Moscow\'s constant strategic paranoia about U.S. involvement

#### Russia views the Aegis Missile Defense System as a threat which perpetuates the dispute over the Kuril Island- an issue which prevents Russia and China from resolving the war in the Pacific.

**DW News** 5/30/**19**, (Japan and Russia accuse one another of
dangerous military buildup, DW News,
https://www.dw.com/en/japan-and-russia-accuse-one-another-of-dangerous-military-buildup/a-48980407)

Japanese and Russian foreign and defense ministers meeting in Tokyo on
Thursday accused each others\' governments of unacceptable military
buildups in the region.

[The Japanese say Russia\'s expanded military presence in the disputed
Kuril Islands is \"unacceptable,\" whereas the Russians say Japan\'s
planned installation of a US-made Aegis Ashore missile defense system
poses a \"potential threat.\"]{.underline}

[Japanese Foreign Minister Taro Kono told his counterpart Sergei
Lavrov,]{.underline} [\"Our country\'s legal position does not accept
the missile drills, fighter aircraft deployment, and enhancement of the
military presence in the Northern Territories.\"]{.underline}

Lavrov defended his country\'s actions, saying, \"The Russian armed
forces are active on their sovereign territory, and they have the right
to do that based on international law.\"

Japan\'s US co-operation irks Russians

[Lavrov objected to Japan\'s planned deployment of the Aegis missile
defense system, as well as Japan\'s increased military cooperation with
the US.]{.underline}

The subject was addressed by Japanese Defense Minister Takeshi Iwaya,
who told his Russian counterpart Sergei Shoigu that the system was
\"purely for defensive purposes and never for use to threaten Russia or
other countries.\"

Japan has been bolstering its missile defense systems as it sees itself
under increasing threat from neighboring China and North Korea. In
December, Prime Minister Shinzo Abe also approved plans to buy F-35
stealth fighter jets and cruise missiles as part of the nation\'s
growing military collaboration with the US.

[The disputed islands, referred to as the Kurils by Russia and the
Northern Territories by the Japanese, were seized from imperial Japan by
the Soviet Union at the close of the Second World War.]{.underline}

[Situated between the Sea of Okhotsk and the Pacific Ocean, just off the
northern Japanese island of Hokkaido, the dispute over the islands has
kept both countries from formally ending the war in the
Pacific.]{.underline}

[Prime Minister Abe has been keen to regain the islands in hopes of
developing oil, gas, and other natural resources.]{.underline}

Last November, Japanese Prime Minister Abe and Russian President
Vladimir Putin agreed to speed up negotiations --- based on a 1956
Soviet proposal --- to return the islands to Japan, yet progress has
been slow.

Thursday\'s meeting was convened in a \"two plus two\" format of two
ministers from each country to work out details regarding the islands
before Abe and Putin meet at the upcoming G20 summit in Osaka, Japan, in
late June.

factories needed workers and were in cities, the destruction of a few
factories required the destruction of a city.

[Russian strategic nuclear submarines, which carry ballistic missiles
capable of hitting the United States mainland, are believed to be
regularly deployed in the Sea of Okhotsk]{.underline}, adjacent to
Etorofu and Kunashiri.

For Russia, [stationing a nuclear force in the area provides critical
nuclear deterrence power against the United States because strategic
nuclear submarines based there would be capable of staging a
catastrophic counterattack in case of a nuclear war.]{.underline}

Meanwhile, the channels between the four disputed islands, in particular
Etorofu and Kunashiri, are considered key routes for the Russian
submarines to travel between the Sea of Okhotsk and the Pacific Ocean,
military analysts point out.

During his annual news conference in Moscow on Dec. 20, Putin also
expressed concerns that the U.S. may deploy military units on some of
the disputed islands if Moscow ever hands them back to Japan.

"We do not know what will happen after the peace treaty is concluded,
but without an answer to this question it will be very difficult to make
any crucial decisions," he said.

[Putin]{.underline} also h[as expressed concerns over the U.S.-made
Aegis Ashore anti-missile defense units that Japan plans to deploy in
Akita and Yamaguchi prefectures to defend against any North Korean
ballistic missiles.]{.underline}

["We do not consider this to be defensive weapons; this is part of the
U.S. strategic nuclear potential placed outside. And these systems, they
are synchronized with the missile strike systems,"]{.underline} he said.

Currently thousands of Russian residents live on the disputed territory,
and Russia's central government recently beefed up the military presence
there. Isn't it politically difficult for Moscow to hand over any of the
islands?

That's another headache for Japanese diplomats engaging in territorial
talks.

As of January 2017, about 5,500 people lived on Etorofu, 8,200 on
Kunashiri and nearly 3,000 on Shikotan.

On the Habomai islet groups, only national border security guards are
stationed there, according to the Hokkaido Shimbun.

Russia, meanwhile, invested ¥48 billion from 2007 through 2015 to build
social infrastructure such as roads, ports and housing on the four
disputed islands. From 2016 through 2025, another ¥120 billion is
budgeted for the islands.

In 2016, Russia deployed anti-ship missile units on Etorofu and
Kunashiri.

[According to Kyodo News, by 2020 the Russian military plans to station
more ground-to-ship missile units so that they can cover all of the
Kuril Islands]{.underline} and the disputed islands off Hokkaido.

TOKYO (AP) --- [Russia and Japan accused each other of military buildups
as their foreign and defense ministers met in Tokyo on Thursday for
talks that failed to make progress on decades-long island
disputes.]{.underline}

[Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov said at a joint news conference
after the talks that Russia was concerned about Tokyo's plan to build a
pair of land-based Aegis Ashore missile defense systems, saying they
pose a "potential threat to Russia."]{.underline}

[The Aegis Ashore systems, planned for deployment in Akita on Japan's

guidelines approved in December, Prime Minister Shinzo Abe's government
plans to increase purchases of expensive American military equipment
including F-35 stealth fighter jets and cruise missiles as Japan

Japanese Foreign Minister Taro Kono accused Russia of a military buildup
on Russian-controlled islands claimed by both countries.

[The dispute over the islands, which Russia calls the southern Kurils
and Japan the Northern Territories, has prevented the two countries from
signing a peace treaty formally ending their World War II
hostilities.]{.underline}

"Our country's legal position does not accept the missile drills,
fighter aircraft deployment, and enhancement of the military presence in
the Northern Territories," Kono said.

Japanese Defense Minister Takeshi Iwaya told his counterpart, Sergei
Shoigu, and Lavrov that the Aegis Ashore interceptors are "purely for
defensive purposes and never for use to threaten Russia or other
countries."

Lavrov brushed off Kono's criticism, saying his country is only
operating in its own territory. "Under international law, the territory
is under Russia's sovereignty and those are Russian military activities
in Russian-held territory," he said.

[Regaining the disputed islands, which are north of Japan's northern
main island of Hokkaido, has been a priority for Abe and his
conservative base. Abe is eager to make progress on the dispute with
Russia and find opportunities to cooperate in developing oil and gas and
other natural resources.]{.underline}

In November, Abe and Russian President Vladimir Putin agreed to
accelerate negotiations based on a 1956 Soviet proposal to return two of
the islands to Japan, but progress has since stalled.

The Northern Territories [The resolution of the Northern Territories
dispute is the most important issue in Japan-Russia relations. If it is
not resolved, it will be almost impossible to conclude a Japan-Russia
Friendship Treaty and improve bilateral relations.]{.underline} However,
the two countries' perceptions of this issue differ greatly[. Japan
insists that the Northern Territories are Japanese territory and that
Tokyo must recover all four islands. Russia's position is that there is
no territorial dispute at all.]{.underline} Sometimes Russia has shown a
softer attitude and suggested that Japan should compromise by
negotiating for two islands. Yet[, even returning two islands has never
been realistic]{.underline}. Other challenges to negotiations have
included the bipolar Cold War system, international criticism of Russia,
and the Ukraine crisis. For example, the so-called "Dulles Threat
Incident" of 1956 shows the effect of the Cold War mood on the
territorial dispute. At the time, Secretary of State John Foster Dulles
told Japanese Foreign Minister Mamoru Shigemitsu that if Japan gave up
its claim to the southern Kuril Islands, then the United States might
feel obliged to retain Okinawa in perpetuity. Many academics, especially
Soviet scholars, insist that Dulles's statement was intended to prevent
a Treaty of Friendship between Japan and the USSR. However, newly
declassified documents make clear that Dulles was trying to help Japan
in the negotiations and that the U.S. government had already recognized
the Northern Territories as Japanese territory. 21 Nevertheless,
Dulles's "threat" has had a big impact, which is why Putin mentioned
that Japan should consider the implications of U.S. military bases in
Japan. There are many obstacles to Russia's return of the Northern
Territories to Japan. [Most critically, Russia insists that the Northern
Territories were the fruit of USSR's victory against Japan at the end of
World War II and that Japan abandoned all the Chishima]{.underline}
Islands under the San Francisco Peace Treaty in 1951. Japan disagrees
with these Russian arguments for three reasons. First, Japan insists
that the Northern Territories were not included in the Chishima Islands,
although some Japanese academics say that the Northern Territories were
called "South Chishima." Second, Japanese citizens see the USSR's
violation of the Soviet-Japanese Neutrality Pact as illegal, given that
the USSR denounced the pact on April 5 and then invaded Manchuria and
attacked Japan on August 9, less than the one year required to withdraw
from the Pact. Third, Japan insists that the USSR did not participate in
the San Francisco Peace Treaty, so it has no rights to territory under
that agreement. 21 Vlad M. Kaczynski, "The Kuril Islands Dispute Between
Russia and Japan," Russian Analytical Digest. 9 In addition, territory
is important for the Russian people and Moscow has emphasized the
importance of defending its territory. It is difficult for the general
public to accept the transfer of territory, so strong leaders are needed
this obstacle. Yet, it is also true that strong leaders cannot easily
abandon territory. Furthermore, the Soviet victory in the "Great
Patriotic War" is significant to the Russian people and they remember
the lives lost to attain that victory. This makes some of the people
value the land just as they value Russian lives, so abandoning the
Northern Territories would undermine the historical meaning of the
"Great Patriotic War." [Moreover, the Northern Territories are important
to Russian security. Moscow sees the United States military and the
North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) as its most serious security
threats]{.underline}. [Due to the Japan-U.S. alliance, U.S. troops could
be deployed to the Northern Territories if Russia returns them to Japan.
Putin has warned about this repeatedly. Recently, Russia has been
militarizing the Northern Territories]{.underline}, although some
experts say that this is directed against China. Russia has also been
cautious about Chinese movements, although Beijing is Moscow's most
important partner. Russian leaders do not trust their Chinese
counterparts, but they have few other options in the current
international situation. Although Russia and China have been tightening
their relationship, these ties are mainly global in nature (opposing the
unipolar U.S.-led order, cooperating on Eurasian initiatives,
coordinating energy projects, etc.) and Russia has always been cautious
of Chinese regional movements. [The Northern Territories have become
more strategically important because of the Arctic. The melting of
Arctic ice has accelerated in recent years, opening up the Northern Sea
Route, which connects the Arctic region to Asia via
Hokkaido]{.underline}. [Although the Northern Sea Route is not yet
commercially viable, many countries---including Russia, China, and
Japan---are interested in this possibility.]{.underline} The Northern
Territories are situated at the end of the route[, so Russia has
incentive to retain the islands. Japan is also concerned about the
recent Russian militarization of the Northern Territories.]{.underline}
Russia has been upgrading its weapons and has deployed new military
systems to the Northern Territories. The 18th Mechanized Artillery
Division is currently deployed on the islands. It includes 3,500
personnel and will receive modern defensive systems to protect against
attacks from the air and sea[. Japanese concerns about the
militarization of the Northern Territories have led Russian Defense
Minister Sergei Shoigu to assure Tokyo that the deployment is "not aimed
against any country, but only to protect the territory of the Russian
Federation, its borders, both from the sea and from the
air."]{.underline}22 Moscow insists that these units and formations will
be protected from airstrikes by the Tor-M2 and Buk-M2 anti-aircraft
missile systems. Russian leaders say that offensive weapons will not be
deployed on the islands, implying that the only change in that respect
will be 22 Nikolai Litovkin, ["What does Russia's militarization of the
Kuril Islands consist of?"]{.underline} Russia Beyond, March 21, 2017,

10 [the replacement of the outdated BM-21 Grad rocket launchers with the
9A52-4 Tornado.]{.underline} 23 Yet, Japanese leaders remain skeptical
of whether these Russian military moves are only for defensive purposes.
Meanwhile, substantial economic cooperation has not occurred. Even after
the agreement on joint economic activities, Russia has continued to
invite Chinese and Korean companies and factories to the Northern
Territories and the Russian Far East. In addition, Russian Prime
Minister Dmitri Medvedev signed a document that approved the
establishment of a special economic zone in Shikotan Island (one of the
Northern Territories) in August 2017. Russia is planning to build a
marine products processing factory there. Russia assumes that the plan
will attract about 7.4 billion rubles in both domestic and foreign
investment and create more than 700 jobs. However, this plan conflicts
with the joint economic activities plan. Furthermore, [Russia has
opposed making special rules for joint economic activities and instead
insists that they be conducted under Russian law. In short, Putin has
been insisting that Russia cannot negotiate with Japan without
trust]{.underline}, while he stresses that Russia and China can build
strong relations over the long term[. The Japanese proposal for joint
economic activities was intended to answer Putin's argument, but it is
now in crisis. Therefore, Russia's return of the entire Northern
Territories to Japan is extremely unlikely]{.underline}. Prime Minister
Abe has started a new approach, but the new initiative's likelihood of
success seems low. In addition, the Japanese government has to hurry to
resolve the issue because most of the former Japanese residents of the
Northern Territories have already died, so only a small number of older
residents remain alive. On the other hand, the Russification and
militarization of the islands are proceeding rapidly.

Denver\--EA)

[The Ground-based Midcourse Defense (GMD) system is currently the only
U.S. missile defense system devoted to defending the U.S. homeland from
long-range ballistic missile attacks.]{.underline} GMD and its
associated elements span 15 time zones, including Ground-based
Interceptors (GBIs) at two locations (Ft. Greely, Alaska and Vandenberg
AFB, CA), seven types of sensors on land, sea, and space, and multiple
and distributed fire control systems. By the end of 2017, there will be
44 deployed GBIs, 40 based at Ft. Greely, and four at Vandenberg AFB.
The 2015 National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) included funds to
conduct environmental reviews of potential East Coast sites for a future
addition to the GMD system. When ballistic missile defense sensors
detect a missile launch, these data are fused and fed into the GMD fire
control system, which is used to launch one or more GBIs. The GBI will
fly into the path of an incoming missile before releasing an
Exoatmospheric Kill Vehicle (EKV), which uses onboard sensors to hunt
down and physically collide with the warhead, destroying it on impact.

X-band Radar Upgraded Early Warning Radar (UEWR) GMD is designed
specifically to counter long-range ballistic missiles threatening the
U.S. homeland. It uses a three-stage booster, giving the necessary
"legs" to perform intercepts over great distances. [This range gives GMD
by far the greatest coverage area of any U.S. missile defense system,
defending all fifty states and Canada.]{.underline} Other missile
defense systems, [including Aegis, THAAD, and Patriot, are generally
classified as "regional" systems]{.underline}, and are geared toward
short to intermediate range ballistic missile threats. While some may
have homeland defense applications in certain circumstances, they have
much smaller coverage areas as compared to GMD, and generally much less
capability, if any, against ICBMs. Conversely, GMD is not capable of
shorter range, regional defense missions. North Korea's short and medium
range missiles threatening South Korea and Japan, for example, fall
outside of GMD's engagement envelope. These threats require other
solutions, such as Aegis, THAAD, or Patriot. The GMD architecture
emerged from the development of the Clinton Administration's National
Missile Defense (NMD) program. The Ballistic Missile Defense
Organization (BMDO) formed the initial Joint Program Office for the NMD
program in April 1997, with the goal of conducting an integrated test in
1999 and operational deployment by 2003.1 Flight testing of Ground-based
interceptors began in 1997, with the first successful intercept in 1999.
Findings from the 1998 Rumsfeld Commission report asserted that the
United States had underestimated the ballistic missile threat. This
reassessment provided impetus for Congress to pass the [1999 National
Missile Defense Act, which committed the United States "to deploy as
soon as is technologically possible an effective National Missile
Defense system capable of defending the territory of the United States
against limited ballistic missile attack."]{.underline}2 The Clinton
administration ultimately deferred the decision to deploy homeland
missile defense to the next administration. In December 2001, the George
W. Bush Administration announced that it would withdraw the United
States from the 1972 Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty, which opened the
door to accelerated investment in a homeland missile defense system. In
2002, the White House issued National Security Presidential Directive 23
(NSPD-23), ordering the deployment of an initial limited homeland
defense capability by 2004. In 2002, then-Secretary of State Donald
Rumsfeld redesignated the BMDO as the Missile Defense Agency (MDA).3 In
2004, Lt. Gen. Henry "Trey" Obering, III, USAF, the Director of MDA,
declared limited defensive operations including five GBIs in silos at
Fort Greely, Alaska; an upgraded Cobra Dane Radar at Eareckson Air
Station in Shemya, Alaska; and an upgraded radar at Fylingdales in the
United Kingdom. The GMD system was intended to grow to 44 GBIs
distributed between Fort Greely and Vandenberg Air Force Base.4 In
addition, the Bush Administration proposed a European GMD site to
counter the future development of an Iranian ICBM. This component of the
GMD system would have included an additional ten GBIs in Poland and an
X-band radar in the Czech Republic.5 In 2009, the Obama Administration
announced the cancellation the European GMD sites proposed by the Bush
Administration in favor of the European Phased Adaptive Approach.6 The
administration also capped the planned GBI deployments to 30, a
reduction from the 44 planned under Bush.7 In 2013, then-Defense
Secretary Chuck Hagel announced a reversal of the decision to reduce the
U.S. based interceptors and reconstituted a plan to deploy 44 GBIs by
2017.8 In 2015, the administration also awarded a contract to build the
S-band Long Range Discrimination Radar (LRDR) at Clear Air Force Station
in Alaska to improve the discrimination capability of the radars in the
system.9 The FY 2016 NDAA authorized \$1.8 billion in funding for the
GMD system to improve the CE-II kill vehicle, develop a Redesigned Kill
Vehicle (RKV), invest in the LRDR, and support advancements in a
selectable two or three stage GBI booster.10

commitments by Beijing to avoid development of destabilizing Multiple

view, TMD development would lead not to deployment, but to
disarmament.27 [These arguments are unlikely to be persuasive to Chinese

be effective to offset Chinese "missile blackmail" capability. TMD would
enhance Japan's political stature while lowering that of China---and

Second, the credibility of the US -- its commitments as well as

being tested in the Korean peninsula, and this is not only being watched
in Beijing. We have already seen how the Obama administration's backing

elsewhere]{.underline}. In a similar vein, [should Washington trade away
THAAD deployment in the ROK as a bargaining chip for more genuine and
productive cooperation from Beijing]{.underline} in coercing the DPRK[,
it would send a signal to us, on NATO's eastern flank, that the US
military posture is a tradeable commodity in "doing good deals" between
the "big boys".]{.underline}

#### NATO collapse destroys the global international order. 

**Binnendijk 3/19** (Hans Binnendijk, senior fellow at the Center for
Transatlantic Relations at Johns Hopkins' School for Advanced
International Studies, served on the National Security Council staff as
Special Assistant to the President and Senior Director for Defense
Policy and Arms Control., 5 consequences of a life without NATO, Defense

The fourth [consequences of life without NATO would be global. American
bilateral alliances in Asia would each be shaken to their core should
NATO fail]{.underline}. [America's defense commitments there would
become worthless]{.underline}. With China determined to claim a dominant
position in Asia, [the collapse of NATO would cause America's Asian
partners to seek accommodation with China]{.underline}, much as the
Philippines is in the process of doing.

Trump's decision to abandon the economic Trans-Pacific Partnership
agreement has already given China new advantages in the region. Without
credible American security commitments, there would be little to stop
China from controlling the South China Sea and probably occupying Taiwan
as well. Add to this equation the new footholds that China is building
in central Asia, Africa and Europe: Abandoning NATO would help assure
China's competitive success.

[The final impact of NATO's retirement would be the near collapse of
what has been called the "liberal international order." This order
consists of treaties, alliances, agreements, institutions and modes of
behavior mostly created by the United States in an effort to safeguard
democracies.]{.underline}

[This order has kept relative peace in the trans-Atlantic space for
seven decades]{.underline}. The Trump administration has begun to
unravel elements of this order in the naive notion that they undercut
American sovereignty. [The entire European project is built on the
edifice of this order. NATO is its principal keystone. Collapsing this
edifice would undercut the multiple structures that have brought seven
decades of peace and prosperity.]{.underline}

So the answer is clear. [Life without NATO would be more dangerous and
less prosperous. Russia and China would be the big winners at America's
expense. NATO simply can't retire.]{.underline}

Yes, NATO has problems. It needs to be managed. But there is too much
left to be done for retirement. And there is too much to lose if NATO
fails.

"America Isn't as Powerful as It Thinks It Is"
<https://foreignpolicy.com/2019/04/26/america-isnt-as-powerful-as-it-thinks-it-is/>
//HL

Just how powerful is the United States? Is it still the unipolar power,
able to impose its will on adversaries, allies, and neutrals, and force
them---however reluctantly---to go along with policies they think are
foolish, dangerous, or simply contrary to their interests? Or are there
clear and significant limits to U.S. power, suggesting that it should be
more selective and strategic in setting goals and pursuing them? [The
Trump administration has embraced the first position, especially since
John Bolton became White House national security advisor and Mike Pompeo
took over as secretary of state. Whatever President Donald Trump's
initial instincts may have been, their arrival marked a return to the
unilateralist, take-no-prisoners approach to foreign policy that
characterized George W. Bush's first term as president, when Vice
President Dick Cheney and the neoconservatives held sway.]{.underline} A
key feature of that earlier period was the assumption that the United
States was so powerful that it could go it alone on many issues and that
other states could be cowed into submission by demonstrations of U.S.
power and resolve. As a senior advisor to Bush (reportedly Karl Rove)
[told](https://www.nytimes.com/2004/10/17/magazine/faith-certainty-and-the-presidency-of-george-w-bush.html)
the journalist Ron Suskind: "We're an empire now, and when we act, we
create our own reality." Compromises and coalition-building were for
wimps and appeasers; as Cheney himself [reportedly
said](http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/04/24/AR2008042401459_pf.html)
in 2003: "We don't negotiate with evil; we defeat it." [The Bush-Cheney
approach produced a string of failures, but the same unilateral
arrogance lives on in the Trump administration. It is evident in Trump's
decision to threaten (or in some cases, to actually begin) trade wars
not just with China but with many of America's economic partners. It was
part and parcel of the impulsive decisions to abandon the Trans-Pacific
Partnership and leave the Paris climate accord. It is the basis of the
administration's "take it or leave it" approach to diplomacy with North
Korea and Iran, wherein Washington announces unrealistic demands and
then ratchets up sanctions in the hope that the targets will capitulate
and give the United States everything it wants, even though this
approach to both countries has repeatedly failed in the
past.]{.underline} It is even more obvious in the recent decision to
[impose](https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2019/04/21/no-more-waivers-united-states-will-try-force-iranian-oil-exports-zero/?noredirect=on&utm_term=.259676307a0c)
secondary sanctions on states that are still buying Iranian oil, a move
that threatens [to drive up oil
prices](https://www.wsj.com/articles/u-s-ends-waivers-for-countries-to-import-iranian-oil-11555937349)
and [damage U.S.
relations](https://www.atlanticcouncil.org/blogs/new-atlanticist/trump-ends-sanctions-waivers-for-countries-importing-iranian-oil)
with China, India, Turkey, Japan, South Korea, and others. It is almost
certainly true of the so-called peace plan that nepotist-in-chief Jared
Kushner, Trump's son-in-law and senior advisor, keeps promising to
reveal, a proposal likely to make Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu, Republican donor Sheldon Adelson, and other fans of the
concept of Greater Israel happy but won't advance the cause of peace in
the slightest. A similar faith in America's vast ability to control
outcomes can also be seen in the premature recognition of Juan Guaidó as
interim president of Venezuela and the strident U.S.
[demands](https://www.miamiherald.com/opinion/article228271734.html)
that "Maduro must go." However desirable that outcome would be, it would
be nice if we had some idea how to bring it about. [The underlying
assumption behind all of these policies is that U.S. pressure---you
know, what Pompeo likes to call
"[swagger](https://foreignpolicy.com/2018/05/01/mike-pompeos-first-mission-restore-state-departments-swagger-trump-diplomacy-rex-tillerson-first-speech-in-washington/)"---will
eventually force acknowledged adversaries to do whatever it is the
United States demands of them, and that other states won't find ways to
evade, obstruct, divert, dilute, hedge, hinder, or otherwise negate what
Washington is trying to do. It assumes we are still dwelling in the
unipolar moment and that all that matters is the will to use the power
at America's disposal. Perhaps most important, this approach denies that
there are any real trade-offs between any of these objectives. If the
United States is really all-powerful, then sanctioning China over oil
purchases from Iran won't have any impact on the trade talks that are
now underway with Beijing, and Turkey won't respond to the same pressure
by moving closer to Russia]{.underline}. It further assumes that
America's NATO allies are so desperate to keep the U.S. military in
Europe that they will accept repeated humiliations and follow the U.S.
lead against China, despite the [growing
evidence](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/politics/2019/04/23/theresa-may-defies-security-warnings-ministers-us-allow-huawei/)
that this is not the case. It sees no downsides to going all-in with
Egypt, Israel, Saudi Arabia, and the Gulf, and it sees little risk
should relations with Iran or others escalate to war. To be fair, it is
not hard to understand why hawks think they can get away with this
approach to foreign policy, at least in the short term. Despite many
recent missteps, the United States is still very powerful. Its active
assistance is still something that some other states want, and its
["focused
enmity"](https://www.belfercenter.org/publication/stability-unipolar-world)
is something no state can completely ignore. The United States is still
a vast and valuable market, the dollar remains the world's main reserve
currency, and the ability to cut other states or financial institutions
off from the infrastructure of global finance gives Washington unusual
leverage. Many U.S. allies are accustomed to deferring to Washington and
are understandably reluctant to do anything that might encourage the
United States to withdraw support. Trump and company can also count on
the support of authoritarian soul mates in the European right (including
the present rulers in Poland and Hungary), as well as America's morally
compromised allies in the Middle East. Plus, most Americans don't care
all that much about foreign policy and are usually willing to go along
with whatever the executive branch is doing, provided that it doesn't
prove too costly or embarrassing. [Nonetheless, there are even more
potent reasons why this bullying approach has produced no major
foreign-policy successes so far and is unlikely to yield significant
success in the future. First of all, even much weaker states are loath
to succumb to blackmail, for one very good reason: Once you've shown you
can be coerced, there may be no end to subsequent demands. Moreover,
when the United States insists on complete capitulation (i.e., by
calling for total North Korean disarmament or regime change in Iran), it
gives the target state zero incentive to comply.]{.underline} And given
Trump's amply demonstrated dishonesty and fickle approach to diplomacy,
why would any foreign leader believe any assurances he (or Pompeo) might
give? Put all this together, and you have a perfect recipe for "no
deal." [Second, bullying nearly everyone makes it much harder construct
powerful coalitions whose support can enhance America's diplomatic
leverage.]{.underline} This problem is perhaps most apparent in the
administration's haphazard approach to economic diplomacy with China. By
leaving the Trans-Pacific Partnership and picking trade fights with
other key partners, the administration missed an opportunity to organize
a broad coalition of industrial powers united by a desire to get China
to reform its own economic practices. Trump's trade team may still get
some sort of deal with Beijing, but it won't be as good as what they
could have achieved with a more sophisticated and cooperative effort.
Much the same lesson applies to Iran. The Trump administration
deliberately set out to kill the Iran nuclear deal, and it did it in
plain sight. It is [so
focused](https://www.theamericanconservative.com/larison/our-iran-policy-is-run-by-fanatics/)
on this goal that it is even willing to punish the other signatories in
a vain attempt to get Iran to say uncle. Tehran has continued to abide
by the terms of the agreement despite Washington's reneging on the deal,
but its patience is probably not infinite, especially when the
administration has made it clear that regime change is its real
objective. Should Iran eventually restart its nuclear weapons
program---which has been in abeyance for more than a decade---the rest
of the world is not going to suddenly line up behind the United States
and support more forceful action. Why? Because everyone knows that it
was the United States---not Iran---that killed the deal, and there won't
be a ton of sympathy for America when it starts bleating about Iran's
response. America's Middle East clients will no doubt be happy if
Washington decides to fight another war on their behalf, but don't count
on a lot of help from them or from anyone else. [Third, other states
don't like being beholden to the whims of others, and especially when
others behave selfishly, erratically, and with ill-disguised contempt
for others' interests. Not surprisingly, therefore, other states are
starting to develop workarounds designed to limit U.S. leverage, most
notably by designing financial arrangements outside the network of
institutions that Washington has been using to coerce allies and
adversaries into compliance]{.underline}. As Henry Farrell and Abraham
Newman recently
[wrote](https://foreignpolicy.com/2019/04/24/by-punishing-iran-trump-is-weakening-america/)
in FP, "instead of leading states and businesses to minimize contact
with the targets of U.S. sanctions," the Trump administration's
strong-arm tactics "may lead states and businesses to minimize their
contact with the U.S.-led global financial system and to start to
construct their own workarounds. Over time, those workarounds might even
begin to accumulate into an effective alternative system." [Lastly,
being a bully encourages adversaries to join forces out of their own
self-interest, while giving potential allies more reason to keep their
distance. It is no accident that Russia and China continue to move
closer together---even though they are not natural allies, and a smarter
U.S. approach could give Moscow reasons to distance itself from
Beijing---and America's same bullying impulses are going to push states
like Iran even closer to them.]{.underline} Bolton and those of his ilk
will probably come up with some trite new moniker for this group---"Axis
of Evil" and "Troika of Tyranny" are taken, so perhaps "Triad of
Troublemakers" or "Coalition of Chaos"---ignoring the fact that their
own policies have helped push these powers together. What we are
witnessing, therefore, is a real-world test of two competing visions of
contemporary geopolitics. One version sees U.S. power as essentially
undiminished and believes that a combination of material capabilities,
favorable geography, and entrenched institutional capabilities will
allow it to pursue an ambitious and revisionist foreign policy at little
cost and with a high probability of success. [The second version---to
which I subscribe---sees the United States as very powerful and in a
privileged position (for various reasons) but also believes there are
limits to U.S. power and that it is necessary to set priorities,
minimize trade-offs when possible, and collaborate with others on many
issues. It also assumes that others cannot be browbeaten into abject
capitulation and that effective and durable international agreements
require a degree of mutual compromise, even with
adversaries.]{.underline}

of Arms Sales in U.S. Foreign Policy,"
<https://www.cato.org/publications/policy-analysis/risky-business-role-arms-sales-us-foreign-policy#_idTextAnchor039)>

[The hidden assumption]{.underline} underlying the balance of power
strategy [is that the United States will be able to predict accurately
what the impact of its arms sales will be]{.underline}. If the goal is
deterrence, for example, the assumption is that an arms sale will be
sufficient to deter the adversary without spawning an arms race. [If the
goal is to promote stability, the assumption is that an arms sale will
in fact reduce tensions and inhibit conflict rather than inflame
tensions and help initiate conflict.]{.underline} [These
assumptions]{.underline}, in turn, [depend on both the recipient nation
and that nation's neighbors and adversaries acting in ways that don't
make things worse.]{.underline}

As it turns out, these are often poor assumptions. [Although arms sales
certainly enhance the military capability of the recipient nation, the
fundamental problem is that arms sales often initiate a long chain of
responses that the United States generally cannot control.]{.underline}
The United States, after all, is not the only country with interests in
regional balances, especially where the survival and security of local
actors is at stake. The United States is neither the only major power
with a keen interest in critical regions like Asia and the Middle East,
nor the only source of weapons and other forms of assistance. Nor can it
dictate the perceptions, interests, or actions of the other nations
involved in a given region. For example, [though a nation receiving arms
from the United States may enjoy enhanced defensive capabilities, it is
also likely to enjoy enhanced offensive capabilities.]{.underline} With
these, a nation's calculations about the potential benefits of war,
intervention abroad, or even the use of force against its own population
may shift decisively. Saudi Arabia's recent behavior illustrates this
dynamic. Though the Saudis explain their arms purchases as necessary for
defense against Iranian pressure, Saudi Arabia has also spent the past
two years embroiled in a military intervention in Yemen.

Likewise, [arms sales can heighten regional security
dilemmas]{.underline}. Neighbors of nations buying major conventional
weapons will also worry about what this enhanced military capability
will mean. This raises the chances that they too will seek to arm
themselves further, or take other steps to shift the balance of power
back in their favor, or, in the extreme case, to launch a preventive war
before they are attacked. Given these dynamics, [the consequences of
arms sales to manage regional balances of power are far less predictable
and often much less positive than advocates
assume.]{.underline}[^54^](https://www.cato.org/publications/policy-analysis/risky-business-role-arms-sales-us-foreign-policy#_idTextAnchor054)

This unpredictability characterizes even straightforward-seeming efforts
to manage the balance of power. The most basic claim of arms sales
advocates is that U.S. arms sales to friendly governments and allies
should make them better able to deter adversaries. The best available
evidence, however, suggests a more complicated reality. In a study of
arms sales from 1950 to 1995, major-power arms sales to existing allies
had no effect on the chance that the recipient would be the target of a
military attack. Worse, recipients of U.S. arms that were not treaty
allies were significantly **[more likely]{.underline}** to become
targets.[^55^](https://www.cato.org/publications/policy-analysis/risky-business-role-arms-sales-us-foreign-policy#_idTextAnchor055)

[Nor is there much evidence that arms sales can help the United States
promote peace and regional stability by calibrating the local balance of
power]{.underline}. On this score, in fact, the evidence suggests that
the default assumption should be the opposite. Most scholarly work
concludes that [arms sales exacerbate instability and increase the
likelihood of
conflict]{.underline}.[^56^](https://www.cato.org/publications/policy-analysis/risky-business-role-arms-sales-us-foreign-policy#_idTextAnchor056)One
study, for example, found that during the Cold War, U.S. and Soviet arms
sales to hostile dyads (e.g., India/Pakistan, Iran/Iraq,
Ethiopia/Somalia) "contributed to hostile political relations and
imbalanced military relationships" and were "profoundly
destabilizing."[^57^](https://www.cato.org/publications/policy-analysis/risky-business-role-arms-sales-us-foreign-policy#_idTextAnchor057)

[There is]{.underline} also [good reason]{.underline} to believe that
[several factors are making the promotion of regional stability through
arms sales more difficult]{.underline}. [The shrinking U.S. military
advantage]{.underline} over other powers such as China and the
increasingly competitive global arms market both [make it less likely
that U.S. arms sales can make a decisive difference]{.underline}. As
William Hartung argued as early as 1990, "the notion of using arms
transfers to maintain a carefully calibrated regional balance of power
seems increasingly archaic in today's arms market, in which a potential
U.S. adversary is as likely to be receiving weapons from U.S. allies
like Italy or France as it is from former or current
adversaries."[^58^](https://www.cato.org/publications/policy-analysis/risky-business-role-arms-sales-us-foreign-policy#_idTextAnchor058)

In sum, the academic and historical evidence indicates that although the
United States can use arms sales to enhance the military capabilities of
other nations and thereby shift the local and regional balance of power,
its ability to dictate specific outcomes through such efforts is
severely limited.

[Arms for (Not That Much) Influence]{.underline}. [Successful foreign
policy involves encouraging other nations to behave in ways that benefit
the United States.]{.underline} As noted, [the United States has often
attempted to use arms sales to generate the sort of leverage or
influence necessary to do this. History reveals, however, that the
benefits of the arms for influence strategy are limited for two main
reasons.]{.underline}

[First, the range of cases in which arms sales can produce useful
leverage is much narrower than is often imagined]{.underline}. Most
obviously, [arms sales are unnecessary in situations where the other
country already agrees or complies with the American position or can be
encouraged to do so without such incentives.]{.underline} This category
includes most U.S. allies and close partners under many, though not all,
circumstances.

Just as clearly, [the arms for influence strategy is a nonstarter when
the other state will never agree to comply with American
demands]{.underline}. This category [includes a small group of obvious
cases such as Russia, China, Iran, and other potential
adversaries]{.underline} (to which the United States does not sell
weapons anyway), but it also includes a much larger group of cases in
which the other state opposes what the United States wants, or in which
complying with U.S. wishes would be politically too dangerous for that
state's
leadership.[^59^](https://www.cato.org/publications/policy-analysis/risky-business-role-arms-sales-us-foreign-policy#_idTextAnchor059)

In addition, [there are some cases in which the United States itself
would view arms sales as an inappropriate tool]{.underline}. The Leahy
Law, for example, bars the United States from providing security
assistance to any specific foreign military unit deemed responsible for
past human rights
abuses.[^60^](https://www.cato.org/publications/policy-analysis/risky-business-role-arms-sales-us-foreign-policy#_idTextAnchor060) More
broadly, [arms sales are clearly a risky choice when the recipient state
is a failed state or when it is engaged in a civil conflict or
interstate war.]{.underline} Indeed, in such cases it is often unclear
whether there is anyone to negotiate with in the first place, and
governments are at best on shaky ground. At present the United States
bars 17 such nations from purchasing American arms. As long as these
nations are embargoed, arms sales will remain an irrelevant option for
exerting
influence.[^61^](https://www.cato.org/publications/policy-analysis/risky-business-role-arms-sales-us-foreign-policy#_idTextAnchor061)

Apart from these cases, there is a large group of nations with tiny
defense budgets that simply don't buy enough major conventional weaponry
to provide much incentive for arms sales. On this list are as many as
112 countries that purchased less than \$100 million in arms from the
United States between 2002 and 2016, including Venezuela, Jamaica, and
Sudan. Lest this category be dismissed because it includes mostly
smaller and less strategically significant countries from the American
perspective, it should be noted that each of these countries has a vote
in the United Nations (and other international organizations) and that
many of them suffer from civil conflicts and terrorism, making them
potential targets of interest for American policymakers looking for
international influence.

By definition, then, [the arms-for-influence strategy is limited to
cases in which a currently noncompliant country might be willing to
change its policies]{.underline} (at least for the right price or to
avoid punishment).

[The second problem]{.underline} with the arms for influence strategy
[is that international pressure in general, whether in the form of
economic sanctions, arms sales and embargoes, or military and foreign
aid promises and threats, typically has a very limited impact on state
behavior]{.underline}. Though again, on paper, the logic of both
coercion and buying compliance looks straightforward, research shows
that leaders make decisions on the basis of factors other than just the
national balance sheet. In particular, [leaders tend to respond far more
to concerns about national security and their own regime security than
they do to external pressure. Arms sales]{.underline}, whether used as
carrots or sticks, [are in effect a fairly weak version of economic
sanctions]{.underline}, which research has shown have limited effects,
even when approved by the United Nations, and tend to spawn a host of
unintended consequences. As such, the expectations for their utility
should be even more
limited.[^62^](https://www.cato.org/publications/policy-analysis/risky-business-role-arms-sales-us-foreign-policy#_idTextAnchor062) A
recent study regarding the impact of economic sanctions came to a
similar conclusion, noting that, "The economic impact of sanctions may
be pronounced ... but other factors in the situational context almost
always overshadow the impact of sanctions in determining the political
outcome."[^63^](https://www.cato.org/publications/policy-analysis/risky-business-role-arms-sales-us-foreign-policy#_idTextAnchor063) The
authors of another study evaluating the impact of military aid concur,
arguing that, "[In general we find that military aid does not lead to
more cooperative behavior on the part of the recipient state. With
limited exceptions, increasing levels of U.S. aid are linked to a
significant reduction in cooperative foreign policy
behavior]{.underline}."[^64^](https://www.cato.org/publications/policy-analysis/risky-business-role-arms-sales-us-foreign-policy#_idTextAnchor064)

Perhaps the most explicit evidence of the difficulty the United States
has had exerting this kind of leverage came during the Reagan
administration. Sen. Robert Kasten Jr. (R-WI) signaled the concern of
many when he said, "Many countries to whom we dispense aid continue to
thumb their noses at us" at the United Nations, and Congress passed
legislation authorizing the president to limit aid to any state that
repeatedly voted in opposition to the United States at the
UN.[^65^](https://www.cato.org/publications/policy-analysis/risky-business-role-arms-sales-us-foreign-policy#_idTextAnchor065) In
1986, the Reagan administration began to monitor voting patterns and
issue threats, and, in roughly 20 cases in 1987 and 1988, it lowered the
amount of aid sent to nations the administration felt were not
deferential enough. An analysis of the results, however, found no
linkage between changes in American support and UN voting patterns by
recipient states. The authors' conclusion fits neatly within the broader
literature about the limited impact of sanctions: "The resilience of aid
recipients clearly demonstrates that their policies were driven more
powerfully by interests other than the economic threat of a
hegemon."[^66^](https://www.cato.org/publications/policy-analysis/risky-business-role-arms-sales-us-foreign-policy#_idTextAnchor066)

[The U.S. track record of generating influence through arms sales
specifically is quite mixed]{.underline}. [U.S. arms sales may have
improved Israeli security over the years]{.underline}, for example[, but
American attempts to pressure Israel into negotiating a durable peace
settlement with the Palestinians have had little impact. Nor have arms
sales provided the United States with enough leverage over the years to
prevent client states such as Iraq, Iran, Turkey, Indonesia, and Morocco
from invading their neighbors.]{.underline} [Nor have arms sales helped
restrain the human rights abuses of clients like Chile or Libya, or
various Middle Eastern client states. Although the United States has
used the promise of arms sales or the threat of denying arms
successfully from time to time, the failures outnumber the
victories]{.underline}. The most rigorous study conducted to tease out
the conditions under which arms for influence efforts are successful is
a 1994 study by John
Sislin.[^67^](https://www.cato.org/publications/policy-analysis/risky-business-role-arms-sales-us-foreign-policy#_idTextAnchor067) Collating
191 attempts between 1950 and 1992, Sislin codes 80 of those attempts
(42 percent) successful. Sislin's analysis is incomplete, however, since
he looks only at the immediate benefits of arms sales and does not
consider the long-term consequences.

Furthermore, a close look at the supposedly successful attempts reveals
that many of them are cases in which the United States is in fact simply
buying something rather than actually "influencing" another nation.
Thirty of the cases Sislin coded as successful were instances of the
United States using arms to buy access to military bases (20 cases) or
to raw materials (5 cases) or to encourage countries to buy more
American weapons (5
cases).[^68^](https://www.cato.org/publications/policy-analysis/risky-business-role-arms-sales-us-foreign-policy#_idTextAnchor068) Without
those in the dataset, the U.S. success rate drops to 31 percent.

Finally, [the conditions for successful leverage seeking appear to be
deteriorating]{.underline}. First, Sislin's study found that American
influence was at its height during the Cold War when American power
overshadowed the rest of the world. [With the leveling out of the global
distribution of power, both economic and military, the ability of the
United States to exert influence has waned]{.underline}, regardless of
the specific tool being used. Second, as noted above, [the U.S. share of
the global arms market has declined as the industry has become more
competitive and, as a result, American promises and threats carry less
weight than before.]{.underline} As William Hartung noted, "The odds
\[of\] buying political loyalty via arms transfers are incalculably
higher \[worse\] in a world in which there are dozens of nations to turn
to in shopping for major combat
equipment."[^69^](https://www.cato.org/publications/policy-analysis/risky-business-role-arms-sales-us-foreign-policy#_idTextAnchor069)

[So far we have argued that arms sales lack a compelling strategic
justification, amplify risks, and generate a host of unintended negative
consequences. These factors alone argue for significantly curtailing the
arms trade]{.underline}. But the case for doing so is made even stronger
by the fact that greatly reducing arms sales would also produce two
significant benefits for the United States that cannot otherwise be
enjoyed.

[The first benefit from reducing arms sales would be greater diplomatic
flexibility and leverage]{.underline}. Critics might argue that even if
arms sales are an imperfect tool, forgoing arms sales will eliminate a
potential source of leverage. We argue that, on the contrary, **[the
diplomatic gains from forgoing arms sales will outweigh the potential
leverage or other benefits from arms sales]{.underline}**. Most
importantly, by refraining from arming nations engaged in conflict, [the
United States will have the diplomatic flexibility to engage with all
parties as an honest broker]{.underline}. The inherent difficulty of
negotiating while arming one side is obvious today with respect to North
and South Korea. After decades of U.S. support for South Korea, North
Korea clearly does not trust the United States. Similarly, U.S. attempts
to help negotiate a peace deal between the Israelis and Palestinians
have long been complicated by American support for Israel. [To stop
arming one side of a contentious relationship is not to suggest that the
United States does not have a preferred outcome in such cases. Rather,
by staying out of the military domain the United States can more readily
encourage dialogue and diplomacy.]{.underline}

[Forgoing arms sales is likely to be a superior strategy even in cases
where the United States has an entrenched interest]{.underline}. In the
case of Taiwan, for example, though [it is clear that Taiwan needs to
purchase weapons from other countries to provide for its defense, those
weapons do not have to be made in the United States]{.underline}.
[Having Taiwan buy from other suppliers would help defuse U.S.-China
tensions.]{.underline} Even if Taiwan's defenses remained robust, China
would clearly prefer a situation in which American arms no longer signal
an implicit promise to fight on Taiwan's behalf. This could also promote
more productive U.S.-China diplomacy in general, as well as greater
stability in the Pacific region. Most important, [breaking off arms
sales would also reduce the likelihood of the United States becoming
entangled in a future conflict between Taiwan and China.]{.underline}

T[he second major benefit of reducing arms sales is that it would imbue
the United States with greater moral authority.]{.underline} Today, as
[the leading arms-dealing nation in the world, the United States lacks
credibility in discussions of arms control and
nonproliferation]{.underline}, especially in light of its military
interventionism since 2001. By showing the world that it is ready to
choose diplomacy over the arms trade, the United States would provide a
huge boost to international efforts to curtail proliferation and its
negative consequences. This is important because the United States has
pursued and will continue to pursue a wide range of arms control and
nonproliferation objectives. [The United States is a signatory of
treaties dealing with weapons of mass destruction, missile technology,
land mines, and cluster munitions, not to mention the flow of
conventional weapons of all kinds. The effectiveness of these treaties,
and the ability to create more effective and enduring arms control and
nonproliferation frameworks, however, depends on how the United States
behaves.]{.underline}

This is not to say that unilateral American action will put an end to
the problems of the global arms trade. States would still seek to ensure
their security and survival through deterrence and military strength.
Other weapons suppliers would, in the short run, certainly race to meet
the demand. But history shows that global nonproliferation treaties and
weapons bans typically require great-power support. In 1969, for
example, Richard Nixon decided to shutter the American
offensive-biological-weapons program and seek an international ban on
such weapons. By 1972 the Biological Weapons Convention passed and has
since been signed by 178
nations.[^98^](https://www.cato.org/publications/policy-analysis/risky-business-role-arms-sales-us-foreign-policy#_idTextAnchor098) In
1991 President George H. W. Bush unilaterally renounced the use of
chemical weapons. By 1993 the United States had signed the Chemical
Weapons Convention, which now has 192
signatories.[^99^](https://www.cato.org/publications/policy-analysis/risky-business-role-arms-sales-us-foreign-policy#_idTextAnchor099) Both
of these efforts succeeded in part because the United States took
decisive early action in the absence of any promises about how others
would
respond.[^100^](https://www.cato.org/publications/policy-analysis/risky-business-role-arms-sales-us-foreign-policy#_idTextAnchor100) Without
U.S. leadership, any effort to limit proliferation of major conventional
weapons and dangerous emerging technologies is likely to fail.

#### Japan is not ready to get into any more agreements-fears Seoul

[Pressure on Beijing's island building in the disputed seas has eased
since defence ministers from Japan and South Korea failed to negotiate
security. The pair were due to meet at the Asian security forum in
Singapore until it was decided formal talks would be "premature", South
China Morning Post (SCMP) reported. International relations expert
Stephen Nagy said the only winner between the two US allies would be
China.]{.underline}

Mr Nagy told SCMP: "My sense is that Japan sees South Korea as not
engaging in negotiations on a number of issues and not adhering in good
faith to agreements that it has already signed.

"[Japan is not ready to get into any more agreements because it fears
that Seoul will not follow through or that they will become politicised
in the future.]{.underline}

"Tokyo wants binding, long-lasting agreements rather than having to
renegotiate something each time a new Korean government comes in.

"The biggest winner in this stand-off between the US' two most important
allies in the region is, of course, China. "They must be delighted to
see this playing out because it means the US is not able to exert nearly
as much pressure in areas such as the South China Sea."

The US has vowed to keep the Indo-Pacific free and open.

They have conducted several freedom of navigation operations in the area
to push back China's claims on the sea.

[China claims almost all of the strategic South China Sea with Brunei,
Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines, Taiwan and Vietnam pushing
competing claims to parts of the maritime region.]{.underline}

[Mr Nagy added: "If Japan, South Korea and the US could find a way to
cooperate, imagine the influence they could exert over the South China
Sea or over North Korea.]{.underline}

["If Japan and Korea could find a way to put their differences aside and
with their security capacity, it would be a powerful deterrent to
Beijing and Pyongyang."]{.underline}

Another expert, Toshimitsu Shigemura, told SCMP: "By avoiding talks in
Singapore, Japan is doing its best to avoid public problems between the
two sides and I believe that talks are already taking place between the
two governments on these issues.

#### China is developing new capabilities and operational concepts and will continue to no matter what 

Brands 6-18-19 (Hal Brands, , \"New U.S. Indo-Pacific Strategy Isn't
Going to Scare China,\" Bloomberg,
<https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2019-06-18/u-s-indo-pacific-strategy-isn-t-going-to-scare-china>
)

The Trump administration has taken [the next step toward fleshing out
its approach to China, by releasing the Pentagon's Indo-Pacific Strategy
Report. The 64-page paper deals with a number of regional security
issues, but it focuses primarily on how to preserve a congenial climate
as an ambitious, autocratic China asserts its growing
influence.]{.underline}

Those who are looking for a fresh, definitive answer to this question
are going to be disappointed. The main thrusts of the document are
familiar; they date back to the Barack Obama years and even before.
Where the Indo-Pacific report is more interesting is in highlighting ---
intentionally and unintentionally --- the key challenges the U.S. has
yet to overcome.

[The Indo-Pacific strategy is essentially a follow-on to the National
Security Strategy and National Defense Strategy, two documents that put
the threat from revisionist great powers --- especially
China]{.underline} --- at the center of U.S. policy. The report
[describes the Indo-Pacific as America's "priority theater," because
that region is likely to be the engine of economic growth and the
epicenter of geopolitical rivalry in the 21st century. To shore up an
eroding U.S. position and prevent China from achieving hegemony, the
Defense Department will pursue three interlocking
initiatives.]{.underline}

[First, the Pentagon will enhance U.S. preparedness to defeat potential
Chinese aggression, by developing new capabilities and operational
concepts to offset Beijing's growing military might. Second, it will
expand and deepen U.S. partnerships in the region, to form a broader
regional coalition against malign Chinese behavior. And it will improve
upon the existing system of bilateral U.S. alliances and partnerships by
networking these relationships into a larger, more cohesive whole. By
doing all this, America can preserve a "free and open Indo-Pacific" ---
a region in which nations can trade freely, maintain their sovereignty,
and avoid being dominated by Beijing.]{.underline}

This strategy, like the previous strategy documents, thus takes a sharp
rhetorical line toward China. It weaves in some of the new initiatives
the Trump administration has taken, such as reviving the "Quad" (an
informal partnership linking the U.S., Japan, Australia and India) and
encouraging European allies to increase their naval activities. The
report also breaks with precedent by describing Taiwan as a country ---
a designation sure to infuriate Beijing, which views it as a wayward
province.

These innovations aside, however, much of the report seems ripped from
the Obama years. [The ideas of countering China's military buildup while
also modernizing, expanding and integrating U.S. security relationships
were at the heart of Obama's China policy. Indeed, the broad
descriptions of U.S. strategy could have been taken directly from
then-Secretary of Defense Ash Carter's speeches on China in the last two
years of Obama's presidency.]{.underline}

[There is nothing inherently wrong with this: The basic strategic
requirements of deterring Beijing and bolstering the U.S. position in
the region haven't changed much since 2015-2016, even if China's
challenge has become more severe.]{.underline} The most revealing aspect
of the Indo-Pacific strategy, then, is the way in which the document
highlights --- sometimes explicitly, sometimes implicitly --- the most
daunting problems the U.S. faces in meeting that Chinese challenge.

The first is the question of how to prevent the fait accompli. China
still cannot defeat the U.S. in a long war if America brings all of its
power to bear. But Beijing could use the advantages of surprise and
geography to quickly grab key territory --- Taiwan or the Senkaku
Islands, for instance --- and then force Washington to decide whether to
pay the high, perhaps prohibitive, price of liberation.

The Indo-Pacific report is admirably candid in discussing this problem.
Unfortunately, the Defense Department is only beginning to solve it.

David Ochmanek of the RAND Corporation has argued that defeating a
Chinese invasion of Taiwan would require damaging or destroying more
than 300 Chinese naval vessels in the first 72 hours. That, in turn,
would require vast stocks of long-range munitions, given that China's
anti-ship missiles may deter Washington from sending U.S. aircraft
carriers into the fight. Yet despite budgeting funds for an additional
400 extended-range air-to-surface missiles, the Pentagon is still in the
early stages of amassing the capabilities and developing the warfighting
concepts that would allow it to defeat a fait accompli strategy. This
looms as the critical military challenge in the years ahead.

The report also raises more questions than it answers regarding a second
issue: "gray-zone" aggression. In the South China Sea, China has used
coercion short of war --- island-building, paramilitary forces asserting
control over contested areas --- to shift the facts on the ground
incrementally, without triggering a U.S. military response. Over the
past decade, China has thereby strengthened its position on the
installment plan.

The Obama administration always struggled to counter these actions; it
was only episodically successful in deterring China from eating away at
the sovereignty of its neighbors one bite at a time. Here, too, the
Indo-Pacific strategy clearly identifies the problem, yet it offers few
new ideas on how the U.S. and its allies can frustrate the gray-zone
tactics China has used to gain the upper hand in the South China Sea.

Third, the Indo-Pacific strategy unintentionally underscores the
difficulty of deepening America's security relationships amid profound
upheaval in Washington's approach to the world. Most of America's
friends in the Indo-Pacific are pleased that Trump has been willing to
introduce some friction into the relationship with China. But they are
simultaneously alarmed by his waffling on U.S. defense commitments and
penchant for using economic coercion against America's own allies. They
also worry that Trump will ultimately cut a bilateral deal with China,
leaving them exposed. The Pentagon is right that it will take a grand
coalition to keep China in check, but the president's actions are making
that coalition harder to forge.

Fourth, although the report says the right things about the need for a
whole-of-government strategy, in doing so it simply highlights the gaps
in American statecraft. By passing the Build Act, which focuses on
catalyzing private investment in infrastructure projects overseas,
Congress put some \$60 billion toward countering China's economic
influence in the Indo-Pacific. Yet there remains an economic void in
America's strategy toward the region, thanks to Trump's withdrawal from
the Trans-Pacific Partnership back in 2017. If anything, the
administration has weakened America's economic position vis-à-vis China
by pursuing tariff wars against U.S. allies.

[Finally, the Indo-Pacific strategy underlines the awkward matter of
whether that region truly is America's priority theater. Because no
matter what the strategy documents say, the Trump administration just
can't seem to maintain strategic focus. Right now, the U.S. risks being
consumed by a deepening diplomatic and military crisis in the Persian
Gulf, one caused partially --- although far from entirely --- by Trump's
efforts to ratchet up the pressure on Iran. The administration is saying
one thing about its geopolitical priorities, yet it is continually doing
another thing in terms of the fights it picks.]{.underline}

The release of the Indo-Pacific strategy, then, should not be confused
with the achievement of an integrated, effective strategy for
maintaining a "free and open" region. But it does at least illustrate
the main obstacles --- some of them self-created --- that such a
strategy will have to surmount.

#### China will continue to try to obtain capability control over the SCS

Duttonarrow January 04 2019 (Peter Duttonarrow, Peter Dutton is the
director of China Maritime Studies Institute, US Naval War College.
\"China doesn't have the capability for sea control,\" Inkstone,
<https://www.inkstonenews.com/opinion/peter-dutton-china-doesnt-have-capabilities-control-south-china-sea/article/2180187>
)

The premise that China has the capability to control the South China Sea
in all circumstances short of war with the United States is dubious.

[The South China Sea is 1.351 million square miles in size, not
including the Gulf of Thailand. It is about 1.4 times the size of the
Mediterranean. To patrol this vast space, China has 125 coast guard
vessels over 1,000 tons and 84 maritime militia operating out of Sansha
city.]{.underline}

That's 209 vessels, not including the navy. And since we're talking
about circumstances short of war, it seems reasonable to exclude the
Chinese navy in this case: that's one vessel for every 6,464 square
miles. [Even if we say there are a few hundred additional part-time
militia vessels that might have the capacity to meaningfully support
complex sea control operations on a sustained basis, that might make the
total of 500 vessels, reducing the problem to one vessel for every 2,702
square miles. Even with superior air and information control, it's got
to be done on the sea in the end.]{.underline}

[China's gray zone tactics have had a very hard time achieving sea
control even over a very limited space against a determined adversary.
Chinese law enforcement officers pointed out that it is much easier to
attack than to defend. To physically block opponents from obstructing
operations, the Chinese learned they need three or four vessels for
every one of the adversaries.]{.underline}

They learned this from having to defend the operations of the oil rig
Hai Yang Shi You 981, when it operated off the Paracels against
Vietnamese resistance. It is also important to note that Vietnamese
fishermen are still operating around the Paracels. The Chinese have
never been entirely successful at driving them out with non-military
forces since they took the islands in 1974.

While we're on the topic of control in circumstances short of armed
conflict, there is one more consideration I'd like to raise. That is the
deterrent and disruptive role of technology.

Even now, there is something to be said in this regard for the
Vietnamese purchase of Kilo-class submarines. If China did in fact seek
to exert control over the South China Sea, it is reasonable to predict
that Vietnam and others would seek to acquire the sort of technologies
that would make Beijing\'s task even more difficult. No doubt Vietnam
would be aided by outside powers. Japan, India, the United States and
Australia have already been active in this regard.

Now to the second question: [could China achieve sea control through war
with a regional state? Vietnam again is a key potential opponent in this
scenario. They have the most skin in the game, the greatest ability of
any of the claimants to resist, a great history of resisting major
powers, and the determination to do so again if necessary. If China
makes war against Vietnam or another regional state, it might be able to
take and hold the Spratlys]{.underline}, but then what?

[China would be back in the position of having to play a cat-and-mouse
game at sea or to defend the specific points at great cost.
Additionally,]{.underline} considering warmaking against a regional
state, the Chinese must always take into account the potential response
of other states. America might have an interest, for instance, and take
advantage of the opportunity to involve itself in order to weaken
China\'s naval capacity. It is not just the American response: the
Chinese must take into account the responses of other regional states.
Would Japan, Singapore, Malaysia, Indonesia or Australia stand by if
Vietnam is attacked? These states have been willing to acquire largesse
through trade with China, but none wants to be dominated by China.

[China must consider the non-military costs of conflicts with regional
states. China has enough economic challenges. It's attempting to raise
its economy beyond the middle-income trap, and has staked its future on
the Belt and Road initiative. The Chinese have stated that this
initiative relies heavily on economic cooperation of Southeast Asian
states. China's in a very different position than it was in 1962 and
1979 when it last waged wars. It's now much more economically integrated
and therefore much more economically dependent on trade relations with
other countries.]{.underline}

In my view, the best way to conceptualize the value of the American
naval presence in the South China Sea is as a corollary to the American
armed forces stationed in Western Europe during the Cold War. The
physical presence of the American Army divisions in Germany served to
deter Soviet advances. American forces were held at risk to deter war
between the Soviets and Western Europeans, because the Soviets knew war
would involve the Americans.

Similarly, the active, robust presence of the American navy in the South
China Sea serves the same purpose. The concept of any region that is
free from domination must be insured by this balance of forces between
great powers.

[For anyone who might be tempted to think the South China Sea and
Southeast Asia are not strategically important to the United States,
perhaps a few more statistics will convince you otherwise. US trade with
the South China Sea littoral states in 2017 was \$246.9 billion. That's
more than the US bilateral trade with Japan, or Korea, or Taiwan, or
Hong Kong. American bilateral trade with China was \$635 billion in
2017, but the government has already demonstrated its willingness to
sacrifice trade with China in the interest of achieving its strategic
goals.]{.underline}

If China believes it can or should attempt to control the South China
Sea through conflict with a regional state, it must take into account
the very salient fact across American history that free access to trade
has been deemed a vital interest, worth protecting by force if
necessary.

#### Increase arms sales to China won't translate closer relations

reporter on the China desk. She previously worked with Reuters in

)

[A Chinese state-owned shipbuilder is promoting its warships in
Southeast Asia as part of Beijing's increased efforts to expand arms
sales in the region.]{.underline}

As China Shipbuilding Industry Corp (CSIC) launched a second littoral
mission ship -- a large patrol vessel -- for the Royal Malaysian Navy at
its shipyard in central China last week, the company's deputy general
manager Wu Xiaoguang went on a week-long tour.

Wu visited the Philippines and Indonesia, meeting defence officials from
the two countries, the company said in a statement titled, "Put
\[China's\] 'going out' strategy into practice and make great efforts to
expand arms sales".

According to the statement, Wu expressed an interest in cooperating with
the Philippine navy when he met Jesus Avilla, the country's assistant
defence secretary.

In Indonesia, Wu discussed deepening the relationship with the defence
ministry and navy during a meeting with a special envoy of the defence
minister.

[It came as CSIC launched the Sundang, the second of four Keris-class
littoral mission ships being built by the company's Wuchang shipyard in
Wuhan, Hubei province for the Royal Malaysian Navy. The Sundang is
expected to be delivered next year.]{.underline}

CSIC is China's main warship manufacturer, responsible for retrofitting
the unfinished Soviet vessel that became the Liaoning \[1\], the
country's first aircraft carrier.

[CSIC is also building the nation's first home-grown aircraft carrier,
as well as nuclear-powered submarines. It will merge with another
state-owned giant, China State Shipbuilding Corp, to form the world's
largest shipbuilder.]{.underline}

The littoral mission ship deal, signed in 2017 at a cost of 1.05 billion
ringgit (US\$254 million), has underscored China's rising status as a
key player in the arms market in Southeast Asia. Apart from traditional
buyer Myanmar, which bought US\$1.3 billion worth of weapons from China
from 2010 to 2018, Thailand has in recent years significantly increased
its purchases of Chinese arms -- from US\$2 million in 2011 to US\$131
million in 2017, according to the Stockholm International Peace Research
Institute.

Indonesia has also spent tens of millions of dollars on Chinese weapons
annually since 2012.

[Chinese military supplies to Thailand include powerful VT-4 tanks, VN-1
armoured vehicles and an S-26T submarine. Myanmar, meanwhile, has
purchased JF-17M fighter jets, 053H frigates, and air-defence missiles.
China has also sold missiles, radars and a close-in weapons system for
Indonesia's warships.]{.underline}

\[2\]

[Beijing is also actively courting the Philippines, a traditional ally
of the United States, by donating guns and ammunition, as well as patrol
boats, to support President Rodrigo Duterte's "war on
terror".]{.underline}

In addition to the arms sales, the People's Liberation Army has also
strengthened ties with the militaries of the buyer countries. In
October, China held a trilateral naval exercise with Thailand and
Malaysia, and took part in its first joint exercise with Asean.

That was also the Association of Southeast Asian Nations' first such
drill with an individual country and was followed by another exercise
between Asean and the PLA Navy in April.

[But increased arms sales may not automatically translate into closer
relationships with client countries, especially the Philippines, since
some are in maritime or territorial disputes with China, according to
Zhang Mingliang, who specialises in Southeast Asian studies at Jinan
University in Guangzhou.]{.underline}

"Buying arms from China can be a measure to diversify their source of
weapons and lower the defence cost, but that won't reduce the existing
negative factors in the relationships," he said.

[NFU is not a static proposition. It is more than a doctrine: it is also
a strategy to curb and constrain the nuclear sector and pave the way for
nuclear disarmament. For if the role of nuclear weapons were confined to
that of deterring others from using theirs, the prognosis for nuclear
weapons research, development, maintenance and production - currently
thriving on extended deterrence - would be bleaker. This is what the
proponents would like to achieve, and this is what the material
interests in nuclear weaponry oppose. NFU confronts the nuclear industry
in the widest sense of the term. Therefore, the opposition to it is not
limited to considerations of national security and political weight in

Assurance and Nonproliferation Risks Building and maintaining strong
alliances has been a centerpiece of America's effort to produce and
sustain a more peaceful world. Critical to this is assuring U.S. allies
of America's commitment to their defense by extending to them the full
range of U.S. military power[. Many countries, including those that
share a border with an adversary that presents a threat to their very
existence, see no-first-use as a weakening, symbolic or otherwise, of
U.S. extended deterrence.]{.underline} In response to Chinese
provocations in the western Pacific and North Korea's nuclear tests and
missile launches, [[Japan regularly seeks, both in official
consultations and ongoing military cooperation, assurances that America
will continue to fulfill]{.mark} its security commitments to protect the
island nation]{.underline}. Some in South Korea have already pressed to
explore an [increased U.S. nuclear presence in their country to further
deter regional threats[. Loss of confidence]{.mark}]{.underline} [[in
U.S. security commitments could cause some allies to seek accommodation
with regional adversaries in ways that run counter to U.S.
interests]{.underline}]{.mark}. Moreover, both South Korea and Japan,
similar to many NATO allies, have latent nuclear weapons capabilities
characteristic of advanced industrial economies with commercial nuclear
power. Any perceived wavering of U.S. security commitments could cause
allies to develop and field their own nuclear weapons. Further,
America's allies have made their feelings about America adopting a
no-first-use policy known. U.S. officials consulted America's allies
extensively in the lead up to the 2010 and 2018 nuclear posture reviews.
This dialogue has been rich and productive and, in some ways, surprising
in its candor. For example, in 2009, Japanese officials briefed the
Perry-Schlesinger Commission, established by Congress to seek a
bipartisan approach to the U.S. nuclear posture, on specific features
and capabilities of the U.S. nuclear deterrent that Japan viewed as
critical to its security. In related dialogue, many foreign counterparts
to U.S. officials, including those of Japan, have urged the United
States not to adopt a no-first-use policy.

### 2ac at: First Strike -- escalation turn

#### US first strike guarantees China and Russia escalation

Mehl march 10, 2016 (Annie Mehl, Detail-oriented Journalist with a
Bachelor's of Science in Journalism, investigate articles about nuclear
weapons, artificial intelligence and climate change, "The Increasing
Risk of Nuclear War",
<https://futureoflife.org/2016/03/10/the-increasing-risk-of-nuclear-war/?cn-reloaded=1>
)

On Saturday, February 27, thousands of activists marched through London
in opposition to the country's nuclear weapons policy. Meanwhile, in the
United States, Russia, and now China, nuclear tensions may be
escalating.

"It takes about 30 minutes for a missile to fly between the United
States and Russia," a recent report by the Union of Concerned Scientists
(UCS) reminded readers. The U.S. and Russia keep their missiles on
hair-trigger alerts which allow them to be launched within minutes, and
both countries have been investing in upgrading their nuclear arsenals.

Another recent UCS report, China's Military Calls for Putting Its
Nuclear Forces on Alert, analyzes the risk that China's military leaders
may also soon call for putting their own nuclear weapons on high-alert.
Gregory Kulacki, author of the China report, argues that this could be
incredibly dangerous. He explains:

"The experience with U.S. and Soviet/Russian warning systems, especially
early in their deployment and operation when hardware and procedures
were not yet reliable, illustrates the dangers of maintaining the option
to launch on warning. Such risks are especially acute in a crisis."

[In fact, [there have been over two dozen known nuclear close calls
involving the U.S. and Russia]{.mark}, and likely many more that haven't
been declassified. One of the [scariest example]{.mark}s occurred in
1980, [during a time of tension between Russia and the U.S. A Soviet
satellite showed five land-based missiles heading straight for the
Soviet Union]{.mark}, and Stanislav Petrov, the officer on duty, had
only a few minutes to decide whether or not it was a false alarm.
Fortunately, he disregarded all evidence to the contrary and concluded
[it was false.]{.mark} [Investigations later found that the sun's
reflection off the clouds had tricked the satellite into detecting a
missile launch.]{.mark}]{.underline} Hair-trigger alert policies [[only
increase the chances that accidents like this could occur, inadvertently
triggering a nuclear war]{.mark}.]{.underline}

These policies were originally put in place as an act of deterrence.
However, as information about more of these close calls has been
released, many are concerned about the Cold-War policies that are still
in effect.

As David Wright with the UCS says[, "Twenty-five years after the end of
the Cold War, [the United Sates and Russia continue to keep nearly 2,000
nuclear weapons constantly on high alert, ready to be launched in
minutes."]{.mark}]{.underline}

Given the concerns associated with the hair-trigger alert [[policies of
the U.S. and Russia, it's no surprise that adding a third country to the
mix would only exacerbate the situation.]{.underline}]{.mark}

More surprising might be why China's military leaders are reconsidering
their policy. According to Kulacki,

"The nuclear weapons policies of the United States are the most
prominent external factors influencing Chinese advocates for raising the
alert level of China's nuclear forces."

[[The risks that could potentially arise if China changes its
policy]{.mark} are hard to measure, but with the close calls already
seen between the U.S. and Soviet Russia, [a third country with similar
policies would only further increase]{.mark} the risk of a devastating,
[accidental nuclear exchange.]{.mark}]{.underline}

When they originally began their nuclear program, Chinese leaders
committed to a no-first-use policy, and they've stuck to that, keeping
their nuclear warheads separate from their missiles. Only if they're
attacked first, will the Chinese assemble their nuclear weapons and
strike back. However, the Chinese are becoming increasingly concerned
with what they perceive the U.S. nuclear stance against them to be.
Kulacki explains:

"The authors of the 2013 Academy of Military Sciences' textbook The
Science of Military Strategy clearly believe U.S. actions are calling
into question the credibility of China's ability to retaliate after a
U.S. nuclear attack, and that an effective way to respond would be to
raise the alert level of China's nuclear forces so they can be launched
on warning of an incoming nuclear attack."

[[With the recent developments of U.S. high-precision conventional and
nuclear weapons, along with the Chinese belief that the U.S. is
unwilling to recognize joint vulnerability,]{.mark} China's leaders may
decide to change their own policies to match those of the U.S. In the
China report, [Kulacki recommends]{.mark} five steps for the [United
States to take to improve their relationship with
China:]{.mark}]{.underline}

"[Acknowledge mutual vulnerability with China."]{.underline}

["Reject rapid-launch options."]{.underline}

["Adopt a 'sole purpose' nuclear doctrine."]{.underline}

[["Limit ballistic missile defenses."]{.underline}]{.mark}

["Discuss impacts of new conventional capabilities."]{.underline}

["U.S. officials have to realize that China is contemplating these
changes because it believes the United States is unwilling to reduce the
role of nuclear weapons in its national security
strategy]{.underline}--- what President Obama promised to do in his
famous speech in Prague in 2009," Kulacki added. "What the U.S. says and
does regarding nuclear weapons has a profound effect on Chinese
thinking[. And right now, we're pushing China in the wrong
direction."]{.underline}

### 1ar at: First Strike ext -- escalation turn

#### Nuclear posturing guarantees escalation in the event of a first strike.

NTI, February 1, 2018(NTI, \"U.S. Nuclear Policy and Posture: Increasing
Warning and Decision Time,\" No Publication,
<https://www.nti.org/analysis/articles/us-nuclear-policy-and-posture-increasing-warning-and-decision-time/>
)

True progress on reducing nuclear risks---and true cooperation necessary
to prevent proliferation and nuclear terrorism---is not possible when
both Washington and Moscow are postured for mutually assured destruction
on a massive scale[. [If leaders cannot see]{.underline}]{.mark} [and
act on this premise[, the United States and Russia will remain trapped
in a costly and risky nuclear posture]{.mark}---and other nations may
follow in their footsteps, making probable that Hiroshima and Nagasaki
are not the last cities to suffer a nuclear attack.]{.underline}

[[Today, U.S. and Russian ballistic missiles armed with nuclear warheads
deployed on prompt-launch]{.mark} can be fired and hit their targets
within minutes[. Once fired, a nuclear ballistic missile unfortunately
cannot be recalled]{.mark}]{.underline} before it reaches its target[[.
Leaders]{.mark} may [have only minutes between warning of an attack and
nuclear detonations]{.mark} on their territory planned to eliminate
their capacity [to respond]{.mark}. This puts enormous pressure on
leaders to maintain "launch on warning/launch under attack" options,
which---[when mutual tensions persist or in a crisis---increases the
risk that a decision to use nuclear weapons will be made in haste after
a false warning and multiplies the risk of an accidental, mistaken, or
unauthorized launch---]{.mark}blundering into nuclear
catastrophe.]{.underline}

[[Magnifying risks of a nuclear mistake are cyber threats]{.mark} to
warning and command and control systems]{.underline}. Issues surrounding
decision time become more acute in a world of increased cyber risks and
little communication or cooperation between political and military
leaders. Malicious hackers today may insert the same message that
panicked Hawaiians in January 2018---"Ballistic missile threat inbound
... seek immediate shelter. This is not a drill"---into national warning
and alert systems. How would the leaders of Pakistan, India, North
Korea, the United States, Russia, China, Britain, France, or Israel
respond?

Washington should work with Moscow to [eliminate Cold War-era
capabilities and force postures that generate fears of a disarming
first-strike. Working with Russia to take nuclear missiles off prompt
launch status would increase time for leaders to assess their options
and make a more considered decision in response to a suspected or actual
nuclear attack. This would significantly reduce the risk of an
accidental, mistaken, or unauthorized launch of a nuclear ballistic
missile, and set an example for all states with nuclear weapons.
Ideally, this could be extended to China, and then to India and
Pakistan.]{.underline}

This initiative would be widely understood by publics as a step away
from the still-prevailing concept of mutually assured destruction, and
could serve as a building block in a broader effort to improve relations
between the West and Russia. Importantly, disengaging the Cold War
autopilot would in no way diminish the U.S.' military capability to
deter and defend against any nation or combination of nations; even with
these steps, the United States will continue to have sufficient if not
excessive capacity in its nuclear arsenal.

### 2ac at: LRDR -- Block IIA deficit

**The US and Japan codeveloped the Block IIA -- they both have export
rights**

**Herman 16** (Arthur, Senior Fellow at the Hudson Institute, "The
Awakening Giant: Risks and Opportunities for Japan\'s New Defense Export
Policy," *Hudson Institute*, December 19, 2016,
https://www.hudson.org/research/13145-the-awakening-giant-risks-and-opportunities-for-japan-s-new-defense-export-policy)///JP

In 2008, [Japan began codevelopment of the SM-3 Block IIA with the
United States.]{.underline} The twenty-one-foot SM-3 missile, designated
RIM-161A in the United States, is a major part of the US Navy's Aegis
BMD system and is a complement to the shorter-range Patriot missile. The
intercept velocity of the latest SM-3 is around 6,000 mph, with a
ceiling of 100 miles and a range of 270 nautical miles.

The missile's kinetic warhead is a Lightweight Exo-Atmospheric
Projectile, a non-explosive hit-to-kill device. According to
non-classified sources, [Japan is overseeing development of the nose
cone, which protects an infrared ray sensor from heat generated by air
friction, as well as the second- and third-stage rocket motors and the
staging assembly and steering control section for the
missile]{.underline}.[51](https://www.hudson.org/research/13145-the-awakening-giant-risks-and-opportunities-for-japan-s-new-defense-export-policy#footNote51)
As for the rest of the missile, the booster is the United Technologies
MK 72 solid-fuel rocket, and the sustainer is the Atlantic Research
Corp. MK 104 dual-thrust solid-fuel rocket. The third stage is the
Alliant Techsystems MK 136 solid-fuel rocket.

[Cooperation on the Block IIA proceeded smoothly, but when the United
States was set to export it to other countries, including Qatar, Japan's
Foreign Ministry noted that this would be a technical violation of the
long-standing ban on defense exports. After considerable discussion and
considerable prompting from the US Department of Defense, then-prime
minister Yoshihiko Noda decided to make an exception for weapons systems
produced as part of bilateral defense agreements.]{.underline} Indeed,
it was this decision that opened the door to other bilateral defense
agreements and to the Abe government's revising the entire export
policy, leading ultimately to the three principles promulgated in
2014.[52](https://www.hudson.org/research/13145-the-awakening-giant-risks-and-opportunities-for-japan-s-new-defense-export-policy#footNote52)

The reasons why the SM-3 Block IIA has been a relative success for
Japan's new export policy compared to submarines and seaplanes---indeed,
has heralded the new export policy itself---are many.

First, [instead of trying to export an entire Japanese-made system,
Japan conducted this venture in complete cooperation with the US
government and US defense companies]{.underline}, which not only served
as technical partners, but because they were more experienced in the
vicissitudes of the international defense trade, were able to arrange
for sale to Qatar.

Second, [Japan was working in cooperation with the United States in
ballistic missile defense, an area in which it faces few clear
competitors, and indeed, an area in which the opportunities for more
cooperation and codevelopment are relatively expansive.]{.underline}
These include, for example, airborne boost-phase intercept ballistic
missile defense. The United States already had a laser airborne system,
which it is currently working to upgrade using unmanned platforms.
However, there is currently a proposal involving two Japanese companies
and a US technology firm for developing an unmanned boost phase
interceptor using a conventional anti-missile missile. This could target
and destroy missiles fired from North Korea while they are still in
their boost phase, whereas land-based systems such as THAAD (Terminal
High Altitude Area Defense) and Aegis Ashore do so only in the terminal
phase.

If Japan moved ahead with this boost-phase interceptor, or BPI project,
it would actually enjoy an advantage over the Pentagon and its usual US
defense contractors. This is because development and deployment of BPI
will be relatively inexpensive (less than \$10 million by recent
estimates), and if existing technologies are used, relatively near term.
Indeed, it could become an export package system that other countries
threatened by rogue nations' ballistic missiles will want to purchase,
and thus lead to a made-in-Japan ballistic missile defense
system.[53](https://www.hudson.org/research/13145-the-awakening-giant-risks-and-opportunities-for-japan-s-new-defense-export-policy#footNote53)

Third, [the SM-3 joint development project was underpinned by very clear
formal agreements between the two countries. The first was in August
1999, when the Japanese government agreed to conduct cooperative
research on four components of the interceptor missile being developed
for the US Navy Theater-Wide]{.underline} (NTW) [anti-missile
system]{.underline}, for use against short- and medium-range missiles up
to 3,500
kilometers.[54](https://www.hudson.org/research/13145-the-awakening-giant-risks-and-opportunities-for-japan-s-new-defense-export-policy#footNote54)
[In 2007 came the signing of the General Security of Military
Information Agreement, or GSOMIA, between Japan and the United
States,]{.underline} [followed]{.underline} (after considerable delay)
[by a formal Reciprocal Defense Procurement Memorandum of Understanding,
or RDPMOU, in 2016]{.underline}. The United States has similar RDPMOUs
with twenty-two other nations, but this was the first such agreement
signed with Japan, and it points the way to further defense industrial
cooperation down the road.

Fourth, [the SM-3 project was undergirded by an American desire to
encourage Japan's more proactive defense and defense-trade posture to
benefit the United States as well as Japan.]{.underline} Then-secretary
of defense Robert Gates was a prime mover in getting the joint
development of SM-3 underway and promoting its [export sales as an
important adjunct to US-Japanese strategic cooperation at the broadest
level.]{.underline}

research into Aegis Ashore---which combines the Lockheed Martin SPY-1D

Currently, [Japan uses a combination of four Kongo-class Aegis-equipped
guided missile destroyers armed with SM-3s for longer-range ballistic
missile threats]{.underline} and Lockheed Martin Patriot Advanced
Capability-3 (PAC-3) mobile ground based interceptors for missiles
closer to their targets.

"There are concerns that PAC3s could not respond if a massive number of
ballistic missiles were to be simultaneously launched toward Japan,"
read the Mainichi report.

Japan intends to double the amount of BMD destroyers to eight by 2018,
according to local press reports.

[The Kongos ships use a legacy Aegis BMD configuration that do not allow
the Aegis combat system to operate as BMD defense platforms and as
anti-air warfare ships simultaneously.]{.underline}

Japan is also exploring upgrading at least some of its ships to a more
advanced Baseline 9 configuration that would allow the ships to
simultaneously act as a BMD and AAW platform.

[Aegis Ashore operates with a version of Baseline 9 that doesn't include
an AAW component, but given the similarities of the ground based system
and the Aegis combat system onboard U.S. and **Japanese ships, those
capabilities could expand.**]{.underline}

"[This is the Aegis weapon from a ship. It can do AAW, terminal defense
and mid-course intercept]{.underline}," Navy Capt. Jeff Weston, the

[At the time, Weston said an U.S. Aegis Ashore battery would only
concentrate on BMD]{.underline}. "We're not going to do anti-air warfare
in someone else's country," he said.

However, [a Japanese run installation could expand the missile offerings
beyond the BMD optimized SM-3s.]{.underline}

[Depending on the configuration of the Aegis Ashore installation, the
site could conceivably be expanded to include other AAW

### 2ac at: Japan Says No: Turn

#### Japan saying no to BMD undermines the U.S.-Japan alliance-- risks a security crisis.

**Van 14** (Shanelle Van Sanford School of Public Policy -- Duke
University, "Ballistic Missile Defense in Japan: Process-Tracing a
Historical Trajectory" Undergraduate Honors Thesis, December 2014,
[https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/37750459.pdf -
BIB)](https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/37750459.pdf))

As one of only two countries (the other being the United States) with
both the lower- and upper-level capabilities for intercepting incoming
missiles, Japan now has one of the most sophisticated missile defense
systems in the entire world. Conventional wisdom and the existing
literature consider this success along a historical trajectory that
started the day of the 1998 North Korean Taepodong launch. But the
narrative shows that the [[achievement of missile]{.mark} [defense
capability in Japan was in fact the result of an uphill struggle begun
in the late 1980s]{.mark}]{.underline}. Though the Taepodong incident
was indeed important, numerous other factors -- including [[alliance
pressures]{.mark},]{.underline} bureaucrats, and the defense industry
among them -- also [[played a role in Japan's decision to deploy
BMD]{.underline}]{.mark}. [Incorrectly folding Japan's commitment to BMD
in with "Taepodong shock" threatens to rewrite the actual history of the
US-Japan alliance. This]{.underline}, in turn, [generates unrealistic
expectations of what Japan can and will do militarily]{.underline}
together [with the United States[. The disconnect between Japan and the
US has already taken its toll on the alliance]{.mark}. [Relations
between the partners]{.mark} in recent years [have been described as
"anything but warm]{.mark}]{.underline}" 118-- in part, as this thesis
shows, [because [Japan's tendency to move at a frigid pace on security
issues like missile defense has led to doubt on the US side about
whether Japan will]{.mark} ever reach a satisfying point in
[hold]{.mark}ing [its own within the alliance]{.mark}. If there is one
commonality amongst those who negotiated with the Japanese on missile
defense]{.underline} in the 1990s, [it is their frustration with the
[sluggishness and the lack of coherence that characterized the Japanese
side]{.mark}. Negotiations such as these [color the United States'
perception of its alliance with Japan]{.mark}]{.underline}[.]{.mark}
Whereas every Japanese delegation was welcomed with open arms in the
20th century, [it has become increasingly difficult to convince
Washington]{.underline} of [why Japan is very important]{.underline}.
Its story has "diminished," and expectations that Japan will step up
have dwindled.119 [N[either Japan nor the United States can afford to
hold such doubts about the alliance these days]{.mark}.]{.underline}
[[Relations in East Asia have deteriorated in recent years,]{.mark} with
a number of issues -- the rise of China, territorial disputes in the
South and East China Seas, the conflict between India and Pakistan, and
North Korea's irrational behavior -- cropping up. [Japan will need the
assurance of the United States' nuclear umbrella]{.mark}. As [the
U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates transitions towards a greater emphasis on
East Asia, it will need Japan to be]{.underline} -- as former Japanese
Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone put it in the 1980s -- [its "unsinkable
aircraft carrier" in the Pacific. It [will need Japan to take on a
leadership role]{.mark}]{.underline} in East Asia. The United States can
only do this if it enters the bargain with a full understanding of how
far Japan will go. Such an understanding only comes with knowing the
history of the US-Japan alliance. Taken as a whole, the historical
narrative holds significant lessons for what the United States can
reasonably ask of Japan within the alliance. Although the Taepodong
launch was a significant event in this history, [[even a missile flying
over the islands was not reason enough for Japan to pursue BMD. What
Japan needed was]{.underline}]{.mark} not only [downward [pressure from
the United States]{.mark}]{.underline}, but [[also reassurance from its
longest-standing ally that it was truly committed to the security of
Japan]{.underline}]{.mark}. It had to first agree with the security
assessment that there were neighboring countries to worry about, and to
then find ways around its legal complications. The US' strongest allies
in this were the bureaucrats and the defense industry, who were able to
demonstrate to the rest that, because missile defense was
technologically feasible, it was worth the cost of investment. In order
to convince its ally to join in its initiatives, the United States must
do more than simply expect of Japan when it has little more than words
and unformed ideas to offer. The results here also tie into a deeper
body of theoretical literature that could drive further research into
Japan's security strategy. As previously noted, work on defensive and
offensive dominance led to the correct intuition that Japan needed to
clarify its legal restrictions before pursuing missile defense. So what
led to these reinterpretations? And where does Japan draw the line
between offensive and defensive weaponry? These are but two of the many
questions about Japan that still need examination, and they become more
important with every passing year. US policymakers must continue to ask
questions that go to the heart of how and why Japan makes national
security decisions. Otherwise, they risk jeopardizing an alliance that
has served as the cornerstone of security in East Asia for over 50
years.

Aegis Ashore is the land-based ballistic-missile defense version of the
Aegis Combat System; it is currently fielded in Romania and will soon be
deployed in Poland.

According to Lockheed Martin documents, the U.S. Department of
Defense\'s newest ballistic missile defense sensor, LRDR, will use
thousands of Lockheed Martin Solid State Radar (SSR) gallium nitride
(GaN)-based radar building blocks to provide enhanced target
acquisition, tracking, and discrimination data to the U.S. Ballistic
Missile Defense System.

Lockheed Martin officials say that co[nnecting the two mature systems
effectively results in a low-risk \"technology refresh\" of the legacy
SPY-1 antenna, resulting in such benefits as the ability to detect
targets at longer distances, the ability to combat larger numbers of
targets simultaneously, enhanced target engagement opportunities,
higher-quality performance in complicated land environments, and owered
possibility of interference with civilian or military radio emitters and
receivers.]{.underline}

\"[Connecting these systems is more than a technological advantage \--

Stratfor,

Speaking at a press conference in Madrid on Tuesday, Russian President
Dmitri Medvedev said that [it was "not productive" to link talks over a
U.S. ballistic missile defense (BMD) system in Europe with the perceived
security threat from Iran, as proposed by Washington]{.underline}. The
topic came up as Medvedev spoke alongside Spanish Prime Minister Jose
Luis Rodriguez Zapatero at a press conference about a number of
unrelated topics. The question he was responding to seemed to come out
of left field, suggesting that the Kremlin planted the question, and
perhaps the journalist. The question concerned a secret letter exchange
between U.S. President Barack Obama and Medvedev --- an exchange that
was made public on Tuesday after a leak to The New York Times. [For the
Russians, [a quid pro quo on BMD]{.mark} and Iran [is]{.mark} simply
[unacceptable]{.mark}.]{.underline} It isn't because the Russians have
heightened sensibilities --- they are the masters of linking otherwise
unrelated topics together for discussion and action --- but because
[[they are thinking much bigger]{.mark} these days. They want a grand
bargain with the Americans]{.underline}, and they want it now. Ever
since it became clear in late 2003 that the war in Iraq would serve as
more of a sandbag than a springboard for U.S. policy, the Russians have
enjoyed the light streaming through a window of opportunity. Pretty much
all U.S. ground forces are spoken for by the wars in Iraq and
Afghanistan. Even if both wars were declared over today, it would be
more than two years before all forces could be withdrawn, rested and
re-equipped for future deployments. U.S. expeditionary capability is
currently limited to the Air Force and naval aviation -- tools that are
hardly small fry, especially when you are on the receiving end, but
which are not particularly useful for blocking Russian moves in states
that were part of the Soviet Union, like Ukraine or Georgia. Blocking
such actions can be done only with ground forces, and those forces
simply are not available right now. Thus, f[rom the Russian perspective,
the time to negotiate with the Americans about the broad spectrum of
relations is now. [They do not want a short list of quid pro quo
arrangements]{.mark} that will let the Americans push off the bigger
issues until another day. [They want everything]{.mark} --- and they
mean everything --- [settled now]{.mark}, when their power is at a
relative high]{.underline} compared to that of the United States. [The
Russians do not want a simple rejiggering of existing disarmament
treaties; they want fundamentally new ones that extend the current
nuclear parity with the United States]{.underline}, codifying it to the
finest detail possible. [They want to shoot down the plans for
BMD]{.underline}, a technology that one day could render the Russian
nuclear deterrent obsolete[. [They want the United States to publicly
recognize Russian dominance]{.mark} throughout the former Soviet Union,
and]{.underline} --- again, publicly --- [[put an end to Western

Part of the ability to get such a grand bargain at such a fortuitous
time, of course, rests in the ability to convince the other side that
your own tools are even more robust than they may seem. You must
convince the other side your rise to power is inevitable. It comes to
shaping perceptions, and in this the Russians are peerless. Remember
Cold War propaganda? It was certainly on parade in Spain, not just in
the shaping of a press conference where the quid pro quo comments
garnered such attention, but in a phalanx of "deals" that the Russian
delegation signed.

#### Russia doesn't trust the US to negotiate on arms control -- INF proves

Russia, "Following U.S., Putin suspends nuclear pact and promises new
weapons," *The Washington* Post, 2/2/19,
<https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/following-us-putin-suspends-nuclear-pact-and-promises-new-weapons/2019/02/02/8160c78e-26e3-11e9-ad53-824486280311_story.html?utm_term=.d8e9f180f0db>)

[[Putin]{.underline}]{.mark} ordered his military to start developing
land-based missiles that could deliver nuclear warheads in the range
prohibited by the treaty, including a hypersonic version. He also
[[directed]{.mark} his [diplomats]{.mark} [to]{.mark} [stop]{.mark}
initiating any [arms control talks]{.mark} with the West, claiming
Washington hadn't negotiated in good faith.]{.underline}

Putin's move came a day after the Trump administration announced it was
pulling out of the agreement and underscored analysts' fears that a
budding arms race between Russia and the United States is about to
intensify.

"[Our answer will be symmetrical]{.underline}," Putin said in a
televised meeting with his defense and foreign ministers. "Our American
partners declared that they will suspend their participation in the
treaty, so we will suspend ours as well. They said they would start
research and development, and we will do the same."

The United States and its allies have said for years that Russia is
violating the 1987 pact between Washington and Moscow, the
Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty, by developing and fielding a
banned missile. Russia denies the allegation.

Critics of U.S. withdrawal from the treaty say that, despite Russia's
violation, the best way to keep Russian arms in check would be to
negotiate while keeping the treaty intact. Trump administration
officials say the treaty threatens U.S. national security by preventing
the country from responding to missile threats, not just from Russia but
also from China, which isn't a signatory to the INF Treaty.

Putin's directive on Saturday to start new development referred to
missiles that would be different from the prohibited one the United
States accuses Russia of already having deployed. He approved a request
from Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu to create a land-based version of
existing sea-launched missiles and to start developing a new, hypersonic
medium-range ballistic missile.

Both of those missiles would be capable of a range between 500 and 5,500
kilometers, or 311 and 3,418 miles, which is banned by the INF Treaty.
The pact, signed near the close of the Cold War by President Ronald
Reagan and Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev, eliminated more than 2,600
missiles and ended a years-long standoff with nuclear missiles in
Europe.

Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said on Friday that, effective Saturday,
the United States will suspend participation in the agreement, starting
a six-month countdown to a final U.S. withdrawal. [[Pompeo said Russia
could salvage]{.mark} the treaty by ending its banned missile programs,
but [Putin's remarks Saturday underscored the very low likelihood Russia
will make such a move]{.mark}.]{.underline}

In the televised meeting, the Russian president directed officials to
stop initiating any talks related to arms control. Putin had previously
been eager to negotiate with the United States on the matter --- in part
because, analysts say, discussion of nuclear arsenals is one of the only
issues on which Moscow can engage on near-equal diplomatic footing with
Washington.

"I'm asking both ministries to no longer initiate any negotiations on
this issue," Putin said, referring to his foreign and defense
ministries. "[Let's wait until our partners are ready to hold an equal,
meaningful dialogue]{.underline} on this extremely important topic."

3/7/18,
<https://www.brookings.edu/blog/order-from-chaos/2018/03/07/missiles-of-march-a-political-means-of-last-resort-for-putin/>)

Putin's emotional comment in his speech that "nobody wanted to listen to
us...so listen now" contains yet another part of the answer, though it
doesn't mean that Russia is ready to talk. [[Moscow has shown no
inclination to resume meaningful negotiations on strategic arms
control]{.underline}]{.mark}, and Deputy Foreign Minister Sergei
[Ryabkov cancelled scheduled consultations on strategic
stability]{.underline} with U.S. Under Secretary of State Thomas Shannon
this week. Foreign Minister Sergei [Lavrov's]{.underline} remarks at the
recent Conference on Disarmament in Geneva [amounted to accusing the
United States of preparing for a nuclear war in Europe]{.underline}. And
Putin's address did nothing to dispel persistent U.S. accusations that
Russia is in violation of the 1988 Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces
(INF) Treaty.

[It is not that [Putin]{.mark} strives to start negotiations, but rather
that he [wants to arrest the decline of Russia's relevance]{.mark} on
the international arena.]{.underline} First of all, [he needs to
reinforce the delusion of "greatness" in the eyes of his domestic
audience, and his speech's emphasis on missiles indeed induced a
standing ovation.]{.underline} Another important addressee, quite
possibly, was China, which is inclined to take the "strategic
partnership" with Russia for granted and was mentioned only once in
Putin's speech. Sustained joint efforts by the United States and China
in managing the North Korean crisis (which Putin didn't find opportune
to mention at all) upsets Moscow, which cannot contribute meaningfully
to this counter-proliferation work but resents the neglect.

[[Russia's economic weakness is so profound that Russia cannot possibly
engage in anything resembling a real arms race with the United States
and NATO]{.underline}]{.mark}. [Putin's enthusiastic rollout of Russia's
missile program scored many good points domestically]{.underline} but
produced a mixed impression among his key international audiences. It
doesn't take a shrewd strategic mind to conclude that Russia can only
proceed with these entirely unnecessary weapon programs at the expense
of addressing its more pressing economic needs and acute security
challenges, including Syria. Putin's posturing cannot meet many strict
reality checks, but it is nevertheless, dangerous because it damages the
norm of owning nuclear weapons responsibly.

#### Putin won't negotiate -- BMDs distract from domestic issues 

**Lilly '15** (Bilyana Lilly is author of the book, Russian Foreign
Policy toward Missile Defense: Actors, Motivations, and Influence, "How
Putin uses missile defence in Europe to distract Russian voters," NATO
Review Magazine, 2015,
https://www.nato.int/docu/review/2015/Russia/Ballistic-Missile-Defence-Putin/EN/index.htm)

[[Moscow's confrontational position on missile defence has proven
politically expedient]{.mark} for a Russian government that has built
its legitimacy on the necessity to defend Russia from external enemies.
Now, when Russia is entering a full-fledged economic crisis that could
affect the political allegiances of the Russian population, the Kremlin
needs to revive the issue of BMD]{.underline} -- a welcome enemy that
contributes to the justification for government survival.

[The Kremlin has been formally opposing the deployment of BMD on the
basis that it would pose a threat to Russia's nuclear deterrent and
Russian security. Moscow has been using this strategy to prove Russia is
a besieged nation surrounded by hostile power]{.underline}s. Putin used
the example of missile defence in his February 2007 speech at the G8
Security Conference in Munich, while Medvedev referred to missile
defence as a justification for military upgrades in 2011.

However, [[Russia's security-based objections to the construction of
b]{.mark}allistic [m]{.mark}issile [d]{.mark}efence]{.underline} in
Europe [[appear]{.mark} [unjustified]{.mark}]{.underline} given the
array of countermeasures that Russia could employ to overcome NATO's
BMD. As of September 1, 2014, following its obligations under the New
Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty (START), Russia reported to be in
possession of a total of 1,643 warheads and 528 deployed
intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBMs), submarine-launched
ballistic missile (SLBMs) and heavy bombers. Additionally, Russia
possesses tactical missiles, decoys and chaff, and multiple
independently targetable re-entry vehicles.

These are among the many countermeasures that Russia can use to negate
the effect of missile defence. Given Russia's offensive capabilities,
Russia's argument that missile defence in Europe poses a security threat
to Moscow appears exaggerated. Then, why does the Russian leadership
keep bringing it up?

The Political Usefulness of Ballistic Missile Defence

[Russia's objections seem more logical when examining the domestic
utility of hostile rhetoric towards missile defence in
Europe]{.underline}. Describing NATO's missile defence as a threat to
Russia feeds into the currently-promoted narrative. This paints the West
as an aggressive force which aims to change Russia's regime and negate
its nuclear deterrent, which Moscow regards as the ultimate guarantee of
its sovereignty. The justification that Russia has to protect itself
from the external threat strengthens the need to maintain a strong,
centralised government, endure economic woes, and continue to invest in
military modernisation.

In his December 4 annual address, Putin used this logic by pointing to
missile defence to justify the need to maintain and likely strengthen
Russia's defence. He insisted that Russia's policy is reactive, forced
by external factors: "We have no intention of becoming involved in a
costly arms race - but at the same time we will reliably and dependably
guarantee our country's defence under the new conditions. There are
absolutely no doubts about this. This will be done."

The strategy to portray BMD as a threat to the Russian population seems
effective. A survey conducted by the Russian polling organisation Levada
centre in 2007 and again in 2010 revealed that the majority of the
Russian constituency believed that the US construction of BMD in Europe
presents a larger threat to Russia than the acquisition of offensive
military capabilities by Iran or North Korea.

The 2010 Levada poll showed that 55 per cent of the respondents believed
that the number one threat to Russian security was the deployment of US
BMD in neighbouring states. Only 13 per cent of the respondents stated
that Iran's nuclear programme represented the main threat to Russia and
13 per cent indicated that the main threat was North Korea's possession
of nuclear weapons.

The 2010 Levada survey could be analysed together with another 2010
Levada poll that confirmed the deeply engrained perception of America's
hostile intentions among Russians. Some 73 per cent of the polled
Russians indicated that the United States was an aggressor that sought
to establish control over all states. In November 2014, another survey
showed that 74 per cent of Russians had a negative opinion of the United
States -- an unprecedented peak in the post-Cold War period.

In this context, the portrayal of missile defence in Europe as a threat
to Russia was important to strengthen Putin's image among the Russian
population and elites. [[A confrontational approach to BMD was]{.mark},
for example, [useful before the 2012 presidential election]{.mark} when
Putin built his platform on the image of defending a besieged state.
Reconstructing the image of the United States as a Cold War type
aggressor facilitated this perception and justified running again on the
basis of the need to protect the Russian people from external
enemies.]{.underline}

Hence, [[castigating the U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates and NATO again
[became an effective strategy to win votes]{.mark}.]{.underline}

As a part of his 2012 presidential campaign, Putin published seven
articles in various Russian newspapers on seven major issues. In the
sixth article, entitled "Be Strong: Guarantees of National Security for
Russia," Putin focused on military issues and linked the construction of
missile defence in Europe to strengthening Russia's nuclear arsenal. The
soon-to-be again president argued that as missile defence in Europe
threatens Russia's security, Russia has to invest in improving the
capability of its nuclear forces to overcome the BMD threat.

This policy entails investing more in weapons modernisation, in Russia's
air and space defence,as well as in the military industrial sector.
These policies would most likely appeal to the large group of Russian
voters with a military outlook and Russians employed in the defence
industry and the military bureaucracy. Some reports estimate that these
voters could constitute as much as 40% of Russia's voting population --
quite a significant portion of the population to appeal to.

[Russia's return to a confrontational BMD position as a tool to distract
domestic audiences and contribute to Putin's approval ratings is
therefore, a logical manoeuvre.]{.underline} Russia is in the midst of a
currency crisis, with the Russian rouble hitting record low exchange
rates. Under pressure by Western sanctions and low oil prices, the
Kremlin's energy-dependent coffers may find it challenging to slow the
current rates of domestic policy problems that will likely affect public
confidence in the Russian leadership. As another Levada survey showed,
80 percent of Russians expect a worsening of Russia's economic
performance.

For all of these reasons[, BMD has become a political, rather than
military, tool for distraction that helps to convince the Russian
population of the need to focus on protecting the Russian state, rather
than their economic livelihoods]{.underline}.

#### U.S. BMD concessions are a prereq to any negotiations

**Arbatov '18** (Alexey G. Arbatov has worked at IMEMO (the Institute of
World Economy and International Relations of the Russian Academy of
Sciences) since 1976, with an interval from 1994 to 2003, when he was a
member of Russian parliament (State Duma), where he was deputy chair of
the Defense Committee. Since 2004 he has been the head of the Center for

227-237, 6/28/18,
<https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/00963402.2018.1486595>)

At present, [[deep political conflicts, profound mutual mistrust and
disrespect, and reciprocal historic grievances prevent any constructive
dialogue on missile defense]{.mark} between the United States and
Russia. Moreover, [neither the Putin nor the Trump administration
considers nuclear]{.mark} (or any other) [arms control a serious policy
priority]{.mark}. For Moscow, nuclear arms and deterrence constitute a
"sacred cow," and the same could be said about nuclear weapons and
missile defense for the current Republican administration in
Washington.]{.underline}

Nonetheless[, if the political environment improves or some arms control
venues are considered important enough to be made a "safe haven" from
other Russian-American controversies, a number of strategic changes now
under way might actually be conducive to new arms control
agreements:]{.underline}

The massive American nuclear modernization program envisioned by the
most recent US Nuclear Posture Review may revive Russia's interest in
strategic arms limitations after 2021, when the New START arms control
agreement expires (or after 2026 if the treaty term is extended).

The new Russian ballistic and hypersonic systems advertized in Putin's
statement earlier this year to the Federal Assembly may alleviate
Russia's real or self-inspired alarm about US ballistic missile
defenses. Those Russian systems could also serve to politically justify
a shift of Moscow's position on the BMD issue (as artificial as the
linkage may actually be).

Expansion of Russia's air-space defense program and system may make its
position on BMD limitation more flexible.

The United States may be motivated to continue strategic talks with
Russia by an interest in limitation of and transparency on Russia's new
ballistic, hypersonic, and underwater nuclear weapon programs.

The growing nuclear potential of China may make both Washington and
Moscow more interested in limiting their bilateral offensive-defensive
arms race and corresponding expenses.

[If and [when b]{.mark}allistic [m]{.mark}issile [d]{.mark}efense
[returns]{.mark} [as]{.mark} [a]{.mark} [subject]{.mark} of US-Russian
negotiations, [the two countries will start from quite distant points of
view]{.mark}. Most probably Washington would like to enjoy the right for
free deployment of global and regional BMD systems without any
quantitative or qualitative limitations.]{.underline} At a maximum, the
United States might find some transparency provisions and
confidence-building measures acceptable.

It is impossible to know whether Russia presently even wants a new
agreement with the United States and, if one were sought, what kind of
agreement it could be. In fact, while vehemently protesting against US
defense systems, Moscow has never formulated its position on BMD
limitation in any practical manner, and it is not at all clear whether
it has any such framework in mind now. Theoretically, Moscow would find
a new version of the ABM Treaty (just one permitted deployment area,
holding up to 100 missile-interceptors) preferable. It would probably
also strive for a prohibition on strategic BMD deployment beyond
national borders, or at least for a limitation on US Aegis (including
Aegis Ashore) systems that includes antimissiles' numbers, technical
characteristics and deployment geography. At the same time, Russia would
insist on free deployment of S-400 and S-500 systems across its and its
allies' national territories and on surface ships.

If both presidents showed enough determination, and there were a US
domestic political environment that permitted it, a compromise on
missile defense might be reached. The basis of such compromise may
consist in agreeing on definitions that separate the class of ballistic
missile defenses that could tangibly affect strategic stability by
intercepting a large number of US or Russian ICBMs and SLBMs from those
missile defenses that are aimed against other states and rogue regimes.
The first class of BMD would be restricted, but the second -- which
would enhance US-Russian mutual security -- could be given a "green
light."

An illustration of a possible deal: An agreement could limit strategic
BMD systems to two to three deployment areas inside each country, with
no more than 200 to 300 long-range missile interceptors (of the
ground-based missile defense and Nudol' types) in total. Such arrays
would be enough to deal with other nuclear states, rogue regimes, or
accidental launches. Regional BMD systems (Aegis or S-500 types) might
be limited as to the speed of their interceptors (for instance, to 5
km/sec27

Washington may also want to repeat its proposal of 2011 to allow Russia
to monitor Aegis missiles tests, which could provide assurance that the
system is not intended for boost-phase intercept. A boost-phase
capability is exactly what most concerns Moscow regarding the US BMD
deployments close to Russian territory (i.e. on land in Rumania and
Poland, and on ships, if deployed in the Black, Baltic, and Northern
seas). [If, however, the United States decides to enhance the
[Aegis]{.mark}-type [system]{.mark}]{.underline} for boost-phase
intercepts of ballistic missiles of third states or rogue regimes, then
certain [[limits on deployment geography would be needed to alleviate
Russia's concerns]{.underline}]{.mark}.29

#### Putin says no -- he needs to bluster on ballistic missiles for domestic politics

U.S. Vulnerabilities," *New York Times*, 3/1/18,
<https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/01/world/europe/russia-putin-speech.html>)

MOSCOW --- President Vladimir V. [[Putin]{.underline}]{.mark} of Russia
[[threatened the West with]{.mark} a new generation of nuclear weapons
Thursday, including [what he described as an "invincible"
intercontinental cruise missile and a nuclear torpedo that could
outsmart all American defenses.]{.mark}]{.underline}

[The presentation by Mr. Putin, which included animation videos
depicting multiple warheads aimed at Florida,]{.underline} where
President Trump often stays at his Mar-a-Lago resort, sharply escalated
the military invective in the tense relationship between the United
States and Russia, which has led to predictions of a costly new nuclear
arms race.

While Mr[. [Putin]{.underline} [may have been
bluffing]{.underline}]{.mark} about these weapons, as some experts
suggested, he cleverly focused on a vulnerability of American-designed
defenses: They are based on the assumption that enemy nuclear missiles
fly high and can be destroyed well before they reach their targets.

[[The new class of Russian weapons, he said, travel]{.mark} low,
stealthily, far and fast [--- too fast for defenders to
react]{.mark}]{.underline}.

[Mr[. Putin's announcement]{.mark}, in his annual state of the nation
address[, seemed intended chiefly to stir the patriotic passions of
Russians at a moment when he is heading into a re-election
campaign]{.mark}]{.underline}, even though his victory is assured in
what amounts to a one-candidate race.

[[He also used the speech to reassure Russians that the military buildup
was taking place]{.mark} even as the government was spending big sums to
improve the quality of their lives.]{.underline}

But the main attention grabber in the speech was the weapons, which Mr.
Putin described as a response to what he called the repudiation of arms
control by the United States and its plans for a major weapons buildup.

The Trump administration has said that countering the world's two other
superpowers, Russia and China, was becoming its No. 1 national security
mission, ahead of counterterrorism.

It has largely blamed Russia's military modernization for that shift and
has justified new work on nuclear weapons and bolstered missile defenses
as the appropriate answer.

[Mr. Putin may have further fueled the tension on Thursday by
essentially [declaring that Russia's military brains had made America's
response obsolete]{.mark}.]{.underline}

He said a team of young, high-tech specialists had labored secretly and
assiduously to develop and test the new weapons, including a
nuclear-powered missile that could reach anywhere and evade
interception.

"With the missile launched and a set of ground tests completed, we can
now proceed with the construction of a fundamentally new type of
weapon," Mr. Putin said.

He showed a video that illustrated the weapon flying over a mountain
range, then slaloming around obstacles in the southern Atlantic before
rounding Cape Horn at the tip of South America and heading north toward
the West Coast of the United States.

[Given that [deception lies at the heart of current Russian military
doctrine, questions arose about whether these weapons existed. American
officials said that the nuclear cruise missile is not yet operational,
despite]{.mark} Mr. [Putin's claim]{.mark}s]{.underline}, and that it
had crashed during testing in the Arctic.

The threats evoked the bombast of the Cold War. But this time they are
not based on greater numbers of bombs but increased capabilities,
stealth and guile.

Mr. Putin's boasts about undersea nuclear torpedoes and earth-hugging
cruise missiles emphasized the uselessness of American defenses against
such weapons.

Oddly, apart from a reference to renewing the American nuclear arms
enterprise in his State of the Union address, Mr. Trump has said almost
nothing about the new era of competition with Mr. Putin or Russia. With
multiple investigations into whether his campaign's connections to
Russians had influenced policy, he has neither protested the Russian
buildup nor publicly endorsed, in any detail, his own administration's
plans to counter it.

The cruise missile was among five weapons introduced by Mr. Putin, each
shown in video mock-ups on giant screens flanking him onstage. He
threatened to use the weapons, as well as Russia's older-generation
nuclear arms, against the United States and Europe if Russia were
attacked.

"We would consider any use of nuclear weapons against Russia or its
allies to be a nuclear attack on our country," he said.

Mr. Putin said he could not show the actual weapons publicly, but
assured his audience of Russia's main political and prominent cultural
figures that they had all been developed.

If Mr. Putin was not bluffing, said Aleksandr M. Golts, an independent
Russian military analyst, then "these weapons are definitely new,
absolutely new."

"If we're talking about nuclear-armed cruise missiles, that's a
technological breakthrough and a gigantic achievement," he said in an
interview. But, he added, "The question is, is this true?"

Several analysts writing on Facebook and elsewhere leaned toward the
bluff theory. Given the recent history of Russian launch failures or
premature crashes, the idea that Russia suddenly possessed a new
generation of flying weapons strained credulity.

"The real surprise in among all of this is a nuclear-powered cruise
missile," said Douglas Barrie, a senior fellow for military aerospace at
the International Institute for Strategic Studies in London. "It was
talked about in the '60s, but it ran into a lot of obstacles. To the
extent that the Russians are seriously revisiting this is pretty
interesting."

Such technology could alter the balance of power, but Mr. Barrie
questioned whether Russia was even close to deploying it.

"Does reality mean you have an item in the budget saying, 'Develop
nuclear propulsion for a missile?'" he said. "Or does it mean, 'We're
going to have one ready to use soon'? I'd certainly want to see more
evidence to believe that."

Mr. Putin said Russia had developed the weaponry because the United
States had rejected established arms control treaties and was deploying
new missile defense systems in Europe and Asia.

[President Barack Obama said that he was willing to negotiate cuts
deeper than the 1,550 arms that Washington and Moscow are permitted to
deploy under the 2010 New Start treaty, which took full effect last
month. But it expires in a few years, and neither Mr. Putin nor Mr.
Trump has shown interest in renewing it.]{.underline}

[The United States has also accused Russia of violating the Intermediate
Nuclear Forces treaty. After Mr. Putin's speech, Heather Nauert, the
State Department's spokeswoman, said Mr. Putin essentially confirmed
that by trumpeting the country's development of new nuclear
weapons.]{.underline}

Mr. [Putin was correct that the United States is investing in expanding
missile defenses]{.underline}. But those were not meant to counter
Russia's huge arsenals, but rather the launching of a few missiles by a
state like North Korea.

[[The new Russian weapons would render such defenses obsolete,]{.mark}
Mr[. Putin gloated, and if anyone found a workaround, "our boys will
think of something new."]{.mark}]{.underline}

Other weapons the Russian leader discussed included a ballistic missile
called Sarmat that could round either pole and overcome any defense
system; hypersonic nuclear weaponry that fly at 20 times the speed of
sound; and unmanned deepwater submarines that could go huge distances at
enormous speed.

Mr. Putin said that some of the weapons were so new that they had yet to
be named, and announced a naming contest on the Ministry of Defense
website.

[[Political analysts said it was an effective campaign ploy whether the
weapons existed or not]{.mark}. "[He's giving people the image of a
desired future,]{.mark} of a future for Russia, and [that's appealing
for his domestic audience]{.mark},"]{.underline} said Aleksei V.
Makarkin, the deputy head of the Center for Political Technologies, a
Moscow think tank.

Mr. Putin's guns-and-butter, Russia-can-do-it-all speech came 17 days
before the March 18 election. [It seemed intended to reassure voters
that expanded social spending would help solve the economic problems of
the past four years, while sending the message that Mr. Putin was their
best hope in protecting a Russia portrayed as a besieged
fortress.]{.underline}

Russia received the best possible gift from the Trump administration
right before Christmas and now has a free hand to determine the future
of its troubled Middle Eastern ally. With the United States preparing to
exit the Syrian conflict, [the [Kremlin's]{.mark}
[strategy]{.mark}]{.underline} won't change much. That's because it [was
[never]{.mark} [about]{.mark} [Syria]{.mark}]{.underline} from the
beginning.

[Projecting the effects of Russia's Syria campaign beyond the Middle
East was always the Kremlin's goal]{.underline}. Projecting the effects
of Russia's Syria campaign beyond the Middle East was always the
Kremlin's goal. [The [conflict was]{.mark}]{.underline} always perceived
as [[a tool to showcase ambitions]{.mark} that assert Russia as a global
powe]{.underline}r. Moscow perceives U.S. President Donald Trump's
abandonment of Syria as a victory that adds greatly to its political
capital. It could also allow Moscow to reach out to European leaders in
France and Germany, as well as the European Union's foreign-policy
chief, by persuading them to embrace their own version of a political
settlement.

Russia officially launched its airstrikes in Syria in September 2015. At
the same time, Moscow's heavy-handed attempts to tighten its grip over
eastern Ukraine were accompanied by waves of sanctions that quickly sent
the Kremlin's international political capital plummeting. Despite trying
hard to appear as the world's biggest disruptor and antagonizing the
Western world at every turn, [[Moscow's true objective was to gain
enough influence to re-engage]{.mark}]{.underline} with it [as an
equal.]{.underline}

Ukraine was a lost cause. According to Mikhail Zygar, the former editor
of Russia's independent TV news channel, Rain, Russian President
Vladimir Putin had informed George W. Bush in 2008 at the NATO Summit:
"If Ukraine joins NATO, it will do so without Crimea and the eastern
regions. It will simply fall apart." The Kremlin was never in a position
to compromise over its former Soviet satellite, and [its]{.underline}
[international ambitions always went well beyond being a "regional
power]{.underline}"---an insult once uttered by U.S. President Barack
Obama.

When Russia intervened in the Middle East, Syria found itself in a
Hobbesian state of nature with thousands of groups fighting each other
and the Islamic State emerging as the world's biggest bogeyman. Moscow,
however, still suffered from the so-called Afghan syndrome that preceded
the collapse of the Soviet empire. The ghosts of the war in Afghanistan
in the 1980s still haunt the corridors of the Kremlin; few want to end
up in another quagmire in the Islamic world. Despite hoping for a quick
victory after overthrowing Afghan President Hafizullah Amin and
reinstalling the communist leadership in 1979, the Soviet military ended
up in a decadelong debacle and lost about 15,000 troops. As a result,
any possible military campaign in Syria was met with an extreme caution.
Although it was a gamble to intervene, the possible benefits eventually
outweighed the risks in the eyes of the Kremlin's strategists.Although
it was a gamble to intervene, the possible benefits eventually
outweighed the risks in the eyes of [the Kremlin]{.underline}'s
strategists.

[They]{.mark} [[saw]{.mark} [defeating]{.mark} the
[Is]{.mark}lam[i]{.mark}c [S]{.mark}tate and playing first fiddle in
directing a political settlement in Syria [as an opportunity to assert
Russia's status]{.mark} as a global power]{.underline}. The chance to
fight together with Western nations, combined with Moscow's special
relations with the Syrian regime and Iran, which carried out most of
fighting on the ground, meant that the Kremlin could present itself as
fighting against a universal evil in the form of the Islamic State while
also securing a comparative edge.

Emerging as a regional power was another objective. Speaking in the
plenary meeting of the United Nations General Assembly that took place
just two days before the aerial campaign, Putin endowed Russia with a
"fixer role" by famously addressing the United States with the question:
"Do you at least realize now what you've done?" Moscow sensed the
opportunity to fill a vacuum in a metastasizing conflict zone that only
grew as American disillusionment with an interventionist U.S. Middle
East policy deepened. The fixer role has delivered its benefits, but
Russia didn't enter Syria to fix it. Putin always intended to be much
more than a fixer; he wanted Moscow to be an indispensable actor.

Russia's actions were not simply opportunistic and dictated by
short-term tactical thinking. The goal in Syria was not to grab what was
left but to flex its muscle and showcase power. Moscow's approach turned
out to be a blessing in disguise within the turbulent setting of the
Middle East. When one man in the Kremlin and a cohort of few chosen
aides decide everything in the course of a phone call, it's a familiar
way of doing business that resonates with authoritarian regimes across
the region.

[After three years of nonstop bombing]{.underline} and throughout the
previous year's summits in Sochi, Russia, and Astana, Kazakhstan, it
became obvious that Russia was championing a political settlement. [Its
foreign adventures seemed to have paid off.]{.underline} The Kremlin's
actions helped it to secure access to all conflicting parties in the
region, and its voice is now heard from the corridors of power in Tehran
and Cairo to the ritzy palaces of the Gulf monarchies.

### 1ar at: Russia Leverage CP -- say no (Syria)

#### Syria is strategically key for Putin

<https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/25/magazine/russia-united-states-world-politics.html>

[It was in [Syria where Putin challenged his country's post-Cold War
identity]{.mark}]{.underline}, as well as how the West had perceived it
for so long. His decision to commit Russian forces has been portrayed as
the first step in an effort to realign the region, but the strategy was
largely a result of luck and timing, its tactics born partly of a lack
of resources.

After protests against the government of President Bashar al-Assad began
in 2011, Moscow blocked United Nations resolutions that would have paved
the way for future intervention and continued shipping weapons to the
Syrian Army. Russia's drive to protect Assad dovetailed with the
American administration's regional disengagement. Obama had no interest
in entangling America in another war. He said the "red line" would be
the use of chemical weapons, yet as evidence of their use piled up,
Washington did little. After the emergence of the Islamic State in 2013,
the United States quickly became fixated on fighting the group itself,
with little more than vague words of support for the Syrian opposition.

By 2015, Assad's regime was on the precipice of collapse, losing
territory to ISIS and the anti-government militias simultaneously. [The
Middle East is far closer to Moscow than to Washington;]{.underline}
Syria's nearest border with Russia is roughly as far away as Washington
is from Boston. [[Moscow feared the spread of unrest and
terrorism]{.mark}]{.underline} like a contagion. On Sept. 30, 2015,
Assad sent a formal request for assistance based on a 1980 military
cooperation treaty, which the Russian Parliament rubber-stamped. Russian
armed forces officially went in. (Many Russians I spoke to quickly
pointed out that because of this process, Putin's military presence in
Syria, unlike the U.S. invasion of Iraq, is permissible.)

After years of "covert" war by Russia in Ukraine and the legacy of a
decade-long Soviet embroilment in Afghanistan, which killed 14,000
Soviet troops and one million civilians, the Russian population was
genuinely wary about the intervention in Syria. In a poll by the Levada
Center, Russia's only major independent polling center, 69 percent of
Russians were against direct military involvement. In terms of technical
support, opinions were split --- only 43 percent believed Russia should
advise and arm Assad, while 41 percent were against it. Analysts and
opposition politicians pointed out a host of risks from Russian
"adventurism." Dmitry Gudkov, Russia's most vocal opposition member of
Parliament, warned about potential repercussions. "It is not known how
this will end," he cautioned during an interview with Radio Free
Europe/Radio Liberty. Russia has its own large Muslim minority, roughly
10 percent of the population, and ex-Soviet countries contributed the
largest cadre of foreign ISIS fighters, estimated at up to 8,500 people.
Gudkov cautioned that troops on the ground in Syria risked inflaming
ethnic tensions within Russia's own borders.

The Kremlin cares deeply about domestic opinion and set about selling
the intervention on television and through pro-war op-eds. "The entire
Middle East, due to internal reasons and the stupid, unceremonious and
irresponsible intervention of the West, entered a period of decades of
instability," Sergei Karaganov, honorary chairman of the Council on
Foreign and Defense Policy, explained on a popular Saturday
political-affairs show. "And this instability will have to be
controlled."

The Russian incursion began with a volley of airstrikes "targeting ISIS"
in an area where there were no records of its activity. It was instead
home to anti-Assad militias and at least one C.I.A.-trained group. The
following day, Lavrov clarified that the Russian air campaign was
targeting "all terrorists." Over the coming weeks, Russia surprised
Western officials with its modernized military. After the country's
disastrous war with Georgia in 2008, Putin had embarked on an extensive
modernization program. Russia deployed 215 new weapons, showcasing them
to potential buyers. Strikes utilized the relatively untested Sukhoi
Su-34 strike fighter and a ship-based cruise missile fired more than 900
miles from the Caspian Sea, which, according to some analysts, exceeded
American capabilities. Putin was open about Russia's intended message.
"It is one thing for the experts to be aware that Russia supposedly has
these weapons, and another thing for them to see for the first time that
they do really exist," he said on state television.

[[The payoff was immediate: Russia's international isolation was
over]{.underline}]{.mark}. The afternoon Russia struck, Secretary of
State John Kerry and Lavrov met at the United Nations and agreed to
begin talks on avoiding unintended confrontations. "Obama didn't give a
hoot about Syria by 2015," Robert Ford, America's former ambassador to
Syria, told me. "All he was interested in was the fight against ISIS."
He went on: "I think the Americans at that point, the White House, had
washed their hands of it, and [Kerry]{.underline}, kind of operating
almost solo, [was pleading with the Russians.]{.underline}"

Russia's official military death toll has remained relatively low
throughout the conflict. The brunt of the casualty count, which the
state suppresses, has been borne by private contractors, including the
Wagner Group, a firm said to be run by Putin's close friend Yevgeny
Prigozhin, known as "Putin's chef," though mercenaries are technically
illegal in Russia.

As Michelle Dunne, director of the Middle East program at the Carnegie
Endowment for International Peace, told me: "Putin has played a clever
hand on the cheap, without really investing that much in it." Russia's
economy is 10 times smaller than America's, and Trenin estimated the
cost at roughly \$4 million per day, which is "reasonably affordable"
for the state budget. (By comparison, the United States' mission in
Syria, part of Operation Inherent Resolve, cost \$54 billion from 2014
to 2019, or \$25 million a day.)

By 2017, [Russia had embarked on its own diplomatic solution to the
conflict]{.underline}, outside the United Nations process, holding
conferences in Astana and Sochi alongside Turkey (a NATO member) and
Iran. "The Russians transformed the Syrian rebellion from one actively
fighting Bashar al-Assad to one giving up on the fall of Bashar al-Assad
and trying to preserve their areas of influence," Hassan Hassan,
director of the nonstate actors program at the Center for Global Policy,
told me. Hassan explained that Turkey's place alongside Moscow in the
Astana conference gave Russia credibility in the eyes of the anti-Assad
militias. Yet they knew full well whom they were dealing with. Under the
guise of supporting Assad against ISIS, Moscow assisted and looked the
other way as the regime dropped barrel bombs on hospitals, starved
civilian population centers and set up massive domestic detention and
torture facilities. More than half a million people have been killed in
the fighting. Russia has also successfully obfuscated the most egregious
Assad crimes --- the use of chemical weapons. In Sochi and Astana, those
fighting the dictator are now sitting down with the same power breathing
life into his despotic government. "The fighters trusted Turkey more
than they trusted Russia," Hassan told me. "But Russia was the leader."

In many ways, [[Moscow's assertive foreign policy came as a result of
earlier decisions made in Washington]{.underline}]{.mark}. Both Putin
and the Obama administration were responding to the same thing: George
W. Bush's aggressive foreign policy. America's withdrawal from the
Middle East and elsewhere was the result of an American imperial
hangover. Russia and the United States had moved in opposite directions,
creating an appearance of one power rising and the other falling. The
outcome was ultimately the same: "[Whatever people think about Russia's
role, everybody acknowledges that it is the key state
there]{.underline}," Lukyanov told me. "It's not because of Russian
strength; it's because of American weakness, it's because of European
geopolitical collapse. But that's a fact of life now."

### 2ac at: Assurance - Uq 

#### Non UQ - The US-Japan alliance is at a historic low and Japan has already perceived signals of abandonment -- Trump actions with North Korea, remarks about commitment to allies, and trade deficit.

The **Economist 18** (The Economist, 9-6-2018, \"Japan is worried about
its alliance with America,\" The Economist,
https://www.economist.com/asia/2018/09/06/japan-is-worried-about-its-alliance-with-america,
Accessed: 7-12-2019 //kent - wh)

At the same time[, [the alliance between Japan and America is under
**unprecedented stress**,]{.underline}]{.mark} [mainly because of
America's president, **Donald Trump**]{.underline} (pictured with
Japan's prime minister, Shinzo Abe, in Tokyo last November). There are
worries in Tokyo that [Mr Trump might strike a **deal with North Korea's
leader**, Kim Jong Un, that protects America but leaves Japan exposed to
a North Korean attack]{.underline}. [Japan has been feeling largely
[**sidelined** during the recent high-level diplomacy surrounding North
Korea's nukes]{.mark}]{.underline}. Indeed, Katsuyuki Kawai, an adviser
to Mr Abe, describes [the Trump-Kim summit in June in Singapore as a
**wake-up call** for Japan]{.underline}. [After the meeting, Mr Trump
announced a **suspension of exercises** with South Korea and aired the
idea of **withdrawing American troops** from the Korean peninsula. "**We
have decisively entered a new security environment,"**]{.underline} says
Mr Kawai.

Few observers go quite that far, but [[Japanese]{.mark} and American
[officials **wince** at]{.mark} Mr [Trump's casual raising of **doubts**
about his commitment to allies and]{.mark} about [his belief in the
**global economic order**]{.mark} that has allowed Japan to
prosper]{.underline}. They still prefer not to air their worries
publicly. For example, Taro Kono, the foreign minister, praises the
alliance as "stronger than ever". He points to the personal rapport
between Mr Abe and Mr Trump, who has spent more time talking to Japan's
prime minister than to any other country's leader. On February 14th the
two men spoke by telephone for more than an hour about North Korea and
other matters. Mr Kono jokes that having such a long chat on Valentine's
Day is something he would not do with his wife.

[Yet in private some [Japanese officials say that **Mr Trump unnerves
them**]{.mark} when he says that America is being taken advantage of by
other countries, including allies, and that he resents spending so much
on deployments abroad]{.underline}. Japan-hands in America say he does
not seem to understand that the 54,000 American troops in Japan are
there to defend not just Japan, but also American primacy in the region.

Most imminently, [[a storm is looming over
**trade**]{.underline}]{.mark}. [Mr Trump is **obsessed** with America's
trade deficits, and one of its largest is with Japan.]{.underline} It
was nearly \$70bn last year (see chart). [Mr Trump wants a deal with
Japan that could oblige it to reduce tariffs on agricultural imports.
Japan is **resisting**]{.underline}. It says that Mr Trump should look
not just at trade but also at the scale of Japanese investment in
America. Japanese firms make 3.8m cars there annually, more than double
the number they send to America from Japan.

But Mr Blair, [[the former Pacific forces chie]{.mark}f]{.underline}
(who also served as President Barack Obama's director of national
intelligence), [[describes]{.mark} Mr [Trump's refusal to exempt Japan
from his tariffs]{.mark} on steel and aluminium [as "**a dress
rehearsal**" for things to come]{.mark}.]{.underline} Unlike China,
[Japan has refrained from retaliating against Mr Trump's assaults on
free trade. But if America applies tariffs of 25% on cars, as he has
threatened, Mr Abe would find it hard not to **respond** in
kind]{.underline}. Japan's exports of cars to America have doubled in
the past six years, to \$40bn. [Extra [tariffs]{.mark} on them [could be
an **embarrassment too far** for Mr Abe]{.mark}, [on top of]{.mark} the
humiliation he has already suffered as a result of Mr [Trump's
Japan-neglecting diplomacy in the region]{.mark}.]{.underline}

These developments together have major implications for U.S. deterrence
strategy, with its separate dimensions of extended deterrence, central
deterrence, and strategic stability. Changes in one or all of these
dimensions have important implications for Japan, which has opted to
continue to depend upon the United States as a security guarantor,
specifically on U.S. extended nuclear deterrence. [A strong anti-nuclear
weapons sentiment prevails among both the Japanese public and its
political leadership, and the sentiment has only grown stronger with the
Fukushima nuclear power plant accident of 2011]{.underline}. [[Japan's
commitment to its non-nuclear policy remains firm despite North Korea's
nuclear weapons and missile development]{.mark}, which have become
increasingly provocative with increased tests of missiles and nuclear
explosions.]{.underline} More significantly in the context of
deterrence, the increased North Korean threat has moved Japan to further
strengthen defense cooperation with the United States for the purpose of
enhancing the credibility of U.S. extended deterrence. [[Japan's
non-nuclear policy will not change until and unless the U.S. nuclear
umbrella loses its credibility in Japanese eyes.]{.mark} There are also
important practical reasons for Japan not to pursue an independent
nuclear deterrent,]{.underline} to be discussed later.

#### Non UQ - Trump has already undermined US-Japan security alliance through comments about the security treaty - the key issue in the US-Japan alliance. 

**Bass 6/28** (Gary J. Bass, professor of politics and international
affairs, Trumps Ignorant Comments about Japan were Bad, Even for Him,
New York Times,
https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/28/opinion/trump-japan.html)

President Trump reserves some of his worst behavior for foreign trips,
such as abasing himself before President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia in
Helsinki a year ago, skipping a ceremony in France last fall to honor
American soldiers killed in World War I (too rainy, the White House
said) and insulting the mayor of London earlier this month. Yet even by
Mr. Trump's dismal standards, his performance this week before the G-20
summit in Osaka, Japan, should take everyone's breath away. More than
yet another demonstration of his erratic behavior, this was also an
object lesson in the dangers of his context-free hostility to the world
beyond the United States.

[Before arriving in Japan, Mr. [Trump]{.mark} [had reportedly been
musing about withdrawing the U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates [from the
security treaty with Japan]{.mark} signed in 1951 and revised in 1960
--- [the cornerstone of the alliance]{.mark} between the United States
and Japan and a pillar of American foreign policy.]{.underline} On
Wednesday, asked about the treaty on Fox News, Mr. Trump sneered, ["If
Japan is attacked, we will fight World War III." Then he added: "But if
we're attacked, Japan doesn't have to help us at all. They can watch it
on a Sony television."]{.underline}

Mr. Trump's comment demonstrates a strategic cluelessness and historical
ignorance that would disqualify a person from even a modest desk job at
the State Department.

Though Mr. Trump implied that the security treaty favors Japan, it was
largely dictated by the United States. After Imperial Japan surrendered
to the Allies in August 1945, ending World War II, the country was
placed under an American-led occupation overseen by the domineering Gen.
Douglas MacArthur. When that occupation ended in April 1952, Japan had
turned away from militarism to embrace ideals of pacifism and democracy.
Under Article 9 of a new Constitution that was originally drafted in
English at MacArthur's headquarters, Japan renounced war and pledged
never to maintain land, sea or air forces.

In the 1951 security treaty that Mr. Trump apparently disparages, the
United States, from a position of extraordinary dominance over Japan,
got pretty much what it wanted. Japan granted the United States the
exclusive right to post land, air and sea forces in and around Japan,
which the United States could use to defend Japan against armed attack
or against Soviet-instigated riots. In a revised 1960 treaty, it was
made clear that if Japan was attacked, the United States would defend
it. For much of the Cold War, a democratic Japan became the core of
American alliances in Asia, a bulwark against Communism in the Soviet
Union and China. Furthermore, [Mr. Trump insults his Japanese hosts by
overlooking how Japan actually responded when the United States was
attacked on Sept. 11, 2001.]{.underline} The Japanese public grieved for
their American allies after the terrorist attacks, which also killed
some Japanese citizens. Japan's conservative and pro-American prime
minister, Junichiro Koizumi, took the massacre as an opportunity to
reconsider Article 9 and urge his country to shoulder more international
responsibilities. His government rammed through an antiterrorism law
which enabled Japan's Self-Defense Force to provide support for the
American campaign in Afghanistan, although --- because of the country's
official pacifism --- without fighting or directly supporting combat
operations.

When President George W. Bush invaded Iraq in 2003, Mr. Koizumi was one
of his staunchest foreign supporters. Although Japan remained
constitutionally forbidden from joining in the invasion or taking a
direct military role, Mr. Koizumi's government passed a special law
allowing the Self-Defense Force to help in humanitarian support missions
in postwar Iraq. Hundreds of Japanese ground troops in Iraq provided
water and medical help, and fixed roads and buildings. One might
reasonably fault Mr. Koizumi, as plenty of Japanese do, for going along
with Mr. Bush's disastrous invasion --- but it is far harder to blame
Japan, as Mr. Trump does, for not standing alongside the United States.

[Mr. [Trump's words are also a pointless slap to]{.mark} Japan's
right-wing prime minister, Shinzo [Abe]{.mark}, who has ardently sought
to cultivate a relationship with Mr. Trump and is trying to mediate a
way out of the crisis between the United States and Iran]{.underline}.
The 1960 treaty was signed by Mr. Abe's grandfather, Nobusuke Kishi,
another prime minister. During a four-day state visit to Japan in May,
Mr. Abe flattered Mr. Trump with an extraordinary meeting with Japan's
new emperor, a sumo wrestling match and a lavish state banquet at the
Imperial Palace. Yet [standing next to Mr. Abe at a news conference in
Tokyo, Mr. [Trump shrugged off Japanese fears about North Korea's recent
tests of short-range ballistic missiles]{.mark} that could kill
thousands of Japanese civilians.]{.underline}

What could Mr. Trump possibly hope to gain from his ignorant, ungrateful
and antagonistic behavior? He is unlikely to withdraw from the security
treaty. Yet by questioning the alliance with Japan, Mr. Trump encourages
North Korea and a rising China to test that bond. [[His words undercut
an essential alliance]{.mark} for no evident reason [and erode the
stability of a strategic region torn by
rivalry]{.mark}]{.underline}[.]{.mark}

And we are all so used to it by now that it barely registers.

YAKIMA, Washington---Gunfire rang out as U.S. and Japanese troops
descended on a small village. Unloading from their armored vehicles,
they poured into alleyways and set up security positions. The soldiers
moved carefully, methodically clearing out buildings before going to the
next position as they looked for enemy forces. The maneuvers felt real,
but in truth, they were part of the annual training exercise, Rising
Thunder, that brings U.S. soldiers and members of the Japan Ground
Self-Defense Force (JGSDF) to the Yakima Training Center in Washington
state.

The U.S. Army first began using these training grounds in the 1940s,
when it leased the land to prepare soldiers to fight against the
Japanese military. In those days, the wide-open terrain was ideal for
artillery drills for U.S. troops training to defend the United States'
coastlines and fight Japanese forces in the Pacific.

This time around, the two nations were working together as allies. As
soldiers cleared buildings, officers explained that the U.S. Army has
been putting increasing attention on training for potential battles in
densely populated megacities, which military planners worry could pose
major challenges in future wars. The exercise wrapped up on Sept. 14,
and each side hopefully left with a better understanding of the other's
tactics and equipment for such future missions.

For many decades, Japan, which is home to several U.S. military bases
and is a key trading partner, has been one of Washington's closest
allies. They share common concerns about China's territorial
assertiveness and North Korean nuclear ambitious.

[But [things have been more strained since]{.mark} U.S. President Donald
[Trump]{.mark} was elected [and could grow even more]{.mark} so after

have a good relationship with the Japanese leader but added: "Of course
that will end as soon as I tell them how much they have to
pay."]{.underline}

This wouldn't be the first time a meeting between the two men ended in
discomfort. According to the *Washington Post*, Trump surprised Abe
during an otherwise pleasant meeting in June when he declared, "[I

before launching into a tirade about trade relations between the two
countries. During the 2016 campaign, Trump questioned the value of the
U.S.-Japanese alliance and suggested withdrawing all U.S. troops from
country unless Tokyo agreed to pay vast sums of money.

As one of only two countries (the other being the United States) with
both the lower- and upper-level capabilities for intercepting incoming
missiles, Japan now has one of the most sophisticated missile defense
systems in the entire world. Conventional wisdom and the existing
literature consider this success along a historical trajectory that
started the day of the 1998 North Korean Taepodong launch. But the
narrative shows that the [[achievement of missile]{.mark} [defense

in the late 1980s]{.mark}]{.underline}. Though the Taepodong incident
was indeed important, numerous other factors -- including [[alliance

Japan's military wants record spending next year to help pay for major
upgrades to defenses designed to shoot down North Korean ballistic
missiles that Tokyo sees as a continued threat despite Pyongyang's
promise to abandon nuclear weapons. The Ministry of Defence budget
proposal released on Friday calls for defense spending to rise 2.1
percent to 5.3 trillion yen (\$48 billion) for the year starting
April 1. If approved, it will be the seventh straight annual increase as
Prime Minister Shinzo Abe reinforces Japan's military to respond to any
North Korea missile strike and counter China's growing air and sea power
in the waters around Japan. The proposed defense budget still has to
face scrutiny by Ministry of Finance officials who may seek to curtail
any rise in military outlays to secure funds for Japan's burgeoning
health and welfare spending. The biggest proposed outlay in the military
budget will be on ballistic missile defense, with a request for 235
billion yen for two new powerful ground-based Aegis Ashore radar missile
tracking stations built by Lockheed Martin Corp. Japan's military also
wants funds to buy longer-range Raytheon Co SM-3 interceptor missiles
designed to strike enemy missiles in space and money to improve the
range and accuracy of its PAC-3 missiles batteries that are the last
line of defense against incoming warheads. Premium: Japanese F-15 jets

[There are]{.underline} additional [reasons that [Japan is highly
unlikely to consider a nuclear option]{.mark}.]{.underline} First,
[there is the financial factor. [Japan lacks strategic depth]{.mark}, as
[its population is heavily concentrated in a few major cities]{.mark}
along the coasts]{.underline}. Thus, th[e only credible deterrent it
might consider would be one deployed at sea]{.underline}---nuclear
submarines carrying nuclear tipped ballistic missiles. [[This would be
hugely expensive]{.mark}. It [would also take many years to create such
a force]{.mark}, during which time its security position would likely
erode considerably]{.underline}---especially if it were to seek such a
capability over Washington's objections. Given Japan's need for a
credible conventional defense posture---and the rising costs of fielding
advanced defensive systems---it makes far more sense for Japan to invest
toward that end. A related objective, as discussed further below, should
be to help strengthen the capacity of the Southeast Asian countries for
maritime security.

[There is]{.underline} also [a diplomatic factor. [A]{.mark} Japanese
[decision to embark upon nuclear weapons development
would]{.mark}]{.underline} no doubt [[deal a shattering blow to the
nonproliferation regime and the N]{.mark}uclear
[N]{.mark}on[-P]{.mark}roliferation [T]{.mark}reaty, [which
would]{.mark} likely [result in the emergence of additional threats to
Japan]{.mark}. [It would also lead immediately to the country's
political isolation]{.mark}. Among the many consequences of [this would
be the damaging effects on the country's economy.]{.mark}]{.underline}

Strategically, [[a Japanese decision to create an independent nuclear
deterrent would make the Americans]{.mark} [question the continued value
to the United States of the Japan--U.S. Security
Treaty]{.mark}]{.underline}. After all, from a U.S. perspective, such a
Japanese decision would reflect a loss of Japanese confidence in the
willingness and/or ability of the United States to make good on its
promise to defend Japan.

Leader Tries So Hard to Court Trump", Politico Magazine,

TOKYO---Flying nearly 7,000 miles is not President Donald Trump's idea
of a good time. But he departed for Japan on Friday giddily anticipating
what he promised a day earlier would be "the biggest event they've had
in over 200 years": that is, his own meeting with the country's new
emperor.

While his hosts may not view Trump's visit as quite so momentous, it is
a crescendo in the remarkable campaign of flattery and cajoling waged by
Japan's prime minister, Shinzo Abe.

[Trump had not yet been inaugurated when Abe hopped on a plane,
uninvited, to meet with the president-elect at Trump Tower. Since then,
Abe has golfed with Trump three times; visited Mar-a-Lago twice; gifted
him a golf club
[worth](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/reliable-source/wp/2016/11/21/donald-trump-gets-3755-gold-golf-club-from-japanese-prime-minister/?utm_term=.2349d409b43a)
nearly \$3,800; dropped in on First Lady Melania Trump's birthday
[dinner](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/reliable-source/wp/2016/11/21/donald-trump-gets-3755-gold-golf-club-from-japanese-prime-minister/?utm_term=.2349d409b43a);
and even, according to Trump himself, nominated Trump for a Nobel Prize.
[The two leaders have had 10 personal meetings and spoken 30 other
times]{.mark}.]{.underline} "That is absolutely unprecedented," says a
senior Trump administration official. Speaking to reporters on Thursday,
Trump boasted that Abe had assured him of his state visit: "I am the
guest, meaning the United States is the guest, but Prime Minister Abe
said to me, very specifically, 'You are the guest of honor. There's only
one guest of honor.'"

The Japanese media has taken copious note of the camaraderie. A Friday
article in the Japan Times noted that on his last trip to Washington,
Abe "was even offered the use of Trump's personal restroom in the White
House."

Abe no doubt appreciates the bathroom privileges. [But [his relentless
courtship of Trump seems]{.mark}---to say the least---off-brand for a
leader who came to power by presenting himself [as a resolute
nationalist, retailing a vision of a strong Japan more than any leader
in decades]{.mark}.]{.underline} Prostrating himself before Trump has
put him in an awkward position. [[Trump is personally
[unpopular](https://www.pewglobal.org/2018/11/12/views-of-the-u-s-and-president-trump/)
in Japan]{.mark}, and even apart from that, no one likes to see Japan's
prime minister bend his behavior, or travel schedule, around other
leaders.]{.underline} "The Japanese public does not like our leader to
entertain another country's leader," said Koji Murata, a professor of
political science at Doshisha University in Kyoto.

[So why the desperate overtures to the U.S. president? To understand
Abe's surprising relationship to Trump is to understand the deep
insecurity that has developed in Japan in recent years.]{.underline}
With its once-powerhouse economy long-stagnant, the world-historical
rise of China, which Japan's imperial army badly abused during the war,
has stoked deep alarm. North Korea continues to develop nuclear weapons
and missiles capable of delivering them to Japan---and relations with
South Korea, the regional power best positioned to help Tokyo
counterbalance these threats, are at their lowest point in many years.
Even Russia harasses Japanese airspace as part of a dispute over
contested northern islands.

Trump has only made this situation more precarious for Abe and his
compatriots. With its pacifist constitution and a military far smaller
than its status as the world's third-largest economy would imply, Japan
needs America's protection---and finds itself staring across the Pacific
at an erratic partner easily dismissive of longtime global commitments.
[[The fear that the U.S.-Japan alliance could be in jeopardy]{.mark} was
one I heard from numerous government officials and academics I met
during a weeklong visit to Japan earlier this year. And, they say, [Abe
will do what he must to maintain it, whatever the cost to his personal
pride.]{.mark}]{.underline}

"People in Japan understand that Mr. Trump is quite unpredictable, and
that we need to treat him in a different way," said Murata.

"They need the relationship for their own protection," adds Jeffrey
Prescott, a former Obama White House national security council aide who
served as senior Asia adviser to former Vice President Joe Biden.
"They're worried about being caught out in the cold."

When Abe visited the U.S. last year, Trump startled him with a blunt
historical reference: "I remember Pearl Harbor," Trump
[cracked](https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/i-remember-pearl-harbor-inside-trumps-hot-and-cold-relationship-with-japans-prime-minister/2018/08/28/d6117021-e310-40a4-b688-68fdf5ed2f38_story.html?utm_term=.46dbcef71365),
reportedly launching into a complaint about Japan's economic policies.
However impolitic his remark may have been, Trump is right to think that
World War II continues to rule America's relationship with Japan. But a
more defining moment than the 1941 surprise attack on America's Pacific
fleet is what happened four years later in Hiroshima, when the U.S.
punctuated the final days of the war by dropping an atomic bomb on the
city, raising ground temperatures nearby to 5,000 degrees and instantly
killing up to 80,000 people.

Today, the modest port city, also known for baseball and its symphony
orchestra, has become a living monument to the horror of war, and also a
place to contemplate the oddity of Japan's continued dependency on the
country that crushed it in anger nearly 75 years ago. Nine days after
the blast, and after the U.S. dropped another atomic bomb, this time on
Nagasaki, Emperor Hirohito---whose grandson, Naruhito, Trump will visit
in Tokyo on Monday---announced his country's unconditional surrender to
America. Thus began a long and fraught dependency that continues to this
day.

It was an incredible twist of history when the conquered nation,
emerging from a fascist nightmare, actually welcomed its new occupiers
after the war. "The Americans arrived anticipating, many of them, a
traumatic confrontation with fanatical emperor worshippers. They were
accosted instead by women who called 'yoo hoo' to the first troops
landing on the beaches in full battle gear, and men who bowed and asked
what their conquerors wished," writes John W. Dower in his Pulitzer
Prize-wining history of postwar Japan, Embracing Defeat. William
Manchester's epic biography of Douglas MacArthur recounts the moment one
of the general's aides first stepped off a plane in a freshly-defeated
Japan, which MacArther was tasked with running and rebuilding after the
war: "Instantly, a mob of howling Japanese headed for him. He was
reaching for his weapon when they braked to a halt, bowed, smiled, and
offered him a cup of orangeade."

Those events occurred a few months before Trump was born, so he does not
actually "remember" any of them[. But even though Japan has been remade
since, it remains conspicuously eager to please American leaders. [In
large measure]{.mark} that is because [Japan cannot properly defend
itself]{.mark}. [After W]{.mark}orld [W]{.mark}ar [II, Japan was
demilitarized]{.mark} to prevent a repeat of the fascist militarism that
led to its brutal conquest of much of East Asia. [The U.S. oversaw
the]{.mark} adoption of a peace constitution prohibiting a [standing
military]{.mark}---Japan technically maintains modest "self-defense
forces"---and declaring that its people "forever renounce war" and "the
threat or use of force as a means of settling disputes."]{.underline}
And in the only country to experience an atomic attack, nuclear weapons
have been out of the question. Conveniently, the U.S. was happy to
station troops in the country as a way of projecting power into the
Asia-Pacific region, first as a check against the Soviet Union and more
recently against China. [[America has]{.mark} also explicitly covered
Japan with [its "nuclear umbrella," shielding it from attack with the
ultimate form of deterrence.]{.mark}]{.underline}

[[For several decades]{.mark}, the arrangement made sense for a Japan
that faced few credible military threats.]{.underline} But the 21st
century has changed past assumptions with startling speed. [[China's
explosion of growth has led to alarming new territorial claims]{.mark};
Tokyo's historic rival, which Japan raped and pillaged in the 1930s and
1940s, now has a defense budget about 10 times larger than
Japan's.]{.underline} [Meanwhile, [North Korea]{.mark}, whose state
media has
[branded](https://www.scmp.com/news/asia/article/1420583/north-korea-calls-abe-asias-maniac-hitler)
Abe an "Asian Hitler" [has developed a large nuclear arsenal]{.mark} and
ever-more sophisticated missiles, which it sometimes fires over Japan's
territory.]{.underline}

[Japan's relations with [South Korea, an important political and
economic power]{.mark}, are also at what regional experts call a 50-year
low, poisoned by an ongoing dispute over what Japan owes to forced
laborers and so-called "comfort women" during its wartime occupation of
the Korean peninsula.]{.underline} Japan was scandalized in February
when a South Korean legislator referred to Japan's then-emperor, since
succeeded by Naruhito, as the son of a war criminal. (One long-term
nightmare here: a unified, hostile Korea.) Even relations with Russia
are tense, also thanks to the legacy of World War II, in the form of a
territorial dispute over remote islands most of the world has never
heard of; a Japanese legislator was recently
[expelled](https://english.kyodonews.net/news/2019/05/efce86faea78-lawmaker-to-leave-party-over-remarks-about-possible-war-with-russia.html)
from the country's Diet after suggesting (albeit drunkenly) that war
with Russia might be necessary to reclaim them.

[In sum, Japan looks around and sees enemies and rivals that recall
brutal Japanese occupation, and too few close friends. [That leaves it
as dependent on the U.S. as it has been in years]{.mark}.]{.underline}

[At the same time, it is as worried as it's ever been about whether
America can be relied upon. In the Trump era, the U.S. has become
inscrutable, unpredictable and potentially unreliable.]{.underline}

[People here are keenly aware of [Trump's complaints about the cost of
American bases overseas and]{.mark} his [questions about long-standing
alliances]{.mark}. "We're basically protecting Japan," Trump
[said](https://www.nytimes.com/2016/03/27/us/politics/donald-trump-transcript.html)
as a candidate.]{.underline} "If we're attacked, they do not have to
come to our defense. If they're attacked, we have to come totally to
their defense. And ... that's a real problem." Trump hasn't spoken that
way in a while, but Japanese officials have watched his continued
skepticism about the costs and mission of the NATO alliance, and ongoing
complaints about the expense of maintaining U.S. troops in South Korea,
with great unease. In meetings with diplomats and military strategists,
most of whom would only speak off the record, I was told repeatedly that
a scaled back U.S. presence in Asia, perhaps as a concession in a
nuclear deal with North Korea, would be a "disaster" or "nightmare."
Never mind the 50,000 troops now stationed in Japan itself.

[Japan isn't totally defenseless without its American military
bodyguard. Thanks to China's muscle-flexing, the passage of time and
Abe's nationalistic leadership, Japan in recent years has gradually been
expanding its military's size and legal capabilities.]{.underline} Trump
officials, more than Obama ones before them, have wholeheartedly
embraced the shift, which Trump will implicitly endorse this weekend
when he visits a Japanese navy helicopter carrier set for an upgrade
that will allow it to carry advanced American-made F-35B fighter jets.

[[But Japan also needs American]{.mark} in other ways. Its diplomats
have urged the U.S. [to help mediate its dispute with South
Korea]{.mark}---though to little avail.]{.underline} ("In somewhat more
normal times," says Mike Green, a former top Asia official in the George
W. Bush White House now at the Center for Strategic and International
Studies, a big question around Trump's trip would be, "What is the
administration doing to patch up ties between our two closest allies,
whose fight is weakening our position in Asia?") Meanwhile Japan's huge
but deeply troubled economy, which struggles with slow growth and an
aging population, is highly vulnerable to Trump's whims on tariffs.

That's why it's a coup for Abe and Japan that Trump, who does not love
long trips, has made the 14-hour flight to become the first foreign
leader to meet the country's newly-enthroned emperor. In recent public
remarks, Trump has demonstrated only a vague understanding of the honor,
while boasting that Abe has assured him it will be "100 times bigger"
than the Super Bowl.

While there, Trump will award a specially-made trophy to the winner of a
national sumo wrestling championship, for which he will be given a
special chair in an area where even dignitaries typically sit on the
floor, cross-legged, reportedly to the
[annoyance](https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/asia_pacific/from-the-emperor-to-sumo-wrestling-abe-harnesses-japans-traditions-to-impress-trump/2019/05/22/3f488214-7b8f-11e9-a66c-d36e482aa873_story.html?utm_term=.c9739d5a4402)
of some of the sport's diehards. In a signal of U.S. military support,
Trump will also deliver a speech at the U.S. Navy base at Yokosuka, in
southern Japan.

Abe's flatter-Trump campaign is more than a personal whim, it is the
result of extensive analysis. "The Japanese have studied Trump as
thoroughly as any government, probably in the world, to try to
understand him, because the U.S.-Japan alliance is so critical," says
Green. But it has involved some cost at home. [During my visit, the lead
headline in the Japan Times described a "grilling" the prime minister
had received in the Diet over Trump's public claim a few days earlier
that [Abe had written]{.mark} "the most beautiful five-page letter"
nominating him to [the Nobel Prize committee for his nuclear diplomacy
with North Korean dictator Kim Jong Un]{.mark}.]{.underline} Abe
couldn't quite bring himself to confirm the notion, which seemed strange
given that the talks had made little real progress, and that Abe had
been a past skeptic of talking to Kim. "I'm not saying it's untrue," was
all he would allow. According to the Washington Post, Abe has more than
once been referred to as "poochi" in the country's left-leaning Asahi
Shimbun newspaper.

Many Japanese officials argue, though, that Abe has made the best of an
awkward situation. Trump has stopped complaining about America's
security agreement with Tokyo and---unlike the case of South
Korea---hasn't made references lately to the cost of stationing troops
and equipment in Japan. [[Abe has helped explain to Trump how important
American assets in Japan]{.mark} are to containing China; [U.S. Navy
patrols]{.mark} into [the]{.mark} contested [S]{.mark}outh
[C]{.mark}hina [S]{.mark}ea often originate from the Japan's Yokosuka
base. Although Abe wasn't able to prevent Trump from slapping tariffs on
Japanese steel and aluminum exports, he has helped to delay potential
U.S. tariffs on automobiles that Japanese officials say would create a
crisis in their relationship with Washington.]{.underline}

Still, there is a sense of real disquiet here about what may lie ahead.
One Japanese official told me that Trump is an effect, not a cause, of
eroding American public support for overseas alliances and adventurism.
Moreover, some Japanese worry that the character of the U.S. might be
changing. Japan is coming to see America "rather differently," said
Ichiro Fujisaki, a former Japanese ambassador to Washington who now
chairs the America-Japan Society in Tokyo. "The popularity of the U.S.
is decreasing," he said, as Japanese people see an erosion of "values,
respect for international institutions, and commitment to allies."

It is unclear whether Trump will know or care about such sentiments when
he greets Emperor Naruhito on Monday. But it was those values that
America spent decades instilling in Japan as the U.S. rebuilt the nation
it had conquered after World War II. It was a process that began in
earnest when the MacArthur, having arrived in Tokyo for what would be a
seven-year term as its de facto viceroy, met with Hirohito for the first
time. President Harry Truman and MacArthur had decided by then that the
emperor had to be preserved to help earn the trust of the defeated
Japanese people. But at that point, Hirohito wasn't sure that MacArthur
wouldn't have him executed. MacArthur later recalled giving Hirohito an
American cigarette, "which he took with thanks. I noticed how his hands
shook as I lighted it for him. I tried to make it as easy for him as I
could, but I knew how deep and dreadful must be his agony of
humiliation."

Trump will meets Hirohito's grandson under dramatically different
circumstances. It may be that, far from humiliation, Naruhito and Abe
will enjoy a sense of triumph at how skillfully they are playing to the
president's vanity. But something essential about the relationship
between the U.S. will be unchanged, one that will be a source of both
comfort and insecurity here for the forseeable future.

"Japan is always under the influence of the U.S.," Murara told me. "It
is always treated to be the junior partner of the U.S."

#### Aegis causes Japanese remilitarization 

**Hughes 5/2013** (Christopher W. Hughes, University of Warwick
Professor of International Relations, "Japan, Ballistic Missile Defence
and remilitarization," Science Direct,
<https://www-sciencedirect-com.dartmouth.idm.oclc.org/science/article/pii/S0265964613000258>)

Japan\'s future trajectory in security policy and the extent of
deviation from the post-war course of a constrained military stance have
been the source of constant academic and policy debate. Japanese
policy-makers have maintained that national security policy has shown no
fundamental deviation, and that this can be benchmarked against a range
of constant anti-militaristic principles. [The advent of
BMD]{.underline}, however, [poses significant questions over whether
Japan is continuing to follow a similar security
trajectory]{.underline}. This article examines how [BMD has challenged
four key anti-militaristic principles---the non-exercise of collective
self-defence, the non-military use of space, the ban on the export of
weapons technology, and strict civilian control of the
military]{.underline}---and uses this assessment to judge how [BMD is
driving remilitarisation]{.underline}. It concludes that [BMD\'s impact
is highly significant in transgressing these anti-militaristic
principles and is]{.underline} thus [indicating a more remilitarised
security path for Japan developing now and in the future.]{.underline}
Japan\'s extent of change and trajectory in its security policy, and
specifically the degree of its remilitarisation, has been a source of
major contention throughout the post-war era. Japanese
policy-makers---wrestling with the particularly difficult defence
problématique of seeking to safeguard national security against a
perceived range of increasingly complex regional and international
security challenges, whilst at the same time strongly constrained in
this effort by the need to manage associated external risks and internal
counter-pressures---have tended towards emphasising a low-profile
national security posture and denial of the language of
remilitarisation. Externally, policy-makers have remained wary of the
need not to push forward too boldly the build-up of Japan Self-Defence
Force (JSDF) capabilities in order to avoid a counter-reaction from East
Asian states fearful of Japanese remilitarisation. In addition, Japan\'s
leaders have eschewed a more proactive defence posture so as to hedge
against the risk of the US--Japan alliance and being seen as too
forthcoming militarily and becoming embroiled in US military strategy in
the Asia-Pacific. Meanwhile, internally, Japan\'s policy-makers have
been especially conscious of the need to avoid stimulating domestic
political suspicions of remilitarisation, and how domestic opposition to
changes in defence policy may be compounded by any intensification of
frictions with East Asian neighbours and rising US expectations for
Japan to expand bilateral military
cooperation.[1](https://www-sciencedirect-com.dartmouth.idm.oclc.org/science/article/pii/S0265964613000258#fn1)
Japan\'s policy-makers have thus propagated a discourse to stress above
all continuities in defence policy. This has generally been centred
around arguments that Japan has shown no essential deviation from the
foundations of its post-war national security policy which emphasise it
will never again become a 'great military power' and instead maintain an
'exclusively defence-oriented' security
posture.[2](https://www-sciencedirect-com.dartmouth.idm.oclc.org/science/article/pii/S0265964613000258#fn2)
More specifically, Japanese policy-makers have cited strict continuing
adherence to the prohibitions on the use of force derived from Article
9, or so-called 'peace clause' of the Constitution, and a range of other
anti-militaristic principles developed from the spirit of Article 9, as
evidence of essential continuities and constraints in national defence
policy and the management of the US--Japan alliance. However, ranged
against this discourse of continuity is a counter-discourse, involving
Japanese and external academics\' and policy-makers' analysis. These
point to the empirically observable and very considerable changes in the
Japan Self-Defence Forces\' (JSDF) doctrines and capabilities, combined
with developments in US--Japan alliance cooperation, and argue that
these thus indicate the growth of significant discontinuities and
remilitarisation in national security
policy.[3](https://www-sciencedirect-com.dartmouth.idm.oclc.org/science/article/pii/S0265964613000258#fn3)
Japan\'s official government commitment since the early and mid-2000s to
go beyond previous technical research and to introduce and procure
Ballistic Missile Defence (BMD) programmes has added further momentum to
the controversy over the future course of remilitarisation. The Japanese
government, as is the case in the entire gamut of national security
policy, remains insistent that BMD is fully in line with the past
precepts of defence-oriented planning and marks no deviation towards a
more remilitarised policy. BMD is held to raise no particular concerns
for domestic political or external neighbours in terms of undermining
constitutional prohibitions and anti-militaristic principles or opening
the way towards tighter US--Japan alliance cooperation beyond the
existing scope of the US--Japan security treaty. But once again ranged
against this view of BMD as reinforcing the essential status quo in
Japanese defence policy are questions about the potential
discontinuities, pointed to by the straight empirical facts [that BMD
has involved a massive redirection of Japanese defence budget resources
and a decade long effort in US--Japan alliance restructuring to
accommodate the new systems.]{.underline} The objective of this article,
given these controversies over Japan\'s remilitarisation in general and
BMD\'s potential position within this process, is to begin to make
headway in presenting an in-depth analysis of the arguments on either
side for continuities and discontinuities and how this may inform the
larger debate on remilitarisation. The vast scale of the BMD project and
the relatively short format of this article do not provide for the scope
to analyse the entirety of implications of BMD for Japan\'s national
security policy. However, in order to gain a firmer analysis of the
degree to which BMD is contributing to potential transformation in
Japan\'s security policy, this article interrogates change within those
very factors which are usually cited by Japanese policy-makers as
marking continuities in defence policy. Specifically, the analysis
focuses on the means by which BMD is acting upon the continuing solidity
of interpretations of Article 9 as prohibiting the exercise of
collective-self defence, and the three key anti-militaristic principles
of the non-military use of space, ban on the export of arms technology,
and strict civilian control of the military. [If the continuing
integrity of these anti-militaristic prohibitions and principles under
the conditions of the introduction of BMD is tested and found to be
strong or wanting, then]{.underline} clearly [this will serve as a key
set of indicators for the degree of remilitarisation triggered by this
new weapons system. In turn, by investigating the degree of continuity
or erosion of these prohibitions and principles,]{.underline} which are
presented by Japanese policy-makers as the essential underpinnings for
the entire national security policy, [this article positions itself to
comment more widely beyond BMD on the overall trajectory of Japan\'s
potential remilitarisation.]{.underline}

face-to-face meetings and phone conversations with Trump --- but has
little to show for it.

Abe is [concerned about the shifting balance of power in
Asia](https://www.eastasiaforum.org/2019/06/06/japans-awakening-to-a-multipolar-world/)
--- China's spectacular rise, the United States' relative decline, and
Japan's 'lost decades'. Another element of change is Russia's 'pivot to
the east', a reaction to its deteriorating relations with the West over
Russia's annexation of Crimea. Against this backdrop, Tokyo wants to
ensure that the United States will be a stabilising regional force.

[After gambling on Trump to help stabilise Japan's security environment
and protect its foreign policy and national security interests,
[Abe]{.mark} now [faces the]{.mark} disturbing [consequences of
Trump]{.mark}'s unpredictable and disruptive character. The Trump
administration has undergone top-level personnel changes of
unprecedented frequency.]{.underline} The very legitimacy of his
presidency is under question due to evidence of pro-Trump Russian
interference in the 2016 presidential election and the Trump
administration's attempts to obstruct justice during subsequent FBI
investigations.

[Trump's major policy decisions are equally unsettling. [Under the
banner of 'America First]{.mark}', [Washington has unilaterally
withdrawn from the T]{.mark}rans-[P]{.mark}acific [T]{.mark}rade
[P]{.mark}artnership, the Paris Climate Accord, [the]{.mark}
Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty, and the Iran nuclear deal, [as
well as renegotiating]{.mark} the [N]{.mark}orth [A]{.mark}merican
[F]{.mark}ree [T]{.mark}rade [A]{.mark}greement --- all [international
agreements supported by Tokyo]{.mark}.]{.underline}

Unilateralism also characterises [Washington's approach toward
Pyongyang](https://www.eastasiaforum.org/2019/07/01/north-korea-a-year-after-the-singapore-summit/),
one of the most pressing problems for Tokyo. Trump has held three
meetings with Kim Jong-un --- in Singapore in June 2018, Hanoi in
February 2019, and Panmunjom in June 2019 --- but the two sides remain
far apart on the core issue of denuclearisation. Abe stands alone as the
only regional leader yet to meet the North Korean leader.

Abe is also taking steps to strengthen the Japan--US security alliance.
Tokyo revised its long-established interpretation of Article 9 of its
constitution so that Japan can engage in limited forms of collective
self-defence in areas beyond Japan's homeland, and [lifted a
ban](https://www.eastasiaforum.org/2017/02/16/japanese-arms-for-sale/)
on weapons and weapons technology exports. It has also agreed to expand
purchases of US military equipment. This includes an additional 105 F-35
fighter jets, 42 of which are set to be deployed on a new aircraft
carrier. Tokyo even deployed a US-made land-based ballistic missile
defence system --- ostensibly to defend Japan from North Korean missiles
--- that triggered Chinese and Russian protests.

These decisions are clearly in line with Abe's long-held desire to
strengthen Japan's defence capabilities and play an international
security role. They are also meant to bolster Japanese defences against
China's growing military power in maritime East Asia, a goal that
underpins Japan's partnership with the United States in pursuing 'peace
and freedom in the Indo-Pacific'.

[But [Trump]{.mark} [has reportedly]{.mark} recently [mused about ending
the Japan--US security treaty, calling it an unfair]{.mark} agreement
[requiring the]{.mark} [U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates [to come to
Japan's defence but not the other way around]{.mark}. The report alarmed
and perplexed Japan, but Abe reportedly did not bring it up in his last
summit with Trump on the sidelines of the G20 in June, nor did Trump
volunteer any information on his remark.]{.underline}

[[On the trade front, the Trump administration unilaterally imposed
tariffs]{.mark} [on]{.mark} steel and aluminium imports --- unleashing a
trade war with [China]{.mark} --- [and is [pressing protectionist
demands on
Japan](https://www.eastasiaforum.org/2019/06/30/the-rules-based-economic-disorder-after-osaka-g20/)]{.mark}
and other major trading partners.]{.underline} Japan currently enjoys a
surplus of about US\$68 billion in its bilateral trade with the United
States, accounting for 7.7 per cent of the latter's total trade deficit.
China's trade surplus with the United States stands at a whopping
US\$419 billion, or 47.7 per cent of US total deficit.

Tokyo stresses that its trade surplus is declining and that Japanese
investment contributes significantly to the US economy. Japan's
investment in the United States in 2017 amounted to US\$470 billion,
second only to the UK's US\$541 billion. Japanese multinationals also
generated 861,000 jobs in the United States, again second to the UK with
1,238,000.

[[Tokyo opposes unilateral protectionist moves and]{.mark} stresses the
importance of multilateral negotiations for trade liberalisation, such
as the Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific
Partnership (CPTPP), to which Tokyo hopes Washington will eventually
return. Tokyo tried to deflect Washington's demand for bilateral trade
negotiations, but in April 2017 it [reluctantly agreed to enter into
bilateral talks]{.mark}. Japan has much to lose if these talks fail and
the United States imposes its threatened tariffs on Japanese imports and
demands further defence build-up.]{.underline}

[Trump is likely to follow his instinct for transactional victories and,
as the 2020 presidential election approaches, he will be tempted to seek
any trade victory. Washington has postponed a decision on tariffs on
Japanese automobile imports until after Japan's Upper House elections on
21 July. But regardless of the outcome of the elections, it is likely
that Trump will abandon this seemingly benevolent gesture after the
Japanese parliamentary elections. [Trump has tweeted]{.mark} that he is
[expecting his tariff threat will succeed in compelling Japan to make a
major concession, particularly on Japanese imports of US agricultural
products.]{.mark}]{.underline}

If this does happen, there is a good chance that Abe will be criticised
as a misguided leader who gambled his nation's key economic interests on
the goodwill of an unpredictable partner across the Pacific.

What can Abe do to deflect such criticism? He could argue that Japan's
concessions are similar to the compromise his government had already
made in the CPTPP. And if the LDP-led coalition achieves its expected
victory in the July elections, he can continue with no serious
challenger within his own party and ride out the criticism from the
defeated opposition. In short, despite the unpredictable politics in
Washington, Tokyo will remain a stable anchor of the bilateral alliance.

#### Us-japan relations deteriorating now -- ignorance towards north korea, economic competition and domestic opposition towards us military

President Trump and Japanese Prime Minister Abe's recent meeting in
Buenos Aires on the sidelines of the G-20 presented an image of two
allies pleased with the progress they had made. The President [praised
Japan](https://asia.nikkei.com/Politics/International-Relations/Trump-credits-Abe-for-cut-in-trade-imbalance-but-wants-more)
for reducing the bilateral trade deficit and for making significant
military acquisitions from the United States. [Yet looking ahead,
Alliance managers on both sides should be concerned about several issues
that threaten to shake up this close and critical
relationship.]{.underline}

[Most pressing is [the issue of North Korea]{.mark}. A year ago, [Tokyo
was nervous that]{.mark} President [Trump's]{.mark} previous "fire and
fury" [rhetoric could lead to a large-scale military conflict]{.mark} on
the Korean peninsula. Today--[although the potential for war has been
replaced by]{.mark} remarkable summitry, "[love
letters](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-northkorea-usa-trump/we-fell-in-love-trump-swoons-over-letters-from-north-koreas-kim-idUSKCN1MA03Q),"
and the potential for [inter-Korean peace--Tokyo is as nervous]{.mark}
as ever. This is because North Korea [continues to produce nuclear
weapons](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/aug/22/north-korea-still-developing-nuclear-weapons-iaea-report-un)
and [ballistic
missiles](https://www.nbcnews.com/news/north-korea/north-korea-still-producing-ballistic-missiles-after-summit-n896331),
and President Trump seems willing to overlook these continued violations
of international sanctions. Some of Japan's leaders believe this signals
[Washington's implicit acceptance of North Korea as a de facto nuclear
power]{.mark}, which they fear could eventually [limit the willingness
of the United States to come to the defense of Japan in a crisis with
North Korea.]{.mark}]{.underline}

Secondly, some in Tokyo are concerned that Japan may be "next" now that
negotiations to replace NAFTA with the USMCA have been concluded.
[President [Trump has made]{.mark} no secret of his [concerns
that]{.mark} [Japan's trade arrangements with the U]{.mark}nited
[S]{.mark}tates [are]{.mark} exploitative and [unfair]{.mark}, and may
now focus on Japan as the newest economic challenge to
conquer.]{.underline} While some in Tokyo have taken heart that China
seems to be captivating the president's attention for now, others fear
that the president may see Japan as a more tempting target because he
has more leverage over Tokyo than he does over Beijing. [[This is
especially true [in the automotive
market]{.mark}](https://www.cnbc.com/2018/09/07/japan-has-become-the-obvious-target-for-trumps-next-trade-salvo.html)[,]{.mark}
although Japan may be somewhat inoculated on that front because many of
its car manufacturers have factories in the United States.]{.underline}

Finally, the issue of U.S. military presence in Okinawa has the
potential to return to the fore. [Three months ago, [[Okinawa elected a
new
Governor](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/09/30/world/asia/okinawa-governor-election-us-base.html)
who opposes the large U.S. military]{.mark} footprint on the
island.]{.underline} This will complicate plans by Washington and Tokyo
to realign U.S. basing on the island, which in recent years had made
significant progress toward completion. In late February, Okinawa will
hold a referendum on the relocation of a U.S. base that is critical to
the overall realignment plan. [The referendum, if successful, will give
the new Governor an explicit mandate to oppose Tokyo and Washington.
While not legally binding, a successful referendum may diminish Tokyo's
willingness to move ahead with realignment and throw the [decades-old
realignment
plan](https://www.mofa.go.jp/region/n-america/us/security/96saco1.html)
into doubt.]{.underline}

[The Alliance with Japan is one of the United States' most valuable and
robust. Our interests and values are closely aligned, and the personal
connections between the two nations is difficult to
overestimate.]{.underline} Yet, as with any relationship, continued
success will require careful attention. Looking ahead, it would be
prudent for Alliance managers on each side to address these issues
directly and carefully before they threaten to upset the broader
relationship.

[Maintaining stable nuclear relations between China and the United
States is critical to both sides as well as the rest of the
world.]{.underline} Although current nuclear dynamics are considered
stable, there are serious risks in this domain that require cooperation
from the leaders of both countries. [China's paramount interest is to
maintain a safe, secure, and reliable second-strike nuclear capability
that can survive an adversary's disarming strike and penetrate enemy
defenses.]{.underline} This is the foundation of China's nuclear
deterrence strategy.

CHINA'S CHALLENGES IN THE NUCLEAR DOMAIN [U.S. missile defense systems
are the biggest challenge facing China's nuclear deterrent]{.underline}
for three reasons. First, the United States argues that its homeland
missile defense system is directed against North Korea, not China. But
[a U.S. missile defense system arrayed against North Korea could
undermine China's own capabilities due to proximity]{.underline}. Given
China's small intercontinental-range nuclear arsenal, [even a
small-scale U.S. missile defense system has the potential to neutralize
China's nuclear deterrent.]{.underline} Second, despite some arguments
that the current U.S. missile defense architecture is not very effective
due to the difficulty of distinguishing real warheads from decoys,
[China is concerned with the unpredictable future of missile
defense]{.underline}. The United States does not accept limits on
missile defense on the basis of a perceived need to maintain its
defensive capabilities. Despite Washington's frequent expressions of
willingness to discuss this issue with Beijing, this point remains an
area of divergence.

Third, [the expansion of U.S. missile defense, in both scale and
effectiveness, is also a concern]{.underline}. [This growth has been
evident in quantitative developments,]{.underline} such as an increase
in groundbased interceptors from 30 to 44, and qualitative improvements
in terms of effectiveness, such deployment of X-band radar in Japan and
possibly South Korea as well as the construction of a new land-based
radar in Alaska. Additionally, the United States is developing a new
"kill vehicle" capable of transmitting photographs in support of "shoot,
look, shoot" capabilities.

#### China's current nuclear modernization remains modest now -- better missile defense causes dramatic expansion of nuclear arsenals, proliferation, and reversal of the No First Use Policy

**Jones 2009** (Chris Jones, Center for Strategic and International
Studies Research Assistant, "Managing the Goldilocks Dilemma: Missile
Defense and Strategic Stability in Northeast Asia," Center for Strategic
and International Studies, Stratcom)

While "regional threats" like Iran and North Korea are cited by the
United States as the justification for long-range missile defense, the
Chinese continue to remain very concerned about the system. Both the
Bush and Obama administrations stated publicly that missile defense is
not meant to deal with China. Similarly, the BMDR tried to make clear
that China's "capability to conduct a large-scale ballistic missile
attack on the territory of the United States" is "not the focus of U.S.
BMD." Such [reassurances,]{.underline} however, [have done little to
allay Chinese fears that missile defense could undermine their
second-strike capability. China continues to deploy a relatively small
nuclear force in comparison to the United States]{.underline} and
Russia. Therefore, United States efforts to pursue missile defenses
against ICBM threats can sow significant doubts in China's mind about
the effectiveness of their second-strike capability[. According to Hui
Zhang: China continues to modernize its nuclear force in order to
maintain, and only to maintain, a reliable second-strike retaliatory
capability. Its actions are driven mainly by U.S. advances in
precision-strike weaponry and missile defenses. China's nuclear
modernization has aimed more at improving quality than quantity. The
current effort focuses mainly on enhancing the survivability of its
strategic nuclear force through greater mobility, including
deploying]{.underline} solid-fuel and road-mobile intercontinental
ballistic missiles [(ICBMs) and a new generation of ballistic missile
submarines.]{.underline} By contrast, [the size of the force has grown
quite modestly. China's plans could change significantly, however, were
the United States to deploy a more comprehensive or more operationally
successful missile defense. A significant change in China's plans could
lead them to undertake a number of qualitative and quantitative
modernization efforts to ensure the reliability of their
second-strike.]{.underline} Some [examples include building more ICBM's,
MIRVing warheads to decrease interception probably, increasing
deployment of mobile ICBM's which provide faster launch times that
complicate radar detection and tracking, and investment in
countermeasures to overwhelm the system. These efforts could also be
complimented by changes in doctrine, such as backsliding on China's
longstanding No First Use Doctrine, or diplomatic backlash
by]{.underline} increasing [unwillingness to join international
nonproliferation efforts like the Fissile Material Cutoff Treaty and the
Comprehensive Test Ban Trea]{.underline}ty. 28 These
[responses]{.underline} are not mutually exclusive and [will
be]{.underline} considered [based on China's perception of the degree to
which missile defense can undermine their second-strike
capability.]{.underline}

### 2ac at: China/Russia Deterrence

#### Aegis ashore isn't key to deterring China or Russia

Hempel June 3, 2019 (Alex Hempel, "Could American Missile Defenses
Threaten Nuclear Deterrent? Russia and China Seem to Think So"
https://whitefleet.net/2018/06/03/could-american-missile-defenses-threaten-nuclear-deterrent-russia-and-china-seem-to-think-so/
)

While military programs rarely capture the attention of the mainstream
public, North Korea's recent string of missile tests helped bring
American homeland ballistic missile defense (BMD) to the forefront.
Amidst heightened awareness of the nuclear threat, major news outlets
picked up on a number of missile-defense-related events, including the
deployment of Terminal High Altitude Area Defense (THAAD) batteries to
South Korea and the first ever interception of an intercontinental
ballistic missile by a Ground-Based Interceptor (GBI). Along with this
increased coverage came questions surrounding the effectiveness of
American BMD --- a matter tackled by publications such as [**[The New
York
Times.]{.underline}**](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/02/11/opinion/illusion-missile-defense.html) In
most cases, mainstream observers assert that homeland missile defenses
are not currently effective and probably will not be effective in the
near future. The New York Times article, for example, cites GBI's
ostensible 50% success rate and concludes that missile defenses "will
not save the country from a North Korean nuclear attack."

[Nobody denies that there are problems with current American missile
defenses. The more-ambitious systems --- namely, the GBI and the
Standard Missile 3 (SM-3) --- have less-than-perfect test records and
have not demonstrated their capabilities in combat. These are the two
systems with the largest coverage and thus the most potential for usage
against strategic weapons. Moreover, there are far too few GBIs deployed
now to seriously threaten Russian or Chinese deterrent.]{.underline}

However, it is worthwhile to consider the potential for improved
performance in the future. After all, long research and development
cycles are quite common in the defense industry, and American BMD
systems are constantly improving. Though there are a relatively few
interceptors deployed at the moment, a drastic ramp-up in production
could change the equation going forward.

The problem with assessing American BMD's potential performance is that
most of the relevant information is classified. Given limits of public
domain sources, it is worth looking at an unconventional barometer: the
actions of American adversaries. [Both Russia and China have
sophisticated intelligence agencies with analytical capabilities that
undoubtedly exceed those of independent defense analysts.]{.underline}
As such, the degree to which Russia and China are investing in
missile-defense-thwarting technologies can tell us something about how
rapidly American missile defenses are progressing and whether they may
eventually threaten strategic deterrence.

This perspective problematizes the prevailing narrative [that America's
missile defenses have no strategic significance*. *Russia and China have
recently rushed to introduce a number of novel long-range delivery
vehicles, all of which are --- in some capacity]{.underline} ---
intended to evade (or entirely negate) missile defenses. In March 2018,
Putin held a press conference and discussed a number of
"next-generation" weapons: the Avanguard hypersonic glide vehicle (HGV),
Kinzhal air-launched ballistic missile, Burevestnik nuclear-powered
cruise missile, RS-28 Sarmat heavy intercontinental ballistic missile
(ICBM), and Status-6 nuclear-powered underwater vehicle. China has also
invested in (and tested) new ICBMs and HGVs. In order to understand how
these weapons signal a fear of American missile defenses, it is worth
briefly considering their hypothetical capabilities.

The Avangaard HGV is perhaps the most important weapon unveiled by Putin
--- unlike many of the other systems discussed on March 1st, which are
novelties and may or may not see deployment, the Avangard is a feasible
weapon with American and Chinese counterparts. Hypersonic glide vehicles
are designed to replace traditional ballistic missile reentry vehicles,
which follow a ballistic trajectory and cannot perform evasive
maneuvers. HGVs, in contrast, generate aerodynamic lift and have control
surfaces, allowing them to adopt non-ballistic flight paths and maneuver
aggressively at hypersonic speeds (Putin claimed Mach 20 in his
address). Traditional missile defense systems rely on the fact that
ballistic missile warheads follow a predictable flight path,
but [**[Avangard would negate
this]{.underline}**](http://missiledefenseadvocacy.org/missile-threat-and-proliferation/missile-basics/hypersonic-missiles/) and
be essentially invulnerable to current systems.

[China, for its part, recently conducted HGV tests with its new DF-17
ballistic missile]{.underline}, [**[according to DoD intelligence
sources.]{.underline}**](https://thediplomat.com/2017/12/introducing-the-df-17-chinas-newly-tested-ballistic-missile-armed-with-a-hypersonic-glide-vehicle/) These
operational tests, which involved an HGV successfully striking its
target, demonstrate a relatively mature capability. Although the DF-17
is an intermediate-range ballistic missile, the HGV itself adds
substantial range thanks to its glide capabilities. [Moreover, it's
possible that the HGV design tested with the DF-17 could be employed
aboard ICBMs as well.]{.underline}

Russia's Kinzhal air-launched ballistic missile [**appears to be an
air-launched
derivative**](https://missilethreat.csis.org/missile/kinzhal/) of the
9K720 Iskander short-range ballistic missile, which features a
maneuverable warhead. Not only is the Kinzhal deployed from the MiG-31,
an interceptor with an impressive combat radius, but it should also
enjoy a range increase over the Iskander thanks to its higher launch
altitude and velocity. This gives the Kinzhal+MiG-31 combo a presumptive
range in excess of 2,000 km, although the duo would be vulnerable before
the Kinzhal is deployed. The weapon would excel in the anti-shipping
role, where it could help overcome advanced American defenses such as
Aegis BMD. Though Aegis BMD has successfully intercepted traditional
anti-ship cruise missiles and ballistic missiles, maneuvering hypersonic
threats such as the Kinzhal pose a unique challenge and it does not
appear that Aegis BMD has ever been tested against such a threat.

Perhaps the most unorthodox weapon discussed by Putin was the
Burevestnik nuclear-powered cruise missile. Scant details are available
on this system, which would be the first of its kind ever deployed.
Nuclear powerplants are common on large vessels such as submarines and
aircraft carriers but [**have not been particularly successful aboard
aircraft.**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear-powered_aircraft) These
past failures have been partially due to the weight of the required
shielding; of course, cruise missiles have no crewmembers, so radiation
leakage is less of a concern. Should the effort prove successful, the
resulting missile would have excellent endurance at the expense of high
costs and complexity. Since the Burevestnik's engine would release
radioactive materials upon impact, the weapon would likely be restricted
to strategic use.

The Burevestnik's main appeal is stellar survivability in the strategic
role. Whereas homeland BMD is proceeding apace, there are no plans to
create a comprehensive anti-cruise-missile network for Europe or North
America. Due to their high trajectories, ballistic missiles can be
countered by a few radars and interceptor bases. In contrast, cruise
missiles fly low and slow, complicating detection. Providing persistent
defense against a strategic cruise missile attack would require a
massive air defense network.

Even though the nuclear cruise missile would be a potent strategic
weapon, its cost-effectiveness seems dubious. The Avangard (should it
prove successful) would fulfill the same role, fly much faster, be
deployable from conventional rocketry, and would not require the
development, manufacture, and maintenance of small reactors.

Russia's [**much-hyped**](http://www.foxnews.com/tech/2018/04/26/could-insane-russian-nuclear-torpedo-cause-300-foot-tidal-waves.html) Status-6
is a long-range, nuclear-powered unmanned underwater vehicle designed to
carry a nuclear payload. Such a weapon would have several advantages
over the aerial delivery methods commonly employed for nuclear weapons.
Bombs and missiles are high-commitment weapons --- once they are
launched, they cannot be recalled. In contrast, a nuclear underwater
delivery vehicle could be maneuvered to its target and loiter there for
a considerable period, able to detonate within a moment's notice.
Alternatively, the system could be sent on patrol in the open ocean,
where survivability would be all but guaranteed in the event of a
nuclear exchange.

Like the other weapons mentioned by Putin, the Status-6 would also
bypass current and projected American missile defenses; the ports and
harbors of major American cities have no system in place to detect a
small, stealthy underwater vehicle like the Status-6 since no threat of
this nature existed previously. However, Status-6 development could pose
serious engineering challenges, as it would be the first unmanned
underwater vehicle with such formidable range and endurance. There is
also the potential that American anti-submarine assets or listening
posts could detect the system. And, of course, Status-6 would only be
useful against coastal targets.

The RS-28 Sarmat, a heavy intercontinental ballistic missile, is the
most conventional of Russia's "next-generation" weapons systems. It is
intended to replace older intercontinental ballistic missiles and will
be capable of carrying numerous multiple independently-targetable
reentry vehicles (MIRVs) and decoys. While existing missile defenses are
effective against simple targets, the high quantity of MIRVs combined
with numerous advanced decoys could thwart missile defenses by
overwhelming them with targets. Since it incorporates pre-existing
technologies and reentry vehicles, the RS-28 is certainly less risky
than the Avangard and Burevestnik but would be vulnerable to
improvements in midcourse discrimination.

[It is certainly noteworthy that all these "next-generation" weapons
touted by Putin are geared towards thwarting or avoiding
BMD.]{.underline} That Russia has relied on traditional ballistic
missiles for more than half a century but began developing a number of
unconventional delivery systems right as America made key breakthroughs
in missile defense is probably not a coincidence. In fact,
Putin [**explicitly
mentioned**](http://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-43239331) missile
defenses as the impetus for the new systems. In contrast, America's next
generation of nuclear weapons will be delivered by conventional
ballistic missiles+reentry vehicles, cruise missiles, and bombs. This is
not surprising --- militaries tend to follow the philosophy of "if it
ain't broke, don't fix it." Since Russia's missile defenses are far less
credible than those of the United States, American planners are not
concerned with the survivability of their nuclear forces.

In addition to the DF-17 and its associated HGV, China has also taken
steps to stay ahead of American missile defenses by introducing the
DF-41, a road-mobile ICBM capable of carrying MIRVs and decoys. Like the
Sarmat, the DF-41 would present missile defense radars with a large
number of potential targets, greatly complicating interception. Chinese
defense analysts have [**publicly
stated**](http://www.globaltimes.cn/content/1076058.shtml) that the
DF-41 is intended to safeguard the PRC's deterrent against strategic
missile defenses. To be sure, China's new missile systems and HGVs have
not been flaunted to the degree of Russia's new weapons systems.
Nevertheless, it does appear that the PRC is quietly incorporating
missile-defense-penetrating features into its strategic portfolio.

[In summary, it appears that both Russia and China have assessed
America's strategic BMD capabilities as a threat to their deterrence and
responded with new weapons systems.]{.underline} This contradicts the
prevailing narrative that strategic missile defense is unfeasible and a
non-starter. Even though some of the Russian systems are relatively
outlandish and may not enter service, the effort invested in developing
them to a conceptual stage is nonetheless important. Moreover, that
Russia has envisioned such a diverse array of delivery vehicles signals
to American officials that they have considered numerous ways in which
to thwart future BMD improvements. [Of course, it is possible that
Russia and China are playing it safe and developing
missile-defense-penetrating weapons out of an abundance of
caution.]{.underline} [However, even this explanation suggests a genuine
fear that American ballistic missile defenses **could **pose a strategic
threat, which is more than most missile defense naysayers would
grant.]{.underline} [Given the formidable intelligence resources of both
these American adversaries, their apparent concerns are worthy of
consideration in discussions of BMD's future.]{.underline}

President Trump is visiting Tokyo on Monday at a time of renewed
national security debates within Japan. North Korea's recent missile
launches and nuclear tests have again prompted discussion in Tokyo on
Japan's policy against becoming a nuclear state[. Although Japan has
long had the technical ability to develop nuclear weapons --- its
"nuclear hedge" --- it has refrained from doing so. Japan instead
remains firmly committed to its 1967 Three Non-Nuclear Principles of not
developing, not possessing and not introducing nuclear
weapons]{.underline}. This is not the first time that Japan has
reexamined those principles. Similar debates transpired after China's
hydrogen bomb test in 1967, the Soviet Union's deployment of
medium-range nuclear missiles in Siberia during the 1980s and North
Korea's first nuclear test in 2006. Is this time different? Reacting to
North Korea's threatening behavior, former Japanese defense minister
Shigeru Ishiba stated in September that Japan should at least debate the
decision not to permit the introduction of nuclear weapons on Japanese
territory. Ishiba implied that Tokyo should consider asking Washington
to deploy tactical nuclear weapons in Japan. Trump: \'I don\'t think
we\'ve ever been closer to Japan\' President Trump spoke to the press
after arriving in Japan and meeting with Prime Minister Shinzo Abe on
Nov. 5. (The Washington Post) [This latest debate is likely to end in
the same way as previous debates, however. Japan will continue to adhere
to its Three Non-Nuclear Principles and forswear nuclear
weapons.]{.underline} [Here are three reasons for that: [1) **Staying
non-nuclear is part of Japan's national identity:** **The Three
Non-Nuclear Principles are a clear part of Japan's national identity,
not simply a policy preference**]{.mark}. Repeated polls indicate
overwhelming popular support for the three principles in
Japan.]{.underline} [A 2014 Asahi newspaper poll revealed that support
for the principles had risen to 82 percent, compared with 78 percent in
a 1988 poll]{.underline}. Despite growing concerns about North Korea's
nuclear program and China's military power during this period, [Japanese
support for remaining non-nuclear actually increased.]{.underline} Even
after the provocative North Korean missile launches over Japan in August
and September, a Fuji News Network poll showed that nearly 80 percent of
the Japanese population remained opposed to Japan becoming a nuclear
weapons state. [And nearly 69 percent opposed having the United States
bring nuclear weapons into Japan.]{.underline} [The legacy of the
Hiroshima and Nagasaki atomic bombings leave many Japanese convinced
that their country has a moral responsibility to promote global nuclear
disarmament --- as well as to forgo nuclear weapons of its own. The 2011
Fukushima nuclear plant disaster has reinforced this view]{.underline}.
In fact, increasing numbers of Japanese believe that the U.S. "nuclear
umbrella" is unnecessary for Japanese security. A June 2010 NHK survey
revealed that 20.8 percent felt that U.S. nuclear deterrence is
necessary for Japan's security in both the present and future, while
34.8 percent believed it unnecessary. The June 2015 NHK poll showed that
only 10.3 percent thought the U.S. nuclear umbrella is necessary for
both the present and the future --- 48.9 percent responded that it is
unnecessary now and later. [[2) **Powerful players in Japanese politics
can block nuclear acquisition:**]{.underline} [In addition to public
opposition to nuclear weapons, Japan has significant "veto players" ---
crucial political or economic actors that are likely to block efforts to
develop nuclear weapons]{.underline}]{.mark}[.]{.underline} Japan has a
robust nuclear energy industry. But public acceptance of nuclear energy
in the 1950s resulted from a fundamental political bargain: nuclear
energy, but no nuclear weapons. As security scholar Jacques Hymans
argues[, the development of nuclear energy in Japan boosted the number
of Japanese government agencies and private-sector actors that are
committed to the peaceful use of nuclear power --- and can serve as a
formidable opposition to any political move toward acquiring nuclear
weapons.]{.underline} **[[These veto players include powerful economic
ministries, regulatory commissions, industrial groups and prefectural
governments]{.underline}]{.mark}**. **[The international
nonproliferation regime and public opposition to nuclear weapons give
these veto players leverage in Japan's policy process.]{.underline}**
The International Atomic Energy Agency has closely monitored Japan's
reprocessing programs, for instance[. Japan's nuclear energy program is
also tied to bilateral agreements and multilateral bodies such as the
Nuclear Suppliers Group that embody nonproliferation
principles]{.underline}. **3) Japan has good national security reasons
to stay non-nuclear:** [There's also a realist security calculation to
consider.]{.underline} North Korean nuclearization is alarming, but it
does not pose such an acute danger that Japanese leaders will be
motivated to pay the high political costs necessary to weaken, much less
revoke, the Three Non-Nuclear Principles. North Korea acquiring the
ability to deliver a nuclear weapon against the United States may weaken
the protective U.S. nuclear umbrella somewhat, but U.S. nuclear and
conventional military capabilities should be adequate to deter a North
Korean nuclear attack on Japan. North Korean test missiles flew over
northern Japan in September, prompting Japanese government alerts
telling citizens to seek shelter underground or in a building. (Courtesy
of Kate Whitcomb) During the 2016 presidential campaign, Donald Trump
criticized several U.S. alliances and mused that it might be desirable
for Japan to develop nuclear weapons. [But after assuming office,
President Trump and his foreign policy team have repeatedly confirmed
the U.S. defense commitment to Japan. **The continuing presence of U.S.
military forces in Japan, South Korea and the Western Pacific makes this
commitment credible to deter potential aggressors and to reassure
Japan**.]{.underline} **[Given the powerful U.S. nuclear arsenal,
including ballistic missiles deployed on nuclear submarines, any U.S.
tactical nuclear weapons in Japan itself would constitute a marginal
increase in deterrence]{.underline}**. But the political cost of
rescinding the third non-nuclear principle would be high. Japanese
defense policymakers are more likely to focus on other ways to respond
to the North Korea threat, such as acquiring the Aegis Ashore missile
defense system and perhaps a conventional strike capability. A realistic
review of Japanese security requirements is likely to conclude that the
best way to counter the North Korea threat is to promote defense
cooperation with the United States, invest in conventional defense
capabilities and increase pressure on North Korea --- while looking for
an opportunity for constructive negotiations with Pyongyang. And there's
a final consideration: [A Japanese bomb would probably destabilize the
country's relations with China and South Korea]{.underline}. At a time
when North Korea is making the international politics of the region
complicated, Japan is likely to stay its non-nuclear course rather than
make a disruptive nuclear move of its own.

"Developments towards detente have begun," the governor said in this
year's annual peace declaration marking the end of fighting in the
prefecture. [He said continuing to build new facilities at the US Marine
Corps' Camp Schwab in the northeast of the prefecture -- including two
runways on reclaimed land -- "goes against the present
trend".]{.underline}

[The governors of two other prefectures -- Yamaguchi, in southwest
Japan, and Akita, in the far north of the country -- expressed similar
sentiments to Itsunori Onodera, the defence minister.]{.underline}

[Both prefectures host training areas for Japan's military, face the
Korean Peninsula and have been identified as the most appropriate sites
for the deployment of Aegis missile defence systems.]{.underline}

[Tsuhumasa Muraoka, the governor of Yamaguchi, asked the minister to
provide "a more convincing explanation" of why Aegis is still required,
given the recent easing of tensions in the region.]{.underline}

Although Onodera never mentioned China as a potential threat to national
security, it is clear that Tokyo's thinking is that while the threat
posed by Pyongyang may have eased, the longer-term challenge from
Beijing has not dissipated.

"The threat from North Korea has not changed at all," Onodera told the
governor, according to Kyodo News. "North Korea has deployed several
hundred ballistic missiles capable of reaching Japan and it is very
likely that it also possesses a number of nuclear warheads."

[Jun Okumura, a political analyst at the Meiji Institute for Global
Affairs, said the governors' comments reflect the opinions of a certain
number of their constituents and are therefore
"understandable"]{.underline} -- but he added that there is no
likelihood of Tokyo stopping its plans to deploy Aegis systems.

BEIJING (Reuters) - [[China\'s top newspaper, decrying Washington as a
trouble-maker]{.mark}, said on Monday U.S. moves in the South China Sea
like last week\'s freedom of navigation operation will only cause China
to strengthen its deployments in the disputed waterway.]{.underline}

China\'s foreign ministry said the USS Hopper, a destroyer, came within
12 nautical miles of Huangyan island, which is better known as the
Scarborough Shoal and is subject to a rival claim by the Philippines, a
historic ally of the United States.

It was the latest U.S. naval operation challenging extensive Chinese
claims in the South China Sea and came even as President Donald Trump\'s
administration seeks Chinese cooperation in dealing with North Korea\'s
missile and nuclear programs.

[The ruling Communist Party\'s official People\'s Daily said in a
commentary that, with the [situation]{.mark} generally improving [in the
S]{.mark}outh [C]{.mark}hina [S]{.mark}ea, it [was clear that the

region]{.mark}.]{.underline}

\"Against this backdrop of peace and cooperation, a U.S. ship wantonly
provoking trouble is singleminded to the point of recklessness,\" the
paper said.

[\"If the relevant party once more makes trouble out of nothing and
causes tensions, then it will only cause China to reach this conclusion:
[in order to earnestly protect peace]{.mark} in the South China Sea,
[China must strengthen and speed up the building of its abilities
there]{.mark},\" it said.]{.underline}

The commentary was published under the pen name \"Zhong Sheng\", meaning
\"Voice of China\", which is often used to give the paper\'s view on
foreign policy issues.

The widely read Global Times tabloid, published by the People\'s Daily,
said in an editorial on Monday China\'s control of the South China Sea
is only growing and it is well placed to react to U.S. \"provocations\".

\"As China\'s military size and quality improve, so does its control of
the South China Sea,\" it said. \"China is able to send more naval
vessels as a response and can take steps like militarizing islands.\"

The Scarborough Shoal is located within the Philippines\' 200 nautical
mile Exclusive Economic Zone but an international tribunal in 2016 ruled
that it is a traditional fishing ground that no one country has sole
rights to exploit.

### 2ac at: Japanese Ptx - Status Of The CCP is Bad

#### **The CCP is losing legitimacy-due to corruption and domestic politics**

the Collapse of China,\" Diplomat,

Contemporary China Research Centre (NZCCRC) and Professor of Political
Science at Victoria University of Wellington.

Ever since the publication of David Shambaugh's controversial essay "The
Coming Chinese Crackup" on March 6, 2015, [China scholars have been
debating the demise of communist rule in China. Shambaugh made two basic
points in the essay: the endgame of communist rule in China has begun
and Xi Jinping's ruthless measures have accelerated the demise of the
CCP's rule in China.]{.underline} His critics hardly challenged his
first point but mostly disagreed with him on his second point. By [world
communist standards, the CCP has indeed entered its endgame. After 70
years, for instance, communist rule in the Soviet Union ended on
December 26, 1991. In six months, the Chinese Communist Party will have
ruled the People's Republic of China for 66 years. With rampant
corruption at all levels of the party and the government]{.underline}
--- where a typist has taken bribes in the amount of four million yuan
and a vice chairman of the Central Military Commission took cash bribes
weighing more than one ton --- [the CCP seems unlikely to outlive its
Soviet counterpart by a large margin.]{.underline} Nevertheless, by
Chinese dynastic standards, the CCP's rule is not in its endgame.
Instead, it might very well be in its beginning. The last dynasty, the
Qing, lasted for 267 years; by that standard, CCP rule is still in its
infancy. In 1710, 66 years into the Qing Dynasty's rule in China, the
country was at its peak as a prosperous and powerful nation under the
wise leadership of Emperor Kangxi. The dynasty would last another 200
years. As a ruling dynasty, the CCP has had a mixed record so far.
[While it is true that the CCP under Mao Zedong unified most of the
country, Mao's policies did not make China more prosperous and stronger.
Tens of millions perished in the aftermath of the Great Leap Forward,
and the entire population suffered during the decade-long power
struggles of the Cultural Revolution.]{.underline} Deng Xiaoping
heralded a new era of economic prosperity, but his GDP-oriented policies
have severely strained China's environmental capacities. China witnessed
the best performance in terms of economic growth in the decade from 2002
to 2012 under the leadership of Hu Jintao. [Yet corruption and
environmental degradation worsened in the same period]{.underline}, in
spite of Hu's signature slogan of a "scientific outlook on development."
In the past two and a half years, Xi Jinping's leadership has been long
on anti-corruption campaigns but short on anti-pollution efforts. One
hundred officials at the rank of vice minister and above have been
investigated for corruption, but there is no sign that the central
leadership is taking environmental issues more seriously. A series of
new leading small groups have been created to manage national security,
internet issues, reforms, and military modernization, but no central
leading small group on environmental protection has been set up. Given
these mixed results, Xi Jinping could very likely be the last ruler in
China as a communist. Yet he could also start another new era of
prosperity and strength as a new emperor of the CCP Dynasty. Whether the
People's Republic of China will end up like the Soviet Union or follow
the footsteps of Manchus on its way to international prominence will
depend on what this new leadership will do (or will not do) in the next
seven years.

["The endgame of Chinese communist rule has now begun,"]{.underline}

think." Is the ruling China's Communist Party (CCP) on the brink of
collapse? We asked several China hands for their take: Trending Articles
Assad Hasn't Won Anything After years of bloody warfare, it's time to
recognize what the Syrian dictator rules over: a chronically violent
and... Powered By Ho-fung Hung, Associate Professor of Sociology, Johns
Hopkins University: I agree with Shambaugh that [there are serious
cracks in the CCP regime, not only because of his arguments and evidence
but also because of his deep knowledge about and long-time access to the
party's elite.]{.underline} Whether these cracks will lead to the end of
CCP rule, nevertheless, is difficult to predict. The prediction about a
CCP endgame this time might end up like the many unrealized predictions
before. It may also be like the story of boy crying wolf: The wolf
didn't come the first two times, but it finally came when nobody
believed it would come. The bottom line is, the CCP is facing very tough
challenges. Whether and how it can weather them is uncertain. [Xi is a
leader who came to power with very few sources of legitimacy. Mao and
Deng were among the founding fathers of the People's Republic of China.
Deng handpicked his successors Jiang Zemin and Hu Jintao --- both of
whom got the backing of party elders when they came to
power]{.underline}. Xi, despite his princeling background, is the first
leader chosen out of a delicate compromise among party factions. Amidst
Xi's rise to power, the mysterious Wang Lijun incident occurred,
followed by the unusual downfalls of former top leaders Bo Xilai and
Zhou Yongkang. What Wang actually told the American diplomats during his
sleepover in the U.S. Consulate in Chengdu, and what sensitive
information he eventually conveyed to Beijing is still unknown. B[ut the
rumor that he revealed a plot by other princelings to get rid of Xi
through a coup does not sound too crazy. If this is true, then Xi's
frenetic purge of other factions in his anti-corruption campaign makes
sense as a desperate move to whip the disrespectful elite to submission
through creating a culture of terror within the Party. Xi's purges
surely make new enemies and make most of the Party elite feel deeply
anxious about their fortunes. It won't be so surprising if some of those
anxious elite conspire to depose Xi.]{.underline} Such internal coup
against unpopular leaders is not alien to the CCP --- it happened with
the downfall of the Gang of Four in 1976, and former party chairman Hua
Guofeng a few years later[. Second, the party's internal rift is
unfolding at the worst possible time, as far as the economy is
concerned]{.underline}. Yes, a 7.4 percent annual growth rate is an
enviable number to many other emerging economies. But with the soaring
indebtedness of the Chinese economy and the ever aggravating
unemployment problem, the Chinese economy needs higher-speed growth to
stay above water. The debt hangover of the 2008-09 stimulus is worrying.
China's debt to GDP ratio jumped from 147 percent in 2008 to 282 percent
now, and is still growing. It is at a dangerously high level compared to
other emerging economies. The economic slowdown will lead to profit
decline for companies and revenue shortfall for local governments,
increasing their difficulty in servicing and repaying debts. A vicious
cycle of defaults and further growth deceleration could turn a slowdown
into something uglier.A vicious cycle of defaults and further growth
deceleration could turn a slowdown into something uglier. It is possible
that the CCP elite, no matter how much they dislike Xi and his
anti-corruption campaign, will still prefer not to rock the boat. They
are aware that they are nobody without the protection of the
party-state, and their privileges will be under far greater threat in
the wake of a regime collapse. It is also possible that in the years of
pacification and domestication following the 1989 Tiananmen Square
crackdown, China's civil society and dissidents have become so timid and
cornered that they are incapable of taking advantage of any cracks in
the regime. Is Xi successfully increasing his grip of power through the
anti-corruption campaign, or does his rule still suffer from inadequate
legitimacy behind the mask of invincibility? Only time can tell. But
besides the endgame of CCP rule, we should also ponder another possible
scenario: the rise of a hysteric and suffocating dictatorial regime
which maintains its draconian control over a society gradually losing
its dynamism. Perhaps we can call this hypothetical regime North Korea
lite. Arthur Kroeber, Editor, China Economic Quarterly: Neither China
nor its Communist Party is cracking up. I have three reasons for this
judgment. First, none of the factors Shambaugh cites strongly supports
the crackup case. Second, the balance of evidence suggests that Xi's
government is not weak and desperate, but forceful and adaptable. Third,
the forces that might push for systemic political change are far weaker
than the party. Shambaugh thinks the system is on its last legs because
rich people are moving assets abroad, Xi is cracking down on the media
and academia, officials look bored in meetings, corruption is rife, and
the economy is at an impasse. This is not a persuasive case. True, many
rich Chinese are moving money abroad, both to find safe havens and to
diversify their portfolios as China's growth slows. But in aggregate,
capital outflows are modest, and plenty of rich Chinese are still
investing in their own economy. Following an easing of rules, new
private business registrations rose 45 percent in 2014 --- scarcely a
sign that the entrepreneurial class has given up hope. The crackdown on
free expression and civil society is deeply distressing, but not
necessarily a sign of weakness. It could equally be seen as an assertion
of confidence in the success of China's authoritarian-capitalist model,
and a rejection of the idea that China needs to make concessions to
liberal-democratic ideas to keep on going. It is also related to the
crackdown on corruption, which Shambaugh wrongly dismisses as a cynical
power play. Corruption at the end of the era of Xi's predecessor Hu
Jintao had got out of control, and posed a real risk of bringing down
the regime. A relentless drive to limit corruption was essential to
stabilize the system, and this is precisely what Xi has delivered.A
relentless drive to limit corruption was essential to stabilize the
system, and this is precisely what Xi has delivered. It cannot work
unless Xi can demonstrate complete control over all aspects of the
political system, including ideology. As for the economy and the reform
program, it is first worth pointing out that despite its severe
slowdown, China's economy continues to grow faster than that of any
other major country in the world. And claims that the reform program is
sputtering simply do not square with the facts. 2014 saw the start of a
crucial program to revamp the fiscal system, which led to the start of
restructuring local government debt; first steps to liberalize the
one-child policy and the hukou, or household registration system
(discussed for years but never achieved by previous governments);
important changes in energy pricing; and linkage of the Shanghai and
Hong Kong stock markets. News reports suggest that we will soon see a
program to reorganize big SOEs under Temasek-like holding companies that
will focus on improving their flagging financial returns. These are all
material achievements and compare favorably to, for instance, the utter
failure of Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe to progress on any of the
reform agenda he outlined for his country two years ago. Finally, there
is no evidence that the biggest and most important political
constituency in China --- the rising urban bourgeoisie --- has much
interest in changing the system. In my conversations with members of
this class, I hear many complaints, but more generally a satisfaction
with the material progress China has made in the last two decades.
Except for a tiny group of brave dissidents, this group in general
displays little interest in political reform and none in democracy. One
reason may be that they find uninspiring the record of democratic
governance in other big Asian countries, such as India. More important
is probably the fear that in a representative system, the interests of
the urban bourgeoisie (at most 25 percent of the population) would lose
out to those of the rural masses. The party may well be somewhat
insecure, but the only force that might plausibly unseat it is more
insecure still.The party may well be somewhat insecure, but the only
force that might plausibly unseat it is more insecure still. Predictions
of Chinese political collapse have a long and futile history. Their
persistent failure stems from a basic conceptual fault. Instead of
facing the Chinese system on its own terms and understanding why it
works --- which could create insights into why it might stop working ---
critics judge the system against what they would like it to be, and find
it wanting. This embeds an assumption of fragility that makes every
societal problem look like an existential crisis. As a long-term
resident of China, I would love the government to become more open,
pluralistic and tolerant of creativity. That it refuses to do so is
disappointing to me and many others, but offers no grounds for a
judgment of its weakness. Seven years ago, in his excellent book China's
Communist Party: Atrophy and Adaptation, Shambaugh described the Party
as "a reasonably strong and resilient institution.... To be sure, it has
its problems and challenges, but none present the real possibility of
systemic collapse." That was a good judgment then, and it remains a good
judgment now. Howard French, Associate Professor, Columbia Journalism
School: With respect to Shambaugh, what has interested me most in this
matter is the response to what amounts to a carefully hedged
prognostication, rather than his specific arguments in and of
themselves. It has been fascinating to watch what strikes this observer,
at least, as a certain betrayal of anxiety in the efforts of some of
those who have rushed to take Shambaugh down, or at least refute and
discredit his arguments. The notes have ranged from "how dare he?" to
"who does this person think he is?" to, in some of the more breathless
reactions, attacks on his motives: he is a pawn --- or at least an
unwitting agent of this or that occult force. Along the way, Shambaugh's
good faith has been questioned; he becomes an actor on behalf of
America, or the West, which is said to be always trying bring China
down, or cast its political and economic model in doubt. (This extends,
of course, to the limited Chinese responses we have seen so far, such as
that of the Global Times, which has responded with vilification,
forgetting perhaps that for decades a cherished recurrent theme in
Chinese propaganda has been the fundamentally flawed nature of Western
democracy or capitalism, and, of course, its inevitable demise.) Before
getting down to details, perhaps the first thing to be said is that it
is impossible to appreciate Shambaugh's perspective without
understanding where he comes from. Few among the first wave of critics
credited him for his scholarship, other than to note that he is
prominent or respected within the academy. Few have explored the actual
nature of his work over the years, or the findings he has made in
previous writings, such as the 2008 book China's Communist Party:
Atrophy and Adaptation, a careful study of how the party responded to
the shock of the fall of the Soviet Union and began reinventing itself.
Shambaugh gives enormous credit to the CCP for these efforts, but it is
clear that by the time he published his 2013 book, China Goes Global:
The Partial Power, he had concluded that we have overestimated China's
strengths and underestimated its weaknesses. This is all worth spelling
out because even if Shambaugh's "crackup" theory surprised you, it has
clearly not come out of thin air; rather, it is the latest wrinkle in
the evolving views of an earnest scholar. Perhaps the next most
important point to be made --- and it has not been heard enough in this
discussion --- is that no one knows where China (or the world) is
heading 20, or even 10, years down the road. Mao oversaw rapprochement
with the United States in order to counter the Soviet Union, and this
can be said to have brought capitalism to his country, which was clearly
not his aim. Former paramount leader Deng Xiaoping embraced capitalism,
and that can be said to have led to a near existential crisis for the
party around the issue of democratization. The United States embraced
China also in order to balance the Soviet Union, as well as, a bit
later, to seek markets. This ended up creating what now appears ever
more like a peer rival, after a brief period of unipolarity. Unintended,
even undesirable consequences are the name of the game in matters of
state and in international affairs, and however assertive and determined
Xi may appear to us in the early phases of his rule, it is a safe bet
that his drive to realize a Chinese dream will produce many things he
could never have dreamed of---or desired. It is also at least plausible
that Xi's remarkable apparent confidence is a kind of compensation for
deep anxiety at the top in China: a recognition that the country is
walking a tightrope. I defer to others on the specifics of China's known
challenges, but a few points seem fairly obvious. The early, and one
might say easy, phase of China's takeoff is over.The early, and one
might say easy, phase of China's takeoff is over. That period consisted
in large measure of stopping doing stupid things and inflicting damage
on oneself. Moving forward now from here becomes exponentially more
difficult. This means finding a way to sustain relatively high growth
rates, when almost everything points to a natural, secular slowdown. It
means coping with environmental challenges on a scale never seen before.
It means dealing with the emergence of a middle class, and everything
that political science suggests about the difficulties that this poses
for authoritarian regimes. It means finding a way through the
middle-income trap. It means restraining corruption that is, if
anything, even worse, meaning more systemic, than commonly recognized.
It means coping with the accelerating balancing of nervous neighbors. It
means coping with issues of ethnic and regional tensions and stark
inequality. It means drastic and mostly unfavorable changes in
demography. And it means doing all of these things, and facing any
number of other serious challenges that space doesn't allow one to
detail here, without the benefit of a coherent or appealing ideology
other than nationalism and, tentatively, budding personality cult-style
leadership. We don't know how this is going to turn out. For every
success one can point to involving China, it is easy to point to at
least one stark and serious problem, or potential failing. I don't share
Shambaugh's confidence in predicting the demise of the party, but it
does not strike this reader as a reckless prediction. It should not
surprise us, and neither should its opposite, China's continued relative
success. Such is the degree of uncertainty we must all live with.
Suisheng Zhao, Professor, University of Denver: Yes, the CCP regime is
in crisis. But it has muddled through one crisis after another,
including the catastrophes of the chaotic, decade-long Cultural
Revolution and the 1989 Tiananmen crackdown, by tackling its symptoms.
It is too difficult to predict the arrival of the cracking up moment
now. This current crisis comes after more than three decades of
market-oriented economic reform under one-party rule, which has produced
a corruptive brand of state capitalism in which power and money ally.
The government officials and senior managers in state-owned enterprises
(SOEs) have formed strong and exclusive interest groups to pursue
economic gains. China ranks among the countries of the highest income
inequality in the world at a time when China has dismantled its social
welfare state, leaving hundreds of millions of citizens without any or
adequate provision of healthcare, unemployment insurance, and a variety
of other social services. Meanwhile, China has become one of the world's
most polluted countries. The crisis has worsened as China's economic
growth is slowing. As the worsening economic, social, and environmental
problems cause deep discontent across society and lead many people to
take to the streets in protest, China has entered a period of deepening
social tensions. Apparently, Beijing is frightened and has relied more
and more on coercive forces. The cracking up moment could come when
economic growth has significantly slowed, and Beijing is unable to
sustain the regime's legitimacy with its economic performance. While
scholars such as Shambaugh are warning of this cracking up, President Xi
Jinping is likely aware of the danger of possible collapse and has been
trying to prevent it from happening. Opposite from the prescription by
liberal scholars and Western leaders, Xi has seen that the key to
keeping the CCP in power is to further empower the authoritarian state
led by the Communist Party, reflecting the long struggle of the Chinese
political elites in building and maintaining a powerful state to lead
China's modernization. China scholar Lucian Pye famously observed that
China suffered a "crisis of authority" --- a deep craving for the
decisive power of effective authority ever since the 19th-century
collapse of the Chinese empire. Chinese elite attributed China's modern
decline partially to the weakening of the state authority. The authority
crisis called for the creation of an authoritarian state through
revolution and nationalism.The authority crisis called for the creation
of an authoritarian state through revolution and nationalism. The
Chinese communist revolution was a collective assertion for the new form
of authority and a strong state to build a prosperous Chinese nation.
The very essence of CCP legitimacy was partly based upon its ability to
establish a powerful state as an organizing and mobilizing force to
defend the national independence and launch modernization programs. To
rectify his predecessors' overemphasis on the transformation of China
through reforms that weakened the state's authority and the CCP central
leadership, Xi has made concentrated efforts to over-empower the
authoritarian state. Repeatedly warning against "Westernization," Xi
emphasizes a unified national ideal of the "China Dream" and has allowed
the security/propaganda axis to tighten up controls on expression of
different political ideologies and opinions. Taking strong measures to
strengthen central Party and government authority, he set up new and
powerful small leadership groups, such as the Central National Security
Commission and the Comprehensive Deepening Economic Reform Small Group,
with himself as the head. Looking to Mao for inspiration to manage the
country, he launched the largest rectification and mass line campaigns
in decades to fight corruption. Describing Mao as "a great figure who
changed the face of the nation and led the Chinese people to a new
destiny," Xi has emerged as a champion of the party-state power, with
himself at the top as a strongman. Whether or not empowering the
authoritarian state is a long-term solution to the current crisis, it
seems to have targeted some of its symptoms and temporarily silenced its
liberal critics inside China. As a result, it may help postpone the
arrival of a cracking up moment --- at least for now.

System,\" No Publication,

Jeffrey W. Hornung is a political scientist at the nonprofit,
nonpartisan RAND Corporation

[[The discussion in Japan about the]{.mark} proposed [Aegis Ashore
missile system has not been going well for the government]{.mark}. It
may be a sensitive subject, but there are good reasons the government
may want to be steady and firm in its approach. [The government\'s plan
is to install the Aegis Ashore system in]{.mark} the [Akita and
Yamaguchi]{.mark} prefectures.]{.underline} The objective is to
strengthen Japan\'s defenses against North Korean missiles, be they
nuclear or conventional. The initial idea was to have the system become
operable by fiscal year 2023[. Yet, [over the past few weeks, many
debates have stalled forward movement]{.mark} on the entire plan. [One
concerns cost]{.mark}]{.underline}[. Although [the government said it
will cost 80 billion yen per unit, taxpayers are concerned the costs
will snowball in the coming years, especially as these are U.S.-made
systems.]{.underline}]{.mark} One is rationale. [[Both leadership and
residents]{.mark} in these prefectures [want to know why their
prefectures were chosen]{.mark}.]{.underline} [[Another is
health.]{.mark} Many [residents in the areas close to proposed
deployment sites have]{.mark} voiced [concerns over the system\'s
radar]{.mark}. Their concern is that [the strong radio waves from that
radar could be harmful]{.mark}.]{.underline} These concerns are natural.
As a democracy, [[it is the responsibility of the government to explain
the necessity of the cost, explain the rationale for sites, and
demonstrate the safety of the radar, or move it to an area where there
are no humans within range]{.underline}]{.mark}. And [it is the
responsibility of the government to gain their acceptance, or suffer the
consequences at the next election.]{.underline} [[A fourth
concern]{.mark} that sits apart from these [can]{.mark} best [be called
emotional]{.mark}, and one that the government needs to counter more
effectively.]{.underline} Both residents and [[politician]{.mark}s
i]{.underline}n the [Diet [have questioned the need for the system given
the continuing détente on the Korean Peninsula. For them, as tensions
continue to ease on the Peninsula, there is a reduced necessity for the
system]{.mark}]{.underline}. This concern is rash because the ballistic
missile threat from North Korea has not dissipated[. While Pyongyang
made several vague promises to Seoul and Washington, it has made no
concrete moves to abandon its nuclear or missile programs. For Japan,
the threat that it faced prior to this year\'s summitry remains the
same.]{.underline} Until evidence is obtained of Pyongyang undertaking
complete, verifiable and irreversible dismantlement of its nuclear
program, as well as its missile program, the system remains a crucial
addition to Japan\'s defense. [For nearly 20 years, Japan has used the
North Korea threat as a legitimate rationale to build its missile
defense system and cooperate closely with the U.S. in its
development.]{.underline} This argument remains as true today as it did
before the flurry of regional diplomacy began earlier this year. Japan
can still benefit from a reinforced missile shield vis-à-vis North
Korea. [At a time when Japanese defense planners are considering the
full spectrum of threats facing Japan and revising Japan\'s national
defense program guidelines and mid-term defense plan, it is imperative
to keep sight of the most immediate threat.]{.underline} Although there
is a current lull in missile launches and bellicose rhetoric from North
Korea, the North Korean threat remains unchanged. While it is tempting
to hope for the current trend of North Korean behavior to continue,
until concrete steps are taken by Pyongyang to demonstrate it is no
longer a threat to its neighbors, Japanese leaders must consider all the
possible means to defend Japan from the North Korean threat, including
the Aegis Ashore system.

### 1ar at: Japanese Ptx ext - Public Opposition to Aegis

#### Aegis costs taxpayers a lot, destroys regional relations, and people dislike it

**Asahai, 18** -- (The Asahi Shimbun is one of the five national
newspapers in Japan Rising costs fuel doubts about Aegis Ashore plan's
efficacy, <http://www.asahi.com/ajw/articles/AJ201808020045.html>) NL

[The government clearly needs to reconsider]{.underline} its plan to
introduce [the [Aegis Ashore]{.mark} land-based missile defense
system]{.underline}. First of all, [the two Aegis Ashore
[installations]{.mark} in Japan [would buck the trend of easing tensions
in the region]{.mark}. There are [also]{.mark} serious [doubts about the
cost-effectiveness]{.mark} of the system]{.underline}. The Defense
Ministry has said [[the]{.mark} missile intercepting [system will cost
1.7 times the initial estimate]{.mark}]{.underline} mainly because of
its decision to select Lockheed Martin's most advanced radar. [One Aegis
Ashore unit will cost 134 billion yen (\$1.2 billion), instead of the
originally estimated 80 billion]{.underline} yen, according to the
ministry. The government plans to deploy the anti-ballistic missile
system in Akita and Yamaguchi prefectures. [The total cost]{.underline}
of installing and operating two Aegis Ashore units [will be 466.4
billion yen]{.underline} over 30 years, the ministry said. [But [the
figure does not include]{.mark} the [costs to build]{.mark}]{.underline}
necessary infrastructure, including [[land development,
or]{.underline}]{.mark} to purchase [[missiles]{.mark} priced at tens of
billions of yen each]{.underline}. Simply put, [[the amount of taxpayer
money]{.mark} used for the system [will increase]{.mark}]{.underline}.
The ministry plans to secure funds for the plan in its budget request
for the fiscal year that starts in April. But the ministry should not
assume that the costly plan is already set to go. The prices of weapons
Japan buys from the United States often soar from the initial estimates.
This is more likely now because U.S. President Donald Trump is pressing
Tokyo to buy huge amounts of American-made weapons to cut Japan's trade
surplus with the United States. [When it decided to introduce the Aegis
Ashore system]{.underline} at the end of last year, [the government
tried to justify the decision by describing North Korea's nuclear arms
and missile programs as "a grave and urgent threat]{.underline} in a new
stage." [But the security situation in East Asia has since entered a new
phase following]{.underline} such events as [the inter-Korea summit
and]{.underline} the [historic meeting between Trump and North Korean
leader Kim Jong Un.]{.underline} The Japanese government itself has
responded to the changing situation by suspending evacuation drills for
citizens to prepare for North Korea's missile strikes and removing
surface-to-air Patriot Advanced Capability-3 (PAC-3) missile
intercepting units deployed in Hokkaido and four western prefectures.
Defense Minister Itsunori Onodera still claims the security threat posed
by North Korea "has remained unchanged." [The [rigid adherence to the
plan]{.mark}]{.underline} crafted last year [will not likely
[win]{.mark} broad [public support]{.mark}.]{.underline} Prime Minister
Shinzo Abe's administration has been stressing the threat posed to
Japan's security by Pyongyang's weapons programs. But it is believed
that the real purpose of enhancing Japan's defense capabilities is to
counter China's military expansion. If Tokyo provides radar information
about ballistic missiles flying toward the United States, Japan will
inevitably play a role in the defense of the U.S. mainland. [The
government needs to make a tough-minded analysis of the Aegis Ashore
program's potential impact on Japan's relations with neighboring
countries]{.underline}. In Akita and Yamaguchi prefectures, which have
been chosen as the candidates to host the system, [[local criticism is
growing]{.mark} about the government's rush to implement the
plan]{.underline}. The government hopes to start operating the Aegis
launch pads in fiscal 2023, but the start of operations is now expected
to be pushed back to fiscal 2025 or later, partly due to reasons on the
U.S. side. [There are [concerns that]{.mark} the [Aegis]{.mark} Ashore
units [will]{.mark} end up as white elephants [cost]{.mark}ing Japanese
[taxpayers enormous amounts of money]{.mark}.]{.underline}

#### Aegis is facing massive local opposition

**Johnston, 18** -- (12/11/18, Eric Johnston has worked as a journalist
in Japan for more than two decades. Currently a full-time reporter
at The Japan Times, the country\'s oldest and most prestigous
English-language newspaper, his beat includes local news, features on
Japanese politics and society, and U.S.-Japan issues. Japan\'s two Aegis
Ashore anti-missile candidate sites run into local opposition
<https://www.japantimes.co.jp/news/2018/12/11/national/japans-two-aegis-ashore-anti-missile-candidate-sites-run-local-opposition/#.XSaP6-hKjIW>­­)

But [[the designated site]{.mark} in the city of Akita [is only hundreds
of meters from schools and homes, and]{.mark} close to downtown. The
choice of location [has sparked local anger and opposition]{.mark}, even
among those who say they aren't automatically opposed in principle ---
just not in their backyard, please.]{.underline} The central government
is looking at the Ground Self-Defense Force's Araya training area, about
3 km from the Akita Prefectural Government offices and 5 km from Akita
Station. The potential site for the other Aegis Ashore unit is the GSDF
Mutsumi training area in Hagi, Yamaguchi Prefecture. In its 2018 white
paper, the Defense Ministry explained the need for Aegis Ashore by
saying it will fundamentally boost Japan's ability to protect itself
"seamlessly" at all times, something more difficult with ship-based
Aegis systems. "The working environment for the crew onboard an
Aegis-equipped destroyer is extremely severe. These ships must make port
calls for maintenance and replenishment, creating gaps in defense
posture. This means frequent long-term deployments for the crew to
eliminate these undesired intervals. This burden on personnel is
anticipated to be lifted significantly once Aegis Ashore is deployed,"
the white paper states. "The upcoming introduction of the land-based
Aegis system, Aegis Ashore, will enable our forces to intercept missiles
in the upper tier not just from Aegis destroyers but also from land," it
adds. The United States and Japan are also jointly developing advanced
interceptor missiles called the Standard Missile-3 Block IIA, which will
have a better ability to take out launched missiles earlier than the
ones currently in use. Plans call for eight Japanese Aegis-equipped
destroyers with ballistic missile defense capabilities, including the
SM-3 Block IIA type. The systems are scheduled for deployment in fiscal
2021 and the aim is to also deploy them at Aegis Ashore sites. In
September, the Defense Ministry released its fiscal 2019 budget request,
which included procurement of two Aegis Ashore units at a cost of ¥123.7
billion each. In October, [[site surveys]{.mark} in Yamaguchi and Akita
[began, even as local opposition toughened]{.mark}]{.underline}. In
Akita, [[concerns about]{.mark} Aegis Ashore start with the question of
why the central government is looking at [a site lying within a city
of]{.mark} about [308,000 people]{.mark}. Sixteen resident associations
from the neighborhoods right beside the Araya area, representing about
13,000 people, have all voiced their formal opposition.]{.underline} One
resident, Shoichi Kosaka, lives just 300 meters from the Araya compound.
Driving through quiet residential streets within sight of the border
fence, he expressed some specific concerns. "[[Medical evacuation
flights are very important]{.mark} to Akita]{.underline}, given its
elderly population. But [[if the Aegis Ashore system is built]{.mark}
here, [there will be limits]{.mark} on flights]{.underline} around the
area. Of course, [people may move away]{.underline} as well, [because
who wants to live beside an Aegis Ashore installation]{.underline}?" he
said. Kozo Kazama, who leads a local group opposed to the Aegis plan,
also questioned the candidate site. "Why the Defense Ministry chose
Araya as a site for Aegis Ashore is a mystery. Unlike the other
candidate site in Yamaguchi, which is located away from a major urban
center, [Araya is in a major city]{.underline}," Kazama said. "[[There
are so many concerns about]{.mark} the [effects]{.mark}]{.underline} of
the radar [[on both electronic devices]{.mark} in the area and on
[stress levels, as well as]{.mark} all sorts of [security concerns
related to the presence of missiles]{.mark} so close to so many
people."]{.underline} [Local politicians were also apparently taken by
surprise]{.underline} at the central government's decision to consider
an Aegis Ashore unit in their backyard.

Last week, Japan's minister of defense, [[Takeshi Iwaya, apologized to
the governor of Yamaguchi]{.mark} prefecture [for how poorly the central
government handled justifying the selection of Hagi city as a candidate
site for the deployment of one of two land-based Aegis Ashore
systems]{.mark}]{.underline}. Hagi city is one of two cities, along with
Akita city in Akita prefecture, named as candidate sites[. [At the heart
of the matter is the revelation of mistakes in the geographical survey
conducted to select the prefecture as a site for
deployment]{.mark}.]{.underline} [[There was a discrepancy in the
Ministry of Defense's data]{.mark}, which was based on data taken from
Google Earth, and data from the government's Geopolitical Information
Authority of Japan]{.underline}. Iwaya had also apologized to the
governor of Akita [prefecture [in mid-June for erroneous data in
explanation materials presented to justify the selection of Akita
city]{.underline}]{.mark}[. The survey mistake itself may not be fatal
to deploying the Aegis Ashore system to the locale -- the Ministry of
Defense (MOD) was off by about 2 meters, and [the mistakes were
systematically biased toward making it more difficult to select the
given site]{.mark} (the MOD's data made the mountains appear steeper
than they were, and high mountains can block the radio waves emitted by
the radar of the missile defense system)]{.underline}. [What is
problematic is the fact [that a mistake occurred at all -- that this
faulty data was presented as trustworthy]{.underline}]{.mark}.
[[Earning]{.mark} the local [residents' trust]{.mark} and understanding
[was already a]{.mark}n impossibly [difficult task; the central
government's mistakes]{.mark} [in]{.mark} marshaling [evidence]{.mark}
to explain the site selection [only increases the
difficulty]{.mark}]{.underline}. Local residents in Hagi city, Abu city
(neighboring Hagi city), and [[Akita city have been opposed]{.mark}
since the sites were named as candidates in June 2018 [due to possible
health concerns and fears about becoming a target of North Korean
attack]{.mark}.]{.underline} They want to know why their cities were
selected to host the Aegis systems. It is politically impossible for the
MOD to answer that these cities were selected for convenience, because
the Ground Self-Defense Force (GSDF) already owns land there, the
Mutsumi training area in Yamagata and the Araya training area in Akita.
However[, as local opposition ramps up, it may be time for the
government to consider alternative locations, even if it means
purchasing new land]{.underline}[. [A new field survey to collect
accurate data is unlikely to cool the opposition once trust in the
central government has been lost]{.underline}]{.mark}[.]{.underline}
[The decision to deploy the system was made hastily [by Prime Minister
Shinzo Abe in December 2017, partly in reaction to increasing tension
with North Korea as Pyongyang increased]{.underline} ]{.mark}[the tempo
of its [missile tests]{.mark}, [and partly due to U.S. President Donald
Trump's pressure to "Buy American.]{.mark}"]{.underline} While the costs
may have been grossly underestimated, the decision itself is a
strategically sound decision, and one that [the Abe administration
should stick to, even as a superficial diplomatic détente descends on
the Korean Peninsula. As Jeffrey Hornung argued almost a year ago: Japan
can still benefit from a reinforced missile shield vis-à-vis North
Korea. ... While it is tempting to hope for the current trend of North
Korean behavior to continue, until concrete steps are taken by Pyongyang
to demonstrate it is not longer a threat to its neighbors]{.underline},
Japanese leaders must consider all the possible means to defend Japan
from the North Korean threat, including the Aegis Ashore system. Despite
the summit pageantry of this spring, his warning still holds true.
Though originally scheduled for deployment in 2023, with existing
delays, the Aegis Ashore system will likely not be operational until
2024 or even later.

### 2ac at: Japanese Ptx - Xi's Ambitions Dictate Japanese Ptx

#### Chinese internal politics controlled by Xi -- trying to avoiding conflict 

**Palmer** 2-26-**18** (James Palmer, senior editor at Foreign Policy,
"China's Stability Myth Is Dead", Foreign Policy,
<https://foreignpolicy.com/2018/02/26/chinas-stability-myth-is-dead/>)

[The announcement on Sunday that China would abolish the two-term limit
for the presidency, effectively foreshadowing current leader **Xi
Jinping's likely status as president for life**, had been predicted ever
since Xi failed to nominate a clear successor at last October's
Communist Party Congress.]{.underline} But it still came as a shock in a
country where the collective leadership established under Deng Xiaoping
in the 1980s was once considered inviolable. Xi, like every leader since
Deng, combines a trinity of roles that embody the three pillars of power
in China: party chairman, president, and head of the Central Military
Commission. But like every leader since Deng, he was once expected to
hand these over after his appointed decade, letting one generation of
leadership pass smoothly on to the next.

[It's virtually impossible to gauge public opinion in China, especially
as censorship has gripped ever tighter online]{.underline}. But among
Chinese I know, including those used to defending China's system, the
move caused dismay and a fair amount of gallows humor involving
references to "Emperor Pooh" and "West Korea."

U.S. President Donald Trump's electoral victory in 2016 similarly
prompted rounds of reflection about and criticism of American democracy.
But the Chinese case merits significantly more alarm. For all the
erosion of norms under Trump, he seems unlikely, despite the fears of
some, to fundamentally change the way the United States is governed.
[Xi, meanwhile, appears to have entirely transformed Chinese politics
from collective autocracy to what's looking increasingly like one-man
rule.]{.underline} This switch should leave everyone very worried, both
inside and outside China. [A country that once seemed to be clumsily
lurching toward new freedoms has regressed sharply into full-blown
dictatorship --- of a kind that's likely to lead to dangerous and
unfixable mistakes.]{.underline}

[The Chinese Constitution itself is a largely meaningless document,
promising as it does freedom of speech, freedom of religion, and
personal privacy.]{.underline} Amendments are frequent, proposed by a
committee of "experts" and rubber-stamped by the National People's
Congress, China's annual --- and equally meaningless --- parliament.
[Brave efforts to give the constitution genuine significance were
crushed, as with any other attempt to curtail party power, in the early
years of Xi's rule.]{.underline}

[But the most recent change signals something far deeper than the
party's primacy over the law; it spotlights the essential instability of
the entire political system. For the last two decades, defenders of
China have pointed to collective leadership and the smooth succession
from one leader to another as signs that the country had solved the
problem that bedeviled other autocracies such as the Soviet
Union.]{.underline} The new leadership was established five years in
advance of taking power, allowing strong continuity without the upsets
of elections. The handover of power from Hu Jintao to Xi was considered
a model of good rule, without the hangovers and struggles that continued
for several years after Jiang Zemin reluctantly passed power to Hu in
2002.

Perhaps the system was always doomed, as soon as a cunning enough leader
emerged --- though Xi was not only skilled but lucky, utilizing the fall
of his likely rival Bo Xilai to consolidate his own supremacy. [There
will be a certain grim amusement in watching intellectual apparatchiks
scuttle to explain how their previous arguments in favor of collective
rule have been superseded by the needs of the times and that strongman
rule is now the only answer.]{.underline} As the New York Times's Chris
Buckley pointed out, Hu Angang, a regular and vocal apologist for the
government, made collective rule the centerpiece of his book on the
superiority of the Chinese political system --- published in 2013, just
after Xi's initial ascension.

[One of the surest signs of the change has been the intensity of
propaganda in service of Xi in the last two years.]{.underline} This
contrasts with the lackluster treatment of Hu, his predecessor, who was
praised only pro forma. Xi's virtues, meanwhile, are talked up in public
at every chance, not just by state media but by businesses, local
governments, and celebrities, all of whose continued prosperity depends
on signaling their ability to follow the leader. [Xi-ism is inescapable;
in Tianjin this Lunar New Year, the traditional, sweetly cheesy floral
zodiac display was replaced with praise for the Chinese
leader.]{.underline}

Errors in depicting Xi, meanwhile, are harshly punished. Chinese media
haven't quite reached the level of Romanian media under Nicolae
Ceausescu's dictatorship, where newspapers employed people whose only
job was to ensure that Ceausescu's name was never misprinted --- but
editors in China now assiduously double-screen every reference to make
sure that each title is correct and no character out of place for fear
of heavy fines and internal punishments. A TV host harmlessly
mispronouncing the "ping" of Jinping resulted in footage of the incident
being purged from the Chinese internet.

[The end of collective leadership at the top, meanwhile, has been
mirrored by the destruction of channels of dissent and disagreement
throughout the country]{.underline}. The most obvious form of this is
the gigantic crackdown on media and the internet. Arguments that were
permissible in 2009 became impossible to make in newspapers by 2014:
that China could learn from other countries; that political reform was
possible; that pluralism, civil society, and adherence to the law were
good things.

[Investigative journalism, once tentatively permitted as long as it
confined itself to local corruption, was massively
curtailed.]{.underline} The relatively freewheeling atmosphere of Weibo,
a Chinese Twitter-alike, was destroyed. It [was replaced with private
WeChat groups, only to see a crackdown on those last fall, with the
administrators of groups threatened with imprisonment for any
"anti-party" speech]{.underline}. A mildly insulting reference to Xi in
a group message won the sender two years in jail while the lawyer who
defended him in court was struck off the rolls. [Universities once saw
some degree of open debate; today absolute ideological rigidity is
demanded.]{.underline}

But the destruction of platforms for open discussion has been matched
with an equal but much harder to discern crushing of channels for
dissent inside the party and government. Even internal documents are
prefaced with the singing of praises for Xi. [The intensity of the
political purges initiated by Xi under the guise of anti-corruption
efforts has silenced officials, even behind the doors of their offices,
for fear of giving ammunition to their rivals.]{.underline}

China's official news agency, Xinhua, has always produced both open copy
--- for propaganda purposes --- and internal reports distributed at
different levels of the hierarchy. These were increasingly candid the
more limited their intended readership. In the last few years, however,
they've become far more cautious, self-censoring even for an internal
audience, according to both provincial officials and Xinhua reporters.
The Chinese equivalent of the U.S. State Department's "dissent channel"
in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, whereby even relatively low-ranking
diplomats were able to send reports directly to the minister, was
shuttered in 2013.

[This bodes poorly for China's decision-making both domestically and
internationally. The previous system was brutal, repressive, and corrupt
--- but it also saw reforms, both political and economic, that made
lives better.]{.underline} Most critically, it avoided unforced errors.
At home, there was no repeat of the sweeping ideological madness of
Maoism; changes were introduced slowly and carefully, tested at the
local and provincial levels before becoming national policy. [Abroad,
China has avoided the waste and blood of foreign wars ever since the
disastrous and brief invasion of Vietnam in 1979, a record of peace that
the United States and Russia can only dream of.]{.underline}

The public record of China's internal decision-making in those decades
is pitifully scanty. But collective rule, and the ability to debate
within the party and to sometimes listen to outside voices, undoubtedly
played a powerful role. With power now concentrated in a single man, and
with nobody willing to challenge him, the likelihood of calamitous
mistakes has soared. The first great disaster of the Xi era may have
already begun; the carceral archipelago of Tibet and Xinjiang could
easily metastasize into the rest of the country in ways that would, at
best, hamstring economic growth and cripple intellectual development.

And the fear that has silenced so many voices in Chinese society will
keep spreading. During Lunar New Year this month, traditional fireworks
were banned from Beijing --- even down to the firecrackers thrown
joyfully by small children. By itself, that could be passed off as a
legitimate health and safety measure. But such was the worry about
public gatherings that there were not even any organized displays of
fireworks. For the first time in decades, the sky over China's capital
as spring arrived was dead, black, and silent.

[Much of the debate during the period of maximum pressure and " fire and

from using his nuclear weapons against the United States and his allies.
That debate was hardly satisfactory, given the fact that a weaponized
ICBM was a new development that requires new thinking about what
deterrence meant. But what we do know is that [[Kim cannot be deterred
from proliferating]{.underline}]{.mark}. [[The U]{.mark}nited
[S]{.mark}tates [lost a chance to establish]{.mark} such [a deterrent
when it let Israel strike the Syrian reactor]{.mark}, rather than doing
so itself.]{.underline}

[The only strategies short of regime change that have a chance at
stemming the tide of proliferation are maximum pressure, which continues
to focus on all proliferation front companies, threat reduction through
reinvigorating programs like the Proliferation Security Initiative, and
diplomacy]{.underline} that hinges on collectively working with other
countries to stop treating North Korea like a normal country when its
embassies and diplomatic pouches have been used for proliferation
purposes.

The Trump administration went further than previous administrations in
assembling a global-pressure campaign that, if it were allowed to
continue on, could have resulted in the collapse of Kim. Trump also went
further than any president with his personal diplomacy. The
administration is thus on firm ground return to an amplified version of
maximum pressure, global threat reduction, and the general weakening of
Kim[. It gave peace a chance and learned that [Kim will not give up his

#### NATO will inevitably check Russia -- unified action is the most important factor

**Garamone 7/18** (Jim Garamone, reporter at the United States
Department of Defense, "Secretary General Cites NATO Unity as
Alliance\'s Best Deterrent," July 18, 2019,
https://www.defense.gov/explore/story/Article/1909715/secretary-general-cites-nato-unity-as-alliances-best-deterrent/)///JP

[Unity is the most effective arrow in NATO\'s quiver]{.underline},
alliance Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg told NBC's Courtney Kube at
the Aspen Security Forum.

[Countering Russia dominated last night\'s discussion at the Colorado
forum]{.underline}, but the alliance chief also talked about NATO in
Afghanistan and the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty.

[The secretary general said the alliance is preparing for a world with
no INF Treaty and a world with more Russian missiles.]{.underline}
Russia has until Aug. 2 to come into compliance with the treaty, which
was signed between the United States and the Soviet Union in 1987.
Russia has deployed SSC-8 missiles that violate the terms of the treaty,
and all alliance nations are prepared to respond.

[\"We will respond,\" Stoltenberg said. \"It will be measured. It will
be coordinated.]{.underline} We will not mirror what Russia is doing ---
meaning we will not deploy missile defense. [We have increased readiness
of forces, and we will also support new initiatives.\"]{.underline}

The bottom line, he said, is the alliance must deliver credible
deterrence and defense from NATO, because that is the best guarantee of
peace in Europe.

The abrogation of the INF Treaty is just one piece of Russian
malfeasance. In addition to annexing Crimea from Ukraine, occupying
provinces of Georgia and sparking conflict in the Dombass region of
Ukraine, Russia has modernized its nuclear arsenal over a long period of
time. 

[NATO has responded. For the first time in NATO history, there are
combat-ready troops in the eastern part of the alliance --- Estonia,
Latvia, Lithuania, Poland, Bulgaria and Romania]{.underline}. \"These
battalions are not very big, but [they are multinational NATO troops,
meaning that NATO is already there,\"]{.underline} the secretary general
said. [\"If any of these countries are attacked, there is no doubt that
it will trigger the response from the full alliance]{.underline}. And
[we also increased the readiness of our forces to reinforce if needed.
In a way, NATO has already started to respond in a measured, defensive
way.\"]{.underline}

[The \"one for all, all for one\" nature of the alliance is key to
deterrence]{.underline}, he said. [\"As long as that is credible --- if
you attack one ally, the whole alliance will respond]{.underline} ---
[then we are by far the strongest alliance in the
world]{.underline},\" he said. \"We are 50 percent of the world\'s
military might[. We are stronger than any other potential adversary so
long as we stay together]{.underline}. [The most important thing is the
resolve, the political will, the unity of the alliance]{.underline}. As
long as that is in place, then we are safe.\"

The problem is not deterring an actual attack. Russia is involved in
cyberattacks, meddling in elections, the chemical agent attack in Great
Britain, and more. \"These hybrid attacks blur the line between peace
and war,\" he said. 

NATO is truly a North Atlantic organization, Stoltenberg said, noting
that [the only time the alliance\'s Article 5 provision was triggered
--- the article states that an attack on one ally is an attack on all
--- was in response to an attack on the United States.]{.underline} \"I
think [everyone expected that Article 5 was for, you know, Soviet Union
attacking a small NATO ally,\"]{.underline} he said. [\"That never
happened, because deterrence worked]{.underline}.\"

[With the 9/11 attacks, all NATO allies stood behind the United States
and joined in the operations in Afghanistan]{.underline}. NATO went in
with the United States and will come out with the United States, the
secretary general said.

\"[Hundreds of thousands of European soldiers and Canadian soldiers have
served in Afghanistan]{.underline} and more than a thousand have paid
the ultimate price,\" Stoltenberg said. \"We had --- at the peak --- we
had more than 140,000 troops there in the combat operation. Roughly one
third \... of those soldiers were non-U.S. soldiers. So this has been a
big operation, not only for the United States, but for many NATO allies
and partners. Therefore, we will decide on the future presence in
Afghanistan together.\"

[The secretary general said NATO is good for Europe, but it is also
extremely good for the United States. \"It is extremely good to have
friends and allies,\"]{.underline} he said. [\"You are privileged to
have 28 friends and allies who are together with you.]{.underline} Every
time. Not only triggering Article 5 after 9/11, but [if you compare with
China or Russia or any other great power, they don\'t have \[those\]
kinds of friends and allies as you have.]{.underline} That makes you
stronger.\"

He noted that many in the United States are concerned about China. \"If
you\'re concerned about the size of China, then you should stay in NATO,
because as long as you are in NATO, you are terribly big,\" he said.
\"If you add all the other allies, [we are 50 percent of world \[gross
domestic product\] and 50 percent of the world\'s military
might.\"]{.underline}

Stoltenberg said it is easy to be concerned about the world situation,
but \"[we should also be a bit optimistic, because despite all these
attempts to weaken NATO, NATO is not weak]{.underline}.\"

Opinion [polls in Europe and North America show tremendous support for
the alliance]{.underline}, he said. \"[Those who are trying to undermine
the public support for NATO have not succeeded]{.underline},\" he added.

### 2ac at Russia Deterrence -- link turn

#### AEGIS Ashore allows Russian hardliners justify remilitarization

**Fedasiuk '18** (Ryan Fedasiuk, research intern with the Aerospace
Security Project at CSIS, undergraduate senior studying International
Relations and Russian, "U.S. Missile Defense and the Theater-Strategic
Nexus", Center for Strategic and International Studies, October 17^th^,
2018,
https://www.csis.org/npfp/us-missile-defense-and-theater-strategic-nexus)

The Pentagon would be wrong to assume it can selectively counter Russian
missile threats in Europe.

[The United States is signaling a willingness to compete with its
near-peer rivals in the realm of missile defense. Leaks about the
forthcoming Missile Defense Review indicate the Pentagon is looking to
counter burgeoning threats from Russia and China "in regional theaters
such as Europe and Asia," but not strategic threats to the U.S.
homeland.1]{.underline} There is consensus in Washington that it would
be impossible to defend against the entire arsenal of Russian strategic
weapons, because Russia can field warheads and decoys "at dramatically
less cost than the United States can add missile defense interceptors."2
[So instead, the Pentagon is aiming to defend NATO forces in Eastern
Europe that are vulnerable to Russian ballistic and cruise missile
attacks without further fueling a competition for nuclear supremacy. 3
To accomplish this, the Missile Defense Agency (MDA) may expand the role
of Aegis Ashore to include homeland missile defense against
intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBMs),4 deliver THAAD missile
batteries to Germany,5 or deploy PAC-3 interceptors in Lithuania and
Estonia.6]{.underline}

[But any decision to explicitly counter Russian and Chinese missiles
would be a substantial break from past policy.]{.underline} Even after
withdrawing from the Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty in 2002, Washington's
ambitions to establish missile defenses were tempered by concerns over
strategic stability. MDA's most challenging mission has been to prove
the merit of U.S. systems to patrons in Congress while also downplaying
their capabilities to foreign ministries in Russia and China. The
contortions reached a climax in 2007 when MDA was tasked with proving to
Russian defense agencies that proposed Aegis Ashore systems could not
intercept Russian ICBMs flying over the polar ice cap.7 In 2013, MDA
even scrapped the fourth phase of its European missile defense plan,
which would have developed an interceptor capable of chasing Russian
ICBMs.8 But all signs indicate that the forthcoming Missile Defense
Review will direct the Pentagon to abandon its policy of assuaging
Russia and China.9

[Russia has long protested U.S. missile defenses for two reasons: First,
Russians argue that missile defense is destabilizing because it
undermines mutual vulnerability afforded by nuclear weapons.10 Although
Russians agree that their full arsenal would overcome most missile
defense deployments, they worry that a U.S. first strike could eliminate
enough of their capabilities that missile defenses would be sufficient
to deal with what is left---thus obviating Russia's ability to
retaliate. Second, some Russians are convinced that the launchers in
U.S. theater missile defense (TMD) systems can be repurposed to launch
offensive weapons capable of threatening Russian troops or even Moscow
itself.11]{.underline} But many in the West have come to see Russian
concerns as disingenuous. [Despite U.S. assurances that theater defenses
cannot neutralize the Russian strategic deterrent nor launch offensive
missiles, Moscow asserts otherwise and uses this as justification to
build advanced strategic weapons.12 Because of Russia's apparent willful
ignorance, many in the Trump administration have come to believe that
crying foul is part of a broader Russian strategy to abandon the
Eurasian arms control framework.13]{.underline}

Ultimately the authenticity of Russian concerns over missile defense is
neither clear nor relevant to U.S. strategy. [The larger problem is that
Russians, willfully or accidentally, have cultivated a disproportionate
and deep-seated fear that conflates all forms of U.S. air and missile
defense.]{.underline} In March 2018, Russian Deputy Defense Minister
Alexander Fomin accused the United States of "encircling Russia with 400
anti-ballistic missile systems," which "significantly diminish the
potential of Russia's nuclear deterrent."14 Claims like this erroneously
transform the myriad of U.S. missile defenses into a highly-capable
monolith. [Russians' mental homogenization of U.S. missile defenses is
important because it neuters any strategy predicated on the idea of
escalation control.]{.underline}

But the forthcoming Missile Defense Review fails to account for this
theater-strategic nexus in missile defense. [In its new mission to
counter Russian missile systems in Europe, the Pentagon assumes that it
can selectively battle and win an arms race at the theater
level.]{.underline} But history has repeatedly shown---from the
development of the strategic cruise missile15 to the breakdown of the
SALT II agreement---that the politics governing theater missile defenses
and nuclear-capable ICBMs are inextricably bound.16 [Defending against
one kind of weapon necessarily alters the significance of and strategy
surrounding the other. Conversely, if an adversary fails to distinguish
between theater and strategic weapon posturing, as Russia does, conflict
can easily breach the nuclear threshold.17]{.underline}

The regional-strategic nexus is made possible mainly because Russian
media rarely distinguishes between the capabilities of different U.S.
missile defenses. Although the ranges and roles of U.S. missile defense
systems vary drastically, from 20-km point defenses to 2,500-km regional
shields, most news articles and statements from the Russian government
do not discriminate between the two. Russian media almost always refer
to a "US global missile defense system," which the Russian Foreign
Ministry calls "a dangerous global project aimed at establishing
omnipresent and overwhelming US military superiority."18

The White House has in turn lambasted Russia for building "destabilizing
weapons systems . . . in direct violation of its treaty obligations,"
but there is no reason to believe that Russia will cease weapons
development in response to expanding U.S. TMD.19 [In fact, expanding and
repurposing TMD only vindicates Russian concerns about U.S. missile
defense, which threatens U.S. national security in two
ways.]{.underline}

[First, doubling down on TMD makes it much easier for the Russian
defense industry to justify building even more strategic weapons.
Russian]{.underline} and U.S. sources have assessed that many of
Russia's new strategic weapons unveiled on March 1 are "nowhere near"
ready for deployment, and that the threat of their development may be
used as a bargaining chip to negotiate with the United States. 20
[Expanding TMD declines the gambit, ensuring Russia funnels more
resources into threatening strategic capabilities---exactly what the
Pentagon had hoped to avoid.]{.underline}

The Pentagon should tread carefully, lest it invites Russia to develop
strategic weapons it has no method or intention of countering.

[Second, expanding TMD would contradict U.S. efforts to bring Russia
back into compliance with the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces (INF)
Treaty, a cornerstone arms control agreement.]{.underline} The Trump
administration's INF strategy is based on coercing Moscow to the
negotiating table through economic, diplomatic, and military measures.
However, expanding TMD imperils negotiations in two ways. For one, the
entire point of a strategy based on coercive diplomacy is to change the
behavior of an adversary. In this case, the prerequisite for behavior
change is to rekindle dialogue. Vindicating Russian concerns over
missile defense only strengthens anti-American resolve and eliminates
any incentive to negotiate by convincing Russian defense hawks that they
are right not to trust the United States. Second, expanding TMD removes
the most valuable chit from the negotiating table. [Next to sanctions,
U.S. missile defenses in Europe are probably the top foreign policy
concern of the Russian Federation. Refusing to negotiate their
deployment outright removes the incentive to negotiate on other
important national security issues like the INF Treaty, Syria, or
chemical weapons.]{.underline}

Rather than expand TMD in Europe at the expense of homeland security,
the Pentagon ought to invest more in left-of-launch capabilities like
cyber and electronic warfare, which are just as credible but less
escalatory. Alternative defenses for NATO could include incorporating
more U.S. troops in the tripwire force, threatening additional force
deployments, or improving civilian resilience in the Baltics.21 All of
these actions would successfully contest Russian forces in Eastern
Europe without forcing a strategic arms race. But as it stands, the
planned strategy of forsaking arms control in the name of coercive
diplomacy is bound to backfire. The Pentagon should tread carefully,
lest it invites Russia to develop strategic weapons it has no method or
intention of countering.

the road-mobile Yars (SS-27 Mod 2) and the Sarmat (SS-30), which is

building eight new Borei-class ballistic missile submarines (SSBNs),
modernizing its aging fleet of strategic TU-160 and TU-95 bombers, and
deploying a new nuclear-armed cruise missile, the KH-101. In addition to
aforementioned systems, [the 2018 NPR notes that Russia is also

Aspen, United States [- NATO is preparing for a world without a key
nuclear arms control treaty and with more Russian missiles, the
alliance\'s secretary-general has said.]{.underline}

Jens Stoltenberg\'s comments on Wednesday at the opening of the annual
Aspen Security Forum came just weeks before an August 2 deadline the
United States has given to Russia to come back into compliance with the
Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces (INF) treaty.

Washington said in February it would suspend in six months its
participation in the Cold War-era treaty unless Moscow destroyed a new
missile system, which the US and its NATO allies alleges violates the
accord. Russia denied the accusation and also gave notice that it would
pull out of the 1987 treaty, which banned all ground-based missiles with
ranges between 500km and 5,500km.

Stoltenberg said Russia still had time to save what he called
the \"cornerstone of arms control in Europe\", adding that NATO had been
calling the government of Russian President Vladimir Putin to move back
into compliance. He noted, however, that there was no indication that
Moscow was doing anything towards that direction.

\"Now Russia has started deploying these missiles again,\" referring
to the SSC-8 ground-launched cruise missiles. \"They are mobile, hard to
detect, can reach all European cities within minutes reducing the
warning time,\" Stoltenberg added.

[If Russia does not come into compliance by the deadline, Stoltenberg
said NATO will respond in a \"measured\" and \"coordinated\" manner,
with no bilateral actions.]{.underline}

He added [NATO\'s 29 members would not deploy missile defence systems
but could strengthen the integrated air and missile defence already in
place in Europe.]{.underline}

The [thinking reflected in the plan unveiled]{.underline} Thursday is
[that 30 years of modest investment in defensive technologies has gotten
us to a point where we might be able to defeat a small, unsophisticated
attack by countries like North Korea]{.underline}. If, for example, the
U.S. constructs a defensive system with two layers of interceptors that
attacking missiles must penetrate, and each layer is 80% effective, then
in theory only one in 25 attacking warheads will reach their intended
targets. North Korea probably doesn't have that many warheads, and at
the moment it can't fit them on long-range missiles anyway. [In the case
of Russia, though, there are over a thousand nuclear warheads aimed at
America, and that's not even counting all the shorter-range nuclear
weapons that might be used to attack our allies and overseas troops.
Nothing in the current U.S. defensive arsenal, or likely to be built in
the near future, could cope with an attack on that scale. Even a few
dozen incoming warheads would overwhelm the existing]{.underline}
"ground-based midcourse [defense" system]{.underline}, given the
penetration aids and other features of a sophisticated attack. Like the
Reagan plan, the Pentagon plan unveiled Thursday envisions space-based
sensors and interceptor systems might improve the "cost-exchange"
calculus between offense and defense, but that would take a decade or
longer to implement.

**Drug prices won't pass -- low chance in the Senate**

News,
https://khn.org/news/gop-senators-distance-themselves-from-grassley-and-trumps-efforts-to-cut-drug-prices//DeepStateSisco

The fight between policymaker's intent on lowering prescription drug
prices and the drug makers who keep raising them intensified Thursday,
as [a slew of Republican senators threatened to side with manufacturers
against legislation supported by their own committee chairman and
president.]{.underline}

After months of closed-door meetings and high-profile hearings, the
Senate Finance Committee voted 19-9 to advance legislation introduced by
Sens. Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa) and Ron Wyden (D-Ore.) to rein in drug
costs in the Medicare and Medicaid programs.

[But even some Republicans who supported it warned they may not back the
sweeping package of proposals in a full Senate vote]{.underline}. They
object in particular to a provision that would cap drug prices paid by
Medicare based on the rate of inflation.

[Other obstacles have piled up]{.underline}. Wyden announced that
[Democrats, who provided most of the bill's support in committee, would
not allow a Senate vote without the Republicans agreeing to hold votes
on cementing insurance protections for people with preexisting
conditions.]{.underline} Democrats have complained for months that GOP
efforts to kill the Affordable Care Act will leave people with these
medical problems without any recourse to get affordable health care.
Democrats also want to empower federal health officials to negotiate
drug prices.

Here are the three major problems revealed in Thursday's hearing.

[Many Senate Republicans disagree with President Donald Trump about how
to lower drug prices.]{.underline}

Some of Trump's efforts to reduce Americans' drug costs took a beating
Thursday. They were criticized --- by members of his own party --- for
putting too much power in the hands of government.

Despite urging from White House and federal health officials to support
the legislation, [13 of the committee's 15 Republicans voted to remove
its controversial proposal to prevent drug prices from rising faster
than inflation under Medicare.]{.underline} Their attempt failed,
barely.

Medicaid already uses this strategy, requiring drug makers to pay the
government a rebate if the prices it pays outpace inflation, and
Medicaid tends to pay lower prices on drugs than Medicare. The HHS
inspector general has said Medicare could collect billions of dollars
from the drug industry if it did the same. But many Republicans strongly
oppose any government interference in private markets or price setting.

Sen. Patrick Toomey (R-Pa.), who introduced the amendment to remove the
proposal, said it wasn't necessary because seniors would be protected
from paying too much by another proposal in the bill to cap
out-of-pocket expenses.

["It's my view that we should not use this sledgehammer of a universal
price control, imported from Medicaid, to deal with that relatively
narrow problem and to disrupt a program that's working very
well,"]{.underline} Toomey said, mentioning Medicare's popularity.

Grassley said the inflation caps would help relieve taxpayers from
covering Medicare's skyrocketing drug costs.

And having played a key role in 2003 creating Medicare's prescription
drug program, called Medicare Part D, he took issue with the idea that
his latest bill would harm the program: "I wrote it, so you ought to
know that I want to protect it," Grassley said.

[Most of the Republicans also backed an amendment to block a proposal
being considered by the Trump administration to tie drug prices here to
those paid in other developed nations]{.underline}, which narrowly
failed. While Grassley said he, too, opposes the administration's
proposal, he did not want the issue to hold up his own bill and so voted
against the amendment.

[Grassley also said he is not comfortable with empowering federal health
officials to negotiate drug prices]{.underline}, as Wyden said he would
like to see considered. But Grassley noted that the issue isn't going
away: Trump campaigned on the idea, which White House officials have
been discussing with House Democratic leaders as part of a plan expected
to be released in September.

But that may not be enough, [Grassley suggested: "I don't think that
you're going to get 60 votes in the United States Senate."]{.underline}

### 2ac: china security strategy assumptions good

#### Our analysis of China's deterrent strategy is useful and necessary in this instance based on a political and ideological history of Chinese modernization policy.

Answers to these questions about China's nuclear posture are important
for several reasons. First, [China's behavior highlights an important
gap in structural realist approaches to international
politics]{.underline}.2 On the one hand, [structural realism arguably is
indeterminate and has few clear predictions about variation in the
nuclear strategies and forces that states adopt, as such questions lie
beyond the scope of the theory]{.underline}. On the other hand, given
the assumption of security maximization and Kenneth Waltz's
socialization mechanism, [a structural realist might expect states
to]{.underline} highly [prize the credibility of their nuclear
deterrent, especially when faced with more powerful nuclear opponents
that pose a clear threat to national survival, the basic goal of states
in all structural theories]{.underline}.3 Although [China engaged in
security competition with the United States and the Soviet Union during
the Cold War, it never sought to match their nuclear capabilities or
strategies,]{.underline} even partially, [despite possessing enough
fissile material with which to build a larger, more capable
arsenal.4]{.underline}

Second, [examination of China's willingness to endure real nuclear
vulnerability for several decades can illuminate the sources of Chinese
thinking about nuclear weapons and deterrence.]{.underline} [Such
analysis is critical because China is substantially altering its nuclear
force structure]{.underline} with the recent deployment---for the first
time---of road-mobile intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM) systems
and the pending deployment of a nuclear-powered ballistic missile
submarine force, both of [which will increase the number of warheads
capable of striking the United States]{.underline}. These changes raise
important questions: some scholars and analysts argue that China may be
moving toward nuclear war-fighting strategies and a major increase in
the size of its arsenal;5 others emphasize the challenge that these new
forces may pose to crisis stability.6 We argue that [the notion of
assured retaliation,]{.underline} or deterring an adversary with the
threat of unacceptable damage through a retaliatory nuclear strike[,
offers a useful framework for understanding the evolution of China's
nuclear strategy and force structure.]{.underline}

In the literature on China's nuclear weapons, however, [few scholars
have explored the origins of Chinese beliefs about the roles and
missions of nuclear weapons and, as a consequence, the drivers of
nuclear force development]{.underline}. One line of inquiry examines
China's decision to acquire nuclear weapons, including the seminal works
by Alice Hsieh as well as John Lewis and Xue Litai on the history of
China's strategic weapons programs.7 Another line of inquiry probes how
best to characterize China's nuclear strategy. Much of the [debate
revolves around whether China pursues either minimum deterrence or
limited deterrence]{.underline}.8 Minimum deterrence refers to
"threatening the lowest level of damage necessary to prevent attack,
with the fewest number of nuclear weapons possible."9 Similarly, limited
deterrence "requires a limited war-ªghting capability to inºict costly
damage on the adversary at every rung on the escalation ladder, thus
denying the adversary victory in a nuclear war."10 The mainstream view
remains that minimum deterrence best captures the essence of China's
approach.11 Finally, [other]{.underline} [scholars argue that China has
adopted a distinctively Chinese approach heavily influenced by China's
strategic tradition associated with Sun Zi and traditional strategic
thought]{.underline}.12

[Conclusions about China's approach to nuclear strategy are often
grounded in assessments of China's force structure, not in Chinese
beliefs or authoritative military writings about the contribution of
nuclear weapons to deterrence]{.underline}. In a 2007 study, for
example, Jeffrey [Lewis claims that China possesses a unique view of
deterrence in which Chinese leaders believe that deterrence is a
relatively easy objective that can be achieved with few nuclear
weapons]{.underline}.13 [The basis for Lewis's argument]{.underline},
however, i[s not the beliefs and attitudes of Chinese leaders and
strategists. Instead, he infers this strategic preference]{.underline}
from the small size of China's force, writing that "Chinese policy
makers have tended to make decisions about China's strategic forces that
suggest a widespread belief that deterrence is achieved early and with a
small number of forces."14

We offer two explanations for the slow pace and shallow trajectory in
the development of China's nuclear strategy and forces until the
mid-1990s. The first explanation is ideational. [The views and beliefs
of China's top leaders, mainly Mao Zedong and Deng Xiaoping, had a
consistently dominant influence on Chinese nuclear
strategy]{.underline}. The salience of their views continued well after
their deaths in 1976 and 1997, respectively. [Both leaders viewed
nuclear weapons,]{.underline} primarily and probably exclusively[, as
tools for deterring nuclear aggression and countering coercion, not as
weapons to be used in combat to accomplish discrete military
objectives]{.underline}. Both leaders [embraced the idea of deterrence
through assured retaliation]{.underline}, in which a small number of
survivable weapons would be enough to retaliate and impose unacceptable
damage on an adversary, even if the concepts of survivability and
unacceptable damage were left undefined for decades.15 No evidence
exists that either Mao or Deng possessed views on the operational
requirements of credible deterrence vis-à-vis China's potential
adversaries. [One important implication of these beliefs is that the
concept of assured retaliation, not minimum deterrence, best captures
China's approach to nuclear weapons.]{.underline}

Our second explanation points to multiple organizational and political
constraints on the ability of the People's Liberation Army (PLA) to
develop nuclear strategy and an associated operational doctrine. [As a
result of the Cultural Revolution]{.underline} (1966--76), [the
PLA]{.underline} for two decades after testing its first weapon lacked
the experience and the expertise to do so; the military [began to
formulate its nuclear strategy and operational doctrine only in the
mid-1980s, with the further advances coming in the 1990s]{.underline}.
Also, Chin[a's political environment was not conducive to such work on
strategy and doctrine.]{.underline} [Nuclear issues were treated with
intense secrecy]{.underline}, limiting knowledge of them and, thus,
opportunities for interagency deliberations. [Party-led civil-military
relations in China and the strength of the Chinese Communist Party (CCP)
meant that Mao's and Deng's views on military strategy, including
nuclear weapons, were not questioned for decades.]{.underline}

Despite major changes in China's external security environment, economic
resources, and technological capabilities, its approach to nuclear
strategy and force structure has been relatively consistent since the
1960s[. As China developed and revised its operational doctrine for the
use of nuclear weapons beginning in the mid-1980s, it continued to
stress deterring nuclear attacks against China and has not shifted to
pursue nuclear war fighting]{.underline}. [Changes in the composition of
China's nuclear forces have, on balance, emphasized increasing quality
over quantity in an effort to achieve a secure second-strike
capability]{.underline}---albeit with an understanding that quantity
matters in a world in which nuclear powers also possess strategic
defenses. Indeed, such constant policies are perhaps rare, not just in
the military arena but in national security policy more generally.

Before proceeding, we must mention one caveat. [Any assessment of
Chinese leaders' beliefs about the utility of nuclear weapons and the
requirements of deterrence must begin with the observation that primary
source data remain scarce but are growing]{.underline}. Within the study
of contemporary China, military and security issues are among the most
challenging because of the limited access to government documents and
leadership statements. And within the study of Chinese military and
security affairs, problems of data availability are most acute regarding
nuclear issues, in part a reelection of China's decision to maintain
ambiguity regarding multiple attributes of its force.16 [To overcome
these challenges, we tap a range of Chinese-language materials, some of
which have become available only in the past decade.]{.underline} One
set of materials includes publications by military academies and
scholars on questions of military strategy and doctrine, such as
multiple editions of Zhanlue Xue (The Science of Strategy) and Zhanyi
Xue (The Science of Campaigns) as well as Zhanyi Lilun Xuexi Zhinan
(Campaign Theory Study Guide). A second set of materials includes party
history documents, such as the memoirs (huiyilu), chronologies (nianpu),
and selected military works (junshi wenxuan) of key political elites
involved in China's nuclear weapons programs, especially Mao Zedong,
Deng Xiaoping, Nie Rongzhen, and Zhang Aiping.

The Future Direction of China's Nuclear Posture The puzzle addressed in
this article and our explanations of it raise the obvious follow-on
question: How will China's nuclear strategy and forces evolve in the
future? Will they continue on their current trajectories or assume new
ones? And what are the factors that will influence either possibility?
In general, [the drivers of China's future nuclear strategy]{.underline}
have two main attributes: they [are principally linked to advances in
U.S. military capabilities]{.underline} (as opposed to those of other
nations) [and to U.S. strategic defenses and conventional strike
capabilities]{.underline} [in addition to the United States' nuclear
forces]{.underline}. More specifically, [the PLA's main concerns about
maintaining a credible second-strike force are driven by the U.S.
military's development of]{.underline} a trifecta of [nonnuclear
strategic capabilities]{.underline}: (1) [missile defenses,]{.underline}
(2) [long-range conventional strike, and]{.underline} (3) [sophisticated
command, control, communications, computers, intelligence, surveillance,
and reconnaissance]{.underline} (C4 ISR) [assets to locate and target
China's nuclear forces]{.underline}. The combination of these three
capabilities, in the eyes of the Chinese, provides the United States
with the ability to eliminate China's deterrent in a crisis without
crossing the nuclear threshold, reopening the door to U.S. coercion of
China. [The PLA fears that the United States could use its C4 ISR assets
to locate Chinese nuclear forces and destroy most of them with
long-range conventional strikes]{.underline}. U.S. missile defenses
would then allow the United States to "catch" [China's ragged
retaliation.129 It is this scenario that motivated the debate about the
viability of China's no first-use pledge, and it is now motivating
multiple dimensions of nuclear and missile procurement addressed
above.]{.underline}

As China's nuclear strategy and forces evolve, an important
consideration is that the Second Artillery does not determine either
one. Instead, it represents only one of a growing number of voices in
internal discussions on nuclear issues. Moreover, the influence of the
Second Artillery in these debates, including those related to the size
of China's nuclear forces, is unclear. For decades, nuclear strategy and
doctrine in China has been the purview of the weapons scientists who
developed China's nuclear and missile capabilities by dint of their
positions both within the PLA as well as within China's military
research and development complex.130 [Based on Mao's and Deng's views on
the limited utility of nuclear weapons, these military scientists made
recommendations about the capabilities China should pursue]{.underline}.
In the last ten to fifteen years, this appears to have changed, a bit.
[The PLA has begun to play a larger role in internal discussions about
China's nuclear strategy by virtue of several factors: its accumulated
expertise on military doctrine, its successful renovation of overall PLA
doctrine, its greater role in defense procurement]{.underline}
(following key reforms in the late 1990s), its greater
professionalization, and a changed political environment that has
allowed discussion of such sensitive topics. A[s a result, the PLA
increasingly has a voice in such issues]{.underline}. The Second
Artillery, however, is one voice within a broader collection of PLA
strategists and operators, including those in the General Staff
Department and in the General Armaments Department (responsible for
procurement for the entire PLA). So, the Second Artillery likely may
advance recommendations about changes in doctrine and capabilities
(including changes in capabilities that have a direct impact on
doctrine), but these issues are ultimately decided at the national level
of the civilian leadership, in which actors outside of the PLA have a
strong voice, including the scientific establishment, civilian experts,
and the ministry of foreign affairs. Even though more debate is likely,
the increased number of actors involved in decisions about China's
overall nuclear posture creates an additional barrier to building a
consensus around a rapid and significant shift from its current strategy
and force structure.

Looking forward, this situation suggests that two aspects of
modernization should be monitored, as they might signal a change in
China's nuclear posture. First, [in response to missile defense programs
in the United States and other countries, the Second Artillery is
researching and developing a variety of technologies to defeat such
systems]{.underline}, including maneuvering reentry vehicles (MaRVs),
multiple independently targeted reentry vehicles (MIRVs), decoys, chaff,
jamming, thermal shielding, and ASAT weapons.131 If deployed, MaRV and
MIRV warheads could affect China's strategic relationships with other
nuclear powers by increasing the options available to China for using
its nuclear weapons, including providing it with additional options
against smaller nuclear powers such as India. This shift could undermine
strategic stability in China's relationships with India and Russia
because MIRV'd missiles, in particular, have a first-strike potential.
Arming the silo-based missiles such as the DF-5 with MIRV'd warheads
might also further undermine crisis stability by presenting a
potentially vulnerable target for an opponent's ªrst strike against
China.

Second, another aspect to monitor is whether China's new MRBMs, IRBMs,
and land-attack and air-launched cruise missiles will be armed with
nuclear warheads. To date, these systems appear to have conventional
missions. If these new systems assumed nuclear roles, beyond just
replacing the aging DF-21, DF-3A and DF-4 systems, this could indicate
an important shift in China's approach to nuclear weapons. Such
developments could indicate, for example, that China seeks to develop a
more ºexible nuclear posture to deter a broader range of threats across
a wider set of contingencies. This could lead to a greater willingness
to countenance using nuclear weapons for discrete military purposes,
moving China down the slippery slope of nuclear war-ªghting strategies
and away from a strict emphasis on assured retaliation. These are
important areas of PLA operational doctrine and weapons procurement to
monitor.

This article began with a simple puzzle: Why was China willing to accept
such a high degree of vulnerability of its nuclear arsenal for more than
four decades? [Structural realism and the practices of other
nuclear-armed states might have predicted that China would develop a
larger and more diverse nuclear force and a more detailed strategy for
using it. Instead, China gradually built a modest-sized arsenal and
articulated a basic nuclear strategy that stressed development of a
secure second-strike capability for achieving deterrence through assured
retaliation, including an arsenal large enough to overcome a potential
adversary's strategic defenses.]{.underline}

To explain this puzzle, we advanced two explanations. First, [China's
top leaders and military strategists held simple views about the role
and missions of nuclear weapons: to deter nuclear aggression, to prevent
coercion by other nuclear armed states, and to confer a diffuse sense of
great power status on China]{.underline}. Perhaps more important, [they
embraced the idea of deterrence through assured retaliation and believed
that a small number of survivable weapons was sufficient to accomplish
these goals, with these conditions left up to technical experts to
interpret]{.underline}. These simple ideas provided a consistent and
persistent strategic logic that drove only a very gradual development of
strategy and forces. Second, for decades, China's military lacked
expertise on nuclear strat egy and devoted little attention to it,
leading to an underspeciªed strategy and underdeveloped operational
doctrine. China's political culture created an environment in which
Mao's and Deng's beliefs predominated, especially in a CCP-controlled
military with a tradition of land-based conventional warfare. Over time,
[this situation evolved as expertise and attention to nuclear issues
grew and as external events required China's response. This change led
China to examine, systematically, the requirements of a credible
second-strike capability, which it appears to have
achieved.]{.underline}

#### Theories of strategic stability shape Chinese decision making and is the cornerstone of their nuclear policy.

When [China's nuclear and strategic communities]{.underline} were
introduced to Western literature on deterrence and strategic stability,
they [found the Western analytical framework useful in academic and
policy research and began to incorporate it into China's domestic
discussions]{.underline}. Since then, [Chinese analysts have written and
published a relatively large number of papers to apply and promote the
new analytical framework for understanding nuclear stability. These
authors include experts from nuclear defense industry,5 the military,6
the foreign ministry's research institutes,7 think tanks,8 and
university research centers]{.underline}.9

Today, although there is still debate about the precise definitions of
certain terms,10 [many Chinese analysts are comfortable examining the
security implications of specific nuclear policies by looking at their
potential impact on crisis stability and arms control stability---the
two main components of strategic stability in Western
literature]{.underline}.11 As these concepts are accepted and embraced
by a wider circle of policymakers and academic analysts, [more Chinese
experts are using them to study the security implications of new
military developments---both in the United States and elsewhere---on
Chinese nuclear deterrence and regional stability, including the impact
of missile defense on nuclear relationships]{.underline}.12 In previous
debates on deep nuclear reductions, [Chinese experts have also used
these concepts to formulate policy recommendations and to explore how
strategic stability will change as global nuclear stockpiles continue to
decrease]{.underline}.13

[Chinese nuclear experts view the maintenance of a secure second-strike
capability as the cornerstone of China's deterrent and the fundamental
guarantee of national security]{.underline}. Accordingly, China appears
fully committed to maintaining a mutual vulnerability relationship with
its nuclear rivals,14 and views it as a necessary condition for
achieving strategic stability.15

After [this narrower concept of strategic stability was accepted by the
Chinese nuclear community, it began to be incorporated into official
Chinese rhetoric.]{.underline} Starting in the late 2000s[, Chinese
official statements and documents began to refer to strategic stability
in the same manner]{.underline}.16

### 2ac: specific policy approaches good

#### Examining specific decisions surrounding military presence in Asia is the best way to approach policy -- a contextual approach avoids essentializing theories and challenges dominant security narratives.

Canada, "Writing Southeast Asian Security: The "War On Terror" As A
Hegemonic Security Narrative and its Effects in Southeast Asia: A
(Critical) Security Analysis,"
https://macsphere.mcmaster.ca/bitstream/11375/13115/1/fulltext.pdf)

Significantly, it would have been difficult to draw the conclusions that
I have drawn without deploying the particular critical security approach
that has been articulated in this dissertation. This is a critical
security approach with post-structuralist underpinnings, but is an
approach that demurs from postmodern tendencies to eschew any and all
foundational assumptions. Instead, I have articulated and deployed a
promising method of "immanent critique," informed by Stephen K. [White's
notion of "weak ontology,"]{.underline} which [calls for a thoughtful
engagement with complex security questions using a case-based
examination of empirical "realities." This]{.underline} exercise [is
about contingently situating one's theorizations of security in response
to particular cases and in particular contexts. This creates
opportunities to still engage in the types of foundational ontologizing
that is required to cope with the political and ethical problematics of
security, but to do so in ways that can help us avoid reifying or
essentializing any particular security structure]{.underline}. As such,
my analysis of the many-layered critical security effects of the WOT on
East and Southeast Asia is predicated on the presupposition that [it
is]{.underline} not only desirable, but [necessary, to situate critical
security perspectives within particular empirical contexts- historical,
geographical, and discursive]{.underline}.

[This is the key to bridging the divide between a postmodern
"post-ponism"]{.underline} (Connolly 1989) [that is disengaged from the
"realities" of security/insecurity and the pragmatic need to move from
deconstruction towards a practical engagement with the world in the
hopes of creating the space for re-visioning alternative security
futures contingent upon the empirical realities of specific places and
times]{.underline}. As mentioned, [this exercise]{.underline} is not
about trying to operate without ever making foundational claims, but
rather [calls on us to be very careful not to naturalize particular
security logics as being timeless and inevitable]{.underline}. In
revealing the silences that are inherent in a mainstream security
analysis of this specific region during this specific historical period
and under this specific security narrative, I was able to bring forward
important ways of seeing and understanding the many insecurities
engendered by the US WOT in East and Southeast Asia.

Notably, a critical security analysis can "see" the causes and the
implications of the misconstrued threat of terrorism in Southeast Asia
that continues to be propagated by the various "experts" who employ
narrow visions of security in their analyses (see Chapter IV); the
gendered insecurities that will only increase with the strengthened
return of US military interests in the region along with the complex
issues around post-colonial sovereignties and identities that East and
Southeast Asian actors must continue to navigate (see Chapter V); the
co-optation of the WOT discourse and security practices by governing
regimes in the region in order to help legitimize various forms of state
repression employed in pursuit of "national resilience" (see Chapter V);
and the different ways in which regional multilateral fora have been
influenced and hijacked by the WOT agenda (see Chapter VI). And once
again, the whole point of this project was never to discount the threat
of terrorism in Southeast Asia or the existence of more "traditional"
security problems as far as they do exist. Rather, the point has been to
ask an alternative set of questions about terrorism and state responses
to terrorism- different questions than ones traditionally asked by the
"experts"- in order to reveal some of the less obvious ways that
terrorism, along with reactions to terrorism vis-à-vis the WOT, can
influence the security/insecurity of groups and individuals.

In terms of my contributions to security literature pertaining to East
and Southeast Asia, with this project I have added to the growing field
of CSS as it pertains to this region in particular. As I have outlined,
much of the existing "critical" literature on the region (for example,
see Foot 2005; Hamilton-Hart 2005, 2009; Caballero-Anthony 2005) though
very valuable in its own right, is not the "critical" edge of security
theory that I am particularly interested in due mainly to continuing
adherences to different manifestations of strong ontology and presumed
realist-based security logics. [There is]{.underline} still then, [a
want for more approaches that emphasize critical post-structuralist ways
of understanding security]{.underline}- ones that emphasize the
importance of intertextuality and intersubjectivity, as well as the
constitutive effects of a larger security narrative. They are starting
to emerge (see Burke and McDonald 2007; Tan 2006 for example) and what
is promising about them is that [they ask fundamental ontological
questions about "security/insecurity" itself]{.underline}. Who or what
is being "secured" and does a "secure" state necessarily translate into
a "secure" population? Can "security" and "insecurity" exist
simultaneously? What questions have yet to be asked about
"security/insecurity" in East Asia, and what questions are unable to be
asked under the statist rubric of either realism or constructivism, both
of which rely on "strong" ontological theorizations of security? These
are the types of questions that I have been interested in exploring, and
that I have explored in this dissertation in the regional context of
East and Southeast Asia. Importantly, [these are]{.underline} also [the
types of questions that can only be asked- and answered within a
critical security studies framework that allows for the weak
ontologizing necessary for grappling with an immanent critique of
actually occurring security logics.]{.underline}

### 2ac: \_\_\_\_ turn

#### Their corrective of throwing out research is bad -- a weak ontological position solves their links and is better for political contestation.

**Mustapha, '09**

(Jennifer, PhD, Assistant Professor Political Science @ Western
University, Canada "An Analytical Survey of Critical Security Studies:
Making the Case for a (Modified) Post-structuralist Approach," Paper
presented at the 2009 CPSA, Ottawa)

White points out that strong ontology is a feature of much of pre-modern
and modern thought (6). [The idea that there is a First Cause of what is
moral and good which exists "out there,"]{.underline} c[ombined with the
assumption that this First Cause can be known,]{.underline} is the
lynchpin of ancient Greek philosophy, the philosophies of the Abrahamic
faiths, and Enlightenment thinking. However, [these unquestioned
assumptions about what is and what can be known comprise a double move
that fails to problematize the limits to our knowledge and the confines
of our discourse]{.underline}. What White is interested in, is an
"ontological turn" that is perceptible in what he calls "late-modern"
thinking (4). This late-modern thinking can be observed in "a growing
propensity to interrogate more carefully those 'entities' presupposed by
our typical ways of seeing and doing in the modern world" (White 2000,
4). In other words, recognition of the contingency and indeterminacy of
what is known and how it is known. This understanding of ontology is an
important feature of my analysis of security studies. As I will
demonstrate shortly, the movement from realist security studies to
critical security studies, and the divisions within critical security
studies can be better understood using this helpful distinction between
the strong ontology of modernity and the late-modern "ontological turn,"
which brings to the fore the "strengths of weak ontology" (White 2000).

["Weak ontology" does not refer to the (lack of) persuasiveness of a
theory's ontological commitments so much as it refers to the process of
arriving at those commitments and an acknowledgement of their
contestability]{.underline}. [Weak ontology sees that the costs of
bracketing out contingency and indeterminacy, which a strong ontology
must do, far outweigh the benefits of doing so]{.underline}.
Furthermore, [a weak ontology approach recognizes that rejecting new
ontological commitments, as some postmodern and antiessentialist views
are wont to do, is profoundly problematic]{.underline}. Importantly
then, weak ontologies respond to two basic concerns:

First, [there is the acceptance of the idea that all fundamental
conceptualizations of self, other and world are
contestable]{.underline}. Second, [there is the sense that such
conceptualizations are nevertheless necessary or unavoidable for an
adequately reflective ethical and political life]{.underline}. The
latter insight demands from us an affirmative gesture of constructing
foundations, the former prevents us from carrying out this task in a
traditional fashion. (White 2007, 8. Emphasis added).

This "affirmative gesture of constructing foundations" is crucial to
debunking the simplistic reconstructive/deconstructive and
modern/postmodern binaries as they are often evoked. Such labels can be
limiting and are too often used in "disciplinary mudslinging matches,
which can close down discussion and inquiry before a close reading of
specific arguments or consideration of the issues involved" (Fierke
2007, 3).

[For some, post-structuralist commitments necessitate a permanent state
of deconstruction; while for others these commitments are modes of
inquiry and interrogation that do not necessarily foreclose acts of
re-construction]{.underline} (Hay 2002). Importantly then, this
ontological turn can be observed in a variety of forms, and White
cautions against it being over-identified with anti-essentialist
postmodernism in particular, as it often is. This is because
postmodernism is only one manifestation of this late-modern ontological
turn, and some postmodern thinkers have "failed to attend sufficiently
to problems related to articulating and affirming the very
reconceptualizations toward which they gesture" (White 2000 5-6). White
argues that there appears to be an unconscious tendency on the part of
some postmodern thinkers to ...reproduce in a new guise the problem of
frictionless subjectivity within their own stance... the affirmed mode
of individual agency becomes one of continuous critical motion,
incessantly and disruptively unmasking the ways in which the modern
subject engenders, marginalizes and disciplines the others of its
background and foreground...the potential, ironic danger here is that
the former image of subjectivity comes to look uncomfortably like the
latter. (White 2000, 6)

White's critique is a fair one, and weak ontology is a useful concept
for unpacking these tensions. This is because [it is meant to "shift the
intellectual burden... from a preoccupation with what is opposed and
deconstructed, to an engagement with what must be articulated,
cultivated and affirmed in its wake]{.underline}" (White 2000, 8).

As such, [in (re)constructing foundations it is important to explicitly
acknowledge the contestability and indeterminacy of those foundational
claims and "involves the embodiment within them of some signaling of
their own limits"]{.underline} (ibid). Importantly [it is not enough to
"simply declare their contestability, fallibility, or partiality at the
start and then proceed pretty much as before]{.underline}" (ibid), since
this can encourage a propensity towards naturalization and reification,
which weak ontologies seek to avoid. [What is crucial in a weak
ontology, is that such an acknowledgement of epistemological limitations
4 necessarily changes the very nature of the assertions being
made]{.underline}. Therefore, unlike in a strong ontology where
foundational claims are asserted unproblematically and unreflexively,
[in a weak ontology foundational claims need to be constantly affirmed,
and the ethical function of theorizing resides in its goal of critically
sustaining one's affirmations]{.underline}. As an important corrective
to the modernist-traditionalist critiques of latemodern (and postmodern)
thinking, "[the affirmation of weak ontology should not be confused with
a stance of continual indecisiveness]{.underline}" (White 2000, 14).

#### Rejections of IR theory that includes Western perspectives creates a harmful and homogenizing form of Asian exceptionalism -- multiple perspectives are key to generate effective understandings of foreign policy.

**Acharya, '07**

(Amitav, UNESCO Chair in Transnational Challenges and Governance and
Professor of International Relations at the School of International
Service, American University, "Theoretical Perspectives on International
Relations in Asia," Conference on International Relations in Asia: The
New Regional System," George Washington University, 27-29 September,
http://www.amitavacharya.com/sites/default/files/Theoretical%20Perspectives%20on%20International%20Relations%20in%20Asia.pdf)

More importantly, with the growing interest in theory, [the debate over
the relevance of Western theory to analyze Asia has
intensified]{.underline}. Perspectives that view IR theory as a
fundamentally ethnocentric enterprise that does a poor job of analyzing
Asian IR are becoming commonplace in Asian writings on the region's IR.
And this view is shared by a number of leading Western scholars. [This
debate has also led to a search for an "Asian IR theory",]{.underline}
akin to the English School or the Copenhagen School. But there is little
movement in the direction of an Asian IR theory in the regional sense.
This is not surprising, given Asia's subregional and national
differences. 36 There is a great scope for national perspectives, even
that in a highly contested manner.37 For example, some Chinese scholars
are attempting to develop a Chinese School of IR, derived either from
Chinese historical practices such as the warring states period and the
tributary system, or from the metaphysical Chinese worldview.38 But
[a]{.underline}n equally [vocal group of Chinese scholars rejects this
approach, insisting that IR theory must have a universal
frame.]{.underline} [According to this group, attempts to develop IR
theory should be guided by "scientific" universalism, rather than
cultural specificity.]{.underline}39 Going by this immensely helpful and
exciting debate, t[he challenge, then, is to broaden the horizons of
existing IR theory by including the Asian experience, rather than either
to reject IR theory or to develop a Chinese or Asian School that will
better capture and explain China's or Asia's unique historical
experience]{.underline}, but have little relevance elsewhere, even
though such universalism would still require deeper investigations into
Asian history.

There is thus a growing space for an Asian universalism in IR theory. I
use the term "Asian universalism" since it is in direct juxtaposition to
the Asian exceptionalism found in the extreme form in the notion of
Asian values (Mahbubani), Asian conception of human rights, Asian
democracy (Neher), or in a more moderate strain in claims about an Asian
form of capitalism ("third form of capitalism", Richard Stubbs) or an
Asian mode of globalization (Mahbubani again). [Asian exceptionalism,
especially in its extreme form, refers to the tendency to view Asia as a
unique and relatively homogenous entity which rejects ideas, such as
human rights and democracy, which lay a claim to universality, but which
are in reality constructed and exported by the West]{.underline}. [Such
ideas are to be contested because of their lack of fit with local
cultural, historical and political realities in Asia]{.underline}.
A[sian universalism]{.underline} by contrast [refers to the
fit,]{.underline} often constructed by local idea entrepreneurs[,
between external and Asian ideas and practices with a view to give a
wider dissemination to the latter]{.underline}. This involves the
simultaneous reconstruction of outside ideas in accordance with local
beliefs and practices and the transmission and diffusion of the
preexisting and localized forms of knowledge beyond the region. Whereas
[Asian exceptionalism is relevant only in analyzing and explaining local
patterns of IR, Asian universalism would use local knowledge to
understand and explain both local and foreign IR.]{.underline}

T[he impetus for Asian universalism comes from several
sources]{.underline}. The first is a historical shift from economic
nationalism, security bilateralism, and authoritarian politics in the
post-war period to economic interdependence, security multilateralism
and democratic politics of the post-Cold War era. This shift is far from
linear, but it is occurring and having a substantial impact on studies
of Asian IR. And this need not be seen as a purely or mainly liberal
trend, as it would be mediated by local historical, cultural and
ideational frameworks which have their roots in local conceptions of
power politics, utilitarianism and normative transformation. [This shift
challenges the distinction between Asian and universal knowledge claims
and expands the scope for grafting outside theoretical concepts onto
Asian local discourses.]{.underline}

The region also abounds in historical forms of local knowledge with a
universal reach. Examples include the ideas of Asian thinkers such as
Rabindranath Tagore's critique of nationalism, Nehru's neutralism and
non-alignment, and Gandhi's satyagraha. 40 There are many Japanese
writings which were developed either in association with, or in reaction
against, Western concepts of nationalism, internationalism and
international order.41 Although some of these Indian and Japanese
contributions were either critiques of Western ideas (like nationalism)
or were borrowed forms of Western ideas (such as Gandhi's borrowing of
passive resistance), they were sufficiently infused with a local content
to be deemed as a form of local knowledge. Moreover, [the outcome of
this interaction between Western and Asian ideas was "constitutive" in
the sense that it redefined both the Western ideas and the local
identities.]{.underline} And while the localization of Western ideas
might have been originally intended for domestic or regional audiences[,
the resulting concepts and practices did possess a wider conceptual
frame to have relevance beyond Asia]{.underline}. Such ideas deserve a
place alongside existing theories of IR. Historical patterns of
inter-state and inter-civilizational relations in Asia, including the
tributary system, also do have their place, if they can be
conceptualized in a manner that would extend their analytical utility
and normative purpose (present in any theory) beyond China or East Asia.

[Asian practices of international relations are another rich source of
Asian universalism in IR theory]{.underline}.43 Asian regionalism, which
both manages the balance of power and expans the potential for a
regional community, also provides a good potential avenue for such
universalism. Instead of drawing sharp distinction between what is
European and what is Asian, theoretical perspectives on Asian
regionalism should explore commonalities which are quite substantial and
would constitute the core of a universal corpus of knowledge about
regionalism in world politics.

While Asia's "distinctive" history, ideas, and approaches will condition
the way Western theoretical ideas are understood and make their impact,
elements of the former will find their way into a wider arena
influencing global discourses about international order in the 21st
century[. The challenge for theoretical writings on Asian IR is to
reflect on and conceptualize this dynamic44, whereby scholars do not
stop at testing Western concepts and theories in the Asian context, but
generalize from the latter on its own terms in order to enrich an
hitherto Western-centric IR theory.]{.underline}

**Chandler, '09**

(David, Professor of International Relations at the Department of
Politics and International Relations, University of Westminster, "War
Without End(s): Grounding the Discourse of 'Global War'," Security
Dialogue, Vol. 40(3): 243--26,2
https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/0967010609336204)

Rethinking Global War Western governments appear to portray some of the
distinctive characteristics that Schmitt attributed to 'motorized
partisans', in that [the shift from narrowly strategic concepts of
security to more abstract concerns reflects the fact that Western states
have tended to fight free-floating and non-strategic wars of aggression
without real enemies at the same time as professing to have the highest
values and the absolute enmity that accompanies these]{.underline}. The
government policy documents and critical frameworks of 'global war' have
been so accepted that i[t is assumed that it is the strategic interests
of Western actors that lie behind the often irrational policy
responses]{.underline}, with 'global war' thereby being understood as
merely the extension of instrumental struggles for control. [This
perspective seems unable to contemplate the possibility that it is the
lack of a strategic desire for control that drives and defines 'global'
war today]{.underline}.

[Very few studies of the 'war on terror' start from a study of the
Western actors themselves rather than from their declarations of intent
with regard to the international sphere itself]{.underline}. [This
methodological framing inevitably makes assumptions about strategic
interactions and grounded interests of domestic or international
regulation and control, which are then revealed to explain the
proliferation of enemies]{.underline} and the abstract and metaphysical
discourse of the 'war on terror' (Chandler, 2009a). For its radical
critics, the abstract, global discourse merely reveals the global intent
of the hegemonizing designs of biopower or neoliberal empire, as
critiques of liberal projections of power are 'scaled up' from the
international to the global.

Radical critics working within a broadly Foucauldian problematic have no
problem grounding global war in the needs of neoliberal or biopolitical
governance or US hegemonic designs. These critics have produced numerous
frameworks, which seek to assert that global war is somehow inevitable,
based on their view of the needs of late capitalism, late modernity,
neoliberalism or biopolitical frameworks of rule or domination. [From
the declarations of global war and practices of military intervention,
rationality, instrumentality and strategic interests are read in a
variety of ways]{.underline} (Chandler, 2007). [Global war is taken very
much on its own terms, with the declarations of Western governments
explaining and giving power to radical abstract theories of the global
power and regulatory might of the new global order of domination,
hegemony or empire.]{.underline}

The alternative reading of 'global war' rendered here seeks to clarify
that the [declarations of global war are a sign of the lack of political
stakes and strategic structuring of the international sphere rather than
frameworks for asserting global domination]{.underline}.
[We]{.underline} increasingly [see Western diplomatic and military
interventions presented as justified on the basis of value-based
declarations, rather than in traditional terms of interest-based
outcomes]{.underline}. This was as apparent in the wars of humanitarian
intervention in Bosnia, Somalia and Kosovo -- where there was no clarity
of objectives and therefore little possibility of strategic planning in
terms of the military intervention or the post-conflict political
outcomes -- as it is in the 'war on terror' campaigns, still ongoing, in
Afghanistan and Iraq.

[There would appear to be a direct relationship between the lack of
strategic clarity shaping and structuring interventions and the lack of
political stakes involved in their outcome]{.underline}. In fact, [the
globalization of security discourses seems to reflect the lack of
political stakes rather than the urgency of the security threat or of
the intervention]{.underline}. Since the end of the Cold War, the
central problematic could well be grasped as one of withdrawal and the
emptying of contestation from the international sphere rather than as
intervention and the contestation for control. The disengagement of the
USA and Russia from sub-Saharan Africa and the Balkans forms the
backdrop to the policy debates about sharing responsibility for
stability and the management of failed or failing states (see, for
example, Deng et al., 1996). [It is the lack of political stakes in the
international sphere that has meant that the latter has become more open
to ad hoc and arbitrary interventions as states and international
institutions use the lack of strategic imperatives to construct their
own meaning through intervention]{.underline}. As Zaki Laïdi (1998: 95)
explains:

[war is not waged necessarily to achieve predefined objectives, and it
is in waging war that the motivation needed to continue it is
found]{.underline}. In these cases -- of which there are very many --
war is no longer a continuation of politics by other means, as in
Clausewitz's classic model -- but sometimes the initial expression of
forms of activity or organization in search of meaning. . . . [War
becomes not the ultimate means to achieve an objective, but the most
'efficient' way of finding one.]{.underline}

[The lack of political stakes in the international sphere would appear
to be the precondition for the globalization of security discourses and
the ad hoc and often arbitrary decisions to go to 'war']{.underline}. In
this sense, [global wars reflect the fact that the international sphere
has been reduced to little more than a vanity mirror for globalized
actors who are freed from strategic necessities and whose concerns are
no longer structured in the form of political struggles against 'real
enemies']{.underline}. The mainstream critical approaches to global
wars, with their heavy reliance on recycling the work of Foucault,
Schmitt and Agamben, appear to invert this reality, portraying the use
of military firepower and the implosion of international law as a
product of the high stakes involved in global struggle, rather than the
lack of clear contestation involving the strategic accommodation of
diverse powers and interests.

Conclusion International law evolved on the basis of the ever-present
possibility of real war between real enemies. Today's global wars of
humanitarian intervention and the 'war on terror' appear to be bypassing
or dismantling this framework of international order. Taken out of
historical context, today's period might seem to be analogous to that of
the imperial and colonial wars of the last century, which evaded or
undermined frameworks of international law, which sought to treat the
enemy as a justus hostis -- a legitimate opponent to be treated with
reciprocal relations of equality. Such analogies have enabled critical
theorists to read the present through past frameworks of strategic
political contestation, explaining the lack of respect for international
law and seemingly arbitrary and ad hoc use of military force on the
basis of the high political stakes involved. Agamben's argument that
classical international law has dissipated into a 'permanent state of
exception', suggesting that we are witnessing a global war machine --
constructing the world in the image of the camp and reducing its enemies
to bare life to be annihilated at will -- appears to be given force by
Guantánamo Bay, extraordinary rendition and Abu Ghraib.

Yet, [once we go beyond the level of declarations of policy values and
security stakes, the practices of Western militarism fit uneasily with
the policy discourses and suggest a different dynamic: one where the
lack of political stakes in the international sphere means that there is
little connection between military intervention and strategic
planning]{.underline}. In fact, as Laïdi suggests, [it would be more
useful to understand the projection of violence as a search for meaning
and strategy rather than as an instrumental outcome]{.underline}. To
take one leading example of the 'unlimited' nature of liberal global
war: the treatment of terrorist suspects held at Guantánamo Bay, in
legal suspension as 'illegal 260 Security Dialogue vol. 40, no. 3, June
2009 combatants' and denied Geneva Red Cross conventions and
prisoner-of-war status. The 'criminalization' of the captives in
Guantánamo Bay is not a case of reducing their status to criminals but
the development of an exceptional legal category. In fact, far from
criminalizing fundamentalist terrorists, the USA has politically
glorified them, talking up their political importance.

Recall our discussion of a[ttempts to constitute the field as a
three-cornered fight among liberals, realists, and
constructivists]{.underline}. This effort [suffered]{.underline}, as we
have argued, [from significant intellectual problems. It excluded many
approaches]{.underline} --- such as world-systems theories. Much to the
consternation of many scholars, the term 'constructivism' often became a
catch-all for everything from linguistic-turn theories to sociological
institutionalism. At the same time, it also opened new doors for
marginalized approaches. In fact, [scholars did not need to
self-identify with any of the three camps to use their theoretical
claims as a springboard to bring additional voices into the
conversation.]{.underline}

Still, [the 'isms' were far too constraining to handle the myriad
theories found in the field,]{.underline} which helps explain their
decline. But if IR theory benefits from the existence of a few clearly
defined positions with widely recognized stakes, then this raises a
question: 'Where do we go from here?'

Some combination of intellectual developments and extra-disciplinary
events may create a new 'great debate' that benefits, rather than
inhibits, robust IR theorizing. But we believe that [we neither ought to
look for, nor are likely to find, something along the lines of the
'paradigm wars' between 'isms.']{.underline} Instead, [if we want to
construct maps of international theory that draw our attention to
field-wide disputes with important stakes, then we should adopt
topographies that]{.underline}: • [reconstruct already-existing terms of
debate]{.underline}; • [deal with more fundamental --- and therefore
much broader --- concerns of scientific ontology than did the
'isms';]{.underline} and • [involve gradations of disagreement rather
that purport to describe self-contained theoretical
aggregates.]{.underline}

Describing the state of IR theory along these lines involves two
additional implications. First, the axes of contention we identify will
never capture the entirety of existing international theorizing. In our
view, this is not a cause for excessive concern. [No framework will
likely exhaust the totality of IR theory around the world]{.underline}.
[What matters is that a mapping capture an important set of disputes
with significant field-wide stakes, and that it also provide hooks for
even those theories that do not fit into it very well.]{.underline}

likely to have a highly dramatic impact on U.S.-China
relations]{.underline}, as the 1995-1996 missile crisis and the 2001

Johnson is right when he suggests that \"a policy of containment toward
China implies the possibility of war, just as it did during the Cold War
vis-à-vis the former Soviet Union. The balance of terror prevented war
between the United States and the Soviet Union, but this may not work in
the case of China.\"93 For instance, [as the United States presses ahead
with a missiledefence shield to \"guarantee\" its invulnerability from
rather unlikely sources of missile attacks, it would be almost certain
to intensify China\'s sense of vulnerability and compel it to expand its
current small nuclear arsenal so as to maintain the efficiency of its
limited deterrence. In consequence, it is not impossible that the two
countries, and possibly the whole region, might be dragged into an
escalating arms race that would eventually make war more
likely.]{.underline}

[**STOCKHOLM INTERNATIONAL PEACE RESEARCH
INSTITUTE**](https://www.sipri.org/) undated ("SIPRI Arms Transfers
Database -- Methodology," Stockholm International Peace Research
Institute, <https://www.sipri.org/databases/armstransfers/background>)

[SIPRI statistical data on arms transfers relates to actual deliveries
of major conventional weapons.]{.underline} To permit comparison between
the data on such deliveries of different weapons and to identify general
trends, SIPRI has developed a unique system to measure the volume of
international transfers of major conventional weapons using a common
unit, the trend-indicator value (TIV).

The TIV is based on the known unit production costs of a core set of
weapons and is intended to represent the transfer of military resources
rather than the financial value of the transfer. Weapons for which a
production cost is not known are compared with core weapons based on:
size and performance characteristics (weight, speed, range and payload);
type of electronics, loading or unloading arrangements, engine, tracks
or wheels, armament and materials; and the year in which the weapon was
produced. A weapon that has been in service in another armed force is
given a value 40 per cent of that of a new weapon. A used weapon that
has been significantly refurbished or modified by the supplier before
delivery is given a value of 66 per cent of that of a new weapon.

SIPRI calculates the volume of transfers to, from and between all
parties using the TIV and the number of weapon systems or subsystems
delivered in a given year. This data is intended to provide a common
unit to allow the measurement if trends in the flow of arms to
particular countries and regions over time. Therefore, the main priority
is to ensure that the TIV system remains consistent over time, and that
any changes introduced are backdated.

In cases where deliveries are identified but it is not possible to
identify either the supplier or the recipient with an acceptable degree
of certainty, transfers are registered as coming from \'unknown\'
suppliers or going to \'unknown\' recipients. In cases where there is an
arms transfer agreement for weapons that are produced by two or more
cooperating countries, and if it is not clear which country will make
the final delivery, the suppliers is listed as \'multiple\'.

SIPRI TIV figures do not represent sales prices for arms transfers. They
should therefore not be directly compared with gross domestic product
(GDP), military expenditure, sales values or the financial value of
export licences in an attempt to measure the economic burden of arms
imports or the economic benefits of exports. They are best used as the
raw data for calculating trends in international arms transfers over
periods of time, global percentages for suppliers and recipients, and
percentages for the volume of transfers to or from particular states.

Examples of SIPRI TIV

To better illustrate how the SIPRI TIV is constructed/calculated, four
types of transfer are outlined below using actual SIPRI TIV: transfer of
a newly produced complete weapons system; a transfer of surplus weapons;
a transfer of significant components for a major conventional weapons
system; and a licensed production arrangement. All of the examples given
are for items delivered or ordered from Germany in 2009.

The transfer of newly produced complete weapons systems: In 2009,
Germany delivered 6 Eurofighter combat aircraft to Austria. One
Eurofighter is valued at 55 million SIPRI TIV. Therefore the delivery is
valued at 330 million SIPRI TIV.

Transfer of surplus weapons: In 2009, Germany delivered 43 surplus
Leopard-2A4 tanks to Chile. One Leopard-2A4 tank is valued at 4 million
SIPRI TIV and a used version is valued at 1.6 million SIPRI TIV (40 per
cent of the value of a new version). Therefore, the delivery is valued
at 68.8 million SIPRI TIV.

Transfer of significant components for major conventional weapons
systems: In 2009, Germany delivered 8 MTU-8000 diesel engines for
frigates to Singapore. One MTU-8000 diesel engine is valued at 4 million
SIPRI TIV. Therefore the delivery is valued at 32 million SIPRI TIV.

Licensed production arrangement: In 2009 the Republic of Korea was
granted a license to produce one Type-209PN submarine. One Type-209PN
submarine is valued at 275 million SIPRI TIV. Therefore the delivery is
valued at 275 million SIPRI TIV.

## Potential Add-Ons

### Drug Trafficking Security Impact

#### Drug trafficking in Central Asia endangers regional insecurity.

**Mubarik and Singh 2016** (Mubarik, Mudasir; Singh, Bawa., PHD
Assistant Professor at the Centre for South and Central Asian Studies,
Research Scholar Central University of Punjab, Security Syndrome in
Central Asia: Russia a Protective Shield, IUP Journal of International
Relations;,
https://search.proquest.com/docview/1814062750?pq-origsite=gscholar)

According to Williams,29 a contributor to the United Nations Office on
Drugs and Crime (UNODC), organized crime reveals that the [networks in
Central Asia are involved in trafficking of drugs,]{.underline} humans,
explosives, and precious materials through the region. [The silk
route-turned-heroin route is carving out a path of death and violence
through one of the world\'s most strategic yet volatile
regions.]{.underline} UNODC (2009) also exposes that [the perfect storm
of drugs, crime and insurgency]{.underline} that has swirled around the
Afghanistan/Pakistan border for years [is heading for Central
Asia]{.underline}. [Central Asia is an important corridor for the
smuggling of illegal narcotics]{.underline} produced in Afghanistan
through Russia to European markets. [The problem is most acute in
Tajikistan which shares a long, porous border with Afghanistan, but it
is present in all of the other Central Asian countries as
well.]{.underline} Afghanistan produces about 90% of the global supply
of opium and nearly about 30% of it transits through

Central Asia (UNODC, 2015). Cornell and Swanström30 reported that [there
are links between state actors and drug traffickers in all the five
states, with impacts,]{.underline} to a lesser or greater degree[, on
domestic politics in all cases.]{.underline} Leijonmarck and
Asyrankulova31 depict the role of organized crime and drug trafficking
in Kyrgyzstan\'s Ethnic Crisis in 2010. Violence indicates that criminal
gangs played a significant role, and suggests that they are unlikely to
support a transfer of political power that would undermine their
influence in the region. [The sporadic violence in eastern Tajikistan\'s
Gorno-Badakhshan region since 2012 is allegedly related to competition
between government forces and local warlords over control of smuggling
routes]{.underline}.32 [The crimestate nexus heightens the likelihood of
political instability becoming violent, because of these groups\' access
to weapons and muscle, also undermining the prospects of governance
reform.]{.underline}

Lopour33 holds that n[arco-trafficking literally can overturn
governments as the instigators of the Kyrgyz revolution in 2005 were
financed by drug money]{.underline}. [Officials of all
levels,]{.underline} from high to low-paid [administrative bureaucrats
and law enforcement officers, are lured by high-profit
margins]{.underline}. Also, [an increasing number of terrorist and
insurgent groups rely on drug trafficking as a source of
funding]{.underline}.34 [Drug trafficking also impacts other security
areas, because traffickers take advantage of established drug routes to
transfer other contraband]{.underline}, including weapons, natural
resources, nuclear waste and trafficked humans (UNODC, 2015). [This has
resulted in rising rates of HIV/AIDS, with the use of contaminated
needles, the most common means of viral infection]{.underline}. Daniel
Kimmage therefore admits that UN has warned that if the spread of
HIV/AIDS is not contained, a serious public health crisis could emerge
in the coming years.

#### Drug trafficking in Central Asia endangers security in the region.

**Nichol, 2010** (Jim Nichol, Specialist in Russian and Eurasian Affairs
for the Congressional Research Service, Central Asia's Security: Issues
and Implications for U.S. Interests, Congressional Research Service,
https://fas.org/sgp/crs/row/RL30294.pdf)

[The trafficking and use of illegal narcotics in Central Asia endanger
the security, independence, and development of the states by stunting
economic and political reforms and exacerbating terrorism, crime,
corruption, and health problems.]{.underline} As a conduit, [the region
has been used as a transit route by criminal groups smuggling narcotics
from Afghanistan,]{.underline} mainly to markets in Russia and Europe,
although drug use [within the region also is accelerating]{.underline}.
The increased use of shared needles for drug injection has contributed
to rising rates of HIV/AIDS in the region. Although the bulk of opiates
from Afghanistan continue to be transported through Pakistan and Iran,
[rising quantities---currently estimated at between 19%-25%---are
trafficked through Central Asia, mainly through
Tajikistan]{.underline}.80 In February 2010, President Berdimuhamedow
stated that drug trafficking and drug addiction rates had become
"alarming" in Turkmenistan, and called for an "uncompromising" war on
drugs. Despite this call for a punitive war, however, the State
Department reports that although "drug addiction is a prosecutable crime
\[in Turkmenistan\] and persons convicted are subject to jail sentences
\... judicial officials usually sentence addicts to treatment."81

### Kurils Russia Far East Scenario

#### Dispute over US military presence on the Kuril Islands is the key issue preventing Japan and Russia resolving the Kuril Island disputes.

**Majumdar '17** (Dave Majumdar is the former Defense Editor for the
National Interest, "Could Russia and China Finally End Their Island
Dispute?" *The National* Interest, 12/12/17,
https://nationalinterest.org/blog/the-buzz/could-russia-japan-finally-settle-their-island-dispute-23630)

[Russia and Japan are moving towards a rapprochement after a long period
of mutual antipathy]{.underline}. In recent days, [Moscow and Tokyo have
started to discuss increased cooperation in the naval
arena]{.underline}. And, in time, [there could be a settlement between
the two powers over the Kuril Islands,]{.underline} which came under
Soviet jurisdiction after the end of the Second World War, but which
Japan wants returned.

["The countries are ready to enhance cooperation between defense
departments on the basis of high-level agreements reached over the last
year]{.underline}," Russia's chief of the general staff, Gen. Valery
Gerasimov said during his visit to Tokyo to meet his Japanese
counterpart Adm. Katsutoshi Kawano.

The Russians and Japanese will hold more than 30 joint exercises during
the coming year, according to the Russian Defense Ministry. But
cooperation between Russia and Japan is not limited to just the military
realm, [the Kremlin might be attempting to reach a more comprehensive
deal with Tokyo that could eventually see the dispute over the Kuril
Islands finally resolved.]{.underline}

"We had a strategic dialogue with Japan before the Ukrainian crisis
(defense and foreign ministers), but now it is being renewed," Vasily
Kashin, a senior fellow at the Center for Comprehensive European and
International Studies at Moscow's Higher School of Economics told The
National Interest. "It is a part of a general rapprochement with Japan.
[There are real hopes to resolve the territorial issues in the coming
years]{.underline} and at the same time there are efforts to boost
economic cooperation."

[There are ongoing negotiations between Russia and Japan on the status
of the Kurils to finally resolving the dispute.]{.underline} "There are
hopes for this," Kashin said. "Maybe [they might fail]{.underline}, but
for now, they are trying seriously, I mean both sides. But the
negotiations are being kept secret."

One possible outcome is that Russia returns the Kurils Islands to Japan
in return for greatly expanded economic and technological cooperation,
but on the condition that no U.S. forces ever set foot on those
territories. The Russians have learned the lessons of history where
Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev withdrew from Eastern Europe without
securing a written guarantee that NATO would not expand into those
regions to fill the void[. "The disputed territory---part or all of
it---would be transferred to Japan with some limitations," Kashin said.
"One of them is that there should be no U.S. military presence on the
territory transferred by Russia, ever."]{.underline}

[That condition, however, is a sticking point for Tokyo, which fears
that accepting such a deal would undermine its alliance with the United
States]{.underline}. "That is a problem ---the Japanese fear that this
undermines their alliance with the U.S. and the U.S. will in this case
exclude Senkaku from the alliance obligations," Kashin said.

#### Resolving Russia-Japan relations is key to development of the Russian Far East. 

Korybko 2018 (Andrew Korybko, US political commentator currently working
for the Sputnik agency, Geopolitics of The Russian Far East, Centre For
Research on Globalization,
https://www.globalresearch.ca/geopolitics-of-the-russian-far-east/5655452)

Despite being a far-flung and underdeveloped region, the [Russian Far
East might turn out to be the country's most promising one if several
visionary connectivity proposals are implemented.]{.underline}

[Russia has been prioritizing the development of its far-flung and
long-neglected Far Eastern region for the past three years
now]{.underline} ever since it commenced the now-annual Eastern Economic
Forum (EEF) in September 2015, [but despite the plethora of deals that
were signed during the last four such gatherings, what's urgently needed
is the implementation of four visionary connectivity projects in order
to turn this part of the country into the next frontier of the emerging
Multipolar World Order]{.underline}. In the order of their prospectively
phased implementation, these initiatives are:

[The Northern Islands Socio-Economic Condominium (NISEC);]{.underline}

[The Korean Corridor (KC);]{.underline}

[The Tikhi-to-Tiksi Corridor (TTC, via the hub city of
Yakutsk);]{.underline}

[and the InterContinental Railway (ICRR).]{.underline}

[The TSR already exists, and a rail link between Yakutsk, Tynda, and
Skovorodino forms part of the TTC, but the rest of this ambitious
connectivity vision still has to be constructed. It's hampered, however,
by]{.underline} three [geopolitical impediments that affect the
following projects:]{.underline}

[no Russian-Japanese World War II peace treaty (NISEC);]{.underline}

no Korean War peace treaty (KC);

and poor Russian-American relations (TCRR).

Another obvious obstacle is [the capital needed to fund
everything]{.underline}, though that [could]{.underline} potentially b[e
unleashed after the peaceful resolution of the three aforementioned
issues]{.underline}. [All the related parties have an enduring strategic
interest in strengthening their complex interdependency with one another
in order to reap the mutually beneficial dividends associated with
multilateral integration projects, reduced transportation costs, and
quicker shipment times brought about by these overland
shortcuts.]{.underline}

Although [the Northern Sea Route]{.underline} will undoubtedly become an
important transit route in the future, it's [nowhere near as
time-efficient as if exports were made across the highlighted rail
routes]{.underline}. [The grand strategic vision is to use these
connectivity corridors as avenues for comprehensively expanding each
partner's relations with one another, with the final goal being the
creation of a new large-scale integrational platform between them that
could be relied upon to stabilize the region and bring wealth to its
people through the improved access to previously untapped natural
resources that it'll provide.]{.underline}

For this far-reaching series of ideas to become a reality, however, [the
three previously mentioned impediments must be resolved]{.underline}.
NISEC is in and of itself both a sub-regional integrational platform and
a proposal for solving the long-running dilemma that's thus far
prevented Russia and Japan from signing a World War II peace treaty. As
for the KC, the US is working very hard to denuclearize North Korea and
promised its leadership plenty of American investments if this process
is ultimately completed, which could in turn make a South Korean-Russian
rail route feasible. Regarding Russian-American relations, these might
be improved through a so-called "New Détente".

So long as the political will is there, then the capital can be found,
though Russia could greatly facilitate this by requesting to join the
joint Indo-Japanese "Asia-Africa Growth Corridor" (AAGC) as its third
strategic partner following the conclusion of a peace treaty with Tokyo.
Furthermore, North Korea's successful denuclearization and America's
promised investments to it afterward could conceivably see both of them
and South Korea joining in the AAGC too, with all parties pooling their
resources to participate in the Russian Far East's integrational
development as the crucial link connecting each of them.
Russian-American relations would have to remarkably improve, but this
isn't impossible.

Even in the event that they don't, however, then [Russia, Japan, the
Koreas, and India could cooperate in developing the Far East
together]{.underline} without the US' participation. T[hese leading
Asian economies might also having an interest in funding the remaining
portion of the TTC in order to offset any speculative future disruptions
across the Bering Strait if they forecast that Russian-American tensions
will continue to endure across the decades.]{.underline} This overland
shortcut to the Arctic might be expensive but [it would more than pay
for its cost through the investor states' access to the region's
untapped mineral and energy resources, as well as their reliable access
to the Arctic Ocean]{.underline}.

Altogether, [the ambitious grand strategic vision put forth in this
policy proposal aims to transform the Russian Far East from the
country's domestic backwater to its international showcase, and in the
process make it the next frontier for multipolarity]{.underline}.
[The]{.underline} solely [economic nature of this series of initiatives
makes it so that they holistically complement China's own One Belt One
Road (OBOR) global vision of New Silk Road connectivity and thus enable
Russia to "balance" between it and the AAGC, which can bring about
enormous economic benefits]{.underline} if it can encourage them to
engage in an intense "friendly competition" over developing the Far
East.

### Entrapment Adv

#### BMD's are the key to Japanese national security capabilities and defense programs.

**Hughes, 2006** (Christopher W., senior research fellow at the Center
for the Study of Globalization and Regionalization, University of
Warwick, UK, Ballistic Missile Defence and US-Japan and US-UK Alliances
Compared,
https://warwick.ac.uk/fac/soc/pais/research/researchcentres/csgr/garnet/workingpapers/1106.pdf)

Ballistic Missile Defence (BMD) is now a reality for Japan's security
policy and the management of US-Japan alliance relations. Japan from
2006 onwards has started to deploy the terminal phase Patriot Advance
Capability (PAC)-3, and aims by 2011 to roll out the full panoply of BMD
systems, consisting of sixteen PAC-3 fire units, six Aegis destroyers
equipped with mid-course phase interceptors, and upgraded sensors and
command and control functions. [The Japanese Cabinet first officially
committed to the acquisition of BMD in December 2003. Since then, BMD
has begun to force major changes in Japan's national security
capabilities and doctrines]{.underline}. [BMD sits squarely at the
forefront of Japan's response to 'new threats' in the revised National
Defence Programme Guidelines (NDPG) of December 2004; and it is the
major procurement item in the Mid-Term Defence Programme for 2005-
2009---BMD's huge costs squeezing the overall defence budget and
obliging the Japan Self Defence Forces (JSDF) to tailor, and in some
cases curtail, plans for continued post-Cold War restructuring and other
equipment procurement around the priority attached to BMD]{.underline}.1
Moreover, [the JSDF, in response to the introduction of BMD and its
related demands for enhanced integration of command and control systems,
has embarked on a restructuring programme that enables for the first
time joint tri-service operational capabilities.]{.underline}
Furthermore, BMD's impact on Japan's defence policy has been manifested
in the government's need to introduce legislation since February 2005
that begins to fundamentally redesign measures for civilian control over
the military in place since the start of the post-war period.

#### Japanese overreliance on US BMDs causes Japanese entrapment with the US. 

**Cronin**, March 19^th^, 20**02** (Richard P. Cronin, Specialist in
Asian Affairs Foreign Affairs, Defense, and Trade Division, Japan-US
Cooperation on Ballistic Missile Defense: Issues and Prospects,
Congressional Research Service,
https://heinonline-org.dartmouth.idm.oclc.org/HOL/Page?collection=congrec&handle=hein.crs/crsacky0001&id=1&men_tab=srchresults#)

Nevertheless, even in the transition to the Bush administration,
Japanese fears of abandonment in relation to missile defence have not
entirely disappeared. In particular, and as will be further elucidated
below, [Japan's dependence on bilateral technological cooperation with
the US for the deployment of BMD has meant that it has been faced with
the choice of either following the US in each stage of progression of
the BMD project or to face the prospect of the US dropping plans for
cooperation and thereby undoing all of Japan's BMD efforts to
date.]{.underline} This type of scenario was very much behind Japan's
being 'bounced' into finally committing to BMD in 2003, [fearing that if
it not remain close to the US as it advanced with missile defence
deployments that it would be abandoned as an ally in this field of
bilateral cooperation.]{.underline}

[Japan's principal fear,]{.underline} though, as always, [has been the
risks of entrapment resulting from close bilateral cooperation with the
US on BMD, especially due to the fashion in which BMD closes down many
of its traditional hedging]{.underline} strategies against this
eventuality. In turn[, Japan's alliance dilemmas vis-à-vis the US
generated by BMD, are themselves compounded by BMD's generation of
security dilemmas in East Asia which force ever greater reliance on the
US-Japan alliance]{.underline}. Japan's existing security dilemma
vis-à-vis North Korea is well known. Japan's participation in BMD,
although not likely to stimulate the North's already on-going missile
programme which is so vital to its diplomatic and military campaign to
break out of its international isolation, is also unlikely to curb the
North's build-up of its missile forces, and this is despite opinions
which see BMD as a means to convince the North of the futility of
threatening Japan and the US.

#### Japanese relies too heavily on US BMDs that require a short reaction time, which draws Japan into conflict.

**Hughes, 2006** (Christopher W., senior research fellow at the Center
for the Study of Globalization and Regionalization, University of
Warwick, UK, Ballistic Missile Defence and US-Japan and US-UK Alliances
Compared,
https://warwick.ac.uk/fac/soc/pais/research/researchcentres/csgr/garnet/workingpapers/1106.pdf)

Firstly, [Japan's ability to evade and temporise is a limited option
under participation in BMD]{.underline}. [Japan]{.underline} during the
uncertainties of the Clinton administration certainly [practiced a type
of wait and see option before committing itself to any specific project
or architecture that might mean it entering into BMD on terms that
overly strategically disadvantaged it against the US.]{.underline}
Japanese policy-makers held to their scheme of breaking decisions about
BMD into the stages of research, development, production and deployment,
contrasting with the US two stage process of development and deployment,
thus attempting to reserve the right to work to Japan's own schedule and
take considered political decisions at stage. Japan has persevered with
this scheme during the Bush administration as well---for instance, still
insisting, despite agreeing to joint development with the US of the SM-3
interceptor in 2006, that a further decision is still necessary on
actual production. Nevertheless, despite Japan's subtle hedging to buy
time in the BMD project, in the end, as seen above, it was effectively
'bounced' into the project by the US unilateral decision to move ahead
with MD deployment, obliging Japan to follow.

Moreover, [once the BMD system is actually deployed, there will clearly
be no opportunity for temporisation in its operation]{.underline}. In
past regional and global contingencies[, Japan has been able to work
through its convoluted decision-making processes to take a decision on
the necessary action]{.underline}. In certain cases, this has taken
weeks or months, and even Koizumi's unprecedented swift response to 9/11
took a matter of days. [By contrast, BMD's timeframe of less than ten
minutes being available to launch missile interceptors, means that
Japanese policy-makers and military commanders will have to respond in
real-time and nearly instantaneously to missile attacks and
participation in a conflict that may spell an active commitment to
military cooperation with the US.]{.underline}

#### Japan's total dependence on the U.S. when it comes to BMDs is bad -- makes Japan reliant on an unpredictable U.S. military strategy and angers China unnecessarily

**Watai 11/27/2018** (Yuki Watai, PhD Canidate in International
Relations at the University of Warwick, "Is Japan's Ballistic Missile
Defense Too Integrated With the US?," The Diplomat,
<https://search-proquest-com.dartmouth.idm.oclc.org/docview/2138056959?accountid=10422&rfr_id=info%3Axri%2Fsid%3Aprimo>)

Japan was among the first countries to participate in the U.S.-led
Ballistic Missile Defense (BMD) project and decided to introduce its own
BMD system in 2003. BMD is a highly integrated system with satellite
radars to detect a missile and address it using a multilayered
anti-ballistic missile system. However, [so far Japan's BMD cannot
possibly function without U.S. technological and military
capabilities]{.underline}, and [most of Japan's BMD developments are
predicated on the assumption that the U.S. military will remain a key
partner]{.underline}. Over the course of 15 years since the system's
introduction, not only has [BMD]{.underline} been an effective tool to
strengthen the U.S. alliance and internal defensive capabilities, but
also it [has created a platform resulting in a highly complex
integration of the two militaries. Japan can no longer say no to the
United States]{.underline} --- not just because of the broader alliance
relationship but [because of overreliance on and integration with the
U.S. military when it comes to defending Japan against ballistic
missiles.]{.underline} BMD has served Japan's strategy very
conveniently, enabling Japan to join the regional offense-defense arms
race despite its pacifist constitution. The nature of BMD as a defensive
system is a perfect fit for Japan's strategy of "exclusively
defense-oriented defense," under which Japan has focused on defensive
capabilities while relying on the U.S. nuclear umbrella. In a similar
vein, BMD also strengthens the architecture of the U.S.-Japan security
alliance -- known as the "Sword and Shield System." Along with Japan's
long-standing emphasis on the alliance as a crucial part of its security
policy, BMD serves not only maintain the alliance but also strengthen
it. This is all the more crucial because, since the 1990s, Japanese
policymakers have been concerned about potential "abandonment" by the
United States after the end of the Cold War and the seeming decline in
the U.S. geopolitical interests in the Asia-Pacific. As Daniel C.
Sneider, an associate director of research for Stanford University's
Walter H. Shorenstein Asia-Pacific Research Center, told Asia Times,
"the Japanese have this fear of abandonment. It's deep-seated in
Japanese strategic thinking." Given this fear, it's interesting to note
that [BMD in Japan cannot function without U.S. military capabilities.
The United States possesses Early Warning Satellites with the
Space-Based Infrared System]{.underline} (SBRIS), operating in earth
orbit, [which]{.underline} cost more than \$11 billion. The SBIRS
[allows the United States to constantly monitor the Asia-Pacific region,
including North Korea, and detect any sign of potential launches. Japan
does not yet possess such capabilities and hence receives information
from the United States]{.underline}. Japan thus far has developed only
ground-based radars, Aegis Destroyers' radar, and Airborne Early
Warning, which are helpful only in tracking missiles after a missile is
launched. Thanks to the very short action time after a missile launch, a
swift exchange of information to detect and track the missile is
crucial, which necessitates both the use of U.S. satellites and enhanced
interoperability to a substantial degree. To ensure effective
functionality of BMD and serve the ever-growing necessity of maintaining
the security alliance, Japan has made substantial efforts, leading to a
seemingly excessive degree of military integration. First, with the
revision of the U.S.-Japan Roadmap for Realignment Implementation in
2006, the limitation on the number of annual joint military training and
exercises was eliminated, increasing the number of joint exercises. This
goes in tandem with widening and deepening consultations and
coordination. [In terms of BMD, the strategy is now almost jointly
planned, consulted, and implemented if necessary.]{.underline} While the
so-called two-plus-two meeting (where the defense and foreign affairs
ministers from each country meet) has long a major platform for the
alliance, now military official-level meeting occurs regularly. Within
the framework of the Alliance Coordination Group (ACG), director
general, director, and action officer-level meetings take place for
military policy coordination. This possible after Japan established its
own National Security Council with a similar structure to the U.S. NSC.
The underlying legal framework to share classified information was
strengthened through Japan's Secrecy Law, substantially increasing the
punishment for leaking classified information. There are various
consultation forums under the two-plus-two framework --- such as the
Security Subcommittee, Subcommittee for Defense Cooperation and
Japan-U.S. Joint Committee --- which are responsible for planning a
strategy and its implementation with a particular focus on North Korea
and BMD. Now the two militaries even have a physical platform to consult
on a daily basis with the establishment of the Bilateral and Joint
Operations Coordination Center at Yokota Air Base for the purpose of
enhancing interoperability regarding air defense and BMD through sharing
information between the headquarters of the Japan Self-Defense Forces
(JSDF) and the U.S. forces. [There have been a variety of developments
and frameworks to enhance interoperability specifically in terms of
BMD]{.underline}. Most notably, Japan recently enacted legislation to
allow the right of collective self-defense, which includes 10 provisions
in the existing legal framework of the JSDF. The most significant part
is arguably the addition of the JSDF's mission to "take necessary
measures to destroy ballistic missiles" headed for Japan's allies as
well as the protection of U.S. military equipment such as Navy vessels.
These changes suggest Japan's readiness to address a missile attack
directed toward U.S. military bases in Guam and elsewhere. Furthermore,
the decision to intercept missile is not unilaterally made by Japan, as
the provision states "when the request is made by the armed forces of
the United States." This was also confirmed by former Japanese Defense
Minister Itsunori Onodera. [It is no longer easy to tell the difference
between the two militaries regarding BMD, apart from the flag. Japan
even repairs and maintains the U.S. military equipment within
Japan]{.underline}. At the same time, Japan and the United States
jointly develop and use some of the core BMD equipment such as Standard
Missile 3 Block IIA (SAM-IIA). Japan recently announced that [Aegis
destroyers will be equipped with the so-called Cooperative Engagement
Capability by 2020, which makes it possible to share information
simultaneously with the U.S. sensor and radar network.]{.underline} A
Nikkei Asian report says that "CEC will be central to the plans for
integrated air-and-missile defense capabilities that the Defense
Ministry is drawing up." [This further blurs the distinction between
Japan and the U.S. military regarding BMD.]{.underline} Japan's
adherence to BMD is seemingly deep-rooted in Japanese policymakers'
minds. Concerned by the absence of any effective defense mechanism
against long-range missiles, Japanese policymakers have a history of
convincing the Ministry of Finance to squeeze out a substantial sum --
even in the midst of the long-term economic recession. The JSDF in
general has faced severe difficulty legitimizing itself due to Japan's
pacifist constitution. The JSDF has thus long been the target of budget
reductions. Amid a long-term economic recession, the budget battle has
continued to this day, as seen in the recent tussling over the new
fighter jet project. However, BMD proves an exception to this rule,
given Japan's expected purchase of Aegis Ashore for \$5.4 billion. The
BMD budget has virtually never been reduced, even when the Democratic
Party of Japan (DPJ) was the ruling party (2009-2012) and had the
principal objective of reducing the government's expenses. Another
reason for the aggressive pursuit of BMD, at least in the eyes of
hawkish lawmakers, is the system's substantial impact on the constraints
on Japanese security. As Christopher, W. Hughes argues, "BMD has
challenged four key anti-militaristic principles --- the non-exercise of
collective self-defense, the non-military use of space, the ban on the
export of weapons technology, and strict civilian control of the
military." It goes without saying that developing BMD simultaneously
contributes to "burden-sharing" as an effective mechanism to maintain
the U.S.-Japan alliance. [The nature of BMD structure between the United
States and Japan -- namely, Japan's reliance on the United States --
will not change as long as Washington possesses critical components such
as early warning satellites. While there was an initiative to develop
Japan's own early warning satellite, only technological research had
been conducted with a budget of merely 6 million yen. Given the U.S.
defense spending on BMD, its technological progress far exceeds that of
Japan]{.underline}, and the chances of Japan possessing even an
equivalent level of technology are probably slim to none. This is not
only about the budget but also Japan's absence of technological
cooperation with the United States in this area, probably due to the
U.S. intention to maintain technological bargaining power. The Japanese
legislation to allow the right of collective self-defense, is tantamount
to admitting that any danger for the U.S. military forces around Japan
is a danger for Japan's national security. [Too much integration between
the U.S.-Japan military, in the end, resulted in the inclusion of the
United States as part of Japan's self-defense mandate]{.underline}.
Looking at the significant development of Japan's defense capability and
efforts to maintain the U.S. alliance, with the cruciality of BMD as a
major defense system for Tokyo, there is no turning back now for Japan.
This suggests that policymakers in Japan may seek a "threat" to justify
the military spending on BMD in the future -- whether that is China or
Russia, or possibly continues to be North Korea, despite the recent thaw
on the peninsula. [Japan's clinging to BMD will have a destabilizing
impact on the Asia-Pacific as this behavior unnecessarily agitates
China. U.S.-Japan military relations have been highly integrated and
intertwined, meaning that Japan's security policy risks being in flux
depending on U.S. initiatives. This situation is all the more uncertain
under the Trump administration. Japan may need to seek a way out of this
incremental integration.]{.underline}

#### **With the advent of Aegis Ashore, Japan just looks more to the United States to supply them with weapons and defend them instead of trying to establish their own defense infrastructure. Japan will become aggressive and try to entrap the US into a war with China or North Korea**

[Doug Bandow](https://www.cato.org/people/doug-bandow) is a senior
fellow at the Cato Institute and a former Special Assistant to President
Ronald Reagan.

The Japanese people don't much like Prime Minister Shinzo Abe. In fact,
a majority of them want someone else as premier. Yet his coalition just
retained its two-thirds majority in snap parliamentary elections. He
should use his reinforced authority to end his nation's defense
dependence on America[. More than seventy years after World War II, that
conflict still burdens Japan, limiting its role in the world. But an
increasingly aggressive China and threatening North Korea caused Tokyo
to adopt a more active foreign and defense policy.]{.underline}
Nevertheless, the U.S.-imposed "peace constitution" still constrains
Tokyo. [Indeed, by its literal terms Article Nine forbids possession of
a military. However, the breakdown of the wartime alliance with the
Soviet Union and creation of the People's Republic of China caused
Washington to flip-flop and favor a rearmed Japan.]{.underline} Japanese
policymakers [relied on creative constitutional interpretation to
establish a "Self-Defense Force.]{.underline}" Still, Tokyo relied on
its constitution as well as popular revulsion to war to both cap
military outlays and restrict the SDF's role---which, conveniently,
helped ensure continued American protection. [Japan's neighbors, many of
which suffered under Tokyo's brutal wartime occupation, were happy to
have Washington forestall full Japanese rearmament. America served as
the "cap in the bottle," f]{.underline}amously said Marine Corps Gen.
Henry Stackpole. Japan was not without friends, such as Taiwan, but
South Korea, Philippines, China and Australia were particularly
antagonistic to an expanded security role for Japan. Moreover, in the
last two decades Tokyo's economic difficulties much increase in
military---sorry, SDF---outlays. Even so, [Tokyo created competent armed
forces. Outlays were close to \$50 billion last year. While Japan's army
is small, its air force and navy are capable and modern]{.underline}.
Still[, potential threats outrange existing resources. The PRC has
sprinted past Japan and now spends upwards of four times as much on the
military]{.underline}. Moreover, Beijing possesses a modest nuclear
arsenal. Although in a war between the two Japan would be no pushover,
its defense outlays have remained roughly constant in real terms,
ensuring a growing bilateral gap. Warned Jeff Kingston of Temple
University in Tokyo: ["There is right now a one-sided arms race that
China is winning."]{.underline} (Without irony, China Daily USA
editorialized against the "bellicose Abe" for increasing military
outlays even though Japan "certainly doesn't need such military
equipment for national security.") North Korea adds another challenge.
Although Pyongyang's conventional forces have little reach beyond the
Korean Peninsula, t[he Democratic People's Republic of Korea possesses a
nascent nuclear capacity as well as chemical and likely biological
weapons[. Missiles make Japan a possible target as an ally of the United
States]{.mark} or victim of extortion.]{.underline} The worsening
security environment creates increasing pressure on Tokyo to do more.
[Since becoming premier in late 2012, [Abe has pushed his country into a
more active role]{.mark}.]{.underline} He proposed increased military
outlays, acquisition of new weapons and broader SDF responsibilities.
[[The military is]{.mark} particularly [interested in adding Aegis
Ashore missile defense systems]{.mark}, Tomahawk cruise missiles and
F-35 fighters. In 2014 the Abe government changed its interpretation of
Article Nine to allow a limited form of "collective
security,"]{.underline} including assisting American personnel under
attack. Tokyo followed with legislation and revised Guidelines for
Japan-U.S. Defense Cooperation the following year. These changes, though
controversial, were modest. [Although collective self-defense finally is
considered legitimate under the constitution, such action is authorized
only under extremely narrow circumstances.]{.underline} Japan's
Professor Narushige Michishita observed that the new rules would not
allow Japan to defend a U.S. ship if Japan's security was not directly
threatened. Moreover, the government failed to move forward with its
plan to revise Article Nine. The failure to do so limits his military
options. Argued Indiana University's Adam P. Liff: "Without formal
constitutional revision (at a minimum), however, more ambitious efforts
to fundamentally transform Article 9's interpretation or the scope of
scenarios in which Japan can use force overseas are unlikely without
major domestic political realignments." Abe pushed for such a change by
running against North Korea, playing on voters' fears. With his newly
enhanced election mandate, he may move further and faster on security
issues. Liff noted that "Strategic and domestic political vicissitudes
have been the major drivers of changing interpretations of Article 9."
[Defense Minister Itsunori Onodera indicated that [the government is
considering revising military guidelines to acquire and use weapons,
such as cruise missiles, capable of hitting foreign
bases]{.mark}]{.underline}. The government also is likely to revive
proposals to amend the constitution. There even is some support among
elites to consider the acquisition of nuclear weapons. Still, opposition
to such changes remains fierce. In fact, Abe's coalition partner, the
Komeito Party, has been reluctant to join his effort[. The Finance
Ministry pointed to the government's massive debt in opposing
accelerated military spending]{.underline}. The prime minister's effort
to change the constitution diminished his poll ratings, before Kim
Jong-un's misbehavior helped revive them. Popular sentiment has been
shifting, but perhaps not enough. ["The Japanese public is still not so
sure about this,"]{.underline} observed Richard Samuels of MIT's Center
for International Studies. Moreover, loosening constitutional
restrictions would not be enough. The government would have to accept
more cost and risk by adjusting its force structure and foreign policy
accordingly. And dramatic change remains unlikely. The Abe government
has been hedging, perhaps feeling greater uncertainty over Washington's
continued security commitment. But [[Tokyo does not want to take over
responsibility for its defense]{.underline}]{.mark}. Indeed, Yoichi
Funabashi of the Asia Pacific Initiative warned that doing more might
"induce or tempt the United States to lessen U.S. commitments to Japan's
defense." In contrast, [[Abe's government is pushing]{.mark} for
[a]{.mark}n ever-[stronger U.S]{.mark}. commitment.]{.underline} One
unnamed foreign-ministry official said: "The strategic environment is
becoming harsher and we need to discuss how we will respond to that"
(emphasis added). Which primarily means Washington. ["[We will look for
the U.S. to reaffirm its defense commitment, including the nuclear
deterrent]{.mark}," declared Onodera as American and Japanese ministers
met: "In light of the threat of North Korea, \[they\] confirmed the
importance of the unwavering U.S. commitment to extended
deterrence.]{.underline}" Washington reciprocates such sentiments. The
joint statement of the August meeting of the U.S.-Japan Security
Consultative Committee confirmed the [ministers' "shared intent to
develop specific measures and actions to further strengthen the
U.S.-Japan Alliance," including "maintaining a robust U.S. force
presence in Japan."]{.underline} At the time Secretary Tillerson
explained that the two countries "stressed the critical role that U.S.
extended deterrence plays in ensuring the security of Japan, as well as
the peace and stability of the Asia Pacific region." [[While working to
increase America's entanglement, Japan is pushing an aggressive
international]{.mark} response to the North]{.underline}. Foreign
Minister Taro Kono said there "should be no [dialogue]{.mark}" absent a
North Korean demonstration of "a clear intent with regard to
denuclearization." Abe advocated applying "an unprecedented higher level
of pressure on North Korea to force it to change policy." He said
countries should unite to deny the North access to "the goods, funds,
people and technology for nuclear and missile development." What is
needed, he added, "is not dialogue, but pressure," and even backed the
Washington mantra that "all options" are on the table, meaning war[. In
advocating such aggressive policies, it would seem appropriate for Japan
to possess commensurate military capabilities.]{.underline} However,
Narushige Michishita of Japan's National Graduate Institute for Policy
Studies worried that "defense is all about hedging risk and if you seek
perfect defense, the cost would be enormous." [[From Tokyo's
perspective, why pay the bill when you can hand it off to
Washington]{.underline}]{.mark}? Tokyo's strategy is good for Japan, not
America. [Yet U.S. officials enjoy playing hegemony even as the American
people pay the bill.]{.underline} Donald Trump once took a different
perspective. Two years ago Trump, when asked about China's threat to the
region, observed, "If we step back, \[America's allies\] will protect
themselves very well." He asked: "Why are we defending them at all?"
Since then, however, he has turned into his predecessors, including the
hated Barack Obama. Of course[, some argue that the United States
occupies East Asia for its own security]{.underline}. That was the case
at the end of World War II. But the Cold War is over, Russia is a shadow
of the Soviet Union and Japan has recovered economically. Tokyo is well
able to defend itself, as well as cooperate with its neighbors to ensure
regional security. Some analysts look beyond Japan. Argued David Feith
of the Wall Street Journal: America's fifty thousand personnel in Japan
are "Washington's most valuable asset for deterring conflict across the
region." Others make the same claim, but never offer any convincing
support. What war are U.S. troops supposedly preventing? China and
Japan, though at odds over the Senkaku/Diaoyu Islands, don't appear to
be at the brink of war. Could conflict erupt? Anything is possible, but
[there's still no reason why wealthy Japan should not do the
deterring.]{.underline} The Marine Expeditionary Force based on Okinawa
is directed more at a Korean than a China-Japan war, and Seoul should
provide the cannon fodder for any war there. Even more so, Washington
should avoid a China-Taiwan confrontation: Taipei is a good friend, but
not worth conflict with a nuclear-armed great power. Better to arm than
defend the island nation. Beyond these major contingencies are smaller
potential conflicts in which the United States should stay entirely
clear: some mix of wars/strife/collapse involving Burma, Thailand,
Cambodia, Vietnam, Indonesia, Malaysia and perhaps others. While such
contingencies would be tragic and might be destabilizing, none would
involve America's vital interests and justify military intervention. Not
every problem is America's to solve. Tokyo should take over its own
defense. But shifting responsibility for Japan's conventional defense is
not enough. The United States should reconsider its nuclear umbrella as
well. In defending Japan, Washington already is risking Los Angeles to
protect Tokyo. If North Korea acquires the ability to hit the U.S.
homeland, Uncle Sam will be doing the same again, only against a
potentially more reckless power. Obviously, Washington expects the
threat of retaliation to deter attack. But if deterrence fails, as it
often has in history, then war could invade the American homeland. And
there's no good reason to take that risk given Japan's capability to arm
itself. The Japanese people might be reluctant to go nuclear, but they
can underinvest in defense with little ill consequence only so long as
Washington is willing to impose the cost on the American people. If the
Japanese realized they had to do more or live (and potentially die) with
the consequences, they might act differently. Unfortunately, American
officials have forgotten the purpose of alliances: defense, not welfare.
Washington should enter into security pacts to help protect America, not
other states. After World War II, the United States properly shielded
friendly states from attack by a totalitarian power. That strategy
succeeded---decades ago. Washington should adjust its foreign policy and
force structure accordingly. Now America's prosperous and populous
allies can take over. The United States should cooperate with them when
interests coincide, and watch for possible hegemonic threats which they
could not contain. Americans no longer should do what other countries
can do for themselves. Then U.S. officials could stop telling Tokyo what
to do. The Japanese people should decide on defense and foreign policies
to advance their own interest, not satisfy America's demands. Washington
should simply explain what it would, and most importantly, would not do.
That would mean no security guarantee, no troop deployments, no promise
of war on Japan's behalf. Washington has spent more than seven decades
playing globocop. The world has changed. So should U.S.
policy---including toward Japan. Prime Minister Abe appears determined
to make Japan a more capable security dependent of America. Washington
should insist that he make his nation security independent.

[the u.s. extended nuclear deterrent to japan and japan's nuclear policy
The U.S. extended nuclear deterrent is the supreme guarantor of Japan's
security and a central component of the U.S.-Japan
alliance.]{.underline} Japan's protection under the U.S. extended
nuclear deterrent has assured Tokyo when China and North Korea have
engaged in provocative actions that threatened Japan's security.
Moreover, [the U.S. extended nuclear deterrent has been a key factor in
dissuading Japan from developing its own nuclear weapons
capability]{.underline}, [which it has considered on several
occasions]{.underline} since the end of World War II. [Moving forward,
the importance of the U.S. extended nuclear deterrent to Japan will be
crucial in assuring Tokyo and deterring adversaries]{.underline}. [While
the unique value of nuclear deterrence is irreplacable, the integration
and expansion of advanced conventional weapons into the U.S.-Japan
alliance can complement the U.S. extended nuclear
deterrent]{.underline}. As the only state to be the victim of nuclear
weapons use, [Japan adopted anti-nuclear policies at the end of World
War II. While the constitution does not explicitly mention nuclear
weapons, it is widely interpreted as prohibiting their
development.]{.underline} Moreover, in 1967, Prime Minister Eisaku Sato
announced the "Three No's," renouncing the manufacture, possession, or
introduction of nuclear weapons in Japan. Sato later changed the three
"no's" to the four pillars of nuclear policy: "[1) promotion of the
peaceful use of nuclear energy; 2) efforts toward global nuclear
disarmament; 3) reliance and dependence on U.S. extended deterrence,
based on the 1960 Treaty of Mutual Cooperation and Security; and 4)
support for the three non-nuclear principles under the circumstances
where Japan's national security is guaranteed by the other three
policies.]{.underline}"8 During the Cold War, the U.S. extended nuclear
deterrent was used in part to project power in the Asia-Pacific, in the
face of the Soviet threat. Tokyo's willingness to allow deployment of
U.S. nuclear weapons on Japanese territory demonstrated the Japanese
government's historically conflicted attitude towards nuclear policy
matters. [The U.S. military forward deployed nuclear weapons or nuclear
weapon components on the U.S.-occupied islands of Iwo Jima, Chichi Jima,
and Okinawa, where it also deployed strategic bombers.]{.underline}9
Additionally, [the U.S. military stored nuclear bombs]{.underline}
(without their fissile cores[) at several Japanese
airbases]{.underline}. U.S. aircraft carriers and strategic bombers with
nuclear weapons onboard were occasionally stationed at Japanese ports
and air bases for short periods of time.10 During the mid-1960s, the
United States withdrew nuclear weapons and components from Iwo Jima and
Chichi Jima. In 1972, Okinawa reverted to Japanese rule, and all nuclear
weapons were removed to comply with Japan's "no introduction" policy.
Though stationing of nuclear weapons on the U.S.-occupied islands did
not violate the constitution or Sato's three no's, the legality of [the
U.S. deployment of nuclear weapons systems at air bases or port
facilities on the Japanese mainland is less clear. While not confirmed
by either state, it is widely believed that in the 1960s the United
States and Japan concluded two agreements on nuclear weapons
policy.]{.underline} The first allowed U.S. ships and aircraft carrying
nuclear weapons to transit Japanese territory. The second secret deal,
completed in 1969, allowed for deployment of nuclear weapons to Okinawa
even after its return to Japanese rule in 1972.11 With the end of the
Cold War, the United States withdrew all nuclear weapons from naval
surface vessels and general-purpose submarines. However, the U.S.
government has argued that its extended nuclear deterrent to Japan
remains strong.12 Today, as noted in the 2010 Nuclear Posture Review
(NPR), [the United States relies on its intercontinental ballistic
missiles (ICBMs), submarine-launched ballistic missiles (SLBMs), and
strategic bomber force for deterrence,]{.underline} in addition to its
ability to redeploy advanced conventional weapons, deterrence and the
u.s.-japan alliance 5 tactical nuclear forces in the event of a
crisis.13 Since 2003, the U.S. Air Force has rotated nuclear capable
B-52 and B-2 aircraft from the continental United States to Guam as part
of a "continuous presence mission."14 The [United States has
periodically flown these unarmed aircraft in the Asia-Pacific region to
signal its commitment to its allies. One such flight occurred in
November 2013, when the U.S. Air Force, without prior notice, flew
unarmed B-52 bombers over the Senkaku/Diaoyu Islands following China's
declaration of an Air Defense Identification Zone (ADIZ)]{.underline}
which extends over the islands. As the U.S. military has altered its
deployment of nuclear weapons and delivery systems in Asia, Japan has
expressed particular concern over the retirement of the Tomahawk Land
Attack Missile-Nuclear variant (TLAM-N), a nuclear-tipped cruise missile
deployed on Los Angeles-class attack submarines during the Cold War.
Under the 1991-92 "presidential nuclear initiatives," a set of
reciprocal unilateral nuclear arms reduction steps taken by the United
States and the Soviet Union/Russia, TLAM-N was removed from deployment,
but remained in storage at the U.S. Strategic Weapons Facility, Pacific,
in Bangor, Washington and the U.S. Strategic Weapons Facility, Atlantic
in Kings Bay, Georgia.15 [Many Japanese officials argued that, though
the system was not deployed, it still provided a visible symbol of the
U.S. extended nuclear deterrent to Japan, analogous to the role of the
B61 tactical nuclear bomb in NATO. The 2010 NPR formally announced the
retirement of the TLAM-N, and though the decision reportedly raised
concern on the part of a number of Japanese officials, the Japanese
government ultimately did not protest]{.underline}. Outside of the U.S.
extended nuclear deterrent, Japan maintains one of the world's largest
atomic energy programs, considered by many to be a strategic hedge.
Prior to the 2011 Fukishima disaster, Japan received around 30 percent
of its electricity from nuclear power[. While Japan has idled its
reactors in response to Fukishima, it hopes to maintain a robust nuclear
energy program. In contrast to most other non-nuclear weapon states with
large nuclear energy programs, Japan has both uranium enrichment and
reprocessing capabilities, as well as vast stocks of separated
reactor-grade plutonium that could be used in nuclear
weapons]{.underline}.16 Right-wing Japanese officials have referred to
the large stocks of weapons-usable plutonium as a deterrent, and some
states, including South Korea and China, have expressed concern that
Japan is allowed to possess weapons-usable materials. Japan maintains
policy restrictions on nuclear energy. Japan's 1955 Atomic Basic Energy
Law states that "The research, development, and utilization of nuclear
energy shall be limited to peaceful purposes, shall aim at ensuring
safety, and shall be performed independently under democratic
administration, and the results obtained shall be made public so as to
actively contribute to international cooperation."17 In 2012, [this
article was amended to add "national security" as a justification for
preserving a civil nuclear energy program. Responses to the amendment
are varied. Some Japanese officials argue that the addition of "national
security" does not conflict with the commitment to only pursue nuclear
energy for peaceful reasons]{.underline}. Others are more skeptical,
claiming that this change directly conflicts with the constitution.18 If
Japan were to decide to pursue an indigenous nuclear weapons capability,
some estimates suggest that it could create a nuclear weapon in two
years.19 Given this, Japan's nuclear energy program is considered by
some to be a hedge against potential security threats. This hedge is
supplemented by Japan's investment in space-launch vehicles (SLVs),
including the H-11 and Epilson-1, which were developed for Japan's civil
space program.20 The technology of SLVs is very similar to that of
ballistic missiles, and SLVs could be modified to deliver nuclear
weapons. Additionally, Japan has secretly debated the utility of an
indigenous nuclear weapons capability on several occasions, though each
time it concluded that the U.S. extended deterrent was robust enough to
meet Tokyo's security needs. At the same time that Sato advanced
conventional weapons, deterrence and the u.s.-japan alliance 6 was
introducing the "three non-nuclear principles," he was conducting a
secret internal review of the utility of acquiring nuclear weapons. In
1968, Sato's Cabinet Information Research Office commissioned a study on
the costs and benefits of nuclear weapons acquisition, which came to be
known as the 1968/1970 Internal Report. When the report was leaked to
the press in 1994, the reaction was overwhelmingly negative. Powerful
media sources, such as Asahi Shimbun, claimed that Japan's nuclear
policy was two-faced: renouncing nuclear weapons production in public,
while privately considering their utility.21 In the early 1990s,
international concern over North Korea's nascent nuclear weapons
programs increased. In 1995, Japan concluded a second internal report on
the utility of nuclear weapons, which was made public by a prominent
Japanese newspaper in 2003. The report concluded that the development of
nuclear weapons would ultimately be too costly for Japan, due to its
potential to spark a regional arms race in Asia.22 Although Japan could
acquire an indigenous nuclear weapons capability fairly quickly, and has
contemplated doing so, it remains unlikely that Japan will decide to
develop such a capability. Because of the harrowing legacy of Hiroshima
and Nagasaki, public opinion is vehemently anti-nuclear. Instead, Japan
is investing in conventional capabilities, which are better suited to
the current environment, to enhance Tokyo's security and bolster the
U.S.-Japan alliance.

#### The United states-Japan alliance should exercise troop presence and not have missile defense as a bargaining chip

[[The United States and Japan share the goal]{.mark} that North Korea
should abandon permanently and irreversibly all of its nuclear weapons,
ballistic missiles, and other weapons of mass destruction. Despite the
recent summit diplomacy with the United States and South Korea, North
Korea's nuclear weapons and spectrum of ballistic]{.underline} missiles
remain an extant threat to the security of all three allies. Regardless
of the direction of future talks between the United States and North
Korea, or between the two Koreas, proactive and regularized trilateral
policy coordination among Washington, Tokyo, and Seoul at the most
senior levels of government will ensure more effective diplomacy and
protect the interests of all three allies. Pyongyang seeks to break
these alliances, so we should endeavor to demonstrate that they remain
strong politically and capable militarily.

To better prepare for contingencies, bilateral defense cooperation
between Japan and South Korea should focus on improving information
sharing and servicing of military equipment, which also strengthens each
country's bilateral alliance with the United States. The three allies
should expand trilateral exercises to counter North Korea's nuclear
weapons, ballistic missiles, and proliferation threats. [Most important,
if the negotiations with North Korea go forward into uncharted
territory, including a possible peace treaty, it will be critical [that
the United States, Japan]{.mark}, and South Korea [maintain a united
position and]{.mark} avoid sacrificing any core alliance equities[.
Exercises, troop presence, and missile defense should not be bargaining
chips for unverifiable and incomplete denuclearization promises]{.mark}
from the North because this, in the end, will not make the United
States, Japan, or South Korea more secure.]{.underline}

9\) Launch a Regional Infrastructure Fund

Perhaps the greatest regional challenge for the United States and Japan
is China's growing political and economic influence throughout the
Indo-Pacific region. In particular, China's Belt and Road Initiative is
providing Beijing with substantial leverage, particularly over smaller
states in Southeast Asia, the Indian Ocean, and the Pacific Islands. The
fact is that Asia needs much more investment in infrastructure, and
business is by its nature competitive, but the competition must be open
and rules-based. China's investment in regional infrastructure is often
welcome, but the coercive political and economic leverage it is
creating---and sometimes using---is not. The U.S.-Japan alliance must
demonstrate that it can present an attractive alternative. American and
Japanese support for open societies---functioning legislative bodies,
good governance, and a free press---will help to ensure that states in
the region are free to choose infrastructure investments in an open and
non-coercive environment. In doing so, the United States and Japan
should not seek to match the scope or scale of China's
investments---variously advertised as \$1 trillion to \$8 trillion.
After all, the allies' foreign direct investment in the region is
substantial, but it is primarily driven by private companies and
commercial logic, which is only partly true of China's approach.

For the greatest impact, the United States and Japan should choose to
invest in the most attractive projects and partners in the region.
Regional players want investment, but they also want to avoid debt
traps, corruption, and coercion. Therefore, the allies' commitment to
high-standard investments, employment of local labor, social and
environmental safeguards, open procurement practices, and consistent
return on

investment will remain attractive. The allies should promote these high
standards by utilizing and investing in existing multilateral
institutions---such as the World Bank, Asian Development Bank (ADB), and
Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC)---where the United States and
Japan retain disproportionate influence. One option for demonstrating
this value would be to launch a regional fund for infrastructure and
capacity building, which would allow the United States, Japan, and
others to better coordinate and target their respective investments
throughout the Indo-Pacific. Key partners in such an endeavor should
include Australia, South Korea, India, and New Zealand, among others.

#### U.S-Japanese relations are resilient -- not even Trump could mess them up, the strategic value is too high

There are still ups and down, though [assessments that the Trump-Abe
"bromance" is over are way overblown.]{.underline}

[The Japanese government expressed serious concerns after Trump's
meeting in Singapore with North Korean Supreme Leader Kim
Jong-un]{.underline} on June 12, 2018, fearing the United States would
compromise too much, too quickly. [Those concerns have largely
subsided.]{.underline}

[The Japanese were also wary about U.S. trade, particularly Trump's
refusal of the Transpacific Trade Partnership (TPP) and the White House
tariff policies. On the other hand, Tokyo viewed progress on U.S. trade
negotiations with Mexico and Canada as a promising sign. They are
starting to think Trump could well win his trade war with
China]{.underline}. Tokyo now thinks that through the U.S.-Japan
Economic Dialogue, in the long-run, the two countries will find a path
forward for pro-growth policies for both nations.

[Today, the U.S.-Japan alliance is the cornerstone of the effort sustain
a free and open Indo-Pacific in the face of disruptive Chinese
expansion. The just-released annual Defense of Japan white paper (2018)
concluded that strengthening the alliance is "more important than
ever."]{.underline}

[Critics looking for evidence that the U.S. is withdrawing from the
world stage or doesn't value allies, trade, partnerships and
institutions will need to look elsewhere. The state of the Japanese-U.S.
relationship suggests just the opposite.]{.underline}

This may be bigger than Trump. The two nations have forged bonds beyond
those of just allies. Maybe Trump just knows a good thing when sees it.
