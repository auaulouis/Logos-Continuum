it must be governed by the age-old practice culture of legal
professionals and its immemorial language usage. To determine if the
omission (from the critical May 18 entry) of the turgid phrase, \"and
the same hereby is\", (1) makes it an in futuro ruling - i.e., an
expression of what the judge will or would do at a later stage - or (2)
constitutes an in in praesenti resolution of a disputed law issue, the

[Horrific images of bloodshed from across the world have kept coming all
summer.]{.underline} The photo of five-year-old Omran Daqneesh, in shock
after being dragged from the rubble of his home in Aleppo, stunned the
world, as have images of devastated families made homeless or left in
mourning by Saudi airstrikes on Yemen.

Little Omran exemplified the horror of Syria's lengthy and bloody civil
war. Many people looked at that photo and thought, "I wish could do
something." [This week, in Geneva, a major conference is taking place
that is full of people who do have the power to bring an end to the arms
sales that are making so many suffer.]{.underline}

The Arms Trade Treaty is a relatively new UN treaty. It became
international law in December 2014 and its annual Conference of States
Parties brings together all the governments that have joined the treaty
to debate its implementation and impact. The treaty brings some
much-needed regulation to the \$100bn global arms trade. The elephant in
the room here is the fact that in Yemen civilians are dying every day
because bombs, provided to Saudi Arabia by states sitting around the
table, are being dropped on them.

Earlier this year, campaign group Control Arms analysed arms transfers
to Saudi Arabia in the context of the Yemen crisis. We found nine
parties to the ATT issued licences or carried out arms exports to Saudi
Arabia in 2015: France, Germany, Italy, Montenegro, the Netherlands,
Spain, Sweden, Switzerland and the UK, as well as two signatories,
Turkey and the US. These sales and licences totalled more than US\$25bn
and included bombs, rockets and missiles -- just like those falling on
the people of Yemen.

[Some states, specifically the Netherlands, Switzerland and Sweden, have
tightened up their export controls in response to the crisis in Yemen;
but several, notably the UK, US and France, are continuing with business
as usual,]{.underline} violating the treaty in plain sight. Whether for
profit or diplomatic gain, this is appalling hypocrisy. It is also
illegal. [The UK, in a statement to the conference, confirmed its
unerring commitment to the ATT, and chided those who might criticise
treaty violators because "this could deter others joining". Perhaps not
violating the treaty would be a better way to discourage
criticism.]{.underline}

The ATT prohibits arms deals where there can be reasonable knowledge the
arms will be used in violations of international humanitarian law.
Reports from UN experts,The ATT prohibits arms deals where there can be
reasonable knowledge the arms will be used in violations of
international humanitarian law. Reports from UN experts, human rights
groups and news reports of bombings of schools, hospitals and mosques
could not make this clearer.

**[The arms trade has operated in the shadows for
decades]{.underline}**. With the ATT in force, arms deals may not be
made covertly any more. Each state must submit an annual report that
declares which transfers have been authorised. This week, **[states will
also decide whether these reports should be made public or stay secret.
There should be no question about this. They shouldn't even be given a
choice. Reports must be made publicly available.]{.underline}**

**[Greater transparency can help stop illegal sales, reduce the risk of
arms being diverted to terrorist groups and criminals; stop the flood of
weapons to human rights abusers, and stop the arms that are being used
to violate humanitarian law in too many communities on too many days.
It's time to shine a light on this deadly trade]{.underline}**.

So this week, **[the stakes could not be higher. The arms trade is big
business for many states -- but for so many people around the world it's
so much more. What happens in Geneva is a matter of life or
death.]{.underline}**

Reliance on secret information

**[One of the ways in which the government has been able to claim that
the risk of the misuse of weapons is not a clear risk is through the
reliance on 'sensitive' information that could not be disclosed openly
in court for ostensible national security reasons]{.underline}**. The
judicial review hearing included closed sessions with Special Advocates,
and the judges issued both a public and a closed judgment, having
scrutinised the open source and closed materials. The sources of
sensitive information include operational reporting data from the
Saudi-led coalition, passed to the UK; MOD-sourced imagery; and
intelligence reports and battle damage assessments. [The content of the
sources remains unknown to outside observers and it remains unclear how
it changes the interpretation of the evidence supplied in open
session.]{.underline} There has been no rebuttal of the evidence
supplied by CAAT, and no explanation of how the secret evidence
challenges the claim that there is a 'clear risk' that weapons sold to
Saudi Arabia 'might' be used in serious violations of IHL. There is a
gap in the logic of the government's argument and the judges' judgment.
On the one hand, the judges acknowledged that CAAT's materials suggest
that the Saudiled coalition has violated IHL; on the other, these
materials are 'only part of the picture'. But [there has been no
explanation of how the secret information that 'completes' the picture
changes the significance of the material already in the public
domain]{.underline}---and the Court accepts the government's claim that
it does not have to prove why CAAT is wrong. [This circular,
self-reinforcing logic obscures more than it illuminates]{.underline}.

Of course, **[secrecy and reliance on privileged material are not new
strategies when governments want to deflect criticism]{.underline}**.
[In the arms to Iraq case, ministers 'had deliberately run a changed
policy and kept it secret out of fear that public outcry would force
them to cancel the change if the truth leaked out'.]{.underline} 4 Yet
even though the government used public interest immunity certificates to
try and keep information out of the public eye, the Scott inquiry did
chip away at blanket secrecy. Scott got access to intelligence reports,
which were cited publicly, recorded and published, demonstrating that
'intelligence material, as a category, need not be subject to secrecy'.
5 Davina Miller and Mark Phythian concluded from the Scott inquiry that
'self-imposed secrecy results from an acceptance that only the
government can assess the consequences of disclosure'. 6 They were
talking about Parliament, but the same can be said of the High Court.
The judges accepted the government's claim that it was best placed to
assess the consequences, but the government has a vested interest in
that claim, as its behaviour in relation to other Saudi-related
controversies---such as the calling off of the Serious Fraud Office
inquiry, and the more recent suppression of the report into terrorist
financing---suggests.

[So far, so secret. Yet the mode in which secrecy operates is changing.
Since the 1980s, and in part as a direct result of arms to Iraq, there
have been developments in transparency]{.underline}, as noted
previously. [Whilst information is still limited, more is publicly
available. Combined with social media and the immediacy of circulation
of allegations, news of civilian suffering in Yemen permeates public
consciousness and has generated something of a crisis]{.underline} for
British policy. **[Yet in the flurry of claim and counter-claim, there
remains a black box of government decisionmaking: it remains entirely
opaque how decisions about the threshold of risk are
made.]{.underline}** T[he policy to arm Iraq was secret; the policy to
arm Saudi Arabia is an explicit component of foreign
policy]{.underline}. It is the ramifications of that policy that are
contested, as they fly in the face of the UK's legal obligation to
protect IHL and abide by multilateral arms trade regulations. Extensive
justification and legitimation work must be done so as to try to square
the circle of civilian suffering in Yemen with the desire to support the
Saudis.

[In the arms to Iraq case, there was a deliberate government policy of
misleading]{.underline} Parliament. In the Saudi case[, in addition to
the use of closed sessions to look at secret information, and the
extensive redaction of any materials released into the public domain,
there has also been a rewriting of the official record]{.underline}. In
the last hours of the last day of Parliament in summer 2016, the Foreign
Office issued a set of corrections to its statements about arms exports
to Saudi Arabia, changing its position from one of certainty that the
coalition had not breached IHL, to one of uncertainty---that 'we have
not assessed that there has been a breach'. 7 Media and Parliamentary
furore ensued; yet the government's explanation that a few responses had
been misdrafted was accepted by the High Court judges, who described
them as 'infelicities of expression which, when pointed out, were
[corrected'. Even without wanting to interfere with the actions of the
executive, deeper scrutiny of such a position is surely warranted in
order to assess critically the government's judgment in carrying out its
policy. In addition to suppression, then, there is extensive management
of information**. The issues from the 1980s and 1990s generated by arms
trade scandals---'secrecy, the abuse of power and accountability---the
fundamentals of democratic society' ---remain, but are being mediated in
slightly different ways.**]{.underline}

#### Interrogating policy failures and mechanisms of implementation and enforcement is key to develop an in-depth understanding of legal nuance and techniques and ensure a public capable of challenging political overreach

Conclusion

To return to the original question: [how has an explicit commitment to
humanitarian law failed to protect humanitarian values, and how has a
legal challenge ended up providing a stamp of approval to an arms export
policy that has, to date, contributed to the deaths of thousands of
civilians in Yemen? An important part of the answer is to be found in
the practices illustrated by the judicial review hearing]{.underline}: a
**[flexible interpretation of risk that facilitates rather than
restricts arms exports; a reliance on secret information; and deference
of the court to the executive and to state definitions of the national
interest. In selflimiting their role, under the rubric of attempting to
scrutinise but not interfere, the judges took at face value claims that
should have been opened up for scrutiny. The legal emphasis on
rationality of process took precedence over debate about the substance
of policy goals.]{.underline}** The response from CAAT has been to
appeal the judgment; it remains to be seen how higher courts will treat
their claim, if it is permitted. And it remains to be seen which
parliamentary committees will take up the baton of scrutinising
government arms export policy, and how. [A legal strategy is appealing
to activists for the opportunity it provides to expose government
processes and demonstrate the disjuncture between stated goals and
policy implementation.]{.underline} Yet, it also contains inherent
weaknesses**[: a legal challenge has to rely on process-based arguments
over definitions and implementation, rather than explicit debate about
policy goals. A risk-based framework, even one embedded in the law, can
end up facilitating exports precisely because of the emphasis on
judgment and flexibility.]{.underline}**

[The attempt to set the record straight and challenge denial and
misrepresentation is an important strategy.]{.underline} But, as Stanley
Cohen argues in relation to knowledge about atrocities, [trying to
expose the contradictions involved in denials 'misses the point \... The
contradictory elements form a deep structure: their relationship to each
other is ideological, rather than logical']{.underline}. 9 Many of the
**[moves seen in the judicial review are classic repertoires of action
to deflect criticism and deny responsibility for atrocities, in a form
of interpretive denial---that is, not outright denial that extensive
civilian harm has taken place in the war in Yemen, but that 'what
happened is not what you think it is']{.underline}**. 10 In such an
account, yes, there have been civilian deaths, but their cause and
meaning is unclear, and the Saudi military is fighting Iran-backed
Houthi rebels who must be stopped at all costs, and therefore there is
not a clear risk that arms exports will be misused. The irony is that
the judges openly stated during the hearing that ['the role of the Court
can properly take into account that there is an expectation, consistent
with democratic values, that a person charged with making assessments of
this kind should be politically responsible for them']{.underline}.
[With this decision, accountability and political responsibility just
got further away]{.underline}.
