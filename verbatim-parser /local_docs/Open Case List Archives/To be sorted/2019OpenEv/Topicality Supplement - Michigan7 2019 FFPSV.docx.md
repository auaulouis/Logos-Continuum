IV\. CONCLUSIONS

What are the lessons to be drawn for implementation by the Executive
when Congress attempts to legislate foreign policy? [[The history of
section 502B]{.mark}]{.underline} is a case study of executive
frustration of congressionally mandated foreign policy and [[underlines
the need]{.underline}]{.mark}, particularly with this kind of
legislation, [[for **clearer** directives]{.mark}, less discretion, and
more assiduous]{.underline} congressional [oversight. While these
observations emerge from experience [in]{.mark} the human rights area,
they are relevant to other congressional [attempts to influence]{.mark}
the Executive\'s [conduct]{.mark} of foreign policy]{.underline}. They
are especially apt when congressional objectives may require decisions
that displease particular governments and that will therefore be
resisted by the Foreign Service bureaucracy whose paramount interest is
maintaining cordial relations. For example, conclusions about the
effectiveness of legislation conditioning security assistance on human
rights practices are likely to be highly relevant to legislation
conditioning nuclear exports on practices with respect to nuclear
proliferation.

[[Congress has the most **decisive impact** when its directives
allow]{.underline}]{.mark} the Executive [[**no discretion at
all**,]{.mark} [as in]{.mark} the [country-specific legislation stating
precisely which governments are to be denied]{.mark}]{.underline}
military aid and [[arms sales]{.underline}]{.mark} on human rights
grounds. On the other hand, [[when]{.mark}ever [the statute permits
any]{.mark} exercise of [discretion at all]{.mark}, the career [Foreign
Service is likely to use it to attempt to thwart]{.mark} congressional
[objectives]{.mark}.]{.underline}

[[Precision]{.underline}]{.mark} in a statute, of course, [[is a matter
of degree]{.mark} and some provisions allow considerably more discretion
than others. **[No one should be surprised at the bureaucracy\'s lack of
enthusiasm for implementing a vaguely worded general
directive]{.mark}**. Given its \"clientist\" impulse, the Foreign
Service can be expected,]{.underline} for example, [to ignore a
statutory directive]{.underline} that the United States \"disassociate
itself from governments that violate internationally recognized human
rights.\" [[In such a provision,]{.mark} the **[means of]{.mark}**
**[disassociation are unspecified]{.mark}** and left to the diplomat to
choose]{.underline}. [[Disassociation]{.underline}]{.mark}, moreover[[,
is set forth as]{.mark}]{.underline} only [[one]{.underline}]{.mark}
foreign policy [[goal]{.underline}]{.mark}, which presumably may give
way to other objectives when, in the judgment of the bureaucracy, the
national interest so requires.

But [compared to such a hypothetical statute, [section 502B is a **model
of precision**]{.mark}. [The **means for achieving disassociation** are
particularized both by the clear, **unambiguous definition**]{.mark} of
security assistance [and by the requirement that it be denied in
**specific cases**]{.mark}]{.underline}. The disassociation objective is
ranked relative to other foreign policy goals, and it is to be paramount
whenever the other government \"engages in a consistent pattern of gross
violations\" and \"extraordinary circumstances\" are absent. While both
these phrases do have considerable elasticity, it should also be clear
that the arbitrary imprisonment, summary execution, and torture of
thousands of people amount to a \"consistent pattern\" and that a mere
desire for cordial relations without more is not \"extraordinary\" by
any reasonable standard. Yet the Foreign Service consistently argued the
contrary and resisted attempts to apply section 502B to deny military
aid or arms sales in nearly every instance when its application was
urged. In other words, **[[giving the Foreign Service any discretion at
all is to invite its abuse]{.underline}]{.mark}**.

There are, perhaps, some drawbacks to statutes that deny all discretion,
such as the country-specific legislation. Once such a provision is
enacted, the Executive lacks the flexibility to respond quickly to
changed conditions. 31 While Congress has a legitimate role to play in
setting basic foreign policy goals, it may be less well equipped to make
day-to-day decisions about how best to fulfill those goals in specific
cases. Its members, by and large, are not specialists in foreign
affairs, and they generally lack the detailed knowledge and expertise
required to make careful assessments of human rights practices and
United States interests or to balance the benefits and costs of
providing military aid or selling arms to a particular government.132

For these reasons, a general rule that sets forth basic goals may be
preferable to country-specific legislation. Yet the history of section
502B suggests that [[the creation or tightening of a general rule
will]{.mark} [produc]{.mark}]{.underline}[e]{.mark}, by itself,
**[[little change]{.underline}]{.mark}** in executive behavior.
[[Special implementing mechanisms are required if a substantive rule is
to have a direct influence on decisions]{.mark}. Because the career
bureaucracy can be expected to abuse the discretion allowed by a general
rule, **[a countervailing center of bureaucratic influence is essential
to implementation.]{.mark}**]{.underline}

[When Congress does provide an implementing mechanism, implementation
will still be highly dependent on the attitudes of high political
officials.]{.underline} If they are hostile, [even a general rule
written with a high degree of precision will probably have little impact
on executive decisions]{.underline}. The career Foreign Service will
exert no influence on political appointees to implement the law, and the
Bureau of Human Rights can be effectively neutralized. The Assistant
Secretary is a presidential appointee, and a hostile administration can
either select someone to fill the position who will not push for
implementation or simply leave the post vacant. [In such a case,
[country-specific legislation is the only effective means for]{.mark}
[Congress directly to influence specific decisions on]{.mark} military
aid and [arms sales]{.mark}.]{.underline}

Even when a hostile administration disregards section 502B, the Statute
may serve as an affirmation by Congress that disassociation from
repressive governments is a desirable goal of U.S. foreign policy. It
reinforces the idea that military ties with such governments can impose
considerable costs and should not be pursued unless they are the only
available means of securing especially important national interests.
[Its existence legitimates efforts by Congress to enact legislation that
prohibits]{.underline} military aid and [arms sales to specific
countries. It may also focus the attention of journalists, scholars, and
the interested public on executive decisions that would otherwise escape
scrutiny]{.underline}.

#### Violation -- The affirmative does not specify \[DCS and/or FMS, countries/weapon systems/means by which reduction occurs\].

#### Precision -- Legal clarity is a prerequisite to an informed discussion about arms sales. Understanding the complexities of the bureacracy is necessary for topic education

By way of a few introductory remarks, [I am familiar with the
complexities of [US arms export laws and policy, as well as the
regulatory framework]{.mark}]{.underline}. There [[is
a]{.underline}]{.mark} legitimate need for periodic updates of the USML
and---in view of [the **[labyrinth of entangled laws, regulations, and
agencies]{.mark}** involved in the current system]{.underline}---I am
supportive of the reform initiative. I am generally more concerned about
keeping weapons out of the hands of those who would misuse them than in
making them easier to procure, but that end is not at odds with the
objective of putting in place a single control list and a single
administrative agency. The reform effort [has not
progressed]{.underline} to that point, however, and I am wary about
these proposed regulatory changes as an interim step. I will also add
that I have been following the export control reform project since it
was announced in 2009 and this is the only time I have felt the need to
express concerns about the proposed changes. That is largely due to the
particular, complete and recognizable, weapons that are being considered
for change.

1\. I urge you to delay the effective date of the proposed changes until
the Government Accounting Office or the Library of Congress has publicly
reported to the Congress their impact on numerous statutes referring to
"defense articles."

If enacted, the changes would have implications for several provisions
of law. From my reading of both sets of proposed regulations, I am not
reassured that the implications have been fully considered. [[The USML
is formally defined in the AECA]{.underline}]{.mark} (22 USC 2778) [[as
a definitive list of defense articles]{.mark},]{.underline}1
[and]{.underline} from a quick search of US statutes [[the term "defense
article" appears in]{.mark} some **[45 sections,]{.mark}**]{.underline}2
[in many instances (but not always) explicitly linked to the
USML]{.underline}. In addition, [several provisions of the AECA itself
are explicitly linked to an item's presence on the USML (without
necessarily referring to "defense articles").]{.underline} [[On a
separate]{.mark} statutory [track]{.mark}, [the Foreign Assistance Act
was recently amended to include CCL 600 series items as defense
articles]{.mark}]{.underline}, along with all items contained on the
USML \[22 USC 2304.(d)(2)(C)\], [[but the legislation did not anticipate
the new 500 series so there is **likely a gap**]{.mark} there with
regards to Congressional intentions. [To complicate things
further,]{.mark} [the]{.mark} US Munitions Import List ([USMIL) makes
liberal use of the term "defense article,"]{.mark} defined as articles
on the USMIL]{.underline}--which currently include the same items that
are slated to lose the "defense article" designation that extends from
inclusion on the USML -- [[so that items designated as defense articles
on the USMIL will not be considered defense articles for purposes of
export]{.underline}]{.mark}.3

[**[It is very challenging to sort out the tangle]{.mark}**. Some of the
instances [where terms and definitions are at variance may]{.mark} not
prove significant, but others may [have **far-reaching implications**.
Due to the disparate definitions and linkages]{.mark},]{.underline} the
proposal to remove specified firearms from [[the USML
raises]{.underline}]{.mark} some [**[important questions]{.mark}**
[about the continuing applicability of provisions of law that refer to
"defense articles,]{.mark}]{.underline}" a term that currently
encompasses such firearms. In numerous situations the current statutory
treatment of nonautomatic firearms would be altered -- or at least
become ambiguous---as a result simply of moving these weapons from
Category I of the USML to the 500-series on CCL. Statutory provisions
that could be affected by the proposed change range from Export-Import
Bank financing of defense article sales to human rights conditionality
on security assistance, to the provisions for third-party transfer of
grantsupplied defense articles, and various reports to Congress. (See
references in the footnote below.4 [) In some cases, the law in question
is not directly linked to arms exports, but the relevant statute refers
to defense articles and links the definition to items on the
USML]{.underline}. In this way, removing specified firearms from the
USML is likely to have a host of unintended and unanticipated
repercussions.

Further, if semi-automatic weapons and other non-automatic firearms are
removed from the USML it will impact the ability of law enforcement to
charge weapons traffickers with violating the AECA as was done in
several of the cases cited in a recent report from the Department of
Justice on export enforcement.5

As Acting Assistant Secretary for Political-Military Affairs Tina
Kaidanow explained to the House Foreign Affairs Committee last June,6
[[the US arms export architecture is very complex and
involves]{.underline}]{.mark} what her predecessors have described as
[["cradle to grave" oversight of exported US defense
articles]{.underline}]{.mark}. Removing that designation defense article
from weapons that are not fully automatic has the effect of detaching
them from the US Munitions List and the regulatory framework built
around it: there may well be significant unintended consequences.

In the event that consideration of the proposals is not delayed, I would
recommend several other changes to the proposed ITAR and EAR revisions.

2\. Retain existing USML I(a) and (d) unchanged; retain the existing
coverage of USML II(a) unchanged; delete proposed 0A501.a and .b; and
limit proposed 0A502 to renumbering existing 0A984. My concern here is
based on principle and definition.

Several of the weapons that would be moved to CCL are military-style
weapons that are either used in battlefield situations or are
substantially comparable to weapons as used in battlefield situations --
including semi-automatic assault rifles and bolt-action sniper rifles.
All of USML I(a), I(d), and II(a) are currently designated "significant
military equipment" due to "their capacity for substantial military
utility or capability," per the ITAR definition.7 The prevalence of
armed extremists and insurgents who depend on weapons currently included
in USML Categories I and II makes the military utility or capability of
these weapons as relevant as ever. Due to their size and long shelf
life, firearms are easily diverted and resold on black markets around
the world. The Department of Justice's January 2018 summary of major US
export enforcement cases noted above includes recent smuggling of
semi-automatic assault rifles (and other firearms) to Dominican
Republic, the Gambia, Russia via Latvia, Thailand and other
destinations. In addition, the report documents the case of two men in
Georgia attempting to export firearms to a range of international on the
dark net, and another similar case from Kansas.8

While the US military may not derive great advantage from most of these
weapons, they still have the military utility and capability of
threatening the lives and welfare of many people around the world. It is
in the interest of the US and American citizens to keep the tightest
control on them. Indeed, it is for that very reason that the same
weapons being proposed for removal from the US Munitions List are
expected to remain on the US Munitions Import List, where their entry
into the US will remain tightly controlled. It is also for that reason
that a growing number of states are imposing limitations on the retail
availability of these weapons and many retailers are voluntarily
removing them from their shelves. They should remain where they are, on
the USML.

3\. Before proposed regulatory changes are adopted, an opinion should be
obtained from the Department of Justice concerning the legality of
applying ITAR brokering restrictions to exports of firearms transferred
from the USML to the CCL. Furthermore, [Congress and the public should
be informed as to how the proposed arrangements will address the risk of
diversion.]{.underline}

There are several reasons to be concerned about the proposed rules
pertaining to brokering. From their origin in the 1930s, a major intent
of efforts to regulate arms exports has been to curtail illicit and
undesirable trafficking in weapons. In the 1980s and 1990s, illicit
flows of small arms flooded international markets, with calamitous
effects in every region of the world. The rate of flow may have slowed
since the 1990s, but as the 2018 Justice Department report attests, the
efforts to supply contraband firearms are very much alive in our own
time. From a global perspective, brokering laws are considered a weak
link in the regulatory apparatus, to the extent that in the 1990s there
was some talk of negotiating an international treaty focused entirely on
arms brokering. Provisions written into US law around that time were
considered some of the strongest in the world. With the transfer of
specified semi-automatic and nonautomatic weapons to CCL, the brokering
laws would no longer be applied to these weapons (or would be applied
only in a much-weakened version) and they would not be available to law
enforcement for prosecution purposes.

My specific concerns with the proposal to apply existing AECA/ITAR
brokering rules to items intended for transfer to the CCL are twofold,
related to the dubious statutory underpinnings of the proposed rule
change and to its practical implications.

\(a\) **[[The first concern is a matter of statutory coherence and
proper statutory authority]{.underline}]{.mark}**. The brokering clauses
of the AECA require commercial brokers involved in the transfer of
defense articles to register with the State Department and apply for
their transactions to be licensed (22 USC 2778).9 [The AECA brokering
provisions are explicitly linked to defense articles on the
USML]{.underline} (and by implication, ITAR). Because the proposed
changes to ITAR and CCL would remove specified non-automatic and
semiautomatic firearms from the USML, on the face of it, it would seem
that commercial brokers of these items would be released from ITAR
registration and brokering requirements. To prevent this outcome, the
State Department proposes a patch, by asserting that the AECA brokering
provisions will also apply to the US Munitions Import List (which, as
noted above, will continue to include the items that---for export
purpose---are deemed no longer to warrant control under the USML). The
intended effect is that brokers wanting to export items included on the
list of items controlled as defense articles for import (but not for
export) will be subject to the rules pertaining to the export of such
items. The logic is convoluted at best, and it raises questions about
the statutory grounding for requiring brokers who are exporting items
"no longer warranting control under USML" to register with the State
Department and comply with related ITAR requirements[. [Given the
complexity of the issue]{.mark} and the risks associated with brokering
activities, [it would seem advisable]{.mark} and prudent [to **seek a
legal opinion**]{.mark}]{.underline} within the Executive Branch [[to
ensure that the provisions of the AECA pertaining to
brokers]{.underline}]{.mark}---including the registration requirement\--
[[can be applied robustly]{.mark} to all involved in the wide range of
brokering activities associated with the export of items]{.underline} on
the US Munitions Import List.10 [[Such a legal opinion]{.mark} [should
be]{.mark} obtained and [considered **before the regulatory changes are
adopted**]{.mark}.]{.underline}

\(b\) The second issue about brokering rules relates to the practical
effects of the numerous proposed changes to ITAR section 129. It is hard
to imagine, in the first place, the steps by which the licensing of a
transaction will be handled by Commerce and any brokering aspects
(including completion of information required by 22 CFR 129.6) will be
handled by State. It boggles the mind to consider how this might
actually amount to a time-saving simplification of rules. I am primarily
concerned about the proposed amendment 129.2(b)(2)(vii), however, which
appears to negate the controls on brokering for transactions subject to
EAR and open a significant loophole for unscrupulous brokers. If I have
understood the proposed changes to Section 129.2 correctly, if a
Michigan-based retail sports outlet licensed to sell firearms in the US
wanted to sell, say, AR-15 semi-automatic rifles to clients in another
country, then so long as the Michigan retailer could secure approval via
the BIS licensing process, the various parties involved in shipment,
financing, and possibly transshipment would be exempt from any
registration and approval requirements. Nor would they necessarily be
known to licensing and enforcement agents based in the Commerce
Department. What in this scenario would deter an unknown and independent
handler from diverting the weapons to unauthorized end-users? [I would
like to assume that government officials in the State and Commerce
Departments have thought through the implications of the proposed rules
as they might be bent for nefarious purpose as well as their service for
industry cost and convenience]{.underline}, but the published rules do
not provide assurance in that regard. [[More clarification is needed
about how the brokering regulations will be applied, how the
inter-agency process will be managed, and]{.mark} the extent to which
the [proposed arrangements for registering and licensing brokers
involved in acquiring, financing and transporting exported
firearms]{.mark} will address the risk of diversion to non-authorized
end-users]{.underline}. One effect of transferring non-automatic
firearms from the USML to the CCL is to remove them from the remit of
the State Department's Blue Lantern program, which otherwise might be
engaged to make post-shipment checks. It is not clear whether Commerce
has a comparable program or what resources it will assign to monitoring
the commerce in semi-automatic firearms.

#### Ground -- The neg loses access to process CPs that are the heart of [topic-specific education]{.underline}. Only our interpretation [structurally incentivizes]{.underline} students to learn about the [process of reducing arms sales]{.underline} instead of recycling outdated backfiles. Normal means-based strategies are unpredictable and allow the aff to shift the goal posts.

#### Extra-T -- As written, the plan text, includes reductions in non-FMS and non-DCS of arms. Linguistic slippage allows systematic distortion of the lit base -- results in [implicit mechanism expansion]{.underline}. Disincentivizes in-depth research and justifies unpredictable advantages. Vote neg to affirm [strict norms]{.underline} to deter lazy

#### Interpretation -- arms sales are solely driven by statutes, regulations, and policies executed by the Department of Defense and Department of State

Political-Military Affairs at the Department of State) June **2017**
"Foreign Military Sales: Process and Policy" Testimony to Congress
https://www.state.gov/foreign-military-sales-process-and-policy/

Overall Framework

Our approach to [[arms sales is driven by **statute, regulations, and
policy**]{.underline}]{.mark}.

[[The key statutes]{.underline}]{.mark} through which we conduct arms
transfers [[are the]{.underline}]{.mark} Foreign Assistance Act of 1961,
as amended ([[FAA), and the]{.underline}]{.mark} Arms Export Control
Act, as amended ([[AECA]{.underline}]{.mark}).

• Pursuant to section 622(c) of the FAA, the Secretary of State is
responsible for the continuous supervision and general direction of
military assistance and military education and training programs,
including whether there shall be such assistance for a country. It is
through this authority that the Department of State approves the
transfer of Excess Defense Articles (EDA) under section 516 of the FAA.
Such transfers must be consistent with section 502 of the FAA, which
provides that defense articles and defense services may be furnished to
a foreign government only for specific purposes, including internal
security, legitimate self-defense, and to permit the recipient country
to participate in regional or collective arrangements or measures
consistent with the Charter of the United Nations.

• Section 1 of the AECA authorizes "sales by the United States
Government to friendly countries having sufficient wealth to maintain
and equip their own military forces at adequate strength, or to assume
progressively larger shares of the costs thereof, without undue burden
to their economies, in accordance with the restraints and control
measures specified herein and in furtherance of the security objectives
of the United States and of the purposes and principles of the United
Nations Charter." Pursuant to section 2 of the AECA, "under the
direction of the President, the Secretary of State (taking into account
other United States activities abroad, such as military assistance,
economic assistance, and food for peace program) shall be responsible
for the continuous supervision and general direction of sales, leases,
financing, cooperative projects, and exports under this Act, including,
but not limited to, determining -- (1) whether there will be a sale to
or financing for a country and the amount thereof; (2) whether there
will be a lease to a country; (3) whether there will be a cooperative
project and the scope thereof; and (4) whether there will be delivery or
other performance under the sale, lease, cooperative project, or export,
to the end that sales, financing, leases, cooperative projects, and
exports will be integrated with other United States activities and to
the end that the foreign policy of the United States would be best
served thereby." Section 4 of the AECA provides the purposes for which
defense articles and defense services may be sold or leased, which
include internal security and legitimate self-defense.

• The AECA also authorizes the President, in "furtherance of world peace
and the security and foreign policy of the United States" to "control
the import and the export of defense articles and defense services." The
AECA requires that decisions on issuing export licenses for defense
articles and defense services "take into account whether the export of
an article would contribute to an arms race, aid in the development of
weapons of mass destruction, support international terrorism, increase
the possibility of outbreak or escalation of conflict, or prejudice the
development of bilateral or multilateral arms control or
nonproliferation agreements or other arrangements."

•There are also a number of restrictions that apply to arms transfers in
the AECA, FAA, other statutes, or that apply through regulation or
United Nations sanctions.

• We are further bound by our commitments to a number of international
export control regimes, such as the Missile Technology Control Regime
and the Wassenaar Arrangement.

[[Under the AECA, there are three]{.mark} main [authorities through
which the]{.mark} **[U]{.mark}**nited **[S]{.mark}**tates [can provide
defense articles or services to another country]{.mark}:
government-to-government Foreign Military Sales ([FMS)]{.mark}; licensed
exports of direct commercial sales ([DCS]{.mark});]{.underline} [[and
the lease of defense articles]{.underline}]{.mark}. We are also
authorized to provide EDA under the FAA and to approve third-party
transfer requests under both the AECA and the FAA.

[A variety of regulations apply to these programs. [On the FMS side,
government-to-government sales are implemented by the Department of
Defense]{.mark}, and the Federal Acquisition Regulation and the Defense
Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement apply to all
programs]{.underline}. Admiral Rixey will address this in more detail.
[[On the DCS side, my Bureau manages the]{.mark} International Traffic
in Arms Regulations [(ITAR), which implements part of Section 38 of the
AECA]{.mark}]{.underline}, authorizing the President to control the
export, temporary import, and brokering of defense articles and defense
services. Permanent imports of defense articles pursuant to section 38
of the AECA are regulated by the Department of Justice's Bureau of
Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives.

#### Courts can't reduce arms sales --- only [declare]{.underline} a statute or regulation [unenforcable]{.underline}

Unlike the Supreme Court, several state courts have explicitly addressed
the revival issue. The relevant state court cases have concerned the
specific issue of whether a statute that has been held unconstitutional
is revived when the invalidating decision is overturned.42 With one
exception, [they have concluded that such statutes are immediately
enforceable]{.underline}. The most noted instance in which the revival
issue was resolved by a court involved the District of Columbia minimum
wage statute pronounced unconstitutional in Adkins. After the Court
reversed Adkins in West Coast Hotel, President Roosevelt asked Attorney
General Homer Cummings for an opinion on the status of the District of
Columbia\'s statute. The Attorney General responded, The decisions are
practically in accord in holding that the [[courts have no power to
repeal or abolish a statute,]{.mark} and that notwithstanding a decision
holding it unconstitutional a statute continues to remain on the statute
books]{.underline}; [and that [if a statute be declared unconstitutional
and the decision so declaring it be subsequently overruled the statute
will then be held valid from the date it became
effective]{.mark}]{.underline}.43 Enforcement of the statute followed
without congressional action.44 When this enforcement was challenged,
the Municipal Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia injawish v.
Morlet 45 held that the decision in West Coast Hotel had had the effect
of making the statute enforceable. The court observed that previous
opinions addressing the revival issue proceed on the principle that
[[a]{.mark} [statute declared unconstitutional is void in the sense that
it is]{.mark} inoperative or [unenforceable]{.mark}]{.underline}[, [but
not void in the sense that it is repealed or
abolished]{.underline}]{.mark}; **[that so long as the decision stands
the statute is dormant but not dead]{.underline}**; and that if the
decision is reversed the statute is valid from its first effective date

For the second question, the provision demonstrates that the goal of
adoption of such laws and regulations must be to 'prevent, reduce, and
control' MPLA. In so doing, the LOSC obliges States to 'taking into
account internationally agreed rules, standards, and recommended
practices and procedures'.480 Having considered the ordinary meanings of
the term 'prevent, reduce, and control', ['[prevent' means 'to
stop]{.underline}]{.mark} [something from happening]{.underline} [or
[someone from doing something]{.mark}]{.underline}.'481 [[The word
'reduce' means 'to make something smaller in]{.mark}]{.underline} size,
[[amount]{.underline}]{.mark}, degree, importance etc.'482 and the word
'control' means 'to order, limit, or rule something or someone\'s
actions or behaviour.' 483 From the meanings, [[the term 'prevent'
suggests an action to **stop the future
occurrence**]{.mark}]{.underline} of something,
[[whereas]{.underline}]{.mark} the terms '[[reduce]{.underline}']{.mark}
and 'control', noting their difference, [[point to an action dealing
with something that **has already happened** and **continues** to
occur,]{.underline} [but needs to be made smaller]{.underline}]{.mark},
limited or regulated. Also, control also applies to future pollution in
the sense that it limits the future pollution to be created or emitted
not to exceed the specified level. Therefore, the preliminary reading of
these terms suggests that laws and regulations adopted to deal with MPLA
must yield the result that conforms with these terms. In so doing, the
adoption of laws and regulations to prevent, reduce, and control MPLA
can be done by legislating primary or secondary regulations with the use
of various legal techniques and procedures and are underpinned by some
rules and principles of international law discussed in the previous
chapter. These legal techniques and procedures can be used to achieve
the prevention, reduction and control of MPLA depending on the design
and use of them. Noting that the measures outlined below are not
exhaustive and not exclusively limited to implement any specific
obligation, these are typical legal techniques and procedures used to
prevent, reduce, and control pollution and therefore protect the
environment. They can be categorised into two groups, that is, (1)
substantive and (2) procedural legal techniques and measures. They can
be discussed hereunder.

#### Violation- the aff fiats the federal judiciary.

#### Vote Neg:

#### Ground -- All negative offense is predicated on a reduction in arm sales, only fiating courts opens the door to affs that don't reduce sales but claim perception-based spillover advantages based on [legal signal]{.underline} rather than the [reduction in sales]{.underline}. 

#### Limits -- Expanding aff fiat to the federal judiciary generates an unmanagable number of cases by adding unpredictable procedural affirmative mechanisms to access advantages. That short-circuits education and makes adequate negative preparation impossible.

### precision good -- general

#### Precision is prerequisite to education

**Resnick 1** \[Evan Resnick, Journal of International Affairs,
0022197X, Spring 2001, Vol. 54, Issue 2, "Defining Engagement"\]

In matters of national security, establishing [a clear definition of
terms is a precondition]{.underline} for effective policymaking.
[Decisionmakers who invoke critical terms in an erratic, ad hoc fashion
risk]{.underline} alienating their constituencies. They also risk
[exacerbating misperceptions]{.underline} and hostility among those the
policies target. [Scholars who commit the same error undercut their
ability to conduct valuable empirical research]{.underline}. Hence, if
scholars and policymakers fail rigorously to define \"engagement,\" they
undermine the ability to build an effective foreign policy.

#### Precise wording in legislation is essential to preserve the intent of the plan

Turatsinze 12 (Elias Turatsinze 2012
<https://sas-space.sas.ac.uk/4711/1/Elias_Turatsinze_LLM_ALS_Dissertation.pdf>)

[Precision is traditionally viewed as the main goal of common law
drafters]{.underline} who make the greatest effort [to "say all, to
define all": to leave nothing to the imagination]{.underline}: never to
presume upon the reader's intelligence.31 [In legislative drafting,
precision requires choosing correct words and maintaining their
grammatical sense. This avoids uncertainty in the meaning of words or
sentences, which in turn affects construction of statutes]{.underline}.
In United Kingdom, this point was succinctly expressed by Lord Bridge of
Harwich as follows: "The courts' traditional approach to construction,
giving primacy to the ordinary, grammatical meaning of statutory
language, is reflected in the parliamentary draftsman's technique of
using language with the at most precision to express the legislative
intent of his political masters and it remains the golden rule of
constructions that a statute means exactly what it says and does not
mean what it does not say."32 Bridge's assertion indicates that [courts
are primarily concerned with statutory words before resorting to other
cannons of construction]{.underline}. Thus, [whenever, a court seeks to
understand the legislative intent, the first thing it does is to read
the law]{.underline}. The court proceeds to other methods of
construction, only if the wording of the law does not permit to
understand the legislative intent. [The drafter should therefore ensure
precision in expressing the legislative intent, so as to minimize the
possibility of applying other methods of construction which at times may
disfavour realisation of the legislator's objective]{.underline}.

The truth is, [if a contract is drafted precisely]{.underline},
[conversations]{.underline} like that shouldn't happen because the term
"photocopier" [would be defined precisely in a way that both sides had
agreed on]{.underline} (indeed **[there would be a defined term in the
contract]{.underline}**). [This is especially important]{.underline} in
a sourcing contract [where the]{.underline} type and number of
"photocopiers" (and the [number and type]{.underline} of copies or
images produced by those "photocopiers") [could form the basis for the
pricing of the deal]{.underline}. Later in that same deposition, the
Deponent revealed that he referred to those devices as "Xerox" machines
and the process of making a copy "Xeroxing," regardless of whether the
machine involved was actually manufactured by Xerox. [If the contract
were prepared]{.underline} using this terminology **[without the benefit
of a precise definition]{.underline}** of "photocopiers" (including, for
example, whether one or more manufacturers' models were intended), [it's
possible that someone attempting to interpret the contract might
consider]{.underline} only "Xerox" machines as being in
[scope]{.underline}. Later on, if Fuji or Canon machines were discovered
in the customer's environment, a change order might be required for the
service provider to support them (which might include an associated
change in pricing and service levels). Among other things, the job of
the lawyer is to make sure that the intentions of the parties are
captured (and clearly stated) in the contract. So, for example, [someone
who was not involved in the deal should understand the contract to mean
the same thing as the people who entered into it in the first
place]{.underline}. Although [it may]{.underline}, at times, [seem like
a deliberate focus on terms such as these slows down the
process,]{.underline} [the]{.underline} upfront [investment]{.underline}
to clearly define the terms associated with scope, pricing and service
levels [can decrease the likelihood of disputes]{.underline} (or
unintended changes) down the road -- [making the relationship more
likely to be successful]{.underline}.

[Congress has the most decisive impact when its directives allow the
Executive no discretion at all, as in the country-specific legislation
stating precisely which governments are to be denied military aid and
arms sales on human rights grounds.]{.underline} On the other hand,
[whenever the statute permits any exercise of discretion at all, the
career Foreign Service is likely to use it to attempt to thwart
congressional objectives.]{.underline} [Precision in a
statute]{.underline}, of course, [is a matter of degree]{.underline} and
some provisions allow considerably more discretion than others. [No one
should be surprised at the bureaucracy\'s lack of enthusiasm for
implementing a vaguely worded general directive]{.underline}. Given its
\"clientist\" impulse, the Foreign Service can be expected, for example,
to ignore a statutory directive that the United States \"disassociate
itself from governments that violate internationally recognized human
rights.\" In such a provision, the means of disassociation are
unspecified and left to the diplomat to choose. Disassociation,
moreover, is set forth as only one foreign policy goal, which presumably
may give way to other objectives when, in the judgment of the
bureaucracy, the national interest so requires. But compared to such a
hypothetical statute, [section 502B is a model of precision. The means
for achieving disassociation are particularized both by the clear,
unambiguous definition of security assistance and by the requirement
that it be denied in specific cases]{.underline}. The disassociation
objective is ranked relative to other foreign policy goals, and it is to
be paramount whenever the other government \"engages in a consistent
pattern of gross violations\" and \"extraordinary circumstances\" are
absent. While both these phrases do have considerable elasticity, it
should also be clear that the arbitrary imprisonment, summary execution,
and torture of thousands of people amount to a \"consistent pattern\"
and that a mere desire for cordial relations without more is not
\"extraordinary\" by any reasonable standard. Yet the Foreign Service
consistently argued the contrary and resisted attempts to apply section
502B to deny military aid or arms sales in nearly every instance when
its application was urged. In other words, giving the Foreign Service
any discretion at all is to invite its abuse

The United Nations Conference on the Illicit Trade in Small Arms and
Light Weapons in All Its Aspects (July 2001) provides the international
community with an excellent opportunity to reflect on all sorts of arms
transfers in light of today's realities. [[The line between licit and
illicit arms deals is]{.mark} often so [thin]{.mark} as to be invisible.
We must begin to ask ourselves what is more important: legalistic
definitions or principles? When civilians are massacred by a
paramilitary member, rebel group, or army in a civil war, does it matter
if the weapons used were acquired legally]{.underline}? When a woman is
murdered by her ex-soldier husband with his service weapon, does it
matter whether he had a permit to own it? [In principle, I am sure we
would all agree that the answer is "No." Yet, in the real world,
[we]{.mark} do [need legal definitions, as the power of judgment is
vested in our courts, which depend on those definitions, and their
interpretations, to do the business of justice]{.mark}]{.underline}.
[[How]{.mark}, then, [shall we define legal transfers of
weapons]{.mark}? Which transfers are illicit]{.underline}? [These
questions are so far without a convincing answer from the community of
states embodied in the United Nations]{.underline}. The July conference
should be taken as an opportunity to explore these questions and build
consensus around clear and definitive answers. In particular, I would
like to see the UN member states seriously consider the Framework
Convention on International Arms Transfers described in this article. I
believe it presents a potential solution to the problem of definitions
and, more importantly, a viable way of getting the "legal" arms trade
under control. Any death from gun violence is one too many. There is no
time to lose

#### Robust and precise weapons laws are essential 

**Stohl 17** (Rachel Stohl AIP 11/15/17

<https://aip.scitation.org/doi/pdf/10.1063/1.5009220>)

Elements of a National Arms Control System • Arms Trade Legislation:
[Legal instruments, in the form of laws or decrees, serve to provide
government authorities the legal basis to register and license weapons
producers, brokers, traders, transporters, and owners]{.underline} --
[as well as to authorize individual weapons transaction.]{.underline} •
Licensing Procedures: Licensing procedures work to control the export,
import, re-export, transit, and transshipment of weapons into, out of,
and through national territory, including brokering activities. •
[Export Criteria and Control Lists: Arms control lists detail those
weapons and weapons systems that are subject to licensing procedures and
must be authorized by government authorities]{.underline}. Lists of
controlled goods also include lists of proscribed destinations, such as
those subject to an arms embargo. [Export criteria based on
international norms and standards help to determine whether a weapons
transfer should be authorized]{.underline}. End-user criteria such as
respect for human rights, involvement in armed conflict, involvement in
terrorist activities, and level of democratic development are often
considered when making licensing decisions.

#### Legal precision and specificity in arms sales law is key to justify and enforce reductions

Stephen **Cohen** (Associate Professor of Law at Georgetown Unvieristy,
Former Deputy Assistant Secretary of State for Human Rights and Security
Assistance (1978-1980)) **1982** "CONDITIONING U.S. SECURITY ASSISTANCE
ON HUMAN RIGHTS PRACTICES" 76 Am. J. Int'l L. 246 (1982)
https://scholarship.law.georgetown.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=2605&context=facpub

The substantive standard of section 502B differed from that of section
32 in three important respects. First, the statute used the term
\"security assistance\" (rather than \"military assistance\"), and this
new term was defined to include sales of arms for cash as well as
military aid.28 [Second, it changed the category of relevant human
rights violations from \"internment or imprisonment\" for \"political
purposes\" to \"torture,\" \"prolonged detention without charges,\" and
other inhuman treatment]{.underline}. 29 [By replacing a status that
lacked a precise definition with specific practices, Congress appears to
have been responding directly to Ingersoll\'s complaint that the
violations under section 32 had been too difficult to define
objectively.]{.underline} Third, it attempted to recognize the need for
executive flexibility by providing an \"extraordinary circumstances\"
exception (but at the same time required the President to report to
Congress when exceptions were to be made).

#### Specific definitions clarify legal and program requirements

**Jones Et al. 06** (Seth G. Jones, Olga Oliker, Peter Chalk, C.

Various agencies carry out their own vetting procedures, and while some
of them adopt a "check-the-box" mentality, others are thorough and based
on U.S. officials' desire to ensure that the foreign security forces
they train and work with can be trusted---and that their assistance will
not be misused. But [[the confusion regarding legal requirements and
specific program situations remains]{.mark}, and this is likely to
persist for the foreseeable future]{.underline}. Our analysis suggests
that [[the U.S.]{.mark} government **[needs to improve its vetting
practices]{.mark}** [by making them more consistent across programs and
agencies and standardizing them across different types of
assistance]{.mark}]{.underline}. [Congress can play a critical role by
establishing uniform guidelines and providing further definition
regarding what criteria executive branch agencies should use
in]{.underline} identifying and [vetting]{.underline} both units and
individuals (whose culpability can, after all, tar organizations of
various sizes).

This vignette illustrates the ultimate purpose of U.S. Africa Command
(USAFRICOM). In support of [U.S. foreign policy]{.underline} and as part
of a total U.S. Government effort, USAFRICOM's intent is [to
assist]{.underline} Africans [in providing]{.underline} their own
[security]{.underline} and stability [and helping prevent]{.underline}
the conditions that could lead to [future conflicts.]{.underline} The
command will do this by employing the principle of Active Security,
which governs who we are and what we plan to do. It is the basis for our
theater strategy. The types of activities described above [fall within
the spirit of security assistance]{.underline} as defined in DOD
Publication 5105.38--M, Security Assistance Management Manual, dated
October 2003. [However, these activities did not all follow the strict
definition of "programs, authorized by law, that allows the transfer of
military articles and services to friendly foreign
Governments]{.underline}."1 [While the assistance]{.underline} provided
[did "increase the ability of our friends to]{.underline} . . . help
[foster regional stability," much of the above involved the transfer of
subject matter expertise and not]{.underline} necessarily [the "transfer
of articles or services]{.underline}." [Unfortunately, this has led to a
cultural paradigm where security assistance and the management thereof
are defined and resourced based on a very narrow definition of
"program,"]{.underline} which regards only the sales, grants, leases, or
loans of goods or services that are essential to the security and
economic well-being of allied governments[. As a partner requests a
particular good or service, a program is established or
expanded]{.underline}. Program managers are assigned to execute the
transfer, usually in the form of an Office of Security Cooperation
(OSC).2 When the program is complete, the management mission is
concluded, and the OSC is disbanded or moved But [the real needs of our
partners go beyond receiving goods or services]{.underline}; these
nations are exercising a vision of their security goals and objectives.
[Many of the requirements that emerge are nebulous]{.underline} because
their perspectives are different from ours, although we often have
mutual interests. While [existing program vehicles such as Foreign
Military Sales]{.underline} and International Military Education and
Training (IMET) [can provide means by which our partners can meet
specific objectives, these partners also look to us for]{.underline}
subject matter expertise and other [intangible forms of
assistance]{.underline}. Furthermore, [many of our partners have
security concerns whose resolutions fall outside of the DOD]{.underline}
purview or that overlap multiple U.S. agencies. [The narrow view of
programs reaffirms stovepiped responsibilities, predetermining who
administers a program and causing all others to step aside. The modern
dynamic security environment requires that we address security from a
holistic perspective and integrate our efforts horizontally across the
U.S. Government.]{.underline}

#### Precision is unachievable in the context of arms sales - policies are too incoherent 

**Forsyth 04** (Tim Forsyth, Professor of Environment and Development
"Encyclopedia of International Development," November 15, 2004,

The concept of coherence refers to the deliberate management of
different policies to ensure that they support, rather than undermine,
each other\'s objectives. The term has been used increasingly since the
1990s. [Coherence can be defined either narrowly or
broadly]{.underline}. A narrow definition would be that objectives of
policy in a particular field may not be undermined or obstructed by
actions or activities in this field. This mainly involves here
incoherence between the different objectives and/or instruments of
development policy. [A wide definition would be that objectives of
policy in a particular field may not be]{.underline} undermined or
[obstructed by actions]{.underline} or activities [of
government]{.underline} in that field or in other policy fields. This
broader definition of fields refers to development policy and, in
theory, all parts of policy-making, but [the most common incoherences
could be found in]{.underline} trade, agriculture, human rights and
[**arms trade policies (see arms sales and controls).** Despite these
efforts to achieve coherence, incoherences do occur]{.underline}. [One
cause for incoherences may be the need for governments try and find
optimal]{.underline} - if contradictory - [solutions to the demands

#### Precision in measuring the arms trade is impossible -- no common definitions or transparency and varying data 

**Holtom and Bromley 10** (July 2010, Paul Holtom is a researcher at the

Dual-Use and Arms Trade Control Programme, "The International Arms
Trade: Difficult to Define, Measure, and Control",
<https://www.armscontrol.org/act/2010_07-08/holtom-bromley>) MT

As has been shown in the past, [financial resources]{.underline}---from
domestic budgets or foreign military assistance---[are not the only
factor that influences arms acquisitions]{.underline}. [Perceived
internal or external threats to national security, the need to replace
or upgrade military inventories, demonstrations of international status,
development of domestic arms industries via licensed production and
offsets, the desire to strengthen ties with suppliers, and the influence
of the military play important roles in the arms acquisition
process.]{.underline} Before permitting exports of arms and military
equipment, suppliers will assess the potential economic gains and the
potential impact of the transfer on their strategic interests and
foreign policy. Will the transfer harm or help friendly states or the
supplier's international commitments, reputation, or standing? For
several reasons, [**there is no straightforward answer to the question,
"How big is the international arms trade**?"]{.underline} First, [there
is **no globally agreed definition of "arms."**]{.underline} States and
international organizations that seek to measure or control the arms
trade use lists of items that vary in their complexity and coverage,
most notably with regard to their inclusion of "dual-use goods," items
with both military and civilian applications.1 Second, [there is **no
common agreement on what types of activities constitute the arms
trade.** Examples of areas where differences exist include arms leased
to other states; gifts and donations; the transfer of technology to
produce arms and military equipment; and upgrades, parts, and services
related to the transfer of arms and military equipment.]{.underline}
Third, the [**lack of openness and transparency by many arms suppliers
and recipients regarding the value and volume of their arms exports and
imports makes it difficult to collect accurate data**.]{.underline} As a
result, a variety of different definitions of the international arms
trade and estimates of its scale exists. This has implications for
efforts to establish controls on arms transfers via a future
international arms trade treaty (ATT). This article will outline some of
the challenges in defining, measuring, and controlling the international
arms trade. Definitions and Estimates The national lists of arms and
military equipment to be subject to export controls (control lists)
maintained by most states and all major arms exporters provide a useful
starting point for defining "arms" and the international arms trade. The
Munitions List and Lists of Dual-Use Goods and Technologies of the
Wassenaar Arrangement on Export Controls for Conventional Arms and
Dual-Use Goods and Technologies provide the basis for the control lists
of the 40 states that are members of the group. The Munitions List
covers a wide range of arms and military equipment, from small arms to
ships, as well as ammunition, information and communication
technologies, training equipment, and equipment for producing arms.
Several significant arms-exporting nonmembers, including China, have
fully or partially aligned their national control lists with the
Munitions List. As a result, all of the top 10 arms suppliers during
2005-2009 have control lists derived from the Wassenaar Arrangement.
National control lists serve as the basis for national reports on arms
exports. As of January 2010, 32 states had published at least one
national report on arms exports since 1990, and a further nine states
provided information on the value of their export licenses and exports
to the 2009 European Union (EU) Annual Report on Arms Exports.2 These
reports vary in detail but, at a minimum, tend to provide data on the
financial value of arms export licenses or arms exports. [Several
**major exporters** (e.g., Russia) **do not produce such reports**, but
do release official data on the financial value of their arms
exports]{.underline}. Using national reports and official statements,
the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute [(SIPRI) has
attempted to provide estimates of the financial value of the
international arms trade]{.underline} (see below). The now-defunct [U.S.
Arms Control and Disarmament Agency (ACDA) created the following
comprehensive definition of the arms trade, which has been widely used
by researchers: weapons of war, parts thereof, ammunition, support
equipment, and other commodities designed for military use.... Dual-use
equipment...when its primary mission is identified as
military]{.underline}. The building of defense production facilities and
licensing fees paid as royalties for the production of military
equipment.... Military services such as training, supply operations,
equipment repair, technical assistance and construction are included
where data are available.3 A similar definition of the arms trade is
used to compile the U.S. Congressional Research Service's (CRS) annual
report, "Conventional Arms Transfers to Developing Nations.[" In spite
of the name, the report contains estimates for the value of the global
arms trade, not just trade with developing countries.]{.underline} The
CRS estimated the financial value of deliveries of arms to be \$34.5
billion for 2007.4 Despite using a narrower definition of arms transfers
than the CRS, [SIPRI's accounting of official financial data contained
in national reports and official statements for 2007 generated a figure
of \$51.1 billion for arms exports, representing 0.3 percent of world
trade.5 This figure is likely to be lower than the true figure because a
**number of significant exporters**, including China, **do not release
data on the financial value of their arms exports**.]{.underline} The
difference between the SIPRI and CRS estimates is a further
demonstration of the difficulty of estimating the financial value of the
international arms trade. The SIPRI arms transfers database provides
information on international arms transfers from 1950 to the most recent
calendar year.6 Its coverage is narrower than that of the ACDA, CRS, and
national control lists; for example, it does not include transfers of
most small arms and light weapons (SALW). However, it provides
information on the number of units transferred and employs a unique
pricing system to measure the volume of arms transfers. The SIPRI trend
indicator value allows researchers to track developments in transfers to
and from different suppliers, recipients, and regions. SIPRI data form
the basis for the discussion below.

#### Government DCS figures are unreliable -- underreporting and lack of updating 

**Freeman 18** (July 19, 2018, Sam Perlo Freeman is the Program Director
of the World Peace Foundation, "How Big is the International Arms
Trade?",

MT

US arms exports are conducted through two main separate routes: Foreign
Military Sales (FMS), which are government-to-government contracts
between the US government and a foreign government, with the US DOD
subcontracting the delivery of the equipment and/or services to a US
defense company; and Direct Commercial Sales (DCS), which are negotiated
directly between the US exporting company and the client government, and
which must receive an export license from the Directorate of Defense
Trade Controls (DDTC) in the US Department of State. The data situation
is very different for these two types of sale. Detailed
country-by-country data on both orders and deliveries for Foreign
Military Sales are provided by the DOD Defense Security Cooperation
Agency (DSCA), covering both equipment and services in each case; the
data are updated in subsequent years as more information becomes
available, and as far as it is possible for an outside observer to tell,
is comprehensive and accurate. Full details of individual contracts are
published on the DOD website. 14 The average level of FMS deliveries for
2012-2016 was \$15,975 million. In contrast, [the **publicly available
data for Direct Commercial Sales** are **unclear, noncomprehensive,**
appear to **vary considerably in methodology over time,** and are **not
updated with new information** after initial publication.]{.underline}
While [notification to Congress is required for individual license
requests over a certain size, the details of these are buried within the
overall record of activities of the House Foreign Affairs
Committee]{.underline},15 although the Security Assistance Monitor has
extracted a full list of notifications for 2016 and 2017.16 Data on DCS
licenses and deliveries by country are provided by the DDTC in their
annual Section 655 report.17 These give totals by country for licenses
approved, broken down by category of good on the US military list, but
only a single total by country for the value of goods shipped. As
discussed earlier, [**the data on DCS license approvals** are
**essentially worthless** in that they include licenses for deliveries
to US forces overseas, and due to the long period for which licenses,
especially for services, are valid]{.underline}. The data for the value
of equipment shipped have one major lacunae, [in that they **do not
include the value of military services delivered**, unlike for FMS. The
US Government Accountability Office (GAO) estimated in 2010 that about a
third of the value of FMS contracts tends to be for services.18
**Delivery of services is not reported to US Customs**, and there is
**no reporting requirement for companies in relation to the provision of
military services overseas**. Thus, **no-one collects data for the
export of military services via DCS**. Where services are provided as
part of FMS contracts, the data is collected as part of the US
Government's monitoring of FMS delivery.]{.underline} A second flaw is
that the [data for deliveries is not revised in subsequent years as more
information becomes available]{.underline}. Moreover, [the **annual data
for total DCS deliveries** (see figure 1) **fluctuates wildly** in a way
that cannot be explained by changes in actual levels of arms
exports]{.underline}. In particular, the figures for 2005, 2006, and
2008 are vastly higher than for other years, over \$30 billion, and
include figures for individual countries such as Japan and Iraq that
cannot be accurate given these countries' levels of military spending
(and in the case of Japan the amount of equipment they source
domestically). The reason for this would appear to be that [the figures
for these years include deliveries to US forces, being based on a
complete search of the US customs database]{.underline}. The [**basis
for the figures in other years is unclear;** whether it is based on
customs data, or returns by companies from used or expired licenses, and
if the latter if this reporting is mandatory or voluntary.]{.underline}
I have heard different stories from different sources. Reporting based
on license use would naturally give underestimates, as licenses for
equipment are valid for 4 years, so a company might only return a used
license after the full 4 years, by which time it would be too late to
include any shipments made in the first 3 years in the Section 655
reports for the years in question (which, as noted, are not revised in
subsequent years). [In some years, in particular in the late 1990s, the
level of DCS deliveries reported sinks to below \$1 billion, which seems
hard to believe given the level of US arms exports overall at the
time.]{.underline} Finally, the presentation of the section 655 reports
by the DDTC has become progressively less user-friendly over the past
decade or so. In 2008 and 2009, the reports were provided in both PDF
and spreadsheet form, and had detailed introductions. Since then, the
spreadsheets have been removed, and the introductions have become less
detailed. [No global total figure is provided, so that this must be
obtained by manually adding up the figures for each country. The PDF
documents provided appear to come from a printout of an Excel
spreadsheet, implying that **an effort has been made to convert the more
usable format into a less usable one.** Finally, the **report covering
exports in 2016 has been buried in an extremely obscure location on the
DDTC website** (fortunately the reports are reproduced by Security
Assistance Monitor), and the introduction has disappeared completely.
**It is almost as if the DDTC do not actually want the public to have
the information**.]{.underline} Due to the suspected underestimation of
DCS deliveries, the US State Department's World Military Expenditure and
Arms Transfers (WMEAT) estimates these figures by assuming that all DCS
licenses are delivered over the 4-year period for which they are valid;
however, this makes the mistake of including deliveries to US forces
overseas, thus producing huge overestimates. The degree of
overestimation is likely to be even worse for military service exports
for several reasons: i. The largest proportion of such authorizations
that are for services provided to US forces overseas, as such
maintenance and logistic services are overwhelmingly outsourced to the
private sector; ii. Authorizations may cover a 10- year period, rather
than 4-year, according to the GAO report, [with the value of services
exported often lower than what is authorized;]{.underline} iii. The
section 655 reports state, in relation to service agreements, (e.g. in
the 2016 report) "Export authorizations furnished in FY 2016 also
include certain activities occurring in prior years because the scope of
the Department's regulatory authority over such agreements continues for
as long as these multi-year agreements remain in effect." The
interpretation of this is not clear, but it may mean that the value of
authorizations reported in each year is the total value of
authorizations for all agreements that are still in operation; this
would imply that, rather than each authorization being counted only in
the year it is granted, they are counted towards the total for each year
for which they apply Hence, the WMEAT approach to estimating DCS exports
cannot be considered viable. [By contrast, the **Congressional Research
Service (CRS),** in its annual reports on the global arms trade,
**considers the DCS data to be so unreliable that it excludes it
altogether**.]{.underline} Evidence that---with the exception of 2005,
2006 and 2008---official data for DCS deliveries is underestimated is
supported by two sources. First, [a GAO report in 2010 makes a rigorous
assessment of US defense equipment (not services) exports from
2005-2009, under both FMS and DCS, based on a detailed search of the US
Customs database, taking care to exclude DCS exports made under
temporary export licenses, and those for deliveries to US forces
overseas]{.underline}.19 The figures for DCS deliveries range from \$9.6
billion in 2005 to \$13.3 billion in 2013; much lower than the official
figures for the outlier years of 2005, 2006 and 2008, but much higher
than those in 2007 and 2009. The report criticizes the quality of
reporting on US arms exports through DCS. Secondly, there is data from
the annual reports to Congress by the Bureau of Industry and Security
(BIS) on Offsets in Defense Trade. While the main purpose of these
reports is to provide information on offset agreements made in relation
to US arms exports, the reports also provide annual data for total US
defense merchandise exports (not including services), through FMS and
DCS combined. The most recent report covers data up to 2015.20 The GAO
figures are presented in the report in constant 2009 dollars; these have
been converted into current dollars using the DOD deflator used in the
report, taken from budget tables from the Whitehouse Office of
Management and Budget. Table 2 shows the figures for the various
different sources for FMS, DCS, and combined totals, from 2005-2016. The
offsets report is based on US trade census data, using end-user codes
that relate to military products. The codes included are: export end-use
codes: (50000) Military aircraft, complete; (50010) Aircraft launching
gear, parachutes, etc.; (50020) Engines and turbines for military
aircraft; (50030) Military trucks, armored vehicles, etc.; (50040)
Military ships and boats; (50050) Tanks, artillery, missiles, rockets,
guns, and ammunition; (50060) Military apparel and footwear; and (50070)
Parts for military-type goods. The GAO report, meanwhile, includes the
following subcategories of military equipment: military aircraft and
spares; satellites, communications and electronics equipment, and parts;
aircraft; vehicles, weapons, and parts; other equipment and parts;
missiles and parts; ammunition, explosives, and parts; firearms and
parts; and ships and parts. These two would appear to cover the same
ground, except for the "satellites, communications and electronics
equipment, and parts" category in the GAO report, which has no
counterpart in the offsets report; presumably as **[the trade data does
not distinguish between satellites and communication systems etc. for
military and civilian use.]{.underline}** While not providing an annual
breakdown or an exact figure, a bar graph in the GAO report shows the
total for each category for the five-year period. The apparent figure
for the satellites etc. category of around \$19 billion (in current
prices) corresponds almost exactly to the difference between the totals
for 2005-09 between the two sources. Hence, the GAO report and the
offsets report are mutually consistent in their figures for total
exports of defense articles for 2005-09, supporting the contention that
the official DCS figures for 2007 and 2009 are underestimates, and
suggesting that figures for other years (apart from the methodological
outliers of 2005, 2006, and 2008) may also be underestimated. Further
support for this claim comes from a comparison of the offset report
figures with the official figures for FMS and DCS in later years. Bear
in mind that the offset report excludes FMS services, which typically
account for around a third of the FMS total, according to the GAO
report. (For the period 2005-09, services appear to have accounted for
39% of the FMS total, based on the difference between the official
figures for total FMS, and the GAO figures for FMS articles only).
Moreover, the offset report appears to exclude satellites, communication
and electronics equipment and parts, from both FMS and DCS figures---a
category that accounted for approximately 20% of defense equipment
exports over 2005-09 according to the GAO report. [Nonetheless, **the
total figure for defense equipment exports from the offset report** for
2014, \$20.6 billion, **is** actually **higher than the total official
figures for FMS and DCS, indicating a severe underreporting of DCS
exports**]{.underline} (assuming that the FMS figures are to be
considered accurate). In other years, [the official FMS+DCS total is
higher than the offset report, but in some cases only slightly
higher]{.underline}, so that the share of FMS services and satellites
etc. in the total would have to be implausible small for the figures to
be consistent. (The difference amounts to just 4.5% of the total of
official FMS+DCS figures in 2012, and 6.5% in 2015, for example). A
final piece of evidence in support of the claim that DCS figures are
underestimated in later (and possibly earlier) years as well as in 2007
and 2009 comes from my own analysis of US exports of major conventional
weapons over time, based on the SIPRI Arms Transfers Database. I
examined the records for individual arms transfers in SIPRI's internal
database, looking at all US arms deliveries over the two periods,
2005-09, and 2012-15, and identifying those which were, or were most
likely, DCS sales. [The result was that, over the period 2005-09, DCS
sales averaged a TIV value of 3285 per year, or 46% of the total for US
arms deliveries. Over the period 2012- 2016, this declined to an average
annual TIV of 2768, a decline of 16%, and only 26% of the total TIV
value of US deliveries for the period. Against this decline, we may note
that **there has been some inflation between the two
periods**]{.underline} (with military cost inflation likely at least as
high). Overall, it would appear from this analysis of SIPRI data that
the volume of DCS arms deliveries has probably not changed substantially
in either direction. At any rate, the apparent decline from the average
of \$11.5 billion a year for 2005-09 reported in the GAO report, to just
\$4.5 billion for 2012-16 according to the official figures, seems too
large to be plausible[. Hence, if the GAO figures---which, as noted, are
consistent with the offset report---are to be believed, then the
**official DCS figures for later years must be considered highly
suspect**]{.underline}. While not completely conclusive, the
accumulation of evidence suggests [a systematic under-counting of DCS
exports in official figures.]{.underline} The reasons for this likely
undercounting cannot be determined without far greater methodological
transparency from the DDTC, which was not forthcoming under the previous
administration, and is hardly likely to be more so under the current
one.

#### Depth of understanding of core subject areas offers inroads to understanding of the breadth of a topic 

**Conley 15** (Oct 13 2015, David T. Conley is a professor of
educational policy and leadership and director of the Center for
Educational Policy Research in the College of Education at the
University of Oregon, \"Breadth vs. Depth: The Deeper Learning
Dilemma\",
<https://blogs.edweek.org/edweek/learning_deeply/2015/10/breadth_vs_depth_the_deeper_learning_dilemma.html>)
MT

- It is impossible to go in depth on every subject area, instead we
  should learn the core parts of each topic because it allows us to
  learn about the structure of the entire discipline of that topic which
  one can then apply to broader content knowledge

[Few people overtly object to the idea that **students should understand
what they are learning at a deep level** so that they might retain and
use the knowledge and skills they are taught. To do so, however, almost
always requires students to spend more time on a topic or
concept.]{.underline} [Spending more time in one area almost always
means exposing students to less of the curriculum as a
whole.]{.underline} This fundamental tug-of-war must be addressed for
students to achieve the dual goals of acceptable performance on tests
that cover the breadth of the curriculum and on assessments that plumb
the depths of student understanding. Standardized tests are built around
the concept of domain sampling. A test is constructed by creating items
that are drawn from the overall knowledge domain of the subject or
course. [**Ideally, the items taken as a whole are** a
**representative** cross-section **of the knowledge and skills in the
domain.**]{.underline} The test does not gauge all that could
conceivably be learned about the domain, but by sampling in an
unpredictable but systematic fashion from the domain, **[the test
purports to determine the degree to which the test taker has mastered
the domain as a whole]{.underline}**. Performance assessments take a
different approach. They select a key subset of the knowledge in the
domain and explore student understanding and facility within that
subset. Such assessments are often multidimensional. In other words,
they end up gauging both content knowledge and other skills essential to
the subject area. While the results from one performance assessment
cannot be used to judge the test taker\'s mastery of the entire domain,
it is not unreasonable to assume that **[performance on a challenging
performance assessment focused on key content and skills says a lot
about overall student mastery of the domain without testing each and
every part of it.]{.underline}** The greatest challenge for teachers who
wish to incorporate deeper learning is to balance the amount of content
they cover with the depth to which students explore what they are
learning. [It\'s not practical for students to go to deeper levels on
all the content they learn, and it may not be necessary for them to do
so. The key is for teachers to **determine which concepts or skills are
the keystones that unify or connect the subject area.** I**f students
can go deep in those areas, they can gain insight into disciplinary
thinking**, **the way experts in that subject go about applying their
content knowledge.**]{.underline}

#### Depth in research is better for understanding a topic---leads to increased research skills and academic outcomes 

**Coker et. al 17** (Coker, J. S., Heiser, E., Taylor, L., & Book, C.
from Elon University (2017). Impacts of Experiential Learning Depth and
Breadth on Student Outcomes. Journal of Experiential Education, 40(1),
5--23. <https://doi.org/10.1177/1053825916678265>) MT

Numerous studies suggest that [undergraduate **research that spans
multiple semesters is most beneficial for student
outcomes**]{.underline} (Russell, Hancock, & McCullough, 2007; Zydney,
Bennett, Shahid, & Bauer, 2013). A study comparing student research
gains after a summer experience versus a yearlong experience found that
students in [the latter showed significantly higher gains overall,
especially in **research skills that require time to develop and** that
often **occur toward the end of research projects**]{.underline} (data
interpretation, communication of results, independence, **[relating
results to the bigger picture of their fields]{.underline}**, and so on;
Adedokun et al., 2014). Gilmore, Vieyra, Timmerman, Feldon, and Maher
(2015) found that graduate-level research skill performance increased
substantially with the duration of undergraduate research experiences.
Craney et al. (2011) found that undergraduates with more research
experience find the research more advantageous for employability and
graduate school admissions than students with shorter experiences.
Similarly, Fechheimer, Webber, and Kleiber (2010) found that [longer
undergraduate research experiences were positively related to student
grades.]{.underline} Research on the outcomes of internship depth is
sparse and often focuses on training teachers. Spooner, Flowers,
Lambert, and Algozzine (2008) found that preteachers in yearlong
internships reported better relationships with supervising teachers,
greater knowledge of school policies and procedures, and higher scores
for the perceived adequacy of time spent in school than did the students
in a semester internship. However, preteachers did not differ in
perceptions of their own teaching ability (Spooner et al., 2008).
Chambers and Hardy (2005) found that two-semester internships did not
lead to added benefits over one-semester benefits in terms of
instructional management, behavioral management, or self-efficacy.
However, another study found that the most effective teacher training
programs require 6 or more months of internship (DarlingHammond, Chung,
& Frelow, 2002). A study by the company Intern Bridge found that, across
6,147 students, the level of student satisfaction with an internship was
directly correlated with length, ranging from short experiences of 1 to
4 weeks to long experiences of 13 to 16 weeks (Grasgreen, 2012).
[**Student outcomes are also affected by depth during service-learning
experiences**. Students involved in more than 20 hr of service-learning
tend to gain a greater sense of social issues and a deeper commitment to
community involvement than students involved in less than 20
hr]{.underline} (Kendrick, 1996; Markus, Howard, & King, 1993).
Likewise, **[civic identity is shaped only when service-learning is
regular and sustained]{.underline}** (Hepburn, Niemi, & Chapman, 2000;
Mabry, 1998). Student leadership is another form of experiential
learning that, though less studied, shares a developmental framework
with other forms (Guthrie & Jones, 2012). The Multi-Institutional Study
of Leadership (MSL; 2015) found that students who held more leadership
positions scored significantly higher on measures of congruence,
commitment, consciousness of self, collaboration, handling controversy
with civility, citizenship, overall socially responsible leadership,
resiliency, leadership efficacy, complex cognitive skills, and social
perspective-taking. A study of leadership at a military academy found
that more experienced student leaders were more self-critical (West,
2012).

#### A more limited topic leads to more creative affs

**Gibbert et al. 07**(Michael Gibbert is an assistant professor of
management at Bocconi University (Milan, Italy). Martin Hoegl is a

Beisheim School of [Management]{.underline} (Koblenz, Germany). Lifsa
VAlikangas is a professor of innovation management at the Helsinki
School of Economics (Finland) and a director of the California-based
Woodside Institute.)

[Resource constraints can also fuel innovative team performance
directly]{.underline}. In the spirit of the proverb \"necessity is the
mother of invention,\" [teams may produce better results because of
resource constraints]{.underline}. Cognitive psychology provides
experimental support for the \"less is more\" hypothesis. For example,
[scholars in creative cognition find in laboratory tests that subjects
are most innovative when given fewer rather than more resources for
solving a problem]{.underline}. The reason seems to be that [the human
mind is most productive when restricted]{.underline}. [Limited - or
better focused - by specific rules and constraints, we are more likely
to recognize an unexpected idea]{.underline}. [Suppose,]{.underline} for
example, [that we need to put dinner on the table for unexpected
guests]{.underline} arriving later that day. [The main constraints here
are the ingredients available]{.underline} and how much time is left.
[One way to solve this problem is to think of a familiar recipe and then
head off]{.underline} to the supermarket [for the extra
ingredients]{.underline}. [Alternatively, we may start by looking in the
refrigerator and cupboard to see what is already there]{.underline},
[then allowing ourselves to devise innovative ways of combining subsets
of these ingredients]{.underline}. Many [cooks attest that the latter
option]{.underline}, while riskier, [often leads to more creative and
better appreciated dinners]{.underline}. In fact, it is the option
invariably preferred by professional chefs.

Since the 1990s, the [United States has remained the world's leading
arms exporter,]{.underline} and the gap between it and the
second-largest exporter, Russia, has grown steadily. Together, they
supply nearly 60 percent of all major conventional weapons systems
exports, with [**98 nations importing U.S. weapons**, about double the
number of Russian customers. Adding French, German, and Chinese
transfers brings the exports of the five countries to 75 percent of the
global market.]{.underline} Accounting for just more than one-third of
global arms imports as a region, Middle Eastern countries increased
weapons purchases by 87 percent from the 2009--2013 period to the
2014--2018 period. The United States supplied 54 percent of weapons to
the region, which is wracked by ongoing conflicts and is increasing its
weapons imports faster than any other region. Saudi Arabia, which has
nearly tripled its weapons imports over the past decade, now accounts
for 12 percent of global imports and has replaced India as the largest
global importer. Egypt, the United Arab Emirates, and Iraq were also top
10 global importers from the region. Arms transfers to the region have
grown increasingly controversial, especially to Saudi Arabia and the
UAE, which are leading the air and ground forces fighting Houthi forces
in Yemen. The conflict there has become a major humanitarian crisis.
More than 17,000 civilians have died in the fighting as of August 2018,
according to the Office of the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights,
which estimated that 60 percent of those deaths resulted from airstrikes
by the Saudi-led coalition. Regional arms imports have enabled the
coalition to blockade Yemeni ports, halting the inflow of commercial
goods. About 24 million people, 80 percent of the Yemeni population,
require humanitarian assistance, reports the UN Office for the
Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs. The European Parliament has
approved numerous nonbinding resolutions prohibiting arms sales to Saudi
Arabia, with countries such as Austria, Germany, the Netherlands, and
Sweden taking steps to restrict exports to Riyadh. France, the United
Kingdom, and the United States have continued to provide Saudi arms,
although a UK court is expected to resume consideration of a case in
April, challenging the legality of London\'s sales to Riyadh. U.S. Sales
Already the top arms exporter, the United States has recently sought to
boost its sales. [SIPRI reports that **Washington now accounts for 36
percent of global exports**, up from 30 percent in the prior five-year
period.]{.underline} The misuse of U.S. arms transferred by recipient
countries has drawn recent scrutiny after reports that Saudi Arabia and
the UAE had provided U.S. weapons to al Qaeda militias in Yemen.
Separately, Indian leaders raised allegations that Pakistan had misused
U.S.-supplied fighter aircraft during recent border tensions. In
implementing U.S. conventional arms transfer policy moving forward, "we
are examining our procedures for evaluating allegations of misuse,"
Laura Cressey, State Department deputy director of the Office of
Regional Security and Arms Transfers, told Arms Control Today March 18.
That policy, overdue for a quarterly implementation update, currently
states the intent to "facilitate ally and partner efforts...to reduce
the risk of national or coalition operations causing civilian harm." The
policy has received criticism for justifying arms transfers to "maximize
the ability of the United States industry to grow and support allies and
partners" in the face of competition from other exporters. SIPRI "does
not support this narrative" of stiff competition as a rationale for U.S.
policy, said report co-author Aude Fleurant in a press statement. "The
United States is "by far the largest exporter...\[and\] has increased
its gap with Russia," she added. Noting that changes in broader patterns
take time, she also cautioned that "the policy was adopted in 2018, it
is a bit early to see its potential impacts." Global arms transfers are
expected to experience continuing growth, Fleurant said, despite
somewhat lower transfers in 2018 than the previous year. "Outside of a
major economic downturn like the 2008--09 crisis, I don't think we will
see a reversal of the upward trend," she said. U.S. is top-seller again
as questions simmer over where its weapons end up.

#### Multiple actors in FMS process and unknown number of non-standard items make topic unmanageable 

**GAO 19** (Feb 2019, United States Government Accountability Office,
"Report to Congressional Committees: Foreign Military Sales Observations
on DOD's Approach to Developing Price and Availability Estimates for
Foreign Customers", <https://www.gao.gov/assets/700/697041.pdf>) MT

The FMS program, which transfers defense articles and services to
international partners and organizations, is essentially an acquisition
process through which the U.S. government procures military equipment,
training, and other services on behalf of foreign customers.5
[**Multiple organizations have a role in the FMS program**.]{.underline}
The Department of State has overall responsibility for the program,
including approving what defense items and services can be sold to
specific countries. [DOD administers the FMS program and manages the
procurements executed within the military departments on behalf of
foreign governments]{.underline}. [Within DOD, **DSCA carries out key
functions** such as supporting development of policy for FMS. **The
military departments carry out** the day-to-day **implementation** of
FMS procurements which can include providing price and availability data
at the customer's request.]{.underline} Typically, defense items---such
as weapon systems---made available for transfer or sale to foreign
customers are systems that have completed operational testing and are
entering or have entered full rate production. In addition, [**DOD also
sells non-standard items, which are defined as items that DOD does not
currently manage and may include items that (1) are commercially
available, (2) DOD previously purchased and have since been retired, or
(3) were purchased in a different configuration for DOD components.**
For example, **a customer may express interest in buying tanks that DOD
no longer buys for its own needs. A customer may also express interest
in buying a tank that DOD currently procures but with a radio
communications configuration that is different from what DOD uses.** A
single DOD entity may not have full responsibility for all aspects of
responding to a foreign customer's request to purchase U.S. defense
items and services. Under DSCA policy, FMS procurements must generally
be managed at "no cost" or "no profit" to the U.S. government. DOD's
work related to developing price and availability data and other FMS
operations is generally paid for through the administrative charges
collected from foreign customers. Depending on the complexity of the
customer's request, coordination within and across DOD components may be
necessary to obtain complete information on pricing and
availability.]{.underline} DOD may also need to coordinate with defense
contractors who ultimately develop and provide the equipment or
services. The FMS process generally begins when a foreign government
submits a letter of request to the Department of State or DOD to
purchase defense articles or services. In the letter of request, the
foreign customer may express interest in obtaining preliminary price and
availability data for the capabilities it seeks. While DOD describes
price and availability data as rough order of magnitude estimates,
DSCA's guidance does not define the precision of these estimates.
According to DOD, FMS price and availability data are non-binding
estimates for the defense items and services and are not intended to be
budget-quality estimates. Requests for price and availability data can
signal to DOD and defense contractors the potential for future sales.
DOD and contractors may also draw upon these requests to forecast
staffing needs and production line availability. DOD security
cooperation organizations working in U.S. embassies around the world can
assist potential customers with defining and refining their requirements
prior to submitting a request for price and availability data. The
security cooperation organizations engage in this early coordination to
help customers articulate their capability needs. This early
coordination also gives DOD components advance notice of upcoming
requests so they can initiate technology security and foreign disclosure
processes for the timely release of information.6 Requests for price and
availability data represent an optional step in the process. Customers
may forgo the price and availability process and instead submit a formal
assistance request for a letter of offer and acceptance, which when
signed by the customer and U.S. government becomes an executable FMS
case. Figure 1 illustrates where the option to request price and
availability occurs in the overall FMS process.

#### Breadth outweighs depth

**Colander and McGoldrick 9** (David, Professor of Economics at
Middlebury College, and KimMarie, professor of economics in the
University of Richmond, Liberal Education, Vol. 95, No. 2 "The Economics
Major and Liberal Education," Spring)

[The success or failure of a liberal education,]{.underline} or an
undergraduate major, [depends far more on how the educational process
influences students' passion for learning than it does on what
specifically they learn. A successful liberal education creates a
lifelong learner, and classroom instruction is as much a catalyst for
education as it is the education itself]{.underline}. Because passion
for learning carries over to other fields and areas, the catalyst
function of education does not depend on content. [Academic departments
tend to focus on]{.underline} both the need for [depth]{.underline} in
the field and the need for specialized training as a component of
liberal education. The push for depth over breadth by disciplinary
scholars is to be expected. Just as a Shakespeare scholar is unlikely to
be passionate about teaching freshman composition, a scholar of
classical game theory is unlikely to be passionate about teaching
general economic principles within the context of an interdisciplinary
consideration of broad themes. [Because breadth is not usually
associated with research passion by disciplinary specialists, and
because a college is a collection of disciplinary specialists, breadth
often gets shortchanged; it is interpreted as "superficial." But in
reality, breadth pertains to the nature of the questions
asked]{.underline}. [It involves asking questions that are unlikely to
have definitive answers---"big-think" questions that challenge the
foundations of disciplinary analysis]{.underline}. [By contrast, depth
involves asking smaller questions that can be answered---"little-think"
questions that, too often, involve an uncritical acceptance of the
assumptions upon which research is built.]{.underline} Questions and
areas of study have two dimensions: a research dimension and a teaching
dimension. The disciplinary nature of both graduate education and
undergraduate college faculties leads to an emphasis on "research
questions," which tend to be narrow and in-depth, and a de-emphasis on
"teaching questions," which tend to involve greater breadth. Economics
has its own distinctive set of teaching questions: Is capitalism
preferable to socialism? What is the appropriate structure of an
economy? Does the market alienate individuals from their true selves? Is
consumer sovereignty acceptable? Do statistical significance tests
appropriately measure significance? It is worthwhile to teach such
"big-think" questions, but because they do not fit the disciplinary
research focus of the profession, they tend not to be included in the
economics major. This is regrettable, since [struggling with "big-think"
questions helps provoke a passion for learning in students and, hence,
can be a catalyst for deeper student learning. It is similarly
worthwhile to expose students to longstanding debates within the
field]{.underline}. For example, Marx considered the alienation created
by the market to be a central problem of western societies; Hayek argued
that the market was necessary to preserve individual freedom; and Alfred
Marshall argued that activities determine wants and, thus, wants cannot
be considered as primitives in economic analysis. [Such debates are
highly relevant for students to consider as they study economics within
the context of a liberal education. But these kinds of debates are not
actively engaged as part of cutting-edge research, which instead tends
to focus either on narrow questions that can be resolved through
statistical analysis or on highly theoretical questions that exceed the
level of undergraduate students.]{.underline}

[**Many governments are aware of this need for a broader range of
skills** and make this explicit in different ways and to varying
degrees]{.underline}. For example, countries such as Australia or
Singapore provide specific guidelines for the integration of both
cognitive and social-emotional skills into schooling. Australia
identifies several "general capabilities," including literacy, numeracy,
information and communication technology competence, critical and
creative thinking, personal and social competence, ethical behavior, and
intercultural understanding. These general capabilities are the key "set
of knowledge, skills, behavior, and dispositions that can be developed
and applied across the curriculum to help students become successful
learners, confident and creative individuals and active and informed
citizens" (ACARA, 2016). The general capabilities are integrated within
and across the content of key learning areas as appropriate. The
Australian online curriculum provides links to show where the general
capabilities have been incorporated in key learning area descriptions,
and also provides examples and guides for their implementation into
teaching and learning. Singapore's approach calls for the integration of
21st century skills into both the academic and the non-academic
curricula, and sees this as part of the country's "holistic education."
Singapore notes that responsibility for development of these skills is
placed with both the formal education system and parents and the two
layers must work together, "hand in hand." The Singaporean framework
also notes that knowledge and skills must be underpinned by values. The
skills referenced in Singapore's approach include social-emotional
competencies and "emerging" competencies such as communication, civic
literacy, and critical thinking. Many other countries express similar
goals around breadth of skills, such as in Rwanda, Ontario Canada, South
Korea, and Mauritius where the education ministries' websites feature
mission statements and visions for learners (see Figure 2). Although the
skills identified in these mission statements are described differently,
they share common ground. [From high- to low-income countries, **a trend
toward broadening of curriculum is emerging,** at least in terms of
aspirational statements. The extent to which this breadth is reflected
in the implementation of education systems is less clear.]{.underline}
As far as global aspirations are concerned, the Sustainable Development
Goal 4 (United Nations, 2015) names only literacy and numeracy skills
specifically (target 4.1), although other skills are implied in various
targets. These targets include readiness for primary education (target
4.2), technical and vocational skills (target 4.4), and skills needed to
promote global citizenship and sustainable development (target 4.7).
**[These targets signal an emphasis on the breadth of skills necessary
to comprehensively prepare children, youth, and adults for 21st century
citizenship and life]{.underline}**. In the Skills for a Changing World
project, we study the alignment of the worldwide aspiration for breadth
of skills with its implementation. As with the execution of any vision,
particularly large-scale transformations, the application of breadth to
education systems varies greatly from country to country. [We focus on
the factors that fuel the uptake of breadth of skills as well as the
elements that lay the foundation for breadth within the formal education
ecosystem.]{.underline} The formal education system will need to undergo
wholesale change to provide breadth of skills for its students and
graduates. Since education was acknowledged as a human right nearly 70
years ago, educational endeavors have primarily focused on content and
knowledge accumulation. Accordingly, teachers focused on content
(primarily on its delivery); curricula focused on content (not on how to
use it effectively); and assessment focused on content (particularly on
its accumulation or lack thereof). Refocusing our activities from
content accumulation to skills development sharply impacts each of these
three components. [This project focuses on the extent to which this
interdependency is recognized and acted upon and the degree to which it
facilitates the implementation of breadth of skills in curriculum,
pedagogy, and assessment. All three will need to be reformed in the
drive for breadth of skills]{.underline}. Curriculum Curriculum is the
education system's roadmap. It has a starting point and an end point. It
outlines both the objects along the way, such as subjects, topics, and
activities, and the route (or routes) to take. It can describe different
ways of using the objects and different ways to navigate the routes.
When breadth of skills is valued in the curriculum, the roadmap focuses
on how the objects along the way are used in the service of the end
goals, whereas a curriculum valuing content knowledge simply notes their
existence or emphasizes memorization of their origins and purpose.
Consequently, within a skills development context, the curriculum needs
to be explored and analyzed in a way that optimizes these objects as
learning stepping stones rather than as discrete learning objectives.
Pedagogy Teaching is not the mere provision of content knowledge from
instructors to students. Teachers are the primary navigators and
implementers of the curriculum, and as a broad range of skills becomes
valued as "core business" for education systems, teachers will need to
teach these skills and their application. Teaching for these skills may
require a specific set of pedagogical strategies, with new methods and
tactics adapted to the changing roadmap. Therefore, one of the
consequences of including a breadth of skills in the curriculum is the
need to reexamine pedagogical practices. Assessment Assessment is the
way we evaluate learners' progress toward the endpoints of the roadmap.
In an education system focused on breadth of skills, the learning target
is the students' capacity to process and use information, not their
ability to store and recall facts. Thus the assessment target also
changes to evaluating that processing capacity, which poses a challenge
for assessment experts. Assessing whether a student knows a fact is
relatively simple for test development. Assessing whether a student can
identify how that fact can be used is complex. We shift from a
well-defined goal to an ill-defined goal (Care & Griffin, 2014; Fischer,
Greiff, & Funke, 2012). In the context of classroom assessment, we move
from a "closed" question---where a student can respond yes or no,
correct or incorrect, true or false, or provide the fact itself---to an
"open" question or prompt, where a student can demonstrate understanding
and application within parameters that capture student proficiency in an
efficient and standardized way. Figure 3 provides an illustration of the
assessment, curriculum, and pedagogical interdependencies and how change
in one requires change in the others. Our goal is to work with education
systems to understand how these interdependencies are considered and to
contribute to reform efforts associated with adopting breadth of skills
in formal education. Accordingly, for this project, this implies a deep
look at the education systems and practices across the countries that
are part of our project. THE GLOBAL MOVEMENT TOWARD BREADTH OF SKILLS
Skills for a Changing World seeks to understand the factors that propel
systemic reform at the national and global levels as well as the factors
that might inhibit such reform. Why have some countries fully integrated
breadth of skills across ages and opportunities into their education
systems? Why have others included this breadth in name only (for
example, in vision statements or curricula, but not in practice), and
why have some not included it at all? Our project will attempt to answer
these questions. Changing Workforce Demands [The work of researchers
from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and Harvard University
provides evidence that technological change is driving the major shift
in workforce demand for skills, particularly with respect to the
transition toward more educated workers.]{.underline} Autor, Levy, and
Murnane (2003) and Levy (2010) show how the workforce since 2000 has
increasingly demanded "non-routine" competencies in employees. Routine
activities are those which could in principle be scripted (Acemoglu &
Autor, 2010), and that are procedure- or rule-based activities;
non-routine activities, whether abstract or manual, are less predictable
and require flexibility and adaptability. Extensive reviews of the
nature of skills and characteristics valued globally in the 21st century
have been undertaken. Substantial works include that of Binkley and
colleagues (Griffin, McGaw, & Care, 2012), Hilton and Pellegrino
(National Research Council, 2013), and the World Economic Forum (2014).
These reviews rely on substantive contributions from UNESCO's DeLors
Report (1996) and Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development
(OECD)'s DeSeCo Report (2001). [While there is much overlap in the
skills and characteristics presented in these reports, researchers, and
practitioners have diverse views on the most useful frameworks,
organizing principles, and specific skills and
characteristics.]{.underline} These views may reflect some of the
technical concerns around assessment and measurement, pedagogical
concerns around effectiveness of skills development, and research
concerns around predictive capacity of skills enhancement for study and
work outcomes. Figure 4 shows results from a quick web search of the
most frequently used terms associated with early childhood development,
on the left; and, employability and life skills, on the right. In this
project, we will be exploring the common ground between these two life
stages, as well as the characteristics and skills that are highlighted
in the formal education system in the years between. What is notable
just from the skills and characteristics noted in Figure 4 is the common
ground between what is valued at the two life stages. Whether or how
these skills are addressed in the school years is at the heart of this
project. Skills for a Changing World will undertake a review of the
evidence of skills development in the formal education system. The
review will have two components. The first is an analysis that describes
salient characteristics in early childhood development and identifies
the associations of these characteristics with skill development in
adolescence and early adulthood. This analysis will draw especially upon
the fields of psychology and education. The second component is a study
describing the workforce demand in the focus countries and linking it
with the skills implied by the analysis of the demand.

### vagueness bad - general

#### Their framework produces worse policy---vague shifting conceals weaknesses and results in manipulation that turns their impact

**Galles 2009** (Gary, Professor of Economics at Pepperdine, "Vagueness
as a Political Strategy," March 2,
<http://blog.mises.org/archives/author/gary_galles/>)

The problem with such vagueness is that [any informed public policy
decision has to be based on specific proposals. Absent concrete
details]{.underline}, which is where the devil lurks, [no
one\--including those proposing a \"reform\"\--can judge how it would
fare or falter in the real world]{.underline}. So when the President
wants approval for a proposal which offers too few details for
evaluation, we must ask why. Like private sector salesmen, politicians
strive to present their wares as attractively as possible. Unlike them,
however, a politician\'s product line consists of claimed consequences
of proposals not yet enacted. Further, politicians are unconstrained by
truth in advertising laws, which would require that claims be more than
misleading half-truths; they have fewer competitors keeping them honest;
and they face \"customers\"\--voters\-- far more ignorant about the
merchandise involved than those spending their own money. These
differences from the private sector explain why politicians\' \"sales
pitches\" for their proposals are so vague. However, if [vague proposals
are]{.underline} the best politicians can offer, they are [inadequate.
If rhetoric is unmatched by specifics, there is no reason to believe a
policy change will be an improvement, because no reliable way exists to
determine whether it will actually accomplish what is promised. Only the
details will determine the actual incentives facing the decision-makers
involved, which is the only way to forecast the results, including the
myriad of unintended consequences from unnoticed aspects]{.underline}.
We must remember that, however laudable, [goals and
promises]{.underline} and claims of cost-effectiveness that are
[inconsistent with the incentives created will go unmet]{.underline}. It
may be that President Obama knows too little of his \"solution\" to
provide specific plans. If so, he knows too little to deliver on his
promises. [Achieving intended goals then necessarily depends on blind
faith that]{.underline} Obama and [a panoply of bureaucrats,
legislators, overseers and commissions will somehow adequately grasp the
entire situation, know precisely what to do about it, and do it
right]{.underline} (and that the result will not be too painful, however
serious the problem)\--a prospect that, due to the painful lessons of
history, attracts few real believers. Alternatively, President Obama may
know the details of what he intends, but is not providing them to the
public. But [if it is necessary to conceal a plan\'s details to put the
best possible public face on it, those details must be
adverse]{.underline}. If they made a more persuasive sales pitch, a
politician would not hide actual details. They would be trumpeted at
every opportunity, proving to a skeptical public he really had the
answers, since concealing rather than revealing pays only when better
informed citizens would be more inclined to reject a plan. [Claiming
adherence to elevated principles, but keeping detailed proposals from
sight, also has a strategic advantage. It defuses critics. Absent
details, any criticism can be parried by saying \"that was not in our
proposal\" or \"we have no plans to do that\" or other rhetorical
devices. It also allows a candidate to incorporate alternatives proposed
as part of his evolving reform, as if it was his idea all along. The new
administration has already put vague proposals on prominent display.
However, adequate analysis cannot rest upon such flimsy foundations.
That requires the nuts and bolts]{.underline} so glaringly absent. In
the private sector, people don\'t spend their own money on such vague
promises of unseen products. It is foolhardy to act any differently when
political salesmen withhold specifics, because [political incentives
guarantee that people would object to what is kept hidden. So while
vagueness may be good political strategy, it virtually ensures bad
policy]{.underline}, if Americans\' welfare is the criterion.

#### Vagueness means the aff is manipulated to fail

**Thompson 2k** (Anne, FAO, Sustainable Livelihoods Approaches at the
Policy Level

Paper prepared for FAO e-conference, March,
<http://www.livelihoods.org/pip/pip/tho2-fao.doc>) (emphasis in
original)

Policy itself can be analysed conceptually at a number of different
levels. In its broadest sense, [the term policy can be used to
include]{.underline} projects, programmes, strategies, plans and [their
implementation,]{.underline} in fact every element of public or
collective decision-making. Although it is a rather artificial
simplification, policy can be divided into content and the process of
policy formulation, in other words the way in which that content is
arrived at. [The way in which policy is implemented can change the
effective content of policy]{.underline}, either because policy
interactions have not been fully understood, or [because the policy is
subverted by those responsible for implementing it]{.underline}.

January/February, online)

It would be a mistake to believe that the only situation that influences
justices comes from within the Supreme Court building or individual
judges' limited spheres of interaction. The mechanisms designed to keep
the judiciary independent of the other branches of government are
necessarily incomplete, and there is good evidence that judges
frequently interpret laws in ways that align with the particular policy
desires of sitting members of Congress and the current president. This
is not surprising given the forces that Congress and the president can
bring to bear on the judiciary---including limiting or even stripping
jurisdiction in certain areas, altering the size of federal courts, and
instituting impeachment hearings. Just as important is the fact that
[the court cannot implement its orders without the acquiescence and
assistance of other government actors]{.underline}. In addition,
lower-court judges may be constrained by pressures not to be overruled
by higher courts or the need to stake out particular positions in order
to improve their chances of promotion within the judiciary.

### ccl/dual-use

#### The 600 series & spacecraft-related items are ECCN

Look first within the new [600 series]{.underline} entry under the
specific category for your products. These are [items]{.underline} that
[used to be on the USML but were moved to the CCL as part of the export
reform efforts.]{.underline} Next, look at [spacecraft-related items or
what the USML refers to as the 9x515 ECCNs]{.underline}, where the x
represents the five product groups: A--E. If your item is not described
in the 600 series codes or the 9x515 ECCNs, determine whether it falls
within the [catch-all paragraph of these classifications as parts,
components, accessories or attachments specially designed for items in
that specific ECCN. If your product is not listed in the two above, look
in the CCL for dual-use items.]{.underline}

#### The USML is distinct from ECCN's which are dual use

In simplest terms, [the USML is a list of defense articles and services
that are specifically designed,]{.underline} developed, configured,
adapted or modified [for a military application and don't have a
predominant civil application]{.underline} or civil performance
equivalent; [have significant military or intelligence applicability;
and could be classified as a defense article or defense
service.]{.underline} The USML list can be found in 22 C.F.R. Chapter I,
Subchapter M, Part 121. The USML is divided into 16 sections with seven
sections reserved for future use; one section addressing the general
USML list and the remaining sections further describing and adding to
the USML. You need to have a registration number with the DDTC if you're
shipping these goods in the first place. If goods fall under
jurisdiction of the State Department, you're always going to need a
license. You can find out more about the USML in the following articles:

Security Cooperation Program Suspensions

[Security cooperation programs may be suspended]{.underline} by the
Department of State (DoS) [for various reason]{.underline}s, as
described in Chapter 2 of this textbook and the SAMM C6.6. [If the DoS
determines that it is necessary to suspend security cooperation to a
particular country, it issues guidance for execution]{.underline}. [Upon
receipt of this guidance, the]{.underline} Defense Security Cooperation
Agency ([DSCA) issues appropriate instructions to the implementing
agency]{.underline} informing the Combatant Commander and the Security
Cooperation Organization (SCO).

[The DoS may direct that all deliveries of defense articles to the
suspended country be stopped immediately. Materiel is not released
to]{.underline} the country's freight forwarder or to [the country. In
the absence of such direction, materiel support cases implemented prior
to the effective date of sanctions are allowed to continue regardless of
term. New LOAs are not signed. If procurements have started but
contracts have not been awarded, the IA provides details to DSCA and
requests guidance. Contracts that have been awarded should continue.
However, when items are ready for delivery, DSCA issues guidance on
possible diversion of the materiel to another country, to the DoD
itself, or to storage consistent with DoS guidance.]{.underline}

[If the DoS so directs, shipments of defense articles, where the
materiel is under USG control, are not loaded at the ports of
embarkation. Materiel already in route to the country is not delivered;
it is retained under USG control]{.underline}. These articles are stored
by the appropriate DoD component until DSCA issues further direction.

[Materiel ready for shipment from a contractor may be shipped to a DoD
facility for segregated storage to await DSCA disposition
instructions]{.underline}. If economical, the materiel may be stored at
the contractor's facility. The purchaser is responsible for any storage
fees if the title has passed. Any requisitions submitted against either
a Cooperative Logistics Supply Support Agreement (CLSSA) or a blanket
order FMS case may be required to be held by the IA and not be filled.
[The DoS may extend a suspension to become a cancellation in accordance
with AECA, Sections 2(b) and 42(e). DSCA directs case cancellation and
appropriate contract actions to include termination]{.underline}. DSCA
provides guidance on the disposition of items, funding, etc., after a
case-by-case review.

[The]{.underline} Foreign Military Sales ([FMS) program manages
government-to-government purchases of U.S. defense articles and defense
services]{.underline} that are [on the]{.underline} U.S. Munitions List
([USML]{.underline}) for export to foreign countries. [The]{.underline}
Direct Commercial Sales ([DCS) program regulates U.S. companies\'
international sales of U.S. defense articles and defense services that
are on the USML]{.underline}. The Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 and the
Arms Export Control Act of 1976 provide the primary legal basis for the
FMS and DCS programs, which require Congressional notification and other
reporting steps.

What are the main legal means by which U.S. weapons are sold abroad?

[There are]{.underline} now [five main mechanisms by which U.S. weapons
and military services are sold]{.underline} abroad: Foreign Military
Sales ([FMS)]{.underline}, Foreign Military Construction Sales
([FMCS]{.underline}), Excess Defense Articles ([EDA]{.underline}) sales,
Direct Commercial Sales ([DCS]{.underline}), [and Commerce Department
600 series sales]{.underline}. The first three mechanisms are
government-to-government sales and the latter two are commercial arms
sales. The Obama Administration split the control system for commercial
arms sales into two separate programs starting in 2013 as part of its
Export Control Reform Initiative (see below question for more
information). In government-to-government sales, the U.S. government
negotiates directly with the foreign government buying the weapons. The
U.S. government often approves commercial arms sales, but these deals
are negotiated between U.S. companies and foreign buyers.

#### Reductions of arms sales grounded in [existing]{.underline} legislative conditions on arms sales are topical

and Frequently Asked Questions",
<https://fas.org/sgp/crs/weapons/IF11197.pdf>) MT \*trigger warning:
Rape and torture

- Even if poorly enforced, all arms sales have some condition tied to it

How does the current Administration's conventional arms transfer policy
address human rights considerations? Pursuant to a national security
presidential memorandum of April 19, 2018, [**U.S. arms transfer
decisions must take into consideration several factors,** including
"human rights and international humanitarian law." **Specified
considerations include the risk that an arms transfer would contribute
to abuses of human rights, including acts of gender-based violence and
acts of violence against children.**]{.underline} The memorandum
prohibits transfers of conventional arms if the U.S. government has
"actual knowledge at the time of authorization" that such a transfer
"will be used" to commit genocide, crimes against humanity, or certain
human rights violations in breach of the Geneva Conventions. How does
U.S. policy guidance on arms sales address human rights consideration?
The Security Assistance Management Manual (SAMM) provides the U.S.
Department of Defense (DOD) with policy guidance for executing arms
sales. Among its provisions, the SAMM [requires senior U.S. Embassy
leadership to prepare a **Country Team Assessment (CTA)** that describes
and justifies support for a proposed arms sale]{.underline}. Such CTAs
accompany letters of request for certain significant arms sales,
including those requiring congressional notification pursuant to Section
36 of the AECA. According to Table C5.T1 of the SAMM, all CTAs must
include a description of the "human rights ... record of the proposed
recipient and the potential misuse of the defense articles in question."
How does the U.S. government verify that recipients use defense articles
as authorized? Pursuant to Sections 38(g)(7) and 40A(a) of the AECA (22
U.S.C. 2778(g)(7) and 2785(a)), and Section 505(a)(3) of the FAA (22
U.S.C. 2314(a)(3)), [U.S. origin defense articles sold via FMS and DCS
are subject to **end-use monitoring (EUM)**]{.underline} to ensure that
recipients use such items solely for their intended purposes. [DOD's
Defense Security Cooperation Agency manages the department's Golden
Sentry EUM program]{.underline} for defense articles sold via FMS. The
State Department's Directorate of Defense Trade Controls coordinates the
Blue Lantern program, which performs an analogous function for items
sold via DCS. Can arms embargoes be applied on the basis of human rights
concerns? **[Human rights considerations are among the reasons the
United States may invoke to impose an arms embargo on a foreign
government and prohibit U.S. persons from selling or transferring
defense articles to such governments.]{.underline}** The International
Traffic in Arms Regulations reflect the executive branch's
implementation of statutory provisions related to the export of defense
articles, including those related to arms embargoes. In addition, [the
U.N. Security Council may apply an arms embargo against a country for
human rights purposes]{.underline}; Section 5 of the United Nations
Participation Act of 1945 (22 U.S.C. 287c) authorizes the President to
implement such sanctions. Do the Leahy Laws apply to arms sales? The
U.S. "Leahy Laws"---Section 620M of the FAA (22 U.S.C. 2378d) and 10
U.S.C. 362---prohibit U.S. security assistance to a foreign security
force unit when there is credible information that such unit has
committed a "gross violation of human rights" (GVHR)---described by the
State Department to mean (1) torture, (2) extrajudicial killing, (3)
enforced disappearance, or (4) rape under color of law (in which a
perpetrator abuses their official position to commit rape). In order to
comply with the laws, [the State Department leads a process of
unit-level GVHR vetting before providing security assistance, including
training and equipping]{.underline}. The Leahy Laws, however, do not
define security assistance; in practice, the executive branch considers
the term to mean support provided with U.S.- appropriated funds and, in
its view, the restrictions are thus not applicable to FMS or DCS.

# circumvention

### circumvention - fyi

#### FMS and DCS are only 2 of 14 statutorally authorized security asstance programs that sell or transfer arms

**DISCS** (Defense Institute of Security Cooperation Studies) January
**2019** "The Management of Security Cooperation", otherwise known as
the "Green Book", the textbook used to educate personnel,
<https://www.discs.dsca.mil/_pages/resources/default.aspx?section=publications&type=greenbook>

Security Assistance

Over the years, [security assistance has included programs authorized by
the FAA or AECA]{.underline}. According to the FAA, as amended, the term
"Security Assistance" means; military assistance, economic support fund,
military education and training, peacekeeping operations, anti-terrorism
assistance, sales of defense articles or services, export to or for the
armed forces, police, intelligence or other international security
forces of a foreign country. While many of these programs are
administered by DoD, specifically by DSCA, they remain under the general
control of the Department of State (DoS).

**Foreign Military Sales**

[The]{.underline} foreign military sales ([FMS) program is a
non-appropriated program administered by DSCA through which eligible
foreign governments purchase defense articles, services, and training
from the USG]{.underline}. The purchasing government pays all costs
associated with a sale. [There is a signed government-to- government
agreement,]{.underline} normally [documented on a]{.underline} Letter of
Offer and Acceptance ([LOA) between the USG and a foreign government.
Each LOA is commonly referred to as a "case" and is assigned a unique
case identifier for accounting purposes]{.underline}. Under FMS,
military articles and services, including training, may be provided from
DoD stocks (Section 21, AECA) or from new procurement (Section 22,
AECA). If the source of supply is new procurement, on the basis of
having an LOA which has been accepted by the foreign government, the USG
agency or MILDEP assigned cognizance for this case is authorized to
enter into a subsequent contractual arrangement with U.S. industry in
order to provide the article or service requested. FMS is a large
program with the final FMS total for FY 2018 being \$55.6 billion. This
includes \$4.4 billion in pseudo LOA agreements.

**Foreign Military Construction Services**

Foreign Military Construction Services ([FMCS) is a non-appropriated
program administered by DSCA and authorized by Section 29, AECA which
designates the President to sell design and construction services to any
eligible foreign country or international organization. The construction
sales agreement and sales procedures generally parallel those of
FMS]{.underline} and are usually implemented by the MILDEP civil
engineering agencies.

**Foreign Military Financing Program**

The Foreign Military Financing Program ([FMFP) is an appropriated
program administered by DSCA that]{.underline} has undergone a variety
of substantive and terminological changes over the years. At present,
the program [consists of congressionally appropriated grants and loans
which enable eligible foreign governments to purchase U.S. defense
articles, services, and training generally through FMS, or direct
commercial sales (DCS) for select countries.]{.underline} Foreign
military sales credit (FMSCR) is authorized under the provisions of
Sections 23 and 24, AECA, and originally served to provide credit
(loans) as an effective means for easing the transition of foreign
governments from grant aid, e.g., Military Assistance Program (MAP) and
International Military Education and Training (IMET), to cash purchases.

Prior to FY 1989, the USG variously identified this financing program as
the Foreign Military Sales Credit Program or the Foreign Military Sales
Financing Program. In the FY 1989 Foreign Operations Appropriations Act
(FOAA), Congress introduced a new title, the FMFP, and further
identified the forgiven loan/forgiven credit component of the program as
FMFP grants to distinguish them from repayable direct FMFP loans. Also,
the terms non-repayable loans or non-repayable credits are often used by
various security assistance organizations (including DSCA) in place of
the term "FMFP grants." Beginning in FY 1992, the Federal Credit Reform
Act of 1992 (P.L. 101-508) changed the method of accounting and
budgeting for all government loans, including FMFP loans issued under
the AECA. This legislation provides a more accurate portrayal of the
true cost of loans by providing new budget authority only for the
subsidy element of the loan program and is the basis for the
establishment of two new financial accounts:

• The first contains only the FMFP grant portion of the program
administrative costs

• The second account provides the budget authority needed to fund the
subsidy element of the proposed loan programs

While there are previously authorized FMFP loans still being repaid to
the USG, the FMFP grant element (no repayment) has become the norm.

Over the past several of years, per the Presidential Policy Directive 23
of April 2013 (PPD 23), new FMF pilot programs have been established
under the authority of Section 23 of the AECA---the Foreign Military
Financing Challenge Fund (FMFCF) and Foreign Military Financing Regional
Funds (FMFRF). The FMFCF is intended to provide one-time investments for
special projects for a partner nation that has demonstrated political
will to pursue reform efforts, contribute to common goals, and build
lasting, self-sustaining capabilities. The FMFRF provides flexibility
and responsiveness in implementing portions of the FMF program based
upon geographic region. For example, in FY 2016, \$5 million was
provided for the FMF European Security Assistance Fund (ESAF). Through a
competitive proposal system these FY 2016 ESAF funds are available for
countries in Europe and Eurasia that have received bilateral FMF with
the five fiscal years prior to submission. FMFP funding for FY 2018 was
\$5.7 billion. The FY 2019 Congressional Budget Justification (CBJ)
request is for \$5.3 billion. All FMFP appropriations are grants;
however the FY 2019 CBJ requests this funding to be used for a
combination of loans and grants to partner nations.

**Leases**

[Chapter 6, AECA, authorizes the President to lease defense articles to
friendly governments or international organizations for up to five years
(renewable). This non-appropriated program is administered by DSCA. The
law allows the lease of defense articles only for compelling foreign
policy or national security reasons, and stipulates the recipient, with
some exceptions, must bear the full cost of the lease.]{.underline}
Furthermore, the U.S. must not need the leased articles during the lease
period, and the U.S. retains the right to terminate the lease at any
time. For the recipient country, l[eases may be cheaper than purchasing
the article outright, and they provide a convenient vehicle for
obtaining defense articles for temporary use. Leases are executed
through a lease agreement, with an associated FMS case to cover repair,
training, supply support and/or transportation, if
required]{.underline}.

**Military Assistance Program**

In FY 1990, the Military Assistance Program (MAP) was formally merged
with the FMFP as Congress adopted an administration proposal for
integrating all MAP grant funding into the appropriations account for
the FMFP. DSCA administered this appropriated program. However, Congress
has not appropriated MAP funds for subsequent fiscal years, and there is
no interest in seeking any such funds for the future. This legislative
change, therefore, had the dual effect of causing existing MAP-funded
programs to lose their former identity and become FMFP-funded programs
and establishing the FMFP as the major U.S. financing program for the
acquisition of U.S. defense articles and services by foreign
governments.

MAP remains as a current security assistance program because the
MAP-provided articles remain throughout the world. As such, these
articles retain their requirements for end-use monitoring (EUM), their
return to the USG when no longer needed, and the requirement to return
to the USG any proceeds from a sale to a third country or scrapping.

**International Military Education and Training**

[The]{.underline} International Military Education and Training [(IMET)
program provides grant financial assistance for training in the U.S.
and]{.underline}, in some cases, [in overseas facilities to selected
foreign military and civilian personnel.]{.underline} In earlier years,
grant aid training of foreign military personnel was funded as part of
the MAP appropriation. Starting with FY 1976, a separate authorization
for IMET was established in Section 541, FAA. DSCA administrates this
appropriated program. Although historically a relatively modest program
in terms of cost, both the President and Congress attach significant
importance to this program. The [recipient countries]{.underline},
likewise, [rely heavily on this grant program and in many cases, this
program serves as the only method to receive training from the U.S.
military.]{.underline}

At a time of declining foreign aid budgets, IMET advances U.S.
objectives on a global scale at a relatively small cost. In many
countries, having a core group of well-trained, professional leaders
with firsthand knowledge of America will make a difference in winning
access and influence for our diplomatic and military representatives.
Thus, a relatively small amount of IMET funding will provide a return
for U.S. policy goals, over the years, far greater than the original
investment.

In 1980, Section 644(m)(5), FAA, was amended to authorize IMET tuition
costing in terms of the additional costs that the USG incurs in
furnishing such assistance. [Section 21(a)(1)(C), AECA, was also amended
to allow IMET recipients to purchase FMS training on an additional cost
basis]{.underline}. The practical effect of these changes was to
substantially reduce tuition costs for IMET-funded students, thereby
increasing the amount of training an eligible country can obtain by
using both national funds for FMS purchases and also using alloted IMET
grant funds.

**[Expanded IMET]{.underline}**

The FY 1991 Foreign Operations Appropriation Act (FOAA) introduced an
IMET initiative via a Senate-proposed earmark of \$1 million to be used
exclusively for expanded IMET courses for foreign officers. Congress
later [allowed this initiative to include civilian managers and
administrators of defense establishments]{.underline}. The focus of such
training is on developing professional level management skills, with
emphasis on military justice systems, codes of conduct, and the
protection of human rights. Congress amended Section 541, FAA to permit
non-Ministry of Defense civilian government personnel to be eligible for
this program, if such military education and training would:

• Contribute to responsible defense resource management

• Foster greater respect for and understanding of the principle of
civilian control of the military

• Contribute to cooperation between military and law enforcement
personnel with respect to counter-narcotics law enforcement efforts

• Improve military justice systems and procedures in accordance with
internationally recognized human rights

In FY 1993, Congress further extended this expanded IMET (E-IMET)
program to also include participation by national legislators who are
responsible for oversight and management of the military. Through
P.L.104-164, Congress again amended the E-IMET program authority in 1996
to also include non-governmental organization personnel.

The IMET funding for FY 2016 was \$108 million. The IMET funding
requested for FY 2017 was \$110 million. In the 2018 Consolidated
Appropriations Act Congress appropriated \$111 million for IMET for
2018. The FY 2019 Congressional Budget Justification requests \$95
million for this program.

**[Drawdowns & Special Presidential Waiver Authority]{.underline}**

[During a crisis, Section 506, FAA, authorizes the President to provide
USG articles, services, and training to friendly countries and
international organizations at no cost, to include transportation,
spares, and training. There is a \$100 million ceiling per fiscal year
on articles, services, and training provided for military purposes and
another fiscal year ceiling of \$200 million for articles, services and
training required for non-military purposes such as disaster relief,
nonproliferation, anti-terrorism, counter-narcotics, refugee assistance,
and Vietnam War-era missing in action/prisoners of war (MIA/ POW)
location and repatriation.]{.underline} When emergency support for
peacekeeping operations is required, Section 552(c)(2), FAA, separately
authorizes the President to drawdown up to \$25 million per fiscal year
in USG articles and services from any agency. Special drawdown
authorities have been annually legislated in the State Department and
Foreign Operations Appropriation Acts (S/FOAA) to include \$30 million
in support for the Yugoslav International Criminal Court. When the USG
avails DoD defense articles, services, or training via drawndowns; DSCA
administers these non-appropriated authorities.

**[Economic Support Fund]{.underline}**

[The]{.underline} Economic Support Fund ([ESF) is authorized by Chapter
4 of Part II of the FAA. ESF is an appropriated program administered by
the]{.underline} U.S. Agency for International Development
([USAID]{.underline}). Congress established [this fund to promote
economic and political stability in areas where the U.S. has special
political and security interests and where the U.S. has determined that
economic assistance can be useful in helping to secure peace or to avert
major economic or political crises]{.underline}. ESF is a flexible
economic instrument available on a grant basis for a variety of
purposes, including balance of payments support, infrastructure, and
other capital and technical assistance development projects, in addition
to funding a variety of programs to enhance political stability. In
earlier years, the ESF program included concessional (i.e., low interest
rate) loans as well as grants; recently all ESF funds receive allocation
as grant assistance. While a substantial amount of these ESF grants are
used to provide balance of payments, the ESF also provides for programs
aimed at primary needs in health, education, agriculture, and family
planning. Where long-term political and economic stability is the
primary concern, ESF finances projects that meet the basic needs of the
poor.

The ESF for FY 2016 totaled \$4.49 billion. The ESF requested for FY
2017 was \$6.08 billion. In the 2018 Consolidated Appropriations Act
Congress appropriated \$1.816 billion for ESF for 2018. The FY 2019
Congressional Budget Justification requests for economic and development
assistance through a consolidated account- the Economic Support and
Development Fund (ESDF)-that will replace the separate account for the
Economic Support Fund (ESF) and consolidate it with other program
accounts. The FY 2018 request for this consolidated fund is \$4.9
billion. For FY 2019, the Congressional Budget Justification request is
at \$5.06 billion. All EDSF appropriations are grants.

**[Peacekeeping Operations]{.underline}**

Peacekeeping Operations ([PKO) is an appropriated program authorized by
Chapter 6 of Part II of the FAA.]{.underline} For several years, PKO
provided funds for the Multinational Force and Observers (MFO), which
implemented the 1979 Egyptian-Israeli peace treaty, and the U.S.
contribution to the United Nations Force in Cyprus (UNFICYP).
[Subsequent funding has been provided to support peacekeeping efforts in
the Balkans, East Timor, sub-Saharan Africa, and lately in the Darfur
region of the Sudan, South Sudan, and Somalia.]{.underline}

Global Peace Operations Initiative

Global Peace Operations Initiative (GPOI), which has become the
principal PKO program, was originally a Presidential initiative in
coordination with other G-8 countries to increase the capacity of
selected countries to deploy in support of international peacekeeping
operations. It was envisioned as a five-year program (FYs 2005-2009) to
train seventy-five thousand troops worldwide, with emphasis in the
Africa region and building an African command headquarters capability.
GPOI is to support the deployment of peacekeepers by providing
equipment, transportation, training, and sustainment in the field.
Remaining a DoS program requiring DoD support, GPOI subsumed the
previous SA-funded PKO Africa Contingency Operations Training and
Assistance (ACOTA) program and the FMFPfunded Enhanced International
Peacekeeping Capabilities (EIPC) program. The ACOTA term is still used
when referring to the Africa training component of GPOI.

The FY 2016 PKO fund was \$600 million. All PKO appropriations for FY
2016 totaled \$600 million. In the 2018 Consolidated Appropriations Act
Congress appropriated \$213 million for PKO for 2018. The FY 2019
Congressional Budget Justification requests \$291 million. All PKO
appropriations are grants managed by the DoS.

International Narcotics Control and Law Enforcement

The International Narcotics Control and Law Enforcement (INCLE) program
is an appropriated grant program which the DoS administers. Authorized
by Section 481, FAA, INCLE is intended to suppress the worldwide illicit
manufacture and trafficking of narcotic and psychotropic drugs, money
laundering, and precursor chemical diversion, and the progressive
elimination of the illicit cultivation of the applicable crops.
Recently, the elimination of related narco-terrorism has been included.
This program can include the purchase of defense articles, services, and
training. This is similar to the authorized and funded programs within
DoD and the Departments of Justice and Homeland Security. In FY 2017,
DoS received \$1.2 billion for the INCLE program. The 2018 Consolidated

Appropriations Act appropriated \$951 million for INCLE. For FY 2019,
the Congressional Budget Justification requests \$880 million for this
program.

**[Nonproliferation, Antiterrorism, Demining, and Related
Programs]{.underline}**

[The DoS administers a series of appropriated grant programs
collectively known as the Nonproliferation, Antiterrorism, Demining, and
Related (NADR) programs.]{.underline} Part II, Chapters 8 and 9 of the
FAA, and Section 504 of the FREEDOM Support Act authorize NADR.
Additionally, Section 23, AECA, for NADR focuses on demining activities,
the clearance of unexploded ordnance, the destruction of small arms,
border security, and related activities. [Related defense articles,
services, and training can be provided through this
program.]{.underline} U.S. funding support for the International Atomic
Energy Agency and the Comprehensive Nuclear Test Ban Treaty Preparatory
Commission is provided through this program. The DoD role in this
program is that DoS can purchase demining, unexploded ordnance
clearance, and anti-terrorism systems with this funding.

In FY 2016, NADR funding was \$885 million. For FY 2017, this program
received \$970 million. In the 2018 Consolidated Appropriations Act,
Congress appropriated \$655 million for NADR for 2018. The FY 2019
Congressional Budget justification requests is \$690 million.

**[Direct Commercial Sales]{.underline}**

Direct Commercial Sales ([DCS) are commercial exports of defense
articles, services, and training licensed under the authority of Section
38, AECA, made by U.S. defense industry directly to a foreign
government. Unlike the procedures employed for FMS, DoD does not
administer DCS transactions and a DCS sale does not normally include a
government-to-government agreement]{.underline}. Rather, the DoS
Directorate of Defense Trade Controls (PM/DDTC) implements the required
USG controls through licensing. The International Traffic in Arms
Regulations (ITAR) \[22 CFR 120-130\] contains the dayto- day rules and
procedures for Direct Commercial Sales.

[Of note, not all license approvals will result in signed contracts and
later actual deliveries. Like FMS, DCS deliveries are likely to take
place years after U.S. industry obtains the export license]{.underline}
from PM/DDTC and the interested parties sign the commercial contract.

[Other Security Assistance Programs]{.underline}

**[Excess Defense Articles]{.underline}**

Excess defense articles ([EDA) identified by the MILDEP or DoD agency
are authorized for sale using the FMS authority in Section 21, AECA, and
FMS processes identified within the SAMM for property belonging to the
USG. Prices range from five to fifty percent of original acquisition
value, depending on the condition of the article.]{.underline}

[Additionally, Section 516, FAA, authorizes the President to transfer
EDA on a grant basis to eligible countries]{.underline} (annually
identified within a joint DoD/DoS letter to Congress). While EDA can be
transferred at no-cost, the recipient must typically pay for any
transportation or repair charges. Under certain circumstances,
transportation charges may be waived, with the cost absorbed by DoD
appropriated funds.

**[Third-Country Transfers]{.underline}**

[Section 3(d), AECA, authorizes the President to manage and approve the
transfer of U.S.-origin defense articles from the original recipient
country to a third country. Requests for third-country transfers are
normally approved if the USG is willing to conduct a direct transfer to
the third-country. Countries must obtain third-country transfer
authority in writing from the DoS in advance of the proposed
transfer]{.underline}. This applies to all U.S.-origin defense articles
regardless of the method of original transfer from the USG or U.S.
industry. More can be found on this subject in the Chapter on End-Use
Monitoring and Third Party Transfers.

#### FMS and DCS aren't the only means of arms sales

U.S. conventional arms export policy is codified in [Presidential
Decision Directive 34,]{.underline} set by President Bill Clinton in
1995. This directive [guides U.S. arms exports decisions and
establishes]{.underline} the [foreign policy goals for U.S. conventional
arms transfers.]{.underline} These include: • Ensuring that U.S.
military forces enjoy technological advantages over potential
adversaries; • Helping allies and friends deter or defend themselves
against aggression, while promoting interoperability with U.S. forces
when combined operations are required; • Promoting regional stability in
areas critical to U.S. interest, while preventing the proliferation of
weapons of mass destruction and their missile delivery systems; •
Promoting peaceful conflict resolution and arms controls, human rights,
democratization, and other foreign policy objectives; • Enhancing the
ability of the U.S. defense industrial base to meet U.S. defense
requirements and maintain long-term military technological superiority
at lower costs. Still, the United States cannot necessarily sell weapons
to any country that meets one of these conditions. Arms exports also
must be consistent with three crucial laws and two implementing
regulations. [The 1979 Arms Export Control Act]{.underline} (AECA) is
one of the crucial laws. This statute [stipulates the purposes for which
weapons may be transferred]{.underline} (self-defense, internal
security, and UN operations) and establishes the process by which the
executive branch must give Congress advance notice of major sales. The
AECA also requires a series of quarterly and annual reports from the
Departments of Defense and State to Congress on overseas sales activity.
[Executive Order 11958 delegates responsibility for the implementation
of the AECA]{.underline} primarily to the State and Defense Departments.
At the State Department, the Directorate of Defense Trade Controls
develops and updates the International Traffic in Arms Regulations
(ITAR), which implements the AECA. [These regulations contain a U.S.
munitions list]{.underline} that covers all weapons regulated by the
State Department[. They also list those countries]{.underline} that are
[ineligible to receive weapons]{.underline} under U.S. law. A second
essential law is t[he 1961 Foreign Assistance Act]{.underline}, which
[guides provision of economic and military assistance to foreign
governments]{.underline}. For example, this act requires that weapon
exports not undermine long-term security and stability, weaken
democratic movements, support military coups, escalate arms races or
exacerbate ongoing conflicts. Nor are the exported weapons supposed to
cause arms buildups in unstable regions or be used to commit human
rights abuses. The third major law is [the 1970 Export Administration
Act,]{.underline} which [governs shipments of dual-use
goods]{.underline}, technology and information with both military and
civilian uses. The act lapsed in 1994 but has been retained under the
emergency powers of the president. [It is administered by the Department
of Commerce through the Export Administration Regulations (EAR), which
govern the sales activities of exporters of these items]{.underline}, as
ITAR does for munitions. [The EAR contain the Commerce Control
List,]{.underline} which includes certain ballistic missile production
technologies, dual-use chemicals, shotguns, and police equipment. [These
laws govern]{.underline} many different types of arms sales and military
assistance programs. [The largest sales programs]{.underline} are: •
[Foreign Military Sales (FMS): government-to-government sales negotiated
by the Pentagon]{.underline}, in which the [weapons come from existing
Pentagon stocks or new production]{.underline}; • [Direct Commercial
Sales (DCS): arms sales concluded between U.S. weapons manufacturers and
foreign clients managed by the State Department.]{.underline} The
largest military assistance programs are: • [Excess Defense Articles
(EDA): surplus or obsolete U.S. weapons given away]{.underline} for free
or at [a dramatically reduced cost]{.underline} to foreign governments;
• [Foreign Military Financing (FMF): grants to foreign governments that
are used to purchase]{.underline} weapons, training, and other [defense
articles and services]{.underline} from the United States; •
[International Military Education and Training (IMET): grants for
members of foreign governments and militaries to participate in any of
more than 2,000 courses in U.S. military management and technical
training]{.underline}. [Although much smaller in dollar value, the
United States also offers military training separate from or part of
other arms packages. Military training is an important foreign policy
tool]{.underline} used to bolster support for U.S. values and interests
in foreign governments and military institutions, as well as to
establish common military goals, procedures, and mechanisms. The
utilization of military training to build military and political
relationships is part of an emerging trend that began at the end of the
Cold War. In the last decade, the United States has trained more than
100,000 foreign soldiers, police, and civilians annually through these
programs. Such training programs, which take place within the United
States and in about 150 countries around the world, range from
English-language training and counternarcotics strategies to preparation
of forces for peacekeeping operations.

[**There are now five main mechanisms by which U.S. weapons and military
services are sold abroad:** Foreign Military Sales (FMS), Foreign
Military Construction Sales (FMCS), Excess Defense Articles (EDA) sales,
Direct Commercial Sales (DCS), and Commerce Department 600 series
sales.]{.underline} The first three mechanisms are
government-to-government sales and the latter two are commercial arms
sales. The Obama Administration split the control system for commercial
arms sales into two separate programs starting in 2013 as part of its
Export Control Reform Initiative (see below question for more
information). In government-to-government sales, the U.S. government
negotiates directly with the foreign government buying the weapons. The
U.S. government often approves commercial arms sales, but these deals
are negotiated between U.S. companies and foreign buyers.

### circumvention - funding

#### FMS and DCS are funded by recipient countries -- they are managed by separate accounting procedures

the "Green Book", the textbook used to educate personnel,

[The FMS and DCS components of SA are normally funded by direct cash
outlays of the purchasing countries]{.underline}. These two programs can
also be funded using appropriated FMFP funds or, in the case of Building
Partner Capacity (BPC) programs, DoD SC funds. [Consequently, the FMS
and DCS do not require Congressional budget authorizations or
appropriations]{.underline}. Nevertheless, the financial activity
generated by FMS cash purchases has a substantial impact on USG
financial programs[. **Special accounting procedures have been
instituted for the management of these funds**, and FMS cash activities
are documented in the annual U.S. budget in terms of the FMS Trust
Fund]{.underline}. This trust fund will be furthered addressed later in
Chapter 12 of this text, "Financial Management."

### circumvention -- motivation -- trump

#### Trump cares only for the economy -- he's circumvented conventional arms export policy and would exploit any loophole

**Ward, 5/24** \[Alex, associate director in the Atlantic Council\'s

military issues and US foreign policy, 5/24/19, 'The US may use a

[The US may use a loophole to sell billions in weapons to Saudi Arabia
and the UAE It would let]{.underline} the [Trump]{.underline}
administration [circumvent Congress's authority to approve or reject
weapons sales.]{.underline} A fighter aligned with Yemen's Saudi-led
coalition-backed government shows Houthi rebel land mines the militia
had recovered on September 22, 2018, in al-Himah, Yemen. Andrew
Renneisen/Getty Images [The US plans to send billions of dollars in
weapons to Middle Eastern allies --- including Saudi Arabia --- by
**declaring an emergency that** experts say **doesn't really
exist.**]{.underline} Multiple reports detail that [Trump officials are
considering using a legal loophole within days to export roughly \$7
billion in arms to Saudi Arabia and the United Arab
Emirates,]{.underline} both of which have waged a brutal war in Yemen
against Houthi rebels for more than four years. The idea, pushed by
Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and other top officials, would allow the
administration to circumvent Congress's authority to approve or reject
weapons sales. [There is a provision in a weapons export law allowing
the executive branch to sell arms without congressional sign-off if "an
emergency exists which requires the proposed sale in the national
security interest of the United States." Administrations rarely invoke
it]{.underline}, experts say, mainly [because of how controversial it is
and the high bar required to claim a dire situation exists.]{.underline}
President [George W. Bush used the provision in 2006 to send
precision-guided weapons to Israel during the Israel-Hezbollah July
Wa]{.underline}r, but [that was last time an administration took
advantage of the loophole.]{.underline} President Donald Trump likely
will claim that Saudi Arabia and the UAE need new munitions because they
face repeated attacks from Houthi rebels. However, the Yemen war has
raged since 2015, with the US supporting the Saudi-led coalition's side.
[It's jarring now to say that an emergency exists after all this time,
especially when the US previously sold weapons to the Saudis through the
normal process.]{.underline} There's also the fact that introducing more
weapons to the war will likely worsen a catastrophic situation. The
conflict has already claimed tens of thousands of lives; some estimates
indicate that at least 60,000 people have died, though it's hard to keep
an accurate tally because of dangerous conditions in Yemen. Last August,
the Saudi-led coalition carried out a horrific attack on a school bus
where dozens of people, including 40 children, died. The US sending more
munitions to Saudi Arabia and the UAE likely won't do much to tip the
scales of the fight --- but could imperil the lives of millions of
people in Yemen already suffering from wounds, famine, and disease. "The
**[Trump]{.underline}** administration **[is manufacturing an emergency
to push through the sale of deadly weapons]{.underline}** to Saudi
Arabia and the United Arab Emirates," Scott Paul, a Yemen expert at the
humanitarian group Oxfam America, told me. "Once again, the Trump
administration is demonstrating that it values profit and its Gulf
allies over resolving the world's largest humanitarian crisis." The
Trump administration knows Congress likely wouldn't approve the deal
[News of the loophole plan comes at a particularly tense moment. The US
and Iran, Saudi Arabia's main regional rival, are locked in a
potentially deadly standoff.]{.underline} Earlier this month, the Trump
administration said it had intelligence showing that Iran planned to
attack Americans in the Middle East. As a result, the US put an aircraft
carrier, bomber planes, and anti-missile batteries in the region, though
it's not clear exactly where. The administration is even considering
sending thousands of troops to the region, perhaps in an effort to deter
an Iranian assault. Iran, meanwhile, told its proxies in Iraq to prepare
for war if the US attacks, and has greatly accelerated low-enriched
uranium production for its nuclear program (though it has not said that
it plans to pursue a nuclear weapon). The weeks-long crisis has split
Democrats and Republicans in Congress over just how forcefully the US
should engage Iran right now, while Saudi Arabia has mostly pushed for
America to seriously get involved. Lawmakers from both parties remain
enraged with the Trump administration's handling of the killing of Saudi
journalist, dissident, and US resident Jamal Khashoggi last October.
Despite ample evidence showing a planned, coordinated assassination,
Trump did little to punish Riyadh other than impose a few sanctions.
That wasn't enough for many Democrats and Republicans, including
reliable Trump allies. Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-SC), for example, told
reporters on Thursday that he would "not do business as usual with the
Saudis until we have a better reckoning" with Crown Prince Mohammed bin
Salman, the country's de facto ruler who US spies say ordered the
Khashoggi hit. The likely reason the administration wants to invoke the
loophole is not that an emergency exists, then, but that Trump officials
fear lawmakers might shoot down the arms sale. "President [Trump is only
using this loophole because he knows Congress would disapprove of this
sale,]{.underline}" Sen. Chris Murphy (D-CT), who first raised awareness
of the administration's plan, told the Wall Street Journal on Thursday.
"It sets an incredibly dangerous precedent that future presidents can
use to sell weapons without a check from Congress." [Trump has long
prioritized weapons sales over human rights Asked]{.underline} by
reporters last November [if he would stop a massive arms sale to Saudi
Arabia over Khashoggi's killing, Trump emphatically said
no.]{.underline} "This took place in Turkey and to the best of our
knowledge, Khashoggi is not a United States citizen," he said in the
Oval Office. "I don't like stopping massive amounts of money that's
being poured into our country," referring to his desire to sell \$110
billion worth of weapons to Riyadh, adding that "it would not be
acceptable to me." Trump on possibility of punishing Saudi Arabia for
apparently murdering a dissident journalist: \"I don\'t like stopping
massive amounts of money that\'s being poured into our country\... they
are spending \$110b on military equipment and on things that create jobs
for this country.\" Trump's comments made one thing extremely clear: He
cares much more about getting American companies paid than defending
human rights. It was perhaps one of Trump's most honest articulations
about how he conducts foreign policy: [He won't call out a country that
infringes on human dignity as long as it's willing to inject cash into
the American economy.]{.underline} Partly for that reason, Trump has
continued to strengthen America's relationship with the Saudi regime
despite its conduct in Yemen, its stoking of tensions with Iran, and the
Khashoggi murder. And now, [with the impending use of the loophole, it
appears Trump has literally put a price tag on the lives of those
already suffering in the Saudi-led war.]{.underline} "Yemenis will
continue to pay the price of the US's indefinite and unconditional
support of one side in their country's horrific war," Paul, the Oxfam
expert, told me.

[Congressional ignorance (or apathy) is precisely why the United States

security architecture in which everything can be an existential
threat.]{.underline} Rosa Brooks astutely identified this growing issue
in How Everything Became War and the Military Became Everything, where
she described how [the US military is becoming an "all-purpose tool" for
problems around the world.]{.underline} The same trend, it appears,
holds true for problems at home. [The American defense enterprise has
modernized]{.underline} and adapted to fit changing times.
Unfortunately, US [defense policy and law governing the domestic use of
the military lags]{.underline}. [It only took one president motivated by
partisan gridlock and a bedrock campaign promise to challenge tradition
and buck the status quo]{.underline}. Unless Congress acts to bring
modern American defense policies and laws into the twenty-first century,
[things like the use of executive orders to identify an existential
threat by presidential decree will only continue.]{.underline} This is
problematic because [the use of executive orders to address national
security problems is a new form of norm erosion, especially when
Congress is fully capable of passing legislation to address
threats]{.underline} to US security. For instance, Congress actually
passed legislation regarding Chinese political operations in the United
States, and appears primed to pass even more legislation to deal with
Chinese espionage, to include even restricting Chinese students and
their access, due to some of these students passing sensitive
information and technology to Chinese intelligence. However, Congress is
not fully to blame. Annoyed by congressional inaction, [President Trump
has issued more executive orders---on average, per year---than every
president since Jimmy Carter]{.underline}. [Overreliance on executive
orders can establish new norms of presidential conduct that skirt the
normal democratic process. Norm erosion in presidential behavior is not
a new phenomenon]{.underline} per se. President Franklin D. Roosevelt
was the first president to serve more than two terms, breaking with
tradition that was first established by George Washington. Several years
later, Congress would eventually pass the Twenty-Second Amendment,
formally restricting presidents to two terms, as a response to
Roosevelt's breaking of the presidential tradition. [The degradation of
presidential norms becomes insidious, though, when a supposed national
security threat can be declared a national emergency without any
check]{.underline} on this power. Following a newly established
precedent, future [presidents may continue leveraging the full extent of
executive authority in their use of the military to address virtually
any "threat.]{.underline}" Under the current national security
architecture this is completely legal. Senator Marco Rubio recently
described the slippery slope of over-securitizing threats, stating, "If
today the national emergency is border security, tomorrow the national
emergency might be climate change." This is already within the realm of
possibility given that a 2014 Department of Defense report noted that
climate change is a future trend "that will impact our national
security."

#### Trump doesn't take accountability for his actions -- he'll continue to unilaterally act without regard for consequences

**Matthews 17** \[Dylan, Vox Writer, 10/18/17, "Trump's refusal to take
responsibility is a deep moral failure" Vox, accessed at:

[President Trump doesn't take responsibility. For anything. He didn\'t
take responsibility for the death of Sgt. La David Johnson, a Green
Beret killed during a counterterror operation]{.underline} on the border
between Niger and Mali earlier this month. After going nearly two weeks
without calling Johnson\'s loved ones, Trump told his pregnant widow,
Myeshia Johnson, that her late husband \"knew what he signed up for\"
--- placing responsibility for his death not on Trump, his commander in
chief, or the rest of the government, but on Sgt. Johnson himself, for
choosing to serve. [When a Congress member who overheard the exchange
publicized it, Trump denied it ever happened.]{.underline} Except
Johnson\'s mother, who was also there, confirmed it did. Trump refused
to even take responsibility for his own callous failure to take
responsibility. And this was hardly the first time. [Trump didn't take
responsibility for the death of Army Specialist Etienne
Murph]{.underline}y in Syria in May. Murphy's mother, Sheila Murphy,
told the Associated Press that she still has not heard from Trump,
despite writing the president to tell him \"some days I don\'t want to
live.\" Trump did take the time to call the parents of Army 1st. Lt.
Weston Lee. Murphy was black; Lee was white. [Trump didn't take
responsibility right after taking office, when a botched special
operations raid in Yemen left a Navy SEAL and several civilians dead
without any actionable intelligence to show for it.]{.underline} He took
to Fox News to assert that the mission "started before I got here" and
to blame "the generals" who "lost \[Sr. Chief Petty Officer\] Ryan
\[Owens\]." He didn't take responsibility for the safety of the country
after a judge struck down his initial "travel ban" targeting some
Muslim-majority countries, tweeting, "If something happens blame him and
court system." Just this past Monday, he refused to take responsibility
for his failure to enact significant legislation on health care or taxes
so far. \"We\'re not getting the job done. And I\'m not going to blame
myself, I\'ll be honest,\" he said at a Cabinet meeting. \"They\'re not
getting the job done,\" he continued, referring to Republicans in
Congress. On Tuesday, he refused to take responsibility for the effects
of his executive actions to destabilize Obamacare, insisting on Twitter,
"Any increase in ObamaCare premiums is the fault of the Democrats for
giving us a 'product' that never had a chance of working." And on. And
on. And on. Trump is incapable of processing the idea that he might have
failed There is a tendency when discussing Trump to exaggerate the
beneficence and decency of past presidents to make the contrast starker.
So let's be clear: Trump is hardly the first American leader to fail to
take responsibility, or to take too long to do so. It took nearly four
years for President George W. Bush to concede that the war in Iraq was
failing, fire Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld, and attempt a new
strategy. Even then, he never forthrightly admitted that a war that
killed nearly 270,000 people for no clear end was a mistake. President
Bill Clinton did not admit that he contributed to the rise in mass
incarceration until 14 years after he left office. And taking
responsibility for your actions, especially belatedly, is of somewhat
limited value if those actions were mistakes and are not followed up
with effective corrective action. But it's an important first step. "The
buck stops here" is a cliché for a reason. And for presidents still in
office, that attitude can lead to actual progress. President Obama, by
his own admission, failed badly during the rollout of Obamacare in fall
2013, more grievously due to the failures of HealthCare.gov. But he took
responsibility and fixed it, launching an unprecedented number of
outside programmers and tech specialists to overhaul the site and get it
in working order. \"I take full responsibility for making sure it gets
fixed ASAP," Obama said at the time. And so he did. Here are a few other
things Obama took responsibility for while in office: The failed Tom
Daschle and Bill Richardson Cabinet nominations in 2009 The BP oil spill
in 2010 Democrats' loss of the House of Representatives in 2010 The
attack on the US Consulate in Benghazi, Libya, in 2012 The VA scandal in
2014 Democratic losses in the 2014 midterms The death of two hostages in
an operation against al-Qaeda in 2015 The Syrian government's atrocities
in Aleppo in 2016 What's telling is that this included instances when
Obama did not believe he made a mistake. As he said at the time, he had
no reason to think the al-Qaeda compound targeted in 2015 had innocent
hostages in it when he ordered the attack. His expression of sorrow at
the Syrian government's butchery was not followed by regret over his
decision not to send ground troops or launch airstrikes against Bashar
al-Assad's regime. You can view this as hollow, as a failure to actually
change in response to mistakes. But taking responsibility sometimes
means bearing the weight of negative consequences of actions that you,
nonetheless, do not regret. The horrors of Aleppo did not change Obama's
determination that further intervention against Assad would have done
more harm than good (a conclusion shared by researchers the US Holocaust
Museum commissioned to look at that decision). The deaths of the
hostages did not mean the raid was not the right decision at the time.
[But even if an action is, all told, still justifiable, its costs should
weigh on the actor. He should feel the gravity of his role in what
happened, and take seriously the human toll,]{.underline} even if his
mind does not change in response. [Nowhere is this more important than
in military affairs.]{.underline} Franklin Roosevelt needn't have
regretted D-Day to take responsibility for, and feel the weight of, the
2,500 Americans killed during the Normandy landings. [When presidents
and commentators talk]{.underline} about the sacred and solemn duty of
honoring wounded and dead soldiers, they're not just speaking in
clichés. [They're making a statement about the kind of moral psychology
you must have to make regular decisions about death and war without
growing emotionally calloused and inhumane. Trump has been very clear
that he lacks that psychology, that kind of reverence and appreciation
for the gravity of his actions.]{.underline} He cannot hold in his head
at the same time the idea that he was right to have troops in Niger and
that some of those troops died, and that he owes it to their families
and the nation to understand and grieve that loss. He definitely appears
incapable of considering that the mission itself might have been a
mistake, that he himself may have screwed up. And if he can't consider
the possibility that he caused pain when he's sending troops out to
fight and die, how could he consider it when he's making regulations
that could cost people their health insurance? Or their clean air and
water?

#### [Trump](https://www.lawfareblog.com/how-trump-will-weaken-presidency) ignores conventional norms of the executive and overreaches whenever he can

**Whittington 5/16** \[Keith E. Whittington is the William Nelson
Cromwell Professor of Politics at Princeton University, 5/16/2019, "How
Trump Will Weaken the Presidency", Lawfare Blog, accessed at:
<https://www.lawfareblog.com/how-trump-will-weaken-presidency>\] KKL

On the formal dimensions of presidential power[, Trump might well wind
up weakening the presidency by overreaching. The president has made a
habit of issuing executive orders, such as his travel ban and his swipe
at sanctuary cities, without much]{.underline} planning or careful
[thought about]{.underline} either their l[egality or their policy
efficacy.]{.underline} As a consequence, the Trump White House has
created opportunities for opponents of his administration to exploit
vulnerabilities and encourage greater judicial scrutiny of how the
president exercises his discretionary authority. [The administration has
repeatedly advanced policies, such as the declaration of a national
emergency to fund a border wall, with the thinnest veneers of legal
justification]{.underline}---veneers that the president himself, to the
consternation of his lawyers, often strips away with his own words. As a
result, the administration has ended up daring the courts to show the
kind of deference traditionally granted to presidents who have more
carefully and more cautiously used the powers available to them. Now
[Trump has embarked on an unprecedented campaign of obstruction of
congressional oversight that will likely force the courts to reevaluate
the scope of executive privilege and the limits of legislative
investigatory authority]{.underline}. It is a familiar refrain that bad
cases make bad law. Legal rules that are drafted to account for unusual
fact situations can deform the law in ways that make it less well
adjusted to respond to more routine situations. Trump's attempts to push
his legal powers to their outermost extremes risk having the courts trim
away those powers. In the past, presidents who have won the trust of
judges and legislators have been accorded more practical power to
exercise discretion and to enjoy deference. With the loss of trust, that
discretion is likely to be restricted. [By persistently testing the
limits of the president's constitutional and legal powers, Trump forces
his defenders to offer increasingly strained legal arguments to justify
his actions. By declaring a national emergency where none exists and
proposing to use funds to pay for "military construction projects" that
have no military purpose, Trump dares the courts to call his
bluff]{.underline} and expose the fact that his legal arguments are
offered in bad faith. By declaring that, in his view, preexisting
oversight efforts were "enough" and so the administration will be
"fighting all the subpoenas," he invites Congress and the courts to
assume that [his resistance to congressional oversight is purely
personal and has no firm basis in a reasonable desire to protect the
institutional prerogatives of the executive branch]{.underline}.

eks

The U.S. control system is complex. Authorities and control lists are
delegated to multiple federal agencies, and the system was created
largely piecemeal to prevent the spread of sensitive goods during the
Cold War. Governmental and non-governmental analyses, along with the
relevant exporting sectors of industry, have noted for decades serious
problems with the system, including the slow pace of obtaining an export
license, overregulation of small parts, the failure of the government to
standardize and interconnect information technology (IT) systems, and
inefficiencies and redundancies in export law enforcement efforts. With
these criticisms in mind, [the Obama administration set out]{.underline}
in 2009 [to carry out a wholesale reform of the system]{.underline}
[and]{.underline} in 2010 [launched the Export Control Reform Initiative
(ECR Initiative]{.underline}). The ECR Initiative planned to create a
single export licensing agency, merge commodity control lists into a
single list, adopt a common IT system, and move most export enforcement
efforts under the purview of a single agency. These so-called "four
singles" were never achieved due to a shortage of time and a lack of
Congressional support for carrying out a bureaucratic restructuring of
this scale. [Several important and impactful reforms did
occur,]{.underline} however, [bringing the reforms part of the way to
completion.]{.underline} The ECR Initiative at its core attempted to
address the question of what the appropriate balance is between
increasing U.S. exports and trade and maintaining strict control of
sensitive goods in order to enhance national security objectives.
Overall, we assess that [the reforms tilted the balance more toward
increasing exports and trade at the expense of controls and national
security]{.underline}. As a result of the reforms, [thousands of items
usable in military systems and equipment are now more readily available
to long time U.S. allies, as well as to some countries of governance or
transshipment concern]{.underline}. Little effort was devoted to better
securing the most proliferation-sensitive goods. In response to the
inherent question asked by the reforms: should the United States loosen
controls on items that are being made available from other countries --
the answer reached appears to have been tilted to the affirmative. As a
result, [it is far from clear whether U.S. adversaries such as Iran and
North Korea are now increasingly able to obtain sensitive parts and
components to outfit their military and other sensitive programs.
The]{.underline} export control [reforms were announced by the Obama
administration]{.underline} to Congress and the business community **[as
an effort to fix overregulation]{.underline}** of the most innocuous
items [and allow allies to obtain needed items more easily,]{.underline}
while more tightly regulating the most sensitive goods. These goals are
not problematic if the items truly are innocuous and the changes
addressed legitimate concerns of the government, allies, and exporters.
However, [the effort may have simply contributed to increasing the
world's supply of sensitive goods usable in military programs -- and
thereby increasing availability of such goods to
adversaries]{.underline}. [This result is likely to be at odds with
overarching U.S. national security goals in the long term]{.underline}.
Serious review is needed to answer important questions, such as: what
damage, if any, has been done to national security objectives by the
freer availability of goods usable in military equipment? Where are
these goods today? Are they remaining with legitimate end users or are
they being sent onward to proliferant states such as Iran, Syria,
Pakistan, or North Korea? Are the goods being misused in countries
favored by U.S. export control reforms? Is there a need to re-visit
controls on some of the goods? What about the integrity of the process
for determining the control status of goods in the reformed "catch and
release" system? The Obama administration did not have to answer these
questions through any substantive reporting or testimony during a
review. It is now time for Congress to become involved to ensure that
this review and reporting is performed by the executive branch. The
risks of not performing such a review may be that only a major scandal
associated with the spread of deregulated goods would necessitate a
review ipso post facto, which is not a preferable way to conduct policy.

military sales (FMS) program. One highlight is a reorganization by
region, with a strategic team to look at the priorities of the regional
combatant commanders, the Defense Department and foreign partners.
Combatant commanders can place foreign sales requests on a priority list

[Despite a trend toward direct commercial sales over FMS, the
relationship with the US that comes with FMS remains main selling point,

national security]{.underline}, Rixey said. \"Th[e sales have a
strategic value, but we can\'t lose sight of the fact that we are a tool
of foreign policy, and there has to be a discussion about being

[Normally, the USG makes defense articles available to foreign
governments by FMS]{.underline} under the AECA. However, [there are
instances where a lease, rather than sale, to eligible foreign countries
or international organizations is appropriate. Leases are authorized
under the AECA Section 61 when]{.underline} [it is determined that there
are compelling foreign policy and national security reasons for
leasing]{.underline} rather than selling, [and the articles are not
needed for USG use]{.underline} during the proposed lease period. For
example, [a foreign government may desire to obtain a defense article
for a short period under a lease]{.underline} LOA Standard Terms and
Conditions 8-20 [for testing purposes to assist it in determining
whether to procure the article in quantity. As another example, the USG
may only be able to respond to an urgent foreign requirement for defense
property by making it available from inventory, but for national defense
reasons cannot sell the property and must require its return to the
inventory after a specified term.]{.underline} Attachment 8-1 provides a
sample lease. [Section C11.6 of the SAMM provides lease
policy.]{.underline} Approval DoD components must obtain DSCA
concurrence before indicating to a foreign country or international
organization that a lease is being favorably considered or is an
available option. The DoD component will provide a determination and
forward a memorandum written in the format specified in the SAMM,

rationale must be provided for any proposed lease outlining the reasons
why the defense articles are being leased rather than sold. Security
Cooperation Organization Responsibility The Security Cooperation
Organization (SCO) or Defense Attaché Office (DAO) where no SCO is

provisions may be added with the concurrence of the appropriate legal

will be signed by the appropriate IA and provided to DSCA for
countersignature. A separate LOA will be used for packing, crating,
handling, and transportation (PCH&T), and the sale of associated
articles and services, including any refurbishment of the defense
article(s) required prior to, during, or after the lease period. The LOA
will also be used to recover applicable costs if the article is lost,
damaged, or destroyed during the lease period.

#### BPC programs are legally and financially distinct from the FMS process

Contracting for BPC Programs

Building Partner Capacity ([BPC) programs that are implemented via
pseudo-LOAs will utilize the FMS infrastructure for execution. However;
due to the different authorities and appropriated funding sources for
BPC programs, acquisitions for BPC will not follow the FMS acquisition
processes and procedures outlined in SAMM C6.3 and the DFARS Subpart
225.7300. Instead, acquisition for BPC programs will follow the
processes and procedures outlined in SAMM C15]{.underline} as well as
the FAR and DFARS provisions associated with contracts funded by USG
appropriated funds.

A key consideration in conducting BPC acquisitions is to recognize the
time limited nature of BPC funds for both obligation and disbursement
purposes. SAMM Table C15.T2 lists the various BPC programs with the
associated appropriation authority, fund expiration date and funds
cancellation dates. These dates are essential in procurement planning
and execution for BPC. Due to the fiscal time limitations, SAMM C15.2.5
outlines the role of a feasibility assessment in planning for a BPC
acquisition.

[Another major difference for a BPC acquisition is that the benefiting
country is not provided an opportunity to request procurement from a
specific vendor. The FMS sole source process]{.underline} based on the
FAR subpart 6.302-4 international agreement exception [is ineligible to
be utilized with BPC programs]{.underline}. The other than full and open
competition process can be used for BPC programs but the justification
for use must be based on other exception criteria outlined in the FAR
subpart 6.3. SAMM Figure C15. F2 discusses the sole source process that
is applicable to BPC programs.

[In regard to contract pricing, BPC requirements default to all the
normal DoD pricing rules. The FMS contract pricing provisions outlined
in DFARS subpart 225.7303 are not applicable to BPC acquisitions.
Additionally, offsets as discussed for FMS are not applicable in BPC
acquisitions.]{.underline}

#### BPC is distinct from FMS

**DISCS** (Defense Institute of Security Cooperation Studies) January

<https://www.discs.dsca.mil/_pages/resources/default.aspx?section=publications&type=greenbook>

[The fundamental principle regarding contracting for FMS requirements is
that]{.underline} the USG essentially treats the FMS customer's
requirements as if they were USG requirements. In contracting for FMS,
[the same contracting regulations, policies and procedures are
applied]{.underline}. Per the SAMM, this is one of the principal reasons
customers select the FMS system rather than contracting themselves using
direct commercial processes.

[The unique aspects of the procurement process that pertain to FMS are
few in number, but they]{.underline}

[have a major impact on the FMS process.]{.underline} Competitive source
selection is the norm; however, the FMS customer has the option to use
other than full and open competition if they desire the USG to contract
with a specific firm. Under other than full and open competition
procedures, the FMS customers need not provide a rationale for the
request.

[The USG also has established a comprehensive contract administration
infrastructure that will be used to oversee the execution of contracts
awarded in support of FMS requirements]{.underline}. Again, the USG uses
the same contract administration, quality assurance and contract audit
processes for FMS that it uses for DoD procurements.

Offsets are an international market reality. Offsets are permitted in
association with FMS when the LOA funding the procurement contract is
financed by customer cash or repayable credit. If the LOA is funded by
USG grant funds, offset costs claimed by the contractor will be
considered unallowable.

Building Partner Capacity [(BPC) programs that are implemented via
pseudo-LOAs will utilize the FMS infrastructure for execution. However;
due to the different authorities and appropriated funding sources for
BPC programs, acquisitions for BPC will not follow the FMS acquisition
processes and procedures outlined in SAMM C6.3]{.underline} and the

Contracts

The term contract is commonly understood to refer to a binding agreement
between two or more parties that is enforceable by law. Contracts to
acquire supplies or services for the USG are developed and executed
under the uniform policies and procedures delineated in the Federal
Acquisition Regulation (FAR). The USG contracting process under the FAR
is briefly outlined in Chapter 9 of this textbook. The LOA is not a
procurement type contract developed and executed under the FAR. Instead,
[an FMS LOA is a unique agreement that is developed under the authority
of the Arms Export Control Act (AECA) and in accordance with the
policies and procedures specified in the Security Assistance Management
Manual (SAMM).]{.underline} The LOA documents the bilateral
government-to-government agreement between the USG and the partner
nation. In the LOA, the USG commits itself to provide certain defense
items or services and the purchaser commits to abide by specific terms
and conditions associated with the sale and to make specified financial
payments. Although the LOA is its own unique type of agreement, a brief
examination of the LOA viewed through the contract paradigm is a helpful
tool to better understand the LOA.

### circumvention -- waivers

#### Multiple methods Trump could circumvent & give countries arms for free -- We'll insert a list of waivers for FMS coded into the law

(2)(A) The President may reduce or waive the charge or charges which
would otherwise be considered appropriate under paragraph (1)(B) for
particular sales that would, if made, significantly advance United
States Government interests in North Atlantic Treaty Organization
standardization, standardization with the Armed Forces of Japan,
Australia, the Republic of Korea, Israel, or New Zealand in furtherance
of the mutual defense treaties between the United States and those
countries, or foreign procurement in the United States under
coproduction arrangements.

\(B\) The President may waive the charge or charges which would
otherwise be considered appropriate under paragraph (1)(B) for a
particular sale if the President determines that-

\(i\) imposition of the charge or charges likely would result in the
loss of the sale; or

\(ii\) in the case of a sale of major defense equipment that is also
being procured for the use of the Armed Forces, the waiver of the charge
or charges would (through a resulting increase in the total quantity of
the equipment purchased from the source of the equipment that causes a
reduction in the unit cost of the equipment) result in a savings to the
United States on the cost of the equipment procured for the use of the
Armed Forces that substantially offsets the revenue foregone by reason
of the waiver of the charge or charges.

\(C\) The President may waive, for particular sales of major defense
equipment, any increase in a charge or charges previously considered
appropriate under paragraph (1)(B) if the increase results from a
correction of an estimate (reasonable when made) of the production
quantity base that was used for calculating the charge or charges for
purposes of such paragraph.

(3)(A) The President may waive the charges for administrative services
that would otherwise be required by paragraph (1)(A) in connection with
any sale to the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) Support and
Procurement Organization and its executive agencies in support of-

\(i\) a support or procurement partnership agreement; or

\(ii\) a NATO/SHAPE project.

### a2 circumvention - fms-only

#### All key arms sales are designated as FMS-Only -- multi-agency review process ensures no circumvention

**SAMM** (Security Assistance Management Manual) **2019** "Chapter 4:
Foreign Military Sales Program General Information"
<https://www.samm.dsca.mil/chapter/chapter-4>

C4.3.5[. FMS-Only Determinations. The AECA gives the President
discretion to designate which military end-items must be sold
exclusively through FMS channels. This discretion is delegated under
statutory authority to the Secretary of State]{.underline}. [Generally,
as a matter of policy, this discretion is exercised upon the
recommendation of DoD.]{.underline}

C4.3.5.1. DoS approves or disapproves all arms sales and is responsible
for the continuous supervision and general direction of all sales. [Each
MILDEP or DoD Component develops recommendations for FMS-Only
designations on specific weapons systems and military
technologies]{.underline} considering the criteria in Section C4.3.5.3.
and Section C4.3.5.4. The MILDEP or DoD Component forwards related
recommendations and rationales for adding or removing such FMS-Only
systems designations to DSCA (Directorate for Security Assistance (DSA))
and DTSA. DSCA will provide such recommendations to DoS for its review
and approval/disapproval. [Through the export licensing process
for]{.underline} Direct Commercial Sales ([DCS)]{.underline}, overseen
by the Directorate of Defense Trade Controls at DoS, [DTSA will review
licensing requests to ensure license requests are consistent with
FMS-only designations. Requests for further assistance with FMS-Only
designations should be directed to DSCA]{.underline} (Directorate for
Security Assistance) [for reconciliation or referral to the appropriate
DoD element for resolution.]{.underline}

C4.3.5.2[. FMS Only List. The key purpose of this list and related USG
processes is the codification and more consistent application of the USG
requirement that certain military items be sold only on a
government-to-government basis. The following is a listing of military
capabilities and systems by general category that the USG broadly
considers to be available for export solely on an FMS-Only
basis]{.underline}. Inclusion of items on the below list should not be
construed as a change to policy as it exists as of September 2016.

[Select Radars: such as but not limited to AESA, Ballistic Missile
Defense, and High-Frequency Phased Array Microwave]{.underline}

[Air-to-Air Missiles]{.underline}

[Attack Helicopters]{.underline}

[Autonomous Weapons Systems]{.underline}

[Ballistic Missile Defense Items: Effectors; Firing Units;

C4.3.5.3. [DoS uses four general criteria to determine whether a sale
should be required to proceed through the FMS process:
Legislative/Presidential restrictions; DoD/MILDEP policy, directive, or
regulatory requirement, e.g., the National Disclosure Policy;
government-to-government agreement requirements; and
interoperability/safety requirements for U.S. Forces.]{.underline}

C4.3.5.4. These DoS criteria, also outlined under DoD/MILDEP policy, can
be further understood by considering four possible elements:

C4.3.5.4.1. U.S. Political-Military Relationship with the End-User. [The
geopolitical situation and security relationships are taken into account
when considering the appropriateness of recommending FMS-Only. The
inherent strengths of FMS or DCS licensing methods are also considered
in selecting the method that best suits the interests of the United
States and the foreign purchaser within the context of existing global
security circumstances.]{.underline}

C4.3.5.4.2. Sale of a New or Complex System or Service. [DoD may
recommend FMS-Only]{.underline}:

C4.3.5.4.2.1. [To maximize the purchaser\'s ability to assimilate the
technologies and manage its acquisition/logistics.]{.underline}

C4.3.5.4.2.2. [For enhanced interoperability and cooperation between
U.S. and purchaser\'s military forces.]{.underline}

C4.3.5.4.2.3. [For end-items or services that require complex systems
integration with other combat systems]{.underline}.

C4.3.5.4.2.4. [For end-items or services that require access to
sensitive U.S. government databases, libraries, or software-source
code.]{.underline}

C4.3.5.4.2.5. [For end-items or services that require EEUM or on-site
accountability]{.underline}

C4.3.5.4.3. Diversion and Exploitation of Defense Systems Technologies.
[Security of sensitive technologies requires greater scrutiny in the
transfer process. Defense systems and munitions that are not
particularly complex or sensitive but still require enhanced control to
prevent proliferation to rogue states or terrorist organizations
represent another area where FMS may be more appropriate than
DCS.]{.underline}

C4.3.5.4.4. Feasibility of Separating Weapon System Components into
FMS/DCS Elements. At times, purchasers may desire all or a portion of a
sale to be DCS. In instances where possible, FMS-Only aspects of a
purchase may potentially be separated from the portion that can be sold
DCS.

[FMF Leasing: A New Alternative For Foreign Military Sales]{.underline}
\--By Steven S. Diamond and Nathaniel E. Castellano, Arnold & Porter LLP
Law360, New York (April 14, 2016, 12:55 PM ET) \--Government contractors
interested in pursuing international sales should also consider the
potential availability of foreign military funding (FMF) to their
foreign government customers for the lease of defense equipment.
Although typically prohibited,\[1\] in some circumstances, the Defense
Security Cooperation Agency (DSCA) has approved the use of FMF funding
for equipment leases. As explained below, [using FMF funds to facilitate
leases of defense equipment can be advantageous to American defense
contractors, foreign government customers and the U.S.
government.]{.underline} [Contractors may be in a position to
self-finance these leases, or they may require third-party
financing.]{.underline} For the latter, executing these deals will
require combining the worlds of FMF transactions and commercial
equipment lease financing, which at first blush present mutually
conflicting requirements. The Case For FMF Leasing With the decline in
U.S. defense spending, American contractors are looking abroad to sell
their goods and services to foreign customers. At the same time,
increasingly unstable geopolitical conditions and rapid growth in
emerging economies make some foreign governments eager customers for
U.S.-produced defense equipment. Under certain circumstances, the U.S.
government facilitates and funds the sale of military supplies and
services to friendly countries. Often, the U.S. government will assist
in funding these transactions to f f urther foreign policy and military
objectives. [The sale of defense equipment to foreign customers
generally occurs within the legal framework of either a]{.underline} (1)
[foreign mlitary sale (FMS) or (2) direct commercial contract
(DCC)]{.underline} with a foreign government, assisted with FMF funds.
FMS, which is the more common of the two approaches, involves a foreign
government purchasing directly from a U.S. defense agency, with the
defense agency contracting through a standard federal government supply
contract with a U.S. contractor. The U.S. Department of Defense handles
all aspects of the procurement --- including contract formation and
administration, selection of terms and conditions, quality assurance,
payment, and dispute resolution. This relieves the foreign government of
a considerable administrative burden, and allows it to capitalize on the
DOD's acquisition experience. Conversely, the foreign customer loses
some control over the acquisition process and may pay a premium for the
DOD's services. Under the DCC framework, the foreign customer contracts
directly with a U.S. contractor. The U.S. government may provide
assistance in the form of FMF. In contrast to the FMS framework, in a
DCC, there is privity between the contractor and the foreign government.
Although various requirements are imposed by the U.S. government, the
foreign government and the contractor act relatively independently
during the acquisition process. The prerequisites for entering a DCC and
obtaining FMF funding are set forth in DCSA guidance,\[2\] which
requires, among other things, that the contractor execute a contractor
certification and agreement with DSCA and, potentially, submit to a
pre-award survey, pricing review and U.S. government audit rights.\[3\]
[FMS and FMF transactions are typically contracts for sale, but they can
also be structured as leasing arrangements]{.underline}. [Foreign
governments might prefer leases because leasing may involve lower cost
and less risk of owning equipment that could become
obsolete.]{.underline} As in any equipment lease, the lessee pays for
the value it uses. From the U.S. government perspective, the U.S.
Department of State and the DOD are incentivized to approve FMF for
leases, because such arrangements allow leverage of increasingly scarce
appropriations and facilitate relations with allies. [Leases appeal to
contractors, because they generate increased revenue and may ultimately
result in the foreign customer purchasing the equipment]{.underline}
(e.g., through a lease-to-own provision). Even without a sale, the
contractor may be able to re-lease or resell the equipment. [The FMS
legal framework expressly allows for leases under certain circumstances,
but leases generally have been prohibited from receiving FMF
funding.]{.underline}\[4\] Foreign customers may nevertheless prefer
direct lease contracts supported by FMF, so that they have more control
over the transaction and can obtain equipment that they otherwise may
not have funding to procure. The DSCA, in limited circumstances thus
far, has shown a willingness to consider FMF for lease transactions.
[Unlike FMS leasing, which is more common, there are no guidelines for
FMF leases,]{.underline} and striking the balance between a compliant
FMF transaction and a commercial equipment lease can be difficult. The
following section addresses issues that must be considered when
contemplating an FMF lease.

Lease Identification Using DSAMS, the IA assigns a unique designator to
each lease. The lease designator is composed of the country code, the IA
code, and a three-position code assigned by the IA. The lease designator
is included on each lease page, including schedules, appendices, and
accompanying documents. [FMS cases associated with leases must reference
the lease designator]{.underline} Duration Leases may be written for a
maximum of five years with an additional specified period of time
required to complete major refurbishment work prior to delivery. Leases
may include multiple items with different lease duration periods. The
shortest lease period is one month and the longest lease period is sixty
months. [Leases of one year or more require congressional notification
in accordance with the AECA]{.underline} Section 62(a)(22 U.S.C.
2796(a). Leases shall provide that, at any time during the lease period,
the USG may terminate the lease and require the immediate return of the
defense article. Leases of less than five years may be extended via an
amendment but the total period under a specific lease may not exceed
five years plus the time needed for refurbishment. Amendments Lease
amendments may be used to extend or change existing leases. Such changes
include variations to payment schedules, Schedule A items, or periods of
performance. Each amendment includes the original lease designator and
undergoes the same staffing process as the original lease. If a lease
for LOA Standard Terms and Conditions 8-21 less than one year is amended
so that the total period of the original lease and the amendment equals
or exceeds one year, the amendment must be notified to the Congress
before it can be offered. Loss, Destruction, or Damage [The lessee must
agree to pay the costs of restoration or replacement if the articles are
lost, damaged, or destroyed while leased]{.underline}. In this case, the
customer is charged the replacement cost (less any depreciation) if the
U.S. intends to replace the articles or the actual article value (less
any depreciation) if the U.S. does not intend to replace the articles.
[These charges are recouped under an FMS transaction via an
LOA.]{.underline} Lease Payment The lessee must agree to pay in U.S.
dollars all costs incurred by the USG in leasing articles, including
reimbursement for depreciation (rent) of articles while leased. The
rental payment is calculated in accordance with DoD 7000.14-R, Volume
15, Chapter 7. Rental payments do not include an administrative charge.
Schedule A of each lease identifies the replacement costs of the items
being leased and the schedule for rental payment due to the USG.
Billings to the foreign lessee are based on this schedule of payments
and are included on a separate DD Form 645A with the country's quarterly
FMS billing statement. Defense Finance and Accounting Service (DFAS)
deposits receipts from lease rental payments in the Miscellaneous
Receipts Account 3041 (FMS Recoveries, DoD Lease Costs) in accordance
with the Treasury Financial Manual, Supplement to Volume 1. The use of
Foreign Military Financing Program (FMFP) funds is not authorized for
payments of lease rental charges except for leases of aircraft for
counternarcotics purposes pursuant to FAA Section 484 (22 U.S.C. 2291c).
FMFP funds may be authorized by DSCA for FMS cases prepared in support
of a lease.

[Excess property procedures afford still another method for]{.underline}
limited materiel [support. Property that is excess to U.S. MILDEP
requirements and cannot be used by other DoD components may be provided
to eligible foreign governments through the FMS program as Excess
Defense Articles (EDA). Providing excess materiel is accomplished either
through the military departments or the DLA Disposition Services. EDA
include lethal and non-lethal defense equipment owned by the MILDEPs,
excluding construction equipment, which may be provided to selected
countries on a grant or as an FMS sale. All sales of excess significant
military equipment (SME) or materiel valued at \$7M or higher in
original acquisition value require a thirty-day advance congressional
notification prior to transfer]{.underline}. The DLA Disposition
Services program, on the other hand, is the sale of non-lethal, non-SME
excess government property, which may include major end items, support
equipment and consumables that are no longer needed by the MILDEPs, and
are transferred by DLA as a grant to eligible countries, or sold to
non-grant eligible countries at a reduced cost based on the condition of
the items.

transferred]{.underline} from the Military Departments to the Defense
Logistics Agency, Disposition Services, [is also available for transfer
through the EDA program if an eligible foreign government makes known
its requirements for the equipment.]{.underline} The Department of
Defense is authorized by law to transfer Excess Defense Articles to
foreign governments under the following authorities: Section 516 of the
Foreign Assistance Act of 1961, as amended, authorizes grant transfers
of lethal and non-lethal EDA to countries which receipt of such articles
were justified to Congress for the fiscal year in which the transfer is
authorized. EDA may also be sold to foreign countries under the normal
FMS system authorized by the Arms Export Control Act (AECA). When EDA is
sold, the price is a percentage of the original acquisition value, based
on age and condition, and ranges from 5% to 50% of the original
acquisition. All grant recipients must sign agreements pursuant to
Section 505 of the FAA agreeing to end-use restrictions and giving the
U.S. first right to proceeds of any sale.

Across the world, the Pentagon has thousands of garages, hangars and
sprawling lots to store all its jets, tanks and other weaponry. But,
like most American households, it is cluttered with old, unused and
unwanted things. And so the Pentagon runs a little-publicized giveaway
and tag sale program to clean out its overstuffed attics and closets,
bulging with the greatest weapons buildup since the Reagan era[. The
Pentagon also uses the Excess Defense Articles program]{.underline}, as
it is called, [to reward government friends and allies across the
globe.]{.underline} There are deals galore, available free to the right
customer or for cents on the dollar of their original cost. There are
lots of deal hunters, but access is by invitation only, and only for
governments. [Pakistan and Jordan have snapped up a bunch of used F-16
Fighting Falcon jets. Afghanistan]{.underline} kicked the tires on a
fleet of slightly [used armored personnel carriers]{.underline} and
walked away with 75 of them. A small fleet of 30-year-old sea [rescue
lifeboats has become the backbone of the Yemeni coast
guard]{.underline}, and Portugal is about to take possession of a
decommissioned guided-missile frigate. "It is a flea market," said a
State Department official who oversees the program. "It's our yard sale,
and we make no guarantees." The program is meant as a good will
operation that the government uses to build friendships internationally.
And the program has been picking up: the equipment offered in 2006 had
an original price tag of around \$1.56 billion, twice that of the
previous year. It is expected to grow again in 2007. "There's everything
from M-16s to F-16s, and anything in between," said Rachel J. Stohl, a
senior analyst at the Center for Defense Information, a nonprofit group
often critical of military spending. "You can't get everything you want.
But, boy, can you get a bargain." Between 2000 and 2005, the Pentagon
offered up wares originally valued at \$8 billion: helicopters,
torpedoes, airplanes, a wind tunnel, utility landing craft, cargo
trucks, high-power radars, missiles, ammunition, uniforms and tenders,
harbor craft and other vessels. Around \$2 billion of this
[merchandise]{.underline} was given away to countries deemed needy
enough to qualify. Another \$800 million [was sold at drastically
reduced prices --- even as low as 5 cents on the dollar.]{.underline}
The rest had no takers. Most of the recipient countries cannot afford
brand-new equipment on their own; the Philippines, Morocco and the
Dominican Republican have been recent shoppers. But first-world
countries like Australia and Canada have picked up some cheap castoffs,
as well. There is no central site where all the weaponry is gathered for
inspection by would-be buyers. Instead the merchandise is offered on an
"as is, where is" basis, with the buyer having to pay for shipping and
repairs --- which can sometimes make the bargain less appealing and
accounts for why not all the merchandise moves. Few shoppers, however,
complain --- and they often observe the hand-off of weapons in
ceremonies in their home countries, with American officials in
attendance. "We're grateful," said Sgt. Maj. Irving Estrada, assistant
to the military attaché of Guatemala. His country has received used body
armor, flight suits, boots and computers which were presented by the
American ambassador at a ceremony in Guatemala City last April. "This is
very important to us," said Sergeant Major Estrada. "Everything is
useful and we use everything that we get." The program is not without
its critics, who say it contributes to a global arms race and may be a
short-sighted way of winning friends. "Aren't there more constructive
ways for the United States to make friends?" asked Danielle Brian,
executive director of the Project on Government Oversight, a watchdog
group that studies Pentagon spending. "[We are arming countries that
otherwise would not afford to be armed]{.underline}. If we want to make
friends, we should have something better to offer." Critics also say the
tag sale are giveaway metaphors are not apt, and prefer to describe it
in terms of a business giving out free samples. The program, they say,
gives nations a taste of weapons that they might like to purchase later,
often with foreign aid from the United States. "It's like, 'Here, have
this and next time you'll come back,' " said Ms. Stohl of the Center for
Defense Information. "[Excess defense articles are a springboard to
other sales."]{.underline} State Department officials say the program
provides a steady source of rewards to help build critical international
relationships. Last year, Pakistan obtained two used F-16s as a sign of
appreciation for its help to the United States when it invaded
Afghanistan after 9/11, according to statements from State Department
officials at the time. These were 1980s vintage planes with a current
value of \$6.5 million, but were given to Pakistan free. These two used
F-16s have already been delivered to Pakistan, and were offered just as
the country placed a controversial \$5 billion order for advanced F-16s,
a fighter jet that Pakistan had been banned from obtaining since the
early 1990s because of American objections to its nuclear program. That
ban is no longer in effect. President Bush has also provided old
equipment to help secure support for foreign policy goals. For instance,
in 2003, in the countdown to the war against Iraq, a squadron of used
National Guard F-16s was transferred, free of charge, to Jordan, which
shares a border with Iraq. The arrival of the first six F-16s was
heralded at a ceremony at the Sahid Muwafak al-Salti air force base in
northern Jordan that was attended by Maj. Gen. Prince Faisal bin
Hussein, brother of the Jordanian king, as well as by the United States
ambassador to Jordan and high-ranking Pentagon officers. "It's hugely
important," said Lt. Gen. Jeffrey B. Kohler, director of the Defense
Security Cooperation Agency, which manages the transfers. "It is one of
the ways that we can help some of our friends obtain the capabilities
they need." General Kohler noted that used personnel carriers had gone
to the Lebanese army and that excess Coast Guard cutters patrolled the
Caspian Sea. "It gives us access and influence and builds friendships,"
he added. In a policy statement, the State Department said that the
program "has contributed to our foreign policy successes" and has had a
"positive global impact, furthering U.S. national security interests and
supporting the growth and strengthening of democracies." The program
traces its roots back to the 1970s, and the amount of goods flowing
through it comes in waves. One high point was in the early 1990s, as
bases around the country were closing and the military was downsizing.
In the 12 months through September, used weapons valued at \$235 million
were put into the program, with some \$220 million of those being
offered free. Since the current depreciated values generally represent
around 15 percent of the purchase price, that puts the original value at
\$1.56 billion. Soon the program is supposed to get a vast infusion of
ships, helicopters and planes from the Coast Guard, which is getting a
new fleet. Critics say that the government may not be able to control
how these weapons are finally used. While the State Department says it
will not ship arms to countries with human rights violations and
prohibits countries receiving weapons from selling them to others,
critics argue such restrictions can provide false comfort. "The United
States believes that if we sell weapons at low prices to other
countries, we can control their foreign policy or military actions," Ms.
Stohl said. "But in reality, once you sell or give it away, you lose
control of what was done with it." As an example, Ms. Stohl said the
Pentagon was selling excess M-16s to the Dominican Republic, which
shares a notoriously porous border with Haiti, at a time when
international peacekeepers were facing off against Haitian rebels.
Government officials counter that there are controls in place to monitor
the use of the equipment and prevent it from falling into the wrong
hands. One of the largest recipients of excess defense articles has been
the Philippines. When President Bush met with President Gloria Arroyo of
the Philippines in Washington in 2003, he promised 20 used UH-1 Huey
helicopters to help the country wipe out a three-decade-old communist
insurgency, the New People's Army. "These helicopters are a
demonstration of an attachment," said Maj. Gen. Roberto Sylim, the
Philippines' military attaché in Washington. "We are assisting an ally
and getting equipment free or at cost. We hope to maintain this kind of
strong relationship in the global war on terrorism." Since 9/11, the
Philippines has received 14,600 used rifles with an original price tag
of \$13.3 million, two dozen cargo trucks that initially cost \$41,000
each, a C-130B cargo airplane and Coast Guard patrol boat. Ms. Brian, of
the Project on Government Oversight, suspects [the Pentagon may be
pushing perfectly usable military goods out the door to make way for new
ones.]{.underline} "The Pentagon is always trying to mothball weapons,"
said Ms. Brian. ["It's a perennial excuse to buy new ones."]{.underline}

#### FMF falls under the FMS framework

**Maloberti 12** (Matias, career in the Argentine Navy, serving for more
than 10 years in as a communications officer. This background gives
Matias an insiders' understanding of the military in a developing
country, which faces different resource constraints and capacities than
the U.S. armed forces. After leaving the navy, Matias earned his MBA and
entered the world of international military sales. Working for the U.S.
Military Group in Quito, Ecuador, he coordinated the logistics for all
U.S. Foreign Military Sales (FMS) to Ecuador. There he helped U.S.
defense companies to identify market opportunities and navigate the
logistics of a direct commercial sale or an FMS transaction. During this
time, Matias completed all available training from the U.S. DOD on
Foreign Military Sales and Financing, LMDefense, "Military Export
Basics: What is FMF," 10/31/12) Heublein

How does FMF work? [Most FMF-funded purchases are made through
the]{.underline} Foreign Military Sales ([FMS]{.underline})
[framework]{.underline}. A few [countries]{.underline} [have received
exceptions to use FMF funds]{.underline} [for]{.underline} [Direct
Commercial Sales]{.underline}. Foreign Military Financing funds are
budgeted three years in advance, as part of the regular State Department
budget cycle. For FY2011, the total funding for the FMF program was
\$5.37 billion. The FY2012 estimate was \$6.31 billion. (Source -- pdf
file; see p. 171) How does an FMF-financed sale work? For the most part,
**[an FMF-financed sale works just like other sales under the Foreign
Military Sales process]{.underline}**. The main difference is that
funding comes from the FMF program rather than the foreign government
customer. (A sale may be fully funded through FMF, or may be partially
FMF-funded and partially paid by the foreign customer.) This has the
benefit of helping allied countries buy military equipment they
otherwise might not be able to afford, creating additional sales
opportunities for U.S. defense companies. For U.S. defense companies,
ensuring that Foreign Military Financing funds are available and
budgeted to a particular sale will probably require additional
coordination during the pre-LOR stage of the FMS process. We'll discuss
the pre-LOR process in more detail in a separate post. FMF vs. FMS
Clients often ask me about the difference between Foreign Military
Financing and Foreign Military Sales. In reality, FMF and FMS aren't
directly comparable. FMF provides funding for defense purchases, while
FMS is the program for managing the sale and transfer of military items.
**[Sales funded by FMF are almost always processed through the FMS
program.]{.underline}** (Only a few countries have exceptions to use FMF
funds for Direct Commercial Sales.) The FMS program, on the other hand,
may be used for FMF-financed sales, or for sales paid for by the foreign
customer.
