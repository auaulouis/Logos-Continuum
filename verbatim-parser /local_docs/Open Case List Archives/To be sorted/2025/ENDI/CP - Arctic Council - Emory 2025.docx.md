2\. [[**Rejoin** the **Arctic Council**]{.mark}, [or ensure]{.mark}
**continued [support]{.mark}** [for its most **pressing**]{.mark}
**[initiatives]{.mark}**]{.underline}. [The Arctic Council has proven to
be the foremost player in international climate policy in the region,
and it was **specifically designed** to function in spite of the
**security** **differences** of its member states]{.underline}. The
United States and its allies have far more to lose by boycotting the
organization than they stand to gain.
**[[Washington]{.underline}]{.mark}** [[should resume]{.mark}
participation]{.underline} [in the **Arctic Council** [as **soon** as
**possible**]{.mark}]{.underline}; if this is infeasible during Russia's
chairmanship of the council, the United States should continue its
support for the organization's six expert working groups, or seek to
duplicate their activities with regional partners or through other
forums. Norway will take over as chair of the council in 2023.

[The Arctic Council was]{.underline} responsible for several activities
of key import to US Arctic interests. First, the organization was [a
[**principal organizer** of **scientific collaboration**]{.mark} that
included]{.underline} **[Russia]{.underline}**, [most of which has
**ground to a halt.**]{.underline} [Second, the Arctic Council created a
working group to study radiological sites in the Arctic, create
procedures to recover hazardous materials, and **craft [contingency
plans]{.mark}** [in case of **nuclear**
**contamination**]{.mark}]{.underline}. The council was set to convene
this summer to discuss nuclear waste disposal, but the meeting has been
canceled. [Third,]{.underline} [the **organization** was largely
**responsible** for **[monitoring environmental]{.mark}**]{.underline}
[[**conditions**]{.mark} [and **pollution**]{.mark} in the
Arctic]{.underline}, and experts fear that without adequate oversight,
Russia will be free to conduct harmful activities such as gas-flaring.

Analysts have proposed that the Arctic Council member states other than
Russia duplicate the most important organizational projects among
themselves, without Russian involvement. In fact, the United States has
successfully engaged allies to pursue environmental goals outside of the
forum in the past. Moreover, other organizations, such as the
International Arctic Science Committee, have continued their operations
without Russia since the invasion of Ukraine and could provide an
alternative for regional engagement.

However, although this approach would yield more progress than
suspending Arctic cooperation entirely, Russian involvement in Arctic
climate collaboration is critical. The nation owns more than half of the
Arctic coastline, contains the vast majority of the area's radiological
contamination, and samples and data from Russia are indispensable for
climate change research. Therefore, the United States should seek to
resume its participation in the Arctic Council in 2023 at the latest;
Washington should also address the environmental concerns that are
normally managed by the council's working groups with other Arctic
states until that point. US policymakers could also work through the
Northern Forum, a Russia-based international organization that
coordinates efforts among subnational Arctic governments; however, there
is no full substitute for national-level collaboration on larger
environmental priorities.

[In the **future**, [the U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates [cannot
**allow** its **relationship** with the **Arctic**]{.mark}
**[Council]{.mark}** [to become a **victim** of **security
competition**]{.mark}]{.underline}. [One of the principal strengths of
the Arctic Council is its **explicit commitment** to avoid **security
issues**]{.underline}. Then Secretary of State Mike Pompeo upended this
norm by raising security concerns in the forum in 2019, and the United
States and its Western partners boycotted the organization in response
to another security situation, Russia's invasion of Ukraine. [[If the
**United** States continues to link its **security concerns** with its
**Arctic Council activities**, the **organization's ability**]{.mark} to
**safeguard** the Arctic **environment** [could be **critically
eroded.**]{.mark}]{.underline}

#### The net benefit is [Arctic Council Credibility]{.underline}. Arctic Council influence is [waning now]{.underline}, but [recommitting]{.underline} to it [builds]{.underline} a [bulwark]{.underline} that [prevents]{.underline} Arctic war from spiraling out of control.

4\. Diplomatic efforts and international governance

Due to the soft power strategy, [**[Arctic governance]{.mark}** has
[created **the Arctic Council as a**]{.mark} [**model** of
**inclusiveness**]{.mark} and **high-level intergovernmental
forum**]{.underline}, [where science diplomacy has played a pivotal role
in [**promoting** **cooperation**, **coordination**]{.mark},
[and]{.mark} **[interaction]{.mark}** among **circumpolar states** on
issues of **common concern**]{.underline}, including those relating to
sustainable development and environmental protection. The council brings
together the eight Arctic member states, organizations representing the
region's native peoples, and several observer states and organizations,
including China. \[24\] The Arctic Council was officially established in
1996 under the terms of the Ottawa Declaration, whose signatories were
Canada, Denmark (including Greenland and the Faroe Islands), the U.S.,
Finland, Iceland, Norway, Russia and Sweden. It cannot deal with
military and sovereignty issues (which are excluded from its field of
competence) to concentrate discussions on subjects that can more easily
be the subject of consensus such as scientific cooperation,
environmental protection, well-being and economic development of
indigenous populations, safety of navigation, etc. [Much of the Arctic
Council's work focuses on scientific and technical topics that are
studied in thematic working groups.]{.underline} \[25\]

Outside the Arctic Council, there are a multitude of official
organizations, governmental and non-governmental, whose purpose is to
manage various issues in the Arctic; The Arctic Circle is an
organization established by Iceland on 15 April 2013. Its mission is to
facilitate dialogue between political leaders, business leaders,
environmental experts, scientists, indigenous representatives and other
international stakeholders on issues related to the Arctic. The four
Arctic states located in Europe (Denmark, Finland, Norway and Sweden)
and Iceland, which has strong historical ties to Europe, are known as
the "Nordic countries". Much of the cooperation between these states
relates to issues they have in common with Western Russia, the Baltic
and Barents Sea regions and the greater Nordic region, including
international waters. In addition to those organizations, six other
organizations representing Indigenous peoples of the Arctic have
permanent participant status. \[26\]

There are also non-Arctic countries that have been granted observer
status, such as Germany, the UK, the Netherlands, Poland, France, Spain,
Italy, Japan, China, India, South Korea, Singapore, and Switzerland.
This is in addition to many other international organizations such as
the UN through some of its programs related to environment and
development. European and Asian countries have shown their interests and
responsibilities in a strategy document on the Arctic. The EU adopted an
integrated policy on the Arctic zone in 2016 and is currently
considering updating these guidelines. Asian states' ongoing research
agendas and scientific cooperation have made their engagement crucial
for the development of Arctic knowledge. Japan and South Korea launched
the construction of an icebreaker for scientific purposes, to be
deployed in 2026. \[27\]

There is no doubt that the war in Ukraine has made cooperation and
diplomacy in the Arctic more difficult. However, the U.S. can expect
Russia to remain open to peaceful discussions. Even at the height of the
Cold War, the Soviet Union cooperated with the West on Arctic issues,
including initiatives such as the 1973 Convention on the Conservation of
Polar Bears \[28\] and the 1987 Murmansk Initiative toward regional
cooperation, recognizing the special responsibilities and special
interests of the States of the Arctic Region in relation to the
protection of the fauna and flora of the Arctic Region and recognizing
that the polar bear is a significant resource of the Arctic Region that
requires additional protection.

[To manage the escalating tensions in the Arctic, states must strike a
balance between]{.underline} [cooperation and strategic rivalry through
**bilateral** and **international diplomacy**.]{.underline} Important
Arctic nations like the U.S. and Russia hold bilateral discussions to
lower the likelihood of armed conflict, frequently concentrating on
keeping lines of communication open about security-related issues.
[Despite the modest progress made in these discussions, they are
nonetheless [crucial for defusing]{.mark} any [confrontations]{.mark}
[considering the **Arctic's** **growing
militarization**]{.mark}]{.underline}. [Security matters are
noticeably]{.underline} [missing from **multilateral institutions** like
the **Arctic Council**]{.underline}, which offers all Arctic nations a
diplomatic forum to debate environmental, economic, and indigenous
issues.

[Despite the current]{.underline} high [tensions]{.underline} and given
the potential for mutual destruction, [[Russia and NATO]{.mark} [share
an interest]{.mark} [in]{.mark} [maintaining peace]{.mark} in the
**Arctic region** in]{.underline} [addition to **diplomatic frameworks**
that provide legal channels for settling competing]{.underline} [claims
to **seabed resources**]{.underline}, such as the United Nations
Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS). \[29\] NATO's attempts to
coordinate security plans among its Arctic member states, strengthening
regional stability, are another example of multilateral diplomacy in
action. Although these diplomatic efforts aid in the management of
tensions, they frequently fail to address the more serious security
threats brought on by military buildups and geopolitical rivalry in the
Arctic. \[30\]

Conclusion

With rivalry for resources, vital shipping lanes, and military supremacy
driving war, the Arctic is quickly changing into a disputed geopolitical
region. [[Global powers like **China**]{.mark}, [the **U.S.,** and
**Russia** are **vying** for]{.mark} **[control of the region]{.mark}**
because of the melting ice]{.underline}, [which has made it more
**accessible** for **economic exploitation**. [Territorial claims
overlap when states **bolster** their **military presence**]{.mark},
[raising the possibility of **error or conflict**]{.mark}]{.underline}.
[The Arctic [runs the risk]{.mark} of [**turning** into a **hot spot**
for **future hostilities**]{.mark} in the **absence** of **defined
methods** to handle these tensions.]{.underline}

[[There is an urgent need for more]{.mark} **international
[collaboration]{.mark}** [to stop this **escalation**.]{.mark} Although
the UNCLOS]{.underline} [and [the **Arctic Council**]{.mark} [have
**facilitated communication**]{.mark}]{.underline}, they are
ill-equipped to handle the region's growing security concerns.
[Redoubled efforts should]{.underline} concentrate on broadening
diplomatic channels to cover security and military matters, [setting up
a platform for Arctic countries to discuss weapons control and
**developing guidelines** for **military behavior**]{.underline}. [The
moment has come for Arctic]{.underline} [countries to engage in
**formalized diplomatic discussion** that covers military and security
matters]{.underline}. [Whether through]{.underline} a distinct treaty or
[[the Arctic Council]{.mark}, a new global]{.underline} security
framework [might [offer a forum for]{.mark} [**controlling** the
**military buildup**]{.mark}]{.underline}, negotiating arms control
measures, [and defining explicit rules of engagement to avoid
unintentional conflicts.]{.underline} In addition to lowering the
likelihood of violence, this would establish a crisis management system
in the Arctic. [[International organizations must also]{.mark}
**[mediate conflicts]{.mark}** and make sure that]{.underline}
[**competition** i]{.underline}n the Arctic [doesn't]{.underline}
[jeopardize]{.underline} [indigenous rights or the **sustainability** of
the **environment**.]{.underline} In [the face of mounting global
pressure, the **Arctic** can only continue to be a **region of
harmony**, **collaboration**, and **shared wealth** via **concerted
effort**.]{.underline}

Militarization -- the big elephant in the room

[The strong [militarization]{.mark} [in the Arctic is the elephant in
the room in the Arctic Council]{.mark}]{.underline} as well as in the
Norwegian and Nordic public. [[In order for]{.mark} the Arctic [Council
to]{.mark} be able to [meet]{.mark} the **existential** **[environmental
challenges]{.mark}**]{.underline}, [[politicians must **contribute** to
ensure that]{.mark} [the **geopolitical conflict lines** **give way** to
**practical cooperation**.]{.mark}]{.underline}

The geopolitical situation in the Arctic has worsened dramatically by
the Swedish and Finnish entry into NATO and the significant expansion of
the number of US bases in the Nordic countries. And not far from the
Norwegian border, Russia has its large military base on the Kola
Peninsula with nuclear submarines and nuclear weapons.

[[For]{.mark} nearly **three [decades]{.mark}**]{.underline}, [the
**Arctic Council** has been a successful example of]{.underline}
post-Cold War **[cooperation]{.underline}**.

[Its eight members]{.underline}, [including **[Russia]{.mark}** and the
**[U]{.mark}**]{.underline}nited **[[S]{.underline}]{.mark}**tates,
[[have cooperated on **climate**]{.mark}**-change** research
[and]{.mark} **social [development]{.mark}**]{.underline} across the
ecologically sensitive region.

Now, a year after council members stopped working with Russia following
its invasion of Ukraine and as Norway prepares to assume the
chairmanship from Moscow on May 11, [experts are asking whether
[the]{.mark} polar [body\'s **viability is at risk**]{.mark} if it
cannot cooperate]{.underline} with the country that controls over half
of the Arctic coastline.

[[An ineffective]{.mark} Arctic [Council could have dire implications
for]{.mark} the]{.underline} region\'s
**[[environment]{.underline}]{.mark}** and its 4 million inhabitants
[who face the effects of **melting sea ice** and]{.underline} the
interest of non-Arctic countries in the region\'s mostly [untapped
mineral **resources**]{.underline}.

[The [work]{.mark} of the **council**]{.underline}, which comprises the
eight Arctic states of Finland, Norway, Iceland, Sweden, Russia,
Denmark, Canada and the United States, in the past [[has
produced]{.mark} **binding [agreements]{.mark}** [on]{.mark}
**environmental [protection]{.mark}** and preservation]{.underline}.

It is also a rare platform giving a voice to the region\'s Indigenous
peoples. It does not deal with security issues.

[But [with the **end of cooperation**]{.mark} with Moscow]{.underline},
about a third of [the council\'s]{.underline} 130 [[projects are **on
hold**]{.underline}]{.mark}, [[new projects **cannot go ahead**]{.mark}
and existing ones **cannot be renewed**]{.underline}. Western and
Russian [[scientists no longer share]{.mark} **climate change**
[findings]{.mark}]{.underline}, for example, and [[cooperation
for]{.mark} possible **search-and-rescue** missions or [**oil spills**
has stopped]{.mark}]{.underline}.

\"I am worried that this will really hobble the ability of the Arctic
Council to work through these various issues,\" U.S. senator Angus King
from Maine told Reuters.

A DIVIDED REGION?

The Arctic is warming about four times as fast as the rest of the world.

As sea ice vanishes, polar waters are opening to shipping and other
industries eager to exploit the region\'s bounty of natural resources,
including oil, gas, and metals such as gold, iron and rare earths.

The discord between Russia and the other Arctic Council members means
that an effective response to these changes is far less likely.

\"Norway has a big challenge,\" said John Holdren, co-director of the
Harvard Kennedy School\'s Arctic Initiative and a former science advisor
to U.S. President Barack Obama. \"That\'s how to rescue as much as
possible of the Arctic Council\'s good work in the absence of Russia.\"

Russia argues this work cannot continue without it.

The council is weakening, Russian Arctic Ambassador Nikolay Korchunov
told Reuters, saying he was not confident it \"will be able to remain
the main platform on Arctic issues\".

Adding to the worries is the possibility that Russia will go its own way
on issues affecting the region or even establish a rival council.

Recently, it has taken steps to expand cooperation in the Arctic with
non-Arctic states. On April 24, Russia and China signed a memorandum
establishing cooperation between the countries\' coast guards in the
Arctic.

Days earlier, on April 14, Russia invited China, India, Brazil and South
Africa - the BRICS - to conduct research at its settlement on Svalbard,
an Arctic archipelago under Norwegian sovereignty where other countries
can operate under a 1920 Treaty.

\"Russia is seeking to build relationships with some non-Arctic
countries, particularly China, and that is a development that is
concerning,\" said David Balton, executive director of the Arctic
Steering Committee at the White House.

Russia\'s Korchunov said Moscow welcomed non-Arctic states in the
region, provided they did not come with a military agenda.

\"Our focus on a purely peaceful format of partnership also reflects the
need of development of scientific and economic cooperation with
non-Arctic countries,\" he said.

HOW TO ENGAGE WITH MOSCOW

Norway says it is \"optimistic\" a seamless transition of the
chairmanship from Russia can be achieved as it is in the interest of all
Arctic states to maintain the Arctic Council.

\"[[We need to safeguard the]{.mark} **Arctic
[Council]{.mark}**]{.underline} as the most important international
forum for Arctic cooperation [and make sure it survives]{.underline},\"
Norwegian Deputy Foreign Minister Eivind Vad Petersson told Reuters.

That will not be easy, given Oslo\'s own strained relations with Moscow.
In April, Oslo expelled 15 Russian diplomats saying they were spies.
Moscow denied the accusations and Korchunov said the expulsions
undermined the trust needed for cooperation.

Analysts say NATO-member Norway, which shares an Arctic border with
Russia, is still well-placed to handle the delicate balancing act with
Moscow.

\"Norway has been the most outspoken when it comes to the possibility of
keeping the door ajar so that Russia could, when politically feasible,
be part of the Arctic Council again,\" said Svein Vigeland Rottem, a
senior researcher in Arctic governance and security at the Fridtjof
Nansen Institute in Oslo.

Indeed, said lawmaker Aaja Chemnitz Larsen, [the **council** [will
eventually need to **reengage** with Russia]{.mark}]{.underline} even if
that moment has not yet arrived.

\"I don\'t see an Arctic Council without Russia in the future,\" said
Larsen, a Greenland lawmaker at the Danish Parliament and the Chair of
Arctic Parliamentarians, a body including MPs from across the Arctic
countries.

\"We need to be prepared for a different time when the war (in Ukraine)
one day will be over.\"

#### The Arctic Council is essential to facilitate resource extraction.

Peace.\" Foreign Policy. 4-4-2022. https://archive.ph/TrHyZ

As Russian forces continue to batter civilian targets in Ukraine, acting
in unrestrained defiance of international law, nations and organizations
around the world have chastised and imposed harsh punishments on Moscow.
But justified though this outrage may be, in some cases the perils of
alienating Russia outweigh the benefits.

Here, **[the Arctic is a crucial case study]{.underline}**. [The
region's geopolitical importance and fragile system of governance make
it fertile ground for **either cooperation** or
**conflict**.]{.underline} [And though over the past quarter century
[the **Arctic Council**]{.mark} [has sustained]{.mark} a workable **base
level of [cooperation]{.mark}**]{.underline}, [the
**[consequences]{.mark}** of a recent decision by]{.underline} seven of
its eight member states **[[to boycott]{.underline}]{.mark}** **[council
[activities]{.mark}]{.underline}** over Russia's military aggression
**[[could prove devastating.]{.underline}]{.mark}**

[[The **Arctic's strategic importance** owes in **large part** to its
**profound mineral wealth.**]{.underline}]{.mark} Courtesy of climate
change, rising temperatures are rapidly thawing barriers to the region's
bountiful natural resources. According to the Stimson Center, the region
may contain up to 90 billion barrels of oil and 47 trillion cubic meters
of natural gas, while the Wall Street Journal estimates [[the Arctic may
contain **some \$1 trillion worth of rare-earth
metals**]{.underline}]{.mark}---a set of 17 precious metallic elements
with critical importance for national defense equipment and consumer
electronics. Other sources of mineral wealth in the region include large
stores of gold, platinum, tin, diamonds, and zircon-titanium, as
explored in a recent study published in Ore Geology Reviews.

[[The **Arctic Council** was established]{.underline}]{.mark} in 1996 in
a bid [[to foster cooperation]{.mark} and]{.underline}
[coordination]{.underline} among the eight Arctic states---Canada,
Denmark, Finland, Iceland, Norway, Russia, Sweden, and the United
States---as well as Indigenous peoples and other regional stakeholders.
[These [member states]{.mark} [act as stewards of the
region,]{.mark}]{.underline} **[[implementing]{.underline}]{.mark}** a
patchwork of national, regional, and international treaties and
customary **[[laws]{.underline}]{.mark}** [[related to **environmental
protection**]{.underline}]{.mark}, emergency preparedness, **[[and
sustainable development]{.underline}]{.mark}**. The chairmanship of the
council rotates every two years among the eight member states. Russia
has been at its helm since May 2021.

Importantly, the council itself doesn't make or execute laws; rather, it
provides a forum for member states to reach multilateral agreements.
Member states, for example, can draft legally binding agreements that
carve out shared responsibilities for regional issues. Past agreements
have centered on search and rescue missions, marine oil pollution
preparedness, and enhanced scientific cooperation.

[[Agreements]{.mark} reached at the Arctic Council [**supplement** a
**variety of international legal** and **policy
frameworks**]{.mark}]{.underline}, including the United Nations
Convention on the Law of the Sea and the International Maritime
Organization (IMO) Polar Code. Its work is also complemented by a
patchwork of other regional and international organizations with varying
scopes and focuses. Some of these include the Arctic Coast Guard Forum,
IMO, Saami Council, and Barents Euro-Arctic Council---though, like the
Arctic Council, the latter recently suspended cooperation with Russia
over its invasion of Ukraine.

In short, there is no one entity that bears ultimate responsibility for
Arctic governance. [[Relative peace]{.mark} in the region [has long
rested on the **assumption**]{.mark} [that]{.mark} for the eight
**states wishing to preserve**---and retain control of---their
**[Arctic]{.mark} territories**, [the]{.mark} [benefits of
**cooperation**]{.mark} [outweigh its drawbacks]{.mark}. And in the
past, this utilitarian balance has held despite
provocations.]{.underline}

Augment America's commitment to leading on climate action in the region,
both at home and abroad

[[Creating a strong reputation]{.mark} [for credibility]{.mark}
[regarding]{.mark} the commitment to invest in low-[carbon]{.mark}
economic [growth]{.mark}]{.underline}, climate-resilient infrastructure
development, and calculated collaboration across borders on
environmental treaties [[provides the necessary next-step for **American
Arctic leadership**]{.underline}]{.mark}. Like the Special
Representative and Steering Committee, momentum exists upon which to
build.

Domestically, the Green New Deal offers an opportunity to lead in the
American Arctic by mitigating climate threats through a "10-year
mobilization" to reduce carbon emissions in the United States. The
United States could extend its vision in sourcing 100 percent of the
country's electricity from renewable and zero-emission power, digitizing
the power grid, updating building efficiency, and overhauling
transportation to Alaska. In a state where many communities are diesel
reliant off-road and off-grid settlements, this is not an easy task.
However, committing federal technical and financial resources that
empower U.S. Arctic communities to overcome energy and climate security
risks would send a strong message to other Arctic nations about the
United States' ability to lead by example.

[Internationally]{.underline}, [the United States can show climate
**leadership** by committing to reduce **black carbon emissions** in the
**Arctic**]{.underline}. Black carbon is the soot produced by burning
fossil fuels and biomass, which increases snow and ice melt by darkening
their surfaces and, in turn, increasing their retention of warmth.
[[Roughly one-third of]{.mark} [warming in the **Arctic**]{.mark} is
caused [by **black carbon emission**]{.mark} [of Arctic Council]{.mark}
[members]{.mark},]{.underline} including the United States. Under the
Trump Administration, [[**America** has]{.mark} [pulled out from]{.mark}
**joint reduction [targets]{.mark}** [through the **Arctic
Council**]{.mark}]{.underline}. [[This was]{.mark} a grave mistake and
[a **missed opportunity** for **straightforward cross-border
cooperation**]{.mark}]{.underline}. [[The United States can show
**regional leadership** by **reversing** this **decision** and
re-committing to its **target reductions** for black
carbon]{.mark}.]{.underline}

after the start of the war, seven of the eight Arctic Council members
announced that they would "pause" their work with the organization.
[Russia]{.underline}, which holds the council's presidency through 2023,
[was left ostracized.]{.underline} The freeze of the Arctic Council is a
loss on many fronts. [As a scholar of Arctic security, I see
[cooperation in the **region** as **essential to global**]{.mark}
**[security]{.mark}**, and I believe an expanded set of institutions is
needed to reflect new global realities as the Arctic warms.]{.underline}
Security and cooperation in the Arctic The eight Arctic countries formed
the Arctic Council in 1996. While the council explicitly steers clear of
military issues, its members are stewards of the Arctic region.
Unsurprisingly, the organization has grown in importance with global
warming. Warmer temperatures and declining sea ice are opening new
shipping routes and, likely, expanding opportunities to exploit oil, gas
and other critical minerals -- changes that could spur conflict if not
handled carefully. Through the council, the Arctic states have made
agreements related to search and rescue operations, oil pollution and
scientific collaboration. The council has tracked environmental changes
in the region with its yearly Arctic Climate Impact Assessment reports.
[Even when relations between East and West were at their
worst,]{.underline} including in 2014 when Russia invaded and annexed
the Crimean Peninsula from Ukraine, [joint endeavors in the Arctic
**remained strong.**]{.underline} Pausing the work of the Arctic Council
was an understandable response to Russia's invasion of Ukraine. Yet in
doing so, the other Arctic countries lost a valuable line of
communication with Moscow[. In time, it will be [important to resume the
council or establish a **new institution** in its
**place**.]{.mark}]{.underline} Indeed, working with Russia in the
Arctic is even more important now than it was before the invasion. From
a global security perspective, it is essential that the hot war in
Europe be prevented from spilling over into the Arctic and one of the
world's last wildernesses. **[The [case for engaging
Russia]{.mark}]{.underline}** Consider, for example, that while tensions
are at an all-time high in Ukraine, it might be easy to mistake a flock
of geese or a meteor shower for a military attack. Having a way for
errors like these to be quickly remedied will be important in this new
era of geopolitical competition. [Preserving and enhancing cooperation
in the Arctic will take bold leadership]{.underline}. Some critics argue
that institutionalizing military dialogue with Russia in the Arctic is
an improper response to wanton aggression in Eastern Europe and could be
seen as legitimizing Russia's actions. These are valid concerns.
However, [[**giving up** on **cooperation** would be a
**mistake**]{.mark}.]{.underline} The whole world will benefit if the
high north can avoid the fate of militarization, a costly arms race and
the terrible specter of war. [Ideally, [engaging Russia within
an]{.mark} expanded set of regional institutions -- an **[invigorated
Arctic Council]{.mark}**, to be sure, but also a new military forum --
[would precipitate a **cooperation spiral**]{.mark}, increasing
cooperation [that could **help lessen tensions** **elsewhere**]{.mark}.
Even if collaboration were confined to the Arctic, this would boost
global security.]{.underline} A new Arctic? In the past, the Arctic
states sought to maintain peace and stability in their region by
divorcing contentious military issues from areas where common ground was
easier to find. This has been the modus vivendi of the Arctic Council
since its founding. Going forward, it would be better to recognize that
robust and ongoing cooperation is needed on security issues, too. Trust
between Russia and the West might never return, but cooperation in the
Arctic cannot be allowed to disappear with it.

Fran Ulmer can speak from experience about the importance of [the
[Arctic Council]{.mark}]{.underline} and its work on finding solutions
to problems in the region. "It's [[been **hugely helpful**]{.underline}
[in getting]{.underline}]{.mark} [the Arctic [nations]{.mark} to work
[together]{.mark}]{.underline} on things like the two agreements that
were just adopted over the past two years: the search-and-rescue
agreement, and the responding-to-oil-spills agreement," she said. Ulmer
served as lieutenant governor and later as chancellor of the University
of Alaska-Anchorage before appointed in 2010 to the national Commission
on the BP Horizon Oil Spill and then in 2011 as chair of the U.S. Arctic
Research Commission. She says [[it's important to understand]{.mark} the
[significance of]{.mark} the]{.underline}
**[[U]{.underline}]{.mark}**nited **[[S]{.underline}]{.mark}**tates
[assuming]{.underline} the Arctic [Council [chairmanship, because of the
organization's]{.mark}]{.underline} research on climate change and its
**[[impact]{.mark} on this region.]{.underline}** And the growing
importance of that work as Arctic nations ramp up development of oil and
other resources here. "To the extent that people are thinking long-term
about where's energy going to come from," she said, "the Arctic is one
of the places where it is highly likely that it will be a supply source
-- whether it's from Russian waters or Canadian waters or U.S. waters or
Norwegian waters. The opportunity to exploit those resources is due in
part to melting Arctic sea ice. "Last week, we had the lowest winter
sea-ice extent ever recorded in the Arctic," Ulmer said. And that in
turn has opened up previously inaccessible offshore areas to oil and gas
exploration and development. "Thirty percent of the undiscovered gas in
the world is in the Arctic region," she said. "Thirteen percent of the
undiscovered oil is projected to be in the Arctic region." Ulmer says
Arctic [Council]{.underline} member [[nations]{.mark} have **[worked
together]{.mark}**]{.underline} [[to develop plans]{.mark} and policies
to deal [with]{.mark}]{.underline} the tricky business of
[developing]{.underline} Arctic oil [[resources]{.underline}]{.mark},
while at the same time researching the impacts of burning those fossil
fuels on the region's climate and peoples. She says [the [council
cooperates,]{.mark}]{.underline} [[because]{.mark} its members
understand that **[they're all in it]{.mark} together**]{.underline}.
"If there's a spill someplace in the Arctic, because of Arctic Ocean
currents," she said, "it's going to affect wildlife, it's going to
affect fish, it's going to affect shorelines -- not just in one country,
but in other countries." But [[some]{.mark} observers
[believe]{.mark}]{.underline} international [[tensions are]{.mark} now
[creating divisions]{.mark}]{.underline} among Arctic Council members.
They note that Secretary of State John Kerry will lead the U.S.
delegation at the Arctic Council's ministerial meeting that convenes
Friday morning in Iqaluit, the capital of the Canadian territory of
Nunavut. But his Russian counterpart, Sergei Lavrov, won'tbe there,
reportedly as a tit-for-tat response to snubs by the Canadians, who
didn't attend an Arctic Council meeting last year in Moscow to protest
Russian aggression in Ukraine and Crimea. "[There's no way to de-link
**completely** the Arctic from geopolitics]{.underline} in the world,"
said Lawson Brigham, a UAF distinguished professor of geography and
Arctic policy and a retired strategic planner for the Coast Guard.
[[Brigham]{.mark} says he]{.underline} [[doesn't think]{.mark} the
[dispute will disrupt]{.mark} this weekend's
[meeting]{.mark}]{.underline}. He says [the Arctic [Council]{.mark}
specifically [prohibited itself from involvement in military
matters]{.mark}]{.underline} when it was formed in 1996. And [[he thinks
it's **unlikely**]{.mark} that [Russian saber-rattling]{.mark} in the
Arctic [will lead to hostilities, because]{.mark} **that would be bad
for [business]{.mark}.** "The [notion]{.mark} that we're headed to some
kind [of regional conflict]{.mark}]{.underline} in the Arctic -- **[[I
don't buy it,"]{.underline}]{.mark}** Brigham said. "Because
[[all]{.mark} of the countries]{.underline}, including our Russian
friends, [[want to sell]{.mark} natural resources]{.underline} to the
planet." But Matt Felling, an aide to Sen. Lisa Murkowski, says
[Russia's military buildup]{.underline} in the region isn't going
unnoticed. "We've seen them moving military aircraft. We've seen them
boosting military muscle in the Arctic,..." he said. Felling says
Murkowski believes that [shouldn't deter the Arctic Council from its
work]{.underline}. He says Russia's involvement with the council is
essential, because it's the biggest Arctic nation with the biggest stake
in developing the region's resources.

#### Arctic Council leadership solves war.

[The [international structures that]{.mark} have helped [address many
Arctic problems]{.mark}]{.underline} [through **negotiation**
and]{.underline} **[cooperation]{.underline}** [[are
**insufficient**]{.underline} [for]{.underline}]{.mark} [the military
and **[security challenges]{.mark}**]{.underline} [brought on by climate
change]{.underline}.

[Decades of diplomacy have fostered forums such as the **[Arctic
Council]{.mark}**]{.underline}, [which]{.underline} regularly [brings
together stakeholders]{.underline} (including Arctic and non-Arctic
government representatives, indigenous leaders, business interests)
[to]{.underline} **[seek agreement on issues]{.underline}** [such as
search and rescue, oil pollution and scientific
cooperation]{.underline}. Another one, the Arctic Frontiers conference,
wraps up Jan. 30 in Tromsø, Norway. Other meetings like the Arctic
Circle, Arctic Dialogues, and the Arctic Shipping Forum enable further
debate.

But [such [meetings]{.mark} and institutions have been less successful
at]{.underline} **[addressing military operations]{.underline}** [in the
region]{.underline}. In part, [this is because if]{.underline} **[armed
forces]{.underline}** [are present in the Arctic, it's often connected
to some high-stakes geopolitical issue]{.underline} --- Russian activity
in Ukraine or the U.S. stance on Freedom of Navigation --- [and thus
deliberately]{.underline} **[avoided]{.underline}**. [The Arctic
Council]{.underline}, for example, [explicitly [eschew]{.mark}s any
discussion of [military matters]{.mark}]{.underline}. The Arctic Coast
Guard Forum focuses on issues of safety, environmental stewardship, law
enforcement, and operational response --- but not military operations.

There is an Arctic Security Forces Roundtable and a limited number of
bi-lateral or multi-lateral Arctic security exercises. These provide
some opportunities for engagement but lack the consistency or clear
mission of non-military Arctic cooperative activities. Furthermore, the
Security Forces Roundtable has excluded Russia since 2014, when it
seized Crimea and launched military activity in Ukraine.

[[Creating]{.mark} a [regular]{.mark}, inclusive [discussion]{.mark} of
**defense issues**]{.underline} [[is]{.underline}]{.mark}
**[[vital]{.underline}]{.mark}** [for the Arctic region, where [the
greatest]{.mark} near-term **security [risk]{.mark}**]{.underline} [[may
be]{.mark} that of]{.underline} **[military
[miscalculation]{.mark}]{.underline}**. Resource wars are far off and
unlikely; most potentially profitable ventures are in undisputed areas.
Investors and insurers can weigh profit and risk potential on that
front.

But [there are at least [two scenarios]{.mark} that [could lead
to]{.mark}]{.underline} **[dangerous]{.underline}**
[military]{.underline} **[[miscalculation]{.underline}]{.mark}**:

[[A **race to militarize**]{.underline}]{.mark} [the Arctic,
[which]{.mark} will not only result in **diplomatic
consequences**]{.underline} [and potentially dampen emerging economic
prospects, but also **[increase]{.mark}** the [**likelihood** of]{.mark}
**military [assets]{.mark}**]{.underline} [[coming into]{.mark} **close
[contact]{.mark}**]{.underline}; [or]{.underline}

[The [perception that there's a]{.mark}]{.underline} **[[void in
security]{.underline}]{.mark}** and stewardship -- [fueled by potential
increases in **ship collisions**]{.underline}, [**illegal fishing**, and
demonstrated limitations in]{.underline} **[search and
rescue]{.underline}** [ability]{.underline} --- [that [opens the door
for countries]{.mark} like China [to justify]{.mark} an
**increase**]{.underline} [in [their own]{.mark}]{.underline}
**[[regional capabilities]{.underline}]{.mark}**.

[The former scenario represents too much security. The latter could
emerge under too little. [The two]{.mark} scenarios
[are]{.mark}]{.underline} **[[equally dangerous]{.underline}]{.mark}**
[and shifting conditions could **tip the balance**]{.underline} [in
either direction. [Either could begin with **non-adversarial
intensions**]{.mark}]{.underline} [[and "**snowball**]{.mark}" into
increased **military activity**]{.underline} [and decreased space for
**dialogue**]{.underline} [and]{.underline}
**[cooperation]{.underline}**. [Both are avoidable, but only if there
are opportunities to gain]{.underline} **[mutual
understanding]{.underline}**, if not more formal security cooperation.

Still, by cooperating in the May 11 meeting, [[Russia]{.mark}
[signaled]{.mark} at least [some investment in the]{.mark} **[council's
survival]{.mark}**]{.underline}. [[And it took]{.underline}]{.mark} what
Hoglund called [a ["powerful step forward]{.mark}":]{.underline} After
the meeting, the council released a joint declaration signed by all
members, including Russian senior Arctic official Nikolay Korchunov.

"[We wanted to give the message that [the **Arctic Council is not
dead**, it's **still here,**]{.mark} [and **we want to make it relevant
again**]{.mark}]{.underline}," Hoglund said.

A declaration of life seems all the council can currently muster. Volker
Rachold, director of the German Arctic Office, called this year's joint
declaration "highly unusual." Typically, after the standard affirmation
of the council's purpose, the declaration outlines goals and new
projects for the next two years. This year, he said, the statement was
notably sparse.

"After the usual opening remarks, it just seemed to stop," Rachold said.
"I thought I was missing pages."

[Rottem believes that, for now, Norway has a lot to gain from staying
vague]{.underline}. Any fanfare or strong statement, he said, threatens
a more formal fracture. Starting new projects would force hard questions
about how to treat the consensus vote. But the small Nordic nation,
which shares a land border with Russia, is well-practiced in walking a
fine diplomatic line with its neighbor. For now, by moving slowly and
staying light on details, it may just keep the past 30 years of work
afloat.

In June, **[[Arctic Council leaders will meet
again]{.underline}]{.mark}**---this time without Russia---[[to
**discuss** a **potential path forward**]{.mark}.]{.underline} Hoglund
said that he hopes to have a sense of next steps by the end of the
summer, but it's no hard deadline. Generally, he said, those eager to
see the work of the Arctic Council resume at full strength will be
disappointed.

"[We're not here ringing a bell to say we're back; we're focused on
taking it step by step,"]{.underline} Hoglund said. ["[If cooperation
**breaks down completely**, it will be **so much harder to rebuild it
from scratch."**]{.underline}]{.mark}

State secretary for the Norwegian ministry for foreign affairs, Maria
Varteressian (Labor), made sure she was crystal clear from the Arctic
Circle Assembly stage in Reykjavik:

"[[The Arctic Council is **very much alive**]{.underline}, [and it will

firmly.

team]{.mark}]{.underline} has worked tirelessly to do this for the past
six months. Not only [[keeping the council]{.mark} alive, but also
keeping it **working** [under]{.mark} [**extraordinary

The [[exploitation of **Arctic oil**]{.mark} and gas resources and their
transport to markets in Europe and Asia [has become a]{.mark} major
economic [**priority** for Moscow]{.mark} as its hydrocarbon reserves
below the Arctic Circle begin to dry up[.]{.mark}]{.underline} Despite
calls at home for greater economic diversity, President Vladimir Putin's
regime continues to insist on the centrality of hydrocarbon production
to the country's economic future. In that context, production in the
Arctic has become an essential national objective, which, in turn,
requires assured access to the Atlantic Ocean via the Barents Sea and
Norway's offshore waters. Think of that waterway as vital to Russia's
energy economy in the way the Strait of Hormuz, connecting the Persian
Gulf to the Indian Ocean, is to the Saudis and other regional
fossil-fuel producers.

THE MILITARY DIMENSION

No less than Russia's giant energy firms, its navy must be able to enter
the Atlantic via the Barents Sea and northern Norway. Aside from its
Baltic and Black Sea ports, accessible to the Atlantic only via
passageways easily obstructed by NATO, the sole Russian harbor with
unfettered access to the Atlantic Ocean is at Murmansk on the Kola
Peninsula. Not surprisingly then, that port is also the headquarters for
Russia's Northern Fleet---its most powerful---and the site of numerous
air, infantry, missile, and radar bases along with naval shipyards and
nuclear reactors. In other words, it's among the most sensitive military
regions in Russia today.

Given all this, President Putin has substantially rebuilt that very
fleet, which fell into disrepair after the collapse of the Soviet Union,
equipping it with some of the country's most advanced warships. In 2018,
according to The Military Balance, a publication of the International
Institute for Strategic Studies, it already possessed the largest number
of modern cruisers and destroyers (10) of any Russian fleet, along with
22 attack submarines and numerous support vessels. Also in the Murmansk
area are dozens of advanced MiG fighter planes and a wide assortment of
anti-aircraft defense systems. Finally, as 2019 ended, Russian military
officials indicated for the first time that they had deployed to the
Arctic the Kinzhal air-launched ballistic missile, a weapon capable of
hypersonic velocities (more than five times the speed of sound), again
presumably to a base in the Murmansk region just 125 miles from Norway's
Finnmark, the site of the upcoming NATO exercise.

More significant yet is the way Moscow has been strengthening its
nuclear forces in the region. Like the United States, Russia maintains a
"triad" of nuclear delivery systems, including intercontinental
ballistic missiles (ICBMs), long-range "heavy" bombers, and
submarine-launched ballistic missiles (SLBMs). Under the terms of the
New Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty (New START), signed by the two
countries in 2010, the Russians can deploy no more than 700 delivery
systems capable of carrying no more than 1,550 warheads. (That pact
will, however, expire in February 2021 unless the two sides agree to an
extension, which appears increasingly unlikely in the age of Trump.)
According to the Arms Control Association, the [[Russians
are]{.underline}]{.mark} currently believed to be
[[deploying]{.underline}]{.mark} the warheads they are allowed under New
START on 66 heavy bombers, 286 ICBMs, and [12 submarines with 160 SLBMs.
**[Eight]{.mark} of those**]{.underline} [[nuclear-armed subs]{.mark}
are, in fact, assigned [to the **Northern Fleet**]{.mark}]{.underline},
which means about 110 missiles with as many as 500 warheads---the exact
numbers remain shrouded in secrecy---are deployed [in the Murmansk
area.]{.underline}

[For **Russia**n nuclear strategists, such nuclear-armed
**sub**marine**s** are considered the most "survivable" of the country's
retaliatory systems[.]{.mark}]{.underline} In the event of a nuclear
exchange with the United States, the country's heavy bombers and ICBMs
could prove relatively vulnerable to pre-emptive strikes as their
locations are known and can be targeted by American bombs and missiles
with near-pinpoint accuracy. Those subs, however, can leave Murmansk and
disappear into the wide Atlantic Ocean at the onset of any crisis and so
presumably remain hidden from US spying eyes. To do so, however,
requires that they pass through the Barents Sea, avoiding the NATO
forces lurking nearby. For Moscow, in other words, the very possibility
of deterring a US nuclear strike hinges on its ability to defend its
naval stronghold in Murmansk, while maneuvering its submarines past
Norway's Finnmark region. [**No wonder**, then, that this area has
assumed **enormous strategic importance** for Russian military
planners]{.underline}---and the upcoming Cold Response 2020 is sure to
prove challenging to them[.]{.underline}

WASHINGTON'S ARCTIC BUILDUP

During the Cold War era, Washington viewed the Arctic as a significant
strategic arena and constructed a string of military bases across the
region. Their main aim: to intercept Soviet bombers and missiles
crossing the North Pole on their way to targets in North America. After
the Soviet Union imploded in 1991, Washington abandoned many of those
bases. Now, however, with the Pentagon once again identifying "great
power competition" with Russia and China as the defining characteristic
of the present strategic environment, many of those bases are being
reoccupied and new ones established. Once again, the Arctic is being
viewed as a potential site of conflict with Russia and, as a result, US
forces are being readied for possible combat there.

Secretary of State Mike Pompeo was the first official to explain this
new strategic outlook at the Arctic Forum in Finland last May. In his
address, a kind of "Pompeo Doctrine," he indicated that the United
States was shifting from benign neglect of the region to aggressive
involvement and militarization. "We're entering a new age of strategic
engagement in the Arctic," he insisted, "complete with new threats to
the Arctic and its real estate, and to all of our interests in that
region." To better protect those interests against Russia's military
buildup there, "we are fortifying America's security and diplomatic
presence in the area...hosting military exercises, strengthening our
force presence, rebuilding our icebreaker fleet, expanding Coast Guard
funding, and creating a new senior military post for Arctic Affairs
inside of our own military."

The Pentagon has been unwilling to provide many details, but a close
reading of the military press suggests that this activity has been
particularly focused on northern Norway and adjacent waters. To begin
with, the Marine Corps has established a permanent presence in that
country, the first time foreign forces have been stationed there since
German troops occupied it during World War II. A detachment of about 330
Marines were initially deployed near the port of Trondheim in 2017,
presumably to help guard nearby caves that contain hundreds of US tanks
and combat vehicles. Two years later, a similarly sized group was then
dispatched to the Troms region above the Arctic Circle and far closer to
the Russian border.

From the Russian perspective, even more threatening is the construction
of a US radar station on the Norwegian island of Vardø about 40 miles
from the Kola Peninsula. To be operated in conjunction with the
Norwegian intelligence service, the focus of the facility will evidently
be to snoop on those Russian missile-carrying submarines, assumedly in
order to target them and take them out in the earliest stages of any
conflict. That Moscow fears just such an outcome is evident from the
mock attack it staged on the Vardø facility in 2018, sending 11 Su-24
supersonic bombers on a direct path toward the island. (They turned
aside at the last moment.) It has also moved a surface-to-surface
missile battery to a spot just 40 miles from Vardø.

In addition, in August 2018, the US Navy decided to reactivate the
previously decommissioned Second Fleet in the North Atlantic. "A new
Second Fleet increases our strategic flexibility to respond---from the
Eastern Seaboard to the Barents Sea," said Chief of Naval Operations
John Richardson at the time. As last year ended, that fleet was declared
fully operational.

DECIPHERING COLD RESPONSE 2020

Exercise Cold Response 2020 must be viewed in the context of all these
developments. Few details about the thinking behind the upcoming war
games have been made public, but [it's not hard to imagine]{.underline}
what at least part of the scenario might be like: [a US-Russian
clash]{.underline} of some sort [leading to **[Russian attacks]{.mark}**
aimed at seizing that radar station at Vardø and Norway's defense
headquarters at Bodø on the country's northwestern coast. The invading
troops [will be **slowed** ]{.mark}**but not stopped** [by Norwegian
forces]{.mark}]{.underline} (and those US Marines stationed in the
area), [[while]{.mark} thousands of reinforcements from NATO bases
elsewhere in Europe begin to pour in.]{.underline}
**[Eventually]{.underline}**, of course, the tide will turn and [the
Russians will be forced back.]{.underline}

No matter what the official scenario is like, however, for Pentagon
planners the situation will go far beyond this. [Any Russian
assault]{.underline} on critical Norwegian military facilities would
presumably be preceded by intense air and missile bombardment and the
forward deployment of major naval vessels. [This]{.underline}, in turn,
[would prompt [**comparable moves** by]{.mark} the United States and
**[NATO]{.mark}**, probably **[result]{.mark}**ing [in]{.mark} violent
encounters and the **[loss of major assets]{.mark}** on all
sides[.]{.mark} In the process, [Russia's **key nuclear
retaliatory**]{.mark}]{.underline} [[**forces** would be **at risk**
and]{.mark} quickly [placed on **high alert**]{.mark}]{.underline} with
senior officers operating in hair-trigger mode[[. Any misstep]{.mark}
might]{.underline} then [[lead to]{.underline}]{.mark} what humanity has
feared since August 1945: a [**[nuclear apocalypse]{.mark} on Planet
Earth**.]{.underline}

There is no way to know to what degree such considerations are
incorporated into the classified versions of the Cold Response 2020
scenario, but it's unlikely that they're missing. Indeed, a 2016 version
of the exercise involved the participation of three B-52 nuclear bombers
from the US Strategic Air Command, indicating that the American military
is keenly aware of the escalatory risks of any large-scale US-Russian
encounter in the Arctic.

In short, what might otherwise seem like a routine training exercise in
a distant part of the world is actually part of an emerging US strategy
to overpower Russia in a critical defensive zone, an approach that could
easily result in nuclear war. The Russians are, of course, well aware of
this and so will undoubtedly be watching Cold Response 2020 with genuine
trepidation. Their fears are understandable---but we should all be
concerned about a strategy that seemingly embodies such a high risk of
future escalation.

Ever since the Soviets acquired nuclear weapons of their own in 1949,
strategists have wondered how and where an all-out nuclear war---World
War III---would break out. At one time, that incendiary scenario was
believed most likely to involve a clash over the divided city of Berlin
or along the East-West border in Germany. After the Cold War, however,
fears of such a deadly encounter evaporated and few gave much thought to
such possibilities. Looking forward today, however, [the prospect of a
catastrophic World War III is again becoming **all too
imaginable**]{.underline} and this time, it appears, [an incident
in]{.underline} the **[[Arctic could]{.mark} prove the [spark]{.mark}
for [Armageddon]{.mark}]{.underline}**.

Korea to Russia through the Northern Sea Route last month was a Russian
tanker carrying liquefied natural gas (LNG). And in August last year, a
Russian tanker sailed from Norway to South Korea without the help of a
specialised ice-breaking vessel, in two-thirds of the time it takes to
complete the regular route through the Suez Canal. Russia's President,
Vladimir [Putin, called this a "big event in the opening up of the
Arctic".]{.underline} Sailors have long sought an accessible route
through the Arctic between the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans. Until
recently, ice has made crossings impossible. But as global warming
continues to melt Arctic ice at an unprecedented rate (temperatures here
are warming more than twice as fast as they are for the planet as a
whole), scientists have predicted that European shipping will be able to
reach Asia 10 days quicker by the middle of the century, set against
today's usual routes. All [[this **increases**]{.mark} **the potential
for [territorial ambitions]{.mark}** to become problematic]{.underline}.
A 1982 UN Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS) allows each Arctic
state -- Canada, Denmark, Finland, Iceland, Norway, Russia, Sweden and
the US -- an economic zone extending 200 nautical miles from their
coastlines, in which they can explore and exploit resources. Countries
can apply to extend this zone if they believe their continental margin
extends further: this has already caused tension between states.
Denmark, for example, has claimed territory around Lomonosov Ridge
including the North Pole, which overlaps with large parts of Russia's
claim. The EU, and nine of the world's biggest fishing nations including
Canada, Russia, China, the US, Japan, Iceland, Denmark and South Korea,
signed a temporary agreement last year to prohibit fishing in the
central Arctic Ocean for 16 years in order to allow scientific research
to examine the area unhindered. But as it becomes more accessible,
[[Arctic states]{.mark} are]{.underline} now [[look]{.mark}ing [at how
they can exploit the area]{.mark}]{.underline} for natural resources.
Experts suggest that, at the current rate of ice decline, it will become
economically feasible to set up extraction operations by around 2040.
Chris Yesson, research fellow at the Institute of Zoology, says that,
while winter crossings will remain rare in the short term, the shipping
which does traverse the Arctic ocean will probably transport high-value
materials such as fuel. This could in turn cause more ice to break up,
as well as increasing noise pollution and raising the risk of oil and
gas spillage. "Greater access increases attention on the area; creating
well-established routes into the area makes it easier for other
commercial activities to move in," he says. However, Klauss Dodds,
professor of Geopolitics at Royal Holloway University, argues that
melting ice doesn't always equate to increased accessibility. "People
will increasingly be asking if the Northern Sea Route is more and more
more accessible, but it's a big 'if' because conditions are still very
unpredictable and difficult to manage. "It's far too simplistic to say
that the sea ice is retracting, and therefore access into the Arctic is
going to be easier. It's more complicated than that." [[Russia is at the
forefront]{.mark} of activity in the Arctic]{.underline}, and is said to
be rapidly expanding its influence. It has 46 icebreakers, according to
the US Coast Guard. Finland has the next highest total: seven. Arguably
this is proportionate to the size of Russia's territory in the Arctic,
but [concern is mounting at how [the potential]{.mark} for improved
access [might **raise geopolitical tensions**]{.mark}]{.underline}.
Dodds says that [even the Arctic simply appearing more accessible could
cause **problems**]{.underline}. And it is notable that the Northern Sea
Route is covered by Russia's exclusive economic zone.

With much of the world's attention focused on US President Donald
Trump's historic visit to the Middle East or the fluctuating progress of
talks between Russia and Ukraine, a quiet but consequential event took
place last week that largely escaped notice.

In Norway, relatively low-level officials gathered for a closed-door
ceremony to mark the transfer of the Arctic Council's two-year rotating
chairmanship from Norway to Denmark. This may seem mundane. In fact it
was an important moment for one of the world's few remaining forums
where East and West, until recently, found ways to cooperate.

**[[The council]{.underline}]{.mark}**, established in 1996, [brings
together the **eight Arctic states**]{.underline} --- Canada, Denmark
(through Greenland), Finland, Iceland, Norway, Russia, Sweden, and the
US --- [to collaborate on **non-military issues**]{.underline}. [[For
years]{.mark}, it **[functioned effectively]{.mark}** [by focusing
on]{.mark} **practical**, **[low-conflict areas]{.mark}** such as
**environmental protection**, search and rescue coordination, and oil
spill response.]{.underline}

This pragmatic approach allowed the council to thrive, even during
periods of broader geopolitical tension. Crucially, it also includes six
indigenous organizations as permanent participants, giving the peoples
who live in the Arctic a direct voice in shaping its future. Observer
states, including faraway Singapore and major players such as China,
contribute expertise and funding, but have no vote.

[[This system worked --- **until it didn't**.]{.underline}]{.mark}

[The invasion of [Ukraine]{.mark} by Russia]{.underline} in February
2022 [**[shattered]{.mark}** many channels of **[cooperation]{.mark}**
between Moscow and the West, **[including the Arctic
Council]{.mark}**]{.underline}[.]{.mark} Although Russia handed over the
chairmanship to Norway in May of that year, the customary fanfare was
noticeably absent. Over the past two years Norway has tried to keep the
council afloat, but the breakdown in relations with Russia rendered it
largely ineffective. By the time Norway passed the chairmanship to
Denmark, the best that could be said was that the council still existed.

[Complicating matters further are [suggestions]{.mark} by [Trump that
the US might seek to]{.mark} [**annex** **Greenland**]{.mark} and an
unwillingness to **rule out military force** to do so,]{.underline}
[which have **[alarmed NATO allies]{.mark}** [and **unsettled** the
**Arctic Council's delicate balance**]{.mark}.]{.underline} That may
explain why it was Greenland's foreign minister, rather than a Danish
official, who accepted the chairmanship on Denmark's behalf. How [this
[tension between the US and Denmark]{.mark}]{.underline} plays out
within the council remains to be seen, but it [[will not make
**cooperation**]{.mark} any **[easier]{.mark}**.]{.underline}

[With the council unable to conduct substantial work, its immediate goal
is simply to survive]{.underline}. Should a ceasefire or peace agreement
be reached in Ukraine, [[some might push to **quickly**]{.mark}
**[revive the council]{.mark}**, [but]{.mark} they [would **face serious
headwinds**]{.mark}]{.underline}. Since 2022, [[the]{.mark} **[Arctic
security]{.mark}** [landscape]{.mark} has **[changed
profoundly]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Norway's newly released national
security strategy describes its situation as "the most serious \... our
country has faced since the Second World War."

What happens in the Arctic is often shaped by geopolitical currents
elsewhere, and increasingly what happens in the Arctic has consequences
across the globe.

[[Finland and Sweden]{.underline}]{.mark}, [[previously]{.mark}
militarily [non-aligned]{.mark}, have **[joined NATO]{.mark}**,
placing]{.underline} [**seven of the eight Arctic states** under the
same **security umbrella**]{.underline}. Their accession to the alliance
would have been unimaginable before Russia's invasion. [The new Canadian
government is **expanding** its **presence in the Arctic**]{.underline},
[for geopolitical reasons that are unlikely to **disappear anytime
soon**]{.underline}: [[Russia's actions in Ukraine **have left deep
scars**]{.mark}.]{.underline}

This evolving environment also affects non-Arctic states seeking a
larger role in the region. China, for example, has been one of the major
losers of the Arctic Council's dysfunction. Beijing used the forum to
expand influence in polar affairs. With the council no longer
functioning as it once did, China has lost a key international venue. In
response, Russia and China have deepened their cooperation in the
Arctic, particularly on energy and infrastructure projects, driven
partly by Western sanctions.

If the Arctic Council does eventually resume full operations, expect
China to re-engage quickly to regain lost ground.

[Another unresolved challenge concerns indigenous
representation]{.underline}. Among the six permanent indigenous
participants is the Russian Association of Indigenous Peoples of the
North. However, many indigenous Russians have fled the country and
formed exile organizations, such as the International Committee of
Indigenous Peoples of Russia. These groups seek a seat at the Arctic
Council table, but so far no effort has been made to include them.
Moscow would undoubtedly veto any attempt to do so. If the council hopes
to rebuild credibility, it cannot return to business as usual while
excluding exiled indigenous voices. Navigating this will be tricky, but
necessary.

[[Has the damage to **trust between Russia** and its **Arctic neighbors
gone too far** for the **council to recover**]{.mark}**?** It's too
early to say, [but it **cannot be ruled out**.]{.mark}]{.underline}

Danish Relations with the US

In recent months, the Danish Presidency of the Arctic Council has been
challenged by the new US position on the Arctic, Greenland and Europe.
President Donald **[[Trump's]{.underline}]{.mark}** [continued
[provocative statements]{.mark} [regarding]{.mark} the potential
[transfer of Greenland]{.mark} to US control have **[heightened
political]{.mark} [tensions]{.mark}**]{.underline}. However, neither the
Kingdom of Denmark as a whole nor Greenland itself has supported these
assertions. In April 2025, Danish Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen made
an official visit to Nuuk, where she, together with Greenland's acting
head of government Múte Bourup Egede and newly elected head of
government Jens-Frederik Nielsen issued a statement rejecting any
external claims. This joint statement demonstrates unity within the
Danish Realm in the face of external pressure.

[[The U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates [views Greenland as]{.mark} a
**[strategically important]{.mark}** **territory** [for]{.mark} its
**[missile defense]{.mark}** and **Arctic surveillance
system**]{.underline}, [especially in the context of the development of
the **Pituffik base**]{.underline}. [This is related to the **US
strategic pressure** on the **Kingdom**]{.underline}. Denmark's response
has been to strengthen its position in the Arctic while avoiding direct
confrontation with the United States, supporting Greenland's right to
self-determination, and strengthening its defense to protect its
interests in the region. However, [**[growing pressure]{.mark}** from
the **US** [is undermining the]{.mark} **Kingdom's diplomatic**

[**contributing** to the]{.mark} [**decline** of the Arctic Council's
influence as a **platform for regional

#### NATO-Russia tensions over Ukraine make Arctic Council cooperation impossible.

has always been an Arctic Alliance (Part II).\" Arctic Institute -

[**Despite growing tension** between **Russia** and the **West**
**throughout the 2000s**]{.underline}, [not even NATO
enlargement]{.underline} into the Baltics and Balkans in 2004 and 2009,
the Russian invasion of Georgia in 2008, its military intervention in
Syria, [and]{.underline} the annexation of Ukraine's
[Crimea]{.underline} peninsula in 2014 [could shake the relative
stability of Arctic relations.]{.underline}12) While Europe was in
crisis following Russia's incursion into Ukrainian territory, the
members of the Arctic Council maintained good relations and cooperation
continued in various regional organizations throughout the north. Some
joint military exercises between NATO states and Russia were cancelled,
but the tradition of Arctic exceptionalism continued mostly unaffected
under the well-known adage of "High North, low tension."13)

[The **watershed moment** came in February 2022, [when **Russia launched
a full-scale**]{.mark} **[invasion against
Ukraine]{.mark}**]{.underline}. [In the months that followed, [the
Arctic Council]{.mark} members issued a statement that they [**would**
**pause work** with **Russia**]{.mark},]{.underline}14) [and
[Sweden]{.mark} and Finland **[negated decades]{.mark}** [of
**neutrality**]{.mark} policy when they petitioned to **become NATO
members**]{.underline}.15) Finland was admitted to the Alliance in April
2023, followed by Sweden in March 2024, making seven out of eight Arctic
states NATO members.

[[**Russia's latest** unprovoked]{.mark} **[violence]{.mark}** in
**Ukraine** has irreparably [changed the]{.mark} [**security landscape**
of]{.mark} both [**Europe** and the **Arctic**]{.mark}]{.underline}.16)
[The breakdown of relations has **been far-reaching**]{.underline},
[[affecting]{.underline}]{.mark} everything from major intergovernmental
bodies such as [[the Arctic Council]{.underline}]{.mark}
[and]{.underline} regional partnerships such as [the Barents Euro-Arctic
Council]{.underline} (BEAC), which Russia dropped out of in September
2023 [after stating that **[Western hostility]{.mark}** was [to
**blame** for the **lack of cooperation**]{.mark}]{.underline}.17)
[Arctic Indigenous groups have reported difficulties in carrying out
ongoing initiatives to strengthen Indigenous rights]{.underline} and
monitor environmental problems in the north [after the fracture of
relations between **Russia** and the **West**]{.underline}.18) Yet
[Russia remains a formidable force in the north,]{.underline} with
jurisdiction over 53 percent of the Arctic coastline. Contrary to what
some journalists have argued, Russia has not "lost the Arctic to
NATO,"19) considering that the Russian Arctic is the most populated and
industrialized northern region in the world, and that it has a
substantial head start on Arctic military build-up and navigation
compared to most other Arctic states.20) Russia also significantly
outnumbers NATO in terms of military bases in the Arctic.

Although [the **[Arctic Council]{.mark}**]{.underline} has a good
foundation, it [is [**constrained** in **significant ways**]{.mark}. The
first]{.underline} of these [is **[funding]{.mark}**]{.underline}. While
the Arctic Council Secretariat seems adequately funded (1.24 million USD
in 2017, with Norway contributing half), [[it has **very little
discretionary funding**]{.underline}]{.mark}. Similarly, [the **[Working
Groups]{.mark}**]{.underline} rely on one or two states to fund a
secretariat but [have **[limited]{.mark}**]{.underline} ongoing [project
funds]{.underline}. Almost all activities are funded on an ad hoc basis
by the states who advocated for them and by individual experts who
secure their own funding through national channels. Thus, all too often
it is [funding]{.underline} that [drives projects, **not**
projects]{.underline} that [drive funding. [This makes it
**difficult**]{.mark}]{.underline} to be strategic with planning, [or
[to organize **new activities**]{.underline}]{.mark} [beyond a **one or
two year window**]{.underline}. Moreover, funding to support the
capacity and participation of Permanent Participants is a constant
source of concern. The establishment of the widely publicized Álgu Fund,
conceptualized as a "capacity-building endowment" has not been
successful in addressing this challenge as of yet.

While [the Arctic Council]{.underline} has made good progress on
becoming more transparent in recent years through its open access
archive, it still [**[struggles]{.mark}** to be **[accountable]{.mark}**
to stakeholders]{.underline}, northerners, and taxpayers. [[This is
**not** for lack of **effort**, but **due to its structure**]{.mark}. It
[has a **voluntary character**]{.mark}, which prevents **[binding
commitments]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Ministerial Declarations contain
many subjective statements that are difficult to account for, and no
formal efforts are made to assess them. A tracking tool, the Amarok, has
been established to document life cycle phases of various projects and
initiatives, but there are no resources to systematically measure
progress on outcomes, value for money/effort, or implementation, or to
provide ongoing monitoring.

Scorched Earth Policy

Ultimately, this means that [[the Arctic Council]{.mark} now
[faces]{.mark} **two [terrible scenarios]{.mark}**]{.underline}. [The
first is that in his scorched earth policy **toward
multilateralism**]{.underline}, [[Trump]{.mark} [will]{.mark} either
move to [end the Arctic Council]{.mark} [or]{.mark} at least [**remove**
the **U.S. as a member**]{.mark}]{.underline}. [[He may also
carry]{.mark} [out his threat to ensure]{.mark}]{.underline} [that both
[Canada and Denmark]{.mark} also [cease to be **meaningful**]{.mark}
**[members]{.mark}** [of the]{.mark} **Arctic
[Council]{.mark}**]{.underline}. If he truly does intend to take over
Canada, it won't even be a state. Even if he only means to weaken and
reduce [Canada]{.underline} to a vassal state, its [ability to
participate will be **damaged**]{.underline} -- **[if not
eliminated.]{.underline}**

Likewise, if the U.S. takes over Greenland, Denmark's main rational for
being a member of the Arctic Council will be eliminated. [Assuming that
somehow the Arctic Council **survives** an **American
withdrawal**]{.underline}, [and the U.S. follows up its threats to
control **Greenland** and **Canada**]{.underline}, [the Council would
have only the active membership of Finland, Sweden, Norway and
Iceland.]{.underline}

[**[Even if]{.underline}** [the U.S. **remains** in the **Arctic
Council**]{.underline}]{.mark}[, [its]{.mark} current [actions means
the]{.mark} [gutting]{.mark} of some [of]{.mark} its most [important
missions]{.mark}]{.underline}, [The U.S. won't support actions to
eliminate the **causes** of **climate change**]{.underline}, and it is
very unlikely to support the Permanent Participants. Outside of the
Council, perhaps the Coast Guard forum will continue. But even here
Trump is having an impact. He has already fired Admiral Linda Pagan, the
Commandant of the USCG. American officials have suggested it was because
of her commitment to DEI policies.

[Even more dangerously, this variant of the Arctic Council would include
a U.S. whose policies are now at complete odds with the previous actions
of the Arctic Council]{.underline}. [It would also include a Denmark
that has either lost Greenland to the U.S. or will need to **take
action** to **prevent this**]{.underline}. [It will include a Canada
that is being continually weakened by American action]{.underline}, and
is either actively trying to stop an American takeover or has become a
vassal state to the U.S. [It will also include a Russia that is being
**increasingly supported** by **the U.S.**]{.underline} and has been
given the right of conquest over Ukraine. Furthermore, [if Ukraine
was]{.underline} conquered for considering joining NATO, [[the future of
both **Finland** and **Sweden**]{.underline}]{.mark} (which did actually
join NATO) [[will]{.mark} undoubtedly [be]{.mark} **even more
[problematic]{.mark}** [for **Russia**]{.mark}.]{.underline}

[These are [**dire times** for the **Arctic
Council**]{.mark}]{.underline}. It is hard to think of a way to maintain
its many successes in supporting an understanding of the impact of
climate change on the Arctic. It has also played an important role in
supporting a greater awareness of the northern Indigenous Peoples in the
region. [And perhaps most importantly, it has served as the principal
means of promoting a peaceful and harmonious international regime of
cooperation.]{.underline}

All of this is now at risk. Perhaps **[Trump]{.underline}** [won't think
that the Arctic Council is worth his attention, and it can **somehow
remain** under the **American radar** until the next **presidential
election**]{.underline}. But as many have said in the past, **[hope is
not a strategy]{.underline}**.

The need for increased council activity

[Norway's chairship]{.underline} in 2023-2025 [has managed to balance
the situation and keep the **council alive** by **gradually ramping up
its activities**]{.underline}. [[For the **Danish**]{.mark},
**Greenlandic** and **Faroese** [chairship to be a **success**]{.mark},
[it would be]{.mark} wise to [continue]{.mark} on the **same path** with
steadily [**increasing activity** to ensure that the **council's pulse
continues to** bea]{.mark}t. However, the fact that [the
**threat**]{.mark} now both comes [from the **east** and the]{.mark}
**[west]{.mark}** [makes the **balancing act historically
difficult**]{.mark}**.**]{.underline}

One opportunity for increasing activity is to further enhance the focus
on the rights of Indigenous peoples in the Arctic -- which the new
chairship program, indeed, prioritizes -- in order to strengthen
regional cooperation without necessarily having to compromise on
condemning Russia. If the situation allows, something as ambitious as a
binding agreement on increased protection of Indigenous peoples' rights
in the Arctic would be worth striving for, similar to the council's
three existing agreements on aeronautical and maritime search and rescue
(2011), marine oil pollution preparedness and response (2013), and
enhancing international Arctic scientific cooperation (2017).

It may not sound like something Trump would want a stake in, but there
is a chance that the Arctic Council does not have his attention
whatsoever due to its limited activity -- and because there are plenty
of other things that keep him occupied. If that is the case, it may
actually prove to be an advantage for the Arctic Council, which under
normal circumstances would otherwise strengthen its relevance if
meetings were prioritized by the highest political level. However, its
current fragile existence and the crucial challenges make increased
activity and regional consensus the overriding success criteria. In this
light, it may be beneficial if State Secretary Marco Rubio is not at the
table.

The chairship's level of ambition is therefore closely linked to how
relations with Russia in the east and the US in the west unfold in the
coming period, and here it is extra important that the other member
states stand together. Only in this way can we ensure that the Arctic
Council continues to exist so that regional environmental problems and
sustainable development are not overshadowed by military rumble and
great power competition.

Have Nuuk, Copenhagen and Tórshavn buried the hatchet?

Whereas Russia's role has been a ubiquitous topic in the Arctic
political discourse, the internal dynamics between Denmark, Greenland
and the Faroe Islands have also played a major role in the debate about
their common chairship.

Two topics have especially influenced this debate: First, there has been
disagreement between Tórshavn and Nuuk about whether the Faroe Islands'
self-characterization as 'an Arctic people' is an indirect attack on
Greenland's national identity and privileged negotiating position in the
Arctic. Second, Greenland has actively used the fact that Denmark's
status as an Arctic state depends on Greenland's geographical location
and membership of the Realm to expand its foreign policy room for
manoeuvre. With this in mind, Greenland's leading diplomats have long
worked for Greenland to be the lead dog in the joint delegation to the
Arctic Council.

Their work eventually resulted in a new agreement ensuring that the
Kingdom of Denmark's Arctic Ambassador is now the Greenlandic career
diplomat, Kenneth Høegh, who comes directly from a position as Head of
Greenland's representation in Washington D.C. During the two-year
chairship, Høegh will have offices in both Nuuk and Copenhagen, while he
will be chair of the eight national Senior Arctic Officials (SAO). The
Faroe Islands' Gunvør Balle is vice chair, while Denmark's Torsten
Kjølby Nielsen is the Kingdom of Denmark's national Senior Arctic
Official.

After many years of tug-of-war, it now seems that
**[[Denmark]{.underline}]{.mark}**, Greenland and the Faroe Islands have
buried the hatchet regarding the division of roles during the chairship,
with Greenland now occupying a very prominent role. [This is important
both in the short term -- where they [**must ensure** a
**successful**]{.mark} **[chairship]{.mark}** -- and in the long term,
where it is about the overarching mission of **[making sure that the
Arctic Council survives.]{.mark}**]{.underline}

Three reasons why the Arctic Council must survive

There are many good reasons why the Arctic Council should survive. Here
we will highlight three:

First, the involvement of Indigenous peoples as permanent participants
in the council is unique in an international context. They do not have
direct decision-making authority, but they are at the table and provide
input -- and are heard -- when decisions are made. If the Arctic Council
does not survive, this unique construct will fall apart, which will
create a major challenge for Arctic Indigenous peoples, who are unlikely
to gain the same kind of influence in another regional forum.

Second, the Arctic Council's working groups are a unique construct: Over
three decades, scientists and officials have accumulated knowledge that
has been incorporated into national administration and international
convention work. This work has thus helped to make the rest of the world
aware of the enormous climatic and environmental challenges that are
extraordinarily noticeable in the Arctic, well exemplified by the
average regional temperature increase which is about three times higher
than the global average. Thus, the scientific work under the auspices of
the Arctic Council is not only important for the region, but for the
globe at large. If the Arctic Council does not survive the current
crisis, these essential networks will likely collapse, and they cannot
be rebuilt overnight.

The third, and related, reason is that the Arctic states and the other
actors of the Council face major transboundary challenges that are best
solved jointly. Be it biodiversity issues, the spread of diseases and
environmental problems; the risk of the latter is only increasing in
step with the heightened activities in the region.

Our inevitable shared fate in the North

[At the moment]{.underline}, [[it is]{.mark}]{.underline} of course
politically and morally [[difficult to **cooperate** with
**Russia**]{.underline}, [while]{.underline}]{.mark} [the [Trump]{.mark}
administration's [**approach** to **Greenland**]{.mark}]{.underline} --
and the Arctic experiences from his first presidential term -- ​​[[provide
negative evidence]{.mark} of ​​what further consequences this could **have
for regional cooperation**.]{.underline}

[T[he Arctic Council is in a **historically difficult

Half of the Arctic

\"I think the working groups would still be alive and kicking. But [we
must acknowledge that [half of the]{.mark} [Arctic is Russian]{.mark},
[and the Arctic Council is a product of]{.mark} [the end of the Cold
War]{.mark} and is all **about circumpolar cooperation**]{.underline}.
[So, if that happens, the Arctic Council will be dead
letters\".]{.underline}

\"[Or it becomes something else, like the Barents cooperation, which has
become a Nordic cooperation now without Russia]{.underline},\" suggests
Solveig Rossebø.

But a great loss it would be still, so the Norwegian chairship is hard
at work to keep all eight states in the Council.

[[Even if the Arctic Council were to evaporate, the Arctic issues would
not go away and would still have to be solved.]{.underline}]{.mark}

\"The **[[Arctic cooperation would not be dead even if the Arctic
Council would be]{.underline}]{.mark}**,\" Rottem states.

But Østhagen believes [there are **three [major misconceptions]{.mark}**
[about]{.mark} **geopolitics in [the Arctic]{.mark}**]{.underline}:

The first is the [**[possibility of war]{.mark}** in the
Arctic]{.underline}. The second is that [[there are **unresolved
borders**]{.mark} in the Arctic [and]{.mark}]{.underline} that a
[[**resource race** is underway]{.underline}]{.mark}. The third is that
[[climate change is the]{.mark} **primary [catalyst]{.mark}** [for **all
changes** in the Arctic]{.mark} region]{.underline}.

"The [[reality is **much calmer**]{.underline}]{.mark}," Østhagen says.

"The Electron case illustrates well everything that can go wrong. But it
also shows why [[things]{.underline}]{.mark} usually [[dont go
wrong]{.underline}]{.mark}. [[There\'s]{.underline}]{.mark} a
**[[willingness to cooperate]{.underline}]{.mark}**,\" Svein Vigeland
Rottem says.

He is a senior researcher at FNI and studies cooperation in the Arctic.
Rottem and Østhagen do not agree that the Arctic is a powder keg and a
dangerous place, as recently stated by Lars Saunes, former head of the
Norwegian Navy, to Norwegian Broadcasting Corporation NRK.

**[Myth 1]{.underline}**: The [**possibility of war** in the
Arctic]{.underline}

Østhagen, addressing the misconception of imminent war in the Arctic,
explains that the [[conditions in the Arctic are]{.underline}]{.mark}
often [**more [stable]{.mark}** [and **transparent** than **many
assume**]{.mark}]{.underline}.

[[Conflict is not **easily triggered**]{.underline}]{.mark},
[[considering]{.underline}]{.mark} the [[**vast areas** and]{.mark}
**diverse [countries]{.mark}** [involved]{.mark}]{.underline}. Østhagen
emphasises the [enormity of the Arctic]{.underline}, which encompasses
eight countries, four million people, and extensive ocean areas. The
countries include Russia, the Nordic states, the USA, and Canada.

He notes that the significant Russian presence -- with almost half of
the Arctic landmass under Russian control -- influences perceptions of
geopolitics in the North.

Iver B. Neumann, a Russia researcher and director at the FNI, concurs
that the [Arctic]{.underline} is [less likely to witness armed conflict
than **other global locations**]{.underline}.

He believes the primary driver for military conflict in the Arctic is
Russia\'s use of Murmansk as a base for nuclear weapons.

"There are three main ways to keep such weapons mobile: in aircraft, on
land by rail, and at sea on submarines. Where such submarines exist, as
in Murmansk, there is also significant military attention. And where
there is military attention, there is also the potential for conflict,"
he says.

Neumann advises caution in responding to Russia\'s desire for global
attention and military control, stressing the importance of Norway
maintaining a cool head, enforcing sovereignty, and not succumbing to
intimidation.

**[Myth 2]{.underline}**: [Unresolved borders and]{.underline} a [race
for resources]{.underline}

As the Arctic becomes more accessible due to melting sea ice because of
climate change, a [**common myth** suggests]{.underline} a [**scramble
for resources** and land in the North]{.underline} will
[occur]{.underline}.

But Østhagen clarifies that, unlike in other parts of the world, [[there
are]{.underline}]{.mark} almost [[**no disputes** over]{.mark} Arctic
[borders]{.mark}]{.underline}.

"[[All]{.mark} the **borders [are settled]{.mark}**]{.underline}," he
says, noting that the last conflict between Canada and Greenland was
resolved in 2022.

Maritime boundaries are key for resource management and potential
conflict. [[Law of the sea grants]{.mark} coastal [states **sovereign
rights** for **resource**]{.mark} **exploitation** [in their]{.mark}
**economic [zones]{.mark}**]{.underline}.

In the Arctic, only one maritime boundary remains unresolve. It is
between the USA and Canada -- two close allies.

Østhagen, who wrote his PhD on maritime disputes, [[foresees no]{.mark}
**major [concerns]{.mark}** [regarding sovereignty or
territori]{.mark}al issues]{.underline}. He believes the myth persists
due to historical reasons but emphasises that, with all the land borders
settled and just one disputed sea border, Arctic resources are already
distributed among the eight Arctic states.

**[Myth 3]{.underline}**: [[Climate change drives]{.mark} **all
[shifts]{.mark}** in the Arctic]{.underline}

A third myth suggests that [climate change]{.underline} is [the **main
driver** for **all political shifts** in the Arctic]{.underline}.

But Østhagen cautions against [[**oversimplifying** the
issue]{.underline}]{.mark}, noting that while climate change does affect
fish migration -- leading to potential future conflicts around
resource-rich areas like Svalbard -- it\'s important to be specific
about which aspects of climate change increase conflict risks.

### AT: Net Benefit\-\--No Arctic War\-\--1AR

#### No [escalation]{.underline} in the Arctic.

Tomáš **Vlček et al. 24**. Ph.D.; Associate Professor in the Department

Conflict Potential in the Arctic." Europe-Asia Studies, Volume 76, Issue
3.

Thus, while the research clearly shows a rise in conflict potential,
critically, the rivalry factor has not increased. In other words,
[[**none of the actors** in the]{.underline}]{.mark} examined [region
[has an **interest** in **escalating**]{.mark} **confrontational
behaviour**]{.underline}. While the military presence is growing in the
Arctic, this growth has not diverged drastically from the previous
trend. Even on the worsened geopolitical playing field after February
2022, [[**communication channels** have not been
interrupted]{.underline}]{.mark}, [and]{.underline} the [[rivalry
indicators **clearly show** cooperative behaviour]{.mark}
among]{.underline} the [actors]{.underline}, [including **indications of
efforts** to **continue in this manner**]{.underline}.

Since 2014, defence spending has risen. [[There have been]{.mark}
**frequent [rhetorical confrontations]{.mark}**]{.underline}, and the
undisputable military build-up by Russia and the other Arctic states has
increased. Overall, international tensions have risen.
[[Nevertheless]{.underline}]{.mark}, the [[actors]{.mark} in the Arctic
have [show]{.mark}n **stability and [adherence]{.mark}** [to]{.mark} the
regime of **[regional]{.mark} cooperation [institutions]{.mark}** and
treaties]{.underline}. On the other hand, one might argue that increased
militarisation, which takes the most time of all factors and requires
the most investment to change, may indicate that the other factors in
STWM could also change easily and quickly. This is confirmed by a rapid
change in coalition-building after February 2022. However, the evidence
so far leaves the **[non-escalating rivalry factor]{.underline}** as
[[a]{.mark} **highly relevant [counterbalance]{.mark}** [to]{.mark}
**increased [militarisation]{.mark}**]{.underline} and negative trends
in coalition-building. In short, the [rivalry factor is **strong
enough** to offset and]{.underline} even [**detract** from]{.underline}
the [tensions caused by developments in militarisation]{.underline} and
coalition-building.

Placing this research within a larger international context, the
prioritisation of the Arctic among the key players has decreased at the
expense of developments in Eastern Europe and the world energy crisis.
The [**enduring world economic crisis** in the wake of the
**[COVID]{.mark}-19 pandemic** [and]{.mark}]{.underline} the [**invasion
of [Ukraine]{.mark}** [reduces]{.mark}]{.underline} the [[desire
for]{.underline}]{.mark} an [**[escalation]{.mark} of another conflict**
[in the Arctic]{.mark}]{.underline}. It is thus expected that the
[Arctic countries will adhere to non-confrontational
behaviour]{.underline}. It is also [questionable whether]{.underline}
these [countries can sustain their planned **Arctic-specific military
spending** under the **current economic situation** and **more pressing
issues** elsewhere on the international scene]{.underline}. Hence, all
these [phenomena further support the idea]{.underline} that the [rivalry
factor will **continue to support** non-escalation]{.underline} in the
region.

The evidence also reveals Russian activities as the catalyst of recent
military developments, and that confrontational behaviour in the
military dimension pits Russia against the other seven Arctic countries.
In this regard, further research as to if and under what conditions the
Arctic could be a future sphere of new Russian military activities would
be valuable. Russian interests in the Arctic, its military developments
after 2014, and the actual reasons for these activities are key topics
for further debate. Yet, despite the clearly increased tensions between
Russia and the West since 2014, [[we have seen **persistent rhetoric**
underlining **coop**]{.mark}**eration** [and]{.mark} **joint [dispute
settlement]{.mark}** in the High North and agendas setting cooperative
goals]{.underline} for respective coalitions. Thus, the [coalition
regime under which cooperation in the Arctic takes place **appears
stable**]{.underline} for the time being.

[Most of America's **historic foreign policy blunders** were driven by
**threat inflation**]{.underline}. [From]{.underline} **[fake attacks on

Tonkin]{.underline}**, [to]{.underline} **[falling
dominos]{.underline}** [in Southeast Asia and **WMD in
Iraq**]{.underline} --- [the response to these "dire threats" is often a
**costly quagmire**]{.underline}. [In the Cold War it was phony bomber
and missile "gaps" that sparked a]{.underline} precarious and ultimately
[pointless nuclear confrontation. Today a new "icebreaker gap" could
fuel [an **Arctic arms race. For over a
decade**]{.mark}]{.underline}[,]{.mark} **[defense
[hawks]{.mark}]{.underline}** [[have been **sounding the
alarm**]{.underline} [about Russia's]{.underline}]{.mark} [supposed
**"militarization"** and [**"dominance"** of the
Arctic]{.mark}]{.underline}. [More recently,]{.underline}
[**[China]{.underline}** [has joined the list]{.underline}]{.mark} [[of
**"aggressors"**]{.mark} allegedly]{.underline} threatening vital
Western economic and strategic interests in the High North. The Obama
administration resisted calls for a major Arctic buildup coming from a
mix of armchair analysts, defense contractors, and special political
interests. Notably, the U.S. Navy has never joined this chorus. Nobody
denies the need for some new heavy icebreakers to buttress an aging
fleet, but these are for Coast Guard missions --- not the remote
warfighting scenarios hyped by Arctic hawks. **[Theirs is [classic
threat inflation]{.mark}]{.underline}**[, [built]{.underline}]{.mark}
[[on]{.mark} equal parts [**exaggeration** and]{.mark}]{.underline}
[**[ignorance]{.underline}**]{.mark}, [that makes it irresistible to a
Trump administration happy to overturn yet another Obama
legacy]{.underline}. And so, with a recent series of provocative words
and deeds, America's Arctic policy has taken an abruptly belligerent
turn. This is another historic mistake, not only because it could lead
to costly and dangerous confrontation in an extremely fragile region,
but because **[[its entire premise is false]{.underline}]{.mark}**. Once
a superpower rival in the High North, [Russia's Arctic presence imploded
after the Cold War leaving America and its NATO allies militarily
dominant]{.underline}. [Retreating from rivalry, Russia joined other
regional states in a new Arctic Council that has proved a model of
shared global governance, fostering cooperation in areas from
environmental protection and search and rescue to commercial shipping
and fisheries.]{.underline} Importantly, [[Arctic Council members
agreed]{.underline}]{.mark} over a decade ago [[to settle any]{.mark}
territorial [disputes through the]{.mark}]{.underline} United Nations
Convention on the **[[Law of the Sea]{.underline}]{.mark}**
[framework]{.underline} --- **[[and have]{.mark} scrupulously [kept to
that]{.mark} agreement]{.underline}**. [[It is **simply false** that
**Russia threatens**]{.mark} to seize the North Pole seabed or other
[Arctic territory, or that China]{.mark}]{.underline}, a nonvoting
observer at the Arctic Council, [[threatens]{.mark} to undermine the
independence of regional states [through its]{.mark} so-called "[Polar
