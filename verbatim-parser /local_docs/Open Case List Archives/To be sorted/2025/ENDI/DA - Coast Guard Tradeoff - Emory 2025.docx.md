### Coast Guard Tradeoff DA\-\--1NC

#### The Coast Guard is [prioritizing]{.underline} Indo-Pacific security now. Their [focus]{.underline} is key to [prevent]{.underline} escalation of territorial disputes with China.

Coast Guard: How to Compete in the South China Sea.\" Harvard

[The South China Sea is the **linchpin** of **modern Indo-Pacific
relations**]{.underline}. [As [the]{.mark}]{.underline}
[[U]{.underline}]{.mark}nited [[S]{.underline}]{.mark}tates [[and
China]{.underline} [remain]{.underline}]{.mark} [[locked in]{.mark} a
**[Great Power Competition]{.mark}**]{.underline}, [regional
[autonomy]{.mark}]{.underline} [in the **South China Sea**]{.underline}
[[has become a]{.mark} **[symbolic line]{.mark}** in the
**sand**]{.underline}---[one which [**China** is]{.mark} **[determined
to cross]{.mark}** and the **U**nited **S**tates is **set on
protecting**]{.underline}. For both nations, [[the]{.mark} US **[Coast
Guard]{.mark}**]{.underline}---often an afterthought---[[has become
**central** to **avoiding**]{.mark} **[escalation]{.mark}** while
achieving strategic goals and projecting power.]{.underline}

[The US Coast Guard [occupies a **liminal space** between **military**
and **humanitarian**]{.mark} **[force]{.mark}**]{.underline} [that
allows it to play a [**unique role** in]{.mark} **US [diplomatic
efforts]{.mark}**]{.underline}[,]{.mark} [particularly in the
Indo-Pacific]{.underline}---an area comprising 74 million square miles
of ocean and over 70 states. US Coast Guard crews train local partners
and help patrol territorial waters, playing key roles in projecting US
power during peacetime. The US Coast Guard is billed as a diplomatic
force for cultural exchange: a commendation for the US Coast Guard
Cutter (USCGC) Frederick Hatch recognizes the crew for their outreach in
local communities---often through forms of casual interaction that a
more militarized force might not be able to achieve.

This defanged depiction of [the US Coast Guard]{.underline}
[is]{.underline} often [contrasted against]{.underline} that of
[the]{.underline} [Chinese Coast Guard]{.underline}, [which has grown
increasingly militarized]{.underline} in recent years. Notably, China
deploys former Navy vessels under the aegis of its Coast Guard.

The United States is also leaning more heavily on its Coast Guard: the
Pacific Area Commander, Vice Admiral Andrew J. Tiongson, announced on
September 27, 2024 that the US Coast Guard is doubling the number of
fast response cutters based in Guam, from three to six. Tiongson
justified the branch as "a non-escalatory resource," highlighting how
the US Coast Guard can protect a "rules-based order."

This increased emphasis on operations in the Pacific is limited:
Tiongson assured reporters that US Coast Guard ships would not be
escorting Philippine Coast Guard vessels to disputed shoals, where
conflicts have sparked in the past. Still, the US Coast Guard has been
increasing operations and partnerships in the South China Sea. In
August, the USCGC Waesche returned from a patrol in the Indo-Pacific
region that saw joint exercises with Japan, Korea, and the Philippines.
"[We strive to preserve a free and open Indo-Pacific]{.underline}," said
the commanding officer of the Waesche, Capt. Tyson Scofield.

This objective---and wording---is shared across branches of the
government. In April 2024, the White House published a "Joint Vision
Statement from the Leaders of Japan, the Philippines, and the United
States." The document opens with a commitment to "a free and open
Indo-Pacific and international order based on international law." At the
same time, the spokespeople affirm that they "steadfastly oppose the
dangerous and coercive use of Coast Guard and maritime militia vessels
in the South China Sea." As US and Chinese Coast Guards operate in
increasingly close quarters, this juxtaposition reveals the major
question of international maritime policy: when are Coast Guard
operations justified?

In many ways, [it is **safer** for the **U**nited
**S**tates]{.underline} or China to [**deploy Coast Guard** **ships**
to]{.underline} [the region]{.underline}: [[Coast Guard
operations]{.mark} [are **less threatening**]{.mark}]{.underline}
**[[than]{.underline}]{.mark}**, for example, [**[Naval
exercises]{.underline}**.]{.mark} [[Coast Guard ships]{.mark} are
**[less militarized]{.mark}**]{.underline}, [[and]{.mark} [their
**mandate**]{.mark} [is **limited**]{.mark}.]{.underline} On the other
hand, the mission of any Coast Guard is law enforcement. In a region
where laws themselves are in dispute, competing Coast Guards operating
in close proximity and enforcing conflicting laws is a dangerous status
quo.

Last May, the Chinese Coast Guard announced a new policy allowing
"commanders to detain foreign vessels and persons in 'waters under
China's jurisdiction' for up to 60 days." This release was seemingly
timed to coincide with a Philippine convoy to resupply another disputed
island, the Scarborough Shoal. International observers including the
United States and United Nations recognize the Scarborough Shoal as
belonging to the Exclusive Economic Zone of the Philippines. Other
regions within China's territorial claims fall within the UN-recognized
Exclusive Economic Zones of Brunei, Indonesia, Malaysia, the
Philippines, and Vietnam.

US partners in the Indo-Pacific have taken measures to protect
themselves from territorial threats. A 2023 agreement between the United
States and the Philippines warned that "an armed attack in the Pacific,
to include anywhere in the South China Sea, on either Philippine or US
armed forces---which includes both nations' Coast Guards---aircraft, or
public vessels, would invoke mutual defense commitments."

These dual announcements from China and the Philippines demonstrate the
brinkmanship that constantly plays out in the Indo-Pacific, and
specifically through respective nations' Coast Guard forces. [**[Should
US forces]{.underline}**,]{.mark} [supporting US allies and
**functioning** under **international law,**]{.underline} [[clash with
**Chinese**]{.mark} **Coast Guard** [forces]{.mark},]{.underline}
[functioning under **Chinese law** and newly empowered to detain foreign
ships, [any **conflict** could **be disastrous**]{.mark}]{.underline}.

game.**]{.underline}]{.mark}

A Better Way to Think About Arctic Defense

[As [the U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates [approaches]{.mark} the
potential of **competition** **extending to [the]{.mark}
[Arctic]{.mark}**]{.underline}, [[it]{.underline}]{.mark}
[[should]{.mark} place the region in a broader geopolitical
context]{.underline}, consider a broader set of tools to advance U.S.
interests, [and carefully [weigh]{.mark} the [**opportunity costs** of
pushing the]{.mark} **[Coast Guard]{.mark}** to **take on a central
role** in **regional competition**.]{.underline}

[The best way to deal with China and Russia in the Arctic is to address
disputes in their own backyards]{.underline}. Most of the pathways to a
great-power crisis that could end up affecting the Arctic stem from
crises outside the region. [[Engaging]{.underline}]{.mark} Russia and
[[China]{.underline}]{.mark} [[elsewhere]{.mark} [rather than focusing
on]{.mark} **specific capabilities** in [the **Arctic**]{.mark},
[including **icebreakers**]{.mark}, [will]{.mark} thus [have **salutary
effects**]{.mark}]{.underline}[.]{.mark} [The nominal Defense
Department]{.underline} [approach is to enhance a]{.underline}
combat-credible forward [presence in]{.underline} Eastern Europe and
**[the Indo-Pacific]{.underline}**. [[By **deterring** a **conflict
there**]{.mark}, the logic goes, [the Arctic is less likely to suffer
negative "**strategic spillover**]{.mark}."]{.underline} [[A fixation
with the]{.mark} [**number** of **icebreakers**]{.mark}, or]{.underline}
ice-hardened vessels more generally, [[as part of competing with]{.mark}
[Russia]{.mark} or China in the Arctic [can lead to **unnecessary
investments** and **divert** military **assets better utilized
elsewhere**]{.mark}.]{.underline} Alternative approaches might focus on
some form of grand bargain or a more restrained U.S. foreign policy to
alleviate tensions. The hope of this approach is that it might broadly
reduce competition. That would then also have benefits for the Arctic.

#### US-China war goes nuclear.

How to Defuse the Emerging U.S.-China Rivalry." \"The U.S. and China

[The disparity between U.S. and Chinese nuclear arsenals has indeed led
China to]{.underline} [build more **nuclear weapons**]{.underline} and
even construct an enormous military headquarters near Beijing that will
be 10 times the size of the Pentagon, complete with deep underground
units built to withstand nuclear strikes. Despite Beijing\'s anxiety,
Trump has some realistic options to defuse the nuclear rivalry.

[[Could a **flare-up** over **Taiwan**]{.underline}]{.mark},
[[or]{.mark} even [some **disputed reef** in the]{.mark}
**[S]{.mark}outh [C]{.mark}hina [S]{.mark}ea,**]{.underline}
**[[escalate into a nuclear war?]{.underline}]{.mark}** Unfortunately,
[the **answer is [yes]{.mark}**]{.underline}, [[and]{.mark} the
[prospects for]{.mark} such a [**war** are
**increasing**.]{.mark}]{.underline}

[**China\'s regional ambitions** and its rapid nuclear weapons buildup
are partly to blame. But so are myriad U.S. **foreign policy** and
**defense signals**.]{.underline}

The U.S. Department of Defense\'s annual report on Chinese military
power, which came out back in December, says that the Chinese already
had 600 operational nuclear warheads and are \"on track to exceed
previous projections.\" China is busy filling out 320 new silos,
including with multi-megaton intercontinental ballistic missiles.
Chinese navy submarines are apparently capable of hitting American
targets from launch \"bastions\" off the China coast. Most troubling is
that China is likely developing \"low-yield weapons\" so that it has
options in a limited nuclear war.

During a trip to China in 2023, I asked a group of Chinese nuclear
strategists if Beijing was studying \"limited nuclear war,\" and they
answered with surprising candor in the affirmative. When asked why, they
answered, \"You Americans are talking about it, so we must study it
too.\"

Given all the ink spilled in Washington over the putative \"China
threat\" over the last two decades, it\'s not surprising that China is
determined to build up its nuclear arsenal. Chinese strategists
certainly took notice when the novel \"2034\" was published a few years
ago by an influential retired U.S. military leader that depicts a
U.S.-China war that ends with a nuclear exchange.

A leading Chinese nuclear strategist, Hu Gaochen, wrote an influential
article in 2021, explaining that Beijing needs to counter Washington\'s
\"strategic opportunism\" by undertaking a substantial nuclear forces
buildup.

Unfortunately, equally grave and perhaps even more bellicose signals
have been issuing from Washington in the last few years. In a 2023
report for the Atlantic Council, political scientist Matthew Kroenig
stated that due to growing Chinese conventional superiority across the
Taiwan Strait, \"the United States might choose to use nuclear weapons
against the Chinese invasion force.\"

In the same piece, Kroenig called for \"formally extending the U.S.
nuclear umbrella over Taiwan\" and even suggested the U.S. might have to
target parts of Taiwan itself with nuclear weapons in the event of a
conflict.

Another report from the same Washington think tank made the newly
fashionable case for the need to prepare for nuclear war in the Taiwan
Strait. Notably, this analysis was careful to suggest that China was
more likely to resort to nuclear first use in a Taiwan scenario \"if
China\'s leadership believes there is a marked asymmetry of stakes
favoring China.\"

Putting aside the reality that the Chinese care more about Taiwan than
Americans ever will, the author, Greg Weaver, former principal adviser
to the Joint Chiefs on nuclear strategy issues, brazenly asserts:
\"Taiwan is not Ukraine. \... The U.S. and allied stake in the outcome
of a Taiwan conflict is high enough for them to risk nuclear escalation
and high enough to persevere through limited nuclear exchanges.\" Weaver
says that Chinese landing forces could form \"the best possible
conventional force target for nuclear attack\" and seems all too
oblivious to the escalation risks of such a step.

A mid-2024 wargame report by the influential Center for New American
Security kept this momentum going by calling for a buildup of \"theater
nuclear capabilities, stating that \"To avoid a general nuclear war,
U.S. leaders may need to create substantial escalatory pressures to
manage the conflict.\". The study agrees with the Weaver analysis in
suggesting that the Western Pacific had geography amenable to the use of
tactical nuclear weapons with \"little collateral damage.\" However, it
at least soberly notes that \"multiple Blue \[i.e. Western\] players
voiced their view that U.S. interests in Taiwan were not worth the risk
of an in-kind \[nuclear\] response.\"

[It is plain that [nuclear tensions]{.mark} [are rising]{.mark} in the
U.S.-China relationship]{.underline}, [[and easing]{.mark} these
[**tensions** will not be **easy**]{.mark}.]{.underline} Right now,
[**[hawkish rhetoric]{.mark}** from Washington is [making the
**situation worse**]{.mark}]{.underline}. Even as leaders in the
Asia-Pacific consider the viability of Washington\'s \"nuclear
umbrella\" going forward, the focus should still continue to be on
lowering nuclear risks in the most volatile scenarios, including
especially pertaining to Taiwan.

Here are a couple of near-term and hopefully more sober recommendations
to ease nuclear tensions. First, the U.S. side, which still has vast
numerical and qualitative nuclear superiority, should get the ball
rolling by adopting a no-first-use policy and returning to a strict
interpretation of the One China policy. Concerning Taiwan, the effort to
reach a compromise suffered another setback recently when the State
Department in February altered more cautious language, regrettably. [If
Washington could take such steps to **mitigate rivalry**]{.underline},
[Beijing could then reciprocate such]{.underline} [**conciliatory**
steps by scaling back its **pattern** of **military exercises** near
Taiwan.]{.underline}

In addition, both sides should agree to an annual three-day bilateral
summit to discuss the all-important nuclear issue. [[Any chance of
**nuclear war**]{.mark} [must be reined in]{.mark} as [we **stand** at
the **precipice of disaster**.]{.mark}]{.underline}

### Uniqueness\-\--Indo-Pacific Focus Now\-\--2NC/1NR

#### The Coast Guard is shifting focus to the Pacific now.

\"US Coast Guard infrastructure is quietly crumbling. It needs at least
\$7 billion to fix it..\" Business Insider. 3-7-2025.

[[Coast Guard operations are focused **largely** on **maritime law
enforcement**]{.underline}]{.mark}, including protecting commercial
shipping interests and maritime safety, US port security, and conducting
thousands of search and rescue operations for which it never charges.

The service spends much of its time working drug interdiction missions,
regularly snagging tens of millions of dollars worth of illegal
narcotics, often in or near US waters.

Trump and his top officials have repeatedly said that their top
priorities are stopping migrants and drug smuggling, especially the
synthetic opioid fentanyl. Operations at sea that rely on the Coast
Guard play an important role in that. A day after Trump took office, an
acting DHS official fired the Coast Guard\'s top admiral.

It also conducts important operations abroad.

[[As **DoD** has **pivoted** to **focus on the Pacific**]{.underline},
[so **too has the Coast Guard**,]{.underline}]{.mark}
[**[stretching]{.mark}** [its **resources** and **personnel
further**]{.mark}]{.underline} [[to **units in
Asia**]{.underline}]{.mark}, while [also [maintaining]{.mark} its
**[presence elsewhere]{.mark}**, [including]{.mark} operations in global
hot-spot regions and in [challenging waters to the
north.]{.mark}]{.underline}

[Much of the service\'s infrastructure]{.underline} --- including
ammunition storage facilities, piers, and communications towers ---
[is]{.underline} well past its life expectancy, according to the GAO
report, and [overdue for replacement.]{.underline}

The service receives an annual budget of roughly \$13.8 billion, making
backlogs difficult to address, especially given that the problem may be
even worse.

The \$7 billion price tag for the much-needed infrastructure
improvements is likely too low an estimate, the report said, since the
service has either not created cost estimates for some projects or has
not updated cost estimates to account for inflation.

#### It's their top [operational]{.underline} priority.

[[The **Indo-Pacific**]{.mark}: Expanding Influence or Lost
Ground?]{.underline}

[The [new **Operational Posture**]{.mark} [document **identifies the
Indo-Pacific as the Coast** **Guard's**]{.mark}]{.underline} [**[top
priority]{.underline}**]{.mark}, highlighting a shift toward a "target
and interdict" strategy. [The strategic repositioning goes beyond
addressing fishing violations or smuggling---it's about **upholding** an
**international maritime** order **under direct
challenge**]{.underline}. The Coast Guard is deploying National Security
Cutters, Fast Response Cutters, and an advanced logistics enterprise to
this contested region. [There, [it will serve as a
bulwark]{.mark}]{.underline} [[against illegal]{.underline}]{.mark},
unreported, and unregulated [[fishing]{.underline}]{.mark} (IUUF),
[while also pursuing a broader mandate: preserving open sea lanes
[and]{.mark} regional stability in the face of **[increasing Chinese
assertiveness]{.mark}**.]{.underline}

The problem is, despite the pivot to the Pacific being first announced
during the Obama administration, the current Biden-Harris administration
hasn't seemed to receive the memo. Instead, they're focusing
increasingly on tensions in Ukraine and the Middle East.

[[The real challenge lies in sustaining]{.mark} [this]{.mark} expanded
[mission set]{.mark} [with limited White]{.mark} [**House focus** on
**Pacific tensions**]{.mark}]{.underline}. Even if Congress approves an
additional \$6 billion annual increase, keeping pace with China---which
operates a much larger Coast Guard fleet and a Maritime Militia---in one
of the world's busiest and most contested maritime regions demands more
than mere budget adjustments. [[The **Coast Guard**]{.mark} [must ramp
up its]{.mark} operational **[tempo]{.mark}**, [**support**, and
**coordination with allies**]{.mark}]{.underline}. This isn't simply
about extending a hand to regional partners---it's about forging an
agile network of maritime actors to counterbalance a high-stakes
geopolitical chess game.

#### The Coast Guard is shifting to the Indo-Pacific

Gabriel **Dominguez 24**. Senior journalist covering international
defense and geopolitical issues. \"With ramped-up activities, U.S. Coast
Guard plots greater Indo-Pacific role.\" Japan Times. 10-23-2024.

[[The]{.mark} U.S. [Coast Guard]{.mark}]{.underline} [[is set to **ramp
up its activities** with **Indo-Pacific**]{.mark} **[partners]{.mark}**
as it]{.underline} [plans more **combined operations** at
**sea**]{.underline}, including a pollution response exercise next year
alongside the Japanese and Indian coast guards, the agency\'s regional
chief said in an exclusive interview.

The trilateral drills will take place at Tokyo\'s request, USCG Pacific
Area Commander Vice Adm. Andrew Tiongson told The Japan Times, noting
that this and other regional, cooperative initiatives are the result of
"near-continuous staff talks between the services.\"

"The U.S. and Japan continue to seek opportunities to deepen our
services' relationship through collaboration on combined operations and
exercises, professional and academic exchanges, training, and capacity
building," Tiongson said, pointing to the 2022 Sapphire memorandum of
cooperation as the basis for expanding the joint activities.

But the growing cooperation won't be limited to other coast guards.

This month, for instance, the USCG will participate in a joint maritime
assault exercise with the Maritime Self-Defense Force's Special Boarding
Unit, the Canadian Special Operation Forces, and U.S. Navy Special
Warfare personnel as part of Exercise Keen Sword. During that exercise,
the USCG and others will train in boarding, searching and seizing
vessels.

No details were provided about other combined at-sea operations, but the
vice admiral made it clear that there are currently "no planned group
sails" near the disputed Senkaku Islands, which are administered by
Japan but also claimed by China.

Tiongson's remarks come at a time when a growing number of Indo-Pacific
coast guards are becoming deeply involved in patrolling disputed waters.

Sovereignty over the Senkakus has for years been a major bone of
contention between Tokyo and Beijing, with the China Coast Guard (CCG)
now keeping an almost continuous maritime presence around the
uninhabited islets.

This, in turn, has prompted Japan to boost its own coast guard
capabilities.

The CCG, the world's largest, has also been active around Taiwan,
operating near Taiwanese-controlled Kinmen Island and also taking part
in the Chinese military's large-scale exercises on Oct. 14 by conducting
what Beijing said were "law enforcement inspections" around the
self-ruled island.

Beijing\'s activities around disputed waters with the Philippines in the
South China Sea have also made international headlines, as the CCG has
aimed to prevent resupply missions to isolated features, including to a
garrison at Second Thomas Shoal.

Tiongson said that while the USCG has been "advising and assisting"
Manila in these missions, it has not been asked to provide escorts in
order "not to overly escalate the situation."

[[Experts]{.mark} [say]{.mark} the [growing]{.mark} [use of "gray-zone"
tactics]{.mark} by some states [make coast guards]{.mark} [an important
tool]{.mark} for nations to protect **maritime resources** without
having to deploy their **armed forces**]{.underline}. As a result[,
**[coast guards]{.mark}** have been [playing a key role in the]{.mark}
**[intensifying territorial]{.mark}** and **maritime [disputes]{.mark}**
in the East and South China seas, with their vessels often used to
either defend or promote territorial claims.]{.underline}

Tiongson hinted that the USCG, which has yet to experience any
unprofessional encounters with the CCG, would defer to U.S. regional
naval commanders on politically sensitive operations, saying that USCG
cutters "primarily operate under the tactical control of DESRON
(Destroyer Squadron) 15 when in the region, and leverage the same
services provided to U.S. naval vessels."

Tiongson made the remarks after he visited Japan late last month to,
among other things, look for places from which the coast guard can
routinely conduct forward operations. In particular, these are locations
that can serve as logistics hubs, as the USCG looks to expand its
Indo-Pacific footprint.

The commander stressed, however, that there are currently "no plans to
homeport" USCG cutters in Japan.

The coast guard has frequented ports in Japan during routine visits and
"plans to continue to do so, primarily within the U.S. Navy facilities
enclave, for crew rest, refueling, replenishment, and professional
engagements," Tiongson said, noting that cutters "operate all across the
region" and have visited various ports in Japan, including Yokosuka and
Maizuru.

[[The **USCG**]{.mark} already [has a **large regional
footprint**]{.mark}]{.underline}, [particularly in the **Pacific
Ocean**]{.underline}, not just because of Hawaii and the U.S. territory
of Guam, but also due to law enforcement pacts it has signed with
several Pacific island nations. This includes the Shiprider program,
which allows it to obtain a country's consent to board and search
vessels suspected of illicit activities in that nation's exclusive
economic zone.

Plans to use additional forward-deployment locations in Japan, and
possibly also in Australia, are expected to further expand the USCG's
capacity to find "regional responses" to its growing list of challenges.

To achieve this, Tiongson said the law enforcement agency is also aiming
to increase the size of its Pacific fleet.

"[[Three additional]{.mark} **fast-response [cutters]{.mark}** are
expected to be homeported in Guam in addition to an additional
Indo-Pacific **support cutter** that will help assist partner nations
with **capacity building** and combating illegal, unreported and
unregulated fishing in the region,"]{.underline} he said.

John **[[Bradford]{.underline}]{.mark}**, founder and executive director
of the Yokosuka Council on Asia Pacific Studies, [[said that in]{.mark}
[doing so the U.S. is **seeking to expand** the use of its **coast
guard** as an "**element of statecraft** in the
**Indo-Pacific**."]{.mark}]{.underline}

"Bringing ships to ports further west in the Indo-Pacific reduces the
travel time to engagements, thus increasing the productivity of each
ship and crew," said Bradford, who is also a former country director for
Japan at the Office of the U.S. Secretary of Defense.

"[This is thus a practical step that [enables the **USCG** to **do more
in the region**]{.mark} while also serving as a **powerful diplomatic
tool** to **demonstrate commitment**."]{.underline}

The unreliability of the acquisition timetable was made even more acute
by significant omissions from the Coast Guard's Fiscal Year 2013 budget
request, most notably, the failure to request any funding for the final
two National Security Cutters, or to account for future out-year
requests to build [[a **new polar** **class

were first reported in 2017. Initially, [[nuclear]{.underline}]{.mark}
or LNG [[**propulsion systems** were **considered**]{.mark} for the
series]{.underline}. [[However]{.underline}]{.mark}, [**[nuclear
icebreakers]{.underline}**,]{.mark} which [would [**cost** about **twice
as much as non-nuclear ones**]{.mark}]{.underline}, [were ruled out as
there were no prospects for government funding,]{.underline} and the
company opted for dual-fuel vessels that could run on LNG and diesel,
the paper said. Rosatom division Atomflot ordered an Aker ARC 123 basic
design from Finland\'s Aker Arctic in 2017. Subsequently, the company
abandoned the duel-fuel concept, as Russia does not make engines that
run on LNG, and decided to go with just a diesel option.

[The problem for the Coast Guard isn't **just the wall**]{.underline},
Cancian said, [but the **spending caps** Congress operates
under.]{.underline}

"[**[Congress can't just add money]{.mark}**; [they **have to find
offsets**]{.mark}]{.underline}," Cancian said.

In the meantime, [[the Coast Guard is]{.underline}]{.mark} restricted to
operating under last year's spending levels and [**[barred]{.mark}**
[from **paying** to **start new programs**]{.mark}]{.underline}. If
Congress were to ultimately pass a year-long continuing resolution for
DHS, Cancian still thinks the Coast Guard is in good shape to start
building an icebreaker.

[[There could]{.mark} be some [**wheeling** and dealin]{.mark}g, [where
the Coast Guard agrees to shelve]{.mark} [other **programs** and
**divert the money** to **building an icebreaker**]{.mark}]{.underline},
he said. Or Congress could approve a plan to only pay for part of the
\$750 million cost in FY 2019, leaving the rest for following fiscal
years.

The problem is if the **[Coast Guard]{.underline}** budget is severely
cut, then **[[leadership]{.underline}]{.mark}** [[will have to **make
some hard choices.**]{.underline}]{.mark}

"If you lost top line and wanted to keep it, you'd have to gut so many
other programs which would be so disruptive," Cancian said. "It's much
easier to hold a program instead of disrupting 12."

The Coast Guard Faces Asset and Infrastructure Challenges That May
Affect Its Ability to Carry Out Arctic Operations and Meet Strategic
Commitments

[[The Coast Guard has]{.mark} **[multiple strategic
commitments]{.mark}** for **operations** [in the]{.mark} U.S.
**[Arctic]{.mark} region**]{.underline} [but [has been **unable** to
**meet all of them**]{.mark} in recent years for various
reasons.\[13\]]{.underline} According to the Coast Guard, [[these
include]{.mark} asset availability]{.underline}
[challenges]{.underline}, [such as a lack of **reserve major
cutters**]{.underline}, [and competing [demands for major cutters in
**other areas** such as the **Indo-Pacific
region**]{.mark}]{.underline}, among other factors.\[14\] Further,
[limited **infrastructure**]{.underline} [and logistics **capabilities**

Efforts to address these challenges in the long term via major
**[[acquisitions]{.underline}]{.mark}**, [[such as the **Polar
Security**]{.mark} **[Cutter]{.mark}** program, continue to
[face]{.mark} **significant [delays]{.mark}**]{.underline}. This program
also faces a pending cost increase that puts pressure on the Coast
Guard's resource-constrained acquisition budget. At the same time, the
Coast Guard has a backlog of shore infrastructure projects that is
contributing to affordability concerns for recapitalization and related
efforts to sustain existing and planned assets. Collectively, [these
factors will continue to [limit the]{.mark} [operational
**availability**]{.mark} of [**Coast Guard assets** in the **Arctic

meet its Arctic strategy goals and conduct planning efforts to address

Recommendation Moving Forward

[**Effectively** [combating **Chinese**]{.mark}]{.underline} and Russian
[[expansionism]{.mark} [in]{.mark}]{.underline} Africa and [[the South
China Sea]{.underline} [requires]{.underline}]{.mark} [a globally

[offers a wide range of]{.underline} nonmilitary
[capabilities]{.underline} typically employed domestically, [such as
disaster prevention and response, **marine safety**, and **fisheries
enforcement**.]{.underline} Coupled with the Coast Guard's strong
history of interagency and private-sector collaboration, these
competencies could be employed to help strengthen relationships with
nations subject to Chinese and Russian influence in a less-threatening
and more nuanced way than may be possible through other DOD resources
alone. This **[[expansion]{.underline}]{.mark}**, however, [[may come at
a cost to **existing Coast Guard** missions]{.mark},]{.underline}
[[given]{.mark} **[finite funding]{.mark}** [and]{.mark} **already
[stretched resources]{.mark}**]{.underline}[. [**Balance** is

the extent that Congress, DHS leadership, DoD, DOS, and other parties
can see the demonstrated value of Coast Guard international efforts,
they can support such efforts with additional funding. Congress's
ability to provide sustained funding is particularly valuable because it
can enable capital investments.

These concerns may be rooted in an overly simplistic or tactical view of
the Coast Guard's counterdrug mission. Tactically, the counterdrug
mission centers on the interdiction of cocaine, with mission success
measured in the quantity of drugs seized and number of suspected
smugglers taken into custody. Therefore, [[any **shift** or
**reallocation**]{.mark} [of **Coast Guard** forces is **viewed** as a
**zero sum scenario**]{.mark}]{.underline} (i[.e., [gain in **one

Strategically, however, the counterdrug mission complements larger,
SSA/security cooperation objectives while presenting an example of how
the service's constabulary niche offers greater relevancy and key
contributions to larger strategic objectives.

"What we're finding is, as [we are operating our current fleet to

Gautier, the service's deputy commandant for operations, told an
audience today during an event at the Center for Strategic and
International Studies.

The new 11-page document largely serves as a list of the various
missions the service is tasked with --- ranging from marine safety to
cybersecurity --- and the regions around the world the service operates
in.

[Although]{.underline} [[Gautier]{.underline}]{.mark} explicitly [[said
the **statement** is not "a **pitch for money**]{.mark}," he also made
it clear **[the USCG]{.mark}** [cannot **continue**]{.mark} on its

"[We only have funding to do **maintenance** on roughly half of what we

are aging out and ... our aircraft fleet is getting old. Spare parts are
no longer manufactured for some of these types \[of aircraft\]."

"We really, really do struggle, and our path is going to be really
challenged unless we get the kind of budget support that we need to keep

Indeed, [there have been many forums and discussions between

including the recently inaugurated Manila Dialogue on the South China
Sea in early November. Such an initiative has become a very important
venue for exchanging ideas and building common understanding between all

the dialogue focused on the PCG's role in upholding the rule of law in
the South China Sea.

[With its status as a law enforcement agency]{.underline}, [[the **Coast

Nonescalatory Presence

[[While the U.S. **military struggles**]{.underline}]{.mark} [[to find
the **right balance** between]{.mark} successfully [competing
below]{.mark} the **level** of **[armed conflict]{.mark}** and preparing
to prevail during armed]{.underline} [conflict]{.underline}, [[the
**Coast Guard** can offer some relief]{.underline}]{.mark}. Unlike the
four Department of Defense (DoD) services, [[the Coast Guard's]{.mark}
broad [authorities]{.mark}]{.underline} [[allow]{.mark} it
to]{.underline} be many things in addition to a military service and
branch of the armed forces.2 Its ability to seamlessly straddle Title 10
(military) and 14 (law enforcement and regulatory) authorities
[provide]{.underline}s [**greater [utility]{.mark}** through
**expanded** access, particularly [in]{.mark} countries or [regions
where]{.mark} the presence of [**conventional U.S. military forces**
is]{.mark} not welcome and/or **perceived** as
**[escalatory]{.mark}**.]{.underline}

[[This is]{.mark} most [evident]{.mark} in regions **exhibiting**
**heightened tensions**]{.underline}, [[such as the **South China
Sea**]{.underline}]{.mark}, Oceania, and even certain parts of Latin
America. The Coast Guard routinely operates in these regions in
accordance with more than 60 international bilateral agreements ranging
from counterdrug and search-and-rescue to illegal, unreported, and
unregulated (IUU) fisheries enforcement activities.

[Its maritime constabulary nature, global **reputation**, and expertise
make the Coast Guard the logical choice to support the **growing
demand** for **maritime security**]{.underline}
**[cooperation]{.underline}** and SSA.3 Typical Coast Guard maritime SSA
missions range from providing training on basic maritime law enforcement
boarding procedures and small boat operations to direct support
countering illicit flows of narcotics, weapons, and people, IUU
fisheries, and threats that directly contribute to instability and
violence.4 The demand stems from the fact that "the majority of the
world's maritime organizations . . . are charged with carrying out U.S.
Coast Guard-like missions" and often are comparable in size, structure,
and appearance to the Coast Guard.5 A comprehensive study, led by the
Naval Studies Board, on maritime security partnerships and the
"1,000-Ship Navy Global Maritime Network" concept concluded that the
[[Coast Guard is]{.mark} ideal "to [**pave** the **way** for]{.mark}
[**greater trust** and **cooperation**]{.mark} **between countries**,
including their **military counterparts**."6]{.underline}

#### Absent the Coast Guard, the US will use the [Navy]{.underline} to resolve disputes which [triggers a war]{.underline}.

Cooperation Agency (JICA). "Coast Guards' Role in the South China Sea."
<https://thediplomat.com/2018/11/coast-guards-role-in-the-south-china-sea/>

In June 2018, Malaysian Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad emphasized that
[[there is an impending]{.mark} [danger if]{.mark} naval
vessels]{.underline} -- **[[gray hulls]{.underline}]{.mark}** --- [[are
continuously deployed]{.mark} in the contested waters]{.underline} of
the South China Sea. Mahathir argued that [[in the event of
dangerous]{.mark} and miscalculated [maneuvers, navy ships are more
likely to **trigger**]{.mark} **an [armed
conflict]{.mark}**]{.underline} [[that may]{.mark} eventually [lead to
war]{.mark}.]{.underline} He has recognized that [[contested maritime
space is better left for]{.mark} maritime law enforcement
ships]{.underline} -- **[[white hulls]{.underline}]{.mark}** --- [to
patrol]{.underline}.

While some maritime security analysts would agree, others contend that
since the Code for Unplanned Encounters at Sea (CUES) does not cover
these white hulls, there is a high possibility that future skirmishes
between coast guards may sooner or later spark a war. In countering such
claim, it is necessary to emphasize that [the International Regulations
for Preventing Collisions at Sea, 1972 (COLREGS) govern these vessels
and all of the South China Sea claimant states are signatories to this
conventio]{.underline}n. In fact, as part of the complaint filed by [the
Philippine government]{.underline} the arbitral tribunal of 2016
[denounced the dangerous maneuvers of the China Coast Guard by referring
to the provisions of this convention]{.underline}. Thus, even without
CUES, [[white hulls are]{.mark} still governed and [regulated to
**prevent dangerous maneuvers**]{.mark} that could lead to a
collision.]{.underline}

Of course, as long as coast guard vessels are maneuvering dangerously to
the point of ramming fishing vessels and white hull counterparts, the
risk of confrontation remains. But it's important to keep in mind that
[not all of the white hulls in the region are carrying out such risky
tactics at sea.]{.underline}

The coast guard arms race in East Asia that some security analysts are
highlighting discounts the fact that [these [vessels are generally **not
large or heavily armed**]{.mark} enough to jeopardize their safety by
carrying out risky maneuvers]{.underline} (with two exceptions discussed
below). For example, the 10 vessels that Philippine Coast Guard received
from Japan recently are only 44 meters in length. The Vietnam Coast
Guard (VCG) only received its first large vessel this January, one of
the recently retired USCG Hamilton class. In the case of Malaysia, even
though the Malaysian Maritime Enforcement Agency received some of its
floating assets from the Royal Malaysian Navy when it was activated, its
first offshore patrol vessel was only given by Japan in 2016.
Indonesia's Maritime Security Agency, Bakamla, just launched its largest
110-meter offshore patrol vessel in November 2017.

[There are only two countries in East Asia]{.underline} -- China and
Japan --- [with white hull fleets that can be considered more potent
than some of the navies in the region]{.underline}. However, even their
tussle around the disputed Senkaku/Diaoyu Islands has never been hostile
enough to anticipate military escalation. In fact, this provides a
useful example of how coast guards can help avoid escalation of a
territorial conflict. Since the start of intrusion of Chinese government
ships in the contested waters in the East China Sea in 2009, [[Japan has
been reliant on its white hull]{.mark}s to respond]{.underline}.
[[Although Chinese government]{.mark} ships, coast guard vessels, and
its [**fishing militia** have been persistent in
encroaching]{.mark}]{.underline} into the contested area in the past
years, [[Japan]{.mark} [managed to respond peacefully without provoking
Beijing]{.mark} to send its navy,]{.underline} while at the same time
not conceding its territorial claims.

Furthermore, looking at coast guards, especially in Southeast Asia,
solely as an instrument to address territorial claims is a shortsighted
assessment. [[There are other coast guard functions that enable these
countries to have maritime cooperation]{.mark} in addressing
**nontraditional security threats**]{.underline}. It is through [coast
guard cooperation]{.underline} that the Regional Cooperation Agreement
on Combating Piracy and Armed Robbery against Ships in Asia (ReCAAP)
[was created to address criminal activity in the waters of **Malacca
Strait**.]{.underline}

[Coast guards also have a role in responding to **oil
spills**]{.underline}; for example, the biennial Maritime Pollution
Exercise (MARPOLEX) involves the Philippines, Japan, and Indonesia.
[These [coast guard organizations]{.mark} also [have a crucial role in
ensuring **navigational safety**]{.mark}**;**]{.underline} such [duties
fall within respective territorial seas, which also serve as sea lanes
for international shipping]{.underline}. Moreover, white hulls have a
vital role in conducting search and rescue operations. Such a
humanitarian role has paved the way for some ASEAN members to execute a
multilateral and bilateral agreement with each other and even with
China. Just recently, Japan and China had inked a maritime search and
rescue agreement with the objective of responding to sea mishaps
adjacent to their waters.

[It is an **oversimplification** to see the emergence of coast guards in
the region as an impetus for possible war simply because coast guard
vessels are not subject to CUES]{.underline}. [[The recent incident
involving the]{.mark} USS [Decatur and a Chinese destroyer was a
**visible indication** of the limitation of CUES in preventing navy
ships]{.mark} from carrying out unsafe]{.underline} and unprofessional
[maneuvers]{.underline}. The 2012 Scarborough Shoal standoff between the
Philippines and China is also evidence of the perils of using gray hulls
to fill s coast guard's maritime law enforcement role.sp

[[Instead of seeing the coast guard as the probable cause of **future
instability**]{.underline}]{.mark} in the region, [[it is time
to]{.mark} [recognize its essential role in]{.mark} strengthening
[cooperation]{.mark} between countries [to ensure]{.mark} a **safe**,
**clean**, [**secure**, and **peaceful**
se]{.mark}]{.underline}[a]{.mark}. It has to be emphasized that **[[a
coast guard]{.mark} primary [purpose is not to assert a state's]{.mark}
territorial [claim]{.mark}]{.underline}**[, [but]{.underline}]{.mark}
[rather to serve as [a **medium for the regional maritime
order**]{.mark}.]{.underline}

Fishing Crime

The AIS and VMS technologies have only been able to identify
corporations responsible for 61.5% of fishing effort due to 20% of ships
on the high seas being unequipped with AIS and the rest turning off
their AIS. It is believed that some monitored vessels, but particularly
these unmonitored vessels engage in **[IUU fishing]{.underline}**
methods, which [represent a threat to national and global security as
they account for significant economic loss, weaken national sovereignty,
and destroy a **precious limited global resource**]{.underline}. One in
five fish caught may originate from IUU fishing. US Coast Guard
Commandant ADM Karl Schultz said, "[IUU [fishing]{.mark} has **[replaced
piracy]{.mark}** [as the **leading global maritime security**]{.mark}
**[threat]{.mark}**]{.underline}[.]{.mark} [[If]{.mark} IUU fishing
continues [unchecked]{.mark}, [we can **expect deterioration** of
**fragile**]{.mark} **[coastal states]{.mark}** and increased [tension
among **foreign-fishing nations**,]{.mark} **[threatening geopolitical
stability]{.mark}** around the **world**."]{.underline}

Overfishing does not always equate to IUU fishing; however[, [IUU
fishing]{.underline}]{.mark} [is a significant contributing factor to
**[overfishing]{.mark}** [and]{.mark} the **[depletion of global fish
stocks]{.mark}**]{.underline}. [Illegal fishing using prohibited methods
or equipment typically results in excessive bycatch through
non-selective means, [**upsetting** the **fragile ecological
balance**]{.mark}]{.underline}. Fish illegally caught in protected areas
or in another nation's EEZ undermine regional and national management
efforts in sustainability. Unreported fishing can include failing to
report, misreporting, or under-reporting practices; all of these result
in flawed data that prevent informed decision-making by management
authorities when determining catch/size limits and the amount of fishing
licenses issued. Unregulated fishing refers to vessels without
nationality, areas not covered under existing national or Regional
Fisheries Management Organizations (RFMOs) management measures, and
species with insufficient regulatory oversight that may be subject to
exploitation.

[[The **world's dependence**]{.mark} [on fish]{.mark} as a **[vital
protein source]{.mark}** is an [incentive]{.mark} for the global
**community** [to]{.mark} monitor and [ensure **robust fish
stocks**]{.mark} [as a matter of **food security**]{.mark}.]{.underline}
Unfortunately, from 1974 to 2017, the percentage of fish stocks within
biologically sustainable limits dropped from 90% to 65.8%. Conversely,
the world's human population continued to increase, placing additional
pressure on stressed fish stocks. While aquaculture is alleviating some
of the demand on wild-caught fish, **[proper]{.underline}** national and
regional [fisheries management is vital to ensure that sustainable
policies]{.underline} [are implemented]{.underline} and enforced
appropriately **[to prevent overfishing.]{.underline}**

Combatting Overfishing with Legal Frameworks

The United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS) presents a
structure for fisheries governance by distinguishing between
state-managed fisheries within the 200 nautical mile EEZ and fisheries
outside the EEZ on the high seas. It provides for migratory fish, such
as tuna, that travel between different EEZs and high seas, fish that
straddle the EEZs and the high seas, and fish, such as eels and salmon,
that migrate between the sea and freshwater. Lastly, it requires
countries to cooperate with one another to conserve and manage fish in
the high seas.

Modern fishery governance is characterized by guiding principles, and
policy and regulatory frameworks that connect government with corporate
actors. Fishery governance includes national policies and legislation or
international treaties as well as customary social arrangements. At the
international level, the UN Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) is
the "only source of global fisheries and aquaculture statistics." This
repository is informed by the collection and analysis of how nations
engage in responsible and sustainable fisheries management around the
world.

The UN Fish Stocks Agreement goes further than UNCLOS by increasing
cooperative action in the management of fisheries resources. It advises
nations on how they should manage highly migratory fish stocks in
cooperation with each other, and highlights the importance of RFMOs.

RFMOs are international organizations that typically focus on the
sustainable management of all fishery resources or a particular species
within a specific area. RFMOs provide information on corporate actors;
however, their data are often incomplete or inaccessible in that they
register shell companies that obscure corporate actors, they do not all
make vessel ownership available, and/or they do not publish public
vessel registries.

Within the Indo-Pacific, there are nine RFMOs.

Indian Ocean Tuna Commission (IOTC)

Indian Ocean South East Asian Marine Turtle Memorandum of Understanding
(IOSEA)

Agreement on the International Dolphin Conservation Program (AIDCP)

Inter-American Tropical Tuna Commission (IATTC)

North Pacific Anadromous Fish Commission (NPAFC)

Convention on the Conservation and Management of Pollock Resources in
the Central Bering Sea

Pacific Salmon Commission (PSC)

Western and Central Pacific Fisheries Commission (WCPFC)

International Pacific Halibut Commission (IPHC)

Given that global fish stocks are in a rapidly deteriorating condition,
these fisheries governance structures are clearly failing in their
objectives and require attention. For instance, only ten of the 17 RFMOs
that cover high seas globally have carriage requirements for an onboard
observer, and only one has a ban on transshipment; a practice that
obscures the source of a significant portion of illegal and unreported
fishing activity and provides a pathway for illegally caught fish to
enter the global seafood market. It may be that onboard observer
requirements are not being pursued since they are a widely corrupted
monitoring mechanism.

[[at the forefront of **combatting IUU
fishing**]{.mark}**,**]{.underline} [[with the US Coast Guard having the
**lead for at-sea enforcement** of **living marine resource
laws.**]{.underline}]{.mark}

In addition to protecting US sovereign waters from overfishing, the US
recognizes that a global approach is needed to effectively combat the
transnational nature of IUU fishing. As such, the US Coast Guard and
NOAA are both involved in a constellation of international counter-IUU
fishing operations and partnerships. These include:

Pacific Quadrilateral Defense Coordinating Group (Pacific QUAD). [[The
US Coast Guard]{.mark} serves as the US Indo-Pacific Command
representative to the Pacific QUAD, a collaborative effort with
Australia, France, and New Zealand aimed at coordinating and
strengthening **maritime security** in the South Pacific.]{.underline}
[Pacific QUAD efforts to combat overfishing include joint patrols to
[**ensure compliance** with **international fisheries
agreements**.]{.mark}]{.underline}

Operation North Pacific Guard. This is a multilateral enforcement
operation in partnership with Canada, China, Japan, South Korea, and
Russia to tackle all IUU fishing threats in the North Pacific Ocean.

Shiprider Agreements. The US Coast Guard partners with Pacific Island
Nations through bilateral agreements known as Shiprider Agreements.
These allow partners nations to enforce their own domestic laws by
having their law enforcement officials onboard a US Coast Guard vessel
or alongside their boarding team.

Port State Measurements Agreement (PSMA). The United Nations enacted the
PSMA to prevent IUU fishing through the adoption and implementation of
effective port state measures to help ensure the long-term conservation
and sustainable use of living marine resources.

NOAA serves as the lead agency for enforcing PSMA in the United States
and its Territories, which includes setting standards for exercising
port state controls over foreign-flagged vessels seeking entry into US
ports and over those vessels' activities while in port. Through
information sharing, vessels on IUU lists are identified and prevented
from offloading illegally caught catch in ports, thereby increasing the
costs of IUU fishing through diminished demand.

Counter IUU-Fishing Capacity Building. Through various technical
assistance and training workshops, NOAA provides foreign organizations
governments, organizations, and communities with the tools, resources,
and information sharing avenues to allow them to address complex IUU
fishing issues.

in October 2022, naming China as the greatest threat to the United
States. [Nearly two centuries of humiliation of China by the
West]{.underline}, beginning at least with the Opium War of 1842 to make
Chinese drug addiction a western profit center. The United States
followed with the Chinese Exclusion Act of 1882 and a prohibition on the
naturalization of Chinese immigrants. The United States betrayed China
during the post-World War I Paris Peace talks by surrendering Shandong

shake the hand of Chinese Premier Zhou Enlai during the Geneva
Conference to settle the future of Vietnam and gratuitously sneered that
the two would only meet in a car crash. [Taiwan is the same distance
from the Chinese mainland as Cuba is to the United States]{.underline}.
During the 1962 Cuban Missile Crisis, [we were willing to initiate war
if necessary to compel the Soviet Union to remove tactical nuclear

the missiles to deter a planned second United States invasion on the

before with Austrian Archduke Ferdinand's assassination by Serb

War I, which witnessed 20 million deaths and 21 million wounded. World
War III could be precipitated by a shoot-out over the Senkaku/Diaoyu
Islands or the Scarborough Shoal/Huangyan Island. [A [war]{.mark}
involving the U.S. and China [would]{.mark} probably
**[metastasize]{.mark}**]{.underline}. According to the Brookings
Institution's Michael O'Hanlon: "[[Neither]{.mark} Beijing nor

[expand **horizontally**]{.mark} to other regions [and

**[[use]{.underline}]{.mark}**. It literally could [become the worst
catastrophe in the history of warfare]{.underline}." In recent years,
U.S. wargames have generally shown China defeating the United States.
One analysis concluded: "The overarching takeaway from participants in
the war game: If China invades Taiwan, the Indo-​Pacific region will
plunge into a broad, drawn-​out war that could include direct attacks on
the U.S., including Hawaii and potentially the continental United
States." If a war with China over Taiwan seems crazy, it's because it
is! We have no defense treaty with Taiwan. We have no diplomatic
relations with Taiwan. It has no membership in the United Nations. It is
within China's traditional sphere of influence. It is more than 7,500
miles away from the United States. Its independence is a featherweight
to our national security. If China annexed Taiwan, imitating our
annexation of Hawaii in 1898, the annexation would not be an existential
threat to the United States. I can already hear the appeasement shouts
of "Munich," "Munich," "Munich" from the multi-trillion-dollar
military-industrial-security complex. But [[China is not the Third
Reich]{.mark}, President Xi Jinping is not Adolf Hitler. [Taiwan is not
Czechoslovakia]{.mark}]{.underline}. And the [Domino Theory implicit in
the cry of "Munich" was discredited by our defeat by
Vietnam]{.underline}. It has become a semi-ally of the United States in
opposing China. And Japan and South Korea are fully capable of defending
themselves against a Chinese invasion.President George Washington's
time-honored Farewell Address provides the path to extricate ourselves
from a war with China over Taiwan: "The great rule of conduct for us in
regard to foreign nations is in extending our commercial relations to
have with them as little political connection as possible."

### Impact\-\--AT: Shipbuilding Turn\-\--2NC/1NR

#### Conventional naval dominance [fails]{.underline} for Taiwan. 

Brian **Kerg 25**. Nonresident Fellow, Indo-Pacific Security Initiative,
Scowcroft Center for Strategy and Security. \"How the US Can Rethink Its
Military Strategy for Taiwan.\" Irregular Warfare Initiative. 2-11-2025.
https://irregularwarfare.org/articles/us-military-strategy-taiwan-counter-china/

[[The **US cannot** **keep pace** with China's]{.mark} **exponential
[growth]{.mark}** in **naval power**]{.underline}. [Ship for
ship]{.underline}, the People's Liberation Army Navy outnumbers the US
Navy, and this disparity will only grow with time. [[This makes]{.mark}
**[conventional]{.mark} [naval power]{.mark}** an **[unreliable]{.mark}
means** by which the US could deter or combat Chinese maritime
aggression]{.underline}. The most dangerous instance of such potential
aggression is an attempt by China to seize control of Taiwan and the
hostilities that would likely ensue between the US and China as a
result.

[Holding fast to an **infeasible strategic approach** is
**folly**]{.underline}. A course correction is required and must use
means available to the US today that can reliably deter China from
launching a cross-strait attack against its democratic neighbor and
preserve a free and open Indo-Pacific.

To deter China from invading Taiwan, the US must deploy and maintain a
military force to bolster Taiwan with combat power sufficient to foil
Chinese invasion plans. While this may seem highly escalatory, such a
move would not cross actual Chinese red lines. Political acts that
appear to support Taiwanese independence do yield volatile and
aggressive Chinese reactions. In contrast, reports of US forces on
Taiwan have resulted in no similarly aggressive response from China to
date.

This asymmetric approach would undercut China's naval strength,
obviating China's increasing ability to outclass US naval power. In this
way, the US can leverage current and developing capabilities to provide
a feasible strategy for the defense of Taiwan.

[A [Conventional Strategy]{.mark} to Deter **Chinese Aggression** [is a
**Losing Proposition**]{.mark}]{.underline}

[The U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates [is losing the [maritime
competition]{.mark} with the People's Republic of China---and it's
**[not postured to win]{.mark} it**.]{.underline} [With Chinese
shipbuilding]{.underline} capacity and its expanding defense budget
significantly [outpacing]{.underline} that of [the US]{.underline}, the
People's Liberation Army Navy now outnumbers the US in warfighting naval
platforms with an ever-growing differential.

In contrast, [US shipbuilding efforts have **barely moved** in a
**strategic direction** favorable to the US military]{.underline}. The
Secretary of the Navy under the **[Biden]{.underline}** administration
[made **[herculean efforts]{.mark}** [to address]{.mark} the **[systemic
obstacles]{.mark}** [**plaguing** the **US**]{.mark}
**[shipbuilding]{.mark}** industry, yet these **problems** still
**[remain unresolved]{.mark}**.]{.underline} It is likely that, absent
the urgency of military duress, the problems will remain due to inertia.
In the meantime, China will establish clear naval dominance within its
adjacent seas, most notably the First Island Chain.

[These problems converge on the most **salient flashpoint** between
**China** and the **US**---a potential war **initiated** by a **Chinese
invasion** of **Taiwan**]{.underline}. Bringing Taiwan under Chinese
rule---by any means---remains a principal national security objective of
China. Xi Jinping ordered his army to be militarily capable of achieving
this goal by 2027. While there are some doubts that China will be ready
on schedule, it continues to march towards that state of readiness.

[[The **US remains**]{.mark} [on **track** to **fall further
behind**]{.mark}]{.underline}, in relative and absolute terms. Recent
wargames that explored a US-China war over Taiwan have had mixed
results, but these games used models featuring a more balanced ratio of
US naval forces relative to Chinese naval forces, a ratio now obviated
by China's most recent leap in naval power.

Moreover, the growing Chinese naval advantage makes China's maritime
reach more global in nature. This will only increase China's ability to
prevent the US from projecting and sustaining combat forces across the
Pacific, forcing US naval forces into decisive battle areas across the
First Island Chain and around Taiwan. This disrupts the US maritime
strategy of projecting conventional power into theaters through command
and control of the sea lines of communication throughout the operational
areas. If the US continues to employ this principal theory of warfare,
the US is increasingly likely to lose the opening phases of any such
conflict with China.

[A [conventional]{.mark} US **military [strategy]{.mark}** applied to
this **problem** [is a **path to defeat**]{.mark}]{.underline}. While
China likely desires to take Taiwan through non-military means and avoid
a direct conflict with the US, China will exploit its relative military
advantage to accelerate gray zone operations and a salami slicing
strategy that will deteriorate the US as a reliable security guarantor
for its regional allies, while accelerating its pressure campaign
against Taiwan. [Without a **new approach**, China's ability to compel
Taiwan to bend its knee to Beijing becomes stronger, even if a war never
occurs.]{.underline}

[Internationally respected IR professor]{.underline} [Hamada
Koichi]{.underline} , who once served as special advisor to former Prime
Minister Abe Shinzo of Japan, also [observed that
[Xi]{.mark}]{.underline} [[is]{.underline}]{.mark} **[well
[aware]{.mark}]{.underline}** [that the forceful [subjugation]{.mark}
of]{.underline} [Taiwan]{.underline} **[[could]{.mark} well [end up
backfiring]{.mark}]{.underline}**. "[At a time when [China is under
**severe economic pressure**]{.mark}]{.underline} [and growth is
**slowing sharply**, this is the last thing it]{.underline} \[the
Chinese Communist Party\] [needs]{.underline}," Hamada opined. I[t's
undeniable that the unification of Taiwan]{.underline} with mainland
China [has been an integral component]{.underline} [of Xi's signature
"great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation]{.underline}" goal. [Yet some
scholars maintain]{.underline} **[Beijing has no intention of forcing
unification]{.underline}** now or anytime soon. One recent commentary
with a focus on the escalating tensions in the Taiwan Strait put it
plainly: "[[We]{.mark} [have]{.mark} simply [forgotten]{.mark}
[the]{.mark} **number of [times]{.mark}** when the
[Xi]{.mark}]{.underline} Jinping [administration]{.underline}
[[has]{.underline} **[threatened to reunify]{.underline}**]{.mark}
[China and Taiwan]{.underline}, even by use of force, if necessary.
[[But]{.mark} one thing is clear]{.underline} -- **[[China won't]{.mark}
invade Taiwan]{.underline}**." According to Professor Deng Yuwen, a
council member of China's Reform and Development Institute, rather than
launching an invasion, "[China will **choose to put
pressure**]{.underline} [on Taiwan using a **combination of
methods**]{.underline} [to promote unification]{.underline}... It may
launch more preferential policies and try to initiate discussion on a
'one country, two systems' framework with Taiwan's ruling and opposition
parties." Here are 10 practical constraints making it highly unlikely
that China will resort to using force. First, [a [war]{.mark} between
even a small country and a big power today [is]{.mark} **not only
[expensive]{.mark}**]{.underline} [[but]{.mark} also [not an **easy
walkover**]{.mark} for the bigger side,]{.underline} as Russian
President Vladimir Putin is finding out. [With the war in Ukraine soon
to complete one year]{.underline} of fighting, [what is notable is
that]{.underline} **[Ukraine has been able to sustain]{.underline}**
[itself **despite** having a much smaller GDP]{.underline} and a weaker
military than Russia. Second, [[with China's export markets
**drying**]{.mark} **up** in Europe and the United States]{.underline},
[the Chinese real estate crisis **deepening further**,]{.underline} the
World Bank and the IMF predicting a gloomy economic growth outlook of
1.7 percent and 2.7 percent respectively, [[the]{.mark} immediate key
[priority for]{.mark} the Chinese [leadership is]{.mark} **not to use
force**]{.underline} [in the Taiwan Strait but [to]{.mark}]{.underline}
**[[strengthen]{.mark} [the economy]{.mark}]{.underline}**. China's
economy is struggling in the midst of a pressure campaign waged against
it by the United States. At the same time, [the Chinese economy is
a]{.underline}lso **[slowing down sharply]{.underline}** [under the
mounting pressure]{.underline} of the COVID-19 pandemic, especially
following the CCP regime's reversal of the zero COVID policy. Under such
circumstances, [[it would]{.mark} [be **foolhardy**]{.mark} on the part
of Xi,]{.underline} or the CCP, [[to burden the]{.mark} national
[economy]{.mark}]{.underline} by taking on the enormous expense of a
war. Third, regardless of the fact that [Xi]{.underline} has locked down
a third five-year term, his [goal to consolidate a power base within the
party **is far from accomplished**]{.underline}. It is often the case
that more control only breeds more paranoia among authoritarian leaders.
[The fear of being **unable** to keep forced unification a **short-term
exercise** might be acting as a **potent deterrent** for Xi]{.underline}
-- especially as Putin has already paid a heavy political price for the
war in Ukraine. Fourth, though Xi will be in favor of waging a quick war
on the cheap, that may not be within his control. There is always a risk
that conflict will escalate into "total war" -- a phrase that became
popular to describe the situation in World War II, as each side used
every possible resource to destroy their opponent. Fifth, [Taiwan and
Ukraine cannot be compared in military strength]{.underline} -- [Taiwan
is **armed to the teeth.**]{.underline} Unlike Ukraine's steppe-like
fertile plains and plateaus, [Taiwan consists of over **100
islands**]{.underline}. [Taiwan's]{.underline} [outer islands
are]{.underline} **[dotted]{.underline}** [with missiles, rockets, and
artillery]{.underline} guns. In addition, Taiwan's granite hills are
home to tunnels and bunker systems. Sixth is the possibility of U.S.
involvement in. [[While]{.mark} officially [Washington maintains]{.mark}
"[strategic ambiguity]{.mark}"]{.underline} on the question whether it
would defend Taiwan militarily if needed, [none other than]{.underline}
President Joe [[**Biden himself** has **repeatedly**]{.mark}
**[answered]{.mark}** directly in the]{.underline}
**[[affirmative]{.underline}]{.mark}**. Amid the China-U.S. competition
[it seems more]{.underline} and more [likely that
Washington]{.underline} **[cannot afford]{.underline}** [to allow
Beijing a free hand in any military campaign]{.underline} against
Taiwan. Seventh is the Japan dimension. [The current Japanese
government]{.underline} under Kishida [has followed up on
signals]{.underline} from the late Prime Minister Abe that [[Tokyo
would]{.mark} **help to [defend Taiwan]{.mark}**]{.underline}. [Abe once
said, "A Taiwan contingency is a contingency for Japan."]{.underline}
The Kishida government's push for a more muscular defense role in the
region is believed to be in part motivated by the potential for a Taiwan
contingency. Eighth, according to a Hong Kong-based expert on Chinese
politics, [[Xi will be]{.underline}]{.mark} **[well [aware of the West's
solidarity]{.mark}]{.underline}** [during the Ukraine
crisis]{.underline} [The European Union is China's major trading
partner]{.underline}. [[Running afoul]{.mark} of it,]{.underline} as
well as the United States and Japan, [[would be]{.underline}
**[dangerous]{.underline}**]{.mark} for [a leader who know**s he must
raise living standards** at home.]{.underline} Ninth, Taiwan may not
have been included in a series of recent U.S. multilateral security and
trade initiatives in the Indo-Pacific region but the island is perceived
as integral to defense mechanisms such as the Quad, AUKUS, etc. For
example, the Quad insists on maintaining the status quo in the
Indo-Pacific region. Hence, not only Japan but India and Australia might
come to the rescue of Taiwan. In such a scenario, China might not want
to risk facing three big military powers together. Last but not least is
the ASEAN factor. ASEAN has emerged as China's largest trading partner
and their bilateral trade is set to achieve the target of \$1 trillion
in a couple of years. Yet Southeast Asian governments are growing wary
of China too. In a recent speech, the former Singapore foreign minister
George Yeo said: "No country in ASEAN is going to turn down
opportunities that come their way in China, but every country worries
that too great a dependence on China will constrain our autonomy of
action." It is highly unlikely Beijing would resort to an action that
will force countries in Southeast Asia to see China as an enemy. Cl[aims
that "Xi wants to complete the task within his term of
office]{.underline}" **[may be true.]{.underline}** [But there is no
doubt that **all of Xi's predecessors**]{.underline} -- [from Mao Zedong
and Deng Xiaoping to Jiang Zemin and Hu Jintao]{.underline} -- **[also
wanted to complete unification.]{.underline}** [All of them **ultimately
decided** the]{.underline} [internal and external
conditions]{.underline} **[were not right]{.underline}**. Xi, so far,
has come to the same conclusion.

significant shortfalls.]{.underline} [First among them is that neither

[A second key shortfall, according to the GAO, stems from delays in

report said that operational capability gaps will persist through almost
2040.

Manpower is also a concern, with a shortage of around 10% in the
enlisted ranks. The tone of the GAO report is quite critical, indicating
it tasked the Coast Guard to develop a service-wide "workforce needs"
study, but it had not done so. Of the 34 recommendations the GAO made to
address manpower shortfall, 28 had not been implanted as of late last
fall.

From participating in multilateral exercises to embedding small teams in

interoperability. "[Our small teams can become a trusted

Tiongson underscores that these relationships are stronger than ever.
"Every year, they get stronger. I've seen it firsthand over the last

Resource Gaps: The Case for Coast Guard Recapitalization

[[As the **Coast Guard\'s mission grows**]{.mark}, [so do its

**[need]{.mark}** for [**more resources**.]{.mark}]{.underline}

"Our rotary-wing aircraft are flying 19,000 hours. Some are grounded or
about to be grounded," he warns. "I need fixed-wing aircraft, I need
maritime patrol lift, and I'm operating cutters that are 50 years old."

[[The Coast Guard's]{.mark} acquisition [budget stands at **under \$2

[[The U.S. Coast Guard]{.mark} [responded to]{.mark}]{.underline}

Acting Coast Guard commandant Adm. Kevin Lunday told a House panel on
Wednesday. But **[[the moves came]{.mark} [with
trade-offs]{.mark}]{.underline}**, both [[for **Coast Guard
resources**]{.underline}]{.mark} and for the flow and location of
migrant activity.

Testifying to the House Appropriation Committee's subcommittee on
oversight Wednesday, Lunday said the service had conducted 157 alien
expulsion flights to deport illegal immigrants at the administration's
behest to date. The service, he said, had also prevented more than 860
migrants from illegally entering the U.S. by sea and had already
surpassed last year's totals in interdictions of cocaine and other
drugs.

Asked by Rep. Lauren Underwood (D-Ill.) about the tradeoffs needed to
conduct the border missions, Lunday said the Coast Guard had had to

USCGC Calhoun (WMSL-759) to support the Arctic Coast Guard Forum in
Iceland.

"It wasn't an operational \[mission\] ... I want to be specific and
clear," Lunday said.

But [as the U.S. military]{.underline} and law enforcement [presence at
the border has become increasingly muscular, Lunday said [the Coast
Guard has seen changes]{.mark} in how the illegal activity it monitors
is taking place as well.]{.underline}

"When you squeeze or tighten down on one part of the land border ...we
see elements of that flow or that vector try to make their way across
other areas of the border," he said. "And so we're seeing an increase in
activity off Southern California. And we see it in increased smuggling
attempts, moving illegal migration and also drugs, trying to get those
into not only San Diego but further up the coast, up toward Los Angeles
as well."

[That has [translated to **increased presence**]{.mark} in those **areas
[for the Coast Guard]{.mark}**]{.underline}[,]{.mark} Lunday said. It
has also brought the human cost of the illegal activity closer to U.S.
population centers: Lunday cited the May 5 death of three people,
including a minor, when the smuggling vessel they were in flipped in the
surf off San Diego.

"And so these efforts are critical to not only protect our border but
save lives as well," Lunday said. "So we do need increased and sustained
top line funding to be able to generate and sustain the assets, ships,
cutters, boats and aircraft and sensors necessary to enable us to
protect that maritime approach to the U.S. border, off of California,
off of Texas and the Gulf of America, and then off of Florida and the
U.S. Virgin Islands."

[Two Navy destroyers]{.underline}, Lunday said, [were supporting the
Coast Guard interdiction mission off the coast of California,
[underscoring the **limits** of the **service's
resources**]{.mark}.]{.underline}

#### Indo-Pacific focus is [unsustainable]{.underline} given existing resource constraints.

**[The [Indo-Pacific]{.mark}]{.underline}**

This dilemma has played out as the **[[Coast
Guard]{.underline}]{.mark}** has been assuming a new, resource-intensive
**[[role]{.underline}]{.mark}** far from U.S. territorial waters.
However desirable this might be, it [[is **unsustainable**]{.mark} [in
light of the **service's resource constraints.**]{.mark}]{.underline}

Recent articles in Proceedings highlight the Coast Guard's global
ambition: "[The Coast Guard Can **Reduce Risk** in the **South China
Sea**,]{.underline}" "**[Guard the African Coast]{.underline}**," [and
"Employ Coast Guard LEDets in the **Indo-Pacific**]{.underline}" are but
a few examples.9 Indeed, [[the Coast Guard]{.underline}]{.mark}---part
of the Department of Homeland Security, [[with]{.mark} the most
[extensive **domestic responsibilities**]{.mark} of any **armed
service**]{.underline}---has become an increasingly global force.

[The [focus]{.mark} of Coast Guard international operations [is the
**western Pacific**]{.mark}]{.underline}. This includes Operation Blue
Pacific, a "multi-mission, multi-location effort in coordination with
key partners amongst Pacific Island nations."10 And western Pacific
Coast Guard operations appear likely to expand. "There is no better
example of the Coast Guard's full potential than our work in the
Indo-Pacific," declared Commandant Admiral Linda Fagan in 2023.11 The
Coast Guard's FY25 budget request includes more than a quarter of a
billion dollars "to expand Coast Guard operations in the Indo-Pacific,"
allowing it "to transition from episodic to persistent presence in the
region."12

It is important to note that the United States is a Pacific nation, and
the Coast Guard must maintain a presence in the Indo-Pacific
region---for example, in and around the Hawaiian Islands---to perform
its statutory missions. However, operations such as Blue Pacific are not
about patrolling U.S. Pacific waters but are focused on partnering with
Indo-Pacific allies to counter China at sea. Sometimes this involves
training with coalition partners. For example, during a "21,000-mile,
98-day Indo-Pacific deployment," the USCGC Bertholf (WMSL-750) conducted
"at-sea exercises, professional engagements, and subject matter expert
exchanges" in Malaysia and India.13 In other instances, U.S. personnel
are enforcing foreign laws in contested maritime zones.14

[No doubt [**these operations** are **useful**]{.mark}.]{.underline}
Allied coast guards can learn much from their U.S. counterpart, and
regional security partnerships can deter illicit maritime activity such
as illegal, unreported, and unregulated fishing. In addition, the
Indo-Pacific is "at the center of the current era of great power
competition," as one Coast Guard officer wrote in advocating an expanded
Pacific presence.15 Good leaders often want to be where the action is,
and it makes sense that Coast Guard leaders---justifiably proud of their
team---wish to prove their ability and contribute in an area important
to U.S. national security.

[[Yet]{.mark}, however useful or desirable these operations are,
[they]{.mark} are not among the **Coast Guard's statutory missions** and
[may **prove unsustainable**]{.mark}]{.underline}. [[Grueling
Indo-Pacific]{.mark} [**operations** will place **added strain** on an
**already distressed cutter fleet**]{.mark}.]{.underline} And with sea
duty seeming increasingly unpopular, [[extended operations]{.mark} far
from home may [**deepen** the **Coast Guard's manning
crisis**]{.mark}]{.underline}.16 [Already stretched]{.underline} nearly
[to the **breaking point**[, the Coast Guard simply cannot **afford** to
**exhaust its people and equipment on nonessential
missions.**]{.mark}]{.underline}

ICE Pact has the potential to build upon this foundation and become a
key trilateral partnership between the United States, Canada, and
Finland that deepens collaboration on national security matters in the
polar and Arctic regions. As laid out in its announcement, [the Pact's
central focus will be a joint effort [to **build top-of-the-line**
**polar icebreakers**]{.mark} by pooling and sharing
expertise]{.underline}. The partnership **[aims to]{.underline}**

good jobs at shipyards and related businesses all over, while
[[meet]{.underline}]{.mark}ing **[[key national security
needs]{.underline}]{.mark}** in which the United States and NATO allies
have been lagging. According to U.S. Coast Guard data, Russia currently
possesses 36 government-owned and operated icebreakers while China --
despite not being an Arctic nation -- has a fleet of four. By
comparison, [the U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates [has just
**[two operational polar icebreakers]{.mark}** [and]{.mark}]{.underline}
[[has]{.mark} been far too [slow in advancing our]{.mark} polar
[icebreaker recapitalization]{.mark}]{.underline}[. [**Without
sufficient icebreaker capacity**, the **U.S. Coast Guard** is often
forced to **divert assets needed elsewhere to meet Arctic mission
needs.**]{.underline}]{.mark}

Wrong Tool for the South China Sea.\" U.S. Naval Institute. 9-1-2017.
https://www.usni.org/magazines/proceedings/2017/september/coast-guard-wrong-tool-south-china-sea

**[[Not a Low Risk Solution.]{.underline}]{.mark}**

[[There is no]{.mark} meaningful [scenario in which]{.mark} having
[a]{.mark} U.S. "[white h]{.mark}ull" alone and in]{.underline} contact
with Chinese maritime forces [[reduces the risk]{.mark} [to
**U.S.**]{.mark} **interests** or **[operations]{.mark}**]{.underline}.
[The [perception]{.mark} that U.S. [Coast Guard]{.mark} units are
**[less escalatory]{.mark}** [rests on]{.mark} their [claim to
be]{.mark} [administering]{.mark} law in waters under **[sovereign
control]{.mark}**]{.underline}[. [U.S. Coast Guard units have **no such
status** in the **South China Sea**]{.underline}]{.mark}. [If present
during a confrontation]{.underline} with a friend or ally [while not
empowered to act]{.underline}, [they **damage** the **prestige** of the
United States]{.underline} with the stigma of having observed and done
nothing. [[If **empowered to act**, they represent the **proverbial
knife** in a **gunfight**, **poorly equipped to deal with potential
escalation.**]{.underline}]{.mark}

But Wait\...

While the U.S. Navy often assumes it will work alone, the effort to
secure freedom-of-navigation needs support and capacity from U.S. allies
and partners across the globe. [Within this context, the U.S. Coast
Guard would be a welcome force provider from within the U.S. national
fleet.]{.underline}

Further, there are also areas outside the South China Sea where
resources are the central issue. As Coast Guard Captain Jay Caputo
observes in the August Proceedings, Chinese fishing fleets are pushing
into new areas, including waters where U.S. law enforcement is in the
lead. Noting the tendency of the China Coast Guard and People's Armed
Forces Maritime Militia to accompany and protect Chinese fishing
vessels---even those violating international and national laws---Captain
Caputo argues that "it is imperative that the Coast Guard be prepared
for when the Chinese fishing militia approaches the U.S. EEZ." That
clearly would be a Coast Guard mission.

[By all means, bring the U.S Coast Guard to the western
Pacific]{.underline}. Leverage its extraordinary professionalism and
guardian ethic to partner with friends and allies. Better maritime law
enforcement is a common good, and supporting it is a sign of U.S.
commitment.

[America's allies in the Indo-Pacific are getting pretty familiar with
**China's grey-zone** maritime **behavior**, but the **U**nited
**S**tates itself **is ill-prepared to deal with it.**]{.underline}

Yet it should be prepared, experts warned a US House of Representatives
committee in a hearing this month. The US must not only counter the
threat to its national security posed by China's coercive operations,
but also support its allies against Chinese efforts to rewrite the rule
of law in the region.

[[The US Coast Guard]{.mark}, **[America's best tool]{.mark}** [for
responding to **China's use of force**]{.mark} **below** the
**threshold** of **war**, [was **underequipped**]{.mark} **for the
task**]{.underline}, maritime security experts from the US Naval War
College, the Heritage Foundation and the RAND Corporation told the
committee. [The service **[needed more ships]{.mark}**, more
**[sailors]{.mark}** [and]{.mark} advanced [capabilities **tailored**

sea**]{.underline}, they said. It [must also increase its engagement
with Indo-Pacific allies to build up maritime law enforcement
cooperation in the region.]{.underline}

[The coast guard's **[chronic shortage]{.mark}** [of **personnel** and
**vessels**]{.mark} could [no longer be]{.mark}
**[ignored]{.mark}**,]{.underline} experts said. Their warnings were
consistent with broader concerns in the national defense community that,
[at a **time** of **heightened** need for **law enforcement operations**
in the **Indo-Pacific**, [the **Coast Guard is spread too
thinly**]{.mark}]{.underline}. This past year, staff shortages have
forced it to shut down 29 boat stations and deactivate several cutters.
Experts also testified that the service's acquisition plans were
inadequate for replacing old vessels and commissioning long-range
cutters needed for patrolling the Indo-Pacific region.

[In its gutted state, the **US Coast Guard** is
**[underprepared]{.mark}** [to carry out law **enforcement duties** in

Zong **Haihe 22**. Current affairs commentator for the Global Times.
"DOC: the cornerstone for South China Sea peace and stability." Global
Times, 16 June 2022.
https://www.globaltimes.cn/page/202206/1268287.shtml?id=11.

[With the end of the Cold War]{.underline},
[[tensions]{.underline}]{.mark} in the region [started to
[ease]{.mark}]{.underline}[, [and cooperation]{.underline}]{.mark} [and
development [began to dominate regional]{.mark}
[engagement]{.mark}]{.underline}. As China and Southeast Asian countries
entered the fast track of growth in their diplomatic relations, regional
countries have increasingly come to realize that the correct approach to
handle the South China Sea issue shall be to put aside disputes, seek
common ground while reserving differences, engage in dialogue and
consultation, and work for win-win results. Under this context, [[the
DOC]{.underline},]{.mark} with its signing and effective implementation,
[cannot be a more timely answer]{.underline} to the call of the region,
[[showcas]{.mark}ing the ever-growing [relations]{.mark} between China
and ASEAN Member States.]{.underline}

Looking back over the past 20 years, **[[despite occasional
turbulence]{.underline}]{.mark}**, **[[the overall situation in
the]{.mark} [S]{.mark}outh [C]{.mark}hina [S]{.mark}ea [has remained
peaceful and stable]{.mark}]{.underline}**, and the DOC deserves great
credit. China and ASEAN Member States have every reason to be proud of
this historical document, one that has blazed a trail on many fronts.

[[The DOC]{.mark} has [set]{.mark} a [foundation]{.mark} of mutual
[trust]{.mark} between China and ASEAN Member States]{.underline}. The
signing of the DOC was a major step in creating a mechanism for dealing
with the South China Sea issue. [[It has]{.mark} effectively
[enhanced]{.mark} the [political mutual trust]{.mark} among regional
countries [and laid]{.mark} a solid foundation for the further
development and upgrading of China-ASEAN relations]{.underline}. The
purposes, principles and specific measures established in the DOC
embodied regional countries\' greatest consensus and willingness for
future efforts and have thus been repeatedly confirmed in the documents
jointly issued by China and ASEAN Member States over the years. The DOC
itself has a strong binding and regulatory force in the political sense,
thus becoming the basic instrument that all parties refer to when it
comes to the South China Sea issue.

[The DOC has found [the basic path for handling disputes]{.mark} in the
South China Sea.]{.underline} Article 4 of the DOC reads, \"The Parties
concerned undertake to resolve their territorial and jurisdictional
disputes by peaceful means... through friendly consultations and
negotiations by sovereign states directly concerned.\" Under such
guidance, [[China]{.mark} has [established bilateral consultation
mechanisms]{.mark} on the South China Sea issue with the Philippines and
Vietnam [and]{.mark} has [maintained close communication]{.mark} and
dialogue with countries including Malaysia and Brunei [on maritime
issues]{.mark}]{.underline}. Unfortunately, the Philippines staged the
South China Sea arbitration in 2016, a political farce indeed, directly
challenging Article 4 of the DOC, which was met with firm opposition
from China and serious concerns from other regional countries. Shortly
after the illegal ruling was out, the foreign ministers of China and
ASEAN Member States issued a joint statement on the full and effective
implementation of the DOC, bringing the South China Sea issue back on
the right track.

[[The DOC has created]{.mark} guidelines of [self-restraint]{.mark} for
claimant states]{.underline}. According to Article 5 of the DOC, \"The
Parties undertake to exercise self-restraint in the conduct of
activities that would complicate or escalate disputes and affect peace
and stability including, among others, refraining from action of
inhabiting on the presently uninhabited islands, reefs, shoals, cays,
and other features and to handle their differences in a constructive
manner.\" Prohibition of new occupation of islands or reefs is crucial,
which could effectively prevent the issue from getting out of control
and the possible escalation of tensions in the South China Sea. [This
key role of the DOC [in crisis prevention]{.mark} has been [affirmed by
scholars]{.mark} from regional countries at the sub-forum on South China
Sea during the recent Boao Forum for Asia Annual Conference in
Hainan.]{.underline}

The DOC has built an important platform for practical maritime
cooperation. It encourages all parties to strengthen military dialogue,
including voluntary notification of military exercises. And it also
stipulates to explore or undertake practical cooperation in marine
environment protection, marine scientific research, safety of navigation
and communication at sea, search and rescue, and combating transnational
crimes. [Under the DOC framework, China and ASEAN Member [States]{.mark}
have [carried out **meaningful and fruitful cooperation** over]{.mark}
the years]{.underline}. [China and ASEAN Member States **issued the
declaration for a decade of [coastal and marine]{.mark} environmental
[protection]{.mark}** in the South China Sea on the occasion of the 20th
ASEAN-China Summit, **[established a hotline]{.mark}
[communication]{.mark}** [platform]{.mark} among senior officials of the
Ministries of Foreign Affairs in response to maritime emergencies,
**[and]{.mark} [agreed to apply the Code for Unplanned
Encounters]{.mark}** at Sea in the South China Sea, to name a
few.]{.underline} Meanwhile, a series of seminars, training courses and
tabletop exercises were successfully held in the fields of marine
disaster prevention, marine ecological environment and monitoring,
marine scientific research as well as among maritime law enforcement
agencies.

As the regional situation continues to evolve, it is also important to
develop regional rules to ensure long-term peace, stability and order in
the South China Sea. [The parties made their commitment in the DOC to
work toward the eventual attainment of a Code of Conduct]{.underline}
(COC) in the South China Sea on the basis of consensus, [which charted
the course for future rules-making and mechanism-building in the South
China Sea.]{.underline} The COC consultations have maintained good
momentum and achieved continued progress since its launch in 2013. The
parties have further enhanced trust and accumulated consensus through
the process. As a matter of fact, the consultation itself is part of the
confidence-building measures in the South China Sea. The COC, which is
based on the DOC and expected to be an upgraded version of the DOC, will
be more substantive and better guide regional countries to engage in
dialogue and cooperation.

For some time now, there have been some voices that claim the United
Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS) as the legal basis for
resolving all maritime issues. UNCLOS is undoubtedly important. Yet its
importance should never be overrated, given the limitations of the times
when it was born. UNCLOS would by no means be the entirety of the law of
the sea. More importantly, the Convention deters itself from application
in any disputes concerning the sovereignty of islands and reefs, while
the core of the South China Sea issue is territorial disputes.

The DOC and the future COC are important practices for exploring the
application of both UNCLOS and general international law in the region.
They should be regarded as the over-arching instruments for dealing with
the South China Sea issue. And most importantly, articles about the
proper handling of maritime disputes, exercising self-restraint and
enhancing military confidence-building go far beyond the scope of
UNCLOS. In this sense, **[[the DOC and]{.mark} the [COC]{.mark} would
not only [serve peace and stability]{.mark} in the region, [but also
develop the law of the sea]{.mark} in the modern day.]{.underline}**

[The DOC, upon 20 years of implementation, has been one of the best
practices that pools valuable experience of regional countries in
dealing with complex issues]{.underline}. As long as the regional
countries firmly commit to the spirit of the DOC, adhere to deepening
dialogue and cooperation for the vision of building a community with a
shared future for all, a high-quality COC will be inked in the near
future and [[the]{.mark} South China [Sea will stay as a sea of peace,
friendship and cooperation.]{.mark}]{.underline}

### AT: CGTO\-\--No Impact\-\--China\-\--1AR

#### No China war.

Susan **Thornton 22**. Senior Fellow at the Paul Tsai China Center at
Yale Law School, 2022, "The Barriers to War,"
https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/china/2022-02-11/china-strategy-rival-americas-making

[There are]{.underline} a number of formidable
**[[restraints]{.underline}]{.mark}** in place [to keep]{.underline} the
**[peace]{.underline}**. The United States has worked hard over the
decades to build these barriers-often as part of the very engagement
strategy that Mearsheimer criticizes. These [bulwarks]{.underline} have
helped preserve peace and [[promote prosperity for]{.mark} the
last]{.underline} **[[70 years]{.underline}]{.mark}**, [and
[they]{.mark} are **still strong enough**]{.underline} [to
[prevent]{.mark} a **U.S.-Chinese [conflict]{.mark}**]{.underline}.
Although [[accidents]{.underline}]{.mark} or incidents connected to
military brinkmanship may occur, they [[would]{.underline}]{.mark}
almost certainly [[**not** lead to]{.mark} a **wider
[war]{.mark}**]{.underline}. [That would require]{.underline} something
exceedingly unlikely: the **[simultaneous failure]{.underline}** [of
every restraint]{.underline}.

First, **[bilateral [diplomacy]{.mark}]{.underline}** [would have to
break down]{.underline}. Engagement is the opposite of estrangement,
which describes the absence of U.S.-Chinese relations from 1949 to 1972.
The purpose of [engagement]{.underline} is to [[forestall
**misperceptions**]{.mark}, provide **reassurance**]{.underline}, [and
**prevent conflict**]{.underline}. It is true that diplomacy and
communication between China and the United States have been anemic for
the past five years. And it is difficult to discern authoritative policy
amid the current cacophony of diplomatic posturing on Twitter and
elsewhere, creating an environment ripe for confusion and overreaction.
But these [deficiencies]{.underline} are not structural; they [can be
remedied]{.underline}. If [top-level **[leaders]{.mark}**]{.underline}
in both countries [consistently [communicate]{.mark}]{.underline} and
work to reduce public posturing, as they should, then the diplomatic
barriers to war can be reinforced.

For a war to break out, [the]{.underline} **[international
system]{.underline}** [would also have to fail]{.underline}. China and
the United States are connected to a [**global [network]{.mark}**
[of]{.mark} countries and [institutions]{.mark} that
[have]{.mark}]{.underline} a stake-in some cases, [[a]{.mark}n
**existential [stake]{.mark}**]{.underline}-[in preventing
conflict]{.underline} between these two countries. Almost [[every
government]{.underline}]{.mark} and institution on the globe would be
grievously damaged by a U.S.-Chinese war, and so they all
[[would]{.underline}]{.mark} try to [[prevent]{.underline}]{.mark} an
imminent [[conflict through]{.underline}]{.mark} [**diplomatic
pressure**, [**mediation**, or]{.mark}]{.underline} acts of
**[[resistance]{.underline}]{.mark}**, [such as denying overflight and
basing rights]{.underline}. Critics may be quick to deny the influence
of others in heading off a major-power clash. But in the current
international system, there is no way for either side to emerge
victorious, and those outside China and the United States would see this
most clearly.

Then there is the restraint created by
[[globalization]{.underline}]{.mark}. Mearsheimer argues that it was a
catastrophic mistake for the United States to help China grow wealthy,
as its resulting strength will inevitably lead it to challenge the
United States. But it is also plausible that the inextricably integrated
nature of the global economy, and specifically of the Chinese and U.S.
economies, [[makes]{.mark} any [war **unwinnable**]{.mark}]{.underline}
[and]{.underline} thus [acts as a **deterrent**]{.underline} [to
conflic]{.underline}t. It is true, as critics will point out, that
economic dependencies failed to prevent World War I. But the economic
relations of the early twentieth century were nothing like the complex
entanglements of today\'s international economic system. In the case of
China and the United States, [they create a situation of mutual assured
**economic destruction**]{.underline}.

[Another]{.underline} restraint [is **public opinion**]{.underline}, at
least on the U.S. side. [[Politicians]{.underline}]{.mark} in the United
States respond to various incentives, but they [[cannot
ignore]{.underline}]{.mark} the sentiments of their
**[[voters]{.underline}]{.mark}**. And [after a 20-year fight against
**terrorism**]{.underline}, [the]{.underline} American [[public
is]{.underline}]{.mark} decidedly [**[wary]{.mark}** of]{.underline}
protracted and costly [overseas conflicts]{.underline}. If U.S.
policymakers appeared poised for a conflict with China, one would also
expect that [[the **press**]{.underline}]{.mark}, having [learned its
lesson from]{.underline} the war in **[Iraq]{.underline}**, [would
[perform]{.mark} its]{.underline} **[[watchdog
function]{.underline}]{.mark}**, question the official narratives, and
activate public concern.

All these barriers should work to prevent a conflict. But if they
somehow didn\'t, [there is [a final **fail-safe**]{.mark}]{.underline}
that [[is]{.underline}]{.mark} even harder to imagine not working:
**[military [deterrence]{.mark}]{.underline}**. Taiwan is the most
likely issue over which a U.S.-Chinese war could break out. But the
quantity and quality of the [weaponry on both sides translates to
certain]{.underline} **[catastrophic losses]{.underline}** for all,
[which should provide a **sufficient deterrent**]{.underline} to war.
And because the devastation of a conflict over Taiwan would spiral out
of control quickly, one cannot rule out the use of nuclear weapons.
Strange as it may sound, that is good news: just as [the **nuclear
age**]{.underline} [prevented direct military conflict]{.underline}
between the Soviet Union and the United States for more than 40 years,
so it should between China and the United States, both of which are
nucleararmed powers [[with survivable **second
strike**]{.underline}]{.mark} [capabilities]{.underline}. Although China
has many fewer missiles and warheads than the United States-something
China is working on remedying-the doctrine of mutually assured
destruction still operates. [The [balance of terror
**holds**]{.mark}]{.underline}.

Looking through this list of potential failures, one might find cause
for pessimism, given that each restraint has seen its share of erosion
in recent years. But [[**China** and the]{.underline}
**[U]{.underline}**]{.mark}nited **[[S]{.underline}]{.mark}**tates are
not prisoners of history. The two countries will find that they cannot
escape one another, and eventually, they [[will]{.underline}]{.mark}
have to [[seek **accommodation**]{.underline}]{.mark}. This may now seem
a distant vision, but [it is a **far more likely**]{.underline} outcome,
given the countervailing currents, [than]{.underline} an [apocalyptic
war]{.underline}.

Allison's interpretation of Thucydides' trap in the contemporary context
has attracted significant critics from IR scholars and drawn
considerable attention from Chinese officials. However, there are still
many disagree- ments with Allison's arguments in academia. First, [it
does not have much value to apply the Thucydides' trap theory to
China--U.S. relations]{.underline} [because this theory **largely
focuses** on the]{.underline} **[economic aspect]{.underline}** [of
power transition]{.underline}. Material power is one of the major
indicators of power transition, so it is necessary to assess whether
China's growth constitutes a threat to the U.S. and the global
community. [[The Thucydides]{.mark} [Trap analogy **is not
relevant**]{.mark}]{.underline} [[to]{.mark} China--U.S.
[relations]{.mark} [before]{.mark} [China]{.mark}]{.underline}
**[significantly [narrows]{.mark}]{.underline}** [[the power]{.mark}
[gap]{.mark} with the U.S. [If the economic]{.mark} driven [theory is
correct]{.mark}]{.underline}[, [tensions]{.underline}]{.mark} [between
China and the U.S. [should]{.mark}]{.underline} [**[keep
growing]{.underline}**]{.mark} [as the Chinese economic power grows
[continuously]{.mark}]{.underline}, [[rather than risen and]{.mark}
[fallen according to actions]{.mark}]{.underline}.2 [The 50-year history
of China--U.S. relations]{.underline} [since the Nixon trip to
Beijing]{.underline} **[does not support the analogy]{.underline}** [of
Thucydides' trap.]{.underline} Second, [[the]{.mark} Thucydides trap
[analogy]{.mark} that great power competition stems from
[fear]{.mark}]{.underline} [[is]{.underline} **[too
simplistic]{.underline}**]{.mark} [to apply to the great power
competition]{.underline}.3 [According to the analogy]{.underline} of
Thucydidus' trap, [the reason for war]{.underline} between a rising
power and the existing power [is that the growth of the rising power
creates]{.underline} **[fears]{.underline}** [of the dominant
power]{.underline}. According to the power transition theory, war most
likely occur when a rising power is about to surpass a declining
hegemonic power, because "the rising power's incen- tives to establish,
and then take advantage of its own rules of the game, more explicitly
conceptualized as status quo dissatisfaction."4 It suggests that "war is
most likely when a dissatisfied challenger increases in strength and
begins to overtake the dominant power."5 [Although China is the world's
second-largest economy]{.underline}, [there are **600 million Chinese
people**]{.underline} [who still live with less than 1000 Chinese
dollars per month]{.underline} (about \$150). [[China is **still a
developing country**]{.underline}]{.mark} [in terms of its per
capita.]{.underline} [[China has a]{.underline} **[long way to
close]{.underline}** [the gap]{.underline}]{.mark} [[between]{.mark}
[the]{.mark} two national [economies]{.mark}]{.underline}. It is not
convincing for now that the rise of China will spell the end of the
Amer- ican era sometime soon. China's current economic challenge is not
as serious as some scholars suggested. [For now, **[no country]{.mark}
including China** [is about to usurp]{.mark} [the U.S.' plac]{.mark}e in
the world in terms of **overall power**]{.underline}.6 Third, [[there is
**not an inevitable connection**]{.mark} [between]{.mark} the
[growth]{.mark} of the rising power [and]{.mark} the [fear]{.mark} of
existing power]{.underline}, [[because]{.underline} [fear derives
from]{.underline}]{.mark} **[[real threats]{.mark} bvc bvv c and
challenges]{.underline}**, so the rising power's growth does not
necessarily pose threat to other countries if the rising country
develops peacefully within the established international system. [To
predict if there will be war between China and the U.S., it is necessary
to evaluate if China's growth constitutes a real threat to the U.S. and
the global community]{.underline}. According to prospect theory, fear
and anxiety contribute to public opinion which influences the
decision-making process of foreign policy. When Allison applies the
analogy to the great power competition, he focuses on the growth in
relative capabilities in each case but misses the more critical factor
which is state behavior.7 Specifically, whether great power competi-
tion is inevitable depends on how both countries set up the objectives
of their foreign policy and how they treat each other. If both countries
are willing to make a necessary compromise and ensure a smooth commu-
nication channel between the two governments, war can be avoided.
Otherwise, war will likely occur in limited areas at a limited level.
Fourth, [it is **not accurate**]{.underline} [to argue that China's
ambition aims to become a regional power rather than a global
hegemony.]{.underline} Allison does not believe China directly
challenges the U.S. but challenges its neigh- boring countries. Andrew
Nathan has also asserted that the CCP does not have the ambition to
overthrow democracy in the U.S. or over- throw global democracy while
Rush Doshi describes Chinese strategic ambition as global which really
threatens the Western way of life.8 [The [regional ambition argument is
**contrary**]{.mark} [to]{.mark} factual [reality]{.mark}]{.underline}.
[China challenges its neighboring countries and **the U.S. as
well**.]{.underline} [[China's aggressive]{.mark} international
[behavior]{.mark} [has]{.mark} already [pushed]{.mark} its [neighboring
countries **away**]{.mark} from China. India, Indonesia, Japan, and
Vietnam are working more closely with the U.S]{.underline}.9 [Chinese
leaders believe that it is time for China to]{.underline} **[promote the
China dream]{.underline}** [based on their worldview]{.underline}, so Xi
has promised that China will become the world superpower by 2049. [[All
of China's action plans]{.mark} including the BRI and Made in China 2025
[aim to **develop a China-centric empire**]{.mark}]{.underline}.
[China's aggressive international behavior demon- strates that China
is]{.underline} **[anxiously]{.underline}** [to become the international
rule maker]{.underline}. In addition, the nature of surplus capital will
drive China to the global market using different measures including
stealing intellectual property rights and government subsidies.
[[Because China knows what]{.mark} [it was like to be]{.mark}
[powerless]{.mark} and humiliated in the nineteenth
century]{.underline}, [[China's]{.mark} military [goal is to **drive the
U.S. out**]{.mark} of the Asia--Pacific]{.underline} [to become
the]{.underline} **[regional dominant power]{.underline}** as a
springboard toward the global dominant power. Now China has economic
might, military strength, and political power, so Beijing sees it is
time to demonstrate that the country can no longer be pushed around.10
[China's long-term plan is to **unseat the U.S.** and replace it as the
world's greatest power.]{.underline}11 Therefore, the U.S. "should not
believe China has so little global ambition or such a benign view of its
relations with the U.S. or its place in the world as the peaceful rise
narrative suggests."12 As early as 2010, Elizabeth Economy noted that
the consensus of the Deng era began to fray and Beijing began to expand
its influence to the rest of the world.13 Fifth, Allison did not offer a
serious discussion on the nuclear dynamics that affects the great power
competition. [Both countries are the largest nuclear powers, so war
between the U.S. and China **seems rather unlikely**]{.underline}.14
China continues to rapidly expand its nuclear arsenal and could have
1000 nuclear warheads by 2030. [[Nuclear]{.mark} [deterrence plays a
**significant role i**n maintaining]{.mark} a manageable great power
[competition]{.mark}.]{.underline} According to the realist view of IR,
[the greater the imbalance, the greater is the risk of war]{.underline}.
If the U.S. rejects geopolitical accommodation while maintaining
military superiority, the great power conflicts are likely to intensify.
According to Peter Rudol, the likelihood of a military conflict is seen
as greatest when a nonsaturated challenger's military power comes close
to the leading military power. Thus, the core idea of the "Thucydides
trap" is problematic, and the explanatory value is controversial.15

The Return of Naval Arms Races

Fourth, in addition to a direct conflict over Taiwan, [the other
concerning trend in the American-Chinese military balance of power is
the **PLA's [naval]{.mark} buildup**]{.underline}. Implementing a
great-power competition--focused [defense]{.underline} strategy
[requires the U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates [to maintain
**[dominance]{.mark}** over]{.underline} [its **main rival** in this
area of **military competition**]{.underline}. [Dominance is
[key]{.mark} [for **ensuring Beijing**]{.mark}]{.underline}
[[cannot]{.mark} militarily [conquer]{.mark} or coerce [its
neighbors]{.mark}]{.underline} or challenge the United States for global
hegemony in the military domain. Maintaining "command of the sea" is a
strategic necessity in terms of ensuring China cannot become a true peer
rival of the United States in the decades to come. [The
Indo-Pacific,]{.underline} the most strategically important region for
the United States, [is]{.underline} fundamentally **[a maritime
theater]{.underline}**, from a military operational planning point of
view. [Any Chinese attempt to establish hegemony by force in Taiwan or
the South China Sea will involve intense naval combat against the US
Navy and its allies.]{.underline}

[[The PLA's ambition to push the US Navy out of Asia]{.mark}
is]{.underline} arguably [its most **important military**]{.underline}
[**operational** goal, as it **[would]{.mark}** [make]{.mark} its
**[invasion of Taiwan]{.mark}**]{.underline} [and its de facto regional
hegemony **[all but certain]{.mark}**]{.underline}, [which is
why]{.underline}, in turn, [America's **main goal** must be to **counter
it.**]{.underline} Moreover, **[Beijing's]{.underline}** [assertive
global naval presence]{.underline} in the last few years [is
increasingly]{.underline} [concerning]{.underline} for the United
States, as most recently evidenced by China's basing agreement with the
Pacific nation of Solomon Islands.19

In addition to the Western Pacific theater, China's naval presence
allows it to interfere with the United States in its backyard in Latin
America. As US Secretary of the Navy Carlos Del Toro warned:

The Chinese are everywhere: they're down the Pacific coast of Central
and South America, they're down the West Coast of Africa, for example,
and it's so important for us to be able to continue to engage with our
maritime partners around the world to better understand why is it their
countries are making the investments they're making.20

More important than its global presence is that [the PLA
Navy]{.underline} "[consistently attempts to violate the **maritime
sovereignty**]{.underline} and economic well-being of other nations,
[including our allies in the **South China Sea** and
**elsewhere**."21]{.underline}

The [recent **trends**]{.underline} [in the **naval balance** of power
between the PLA Navy and the US Navy reveal a dangerous level of
risk:]{.underline} the [US **[maritime supremacy]{.mark}** is
**[waning]{.mark}**]{.underline}, or, worse, the United States has
already lost the "command of the seas" to the Chinese, as former
Congressman and retired Rear Admiral Joe Sestak provocatively stated in
a 2020 article. Indeed, although war-fighting capabilities are measured
by more than just numbers, [the [Chinese nav]{.mark}y has
[surpassed]{.mark} the [US]{.mark} Navy in its **number** of
**[ships]{.mark}**]{.underline} [and]{.underline}, by some estimates,
[is scheduled to reach **400 ships** by **2030**]{.underline}, compared
to approximately 300 for the United States. Moreover, [**China's
[shipyards]{.mark}** [have]{.mark} a much **[larger capacity]{.mark}**
than American ones]{.underline}.22

Unsurprisingly given these numbers, INDOPACOM head Davidson testified
before Congress in 2018 that "[[**China** is]{.mark} now [**capable** of
**controlling**]{.mark} [the S]{.mark}outh [C]{.mark}hina [S]{.mark}ea
in all **scenarios** short of **war** with the **U**nited
**S**tates]{.underline}" [and]{.underline} that "[there is **no
guarantee** that the United States would win a **future conflict** with
**China**]{.underline}." Moreover, as Bruce D. Jones of the Brookings
Institution shows in his latest book, China's naval ambitions expanded
from operating in its own littoral to global projects, like exploring
the Arctic or Indian Oceans, laying undersea cables, and building a
network of global ports. Lastly, as PLA Navy expert Toshi Yoshihara
warned, "Chinese strategists envision future naval combat as 'extremely
intense, extremely lethal, and very quick,' involving the launch of
'hundreds of missiles by both sides within about ten minutes' that could
destroy an entire fleet in an afternoon." [Therefore, the US Navy must
prepare for a level of **high-intensity conflict**]{.underline}
unmatched since World War II.23

To counteract China's naval buildup, the Pentagon should first shift
resources from other parts of the US military not directly involved in a
China fight (like the ground forces, mainly the Army) to the Navy to
fund the 367 ships that are part of its "unconstrained" 30-year
shipbuilding plan.24 [The Navy should]{.underline}, in turn, [reform to
optimize for great-power competition and the **Indo-Pacific
theater**]{.underline}. For example, a group of experts from the
Pentagon-funded think tank Center for Strategic and Budgetary
Assessments recommends:

Instead of mainly operating in CSGs \[Carrier Strike Groups\] and ARGs
\[Amphibious Ready Groups\], naval forces should be separated into
forward-postured Deterrence Forces of submarines, surface combatants,
and unmanned vehicles that rely on missiles for defensive and offensive
fires; CSGs and ARGs should be postured in a Maneuver Force outside
littoral areas such as the East and South China Seas or Mediterranean.25

This recommendation implies the Navy should abandon or reconfigure the
traditional geographical basing of its fleets to reflect the new
priorities by shifting more aircraft carriers to the Pacific theater and
away from the Middle East and Persian Gulf, the Atlantic, and the
Mediterranean.

Confronting Fiscal Realities and Budgetary Constraints

Fifth and last, the US defense budget and force allocations must reflect
the emphasis on containing China. Although at the level of rhetoric and
National Security Strategy documents China is considered the main
priority, this prioritization has arguably not yet fully permeated the
decision-making and budgetary processes inside the national security
establishment, which still overreact to daily headlines or legacy
commitments to NATO or the Middle East.

Evidence of this lack of the necessary laser-focus attention on China
abounds. For example, Washington sent so many weapons to Ukraine that it
depleted its stockpiles of advanced weapons, as noted above. Similarly,
Congress appropriated a \$40 billion aid package to Ukraine larger than
Australia's or Italy's entire defense budget. And when Iran seized
foreign oil tankers in summer 2023, as they often do, the Department of
Defense rushed to send more warships and marines to the area to deter
this behavior. Spending these precious resources in the European or
Middle Eastern theaters would be fine if the United States would still
benefit from what defense analysts call "overmatch" in the Asian
theater, but that is not the case anymore. Moreover, Russia's military
limitations were made obvious during its recent botched invasion of
Ukraine. Moscow's military inability to pursue hegemony over Eastern
Europe should make it easier for the United States to outsource European
security to other NATO members and focus on the main priority, China's
PLA.26

A great-power competition--oriented grand strategy, unlike the current
internationalist strategy of defending the rules-based order, does not
require higher levels of defense spending but rather a divestment of
some commitments in Europe and the Middle East to free up resources for
preparing to fight the PLA. The Marathon Initiative think tank analyzed
three scenarios:

keeping defense spending about the same,

decreasing it by 10 percent, and

increasing it by 9.5 percent.27

Its study then shows how a strategy of denial could be financed with the
current level of defense spending, assuming some cuts are made to
programs not essential for a Taiwan scenario (mostly Army programs and
United States European Command resources) and that those funds are used
for Navy, Air Force, and INDOPACOM requirements.28 Table 1 shows the
report's specific proposed cuts and additions.

\[Table Omitted\]

Therefore, the realist strategy of "defense by denial" could be
resourced within the current level of defense spending scheduled to
increase by 3.6 percent over the five-year Future Years Defense Program
(FYDP). Defensive realists at places like the Quincy Institute for
Responsible Statecraft would prefer a decrease in spending, while
conservative internationalists at places like the American Enterprise
Institute would prefer an increase in spending. Increasingly, liberal
internationalists are also advocating for an increase in spending and
have been since the Russia-Ukraine War began. Reducing defense spending
in an era of heightened geopolitical competition would be shortsighted,
particularly as China is constantly increasing its military power. Given
the ever-larger debt threatening the US economy and the dollar as a
reserve currency, however, increasing defense spending would not be
optimal, either, because domestic politics considerations mean an
increase will worsen the deficit (as opposed to being financed by
cutting other types of discretionary spending).

Conclusion

The top defense policymakers must make the tough calls needed to adapt
military strategic planning for the new era of great-power competition
now. [The unipolar era of US military global hegemony is over.
I]{.underline}n the emerging multipolar world, the United States does
not have the luxury of avoiding painful trade-offs between competing
priorities in various regions of the world. Moreover, the US advantage
in high-end conventional warfare can no longer be taken for granted; as
the war in Ukraine shows, new tactics and technologies, such as
ubiquitous cheap drones, pose unique and unexpected challenges to the
conduct of conventional military operations.

[The military balance of power has been **shifting steadily** in
**China's** favor in **East Asia,** and [Beijing]{.mark} has
[often]{.mark} [stated]{.mark} that it [desires to]{.mark} **establish
itself** as a regional hegemon by **controlling** the South China
Sea]{.underline} [and]{.underline} **[[bring]{.mark}ing
[Taiwan]{.mark}]{.underline}** [[under]{.mark} its [control]{.mark}.
China's ambition represents [the]{.mark}]{.underline} [[greatest]{.mark}
**grand-strategic [threat]{.mark}** [to **US
security**]{.mark}]{.underline} and prosperity [because losing control
of Asia to the Chinese Communist Party would mean **losing global
superpower status**.]{.underline} [High-level strategy documents and
speeches]{.underline} in Washington often [repeat this
assessment]{.underline}. [Without]{.underline} [the strategic
planning]{.underline} needed [to shift **defense
investments**]{.underline} and force employment choices according to
great-power competition requirements, [however, the United States runs
the risk of failing to **prevent** an **avoidable strategic
disaster**.]{.underline}

Restraint Variable 4: The Future Balance of Power

The general context for a potential closing window of opportunity is set
by the plateauing of the Chinese economy and the likelihood it will not
be able to fully exploit the current military-technical revolution due
to export controls. [These trends suggest that, over the long term,
[**time** may **not be** on **China's side**]{.mark}]{.underline}. What
about in the shorter term? [There is good reason to see relative Chinese
military power as peaking this decade]{.underline}. **[[Despite]{.mark}
the increasing [alarm]{.mark}]{.underline}** animating both military and
civilian analysts, [by some metrics [U.S. military power]{.mark} is
**[actually declining]{.mark}** this **decade** due to where the United
States is in its **modernization cycles**.]{.underline}

[This is [especially **true** of the **Navy**]{.mark}]{.underline}.
[According to the C]{.underline}ongressional [B]{.underline}udget
[O]{.underline}ffice, which analyzed three possible plans submitted to
Congress by the Department of Defense for 2023: "[the
**[lethality]{.mark}** of the **fleet**]{.underline}, as measured in
part by the total number of missile cells, [would [decline by **13
percent**]{.mark} until **2032**]{.underline}." This number includes
both vertical launch cells and torpedo tubes. The falling numbers for
this decade contrast in particular with the numbers projected after the
2020s, when "the number of torpedo tubes would increase, compared with
the number in today's fleet, by 40 percent to 50 percent."

The Air Force, in contrast, does not face such a drastic decline in
lethality, but the most significant system it is investing in for modern
peer-on-peer warfare, the B-21, will not be available in mass until the
2030s. The B-21 will recapitalize capability that has atrophied over
decades, as the Air Force became centered around short-range fighters
not particularly suited to stopping a Chinese invasion of Taiwan.

For their parts, the Marine Corps and Army are both modernizing their
force structures and training to be more relevant for the Taiwan "pacing
scenario," and by the 2030s both are likely to possess significant new
formations and capabilities. At the same time, the results of Japan
moving defense spending from 1 percent of GDP to 2 percent will begin to
be felt, too, as will rising defense budgets and longer conscription
terms in Taiwan.

[The Chinese government,]{.underline} of course, [will not stand still
throughout the 2020s.]{.underline} Certainly, more Renhai Cruisers and
J-20 fighters will be commissioned. But such incremental Chinese
progress will not change the overall pattern, which is that China has
mostly completed a modernization cycle begun in the late 1990s, while
the United States is still in the midst of one. [A
**[reinvigorated]{.mark} U.S. [Navy]{.mark} increasingly
[centered]{.mark}** [on]{.mark}]{.underline}
**[[submarines]{.underline}]{.mark}** [and]{.underline} [smaller
**combatants**]{.underline} [[instead of]{.mark} **hugely expensive**
and potentially vulnerable aircraft [carriers]{.mark}]{.underline}, [an
Air Force with long-range bombers, and a Marine Corps and Army with
**long-range missiles** and dispersible capabilities [poses a]{.mark}
much [more]{.mark} **[significant threat]{.mark}** [to an **invading
Chinese force**]{.mark} than exists today]{.underline} --- [or this
decade.]{.underline}

In all, the combination of eroding constraints and loosening restraints
is a toxic mix, implying that whatever might have been doing the heavy
lifting of dissuading China's leaders from invading Taiwan in the past
is likely not operating today. [Given the high probability for major
provocations relating to the Taiwan issue going forward,]{.underline}
especially as Taiwan's Democratic Progressive Party enters an
unprecedented third presidential term in a row, and that fact that two
recent pollssuggest that more than half of China's population already
support armed unification, [the upshot is that the Chinese leadership is
becoming **less likely** to **act** with **restraint** compared to the
past.]{.underline}

[[Naval power **matters**]{.mark} **today [more]{.mark} than ever**
because of how modern societies' relationship with the sea]{.underline}
has [evolved]{.underline}. [Today we live in a **maritime
century**]{.underline}, one in which [the **very foundations**
of]{.underline} the [prosperity that underwrites open economies rests
upon maritime **physical and digital connectivity**]{.underline}.
[Sea-lanes feed us]{.underline}, [keep us warm]{.underline}, and
[deliver]{.underline} the [furniture of daily life]{.underline}. Some
[97% of the internet]{.underline}, [and]{.underline} a [**major
portion** of **international energy use**]{.underline}, [relies
on]{.underline} an [undersea]{.underline} spaghetti bowl of [cables and
pipelines that closely mirror **commercial shipping
routes**]{.underline}. This multilayered network of physical and digital
connectivity is safe and reliable only until it is not. In recent years,
places as diverse as Somalia, Tonga, the U.K., and Taiwan have
experienced economic losses because of disruptions to critical undersea
infrastructure. By the beginning of this year, the relatively
sophisticated capabilities of Yemen's Houthis exposed just how
vulnerable the steady supply of basic commodities --- from tea bags to
the average household in Britain, to core components of electric cars
across Europe --- can be. This [**unprecedented [reliance]{.mark}** on
maritime connectivity]{.underline} has [[made]{.mark} **activities at
[sea]{.mark}** [a **primary target**]{.mark} of authoritarian
regimes]{.underline} and non-state groups. Actions such as the sabotage
of the Nord Stream 2 pipeline, the gas pipeline linking Estonia,
Finland, and Sweden, or the disruption to international shipping caused
by Houthi missiles and drones share one thing. These [actions
highlight]{.underline} a [[realization]{.mark} on **behalf of leaders**
[in **Moscow**]{.mark}]{.underline}, **[[Beijing]{.underline}]{.mark}**,
[and **[Tehran]{.mark}**]{.underline} that [**[maritime]{.mark}
connectivity** [is]{.mark} a [**pressure point** with]{.mark}
**significant [political value]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Countries like
[China]{.underline}, in particular, are [pursuing]{.underline} the
[naval means to seize]{.underline} the [opportunities]{.underline}
emerging from such a realization. Whether in the field of technologies
for deep seabed exploration and exploitation, shipping capacity, and,
above all, in the context of sheer naval might, China is setting new
records in both quantity and quality of its investments. In the last
decade alone, China has added over twice the number of ships to its
surface fleet than what the entire French navy commands. **[[Chinese
authorities understand]{.underline}]{.mark}** that, [in]{.underline} a
[maritime century]{.underline}, its **[ongoing [naval]{.mark}
build-up]{.underline}** is a [[downpayment for]{.mark} maritime
superiority]{.underline}, if not [[supremacy]{.underline}]{.mark},
[[in]{.mark} a **potential major [war]{.mark}** [in the]{.mark} China
[seas]{.mark}]{.underline}, in the [strait of
[Taiwan]{.mark}]{.underline}, [[or beyond]{.underline}]{.mark}. Xi
Jinping's appointment of Hu Zhongming, an operationally experienced
submariner, at the helm of the navy confirms that a new generation of
flag officers is entrusted to deliver readiness if ever needed. This is
why [[navies matter]{.mark} and]{.underline} why the [U.S.]{.underline}
and [[allies]{.mark} in Europe and Asia are **[actively]{.mark}
debating** how to [invest]{.mark} in them]{.underline}. Leaders in
countries like Japan and Australia are investing in their navies, from
counterstrike to surface, carrier, and submarine projection
capabilities, so that they can collectively meet the growing
authoritarian challenge at sea. That includes Japan unveiling in
December 2023 its largest defense budget in its post-war history, and
Australia, which is already procuring nuclear-powered submarines through
AUKUS, announcing last month plans to double its surface fleet. However,
others, like the U.S. and Britain, are finding it harder to meet growing
naval demands. In the U.S., the navy will ask for only one Virginia
class submarine for the next fiscal year budget instead of two, because
of the limits of industrial capacity. In Britain, a recent parliamentary
report noted how plans to introduce several new classes of ships needs
more shipyards first. [In]{.underline} a **[contested maritime
century]{.underline}**, [we should]{.underline} start [thinking about
[navies]{.mark} as [the **ultimate**]{.mark} **national security
[insurance policy]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Like any insurance, they
[[demand **regular investments**]{.underline}]{.mark} against risks that
are unlikely but potentially grave. [Navies]{.underline} work best to
[[deter]{.mark} **would-be [aggression]{.mark}**]{.underline}, but the
[industrial base to generate]{.underline} their [capabilities
[underwrites]{.mark} **military [credibility]{.mark}**]{.underline}.
Crucially, [when all else fails]{.underline}, that [credibility **stands
to make certain**]{.underline} that [in]{.underline} the [hour of

\"[Given the shipbuilding challenges]{.underline}, the budget situation,
and challenges with recruiting and retention, [[the Navy]{.mark} is at a
crossroads as it [faces]{.mark} rapidly [evolving threats from]{.mark}
peer **[adversaries]{.mark}**, such as **China**]{.underline},\" Shelby
Oakley, a director in the US Government Accountability Office who
oversees the office\'s investigations of Navy shipbuilding, told
Business Insider.

Why is so much warship work behind schedule and over budget?

The US shipbuilding industry is a shadow of what it was in the final
years of the Cold War. The Navy is reliant on only a handful of major
shipbuilders that design and construct different ship classes:
Huntington Ingalls Industries (aircraft carriers, submarines, amphibious
ships, destroyers), General Dynamics (submarines, destroyers, support
ships), and Fincantieri Marinette Marine Corporation (frigates). Higher
production rates would require infrastructure costs and a larger
workforce. Repair and maintenance are likewise constrained by the few
public yards available.

A Department of the Navy review earlier this year found that top US Navy
shipbuilding projects, from new submarines to surface ships, are delayed
by years and facing ballooning costs.

The longest project delays, expected to be at least three years, are for
the coming Block IV Virginia-class attack submarines and the
Constellation-class guided-missile frigate. [The Navy\'s first
**[Columbia]{.mark}-class** ballistic **missile
[submarine]{.mark}**]{.underline}, a priority for the Pentagon, [isn\'t
expected to arrive until 12 to 16 months after its **planned
delivery**]{.underline}, [potentially [leaving a hole in **readiness
plans**]{.mark} [for the **nation\'s nuclear**]{.mark}
**[forces]{.mark}**]{.underline}. And the Navy\'s next Ford-class
carrier, USS Enterprise, faces a delay of 18 to 26 months.

Navy officials, analysts, and industry figures attribute delays to a
range of challenges, including a lack of coordination among the
stakeholders, inconsistent defense budgets, shifting Navy requirements,
the lasting impacts of COVID-19, inflation, a dwindling workforce, and
supply-chain issues.

Other factors include backlogs and program mismanagement on top of a
shrunken industry where sole-source suppliers are awarded projects with
limited market competition. Shipbuilders, dependent on materials from
overseas, are regularly left waiting for parts to arrive, and
pre-pandemic contracts are now out of sync with the current economy.

Oakley said that the GAO had observed consistent issues with Navy cost
estimates, which \"are often lacking and the assumptions unrealistic.\"

Shipbuilders begin work before designs are finished, resulting in
out-of-sync work, but the Navy\'s budget doesn\'t adjust for cost
increases and extended schedules. That reduces \"the Navy\'s buying
power\" and contributes \"to program instability,\" Oakley said.

That leaves the industry in an uncertain position. Paula Zorensky, the
vice president of the Shipbuilders Council of America, told BI that
while shipyards make long-term investments to meet the Navy\'s demands,
the Navy has pulled back on planned programs. \"That inconsistent demand
signal contributes to uncertainty in the industrial base, which was
already contending with broader economic challenges of inflation, delays
caused by the pandemic, and other economic factors,\" she said.

The Navy has consistently encountered problems building the fleet of at
least 355 ships it has said it needs. Challenges with new technologies
bogged down the first-in-class aircraft carrier USS Gerald R. Ford; the
Zumwalt class was cut to just three stealth destroyers and left without
ammo for its main guns; and the flawed littoral combat ships are already
being decommissioned even though some of them have been in service for
just a few years.

readiness for conflict. Petty Officer 1st Class Alex Smedegard

The Navy\'s push toward increasingly advanced designs and platforms has,
in some ways, contributed to issues as well, Bryan Clark, a former Navy
officer who\'s now a defense expert at the Hudson Institute, told BI.
\"If you look at it, pretty much every class of warship the Navy\'s
building right now is behind schedule, and that\'s because the
requirements have grown faster than the shipyard\'s capacity to deliver
them.\"

It\'s a complex problem that the Navy is dealing with as it also
struggles to maintain and repair its existing fleet. While the submarine
force is seen as critical to US combat power in the Pacific, it was
reported in 2023 that 40% of the 49 submarines available at the time
were idling, waiting for maintenance due to worker shortages and
supply-chain problems.

Mackenzie Eaglen, a senior fellow at the American Enterprise Institute,
wrote in September that the Navy needed to break what she called the
\"doom loop.\" Costs for shipbuilding, maintenance, and repairs continue
to rise as the fleet ages and shrinks and new construction issues arise.
And while the Navy criticizes shipbuilders, shipbuilders are lamenting
the rising costs of wages, inflationary pressures, and budget
uncertainty.

What does that mean in a war?

The US Navy has not been in a naval war since World War II, when its
shipbuilders rapidly expanded the fleet to 6,768 ships, eight times what
the Navy had at the time of the Pearl Harbor attack, by the war\'s end,
overcoming the losses of high-end naval combat. Many naval experts say
the US couldn\'t do anything like that today.

\"When inevitable combat damage occurs, we may not have the capacity to
get ships back into the fight,\" Bryan McGrath, a retired naval officer
and the managing director of The FerryBridge Group LLC, told BI.

The GAO reported in 2021 that battle-damage repair capabilities would be
critical in a fight against a peer or near-peer adversary, especially if
the US cannot build new ships or replace ones lost in battle, but that
is lacking. The agency reported that \"battle damage repairs may further
exacerbate\" the \"ongoing shipyard challenges to keep up with regular
maintenance demand,\" only making things worse.

China has pursued a substantial naval buildup and the capacity to
replace lost vessels or repair damaged ones by making shipbuilding a
national priority. Unclassified US Navy data suggests China has 230
times the US capacity. Much of its strength there comes from its
commercial shipbuilding, which shares yards and resources with its
military.

Shipyards like Dalian in northeastern China, Huangpu Wenchong near Hong
Kong, and the Jiangnan and Hudong-Zhonghua yards near Shanghai are all
operated by subsidiaries of the state-owned China State Shipbuilding
Corporation. Together with other yards, they are delivering on Chinese
national defense ambitions while also dominating commercial
shipbuilding.

\"I don\'t even think they\'re really playing the same game, to be
honest with you,\" Matthew Funaiole, a senior fellow with the China
Power Project at the Center for Strategic and International Studies,
told BI. While the US has struggled in recent decades, losing its edge
in the commercial shipbuilding industry to foreign competitors that can
build cheaper, China\'s expansion has made it the global shipbuilding
leader.

An important debate centers on quality versus quantity. China has the
numbers, but the US still maintains more advanced, combat-proven
warships. It is an \"indisputable fact that US warships are the envy of
the world, that no other nation on Earth comes close to our ability to
field incredibly powerful, networked, and survivable warships,\" said
McGrath, who commanded the destroyer USS Bulkeley.

Fixing the US Navy\'s shipbuilding problems starts with the workers,
agency analysts say

But that edge is not guaranteed. In 2020, the US Office of Naval
Intelligence said China\'s ships were increasingly comparable to US
ships. Technological advances will likely strain China\'s shipyards as
they have US yards. And with a much younger fleet, China\'s maintenance
and repair capacity hasn\'t really been put to the test yet, but that
younger fleet also means it isn\'t grappling with some of the challenges
the US is facing.

How does the US fix this?

shipbuilding problems. US Navy photo by Mass Communication Specialist
Seaman Erwinjacob Miciano/Released

The US Navy\'s shipbuilding woes aren\'t new, and there simply isn\'t a
quick fix.

Earlier this year, Adm. Lisa Franchetti, the chief of naval operations,
said that the force needed to be ready for the possibility of a war with
China by 2027, which is when the US has assessed Beijing has ordered its
military to be ready to seize Taiwan. That date does not mean conflict
is inevitable; it\'s a benchmark.

While it\'s impossible for the Navy to catch up to China\'s shipbuilding
might by then, Franchetti has suggested the focus should be on readying
current platforms and fixing maintenance issues. Autonomous systems are
also a priority for the Department of Defense and could shape how the US
fights China. Beijing, too, is working on similar systems.

The US Navy fights as part of a joint force, one that has been investing
in anti-ship capabilities, intermediate-range fires, and other measures
to blunt China\'s edge.

But in the long term, **[[experts]{.underline}]{.mark}** and analysts
[have [said the US needs]{.mark} to make significant [investments
in]{.mark} [rejuvenating]{.mark} its **military [shipbuilding]{.mark}**
**capabilities** and **capacity**]{.underline}, [ramp up production, and

### AT: CGTO\-\--No Impact\-\--Fishing\-\--2AC/1AR

#### Fishery disputes are [small]{.underline} AND [won't escalate]{.underline}.

Ragnar **Arnason 21**. Professor, Economics, University of Iceland,
\"Economics of Fisheries Conflicts,\" in Oxford Research Encyclopedia of
Environmental Science, 04/26/2021, Oxford.

It is well established that [[if]{.underline}]{.mark} valuable
[resources are [subject to]{.mark}]{.underline} **[sufficiently
strong]{.underline}** [[property rights]{.underline}
**[conflicts]{.underline}**]{.mark} [over their use
[are]{.mark}]{.underline} [**[greatly]{.underline}**
[diminished]{.underline}]{.mark} and the use of the resources are
reasonably close to being Pareto efficient (optimal) (Arnason, 2007;
Scott, 2008). The social institution of [property rights]{.underline}
has [worked]{.underline} **[very well]{.underline}** in land-based
resource use. It doesn't require much contemplation to realize that
[property rights are [the]{.mark}]{.underline}
[**[cornerstone]{.underline}** [of]{.underline}]{.mark} [modern-day
[economic affluence]{.mark}]{.underline}.17

In the ocean, however, and most other water bodies, the system of
property rights is much less developed. This applies not the least to
the living aquatic resources such as fish stocks and other aquatic
biota. Therefore, in the absence of property rights, these resources, if
at all valuable, give rise to simmering conflicts with occasional
flare-ups and generally very costly misuse.

It stands to reason that [if a]{.underline} **[system]{.underline}** [of
property rights in]{.underline} **[aquatic resources]{.underline}**,
similar to that for terrestrial resources, were established,
[**[fisheries]{.underline}** [conflicts]{.underline}]{.mark} and other
aquatic conflicts [would be]{.underline} much [**[reduced]{.underline}**
[and]{.underline}]{.mark}, at the same time,
[**[efficiency]{.underline}** [in]{.underline}]{.mark} [the [use of
aquatic resources]{.mark} would be]{.underline}
**[[increased]{.underline}]{.mark}**. There are two obstacles to this
solution, however. First the property rights technology for aquatic
resources is much less developed than for land resources. For instance,
there is, as yet, no inexpensive way to identify individual fish as
belonging to an owner or even to keep wild fish within a given enclosed
area. Second, it should not be forgotten that property rights are a
social institution. To establish them in particular resources requires
sufficient social support. In fact, as human history informs us, the
extension of the system of property rights to new resources been
generally marked by conflicts, clashes, fights, and wars. While property
rights may reduce conflicts over resource use, attempts to establish
these property rights create their own conflicts.

In spite of this, the [past several centuries]{.underline} have
[[witness]{.mark}ed [a]{.mark}]{.underline} creeping
**[[expansion]{.mark} of property rights]{.underline}** [[in]{.mark}
ocean and aquatic resources]{.underline}. The [most
noticeable]{.underline} of these developments [have been]{.underline}
(a) the **[enlargement]{.underline}** [of]{.underline} exclusive
national economic zones (**[[EEZs]{.underline}]{.mark}**)
[and]{.underline} (b) [the establishment of]{.underline} **[individual
harvesting rights]{.underline}**, the [so-called]{.underline} individual
and individual transferable quotas ([**[IQs]{.underline}**
[and]{.underline} **[ITQs]{.underline}**]{.mark}). The former, the
enlargement of EEZs, is a process that has been going on for centuries.
The IQ/ITQs are a much more recent phenomenon emerging in the 1970s.18
However, since this time, the application of ITQs in ocean fisheries has
expanded very fast. According to a recent count, over 25% of the global
ocean catch was taken under ITQ or ITQ-like systems (Arnason, 2013). It
should be noted that an extension of the national EEZ is often a
prerequisite for the introduction of ITQs.19

EEZs may be seen as national property rights. Provided they are
respected, the [establishment of EEZs]{.underline} **[[virtually
eliminates]{.underline}]{.mark}** [international [conflicts]{.mark}
over]{.underline} the [fisheries]{.underline} and other aquatic
resources within their confines. EEZs fail, however, to eliminate
conflict over fish stocks that straddle the EEZ boundary or periodically
migrate outside the EEZ. Such transboundary or migratory fish stocks
remain a source of conflicts between fishing nations. According to
established law of the sea, specifically the UN Fish Stocks Agreement
(Bjørndal & Munro, 2003; United Nations, 1995), in such cases the
[[nations]{.underline}]{.mark} fishing from the stocks [should [form
a]{.mark}]{.underline} [**[RFMO]{.underline}**]{.mark} (Regional
Fisheries Management Organization) to coordinate the fishing activity.
[Several]{.underline} such [RFMOs have been established]{.underline}
**[[around the world]{.underline}]{.mark}**, [managing]{.underline}
**[over 150 species]{.underline}** (Cullis-Suzuki & Pauly, 2010). While
these [RFMOs]{.underline} seem to have reduced or at least
**[[defused]{.underline}]{.mark}** [international fisheries
[conflict]{.mark}s]{.underline}, they have apparently proven quite
ineffective in efficiently managing the fish stocks within their purview
(Cullis-Suzuki & Pauly, 2010; Salenius & Arnason, 2020).

Properly designed IQs and ITQs provide the holder with a right to a
certain share of the total allowable catch (TAC) every fishing season
(usually a year). This largely removes the competition between fishers
for catch and, therefore, a good part of the resulting conflicts.
Moreover, it provides each ITQ holder with an incentive to move the fish
stocks to their most productive level (because this maximizes the value
of his ITQ). Furthermore, because of ITQ tradability, ITQ systems tend
to bring about the most efficient number and configuration of fishers in
the fishery. The less efficient fishers tend to trade their quota rights
to the more efficient ones, thus receiving a share in their greater
efficiency in the form of a monetary payment. As a result, ITQs promote
efficiency in fishing. Note that this applies to all types of fishers:
commercial, subsistence, and recreational ones, as well as their
subgroups, such as high-technology and low-technology fishers,
large-scale and small-scale ones, and so on. In summary, for all types
of fishers, ITQs may be said to resolve a substantial part of fisheries
conflicts in an efficient way.

It is important to realize, however, that ITQs are only harvesting
rights, that is, property rights in harvesting. As a result, they do not
resolve fisheries conflicts that do not directly involve harvesting,
such as competition for landing spots, ocean space to access high fish
densities, and so on. This is because these conflicts are about other
resources, that is, landings facilities in the first case and ocean
space in the second, while the ITQs are merely property rights in
harvest quantity. It is another matter that these types of fisheries
conflicts usually become less heated under an ITQ regime because,
typically, there will be less fishing activity and fewer fishing boats.

It should also be noted that the establishment of ITQs, while reducing
conflicts in fisheries, may be a source of a different kind of conflict.
This is because the allocation of property rights to individuals or
groups necessarily excludes non-receivers. Non-receivers naturally
contest the allocation, sometimes bitterly. History abounds with such
examples. In fisheries in which ITQs and other individual property
rights have been established such disputes are very common. The same
applies to the extension of national EEZs in the past, although the
associated international disputes have died down somewhat recently. It
follows, that the benefits of ITQs and similar individual property
rights as conflict-resolving mechanisms in fisheries must be set against
the costs of increased conflicts about the property rights system
itself.

What is not so obvious is that ITQs, despite their limitations as
property rights, provide a certain basis for resolving conflicts between
fishers and non-fishing uses of aquatic resources. Non-fishing uses of
aquatic resources may be divided into uses that are concerned with the
state of the fish stocks and, therefore, indirectly harvesting, and
non-fishing uses that are uninterested in fishing and fish stocks but
may affect both. Examples of the former are aquatic conservation and
certain types of aquatic recreation and tourism such as reef diving.
Examples of the latter are aquatic mining, aquatic transportation, and
aquatic dumping of refuse.

Consider first non-fishing uses of fish stocks, such as aquatic
conservation and tourism. Assume, [as is]{.underline}
[**[empirically]{.underline}** [reasonable]{.underline}]{.mark}, that
these [[activities]{.mark} would like to [see]{.mark}]{.underline}
[**[larger fish stocks]{.underline}**]{.mark} than the fishers would.
[This is a]{.underline} **[source]{.underline}** [of
conflict]{.underline} with the fishers. [Within the]{.underline} **[ITQ
system]{.underline}**, however, [aquatic conservation and tourism are
able to]{.underline} **[increase]{.underline}** the size of [commercial
stocks, and]{.underline} basically [move the ecosystem]{.underline}
**[closer to a pristine state]{.underline}**, by purchasing ITQs and
leaving them unused. Thus, the [ITQ institution provides]{.underline}
the aquatic conservationists and tourists with [a way to]{.underline}
**[achieve]{.underline}** their [preferred fish stocks
[by]{.mark}]{.underline} simply **[[trading ITQs]{.underline}]{.mark}**
with the fishers [instead of fighting]{.underline} them. As they do the
trading they continually compare their benefits of purchase to their
valuation of the monetary outlays, ending purchases when the two values
are equal. The same, of course, applies to the fishers; they do not have
to fight with these other users of aquatic resources. They can simply
trade with them. These [ITQ trades will [find]{.mark} an]{.underline}
**[[equilibrium]{.underline}]{.mark}** where the shadow value of
additional catch to fishers equals the shadow value of addition
conservation to the conservationists. Needless to say, this [ITQ trading
will]{.underline} **[increase]{.underline}** [the]{.underline} **[total
value of resource use]{.underline}**, benefit both parties, [and
[allocate]{.mark}]{.underline} the [**[scarce]{.underline}**
[resources]{.underline}]{.mark} [more [efficiently]{.mark}]{.underline}
between the parties (Arnason, 2008, 2012).

It is important to recognize, however, that unlike in the case of
fisheries, decentralized ITQ trades between fishers and conservationists
(or aquatic tourists), while [likely to]{.underline} **[significantly
alleviate]{.underline}** the [conflicts between]{.underline} these
[groups]{.underline}, are very unlikely to bring about the optimal
allocation of aquatic resource use between these groups. The fundamental
reason is that these [trades generate]{.underline} **[positive external
effects]{.underline}** [for both groups]{.underline}. Consider the case
of a conservationist purchasing one unit of quota from a fisher for
retirement. Since this will, ceteris paribus, lead to a larger fish
stock, all other conservationists and fishers will benefit from the
trade. In other words, an ITQ trade from fishers to conservationists
generates a positive external effect for both fishers and
conservationists (as well as aquatic tourists and others preferring
larger fish stocks). These extra benefits of the trade are naturally not
taken into account by the fisher and the conservationist. As a result,
the extent of such decentralized trades is less than would maximize
total benefits (Arnason, 2012). It follows that if fishers hold the ITQs
to start with, there will, from the social perspective, be too much
fishing and too little conservation. Trades from conservationists to
fishers will, on the other hand, generate negative external effects for
both fishers and conservationists because this reduces the fish stocks.
Therefore, decentralized trades of this kind will be larger than would
be collectively optimal with the same result: there will be too much
fishing and too little conservation.

It is possible to illustrate the essence of this analysis with the help
of a simple supply and demand diagram. In Figure 4, the volume of
harvest is measured along the horizontal axis and values along the
vertical axis. Consider the trade of ITQs between one fisher and one
conservationist. Assume that under the ITQ system the ITQ holding of the
fisher is at Q.20 Let the marginal benefits of harvest to the fisher be
indicated by the bold downward sloping curve. The curve may be
interpreted as the fisher's demand function for harvest. However, since
fishing his quota (rather than not fishing it) reduces the fish stocks,
the marginal benefits of this fishing to all the fishers jointly is
less, indicated by the dashed downward sloping curve, which may be
interpreted as the aggregate demand curve for harvest (out of the
fisher's Q).

\[Figure omitted\]

The conservationist suffers costs from the fishing. The
conservationist's marginal cost is indicated by the bold upward sloping
curve in the diagram. This may be interpreted as his supply curve of
harvest. However, since there are other conservationists, the joint
marginal cost curve is higher, indicated by the dashed upward sloping
curve in the diagram.

From the figure, it can be seen that the trading equilibrium between the
fisher and the conservationist is at harvest q° where their individual
supply and demand curves intersect (and their evaluations of the value
of additional harvest is equal). However, the optimal harvest occurs at
much lower harvest, q\*, where the joint supply and demand curves
intersect.

So, under decentralized trades, the ITQ system will not result in the
optimal allocation of resource use between fishers and conservationists.
Note, however, that although decentralized ITQ trades fail to generate
full efficiency, they definitely represent an improvement in resource
allocation efficiency, as well as reducing conflicts, compared to not
allowing conservationists to participate in the ITQ system at all.

The obvious solution to this problem is centralized trades. If, instead
of trading individually, both groups, fishers and conservationists,
acted jointly with regard to trades of quota shares, the external
effects would be internalized and, in principle, optimal ITQ allocation
would result. This of course means that the trading quantity and the
quota price is a matter of bilateral negotiation between the two groups.
However, the very substantial added benefits to be gained increase the
likelihood of an agreement. Moreover, in this situation, where rights
are well defined by virtue of the ITQ system, the so-called
Coase-theorem (Coase, 1960) indicates that there is a high likelihood
that the parties will agree on the harvesting solution that maximizes
their joint benefits.

What about the other users of aquatic resources such as aquatic miners,
transporters, and polluters that are not interested in fish stocks? It
is clear that they would not buy ITQs to enhance fish stocks and would
sell all their ITQs, if they had them. Thus, ITQ trading would not
facilitate the optimal sharing of aquatic resources between them and
fishers or alleviate conflicts between them. This outcome is because the
ITQs, being merely harvesting rights, do not cover the aquatic resources
these users want, namely minerals, ocean surface, and ocean space and
currents. For this purpose, the ITQs property rights are simply too
limited.

If, however, the ITQ right were extended to cover the right to a certain
state and regenerative ability of the fish stocks and the aquatic
environment, the situation would be changed.21 In that case, any aquatic
use that reduces the productivity of valuable fish stocks would violate
the ITQ rights and be subject to the appropriate compensation. This
would, of course, curtail these other activities and move them toward
the overall optimal level. Moreover, with these rights in hand, fishers
acting jointly could negotiate with these other aquatic users a jointly
optimal sharing of the resources along the lines discussed.

Conclusions

[Fisheries [conflicts have]{.mark} a]{.underline} **[very [long
history]{.mark}]{.underline}** in human societies. They seem to be
present wherever fishing takes place. Apparently, [[most]{.mark} of them
are]{.underline} of **[relatively [low intensity]{.mark}]{.underline}**,
[but]{.underline} they [sometimes flare up into]{.underline} armed
confrontations and even the application of national navies. In addition
to their direct costs, to the extent that these conflicts prevent the
optimal use of renewable aquatic resources, [they can be]{.underline}
**[very costly]{.underline}** indeed.

Fisheries conflicts are fundamentally caused by the shortage of fish
resources relative to demand. However, similar scarcity of natural
resources on land does not, at least not in recent history, generate the
same degree of conflicts. The reason seems to be that most land-based
resources have become subject to an extensive system of property rights,
which has channeled the conflicts into a less harmful form. This
suggests that a similar system of property rights in aquatic resources
would reduce fisheries conflicts to the level seen for terrestrial
resources.

The [extensions of]{.underline} national exclusive economic zones
(**[[EEZs]{.underline}]{.mark}**) constitute a step in this direction.
Although far from enclosing all international ocean commons and fish
stocks, these extensions [have]{.underline} already **[significantly
reduced]{.underline}** [international fisheries conflicts
and]{.underline} **[[mollified]{.underline}]{.mark}** many of [the
[remaining ones]{.mark}]{.underline}.

Another type of property rights in aquatic resources that has been
expanding fast in recent decades are individual quotas
([**[IQs]{.underline}**) [and]{.underline}]{.mark} individual
transferable quotas (**[[ITQs]{.underline}]{.mark}**). These, however,
are only harvesting rights and are, therefore, extremely limited as
property rights in aquatic resources. Nevertheless, w[here they have
been implemented]{.underline}, they [have [proven capable
of]{.mark}]{.underline} both **[[reducing]{.mark} fisheries
[conflict]{.mark}s]{.underline}** and greatly enhancing the economic
efficiency in fishing (Arnason, 2013). The main practical drawback is
that individual quota systems, as other property rights, need
considerable enforcement to be effective. Therefore, they are more
suitable for advanced societies than those with weak administrative
capacity. Nevertheless, [since their]{.underline}
**[beginnings]{.underline}** in the 1970s, [they]{.underline} have
[[expanded]{.underline} **[very fast]{.underline}**]{.mark} [around the
world [and]{.mark}]{.underline} currently [[account for over
a]{.underline} **[quarter of the global ocean]{.underline}**]{.mark}
**[catch]{.underline}** (Arnason, 2013).

It has been [demonstrated]{.underline} both
**[theoretically]{.underline}** [and]{.underline}
**[empirically]{.underline}** (Arnason, 2009, 2013) that [ITQs are
capable of solving resource allocation conflicts]{.underline} between
all major types of fishers, commercial ones, recreational ones, and
subsistence ones, as well as those between subgroups such as large-scale
and small-scale ones and inshore and offshore ones. The main reason is
that the [ITQ rights]{.underline} **[eliminate]{.underline}** [the need
to fight]{.underline} with other fishers for catch, and by trading of
these rights each fisher can share in the greater efficiency of the
others. Thus, as an example, under the ITQ system, a poor subsistence
fisher can indefinitely maintain his lifestyle by continuing to use his
quota for subsistence fishing or can increase his wealth by trading his
quota rights to a more efficient high-tech commercial fisher.

to occur in the near future. Recent reports suggest that inter-state
conflict will break out due to a decline in global fish stocks, while
others suggest that 'the world is already at war over fish'. That
commentary draws on the notion of resource wars, which suggests that
states often enter into conflict for control of resources, such as oil,
gas or precious minerals. The commentators suggest that since fish
stocks are declining, it is only a matter of time before the supply of
fish also becomes an increasingly valuable resource worth going to war
over. [[That]{.mark} notion [is]{.mark} **overly
[simplistic]{.mark}**]{.underline}, however, [and]{.underline} obscures,

While the International Food Policy Research Institute maintains that
'food insecurity can be both a cause and consequence of conflict', the
debate about food insecurity causing conflict continues unabated. Other
research suggests that food insecurity, on its own, does not
automatically lead to a heightened risk of conflict. Other factors, such
as the strength of political institutions, also play a decisive role in
whether conflict occurs. A review of the linkages between food security
and conflict, concludes that it is difficult to isolate the particular
factors that contribute to the outbreak of conflict. It suggests that
'more and better data on and from conflict zones is required for
understanding and monitoring the full diversity, nature and
interrelations of food security and violent conflict'.

Comment

China is often cited as the most likely belligerent in any so-called
"fish war". Some strategic analysts argue that China sees wild fish as
'a strategic commodity to be protected and defended, if necessary, by
force'; they point to the militarisation of the East and South China
seas as evidence. An increased Chinese military presence in those
regions is not likely to be solely due to the presence of fish, however,
and securing strategic maritime trade routes is likely to be an equal,
if not greater, motivating factor. While [Beijing]{.underline} has often
utilised fishing vessels to further geostrategic aims, it [is [unlikely
to use **military force**]{.mark} just [to]{.mark}]{.underline} gain
[[access]{.underline}]{.mark} to [**[foreign fishing
grounds]{.underline}**.]{.mark}

Chinese fishing vessels have been found as far afield as Argentina,
Ecuador and South Africa. Each of those countries has raised concerns
with Beijing about its fishing fleet encroaching on their exclusive
economic zones (EEZ). Since 2014, Indonesia has destroyed several
Chinese fishing vessels, among hundreds of others, mainly from
South-East Asian countries. Food security is not the primary motive for
these actions however, as sovereignty and the potential economic loss
from increased competition for fish in EEZs, play a larger role in any
such "conflict". In the Indonesian case, the destruction of foreign
fishing vessels is designed more to deter illegal fishing that deprives
the state of revenue and to boost popular support for the fisheries
minister, than to ensure food security.

As declining global fish stocks drive fishing vessels into the exclusive
economic zones of other states, the risk of misunderstandings increases.
States that feel that their sovereignty is being challenged could
retaliate with force, potentially escalating disputes between fishing
vessels into armed conflict. [[Given that states]{.underline}]{.mark}
continue to [[uphold the]{.mark} **international [norm]{.mark}**
[of]{.mark} **state [sovereignty]{.mark}**]{.underline} and are only
likely to violate it in particularly exceptional circumstances, [[it is
