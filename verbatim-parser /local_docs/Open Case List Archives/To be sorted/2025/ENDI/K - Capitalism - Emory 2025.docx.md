Old colonialisms and the new: legacies, continuities and further issues

[While contemporary projects of [economic development in the
Arctic]{.mark}]{.underline} have reached new scales and exploit new
resource frontiers, they [are [closely related]{.mark} [to]{.mark} the
continuity of]{.underline} '[**old'** **[Arctic]{.mark}
[colonialisms]{.mark}**]{.underline}. In their development, the
perpetuation of the settler-colonial logic of capitalist economic
development coupled with reasons of the Euro-American polities that
claim the Arctic as part of their territory constitute the basis of
'Arctic geopolitics'. [Another new element is the [growing
importance]{.mark} of the Arctic [as]{.mark} [a **geopolitical
hotspot**]{.mark} in world politics]{.underline}. While [economic
reasons are an **important driver**]{.underline} [for **territorial
reorganizations** in the **Arctic**]{.underline}, national security and
defence issues also play an important part in such processes. The
reorganization of military structures and the redefinition of military
strategies and objectives in the Arctic -- seen in Russia, in the US and
Canada, encompassing all of the Inuit homeland -- points to a tendency
of increased control being exercised over hyperborean spaces by States.

[The [**emergence** of]{.mark} neo-**[extractivist capitalist
development]{.mark}**]{.underline}21) [might be the defining feature of
**emerging Arctic colonialisms**]{.underline}. [**Neo-extractivist**
**capital accumulation** is]{.underline} [[characterized by
**pressure**]{.mark} [over **natural resources**]{.mark} and the [demand
for greater]{.mark}]{.underline} [[**capitalist control** over
**space**]{.underline}]{.mark}, [[reinforcing a **relationship** between
**humanity** and]{.mark} **[nature based]{.mark}** [on the **economic
value**]{.mark} [of **land** and **natural
resources**]{.mark}.]{.underline} [While colonial]{.underline}
[projects]{.underline} attempt to [recast themselves as
necessary]{.underline} [in the face of external threats or as the
reasonable way of seizing the Arctic resource boom]{.underline}, [their
objectives are]{.underline} [similar]{.underline} [to]{.underline} those
of [old colonialisms]{.underline}: [subsume]{.underline} [indigenous
territories]{.underline} and subjectivities [under]{.underline} [[the
**logic of**]{.mark} **[capitalist accumulation]{.mark}** [and
**extending State**]{.mark}]{.underline} (and capital) [[control over
the]{.mark} [**populations** that **inhabit them**]{.mark}]{.underline}.
It is possible to note that, if their scale and methods are somehow
different from eighteenth and nineteenth century colonialisms, they
still represent a continuity of the colonial project. Moreover, [the
long history of the]{.underline} [nefarious **impacts** of
**colonialism**]{.underline} and the deep disarticulation it brought to
the Inuit peoples allowed the erasure of indigenous presences [and the
emergence of '[empty]{.mark}]{.underline} [[Arctic']{.mark}
**[narratives]{.mark}**]{.underline} -- used by both neo-extractivist
capitalism and the national-territorial State in [[**legitimizing** the
**rationale** behind such projects.]{.underline}]{.mark}

#### Capitalism causes extinction. [Climate]{.underline} change, endless [militarism]{.underline}, and [pandemics]{.underline} doom humanity.

Environmental Destruction, and Militarism." Dying for Capitalism: How
Big Money Fuels Extinction and What We Can Do About It, Chapter

[[The idea of]{.mark} a **[global extinction]{.mark} triangle** [linking
**capitalism**]{.mark}, **environmental destruction**]{.underline}
([including [**climate change**, **pandemics**, and **biodiversity
collapse**]{.mark}]{.underline}[), [and
**militarism**]{.underline}]{.mark} ([especially **nuclear
war)**]{.underline} will be viewed [in many **nations**, and especially
the United States]{.underline}, as itself madness. It is so taboo that
most [**analysts** of **climate crisis**, **pandemics** such as
**COVID-19**, and **nuclear war**]{.underline} -- [and]{.underline}
indeed [much of the **climate** and **peace**
[movements]{.mark}]{.underline} -- [[avoid]{.mark} the **subject** of
the **capitalist system** and [the need for **systemic
transformation**]{.mark}]{.underline} like the plague.

To take just climate, the notion that the capitalist system drives
climate change is highlighted by only a few leading analysts, mainly on
the Left. One is Naomi Klein, who argues that extinction arises from
"the collision between capitalism and the planet" and that:

> [We have not **done**]{.underline} the [[things]{.underline}]{.mark}
> that are [[necessary to lower **emissions**]{.mark} because those
> things **fundamentally [conflict]{.mark}** [with]{.mark} **deregulated
> [capitalism]{.mark}**]{.underline}, the reigning ideology for the
> entire period we have been struggling to find a way out of this
> crisis. [We are **stuck** because the [actions]{.mark} that would give
> us the **best chance** of averting **catastrophe**]{.underline} -- and
> would benefit the vast majority -- [[are]{.mark} **extremely
> [threatening]{.mark}** [to a]{.mark}n **elite [minority]{.mark}**
> []{.mark}that has a **stranglehold**]{.underline} over our economy,
> our political process, and most of our major media outlets.2

Klein acknowledges that "autocratic industrial socialism" can also cause
climate change, but argues that [the ruling **capitalist m**odel is the
**major risk** and [we need]{.mark} to pursue a **[democratic]{.mark}
"eco-[socialism]{.mark}**" to save the planet]{.underline}.

Joining Klein in the laser-like but lonely focus on the capitalist DNA
driving extinction is the journalist, George Monbiot. He writes that:

> Ecologically, economically and politically, capitalism is failing as
> catastrophically as communism failed. Like state communism, it is
> beset by unacknowledged but fatal contradictions. It is inherently
> corrupt and corrupting. But its mesmerising power, and the vast
> infrastructure of thought that seeks to justify it, makes any
> challenge to the model almost impossible to contemplate. Even to
> acknowledge the emergencies it causes, let alone to act on them, feels
> like electoral suicide. As the famous saying goes: "It is easier to
> imagine the end of the world than to imagine the end of capitalism."
> Our urgent task is to turn this the other way round.3

Monbiot is not joking when he says our most important task is to "turn
this the other way round." While this sounds daunting, imagining
systemic change in the global capitalist economy has become essential to
human survival. In a period when there is a new awakening about
"systemic racism," we need now to expand our consciousness about our
economy, recognizing that we are now living in a new stage of
"extinction capitalism." Only systemic change in our political economy
can save us.

Klein is Canadian and Monbiot is British. These are both societies where
it has long been possible to offer critiques of capitalism without
sounding like a crackpot. Both Britain and Canada have labor or
socialist parties, and mainstreamed the idea that large parts of the
society should be separated from profitmaking and organized for the
provision of public goods. These societies are less complicit than the
United States in climate and military policies fueling extinction.

In the United States, mainstream socialist political parties do not
exist, and "big government" and universal welfare programs are seen as
enemies of liberty, with the exception of an enormous military. Klein
and Monbiot have an audience in the United States, but their views that
to survive means moving beyond capitalism and especially neoliberalism
capitalism runs into huge hurdles, especially in American political
discourse, even among liberals. However, we shall see that it is not an
impossible dream, and that even a President as moderate as Joe Biden,
pushed by people of color, young people, and social movements, has begun
to break with neoliberalism and shift toward a public goods economy that
could help save the planet.

Crossing the Threshold: Humanity Confronts Its Final Stage

Extinction denialism has limited public awareness of the new stage that
arose in the late 1940s but is rooted in the foundations of our economic
system. Indeed, **[capitalism]{.underline}**, even as it [**historically
helped** build new economic **growth** and innovation]{.underline} and
pulled millions out of poverty, has always created war and environmental
destruction. [Its **historical progress** fueled
"**development**]{.underline}" that catapulted the European and American
world [toward **prosperity**]{.underline} and material well-being for
two centuries. [But that **huge leap**]{.underline} forward also
[**froze** into society an **unsustainable quest** for **unfettered
growth** threatening **military** and **environmental
catastrophe**]{.underline} and externalized multiple costs onto the
peoples of the Global South. The history of capitalist successes
disguised latent crises now surfacing in the extinction stage. The
historical benefits of capitalism have not disappeared, but their
relative value has declined compared to the costs and risks --
ultimately of extinction.

The Triangle of Extinction: Mad Money

To save humanity and all life on the planet, we need to understand the
new extinction stage as rooted in a causal triangle of three intertwined
threats. The only way that humanity will survive is if the world --
including all states, peoples, and social movements -- come together to
dismantle the triangle and create a new circle of sustainable life
systems.

[Capitalism]{.underline} drives the triangle of extinction. Its very
nature, as a system, [foments **militarism** and drives **environmental
destruction**]{.underline}. In Chapter 2, we argue that capitalism's
constant need to expand both its resource base and its markets fosters a
militarism to pry open markets and "protect" investments. Territorial
expansion across national borders has a corollary in the capitalist
dynamic to test and break ecological thresholds, producing the third
corner of the triangle, environmental destruction.

However, these two corners -- [**militarism** and **environmental
destruction**]{.underline} also [feed back into]{.underline}, affect,
and reinforce [the logic of capitalism. Both create the
**[disasters]{.mark}** that [leave **communities**]{.mark} and
**states** [turning to **capitalists**]{.mark}]{.underline} []{.mark}for
solutions. The **[[soil]{.mark} fertility
[depletion]{.mark}]{.underline}**, for example, [that **capitalist
agriculture** produces, [leaves us]{.mark} all more [**dependent**
on]{.mark} the **petrochemical** and **agro-industrial** corporations
selling **[fertilizers]{.mark}** and **pesticides**]{.underline}.
Similarly, [[capitalism's]{.mark} **inherent
[instability]{.mark}**]{.underline}, particularly in the American case,
[[produces]{.mark} a "[**military Keynesianism**," using **state
spending**]{.mark} to increase **production** and
**profits**]{.underline} of military companies. [This, in turn,
compromises **democracy**, giving **weapons contractors** privileged
**access to the state**, rendering the latter **dependent** on the
"**market" fortunes**]{.underline} of these corporations (Figure 1.1).

As we contemplate this triangle, we must recognize that its dynamics
play out in social and historical structures that are profoundly
intersectional, ones characterized at the global, regional, and national
levels by evolving hierarchies including those of race, gender, class,
and states. A more complete picture of the triangle therefore looks like
this (Figure 1.2).

This second diagram spells out the variety of forms of environmental
destruction and militarism that create existential and extinction
threats, whether they be, in Bostrom's terms, forms of bang, crunch,
shriek, or whimper risks. In both pictures, we are adhering to the idea
that existential threats -- and extinction itself -- should not be
defined exclusively as total annihilation.

The second picture shows that [there are [several]{.mark} **major
[existential risks]{.mark}**; among the risks in]{.underline} the
[**environmental destruction** corner are]{.underline} three well-known
ones, [[**climate change**, **pandemics**, and **biodiversity**]{.mark}
loss]{.underline}. But these interact with the others listed, as well as
with the many other risks that are less well known. Similarly,
[militarism produces [**nuclear**, **biological**/**chemical**, and
**cyberwar** risks]{.mark}]{.underline}. [All of these]{.underline} six
varieties of existential risk are extremely important, and all [are
"systemic]{.underline}" in that they are partly caused and fueled by the
United States and global capitalist system. [All deserve
urgent]{.underline} study leading to [emergency transformative
change]{.underline} because each of them could create devastating mass
death from which humanity might not be able to recover. In addition to
these six existential risks, the clusters around each corner of the
second diagram also name other risks that may escalate into either
existential risks or radically re- duce the quality of life and pose
civilizational risks.

In this book, mainly to keep the book shorter, we do not analyze
biodiversity collapse, cyber war, or biological war, focusing instead on
nuclear war, climate change, and pandemics. If we were to write a second
volume, we would analyze with the same sense of urgency the other three
incredibly dangerous threats; they are growing and increasingly
intertwined with the threats we focus on here.

The arrows in the diagrams reflect causation. Capitalism itself creates
a threat of extinction, independent of environmental death and war. But
it also causes and fuels the environmental threats of climate change,
pandemics, and loss of biodiversity, which multiply the extinction
threat. And [capitalism]{.underline}, [especially the **militarized
hegemonic form**]{.underline} modeled by US neoliberal capitalism,
causes war, which [further **multiplies** the extinction threat embedded
in the **possibility** of nuclear war. Climate change, pandemics, and
extreme war could arise from other systems than capitalism, but
[**capitalism** is a **leading cause**]{.mark} and accelerator [of
all]{.mark} these **[threats]{.mark}**]{.underline}, which in turn
intensify the extinction dangers of each other. [Climate change is a
**major driver** of war]{.underline} and war has become a leading cause
of climate change. [Scholarship on **climate change** and]{.underline}
broader **[environmental matters]{.underline}** typically [recognize
several major **tipping points** and environmental thresholds beyond
which **abrupt** and **catastrophic outcomes** are to be
**expected**]{.underline}. While we do explore these in depth, we
consider these important aspects of the three corners of the triangle of
extinction.5

#### The alternative is eco-socialism: a [democratically-planned]{.underline} economy that prioritizes [human needs]{.underline} and [ecological sustainability]{.underline} over the pursuit of profit.

[**[Eco-socialism]{.mark}** -- [a **democratic**, **equitable**]{.mark},
[and]{.mark} **environmentally [sustainable]{.mark} socio[-economic
order]{.mark}** -- [offers such an **alternative**]{.mark}]{.underline}
(Barkdull and Harris Citation2015). [Democratic eco-socialism
**[repudiates]{.mark}** "[the **growth paradigm**]{.mark} that is an
integral]{.underline} [**component** [of **global
capitalism**]{.mark}]{.underline} and that all too often has been
accepted by people who called themselves socialists or Marxists" (Baer
Citation2020, 3). [In addition to]{.underline} [environmental
sustainability]{.underline}, [it involves]{.underline}, among other
things, "[an [economy]{.mark} [oriented to meeting **basic social
needs**]{.mark}]{.underline} [-- namely, adequate **[food]{.mark}**,
[clothing]{.mark}, **[shelter]{.mark}**, [education, health, and
**dignified work**]{.mark}; a high degree of **[social
equality]{.mark}**]{.underline}; \[and[\] representative [and
**participatory democracy**]{.mark}]{.underline}" (Baer Citation2020,
152). A democratic eco-socialist world order would have several critical
advantages in the formulation and implementation of adaptation. These
advantages will be required for coping with a climate crisis imposed on
the world by ecologically heedless practices of capitalism.
[[Eco-socialism's]{.mark} **[planning]{.mark} [capacity]{.mark}**,
democratic **decision-making**, **[production for human needs rather
than for profits]{.mark}**]{.underline}[,]{.mark} [[and commitment to
**genuine equality**]{.mark} [are]{.mark} essential to successful
**adaptation** to climate change, and indeed may be **[essential to
sustaining civilization]{.mark}**]{.underline} (Foster Citation2019;
Magdoff Citation2014; Meszaros Citation2007).

Creating a truly eco-socialist state, let alone an eco-socialist world
order, is certainly a challenging task (Foster Citation2008). A
democratic eco-socialist order that would overcome the drawbacks of
capitalism and facilitate adaptation to climate change has never
existed. Regimes that claim to be socialist, such as the former Soviet
Union once did and China still does, do not offer any model for a
sustainable, and certainly not a democratic, future. The Soviet Union
was an authoritarian environmental disaster that left a legacy of GHG
pollution globally and fossil fuel addiction in successor states.
Today's [China]{.underline}, while a different form of real socialism,
[is at least as **authoritarian** and even more **environmentally
destructive**.]{.underline} Its economy has grown much more than that of
the Soviet Union, albeit while creating extreme disparities in wealth,
and it remains heavily reliant on fossil fuels. The consequences of what
the Chinese regime calls "socialism with Chinese characteristics" (Boer
Citation2021), and its economic implementation through export-maximizing
"state capitalism" (Kennedy and Blanchette Citation2021), has resulted
in the country being the world's largest national source of the GHG
pollution that drives the climate crisis and the growing need for
adaptation. Indeed, one reason for the failure of mitigation has been
China's decades-long resistance in international negotiations to cutting
global GHG emissions quickly and rapidly ending the world's -- and
therefore its own -- heavy reliance on fossil fuels. [The examples of
**China** and the **USSR** suggest that **actually existing socialism**
does not offer a **viable model** for a **future eco-socialist
society**.]{.underline}

Adaptation can occur spontaneously -- what the IPCC terms "autonomous
adaptation" -- when ecosystems and social systems respond to felt
changes in the climate. For instance, when temperatures rise, tree
species will propagate at higher latitudes and insects will invade new
areas. Incentives and markets can enable autonomous adaptation;
individuals might move to more habitable regions, escaping the costs of
heavily impacted areas for more congenial homes. Capitalism is
well-suited to this form of adaptation. The problems arise when
adaptation requires long-term planning with due attention to values
other than capital accumulation. [[Effective, equitable adaptation
demands such **long-term planning**]{.underline}]{.mark}. One reason is
that there is a lag between a given concentration of GHGs in the
atmosphere and reaching its associated equilibrium temperature. Today's
concentration determines tomorrow's temperature. Consequently,
responding to current conditions is bound to be inadequate, and as
global temperature rises, the effects will be so great that reactive
responses will never keep up with growing impacts. Without comprehensive
long-term planning, and making needed investments today to prepare for
harms yet to come, all manner of maladaptation is likely to occur, only
worsening the problem as temperatures rise.

Rather than a short-term focus on corporate profits, an eco-socialist
society can anticipate and prepare for the predictable effects of
climate change. Eco-socialism has the potential to provide the
future-oriented planning that the climate adaptation challenge demands.
To do so, [[an **eco-socialist society** **must be a democratic
one**]{.mark}.]{.underline} Adaptation planning and implementation to
serve the broad mass of humanity in all parts of the world requires
inclusive decision-making processes. Otherwise, those who are likely to
be most heavily affected by the climate crisis will also be the ones
receiving the least help, a situation that already exists. Long
experience shows that criticizing the practices and priorities of
corporations, multilateral development agencies, and development
assistance programs has only marginal effect. The problem lies in the
concentration of wealth and power in a few hands, effectively denying
democratic voice to billions of people. This state of affairs is
unavoidable in today's global capitalist world order, which invariably
harms the environment and disproportionately prioritizes the interests
of the top one percent.

As the climate crisis worsens, the world's power and resources may be
increasingly directed toward defending the rule of capital. [A remedy
for this could be the institution of democratic rule by the associated
producers]{.underline} -- [that is, **genuine democracy**]{.underline},
without which adaptation will mean little more than "ever-bigger sea
walls around Manhattan" (Uncapher and Yvellez Citation2019), thus
pushing the heavy costs of the climate crisis onto the most vulnerable.
[In a genuine democratic eco-socialist society, such
[exploitation]{.mark} [would be **prevented**]{.mark} because **[every
community]{.mark}** [would participate in **devising responses** to the
**crisis**]{.mark}]{.underline}, [and values such as community and the
full development of the individual would carry more **weight than
capital accumulation**.]{.underline}

#### Policy is not just a matter of [possibility]{.underline}, but of [purpose]{.underline}. Their framework makes debate [meaningless]{.underline} and guarantees [serial policy failure]{.underline}.

"Ends, Means and Policy." *Ecological Economics: Principles and
Applications*, Chapter 3.

If economics is the study of the allocation of scarce means in the serv-
ice of competing **ends**, we have to think rather deeply about the
nature of ends and means. Also, [[policy **presupposes**]{.mark}
**knowledge** of two kinds]{.underline}: [of [**possibility** and
**purpose**]{.mark}]{.underline} and of means and ends. Possibility
reflects how the world works. In addition to keeping us from wasting
time and money on impossibilities, this kind of knowledge gives us
information about tradeoffs between real alternatives. [[Purpose
reflects **desirability**]{.underline}]{.mark}, [[our **ranking of
ends**]{.underline}]{.mark}, [[our criteria for distinguishing better
from **worse states**]{.mark} **of the world**]{.underline}. [[It does
not **help**]{.mark} **much** [to know how the world works if we cannot
distinguish better from **worse**]{.mark} **states of the
world**]{.underline}. Nor is it useful to pursue a better state of the
world that happens to be impossible. [[Without both]{.mark} kinds of
knowledge]{.underline}, [[policy discussion is
**meaningless**]{.underline}]{.mark}.1

[To relate this to **economic policy**]{.underline}, [we **need** to
consider]{.underline} two questions. First, in the realm of possibility,
the question is: What are the means at our disposal? Of what does our
ultimate means consist? By "ultimate means" we mean a common denominator
of possibility or usefulness that we can only use up and not produce,
for which we are totally dependent on the natural environment. Second,
[[what **ultimately** is the **end** or]{.mark} **highest
[purpose]{.mark}** [in whose service we should **employ these
means**]{.mark}]{.underline}? These are very large questions, and we
cannot answer them completely, especially the latter. But [[it is
**essential** to raise the questions]{.underline}]{.mark}. There are
some things, however, that we say by way of partial answers, and it is
important to say them.

[The fact [that]{.mark} many leading American
**[intellectuals]{.mark}**, **experts**, [and **policymakers**]{.mark}
in the early twentieth century [came to believe]{.mark} that the
**[domination]{.mark}** of the economy [by]{.mark} a few [giant
corporations was **inevitable**, and]{.mark} that [there was
**no**]{.mark} other viable **[alternative]{.mark}**, likely [played an
**important role** in]{.mark} the **[corporate takeover]{.mark}** of the
American economy]{.underline} during that era, [[as]{.mark} these
[fatalist ideas **filtered**]{.mark} down [into the]{.mark} larger
**[public.]{.mark}**]{.underline} If analogous ideas of naturalized
inequality continue to spread and gain purchase through prestigious
outlets such as Science, [a similar development could occur
today]{.underline} in the realm of economic distribution. [[If most
Americans]{.mark} are eventually led to [believe]{.mark} that the
enormous [disparities]{.mark} of wealth in their society [are]{.mark}
the product of **[natural]{.mark}** and inexorable laws, [the
chances]{.mark} that [they]{.mark} will [demand]{.mark} social,
institutional, or political [**change** will]{.mark}]{.underline} likely
[**[decline]{.mark}** dramatically.]{.underline}

To avoid such a fate, this article will end by articulating how
historical [[**scholarship** can help]{.mark} serve as a counterweight
by **[denaturalizing inequality.]{.mark}**]{.underline} Here, too,
Piketty can play an important role. As I will demonstrate, and as others
before me have argued, Capital in the Twenty-First Century is
essentially a book suffering from a split personality.9 Listening to the
book's "other Piketty" leads us down a very different intellectual path
with very different political and ideological ramifications. Unlike the
fatalist laws and equations which appear in certain parts of Capital in
the Twenty-First Century and in the Science issue that helped jumpstart
the return of naturalized inequality, the historically minded parts of
the very same book provide a useful analytical framework that the
Science issue overlooks. [This **[framework]{.mark}**]{.underline} not
only **[[politicizes]{.underline}]{.mark}** economic [theory by focusing
on **[institutional forces]{.mark}**, **historical contingency**, [and
**power relations**]{.mark}]{.underline}, but also denaturalizes
inequality by thoroughly undermining the basis of any economic "law" of
wealth or income distribution. In his newest book, Capital and Ideology,
Piketty continues to go down this denaturalizing path, leaving the
"other" Piketty behind.

Yet while these aspects of Piketty's work can move us forward,
historians of capitalism must pick up the
**[[denaturalizing]{.underline}]{.mark}** mantle. The discipline of
history [[is]{.mark} best fitted [to reveal]{.mark} to the wider public
the **contingent**, [**power-laden**, and
**anything-but-inevitable**]{.mark} nature of]{.underline} our enormous
[income and [wealth gaps]{.mark}, and]{.underline} to [show why
naturalizing arguments that claim the opposite are]{.underline}
misguided and [wrong.]{.underline} While of course many historians have
done much work in this field already, they have often made their
arguments in an indirect and implicit way. As such, this article will
end with some general suggestions about how we can push this agenda to
the explicit fore, thus [offering the]{.underline} broader [public
[a]{.mark} very different [story that does not naturalize inequality
but]{.mark} instead [politicizes it.]{.mark}]{.underline} Yet before we
turn to any of this, let's start with a very brief history of the idea
of natural inequality in the West.

[detailed the **catastrophic breakdown**]{.underline} [of the world
capitalist system]{.underline}, [its drive into]{.underline}
**[barbarism]{.underline}** and consequently the irrefutable case for
international socialism. That was not their intention, but this
necessity emerges from the facts, figures and analysis in the Global
Risks Report of the WEF and the report entitled Inequality.Inc prepared
for the meeting by the international aid agency Oxfam. The WEF report
stands in stark contrast to its earlier promotion of the claim that the
liquidation of the Soviet Union was the triumph of capitalism over
socialism which would usher in a new epoch of peace, prosperity and
democracy brought about by the unfettered operation of the free market.
As the New Year statement of the WSWS editorial board explained, this
was based on a fundamentally flawed analysis. It was grounded on the
false identification of Stalinism and its nationalist dogma of
"socialism in one country" developed by the bureaucracy against the
perspective of world socialist revolution which had formed the
foundation of the October 1917 revolution. [Rather than representing
the]{.underline} **[end of socialism]{.underline}**, [the liquidation of
the USSR signified that the **fundamental contradiction**]{.underline}
[of capitalism, that between the **integrated world
economy**]{.underline} [and the persistence of the outmoded nation-state
system]{.underline} which had given rise to the horrors of two world
wars in the 20th century, [was **reasserting**]{.underline} [itself in
an **even more**]{.underline} [explosive form.]{.underline} In a
confirmation of [this analysis]{.underline}, the authors of the WEF
report wrote that it was "[[set against]{.mark} a backdrop
o]{.underline}f **[rapidly [accelerating]{.mark}]{.underline}**
[[tech]{.mark}nological [change and **economic
uncertainty**]{.mark}]{.underline}, [as the world is **plagued** by a
**duo** of dangerous crises: **climate** and **conflict**."]{.underline}
It warned that [[governance systems]{.underline}]{.mark} were being
"[**[stretched beyond]{.underline}** [their
**limit**]{.underline}]{.mark}," that "[[weakened systems
require]{.mark} only th]{.underline}e [**[smallest shock]{.underline}**
[to edge past]{.underline}]{.mark} [the **[tipping
point]{.mark}**]{.underline} [of]{.underline}
**[resilience]{.underline}**," and that "[[corrosive]{.mark}
**socioeconomic [vulnerabilities]{.mark}**]{.underline} [[will be
**amplified** in the **near term**]{.underline}]{.mark} [with looming
concerns about an **economic downturn**]{.underline}" [[amid
resurgent]{.mark} risks "such as **[interstate]{.mark}**]{.underline}
[[armed conflict]{.underline}]{.mark}." On [climate change]{.underline}
it warned that the [tipping point]{.underline}, at which
self-perpetuating processes become irreversible, [could be reached by
the **beginning**]{.underline} [of the **next decade**]{.underline} [and
"the **collective ability** of societies to **adapt** could]{.underline}
[be **overwhelmed**]{.underline} [considering the **sheer
scale**]{.underline} [of potential impacts]{.underline}." [[Artificial
intelligence]{.underline}]{.mark} (AI), which was the subject of much
discussion at the meeting, [[posed]{.mark} the [question of
whether]{.mark} an [arms race in]{.mark} "**experimental technologies**"
[would present]{.mark} "**[existential]{.mark} [threats]{.mark}** to
humanity."]{.underline} Nothing in the report even suggested that it
would not, and in fact it warned that the use of [[AI]{.mark} in
"**conflict decision making**]{.underline}" [[would]{.mark}
"significantly [**raise the risk** of
**accidental**]{.mark}]{.underline} [or intentional [escalation]{.mark}
over the next decade]{.underline}." The Oxfam report focused on two
explosive trends in the socioeconomic structure of world capitalism: the
staggering increase in the wealth in the hands of a billionaire
oligarchy and, even more significant, the concentration of monopoly
economic and political power in a handful of giant global corporations.
It noted that since 2020, at the start of the pandemic, from which they
directly benefited, the world's five richest men more than doubled their
fortunes, at the rate of \$14 million per hour, from \$405 billion to
\$869 billion, while almost 5 billion people, more than half the world's
population had been made poorer. It warned that if current trends
continued the world would have its first trillionaire within a decade,
but poverty would not be eliminated for another 229 years. Oxfam has
pointed to [the accelerating **growth of wealth**]{.underline}
[and]{.underline} **[income inequality]{.underline}** for a number of
years. A significant addition to its latest analysis was the focus on
the [increase in **[corporate]{.mark}
[concentration]{.mark}**]{.underline}[, [showing]{.underline}]{.mark}
[how **[whole industries]{.mark}**]{.underline} [[in vital areas]{.mark}
such as **food production**]{.underline}, **[energy]{.underline}**,
**[agriculture]{.underline}** [and]{.underline}
**[technology]{.underline}** [[were **becoming
concentrated**]{.underline}]{.mark} [in fewer and fewer
firms]{.underline}. There were many statistics which reflected this
process, with one of the most striking being that the largest 0.001
percent of firms earned roughly one-third of all corporate profits.
Pointing to the connection between economic and political power, it
noted that far from being accidental, this economic power had been
"handed to monopolies" by governments. Reformist organisations,
including Oxfam, have called for greater taxation to rein in corporate
wealth and facilitate greater social equality through the provision of
increased social services. But as its latest report acknowledged, since
1980 corporations and their wealthy owners had intensified inequality by
waging a "highly effective war on taxation," with the result that the
official corporate tax rate had been halved in the major capitalist
countries, and that with tax havens and "tax planning" many corporations
often paid virtually no tax at all. [[Corporations]{.mark} likewise
**[dominate]{.mark}**]{.underline} [[climate change]{.mark}
policy]{.underline} as they "**[own]{.underline}**,
**[control]{.underline}**, **[shape]{.underline}** [and]{.underline}
**[financially profit]{.underline}** [from processes that
**emit**]{.underline} greenhouse gases," [and seek to "**block
progress**]{.underline} [on a fast and just transition]{.underline},"
denying and spinning the truth on climate change. In the space available
here we have only touched on some of the key points in both reports. But
even this brief examination raises the vital question, one that concerns
the very fate of humanity: What is to be done? The answer advanced by
Oxfam is that governments and the state must be somehow compelled to act
in the interests of the population against corporate power to ensure the
development of social equality. But its own report details in very many
places that governments and the state, of which they are a part, are
themselves the instrument of corporate power, functioning as the
executive committee for the enforcement its demands. In its conclusion,
entitled "Towards an economy for all," the report declared: [Powerful
corporations are]{.underline} **[driving]{.underline}** [extreme
inequality]{.underline}, all too often overpowering governments and
undermining the choice and freedoms of people globally. [Governments
must **use their power**]{.underline} [to rein in the **runaway** power
of **corporations**.]{.underline} This call has been made by Oxfam at
the conclusion of their previous reports. But they never pose the
question of why it has never been implemented. The old saying there are
none that are so blind as those who do not want to see comes to mind.
[One of the **most significant**]{.underline} [political
developments]{.underline} in the recent period [has been the rapid shift
of all governments to the **right**]{.underline}, [leading to what has
been termed]{.underline} a "**[crisis of democracy]{.underline}**."
[[The shift]{.mark} [towards **dictatorship**]{.mark} and
**[authoritarianism]{.mark}**]{.underline}[, [and]{.underline}]{.mark}
**[outright [fascism]{.mark}]{.underline}**[, [cannot be combated
by]{.underline}]{.mark} [an [appeal to]{.mark} [governments]{.mark} to
change course.]{.underline} In the final analysis, [the **new
forms**]{.underline} of rule being [developed by ruling
classes]{.underline} in all countries [are not a matter of **subjective
choice**]{.underline}, [but are rooted in]{.underline} **[objective
economic processes]{.underline}**. [[Dictatorial]{.mark}
[regimes]{.mark}]{.underline} are not some kind of aberration or
exception. They [[are the **necessary form**]{.underline}
[of]{.underline}]{.mark} [rule for the
**[domination]{.mark}**]{.underline} [of the **corporations** and
**finance capital**]{.underline}, which, in the words of Lenin, "strives
not for democracy but dictatorship."

[If it felt to you like things started going **off the
rails**]{.underline} [around]{.underline} the year [2016]{.underline},
you're not alone. Symbolically, the double blow of Britain voting for
Brexit, then the United States voting for Donald Trump, seemed like the
"end" of something. (The postwar liberal consensus? The Anglo-American
order?) [For some]{.underline} -- myself included -- [it also felt like
the **stirrings**]{.underline} [of a more **explicitly dystopian
moment**]{.underline}. If you count yourself in this category, buckle
up: Jem Bendell, former professor in sustainability leadership at the
UK's University of Cumbria, and his research team are here with more bad
news. [According to Bendell's new book]{.underline} Breaking Together: A
Freedom-Loving Response to Collapse, "[[the quality of life in most
countries]{.mark} and regions of the world]{.underline} \[...\]
**[[peaked]{.mark} [around 2016]{.mark}]{.underline}** [and]{.underline}
\[then\] [began to **slowly decline**]{.underline}". There is no sound
reason to expect a halt to this deterioration, Bendell argues. Rather,
[[declining]{.mark} Human [Development Index statistics are one of
**many signals societal** collapse]{.mark} due to climate change
[is]{.mark} not only **[possible]{.mark}**]{.underline}, [or even
**imminent**]{.underline} -- [but **already happening**]{.underline},
right now. [[But what if]{.mark} [collapse is an
**ongoing**]{.mark}]{.underline} [and]{.underline}
**[[slow]{.mark}(ish)]{.underline}** [[process]{.underline}]{.mark},
[rather than a **one-off mega-disaster?** [And what if]{.mark} the
[cracks]{.mark} [appearing]{.mark} in the "**cultural cement**" of
modern society represent **not only a crisis**]{.underline}, [but also
an [opportunity to]{.mark} **radically [rethink]{.mark}**]{.underline}
[how [humans interact]{.mark}]{.underline} -- with each other, and with
the natural world? Breaking Together encourages us to think about
collapse in ways that are profound, possibility-expanding and
startlingly original. Bendell's "post[-[doom]{.mark}" [perspective
has]{.mark} the **[potential to change]{.mark}**]{.underline}
[individual [lives, **upend organisational
strategies**]{.mark}]{.underline} [and give birth to whole **new social
movements**]{.underline}. Bendell advocates for an ideal of
"ecofreedom". This moves beyond obvious ideas, such as reconnecting with
nature, to encompass supporting youth climate activism and decolonial,
resource-preserving movements in the Global South. The post-doom
approach also calls for [embracing a "**positive disintegration**" of
**self** and **values**]{.underline}, [to **refocus**]{.underline} one's
mind, and entire **[existence]{.underline}**, on things that really
matter. Deep adaptation Bendell is best known for his 2018 paper Deep
Adaptation: A Map for Navigating Climate Tragedy. He submitted it to the
Sustainability Accounting, Management and Policy Journal for peer
review; the reviewers requested major changes. Instead, Bendell
published the paper himself, via the University of Cumbria's Initiative
for Leadership and Sustainability. Deep Adaptation is a brick hurled
through the window of "corporate sustainability", questioning its very
viability as a field of scholarship. The first sentence of the abstract
reads: The purpose of this conceptual paper is to provide readers with
an opportunity to reassess their work and life in the face of an
inevitable near-term social collapse due to climate change. Needless to
say, this got people's attention. The breaking-the-frame gesture of a
supposedly sober academic paper containing bold, sometimes alarming
claims resonated widely. Particularly this one: when I say starvation,
destruction, migration, disease and war, I mean in your own life. With
the power down, soon you wouldn't have water coming out of your tap. You
will depend on your neighbours for food and some warmth. You will become
malnourished. You won't know whether to stay or go. You will fear being
violently killed before starving to death. Deep Adaptation went viral.
By 2019, it had been downloaded more than 600,000 times. The argument's
appeal is based, first, on Bendell's courage to draw meaningful,
personally relevant conclusions from all the terrifying climate and
ecological data that has been floating around unsynthesised for years.
This is combined with a sense one might have stumbled upon "the paper
they don't want you to read". A whiff of contraband, the tang of illicit
knowledge -- which has, of course, become ever more appealing in these
heady, post-truth days. Bendell's "Deep Adaptation" argument influenced
the founding members of Extinction Rebellion, who sought to develop an
environmental activism commensurate with the scale of threat humans
face. It also led to the formation of an international online Deep
Adaptation Forum, which has allowed tens of thousands of people to begin
processing their fear and grief about future societal and ecological
breakdown. Bendell's work has also sparked fierce criticism: that he has
got the science wrong. Or that, even if the science is okay, the
implications of Deep Adaptation are counter to a politics of climate
justice. (It's also worth noting that some critics of Deep Adaptation
commit the classic fallacy of "shooting the messenger", blaming Bendell
for systemic problems and/or emotional responses that are not of his
making.) 'It's already far worse' Now, five years after the birth of the
Deep Adaptation movement, Bendell is back with another nasty surprise:
[as the research]{.underline} \[for Breaking Together\] [progressed, I
discovered the data was indicating things]{.underline} **[were far
worse]{.underline}** [than I had **previously assessed**. Indeed, they
were already **far worse** in the years **before 2018**]{.underline}
than I had known. [I had been wrong to **conclude**]{.underline} [that
societal collapse]{.underline} **[is inevitable]{.underline}**, [because
it had **already begun** when I was reaching that
conclusion.]{.underline} Chapter by chapter, the first half of the
500-page book presents an interdisciplinary laundry list of ruin:
[[imminent]{.underline}]{.mark} or ongoing **[[economic
collapse]{.underline}]{.mark}**, **[[monetary
collapse]{.underline}]{.mark}**, **[energy collapse]{.underline}**,
**[[biosphere collapse]{.underline}]{.mark}**, **[climate
collapse]{.underline}**, **[food collapse]{.underline}**, societal
collapse. Depending on your background, some of this material might be
(depressingly) familiar reading. For example, anyone who's across the
Stockholm Resilience Centre's analysis that [[humanity]{.mark} has
already **[breached six out of]{.mark} [nine]{.mark}** of the earth's
"**[planetary boundaries]{.mark}**",]{.underline} or who has read
Elizabeth Kolbert's The Sixth Extinction (2014), won't need convincing
that ecological collapse is well underway. Hedge-fund gossip On the
other hand, for readers who are unfamiliar with the finer points of
economics or finance -- such as myself -- there are some huge claims
it's hard to know what to do with. Apparently, [[the world's]{.mark}
current **[monetary systems]{.mark}**]{.underline} "[are not only
**[hastening]{.mark}**]{.underline} []{.mark}[the
[collapse]{.mark}]{.underline} of both natural and human systems, [but
are known to be **on the verge**]{.underline} [of collapse by some
senior officials]{.underline}". His proof? "[Many **[private
bankers]{.mark}** I have spoken to **[believe]{.mark}**]{.underline}
[that the **[current monetary systems]{.mark}**]{.underline} [[will
not]{.mark} [last]{.mark}]{.underline}," while "**[[none of
them]{.underline}]{.mark}** \[...\] [[considered the system]{.mark} to
be]{.underline} **[ethically legitimate]{.underline}** [or]{.underline}
**[[sustainable]{.underline}]{.mark}**". This leads to an eye-popping
suggestion: [the monetary system would not **likely
collapse**]{.underline} [in a random fashion but]{.underline} \[would\]
[be triggered when a coalition of **corporate**]{.underline}
[and]{.underline} **[banking interests]{.underline}**, both public and
private, [determine that they are ready to **profit** from **that
transformation**.]{.underline} I'm willing to be convinced on this point
-- I have very little faith in the motives of investment bankers or bond
traders -- but I need more than the cocktail-party gossip of "for the
last 15 years, in social occasions, I have occasionally chatted with
people who work in hedge funds and asked about their views on their work
and the future of the financial system". A lot more. Systems under
stress But even while Bendell and co. can get a bit carried away with
their sub-arguments in Breaking Together, its overall thrust is clear
and compelling. [[Many]{.mark} of the [world's]{.mark}
**natural**]{.underline} [and]{.underline} **[human-made
[systems]{.mark}]{.underline}**, which combine to make up "industrial
consumer society", [[are under]{.underline} **[severe
stress]{.underline}**]{.mark}, or are already cracking. [[These]{.mark}
[systems are **interdependent**]{.mark}]{.underline},
[**[complex]{.underline}**, **[precarious]{.underline}**
[and]{.underline} **[nonlinear]{.underline}**]{.mark} -- [which means
[change can occur]{.mark} not just **gradually**]{.underline}
[and]{.underline} **[predictably]{.underline}**, [but also
**[abruptly]{.mark}**]{.underline}[,
**[drastically]{.underline}**]{.mark}. [[A sudden breakdown in]{.mark}
one part of the **[overarching structure]{.mark}**]{.underline} [[of
global capitalism]{.mark} **can**]{.underline} -- and does -- **[trigger
disruptions]{.underline}** [in other areas.]{.underline} For example,
[if extreme weather led to widespread]{.underline} **[crop
failures]{.underline}** across multiple wheat-growing regions -- a
possibility known as "a multi-breadbasket failure" -- [this would also
**trigger economic**]{.underline} [and]{.underline} **[political
chaos.]{.underline}** This, in turn, would make it much more difficult
for the entire world to immediately transition away from fossil fuels
and towards renewable energy, to avoid calamitous climate change. And
[that's without getting into the question of whether we
have]{.underline} **[enough rare earth metals]{.underline}** to make
such a miraculous transition. (See Chapter 3, "Energy Collapse" for the
short answer -- we don't.)

### Impact\-\--Root Cause\-\--Warming\-\--2NC/1NR

#### Capitalism is the [root cause]{.underline} of [climate change]{.underline}.

Tahmeed **Shafiq 24**. A writer in Toronto. Why a carbon-free world
isn\'t possible with capitalism. Broadview Magazine. 3-14-2024.
https://broadview.org/carbon-free-capitalism-climate-change/

Yet as the [planet continues to]{.underline}
**[deteriorate]{.underline}**, climate activists are finding more common
cause with my revolutionary friend than they might care to admit. While
many would part ways on the topic of communism, both camps see unbridled
[[capitalism]{.underline}]{.mark} as [[a]{.underline} **[threat to
humanity]{.underline}**]{.mark}. Both assert that [economic
justice]{.underline} for all is [key to]{.underline} our **[collective
survival]{.underline}**.

But what, exactly, are the links between capitalism and climate
disruption? I started looking at the research and was surprised. This
modern brand of anti-capitalism doesn't necessarily embrace the Marxist
or communist call to abolish capitalism. It only requires believers to
be [critical of]{.underline} **[consumerism]{.underline}**
[and]{.underline} **[Big Oil.]{.underline}**

"To [mainstream commerce]{.underline}, the [[Earth]{.underline}]{.mark}
is [[both]{.underline} [loot and dump]{.underline}]{.mark}," the British
environmentalist George Monbiot wrote in his book Out of the Wreckage.
"[Commercial activity]{.underline}, broadly speaking, [consists
of]{.underline} **[[extracting]{.underline}]{.mark}**
[[resources]{.mark} from a hole in the ground]{.underline} on one side
of the planet, inducing people to buy them, then [[dumping them]{.mark}
a few [days later]{.mark}]{.underline} in a hole in the ground on the
other side."

As well, many concrete climate solutions follow from an anti-capitalist
approach to climate change --- all surprisingly hope-inducing at a time
when [meaningful action is]{.underline} **[stalling]{.underline}**.

Which raises the question: Are we missing out on important ideas because
we assume these schools of thought are fringe, boring or, worse,
irrelevant?

You don't need to have any particular politics to recognize that the
climate crisis is overwhelmingly attributable to economic activity. A
study in 2019 by the Colorado-based Climate Accountability Institute,
for example, found that [from the birth of]{.underline}
**[industry]{.underline}** in 1751 to 2017, the [production]{.underline}
[and]{.underline} [burning]{.underline} [of products from]{.underline}
just [103]{.underline} fossil fuel [companies]{.underline} was
[responsible]{.underline} [for]{.underline} nearly **[70]{.underline}**
[percent of all]{.underline} the [**g**reen**h**ouse **g**a**s**
emissions]{.underline}.

From 1965 onward, once the [[whole planet had]{.underline}]{.mark} an
[**[endless hunger]{.underline}** [for]{.underline}
**[energy]{.underline}**]{.mark}, the activities and products of just 20
of those companies contributed a third of all emissions. They include
[[Chevron]{.underline}]{.mark}, [[Exxon]{.mark}Mobil]{.underline},
[[BP]{.underline}]{.mark} and the state-owned [companies]{.underline} of
[Saudi]{.underline} Arabia, [Russia]{.underline}, [Iran]{.underline} and
[India]{.underline}, among others.

Once [oil and coal]{.underline} are extracted, it is the
**[[rich]{.underline}]{.mark}** who [[burn]{.mark} it [the
most]{.mark}]{.underline}. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate
Change, the team at the United Nations responsible for assessing
scientific research on the matter, said in 2022 that
[households]{.underline} "[with]{.underline} the [highest per capita
emissions contribute]{.underline} a **[disproportionately
[large]{.mark}]{.underline}** [[share of]{.underline}]{.mark}
\[[global]{.underline} household\] [[emissions]{.underline}]{.mark}."

How disproportionate? On a planet of eight billion people, the richest
[one percent contribute]{.underline} the [same share]{.underline} of
yearly emissions [as]{.underline} the [poorest two-thirds]{.underline},
according to the Stockholm Environment Institute. To help visualize
those numbers, imagine the population of Germany emitting about as much
carbon dioxide as the populations of North America, Europe and Asia
combined. Billions of people use electricity, drive cars, cook with gas
and buy tonnes of plastic products every year and still emit less than
the number of people who watched the Super Bowl in 2023.

No matter what scale you look at, [[climate change]{.mark}
is]{.underline} deeply [**[tied]{.underline}** [to economic
activity]{.underline}]{.mark}. [[Industry feeds]{.underline}]{.mark} it;
[[consumers sustain it]{.underline}]{.mark}. The people most affected by
the climate crisis are always the most dispossessed, whether we look at
[[flooding]{.mark} island nations in the [Pacific]{.mark}]{.underline}
or [[Indigenous]{.underline}]{.mark} Peoples [[in]{.mark} the
[Amazon]{.mark}]{.underline} [[defending]{.underline}]{.mark} their
[[land from logging companies]{.underline}]{.mark}. A [lack of
wealth]{.underline} or rights [makes you]{.underline}
**[vulnerable]{.underline}** to the whims of the powerful. If you accept
that premise, then you can't say the [[problem]{.underline}]{.mark} is a
few greedy companies operating in a few countries. It [has to
be]{.underline} **[[systemic]{.underline}]{.mark}**, and the
[[only]{.mark} accurate [label]{.mark}]{.underline} for that system
[[is]{.underline}]{.mark} "**[[capitalism]{.underline}]{.mark}**."

If you find that difficult to accept, you're not alone. Right-wing
politicians have increasingly begun referring to progressive policies
they dislike as "authoritarian," a word that recalls the Red Scare of
the Cold War. This rhetoric is more prominent in the United States than
in Canada, with 60 per- cent of Americans viewing socialism negatively,
according to a 2022 Pew Research survey.

"We're so used to capitalism that we don't necessarily even know it when
we see it," says Emily Huddart Kennedy, a sociologist at the University
of British Columbia who researches sustainable food movements.

She says many people find socialism and communism so unpalatable that
the distaste can "short-circuit people's ability to think thoughtfully
and reflectively." The reaction is so strong that she's noticed some
anti-capitalist campaigners have to avoid talking about their principles
in order to mobilize more people. "One participant said, 'If I start
spewing off about capitalism and power and oppression, nobody's going to
listen to me.'"

This phenomenon isn't entirely caused by simple bias. People also
genuinely struggle to come up with concrete forms of climate action that
don't require a capitalist economy, Kennedy says. For example, trying to
create an alternative food system is difficult without the capitalist
constructs of land tenure rights and industry partners who have
financing and supply chains. Devising feasible solutions and being an
anti-capitalist seem to be mutually exclusive.

Even academic economists, who like to say that they are ideologically
neutral, have trouble assessing anti-capitalist ideas without bias.
Between 2017 and 2018, economists Mohsen Javdani of Simon Fraser
University in Vancouver and HaJoon Chang of the School of Oriental and
African Studies in London surveyed 2,425 economists around the world for
ideological bias. Participants were presented with opinions from notable
economist thinkers with the attributions jumbled up. Then they were
asked whether they agreed with the opinions. In most cases, participants
were more likely to agree with a statement when told it came from a
mainstream thinker, like Adam Smith, than a less mainstream one, like
Karl Marx.

Neither of the researchers is an outright Marxist, by the way. Chang
believes in reforming the free market, not abolishing it. In his breezy
book 23 Things They Don't Tell You About Capitalism, published in 2010,
he points to the rapid economic growth of East Asian countries like
Taiwan and South Korea as an example of how capitalism can be a force
for good.

In fact, it's a philosopher-economist, Kohei Saito, of the University of
Tokyo, who has attempted, as he puts it, to "resolve the tension between
Red and Green." His 2020 book, Capital in the Anthropocene, became a
surprise hit in Japan. In early 2023, he released a sequel of sorts,
Marx in the Anthropocene, that drew on notebooks Karl Marx kept in the
last 15 years of his life. This was Saito's first popular book in
English, and reviews soon flooded in from the New York Times, the
Guardian and other esteemed publications that seemed to be taking Saito
seriously.

At the heart of his analysis is Marx's conclusion not just that wealth
is produced by the many and hoarded by the few, but that
[[nature]{.underline}]{.mark} itself [is [a]{.mark}]{.underline}
[**[casualty]{.underline}** [of capitalism]{.underline}]{.mark}. For
example, in 1869, Marx documented his concern about the consequences of
industrialized livestock rearing, driven by a growing appetite for meat.
"It will not be long before the Irish farmer experiences that this
system will end in the total exhaustion of the land," he wrote.

In other words, Saito argues that [[capitalism]{.underline} [and a
healthy planet are]{.underline} **[intrinsically at
odds]{.underline}**]{.mark}. He even says that our [individual lives are
**stunted**]{.underline} because [[we've lost]{.mark} the]{.underline}
**[[joy]{.underline}]{.mark}** [that comes [from engaging with]{.mark}
[nature]{.mark}]{.underline}. [We [seek fulfilment
in]{.mark}]{.underline} "**[[destructive]{.underline}]{.mark}**,
**[extravagant]{.underline}** [and]{.underline}
**[wasteful]{.underline}** [[products]{.underline}]{.mark}."

an **[[irreplaceable]{.mark} natural [wilderness]{.mark}]{.underline}**
-- [[is]{.mark} merely another step in **[capitalism]{.mark}**'s
**shaping of the world**]{.underline}. From the "unification of the

[**[capitalist system]{.mark}** has]{.underline} from its earliest days
[[**reordered** and]{.underline}]{.mark} then [[**adapted** to]{.mark}

### Impact\-\--Root Cause\-\--War\-\--2NC/1NR

#### Capitalism makes [imperialist wars]{.underline} for [conquest]{.underline} inevitable, shattering any [potential]{.underline} for peace.

capitalism breeds imperialism and war.\" 2/15/2024.

[[Ferocious **capitalist rivalry**]{.mark} has [caused
**appalling**]{.mark} **levels** of **armed
[conflict]{.mark}**]{.underline} and suffering for people across the
world.

[[**Imperialism** is **inseparable** from]{.underline}]{.mark} the
[**[competition]{.mark}** that also develops [between]{.mark} **rival
[capitalist states]{.mark}** [that struggle for domination]{.mark}
**economically** and]{.underline} often
**[[militarily]{.underline}]{.mark}**.

The Russian revolutionary Vladimir Lenin wrote his short book
Imperialism: The Highest Stage of Capitalism in 1916 to explain the
economic underpinning of the war and the features of a global system of
conflict between capitalist states.

He wrote, "Imperialism means the partitioning of the world" and "High
monopoly profits for a handful of very rich countries."

[[Some]{.underline}]{.mark} at the time [[thought]{.underline}]{.mark}
that [[the]{.mark} **terrible [destruction]{.mark}** [war
unleashes]{.mark}, and the **chaos** it would cause [for]{.mark}
**capitalist [profits]{.mark}**[, meant the
**rich**]{.mark}]{.underline} and powerful [[would]{.underline}]{.mark}
increasingly [[avoid war]{.underline}]{.mark}.

Contrary to those who argued that bosses and states would cooperate with
each other and become a force for peace, Lenin said that [[any balance
of power between]{.mark} the contending [imperialists could only be
**temporary**]{.mark}]{.underline}.

[[When]{.mark} the **[economic weight]{.mark}** of one
state]{.underline} or group of states [[shifted]{.mark} **new bloody
[struggles]{.mark}** [burst out, destroying]{.mark} any
**[agreements]{.mark}** peacefully [to divide the]{.mark} **world
[market]{.mark}** made **previously**.]{.underline}

[The early stage]{.underline} of capitalism [sees relatively **small
firms** competing]{.underline} with each other mainly inside a domestic
market.

But the process of competition sees some crush their adversaries. [The
[victors]{.mark} emerge **bigger**, **more powerful** and ready to
**expand internationally**]{.underline}.

[As they move beyond]{.underline} the home market, [they [demand]{.mark}
their [state backs]{.mark}]{.underline} them to ensure **[smooth
[profit]{.mark}-making]{.underline}**. Sometimes [[they]{.mark} also
[want **armed force** to batter]{.mark} down
**[barriers]{.mark}**]{.underline} to trade or to clear out "unhelpful"
rulers.

The gunboat blasting away on some foreign shore became a key symbol of
the British Empire because of this method.

Imperialism is the fusing of economic and geopolitical competition. And
states' warmongering also reacted back on economic systems.

Shifting balance of power

Fifty years before the First World War Britain was the dominant
industrial power. But in the run up to the war, Germany was challenging
it as the second biggest economy.

Germany and other states challenged Britain militarily, and
economically.

At some points, such as at the Congress of Berlin at the end of the
nineteenth century, all the powers could agree to divide up Africa
between them---without involving any Africans, of course. But when
almost all such sharing of the spoils was exhausted, any new expansion
could happen only by taking away from some other state.

No state was content to "freeze" its areas of domination and control.
Instead their [**economic [accumulation]{.mark}** [led to **world
war**]{.mark}]{.underline}.

Unlike previous pandemics, [COVID-19 is part of a wave of [new
infectious diseases]{.mark} that scientists say mark the arrival of a
"qualitatively distinct" period in human health]{.underline},\[6\] that
will "reverse many of the 20th century's advances in the control of
lethal infectious disease. ... \[and\] [return humanity to an earlier
health pattern [characterized by **high mortality**]{.mark} from lethal
infectious disease]{.underline}."\[7\] Contrary to optimistic 20th
Century predictions, infectious diseases have not been conquered. [[New
diseases]{.mark} are [proliferating, and many]{.mark} thought to have
been wiped out [have returned as major threats]{.mark} to human
health]{.underline}.

The list of new arrivals incudes [chikungunya, Q fever, Chagas disease,
**multiple influenzas**, swine fever, Lyme disease, Zika, SARS, **MERS,
Nipah**, Mpox, Ebola, and many more]{.underline}, on top of resurgent
enemies like [cholera, anthrax, polio, measles, tuberculosis, **malaria
and yellow fever**]{.underline}. According to the Proceedings of the
National Academy of Sciences, at current rates the [annual [probability
of extreme epidemics could **triple**]{.mark} in coming
decades.]{.underline}\[8\]

As David Quammen writes, the [simultaneous emergence and
[re-emergence]{.mark} of multiple contagious diseases [is no
coincidence]{.mark}]{.underline}[.]{.mark}

"Make no mistake, [they are connected, these disease outbreaks coming
one after another]{.underline}. And they are not simply happening to us;
[they [represent the **unintended results** of things we are
doing]{.mark}]{.underline}. They reflect the convergence of two forms of
crises on our planet. [The first **[crisis is ecological]{.mark}**, the
second is medical. As the two intersect, their joint consequences appear
as a pattern of weird and terrible new diseases]{.underline}, emerging
from unexpected sources."\[9\]

In mid-2020, while scientifically illiterate politicians were still
insisting that COVID-19 was no worse than flu and would soon fade away,
the UN's Intergovernmental Science-Policy Platform on Biodiversity and
Ecosystem Services (IPBES) convened a [multidisciplinary scientific
panel to summarize the state of scientific knowledge about COVID-19 and
other diseases]{.underline} that spread from animals to humans.\[10\]
The experts' report --- which had the singular advantage that it was not
watered down or edited by politicians and bureaucrats --- offered a very
different account of the dangers posed by zoonotic diseases in our time.
Some excerpts:

"[[Pandemics represent an **existential threat**]{.mark} to the health
and welfare of people across our planet]{.underline}. The scientific
evidence reviewed in this report demonstrates that pandemics are
[[becoming more frequent]{.mark}, driven by a continued rise in the
underlying emerging disease events that spark them]{.underline}. Without
preventative strategies, [pandemics [will emerge more often, spread more
rapidly, kill more people,]{.mark} and affect the global economy with
more devastating impact than ever before]{.underline}."

"The risk of pandemics is increasing rapidly, with more than five new
diseases emerging in people every year, any one of which has the
potential to spread and become pandemic. The risk of a pandemic is
driven by exponentially increasing anthropogenic changes. Blaming
wildlife for the emergence of diseases is thus erroneous, because
emergence is caused by human activities and the impacts of these
activities on the environment."

"The [[underlying causes]{.mark} of pandemics are the same [global
environmental changes]{.mark} that drive biodiversity loss and climate
change]{.underline}. These include [**[land-use]{.mark}** change,
**[agricultural expansion]{.mark}** and intensification, and wildlife
**[trade and consumption.]{.mark}**]{.underline}"

In short, the [global ecological destruction that Earth System
scientists have dubbed [the **Great Acceleration** is driving humanity
into]{.mark} an age of [Great Sickening]{.mark}]{.underline}. Unless
radical changes are made, we can expect that COVID-19 will not be the
last global pandemic --- or the most deadly.

Over the past four centuries, [[the quest for]{.mark}
natural]{.underline}, in particular [energy [resources
has]{.mark}]{.underline} [[been the]{.mark} [major driver for]{.mark}
[Western peoples]{.mark}]{.underline} [[to]{.underline}]{.mark}
penetrate and **[[explore the Arctic]{.mark} region.]{.underline}**
[**Natural resource endowments** have contributed to
**[constructing]{.mark}** [the Arctic region as a]{.mark}
"**[commodity-supply space]{.mark}**"]{.underline} (Bridge, 2001).
[Populations of whales and other marine mammals, deposits of coal, oil
and gas in the Circumpolar North have been interpreted as "**Arctic
riches**"]{.underline} [and **exported** as **valuable commodities** to
distant **consumer markets**.]{.underline} Forces driving the
incorporation of the Arctic into the global energy economy have come
from outside the Arctic region -- where benefits of the Arctic
exploitation were mainly ripped off. [[Scarcity of]{.mark} local
[population]{.mark} has [added to an image of the Arctic as a **terra
nullius**]{.mark}]{.underline}, a peopleless space that can be
understood and discovered through geology and law. [Severe climatic
conditions have brought a romantic flavour to Western narratives of
Arctic development as]{.underline} heroic exploration, [making the High
North an articulation of **human bravery** and **technological
progress**.]{.underline} [From **whale oil** to **offshore
drilling**]{.underline}, [the patterns of [material production]{.mark}
in the Arctic corresponded to international energy flows,
**[embedding]{.mark}** the [history of Arctic **exploration** within
**human energy** history **more broadly**.]{.mark}]{.underline}

Since the late 2000s, changes in the natural environment coupled with
assessments of Arctic hydrocarbon deposits presented by geoscientists,
attractive investment packages produced by energy consultancies, and the
mounting energy needs of the developing world, have prompted advances in
policies and technologies for extraction and transportation of Arctic
resources. [[Discourses on energy policy]{.mark} [articulated]{.mark} by
actors from outside the Arctic produced [an image of the Arctic as a
"**final extractive frontier**," defining the Arctic in a
**resource-geographical way**]{.mark}]{.underline}. These discourses on
"Arctic riches" embedded within the broader international political
economy of energy acted as a form of entitlement to pursue extractive
activities in the Arctic. As demonstrated in this Chapter, the concept
of resource colonialism provides a powerful tool to deconstruct the
complex web of expectations about Arctic energy futures. In particular,
it shows how the remoteness of the Arctic from industrial and financial
centers that has been previously leveraged through Arctic resource
endowment has acquired a new dimension with ever-tighter incorporation
of the Arctic into the global energy system.

Until recently, the degree of apparent resource availability in the
Arctic has been the prime justification for investment into the large
scale industrialization of the High North. Yet, the fact that oil and
gas can be produced with greater ease and at less expense in many other
parts of the world, together with the growing viability of alternative
energy sources in the global energy mix and the global drop in oil
price, have undermined interest in Arctic energy development. As
peripheral Arctic was becoming global Arctic, its image as a remote
resource base increasingly came into conflict with intensifying concerns
over the environmental status of the Arctic and the planetary
consequences of Arctic climate change. With the increasing salience of
climate issues in global energy governance Arctic hydrocarbons are no
longer considered solely as a source of energy, but also as a source of
pollution. The shift from the "old" (extraction and consumption of
fossil fuels) to the "new" (carbon markets and offsetting) carbon
governance (Bridge, 2011) has also impacted the cost structure of Arctic
energy, adding the cost of carbon mitigation to already costly
exploration and transportation.

The core controversies of Arctic energy development result from the
globalization of the Arctic made manifest through its becoming embedded
within global commodity chains and global climate governance. Thus we
are at the stage when the global Arctic is simultaneously seen as an
empty space to be conquered and benefited from and, in strict contrast,
as fragile space to be protected and preserved. The tension between
these two narratives marks a significant change in the international
political economy of energy that underpins contemporary postindustrial
capitalism and offers an entry point into conversations that frame the
energy-climate nexus as "carbon governance" (Bridge, 2011). Arguably,
[[the]{.mark} ways in which [material activities will be **organized**
in the future is **inherently connected** to the **political
choices**]{.mark} [that prioritize the **image** of the Arctic as an
**extractive frontier** or as a **global
sanctuary**.]{.mark}]{.underline}

[[The Arctic]{.mark} is experiencing increased accessibility to

[[Traditional land-use]{.underline}]{.mark} and territorial rights of

**industrial [activities]{.mark}**]{.underline}, [[**resulting** in
the]{.mark} **[displacement]{.mark}** of **[common lands]{.mark}** [and

fueling intense [conflict]{.mark} in the region]{.underline} (Herrmann
and Heinämäki 2017; Naykanchina 2012; Keil 2014). [The introduction of

perceived by some Arctic Indigenous Peoples]{.underline} (e.g., the Sami

processes of **[dispossession and colonialism]{.mark}**]{.underline},
which disrupt reindeer herding practices (Soili, Tanja, and Ilari 2021;
Normann 2021). The ecological evidence supporting the dominant narrative
and associated policy about the Arctic pastoral landscape overlooks
alternative scientific evidence, interpretations aligned with
nonequilibrium ecology, and Indigenous knowledge of reindeer herders.
Consequently, these alternative perspectives are often ignored by
government institutions regulating caribou management (Benjaminsen et
al. 2015).

Another important aspect of the colonial project in Inuit Nunaat (and,
in fact, in many other colonized regions), brilliantly explored in
Demuth's work, is the remodelling of the relation between humanity and
nature in colonized spaces. Be it with land, the sea, sea ice or
animals, [[capitalism as a **mode of production**]{.underline}]{.mark},
and neo-extractivism as a path of economic development under such
system, [[demand]{.mark} the [construction of an instrumental]{.mark}
[relation to]{.mark} these **[non-human elements]{.mark}** [of the
**environment**]{.mark}]{.underline}. [This understanding entails a
relation]{.underline} between human and non-human nature developed
[under the **mediation** of **value**]{.underline} and valorisation --
[the main goals of [capital **accumulation**]{.mark} and **economic
activity** under **capitalist relations** of

and temporality **[[of]{.underline}]{.mark}**
([**[capitalist]{.underline}**) **[economic
practices]{.underline}**]{.mark}. While Demuth discusses how Beringian
cultures in general did not have stark distinctions between humanity and
non-humanity, Shadian, on the other hand, highlights how such relations,
among the Inuit are expressed through the concept of inua. Rather than
seeing man as a separate of and dominating nature, [Inuit populations
understood **themselves** not only as **part of nature**, but also as
being **stewards** of the non-**human nature** and of their]{.underline}
homelands [and home-environments.]{.underline}

In the present text we focused on how Arctic colonialisms came to be and
the technologies they employed in the attempt of disarticulating Inuit
livelihoods, their social and cultural practices; this is not the only
history to be told. The Inuit -- and, in fact Indigenous peoples in the
Arctic and in the world -- have a long history of resistance to and
struggle against colonialism. The Inuit Circumpolar Council is an
institution born of such efforts and, to this day, it disputes the
contents and objectives of Arctic policies through the development of
its own political instruments and Arctic policies in many dimensions.
Rejecting the acritical acceptance of policies based on settler-colonial
understandings of Arctic geopolitics and economic development, the ICC
articulates understandings of autonomy, self-government and economic
development other than those deployed by settler-colonial, capitalist,
westphalian States.

[**[Understanding colonialisms]{.mark}** and their development [is an
**important step** in]{.mark} [reckoning with the **colonial
violence**]{.mark} [underlying]{.mark} **present-day rationales** for
**dealing** with **geopolitical** and economic **issues** in [the

by]{.underline} indigenous populations [and their]{.underline}
[**social** and **political practice**]{.underline} [might
inform]{.underline} [future debates on Arctic]{.underline} geopolitics
and economic [development]{.underline}. While such struggles put in
question the Euro-American definitions of economic development,
sovereignty and self-government, they were also invested in the
construction of alternative understandings and alternative social
practices. [[Unearthing such understandings]{.underline}]{.mark} and
their impact over present-day Arctic Indigenous policies, [[as

Introduction

Contemporary [[capitalist civilization is]{.mark} in
**crisis**]{.underline}. [The]{.underline} unlimited [accumulation of
**capital**]{.underline}, commodification of everything, ruthless
[exploitation]{.underline} of labor and nature, [and]{.underline}
attendant [brutal **competition** undermine]{.underline} [the bases of a
**sustainable future**]{.underline}, thereby [[put]{.mark}ting
[the]{.mark} **very [survival of]{.mark} [the]{.mark} human [species at
risk]{.mark}**]{.underline}. [The]{.underline} deep, [systemic threat we
face demands a deep]{.underline}, systemic [change]{.underline}: a Great
Transition.

In synthesizing the basic tenets of ecology and the Marxist critique of
political economy, [ecosocialism offers a **radical**]{.underline}
**[alternative]{.underline}** to an unsustainable status quo.
[Rejecting]{.underline} a [capitalist]{.underline} definition of
"[progress]{.underline}" [based on]{.underline} market [growth
and]{.underline} [quantitative expansion]{.underline} (which, as Marx
shows, is a destructive progress[), it advocates policies founded on
**non-monetary**]{.underline} **[criteria]{.underline}**, such as social
needs, individual well-being, and ecological equilibrium.
[Ecosocialism]{.underline} [puts forth a **critique**]{.underline}
[of]{.underline} both mainstream "[market ecology]{.underline}," [which
does not **challenge**]{.underline} [the]{.underline} capitalist
**[system]{.underline}**, and "productivist socialism," which ignores
natural limits.

As people increasingly realize how the economic and ecological crises
intertwine, ecosocialism has been gaining adherents. Ecosocialism, as a
movement, is relatively new, but some of its basic arguments date back
to the writings of Marx and Engels. Now, intellectuals and activists are
recovering this legacy and seeking a radical restructuring of the
economy according to the principles of democratic ecological planning,
putting human and planetary needs first and foremost.

The "actually existing socialisms" of the twentieth century, with their
often environmentally oblivious bureaucracies, do not offer an
attractive model for today's ecosocialists. Rather, we must chart a new
path forward, one that links with the myriad movements around the globe
that share the conviction that a better world is not only possible, but
also necessary.

[Democratic **Ecological Planning**]{.underline}

The core of [**[ecosocialism]{.underline}** [is]{.underline}]{.mark}
[the concept of [democratic]{.mark} ecological]{.underline}
**[[planning]{.underline}]{.mark}**, [wherein [the **population
itself**]{.mark}]{.underline}[, [not]{.underline}]{.mark} "**[the
market]{.underline}**" or [a]{.underline} **[Politburo]{.underline}**,
[make]{.underline} the main [decisions about the economy]{.underline}.
Early in the Great Transition to this new way of life, [with its
new]{.underline} [mode of **production**]{.underline} and consumption,
some sectors of [[the **economy**]{.underline} [must
be]{.underline}]{.mark} suppressed (e.g., the extraction of fossil fuels
implicated in the climate crisis) or
**[[restructured]{.underline}]{.mark}**, while new sectors are
developed. Economic [transformation must be accompanied by]{.underline}
active [pursuit of full employment]{.underline} [with **equal
conditions**]{.underline} [of work and wages]{.underline}.
[This]{.underline} **[egalitarian vision]{.underline}** [is]{.underline}
**[essential]{.underline}** both for building a just society and for
engaging the support of the working class for the structural
transformation of the productive forces.

Ultimately, [such [a vision is **irreconcilable** with **private
control**]{.mark} of the means of **production** and of the **planning**
process. In particular, [for **investments**]{.mark} [and]{.mark}
**[tech]{.mark}**nological]{.underline} [[innovation to]{.underline}
[serve]{.underline}]{.mark} [the **[common good]{.mark}**]{.underline},
[decision-making must be taken away]{.underline} [from]{.underline} the
banks and **[capitalist enterprises]{.underline}** that currently
dominate, [and put in the **public domain**]{.underline}. Then,
**[society itself]{.underline}**, and [neither]{.underline} a small
[oligarchy]{.underline} of property owners [nor an **elite of
techno-bureaucrats**]{.underline}, [will]{.underline} democratically
[decide which]{.underline} productive [lines are to be
**privileged**]{.underline}, and how resources are to be invested in
education, health, and culture. Major decisions on investment
priorities---such as terminating all coal-fired facilities or directing
agricultural subsidies to organic production---would be taken by direct
popular vote. Other, less important decisions would be taken by elected
bodies, on the relevant national, regional, or local scale.

Although conservatives fearmonger about "central planning," democratic
ecological planning ultimately supports more freedom, not less, for
several reasons. First, it offers liberation from the reified "economic
laws" of the capitalist system that shackle individuals in what Max
Weber called an "iron cage." Prices of goods would not be left to the
"laws of supply and demand," but would, instead, reflect social and
political priorities, with the use of taxes and subsidies to incentivize
social goods and disincentivize social ills. Ideally, as the
ecosocialist transition moves forward, more products and services
critical for meeting fundamental human needs would be freely
distributed, according to the will of the citizens.

Second, ecosocialism heralds a substantial increase in free time.
Planning and the reduction of labor time are the two decisive steps
towards what Marx called "the kingdom of freedom." A significant
increase of free time is, in fact, a condition for the participation of
working people in the democratic discussion and management of economy
and of society.

Last, democratic ecological planning represents a whole society's
exercise of its freedom to control the decisions that affect its
destiny. If the democratic ideal would not grant political
decision-making power to a small elite, why should the same principle
not apply to economic decisions? Under capitalism, use-value---the worth
of a product or service to well-being---exists only in the service of
exchange-value, or value on the market. Thus, [many **products** in
contemporary]{.underline} **[society]{.underline}** [are]{.underline}
socially **[useless]{.underline}**, [or]{.underline} [designed for rapid
turnover]{.underline} ("**[planned obsolescence]{.underline}**"). [By
contrast, in a **planned** ecosocialist **economy**]{.underline},
[use-value would be the **only criteria** for the
**production**]{.underline} of goods and services, [with
**far-reaching** economic]{.underline}, social, and ecological
**[consequences]{.underline}**.1

[Planning would focus on]{.underline} large-scale [economic
**decisions**]{.underline}, [not the **small-scale ones**]{.underline}
[that]{.underline} might [affect]{.underline} local restaurants,
groceries, small shops, or artisan [enterprises]{.underline}.
Importantly, such planning is consistent with workers' self-management
of their productive units. The decision, for example, to transform a
plant from producing automobiles to producing buses and trams would be
taken by society as a whole, but the internal organization and
functioning of the enterprise would be democratically managed by its
workers. There has been much discussion about the "centralized" or
"decentralized" character of planning, but most important is democratic
control at all levels---local, regional, national, continental, or
international. For example, planetary ecological issues such as global
warming must be dealt with on a global scale, and thereby require some
form of global democratic planning. This nested, democratic
decision-making is quite the opposite of what is usually described,
often dismissively, as "central planning," since decisions are not taken
by any "center," but democratically decided by the affected population
at the appropriate scale.

Democratic and pluralist debate would occur at all levels. Through
parties, platforms, or other political movements, varied propositions
would be submitted to the people, and delegates would be elected
accordingly. However, representative democracy must be
complemented---and corrected---by Internet-enabled direct democracy,
through which people choose---at the local, national, and, later, global
level---among major social and ecological options. Should public
transportation be free? Should the owners of private cars pay special
taxes to subsidize public transportation? Should solar energy be
subsidized in order to compete with fossil energy? Should the work week
be reduced to 30 hours, 25 hours, or less, with the attendant reduction
of production?

Such democratic planning needs expert input, but its role is
educational, to present informed views on alternative outcomes for
consideration by popular decision-making processes. What guarantee is
there that the people will make ecologically sound decisions? None.
Ecosocialism wagers that democratic decisions will become increasingly
reasoned and enlightened as culture changes and the grip of commodity
fetishism is broken. One cannot imagine such a new society without the
achievement, through struggle, self-education, and social experience, of
a high level of socialist and ecological consciousness. In any case, are
not the alternatives---the blind market or an ecological dictatorship of
"experts"---much more dangerous?

[[The]{.underline}]{.mark} **[Great [Transition]{.mark}]{.underline}**
[from]{.underline} **[capitalist]{.underline}** destructive
**[progress]{.underline}** [to **ecosocialism**]{.underline} [is a
**historical** process]{.underline}, a [permanent
**revolutionary**]{.underline} **[transformation]{.underline}** [of
**society**]{.underline}, culture, [and **mindsets**]{.underline}.
[Enacting [this]{.mark} transition [leads]{.mark} not only to a **new**
mode of **production**]{.underline} [and an egalitarian and democratic
**society**]{.underline}, but [also [to an **alternative**]{.mark} mode
of **life**]{.underline}, [a new **[ecosocialist
civilization]{.mark}**]{.underline}, [beyond]{.underline} the reign of
[money]{.underline}, beyond [consumption]{.underline} habits
artificially [produced by advertising]{.underline}, and
[[beyond]{.underline}]{.mark} the **[unlimited
[production]{.mark}]{.underline}** of commodities that are useless
and/or harmful to the environment. Such a transformative process depends
on the active support of the vast majority of the population for an
ecosocialist program. The decisive factor in development of socialist
consciousness and ecological awareness is the collective experience of
struggle, from local and partial confrontations to the radical change of
global society as a whole.

The Growth Question

The issue of economic growth has divided socialists and
environmentalists. Ecosocialism, however, rejects the dualistic frame of
growth versus degrowth, development versus anti-development, because
both positions share a purely quantitative conception of productive
forces. A third position resonates more with the task ahead: the
qualitative transformation of development.

A new development paradigm means putting an end to the egregious waste
of resources under capitalism, driven by large-scale production of
useless and harmful products. The arms industry is, of course, a
dramatic example, but, more generally, the primary purpose of many of
the "goods" produced---with their planned obsolescence---is to generate
profit for large corporations. The issue is not excessive consumption in
the abstract, but the prevalent type of consumption, based as it is on
massive waste and the conspicuous and compulsive pursuit of novelties
promoted by "fashion." A new society would orient production towards the
satisfaction of authentic needs, including water, food, clothing,
housing, and such basic services as health, education, transport, and
culture.

Obviously, the countries of the Global South, where these needs are very
far from being satisfied, must pursue greater classical
"development"---railroads, hospitals, sewage systems, and other
infrastructure. Still, rather than emulate how affluent countries built
their productive systems, these countries can pursue development in far
more environmentally friendly ways, including the rapid introduction of
renewable energy. While many poorer countries will need to expand
agricultural production to nourish hungry, growing populations, the
ecosocialist solution is to promote agroecology methods rooted in family
units, cooperatives, or larger-scale collective farms---not the
destructive industrialized agribusiness methods involving intensive
inputs of pesticides, chemicals, and GMOs.2

At the same time, the ecosocialist transformation would end the heinous
debt system the Global South now confronts as well as the exploitation
of its resources by advanced industrial countries and rapidly developing
countries like China. Instead, we can envision a strong flow of
technical and economic assistance from North to South rooted in a robust
sense of solidarity and the recognition that planetary problems require
planetary solutions. This need not entail that people in affluent
countries "reduce their standard of living"---only that they shun the
obsessive consumption, induced by the capitalist system, of useless
commodities that do not meet real needs or contribute to human
well-being and flourishing.

But how do we distinguish authentic from artificial and
counterproductive needs? To a considerable degree, the latter are
stimulated by the mental manipulation of advertising. In contemporary
capitalist societies, the advertising industry has invaded all spheres
of life, shaping everything from the food we eat and the clothes we wear
to sports, culture, religion, and politics. Promotional advertising has
become ubiquitous, insidiously infesting our streets, landscapes, and
traditional and digital media, molding habits of conspicuous and
compulsive consumption. Moreover, the ad industry itself is a source of
considerable waste of natural resources and labor time, ultimately paid
by the consumer, for a branch of "production" that lies in direct
contradiction with real social-ecological needs. While indispensable to
the capitalist market economy, the advertising industry would have no
place in a society in transition to ecosocialism; it would be replaced
by consumer associations that vet and disseminate information on goods
and services. While these changes are already happening to some extent,
old habits would likely persist for some years, and nobody has the right
to dictate peoples' desires. Altering patterns of consumption is an
ongoing educational challenge within a historical process of cultural
change.

A fundamental premise of ecosocialism is that in a society without sharp
class divisions and capitalist alienation, "being" will take precedence
over "having." Instead of seeking endless goods, people pursue greater
free time, and the personal achievements and meaning it can bring
through cultural, athletic, recreational, scientific, erotic, artistic,
and political activities. There is no evidence that compulsive
acquisitiveness stems from intrinsic "human nature," as conservative
rhetoric suggests. Rather, it is induced by the commodity fetishism
inherent in the capitalist system, by the dominant ideology, and by
advertising. Ernest Mandel summarizes this critical point well: "The
continual accumulation of more and more goods \[...\] is by no means a
universal and even predominant feature of human behavior. The
development of talents and inclinations for their own sake; the
protection of health and life; care for children; the development of
rich social relations \[...\] become major motivations once basic
material needs have been satisfied." 3

Of course, even a classless society faces conflict and contradiction.
[The **transition**]{.underline} to ecosocialism [would confront
**tensions**]{.underline} between the requirements of protecting the
environment and meeting social needs, between ecological imperatives and
the development of basic infrastructure, between popular consumer habits
and the scarcity of resources, between communitarian and cosmopolitan
impulses. [Struggles]{.underline} among competing [desiderata are
inevitable]{.underline}. Hence, **[weighing]{.underline}**
[and]{.underline} **[balancing]{.underline}** [such]{.underline}
[interests must become the task of a **democratic planning
process**]{.underline}, [liberated from the **imperatives**]{.underline}
[of **capital**]{.underline} and profit-making, to come up with
solutions through transparent, plural, and open public discourse. Such
participatory democracy at all levels does not mean that there will not
be mistakes, but it allows for the self-correction by the members of the
social collectivity of its own mistakes.

Intellectual Roots

Although ecosocialism is a fairly recent phenomenon, its intellectual
roots can be traced back to Marx and Engels. Because environmental
issues were not as salient in the nineteenth century as in our era of
incipient ecological catastrophe, these concerns did not play a central
role in Marx and Engels's works. Nevertheless, their writings use
arguments and concepts vital to the connection between capitalist
dynamics and the destruction of the natural environment, and to the
development of a socialist and ecological alternative to the prevailing
system.

Some passages in Marx and Engels (and certainly in the dominant Marxist
currents that followed) do embrace an uncritical stance toward the
productive forces created by capital, treating the "development of
productive forces" as the main factor in human progress. However, Marx
was radically opposed to what we now call "productivism"--- the
capitalist logic by which the accumulation of capital, wealth, and
commodities becomes an end in itself. The fundamental idea of a
socialist economy---in contrast to the bureaucratic caricatures that
prevailed in the "socialist" experiments of the twentieth century---is
to produce use-values, goods that are necessary for the satisfaction of
human needs, well-being, and fulfillment. The central feature of
technical progress for Marx was not the indefinite growth of products
("having") but the reduction of socially necessary labor and concomitant
increase of free time ("being").4 Marx\'s emphasis on communist
self-development, on free time for artistic, erotic, or intellectual
activities---in contrast to the capitalist obsession with the
consumption of more and more material goods---implies a decisive
reduction of pressure on the natural environment.5

Beyond the presumed benefit for the environment, a key Marxian
contribution to socialist ecological thinking is attributing to
capitalism a metabolic rift---i.e., a disruption of the material
exchange between human societies and the natural environment. The issue
is discussed, inter alia, in a well-known passage of Capital:

Capitalist production \[\...\] disturbs the metabolic interaction
between man and the earth, i.e., prevents the return to the soil of its
constituent elements consumed by man in the form of food and clothing;
hence it hinders the operation of the eternal natural conditions for the
lasting fertility of the soil. \[\...\] All progress in capitalist
agriculture is a progress in the art, not only of robbing the worker,
but of robbing the soil \[\...\]. The more a country \[\...\] develops
itself on the basis of great industry, the more this process of
destruction takes place quickly. Capitalist production \[\...\] only
develops \[\...\] by simultaneously undermining the original sources of
all wealth---the soil and the worker.6

This important passage clarifies Marx's dialectical vision of the
contradictions of "progress" and its destructive consequences for nature
under capitalist conditions. The example, of course, is limited to the
loss of fertility by the soil. But on this basis, Marx draws the broad
insight that capitalist production embodies a tendency to undermine the
"eternal natural conditions." From a similar vantage, Marx reiterates
his more familiar argument that the same predatory logic of capitalism
exploits and debases workers.

While most contemporary ecosocialists are inspired by Marx's insights,
ecology has become far more central to their analysis and action. During
the 1970s and 1980s in Europe and the US, an ecological socialism began
to take shape. Manuel Sacristan, a Spanish dissident-Communist
philosopher, founded the ecosocialist and feminist journal Mientras
Tanto in 1979, introducing the dialectical concept of
"destructive-productive forces." Raymond Williams, a British socialist
and founder of modern cultural studies, became one of the first in
Europe to call for an "ecologically conscious socialism" and is often
credited with coining the term "ecosocialism" itself. André Gorz, a
French philosopher and journalist, argued that political ecology must
contain a critique of economic thought and called for an ecological and
humanist transformation of work. Barry Commoner, an American biologist,
argued that the capitalist system and its technology---and not
population growth---was responsible for the destruction of the
environment, which led him to the conclusion that "some sort of
socialism" was the realistic alternative.7

In the 1980s, James O'Connor founded the influential journal Capitalism,
Nature and Socialism, which was inspired by his idea of the "second
contradiction of capitalism." In this formulation, the first
contradiction is the Marxist one between the forces and relations of
production; the second contradiction lies between the mode of production
and the "conditions of production," especially, the state of the
environment.

A new generation of eco-Marxists appeared in the 2000s, including John
Bellamy Foster and others around the journal Monthly Review, who further
developed the Marxian concept of metabolic rift between human societies
and the environment. In 2001, Joel Kovel and the present author issued
"An Ecosocialist Manifesto," which was further developed by the same
authors, together with Ian Angus, in the 2008 Belem Ecosocialist
Manifesto, which was signed by hundreds of people from forty countries
and distributed at the World Social Forum in 2009. It has since become
an important reference for ecosocialists around the world.8

Why Environmentalists Need to Be Socialists

As these and other authors have shown, capitalism is incompatible with a
sustainable future. [[The]{.underline}]{.mark} **[capitalist
[system]{.mark}]{.underline}**, an economic growth machine propelled by
fossil fuels since the Industrial Revolution[, [is a]{.mark} primary
**[culprit]{.mark}**]{.underline} [[in]{.underline}]{.mark}
**[climate]{.underline}** change [and]{.underline}
[[the]{.underline}]{.mark} wider **[ecological
[crisis]{.mark}]{.underline}** on Earth. [Its]{.underline} irrational
[logic of endless **expansion**]{.underline} and accumulation, waste of
resources, ostentatious consumption, planned obsolescence, and pursuit
of profit at any cost is [driving the planet to the **brink of the
abyss**]{.underline}.

[[Does]{.underline}]{.mark} "green capitalism"---the strategy of
**[[reducing environment]{.mark}al impact]{.underline}**
[while]{.underline} **[[maintain]{.mark}ing]{.underline}** dominant
**[economic [institutions]{.mark}]{.underline}**[---[offer
a]{.underline}]{.mark} **[[solution]{.underline}]{.mark}**? [[The
**implausibility** of]{.mark} such a]{.underline} **[[Policy
Reform]{.mark} scenario]{.underline}** [[is seen]{.mark} most vividly
[in the failure of]{.mark} a quarter-century of international
**[conferences]{.mark}**]{.underline} [[to]{.underline}]{.mark}
effectively [[address]{.mark} climate]{.underline}
**[[change]{.underline}]{.mark}**.9 [The]{.underline} political [[forces
committed to the **capitalist**]{.mark} "market
**[economy]{.mark}**]{.underline}" [that have created the problem
**[cannot be the]{.mark} source of the [solution]{.mark}**]{.underline}.

For example, at the 2015 Paris climate conference, many countries
resolved to make serious efforts to keep average global temperature
increases below 2o C (ideally, they agreed, below 1.5o C).
Correspondingly, they volunteered to implement measures to reduce their
greenhouse gas emissions. However, they put no enforcement mechanisms in
place nor any consequences for noncompliance, hence no guarantee that
any country will keep its word. The US, the world's second-highest
emitter of carbon emissions, is now run by a climate denier who pulled
the US out of the agreement. Even if all countries did meet their
commitments, the global temperature would rise by 3o C or more, with
great risk of dire, irreversible climate change.10

Ultimately, [the fatal flaw of **green capitalism**]{.underline} [lies
in the conflict between the micro-**rationality**]{.underline} of [the
capitalist **market**]{.underline}, with its [short-sighted calculation
of **profit** and **loss**,]{.underline} [and the macro-rationality of
**collective action** for]{.underline} the **[common
good]{.underline}**. The blind [logic of the market]{.underline} resists
a **[rapid]{.underline}** energy **[transformation]{.underline}** [away
from fossil fuel dependence]{.underline} in [intrinsic
**contradiction**]{.underline} of **[ecological
rationality]{.underline}**. [[The point is not to indict]{.mark}
"**[bad]{.mark}**" ecocidal [capitalists, as opposed to]{.mark}
"**good**]{.underline}" **[[green capitalists]{.underline}]{.mark}**;
[[the fault lies in a **system**]{.mark} rooted in **ruthless
competition**]{.underline} and a race for short-term profit that
destroys nature's balance. The environmental challenge---to build an
alternative system that reflects the common good in its institutional
DNA---becomes inextricably linked to the socialist challenge.

While the alternatives considered in this book have positive qualities,
they all have shortcomings. My own proposal, outlined later, is that
political and economic policy should move in the direction of regulated
market socialism. I suggest [[a **state led**]{.underline}]{.mark}
hybrid [system [of **public**]{.mark}]{.underline} and private
**[[ownership]{.underline}]{.mark}**, combining the [advantages of
**economic planning**]{.underline} at the macro level with market

[well-being]{.mark}** [through]{.mark} the **promotion of [full

Regulated market socialism

Regulated market socialism delivers a minimalist answer to the problem
of the transition to socialism. Proposals for regulated market socialism
entail the elimination of excessive unearned personal wealth.
Twentiethcentury advocates of public ownership, such as Oskar Lange,
feared that nationalisation, in depriving some citizen of their private
wealth, would fuel public discord, and he predicted consequences of
'financial panic and economic collapse'.13 The [**[October
Revolution]{.mark} in Russia** [led to civil war]{.mark}]{.underline}
and protracted internal civil conflict and repression, which have
blighted the socialist cause. These adverse consequences have to be
avoided and **[[need not occur]{.underline}]{.mark}**. A [**major
objective** of [policies in]{.mark} the [transitional period]{.mark} is
to [prevent]{.mark} civil war]{.underline}. [**Traditional
[revolution]{.mark}** in the sense of **violent [state capture]{.mark}**
[is **ruled out**]{.mark}]{.underline}. Unlike in the former communist
systems and contemporary China, [[the]{.mark} **competitive [electoral
system]{.mark}** [would not be dismantled]{.mark}]{.underline}; [[civil
society would **remain pluralistic**]{.underline}]{.mark}. Forms of
electoral competition would continue giving citizens the opportunity to
modify, even reverse, the changes. As electoral democracy is not
threatened, [[opposition to]{.mark} the **installation of a
['totalitarianism']{.mark} society** [would be
disarmed]{.mark}]{.underline}. Practices of democratic participation
could be widened to include employee participation in economic
enterprises. Such proposals have the great advantage that a [transition
could take effect within the **existing [political
framework]{.mark}**]{.underline}, it would [[preserve **economic and
political stability**]{.mark} and have **immediate positive
effects**]{.underline}.

To these proposals, the [[pessimists]{.mark} will [answer]{.mark}: yes,
but [individuals are motivated by]{.mark} infinite aspirations and
[desires]{.mark}]{.underline} which must be controlled, analyzed,
suppressed and even repressed if necessary. Democracy could then be
subject to certain restrictions. [[Yet ecosocialism is]{.mark} based on
a [reasonable]{.mark} assumption]{.underline}, previously advanced by
Marx: [the [predominance of "being" over "having]{.mark}" in a
non-capitalist society]{.underline}, that is to say the [[primacy of
**free time** over]{.mark} the [desire to own]{.mark} countless
[objects]{.mark}: **personal achievement** through **real
activities**]{.underline}, cultural, sports, recreational, scientific,
erotic, artistic and political.

[The fetishism of the commodity encourages **compulsive

the capitalist system. [[There is no evidence]{.mark} that [this

Foreign Policy Will Look Like With a Socialist in the White House.\"
https://foreignpolicy.com/2020/01/17/socialist-us-foreign-policy-democratic-socialism/

[[There is **no**]{.mark} **ironclad [rule]{.mark}** [that says a **left
foreign policy** must reduce]{.mark} the size of [the U.S.
**military**]{.mark} **footprint**]{.underline}. One could imagine a
scenario in which [[U.S. forces]{.underline}]{.mark} went to war to
[[protect the]{.mark} **global [environment]{.mark}** [from **climate
chauvinists**, **slave states**, or]{.mark} other [**enemies** of a
**social democratic global order**]{.mark}]{.underline}. But a genuinely
left foreign policy would be a failure if it did not focus on the vast
extent of U.S. economic power, which is constantly at work in the
background of international politics. [Social democrats would properly
seek to place **economic power** at the **center** of foreign
policy]{.underline}.

That's why a priority of a left foreign policy would be to revolutionize
military industrial policy. Comprising well over half of the \$420
billion global arms industry, the U.S. armament sector considerably
outstrips more visible industries such as car manufacturing and is four
times the national education budget. The problem is not simply that this
industry looks for customers around the world like any other. Nor is it
the revolving doors between the military and weapons and security
companies. The issue is that the arms industry has become a way for the
ultrawealthy to siphon taxpayer dollars under the cover of the national
interest. Its leading firms donate directly to avowedly pro-war
candidates, especially those who sit on the Senate Armed Services
Committee, with the aim of not only blocking attempts to stop
U.S.-backed wars, such as support of the Saudi war on Yemen, but to
create the illusion that without U.S. armed forces global capitalism
itself would collapse.

[[There is **no reason** why a **left admin**]{.mark}istration [should
**not** demand the **best possible military technology**]{.mark} in the
**world**, but it should impose **stringent requirements** on the
industrial sector]{.underline} to integrate American defense into
American society. [The government should]{.underline} more **[closely
regulate]{.underline}** the management of the [arms
companies]{.underline} to which it awards public contracts, including
the extent to which workers have a financial and managerial stake in
their companies. The government should stop military materiel from being
used in domestic policing. (It's not uncommon for surplus tanks to end
up on the streets of places like Ferguson, Missouri.) Trying to
completely nationalize a company like Lockheed Martin would be a very
costly engagement for a social democratic administration in the short
term. In the longer term, however, it would be worth pursuing demands
for partial worker ownership of such corporations.

[[Here is a]{.mark} **brief [response]{.mark}** [to]{.mark} **Noah
[Smith\'s]{.mark}** recent [article on
**degrowth**]{.mark}]{.underline}. Most of the claims have already been
dealt with in the published literature, and others I agree with, so
there\'s not much interesting to say. But a few thoughts:

[[Smith relies]{.mark} **heavily** [on **McAfee\'s claims**
about]{.mark} the US **[\"decoupling\"]{.mark} GDP from resource
use**]{.underline}. [[Unfortunately]{.mark} the
[data]{.mark}]{.underline} he uses [[does not account for]{.mark}
resources involved in **[offshored production]{.mark}**]{.underline}.
[[This is a **significant**]{.mark} **empirical
[error]{.mark}**]{.underline} that I have addressed here:
https://t.co/ouF2eiyy01

[When we account for this]{.underline}, as the Material Footprint
indicator does, [the **US economy** is not **absolutely decoupling** GDP
from resource use]{.underline} (not just the world as a whole). [So too
with other rich economies]{.underline}. [[This]{.mark} point [is **well
established**]{.mark} in the **literature**]{.underline}:
https://t.co/wOl3lRWmD4

[This fact has been [**reaffirmed** by]{.mark} several **[recent

https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1748-9326/ab842a I have
elaborated on this argument further here:

[[Of course]{.underline}]{.mark}, Smith is right that [**[past]{.mark}
trends** are **[no guarantee]{.mark}** of **[future]{.mark}
trends**]{.underline}. [Maybe strong [policy could]{.mark} help **[break

Is [[Material Footprint]{.underline}]{.mark} the right
[indicator]{.underline} to use? Well, it\'s [a [strong proxy for
environmental]{.mark} [pressures]{.mark}]{.underline} ([explaining more
than 90%]{.underline} of it), so it\'s useful in that sense. But yes we
should also pay attention to different material categories.

Next up, emissions. [Yes **rich nations** are decoupling **GDP** from
**emissions**]{.underline} (renewable energy!). The problem is [it seems
[unlikely]{.mark} that [**HICs** can decarbonize **fast enough** to stay

[The principle of "leaving no one behind" necessitates the
**equitable**]{.underline} and uniform [implementation of]{.underline}
United Nations (UN) [**[sustainable development goals]{.mark}**
(**[SDGs]{.mark}**).]{.underline} Globally, socioeconomic resources are
predominantly allocated following the Pareto principle, where a minority
of high-income economies defined by World Bank Country and Lending
Groups1 control a substantial portion of the global wealth2. Efforts to
achieve SDGs should therefore prioritize addressing this imbalance,
guided by Liebig's law of the minimum. However, [ameliorating the
disparities in the **pursuit of SDGs**]{.underline} [[presents a
**considerable**]{.mark} **[challenge]{.mark}**]{.underline},
[especially [in **polar regions**]{.mark}]{.underline}, [including the
**Arctic**, the]{.underline} Antarctic, and the Third Pole (the Tibetan
Plateau and surrounding high mountain areas)3,4,5. Polar regions,
covering approximately 20.1% (or \~300

106 km2) of the global land area and 16.7% (or \~600

106 km2) of the ocean area3, are recognized as outposts (or early
warning systems) of climate change6,7.

Meanwhile, [[these regions serve as **biodiversity reservoirs**]{.mark},
[**water towers**, and]{.mark} [**storage** of **climate driving
gases**]{.mark}]{.underline}[8]{.mark}. [[They]{.underline}]{.mark} also
[provide a **diverse array** of ecosystem **services** that [are
**critical** for **global sustainable
development**]{.mark}]{.underline}. For example, the **[[fisheries in
the Arctic]{.underline}]{.mark}** and Antarctic [[contribute to
achieving **zero hunger**]{.underline}]{.mark} (SDG2). [The sustainable
management of these fisheries is of great values to conserving and
sustainably [using **global marine resources**]{.mark}]{.underline}
(SDG14)9. The Third Pole, with its total annual runoff exceeding 650 109
m3, is vital for guaranteeing water security for downstream residents
(SDG6)10. [Furthermore, the protection and maintenance of high mountain
**[vegetation]{.mark}** [and **biodiversity** are]{.mark}
**[fundamental]{.mark}** [for the **global protection**]{.mark} [and
**restoration** of **terrestrial ecosystems**]{.mark}]{.underline}
(SDG15).

[However, sustainable development in polar regions has been largely
overlooked in the formulation of global SDGs]{.underline}11. A mere
0.75% of the SDG-focused studies during 2015--2022 have considered polar
regions, as indicated in our literature reviews (Supplementary Table 1).
Furthermore, the marginalization of polar regions is also reflected in
other international reports, such as the United Nations Environment
Programme (UNEP) Global Environment Outlook (GEO) series12. Beginning
with GEO-213, polar regions have often been treated as side issues,
highlighting their consistent underrepresentation in global
environmental governance systems. In addition, there are currently no
specific SDG indicators for the Arctic or Antarctic regions. Although
mountain areas have garnered more attention than their polar
counterparts, only 3 out of the 248 SDG indicators are associated with
mountain regions14. [[This neglect of SDGs]{.mark} [in polar
regions]{.mark} is mainly [due to the misapprehension]{.mark} [that
sustainable development]{.mark} in [these areas is economically marginal
and would]{.mark} [**contribute minimally** to globa]{.mark}l **SDG
[efforts]{.mark}**]{.underline}, [a belief stemming from their

What becomes abundantly clear throughout the research is that [an
**[icebreaker]{.mark}** [is required for nearly **all**]{.mark} **of the
[activities]{.mark}** **occurring** or soon to **occur [in the
Arctic]{.mark}.**]{.underline} [[Whether]{.mark} it is search and

**community supply** and **[development]{.mark}**]{.underline},

drills, border security, communication, [[environmental **regulation

**[[asset]{.underline}]{.mark}**, if you will, a capital ship that's
going to be doing frontline government missions projecting U.S.
sovereignty" (O'Rourke, 2015, p.24), and are indispensable to the goals
set forth by all levels of stakeholders on the US Arctic.This improves
US security, but utilizing a security model for a new era, "in which
international, national, and human security are intertwined parts of any
comprehensive approach to security in the future" (Swain, 2013, p.18).
The USA's neighbors in the Arctic agree -- policing and security assets
must be discussed in the Arctic Council if it is to stay the most
relevant forum for years to come (Thordardottir, 2011).

The characteristics of the ocean, the priorities of nations, states, and
locals all intertwine with different interests, concerns and
capabilities. The most visible plan of action, the strategy of the
United States Arctic Council Chairmanship, is broad and general. While
its heart may be in the right place, addressing the specifics of
executing its goals, as well as satisfying the demands of all relevant
stakeholders, remains elusive without the physical assets to do so. The
question posed in the beginning of this thesis, 'Can the USA effectively
lead the Arctic Council, considering its current state of development in
the Alaskan Arctic?' can now be answered. It cannot lead effectively
without leading by example. [[To]{.mark} [lead]{.mark} [the]{.mark}
highest level international [**Arctic organization**, it must invest in
its own]{.mark} [Arctic area]{.mark}, [by building the icebreakers that

take **[place]{.mark}**]{.underline}. [[Without them, **sustainable
development** will **give way** to **unsupervised commercial chaos**,
and the **communities** which **depend on the Arctic for** **survival

the Arctic Council will be viewed as two years of empty rhetoric and a
missed opportunity to take a step in the right direction as the region
begins to give way to global pressures.

In sum: [[Socialism's purpose is assuring everyone]{.mark} the

[we]{.underline} should [all want that]{.underline}, we should all be
socialists. [The most [dependable means for delivering those]{.mark}

https://www.economicforces.xyz/p/i-read-the-degrowth-paper-so-you

[[Markets]{.underline}]{.mark}---[through prices]{.underline}---[have a
way to tell users if something is wasteful]{.underline}. For households,
they have to spend the money and determine if the product is worth the
price. For businesses, [the profit and loss system helps provide the
information]{.underline}. If a company is making a loss, that is a sign
the company is turning more valuable inputs into less valuable output.
You get rewarded for creating value (turning less valuable inputs into
more valuable output) with profits.

[The profit and loss system isn't perfect]{.underline}. There are
externalities which do not factor into profit or loss but create or
destroy value for other people. Externalities are crucial in this
discussion, because degrowth is concerned with damage to the
environment, which tends to not get priced.

[Even though the price system is imperfect]{.underline}, [it **still can
[help us address environmental issues]{.mark}** and calculate
environmental usage]{.underline}. [Does the product use gasoline?
Lumber? Does it take land? All of **that will show up in
prices**]{.underline}. [With externalities, [prices]{.mark} are not
perfect conveyors of value but **they [give]{.mark} SOME
[information]{.mark}**]{.underline}. [If there are two identical
producers, except one tends to use more gasoline in their production,
[the **less efficient company**]{.mark} [will]{.mark} make smaller
profits and tend to [be **driven out of the
market**]{.mark}.]{.underline} [The **[market will select for firms that
are]{.mark} relatively good at [using fewer resources]{.mark}**. Prices
and profit and loss do the work, if imperfectly.]{.underline}

[[Dismissing prices]{.mark} **simply [hides tradeoffs; it does not avoid
them]{.mark}**]{.underline}. [Instead of using prices to think about
costs and benefits of different goods, degrowthers have to resort to
things like adding the weight of biomass and fossil fuels as a measure
of waste. Do we really want to try a mechanism that **[rewards firms
for]{.mark} [using fewer tons]{.mark} of "resources" [without regard
to]{.mark} [social value]{.mark}** of those resources?]{.underline} The
authors do not suggest that, but [it's the implicit idea if you say this
is a meaningful metric of waste.]{.underline}

Instead, [[prices allow people to **make tradeoffs in a coherent
manner**]{.mark}. They can decide whether the short time life of clothes
is worth the monetary savings]{.underline}.

To be fair, current institutional contours provide no end of fodder for
critique. We don't have prices where we should. We should find more ways
to price externalities when possible. Tell me what is not properly
priced and let's talk about how to price it.

[Prices and markets remain deeply imperfect but **[radical
overhaul]{.mark}** [demands]{.mark} **properly [weighing social costs
against alternatives]{.mark} foregone**]{.underline}. A [**degree of
humility is warranted** before scrapping growth in favor of even

[[It would be easy to conclude]{.mark} that economics]{.underline}---
**[[capitalism]{.underline}]{.mark}**--- [is [the
problem]{.mark}]{.underline}. Economics is indeed at the core of the
problem. Or [rather]{.underline}: [**misguided** market forces
are.]{.underline}

[One seeming solution then would be to simply [change our
ways]{.mark}]{.underline}. If only we slowed down, [went back to the
land]{.underline}, and [generally did more with less]{.underline},
climate change would be a thing of the past. **[Not
quite]{.underline}**. [Most would like to spend more time with our
families frolicking in fields of green and less time tied to our
desks]{.underline}. But **[that's [clearly not
enough]{.mark}]{.underline}**. [The math on voluntary action simply
doesn't add up.]{.underline} And [the calculus of changing capitalism as
we know it]{.underline}--- however desirable that may be as an
independent goal--- **[is daunting]{.underline}**, [to say the
least]{.underline}. [[It]{.mark} also **[confuses the
issue]{.mark}**]{.underline}.

[Some]{.underline}, like activist author Naomi Klein, [call for "taxing
the rich and filthy." That's a nice turn of phrase.]{.underline} One
might agree that we probably should be taxing the rich more. But [that's
a different problem entirely. First and foremost, we ought to be
**taxing the filthy**]{.underline}. [[Instead of "**sticking it to the
man**]{.mark}," the **[point is to]{.mark} [stick it to
carbon]{.mark}**.]{.underline}

[Far from posing a fundamental problem to capitalism]{.underline},
[[it's capitalism]{.mark} with all its **[innovative and entrepreneurial
powers]{.mark}** that is [**our only hope** of steering clear of]{.mark}
the looming [climate shock]{.mark}]{.underline}. [That's not a call for
letting markets run free]{.underline}. [[Laissez-
faire]{.underline}]{.mark} may sound good with the right French
accent--- in theory. But it [**[can't work]{.mark}** in a situation
[where **prices don't reflect**]{.mark} **the [true costs]{.mark}** of
our actions.]{.underline} Unbridled human drive--- erroneously bridled
drive, really--- is what has gotten us into this current predicament.
[Properly [channeled]{.mark} human drive and [ingenuity]{.mark}, [guided
by]{.mark} a high enough **[price on carbon]{.mark}** to reflect its
true cost to society, is our **[best hope]{.mark} for getting us
out**]{.underline}.

[[**Only then** can we **afford**]{.mark} **the [luxury]{.mark}** [of

Sustainability: A Tale of Two Halves.

"[What about '**degrowth'**]{.underline} -- shrinking the economy --
instead? This argument hinges on the fact that, historically, economic
growth has been linked with more resource-intensive lifestyles. As we
got richer, we used more energy from fossil fuels, had a higher carbon
footprint, used more land and ate more meat. And [it's true that in a
world without **technological change**]{.underline}, [we'll be stuck
with fossil fuel power, petrol cars and inefficient homes]{.underline}.
But as the chapters that follow will show, [[new technologies]{.mark}
are [allowing us to **decouple**]{.mark} **a good**]{.underline}
[and]{.underline} [**[comfortable life]{.underline}** [from an
environmentally destructive one]{.underline}]{.mark}. This is what makes
it possible for us to be the first generation. [In rich countries
**carbon** [emissions]{.mark},]{.underline} **[[energy
use]{.mark},]{.underline}** deforestation, fertiliser use,
**[[overfishing]{.underline}]{.mark}**, **[[plastic
pollution]{.underline}]{.mark}**, air pollution [[and]{.underline}
[**water** pollution are all
**falling**]{.underline}]{.mark}[,]{.underline} while these countries
continue to get richer.vii [The [idea]{.mark} that these [countries
were]{.mark}]{.underline} [**[more sustainable]{.underline}**
[when]{.underline}]{.mark} [they were [poorer **is**]{.mark} **simply
[not true]{.mark}**]{.underline}. There is another important reason why
degrowth will not build a sustainable future. Degrowth argues that we
can redistribute the world's wealth from the rich to the poor, giving
everyone a good and high standard of living with the resources already
at our disposal. But the maths doesn't check out.20 [The world **is far
too poor**]{.underline} [to give everyone a high standard of
living]{.underline} today **[through redistribution
alone.]{.underline}** We can see this with a quick thought experiment.
Let's imagine that every country in the world ends up like Denmark.
Almost all its population lives above the \$30 poverty line that most
rich countries adopt, and it is one of the most equal countries in the
world.21 That's what I want: everyone in the world to live a
comfortable, poverty-free life, and in a society with low levels of
inequality. In this scenario, we're going to do a global redistribution:
all the countries that are richer than Denmark are brought down to its
average level of income, and all the countries that are poorer -- which
is 85% of the global population -- are brought up to it. There are no
inequalities between countries, and inequalities within countries are
"also shrunk massively. Would it be possible to achieve this by just
redistributing the world's money? No: [the global economy would have to
be at least **five times bigger**]{.underline} [than it is
today.]{.underline} That's right: to lift everyone "out of poverty, with
a level of equality like Denmark, [the global economy would need
to]{.underline} **[increase five-fold]{.underline}**. If everyone in the
world lived on \$30 per day with zero inequality (so the richest and
poorest both get \$30), the global economy would need to more than
double. [A world without economic growth would remain a **very poor
one**]{.underline}. I'm agnostic about growth in rich countries, but the
data is clear that we need strong economic growth globally to end
poverty, even with lots of redistribution. [Historically, countries have
become **rich** from fossil fuels and other resources]{.underline}.
[That means many people now assume that growth equals
'**bad'**.]{.underline} [But there is no reason **for it to stay** that
way]{.underline}. [If a country]{.underline}, or an individual for that
matter, [can lead the way in providing]{.underline} a
**[cheap]{.underline}**, **[low-carbon energy]{.underline}** [source
that could power the world, I would be more]{.underline} than
**[happy]{.underline}** for them [to get rich from it]{.underline}. And
they could. [There is a massive '**solutions vacuum'**]{.underline} [for
our environmental problems]{.underline}. [The [early movers]{.mark} in
this space can [build a]{.mark}]{.underline} [**[prosperous
economy]{.underline}** [while **building
solutions**]{.underline}]{.mark} [to our problems]{.underline} at the
same time. [Countries can '**grow'**]{.underline} [by leading the way
on]{.underline} '**[good' technologies]{.underline}**, not just
exploiting polluting ones. This leads to another argument, which is that
having money gives us options. [The solutions and [technologies]{.mark}
we need to]{.underline} **[fix]{.underline}** [our environmental
problems [have become]{.mark}]{.underline}
[**[viable]{.underline}**]{.mark} [only in the last few
decade]{.underline}s. Some, such as **[solar energy]{.underline}**
[and]{.underline} **[electric vehicles]{.underline}**, [only in the last
few years]{.underline}. Before then, these technologies did not exist or
were far too expensive. [They've become competitive through]{.underline}
[**years of investment** and]{.underline} **[development]{.underline}**
-- [and that has needed **extra cash**]{.underline} from governments and
entrepreneurs. [For hundreds of thousands of years, burning wood was the
**only source** of '**controllable'** heat and light that our ancestors
had.]{.underline} Then, [a few centuries ago, our ancestors]{.underline}
[**acquired** a couple more]{.underline} -- albeit
[destructive]{.underline} -- [options]{.underline}: whale oil and coal.
But we've only had real choice in the last few years. [[Economic growth
is not **incompatible**]{.underline} [with]{.underline}]{.mark}
[reducing our [environmental impact]{.mark}]{.underline}. In this book
I'll show that [[we can]{.mark} **reduce our environmental
impact**]{.underline} [and]{.underline} **[[reverse our past
damage]{.underline}]{.mark}** while becoming better off. The big
question here is whether we can decouple these impacts fast enough. The
answer to that depends on what actions we take today.

expressed in the age of sail that when the country was depleted of
oak,]{.underline} the fundamental wood [used in
shipbuilding]{.underline} and masts at the time, [the country would
become defenseless at sea. Clearly, this did not happen]{.underline};
[eventually iron replaced the need for wood]{.underline}, and in the
meantime, sufficient supplies came through trade with Scandinavia, the
Baltics, and North America. [For goods that cannot be
replaced]{.underline}, [prices generate **strong
incentives**]{.underline} [to become better at **extracting** and
**recycling** them]{.underline}.38 [Think of **copper**, which has good
properties as an electrical conductor. As electrification was in full
swing in the early twentieth century in the United States, geologist and
copper-mining expert Ira Joralemon warned that "the age of electricity
and of copper will be short]{.underline}. At the intense rate of
production that must come, [the copper supply of the world will last
hardly a score of years]{.underline}.... [Our civilization based on
electrical power will dwindle and die]{.underline}." One century later,
we can see that [this prediction **did not age well**]{.underline}.

[[It is **not**]{.mark} **even [a necessity]{.mark}** [that]{.mark} the

material use falls, for example, the idea of the circular economy, in
which society is organized to reuse or recycle extensively, and rely
less on new material extraction.]{.underline} [[The **digital
revolution** has]{.mark} also [caused the economy to be]{.mark} more and
more "**[dematerialized]{.mark}**]{.underline}" [in production and
consumption, as it becomes more based on **intangible
goods**]{.underline}.39 This is what economist Danny Quah refers to as
the "weightless economy." [Another push toward more efficient use of
reduced material inputs is known as [the "**sharing economy**]{.mark},"
as seen recently in urban settings with cars, mopeds, home rentals, and
coworking space]{.underline}s. Under this model, [people shift from

managed to increase crop production by 35 percent]{.underline} between
1982 and 2015, [while reducing the use of fertilizers and returning to

productivity enhancements and dematerialization has allowed many

[**innovation** will not come to an end because we run out of **material
inputs**]{.mark}]{.underline}. [While in **theory**,]{.underline} [and
strictly speaking of physical inputs, it is **conceivable** that a
finite planet could be depleted of all materials **at
once**]{.underline}, **[as a practical reality this is not a
concern]{.underline}**. [Assuming that point were ever reached, it would
be **in a future so distant that**, by then, our material sources would
**probably not be confined to this planet.**]{.underline}

Transnationalization at the WZB Berlin Social Science Center, PhD in
economics from the University of Paderborn. *Handbook of Research on
Economic Freedom*. Edward Elgar Publishing. 360-363.

First, economic freedom is associated with the freedom to
**[[trade]{.underline}]{.mark}** internationally as well as the
promotion of economic exchange within a country (e.g., by removing
regulations that would complicate internal trade and exchange).
Consequently, economic freedom [[creates]{.underline}]{.mark} economic
**[[interdependencies]{.underline}]{.mark}** between people and regions
(i.e., domestically) as well as between countries (i.e.,
internationally). These interdependencies, in turn, ought [[to
**disincentivize conflict**]{.underline}]{.mark}. For instance, in a
world of economic interdependencies, [economic bonds could be
**destroyed** in a war, making peace]{.underline} and war [a matter of
**cost-benefit calculus**]{.underline}, with the destroyed bonds
constituting a high cost for any expected utility-maximizing government
(Schneider 2010). In a similar vein, while economic freedom may allow
for the substitution of trading partners, potentially reducing bilateral
interdependencies, thus making conflict more likely (Martin et al.
2008), **[[multilat]{.mark}eral]{.underline}** economic
[interdependencies]{.underline} within a globalized world (as
facilitated by economic freedom) may [[lead]{.underline}]{.mark}
economically invested [[**third parties** to show]{.underline}]{.mark}
their [[disapproval of]{.underline}]{.mark} bilateral
[[conflict]{.underline}]{.mark} by sending trade-based signals of
resolve (Kinne 2014). This holds not only for interstate war but also
for internal war, which some trading partners may aim to stop through,
for example, interventions (Bussmann and Schneider 2007; Powell and
Chacha 2016).

Second, [economic [freedom is]{.mark}]{.underline} also [[linked
to]{.underline}]{.mark} low levels of taxation and [[small
government]{.underline}]{.mark} (e.g., measured as government
expenditure as a share of total GDP). [[If]{.underline}]{.mark}
potential [[participants]{.underline}]{.mark} of conflict [are
motivated]{.underline} by a desire [to **[capture rents]{.mark}**, a
[small]{.mark}er [government constitutes a **smaller
prize**]{.mark}]{.underline} that would have to be compared with the
payoff from non-violence. Consequently, for example, as shown in Kirk's
(1983) model, [smaller governments]{.underline} (as a consequence of
economic freedom) are expected to [see **less conflict**]{.underline}
compared with larger governments (where the prize of conflict is
comparatively larger).

Third, economic freedom may be conducive to economic growth and
**[[development]{.underline}]{.mark}**, e.g., as higher levels of
economic freedom [[coincide with]{.mark} stronger [property
rights]{.mark}]{.underline}; stronger [[property
rights]{.underline}]{.mark}, in turn, [[incentivize
innovation]{.underline}]{.mark} and thus, ultimately, productivity gains
and economic development (see de Haan and Sturm 2024 in this volume).
Similarly, Vadlamannati and de Soysa (2014) argue that sound legal
institutions that safeguard [profits [create incentives for]{.mark}
investment into]{.underline} (**[[civilian]{.underline}]{.mark}**)
[[production]{.mark}, making this]{.underline} type of investment
[[**more attractive** than]{.underline}]{.mark} investment into
[[war]{.mark}fare]{.underline}. As a final example, [economic freedom
may]{.underline} help to [channel]{.underline} the struggle caused by
incompatible (economic) goals into a [competition]{.underline} for [but
not]{.underline} a [conflict]{.underline} over mobile financial,
physical or human capital; here, economic exchange acts as a signaling
and communication device (O'Neal and Russett 1999; Gartzke et al. 2001).
Mobile capital, in turn, is an important input for economic growth and
development (e.g., Grossman and Helpman 1993). For instance, Gartzke
(2005, p. 32) di\\scusses how economic freedom interacts with
international factor mobility:

> Economic freedom means you can take \[your wealth\] with you. When
> conditions get bad domestically, capital can leave the country,
> creating an economic, and thus political, drain on the society.
> Obviously, governments do not want money to leave. To the degree that
> sovereigns are unable to stop the flight of capital, however, they
> must create conditions that favor the voluntary retention of money
> within their borders.

By fostering **[economic [success]{.mark}]{.underline}**, higher levels
of economic freedom [[could]{.underline}]{.mark} thus [[make]{.mark} it
[less]{.mark} likely]{.underline} that potentially violent [actors will
have]{.underline} to engage in conflict to satisfy their
**[[greed]{.underline}]{.mark}** for resources or accommodate their
economic grievances, [given]{.underline} that [more resources will be
available]{.underline} to them [through]{.underline} the marketplace in
the process of economic **[development]{.underline}**. The basic
underlying assumption here is that the probability of an internal and
international war to occur is a decreasing function of per capita income
(e.g., Collier and Hoeffler 1998; Schneider 2010).

Fourth, [[economic freedom]{.mark} may be [linked
to]{.mark}]{.underline} other **[[institution]{.underline}]{.mark}**al
outcome**[[s]{.underline}]{.mark}** that are [conducive to
non-violent]{.underline} conflict [resolution]{.underline}. For
instance, a sound [[**rule of law** is a crucial]{.mark} element
of]{.underline} sound [market]{.underline} institution[s]{.underline}.
At the same time, [a]{.underline}n impartial and [functioning
**judiciary**]{.underline} also [underpins democratic
development]{.underline} (e.g., Larkins 1996). Indeed, [economic
[freedom and democracy are]{.mark}]{.underline} usually **[[positively
related]{.underline}]{.mark}** (see Choutagunta and Gutmann 2024 in this
volume) and argued to give rise -- in combination -- to a (capitalist
and) democratic peace (Russett 1993; Rummel 1997). What is more,
[economically free countries are characterized by]{.underline} a wide
[[**dispersion of power** because of market]{.underline}]{.mark} and
political [[competition]{.underline}]{.mark}. For instance, [this may
[prevent]{.mark}]{.underline} (small) [[**elites** from
abusing]{.underline}]{.mark} their [[power]{.underline}]{.mark} to start
conflicts out of self-interest and at the expense of not only their
enemies but also domestic non-elites.

Fifth, [economic [freedom may]{.mark}]{.underline} also [[foster
**values**]{.underline}]{.mark} that are [conducive to
peace]{.underline}. Indeed, the idea of doux commerce (voiced by
Montesquieu and others) already emphasized the 'civilizing' potential of
economic exchange as such exchange is argued to produce gentleness,
honesty and understanding during the Enlightenment. In detail, [economic
freedom may [promote]{.mark} **social trust** and
**[tolerance]{.mark}**]{.underline} (e.g., Berggren and Jordahl 2006;
Berggren and Nilsson 2013). For instance, large and free markets (which
are likely outcomes of high levels of economic freedom) facilitate trust
in others [[because]{.underline}]{.mark} such trust makes it more likely
to engage in voluntary [**transactions** and]{.underline} build
long-lasting **[[business relations]{.underline}]{.mark}**, especially
when market participants do not know each other (e.g., Platteau 2000).
Trust, [tolerance]{.underline} and related values, in turn,
[[make]{.mark} it [less]{.mark} likely that [conflict]{.mark} breaks
out]{.underline}, e.g., because religious cleavages are less likely to
be influential (e.g., Weingast 1998).

In sum, conceptualizing violent conflict as a function of cost--benefit
considerations of potential conflict participants (e.g., states,
insurgent or terrorist groups) that respond rationally to (economic)
incentives, we can discuss how economic freedom may matter to the
emergence of conflict. More specifically, one could think of a
theoretical framework in which economic freedom (or specific aspects of
economic freedom) affects directly or indirectly (via certain mediators)
the incidence of peace or conflict. In addition, there may be moderating
factors that make the link between economic freedom and peace or
conflict more or less relevant; for instance, this may concern regional
and institutional bonds (e.g., the European Union considers itself
explicitly as a peace project; Birchfeld et al. 2017) or a shared
ethnicity or religion (e.g., Woodwell 2004).

Indeed, [[there are **various pathways**]{.underline}]{.mark} through
which higher levels of economic freedom are expected to reduce the
likelihood of different types of conflict, including, for example,
increased economic interdependencies, strong levels of economic
development as well as the development of sound, democratic, pro-peace
institutions and values. At the same time, we acknowledge that [[not
all]{.mark} types of conflict [are]{.mark}]{.underline} anticipated to
be affected by economic freedom (and its specific sub-categories) in
[[the same]{.underline}]{.mark} way. For instance, one may hypothesize
that the promotion of international trade through the dismantling of
trade barriers (which would indicate higher levels of economic freedom)
may be especially relevant to conflict between states. Similarly, [while
[the overall effect]{.mark}]{.underline} of economic freedom on conflict
[[is]{.underline}]{.mark} expected to be [[**favorable**, we **cannot**
identify a **single** mechanism]{.underline}]{.mark} (mediator)
[that]{.underline} alone [explains this]{.underline} relationship. In
other words, specific ingredients of economic freedom (while related to
non-violence in theory) may not be sufficient to guarantee a peaceful
outcome. For instance, again consider international trade and interstate
war. When threats are highly asymmetric, one's opponent may consider the
reluctance to endanger the benefits of prosperous economic ties as
weakness (Gartzke 2005). In this situation, even for positive-sum games
it has to be guaranteed that 'all possible participants must be
unwilling to play the game of chicken or, indeed, to use military force'
(Gartzke 2005, p. 32). Hence, the opportunity costs of foregoing one's
share in the mutual benefits from trade are -- alone -- insufficient to
guarantee peace.

EMPIRICAL EVIDENCE

Having discussed various mechanisms through which economic freedom may
influence violent conflict, in this section we discuss the empirical
evidence that relates (higher levels of) economic freedom to (reduced)
international conflict, i.e., conflict between states, as well as to
reduced internal conflict in the form of civil war and terrorism.

Economic Freedom and Interstate War

A first set of studies considers the effect of higher levels of economic
freedom on the emergence of violent conflict between two or more
nation-states. For instance, this type of conflict may take the form of
a militarized interstate dispute (i.e., the display of military force
short of war by one state explicitly directed towards another state) or
a conflict that involves a minimum level of battle deaths to qualify as
a full-blown war (Anderton and Carter 2011).

[A **number** of [empirical studies]{.mark} provide evidence [in favor
of]{.mark}]{.underline} a **[[capitalist peace]{.underline}]{.mark}**,
where sound economic institutions (i.e., high levels of economic
freedom) coincide with a reduced likelihood of militarized disputes and
warfare between nation-states (e.g., Gartzke et al. 2001, Mousseau et
al. 2003; Souva 2004; Mousseau 2005, 2009; Gartzke 2007; McDonald 2010).
For example, Gartzke (2007) [examines [a **global
sample**]{.mark}]{.underline} of countries [[between]{.mark}
**19[50]{.mark}** [and]{.mark} **19[92]{.mark}**[,
find]{.mark}ing]{.underline} that high levels of external [openness
discourage conflict]{.underline} between states.

Consistent with our theoretical discussion above, several [empirical
contributions highlight the role]{.underline} international [**trade**
plays]{.underline} in creating economic interdependencies and wealth
that disincentivizes interstate conflict (e.g., Hegre 2000; Gartzke and
Li 2003; Gelpi and Grieco 2008). International trade ought to be fueled
by high levels of economic freedom, e.g., by means of low tariffs and
low trade regulations. Other voices emphasize the role sound economic
institutions may play in the development of institutions and values that
promote equality, tolerance and respect for the rights of others (e.g.,
Mousseau 2009).

In sum, [**many** empirical studies suggest]{.underline} that there is a
**[[capitalist peace]{.underline}]{.mark}**, with countries that are
economically free being less likely to engage in conflict with other
countries. At the same time, this finding points to one important aspect
that is also the subject of academic debate. How does economic
liberalism (high levels of economic freedom) interact with political
liberalism (high levels of political freedom) and how do both variables
affect conflict (e.g., Schneider 2014)? In this contribution, we cannot
discuss at length the nuances of the literature on the capitalist peace
vis-à-vis the democratic peace. However, our reading of the capitalist
peace literature highlights two major points. First, sound economic
institutions appear to lead to less interstate conflict independent of
the effect of democracy (e.g., Gartzke et al. 2001; Mousseau et al.
2003). Second, it is possible that economic and political freedom
reinforce each other, with both also potentially sharing a beneficial
relationship with economic development, suggesting that rich,
[economically **and** politically liberal countries]{.underline} may
[see]{.underline} especially [low levels of]{.underline} international
[conflict]{.underline} (e.g., Mousseau 2005).

### AT: Impact\-\--AT: Complexity\-\--2AC/1AR

#### "Complexity is wrong." Capitalism is [sustainable and politically resilient]{.underline}. 

Daniel **Drezner 23**. Professor of international politics at the
Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy at Tufts University and a
nonresident senior fellow at the Chicago Council on Global Affairs, "Are
we headed toward a "polycrisis"? The buzzword of the moment, explained,
https://www.vox.com/23572710/polycrisis-davos-history-climate-russia-ukraine-inflation

[[The]{.mark} deeper [flaw in the polycrisis logic is the presumption
that one]{.mark} systemic crisis [will **inexorably** lead to negative
feedback]{.mark} effects that cause **other systems** to tip into
crisis.]{.underline}

If this assumption does not hold, then the whole logic of a single
polycrisis falls apart. To their credit, the Cascade Institute authors
acknowledge that this might not happen, but [they posit: "it seems more
likely that causal interactions between systemic crises will worsen,
rather than diminish, the overall emergent impacts."]{.underline}

[At first glance, this seems like a plausible assumption to make.
Remember, however, that the [proponents of]{.mark} a [polycrisis]{.mark}
also [assert]{.mark} that the [systems]{.mark} under stress [are
**highly complex**]{.mark}]{.underline}, leading to unpredictable
cause-and-effect relationships. If that is true, then
[[presuming]{.mark} that [one]{.mark} systemic [crisis would]{.mark}
automatically **[exacerbate stresses]{.mark}** in other systems [seems
premature]{.mark} at best and skewed at worst.]{.underline}

Indeed, [over the last year [there have]{.mark} been at least two
[examples of one]{.mark} systemic [crisis]{.mark} actually [**lessening
stress** on another system.]{.mark}]{.underline}

[[China's]{.underline}]{.mark} increasingly centralized autocracy
generated [a [**socioeconomic disaster** in the form of "zero
Covid]{.mark}]{.underline}["]{.mark} lockdowns. Xi Jinping kept that
policy in place long after it made any sense, accidentally throttling
China's economy. The timing of China's lockdown [was
fortuitous]{.underline}, however, [as stagnant Chinese demand [helped
prevent]{.mark} an **[inflation]{.mark}ary spiral** [from
getting]{.mark} any [worse.]{.mark} China's [exit]{.mark} from
zero-Covid [will]{.mark} likely also [be **countercyclical**,
jump-starting]{.mark} economic [growth]{.mark} at a time when other
regions tip into recession.]{.underline}

Another weird, fortuitous interaction has been the one between climate
change and [Russia's invasion of Ukraine]{.underline}. As Europe aided
Ukraine and resisted Russia's blatant, illegal actions, Russia
retaliated by cutting off energy exports. Many were concerned that
Russia's counter-sanctions would make this winter extremely hard and
expensive for Europe.

[[Climate change]{.mark} may have [provided a]{.mark} weird
[**geopolitical assist** to Europe]{.mark}, however. The warming climate
is likely connected to [Europe's]{.mark} extremely [temperate]{.mark}
fall and [winter]{.mark}. That, in turn, has [required **less
electricity** for heating, leaving]{.mark} the continent with plenty of
[energy reserves]{.mark} to last the winter.]{.underline} Russia's
ability to wreak havoc on the European economy has been circumscribed.

None of this is to say that systemic crises cannot exacerbate each
other. Just because a polycrisis has not happened yet does not mean one
is not on the horizon. Just as one buys insurance to guard against
low-probability, high-impact outcomes, policymakers and elements of
civil society need to guard against worst-case scenarios.

[As a term of art, however, "[polycrisis" distracts more than it
adds]{.mark}. It mostly seems like a device to make people care about
the **Really Bad Things** that climate change can do, without turning
people off by warning them yet again about the hazards of climate
change.]{.underline}

### AT: Alt\-\--Fails\-\--2AC

#### The alternative fails:

#### 1. Eco-socialism [can't solve warming]{.underline} and [causes war]{.underline}. 

Noah **Smith 19**. Bloomberg Opinion columnist, former assistant
professor of finance at Stony Brook University; 4-5-2019, Bloomberg,
\"Dumping Capitalism Won't Save the Planet,\" url:
https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2019-04-05/capitalism-is-more-likely-to-limit-climate-change-than-socialism

[The [climate threat is]{.mark} certainly [dire]{.mark}]{.underline},
and carbon taxes are unlikely to be enough to solve the problem. [[But
**eco-socialism** is]{.mark} probably [not]{.mark} going to be [an
**effective method** of addressing that threat.]{.mark} [Dismantling
an]{.mark} **entire [economic system]{.mark}** is never easy, and
probably [would touch off **armed conflict** and **major
upheaval**]{.mark}. In the scramble [to **win**]{.mark} **those
battles**, even the [socialists would]{.mark} almost certainly
**[abandon]{.mark} their [limitation]{.mark}** [on fossil-fuel
use]{.mark} --- either to **support military efforts**, or to keep the
population from **turning against them**. The precedent here is [the
**Soviet Union**]{.mark}, whose **multidecade** [effort to **reshape its
economy**]{.mark} **by force** amid confrontation with the West [led
to]{.mark} **profound [environmental degradation]{.mark}**.]{.underline}
The world\'s climate does not have several decades to spare.

[[Even without]{.mark} international [conflict]{.mark}, [there's little
guarantee]{.mark} that [moving away]{.mark} from capitalism [would
mitigate our impact]{.mark} on the environment. Since [socialist
leader]{.mark} Evo [Morales]{.mark}]{.underline} took power in Bolivia,
living standards have improved substantially for the average Bolivian,
which is great. But this has come at the **[[cost]{.mark} of [higher
emissions]{.mark}.]{.underline}** Meanwhile, the capitalist U.S managed
to decrease its per capita emissions a bit during this same period
(though since the U.S. is a rich country, its absolute level of
emissions is much higher).

In other words, in terms of economic growth and carbon emissions,
Bolivia looks similar to more capitalist developing countries. That
suggests that [[faced with a choice of **enriching their people** or
helping to **save the climate**]{.mark}, even **[socialist]{.mark}**
leader**[s]{.mark}** will often **[choose the former]{.mark}**. And that
same political calculus will probably hold in China and the
U.S.,]{.underline} the world's top carbon emitters --- [[leaders who
demand **draconian cuts**]{.mark} in living standards in pursuit of
environmental goals [will have **trouble staying in
power**]{.mark}]{.underline}.

There is [some
ambiguity](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/01/opinion/democrats-economic-policy.html) about
what voters mean when they choose such labels. But it seems safe to say
that [very few self-identified moderates intend to convey their support
for a revolution to establish [market
socialism](https://jacobin.com/2012/12/the-red-and-the-black),
but **not anarcho-communism**]{.underline}.

[In fact, the U.S. [electorate evinces]{.mark} a [**[strong bias toward

This fondness for stasis can't be written off as false consciousness
alone. America's political economy condemns a minority of its population
to unremunerative labor and/or penury. And our nation's [exceptionally
low life
expectancy](https://www.cfr.org/in-brief/us-life-expectancy-decline-why-arent-other-countries-suffering-same-problem) bespeaks
its profound social pathologies. Nevertheless, median real household
income in the U.S. is about as high as it has ever been, having
risen [from \$60,313 in 2012 to \$70,784 in
2021](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/MEHOINUSA672N). That leaves the
typical U.S. family more prosperous, at least by one plausible measure,
than[ roughly 90 percent of all
humans](https://www.washingtonpost.com/graphics/2018/business/global-income-calculator/) on
the planet today (and 99-plus percent of all who have ever existed).

The most damning feature of the present economic order may be the threat
it poses to Earth's climate and ecosystems. And climate change does
inspire public concern. But [in a 2022 [AP-NORC
poll,](https://apnorc.org/projects/inflation-and-gas-prices-top-the-list-of-the-publics-priorities/) voters
were **nearly twice as likely** to name "gas prices" as a top priority
as they were to name any subject related to climate or the
environment.]{.underline} This finding is consistent with the U.S.
public's broader political behavior. [Much of the country consistently
supports a party that is **actively hostile to
decarbonization**]{.underline}. In blue America, meanwhile, voters have
repeatedly [shot down carbon-tax
referenda](https://www.vox.com/energy-and-environment/2018/9/28/17899804/washington-1631-results-carbon-fee-green-new-deal),
while self-avowed climate hawks have prioritized their [antipathy for

and
"[upzoning" ](https://thevillagesun.com/fed-up-with-de-blasios-upzonings-65-groups-to-rally-at-city-hall)over
reducing carbon emissions.

In other words, the small minority of Americans who say decarbonization
is their *top* political goal won't reliably sacrifice their sentimental
attachment to a particular piece of nature in service of that cause. [It
is therefore unlikely that they are prepared to sacrifice all the
consolations of political stability --- and/or their very lives --- in
support of an ecosocialist insurrection.]{.underline}

[Given these realities, intraleft **debates over revolutionary versus
"reformist" theories** of change always strike me as **anachronistic
cosplay**,]{.underline} a bit like model U.N. for enthusiasts of the
late-19th-century Social Democratic Party of Germany. [Whether one is a
stalwart communist or a squishy social democrat (like myself), the
fundamental political task seems the same: to **narrow the gap between
utopia and reality through legislative reforms**]{.underline}. Ideally,
these reforms would also ease the path to more thoroughgoing progress
by, say, strengthening the labor movement or other left-wing
institutions. Extra-electoral political activity --- from community
organizing to civil disobedience to strikes --- may be integral to
securing such policy advances.

[The basic project, however, is to minimize needless suffering **within
the constraints imposed** by the existing constitutional
order]{.underline} and political economy while simultaneously chipping
away at those constraints. [[Any attempt to abruptly circumvent]{.mark}
those [strictures]{.mark} by challenging the government's monopoly on
violence [will **run into the buzz saw of the modern security state**
or]{.mark} the **[overwhelmingly counterrevolutionary
sentiments]{.mark}** of a prosperous and propertied American
middle-class.]{.underline}

But some on the left disagree. Or at least they argue as if they do.

#### Transitioning to eco-socialism would require an [impossible]{.underline} level of [global]{.underline} economic planning. 

Noah **Smith 21**. PhD in Economics from University of Michigan. "People
are realizing that degrowth is bad."
<https://noahpinion.substack.com/p/people-are-realizing-that-degrowth>.

So even if there is a sustainable growth path, we are not currently on
it. About this, degrowthers are right; a gentle, natural transition to
green growth is possible, but is an unaffordable luxury. But
**[[degrowthers' prescription is]{.mark} the [wrong]{.mark}
one.]{.underline}** [The reason, in a word, is
**politics**]{.underline}. [The kind of massive intention reordering of
global production and consumption that degrowthers fantasize about is
not just pragmatically impossible to implement]{.underline}, [it's the
kind of thing that essentially everyone in the world except for a few
very shouty people in Northern Europe and the occasional Twitter
activist is going to reject]{.underline}. To see why, let us turn to the
excellent articles/podcasts by Milanovic, Piper, and Klein. The
political argument against degrowth Milanovic actually has two excellent
posts on the topic of degrowth. In the first one, he lays out why
forcing developing countries to stay in poverty would be bad: Let us
suppose, for the sake of the argument, that we interpret "degrowth" as
the decision to fix global GDP at its current level...Then, unless we
change the distribution of income, [we are condemning to permanent
abject poverty some 15 percent of world population that currently earn
less than \$1.90 per day and some quarter of humankind who earn less
than \$2.50 per day...Keeping so many people in abject poverty so that
the rich can continue to enjoy their current standard of living is
obviously something that the proponents of degrowth would not condone.
Enforcing global degrowth would [require freezing]{.mark} [world
income]{.mark} at about \$17,000/year]{.underline}. That means that
[most people in the world would never even come close to current
rich-world living standards]{.underline} --- instead, [they would at
best only be able to reach the level currently enjoyed in China or
Botswana]{.underline}. Perhaps that's not such a horrible fate, but as
Milanovic notes, **[this would require [impoverishing]{.mark} most of
the [population of developed countries]{.mark}]{.underline}**. He
elaborates on this point in his new post, pulling no punches: \[In order
to avoid keeping most of the world in poverty, degrowthers must\]
introduce a different \[income\] distribution (B) where everybody who is
above the current mean world income (\$PPP 16 per day) is driven down to
this mean, and the poor countries and people are, at least for a while,
allowed to continue growing until they too achieve the level of \$PPP 16
per day. But the problem with that approach is that [one would have to
engage in a massive reduction of incomes for...practically all of the
Western population. Only 14% of the population in Western countries live
at the level of income less than the global
mean]{.underline}...**[[Degrowers]{.mark} thus [need to convince]{.mark}
[86% of]{.mark} the population living in [rich countries that their
incomes are too high]{.mark} and need to be
reduced]{.underline}**....[It is quite obvious that such a proposition
is a political suicide]{.underline}. Milanovic quite rightly waves away
degrowthers' protestations that GDP is not a good measure of human
welfare. GDP isn't perfect, he notes, but it's close enough where the
basic point stands. [Demanding that people in rich countries accept
absolutely catastrophic declines in their living standards is
a]{.underline} **[[political non-starter]{.underline}]{.mark}**. Klein,
on his podcast, tries to point this out as gently as possible: I think
that if the political demand of the \[degrowth\] movement becomes you
don't get to eat beef, you will set climate politics back so far, so
fast, it would be disastrous. Same thing with S.U.V.s. I don't like
S.U.V.s. I don't drive one. [But if you are telling people in rich
countries that the climate movement is for them not having the cars they
want to have, you are just going to lose]{.underline}. **[You are going
to lose fast]{.underline}**...This is where the politics of \[degrowth\]
for me fall apart... [I just don't see the argument for degrowth as
being anything but an extraordinarily slower way of approaching the
politics]{.underline}, [probably counterproductive compared to what
we're doing, which is]{.underline} **[I think you can make tremendous
strides on climate change by deploying renewable energy
technologies]{.underline}** and [giving people the opportunity to have a
more materially fulfilling life atop those technologies.]{.underline}
Milanovic is less gentle, calling [this "outright magical
thinking"]{.underline}. He is correct. [When you look at how much people
in America are willing to sacrifice in terms of their material
well-being in order to fight climate change, it's far less than what
Klein is talking about]{.underline}. And Klein is really softballing it
here --- [it's not just [giving up beef]{.mark} and [SUVs]{.mark}, it's
a [dramatic reduction in]{.mark} the size of [housing]{.mark} and the
amount of [food]{.mark} and the ease of [transportation]{.mark} and the
quality of [medical care]{.mark} that people in rich countries
enjoy.]{.underline} **[[It is]{.mark}, frankly, [not
happening.]{.mark}]{.underline}** But even this vastly understates the
political and practical difficulties of degrowth. Piper adds several key
points. First of all, she notes, because developed countries have been
decoupling resource use and growth for a while now, [curbing resource
use will actually cause a lot more restrictions on developing countries
than Milanovic's simple calculations would suggest]{.underline}: From a
climate change perspective, though, there's a problem \[with simply
reducing rich-world living standards\]. First, it means that
**[[degrowth would do nothing about]{.mark} the bulk of
[emissions]{.mark}, which are occurring in developing
countries.]{.underline}** This is an incredibly important point. For
example, [[China]{.mark} now [produces more]{.mark} CO2 emissions than
the U.S., the EU, and Japan combined]{.underline}: [(And no, this is not
because of outsourcing]{.underline}, as you can see by looking at the
trade-adjusted emissions numbers.) Another way of looking at this is
that [China's CO2 emissions per dollar of GDP are more than twice
America's, and about five times that of the EU]{.underline}. Any global
[degrowth]{.underline} plan that actually reduces resource use [is going
to entail more pain for China than its GDP numbers would
suggest]{.underline}, simply because China is at a more
resource-intensive stage of growth. [[Do you think China]{.mark} [will
accept]{.mark} a substantial diminution of its living standards, in
order to satisfy the environmental-economic [diktats of activists
in]{.mark} Northern [Europe]{.mark}?]{.underline} If so, **[you need to
rethink a great many things]{.underline}**. Anyway, Piper makes a second
crucially important point. So far we've been waving our hands and
talking about lowering rich-world GDP while raising GDP for poor
countries. In fact, economies don't work like that: Second, the global
economy is more interconnected than Hickel implies. When Covid-19 hit,
poor countries were devastated not just by the virus but by the
aftershocks of virus-induced slowdowns in consumption in rich countries.
There's some genuine appeal to the idea of an end to "consumerism," but
the pandemic offered a taste of how a sudden drop in rich-world
consumption would actually affect the developing world. Covid-19
dramatically curtailed Western imports and tourism for a time. [The
consequences in poor countries were devastating. Hunger rose, and child
mortality followed. Degrowth would thus require deep changes in the
entire way that the global economy works]{.underline}. Change happens,
but not like that; implementing [the kind of reallocation schemes that
[degrowthers]{.mark} throw around with abandon would [require **global
economic planning**]{.mark} that would put Gosplan to
shame]{.underline}. Klein points this out, again rather gently: Degrowth
is, as its advocates understand it, a act of global economic planning
really without equal anywhere in human history. It is an act of
extraordinary central planning. In other words, **[[it is abject
fantasy]{.underline}]{.mark}**. Taken together, **[these criticisms are
utterly devastating to the entire degrowth project]{.underline}**. In
its current form, [it will not advance beyond a media fad]{.underline}.
No matter how shrilly degrowthers quote apocalyptic projections, **[the
things they call for simply will not happen]{.underline}**. Luckily,
there is a better way to save the planet. And there is a better role for
the degrowth movement, if they're willing to rethink their approach and
become more fact-based, reasonable, and humble. A better direction for
Earth, a better direction for the degrowth movement [Degrowth is a
**non-starter**]{.underline}, and green growth won't happen fast enough
on its own. Thus, [the world has only one viable option]{.underline}:
**[Forced green growth.]{.underline}** Government policy will have to
accelerate the transition to green energy and dematerialized GDP faster
than these transitions would otherwise take place. For climate, this
will involve things like: A forced rapid transition to green electricity
Forced rapid electrification of most energy use The forced rapid
adoption of low-emissions heat for industrial processes Forced
restriction of deforestation ...and so on.

#### Eco-socialism [fails]{.underline}. It [can't gain]{.underline} popular support or solve the problems of capitalism. 

Peter **Somerville 22.** Peter Somerville is emeritus professor of
social policy at the University of Lincoln. The Ecologist. "Problems
with ecosocialism,"
<https://theecologist.org/2022/dec/05/problems-ecosocialism>

Ecosocialism is posited as a solution of appropriate ambition to prevent
breakdown. But what is ecosocialism? Is it ecological? And do we all
have to be socialist now? Ecosocialism seems to be increasingly regarded
as the most promising way forward or even as essential in order to avoid
a climate and ecological catastrophe. However, ecosocialism means
different things to different people, and it is not always clear what
meaning is intended. [This article critically reviews some of the
different meanings and concludes that]{.underline} [[**ecosocialism**
risks being too **narrowly 'socialist' to gain mass political
support**]{.mark} while at the same time tending to subordinate the
'ecological' to the 'social'.]{.underline} Classless What is
ecosocialism? Here are some of the answers that can be found in the
literature: Hans Baer, in his book Democratic eco-socialism as a real
utopia, describes ecosocialism as a global system that is \"highly
democratic rather than authoritarian, that ensures that all people have
access to basic resources, and that is at the same time environmentally
sustainable and recognises that we live on a fragile planet with limited
resources.\" David Klein, in System change not climate change, says:
\"Ecosocialism is democratic and calls for sustainable production based
on human needs rather than profit. Of critical importance, ecosocialism
proposes a steady state economy that does not require growth.\" In a
recent issue of the journal Capitalism Nature Socialism, Michael Albert
sees ecosocialism as a broad political approach that encompasses \"the
priority of use-value over exchange-value; collective ownership and
planning to shape and constrain markets; \'contraction and convergence\'
in consumption levels between the global north and south.\" In the same
issue, Salvatore Engel-Di Mauro states that ecosocialism has \"socialist
objectives and concerns over the state of ecosystems and environment\",
and 'socialist' means \"anyone striving for the realisation of
state-free, classless society.\" Profit In an edition of the same
journal in 2020, Samuel Day Fassbinder suggested that: \"A meaningful
definition \[of ecosocialism\] might center upon a sustainable,
democratic society with public control over the means of production.\"
Michael Löwy, in his book on Ecosocialism in 2015, conceptualised it as
\"an ecologically rational society founded on democratic control, social
equality, and the predominance of use value... This conception assumes
collective ownership of the means of production, democratic planning
that makes it possible for society to define the goals of investment and
production, and a new technological structure of the productive
forces.\" The first of these interpretations is a good description of
the social system that most, if not all, readers of The Ecologist would
like to see, but it is not what is usually meant by
**[[ecosocialism]{.underline}]{.mark}**. Workplace organising and unions
are important because collective action by workers, particularly
strikes, is of proven effectiveness. It does not mention abolishing
capitalism or the state or social classes or establishing public
ownership and control. It leaves open the possibility that the current
capitalist system could be reformed, making it more democratic, fair and
sustainable. The second meaning comes closest to the first, with the
addition of the old socialist slogan of production for need not profit.
However, this [[ignores the **capacity** of **capitalism** to provide
for **need as well as profit**.]{.underline}]{.mark} [The nature of the
democracy involved is also unclear. Ecological All the meanings except
Engel-Di Mauro\'s emphasise collective, public or democratic ownership
and control but]{.underline} [[they do not explain why this is necessary
to solve the climate crisis.]{.underline}]{.mark} For example, Klein
simply declares: 'To accomplish this, it will be necessary to socialize
virtually all large-scale industry.\" Albert asserts: \"Ecosocialists
convincingly demonstrate that capitalism is incapable of resolving the
climate and broader earth system crises in a genuinely sustainable - let
alone just - manner.\" Engel-Di Mauro\'s interpretation is different in
that it links ecosocialism directly with an end to state and class
power. The third, fourth and final meanings prioritise the 'social' over
the 'ecological'. The third one does not explicitly include the
ecological dimension, so it is socialist but not ecosocialist - although
of course a contraction of consumption in the global North will bring
ecological benefits. Overarching The fourth definition appears to
subordinate safeguarding life on earth to achieving the abolition of
states and classes. In reality, however, it is probably compatible with
working with non-socialists who have similar objectives and concerns
about climate change and ecocide. The final meaning leaves open the
question of what is 'ecologically rational'. Assuming the first meaning
as our overarching goal, we can ask what might be the most feasible and
effective ways to achieve that goal. If we further assume that living
sustainably involves using only renewable energy, reusable or recyclable
materials, and agroecological methods, we can ask to what extent other
ecosocialist objectives might be necessary for that sustainable living.
For example, what is the role of government in transitioning to a fully
renewable energy system - if any? Here I focus only on the practical
limitations of an approach that gives overriding priority to
overthrowing capitalism even if only as a means to achieving our
overarching goal. Building a mass movement: a way forward? Arguably,
[**[what is missing from]{.mark}**]{.underline} these understandings of
[[**ecosocialism** is an account of the processes through which it can
be achieved.]{.underline}]{.mark} Albert, for example, is critical of
those [ecosocialists who offer only idealistic visions of a future
society and wish lists for how to get there, or who \"neglect difficult
strategic questions, [trade-offs and dangers]{.mark}]{.underline} that
[[would]{.underline}]{.mark} likely e[[merge during the transition
process and beyond.\"]{.underline}]{.mark} However, his preferred
'realist' approach is [itself largely speculative and
contentious,]{.underline} [[especially on the issues of '**net energy**
decline', 'green jobs']{.underline}]{.mark} and the debt burden of a
radical Green New Deal, and it is arguable that he exaggerates the
technical and financial difficulties involved in transitioning to
ecosocialism. We can all agree with him that, for a realistic
transition, it is essential \"to engage in a prolonged process of mass
movement organizing and struggle on the conjoined terrains of
political-economy, culture, and public discourse.\" But exaggerating the
difficulties seems likely only to discourage people from joining such a
movement. Decarbonise In his latest book, Future on Fire, the
ecosocialist David Camfield also argues that our only hope for a safe
future is through mass social movements and he has much to say about the
nature of the movement that is needed. This can be summarised as:
sustained collective action, a diversity of people, appealing to a wide
spectrum of public opinion, making clear demands for justice, remaining
independent of the state and \"fundamentally extra-parliamentary\".
Rather than 'governing power' (the traditional goal of socialists), his
aim is for the movement \"to develop the power to force governments to
enact the climate justice measures that are needed\". Building a mass
social movement is therefore seen as the critical task for
ecosocialists. The foreword to Camfield\'s book by Dharna Noor is
refreshingly clear about what these measures include: \"We must phase
out coal, oil, and gas at once, reshape our transit systems and housing
plans, design a more humane and sustainable food system, decarbonise
every sector of the economy.\" Repression This level of specificity,
however, is missing from the rest of Camfield book, which mentions only
\"a just and rapid shift away from fossil fuels and from other sources
of GHG pollution, accompanied with a range of actions to draw down GHG
levels in ways consistent with climate justice principles, including
planting trees on a very large scale\" as well as actions to reverse
biodiversity loss, ocean acidification, pandemics, and other serious
ecological problems. Consequently, the movement seems to lack a
technological or financial dimension - for example, it could be pointed
out that [[it is not **possible**]{.underline}]{.mark}, even [[at a
**national level**]{.underline}]{.mark}, to phase out all fossil fuels
at once, because of our continued dependence on gas boilers, internal
combustion engines, cement and steel, artificial fertilisers, plastics,
and so on. While Albert worries about an imaginary future of
'authoritarian ecosocialism', where an electorally successful red-green
movement institutionalises state of emergency provisions, Camfield is
concerned to condemn actually existing 'elitist radicalism' because of
its potential to harm and undermine the building of a mass movement.
Elitist radicals are \"a highly committed small minority\" who attack
corporate or state targets and may use violence. The term \'attack\' as
used here does not mean a violent act. Camfield states - but without
providing any supporting evidence - that \"attacks by small groups won't
win urgently needed climate justice reforms, although they will lead to
more intense state repression that will hamper movement-building work\".
Extraction In the court of public opinion, however, things are not so
straightforward: it all depends on the nature of the attack, the motives
for the attack and the extent of public sympathy for the attackers. If
we are really in an emergency, which is recognised by most people, and
the attack addresses that emergency in some way, then it could attract
more public support and it could achieve something. Camfield is
particularly sceptical about tactics of violence against property such
as those advocated by Andreas Malm, in his book How to blow up a
pipeline. He argues that: \"Attacks on pipelines and other fossil fuel
targets by small groups of activists might hurt the profits of some
firms, but they would cause little disruption to the regular functioning
of capitalist society. \"However, they would certainly lead to more
state repression against the climate movement - and not just the groups
of activists working secretly to carry out vandalism and sabotage.
\"This would make it more difficult to organize effective kinds of mass
direct action like strikes, occupations, blockades, and incursions that
disrupt fossil fuel extraction or distribution, such as the 2016 Ende
Gelände anti-coal mass actions in Germany that Malm rightly praises.\"
Struggle It is worth noting that Malm does not call for activists to
blow up pipelines in his book. Instead, the acts of direct action he
discusses including deflating the tyres of highly polluting cars.
Interestingly, some time after the book was published some activists,
including in the UK, did exactly that. But Camfield goes on to suggest
that these activists risk falling into elitist radicalism. The
possibility that the movement might be fully supporting these small
activist groups does not seem to have occurred to him. And, for the sake
of argument, if his scepticism were well founded, then it would appear
to follow that one should be sceptical also about mass action insofar as
it can lead to increased state repression. A historical example would be
anti-union laws introduced in response to the failure of the miners'
strike in the 1980s. Today we see the erosion of the right to protest in
response to recent mass movements. Germany is still mining coal and Ende
Gelände are still fighting against this, so one could question how
effective this struggle has really been. But such scepticism seems
likely to lead only to inaction and despair, not the hope that Camfield
rightly wants to encourage. Strikes Camfield also criticises Extinction
Rebellion's strategy. This has some validity in that there is no magic
figure for the proportion of the population who need to be in the mass
movement in order to be successful, nor is there any reason to suppose
that an unelected citizens' assembly would have any more influence over
government than an elected one. He could have added that XR's
self-sacrificing approach of courting arrest and even imprisonment is of
value only insofar as it increases support for the movement and/or for
the movement's objectives, and it remains unclear how effective this
approach has been so far. However, he does not mention XR's increasing
involvement in a wide range of struggles, particularly in solidarity
with workers and anti-racist groups - a shift of approach that chimes
better with his own preferred strategy for movement building. Workplace
organising and unions are important because collective action by
workers, particularly strikes, is of proven effectiveness, e.g. for
higher pay or improved working conditions. Workers' support is of course
essential for achieving a just transition. Whither ecosocialism? We are
left with a confusing and somewhat disappointing picture. We know that
radical social changes are needed over the course of time, but what,
exactly? We know that emergency measures have to be taken immediately,
but what? [[Effective **policy on climate** and **ecology** requires
mass political support]{.underline}]{.mark}, and
[[that]{.underline}]{.mark} in turn [[requires popular economic and
social programmes]{.underline}]{.mark} on social justice as well as
climate justice - programmes that the public see to be either necessary
or desirable. As discussed by Albert, some ecosocialists have tried to
piggyback Green New Deals, but [[none has yet formulated a programme
that has been demonstrated to have mass support.]{.underline}]{.mark} I
suggest the following reasons for this. First, [[most **people do not
subscribe to socialism** and are not **convinced** that the
**nationalisation** of **much of private industry** is either
**necessary** or **desirable**.]{.underline}]{.mark} Reform Second,
[[although most people would agree that capitalism has serious flaws,
they are not convinced that it is]{.underline}]{.mark} either necessary
or [[desirable to abolish it]{.underline}]{.mark} altogether. Third, a
**[movement]{.underline}** [only of 'exploited and oppressed people' as
described by Camfield is just not big enough to solve the climate
crisis: an effective mass movement to reverse climate change must engage
with all sections of society. Fourth,]{.underline} [[if we are to have
any **kind of stable future** in this world, **ecosocialists** have no
choice but to work]{.underline}]{.mark} with non-socialists, inside,
outside and **[[across political parties]{.underline}]{.mark}**,
[building a highly inclusive climate and ecological
movement]{.underline}, involving democratic participation and action at
all levels and in all forms of social organisation. To conclude, I would
recommend, as a minimum, a focus on appropriate regulation -
nationalisation may or may not be appropriate - of fossil-fuel companies
and mandating a phasing out of emissions by 2030, combined with the
provision of universal basic services including on housing, transport
and food and a fair taxation system, including the taxing of carbon.
Greater clarity on the reasons for democratic reform would also be
helpful.

Another voice recently raised is that of Charlotte
**[[Brower]{.underline}]{.mark}**, the current **[mayor]{.underline}**
[of the North Slope Borough]{.underline}, through her letter to
Washington Governor Jay Inslee, in which she [[admonishes his view of
the]{.mark} [Arctic as a **pristine wilderness** **not to be
disturbed**]{.mark}**.**]{.underline} She says that [the
Arctic]{.underline} "is [not an area that is untouched... the majority
of our nearly]{.underline} [8000 residents]{.underline} are Inupiat
Eskimos who [continue to be stewards of the land and sea much as their
ancestors had been for millennia"]{.underline} and that "your concerns
for the environment and the natural resources of the Arctic, while
laudable, fail to acknowledge the reality of the world we live in
today\" (Brower, 2015). She thanks the foresight of Inuit elders in
developing the region's resources, citing this development as the reason
why hunters have S&R available to them, why healthcare is now available,
and why Inuit culture can now have programs to preserve it. [She calls
[the view of]{.mark} [preserving the Arctic ']{.mark}**romantic'** and
'**[parochial']{.mark}**, [stating that shipping]{.mark} in the Bering
Strait means that Alaska [is already]{.mark} at [risk]{.mark} from an

comments espouse, [our [homelands will be **more at risk**]{.mark} from
**oil spills**]{.underline}" (Brower, 2015). [In terms of climate

but rather personal choices, and that [**other nations** **will take

Federal Arctic Policy Group there are 40 agencies represented, and
almost no indigenous participation (Murkowski, 2015a). Craig Allen,
director of the University of Washington Arctic Law and Policy
Institute, has said that one issue facing the Arctic is that it has not
been properly 'humanized'. People have to understand that all decisions
about the region affect the people who live there, not just the polar
bears (Allen, 2015a).
