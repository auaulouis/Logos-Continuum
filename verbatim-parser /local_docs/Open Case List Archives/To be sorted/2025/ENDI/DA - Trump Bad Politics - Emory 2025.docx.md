[after [muscling through]{.mark}]{.underline} President Donald
[[Trump's]{.mark} "big, beautiful"]{.underline}
**[[tax]{.underline}]{.mark}** and immigration [[package by a single
vote]{.mark}.]{.underline} [But across the Capitol, [**senators** were
**more cautious**.]{.mark}]{.underline}

Republicans' aspirational deadline is July 4, ahead of a potential debt
default. Thune said groups of senators had already been meeting to
discuss the legislation and that they would want to take some time to

"We'll see how it goes," Thune said. "**[[What does it take to get to

#### Icebreakers are a [huge win]{.underline} for Trump that [unlock]{.underline} his agenda.

For an incoming president with a flair for Polar strategy, the ICE Pact
offers some enormous opportunities. [By moving quickly to survey

[[will]{.mark} have wider ramifications, [bolster]{.mark}ing [the
Trump]{.mark} [Administration's **credibility** as it **takes on
other**, more **ambitious ventures**.]{.mark}]{.underline}

**[[Icebreakers are an easy win]{.underline}]{.mark}**.
[[They're]{.underline} **[not controversial]{.underline}**]{.mark}.
[[Both parties]{.mark} fundamentally [agree with]{.mark}]{.underline}
President [[Trump's]{.underline}]{.mark} June 2020 [[call for fixing the
Coast Guard's]{.mark} **[icebreaker program]{.mark}**]{.underline} [[and
want to build a **bigger Polar fleet**]{.mark}. The ICE Pact is a good
way to do it.]{.underline}

#### Passage of the [reconciliation bill]{.underline} explodes the [deficit]{.underline}. 

**CRFB 25**. Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget. \"House
Reconciliation Bill Would Massively Increase Near-Term Deficits.\"
5-15-2025.
https://www.crfb.org/blogs/house-reconciliation-bill-would-massively-increase-near-term-deficits

[[The House is]{.mark} [continuing to mark up]{.mark} its
[reconciliation legislation]{.mark}, [which]{.mark} we estimate [would
add]{.mark} \$3.3 trillion to the debt]{.underline} including interest
**[or [\$5.2 trillion]{.mark}]{.underline}** [[if]{.mark} its temporary
**provisions** are **[made permanent]{.mark}**]{.underline}. In part
because new borrowing is front-loaded and offsets are back-loaded, [the
bill would [**add massively** to **near-term
deficits**.]{.mark}]{.underline}

We estimate the House bill would boost the FY 2027 deficit -- the
deficit in the first year the policies would be fully in effect -- by
nearly \$600 billion, or 1.8 percent of Gross Domestic Product. That's
the net effect of roughly \$770 billion of new borrowing and only \$180
billion of offsets.

[The deficits boost represents a one-third increase in total projected
deficits]{.underline} from \$1.7 to \$2.3 trillion -- and [a near
doubling of the **primary**]{.underline} (non-interest)
**[deficit]{.underline}**.

The legislation's spending and tax cuts are quite front-loaded, while
offsets are back-loaded. We estimate about 55 percent of the gross
deficit increases -- \$2.8 trillion -- would take place in the first
half of the budget window. Meanwhile only 40 percent of the offsets --
\$970 billion -- would accumulate over that period. As a result, 70
percent of the non-interest borrowing would occur in the first five
years.

The tax cut and spending increase provisions are front-loaded, in large
part, due to the use of "arbitrary expirations" designed to limit
reported costs. A number of provisions -- including the enhanced Child
Tax Credit and standard deduction, no tax on tips and overtime, 100
percent bonus depreciation for equipment, and new 'MAGA accounts' -- are
scheduled to expire in 2028 or 2029. The bill also relies on one-time
appropriations for defense and immigration, which must be obligated by
2029. And finally, the bill includes a large number of retroactive
provisions that provide a one-time windfall for activities already
undertaken.

Meanwhile, many of the offsets don't begin or ramp up until late in the
budget window. Medicaid work requirements, for example, save \$300
billion through 2034 but do not take effect until 2028. In addition,
while some of the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) energy credits are
repealed at the end of 2025, the most expensive ones only begin phasing
out in a few years with some restrictions taking effect sooner. And the
Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) state matching fund
requirements do not start until 2028.

[As a result of this mismatch and the sheer size of the bill's deficit
increases, the House bill **would** **[add]{.mark}** to the **deficit
[in every single year]{.mark}**]{.underline} -- with the possible
exception of 2025 -- [even after the **temporary provisions
expire**]{.underline}. But the largest deficit increases will take place
early in the budget window.

[This **[additional near-term borrowing]{.mark}** [could **stoke
inflation** and **push up interest rates**]{.mark}. And it may continue
in the future if policymakers extend expiring provisions and perhaps
cancel some of the offsets.]{.underline}

[Lawmakers]{.underline} [should]{.underline} remove the arbitrary
expirations, [reduce the amount of [tax cuts]{.mark}]{.underline} and
spending increases, and/[or increase the offsets to ensure that this
package does **not [add to the deficit]{.mark}** [and **worsen** our
**already fraught fiscal situation**.]{.mark}]{.underline}

[institutions]{.underline} in many regions of the world. [Besides mass

events and increasing temperatures might drive those from densely
populated coastal regions inland, increasing competition for resources,
social tension and, in some cases, the likelihood of famine. Some
nations will disappear (e.g. the Maldives) while others may be
relatively untouched (e.g. New Zealand). [Global **supply chains** could

use of **[[w]{.underline}]{.mark}**eapons of

to achieve their objectives? Perhaps there will be nations welcoming the
Human Foundation early in the course of collapse, willing to alter their
institutions, public policies and legal structures to accommodate the
foundation's vision. All these possibilities must be monitored and
factored into the Human Foundation's plans for when, where and how to
initiate the first stages of its plan for establishing the next
civilization. Researchers at the Human Foundation will need to engage in
continuous scenario analysis and planning. The precise nature of Western
civilization's collapse is unknowable, while the nature and extent of
ongoing environmental damage, with its impact on regional habitability,
a further unknown. The key will be to design a robust, adaptable plan
within a wide range of hypothetical scenarios as the changing state of
the world is revealed during the final phases of collapse and decay.

5\. Next steps on humanities' journey

All so far is premised on the assumption that western civilization it in
decline. To many it certainly doesn't feel like this is happening:
"...people are carrying on as usual, shopping for their next holiday or
posing on social media" (Spinny, 2018). There are two relatively recent
developments at work, each having played a role in temporarily
counteracting degeneration, sustaining the stage of senescence. First,
the global financial system shifted from a debit to a credit basis in
the early 1970s. This has permitted an historic increase of debts
relative to assets. [**Debt** is essentially borrowing against **future
income**, boosting growth and consumption **temporarily** in the current
region of time. At some point the **bills** from the past must be
**repaid**, shifting decline onto an **accelerated path**]{.underline}
in a shorter period than would have otherwise occurred.

[The **[Covid]{.mark}**-19 epidemic ha**[s]{.mark}** quickly
[revealed]{.mark} the **[fragility]{.mark}** of this credit expansion
cycle. Twenty-five central [banks]{.mark} had [announced
**q**]{.mark}]{.underline}uantitative **[[e]{.underline}]{.mark}**asing
initiatives by mid-April 2020 to mitigate the economic harm inflicted by
viral suppression policies. Further, governments around the world had
announced a total of \$8 trillion in additional fiscal spending to
soften the blow. [These efforts entail [**pumping liquidity** into
markets]{.mark} through central bank purchases of]{.underline} various
private and public [financial instruments. The net effect is to
**transfer** more of the **accelerating debt burden** from the private
to public sectors]{.underline}. Along with this, some predict that the
United States may run annual fiscal deficits in both 2020 and 2021 of
over 3 trillion dollars, at a rate that may approach 18 % of GDP. This
begs the question as to the limitations of this approach to economic
stabilization. BCA Research, the organization that coined the term "debt
super-cycle" back in the 1970s to describe this phenomenon, has declared
that the end of the super-cycle began in 2014 and is currently
accelerating, [[ushering]{.mark} in a **dangerous** period of
[**insidious developments** that]{.mark} will fundamentally
[alter]{.mark} the global economy and [**civilization** as we **know
it**]{.mark}]{.underline} (MarketWatch, 2020).

### Uniqueness\-\--Agenda Won't Pass\-\--2NC/1NR

#### Trump currently [doesn't have the leverage]{.underline} to get the votes in the Senate for his agenda. 

Jordain **Carney 5-22**. Reporter for POLITICO. \"Senate GOP preps for
'one big, beautiful' rewrite.\" POLITICO. 5-22-2025.
https://www.politico.com/live-updates/2025/05/22/congress/trump-bill-senate-rewrite-00365731

[[Senate Republicans]{.mark} [are vowing]{.mark} they will make
[changes]{.mark} to]{.underline} President Donald [Trump's]{.underline}
"[big, beautiful bill"]{.underline} after it passed the House early
Thursday morning.

While the end product is likely to contain sweeping areas of overlap
with the proposal negotiated by Speaker Mike Johnson, GOP senators made
clear Thursday that the House bill can't pass without major changes.
[Some of the **member [demands are]{.mark}**
[**contradictory**]{.mark},]{.underline} [[with]{.mark} some fiscal
[hawks demanding **beefed-up**]{.mark} **[spending reductions]{.mark}**
[while **others want softening**]{.mark} of the House's
**[Medicaid]{.mark}** language [and]{.mark} to preserve more
**[green-energy incentives]{.mark}.**]{.underline}

"I'm hoping now we'll actually start looking at reality," said Sen. Ron
Johnson (R-Wis.). "I know everybody wants to go to Disney World, but we
just can't afford it."

Johnson batted down the idea that he would fold under arm-twisting from
Trump --- much as his House counterparts did. "Listen, in the House,
President Trump can threaten to primary \[holdouts\], and those guys
want to keep their seats. I understand the pressure. Can't pressure me
that way."

**[[Johnson]{.underline}]{.mark}** [[said there are]{.mark} **sufficient
[votes]{.mark}** [to **block the bill**]{.mark} if his party doesn't
bend in his **direction** on **spending reductions**]{.underline},
including setting up a bicameral process for going "line by line" to
find a total of roughly \$6.5 trillion in cuts over the coming decade.

[One of the Republicans]{.underline} he believes is [in his
corner]{.underline} --- Sen. Rand **[Paul]{.underline}** (R-Ky.) ---
[said Thursday that while he **supports** the **party's tax
agenda**]{.underline}, [he cannot support the bill]{.underline} if it
includes a debt ceiling hike. [Republicans]{.underline} [want to use the
party-line bill to increase the debt ceiling until after the 2026
election without having to **give concessions** to
**Democrats**.]{.underline}

"I think if you're going to raise the debt ceiling \$4 or \$5 trillion,
it indicates that the project afoot isn't going to fix the deficit at
all," Paul said. "Once Republicans vote for this, Republicans are going
to own the deficit."

[Senate Majority Leader John **[Thune]{.mark}** [can **lose three GOP
senators**]{.mark} and still get the party-line bill ---]{.underline}
which ties a tax overhaul together with new border, defense and energy
spending --- through the chamber. [[Most]{.mark} Republicans [view
**Paul** as a hard "no" and acknowledge **Johnson** might be, **as
well**.]{.mark}]{.underline}

[Thune wants to get the bill through the Senate by July 4]{.underline},
saying Thursday that holiday deadline is the "goal and the aspiration"
but will depend on "what does it take to get to 51?"

He added that he spoke to Trump after the House bill passed just hours
before. "The president," he said, is "very happy" and "ready to go to
work with the Senate."

[In addition to the fiscal hawks]{.underline}, [[Thune is facing a
clutch of senators]{.mark} [who have concerns]{.mark} [about the
**House's language**]{.mark} [on a **range of
issues**]{.mark}]{.underline}, [including]{.underline} changes to
[Medicaid]{.underline}, the cancellation of [green-energy tax
credits]{.underline} [and pushing some **food-aid costs onto
states.**]{.underline}

Trump spoke to one of the potential holdouts --- Sen. Josh Hawley
(R-Mo.) --- Wednesday night, though their conversation also touched on
unrelated issues like disaster aid. Two others --- Sens. Susan Collins
(R-Maine) and Lisa Murkowski (R-Alaska) said they expected significant
changes.

"There are some things that we want to address on the Medicaid side that
I think are challenging for us in Alaska," Murkowski said.

#### There are [enough "no" votes]{.underline} to block the bill. Trump needs to [brandish]{.underline} deficit-reducing credentials to pass it.

WASHINGTON --- As the Senate prepares to consider the sprawling domestic
package that House Republicans passed last week, Sen. Ron
**[[Johnson]{.underline}]{.mark}**, R-Wis., [[said he thinks there are
"**enough**" **Republicans** to]{.mark} "**[stop the process]{.mark}**"
in order to prioritize **stronger reductions** in spending and the
**national deficit**.]{.underline}

The Wisconsin Republican has criticized the bill's impact on the
deficit, characterizing outsize spending as "mortgaging our children's
future." The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office has estimated that
the bill would add \$2.3 trillion to the federal deficit over 10 years.

Johnson said in an interview on CNN's "State of the Union" that
[[congressional Republicans should]{.mark} **[examine spending]{.mark}**
"line by line, [like **DOGE has done**]{.mark}" [to find **areas** to
**eliminate**.]{.mark}]{.underline}

The senator's criticism comes as the Senate is gearing up to consider
changes to the House bill, which passed by a single vote, setting up
another fight over government deficit levels, funding for programs and
attempts to rein in spending ahead of Republicans' goal to send a final
version of the bill to President Donald Trump's desk by July 4.

[Several [Republicans]{.mark}]{.underline} in the Senate have
[**[expressed skepticism]{.mark}** [about **aspects** of the
bill]{.mark} [for]{.mark} what they view as **[inadequate spending
cuts]{.mark}** or **[shrinking Medicaid access]{.mark}** and have
**promised** to change it. Any **changes to the** **bill** would need to
be approved by the **House** before it goes to Trump.]{.underline}

### Uniqueness\-\--PC Low\-\--2NC/1NR

#### Trump's political capital is low\-\--[economic approval]{.underline}. 

Anna **Commander 25**. Deputy News Editor. \"Trump\'s approval rating on
the economy hits new low, polls show.\" Newsweek. 3-27-2025.
https://www.newsweek.com/trump-economy-approval-rating-new-low-gallup-2051744

President Donald **[[Trump\'s]{.underline}]{.mark}** economic [[approval
rating is dipping]{.mark} to the lowest it\'s ever]{.underline}
[been]{.underline}, according to new polling released on Thursday.

Newsweek reached out to the White House for comment via email on
Thursday.

Why It Matters

Trump has repeatedly touted positive approval ratings and polling during
news conferences and campaign rallies throughout his political career.

When the president returned to the White House in January, Trump coasted
in with positive numbers, but his approval ratings have dipped
significantly in the last couple of weeks.

[Any slipping in polls [could]{.mark} **[limit Trump\'s political
clout]{.mark}**]{.underline} [in an already highly **polarized climate**
and hurt **Republican chances** in the 2026 midterms.]{.underline}

What To Know

[Trump\'s **[approval ratings]{.mark}** in surveys conducted [by]{.mark}
nearly **[every]{.mark}** major [pollster are]{.mark} **now
[negative]{.mark}**.]{.underline}

[The president\'s approval rating on the economy has also taken a hit
amid mounting fears of a trade war as Trump levies steep tariffs against
Canada]{.underline}, Mexico and China during his second term.

Those fears spiked this week, after Trump announced plans to implement a
25 percent tariff on imported vehicles beginning on April 2.

In a new Gallup poll out on Thursday, 41 percent of Americans approve of
how the president is handling the economy versus 59 percent who
disapprove.

The survey was conducted from March 3 to March 16 among 1,002 adults
living in the U.S. It has a four percent margin of error.

A February Gallup poll shows Trump\'s approval on the economy was 42
percent versus a 54 percent disapproval rating.

In Gallup polls conducted during Trump\'s first term, his economic
approval rating never dipped lower than 45 percent, according to
Gallup\'s data.

Thursday\'s poll comes on the heels of a CNN poll earlier this month, in
which 56 percent of Americans disapproved of Trump\'s handling of the
economy, while 44 percent approved.

The CNN poll was conducted from March 6 to March 9 among 1,206 U.S.
adults. Its margin of error was 3.3 percent.

In an Economist/YouGov poll released on Wednesday, 43 percent of U.S.
adults approve of Trump\'s handling of the economy and jobs, compared to
47 percent who disapprove.

In a Gallup tracker on economic confidence among Americans, February
shows a -19 index, the same as January. December\'s index was -14 and
November\'s was -17.

What People Are Saying

Kevin Wagner, a political science professor at Florida Atlantic
University, told Newsweek via text message on Thursday: \"We would have
to see a consistent pattern over the course of several polls to consider
it a trend. While a low poll number on the economy is never a good sign,
the longer term public mood will depend in part on how people assess how
the president is addressing their concerns.\"

Democratic pollster Matt McDermott wrote on X, formerly Twitter, on
Thursday: \"Gallup finds Trump with a 43% approval rating and an even
worse rating (41%) for his handling of the economy. Voters are starting
to turn on Trump --- fast.\"

What Happens Next

[As Trump\'s first 100 days in office continue to unfold, [his
**political capital**]{.mark} [and power]{.mark} [to **get things
done**]{.mark} with a **narrow GOP majority** in the **House**
[could]{.mark} [be]{.mark} **heavily [affected by
polling.]{.mark}**]{.underline}

#### And, the Yemen scandal crushed PC with Republicans. 

John **Bowden 25**. Washington Correspondent. "Trump wants to move on
after the text-chain disaster. Pete Hegseth could end up being his
scapegoat." The Independent.

Magaworld, meanwhile, tried to direct the blame to Waltz --- seen as a
neoconservative by many. An editorial in The American Conservative,
which has published essays from Vice President JD Vance in the past,
declared that the national security adviser must resign.

"I hope there is an FBI investigation. We need to know how reckless the
use of Signal was in this context, how easy or not easy it was for
foreign intelligence to access the ruminations of Trump's national
security decision-making. And we need to know how often Waltz used
Signal to communicate, and leak, to Goldberg," wrote the magazine's
Scott McConnell.

[The **[text-chain bombshell]{.mark}** is a [**major distraction** for
**Republicans**]{.mark} [at]{.mark} a **time**]{.underline} [when the
administration is pursuing its first real push for **legislative
priorities**]{.underline} [through]{.underline} the congressional budget
**[[reconciliation]{.underline}]{.mark}** process, [an effort made [more
difficult by]{.mark} slim majorities in both **chambers** and
**[disagreements]{.mark}** over strategy]{.underline}. [[Sapping the

[Despite some recent momentum]{.underline}, [[the]{.underline}]{.mark}
U.S. Coast Guard's [[Polar Security Cutter]{.underline}]{.mark}
([PSC]{.underline}) [[program remains in disarray]{.mark}. [It is a
perfect target for]{.mark}]{.underline} Elon Musk['s team of

(**[[DOGE]{.underline}]{.mark}**). [[America's]{.mark} heavy [icebreaker

years after the contract was first awarded\--is getting awfully gentle
treatment from government customers that [might]{.underline}, [by now,
be better off mulling other options.]{.underline}

The challenges facing the Polar Security Cutter Program are ready-made
for DOGE. Timid Department of Homeland Security managers, cowed by the
size of what is now estimated to become a \$5.1 billion program, are
frightened of Bollinger Shipyards, the politically well-connected
contractor building the ships. [[The government]{.mark} customer
[is]{.mark} fearful of [losing billions in

ship, PSC stakeholders are **putting** their **energy** into **keeping

That focus has led to an ugly cultural problem. At this point, [with
[the]{.mark} Polar Security Cutter]{.underline}, the [[Coast Guard

**program's** **[bureaucratic]{.mark} [momentum]{.mark}**\--keeping the

That's not good for anybody.

Instead of begging DOGE to come in and, at a minimum, reset PSC
stakeholders on accountability and firm contractual milestones, the U.S.
Coast Guard seems content to let this wayward shipbuilding program carry
on, in the off chance that it delivers something that floats sometime in
the 2030s.

For observers, the Administration's failure to quickly start evaluating
the Coast Guard's PSC Program has been somewhat perplexing. President
Trump has focused on icebreakers for years. Hours after President Donald
Trump's inauguration, a newly-empowered Acting Secretary of Homeland
Security cited, in part, "mismanagement in acquiring key acquisitions
such as icebreakers," to justify the brutal defenestration of Admiral
Linda Fagan, the Commandant of the Coast Guard. Then, President Trump
stated a commitment to build 40 icebreakers. It looked like a
programmatic reckoning for the PSC was on the way.

But, as of right now, [**icebreaker reform** seems **frozen**, **locked
in pack ice**.]{.underline} The Coast Guard's PSC program is chugging
along. And now, enlivened Coast Guard bureaucrats are filling the
vacuum, rushing to make the PSC production line a permanent feature in
future Coast Guard budgets.

[Unless the **White House acts quickly**]{.underline}, [bringing in the
DOGE]{.underline}, [and]{.underline}, potentially, [appointing a new
Coast Guard Secretary to manage the tricky politics of **troubled DHS**
**procurements**]{.underline}, [Coast Guard bureaucrats]{.underline},
bolstered by reconciliation funding, [will likely use the next few
months to get **permission** to lock in **material purchases for the
next two PSCs.**]{.underline}

That won't go well. [Bureaucratic maneuvers]{.underline} during an
administrative interregnum may keep the PSC alive another day, but it
[will do little to get **America** the **icebreakers it needs** to push
aside both **ice** and **rivals** in the **Arctic** and the
Antarctic.]{.underline}

The Polar Security Cutter Design Is A Problem:

It is easy to forget the Polar Security Cutter Program was originally
meant to deliver an entirely new class of heavy polar icebreakers by
2024. With a lot of fanfare, the Coast Guard awarded a three ship
contract in 2019, and then swiftly discovered\--as I warned six years
ago\--that the shipyard's engineering capabilities were too weak to
survive both the Coast Guard's aggressive schedule and the shipyard's
low, bargain-basement bid of \$1.9 billion.

Today, taxpayers have little to celebrate beyond a catalogue of
inexplicable missteps, basic planning failures and organizational
disruption. Parts of the shipyard had to be redeveloped because planners
failed to understand the vessel's ultimate weight. Naval architects
somehow overlooked the design of an entire key deck, a debacle that
likely led the original bidder, a subsidiary of Singapore-based
conglomerate ST Engineering, to sell the yard in 2022 fire-sale.
Production facilities and processes were---and apparently still
are---struggling to handle icebreaker-caliber steel.

The laundry list of basic engineering oversights and production mistakes
offers little confidence that the PSC will be anything more than a
flawed and unreliable vessel.

But, rather than halt the program, or simply force the contractors to
focus on complying with the Government Accountability Office's set of
best shipbuilding processes, both the Department of Homeland Security
and the Coast Guard have consistently doubled down on building up the
program's inevitability. Nothing\--no matter how egregious the
mistake\--seems to stick on this teflon ship. The PSC just keeps
rumbling along, lurching from one misstep to another.

The programmatic momentum was on full display in December 2024. In the
final days of the Biden Administration, the Coast Guard quietly approved
construction of the first PSC and, with DOGE absent, the Program is
anticipating a larger production decision sometime in the next few
months

Authorization to construct the ship was unnecessary. Aside from the fact
that the shipyard is still struggling to complete several "practice"
modules of the ship\--whose construction was authorized a year and a
half ago, the formal authorization to begin PSC-1 construction was in
defiance of best shipbuilding practices.

This is a serious issue. The Coast Guard says that the "current design
maturity for the whole ship is 90% for functional design, and 72% for
overall design maturity." That's not great. Government watchdogs at the
U.S. Government Accountability Office want 100% of the functional design
complete before construction starts. That's tough to do, but the numbers
are in the GAO's favor. According to the GAO, the Coast Guard's decision
to start building the Offshore Patrol Cutter when the functional design
was 97% complete "led to construction rework and contributed to an
estimated cost increase of 19 percent to the lead ship" and "a schedule
delay of the lead Offshore Patrol Cutter by almost 2 years." The first
OPC has yet to be delivered, and the costs are likely to increase. If
the PSC aligns with the OPC's ugly performance trends, starting PSC
construction with this amount of design uncertainty puts the Coast Guard
at real risk of an even bigger fiasco.

Admittedly, naval architecture is a challenge for everybody on the
waterfront. Since 2022, the Coast Guard and their "new" PSC contractor,
Bollinger Shipyards, have worked hard to find naval architects who have
the right skills needed to help move the design maturation process
forward. But increased speed towards a goal shouldn't be a surrogate for
completion of the goal itself. Things might be going better for the PSC
right now, but...better progress shouldn't hide the ugly fact that, six
years after contract award, the PSC design isn't done, and checks on the
work already done still need to be brought to completion.

Worryingly, the transitional design, a point when the ship's 2D
functional design drawings are translated into sort of a walk-through 3D
model, appears to be lagging behind, at around 60% complete. But that 3D
model is where the rubber really hits the road. A 3D model helps reveal
systemic problems with major distributed ship systems (water, power and
HVAC, for example), and identify alignment issues that don't reveal
themselves easily on 2D drawings. It helps the builder generate the
final production design, which, in turn, informs schedule and price.

That's a concern. Nothing should get built until the 3D model is
complete. On February 19, at a Hudson Institute meeting, Nickolas H.
Guertin, the former Assistant Secretary of the Navy for Research,
Development and Acquisition, emphasized the importance of a stable
design, saying, "it would be reasonable to say that you need to have at
least the 3D model part of it done sufficiently so that you know what
you're building," refining it "down to a high enough level of detail so
that you're not incurring/discovering risk in the construction process."
In his words, government shipbuilders should "cheat a little" by using a
completed ship design to drive down risk and increase the chance a new
ship can be built profitably. That's not been done with the Polar
Security Cutter. In fact, the Coast Guard has quietly been building the
ship for the past year and a half.

It hasn't been going well.

Bollinger began fabrication of the first PSC module in July 2023. It\'s
still not done.

U.S. Coast Guard

Polar Security Cutter Production Is Halting:

After the original bidder for the Polar Security Cutter program quit,
selling their U.S. shipyard holdings and contracts to Bollinger
Shipyards for pennies on the dollar, the Coast Guard has been solicitous
of Bollinger's efforts to turn the wayward shipyard around. But it's
time to appreciate Bollinger's two and a half years of recovery work and
maybe think about moving on with something Bollinger can actually
execute.

Despite authorizing production in the interregnum between
Administrations, the Polar Security Cutter's plans are still incomplete.
But even more worryingly, Bollinger is evidently struggling to handle
production of the simplest, lowest-risk parts\--or modules\--of the
ship.

In July 2023, the Coast Guard authorized work on up to eight pieces of
the ship, or "prototype modules," in the 85-module vessel. According to
Bollinger, the shipyard expected each module to require only
"approximately four months of labor." But, after getting approval to
build the low risk modules, progress has been painfully slow\--likely
reflecting the immaturity of the workforce, the design, or the
production processes. By March 2024, the Coast Guard reported to
GCaptain.com that, "unit 1 is approximately 42% complete; unit 2 is
approximately 27% complete, and unit 3 is approximately 5% complete."

These modules have simply not progressed. As of December 2024, six of
eight "Prototype Fabrication Assessment" modules have been authorized,
and are in various states of production, "ranging from 5% to 75%
complete." This excruciatingly slow pace is hard to justify. At best,
the shipyard is demonstrating a troubling inability to complete the
contract according to terms that they themselves highlighted when they
started building the modules.

Bollinger's inability to complete basic modules suggests real problems.
The production plans\--which aren't done\--have likely proven to be
inadequate, forcing the shipyard to redo their work. The shipyard may
not understand heavy icebreaker production challenges, forcing the yard
to modify their building strategy. And then, the shipyard, operating in
the shadow of HII's busy Ingalls vessel fabrication facility and down
the road from Austal USA's thriving manufacturing site in Mobile,
Alabama, may not have the workers needed to take on such a big project.

There are no easy fixes, and the troubling results are hard to spin in a
positive fashion. In aggregate, the shipyard's slow progress is an
enormous warning sign that the shipyard is unready to move forward\--and
it is reason enough to force the shipyard to spend more time to hone
their production work and fully complete the functional design, the 3D
model and the detailed production design before accelerating
construction or authorizing more ships. It may be worthwhile to pay
Bollinger a little more to finish the practice modules it has already
started. Bollinger may grumble that delay will complicate worker
retention or recruitment, but, if Bollinger cannot build simple,
low-risk modules in a timely fashion, why even think about authorizing
the fabrication of even more complex pieces of the ship?

Sources within Coast Guard headquarters suggest that the shipyard has
learned a lot, and they are proud that the first seven modules involve
over 2000 long tons of steel, the equivalent of building a medium
endurance cutter. Sadly, these Coast Guard tastemakers don't reflect
that the building rate\--as it is now\--appears unable to meet the
positively glacial building pace set by years-late and massively
over-budget Offshore Patrol Cutter.

It's not good. In effect, Bollinger has, over 17 months, managed to
build maybe around 3% of the first ship. Even if the shipyard had
succeeded in building all six of the Prototype Fabrication Assessment
modules by now, Bollinger, at that rate, would need around twenty years
to finish the first ship. But at the current rate of production,
Bollinger will be lucky to complete the first PSC in 45 years\--a tough
sell for ships that usually have 30-year service lives. It's great to
see big pieces of ship get built, but those pieces of ship rust in
shipyard, the slow pace of Bollinger's fabrication efforts\--coupled by
the fact that Bollinger originally thought the modules could be
completed in four months\--should sober even the biggest Bollinger
cheerleader.

Shipbuilding is hard. Both the Coast Guard and Bollinger have done a lot
to recover the Polar Security Cutter contract. But the work isn't done
and this program has a long way to go and there is a lot of
unparameterized risk to work through. Rather than hold Bollinger to the
uncompromising terms of a firm, fixed price contract, Coast Guard seems
very solicitous of the politically well-connected shipyard. It seems
more interested in the bureaucratic gamesmanship of keeping the
icebreaker program alive than it is in the grinding business of building
a ship. With that in mind, it is time for DOGE to step in.

Today, [[America has a **lot** of **options** to **build
icebreakers**]{.underline}]{.mark}. South Korea, Finland and other
countries are waiting in the wings, eager to help America build new
icebreakers. With some of the biggest shipbuilders in the world champing
at the bit and looking for new U.S. business, [America may lose out on a

[[As President-elect Donald **Trump** pushes]{.underline}
[for]{.underline}]{.mark} the U.S. to acquire
[[Greenland]{.underline}]{.mark} from Denmark, [[**politicians** from
**both sides** of the **aisle** say **more security** around the
**Arctic is needed.**]{.underline}]{.mark}

\"[[There\'s no **question**]{.mark} that **[Russia]{.mark}**
[is]{.mark} much more **[present]{.mark} up there** and [**China\'s**
now]{.mark} **[raising their game]{.mark}**]{.underline}, and they\'re
acquiring property in Iceland,\" said Rep. Joe Courtney, D-Conn.,
ranking member of the seapower subcommittee with the House Armed
Services Committee, reported The Hill.

[**China and Russia** have begun competing with the U.S. and NATO
countries to access the **natural regions** in **the**
Arctic]{.underline}. [Greenland has minerals that can be
used]{.underline} [for electric vehicles]{.underline}, [and **China**
has **invested heavily** in the **country**]{.underline}, The Hill
reported.

Trump has said purchasing Greenland is about national security. Rep.
Michael McCaul, R-Texas, former chair of the House Foreign Affairs
Committee, said Denmark should spend more on the island\'s security.

\"What he\'s saying is, like, \'Look, we got a base there. There are a
lot of natural resources. And the Arctic is getting exploited by Russia
and China,\'\" McCaul said.

Thule Air Base, built in 1951, provides installation support for vital
space-based missions, is home to the Defense Department\'s northernmost
deep-water port, and has a 10,000-foot runway. It is operated by the
821st Space Base Group, which works on force projection, space
superiority, and scientific research in the Arctic region.

[[Courtney]{.mark} [said the U.S. needs to **build more icebreaker
ships**]{.mark} to control the Arctic **rather** than buy
**Greenland**.]{.underline} The country entered into a pact with Finland
and Canada to build more icebreakers. The Coast Guard operates only two
icebreakers in the Arctic, while Russia has 41.

[[Rep. Adam Smith]{.underline}]{.mark}, D-Wash., ranking member of the
Armed Services panel, [[said]{.underline}]{.mark} the U.S. should work
more collaboratively with Denmark and Greenland.

\"I think it is important. Russia and China certainly are involved in
many strategic \[areas\],\" Smith said. \"I don\'t think owning
Greenland is a strategic necessity, but certainly [**[being engaged in
that part of the world is important]{.underline}**.\"]{.mark}

Joe Biden signed what's known as the ICE Pact, in which the US, Canada
and Finland agreed to cooperate on icebreaker production. With
increasingly tense relations between Ottawa and Washington, however, the
fate of that agreement is unclear.

[[on]{.mark} presidential legislative agendas and [the]{.mark}
**[president's influence]{.mark}** on the **legislative
process**]{.underline}. [One set of studies focuses on the]{.underline}

Elder, 1983; Kingdon, 1995; McKay & Webb, 2019; Rutledge & Larsen-Price,
2014; Schattsneider, 1960).]{.underline}

[Eshbaugh-Soha and Peake]{.underline} (2005) [find [the
president]{.mark} [has]{.mark} some [ability to focus]{.mark}
congressional [attention]{.mark} [on economic
issues]{.mark}.]{.underline} Other studies focus on the president's
ability to get Congress to pass the president's legislative priorities.
[Some studies **claim** [how the **president**]{.mark} [**packages**
their agenda **determines**]{.mark} its **[legislative success or
failure]{.mark}**]{.underline} (Bond & Fleisher, 1990; Light, 1999;
Neustadt, 1990). However, [there are **some limits** to presidents'
ability to get legislative items through Congress]{.underline}.
Canes-Wrone (2001) finds appeals by the president can influence
legislative success, but appeals are more likely to work when issues are
salient to the public. Edwards (1989) argues presidents are limited in
convincing Congress to act on proposals its members already support. The
president cannot convince Congress to adopt policies members initially
oppose, so [the president's **main influence** is getting **things**

[they]{.mark}]{.underline} [[**design**]{.mark} [their]{.mark}
**legislative [agendas]{.mark}** [if they are to succeed]{.mark} [in
getting it passed]{.mark} through Congress]{.underline}. One thing they
should consider is the partisan makeup of Congress.

[There is also some evidence presidents shape their agenda based on
partisan conditions in Congress.]{.underline} Eshbaugh-Soha (2005)
argues presidents set their agenda based on the partisan makeup of
Congress and the level of the federal budget deficit. Several studies
argue the presence of divided government affects what type of
legislation is passed by Congress (Edwards et al., 1997; Mayhew, 1991).
Several studies also find partisan conditions in Congress affect the
success of presidential initiatives (Byers et al., 2020; Edwards et al.,
1997; Franklin & Fix, 2016). Eshbaugh-Soha and Peake (2005) find divided
government leads to less legislation passing and especially less
important legislation passing. Ansolabehere et al. (2018) find
presidents in the 20th century on average pass four more major pieces of
legislation per Congress when their party controls Congress. However,
some studies have claimed that partisan conditions do not necessarily
affect the amount of legislation Congress will pass (Ansolabehere et
al., 2018; Mayhew, 1991).

While [there is **[plenty of evidence]{.mark} [presidents]{.mark}** can
**[set]{.mark}** [the]{.mark} **political [agenda]{.mark}**]{.underline}
and that the partisan conditions in Congress affect how the president
structures his agenda, there has been little examination on the
political consequences of legislative success for the president's party
in midterm elections.

#### Political capital is [real]{.underline}, [finite]{.underline}, and [key to legislation]{.underline}.

Biden to Waste Political Capital,\" 11-6-2020.

If we want clean energy to succeed [in the]{.underline} upcoming [Biden
administration, we have to (a) **be realistic**, and]{.underline} (b)
fight like hell to [keep him **focused**]{.underline} on it as much as
possible. [[**Political capital** is **scarce**]{.underline}]{.mark},
and the threats to our future from climate change are real, [so allowing
the various Democratic **lobbies** to **suck** all of the **oxygen** out
of the room is **not an option**]{.underline}.

Here's a quick rundown of the problem and some ideas on what we can do
to help clean energy win.

It's All About Political Capital

In short, [**[p]{.mark}olitical [c]{.mark}apital** is [a way to think
about]{.mark} **political [power]{.mark}** [in **democratic**
countries]{.mark}]{.underline}. Yes, [winning elections does give
some]{.underline} political power, [but [you **can't**]{.mark}
**effectively [use]{.mark}** [it unless you]{.mark} have
**[coalitions]{.mark}**, **[alliances]{.mark}**, **[trust]{.mark}**,
[**goodwill**, and **influence**]{.mark}. Your earned trust and
[connections]{.mark} [are]{.mark} **like money**]{.underline}
(**[[capital]{.underline}]{.mark}**). [You can **work hard** to **earn**
it and **build** it up, but it's **[easy to spend]{.mark}** it
[and]{.mark} **even [waste]{.mark}**]{.underline} it, just like money.

[[If you]{.mark} get power]{.underline} from an election [and then
**quickly [spend]{.mark}** all of the **[political c]{.mark}apital**
impressing loyalists, [you]{.mark}'ll get to the point where you can't
win]{.underline} future elections (Trump is a great example of this),
[[**can't get votes together** for legislation]{.mark}, and **can't**
get people to **help you**]{.underline} in a variety of other ways. At
worst, a political leader who has run completely out of political
capital might not even be able to get normal citizens to follow laws. As
the consent of the governed is withdrawn, you see protests, riots,
violence, terrorism, and even war.

For better or worse, [Biden won't start out with much political capital
to begin with]{.underline}. After a narrowly won election, not taking
the Senate (because many voters rejected Trump but voted for Republicans
further down the ballot), and then extended accusations of cheating,
[it's not going to be easy to get things done]{.underline}.

Earning More Political Capital Is Essential

To get more political capital, Biden will need to find ways to heal the
rifts after the election. This is true after any election, but the job
is going to be that much harder in 2021. While there's a segment of the
population that will never accept a president of the opposite party,
there are still plenty of reasonable people who will need to be won over
(at least a little).

If we want Biden to succeed, we need to not take part in divisive
politics. Don't rub Trump fans' faces in it, as tempting as that can be.
Be nice to people on social media, even if they're hurt or feeling pain
over the loss of an election. Try to understand that people have whipped
up many people into fear of a Democratic president, and cut them some
slack. Do anything you can to discourage "sore winners" next year.

Don't Encourage The Don Quixotes To Waste It On The Impossible

[There are things that **simply aren't possible**]{.underline} with a
Democratic president and a Republican Senate. [No matter how badly
people might want]{.underline} an expansive Green New Deal, gun control,
high taxes on the rich, and other [such things, it's just not going to
happen.]{.underline} Like Don Quixote, a fictional senile old man who
tried to fight imaginary monsters (who were, in reality, windmills),
[there are people in the Democratic Party who would gladly **waste**
what **little political capital** is **available** on their **quixotic
quests**]{.underline}.

If it's not going to happen, [it's not harmless to try]{.underline}
anyway, [or even to make a bunch of noise]{.underline} about it.
[[Everything has a **cost**]{.mark}, and [the cost of]{.mark}
[pushing]{.mark} these [policies is that policies you **could get
passed** into law **don't happen**]{.mark}]{.underline}[.]{.mark}

[A number of [studies]{.mark} have [show]{.mark}n that [Congress
**considers**]{.mark} **current levels of [presidential
approval]{.mark}** [when passing legislation]{.mark}]{.underline} (Brady
and Volden 1998; Cohen et al. 2000; Edwards 1980, 1989). [Early
[studies]{.mark} were able to [find **correlations between**]{.mark}
**approval [ratings and success in Congress]{.mark}**]{.underline} (see,
e.g., Edwards 1980; Ostrom and Simon 1985). However, later research
depicts the relationship between approval ratings and legislative
success as more conditional (Canes-Wrone and De Marchi 2002; Edwards
1989). [[Supporting]{.mark} a piece of [legislation championed by an
unpopular president could]{.mark} ultimately [result in **negative
consequences**]{.mark} **for members of Congress**]{.underline}. [If
presidents propose legislation to Congress that is salient with the mass
electorate and has [**higher levels** of **approval**]{.mark}, however,
[then members]{.mark} stand to **[gain]{.mark} from supporting the
president**]{.underline}.9

On a similar note, the honeymoon period of a president's initial time in
office has been shown to increase the likelihood of legislative success
(Beckmann and Godfrey 2007; Brace and Hinckley 1991; Farnsworth and
Lichter 2011; McCarty 1997). Presidents lose their favorability with the
public and with Congress the longer that they are in office (McCarty
1997), which is why they often push for significant legislative
accomplishments early in their term. [Members of [Congress]{.mark} are
**uniquely [aware of]{.mark} the [public]{.mark}'s [sentiments]{.mark}**
after a presidential election]{.underline}, especially because they
share a common constituency with the president [[and]{.mark} are **more
likely to [capitulate]{.mark}** [to]{.mark} a [president's
agenda]{.mark}]{.underline}.10 Therefore, a president should receive
more cooperation from members of Congress for their legislative agenda
items earlier in his term.

I always laughed when I was in the White House and read stories about

He believes---and he's right---that with a tweet or a press conference,
the news media soaks it up. I don't think he worries too much about a
bad news cycle, because it's only a matter of hours, not days or weeks
with this guy. [[He's using his levers of]{.mark} [**influence** to

indicates that his party will almost certainly lose the House in the

[Trump's]{.underline} proposed [[tax cuts

[[proposals]{.underline}]{.mark} would [**[add over]{.mark} \$[5

Since the US government borrows in US dollars, it is highly improbable
that it will ever default on its debts. The Federal Reserve will always
be able to print the dollars needed to finance the government and repay
its debt obligations. However, [[putting]{.mark} the country's [debt

Trouble". AEI. 1-15-25.
https://www.aei.org/op-eds/why-donald-trumps-tax-cuts-could-lead-to-economic-trouble/

On Monday of next week, Donald [Trump]{.underline} will begin his
[second term]{.underline} in the White House **[against several
indicators]{.underline}** [that suggest that [now]{.mark} is [**not the
time** for budget policy **recklessness**]{.mark}.]{.underline} We hope
Mr. Trump is paying close attention to those indicators. Maybe he will
then walk back some of the [budget-busting tax-cut
propo[sals]{.mark}]{.underline} he kept making on the campaign trail. If
he does not, we should [brace ourselves for **rough economic sledding
this year.**]{.underline}

Start with inflation. [Today's consumer price inflation
numbers]{.underline} [show]{.underline} that stripping out the volatile
food and energy components from the index, [[inflation]{.mark} is
running at 3.2 percent]{.underline}. This [[remains **uncomfortably
above**]{.underline}]{.mark} the [Federal Reserve's]{.underline} 2
percent inflation [[target]{.underline}]{.mark}.

This suggests that [if]{.underline} the [Fed resumes its interest
rate-cutting cycle]{.underline}, it will [need support to curb demand
through budget policy restraint.]{.underline} [Yet this is **hardly
what**]{.underline} Mr. [**Trump has in mind** with]{.underline} his
promises of an array of [tax cuts]{.underline}, including the 2017 Tax
Cut and Jobs Act extension and the elimination of income taxes on social
security benefits and tips.

[Recent budget deficit [numbers]{.mark}]{.underline} also seem to be
**[[screaming for]{.mark} budget policy
[restraint]{.mark}]{.underline}**. Those numbers show that the [[budget
deficit for]{.underline}]{.mark} the [[first three months]{.mark}
of]{.underline} the [2025]{.underline} fiscal year [was almost [40
percent higher]{.mark} than last year.]{.underline}

[Meanwhile]{.underline}, the Congressional Budget Office
([CBO]{.underline}) [estimates]{.underline} that [[in
2024]{.underline}]{.mark}, the [budget [deficit **was 6**]{.mark} **½
[percent of GDP]{.mark}**]{.underline}, even when unemployment remained
close to its postwar low. The CBO is also warning that [even before
taking]{.underline} the [budget impact of]{.underline} Mr. [Trump's tax
cuts into account, by 2034]{.underline}, the [national debt]{.underline}
about the size of the economy is [on track to **exceed its end of the
Second World War level.**]{.underline}

If Mr. [Trump is not paying attention to]{.underline} the **[dangerous
debt path]{.underline}** on which our country finds itself, the [[bond
market]{.mark} is [**fully alert** to]{.mark}]{.underline} those
[[dangers]{.underline}]{.mark}. Since Mr. Trump looked increasingly
likely to win the election in September, the [all-important 10-year
[Treasury bond yield]{.mark} has **[spiked]{.mark}**]{.underline} from
3.6 percent [to **4.8 percent.**]{.underline}

It seems not to have escaped the market's notice that Mr. [Trump's [tax
cut]{.mark} proposals]{.underline} would [cause]{.underline} a
[**substantial deterioration** in our country's public
finances]{.underline}. According to the Committee for a Responsible
Budget, Mr. Trump's tax cut proposals would [**[add]{.mark} \$[7]{.mark}
¾ [trillion]{.mark}** [to]{.mark} the budget
[deficit]{.mark}]{.underline} if fully implemented [over the next
decade]{.underline}. [That]{.underline}, in turn, [would [see]{.mark}
the [national debt **exceed**]{.mark} **a [Greek]{.mark}-like [140
percent of GDP]{.mark}** [by 2034.]{.mark}]{.underline}

Yet another reason for budget restraint is our gaping trade deficit,
which is now running more than 3 percent of GDP. At a time when the
country is already the world's largest debtor country, the last thing we
need is a budget policy that furthers our trade deficit by exacerbating
our savings-investment imbalance.

Yet that is what the Trump tax cut policy would do by reducing
government savings and by incentivizing investment.

In 2022, Liz Truss, the then UK prime minister, threw caution to the
wind by introducing an expansive budget not to the market's liking. The
bond market and currency market crisis that ensued cost Ms. Truss her
job.

[Let us hope]{.underline} that Mr. [Trump's advisors draw]{.underline}
Mr. [Trump's attention]{.underline} to that recent UK experience. [Maybe
then]{.underline} Mr. [Trump]{.underline} [will]{.underline} scale down
his tax cut proposals and [[**spare us** from]{.mark} our own **[bond
market crisis.]{.mark}**]{.underline}

Matters," <https://www.chicagobooth.edu/review/debt-still-matters>

In 2021, the United States is projected to pass a milestone: [US federal
**[debt]{.mark}** is forecast to [exceed **100 percent** of
GDP]{.mark}]{.underline}. In fact, according to an [October
estimate](http://www.crfb.org/press-releases/national-debt-now-larger-economy) from
the nonpartisan Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, the debt has
already eclipsed that mark. But does all this debt matter, or is
worrying about debt passé?

This debate has been going on among economists for a while. Modern
monetary theory has gotten a lot of attention for its arguments that
debt has few consequences, but one need not go to the extremes of MMT to
find support for such a view. Some in the mainstream of economics have
argued that since the interest rate on US government debt may be lower
than the growth rate of the economy, the US can roll over debt forever.
Others have advocated that additional debt-financed spending may have so
strong a multiplier as to pay for itself, a super-Keynesian version of
the Laffer curve.

Unlike MMT, these are logically consistent possibilities. But are they
right?

The interest rate on US government debt is indeed slightly lower than
good guesses of the economy's growth rate, as sadly low as the latter
is, so if we roll over the debt with no additional deficits, the
debt-to-GDP ratio will slowly decline and the US can indeed run this
slow-rolling Ponzi scheme.

But how long will this happy circumstance of ultralow interest rates
continue? More to the point, how scalable is this opportunity?
Bond-market investors lend 100 percent of GDP to the US government at 1
percent interest. Will they lend 200 percent of GDP at the same low
interest rate, or will they start to require higher interest rates? A
government that finances itself only with money and no debt need not pay
back the money---but, obviously, that government cannot double the
opportunity.

More deeply, like many good arguments, this one misses the central
point. What happens when the US piles on larger and larger debt-to-GDP
ratios each year, and doubles the debt-to-GDP ratio in each decennial
crisis? The argument I referenced above is about sustainability of a
large but steady debt-to-GDP ratio. It really is only about whether the
government can run a small, steady deficit, or must run a small, steady
surplus to maintain that steady debt-to-GDP ratio. It does not justify a
debt-to-GDP ratio that grows forever.

[[**Everyone** recognizes]{.mark} that [there is a]{.mark}
**debt-to-GDP** ratio **[limit]{.mark}** out there
somewhere]{.underline}. It is not a hard and fast limit. Bondholder
patience combines government debt, other opportunities, and bondholders'
view of the government's political stability and willingness to pay back
debt. [What is clear is that **finding the limit** will be unpleasant,
[involving]{.mark} essentially [a **sovereign**]{.mark} **debt
[crisis]{.mark}**, a **sharp [inflation]{.mark}**[, **devaluation**,
and]{.mark} **financial [catastrophe]{.mark}**]{.underline}.

The view that debt-financed spending pays for itself is likewise limited
to a period of "secular stagnation" with perennially deficient demand,
sticky prices and wages, and other requirements of extreme Keynesianism.
Are we in such a period, or is COVID-19 a supply shock? Was the economy
really suffering from lack of demand when unemployment hit a 50-year low
this past February?

Washington knows no such sophistication, but our politicians have
grasped the logical implications of the proposition that debt does not
matter with more clarity than have economists.

[The notion that **debt matters**, that spending must be financed
**sooner or later**]{.underline} by taxes on someone, [and that those
taxes will be economically **destructive**, has vanished]{.underline}
from Washington discourse on both sides of the aisle. The COVID-19
response resembles a sequence of million-dollar bets by non--socially
distanced drunks at a secretly reopened bar: "I'll spend a trillion
dollars!" "No, I'll spend two trillion dollars!" That anyone has to pay
for this is unmentioned.

And who is to blame the politicians for acting this way, really? Markets
offer 1 percent long-term interest rates---negative in real terms.
Blowout spending financed by the Fed printing money---which is no
different from debt---has resulted in no inflation so far. In the face
of the deep concerns of current voters, worry that our children and
grandchildren might have to pay off debt is not particularly salient.
They're either in the basement playing video games or out protesting for
the end of capitalism anyway. Politicians will take the cheap money as
long as markets are happy to provide it.

The economists, even the modern monetary theorists, envision debt issued
to pay for worthy investments, or valuable spending, all undertaken with
a careful green-eyeshade approach. Washington has figured out the
logical conclusion of the idea that federal debt doesn't matter, in a
way these economists have not: If debt and money printing have no fiscal
cost, why be careful about how you spend money? Send checks to voters.
Why not? It's costless. No boondoggle project is objectionable. Send
billions to prop up dying businesses. Why not? It's costless. Why bother
fixing the post office? Send them another \$25 billion. Or \$100
billion.

We can go further. Why should citizens have to pay back debts if the
federal government does not have to do so? Bail out student loans. Bail
out bankrupt state and municipal governments and their pensions. Cancel
the rent. Cancel the mortgage. Why should anyone have to pay any debt if
our federal government has access to a money machine? Why work? Why
should the federal government not just keep printing money and sending
it to us? Other countries are not so lucky as we are. Why should
emerging markets pay back debt if the US does not have to? Bail them
out.

These are inescapable logical conclusions of the view that federal debt
has no fiscal cost. If you're uncomfortable with the end of the trip,
perhaps you should revisit the assumption from which it inexorably
follows.

Advocates point to World War II. It is true that the US exited the war
with an even greater debt-to-GDP ratio than it has today. It was not
painless. Growth higher than interest rates was part of how the US
managed it, but it's not the whole story. Two bouts of inflation, in the
late 1940s and in the '70s, devalued much debt. The US ran steady
primary surpluses (excluding interest costs) from the 1940s through the
mid-'70s. Spending was low in the pre-entitlement economy, and the
government was not totting up hundreds of trillions in unfunded
promises. The war, and its spending, was over. Statutory personal taxes
and actual corporate taxes were high. Financial repression and closed
international capital markets kept interest rates on government bonds
low, and deprived Americans of better investment opportunities---and the
world's economies of much-needed investment capital. With all that, we
still had an international debt crisis in the early 1970s, prompting the
abandonment of the Bretton Woods system and depreciation of the dollar.

In short, the US grew out of WWII debt by not borrowing any more, by
decades of fiscal probity, and by strong supply-side growth in a
deregulated economy. We have none of these reassurances going forward.
And this event, and the United Kingdom's exit from Napoleonic War debt
in the 1800s by starting the industrial revolution, are about the only
historical examples of a semi-successful repayment of this much debt.
Otherwise, the history of large sovereign debts is one long, sorry tale
of default, inflation, devaluation, and consequent financial chaos. [The
UK did **not exit** WWII debt successfully, leading to **crisis after
crisis**, and everyone else did worse.]{.underline}

Still, what should we be afraid of? The vision of grandchildren saddled
with taxes, or even just unable to borrow more while the economy sits at
its limit of, say, 200 percent debt to GDP, is indeed not a salient
brake to spending.

That is not the danger. [[The danger]{.mark} the US faces]{.underline},
the danger we should repeat and keep in mind, [[is]{.mark} a **debt
crisis**. We print our own money, so the result may be a **sharp
[inflation]{.mark}** [that **wipes away**]{.mark} the value of
[debt]{.mark} rather than an even more disruptive
**default**]{.underline}, but the consequences will be almost as dire.

Imagine that five or even 10 years from now [[we have **another
crisis**]{.mark}, which we surely will. It might be another, worse,
**[pandemic]{.mark}**, or a [**war** involving **China**, **Russia**, or
the]{.mark} **Middle [East]{.mark}**. [Imagine]{.mark} the US follows
its **present trends** of partisan government
**[dysfunction]{.mark}**]{.underline}, so an impeachment is going on, as
well as a contested election, [[and **militias**]{.mark} even roam the
streets of still-boarded-up cities. [Add a]{.mark} **huge economic
[recession]{.mark}**, but without any reformed spending
promises]{.underline}.

At this point, the US has, say, 150 percent debt to GDP. It needs to
borrow another \$5 trillion--\$10 trillion, or get people to hold that
much more newly printed money, to bail out once again and pay everyone's
bills for a while. It will need another \$10 trillion or so to roll over
short-maturity debt. [At some point, **bond** investor**s** see the end
coming, as they did for **Greece**, and refuse. Not only must the US
then **inflate** or **default**, but the normal
**[crisis-mitigation]{.mark}** policies]{.underline}---the firehouse of
debt relief, bailout, and stimulus that everyone expects---[[are
absent]{.mark}, together [with]{.mark} our capacity for [**military** or
**public**]{.mark}**-health [spending]{.mark}** [to meet]{.mark} the
shock that **sparks the [crisis]{.mark}**]{.underline}.

Interest rates do not signal such problems. They never do. Greek
interest rates were low right up until they weren't. Interest rates did
not signal the inflation of the 1970s, or the disinflation of the '80s.
Nobody expects a debt crisis, or it would have already happened.

As noted above, there is no defined limit to the debt-to-GDP ratio that
policy makers can use for guidance. Countries can borrow a huge amount
when they have a decent plan for paying it back. Countries have had debt
crises at quite low debt-to-GDP ratios when they did not have a decent
plan for paying it back. Debt crises come when bondholders want to get
out before the other bondholders get out. If they see default, haircuts,
default via taxation, or inflation on the horizon, they get out. Sound
long-term financial strategy matters.

[[We cannot tell when]{.mark} the [**conflagration** will come. But we
can **remove**]{.mark} **the [kindling]{.mark}** and **gasoline** lying
around]{.underline}. Reform long-term spending promises in line with
long-term revenues. Reform the tax code to raise money with less damage
to the economy. The Treasury and Fed should secure long-term government
financing, locking in low interest rates. And spend only as if someone
has to pay it back. Because someone will have to pay it back.

[[The nation faces]{.mark} an **[unprecedented]{.mark} array** of
[**challenges** and]{.mark} will [**inevitably** encounter]{.mark}
additional [crises]{.mark}]{.underline} in the future. Yet some in
Congress have a strange belief there is an infinite supply of money to
deal with any current or future crisis, and that spending trillions upon
trillions will have no negative consequence for the future. I disagree.

[An **[overheating]{.mark}** economy has [imposed]{.mark} a costly
["**inflation tax**"]{.mark} on every]{.underline} middle- and
working-class [American. At \$28.7 trillion and growing, the nation's
**[debt]{.mark}** has [reached **record levels**]{.mark}]{.underline}.
Over the past 18 months, we've spent more than \$5 trillion responding
to the coronavirus pandemic. Now Democratic congressional leaders
propose to pass the largest single spending bill in history with no
regard to rising inflation, crippling debt or the inevitability of
future crises. [**[Ignoring]{.mark}** the fiscal
[consequences]{.mark}]{.underline} of our policy choices [will [create a
disastrous future]{.mark}]{.underline} for the next generation of
Americans.

Those who believe such concerns are overstated should ask themselves:
[[What]{.mark} do we do [if the **pandemic** gets worse]{.mark} under
the next **viral mutation**[? W]{.mark}hat do we do [if there is a
**financial crisis**]{.mark} like]{.underline} the one that led to [the
Great Recession? [What if we face a **terrorist**]{.mark} attack
[or]{.mark} major **international [conflict]{.mark}**[?]{.mark} How will
America respond to such crises if we needlessly spend trillions of
dollars today?]{.underline}

Instead of rushing to spend trillions on new government programs and
additional stimulus funding, Congress should hit a strategic pause on
the budget-reconciliation legislation. A pause is warranted because it
will provide more clarity on the trajectory of the pandemic, and it will
allow us to determine whether inflation is transitory or not. While some
have suggested this reconciliation legislation must be passed now, I
believe that making budgetary decisions under artificial political
deadlines never leads to good policy or sound decisions. I have always
said if I can't explain it, I can't vote for it, and I can't explain why
my Democratic colleagues are rushing to spend \$3.5 trillion.

Another reason to pause: We must allow for a complete reporting and
analysis of the implications a multitrillion-dollar bill will have for
this generation and the next. Such a strategic pause will allow every
member of Congress to use the transparent committee process to debate:
What should we fund, and what can we simply not afford?

I, for one, won't support a \$3.5 trillion bill, or anywhere near that
level of additional spending, without greater clarity about why Congress
chooses to ignore the serious effects inflation and debt have on
existing government programs. This is even more important now as the
Social Security and Medicare Trustees have [sounded the
alarm](https://www.wsj.com/articles/social-security-costs-expected-to-exceed-total-income-in-2021-as-covid-19-takes-financial-toll-11630436193?mod=article_inline) that
these life-saving programs will be insolvent and benefits could start to
be reduced as soon as 2026 for Medicare and 2033, a year earlier than
previously projected, for Social Security.

Establishing an artificial \$3.5 trillion spending number and then
reverse-engineering the partisan social priorities that should be funded
isn't how you make good policy. Undoubtedly some will argue that bold
social-policy action must be taken now. While I share the belief that we
should help those who need it the most, we must also be honest about the
present economic reality.

Inflation continues to rise and is bleeding the value of Americans'
wages and income. More than 10.1 million jobs remain open. Our economy,
as the Biden administration has correctly pointed out, has reached
record levels of quarterly growth. This positive economic reality makes
clear that the purpose of the proposed \$3.5 trillion in new spending
isn't to solve urgent problems, but to re-envision America's social
policies. While my fellow Democrats will disagree, I believe that
spending trillions more dollars not only ignores present economic
reality, but makes it certain that America will be fiscally weakened
when it faces a future recession or national emergency.

In 2017, my Republican friends used the privileged legislative procedure
of budget reconciliation to rush through a partisan tax bill that added
more than \$1 trillion to the national debt and put investors ahead of
workers. Then, Democrats rightfully criticized this budgetary tactic.
Now, my Democratic friends want to use this same budgetary tactic to
push through sweeping legislation to make "historic investments."
Respectfully, it was wrong when the Republicans did it, and it is wrong
now. If we want to invest in America, a goal I support, then let's take
the time to get it right and determine what is absolutely necessary.

Many in Washington have convinced themselves we can add trillions of
dollars more to our nearly \$29 trillion national debt with no
repercussions. Regardless of political party, elected leaders are sent
to Washington to make tough decisions and not simply go along to get
along.

For those who will dismiss my unwillingness to support a \$3.5 trillion
bill as political posturing, I hope they heed the powerful words of Adm.
Mike Mullen, a former chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, who called
debt the biggest threat to national security. His comments echoed the
fear and concern I've heard from many economic experts I've personally
met with.

At a time of intense political and policy divisions, it would serve us
well to remember that members of Congress swear allegiance to this
nation and fidelity to its Constitution, not to a political party. By
placing a strategic pause on this budgetary proposal, [by
**significantly [reducing]{.mark}**]{.underline} the size of any

CLIMATEWIRE \| [[The **clean energy transition** may soon **be on its
own**]{.mark}**.**]{.underline}

[[The \"One Big Beautiful Bill Act]{.mark}\"]{.underline} passed last
week by the House would effectively end most clean energy tax credits,
[[reversing]{.mark} a large chunk of former President Joe [**Biden\'s**
**climate agenda**.]{.mark}]{.underline}

Wind and solar projects would need to begin construction within 60 days
of the bill\'s passage --- or start operations within two years --- to
receive the credits before they expire. Clean energy factories that use
Chinese inputs or equipment would essentially be barred from receiving
federal money. Tax credits for electric vehicles would be gone entirely
by the end of next year.

"[[It is **definitely** **massive headwinds**]{.underline}]{.mark},"
said Sam Huntington, director of North American power research at S&P
Global Commodity Insights. "[If the bill goes through as the House has
set it up, that is [a pretty **bleak scenario** for the next few years,
at **least**."]{.mark}]{.underline}

[S&P estimates **cumulative wind**, **solar** and **battery**
**installations** would fall 20 percent through 2040]{.underline}.
BloombergNEF has called **[the House bill]{.underline}** --- which still
needs to clear the Senate --- "**[[the nightmare scenario for US clean

Many analysts think the bill\'s spending cuts will be watered down in
the Senate. ClearView Energy Partners, a research firm, termed the bill
"a high water-mark" for rollbacks in a note to clients.

Impact of Medicaid Cuts on Infection Prevention and Public Health.\"

[**[Medicaid]{.mark}** funding plays a **[crucial]{.mark}
role**]{.underline} [[in supporting]{.mark} [**infection**
**prevention**]{.mark} **programs,**]{.underline}
**[[vaccination]{.mark} initiatives]{.underline}**, [[and]{.mark}
[access to]{.mark} **essential [health]{.mark} care** services for
vulnerable populations.]{.underline} However, [with proposed [Medicaid
cuts]{.mark} amounting to **\$800 billion**]{.underline}, health care
[experts]{.underline} [are raising concerns about the
[devastating]{.mark} effects these reductions could]{.underline} have on
hospitals, community programs, and overall **[[public
health]{.underline}]{.mark}**. In an exclusive discussion, Niobis
Queiro, MBA, CEO of the Queiro Group, and Imamu Tomlinson, MD, MBA, CEO
of Vituity, provide insights into how these **[budget
cuts]{.underline}** [could]{.underline} significantly impact infection
prevention efforts, exacerbate workforce shortages, and
[[increase]{.mark} the [spread of **infectious
diseases**]{.mark}.]{.underline}

This discussion underscores the urgent need for policymakers to consider
alternative strategies to mitigate the impact of Medicaid reductions and
protect public health efforts nationwide.

ICT: With Medicaid facing a potential \$800 billion cut, how might
reduced funding impact infection prevention programs in hospitals and
other health care settings?

Niobis Queiro, MBA: The good news is that hospitals are dedicated to
infection prevention; this is evident during the blackout of information
from the CDC. Hospitals nationwide are united by communicating
infectious disease data and outcomes within their markets.

We are concerned about the [increased financial strain]{.underline} that
will impact facilities. Many hospitals and outpatient programs serve
Medicaid and Medicare populations that will not be compensated for said
services, but the need does not go away. This [will create a [**gap** in
**services**]{.mark}.]{.underline} [There is great concern about
**[research]{.mark}** [for]{.mark} **infectious [diseases]{.mark}** that
have been **[halted]{.mark}** or limited due to the **impending
cuts**]{.underline}. In summary, there are 3 areas to watch in this
situation: financial impact to deliver care with limited funding for the
Medicaid population, resource (staffing/supplies/transport to care)
limitation due to financial impact, and research gaps for infectious
diseases.

Imamu Tomlinson, MD, MBA: Potential Medicaid cuts will diffusely affect
hospital operations. Hospitals, especially nonprofit hospitals, operate
at very narrow margins. Further squeezing those margins will leave
hospitals and health care providers in the difficult position of
choosing where to cut. Oftentimes, community programs are the first
programs to be cut. Many of those programs are frontline immunization,
education, and public health programs.

Hospitals serve as the communities\' safety net, which could be more
difficult with cuts. For example, [[immunizations]{.underline}]{.mark}
in underserved communities [are often done [through]{.mark}]{.underline}
[[Medicaid]{.underline}]{.mark}-funded programs. [[Without]{.mark} these
programs, some areas may have [outbreaks of **diseases**]{.mark} we
haven\'t seen in years, [like **measles** and
**chickenpox**]{.mark}.]{.underline}

ICT: What challenges will hospitals and health care organizations face
in maintaining infection control measures if Medicaid funding is
significantly reduced?

NQ: Health care budgets are 80% human resource driven. Not all hospitals
will be impacted the same; it truly depends on their geographic area and
payer mix. The areas that will be greatly impacted will be urban and
rural communities. This is where we see the highest number of Medicaid
patients and areas already struggling with health care deserts. The
first area that will be impacted is vaccinations; for example, COVID-19
vaccines have not been supplemented in 2024-25, and hospitals have
stopped requiring them for their employees and are promoting them to
patients due to the cost. The cost of vaccination will make it
prohibitive for low-income children to get them without Medicaid
funding. Hospitals rely on government programs that supplement cost and
access for infectious disease control. Keeping programs open will be
difficult, and expanding services is a thing of the past. Policy
requirements will be difficult to achieve without the funding
designation to keep our population safe from infectious disease.

IT: As mentioned, the cuts could have a diffuse impact. I believe
hospitals and health systems are very vigilant about maintaining sterile
environments and have very stringent infection control measures. That
said, every system has its limits. [Limiting funding could lead to labor
and supply shortages that could affect those processes.]{.underline}

ICT: How could the budget cuts affect access to essential vaccinations,
screenings, and treatments for infectious diseases among vulnerable
populations?

NQ: The reason we have such quality awareness of infectious disease,
vaccination, screening and treatment programs was due to the investment
in population health through the Medicaid program. Every notice, program
notification, vaccine, and treatment program are supplemented by the
Medicaid program to achieve a healthy population.

[Infectious disease control comes into play with school entrance
requirements and some **preemployment** health
**screenings**]{.underline}. [These efforts are
supplemented]{.underline} [financially by the government and are in
jeopardy of being slashed by pending cuts.]{.underline} Hospitals and
clinical programs are neither funded nor equipped to manage or deliver
these programs without government funding support. There will be serious
hard decisions that will have to be made, and the only hope will be
private donations to save our population's health.

IT: Many underserved communities rely on Medicaid for much of their
primary and preventative care. As with the measles example, limiting
access to those services could potentially increase health care costs
and lead to outbreaks in some communities. In this case, school-age
children are the most at risk if there were to be limited immunizations
or well-child checks as a result of cuts.

ICT: Many infection prevention efforts rely on staff training and
resources. What are the risks of workforce shortages or reduced
infection control education due to financial strain?

NQ: Programs will close. We must get innovative about our training
methods. This is the silver lining. We will have to lean into AI to
train our workforce. We can use ambient AI agents to monitor and support
in-time training for the staff. The cost is less than in-person
training, and it delivers higher efficiency. Hospitals are adopting this
model quickly due to the scarcity of training resources and the
performance efficiency it delivers. Yes, we have a large population of
clinical staff that is aging out, as is true in all industries. There
will be an anticipated reduction in staff, and as people leave, they
will not be replaced. There will be a major strain in providing the
population with adequate information and training. This is where we will
see philanthropic efforts increase to support the care and well-being of
the American people at the grass-roots level and within health care
systems.

IT: We already have a pretty significant workforce shortage across
health care, so less support will only make things worse. I believe
hospitals may have to leverage other technologies or outsource services
to accommodate that workforce reduction. However, that gap will likely
be too wide to bridge with other creative measures.

ICT: Emergency rooms already face overcrowding---how could Medicaid cuts
exacerbate the spread of infectious diseases in these high-risk
environments?

NQ: Public health is at an all-time crisis in America. The USDA (ERS)
has reported that 146 rural hospitals stopped providing inpatient
services from 2005 to 2023 in the United States. [We have health care
deserts that have patients traveling over 100 miles to get
car]{.underline}e. When people are limited in their access to care or
have financial limitations for care, they fail to seek care, and we will
return to high comorbid condition rates, and patients will only go for
care when they are on their deathbeds. [The [spread of]{.mark}
**infectious [disease]{.mark}** is **[sure to
rise]{.mark}**]{.underline}, [and the [inability to **control**]{.mark}
the **[disease]{.mark}** **processes**]{.underline} [[due to]{.mark}
**lack of [herd immunity]{.mark}** will rise.]{.underline} We already
have an example of this in the measles outbreak we are experiencing in
Texas, New Jersey, and Kentucky due to high rates of vaccine exemptions
and the mobile nature of this country.

IT: As we saw with the pandemic, [health care locations can be locations
where]{.underline} [infectious disease spreads]{.underline}. [[With
cuts,]{.mark} [more people]{.mark} could [use]{.mark} the
[emergency]{.mark}]{.underline} [[department]{.mark} as their **primary
entrant** for **care**]{.underline}. From an infectious disease
standpoint, [emergency departments are [high risk]{.mark}]{.underline}.
So [bringing more health patients seeking primary care options to the
emergency department could [lead to **inadvertent
outbreaks.**]{.mark}]{.underline}

Promising, life-saving medical [research]{.underline} is at risk [and
thousands of jobs are **at risk**]{.underline}. Small [U.S.]{.underline}
biotech [[companies face **financial hardship**]{.mark} and **possible
[bankruptcy]{.mark}**.]{.underline} All of this is [[due to]{.mark}
a]{.underline}n [ill**-conceived** 2017 [tax law change that is]{.mark}
proving [**catastrophic** to]{.mark} America's]{.underline} small
[cutting-edge [research companies.]{.mark}]{.underline}

Congress must act quickly to reverse this [**existential threat**
to]{.underline} life-saving [research and development.]{.underline}

iNFixion Bioscience is a small startup with four employees, dedicated to
developing treatments for a rare disease called neurofibromatosis (NF1).
NF1 impacts one in 3,000 Americans, causing nervous system tumors and
pain, bone issues such as scoliosis, and cognitive, learning and social
deficits. Unfortunately, iNFixion's very existence is now threatened by
Section 174 of the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA).

The general public probably isn't familiar with Section 174 of the TCJA
and its impact on small businesses. It wasn't realized just how
devastating it would be until companies started working on their 2022
taxes, the first year Section 174 change took effect.

[The]{.underline} new [[TCJA Section 174]{.mark} tax law
provision]{.underline} now [[requires all]{.underline}]{.mark} research
and development ([[R&D]{.underline}]{.mark}) [[expenses to be amortized
**over**]{.mark} **a [five-year period]{.mark}**]{.underline}, as
opposed to the IRS tax code that, for decades, had allowed companies to
deduct the entirety of R&D expenses in the year incurred.
[Unfortunately, this]{.underline} single tax-code [[change]{.mark} is
**[having]{.mark} a [colossal]{.mark} tax [impact]{.mark}**, especially
[for]{.mark} early-stage [companies fueling innovation **with
significant R&D spending.**]{.mark}]{.underline}

The simple explanation? [Instead of being able to deduct 100%
of]{.underline} NIH, DoD or other [grant funding, allowing companies to
put]{.underline} the [entire amount towards research]{.underline}, small
[[companies]{.underline}]{.mark} like iNFixion [can [now deduct **only
20% of a grant per year**]{.mark}]{.underline}. The other 80% of these
grants are now treated as taxable "income," thus creating an
often-irreconcilable tax liability for these small R&D companies.

[As a result]{.underline} of the IRS Section 174 tax law change,
iNFixion's 2022 [[tax liability]{.mark} will [increase]{.mark} **from
zero [to tens of thousands of dollars]{.mark}**, [with **no funds
available** to pay taxes]{.mark}]{.underline}. iNFixion has invested
heavily into promising neurofibromatosis research yet now faces the
untenable reality of potentially laying off employees, abandoning its
NF1 research and, by extension, abandoning patients. Sadly, iNFixion is
just one of [[**thousands** of]{.mark} American R&D
[companies]{.mark}]{.underline} [[in]{.mark} biotech, [defense]{.mark}
and beyond that are [facing]{.mark} a similar tax
[dilemma]{.mark}.]{.underline}

Retrenchment, Cornell University Press, p. 42-49

[Once declining powers get involved in a dispute, are they [more likely
to escalate?]{.mark} The **evidence suggests [no]{.mark}t**. [Declining
powers had]{.mark} an **average [hostility]{.mark}**]{.underline} in
their militarized disputes of 2.8, which compares to 2.9 for the
baseline, a difference [[that is **not**]{.mark} **statistically
[significant]{.mark}**]{.underline}.46 Out of our sixteen cases of
declining powers, seven had an average hostility that lay above the
baseline in their militarized disputes, whereas seven had an average
hostility that lay below the baseline. One partial exception to this
null result may be small decliners, who had an average dispute hostility
of 2.6. But [**in general**, the **typical [behavior]{.mark}** [of
declining powers]{.mark} appears to [resemble]{.mark} that of their
**[non-declining counterparts]{.mark}**. They tend to
display]{.underline} or threaten to display [force]{.underline}, rather
than actually use it.

Collectively, these three sets of [[findings]{.mark} provide **sturdy
[evidence]{.mark}** [against]{.mark}]{.underline} preventive
[[war]{.mark} theories. [**Far** from]{.mark} being more [likely to
**lash out**]{.mark} **aggressively**, [declining powers appear **no
more likely** to **initiate**]{.mark} militarized [disputes than]{.mark}
the **[average]{.mark} power**]{.underline}. Nor do declining powers
appear more vulnerable to scavengers. Indeed, [[declining powers
participate in **fewer**]{.mark} **militarized [disputes]{.mark}** than
their **non-declining counterparts**. The [evidence]{.mark}]{.underline}
also [**calls into [question]{.mark}** predictions]{.underline} that
[declining powers favor **[do-or-die schemes]{.mark}**]{.underline}.
Rather, declining powers do not get involved in disputes that escalate
to higher levels of hostility than the average power.

Arguably, the big exception came in Trump's first term, when the Senate

[[The White House is signaling]{.mark} to **[GOP
lawmakers]{.mark}**]{.underline} [that President [Trump\'s]{.mark}
massive [tax]{.mark} package isn\'t an a la carte menu: It\'s a prix

Why it matters: While **[[officials]{.underline}]{.mark}** want the
\"one big, beautiful bill\" to include all of Trump\'s tax priorities,
they [plan to [make extending]{.mark} [his]{.mark} 2017 [tax package the
**centerpiece** of their **messaging campaign**]{.mark}]{.underline},
according to an administration official.

T[he plan is to use [the **threat of tax increases**]{.mark} for all
**Americans** to **[convince]{.mark} [Congress]{.mark}** [to
**pass**]{.mark} **all of [their]{.mark} tax
[proposals]{.mark}.**]{.underline}

Zoom in: The only concession the White House is making on cost is to
offer shorter time horizons for some of Trump\'s business-friendly tax
cuts.

For example, Trump\'s plan to offer 100% expensing to build new
factories will only be available for FY2025 -- FY 2028. (Note: that
includes this year.)

Driving the news: [[The White House **reminded**]{.mark} key
**[lawmakers]{.mark}** [of the **president\'s tax priorities**]{.mark}
last week]{.underline}, Punchbowl News reported today.

That includes making Trump\'s 2017 Tax Cut and Jobs Act permanent, as
well as tacking on the three proposals that Trump discussed the most
during the campaign: No taxes on tips, Social Security payments and
overtime.

He also wants to include a trio of business-friendly tax cuts that
surprised many Republicans when Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent called
for them last week.

That includes deductibility for auto loans for American-made cars and
motorcycles, full expensing for new factories and a 15% corporate rate
for corporations and pass-throughs that manufacture goods domestically.

The intrigue: The Congressional Budget Office hasn\'t scored all of the
president\'s new proposals. House and Senate lawmakers are bracing for
sticker shock.

The White House is also offering some pay-fors.

Their biggest target is to eliminate some of the tax incentives in
President Biden\'s Inflation Reduction Act.

They also want to go after the tax-exempt status of university
endowments, tax breaks for professional sports team owners and treat
carried interest as regular income.

[The bottom line: The White House still plans to use the late-summer
debt ceiling X-date as a **powerful forcing** **mechanism** to get
**Trump\'s tax bill through Congress**]{.underline}. [As]{.underline}

My research does not support Greenstein's theory. Instead, my findings
align more closely with those of George Edwards in At the Margins, where
he argues that the "national preoccupation with the chief executive is
misplaced," and that [**[pres]{.mark}**idential [power
is]{.mark}]{.underline}, in fact, [**[limited]{.mark}** in the
Constitution's "purposefully **inefficient system** in
which]{.underline} the founding fathers' handiwork in [decentralizing
power defeats even the most capable leaders."]{.underline}50

Instead of focusing on legislative skills as a source of presidential
influence, Edwards argues that [**[party]{.mark}** support [and **public
support** are more important]{.mark}. Legislative [skills are
**only**]{.mark} critical [for "members]{.mark} of Congress who remain
**[open to change]{.mark}** after other influences]{.underline} have had
their impact."51 [In a time as polarized as [today]{.mark}, where
**[very few]{.mark}** members of Congress [are]{.mark} "open to
chang\[ing\]" their vote, these **skills play a minor role** in
legislative negotiations]{.underline}. Similar assertions are made in
another book by Edwards, Predicting the Presidency. He argues that
exploiting existing opportunities (consolidating existing party and
public support) is much more important for presidential success than
creating opportunities (convincing legislators to change their vote vis
a vis legislative skills).52

[Both **[Lyndon]{.mark}** Johnson [and]{.mark} Ronald
**[Reagan]{.mark}** are remembered for their **exemplary** political
skills]{.underline}. The Johnson Treatment, a legislating strategy in
which Johnson used his imposing 6'4", 240-pound figure -- literally
physically and verbally bullying, cajoling, lobbying, and threatening --
to get what he wanted out of people,53 remains infamous in presidential
political literature. Similarly, Ronald Reagan, "The Great
Communicator," is still revered for his oratorial prestige. Although
these legislative skills were useful in passing the pieces of
legislation outlined in the case studies -- Johnson gaining support from
southern Democrats on the EOA and Reagan compellingly speaking in favor
of the ERTA -- [they proved **impotent** in political
contexts]{.underline} not conducive to change. [After Vietnam for
Johnson and after the passage of the ERTA for Reagan]{.underline} (in
conjunction with the recession in 1982), [the presidents' **policy
windows closed**. Their renowned legislative skills [could **not
overcome** an **inopportune**]{.mark} political
[context]{.mark}]{.underline}.

[The **case [studies]{.mark}**]{.underline} thus demonstrate the value
of skills at the margins, but also [[exemplify their **unsubstantial**
influence]{.mark} as the major factor driving policy. Again, the
**research** suggests that political context is the **most important**
factor in legislative change]{.underline}.

5.4 Applying Lessons to the Present: Predicting Biden's Success

With an understanding that the political context largely drives a
president's potential for change, with skills helping on the margins, it
is important to assess the 2021 political climate in order make an
informed prediction about Biden's prospects.

The COVID-19 pandemic opened a significant policy window for Biden. With
a U.S. death toll nearing 580,000, massive unemployment, and a severe
economic contraction, the pandemic was an all-encompassing problem that
the entire country wanted addressed. Thus, the three streams of problem,
policy, and politics converged to open the opportunity for the Biden
administration to pass the American Rescue Plan. The Rescue Plan was
signed into law in March and has received bipartisan support from the
American public.54

President [Biden claimed a mandate]{.underline} from his election,
arguing that "millions of Americans" "voted for \[his\] vision," giving
"a clear victory" and tasking him to make his "vision real."55 [However,
[based on]{.mark} the **extreme [polarization]{.mark}** in D.C., [it is
**unlikely** to]{.mark} become a quantifiable mandate that
**[change]{.mark}**s **Congressional [voting]{.mark}**
behavior]{.underline}.56 Polarization has made it impossible to win
cross-party support, or, in Edwardsian terms, create new opportunities.
[[There is **deep**]{.mark} **political [antagonism]{.mark}**
[between]{.mark} parties, [and]{.mark} even with[**in**
parties]{.mark}]{.underline},57 [making any sort of bipartisanship
**near impossible**]{.underline}.

[**No Republican** voted to support the **A**]{.underline}merican
**[R]{.underline}**escue **[P]{.underline}**lan. [The fact that there
was **no** Republican support]{.underline} for such a clear public
problem [demonstrates the **vast distance** between party
solutions]{.underline}. This portends a situation where it is unlikely
that the Democrats can expect any bipartisan cooperation, especially as
the agenda moves away from COVID.

Although President Biden began his term signing by signing many
executive orders, [in general, presidential [tools]{.mark}]{.underline}
such as unilateral action and veto bargaining [[are **not useful**
for]{.mark} attaining sustainable **legislative change**]{.underline}.58
President Biden's "chocolate chip diplomacy" with both Republican and
Democratic legislators from both chambers of Congress indicates he may
be trying to use the legislative skills honed through 36 years in the
Senate to garner bipartisan support.59 However, [such skills only help
**on the margins** and, in such a **partisan environment**, I doubt they
would help him at all in [attracting a **single**]{.mark} **Republican
[vote]{.mark}**]{.underline}.

negotiating style on tariffs. That is probably the most generous

that is where he is most comfortable.

[[How it will end remains unclear]{.mark}.]{.underline} One possibility
is that Trump\'s big beautiful bill gets split as it tries to push
through a renewal of his 2017 tax cuts to score a desperately needed

alarms about the problem decades ago, starting with a study published in
1984. Russia, with its extensive northern coastline, now has over 40
large icebreakers, and more under construction. The United States has
barely been able to keep two or three in service.

[[An urgent Coast Guard]{.mark} [report]{.mark} to Congress in 2010

Economic Committee. \"The Case for Trump's 15 Percent Corporate Tax
Rate.\" Cato Institute. 1-8-2025.
https://www.cato.org/blog/case-trumps-15-percent-corporate-tax-rate

President-elect Donald **[Trump]{.underline}** [campaigned on **lowering
the US corporate income tax rate** to **15 percent**]{.underline}. He
made the same request in 2017 when Republicans passed their tax cuts,
but Congress only cut the federal rate to 21 percent---down from the
worldwide high of 35 percent.

Data from the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development
(OECD) suggest that cutting corporate taxes in 2025 will likely not
result in steep revenue losses. Additionally, more competitive business
taxes will make America an even more attractive destination for global
investment and workforce expansion. Congress should deliver on Trump's
promise or eliminate the tax entirely.

Lower Corporate Tax Rate, Higher Revenue?

[Lower corporate income [tax rates **encourage**
**investment**]{.mark}]{.underline}[,]{.mark} **[increase
[productivity]{.mark}]{.underline}**[,]{.mark} [expand **[job]{.mark}
opportunities**]{.underline}, [[and attract]{.mark} internationally
[mobile **corporate** **profits**]{.mark}. In many cases, [**cutting**
the corporate tax rate does **not reduce revenue**; it may **increase**
it.]{.mark}]{.underline}

[[When **Ireland** cut its **corporate tax**, **revenue
increased**]{.underline}]{.mark}. Its corporate tax rate went from 40
percent in 1994 to 12.5 percent by 2003. Since 1993, Irish corporate tax
revenue as a share of the economy has increased by 75 percent (2.1
percentage points).

In 2023, Ireland raised about \$5,000 per person in corporate tax
revenue, more than double the OECD average.\[1\] Figure 1 shows that the
US only raised \$1,700 per person despite a much higher tax rate of 25.6
percent (federal plus state taxes). This is not exactly a fair
comparison because 60 percent of US business income is taxed under the
individual tax system. Adjusting for this difference, US corporate
revenues are still below Ireland's but likely above the OECD average.

Ireland's commitment to a low corporate tax rate and other
business-friendly policies have made it a haven for global businesses
looking to escape the high taxes worldwide. According to one estimate,
as much as 86 percent of Ireland's corporate tax revenue is paid by
foreign multinationals.

[Foreign investment has **brought** more than just **fiscal
benefits**;]{.underline} The Wall Street Journal reports that "around
15% of the Irish workforce is employed by just under 1,000 U.S.
companies," and OECD data show that over the past two decades, average
annual wages in Ireland have grown faster than the OECD average and more
than twice as fast as those in neighboring UK.

[The Irish story of **lower tax rates** and **higher revenue** is
**[consistent]{.mark}** [across]{.mark} [the]{.mark}
**[OECD]{.mark}**.]{.underline}

Figure 2 shows that the average OECD corporate tax revenue as a share of
GDP increased from 1.9 percent in 1981 to 3.6 percent in 2023.\[2\]
Revenue increased as the average corporate income tax rate across the
same countries was cut in half, falling from about 48 percent in the
early 1980s to 24 percent in 2023. There is also no consistent
relationship between individual country tax rates and revenue
collection.

Since 2017, when the US cut the corporate tax by 14 percentage points,
corporate tax revenue as a share of GDP has increased by 40 percent
(from 1.5 percent to 2.1 percent in 2023). Revenue per capita also
nearly doubled from \$870 to \$1,700.

The experience of Ireland, the United States, and the rest of the OECD
bloc confirms estimates that find [the top of [the]{.mark} corporate tax
[Laffer Curve]{.mark} [is in the mid-20]{.mark}]{.underline} [[percent
range]{.mark} and falling over time]{.underline}. [It's likely **lower**
for the most **economically sensitive industries**]{.underline}. Under
one optimistic scenario, Martin Sullivan shows how [a [15 percent **US
federal** **corporate tax rate**]{.mark}]{.underline} (about 20 percent
with state taxes) [[could be **close** to **revenue
neutral**]{.underline}]{.mark}. Policymakers should always set tax rates
below the peak revenue-maximizing rate.

Claim: TCJA Exploded the Deficit

Some critics have also asserted that TCJA decimated federal revenues and
exploded the deficit. The best way to address this fiscal fallacy is to
start by setting the facts straight about the tax environment after TCJA
was implemented. [In]{.underline} fiscal year [2022, [federal
receipts]{.mark} were]{.underline} equal to [**19 percent**
of]{.underline} the aggregate [economic output]{.underline} of our
Nation, [the [second highest since World War II]{.mark}]{.underline}.
Between fiscal year 2017 (pre-TCJA) and fiscal year 2022,
[[corporate]{.mark} income tax [payments rose]{.mark}]{.underline} from
\$297 billion to \$425 billion, an increase of **[[43
percent]{.underline}]{.mark}**. Personal [[income tax]{.mark}
collections rose]{.underline} from \$1.6 trillion in 2017 to \$2.6
trillion in 2022, an increase of **[[66]{.mark} percent]{.underline}**.
Over that same five-year period, inflation was 20 percent (with the
lion's share of the increase occurring in 2021 and 2022), so these
[revenues]{.underline} to the federal government [grew]{.underline} much
[faster than inflation]{.underline}.

To compare spending with revenues, [federal
[outlays]{.mark}]{.underline} between fiscal year 2017 and fiscal year
2022 **[[grew]{.underline}]{.mark}** from \$4 trillion to \$6.3 trillion
over that same five-year period. According to the CBO's latest 10-year
Budget and Economic Outlook, [spending]{.underline} for the next 10
years [will]{.underline} continue to [be]{.underline} in the 23 percent
[[to **24 percent** of GDP]{.underline}]{.mark} range, far in excess of
the 20.3 percent it averaged in the 50 years before the pandemic. Such a
[sustained]{.underline} and dramatic increase in [spending]{.underline}
during a time of low unemployment and moderate economic growth [will be
inflationary]{.underline}. Running large budget deficits to fund more
subsidies for housing, energy, and higher education will just cause
prices to rise even further. That is why Larry Summers characterized the
economic policies of this administration as "the least responsible
macroeconomic policies we've had in the last 40 years" (Bloomberg,
2021). These facts also should make one thing clear in any discussion of
deficits: [The]{.underline} federal [[government has a **spending
problem**]{.mark}, not a revenue problem]{.underline}.

#### Blaming [revenue]{.underline} instead of [spending]{.underline} is a [misdiagnosis]{.underline}.

Myth No. 6: The tax cuts caused the federal budget deficit.

Democrats and many Republicans rightly worried that the Tax Cuts and
Jobs Act would contribute unnecessarily to the national debt. However,
[claims]{.underline} that [the tax cuts are responsible for]{.underline}
the federal government's [poor fiscal health are a **misdiagnosis** of
trends]{.underline} that are [**decades** in the making]{.underline}.

The [[TCJA]{.underline}]{.mark} did increase the budget deficit, but the
law [[is **not** the]{.underline}]{.mark} underlying [[cause of
the]{.mark} unsustainable]{.underline} U.S. [[budget]{.mark}.
The]{.underline} systemic [[gap]{.underline}]{.mark} between revenues
and expenditures [[is driven by]{.mark} sustained [growth
in]{.mark}]{.underline} mandatory **[[spending]{.underline}]{.mark}**
programs [[since the]{.mark} 19**[70s]{.mark}**]{.underline}.

[[Repealing]{.mark} the]{.underline} 2017 tax [cuts [would **not**
change the]{.mark} trajectory of]{.underline} increasing federal budget
[[deficits]{.underline}]{.mark}. The tax cuts (even if made permanent)
represent only about 16% of the pre-pandemic budget deficit, and [[one
year's]{.mark} projected [deficit]{.mark}]{.underline} in 2030 [[is
**larger** than the **entire** 10-year]{.mark} cost of the
**[T]{.mark}**]{.underline}ax **[[C]{.underline}]{.mark}**uts and
**[[J]{.underline}]{.mark}**obs **[[A]{.underline}]{.mark}**ct as
passed.

The 2017 [tax cuts]{.underline} represented critical structural reforms
to the U.S. tax code that will [need to be made
**permanent**]{.underline} in the coming years. Setting the record
straight on the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act is crucial to ensuring Congress
chooses to keep taxes low and make the 2017 reforms permanent.

[Reversing the]{.underline} tax [cuts]{.underline} based on a

Policy Center. 2/2024.
taxpolicycenter.org/briefing-book/how-did-tcja-affect-federal-budget-outlook

Dynamic estimates

JCT's original dynamic [score found]{.underline} that [the [TCJA would
**boost** economic activity]{.mark}]{.underline} (not the annual rate of
growth) by an average of about 0.7 percent over the budget window. That
[growth would [**reduce** the deficit]{.mark} impact
[by]{.mark}]{.underline} about [\$[385 billion]{.mark}]{.underline}---a
\$451 billion boost to revenues, partly offset by \$66 billion more in
spending for higher interest rates. Including macroeconomic effects,
TCJA would thus [increase the deficit by]{.underline} slightly [**less**
than]{.underline} \$1.[[1 trillion over a
**decade**]{.underline}]{.mark}. CBO's 2018 update increased that figure
to about \$1.4 trillion.

Debt service costs

To finance TCJA's tax cuts, the government will issue additional
Treasury securities and pay additional debt service. Including that
spending, the deficit effects of TCJA are larger. CBO's 2018 update, for
example, puts the conventional deficit increase from TCJA at almost
\$2.3 trillion over its first decade. The corresponding dynamic score is
a \$1.9 trillion increase.

Expiring provisions

To satisfy budget process requirements, lawmakers decided to sunset some
provisions of the TCJA. Most cuts to individual income taxes, for
example, expire at the end of 2025. Business expensing for new
investment is also temporary. As conventionally scored, the act thus
increased deficits from 2018 through 2026 and decreased them thereafter.
[[If lawmakers]{.underline}]{.mark} decide to [[extend]{.mark}
**all**]{.underline} the [expiring provisions]{.underline}, however,
[[that will add]{.underline}]{.mark} about [**\$[480 billion]{.mark}**
to deficits]{.underline} through 2027 and a growing amount thereafter.

### AT: Deficits\-\--No Impact\-\--2AC

#### Debt is [not]{.underline} a problem. Other countries are [dependent]{.underline} on lending to us. 

Mark **Blyth 23**. David Scharfenberg interview with Mark Blyth,
Professor of Political Economy at Brown University. "The federal deficit
doesn\'t matter, says economist Mark Blyth."
https://www.bostonglobe.com/2023/10/30/opinion/budget-deficit-federal-debt-mark-blyth-brown-university/

The deficit reached \$2 trillion this year --- double what it was a year
ago. Don't we have to rein it in at some point?

So the argument about this is, 'Oh, look at the financing costs.
Interest rates have gone up. When it was zero, this didn't cost anything
to roll over. And now it costs a fortune.' There's certainly something
in this, but there's also a bit of sleight of hand in these arguments.
It's not as if the entire federal debt stock becomes the same interest
rate overnight. The vast majority of the debt stock is not at the
current peak interest rate of just under 5 percent. So that's a bit of a
scare tactic to start with.

[[Should we be concerned]{.mark}?]{.underline} One way of looking at it
is, [you're going to be spending that money on interest payments and you
could be spending on something else]{.underline}. The **[[chances
are]{.underline}]{.mark}**, though, [we **don't spend** on something
else.]{.underline} [We just [give it away]{.mark} in the **next
[round]{.mark}** [of **tax cuts**]{.mark}, particularly if the
Republicans get in.]{.underline} I mean, the hypocrisy on this is
astonishing. They're screaming about deficits, and the first thing
they'll do when they come in is have tax cuts. And those [tax cuts lead
to bigger deficits]{.underline}. That's exactly what happened under
Donald Trump.

One argument you hear is: The economy is pretty good now. If you're
going to reduce the deficit, now is the time. Do you buy that?

Well, I would if we filled the gap by taxing people that pay absolutely
no tax --- such as our billionaire class. But it's just another argument
for, 'therefore we can't invest in education, therefore we can't invest
in decarbonization, therefore we must cut it back to the essentials.'
And those essentials tend to conform to the preferences of conservative
Republicans.

So we can just go on forever with deficit spending?

Look, here's the deal[. At the end of the day we [built]{.mark} a [world
economy]{.mark}, and you've got to think of this globally.]{.underline}
When there are too many exporters, they have to sell to the importers.
[**We are the [biggest importer]{.mark}**. The only way that they can
actually offload all the stuff they make is to accept
dollars.]{.underline}

They don't use dollars in their domestic system, so they give them to
the central bank, and the central bank turns them into Treasury bills.
[That lowers our **[long-term interest rates]{.mark}**, [gives
us]{.mark} more [consumption power]{.mark}, and we buy more of their
exports]{.underline}. [If **[we actually]{.mark}** **[balance the
books]{.mark}**, the [**economies** of **China**, **Japan**, and
**Germany** **would explode**]{.mark}, because there will be [**nobody
to buy** the **massive amount of stuff** that they **produce**]{.mark}
that [their own **economies** couldn't **possibly
absorb**.]{.mark}]{.underline}

Now, if you think of the world that way, the [[deficit]{.mark} is a
[sign]{.mark} that [people]{.mark} either want to]{.underline} --- [or
have to --- [hold our **currency** and our
**debt**]{.mark}]{.underline}. If that is the case, **[[there's no
alternative]{.underline}]{.mark}**. You're not going to hold Chinese
bonds. You're not going to hold crypto. It's too volatile. It's run by
crooks. So we have a structural advantage.

Now, if you want to spend all your time [[fretting about]{.mark} an
accountancy thing called the size of the [deficit]{.mark}]{.underline}
--- when you look at us as a company, like a balance sheet --- go ahead.
I think **[it's [nonsensical]{.mark}.]{.underline}**

So we're exempt from the economic rules that govern the rest of the
planet?

Look, if you're [a normal country]{.underline}, you [have a thing called
the "**current account constraint**."]{.underline} Over the long term,
you have to export to balance your imports, right? And if you've got a
soft currency, one that isn't regarded as a savings asset, then all
these things matter. [The size of your deficit really
matters.]{.underline}

[[If]{.mark} you are the **[global financial hegemon]{.mark}**, you just
[**don't have these constraints**.]{.mark}]{.underline}

It's very similar to bringing the household analogy into the austerity
debate. Trying to say the United States is just like any other country,
and it has to "live within its means" --- either you don't know what
you're talking about or you're mendacious.

### AT: Deficits\-\--No Impact\-\--1AR

#### Debt is [irrelevant]{.underline} to the [economic climate]{.underline} and [policymaking]{.underline}.

Georgia. "Why the \$22 trillion national debt doesn't matter -- here's
what you should worry about instead."

With another round of anxiety-causing debt-ceiling debates likely to
return in the coming months, like other economists, I believe it is
[[worth asking]{.mark} whether we should **even [care about]{.mark} the
size of [government debt]{.mark}**]{.underline}[.]{.mark}

Default isn't imminent

[First of all, it's important to note current U.S. debt levels do [not
indicate]{.mark} any risk of [imminent
default]{.mark}]{.underline}[.]{.mark}

As long as the U.S. federal government remains an "ongoing concern" --
[[fiscal institutions are strong]{.mark} and effective, [taxing
authority is maintained]{.mark} and the long-run [productive
capacity]{.mark} of the nation's economy [is secure]{.mark} -- there is
no economic reason to fear default on the nation's debt]{.underline}.
Political reasons, such as debt-ceiling mischief, are another matter.

To remain solvent and ultimately pay what it owes, the [U.S. Treasury --
which sells notes and bonds to investors to raise money to finance the
budget deficit -- needs only to balance its books over the long run,
rather than over an arbitrary unit of time like a year.]{.underline}

[Historically low interest rates on government debt suggest that [bond
market participants agree with this view]{.mark} and are not afraid of a
sovereign debt default in the U.S]{.underline}. Indeed, with these low
rates, **[[sufficient economic growth]{.mark} can [allow]{.mark} the
government to [borrow indefinitely]{.mark}.]{.underline}**

**[Why [it's irrelevant]{.mark}]{.underline}**

Although \$22 trillion is a large number, it is [essentially irrelevant
to proper thinking about the economic role of the U.S. government or
about responsible fiscal policy.]{.underline}

Government debt simply reflects the timing of taxes. Higher spending
levels today require more borrowing -- and a larger debt -- as long as
the taxes needed to pay for those expenditures are pushed into the
future.

But [regardless of when taxes are collected, what ultimately matters is
the quantity of the economy's scarce resources the federal government
commands and controls, and how those resources are used,]{.underline}
which essentially depend on the level and composition of government
spending. To paraphrase Milton Friedman, spending is taxing.

In short, [**[government debt]{.mark} can be a [bad indicator of]{.mark}
the stance of [fiscal policy]{.mark}** [or]{.mark} its burden on the
[private sector]{.mark}. The government can be wildly intrusive in the
economy and thus a hindrance to growth and welfare even if its debt is
low.]{.underline} For example, Venezuela's sovereign debt was only 23
percent of its GDP in 2017, yet its economy has been in turmoil for
several years.

[Or it [can]{.mark} effectively [manage spending to promote
welfare]{.mark} even if its debt is high. In 1945, the U.S. debt-to-GDP
ratio was 120 percent]{.underline}, immediately after the government
mobilized the economy to win World War II.

[**High debt [should not prevent]{.mark} the government from [spending
on worthwhile public endeavors]{.mark}**[.]{.mark}]{.underline} And [low
debt does not prove that the level or composition of government spending
is appropriate]{.underline}.

#### Debt is [no problem.]{.underline} The recent spike is [because the economy is strong]{.underline}.

https://www.brookings.edu/articles/no-need-to-panic-about-the-budget-deficit/

[The U.S. [budget deficit]{.mark} is on track to be much bigger this
year than last]{.underline}. Interest rates---a big issue given the
level of the federal debt--have risen notably in recent months. And the
U.S. faces long-run fiscal challenges associated with population aging
that will require tax increases and spending cuts. But **[there is [no
reason to panic]{.mark}]{.underline}**. [The rise in the
deficit]{.underline} this year isn't because of a sudden surge in
spending---it [**mostly reflects** a fall in **revenues** from
**unusually** high **levels last year**]{.underline}. As for interest
rates, it is too soon to know whether the recent increases will persist,
and if so, why. [If the [recent increase]{.mark} in rates is temporary,
or if **[reflects]{.mark}** an [increase in **expected GDP
growth**]{.mark}, then it will [not affect]{.mark} the
**[sustainability]{.mark}** of the **federal debt**.]{.underline}

[The deficit over the first 11 months of fiscal year 2023]{.underline}
(from October 2022 to August 2023) [was]{.underline} \$1.5 trillion, [up
\$600 billion from last year]{.underline}. As a share of GDP, the
deficit has increased from around 3.8% in the first 11 months of 2022 to
5.7% this year. (Measuring the deficit as a share of GDP adjusts for
inflation and, more broadly, shows the deficit in comparison to a
measure of the nation's ability to finance it.)

Meaningful comparisons between this year's deficit and last year's
require an adjustment for the rise and fall of President Biden's student
loan forgiveness plan. In September 2022, CBO increased its estimates of
federal outlays for fiscal year 2022 to reflect the cost of the loan
forgiveness (which was calculated as the present value of the loan
repayments that would have been forgiven under the Biden plan.) Then the
Supreme Court ruled the plan was unconstitutional. So, in August 2023,
CBO recorded a reduction in outlays in FY 2023 essentially reversing its
previous accounting. That reduction in outlays sharply reduces this
year's deficit. Excluding this outlay reduction, the deficit in the
first 11 months of FY 2023 is actually 7% of GDP---almost twice as large
as in the same period in FY 2022.

What has caused the deficit to increase this year?

As can be seen in the table below, [the main cause of the increase in
the deficit is lower revenues in FY 2023 compared to FY
2022]{.underline}. Non-interest outlays (excluding the effects of
student loan forgiveness) have been, on net, unchanged as a share of
GDP, while interest costs have increased. I discuss each of these in
turn.

Federal Budget This Year vs Last

Lower revenues

Revenues as a share of GDP were 2.7 percentage points lower in the first
11 months of FY 2023 than the same period last year. While the data to
parse the sources of the decline are not yet available, the following
factors are likely the most important:

[[Lower capital gains]{.mark} than last year [because]{.mark} of the
**performance** of the **[stock market]{.mark}**.]{.underline}

[Higher-than-normal [tax collections last]{.mark} year because of the
**[lag]{.mark}** in the **[indexation]{.mark}** of the tax **[brackets
for inflation]{.mark}**.]{.underline}

Unexpectedly high (and potentially fraudulent) take-up of the employee
retention credit.

The tax filing extension until October 16, because of severe weather,
provided to most California residents and business for taxes otherwise
due between January and September of 2023.

And, possibly, people choosing to minimize estimated tax payments given
high interest rates.

The first two factors explain why [tax revenues are down this year from
last year's unusually high level.]{.underline} The figure below shows
individual and corporate income tax collections as a share of GDP
through July 2023 (I use S&P's estimate of monthly GDP to make these
calculations). Tax receipts in 2023 have been about in line with their
longer-run averages---it is 2021 and 2022 that were unusual.

Corporate and Individual Income Tax Receipts as a Share of GDP (12-month
rolling average)

Furthermore, some (but not most) of the recent weakness will be made up
in October, when the California tax filing extension expires. The IRS
has also announced a moratorium on making payments on the employee
retention credit, as many of the claims appear to be fraudulent. In any
case, this credit was a one-time pandemic program and has no impact on
tax liabilities beyond 2021, so it won't be a source of weakness for
much longer.

Non-interest outlays

Non-interest outlays (adjusted for student loans) as a share of GDP over
the first 11 months of FY 2023 were unchanged from the FY 2022 level.
But, given that some pandemic-era spending---notably, the expanded child
tax credit---ended in 2022, why didn't outlays decline?

As shown in the table above, spending on pandemic-related programs did
decline, reducing outlays as a share of GDP by 1.3 percentage points.
However, this decline was offset by an increase in other outlays.

Spending on Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid edged up as a share
of GDP, reflecting the ongoing retirement of the baby boomers as well as
decreased recoveries of advance Medicare payments made during the
pandemic. (See the box below for a discussion of the effects of
inflation on spending as a share of GDP.) But other spending increased
more. Much of this increase is either temporary or one-time---including
an increase in FDIC spending related to the bank failures in spring 2023
(money which the FDIC expects to largely recoup), a decrease in spectrum
auction proceeds, and an increase in outlays owing to the Employee
Retention Tax Credit discussed above.

Interest on the debt

Net interest payments as a share of GDP increased 0.4 percentage
point---reflecting higher interest rates on the debt. If these higher
rates are the result of inflation, then, as discussed in the box, they
do raise the deficit---but that rise in the deficit doesn't end up
increasing the level of debt relative to GDP.

[What does the recent increase in real interest rates imply for the
federal debt trajectory?]{.underline}

[Real interest rates have increased sharply in recent
months]{.underline}. The most recent reading from the Federal Reserve
Bank of Cleveland (which uses a variety of measures of inflation
expectations to calculate real rates) shows that the real interest rate
on the 10-year Treasury was 1.7% in September---much higher than in the
recent past.

Does this mean that the era of low interest rates is over---and does it
mean that we should worry a lot more about the federal debt? Maybe, but
it is much too soon to tell.

[First---given the unusual economic conditions since the beginning of
the pandemic, it is way [too soon to know whether]{.mark} **these higher
[real rates will persist]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Second, even if they do
persist, [it matters why **rates have increased**]{.underline}. If
[rates have increased [because]{.mark} **[productivity
growth]{.mark}**]{.underline} has increased---for example, in response
to AI---[then such an [increase]{.mark} will also be [**neutral**
for]{.mark} the **[fiscal outlook]{.mark}**]{.underline}, as shown in
the equation in the box. If real rates have increased for other
reasons---increasing worries about the fiscal trajectory, or the Fitch
Ratings downgrade of the U.S. debt, for example, then it is possible
that we will look back on this recent rise in rates as a turning point.

But CBO has long assumed that real interest rates would rise over time.
For example, in their economic projections published this summer, they
assume that, in 2025, once inflation is back to its pre-pandemic level,
the real rate on 10-year Treasuries will be 1.6 percent---just a little
lower than the most recent reading from the Cleveland Fed. That means
that the recent rise in rates, even if it were to persist, would have
only small effects on CBO's long-run budget projections---projections on
which most budget analysts rely, and which do show that we are on an
unsustainable course.

Of course, for those who believed that interest rates would rise less
than what CBO was projecting and felt more sanguine about the fiscal
trajectory because of that belief, the recent rise in rates might be a
reason to worry more. But there is still too much uncertainty to
conclude that the fiscal outlook has materially changed because of
higher interest rates.

Real 10-Year Treasury Interest Rate

How does higher inflation affect the budget?

Some commentators have pointed to inflation as a factor boosting the
deficit. And while **[inflation]{.underline}** does increase the dollar
value of the deficit, it [lowers the ratio of debt to GDP, the **key
metric** of fiscal **sustainability.**]{.underline} [In other
words,]{.underline} **[[high inflation]{.mark} is [good]{.mark} [for the
federal budget]{.mark}]{.underline}**.

To see why, we need to get just a bit wonky. The change in the ratio of
debt to GDP from one year to the next is equal to the primary deficit
(revenues less non-interest spending) plus the debt to GDP ratio
multiplied by the difference between the nominal interest rate paid on
the debt less the nominal growth rate of GDP:

inflation equation

What does an increase in inflation do? First, it reduces the primary
deficit as a share of GDP somewhat, because GDP rises with inflation,
whereas not all federal expenditures do. For example, Medicare payments
to physicians are fixed in nominal terms and don't rise with inflation.
So the first term in the equation falls a bit when inflation increases.

[Second, a rise in inflation raises the interest rate actually paid on
federal debt by less than it raises the growth rate of nominal GDP,
because not all federal debt is rolled over every
year]{.underline}---that is, [the federal
[government]{.mark}]{.underline} [[locked in **lower interest
rates**]{.mark} in the [**past** on **some of its
debt**]{.mark}**.**]{.underline} A rise in interest rates due to higher
inflation does raise interest payments and the deficit as a share of GDP
because some debt is issued at the higher rates, but it lowers the debt
to GDP ratio. (If all debt were continually rolled over, a rise in
interest rates due to higher inflation would have no effect on the debt
to GDP ratio even as it raised the deficit relative to GDP.)

#### Even [significantly higher debt]{.underline} wouldn't matter. 

Tim **Fernholz 23**. Reporter, Quartz. "There is no US debt crisis."
https://qz.com/there-is-no-us-debt-crisis-1850013109

Republicans in Congress are threatening once again to force the US to
default because they lack the votes to enact their preferred fiscal
vision.

Yes, it's debt ceiling season once again. For those not following along
at home, US law imposes an arbitrary limit on the amount of money the
government is allowed to borrow. Historically, this was intended to make
borrowing easier. Today, it is a tool for brinksmanship, with
Republicans threatening to block paying the bills they already voted to
incur unless GOP demands for unspecific spending cuts are met.

Right now, the US is at the limit, and the Treasury Department is moving
money around to delay a conflict until later in the year. But if the
limit is not raised, the US faces a constitutional crisis: How can the
president execute the laws set by Congress if those laws are
contradictory? (Here's a flow chart for your consideration.)

The last time a real debt ceiling face-off happened in 2011, the US had
its sovereign debt rating downgraded and incurred more than a billion
dollars in economic losses. So let's set aside the hypocrisy and
political posturing and ask a simpler question: [[Is there]{.mark} a
**[debt crisis]{.mark}** that would justify holding the **economy**
**hostage**?]{.underline}

And the answer is no. [[Markets]{.mark} are **[not worried]{.mark}**
about the **US paying its debts**, and there are [**no** **bond
vigilantes**]{.mark} appearing out of the **woodwork**.]{.underline}

That's because [the US is an [enormously **wealthy nation**]{.mark} with
a **[growing economy]{.mark}**]{.underline}. The US has a lot of debt,
about \$22 trillion, equal to about an entire year's economic
production. But the US also has a lot of wealth---about \$137 trillion
(pdf). It's true that interest rates are rising, but only because the
Federal Reserve is pushing them up. Investors are still betting that
rates will fall soon, with the interest paid on ten-year Treasury bonds
lower than on government debt due in two years. That yield curve
inversion reflects expectations that the Fed will cut rates during a
potential recession. But even absent a downturn, the Fed isn't likely to
hike more than expected next year thanks to slowing inflation.

Public debt is stabilizing. How do you shrink it?

And what's the trend for federal public debt? After a huge surge driven
by pandemic-driven public spending, [[borrowing]{.mark} is set to
[**shrink** as a **share** of the **economy**]{.mark} in the years
ahead.]{.underline} These Congressional Budget Office forecasts are from
May 2022, and don't include changes from legislation like the Inflation
Reduction Act or updated economic data, but the figures do offer a best
guess at what we can expect:

Many policymakers and economists fret that publicly-held debt
approaching 100% of annual GDP is too high. [The "correct" level of debt
is difficult to assess; researchers think too much debt can be a drag on
growth]{.underline}, but only if it crowds out private spending or leads
to higher interest rates. **[[The global economy]{.underline}]{.mark}**,
however, [is]{.underline} in many ways **[[dependent]{.mark} on a
[steady supply of US debt]{.mark}]{.underline}**. Perhaps the biggest
reason to push down current borrowing is to make sure the US has the
fiscal capacity to weather the next emergency. One thing that won't help
reduce the debt, however, is a financial crisis caused by debt ceiling
brinksmanship.

Despite the Fed's tightening, [[**growth** remains **strong**]{.mark}
and unemployment is low]{.underline}. That's arguably a good environment
to reduce government spending after the enormous surge in pandemic aid.
Spending is already falling faster, as a share of the economy, than it
did after the 2008 recession.

[There are ways to keep driving spending down]{.underline} (pdf), [but
they require delivering pain to somebody: **[Eliminating
subsidies]{.mark}** to everyone]{.underline}, [from]{.underline}
**[agribusiness]{.underline}** [to]{.underline}
**[defense]{.underline}** contractors, [leads to lobbyists for affected
industries pounding down lawmakers' doors, while cutting benefits to
children, the sick or the poor **[remains broadly
unpopular]{.mark}**]{.underline}. [Tax hikes can be more palatable but
can **generate political repercussions** among influential upper class
voters.]{.underline}

The last time anyone tried to hash out a compromise on all of this---the
2011 glory days of the Bowles-Simpson commission---Republicans backed
out because of proposed tax increases, and Congress wound up cutting
spending 10% across the board. (Republicans reversed many of the cuts
when President Donald Trump took office in 2017.)

[[America]{.mark} [experienced a **manufacturing boom** powered
by]{.mark} the **[pro-growth]{.mark}** **[2017]{.mark} [tax
reforms]{.mark}**]{.underline}. [Policies like 100 percent bonus
depreciation and increased small business expensing allowed
[manufacturers]{.mark} to **[expand]{.mark} operations**]{.underline}
[[and]{.mark} [lowered]{.mark} the [cost]{.mark} [of]{.mark} investing
in [new]{.mark}]{.underline} equipment, vehicles, and
[[facilities]{.underline}]{.mark}. As a result, manufacturers bought
new, more productive equipment manned by new employees [driving
**domestic investment** and **economic** growth above all projections
under]{.underline} President [Trump]{.underline}. In the long-term,
investment in the United States is expected to rise by 7.4 percent as a
direct result of the Trump tax cuts.

Ways and Means Committee Chairman Jason Smith (MO-08) issued a statement
touting the need to support American manufacturing through extension of
the Trump tax cuts:

"President **[Trump's]{.underline}** [tax]{.underline} and trade
[agenda]{.underline} [[made]{.mark} American [**manufacturers**
**strong**]{.mark} and **prosperous again**.]{.underline} Instead of
allowing Communist China to steal our jobs, President Trump stood up for
American workers. His [tax cuts]{.underline} were fuel for
[investments]{.underline} into all kinds of communities and helped
create more blue-collar jobs that support working families. Conversely,
President Biden has been a disaster for working men and women. In the
last year, the nation actually lost 61,000 manufacturing jobs. In
roundtables held by Ways and Means Tax Teams across the country,
manufacturers have urged Congress to renew the Trump tax cuts and give
America's job creators the certainty to build, invest, and grow in
America."

[[A **stronger**]{.mark} **[manufacturing]{.mark} [base]{.mark}** [pays
dividends in the **global economic**]{.mark} **[competition]{.mark}**
[with]{.mark} foreign competitors like [China]{.mark}]{.underline}. Too
many American communities have seen the pain caused by the shuttering of
a factory and loss of stable, good-paying jobs. [By **attracting**
**investment** to **distressed** **areas** of]{.underline} [the country,
the 2017 Trump tax cuts helped reverse this decades-long
trend]{.underline} and finally gave help and hope to communities and
workers.

[[If Congress does not act]{.mark}, **[manufacturers]{.mark}** [will

First, [geopolitically, the rise of a more **powerful and [assertive
China]{.mark}**]{.underline}[, [as well as]{.underline}]{.mark} [the
resurgence of a **far more [aggressive Russia]{.mark}**]{.underline} (as
we are witnessing with Putin's egregious and illegal invasion of
Ukraine), [[is creating a **shift** in]{.mark} the **global [balance of
power]{.mark}**]{.underline} [and challenging the post-World War II
rules-based order]{.underline} that has been the foundation of
international relations for more than 75 years. [Authoritarian
regimes]{.underline} in Moscow and Beijing [are [posing]{.mark} new
[threats]{.mark}]{.underline} to their neighbors and [[to]{.underline}
**[peace and stability]{.underline}**]{.mark} [in **Europe** and the
**Indo-Pacific**]{.underline}. Here [in the United States, we are
experiencing a]{.underline} profound [shift of strategic
focus]{.underline} from the post-9/11 wars of the Middle East
(Afghanistan, Iraq, and global counterterrorism operations) [to the
increasingly urgent imperative to deter and defeat aggression
[by]{.mark} these **[nuclear-armed]{.mark}** strategic
[competitors]{.mark}.]{.underline}

Looking into the longer-term future, [the coming decades will be shaped
**most profoundly**]{.underline} [by a **multidimensional, [strategic
competition]{.mark}**]{.underline} [with China]{.underline} \-- [one
[that has]{.mark}]{.underline} political,
**[[economic]{.underline}]{.mark}**, [military]{.underline},
**[[technological]{.underline}]{.mark}** [and ideological
[dimensions]{.mark}]{.underline} as well as enormous stakes for the
prosperity and security of the United States and our allies and
partners.

Second, we are experiencing a period of profound \-- perhaps
unprecedented \-- technological disruption. The accelerating development
and adoption of technologies like artificial intelligence, 5G, synthetic
biology, quantum computing, hypersonics, robotics and autonomy, among
others, will transform not only how we live and work but also how
militaries fight in the future. Consequently, U.S. forces cannot rest on
their laurels and assume that they will remain the best fighting force
in the world if they simply implement the current program and budget.
**[[Keeping the]{.mark} U.S. [tech]{.mark}nological
[edge]{.mark}]{.underline}** [[and]{.underline} **[military
advantage]{.underline}**]{.mark} [in the future [will require]{.mark}
adopting **[new]{.mark} cutting-edge
[capabilities]{.mark}**]{.underline} [and]{.underline} **[new
operational concepts]{.underline}** [with much greater **speed and
scale**]{.underline}. In short, [we are in a]{.underline}
military-**[technological race with China]{.underline}**, [and what we
do in next [**five years** will]{.mark} do much to [determine whether we
can **successfully deter and defeat**]{.mark} **their
[aggression]{.mark}**]{.underline} [over the next 50.]{.underline}

Third, we cannot ignore the increasingly urgent existential threat posed
by climate change. The international community is running out of time to
make major changes to both reduce carbon emissions and adapt to
inevitable changes in temperature and the environment. Addressing this
challenge will require unprecedented degrees of international
cooperation, including between the two largest emitters of greenhouse
gases, the United States and China.

Fourth, all of this is happening at a time when U.S. global leadership
has been called into question by events of the past several years. The
unpredictability and isolationist tendencies of President Trump created
significant uncertainty among allies and partners who depend on the
United States as a vital security partner, from Asia to the Middle East
to Europe. On top of that, the deep polarization of our society and the
January 6 insurrection have shaken confidence in our democracy in some
quarters and fueled concerns that we are too internally preoccupied and
divided to lead internationally. Just watch the nightly news in Beijing
and you will hear a persistent (if erroneous) narrative of irreversible
U.S. decline.

In this context, U.S. defense policy must focus first and foremost on
deterring aggression by nuclear-armed great powers, focusing on China as
the pacing challenge, but not forgetting the importance of deterring
further Russian aggression in Europe.

[With regard to China]{.underline}, [the name of the game is
**[out-competing]{.mark}**]{.underline} China without spiraling into
crisis and armed conflict. This is easier said than done for several
reasons. First, Beijing believes its own narrative of U.S. decline,
which in turn risks creating overconfidence and more room for
miscalculation. Second, Beijing has had a head start. President Xi has
been focused on this competition since he came into office, has
consistently made strategic investments in key technologies, in the
Peoples Liberation Army, and in extending Chinese influence overseas
(from the Belt and Road Initiative to dominating multilateral forums on
technology standards setting).

In addition, since the first Gulf War, the People's Liberation Army
(PLA) has gone to school on the American way of war and developed an
expanding set of asymmetric approaches to undermine U.S. military
strengths and exploit U.S. vulnerabilities, including robust
antiaccess/area denial (A2/AD) capabilities designed to disrupt and
destroy U.S. networks and thwart U.S. power projection into the
Indo-Pacific region. As a result, the U.S. military can no longer assume
that it will have the freedom of action that early superiority in the
air, space, cyber and maritime domains would allow. U.S. forces will
need to fight to gain advantage across these domains---and then to keep
it---in the face of continuous PLA efforts to disrupt and degrade U.S.
battle management networks. This will require fundamental changes in how
we deter and fight.

[Overall, I]{.underline} would [**commend** the broad China strategy
that the]{.underline} Biden [administration has laid out thus
far]{.underline}, [which [emphasizes]{.mark}]{.underline}: 1)
**[[investing in the drivers of American competitiveness]{.mark} here
[at home]{.mark}]{.underline}**; and 2) strengthening cooperation with
allies and partners abroad who share our interests and, in many cases,
our values. The latter can be seen in recent efforts to revitalize and
operationalize the Quad (comprised of the United States, Japan,
Australia, and India), launch the AUKUS initiative, build a more aligned
approach with Europe regarding China, deepen bilateral ties with key
allies and partners in the Indo-Pacific region, and show up arm in arm
at key international policy and standards-setting forums.

https://www.markle.org/sites/default/files/Chapter-13-Baird-Equitable-Economic-Recovery.pdf

Broadly shared [[**economic prosperity** is a bedrock of]{.mark}
America's **[economic and political
strength]{.mark}**]{.underline}---[both **domestically** and in the
**international arena**. A **[strong]{.mark}**]{.underline} and
equitable [**[recovery]{.mark}** from the **economic crisis** created by
COVID]{.underline}-19 [[would be a]{.mark} powerful [testament
to]{.mark} the **[resilience of the American system]{.mark}** and its
ability to create **prosperity** at a time of]{.underline} seismic
change and persistent global **[crisis]{.underline}**. Such a
[**recovery** could attack]{.underline} the profound economic
[inequities]{.underline} that have developed over the past several
decades. [Without bold action to help]{.underline} all [**workers**
access good **jobs**]{.underline} as the economy returns, [the United
States risks undermining the legitimacy of its institutions and its
**international standing**. The [outcome will be a key determinant
of]{.mark} America's **[national security]{.mark}**]{.underline} for
years to come.

An equitable [recovery requires a national commitment to]{.underline}
help all workers obtain good **[jobs]{.underline}**---particularly the
twothirds of adults without a bachelor's degree and people of color who
have been most affected by the crisis and were denied opportunity before
it. As the nation engages in a historic debate about how to accelerate
economic recovery, [**ambitious public investment is necessary** to put
Americans back to work with dignity and opportunity]{.underline}. We
need an intentional effort to make sure that the jobs that come back are
good jobs with decent wages, benefits, and mobility and to empower
workers to access these opportunities in a profoundly changed labor
market.

To achieve these goals, [American [policy makers need]{.mark} to
establish **[job growth strategies]{.mark}**]{.underline} that address
urgent public needs through major programs [in]{.underline} green
energy, **[infrastructure, and health]{.underline}**. Alongside these
job growth strategies, [we need to]{.underline} recognize and
[develop]{.underline} the talents of workers by creating an adult
**[learning system]{.underline}** that meets workers' needs **[and
develops skills]{.underline}** for the digital economy. [The national
security community must lend its support to this cause]{.underline}. And
as it does so, it can bring home the lessons from the advances made in
these areas in other countries, particularly our European allies, and
consider this a realm of international cooperation and international
engagement.

[Shared [Economic Prosperity Is a **National Security
Asset**]{.mark}]{.underline}

[A strong economy is **essential** to America's **security** and
**diplomatic strategy**. Economic strength increases our **influence on
the global stage**, expands markets, and funds a strong]{.underline} and
[agile **military**]{.underline} and national defense. Yet it is not
enough for America's economy to be strong for some---prosperity must be
broadly shared. Widespread belief in the ability of the American
economic system to create **[economic security and
mobility]{.underline}** for all---the American Dream--- [[creates
**credibility** and **legitimacy** for]{.mark} America's values,
**[governance]{.mark}, and alliances** around the world.]{.underline}

After World War II, [the United States grew the middle
class]{.underline} to historic size and strength. This achievement made
America the model of the free world---[setting the stage for decades of
American **political and economic leadership**]{.underline}.

Domestically, [broad participation in the economy is core
to]{.underline} the [legitimacy]{.underline} of our democracy
[[and]{.mark} the [strength of]{.mark} our **[political
institutions]{.mark}**]{.underline}. A belief that the economic system
works for millions is an important part of creating trust in a
democratic government's ability to meet the needs of the people.

The COVID-19 Crisis Puts Millions of American Workers at Risk

For the last several decades, the American Dream has been on the wane.
Opportunity has been increasingly concentrated in the hands of a small
share of workers able to access the knowledge economy. Too many
Americans, particularly those without four-year degrees, experienced
stagnant wages, less stability, and fewer opportunities for advancement.

Since COVID-19 hit, millions have lost their jobs or income and are
struggling to meet their basic needs---including food, housing, and
medical care.1 The crisis has impacted sectors like hospitality,
leisure, and retail, which employ a large share of America's most
economically vulnerable workers, resulting in alarming disparities in
unemployment rates along education and racial lines. In August, the
unemployment rate for those with a high school degree or less was more
than double the rate for those with a bachelor's degree.2 Black and
Hispanic Americans are experiencing disproportionately high
unemployment, with the gulf widening as the crisis continues.3

The experience of the Great Recession shows that without intentional
effort to drive an inclusive recovery, inequality may get worse: while
workers with a high school education or less experienced the majority of
job losses, nearly all new jobs went to workers with postsecondary
education. Inequalities across racial lines also increased as workers of
color worked in the hardest-hit sectors and were slower to recover
earnings and income than White workers.4

The Case for an Inclusive Recovery

A recovery that promotes broad economic participation, renewed
opportunity, and equity will strengthen American moral and political
authority around the world. It will send a strong message about the
strength and resilience of democratic government and the American
people's ability to adapt to a changing global economic landscape.

An inclusive [**[recovery will reaffirm American leadership]{.mark}** as
core to the success of our most critical international
alliances]{.underline}, which are rooted in the notion of shared destiny
and interdependence. For example, [NATO]{.underline}, which has been a
cornerstone of U.S. foreign policy and a force of global stability for
decades, has suffered from American disengagement in recent years. **[A
strong American recovery]{.underline}**---coupled with a renewed
openness to international collaboration---[is core to NATO's ability to
solve **shared geopolitical and security challenges**]{.underline}. A
[renewed partnership]{.underline} with our European allies [**from a
position of economic strength** will [enable us to address global crises
such as **climate change,** ]{.mark}**global [pandemics, and
refugees]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Together, [the United States and Europe
can [pursue]{.mark} a commitment to]{.underline} investing in workers
for shared economic **[[competitiveness]{.underline}]{.mark}**,
innovation, [and long-term prosperity]{.underline}.

### \-\--Tax Cuts Key\-\--1AR

#### Tax cuts are key to [long-term]{.underline} investments in [innovative industries]{.underline}. 

Marley **Brocker 24**. Market Analyst at IBIS World, an Australian
Consulting Firm. \"Tax Cuts and Fiscal Stability: Decoding Trump's 2025
Economic Agenda.\" IBIS World. 12-18-2024.
https://www.ibisworld.com/blog/trump-taxes/Manufacturing

[An extension of [the]{.mark}]{.underline} Tax Cuts and Jobs Act
(**[[TCJA]{.underline}]{.mark}**) [would [benefit
**manufacturers**]{.mark} primarily]{.underline} [because it provides
[a]{.mark} **more [favorable tax environment]{.mark}**]{.underline}. The
TCJA lowered the corporate tax rate to 21.0%, offered a 20.0%
pass-through deduction and boosted the estate tax exemption threshold.
[Extending these measures will **reduce** tax
**liabilities**]{.underline}, allowing manufacturers to reinvest savings
into their businesses, [**drive growth** and maintain **global
competitiveness**]{.underline}. [Over 92.0% of **domestic**
**manufacturers** have supported **maintaining** or **lowering the
corporate rate**]{.underline}. [[Reducing]{.mark} corporate [tax
rates]{.mark}]{.underline} to 15.0% for companies producing goods
[domestically could significantly **[boost]{.mark} [manufacturers\'
profit]{.mark}**]{.underline} by allowing them to retain more earnings
for reinvestment. [This incentive [encourages **manufacturers** to
**expand**]{.mark} **operations** within the US, leading to **expanding
[domestic production]{.mark}** and **potential job
creation**]{.underline}. [An influx of additional capital could also
[drive investments in]{.mark} **[new tech]{.mark}nologies** [and
**infrastructure**]{.mark}, enhancing efficiency and
competitiveness.]{.underline}

How manufacturers can expense research and development
([R&D]{.underline}) costs [will]{.underline} also likely [be
addressed]{.underline}. Currently, businesses must spread R&D costs over
several years rather than deducting the full amount of those expenses
immediately. Bipartisan support leans toward changing the rules back to
allow immediate expensing of R&D costs, as it makes investing in
innovation more affordable and encourages businesses to spend more on
R&D. While a reversal in this policy would add to the cost of tax cuts,
[**[restoring]{.mark}** immediate **[expensing]{.mark}** for **R&D
costs** [would]{.mark} **[reduce]{.mark} manufacturers\' [tax
burdens]{.mark}**]{.underline}, [[freeing up **cashflow** to]{.mark}
[**reinvest** in **innovation**]{.mark}.]{.underline} [[This]{.mark}
change [would]{.mark} [encourage]{.mark} product **development**,
strengthen **[competitiveness]{.mark}** and **secure financial
certainty** for **long-term investments**.]{.underline}

#### Key to competitiveness and manufacturing

**NAM 24**. \"Preserve Tax Reform's Pro-Growth International Tax
System.\" National Association of Manufacturers. 11-20-2024.
<https://nam.org/preserve-tax-reforms-pro-growth-international-tax-system-32687/>

[The]{.underline} international tax system put in place by [[2017 tax
reform]{.underline}]{.mark} [[bolsters]{.mark} American
**[competitiveness]{.mark}** [and]{.mark} **[supports]{.mark}**
**[manufacturing]{.mark}** in the U.S.]{.underline}---and that's why its
provisions must be preserved, according to a new policy explainer, part
of the NAM's Manufacturing Wins campaign.

The background: [Before passage of the Tax Cuts and Jobs
Act]{.underline}, the U.S. tax code made it more costly and less
efficient to invest in the U.S. Corporate [profits were taxed at the 35%
corporate income tax rate when repatriated to the U.S.,]{.underline}
[forcing **businesses** to **keep revenues abroad**.]{.underline}

[[Tax reform]{.mark} [instituted a **new**, **pro-growth international
tax** regime that]{.mark} **[incentivizes]{.mark}** **companies** to
locate their operations, **[intellectual property]{.mark}** and profits
**here** [in the U.S.]{.mark}]{.underline}

The specifics: Tax reform's international tax provisions include the
following:

A 21% corporate tax rate: Tax reform reduced the corporate rate from 35%
to 21%, making "the U.S. a more attractive home for manufacturing
investment."

The Foreign-Derived Intangible Income deduction: This deduction "reduces
taxes for companies that locate job-creating, export-producing
intellectual property in the U.S."

The Global Intangible Low-Taxed Income regime: The GILTI regime imposes
a U.S. minimum tax on income earned abroad in low-tax jurisdictions.

The Base Erosion and Anti-Abuse Tax: The BEAT applies to certain
payments that shift companies' profits abroad.

Why it's important: Globally engaged manufacturers face the possibility
of significant tax increases at the end of 2025 as key international tax
provisions are scheduled to change.

The FDII deduction will decrease, while the effective GILTI and BEAT tax
rates will both increase---upsetting the balance inherent in the TCJA
international tax structure and thus making it more costly and difficult
for globally engaged companies to operate here in the U.S.

What's next: In addition to maintaining or reducing the 21% corporate
tax rate, the NAM is calling on Congress to prevent the FDII decrease
and the GILTI and BEAT tax increases on [manufacturers]{.underline}
whose success [bolsters]{.underline} [America's competitiveness on the
world stage.]{.underline}

The last word: "**[[Congress]{.underline}]{.mark}** [[must sustain **tax
reform's**]{.mark} international tax system,]{.underline} [including the
**[lower]{.mark} corporate [tax rate]{.mark}**]{.underline}, [in order
[to enhance]{.mark} America's **[competitiveness]{.mark}** and
**support** **manufacturers'**]{.underline} efforts [to]{.underline}
create jobs and [grow]{.underline} [investment here in the
U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates," said NAM Vice President of
Domestic Policy Charles Crain.

#### Failure to extend tax cuts crush manufacturing.

Demand Chain Executive, 1-14-25. "Failure to Renew Trump Tax Reforms
Could Cost 6M Manufacturing Jobs,"
https://www.sdcexec.com/sourcing-procurement/manufacturing/news/22930567/national-association-of-manufacturers-failure-to-renew-trump-tax-reforms-could-cost-6m-manufacturing-jobs

[[Failing to preserve **pro-manufacturing tax** **policies** from the
2017 tax reform will cost]{.mark} the U.S. economy nearly [6 million
jobs and]{.mark}]{.underline} would [cost the U.S. economy [more than
\$1 **trillion**,]{.mark} according to a study]{.underline} released by
the National Association of Manufacturers (NAM).

And, the **[[manufacturing]{.underline}]{.mark}** industry [[will **bear
the brunt**]{.mark} of this economic damage]{.underline} if Congress
does not act swiftly in 2025.

"The time to act is now. Millions of [American workers are depending on
the manufacturing sector to continue driving America forward," says NAM
president and CEO Jay Timmons]{.underline}. ["[Pro-growth tax policies
from]{.underline}]{.mark} President [[Trump's]{.underline}]{.mark} 2017
tax [[reforms were **rocket fuel for
manufacturers**]{.underline}]{.mark} [and [made the U.S. **economy**
more **competitive** on a **global scale**]{.mark}]{.underline}.
Manufacturers kept our promises to create jobs, raise wages and benefits
and invest in our community. By acting now, policymakers can choose
economic growth over economic disaster and protect American livelihoods.

"This data---6 million American jobs at stake---makes crystal clear that
preserving tax reform should be one of the first acts of the new
Congress and the new administration. If Congress delays, manufacturers
will be forced to delay investment and job creation decisions due to the
uncertain outlook. In 2017, Congress passed the landmark Tax Cuts and
Jobs Act late in the year, meaning that manufacturers' investment
decisions based on the law could not bear fruit until 2018 at the
earliest. For example, manufacturing capital spending grew 4.5% and 5.7%
in 2018 and 2019, respectively, compared to the meager 1.4% growth in
2017. In addition, manufacturers added 267,000 new jobs in 2018, the
best year for job creation in manufacturing in 21 years," adds Timmons.

"This time around, we can't afford to wait: with crucial TCJA provisions
having expired in recent years, the economy is already backsliding.
Following the expiration of immediate R&D expensing in 2022, R&D growth
in the EU surpassed the U.S. for the first time in nearly a decade---and
China's R&D growth tripled our own. Congress and President Trump should
work expeditiously to stimulate activity this year by acting urgently to
give manufacturers the tax certainty they need to plan for long-term,
job-creating projects," he adds.

"[[Small **manufacturers** are **disproportionately**
**impacted**]{.mark} by tax increases]{.underline}," says Ketchie
president and owner Courtney Silver, outgoing chair of the NAM's Small
and Medium Manufacturers Group. "We're already struggling thanks to the
expiration of immediate R&D expensing, full expensing for capital
equipment purchases and interest deductibility for job-creating
projects. Congress should reverse these expirations and prevent even
more devastating changes to the pass-through deduction, the estate tax
and more from taking effect next year."

### \-\--AT: No Manufacturing Impact\-\--1AR

#### Manufacturing's necessary to deter [adversaries]{.underline} and prevent [war]{.underline} from erupting.

Having a **[[strong manufacturing]{.underline}]{.mark}** base [is

security]{.mark}** of the U.S. Without]{.underline} the [domestic
capability]{.underline} to produce goods, [especially in **strategic

**defend itself**]{.underline}]{.mark} to the same degree it could if it
had a strong and self-sufficient manufacturing industry. [Other
strategic industries]{.underline}, such as critical infrastructure and
advanced technologies, similarly [**rely** on]{.underline} a
[strong]{.underline} domestic [manufacturing]{.underline} base, because
it gives them more economic stability and security.

Dean [Schneider]{.underline}, interim [director of]{.underline}
the [SecureAmerica Institute ]{.underline}as [part of]{.underline}
the [Texas A&M Engineering]{.underline} Experiment Station,
[says]{.underline} the **[[d]{.underline}]{.mark}**efense
**[[i]{.underline}]{.mark}**ndustrial **[[b]{.underline}]{.mark}**ase['s
[ability to **manufacture**]{.mark}]{.underline} and field advanced
weapon systems [to maintain]{.underline} the [U.S.'s **superiority**
over]{.underline} potential [adversaries [is]{.mark}]{.underline} the
very [[basis of]{.underline}]{.mark} the [country's **[national
security]{.mark}**]{.underline} interests. "Not only does the defense
sector manufacture these systems, but our [military]{.underline} forces
also **[rely on]{.underline}** all the [non-defense]{.underline}
specific [products that are **manufactured**]{.underline}, such as food,
clothing, and other consumer goods that are necessary for their
support," Schneider explains. "[It is our
**[tech]{.mark}**]{.underline}nological
[**[advantage]{.mark}**---created by]{.underline} the
[manufacturing]{.underline} sector---[that [allows]{.mark} the [U.S.
to]{.mark}]{.underline} effectively [**[counter adversaries]{.mark}**
with]{.underline} significant size [advantages. **[Deterrence
works]{.mark}**]{.underline}. It also allows us to compete effectively
in long-term struggles."

On the other hand, he says, a [[weak manufacturing]{.underline}]{.mark}
sector **[[magnifies]{.underline}]{.mark}** the
[[threat]{.underline}]{.mark} that [an adversary]{.underline} with a
significant industrial base or the source of raw materials that we need
[would **[not]{.mark} feel [deterred]{.mark}** [by]{.mark}]{.underline}
the [U.S.'s industrial [capabilities]{.mark}. In **national
defense**]{.underline}, national security, and beyond, a [strong
manufacturing]{.underline} sector [is **vital**]{.underline}. One way to
ensure the sector remains strong is to invest in cutting-edge
technologies to keep manufacturing resilient, efficient, and secure. 

Role of Tech in Creating a Strong Manufacturing Sector

Lieutenant Commander Tim [Gorman, spokesperson for]{.underline}
the [Office of]{.underline} the [Secretary of Defense]{.underline}, says
the DoD's (Dept. of Defense's) interest in the advanced manufacturing
workforce is grounded in the mission of ensuring the technological
superiority and readiness of U.S. military forces. "DoD investment in
advanced manufacturing helps secure the DIB (defense industrial base),
including cutting-edge research and development, robust and resilient
regional manufacturing ecosystems, and an appropriately skilled
workforce," Gorman says. "A wide range of new and fast-evolving
technologies and applications, such as counter-space weapons, hypersonic
weapons, quantum science, and biotechnology have the potential not just
to change kinetic conflict but also to disrupt day-to-day U.S. supply
chain and logistics operations."

Simultaneously, Gorman [says [advances in
**manufacturing**]{.mark}]{.underline} technologies and processes
[[enable]{.underline}]{.mark} the [[econ]{.mark}omy [to continuously
grow]{.mark}]{.underline} as new materials and innovations increase
productivity and sustainability, [increase U.S.
**competitiveness**]{.underline}, and create U.S. jobs to support
entirely new industries. "The [[(DoD) cannot
realize]{.underline}]{.mark} the value of [its]{.underline} far-reaching
[[investments]{.underline}]{.mark} in technological innovation
[[without]{.underline}]{.mark} a ready and [**capable
[workforce]{.mark}** to bring these technologies into production **at
scale**]{.underline}," he adds. "Building and sustaining the DIB
includes collaboration with the private sector and international
partners in the defense ecosystem to maximize our logistical systems and
guard our relevant supply chains against subversion and compromise."

Tom Kurfess, executive director of the Georgia Tech Manufacturing
Institute and professor at the Georgia Institute of Technology, says
manufacturing permeates everything in the country, so if the U.S. cannot
make enough parts for systems for the DoD, then it has a security
problem. "If we have a strong manufacturing sector, then we are capable
of making the goods that we need. If we do not, then we rely on other
countries for such goods," Kurfess explains. "If we need something and
we cannot make it, we have a problem. The nuance here is that it is not
just about needing cars or planes or combat aircraft or tanks, but it is
about making or having access to all of the components---from the
engines to the nuts and bolts to the chips that are in each of these
systems. So, it links to the entire supply chain."

Technological innovations can make manufacturing and the supply chain
much more flexible and resilient. For example, Kurfess points to 3D
printing as an example of a technology that could help make a variety of
components that in the past required specialized machines, and even
things like castings. Digitalization in supply chain is also important.

"From a supply chain perspective, identifying multiple plants or
companies that can manufacture a variety of components is a great option
that can be used to expand the production basis for the nation," Kurfess
says. "For example, if we need 1,000 components tomorrow, we might have
one big plant that can supply these components. However, if we had a
group of 100 digitally connected smaller plants that could supply 10
parts per plant, we could rapidly create the 1,000 parts needed. These
plants would have to be digitally connected to the supply chain, in what
one might call a 'hyperconnected supply chain'. The advantage of this is
that if the one big plant has a fire, flood damage, or goes down due to
COVID, the parts will not be made. If one of the smaller plants is taken
down, there are still 99 other plants that can deliver parts, so you
have a much more resilient supply chain."

**endanger**]{.underline} the security of [the U.S. or its
allies]{.underline} and partners. "[National defense
requires]{.underline} that our [warfighters have]{.underline} the
[equipment they need to do their job at **any time** and at **any
place**]{.underline}," Melkote says. "During times of conflict or
crises, [[reliance on]{.underline}]{.mark} the **[[global
manufacturing]{.underline}]{.mark}** supply chain [[can be
**unreliable** and **negatively impact**]{.mark} the [ability]{.mark}
of]{.underline} our [defense agencies [to respond]{.mark}
to]{.underline} the [conflict in]{.underline} a [**timely** and
**effective manner**]{.underline}."

Therefore, a technologically strong, vibrant, and resilient
[manufacturing]{.underline} sector [is **critical** for
meeting]{.underline} the [defense needs of a nation]{.underline}, in
addition to [ensuring]{.underline} its [economic security]{.underline}.
"Technological innovation enabled by basic and applied research and
development in STEM (science, technology, engineering, and math) fields
is key to ensuring technological superiority of the U.S.'s defense
capabilities," Melkote explains. "This is true for [all industry
sectors]{.underline} that our defense capabilities rely on, including
transportation of all kinds, munitions, energy, food production, etc.
All these industry sectors in turn [require]{.underline} advanced
[**manufacturing** capabilities that]{.underline} can [enable them to
produce and supply]{.underline} on-demand the [goods and
services]{.underline} required by U.S. defense agencies."
