[**[exploration]{.underline}** [is **defined** as discovery

knowledge that can be used by those not yet born to answer questions not
yet posed at the time of the exploration. This new knowledge may also
have immediate beneficial applications in answering the needs of
contemporary ocean scientists, natural resource managers, educators, and
industries.\"

#### Development requires the installation of [infrastructure]{.underline}.

The impact analysis assumes that in **[areas]{.underline}** more [likely
to be developed]{.underline} (as defined in the RFD scenario**)**,
[various types of development could **occur** **after lands are
conveyed**]{.underline} (e.g., mining, minerals extraction, ROWs, and
recreation). [Any type of **[development]{.mark}** [could include
**construction**]{.mark} or **expansion [of infrastructure]{.mark}**
[that may include]{.mark} **[roads]{.mark}**]{.underline},
**[trails]{.underline}**, [**[pipelines]{.underline}**,
**[buildings]{.underline}**]{.mark} [[or]{.underline}]{.mark}
**[[structures]{.underline}]{.mark}**, increased traffic, offhighway
vehicle (OHV) use[,]{.underline} increased human noise and activity, the
potential for air and dust emissions, and water withdrawals or
wastewater discharge. [For the impact analysis]{.underline},
[[the]{.mark} **[term development]{.mark}** [refers to **changes** to
the **land due** to the]{.mark} [**installation** of
**infrastructure**]{.mark} **or associated activities** listed
above]{.underline}. The impact analysis also assumes that impacts from
development on Federal land may be less than those on State or ANC land
because Federal land management stipulations are typically more
stringent than State guidelines.

#### That requires a [permanent]{.underline} structure.

"**[[Infrastructure]{.underline}]{.mark}**" [is **[permanent
structures]{.mark}**]{.underline} for transportation, sewer and water
facilities, schools, parks, greenways and open space, electric and gas
delivery systems, stormwater facilities and telecommunications networks.

#### 2. Violation. The plan is [not exploration]{.underline} since it does not involve data collection, and is [not development]{.underline} since icebreakers are not permanent infrastructure. 

#### 3. Prefer our interpretation:

#### A. Limits. Requiring the aff to be [infrastructure]{.underline} prevents the topic from turning into "do anything" in the Arctic. That [explodes]{.underline} the topic to include temporary actions like [military patrols]{.underline} or [increased shipping]{.underline} in the Arctic. 

#### B. Ground. [Core neg arguments]{.underline} like foreign threat perception DAs, [politics]{.underline}, environment DAs, and the [capitalism]{.underline} K depend on [a permanent commitment]{.underline} to the Arctic. 

#### 4. Topicality is a voting issue. Use competing interpretations to [evaluate]{.underline} it. If we win that our interpretation is [better]{.underline} for debate, you should [vote neg]{.underline}. 

### Interp\-\--Development is Infrastructure\-\--2NC/1NR

#### Development refers to the [conversion]{.underline} of land and infrastructure accompanying it.

Urban development not only causes habitat loss and fragmentation, but it
also contributes to habitat degradation through storm water runoff and
nonpoint source pollution. [The term]{.underline}
"**[[development]{.underline}]{.mark}**" [[refers to]{.mark}
urbanization of the landscape, including]{.underline} (but not limited
to) [[land conversion for **residential**,]{.mark} [**commercial**, and
**industrial uses**]{.mark} [and the accompanying
**infrastructure**.]{.mark}]{.underline} Urbanization effects may
include alterations to water quality, water quantity, and instream and
streamside habitat (Ren et al. 2003, p. 649; Wilson 2015, p. 424). The
effects on habitat also include variability in streamflow, typically
increasing the extent and volume of water entering a stream after a
storm and decreasing the time it takes for the water to travel over the
land before entering the stream (Giddings et al. 2009, p. 1). Freshwater
mussel populations experience reduced abundance, species richness,
reproduction, growth, and survival stemming from the impacts of
urbanization on water and habitat quality (Diamond and Serveiss 2001, p.
4716; Gangloff et al. 2009, p. 198; Cao et al. 2013, pp. 1212--1214;
Gillis et al. 2017, pp. 674--679). While there are some parts of both
the Chipola slabshell's range and the fat threeridge's range that are
affected by urbanization, it does not rise to the level that it is
affecting current viability (see Current Conditions below).

#### Development is the [provision]{.underline} of [infrastructure]{.underline}.

3.2.2 Although these categories have been developed in the context of
Development Plans they are considered to provide a transparent basis on
which to also screen policies in the LTP3. [In this case **[the
term]{.mark} [development]{.mark}** [refers to the **provision**
of]{.mark}]{.underline} transport related
[**[infrastructure]{.mark}**.]{.underline}

### Interp\-\--Infrastructure Definitions\-\--2NC/1NR

#### Infrastructure includes a variety of [permanent]{.underline} structures. 

**Holland & Knight 22**. Corporate Law Firm. Buy American and Beyond:

On November 15, 2021, President **[Biden]{.underline}** [signed the
Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act]{.underline} into law. The Act
requires every U.S. federal agency, within 180 days of enactment (May
14, 2022), to impose a domestic preference requirement for every
"infrastructure project" that receives federal funding.

 [The term]{.underline} "**[[infrastructure]{.underline}]{.mark}**"
[[is defined to include]{.mark},]{.underline} at a minimum: (1)
**[[roads, highways, and]{.mark} [bridges]{.mark}]{.underline}**; (2)
[public transportation]{.underline}; (3) [[dams, **ports**,
**harbors**]{.mark}, [and]{.mark} other **[maritime]{.mark}

[The term \"**[infrastructure]{.mark}**\" is [**defined** to
mean:]{.mark}]{.underline}

\"a[. [Any **fixed** **capital expenditure**]{.mark} or **fixed**
capital outlay [associated with]{.mark} the construction,
reconstruction, or **improvement** of **[public
facilities]{.mark}**]{.underline} that have a life expectancy of 5 or
more years and any land acquisition, land improvement, design, and
engineering costs related thereto.

#### Infrastructure is [public]{.underline} services and facilities.

**Alameda 22**. Alameda Local Agency Formation Commission. \"Glossary Of
Terms.\" 2022. https://alamedalafco.org/glossary-of-terms/

Infrastructure Needs and Deficiencies

The term, "**[[infrastructure]{.underline}]{.mark}**" [is [defined as
**public services**]{.mark} [and **facilities**]{.mark}]{.underline},
[[such as **sewage-disposal**]{.mark} **systems**,
**[water]{.mark}**-supply **systems**, [other **utility** systems, and
**roads**]{.mark}]{.underline} (General Plan Guidelines). Any area
needing or planned for service must have the infrastructure necessary to
support the provision of those services. The term, "infrastructure needs
and deficiencies," refer to the status of existing and planned
infrastructure and its relationship to the quality and levels of service
that can or need to be provided.

### Interp\-\--Exploration is Data\-\--2NC/1NR

#### Exploration requires [systematic collection]{.underline} of [information]{.underline}.

Definition

[[**Exploration** involves a]{.mark} **journey** or [activity
**undertaken for the purpose** of]{.mark} **[discovery]{.mark}**---that
is finding something new.]{.underline}

The line between exploration and other forms of travel is not
straightforward. For a start, not everyone who discovers something
intends to do so. Nor are all journeys that set out to find something
new successful. Even when they do discover something, it might not be
what they expected (Weaver, 2015).

[Geographical [exploration is]{.mark} also [about]{.mark} communication.
[**Systematically** **recording**]{.mark} your journey in **some way**
[and **sharing**]{.mark} this **[information]{.mark}** [with
others]{.mark} is often **considered** [a key **differential** between
**exploration** and other **forms of travel.**]{.mark}]{.underline} Risk
and uncertainty are also important in separating exploration from
fieldwork or tourism. But there are several different ways of
conceptualizing exploration and its history, and this chapter will
discuss these.

## Aff Answers

### AT: Topicality\-\--2AC

#### 1. We meet. Constructing icebreakers requires [permanent]{.underline} infrastructure. 

#### 2. Counter-interpretation. "Exploration" refers to [early activity]{.underline} in a [remote area]{.underline}. 

Gerald **Graham 81**. The Freedom of Scientific Research in
International Law: Outer Space, the Antarctic and the Oceans. Ph.D.
Thesis No. 332, Université de Genève, 1981.

\(E\) [[The Meaning of **the Term**]{.underline}
\'**[Exploration]{.underline}**]{.mark} and Exploitation\'

\(1\) Outer Space

The 1967 Treaty\'s title is "Treaty on Principles Governing the Activity
of States in the Exploration and Use of Outer Space, including the Moon
and other Celestial Bodies". One is tempted to argue that the term
"exploration and use", which appears in the 1962 Principles1 which
preceded the 1967 Treaty as well as in the body of the latter, is an
adaptation of the concept of exploration and exploitation included in
the Continental Shelf Convention. [But, as shall be shown
below]{.underline}, [in that Convention the concept [may refer to
**applied research**]{.mark}]{.underline}[,]{.mark} something it is
doubtful the Outer Space Treaty was meant to convey. [An alternative,
**plausible interpretation** is that the word
**[\'exploration]{.mark}\'** alone [has]{.mark} [a **very particular
meaning**]{.mark}]{.underline} [--- [namely, the **initial**,
**exploratory phase of** **discovery** which **characterises early
activity in any remote area**.]{.mark}]{.underline}

#### And, "development" means to make something more advanced. That [includes]{.underline} making [natural resources]{.underline} more [available.]{.underline} 

J. Woodfin **Jones 12**. Chief Justice; Texas Court of Appeals Third
District. \"Wynne v. Klein, 2012 Tex. App. LEXIS 9156.\" 10-31-2012.

Tex. Const. art. XVI, § 59(a). HN4 In construing \[\*7\] a provision of
the Texas Constitution, [it is our duty to ascertain]{.underline} [and
give effect to [the **plain intent**]{.mark}]{.underline} [and language
of its framers and of the **people who adopted it**]{.underline}. Gragg
v. Cayuga Indep. Sch. Dist., 539 S.W.2d 861, 865-66 (Tex. 1976) (citing
Deason v. Orange Cnty. Water Control & Improvement Dist. No. 1, 151 Tex.
29, 244 S.W.2d 981, 984 (1952)). HN5 Section 59(a) specifies the
purposes for which water control and improvement districts may be
organized. [One of those **[expressly stated]{.mark}** purposes [is
\"**development**]{.mark}\"]{.underline} of the waters of the State\'s
rivers and streams for \"power.\" [[The term \"development\" is defined
as \"to **bring out**]{.mark} [the **capabilities** or]{.mark}
[**possibilities** of;]{.mark} [bring to a more **advanced** or
**effective state**]{.mark}]{.underline},\" Random House Dictionary of
the English Language 543 (2d ed. 1987), [[and]{.mark} more
**specifically** [with **respect** to]{.mark} **natural
[resources]{.mark}** \"[to make]{.mark} actually [**available** or
**useable**]{.mark}]{.underline} ([[something]{.mark} [previously only
**potentially**]{.mark} **available** or
**[useable]{.mark}**]{.underline}) [including [the]{.mark} natural
[resources of the region]{.mark}]{.underline},\" Webster\'s Third New
Int\'l Dictionary 618 (2002). Thus, a plain reading of the provision
contemplates that a conservation and reclamation district such as the
LCRA may use the State\'s waters to aid, promote, or facilitate the
generation of \[\*8\] power. While Wynne contends that the term
\"power\" should be read to be limited to hydroelectric power, the
provision itself contains no such limitation. Moreover, production of
power by means other than hydroelectric generation falls squarely within
the expressly permitted \"other useful purposes\" to which the State\'s
water may be put---i.e., providing power for use by the State\'s
citizens.

#### 3. Prefer our interpretation.

#### A. [Predictability]{.underline}. Our interpretation is a [court decision]{.underline} capturing the [plain intent]{.underline} of development in the [context]{.underline} of [exploiting]{.underline} resources in a [region]{.underline}. 

#### B. [Aff ground]{.underline}. They overlimit. The US [can't]{.underline} explore or develop the Arctic without [icebreakers]{.underline}.

**[[Icebreakers]{.underline}]{.mark}** [[are]{.underline}]{.mark} seen
as [**[indispensable]{.underline}** [for **maintaining** a **presence**
in the **Arctic**]{.underline}]{.mark}[.]{.underline} Even as global
temperatures warm and open up shipping lanes, [[the

**[months]{.mark}**]{.underline}---unless accompanied by a Polar class
icebreaker.

Greenland, the world's largest island, is still treacherous to
circumnavigate by ship because of the ice conditions. The island has one
of the world's largest undeveloped zinc deposits in its far north, but
the fjord where it is located is icebound almost all of the year.

"[[**We can't access** the **region**]{.mark} and we can't have a
**presence** [without **icebreakers**]{.mark}]{.underline}[,"]{.mark}
said Shannon Jenkins, a senior Arctic policy adviser at the U.S. Coast
Guard, which operates U.S. icebreakers.

#### 4. Functional limits solve. The neg is [guaranteed]{.underline} perception links to threat perception DAs, region tradeoff DAs, and links to critiques of engagement in the Arctic.

#### 5. Use reasonability to evaluate topicality. Vote AFF if our topic is [debatable]{.underline}. Competing interpretation causes [substance crowd-out]{.underline} and a [race to the bottom]{.underline}. 

### C/I\-\--Development = Commercial\-\--2AC/1AR

#### "Development" refers to activity undertaken for a [commercial purpose]{.underline}. 

Franklin S. **Billings 84**. Justice on the United States District
Court, Vermont. \"In re Baptist Fellowship of Randolph, 144 Vt. 636.\"
LexisNexis. 8-3-1984.

The sole issue on appeal is whether the Church building is a
\"development\" under Act 250. Under 10 V.S.A. § 6001 (3) HN3
**[[development is defined as:]{.underline}]{.mark}**

[the **construction** of **[improvements]{.mark}** on a
**tract**]{.underline} or tracts **[of land]{.underline}**, [owned by or
controlled by a person]{.underline}, involving more than 10 acres of
land within a radius of five miles of any point on any involved land,
[**[for]{.underline}** ***[commercial]{.underline}*** [or
industrial]{.underline} ***[purposes]{.underline}***]{.mark}. (Emphasis
added.)

Pursuant to 10 V.S.A. § 6025, HN4 [[the State]{.underline}]{.mark} has
adopted certain rules to assist in the interpretation and administration
of Act 250. Environmental Board Rule 2(L) [[defines **commercial
purpose**]{.underline}]{.mark}, as used in 10 V.S.A. § 6001 (3),
[as:]{.underline}

[the [provision of **facilities**]{.mark}, goods or services [by a

**others** [in exchange for payment of a]{.mark} **[purchase
price,]{.mark}** fee, **contribution**, **donation** or other **object
having value**.]{.underline}

CONCLUSIONS

[10 [V.S.A.]{.mark} 6001]{.underline}(3)(A)(ji) [[defines
**development** as the construction of **improvements for**]{.mark}
**[commercial purposes]{.mark}**]{.underline} on more than one acre of
land within a municipality that has not adopted permanent zoning and
subdivision bylaws. \"Construction of improvements\" is defined as \"any
physical action on a project site which initiates development.\" Act 250

### C/I\-\--Arctic Dev\-\--Broad Definition\-\--2AC/1AR

#### "Arctic Development" refers to the process of [transformation]{.underline} in the Arctic region. 

**SD 25**. Sustainability Directiory. \"Arctic Development → Term.\"
3-31-2025.
https://climate.sustainability-directory.com/term/arctic-development/

[The Definition of **[Arctic Development]{.mark}**]{.underline}, at its
most fundamental level, [[**signifies** the **process** of]{.mark}
Planned and Unplanned [**transformations** occurring within the **Arctic
region**]{.mark}]{.underline}[. [This]{.underline}]{.mark} [Explanation
[encompasses]{.mark} a]{.underline} broad spectrum [of
**[activities]{.mark}**]{.underline}, [[ranging from
**resource**]{.mark} **[extraction]{.mark}** and
**[infrastructure]{.mark} construction** to **[tourism]{.mark}** [and
the **evolution** of **indigenous
communities**]{.mark}**.**]{.underline} To provide a simple Description,
[it's about how humans are changing and interacting with the **Arctic
environment** and its **societies**.]{.underline} This Interpretation
often starts with understanding the basic elements that constitute the
Arctic itself → a geographically distinct area characterized by its
polar climate, unique ecosystems, and the presence of ice and
permafrost.

Arctic Development, in its simplest form, refers to the changes and
activities happening in the Arctic region driven by human actions.

### C/I\-\--Development = Material Change\-\--2AC/1AR

#### Development requires [materially changing land]{.underline}.

Appeals. \"Lee County v. Lippi, 693 So. 2d 686.\" Court Of Appeal Of
Florida. 5-9-1997.

Subsection 163.3164(11) defines \"land\" as \"the earth, water, and air,
above, below, or on the surface . . . \" and subsection 163.3164(22)
defines \"land development regulations\" as ordinances enacted for the
regulation of any aspect of \"development.\" [The term
\"[development]{.mark}\" [is]{.mark}]{.underline} defined in subsection
163.3164(5) as having \"the meaning given it in s. 380.04.\" Section
380.04(1) generally defines \"development\" as \"[the carrying out of
any building activity or mining operation, the [**making of any**
**material change** in the use or]{.mark} [**appearance** of any
**structure or land**]{.mark}]{.underline}, or the dividing of land into
three or more parcels.\" In HN2 section 380.04(3)(h), Florida Statutes
(1989), [the definition of development is narrowed]{.underline} [to
**exclude activity** as **follows**]{.underline}: \"[The following
operations or uses shall \[\*\*7\] not be taken for the purpose of this
chapter to involve \'development]{.underline}\' as defined in this
section: . . . . (h) [The **creation** or termination of **rights of
access**, riparian rights, easements, covenants concerning development
of land, or **other rights in land**.\"]{.underline}

#### Development is making [material change]{.underline} to land.

The planning legislation

19.Planning control is a creature of legislation. The main elements of
the statutory scheme remain the same as they were when first introduced
across England and Wales by the Town and Country Planning Act 1947. The
principal Act is now the Town and Country Planning Act 1990 (the "1990
Act"). By section 57 of the 1990 Act, planning permission is required
for the carrying out of any development of land. [[The term
"**development**]{.mark}" is [defined]{.mark} in section 55(1) t[o mean
"the **carrying** out of **building**, **engineering**, **mining** or
other **operations**]{.mark}]{.underline} [**[in]{.underline}**,]{.mark}
[on, over or under [land, or]{.mark} the [making]{.mark} of [any
**material change**]{.mark} **in the use** of any **buildings** or
**other land**]{.underline}". In this case we are concerned with the
former type of development (operational development) and not with change
in use.
