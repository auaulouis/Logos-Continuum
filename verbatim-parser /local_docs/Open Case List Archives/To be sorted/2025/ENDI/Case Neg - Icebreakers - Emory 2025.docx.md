[[The United States]{.mark}, [Canada and Finland]{.mark} have
[**agreed** to **coordinate**]{.mark} their development of **[new
icebreaking vessels]{.mark}**]{.underline}

At the NATO Washington summit in July, Canada, Finland and the United
States announced a collaboration on development of new icebreaking
ships. The Icebreaker Collaboration Effort, a non-binding agreement
colloquially known as the ICE Pact, will enable the three countries to
strengthen their shipbuilding industries through information sharing,
workforce development and procurement alignment. Arctic concerns are
growing in Washington, which published an updated strategy for the
region earlier this year.

What next

A joint memorandum of understanding that outlines a framework for
implementing the arrangement is expected to be signed before 2025, and
the Biden administration may push for this to happen ahead of next
month's US presidential election. The memorandum will also include a
mechanism for admitting other countries into the ICE Pact; Russian and
Chinese interest in the Arctic may encourage others to join.

Subsidiary Impacts

A bipartisan congressional group has asked the White House to prioritise
service to the Great Lakes region within the ICE Pact framework.

Quebec-based Davie, Canada's largest shipbuilder, has announced plans to
open a shipyard in the United States.

Last month, China sent its three vessels into the Arctic and announced
that it would fast track the construction of a fourth icebreaker.

Analysis

[The **[ICE Pact sends]{.mark}** [an **immediate signal**]{.mark} [to
**industry partners**]{.mark} that **Canada**, the **United States** and
**Finland** are [committed to **purchasing more
icebreakers**.]{.mark}]{.underline} [[Shipbuilders]{.mark} are
[responding by **investing** in **supply chains**]{.mark} [and
**shipyards** in]{.mark} **[anticipation]{.mark}** of **these
orders**]{.underline}, positioning themselves to earn procurement
contracts when public funding for new projects is made available.

The arrangement reflects NATO's awareness of the Arctic's growing
importance, particularly as Russia and China seek to assert their
presence in the region with icebreaker fleets of their own. [In the
medium-to-long term, collaborative workforce **[development]{.mark}**
and information sharing [will shorten the **timeline**]{.mark}
[for]{.mark} [icebreaker design and
**construction**]{.mark}]{.underline}, giving the ICE Pact partners an
opportunity to close the gap between the size of their fleets and that
of Russia, in particular.

#### 2. White House efforts in [other areas]{.underline} solve.

shipbuilding.\" Reuters. 4-9-2025.

WASHINGTON, April 10 (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald
**[[Trump]{.underline}]{.mark}** [signed an [executive order]{.mark} on
Wednesday [aimed at **reviving U.S. shipbuilding**]{.mark}]{.underline}
and reducing China\'s grip on the global shipping industry, [[vowing to
**boost funding**]{.mark} for the effort in **coming
years**.]{.underline}

[**Republican** and **Democratic** U.S. [lawmakers]{.mark} for years
have [warned about China\'s]{.mark} **[growing dominance]{.mark}** on
the seas [and **diminishing U.S. naval readiness**]{.mark}.]{.underline}

Senators Mark Kelly, a Democrat, and Todd Young, a Republican, welcomed
the executive order and said they would reintroduce their bipartisan
legislation to provide the congressional authorizations needed to
revitalize the industry.

The order directs the U.S. Trade Representative to move ahead with a
proposal that included levying million-dollar U.S. port docking fees on
any ship that is part of a fleet that includes Chinese-built or
Chinese-flagged vessels. Allies will be pushed to act similarly.

USTR\'s recommended port fees had sparked sharp criticism from
commodities exporters, trade groups and U.S. ship operators, who warned
of supply chain disruptions, job losses in port cities and inflation.
The order must be finalized by an April 17 deadline.

U.S. Trade Representative Jamieson Greer on Wednesday said USTR should
have a final decision on remedies by middle of the month and repeated
his comments from Tuesday, saying that not all of the measures outlined
by the agency\'s original proposal would be implemented.

\"This could have been a miscommunication issue, some people thought
that all of those measures would be imposed,\" Greer said. But after
feedback and public comments, \"now we consider which of those measures
is most appropriate.\"

The order also requires USTR to consider proposing tariffs on
ship-to-shore cranes manufactured, assembled, or made using components
of Chinese origin, or manufactured anywhere in the world by a company
owned, controlled, or substantially influenced by a Chinese citizen, as
well as tariffs on other cargo handling equipment.

The executive order further requires the Department of Homeland Security
to enforce collection of Harbor Maintenance Fees and other charges, and
to prevent cargo carriers from circumventing those fees by routing goods
to ports in Mexico and Canada and then sending cargo into the United
States via land borders.

Asked about the U.S. order on Thursday, China\'s foreign ministry said
the idea that China was to blame for the U.S. losing its competitive
advantage in the shipping industry had no basis in fact.

\"The development of China\'s shipbuilding industry is the result of
technological innovation and active participation in market competition
by enterprises,\" ministry spokesperson Lin Jian told a regular press
conference.

**[[Trump]{.underline}]{.mark}**, [speaking in the Oval
Office]{.underline}, [[said]{.mark} [the U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates
[would be spending \"a lot of]{.mark} **[money on
shipbuilding]{.mark}**\" [to **restore American** **capacity** in the
**sector**.]{.mark}]{.underline}

\"[We\'re **way, way, way behind**]{.underline},\" he told reporters.
\"[We used to build a ship a day, and]{.underline} [now we don\'t do a
ship a year]{.underline}, practically, and we have the capacity to do
it.\"

The order said recent data showed the United States built less than 1%
of commercial ships globally, while China built about half, an increase
from just 5% in 1999, according to the Center for Strategic and
International Studies.

[Trump\'s order called for creation of a Maritime Security Trust Fund to
provide [reliable]{.mark} [funding for programs aimed at **shoring up
U.S. maritime capacity**]{.mark}, **including**]{.underline}
consideration of potential new or existing tariff revenue, fines, fees,
or tax revenue.

It also calls for incentives to encourage private investment in
construction of commercial components, and improvements to shipyards,
repair facilities and dry docks.

[The **U.S. shipbuilding industry**]{.underline}, which peaked in the
1970s, [has struggled due to high costs and a complex regulatory
structure, which has **enabled rivals** including China to **grow
rapidly**.]{.underline}

\"Trilateral Pact Aims To Bolster Icebreaker Production.\" National
Defense. 10-23-2024.
https://www.nationaldefensemagazine.org/articles/2024/10/23/trilateral-pact-aims-to-bolster-icebreaker-production

[The recent announcement of a [collaborative agreement]{.mark} between
Finland, Canada and the United States]{.underline} [to build polar
icebreakers]{.underline} comes as China has declared itself a
"near-Arctic state" and Russia is operating the largest fleet of
icebreakers in the world, including the only ones that are
nuclear-powered.

But the pact [is]{.underline} as much [about **[bolstering allied
shipbuilding industries]{.mark}** as it is about addressing global
threats]{.underline}, [and all [**three nations** have something to
**gain**]{.mark}, experts said.]{.underline}

[The]{.underline} Icebreaker Collaboration Effort, or **[[ICE
Pact]{.underline}]{.mark}**, announced on the sidelines of NATO's 75th
anniversary summit in Washington, D.C., July 11, is a trilateral
agreement between the three nations to collaborate on the production of
polar icebreakers alongside allies and partners, labor and industry.

A statement from the White House announcing the agreement said the
collaboration i[s [intended to "strengthen]{.mark} the
**[shipbuilding]{.mark} industry** and **industrial capacity** of each
nation"]{.underline} and "build closer security and economic ties among
our countries through information exchange and mutual workforce
development focused on building polar icebreakers, as well as other
Arctic and polar capabilities."

The details of the agreement remain hazy, with a memorandum of
understanding promised "by the end of the year," but the statement said
the three governments intend to utilize shipyards in the United States,
Canada and Finland to "build polar icebreakers for their own use, as
well as to work closely with like-minded allies and partners to build
and export polar icebreakers for their needs at speed and affordable
cost."

U.S. National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan told reporters the day of
the announcement that the pact is about "enhancing the collective
capacity of our three countries to build icebreakers at a time when we
are seeing an increasing need for those icebreakers from partners around
the world who want to operate in both the Arctic and Antarctic regions."

[This "increasing need" puts **[added pressure]{.mark}** [on a **U.S.
shipbuilding industry**]{.mark} that is already a **weak link** in the
**country's** **defense industrial base**]{.underline}, [[suffering from
**delayed programs**]{.mark}, [maintenance]{.mark} **backlogs** and
[**workforce** and supply chain **shortages**]{.mark}, according to
government watchdogs.]{.underline}

The U.S. Coast Guard has only two operational polar icebreakers: the
heavy Polar Star and the medium Healy. Polar Star was commissioned in
1976 and Healy in 2000. Both the fleet's size and age create maintenance
vulnerabilities that could cut the fleet in half if one is out of
commission.

The service has been working to expand its fleet through the Polar
Security Cutter program, which has been "plagued by delays" and more
than doubled in cost, according to a report by the Congressional Budget
Office released in August.

An October Congressional Research Service report noted that the Coast
Guard needs eight or nine polar icebreakers, and the first of the new
ships is not likely to enter service until 2029. That raises questions
about what the United States will be able to deliver under the pact when
it is struggling to meet its own demand.

A letter to the White House signed Oct. 2 by Sen. Chris Murphy, D-Conn.,
chairman of the Senate Appropriations Subcommittee on Homeland Security,
Sen. Cindy Hyde-Smith, R-Miss., and Sen. Patty Murray, D-Wash., said a
reliable icebreaker fleet is "critical" to achieving strategic
objectives in the Arctic.

[The letter also said that [strengthening]{.mark} [the]{.mark}
shipbuilding industry of each [ICE Pact]{.mark} country and generating
"**good jobs at shipyards** and related businesses all over" [is]{.mark}
[the **aim** of the **partnership**]{.mark}]{.underline} --- especially
for advancing polar icebreaker recapitalization in the United States
that is "far too slow."

[**[Finland]{.mark}** [and **Canada**]{.mark} [can help, bringing to the
**agreement** a **history** of icebreaker design and **shipbuilding
experience**]{.mark}]{.underline}. Canada has the second largest
icebreaker fleet in the world behind Russia. Meanwhile, 60 percent of
the world's icebreakers are produced at Finnish shipyards and 80 percent
are designed by Finnish companies, according to the Finnish government.

A Canadian government release said the country's "world-class expertise
in Arctic and polar capabilities" will be "foundational" to the
agreement's success.

#### That enables the US to [rebuild]{.underline} the commercial shipbuilding industry.

A4: [The details of the ICE Pact will be clarified through]{.underline}
the eventual **[implementation]{.underline}** plan, which should be
designed to manage potential risks to the effectiveness of the
initiative. These considerations relate to the open question as to the
extent of allied demand, a lack of details on manufacturing capacity
growth, and the difficulty of coordinating the sequencing and
distribution of icebreaker production and delivery.

To generate impact, collaboration must account for best practices in
scaling production, including lessons in surge capacity. [[The **ICE
Pact**]{.mark} [endeavors to facilitate a **greater shipbuilding
workforce**]{.mark}]{.underline}[, [but]{.underline}]{.mark} [the

### AT: Shipbuilding\-\--Funding Fails\-\--2NC/1NR

#### Increased federal funding for shipbuilding won't rebuild the industry. 

David J. **Lynch 25**. Staff writer, MA in international relations from
Yale University. \"Trump Wants To Build More Ships In The United States.
It's Not So Simple.\" Washington Post. 3-23-2025.
https://archive.ph/5AN2Z#selection-537.0-537.73

President Donald [Trump]{.underline} [appears]{.underline} [set to
broaden his attack on global economic]{.underline} integration [by
imposing new multimillion-dollar fees on the **Chinese container
ships**]{.underline} that bring many foreign goods to U.S. shores.

The proposed fees are intended to counter what the administration
describes --- echoing its predecessor --- as unfair Chinese trade
practices that have given Beijing a chokehold on the construction of
commercial vessels.

Part of a broader White House strategy to revive U.S. shipbuilding, the
levies threaten the system of oceangoing trade that has developed over
the past quarter-century --- and could result in a repeat of the supply
chain disruptions the nation suffered during the pandemic.

By charging Chinese-owned or -built vessels each time they dock at a
U.S. port, the administration hopes to discourage ocean carriers from
buying more ships from China. [The U.S. government would spend some of
the tens of billions of dollars raised through the fees on subsidizing a
commercial **shipbuilding industry** that has fallen into
disrepair.]{.underline}

[Generous **government support**, including tax incentives, would enable
revitalized U.S. shipyards to fill orders that now go to facilities in
China]{.underline}, South Korea or Japan, according to the
administration. U.S. exporters also would be required to meet targets
for shipping their goods on U.S.-flagged vessels, rising from almost
nothing to 15 percent of the total in seven years.

But [**[maritime specialists]{.mark}** [call hopes for a]{.mark}
Lazarus-like [**revival** of U.S. **shipbuilding**]{.mark}
**[unrealistic]{.mark}**]{.underline}, [saying it would [require]{.mark}
**[decades]{.mark}** [of **consistent** **federal
support**]{.mark}]{.underline}. [Imposing **hefty [fees]{.mark}** on
**Chinese** ships now, before American-made alternatives exist,
[would]{.mark} only [raise]{.mark} **freight [costs]{.mark}** and
**snarl global supply chains**]{.underline}, they said.

"It appears to be written by people who have absolutely no idea how the
maritime supply chain works," said Lars Jensen, chief executive of
Vespucci Maritime, a consultancy in Copenhagen. "The container lines
will adjust and cut out the smaller ports. The consequence is going to
be massive port congestion in the larger ports."

[The **shipbuilding initiative**]{.underline}, which includes the
creation of a new White House office, represents another element in
Trump's frontal assault on trade orthodoxy. Coupled with his plans for
the most extensive tariffs in nearly a century, it [would reorient
global commerce in an "America First" direction.]{.underline}

U.S. Trade Representative Jamieson Greer has proposed a complex menu of
fees targeting Chinese ships, scheduled to be the subject of a public
hearing by his agency on Monday.

One levy applies to each port call by a Chinese ocean carrier; a second
would be assessed based on the percentage of Chinese-built ships in a
carrier's fleet; a third depends upon the percentage of the carrier's
future orders that have been placed with Chinese shipyards.

The measures are needed "to create leverage to obtain the elimination"
of Chinese maritime industry dominance, USTR says, suggesting the
president may be prepared to negotiate with Beijing.

If the new port fees are imposed, the three major ocean carrier
alliances, which collaborate like airline industry partnerships, would
probably try to avoid the extra costs by reassigning Chinese-made
container ships from U.S. routes to serve Europe, analysts said.

Some vessels that would be subject to the fees could dock at Canadian or
Mexican ports rather than unload at American wharves --- costing
American dockworkers and truck drivers.

[Smaller carriers]{.underline} [with long-term leases to operate
Chinese-made ships could face ruin,]{.underline} said Hans Laue,
president of Gisholt Shipping in Weston, Florida. Among those affected
would be regional U.S. carriers that ply the waters between South
Florida and gulf ports or Caribbean ports such as Jamaica, the Cayman
Islands and the Dominican Republic.

"[They have hundreds, if not **thousands**, of people working in the
U.S., and they would be **immediately wiped out**]{.underline}," he
said.

Some vessel operators already are trying to cancel contracts with some
U.S. ports and delaying negotiations on new agreements "due to the
uncertainty of costs associated with trading with the United States,"
Brett Bourgeois, executive director of the New Orleans Board of Trade,
said in written comments on the USTR proposal.

Such upheaval in shipping schedules would have consequences for large
and small ports. Container ships normally operate like waterborne buses,
making scheduled stops at multiple ports along a coastline.

But facing fees that might reach \$3.5 million for each stop, they would
probably choose to unload all of their cargo in just one place, such as
the Port of Los Angeles, executives said.

"[You are absolutely going to disrupt the U.S. economy. You'll create
covid-like congestion at places like L.A., Long Beach and New
York]{.underline}," said Joe Kramek, president of the World Shipping
Council, which represents the major ocean carriers.

Fewer vessels docking at smaller ports such as Oakland, California,
would make it harder and more expensive for major U.S. exporters to ship
their goods to foreign customers, and it would affect imports as well.
Farmers who rely on bulk carriers to move grain and other commodities
would be hit especially hard, forced to send their crops hundreds of
miles overland to Southern California.

The proposed fees "will have catastrophic effects on U.S. exports,"
Kevin LaGraize Jr., president of Southport Agencies in Metairie,
Louisiana, said in written comments submitted to USTR.

The fees are just one element in an eight-page draft executive order,
titled "Make Shipbuilding Great Again" and obtained by The Washington
Post, that the administration is finalizing.

U.S. shipyards in recent years typically delivered only a handful of
commercial vessels each year, while China built hundreds. The draft
executive order cites an "urgent need to reinvigorate the U.S.
shipbuilding and maritime industries" and proposes a comprehensive menu
of government aid, including the shipping fees and tariffs on Chinese
cargo-handling gear.

According to a Feb. 27 draft, the president would ask Congress to
establish a dedicated funding source for new shipbuilding ventures.

"We used to make so many ships. We don't make them anymore very much,
but we're going to make them very fast, very soon," Trump said in his
address on March 4 to a joint session of Congress.

The White House did not respond to a request for comment about the
executive order.

[The focus on shipbuilding has bipartisan support]{.underline} --- a
group of labor unions filed a petition seeking government help for
domestic shipmakers during the Biden administration.

In January, just days before President Joe Biden left office, his
administration's USTR endorsed the unions' complaint, concluding in a
182-page investigative report that the Chinese government had used
generous state financing, forced technology transfer, intellectual
property theft and discrimination against foreign firms to increase its
dominance of global maritime markets.

[China's share of global shipbuilding orders rose from less than 5
percent in 1999 to]{.underline} [more than 50 percent by
2023]{.underline}, [depriving U.S. shipyards of business and creating
dangerous "**vulnerabilities** across the U.S.
**economy**]{.underline}," the report said.

[China's **shipbuilding supremacy** also has **military
implications**]{.underline}. Even as relations with Beijing
deteriorated, the U.S. Navy continued to purchase tankers and dry cargo
carriers from Chinese shipyards, according to a 2023 Congressional
Research Service report.

In a speech Tuesday, Vice President JD Vance cited the nation's
shipbuilding decline as an example of deindustrialization that "poses
risks both to our national security and our workforce." Vance contrasted
the industry's performance during World War II, when shipyards turned
out "three ships every two days," with its current annual output of just
five ships.

"Revitalizing domestic shipbuilding is not only possible but also a
priority," said Michael Wessel, a Washington consultant with ties to the
United Steelworkers union. "The principal contributing factor to reduced
capacity has been China's nonmarket pricing of ships. Order books have
dried up. We have existing yards that can do more today, and we have
facilities that can be brought online."

[[An **industry revival**]{.underline}]{.mark}, however, [[faces]{.mark}
**[numerous hurdles]{.mark}**]{.underline}. U[.S. [shipyards]{.mark}
today [have little]{.mark} **[presence]{.mark}** [in]{.mark} the
**[commercial market]{.mark}**]{.underline}, [[concentrating]{.mark}
instead [on]{.mark} producing **vessels** for [the
**Navy**]{.mark}]{.underline}. The only significant recent contract won
by a U.S. shipyard came in 2022, when Matson, a Hawaii-based carrier,
ordered three midsize container ships from the Hanwha Philly Shipyard in
Philadelphia.

[Matson]{.underline}, which serves domestic routes, [needs the vessels
to comply with [the Jones Act]{.mark}, which requires that cargo moving
between **two American ports** is carried aboard a **U.S.-built
ship.**]{.underline}

[The protectionist law]{.underline}, dating to 1920, [[helps explain why
**U.S. shipyards** are]{.mark} so
**[uncompetitive]{.mark}**]{.underline}, analysts said. Matson paid
roughly \$330 million per ship, while Chinese shipyards offer similar
vessels for just \$60 million, according to Lloyd's List, a London-based
industry publication.

[**[Trump's]{.mark}** widespread [**imposition** of **import
taxes**]{.mark}]{.underline}, including on materials used in
shipbuilding such as steel, [will]{.underline} only [[make the]{.mark}
domestic [industry]{.mark} [less competitive]{.mark} in **global
markets**,]{.underline} said Rob Willmington, a Lloyd's List analyst.

"China builds what the industry wants," he said. "You can go to them
with your own design, and they'll do it and do it for 20 percent less
than South Korea. [What's missing is the **market** for **U.S.
ships**."]{.underline}

To Build Them.\" Wall Street Journal. 2-5-2025.

At 13,000 tons, the U.S. Coast Guard's Polar Star is a mammoth vessel
made to cut through Arctic ice more than 20 feet thick. But it is the
U.S.'s only icebreaker that operates year-round, and it was built nearly
half a century ago.

In the intensifying global race to access the Arctic, icebreakers are
the essential tool to open trade routes, allow resource extraction and
project military power. The U.S. and its allies have fallen far behind
Russia, and China is rapidly gaining ground with the help of the world's
largest shipbuilding industry.

President **[[Trump]{.underline}]{.mark}** [has [signaled]{.mark} that
[he wants to put the Arctic back at the top of the]{.mark}]{.underline}
[[U.S.'s **priority list**]{.underline}]{.mark}. He has said the U.S.
needs to take ownership of Greenland for national security and that the
Coast Guard will expand its fleet of icebreakers.

"We're going to order about 40 Coast Guard big icebreakers. Big ones,"
Trump said last month.

[[That will be a **tall order** to **fill**]{.mark}. [The U.S. has been
struggling for years to build a]{.mark} **[single
icebreaker]{.mark}**---vessels that **clear a path** through the **ice
for other ships**]{.underline}. [[Even]{.mark} [if **Trump**]{.mark} [is
able to **marshal**]{.mark} [the **political will**]{.mark} [and
**money** to **build more,**]{.mark}]{.underline} [[the U.S. **will
have** to **breathe life back** into its **ailing shipbuilding
industry**,]{.mark} which has been in decline for decades.]{.underline}

[[Russia]{.underline}]{.mark}, [[meanwhile]{.mark}, [has around **40
icebreakers**]{.mark}]{.underline}, as well as new giant nuclear-powered
ones under construction. Despite being 900 miles from the Arctic Circle,
China has four such vessels. Its first domestically built
nuclear-powered icebreaker could be unveiled as soon as this year,
experts say.

Russia has faced setbacks in recent years. Sanctions over the Ukraine
war have limited its access to components and technologies needed to
build icebreakers, such as propulsion systems and radar equipment. A
nuclear-powered icebreaker under construction called Rossiya is running
three years behind schedule. But it already has a massive lead and years
of experience operating in the Arctic.

As in other areas, Russia is tapping China's investment and
technological support, potentially fueling Beijing's increased interest
in the polar regions. [It took a Chinese shipyard two years to deliver
one **recent icebreaker**. Though the U.S.'s new icebreaker will be a
heavier ice-breaking class than the Chinese vessel, construction started
only recently, five years after the contract was awarded to build
it.]{.underline}

Cost overruns for 46 ships that the Navy has under construction grew
from \$3.4 billion to \$10.4 billion in the past budget year while
delays for certain naval vessels have stretched up to three years.

"[[Nothing is more important than **addressing** the **critical labor

**[[Naval forward presence]{.underline}]{.mark}** --- [the practice of
maintaining combat-credible naval forces]{.underline} [worldwide [to
**deter adversaries**]{.mark}, **reassure allies,**]{.underline} respond
to crises, [and perform]{.underline} constabulary [functions for the
global commons]{.underline} --- [has dominated U.S. foreign policy since
the 1990s]{.underline}. Few critics dare question it. [The concept's
supporters]{.underline} --- under the illusion that "credibility
anywhere is credibility everywhere" --- darkly [warn that rolling back
presence operations **will** **embolden America's
adversaries**.]{.underline}

[The opposite is true]{.underline}. [A **navy tasked to do all** these
things **[cannot]{.mark} do them all well.** Rolling back presence
**will [strengthen]{.mark}**, not **weaken**,
**[deterrence]{.mark}**]{.underline}. For too long, short-term thinking
has taken priority over managing long-term risk. It's time to flip the
script. [Readiness for **great-power conflict**]{.underline} [--- peace
through strength rather than global policing --- should once again be
America's **primary grand-strategic aim**.]{.underline}

Too Busy, and Too Small

Few Americans appreciate just how busy their navy is. [At any time, over
one-third of U.S. [Navy]{.mark} ships are deployed --- the greatest
proportion in history]{.underline}. Sometimes these ships are training
with allies and partners, buttressing American power. Sometimes they are
responding to crises where legitimate American interests are at stake
and force may be necessary. But many of the Navy's overseas duties are
unrelated to coercion or deterrence, including humanitarian operations,
freedom of navigation transits, "maritime security" patrols in far-flung
regions, or various missions under the nebulous banner of norms
enforcement.

As my research has shown, [these [**operations** come at a
**cost**]{.mark}: They [have **shrunk** and]{.mark} [**weakened**
the]{.mark} U.S. Navy's **[surface fleet]{.mark}** to a shadow of its
former self]{.underline}. The reasons lie in politics, poor strategic
foresight, and bureaucracy. While critics usually describe the problem
as a mismatch between operational "demand" and the "supply" of ships,
this mismatch is itself a symptom of an underlying national confusion
about the purpose of the Navy itself. The hard truth is that stale ideas
about America's proper role in the world have outlived the geopolitical
circumstances in which they germinated.

After the Soviet Union dissolved, U.S. policymakers saw a new world
marked by brush-fire conflicts, civil wars, and economic dislocation due
to globalization. Global policing, albeit under more the palatable terms
like "engagement" or "liberal internationalism," became the dominant
foreign policy consensus. To offer flexibility for these brush fires,
the Navy designed its fleet around carrier strike groups and amphibious
readiness groups. The Navy made this case --- that an uncertain world
required presence, and presence required carriers, amphibious ships, and
supporting multi-mission combatants --- in its own planning documents,
and led a public relations campaign to this effect. The 1993 Bottom-Up
Review (the Department of Defense's seminal assessment of required force
structure for the post-Cold War era), under a section entitled "naval
presence," explicitly stated that naval forward presence would require
more large-deck ships than the Navy would need if it used the same
force-planning metric as the other services (the two "major regional
contingency" standard). In other words, "presence" as an idea was good
for the Navy's bottom line --- at first.

Circumstances soon changed. First, the large, exquisite ships that
carrier strike groups and amphibious readiness groups required were
expensive. Over time, this drove up customer costs and lifecycle costs,
and inhibited alternative force structures and platform choices, because
the coalition of contractors and policymakers benefiting from the
presence-oriented force structure objected to changes. Accordingly, with
time, the Navy purchased fewer vessels overall, and the fleet began to
shrink.

Meanwhile, the U.S. military's geographic combatant commanders ---
empowered a few years earlier under the 1986 Goldwater-Nichols Act ---
began demanding surface ships for nearly every crisis that arose in
their theaters. Policymakers, too, grew accustomed to "showing the
flag." Sending a carrier strike group to a hot zone was appealing, as it
avoided the political risk and financial cost of overseas basing and was
an easy way to ratchet diplomatic pressure up and down.

In essence, the Navy did its job too well: It designed a fleet and
promoted a concept for operating it that policymakers and combatant
commanders found addictive. So, throughout the 1990s and into the 2000s,
the surface fleet got busier and busier while becoming smaller and
smaller.

Like a car, a ship can only be run so hard until it becomes too
expensive to maintain. As the Navy overused its ships, they retired
early. Other ships picked up their slack and were then overused
themselves. To support the rising tempo of operations, the Navy
repeatedly delayed maintenance on ships. America's shipyards, which
required predictable contracts to remain economically viable, bled
skilled laborers, driving up costs in an endless cycle.

The result was that the surface fleet shrank from over 400 ships in 1994
to an all-time-low of 272 vessels during the Obama administration
(today, it sits at around 300). Even with an ongoing multi-decade,
multi-billion-dollar investment in the nation's public shipyards, the
U.S. Navy will not clear its maintenance backlogs until at least 2040.
Even the chief of naval operations recently acknowledged that the fleet
will not grow any time soon. [Wargames indicate that,]{.underline} [were
the United States to fight China, the U.S. Navy might eke out a
**nominal win**, but one that **blurs** the **line** between victory and
defeat, setting back **American military power** for a
**generation**.]{.underline}

The Readiness Trade-Off

How was all this allowed to happen?

Everyone, from the combatant commanders to the Navy, lost sight of the
trade-off between operational and structural readiness. "Operational"
readiness refers to the ability of existing military units to fight
tonight. "Structural" readiness refers to a military's ability to
generate sufficient mass for multiple rounds in a prolonged fight,
including factors like the health of the defense-industrial base. In
basic terms, an extremely high level of operational readiness is
required for global policing duties; whereas if the goal is fighting a
long war against a peer competitor, structural readiness is more
important. If resources are finite (which they always are), the two
trade off.

In brief, for three decades, [the U.S. Navy traded its [structural
readiness]{.mark}]{.underline} (for great-power conflict) [for
**operational readiness**]{.underline} (to support naval forward
presence). It [[burned through]{.mark} its **[ships]{.mark}**, and
**debilitated its shipyards**]{.underline}, to [make sure it could
respond to whatever policymakers wanted, whenever they wanted it, no
matter how [irrelevant]{.mark} it was [to **deterrence**]{.mark} and
**warfighting**.]{.underline}

This was not a problem in the 1990s, when the same fleet busy with
presence operations could still fight off any foreseeable challenger.
But by 2015, given the rise of China, the Navy, oversight agencies,
contracted research organizations, and think tanks were all sounding
alarms. Navy leaders begged Congress, time and again, to reduce the
frequency with which Navy ships were deployed, so that the force could
recoup its readiness.

Then came the collisions. In 2017, two U.S. Navy destroyers, in separate
incidents, crashed into commercial ships, and 17 American sailors lost
their lives. Two investigations --- Secretary of the Navy Richard V.
Spencer's Strategic Readiness Review and Chief of Naval Operations John
M. Richardson's Comprehensive Review --- offered recommendations to
restore the Navy's readiness. The Navy's highest-level investigation
even recommended "condition\[ing\] congressional and executive branch
leaders to accept that the higher cost and time to achieve established
readiness standards will mean less Navy presence worldwide." This never
happened, because Congress continued to assume the Navy could balance
both operational and structural readiness, as my research delineating
the hearings after the accidents has shown.

Legislation passed after the collisions resolved none of the Navy's
presence-induced headaches. Congress enacted reforms to restore
operational readiness but ignored the Navy's proposed reforms to improve
its structural readiness. The Strategic Readiness Review had proposed
changes to the Navy's readiness commands (such as eliminating the
so-called "Inouye Amendment") and changes to the adjudication of
combatant commanders' requests for forces. Instead, what the Navy got
was a little more officer training here, some sleep requirements for
officers there. After dipping for one year after the collisions, the
Navy's operational tempo continued its inexorable annual rise that began
in the 1990s. Presence was simply too popular an idea.

**[[Shipbuilding is Not Enough]{.underline}]{.mark}**

[The U.S. Navy's **[readiness]{.mark}** [for **sustained
combat**]{.mark}]{.underline} [--- and hence its **ability** to deter
China --- [is]{.mark} in a **[catastrophic]{.mark} state**]{.underline}.
The Trump administration should give the U.S. Navy a fighting chance to
rebuild itself.

It can start with the unfinished business of 2017, reforming the global
force management process (the process by which the Department of Defense
adjudicates combatant commanders' requests for military forces) to
prioritize structural readiness over emergent demands. In this process,
the service chiefs and the joint staff consider combatant commander
needs in their theaters and recommend service assets that can be made
available to them. Should a combatant commander need forces in excess of
this established allocation (an "emergent requirement"), he or she can
submit a "request for forces." The idea that the services should "just
say no" to such requests is aspirational, but difficult. Why? Because
--- as the Strategic Readiness Review noted --- the Navy has developed a
culture of meeting non-stop (presence-driven) operational demands.

As the review also points out, [the multiple [overlapping
authorities]{.mark} and the adverse growth of staffs within the Navy has
[made]{.mark} tracking the long-term effects of operations]{.underline}
[on [**structural readiness** a **nightmare**]{.mark}]{.underline}. In
addition, the staff of the chief of naval operations, located in the
Pentagon, appears biased towards operational demands and can lose sight
of long-term readiness. The problem is not that the Navy lacks input in
global force management, but that the Navy still does not "say no"
enough. To resolve this, the review recommended establishing the initial
force availability as the "maximum supportable peacetime force," such
that any further combatant commander requests for forces can only be met
with forces moved from other theaters. This is, in essence, a hard cap
on what the Navy can do, ensuring that unready units are never sent to
meet the latest and greatest combatant commander request.

[But [emergent demands aside]{.mark}]{.underline}, [Navy [operational
tempo will still **remain too high** to]{.mark} [restore]{.mark}
**structural** **[readiness]{.mark}**.]{.underline} The
**[Trump]{.underline}** administration [should]{.underline} therefore
[reevaluate]{.underline} [the idea of **naval forward presence**
itself]{.underline}: the notion that America's Navy is foremost a
provider of global goods, and a global policeman, rather than the
preeminent warfighting force of a maritime power whose primary goals
ought to be deterring --- and if necessary, winning --- [a great-power
conflict.]{.underline}

[The U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates [should **give up its
quest** for [command of the maritime commons]{.mark} in the Western
Pacific. The struggle [is based on a **false premise**]{.mark} --- that
if the United States loses command of the seas, China will **step in**
the fill the vacuum]{.underline}. In fact, [**even if** the
U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates [loses command of the maritime
commons, [China is **not positioned** to gain it]{.mark}]{.underline}.
However, by positioning China as an existential threat, the United
States is boxing itself in politically. [The U]{.underline}nited
[S]{.underline}tates **[courts disaster]{.underline}** [when it
**overextends itself** by seeking military primacy in the region. There
is one fundamental reason: **the tyranny of distance**]{.underline}. The
**[[maritime]{.underline}]{.mark}** nature of American [[**power** is a
**double-edged sword**]{.underline}]{.mark}, specifically when it comes
to its competition with China. [American command over the maritime
commons allows the U.S. military to project power globally, but
[when]{.mark} that [power is projected at]{.mark} a **[great
distance]{.mark}** from U.S. shores, as in the Western Pacific, [U.S.
forces are]{.mark} particularly **[vulnerable]{.mark}** to measures
designed to **raise the costs of access**]{.underline}. First, [a
strategy of maintaining command of the maritime commons in the face of
anti-access measures exposes U.S. dependence on allied territory to
support deployed forces]{.underline} through basing, infrastructure, and
logistics. Second, [[as the costs]{.mark} and risks [of maintaining
access increase,]{.mark} the [**asymmetrical stakes** become **more
constraining**]{.mark} for the U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates
[than for China. [Overcommitment]{.mark}]{.underline} has historically
been endemic to U.S. grand strategy, but it [[is]{.underline}]{.mark}
especially **[[dangerous]{.underline}]{.mark}** [now that China is
capable of inflicting heavy costs upon the U]{.underline}nited
[S]{.underline}tates. Instead, the United States should, together with
its allies and partners, focus on denying China command of the Pacific
maritime commons. [[It is]{.mark} **cheaper** and [**easier** to
**deny** command of the seas than to exercise it]{.mark}]{.underline}.
If China cannot gain command of the seas, [[the]{.mark} Western [Pacific
will **remain** a contested environment]{.mark}]{.underline} --- [one
[that China **cannot break out**]{.mark} **[of]{.mark}**]{.underline}.
[[China would]{.mark} either be forced to **[accept the s]{.mark}tatus
[quo]{.mark}** [or]{.mark} make a first move in which it
**[overextend]{.mark}s itself**.]{.underline} While [[giving up command
of the seas]{.underline}]{.mark} may seem unpalatable, it [**[need not
be fatal]{.mark}** to the U]{.underline}nited [S]{.underline}tates [and
its]{.underline} allies and partners' collective [goal to maintain the
regional balance of power]{.underline}. The alternative is unlikely to
end well for them.

[FROM BEFORE THE COMMON ERA until Pearl Harbor, great powers competed at
sea as much as on land.]{.underline} Carthage, Rome, and Troy fought
regularly on the waters of the Mediterranean. Enormous fleets---the 1588
Spanish Armada boasted 130 ships---plied the oceans, fighting other
fleets, seizing prizes, and staking claims to territory. Even in the
days of sail, warships crossed the world: early in the sixteenth
century, the Chinese and Portuguese navies clashed repeatedly near
what\'s now Hong Kong. For millennia, nations sunk into their navies
amounts that might have ended want, only to behold the investments
literally sink. During the modern era, Argentina, Brazil, Britain,
Chile, France, Germany, Japan, Russia, and the United States have
expended groaning chests of treasure on warships. Naval rivalries
between Britain and Germany helped ignite both world wars. The Pacific
Theater fighting of World War Il began in part because of America\'s
1940 decision to forward-deploy its fleet from California to Hawaii,
closer to Tokyo, and in part because Japan placed an existential wager
on the maritime theories of Alfred Thayer Mahan, a member of the society
of famous persons who proved, following their deaths, to have been wrong
about practically everything. [Many centuries of an extravagant naval
arms race culminated]{.underline} in the October 1944 Battle of Leyte
Gulf, where 367 warships and 1,800 aircraft hammered at each other with
cannon, bombs, torpedoes, and battleship shells weighing up to 3,000
pounds apiece. [Then the **naval [arms race stopped]{.mark}**[. **So did
naval fighting**]{.mark}. The [**seas have been quiet** for]{.mark}
nearly **[seventy- five years]{.mark}**]{.underline}, perhaps the
longest stretch without bloodshed on the waters since first the sail was
hoisted. [Some Argentine and British ships clashed during the 1982
Falklands conflict]{.underline}, and Iranian and Iraqi vessels scuffled
around oil tankers during the mid- 1980s, [but **[big fights]{.mark} at
sea [have come to a halt]{.mark}**[, as has]{.mark} the **great-power
[naval competition]{.mark}**.]{.underline} The [last time a major naval
battle occurred, India was not yet an independent nation]{.underline},
the solid-state transistor had not been invented, and the Dodgers played
in Brooklyn. [Century upon century of great-power competition at sea
ended with a **final score of 10---0**.]{.underline} That\'s the
[[number of supercarrier]{.mark} strike [groups possessed by the
**U**]{.mark}nited **[S]{.mark}**tates [(ten) versus]{.mark} the number
possessed by [**all other** nation**s** combined
(zero).]{.mark}]{.underline} World War Il left the warships of the Axis
powers in Davy Jones\'s locker. The Soviet Union tried to step in with
bucket-of-bolts vessels that craved return to port; since about 1960,
the [[US Navy]{.mark} has **enforced hegemony over the blue
water**.]{.underline} \"Hegemony\" has a bad reputation in political
science, assumed always to be undesirable. In this case, the [[**size**,
**power**, and **competence**]{.mark} of the US Navy has **[banished
fighting]{.mark}** from much of Earth\'s surface. [For a
**half-century**, **no nation**]{.mark} **has [even attempted to
contest]{.mark} US [naval dominion]{.mark}**.]{.underline} The
[all-electric, stealth- hull cruisers the United States builds are so
advanced]{.underline} ---nicknamed \"arsenal ships\" for their
firepower---[that no other nation has even experimented with a vessel of
this general type.]{.underline} The [supercarrier strike groups that
America deploys---full-deck, nuclear-powered carriers]{.underline}
bearing long-range jets, [protected by guided-missile destroyers and
screened by nuclear submarines---are so potent]{.underline}, to say
nothing of so expensive ( naval hegemony cost the United States \$155
billion in 2017), [that no other nation has tried to build one.
[**China** and **Russia** **possess no**]{.mark} **nuclear
[supercarriers]{.mark}**[, and have **none under
construction**]{.mark}.]{.underline} The limited-deck, diesel-powered
carriers China began laying down in 2015 will be suitable for patrolling
coastal areas but not for the open ocean, while [everything the US Navy
builds is intended to travel beyond the horizon.]{.underline} Because
the US Navy operates far from the homes of Americans, many are not
attuned to its size and might. Soldiers can march in Fourth of July
parades, and Air Force fighters can perform Super Bowl flyovers; the
Navy\'s boats can be observed only on the waves. Most who live in other
nations are not attuned to the US Navy either. There\'s no compelling
reason to think about a well-behaved military force stationed on the
opposite side of the globe. Under US Navy hegemony, [piracy still
occurs, but great powers have not seized merchant ships in three
generations.]{.underline} That cargo ships whose decks are stacked with
containers of valuable goods can steam anywhere without fear of being
impounded by a warship is the unseen reason global trade took off, and
global trade benefits almost everyone, while reducing war. The reality
that the [US Navy rules the blue water both **reduces a historic cause
of conflict** and **enables the prosperity of the contemporary
era**.]{.underline} Speaking at West Point as president, Obama said that
the United States does not use its might to acquire territory or seize
resources. Instead, [American might is employed to pursue what US
leaders believe is best for the world.]{.underline} Such beliefs may be
wrong, even tragically so. But has any other nation that possessed
overwhelming military force ever refrained from using force for conquest
or pursuit of riches? That is the unseen question of the oceans---unseen
because fighting on the water has stopped.

[[More than]{.underline} **[80%]{.underline}** [of]{.underline}]{.mark}
[US [Navy]{.mark}]{.underline} (USN) Boeing F/A-18 Super Hornet [strike
[fighters]{.mark}]{.underline} [[are]{.underline}]{.mark} **[currently
[deemed]{.mark} [mission ready]{.mark},]{.underline}** [a dramatic
turnaround from]{.underline} **[significantly lower]{.underline}**
[readiness rates reported less than a decade ago.]{.underline} The navy
had reached the 80% rate for the twin-engined fighter and the related
EA-18G electronic-warfare variant in 2019. But the service has been able
to maintain its 80%-readiness target, service officials said earlier
this month. On 3 August, those [[officials]{.underline}
**[touted]{.underline}**]{.mark} [the jets' **[continued high
mission-ready rate]{.mark}**]{.underline}, [which comes after the USN
for several years pursued a **concerted effort to improve
readiness**]{.underline} for an aircraft it describes as the "backbone"
of its fighter fleet. US Navy Super Hornets until recently fleet
suffered from precariously low readiness levels, owing to budget
restrictions, high operational demands and an outdated maintenance
system The 80% mission-readiness rate contrasts sharply with the reality
just a few years earlier. In 2017, fewer than 50% of the navy's F/A-18s
and EA-18s were ready to fly. According to Cirim data, the USN had 416
E/F-model Super Hornets in active service at the start of 2023, and 152
EA-18Gs. Senior leaders in the USN are heaping praise on one officer --
Captain Jason Denney -- for overseeing the change. Denney took command
of the navy's F/A-18 and EA-18G programme office in 2019. Known as
PMA-265, the office manages acquisition, delivery and sustainment of the
two aircraft for the service. The year earlier, then-defence secretary
James Mattis had mandated that all fighter types in the US inventory
achieve readiness rates of 80% or greater before the US government's
fiscal year 2019 ended in September of that year. During
[Denney's]{.underline} tenure, which concluded on 3 August, the USN
F/A-18 programme [office rolled out]{.underline} a series of reforms
called [[the]{.underline}]{.mark} [Naval Sustainment
System-Aviation]{.underline} ([[NSS-A]{.underline}]{.mark}) -- [a
programme]{.underline} [meant to]{.underline} **[address maintenance
failings]{.underline}** [and to [help]{.mark} the **service [meet the
80% goal]{.mark}.** The]{.underline} navy describes [NSS-A as a
"**data-informed**]{.underline}" [framework that seeks to]{.underline}
"**[increase spare parts]{.underline}**, **[enhance
capability]{.underline}** [and]{.underline} **[maintain]{.underline}**
[aircraft at a faster rate]{.underline}". The improved logistics system,
combined with increasing defence budgets in recent years and an end to
most active-combat operations in the Middle East, appear to have
produced results. Speaking at the 3 August ceremony in which Denney
handed over command of PMA-265, Vice Admiral Francis Morley praised the
Super Hornet pilot's role in the transformation, noting the F/A-18 was
the only platform to reach the 80% readiness target by the end of
FY2019. Denney "pioneered [[the NSS-A mode]{.underline}l]{.mark}, and
this year [[surpassed]{.underline}
**[full-mission]{.underline}**]{.mark} **[capable [readiness
rates]{.mark}]{.underline}** [[for the first time in]{.mark} the
[history]{.mark} of the programme]{.underline}", Morely says. The
uniformed advisor to the assistant secretary of the navy for research,
development and acquisition also notes the NSS-A changes reduced the
per-aircraft maintenance cost by half for each F/A-18. In written
remarks, secretary of the navy Carlos Del Toro says Denney was
"instrumental" in developing [[the]{.mark} new sustainment
[framework]{.mark},]{.underline} which [[is]{.mark} now [being
used]{.mark}]{.underline} [**[across the]{.mark} [navy]{.mark}.** The
[improvements]{.mark} [in]{.mark}]{.underline} F/A-18
[[readiness]{.underline} **[appear]{.underline}** ]{.mark}**[to be
[lasting]{.mark}]{.underline}**. The navy first reported surpassing the
80% threshold in 2019, and senior admirals at the 2023 Sea Air Space
conference April confirmed publicly that 372 Super Hornets were mission
capable at the time.

forces are in \"a high state of readiness." 8/2/23.

Admiral Michael [[Gilday]{.underline}]{.mark}, Chief of Naval
Operations, [[oversees]{.underline}]{.mark} more than **[300
ships]{.underline}** [and]{.underline} **[350,000 service
members]{.underline}**. He is the top-ranked uniformed officer [in what
is considered to be [the **world\'s strongest maritime
force.**]{.mark}]{.underline} This interview, conducted on July 11, has
been edited for brevity and clarity. On a possible contingency in Taiwan
Takagi Masaru: US intelligence officials, including CIA Director William
Burns, have said Chinese President Xi Jinping has instructed his
military to be ready to invade Taiwan by 2027. What is your view on
this? Admiral Michael Gilday: We take statements like that very
seriously. We have a great deal of respect for the trajectory that the
PRC has been on with respect to modernizing their capabilities and their
forces, not just their conventional forces, but also their nuclear
forces, their space forces, and their cyber forces. I think [[it\'s
important]{.mark} that [we maintain]{.mark}]{.underline} **[a high
state]{.underline}** [of [readiness]{.mark}]{.underline} today, and at
the same time continue to modernize our collective forces --- not just
the United States, but Japan and other allies and partners. We must be
ready for 2027, 2030. We must be ready every single day. [It\'s our duty
to be ready and to have a force that\'s capable of
prevailing]{.underline}, but our focus is on deterring that conflict
from ever happening. Takagi: In June, a Chinese navy vessel cut sharply
across the path of an American destroyer, forcing it to slow to avoid a
collision. Why do you think the Chinese conducted such a dangerous
maneuver? Gilday: It was dangerous. We characterize that maneuver as
unsafe and unprofessional. It\'s not what we expect from high-end navies
in terms of acting responsibly at sea. I won\'t try to assume what the
intentions were of the PLAN ship in that maneuver. I would only say that
I\'m proud of the way that the US Navy destroyer captain and his crew
handled themselves in that situation, adhering to international law,
communicating very clearly on the radio so that not only that particular
Chinese ship, but anybody in the vicinity, could understand what we were
doing and why. The US military said in June a Chinese naval ship sailed
across the path of its naval vessels transiting the Taiwan Strait.
Takagi: The military-to-military hotline between the US and China has
not been used since the then House of Representatives Speaker Nancy
Pelosi visited Taiwan last summer. Do you have any concerns about an
unexpected military confrontation right now? Gilday: We have seen an
increase in PRC activity in the maritime since Speaker Pelosi\'s visit
last year. I think that it would be better if we could talk on a more
regular basis and have open lines available when any type of friction is
evident between our nations. We should avoid a position where we\'re
trying to read somebody else\'s mind. But we will, in the absence of
those communications, have to rely on what we see, how forces behave,
what they\'re doing, and then respond accordingly based on the
directions and guidance that we receive from our superiors. I think that
the most recent visits (to China) of high-ranking US officials; the
Secretary of State, the Treasury Secretary, I think that they\'re a good
sign, in terms of communications improving. And we\'ll see one day if we
get to a point where military-to-military communications become more the
norm. US Secretary of State Antony Blinken met with Chinese President Xi
Jinping on June 19 in Beijing. China\'s ultimate goal Takagi: Looking at
PLA\'s activities today in East Asia, what do you think China ultimately
wants to achieve? Gilday: It would appear by their actions that the PRC
has an intent to test and potentially change the rule-based
international order to make it advantageous for them. I think that
there\'s a difference in mindset in terms of how our country, how the
PRC views international rules-based order, versus the way that other
nations do. I think that we need to continue to uphold the international
rules that are globally recognized, and we should challenge any nation
that tries to test the validity of those rules. US Navy and global
military power balance Takagi: How do you see the balance of military
strength between the US and China in the Western Pacific region? Gilday:
I think that [[the]{.mark} [US]{.mark} [military]{.mark} [maintains a
**very healthy** deterrent]{.mark} capability]{.underline} in the
Western Pacific. As important is what we\'re doing on a day-to-day basis
in conjunction with allies and partners. The US and Japan are both
involved in the Quad, as an example. [[We see]{.mark} our
[bilateral]{.mark}]{.underline} --- the US Navy and the Japanese
Maritime Self Defense Force --- [[and multilateral exercises]{.mark} are
**ongoing**]{.underline} [on almost a [monthly]{.mark}
basis]{.underline}. I do think that the growth of the Chinese navy has
been impressive, and we respect that growth. [After two decades of
ground wars]{.underline} in Iraq and Afghanistan, [[the US has begun
to]{.underline} **[invest]{.underline}**
]{.mark}**[heavily]{.underline}** [[in]{.mark} our [maritime
forces]{.mark}]{.underline}, along with the US Marine Corps. So right
now, [in seven shipyards across the country, we have 55 ships that are
under construction]{.underline}, [and another 70 that are under contract
to be built]{.underline}. [That\'s a]{.underline} **[significant
investment]{.underline}**. I think [[the]{.mark} [capabilities]{.mark}
that [we field]{.mark}]{.underline}, along with a very highly trained
professional force, [[are]{.mark} really the]{.underline}
**[[asymmetric]{.mark} [advantage]{.mark}]{.underline}** [that we have
over anybody]{.underline}. Takagi: In order to counter the Chinese navy,
the largest in the world, how should the US strengthen and develop its
capabilities in the coming years? Gilday: If I take a look at the PLAN
aircraft carriers against US capabilities, [[the US has a]{.underline}
**[far lead]{.underline}**]{.mark} [[in terms of]{.mark}
**capabilities**]{.underline}, in terms of **[[operational

at]{.underline} [sea]{.underline} **[for a century now.]{.underline}**
We\'ve learned a lot in peace and war, in terms of how to operate them.
[The nuclear propulsion]{.underline} that we have in those carriers
[allows us to maintain them at sea for extended]{.underline} [periods of
time.]{.underline} [[We are]{.underline} **[highly
proficient]{.underline}**]{.mark} [in terms of our ability to
**generate**]{.underline} [dozens and dozens and dozens of sorties off
the deck of an aircraft carrier, to reload the weapons on an aircraft
carrier]{.underline}. We\'re very adept at that.

[[The]{.mark} U.S. [Navy released a]{.mark} short]{.underline} wish
[[list]{.underline}]{.mark} to Congress [[that
would]{.underline}]{.mark} mostly **[[accelerate]{.mark}
[efforts]{.mark}]{.underline}** [[to make]{.mark} [the]{.mark}
[fleet]{.mark} **more [ready]{.mark}** and **more lethal**]{.underline}
for high-end combat in a contested environment. The 11 items total \$2
billion, while past years' lists included dozens of items and expensive
procurement requests. Chief of Naval Operations Adm. [Mike
[Gilday]{.mark} has [set]{.mark}]{.underline} [[readiness]{.underline}
**[as]{.underline}**]{.mark} **[[his top

[size]{.mark}** of the]{.underline} [fleet **[beyond]{.mark}** [what it
can]{.mark}]{.underline} [[support]{.mark} in manpower, maintenance,
munitions and **other measures of readiness**]{.underline}. In line with
those priorities, the top four items on the Navy's fiscal 2024 unfunded
priorities list are research and development efforts to boost lethality.
[The sea service wants \$45 million to develop the]{.underline}
**[[Maritime Targeting Cell-Afloat]{.mark},]{.underline}** [which
[would]{.mark}]{.underline} fuse information from a range of sensors to
shore-based and at-sea nodes in communications-denied environments. This
project "\[d\]irectly supports Project Overmatch and Joint All Domain
Command and Control (JADC2) by integrating intelligence, sensors,
shooters, platforms, and weapons to [[enhance lethality]{.mark} and
survivability]{.underline}," according to the Navy. [A second
[research]{.mark} and development effort]{.underline}, [for \$49
million,]{.underline} **[[would modernize]{.underline}]{.mark}** [the
E-2D Advanced Hawkeye [aircraft]{.mark},]{.underline} which serves as
the command-and-control "quarterback" in naval aviation operations.
[This effort to **update**]{.underline} "[legacy cockpit, mission
computers]{.underline}, [displays, and multiple cyber
issues]{.underline}" [would]{.underline} [allow the
aircraft]{.underline}, which operate at sea as part of the carrier air
wing, [to]{.underline} **[improve their targeting]{.underline}** and
enable long-range maritime strike missions. [Third on the list is \$186
million to help bring the Zumwalt-class destroyers]{.underline} --- the
first ships that will host the Conventional Prompt Strike hypersonic
missiles --- into the Project Overmatch network. The Zumwalt Enterprise
Upgrade Solution would add assured beyond-line-of-sight communications
to support hypersonic weapons employment. The fourth item, dubbed
VIOLET, is classified. The list includes a combined \$472 million to
accelerate the installation of the Surface Electronic Warfare
Improvement Program block III capabilities onto both new Flight III
Arleigh Burke-class destroyers --- including hulls 136 and 137, which
won't deliver until 2028 or 2029 --- and aircraft carriers, including
Harry S. Truman during its midlife refueling and complex overhaul as
well as Enterprise during its ongoing construction. The two largest
items on the list are \$550 million for a set of facilities restoration
and modernization projects for installations around the globe, and \$300
million for dry dock repairs at Puget Sound Naval Shipyard in
Washington. [Also [boosting readiness is]{.mark}]{.underline} \$[**[100

**[However]{.underline}**, [[it is not melting permafrost]{.mark}
directly [that **poses** the **most immediate
risk**,]{.mark}]{.underline} added Claverie. "[The danger comes from
another global warming impact: the **disappearance** of **Arctic sea

CONCLUSIONS

[Currently available [data]{.mark} [indicate that there is **no
increased risk** of **human viral**]{.mark}
**[pathogen]{.mark}**]{.underline} [[emergence from
**permafrost**]{.mark} [**compared** to **other**]{.mark}
**[environmental]{.mark} sources**]{.underline}. We do not claim that
viral pathogens in permafrost pose zero risk or that surveillance of
putative viral pathogens in permafrost is unnecessary. [However, [there
is currently **no evidence** tha]{.mark}t **human** or animal viral
[**pathogens** **frozen in permafrost pose** an **imminent disease
outbreak**]{.mark} **[threat]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Though climate
change is accelerating thaw, [the [**entry** of microbes from]{.mark}
**ancient [permafrost]{.mark}** into the modern environment [is]{.mark}
[not]{.mark} a **[new]{.mark} phenomenon**]{.underline}. [Permafrost is
continually and naturally exposed to the modern environment by
**processes** such as **erosion**]{.underline},
[cryoturbation]{.underline}, [frost heave, solifluction, wildfire, and
**climate fluctuations**]{.underline} (151--153). [[Humans]{.mark} [have
been]{.mark} in the Arctic for more than 40,000 years]{.underline}
(Alaska up to 25,000 years and Scandinavia \~5,000 to 12,000 years)
(154--156). This suggests that [people are]{.underline} and have been
[[**regularly exposed** to **viruses** from **permafrost

health consequences.

[[Framing viral discovery efforts]{.underline}]{.mark} in the cryosphere
[[as a search for]{.mark} "zombie viruses]{.underline}" or potentially
[[pandemic pathogens]{.underline} [is]{.underline}]{.mark} not
particularly useful and **[perhaps even [harmful]{.mark}.]{.underline}**
Stoking fears of viruses in thawing permafrost may inadvertently
discourage customary and traditional cultural practices among subarctic
and Arctic residents or divert attention from the more pressing ways
that pathogens in the warming Arctic pose risk to human health and
well-being (157). For example, wildlife and humans increasingly occupy
shared habitats, providing opportunities for viruses maintained in
animals to spillover into humans (90). Arthropod and rodent disease
vector ranges are expanding and shifting northward (158). Extreme
precipitation and flooding events are increasing, threatening
infrastructure such as water and waste treatment facilities (159--161).
Higher temperatures increase the survival of some water-borne disease
agents (91). Furthermore, wildlife health may be affected as a
consequence of climate change, which further compromises fragile
ecosystems and the people that rely upon them (162).

\"Pandoravirus: the melting Arctic is releasing ancient germs -- how
worried should we be?.\" The Conversation. 12-14-2022.
https://www.gavi.org/vaccineswork/pandoravirus-melting-arctic-releasing-ancient-germs-how-worried-should-we-be

[[Scientists]{.mark} have recently [revived several large
viruses]{.mark} that had been [buried]{.mark} in the frozen Siberian
ground (permafrost) [for **tens of thousands of
years**.]{.mark}]{.underline}

The youngest virus to be revived was a sprightly 27,000 years old. And
the oldest -- a Pandoravirus -- was around 48,500 years old. This is the
oldest virus ever to have been revived.

As the world continues to warm, the thawing permafrost is releasing
organic matter that has been frozen for millennia, including bacteria
and viruses -- some that can still reproduce.

This latest work was by a group of scientists from France, Germany and
Russia; they managed to reanimate 13 viruses -- with such exotic names
as Pandoravirus and Pacmanvirus -- drawn from seven samples of Siberian
permafrost.

Assuming that the samples were not contaminated during extraction
(always difficult to guarantee) these would indeed represent viable
viruses that had previously only replicated tens of thousands of years
ago.

[This is [not the first time]{.mark} that a viable virus has been
detected in permafrost samples.]{.underline} Earlier studies have
reported the detection of a Pithovirus and a Mollivirus.

In their preprint (a study that is yet to be reviewed by other
scientists), the authors state that it is "legitimate to ponder the risk
of ancient viral particles remaining infectious and getting back into
circulation by the thawing of ancient permafrost layers". So what do we
know so far about the risk of these so-called "zombie viruses"?

[[All]{.mark} the [viruses]{.mark} cultured so far from such samples are
giant DNA viruses that only affect amoebae. They [are far from
**viruses** that affect **mammals**]{.mark}, [let alone, humans]{.mark}
and [would be **very unlikely** to **pose a danger to
humans**.]{.mark}]{.underline}

However, one such large amoebae-infecting virus, called Acanthamoeba
polyphaga mimivirus, has been linked to pneumonia in humans. But this
association is still far from proven. So [it **[does not
appear]{.mark}** that the **[viruses]{.mark}** **cultured** from
**permafrost** samples [pose a **threat to public
health**.]{.mark}]{.underline}

A more relevant area of concern is that as the permafrost thaws it could
release the bodies of long-dead people who might have died of an
infectious disease and so release that infection back into the world.

[The only human infection that has been eradicated globally is
smallpox]{.underline} and the reintroduction of smallpox, especially in
hard-to-reach locations, could be a global disaster. Evidence of
smallpox infection has been detected in bodies from permafrost burials
but "only partial gene sequences" so broken bits of virus that could not
infect anyone. [The smallpox virus does]{.underline}, [however, survive
well **when frozen at -20°C**, but still only for a **few decades** and
**not centuries**.]{.underline}

In the last couple of decades, scientists have exhumed the bodies of
people who died from the Spanish flu and were buried in
permafrost-affected ground in Alaska and Svalbard, Norway. The influenza
virus was able to be sequenced but not cultured from the tissues of
these deceased people. Influenza **[[viruses]{.underline}]{.mark}**
[[can survive]{.mark} frozen for [at least a year]{.mark} when frozen
[but **probably not several decades**.]{.mark}]{.underline}

**WWF Arctic 24** \"Arctic conservation wins 2024.\" World Wildlife

This past year was the second-warmest year on record, according to
NOAA's 2024 Arctic Report Card. [Despite this challenge,
**[progress]{.mark}** [has been made in **protecting** this]{.mark}
**unique [region]{.mark}**]{.underline}. [From [tackling]{.mark}
**[black carbon emissions]{.mark}** to mapping **whale** **migration

protections]{.mark}, and supporting Indigenous-led conservation, these
achievements [demonstrate]{.mark} the [power of]{.mark} collaboration,
science, and **leadership** in [**Arctic
conservation**.]{.mark}]{.underline}

Driving conservation through collaborative partnerships

[Collaborative efforts are driving impactful marine conservation across
the Arctic]{.underline}. In Alaska, WWF-US is partnering with the Inuit
communities of Kotlik and Emmonak to better understand beluga whales in
the Yukon River. Through acoustic monitoring, this initiative combines
Indigenous knowledge and science to study how belugas are adapting to a
changing ecosystem, ensuring their protection.

In Greenland, WWF is supporting sustainable tourism development by
helping tour operators learn from Iceland's experiences. This initiative
focuses on expanding tourism in the region while protecting the pristine
environment that makes East Greenland unique. By promoting best
practices, the project aims to balance economic opportunities with
environmental conservation.

In Nunavut, Canada, WWF-Canada is working closely with Inuit leaders to
support community-led conservation projects. These efforts focus on
conserving natural areas and species while simultaneously protecting
livelihoods and enhancing food security. By aligning conservation with
community priorities, the initiative strengthens both ecological and
human well-being.

These projects showcase the power of partnerships that blend Indigenous
leadership, local knowledge, and scientific expertise.

In 2024, WWF celebrated a significant milestone for Arctic marine
conservation with the publication of a scientific paper detailing
ArcNet, a groundbreaking framework for protecting Arctic ecosystems.
Originally introduced in 2021, ArcNet identifies 83 priority areas for
conservation across the Arctic Ocean laying the foundation for a
comprehensive network of marine protected and conserved areas. This
publication advances global understanding of the Arctic's biodiversity
and provides a clear path for conservation action.

The paper showcases ArcNet's methodology, which identifies critical
habitats, such as breeding grounds and feeding areas for Arctic marine
life. By sharing these findings, WWF has equipped policymakers and
stakeholders with a blueprint and the tools needed to meet global
conservation targets, including protecting 30 per cent of the world's
oceans by 2030.

[[Protecting the **Central Arctic Ocean** from
**overfishing**]{.underline}]{.mark}

In 2024, a key step was taken to ensure the future protection of the
Central Arctic Ocean through the continued implementation of the Central
Arctic Ocean Fisheries Agreement (CAOFA). This landmark agreement
prevents unregulated commercial fishing in this sensitive and rapidly
changing region. During a meeting held in June 2024, WWF emphasized two
critical points:

The need to identify and protect sensitive areas where even exploratory
fishing would be harmful.

The importance of delaying adoption of regulations unless they meet the
highest standards of precaution.

The outcome of this meeting reflects this cautious approach, with
parties agreeing to take additional time to refine the rules. This delay
provides an opportunity to ensure the regulations are truly robust and
to strengthen the agreement by carving out areas where fishing will be
prohibited. WWF remains actively engaged, offering concrete proposals to
make CAOFA a model for precautionary governance in the Arctic Ocean.

**[[Safeguarding Arctic whales]{.underline}]{.mark}**

In September of 2024, we produced a significant and essential building
block for whale conservation with the release of WWF's Arctic Blue
Corridors online report. This interactive resource highlights the
critical migratory routes of narwhals, bowhead whales, and
belugas---routes that are vital for their survival. The report also
reveals a concerning overlap between these blue corridors and increasing
ship traffic in the Arctic, which has surged by 37 per cent from 2013 to
2023. This growing presence of vessels brings threats, such as fatal
collisions and underwater noise pollution, disrupting the whales'
ability to navigate, feed, and avoid predators.

The report underscores the urgent need for Arctic countries to
incorporate blue corridors into their biodiversity commitments,
including protecting 30 per cent of oceans by 2030. It also calls on the
shipping industry to adapt by rerouting ships away from critical whale
habitats or slowing down in unavoidable migration bottlenecks. These
measures, combined with innovative solutions like quieter ship
technologies, offer a clear path forward. Now is the time to act.

**[[Tackling black carbon in the Arctic]{.underline}]{.mark}**

[The ban on heavy fuel oil]{.underline} ([HFO]{.underline}) in the
Arctic, [which came into effect on 1 July 2024, marks a significant
milestone in **protecting** this **fragile ecosystem**]{.underline}. HFO
is not only a highly polluting fuel but also a major source of black
carbon, a short-lived yet potent climate pollutant produced by the
incomplete combustion of fossil fuels. When black carbon settles on
Arctic snow and ice, it accelerates melting by reducing reflectivity,
contributing to the region's warming at alarming rates. However, the ban
includes significant loopholes which delay full implementation until
2029, meaning the risk to Arctic biodiversity remains significant.

In October 2024, the International Maritime Organization (IMO) took an
important step by agreeing to advance discussions on regulating black
carbon emissions. During the Marine Environment Protection Committee
meeting (MEPC 82), the IMO committed to exploring the concept of 'polar
fuels', which could dramatically reduce black carbon emissions by
requiring ships to transition from dirty HFO to cleaner alternatives,
such as distillate fuels or low-carbon options.

This progress follows over a decade of inaction, despite clear evidence
of black carbon's devastating impact on Arctic ice and global climate
systems. Member States now have until January 2025 to refine proposals
for mandatory regulations, which could be adopted by 2026. While this is
a positive development, swift action is essential to secure lasting
protection for the Arctic and mitigate global climate change.

**[[Pausing deep-sea mining in Norway]{.underline}]{.mark}**

In 2024, Norway's plans for deep-sea mining faced significant pushback,
resulting in a critical pause to reconsider environmental protections.
Deep-sea mining threatens fragile marine ecosystems, many of which
remain unexplored. Despite global calls for caution, Norway aimed to
authorize mining without sufficient environmental impact assessments,
raising concerns about compliance with national and international laws,
including the newly adopted High Seas Treaty designed to protect marine
biodiversity.

WWF Norway and other civil society groups stepped in, filing a lawsuit
against the Norwegian government for failing to apply the precautionary
principle and thoroughly evaluate the environmental risks. The legal
challenge, combined with public opposition, sparked widespread debate
and scrutiny of the government's approach. The turning point came when
the Socialist Left Party intervened in Parliament, demanding a halt to
the mining plans. This led to a pause in the authorization process,
marking a major victory for ocean conservation.

Looking ahead: A shared responsibility

As the Arctic faces ever-increasing challenges, the need for bold,
unified action has never been greater. [These **[conservation
successes]{.mark}** [show]{.mark} [what is possible]{.mark} when
countries, communities, and **[organizations]{.mark} come

[we can create a future where [the Arctic]{.mark} [thrives as a

[Climate change demands that we work at a larger scale than

#### European Arctic research is sufficient to solve their impacts.

https://projects.research-and-innovation.ec.europa.eu/en/horizon-magazine/braving-cold-europes-polar-research-strides-forward-new-polar-hub

German scientist Dr Nicole Biebow is keenly aware of how important it is
to research and protect the Earth's increasingly fragile polar regions.

The two poles are warming faster than any other area on the planet and
are losing ice through increased melting. The Arctic, for example, is
warming three times as fast as the global average, according to polar
scientists. This affects local communities and wildlife, but also has
broad socio-economic and climate impacts that extend across the globe,
like rising sea levels.

"We always say that the poles are the canary in the coal mine," said
Biebow, the project coordinator of an EU-funded project named
EU-PolarNet 2, which concluded in December 2024.

Biebow is the head of the international cooperation unit at the Alfred
Wegener Institute in Germany and also a former chair of [[the **European
Polar Board**]{.mark} (**EPB**]{.underline}). The EPB [is an
[independent group of **research**]{.mark}
**[institutes]{.mark}**]{.underline}, [[funding]{.mark} agencies and
ministries set up to advance the [coordination of]{.mark} **European
[polar research]{.mark}** both [in the **Arctic**]{.mark} and
**Antarctic**.]{.underline}

[The EPB and another key polar research body]{.underline}, [the European
Polar Coordination Office]{.underline} ([EPCO]{.underline}), [will be
[operating out of Sweden's **far north from**]{.mark}
**2025**]{.underline}. [This reflects Europe's determination to be the
[**leading voice** in **studying**]{.mark} these [high**-latitude
regions.**]{.mark}]{.underline}

EU-PolarNet 2 carried out much of the work to establish the EPCO, which
will start work in January 2025, hosted by the Arctic Centre at Umeå
University, Sweden.

A sense of urgency

As global temperatures increase and the polar ice melts ever faster,
unlocking the secrets of the polar regions is becoming increasingly
urgent.

"A lot of work being done nowadays is about understanding, mitigating or
adapting to future changes," Biebow said, noting that "we have EU Member
States that have an Arctic coastline and people living in these areas".

As the EU-PolarNet 2 team prepares to launch
**[[EPCO]{.underline}]{.mark}**, the researchers have [put together a
list of priorities for **future research**, including [projects on **sea
ice**]{.mark}, [melting **glaciers** and **thawing
permafrost**.]{.mark}]{.underline}

Biebow voiced hope that **[EPCO]{.underline}** [will considerably [help
**research efforts** in the **polar** **regions**.]{.mark}]{.underline}

"The poles, like the deep ocean, are still very, very sparsely
investigated," she said. "It's an area which defines how our future

China's pursuit of great power status is drawing it to the frozen
reaches of the world's polar regions. In both the Arctic and Antarctic,
**[[China]{.underline}]{.mark}** [[has]{.mark} undertaken ambitious
expeditions and **[developed world-class research
facilities]{.mark}**.]{.underline} These investments have elevated
China's voice in polar affairs and afforded it an opportunity to shape
the emerging geopolitical landscape.

Its growing physical footprint in the world's most remote frontiers also
serves to advance China's broader strategic and military interests.

In the Arctic, melting ice sheets present a host of significant
challenges for the global community. While leaders in Beijing are
clear-eyed about the threats posed by climate change, Chinese
strategists also see a potential silver lining.

The changing Arctic environment is expected to open new shipping routes
that could reduce transit times for seaborne trade and make it easier
for China to access the region's natural resources.

Yet without sovereign jurisdiction in the Arctic, China leans on
partnerships with other states to further its interests.

[[China]{.mark} [has]{.mark} two [permanent research stations]{.mark} in
the region, [one]{.mark} located [in Norway's]{.mark} [**Svalbard
archipelago** and the **other** in **Iceland**]{.mark}]{.underline}.
[[Both sites support a diverse range]{.mark} of [**research**, from
**marine ecology** to **atmospheric physics**.]{.mark}]{.underline}

A third facility being utilized by China in northern Sweden is under
scrutiny due to suspected ties to the People's Liberation Army (PLA),
jeopardizing China\'s access to the site.

Beijing faces mounting roadblocks elsewhere. Several Arctic
countries---including the United States---have voiced concerns about
China's presence in the region.

Left with few other options, China is stepping up its investments in
Russia as it looks to Moscow as its strategic partner of choice in the
Arctic.

This may prove to be China's best path forward as both the climate and
geopolitical competition heat up in the Arctic.

Arctic Aspirations

Despite being situated some 1,400 km (nearly 900 miles) south of the
Arctic circle, China has styled itself a "near-Arctic state" and
declared its ambitions to become a "polar great power" (极地强国) by
2030.

A 2018 Arctic policy white paper asserts that developments in the region
have "a vital bearing" on China and lays out Beijing's vision for
utilizing the region's natural resources and shaping Arctic governance.

Beijing has sought to access the region largely through scientific and
commercial ventures, which officials claim give it the "right to speak"
on Arctic affairs.

While [[China\'s **Arctic research**]{.mark} [is]{.mark} [**primarily**

**[knowledge]{.mark}**]{.underline}---[[contributing to

High-Mortality Pandemics

[[A]{.mark} naturally occurring [pandemic]{.mark}]{.underline} (i.e.,
not from an engineered pathogen) [[that]{.mark} would [threaten]{.mark}
human [extinction is a **very small** probability]{.mark}
event]{.underline}. However, historical accounts point to several
instances where disease spread played an important role in causing very
significant decline of specific populations. For example, the
introduction of novel diseases to the Native American population during
the European colonization of the Americas had deadly consequences. It is
difficult to distinguish the effects of the diseases that came with the
Europeans from the war and conflict they also brought with them.
Nevertheless, during the first hundred years of the colonization period,
the American population may have been reduced by as much as 90% (Ord
2020).

Moreover, two major pandemic events, the Justinian Plague in the sixth
century and the Black Death in the fourteenth century appear to have
been severe enough to cause a significant population decline of tens of
percent in the populations they affected. Both events are believed to
have been caused by plague, an infectious disease caused by the bacteria
Yersinia Pestis (Christakos et al. 2005; Allen 1979). While there is a
certain degree of uncertainty involved in studying these events'
societal impacts, historical accounts in combination with modern
scientific methods provide us with some valuable insights into the
effects they may have had on the societies of the time.

With respect to the possibility of a future catastrophic global
pandemic, it appears that this risk is increasing significantly along
with the advances in the field of synthetic biology and the rising
possibility of an accidental or intentional release of an engineered
pathogen. While some of the scientific efforts in the field of synthetic
biology are directed towards increasing our understanding and our
ability to prevent future catastrophic epidemic threats, the risk
stemming from these activities is non-trivial, and may outweigh their
benefits.

The Justinian Plague

The Justinian Plague severely affected the people of Europe and East
Asia, though estimates of its overall mortality vary. Focusing
exclusively on the first wave of the pandemic (AD 541--544), Muehlhauser
(2017) suggests the pandemic was associated with a 20% mortality in the
Byzantine empire. This estimate is based on the mortality rate estimated
for the empire's capital, Constantinople, by Stathakopoulos (2007) to
produce a death toll of roughly 5.6 million. For a longer time span, AD
541 to 600, which included subsequent waves of the plague, scholars
estimate a higher mortality rate of 33--50% (Allen 1979; Meier 2016).

The demographic changes associated with this high mortality led to a
significant disruption of economic activity in the Byzantine empire
(Gârdan 2020). A decline in the labour force caused a decline in
agricultural production which led to food shortages and famine (Meier
2016). Trade also collapsed. Decreased tax revenues caused by the
population decline initiated a major fiscal contraction and consequently
a military crisis for the empire (Sarris 2002; Meier 2016). In the
longer run, however, the massive reduction of the labour force appears
to have had a positive economic effect for the surviving laborers, as
the increased marginal value of labour caused a rise in real wages and
per capita incomes. These beneficial effects for the survivors were also
observed after the Black Death (Pamuk and Shatzmiller 2014; Findlay and
Lundahl 2017).

The mortality and the disruption of activity the plague caused in the
Byzantine empire also led to further direct and indirect cultural and
religious consequences. Meier (2016) particularly highlights the
plague's indirect effect of an increase in liturgification (a process of
religious permeation and internalization throughout society as defined
by Meier 2020), the rise of the Marian cult, and the sacralization of
the emperor.

The direct and indirect effects of the plague also appear to have had
far-reaching and long-term political repercussions. The societal
disruptions caused by the plague are believed to have significantly
weakened the position of the Byzantine empire and arguably led to the
decline of the Sasanian empire (Sabbatani et al. 2012). Interestingly,
the pandemic indirectly favoured the nomadic Arab tribes who were less
vulnerable to the contagion while traveling through desert and
semi-desert environments during the initial expansion of Islam
(Sabbatani et al. 2012).

Of note is the absence of a scientific consensus on the severity of the
Justinian Plague's impacts. For example, Mordechai and Eisenberg (2019)
and Mordechai et al. (2019) argue against the maximalist interpretation
of the historical evidence described above. They suggest that the
estimated mortality rate of the plague is exaggerated, and that the
pandemic was not a primary cause of the transformational demographic,
political and economic changes in the Mediterranean region between the
sixth and eighth century. Recently, White and Mordechai (2020)
highlighted the high likelihood of the plague having different impacts
in the urban areas of the Mediterranean outside of Constantinople.

The Black Death

The Black Death which ravaged Europe, North Africa, and parts of Asia in
the middle of the fourteenth century is considered the deadliest
pandemic in human history and potentially the most severe global
catastrophe to have ever struck mankind. With respect to its mortality,
Ord (2020) argues that the best estimate of its global mortality rate is
5--14% of the global population, largely based on Muehlhauser (2017).

The plague created a large demographic shock in the affected regions. It
reduced the European population by approximately 30--50% during the 6
years of its initial outbreak (Ord 2020). It took approximately two
centuries for the population levels to recover (Livi-Bacci 2017; Jedwab
et al. 2019b). As the mortality rates appear to have been the highest
among the working-age population, the effects on the labour force were
acute (Pamuk 2007).

The plague\'s mortality, morbidity and the associated societal
disruption led to a major decline in economic output both in Europe
(Pamuk 2007) and the Middle East (Dols 2019). In Europe, however, this
decline in economic output was smaller than the decline in population;
output per capita began to increase within a few years of the initial
outbreak (Pamuk 2007).

The large demographic shock caused by the plague led to a shift in the
relative price of labour which, similarly to the Justinian Plague, had a
positive impact on wages. With a reduced labour force, real wages and
per capita incomes in many European countries increased and were
sustained at higher levels for several centuries (Voigtländer and Voth
2013a; Jedwab et al. 2020; Pamuk and Shatzmiller 2014). Scott and Duncan
(2001) point out that real wages approximately doubled in most countries
of Europe in the century following the plague.

An additional insight into the long-run relationship between the Black
Death's mortality and per capita incomes in Europe is offered by
Voigtländer and Voth (2013a). Using a Malthusian model, they suggest
that over time, the rise in income caused by the plague's mortality led
to an increase in urbanization and trade. Furthermore, the increased tax
burden (per capita), combined with the contemporary political climate,
increased the frequency of wars. Consequently, higher urbanization and
trade led to an increase in disease spread which along with a more
frequent war occurrence caused a long-term increase in mortality and a
further positive effect on per capita incomes. In this way, the Black
Death appears to have created a long-lasting environment of
high-mortality and high-income specifically in Western Europe,
functioning as an important contributing factor to its economic growth
in the next centuries (Alfani 2020). However, while in Western Europe
incomes remained elevated over the next centuries, in Southern Europe
they began to decline as the Southern European population started
recovering after AD 1500 (Jedwab et al. 2020).

Apart from the positive effects on wages, the increased marginal value
of labour combined with other factors had further economic and social
implications. A decreased relative value of land and the lack of
workforce to use it effectively caused land prices and land rents to
decrease (Jedwab et al. 2020; Pamuk 2007). A decreased marginal value of
capital assets in general led to a lapse in the enforcement of property
rights (Haddock and Kiesling 2002). Interest rates and real rates of
return on assets also decreased (Pamuk 2007; Jedwab et al. 2020; Pamuk
and Shatzmiller 2014; Jordà et al. 2021; Clark 2016).

Higher wages in combination with a relative abundance of land increased
people's access to land/home ownership, likely reducing social
inequality (Alfani 2020). On the other end of the income distribution,
decreased incomes for landowners led to an overall decrease in income
inequality (Jedwab et al. 2020; Alfani and Murphy 2017).

With respect to the effects on agriculture, the structure of
agricultural output moved away from cereals to other crops following the
plague. Furthermore, the workforce shortages and the incentives to
increase the labour supply are believed to have caused a shift from
male-labour intensive arable farming towards pastoral farming,
consequently raising the demand for female labour (Voigtländer and Voth
2013b). However, while the Black Death appears to have caused certain
structural agricultural changes, Clark (2016) finds no effect of the
plague on agricultural productivity in the long run.

In terms of other social consequences, the evidence suggests that the
plague\'s mortality reduced labour coercion, particularly throughout
Western Europe (Jedwab et al. 2020; Haddock and Kiesling 2002; Gingerich
and Vogler 2021). The increased bargaining power of labour caused by the
plague's demographic shock contributed to and accelerated the decline in
serfdom and development of a free labour regime. Gingerich and Voler
(2021) further argue that these effects may have had long-lasting
political implications and that a decline of repressive labour practices
(such as serfdom) permitted the development of more inclusive political
institutions. They find that the regions with the highest mortality were
more likely to develop participatory political institutions and more
equitable land ownership systems. They find that centuries later, In
Germany, the populations in these high-mortality regions were less
likely to vote for Hitler's National Socialist (Nazi) Party in the 1930
and 1932 elections in Germany.

However, the positive effects on the emergence of freer labour did not
take place in Eastern Europe, where serfdom was sustained and even
intensified. Robinson and Torvik (2011) attempt to explain this
asymmetry arguing that these differential outcomes may have been caused
by the varying power and quality of institutions. The authors suggest
that opportunities generated by the increased bargaining power of
labour, in an environment of weak institutions, were less likely to lead
to a positive effect than in the case of regions with stronger
institutions (with more robust rule-of-law or less corrupt or predatory
practices).

Apart from causing a negative demographic shock to the affected
populations, the Black Death appears to have caused further indirect
demographic changes, particularly in Western Europe. The increased
employment opportunities for females caused by worker shortages and a
higher female labour demand led to a decline in fertility rates and an
increased age of marriage (Voigtländer and Voth 2013b). This demographic
transition to a population characterized by lower birth rates likely
helped to preserve the high levels of per capita incomes and contributed
to further economic development of certain parts of Europe, enabling it
to escape the "Malthusian trap" in the following centuries (Pamuk 2007).
Siuda and Sunde (2021) confirm the pandemic's effect on the accelerated
demographic transition empirically, as they find that greater pandemic
mortality was associated with an earlier onset of the demographic
transition across the various regions of Germany.

Unfortunately, the Black Death also led to an increase in the
persecution of Jews (Finley and Koyama 2018; Jedwab et al. 2019a).
Interestingly, Jedwab et al. (2019a) were able to estimate that in the
case of regions with the highest mortality rates, the probability of
persecution decreased if the Jewish minority was believed to benefit the
local economy.

It is important to highlight that the long-term repercussions of the
Black Death were highly asymmetrical. While in Western Europe the
pandemic appears to have led to some long-term dynamic shifts associated
with increased wages, decreased inequality and a decrease in labour
coercion, this was not the case for other regions. A decrease in wages
was observed for example in Spain (Alfani 2020) and Egypt. In Spain, the
plague\'s demographic impact on an already scarce population caused a
long-lasting negative disruption to the local trade-oriented economy.
The workforce disruption in Egypt led to a collapse of the
labour-intensive irrigation system for growing crops in the Nile valley,
with consequent disastrous effects on the rural economy (Alfani 2020).
Borsch (2005) argues that the economic decline in Egypt caused by the
Black Death "put an end to the power in the heartland of the Arab world"
(p. 114) and to the impressive scientific and technological developments
that came out of this region.

A consensus for an explanation of the Black Death's varied impacts
across regions, and their determinants, does not appear to exist.
However, several researchers attempt to provide partial insights. For
example, Alfani (2020) considers the differential outcomes to be broadly
dependent upon the initial conditions in each region. More specifically,
both Robinson and Torvik (2011) and Pamuk (2007) propose that the
asymmetry of impacts can largely be explained by the differences in the
institutional environments of the affected societies.

It is argued that the Black Death defined the threshold between the
medieval and the modern ages, similarly to the way the Justinian Plague
did for antiquity and the Middle Ages (Horden 2021). Furthermore, the
differential long-term outcomes of the Black Death likely provided a
significant contribution to the so-called "Great Divergence" between
Europe and the rest of the world and the "Little Divergence" between
North-western and Southern and Eastern Europe (Jedwab et al. 2020; Pamuk
2007).

From this perspective, it would seem rational to conclude that apart
from causing substantial and long-term demographic, economic, political,
and cultural changes, both the Justinian Plague and the Black Death
likely significantly altered the course of human history.

Considering the above, it is not unreasonable to expect that a pandemic
of a similar magnitude to these past catastrophes would do the same in
the present day. However, what societal impacts a pandemic of similar or
higher mortality would inflict in the twenty-first century has not
really been the subject of any study, as far as we were able to
identify. A possibility exists, given the newly developed capacity of
humanity to create new pathogens, that the outcomes of a future
catastrophic pandemic will be even more adverse than those of the
Justinian Plague and the Black Death.

Covid-19 has shown us just how serious the threat of an emerging

[unlikely future pandemics will]{.mark} ever [reach the toll on human

Still, a disease with even a fraction of plague's mortality would be a
global concern.

Inverse spoke to Adalja about how a deadly pandemic could transform the
Earth by 2121. His response has been edited and condensed:

[Many [people think about pandemics as extinction events for the human

However, there are some reasons to think that naturally occurring
[[pathogens are **unlikely** to cause]{.mark} human
[extinction]{.mark}]{.underline}. Firstly, [Homo sapiens have been
around for **[200,000 years]{.mark}**]{.underline} and the Homo genus
for around six million years [[without]{.mark} being
[exterminated]{.mark} by an infectious disease, which [is
evidence]{.mark}]{.underline} that **[[the]{.mark} base [rate]{.mark} of
extinction-risk natural pathogens [is low]{.mark}]{.underline}**.82
Indeed, past disease [[outbreaks have not **come
close**]{.underline}]{.mark} [to rendering humans extinct]{.underline}.
Although bodies were piled high in the streets across Europe during the
Black Death,83 human extinction was never a serious possibility, and
some [economists [even]{.mark} argue]{.underline} that it was [[a boon
for the]{.underline}]{.mark} European [[economy]{.underline}.]{.mark}84
Secondly, [infectious [disease]{.mark}]{.underline} has [only
[contributed to]{.mark} the [extinction of a]{.mark} **small
[minority]{.mark} of animal species**]{.underline}.85 [The [only

may be importantly different for modern day humans, so it is unclear
whether the risk is increasing or decreasing. On the one hand, due to
globalisation, the world is more interconnected making it easier for
pathogens to spread. On the other hand, [[interconnectedness

And if biodiversity loss is an existential risk, how big a risk is it?
Should 80k be getting people to go into conservation science or not?

There are independent reasons to think that the risk is negligible.
Firstly, according to wikipedia, [during the Eocene period]{.underline}
\~65m years ago, [there were **thousands fewer genera** than
today]{.underline}. [We]{.underline} have [made **\~1%** of species
extinct, and we would have to continue]{.underline} at [**[current rates

[return to **Eocene**]{.mark} **levels of
bio[diversity]{.mark}**]{.underline}. And yet, even though significantly
warmer than today, [the Eocene marked the dawn of thousands of new
species]{.underline}. So, [**[why]{.mark}** [would]{.mark}]{.underline}
we expect [[the world 200 years hence]{.underline} to [be **inhospitable

who]{.underline} are/[were **significantly [less numerous]{.mark}** than
humans and **significantly [less capable]{.mark}** of a **[rational
response]{.mark} to problems?**]{.underline}

Secondly, as far as I am aware, [evidence for]{.underline}
pressure-induced [non-linear ecosystem shifts is **very
limited**]{.underline}. This is true for a range of ecosystems. Linear
ecosystem damage seems to be the norm. If so, [[this leaves **more
scope** for learning **about the costs** of our damage to ecosystems and
correcting any **damage we have done**]{.underline}.]{.mark}

Thirdly, [[ecosystem services are]{.underline}]{.mark} overwhelmingly
[[a function]{.underline}]{.mark} of the relations [[within **local**
ecosystems]{.mark}, [rather than of **global**]{.mark}]{.underline}
trends in [biodiversity]{.underline}. Upon discovering Hawaii, the
Polynesians eliminated so many species that global decadal extinction
rates would have been exceptional. This has next to no bearing on
ecosystem services outside Hawaii. [[Humanity]{.underline}]{.mark} is an
intelligent species and [[will]{.mark} be able to see]{.underline} if
[other regions]{.underline} are [suffering from biodiversity loss and
**[make adjustments accordingly]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Why would all
regions be so stupid as to ignore lessons from elsewhere? Also, is
biodiversity actually decreasing in the rich world? I know forest cover
is increasing in many places. Population is set to decline in many rich
countries in the near future, and environmental impact per person is
declining on many metrics.

[**[Wildlife]{.mark}** is making a **[comeback]{.mark}**]{.underline}
across some regions.

The [European bison is the continent's largest herbivore]{.underline}.
Archaeological evidence suggests that the bison was widespread and
abundant, stretching from France to Ukraine, down to the tip of the
Black Sea.37 The earliest fossils date back to the Early Holocene period
-- around 9,000 BC.

[Bison populations]{.underline} steadily declined over millennia but
experienced the most dramatic fall over the last 500 years.
Deforestation and hunting of this iconic mammal **[[nearly]{.mark}
drove]{.underline}** it [to **[extinction]{.mark}**]{.underline}. They
had gone extinct in Hungary by the 16th century, in Ukraine by the 18th,
and by the early 20th century they had gone completely extinct in the
wild, [with only tens of individuals kept in captivity]{.underline}.
[The bison was on the **brink of extinction**]{.underline}. But [it has
made an **impressive [comeback]{.mark}**]{.underline} in the last 50
years. By the end of 2021, there were almost 10,000 of them.
[**[Across]{.mark}** the **[world]{.mark}**, we find [examples of
successful **conservation programmes**]{.mark}]{.underline} that have
restored animal populations. [A coalition of conservation
organisations]{.underline} -- including the Zoological Society of
London, BirdLife International and Rewilding Europe -- [**periodically**
publish reports on how **animal populations**]{.underline} in Europe
[are changing]{.underline}. In their latest report they looked at the
change in populations of 24 mammal species and one reptile species --
the loggerhead turtle -- that have been making a comeback.38

Eurasian **[[badger]{.underline}]{.mark}** populations achieved an
average increase of 100% -- a doubling. Eurasian
**[[otters]{.underline}]{.mark}** tripled, on average. Red
**[[deer]{.underline}]{.mark}** increased by 331%. The Eurasian
**[[beaver]{.underline}]{.mark}** has [made]{.underline} the most
[remarkable **[recovery]{.mark}**]{.underline}. It's estimated to have
increased 167-fold, on average. There were likely only a few thousand
beavers left in Europe in the first half of the 20th century. Today
there are more than 1.2 million.

How has [Europe]{.underline} achieved all this? In short, it has
[**[stopped]{.mark}** [many of the **activities** that were killing
**mammals**]{.mark}]{.underline} off in the first place. Agricultural
land use has declined across Europe over the last 50 years. This has
allowed natural habitats to return. [Another]{.underline} essential
[**[development]{.mark}** has been [countries]{.mark}
**[bringing]{.mark}** in **effective [protection policies]{.mark}** such
as]{.underline} complete [**[bans]{.mark}** on]{.underline} hunting or
**[hunting [quotas]{.mark}]{.underline}**, designated areas with
[**legal [protections]{.mark}**, **[patrols]{.mark}**]{.underline} to
catch poachers, [and]{.underline} []{.mark}**[compensation
[schemes]{.mark}]{.underline}** for the reproduction of certain species.
Finally, some animals -- such as the European bison and beaver -- made
their comeback through breeding and reintroduction programmes.

\[FIGURE OMITTED\]

[Europe is no outlier]{.underline}. The [**[American bison]{.mark}** has
become a **national icon**]{.underline} of the US. Before the Europeans
colonised the American continent there were more than 30 million
[bison]{.underline}. The 19th was a [**[rapid]{.mark}** and **vicious**
century of **[extermination]{.mark}**]{.underline}. By the 1880s, there
were just a few hundred bison left. Protected parks managed to keep the
last remaining individuals safe from hunting, and better laws against
hunting mean they have made a comeback over the last century. [Today
there are around half a million bison]{.underline} across North America,
a [**[1,000-fold]{.mark}** increase from their **lowest
point**]{.underline}.

Many of the success stories come from rich countries. But we shouldn't
fall into the trap of assuming that a country has to be rich to protect
its wildlife. There are success stories from countries across the income
distribution.

By the 1960s there were only around 40 Indian rhinos left in the world.
They had gone extinct in **[[Pakistan]{.underline}]{.mark}**, and the
remaining few were spread across **[[India]{.underline}]{.mark}** and
**[[Nepal]{.underline}]{.mark}**. Since then, their numbers have
increased 100-fold. There are now almost 4,000 of them. **[Sub-Saharan
[Africa]{.mark}]{.underline}** is [[home to one of the world's
**greatest conservation**]{.mark} success stories]{.underline}. Southern
white rhinos were once plentiful across the continent. But intense
poaching by the Europeans and killings in the conversion of land for
agriculture meant that by the late 19th century this beautiful animal
was close to extinction. By 1900, there were only 20 left. All were in
the Hluhluwe--iMfolozi Park in South Africa -- now a nature reserve.
Over the course of the 20th century, extreme protection of these species
-- particularly in African nature reserves -- led to a significant and
rapid increase in populations to more than 21,000. There are now 1,000
times as many southern white rhinos as there were a century ago.

[The idea that **[animals]{.mark}**]{.underline} across the world [are
going **[extinct]{.mark}**]{.underline} and we are powerless to change
it [is just **[not true]{.mark}**]{.underline}.

### Turn\-\--Nuclear Icebreakers Bad\-\--1NC

#### Nuclear powered ships are [bad]{.underline} and [risk accidents]{.underline}.

George M. **Moore 24**. Scientist-in-residence at the James Martin
Center for Nonproliferation Studies at the Middlebury Institute of
International Studies at Monterey. \"Why nuclear-powered commercial
ships are a bad idea.\" Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists. 9-5-2024.
https://thebulletin.org/2024/09/why-nuclear-powered-commercial-ships-are-a-bad-idea/

But the post-9/11, post-Three Mile Island/Chernobyl/Fukushima world is
vastly different from the 20th century political and social environment
in which the first generation of nuclear ships were developed. [Even if
economic issues can be overcome with newer]{.underline}, cheaper
[technologies]{.underline} and increased carrying capacity of either
cargo (as China apparently thinks their mega-container ship will do) or
passengers (as some commentators have suggested), [[making
**nuclear-powered ships economical**]{.mark}, the **[security]{.mark}**
and **safety [concerns]{.mark}**]{.underline}, real and imagined, [would
far [outweigh]{.mark} the [benefits of **nuclear
power**]{.mark}]{.underline}. [There are [real **nuclear**]{.mark}
**security risks** and **[safety concerns]{.mark}**]{.underline}
[associated with **nuclear-powered** **commercial ships**]{.underline}.
And even if those concerns seem reasonable to those with sufficient
technical background to evaluate these risks, [the **[public
perception]{.mark}** of these risks would likely **pose [an all-but
insurmountable barrier.]{.mark}**]{.underline}

One does not have to imagine the Somali pirates capturing a
nuclear-powered ship to be aware that the ships could be a significant
terrorist target, both in port and at sea. [In contrast to military
nuclear-powered ships, which maintain arguably significant security
protections, **commercial ships** and shipping facilities are afforded
relatively **little security protection**]{.underline}. Even if the
public accepted the use of nuclear-powered ships in their ports, in all
probability expensive security measures would be needed for operations
to be considered reasonably safe from terrorist attacks. Overcoming
these concerns would pose significant financial burdens on the vessel
operator and port facility and would limit the number of ports where
nuclear-powered ships could dock.

Second, [the potential for a [reactor accident]{.mark}]{.underline},
albeit low, [[must **be considered**]{.mark}.]{.underline}
[Proponents]{.underline} [argue]{.underline} that use of [new
fuels]{.underline} such as TRi-structural ISOtropic (or TRISO) pellets,
which the Energy Department claims to be the most robust nuclear fuel
ever created, and concepts such as low-pressure molten salt reactors
[make the spread of **[contamination]{.mark}** [from an
**accident**]{.mark} far less likely than was the case with the
high-pressure, water-cooled reactors that are used in use in military
naval ships]{.underline}. [Such arguments tend to ignore one fact:
**[Commercial ships]{.mark}** are **[surrounded by]{.mark}** water. If
there is leakage, [waterborne contamination]{.mark} that [could be
**extremely difficult**]{.mark} [to **contain**]{.mark}, potentially
[**threatening expanded areas** and **raising concerns about**, for
example, **commercial fishing**]{.mark}.]{.underline}

[Nuclear propulsion]{.underline} of commercial shipping also [[creates
**unique risks**]{.underline}]{.mark}. [In contrast to military vessels
designed to resist damage, [commercial ships are]{.mark} relatively
[thin-skinned and not nearly as **damage-tolerant** as **military
hulls**]{.mark}]{.underline}. [In addition to the risk of terrorist or
wartime attacks, nuclear-powered commercial vessels face the risks of
collision, grounding, and weather-related damage.]{.underline}

[[**Accidents** aboard **nuclear sub**]{.mark}marine**[s]{.mark}** have
[caused]{.mark} a number of them to sink [with]{.mark} long-term
**[adverse environmental consequences for]{.mark} the
[oceans]{.mark}**]{.underline}. In addition to accidents, many countries
have purposefully dumped radioactive wastes in the oceans. With regard
to proper stewardship of the planet, it is time to raise the issue of
denuclearizing the world's oceans. To fail to raise the issue and to
achieve the denuclearization of the oceans is to abdicate our
responsibility for the health and well-being of the oceans and the
planet. Nuclearization of the Oceans Nuclearization of the oceans has
taken a variety of forms. The primary ones are: 1. the oceans have
served as a medium for hiding nuclear deterrent forces located on
submarines; 2. [[nuclear]{.mark} [reactors]{.mark} have been [used to
**power ships**]{.mark}, primarily submarines, some of which have gone
down at sea with their [**nuclear fuel** and]{.mark} **nuclear
[weapons]{.mark}** [aboard]{.mark}]{.underline}; 3. increasing use is
being made of the oceans for the transportation of nuclear wastes and
reprocessed nuclear fuels; 4. the oceans have been used as a dumping
ground for nuclear wastes; 5. atmospheric nuclear weapons testing,
particularly in the Pacific, has been a source of nuclear pollution to
the oceans as well as the land; and 6. underground nuclear weapons
testing, such as that conducted by France in the South Pacific, has
endangered fragile Pacific atolls and caused actual nuclear
contamination to the oceans as well as risking a much greater
contamination should the atolls crack due to testing or future
geological activity. The problems arising from nuclearization of the
oceans can be viewed from several perspectives. From an environmental
perspective, [[issues arise with regard to]{.mark} nuclear
[contamination]{.mark} in the oceans **[working its way up]{.mark}
through [the food chain]{.mark}**. The biological [resources of]{.mark}
the [oceans will]{.mark} eventually **[affect human
populations]{.mark}**]{.underline} which are reliant upon these
resources. The threat of nuclear contamination has diminished with
regard to nuclear testing, which has not taken place in the atmosphere
since 1980. Moreover, the nuclear weapons states have committed
themselves to a Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty, which they have promised
to conclude by 1996. This treaty, if concluded, will end all underground
nuclear testing. The dumping of high-level radioactive waste material
was curtailed by the Convention on the Prevention of Marine Pollution by
the Dumping of Wastes and Other Matter, which entered into force in
1975. A later amendment to this Convention prohibited ocean dumping of
all radioactive wastes or other radioactive matter. However, exemptions
authorized by the International Atomic Energy Agency and non-compliance
remain a concern. [Problems can be anticipated in the future when
radioactive contaminants]{.underline} already dumped in canisters or
[**contained [in]{.mark} fuel or weapons [aboard]{.mark} [sunken
sub]{.mark}**[marine**s breach their containment**]{.mark}]{.underline}.
Increased use of the oceans to transport nuclear wastes and reprocessed
nuclear fuel (between Japan and France, for example) has substantially
increased the risk of contamination. Coastal and island states that are
on the route of the transportation of nuclear materials stand [**high
risks of contamination** in the event of an accident at
sea]{.underline}. International law regarding the transportation of
hazardous material must be strengthened and strictly enforced by the
international community to prevent **[[catastrophic
accidents]{.underline}]{.mark}** in the future. From a human rights
perspective, inhabitants of island states in the Pacific have suffered
serious health effects and dislocation as a result of atmospheric and
underground nuclear weapons testing. In response to assurances by France
that their underground testing in the South Pacific is entirely safe,
the islanders in Polynesia and throughout the Pacific have retorted: If
it is so safe, why isn't it being done in France itself? The response of
the French government has been that French Polynesia is French
territory, highlighting the arrogance and abuse that accompanies
colonialism. Human rights issues also arise with regard to maintaining a
nuclear deterrent force that threatens the annihilation of much of
humanity. The Human Rights Committee stated in November 1984 in their
general comments on Article 6 of the International Covenant on Civil and
Political Rights, i.e., the right to life, that "the production,
testing, possession, deployment and use of nuclear weapons should be
prohibited and recognized as crimes against humanity." The deployment of
nuclear weapons on submarines, therefore, arguably constitutes a crime
against humanity, and thus a violation of the most fundamental human
right, the right to life. From a security perspective, the nuclear
weapons states argue that having a submarine-based deterrent force
assures their security. Thus, to varying degrees, each of the nuclear
weapons states maintains strategic submarines capable of causing
unthinkable destruction if their missiles were ever launched. (See
Appendix.) Viewed from the self-interests of nearly all the world's
population-except the nuclear weapons states whose leaders appear
addicted to maintaining their nuclear arsenals -the continued reliance
on nuclear deterrence, at sea or on land, poses a frightening threat to
continued human existence. In 1972 the Seabed Agreement prohibited the
emplacement of nuclear weapons on the seabed, ocean floor, or subsoil
thereof. This agreement prohibited what was already deemed unnecessary
by the nuclear weapons states; placing nuclear weapons on submarines
made them less vulnerable to detection and destruction than placing them
on or beneath the seabed or ocean floor. The oceans continue to be used
by the nuclear weapons states as an underwater shadow world for their
missile carrying submarines. The United States alone currently has 16
Trident submarines, each carrying some 100 independently targeted
nuclear warheads. Each Trident submarine has a total explosive force
greater than all the explosive force used in World War II, including at
Hiroshima and Nagasaki. Britain, with the help of the United States, is
replacing its older class of Polaris SSBNs with a fleet of four Trident
submarines. France currently has five strategic missile submarines with
four more of a superior class to be commissioned by 2005. Russia has
over 35 strategic missile submarines with an estimated capacity of 2,350
nuclear warheads. China has two modern ballistic missile submarines. Its
Xia class submarine carries twelve 200 kiloton nuclear warheads. The
total destructive force that day and night lurks beneath the oceans is a
chilling reminder of our technological capacity to destroy ourselves.
That this threat was created and is maintained in the name of national
security suggests a collective madness that must be opposed and overcome
if, for no other reason, we are to fulfill our obligation to posterity
to preserve human life. An ongoing responsibility resides with the
nuclear weapons states to fulfill the obligations set forth in Article
VI of the Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT), "to pursue negotiations in
good faith on effective measures relating to cessation of the nuclear
arms race at an early date and to nuclear disarmament, and on a treaty
on general and complete disarmament under strict and effective
international control." At the NPT Review and Extension Conference in
April and May 1995, the treaty was extended indefinitely after extensive
lobbying by the nuclear weapons states. At the same time the nuclear
weapons states promised to enter into a Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty by
1996, and to engage in a "determined pursuit" of the ultimate
elimination of their nuclear arsenals. Protecting the Common Heritage
The Law of the Sea Treaty enshrines the concept of the oceans as the
common heritage of \[hu\]mankind. Maintaining the oceans as a common
heritage [demands that the oceans be protected from contamination by
[nuclear pollutants]{.mark}]{.underline}; that they not be used in a
manner to undermine basic human rights, particularly the rights to life
and to a healthy environment; and that the [oceans not be allowed to
serve as a public preserve for those states that believe their own
security interests demand the **[endanger]{.mark}**ment of [global
**human survival**]{.mark}.]{.underline}

At the same time, [**[nuclear propulsion]{.mark}** [is
**costly**]{.mark} and **complex**]{.underline}, [[and]{.mark} employing
it on [icebreakers]{.mark} could [raise concerns about]{.mark} potential
[**operational** and **environmental**]{.mark} [**risks** for
**ships**]{.mark} that will be primarily operating in regions well known

with]{.underline} [regard to **Russia's** **nuclear icebreaking

[The third risk is linked to [a]{.mark} potential **[nuclear shipping
incident]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Expanding LNG exports from the Yamal
Peninsula have been accompanied by a large increase in nuclear-powered
icebreaker escorts.³² In 2019, nuclear-powered icebreakers accompanied a
total of 510 vessels, an increase of 54 percent compared to 2018.³³ With
global warming, regular commercial shipping in the Arctic will increase
the likelihood of accidents triggered by extreme weather and climate
events, such as stronger winds, storms, and higher waves. [One plausible
incident scenario involves [a collision of a]{.mark}]{.underline}
foreign-owned [**[LNG tanker]{.underline}** [and]{.underline}]{.mark}
Russian **[[nuclear-powered]{.mark} [icebreaker]{.mark}]{.underline}**
[escort in a winter storm]{.underline}, [with a serious [potential for
**release** of]{.mark} **[radioactive
contaminants]{.mark}**]{.underline}.³⁴ The recent oil spill in Norilsk,
caused by the erosion of the surrounding permafrost, illustrates the
considerable risks that increasing economic activity can have on the
regional environment, as well as the catastrophic effect climate change
is having in the Arctic.³⁵ [Ecological issues can, in turn,
[accelerate]{.mark} [disease spread]{.mark} [and have detrimental
effects]{.mark} [on human health]{.mark}.]{.underline}

Moreover, given the increased levels of submarine activity in the
Barents Sea -- by both Russia and NATO member states -- **[a serious
incident]{.underline}** [or **accident involving**]{.underline}
**[nuclear-powered]{.underline}** [submarines or military vessels
carrying nuclear weapons is]{.underline} **[practically
unavoidable]{.underline}**. One only needs to recall the 2009 collision
of French and British submarines in the Atlantic, which raised questions
about the safety of ballistic missile submarines patrolling the oceans
while hiding their position.³⁶ [While a submarine accident in the deep
ocean arguably carries fewer risks]{.underline} -- owing to the massive
dilution of radioactivity -- [a submarine **collision** in the **shallow
waters** of the Barents Sea is an **unknown scenario** with
**potentially disastrous consequences**.]{.underline}

[The presence of **radiological** and **nuclear material** poses a
serious threat to the Arctic **marine environment** and
**industries**]{.underline}, [including **fisheries** and **local food
sources.**]{.underline}³⁷ Fishing is one of the most important
industries in the Arctic, representing large shares of gross domestic
product (GDP) in some countries (e.g. 8.1% in Iceland).³⁸ In the case of
Norway, a big share of exports come from the Arctic in the form of
seafood. [Any rumour of **leaking spent fuel**]{.underline} [-- let
alone an actual nuclear incident -- could be devastating to the
**country's market** and **seafood sales**]{.underline}.³⁹These and
other concerns have prompted Norway and other Arctic states to cooperate
with Russia in the field of nuclear and radiation safety.

[The above-mentioned risks are further compounded by the fact that the
Arctic]{.underline} currently [lacks]{.underline} multiple facets of
both operational and research [infrastructure that is needed to provide
key elements of both short- and long-term response to a major nuclear
release incident]{.underline}.⁴⁰

### Turn\-\--Nuclear Bad\-\--Impact\-\--2NC/1NR

#### Oceanic nuclear pollution causes extinction.

[[It is]{.mark} **highly [likely]{.mark}** [that]{.mark} radioactive
[wastes]{.mark} would eventually **[leak]{.mark}** out of the containers
because of **poor insulation**, **volcanic activity**, **tectonic plate
movement** and several other geological factors]{.underline}. Indeed,
last month, UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres confirmed that a Cold
War era concrete "coffin" filled with nuclear waste is leaking
radioactive material into the Pacific Ocean. [Since [radiation]{.mark}
from nuclear wastes [remains]{.mark} active [for]{.mark} **hundreds of
[thousands]{.mark}** [of years, their]{.mark} dangerous [effects]{.mark}
will **[linger]{.mark}** for a long time [and]{.mark} will [have
**lethal impact**]{.mark} on marine life]{.underline}.

Furthermore, six **[[nuclear submarines]{.underline}]{.mark}**---4
Russian and 2 American---lost as a result of accidents are lying at the
bottom of the oceans. They [[represent **serious threat** of]{.mark}
radioactive [contamination]{.mark} of the oceans, too]{.underline}.

One of the biggest contaminations due to radiation was caused by a
series of nuclear tests conducted by the USA on the sea, in the air and
underwater at Bikini Atoll in the North Pacific between 1946 and 1958.
The French nuclear tests carried out during 1966-1996 in French
Polynesia are responsible for other cases of intense radioactive
pollution of marine ecosystems.

Clearly, [[we are using the oceans as the **ultimate
sump**]{.underline}]{.mark}, partly because their very immensity seems
to preclude any long-term effect, and partly because they belong to no
one. [This **cannot continue indefinitely** because in order for us [to
**survive**, we have to **protect the oceans**]{.mark}]{.underline}.
Lest we forget, [life **emerged** from the oceans and [the source
of]{.mark} most of the **[oxygen]{.mark}** we breathe are the
oceans]{.underline}. They have been an endless source of inspiration to
humankind.

### Turn\-\--Plan Causes Warming\-\--1NC

#### The plan [causes]{.underline} warming:

#### 1. Icebreakers destroy sea ice, which [increases]{.underline} global temperatures. 

Johanna **Cohn 22**. Environmental studies intern at CASSE.
\"Icebreakers in the Arctic: An Overlooked Environmental Concern.\"
Center for the Advancement of the Steady State Economy. 4-14-2022.
https://steadystate.org/icebreakers-in-the-arctic-an-overlooked-environmental-concern/

What's Missing from the Conversation?

Little information is available about the environmental concerns that
icebreakers pose. Literature highlights the perceived
"positives"---scientific exploration, search and rescue, trade and
shipping, and competition amongst nations---as being more important than
considering environmental degradation. However, here's what we know.

**[[Icebreakers break ice]{.underline}]{.mark}**. [[As the **broken ice
melts**, **sunlight** is **absorbed**, leading to]{.mark} [increased
**temperatures**, and]{.mark} **thus more [ice
melting]{.mark}**]{.underline}. An [icebreaker cruising
through]{.underline} [the ice for]{.underline} 1,000 kilometers ([620
miles]{.underline}), leaving an ice-free wake of ten meters (33 feet),
[would open an area of water ten square kilometers]{.underline} (**[3.9
square miles]{.underline}**) over the entire cruise. Although the Arctic
Sea covers about 4,000 kilometers (2500 miles), [[**any amount** of
**ice breaking harms** the]{.mark}
**[environment]{.mark}**]{.underline}. [[With]{.mark} the [**continual**
use of **icebreaker ships**]{.mark}, [the **Arctic** will
continue]{.mark} [to look more like]{.mark} [**ice cubes melting** in a
**glass of water**]{.mark}.]{.underline}

[As **melting endures**]{.underline}, [we will continue to see
**environmental effects** around the world.]{.underline} Changes in the
Arctic Sea ice pattern leads to a rise in sea levels globally. Low-lying
developed areas in the Gulf Coast and the mid-Atlantic regions are
especially at risk from sea-level rise. The recent growth of coastal
areas has resulted in larger populations and more valuable coastal
property being at risk from sea-level rise. Major physical impacts of a
rise in sea level include erosion of beaches, inundation of deltas as
well as flooding and loss of many marshes and wetlands. Increased
salinity will likely become a problem in coastal aquifers and estuarine
systems because of saltwater intrusion.

[[Changes in **Arctic ice patterns**]{.mark} are also [**leading** to
more **frequent extreme**]{.mark} **[weather]{.mark}**.]{.underline} In
the past few years, such extreme weather has been seen particularly
across the east coast of the USA, western Europe, and central Asia.
These regions will continue to experience more extreme weather because
of Arctic amplification, the enhanced sensitivity of high latitudes to
global heating. Arctic ice melt has also been shown to distort the flow
of and weaken the jet stream, resulting in more frequent periods of
intense heat and ferocious cold.

[There's also evidence that the sound **emitted** from **icebreakers**
is **detrimental** to **marine animals**, particularly **whales** and
**other large mammals**]{.underline}. The sound interferes with their
ability to communicate with their pods. Additionally, sound pollution
likely has long-term effects that are difficult to predict.

#### 2. Extraction of Arctic resources causes climate change.

and warming the global climate.\" WWF Arctic. April 2023.
https://www.arcticwwf.org/the-circle/stories/extractivism-is-damaging-arctic-ecosystems-and-warming-the-global-climate/

As a concept, "**[extractivism]{.underline}**" has [gained attention
recently as **[mining]{.mark}** and **mineral**]{.underline}
**[exploration [companies eye frontiers]{.mark}]{.underline}** [that
were [once inaccessible]{.mark}: the ocean]{.underline}
[seabed]{.underline}, [the marine offshore]{.underline}, areas of the
**[high north]{.underline}** [and more]{.underline}. Naomi Klein, the
prominent Canadian environmental author who wrote This Changes
Everything---a book about the climate crisis---describes extractivism as
"a dominance-based relationship with the earth" and connects it to what
she calls sacrifice zones: "places that, to their extractors, somehow
don't count and can therefore be poisoned, drained or otherwise
destroyed."

The [[fossil fuel projects]{.mark} across the Arctic

### Turn\-\--Plan Causes Warming\-\--2NC/1NR

#### Icebreakers [superheat]{.underline} the Arctic. It turns the region into "[ice cubes melting in a glass of water]{.underline}."

[[Arctic to look like]{.mark} "[**ice cubes** **melting** in a **glass

Icebreakers play a crucial role in providing response capacity for
crises and disasters in ice-covered waters. They also improve the
capability of government marine safety agencies, and improve response to
environmental catastrophes like oil spills. Currently, international
flights cannot fly over the Arctic for lack of maritime rescue services,
something that could change if Russia expanded its investment in the
Arctic.

However, [the main purpose of the [icebreakers]{.mark} is **simply to
[break ice]{.mark}**]{.underline}. [[Broken ice **melts**]{.mark} [more
**easily**]{.mark}, becoming [water]{.mark} that **[absorbs more
sunlight]{.mark}**. This [causes an increa]{.mark}se in **local
[temperatures]{.mark}**, thus **[leading to more ice
melting.]{.mark}**]{.underline}

[[The **Arctic is warming** much **faster** than the **rest of the
world**]{.mark} [as the high]{.mark} sunlight **reflectivity**, or
[albedo, of **Arctic ice is lost**]{.mark}]{.underline}. [Compared to
ice, seawater absorbs **more sunlight**, meaning that water then **warms
up** and **evaporates** more readily, itself becoming a **greenhouse
gas**.]{.underline}

[[**Small ships** can have **big effects** in the
Arctic]{.underline}]{.mark}. Non-profit US think tank the Center for the
Advancement of the Steady State Economy reported that an icebreaker ship
passing through the ice for around 620 miles, which leaves an ice-free
wake of 33 feet, would open an area of water of 3.9 square miles over
the entire cruise.

Even though the Arctic Sea covers around 2,500 miles, **[[all
icebreaking harms the environment.]{.underline}]{.mark}** Continuous use
of icebreaker ships in the Arctic would lead to looking more like "ice
cubes melting in a glass of water," the report says.

#### Extraction of resources [decimates]{.underline} the Arctic and causes us to [burn more fossil fuels]{.underline}.

The lack of reciprocity in the economy of **[[oil and gas
production]{.underline}]{.mark}** is obvious: the [[mass-scale
removal]{.mark} [of resources]{.mark}]{.underline} **[for

[projects]{.mark} **[pollute rivers]{.mark}**, **[marine]{.mark}

**air**]{.underline}. [An oil spill in the Arctic would also **devastate

The impacts could be irreversible, wiping out wildlife populations and
destroying traditional food systems and livelihoods.

[Marine [mammals are]{.mark}]{.underline} particularly [[undermined by

**mining**]{.mark} and **shipping industries** are the **biggest
drivers** and **beneficiaries** of ice melt in the Arctic]{.underline}.
A 10-fold increase in shipping traffic through the Northern Sea Route is
expected from now to 2035, and negative impacts on pristine and
sensitive marine and coastal environments will be unavoidable.

Given that the Arctic will only continue to attract more industrial
development in the years to come, it is important to find a balance
between creating jobs and protecting natural environments. To ensure a
healthy future for all, the Arctic economy needs to foster investments
in human capital, renewable energy and the sustainable blue economy and
apply ecosystem-based management. The agreement reached at the United
Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change Conference of the Parties
(COP28) to transition away from fossil fuels---and triple renewable
energy capacity by 2030---is a good first step. [But ensuring that
governments step up and phase out fossil **fuels will be critical** to

#### Arctic mineral resources are [not special]{.underline}. We could mine critical minerals from other regions.

Arctic be a significant contributor of critical minerals for the global

Conclusions

[This paper provides a preliminary overview of [the potential of the
Arctic to]{.mark} make a significant contribution to the
**[supply]{.mark}** of [**critical minerals** for the **low-carbon
energy**]{.mark} **[transition]{.mark}.**]{.underline} A key limitation
of the study is its reliance on a selection of publicly available
literature in English.

Before presenting the conclusions, it is worth reiterating that
[[the]{.mark} mineral geology of the [**Arctic** is **not**]{.mark}
**[special]{.mark}**]{.underline}. The particularities are the various
physical and human geographic factors that render the costs and
timelines for mineral extraction in the Arctic greater than in many
other parts of the world. Of these, infrastructure is likely to prove
the most important. Thus, new production is likely to come from regions
with existing mines. Nevertheless, all the countries studied, with the
possible exception of Russia, have published or will soon publish
mineral strategies that seek to boost the exploitation of minerals,
including in Arctic regions. These new strategies reflect the growing
demand for critical minerals. The Nordic countries of Norway, Sweden and
Finland are particularly important for the European Union.¹²⁰ Their
Arctic regions already have good mining and transportation
infrastructure.

Climate change will have a variety of impacts on Arctic transportation
infrastructure. On the one hand, ice sheets will retreat, winters will
be less harsh and sea routes will be open for longer each year. On the
other hand, melting permafrost will disrupt existing installations and
increase the cost of new ones.

The question of whether the Arctic can contribute a significant share of
global supplies of critical minerals can be addressed at three
timescales: today, over the next ten years to 2034, and beyond 2034. For
the purposes of this report, we will take a proportion of 10 per cent or
higher as being 'significant'.

The situation today

As presented in Section 2 of this report, the Arctic today supplies a
significant share of global supplies for only three minerals: platinum
(\<13 per cent), palladium (\<44 per cent), and possibly nickel (\<11
per cent). However, the Arctic's share of global reserves of these three
minerals is less than the share of global production: \<7.8 per cent for
platinum group metals and \<8.1 per cent for nickel. The shares of
silver and phosphate production in the Arctic may be as high as 8.4 per
cent and 6.8 per cent respectively, but this is highly uncertain.
Reserves of silver in Arctic countries amount to 19 per cent of the
global total, but how much of this lies in the Arctic is not known. For
all the other critical minerals, the Arctic's share of global production
is less than 5 per cent. Among these, the largest shares are for copper
(\<4.1 per cent) and cobalt (\<3.8 per cent). Reserves of these two
minerals in the Arctic amount to \<8 per cent and \<2.3 per cent
respectively. For two metals, the Arctic's share of reserves is
significantly higher than the share of production: rare earths (\<11 per
cent) and graphite (\<5 per cent). The Arctic also makes a contribution
to global supplies of byproducts such as tellurium (\<16 per cent),
selenium (\<10.2 per cent), and germanium (\<3.6 per cent).

Russia is the dominant Arctic producer of most of these minerals, as
well as being the main producer of copper and aluminium metals and of
byproducts such as germanium, selenium, and tellurium. While Canada
produces several of these minerals, most of this production is not in
the Arctic, with the major exception of nickel. Finland contributes to
global chromium and phosphate supplies, Alaska to silver supply, Norway
to graphite and silicon metal supplies, and Iceland to the global supply
of aluminium.

[To summarise: [the Arctic makes significant contributions]{.mark} (\>10
per cent) [to the]{.mark} global [supply of **critical mineral
ores**]{.mark} [in only **three cases**]{.mark}]{.underline} (platinum,
palladium, and nickel) and to one -- and possibly two -- byproduct
metals (tellurium and selenium).

The period to the mid-2030s

Exploration for rare-earth minerals has increased across the world since
2016 although we lack the data to show how this is reflected in the
Arctic, with the exception of Sweden where the rise in exploration
budgets has been dramatic. The reopening of previously closed mines
could lead to increased production of critical minerals, and exploration
could boost reserves, provided annual production does not exceed the
rate of growth of reserves. This problem can be obviated in part through
recycling.

In order to be economically viable in the Arctic, even with state
support, mineral deposits need to be relatively large and/or high-grade.
To make a significant contribution to global supplies, they would
ideally form a large mineral province comprising several deposits. The
copper, cobalt, nickel, and platinum group metal province in the Taymyr
region of the Russian Arctic is an example. Many such geographically
extensive mineral provinces are hosted within blocks of ancient
geological crust known as cratons. The major cratons in the Arctic where
the ancient rocks are exposed at the surface lie in Russia (northern
Siberia and Taymyr), northern Canada, Greenland, Finland, Sweden, and
northern Norway.¹²¹ However, many types of mineral occurrence occur in
quite different geological settings. Nevertheless, the Arctic regions of
Russia and Canada are much larger than those of the other Arctic
countries. On these grounds alone, we should expect production of
critical minerals in their Arctic regions to rise faster and be larger
than in the other Arctic countries.

Most new production that comes online between now and the mid-2030s is
likely to be from mineral reserves that are already proven, or from
areas adjacent to existing known deposits. How rapidly production may
rise in each country will depend on a variety of inter-related factors,
including the extent of state policy support, the availability of
capital, the risk appetites of investors, the nature of the mineral
deposits, the regulation of environmental and social issues, and the
scale of existing mining operations and infrastructure in the relevant
region. In many, the processing of the mineral ores will take place in
sub-Arctic locations.

Given the scale of its current mining operations in the Arctic and its
need to boost mineral production and exports, it is possible that the
most marked growth in production between now and 2034 will be in Russia.
Further, this production is likely to be for minerals in regions where
mining is already taking place, such as Taymyr and Kola. But much will
depend on the availability of finance, a challenge that has been
exacerbated by the withdrawal of most foreign investors.

[[Exploration]{.underline}]{.mark} and feasibility studies in the Arctic
regions of the other countries [[will]{.underline}]{.mark} certainly
[[identify **new**]{.mark} **[reserves]{.mark}** and **potential
mines**]{.underline}. [[However, it is likely that **few** of these will
add]{.mark} [significantly to the Arctic's share of the **global
supply**]{.mark} of critical **minerals** [in the **next ten
years**]{.mark}]{.underline}. That being said, they may start to provide
additional sources of supply of critical mineral ores for western Europe
and North America. To take full advantage of this, it will be necessary
to build refineries to produce the required metals. These refineries
need not be in the Arctic, nor even in the same country as the ore
production.

The period beyond 2034

The period beyond 2034 is when the Arctic regions could possibly start
to provide a greater share of global supplies of critical minerals. The
speed at which this takes place will depend on factors additional to
those governing the period to 2034. First is the rate of growth of
demand for different critical minerals. This will be shaped by demand
for final products that rely on critical minerals, the nature of the
technology in these appliances that determines which minerals are in
demand, and the scale of recycling of critical minerals and metals.
Second is the economic competitiveness of critical mineral supplies from
Arctic regions compared with those from the rest of the world. All
things being equal, significant additional supplies from the Arctic are
likely to come mainly from high-grade deposits where government support
is strong. The exact locations of the mines will vary between minerals,
but Russia and Canada are likely to feature strongly for several
minerals. Other countries may become regionally important suppliers for
specific minerals, for example Greenland and Sweden for rare earths.
Sub-sea exploitation is likely to have started as well.

[In summary]{.underline}, [[the Arctic is **unlikely** to **make** a
**significant contribution**]{.mark} [to the future]{.mark} [**global
supply** of **critical minerals**]{.mark}.]{.underline} [Indeed, [the
region's share of the global]{.mark} [production]{.mark} of many
critical minerals [is likely to **decline** as **production** grows in
other]{.mark} **[areas]{.mark}**]{.underline}. However, national and
regional strategies could contribute to the diversification of supply
sources for certain mineral importing countries. This may be
particularly important for Europe and North America.

[Economically speaking]{.underline}, [[the Arctic will]{.mark} likely
[remain a **backwater** for **market-driven**]{.mark}
**[economies]{.mark}** for the **foreseeable future**]{.underline}. [The

[[Sweden]{.mark} [may]{.mark} fill this void for the US with its own
**Arctic resources**, even as companies search for

Overall, [the US should not ignore the Arctic, and it should put to rest
the notion that this region is a **unique zone** of **peace** in an
**otherwise quite turbulent world**]{.underline}. That being said,
Americans should also not deem that losing the "race for the Arctic"
will critically threaten America's larger national interests. By not
attempting to compete head-to-head with Russia or China to "conquer" the
region, the US has incurred some advantages against these competitors.

increasing **demand** for **critical raw materials**.]{.underline}

It stated that the Arctic region, which encompasses parts of eight

essential for clean energy technology.

Of note within these are rare earth elements (REEs), materials necessary
for a range of clean energy technologies including electric vehicles

in Norway, Sweden and Greenland.

[[Mining is **not new**]{.mark} to the Arctic region]{.underline}.

[What challenges lie ahead for Arctic mining?]{.underline}

There is a stereotypical perception of the Arctic as a vacant expanse of
ice and sea -- a polar tundra that is more like Antarctica. [While the
perception is untrue, [**extreme** **temperatures**, **remote
locations**]{.mark} [and **short days**]{.mark} [have meant
**working**]{.mark} in the region [is not **without its
challenges**]{.mark}.]{.underline}

In 2019, Guggenheim Partners, an investment firm that helped develop the
Arctic Investment Protocol alongside the World Economic Forum, projected
that to establish the infrastructure needed for a connected Arctic[,
**[\$1trn would be needed over the next 15 years.]{.underline}**]{.mark}

If done correctly[, [a fully-**fledged mining
industry**]{.underline}]{.mark} could bring significant benefits to
local Arctic economies and communities as well as the global stage, but
there is the caveat that it [[will **require**]{.mark} a lot of
**[work]{.mark}**.]{.underline}

"[Building a better Arctic]{.underline} -- and a better world --
[requires long-term capital]{.underline} that carefully weighs
environmental and societal impact to support sustainable growth," the
report stated. "It demands an entirely new framework for investment on a
truly massive scale."

Mads Qvist Frederiksen, executive director at the AEC, says private
funding alone is not enough to bolster mining development in the Nordic
Arctic. Credit: Arctic Economic Council

Significant investment is also needed to attract (and keep) a workforce.
In [the Nordic regions particularly, **[salaries]{.mark}**, **taxes**
and **royalties** [are **typically**]{.mark} **higher**, and must remain
so if [workers]{.mark} are [expected to work **long hours** at
**isolated**, **cold mine sites**. ]{.mark}]{.underline}

["[**Private funding alone** won't be **enough**]{.underline}]{.mark},"
says Frederiksen. "LKAB is a good example because they have attracted
investment from the government and the EU, but as this is state-owned it
brings up the question of whether it is only state-owned companies'
\[projects\] that will be developed?"

Finally, [**[icebreakers]{.mark}** [do **not give states** the

is not the 19th century, when prospectors or military forces could stake
claims to new territory. For example, Douglas Porch recounts how
preoccupation with "effective occupation" led French military forces in
Africa to sacrifice basic prudence in a "desire to steal a march on
international competition." There should be no rush --- and is no need
--- to repeat these mistakes. Indeed, the Pentagon's recent Arctic
strategy notes that even "Russia has generally followed international
law and procedure in establishing the limits of its extended continental
shelf."

To be sure, [icebreakers are necessary to access polar areas even as ice
cover diminishes]{.underline}. They are an important element of Arctic
sovereignty as a result. **[However]{.underline}**, [[the number

The ECS of the CMIP6 GCMs ranges between 1.8 °C and 5.7 °C, but the

(Sherwood et al., 2020, Hausfather et al., 2022). However, [**recent

(Nijsse et al., 2020, Scafetta, 2022, Scafetta, 2023a, Lewis, 2023,

increasing atmospheric CO2 concentration at surface and global warming
such as increasing mean air temperature, extreme heat, sea level, mean
ocean temperature, ocean salinity and ocean acidity; with decreasing
cold spell, snow, glacier and ice sheet, permafrost, lake, river and sea

However, [[**recent research** argued]{.underline}]{.mark} that [the

**[[very]{.mark} likely [unrealistic]{.mark}]{.underline}**,
respectively (Burgess et al., 2020, Hausfather and Peters, 2020, Pielke

[projects]{.underline} about [**half of the 21st-century warming** than
what the SSP5-8.5 scenario does]{.underline} (Fig. 1) and is thus far
less alarming.

With the aforementioned factors in mind, it was proposed here to use

precisely** assess]{.underline} "**[realistic]{.underline}**" [global
and regional impacts and risks]{.underline} that could be [associated
with climate changes]{.underline} that are [expected to occur in the
21st century]{.underline}, and to compare them with the Paris Agreement
warming target of keeping global surface temperature \< 2 °C above the
pre-industrial levels throughout the 21st century. [To **optimize the
result**]{.underline} even more, the [simulation ensembles
containing]{.underline} the [low]{.underline}, [medium]{.underline},
[and high-ECS macro-GCMs were **linearly scaled** to **best reflect**
the **real global surface warming**]{.underline} recorded from
1980--1990 to 2012--2022.

According to the IPCC, if there is little-to-no adaptation, the impacts
and risks of projected climate change will be moderate-high (orange-red
flag) by 2040--2060, and the situation might worsen considerably by 2100
even if the SSP2-4.5 moderate scenario is implemented. In fact,
according to the analysis reported in Table 3, the GCMs within the
IPCC's preferred ECS range of 2.5--4.0 °C project a warming of
1.98--3.82 °C by 2080--2100. Thus, the IPCC (Masson-Delmotte et al.,
2018) analysis suggests that only net-zero-emission scenarios like the
SSP1-2.6 (which could produce a warming of 1.26--2.82 °C by 2080--2100)
should be adopted to avoid too dangerous climatic changes, which are
expected to begin if global surface temperatures rise more than 2--2.5
°C above the 1850--1900 level in a few decades (Gao et al., 2017, Tol,
2015). Climate-change alarmism and world-wide proposals for prompt
implementations of net-zero emission policies are only based on such
claims.

However, using only the low-ECS models (ECS ≤ 3.0 °C) and the SSP2-4.5
scenario, Table 3 suggests that [**global [warming]{.mark}** in the 21st
century [will be **moderate**]{.mark}]{.underline}, [ranging from 1.36
°C to 2.25 °C]{.underline} (median 1.77 °C) [by 2050 and from 1.96 °C to
2.83 °C]{.underline} (median 2.28 °C) [by 2080--2100]{.underline}, which
partially overlaps with the upper warmer half of the climate projection
obtained using the SSP1-2.6 scenario and the GCMs with ECS of 2.5--4.0
°C. Thus, [climate change impacts and risks will worsen by the end of
the 21st-century]{.underline}, albeit [[at a **slower rate** than
**predicted**]{.mark} **by the IPCC**]{.underline} using the same
SSP2-4.5 scenario. As a result, the SSP2-4.5 scenario, which is moderate
and affordable, may be close enough to roughly meet the Paris Agreement
warming target, whereas the SSP2-3.4 scenario, which could be even more
realistic (Pielke et al., 2022), should even more likely fully meet it.

I also proposed an alternative methodology for estimating "realistic"
21st-century climate projections and assessing their respective impacts
and risks. In fact, the [low-ECS macro-[GCM]{.mark}]{.underline} appears
to be slightly [**[warmer]{.mark}** than global surface temperature
records]{.underline} and there are serious concerns about the
reliability of the global surface temperature records, which cannot be
ignored. In fact, their [warming]{.underline} appears to be
[**excessive** [in comparison to **alternative**]{.mark} **temperature
[records]{.mark}**]{.underline}, [[such as **satellite-based**]{.mark}
ones]{.underline} relative to the lower troposphere (Spencer et al.,
2017, Zou et al., 2023), [[and]{.underline}]{.mark} there are [**various
evidences** suggesting their [**contamination** from]{.mark} urban heat
islands and other **[non-climatic]{.mark} surface
[factors]{.mark}**]{.underline} (Connolly et al., 2021, Scafetta, 2021a,
Scafetta, 2023b, Soon et al., 2023, Spencer, 2023). There are also
concerns regarding the ability of the GCMs to properly reconstruct
decadal to millennial natural climate oscillations (e.g.: Scafetta,
2013, Scafetta, 2021b, Scafetta, 2023c). As a result, [**all
[GCMs]{.mark}** may be **[grossly inadequate]{.mark}** for estimating
climate change in the 21st century]{.underline}, as also McKitrick and
Christy (2020) concluded. Thus, the models likely need to be corrected
and upgraded with new relevant physical mechanisms. It is possible to
agree with McCarthy and Caesar (2023) who recently showed the inability
of the CMIP5 and CMIP6 GCMs in properly hindcasting the Atlantic
Meridional Overturning Circulation and concluded "if these models cannot
reproduce past variations, why should we be so confident about their
ability to predict the future?".

To address the above issues, I have proposed an **[[alternative]{.mark}
methodology]{.underline}** that [[uses **empirical modifications**
of]{.mark} the **actual GCM projection [ensembles]{.mark}** [via]{.mark}
**appropriate [linear scaling]{.mark}**]{.underline} in such a way [to
simulate]{.underline} the [outputs of **hypothetical climate models**
that could **[accurately represent]{.mark}** the [warming]{.mark}
observed [from]{.mark} 19[80 to]{.mark} 20[22]{.mark}]{.underline}. The
1980--2022 period was selected because it is covered by a variety of
temperature records with low statistical errors. This methodology would
essentially simulate hypothetical GCMs that are supposed to optimally
reproduce the data. Simple testing validates the proposed methodology
because scaling the projection ensembles of the three macro-GCMs to a
similar level from 1080--1990 to 2011--2022 results in projection
ensembles that approximately overlap throughout the 21st century.

The proposed methodology may also be justified by considering that the
GCMs are extremely sensitive to small modifications of their internal
free parameters, in particular to those regarding cloud formation, and
even GCM modelers adopt complex tuning approaches to explicitly
calibrating them to better match historical data (Mauritsen and
Roeckner, 2020, Mignot et al., 2021). Section 4 proposes and
investigates several of these modeling approaches, the results of which
are depicted in Fig. 5, Fig. 7.

If the warming of the HadCRUT5 record from 1980 to 1990--2011--2022 is
assumed correct, it is found that the SSP2-4.5 scenario produces climate
projections similar to those produced by the low-ECS macro-GCM. In fact,
the projected warming ranged from 1.65 °C to 3.03 °C by 2080--2100, with
a median of 2.28 °C (Table 4, case #1). This conclusion is unsurprising
given that the low-ECS macro-GCM has already successfully recreated the
HadCRUT5 warming.

However, if the reference warming is that reported by lower troposphere
satellite temperature data (Spencer et al., 2017, Zou et al., 2023), the
warming of the low-ECS macro-GCM simulations must be lowered by about
30%. As a result, global warming by 2080--2100 is projected to range
from 1.18 °C to 2.16 °C (median 1.63 °C) above pre-industrial levels
using the SSP2-4.5 scenario (Table 4, case #2), which is well below the
(safe) threshold of 2.0 °C and is even cooler than the 1.26--2.82 °C
estimate obtained with the GCMs with ECS within the IPCC likely range of
2.5 °C and 4.0 °C using the SSP1-2.6 net-zero emission scenario.

A similar result was obtained with an empirical climate model that
assumes that the global surface temperature record is sufficiently
accurate, but also takes into account temperature changes caused by
empirically identified large climate cycles and/or solar effects that
the CMIP6 GCMs do not replicate (Scafetta, 2010, Scafetta, 2013,
Scafetta, 2021b); this case projects a warming ranging from 1.15 °C to
2.52 °C with median 1.78 °C by 2080--2100 (Table 4, case #3).
Unfortunately, the IPCC ignores such semi-empirical modeling of the
climate system although it has been developed and discussed in the
scientific literature, and it should not be dismissed lightly given that
the GCMs fail to reproduce the natural oscillations observed throughout
the Holocene. They do not, for example, reproduce any of the Holocene
warm periods, such as the Roman and Medieval warm periods, which
indicate a quasi-millennial oscillation, a quasi-60-year oscillation,
and many other natural climate oscillations. Also this kind of empirical
modeling predicts very modest ECS values, ranging at least between 1 and
3 °C, but more likely between 1 °C and 2 °C (Lindzen and Choi, 2011,
Scafetta, 2013, Scafetta, 2021b, Scafetta, 2023c, Bates, 2016, Stefani,
2021).

In conclusion, as Hausfather and Peters (2020) pointed out, it is past
time to stop treating the worst-case climate change scenarios (e.g.,
SSP3-7.0 and SSP5-8.5) as the most likely outcomes, because only
realistic and pragmatic scenarios, such as SSP2-4.5 or SSP2-3.4, can
lead to sound policies that can be accepted by all nations. Furthermore,
net-zero scenarios such as SSP1-2.6 look to be equally unattainable, as
the depletion of crucial metals required for low-carbon solar and wind
technologies, as well as electric vehicles and their chargers, appears
to make low-carbon technology production impossible on the very large
scale required to substitute fossil fuels (Groves et al., 2023). In
fact, despite the IPCC AR6 reports are rather alarming because global
surface temperatures were projected to rise by up to 4--8 °C above
pre-industrial levels according to unrealistic shared socioeconomic
pathways (see Fig. 1 and Masson-Delmotte et al., 2021), with
catastrophic consequences in many situations (Pörtner et al., 2022),
Fig. 5, Fig. 7, Fig. 8 show that "**[realistic]{.underline}**" [climate
change impacts and risks for the 21st century will likely be **much more
moderate** than what the IPCC claims]{.underline}. This is because there
is a [[growing]{.mark} **body of [evidence]{.mark}**]{.underline} that
[the **actual ECS** may be rather low]{.underline} (1.5--3.0 °C, or even
1--2 °C) [for a variety [of]{.mark} reasons]{.underline} derived from
direct CMIP6 GCM assessments, [likely **[warming biases]{.mark}**
affecting global surface temperature records]{.underline},
[[and]{.underline}]{.mark} a (likely solar induced) [**[natural
variability]{.mark}** that the **current climate models** do not
reproduce]{.underline}. According to the semi-empirical climate modeling
proposed above, the climate system will likely warm by less than
2.0--2.5 °C by 2080--2100, and on average less than 2.0 °C, also if the
moderate SSP2-4.5 scenario is implemented. As a result, rapid
decarbonization and net-zero emission scenarios such as the SSP1-2.6 are
shown to be unnecessary to maintain global surface temperature \< 2 °C
throughout the 21st century.

Fig. 9 employs the climate "thermometer" proposed by Climate Action
Tracker (2022) to summarize the above findings by contrasting the
projections derived from the IPCC climate assumptions, where only the
SSP1-2.6 net-zero emission scenario could satisfy the 2.0 °C target,
with the new proposed assessments of "realistic" global warming impacts
and risks obtained using the three semi-empirical models discussed above
with the pragmatic SSP2-4.5 scenario that approximately agrees with the
real world action based on current policies (Tables 3B and 4).

As a result, despite predictions that the climate system would continue
to warm throughout the 21st century, [there is **[no]{.mark} compelling
[evidence]{.mark}** [of]{.mark} an **[impending]{.mark} global
[disaster]{.mark}** caused by manmade greenhouse gas
emissions]{.underline}. The 2.0 °C Paris-agreement warming target for
the 21st century can likely be met even under the feasible and moderate
SSP2-4.5 emission scenario because future climate change is expected to
be modest enough that any potential related hazards can be addressed
efficiently through effective and low-cost adaptation strategies,
without the need for implementing rapid, expensive, and technologically
likely impossible net-zero decarbonization policies.

In some ways, the **[most [recent]{.mark} climate
[science]{.mark}]{.underline}** even [[shows]{.underline}]{.mark} some
[[encouraging trends]{.underline}]{.mark}. IPCC reports have always
spelled out different scenarios for the amount of climate-altering
greenhouse gases humans will put into the atmosphere, to show a range of
possible climate risks the world may face. The IPCC calls these
scenarios "representative concentration pathways" (RCPs), and they range
from the relatively mild RCP2.6 scenario all the way up to RCP8.5, whose
risks would be calamitous.

But as the [[world]{.mark} has [made progress]{.mark} in **recent

[The]{.underline} 2023 [United Nations Climate Change
Conference]{.underline} [is over, but **undercurrents**]{.underline} [of
existential anxiety persist.]{.underline} [This is a **timely
reminder**]{.underline} that [climate policy begins with
**characterizing**]{.underline} [the problem]{.underline} correctly.
[[Perhaps **no frame** has been more]{.underline}]{.mark} **[hotly
[debated]{.mark}]{.underline}**---[and]{.underline}
**[misunderstood]{.underline}**---[[than whether climate change poses an
**existential risk**]{.underline}.]{.mark} As this week's title reveals,
[the answer is **not definitive**]{.underline}. But understanding the
circumstances under which climate change is and is not an existential
risk has profound bearing on whether our policy response benefits or
harms humanity. An existential risk threatens the existence of a
subject, such as a community, a nation state, or even humanity as a
whole. In this sense, climate change does present such a risk to certain
communities or nation states, such as low-lying island countries
susceptible to sea-level rise. [Climate change is, to a degree, a matter
of]{.underline} **[life or death,]{.underline}** [considering how it may
**shift** mortality]{.underline} [patterns]{.underline} around the
world. [But [there is]{.mark}]{.underline} [**[no
evidence]{.underline}** [that **humanity's existence**]{.underline} [is
at stake]{.underline}]{.mark}[. However, climate change is existential
to an alarming proportion of **Earth's species**]{.underline}---with up
to half facing extinction. We can learn much from the history of the
human condition under previous climate eras. [[Paleoclimate data
reveal]{.mark} that **[climatic fluctuations]{.mark}**]{.underline}
[markedly [affected human evolution]{.mark}]{.underline} and perhaps
eliminated some human populations up to continental scale a million
years ago. **[[Overall]{.underline}]{.mark}**, [however]{.underline},
[[primitive humans **proved resilient**]{.underline}
[under]{.underline}]{.mark} [a variety of **[harsh climatic

**Atlantic meridional**]{.mark} **overturning** circulation
current]{.underline}---[arguably [the **biggest climate
risk**]{.mark}]{.underline} [in the news today]{.underline}---
previously [[occurred about]{.underline} **[14,500 years
ago.]{.underline}**]{.mark} This is not to understate the threat that
human-caused climate change presents, but simply to put it in
perspective. [There are scenarios of climate "**tail
events"**]{.underline} [that could **accelerate**]{.underline} [climatic
disruption]{.underline} and induce massive economic, social and
ecological damages. [Yet [there is **no** scenario]{.mark} in [which

[of [its **basic needs**]{.mark}**,**]{.underline} [especially
[with]{.mark}]{.underline} **[further [technological
advances]{.mark}.]{.underline}** Distinguishing the circumstances of
existential climate risk is not just semantically important---it is
crucial for better civil society dialogue, policy analysis and
decisions. Importantly, policies to mitigate climate change only improve
society if their benefits exceed their costs. [[An **existential
threat**]{.underline}]{.mark} [to humanity [warrants **virtually any
intervention**]{.mark}]{.underline} to reduce the risk. [For example, if
a civilization-destroying **asteroid**]{.underline} [were hurtling

be worth it. [[Climate change is]{.underline}
**[often]{.underline}**]{.mark}
**[[mischaracterized]{.underline}]{.mark}** [in [this

**[policy interventions]{.underline}** [irrespective of their **cost**

#### Energy independence is [meaningless]{.underline} but [resilient]{.underline}.

Robert **Rapier 24**. Senior Contributor, Forbes. "U.S. Energy
Independence Set New Record In 2023."
https://www.forbes.com/sites/rrapier/2024/07/01/us-energy-independence-set-new-record-in-2023/

There are [[**two ways** to think about **energy
independence**]{.underline}]{.mark}. [One]{.underline} definition
[is]{.underline} that [we don't import any energy]{.underline}. That
would be true energy independence. Call this [the **[Zero
Imports]{.mark} Definition**]{.underline}.

[I [don't find this]{.mark} definition]{.underline} very
[[useful]{.underline}]{.mark}, [[due to]{.mark} the
**[globalized]{.mark} nature** of **energy
[markets]{.mark}**]{.underline}. [The [U.S. imports]{.mark}]{.underline}
some [energy [to]{.mark} convert it into **products for
[export]{.mark}**]{.underline}. We began importing crude oil in the U.S.
before 1950, and we have imported it every year since.

[[Under this definition]{.underline}]{.mark}, [[the U.S. hasn't
been]{.mark} energy [independent in]{.mark} **at least [75
years]{.mark}**]{.underline}. This definition highlights how
interdependent global energy supplies are, emphasizing that
[[this]{.mark} sort of **energy [independence]{.mark}** [is neither
necessary nor]{.mark} **economically [desirable]{.mark}**]{.underline}.

Thus, the notion, "President Trump made us energy independent", is not
true under the Zero Imports Definition. During President Trump's term,
the U.S. imported an average of 9.3 million barrels per day (bpd) of
crude oil and finished products. By the Zero Imports Definition,
Statement 1 above holds: We weren't energy independent under Trump or
Biden.

Definition 2: [[Energy Surplus]{.underline}]{.mark}

The [Energy Surplus Definition [is **more useful**]{.mark}]{.underline}
in my view. That [defines energy independence as producing **more
energy** than we consume]{.underline}. Based on that definition, even if
we import some energy, the fact that we produce more than enough to
satisfy our needs would mean the U.S. is energy independent.

The Energy Surplus Definition is what Trump is using when he said we
became energy independent while he was in office. If we consider this
definition, in 2019 the U.S. had an energy surplus for the first time
since at least the 1940s. This can be seen in the following graphic when
the production line barely exceeds the consumption line for the first
time in 2019.

**[[Net U.S.]{.mark} energy [imports]{.mark}]{.underline}** hit a record
high in 2005, but since then [[have]{.mark} **steadily
[declined]{.mark}** due to the surge of oil and gas production released
by the shale boom]{.underline}. In 2019, net U.S. energy imports became
net exports, and that is the measure by which many --- including Donald
Trump --- declared energy independence.

However, we didn't lose this status [[under]{.underline}]{.mark} Joe
[[Biden]{.underline}]{.mark}. To the contrary, [[U.S.]{.mark} oil and
gas [production]{.mark} **continued to [grow]{.mark}**]{.underline}, as
shown in the next graphic. In 2022 [the **net energy surplus** reached
5.94 quadrillion BTUs]{.underline} (quads), which was [the highest level
in **at least 70 years**]{.underline}.

I covered this development a year ago in U.S. Energy Independence Soars
To Highest Level In Over 70 Years. But last week the EIA updated the
numbers to include 2023. (They also revised 2022 down to 5.83 quads,
which was still higher than any excess under Trump).

The [net [energy surplus]{.mark} in 2023 [grew to **7.80
quads**]{.mark}]{.underline} --- [[the **highest number on
record**]{.underline}]{.mark}. In 2019, that number had been only 0.61
quads of net energy surplus. Thus, Statement 2 above is correct. If you
are using energy surplus as a measure of energy independence, [there
have]{.underline} now [been three **consecutive annual surpluses** that
exceeded those under Donald Trump]{.underline}.

Conclusions

In summary, the [[debate over]{.mark} U.S. [energy independence
is]{.mark}]{.underline} often [[muddled by **differing definitions** and
**political rhetoric**]{.underline}]{.mark}. [[True]{.mark} energy
[independence]{.mark}]{.underline}, characterized by zero energy
imports, [[is **neither practical** nor reflective of]{.mark} the
**[interconnected]{.mark} nature** of global energy
[markets]{.mark}]{.underline}.

Instead, a [[**more pragmatic** definition]{.underline}]{.mark} ---
producing more energy than consumed domestically --- [[offers]{.mark} a
**[clearer perspective]{.mark}**]{.underline}. Under this measure, the
[U.S. has not only achieved but also **expanded** its energy
independence]{.underline} since 2019, with growing surpluses under both
the Trump and Biden administrations.

The [**consistent [growth]{.mark}** [in]{.mark} net energy
[production]{.mark}]{.underline}, particularly [driven by advancements
in **oil and gas extraction technologies**]{.underline},
[[underscores]{.mark} the [nation\'s **robust energy**]{.mark}
**sector**]{.underline}. As we move forward, it\'s crucial to continue
fostering policies that support a secure and resilient energy future for
the United States.

[Arctic]{.mark}]{.underline} [toward the United States [would
**traverse**]{.mark} [over the **Arctic**]{.mark}]{.underline}. [[The

this perspective]{.underline} [[than]{.mark} [a **lack of
icebreakers**]{.mark}]{.underline}. Similarly, while Russia's
icebreakers are important for its Northern Fleet's ability to operate in
and through the Arctic, the number of U.S. icebreakers has little
bearing on this. Addressing Russia's ability to project power into the
North Atlantic, the DoD Arctic strategy focuses on other capabilities.
These include cooperation with Great Britain and Norway on P-8 patrols,
NATO air policing missions from Iceland, and a recognition that
establishment of Joint Force Command Norfolk helps to protect the North
Atlantic sea lines of communication to Europe.

Not an iron dome; more like an iron colander. [The major **[technical
problems]{.mark}** that **[remain]{.mark}
[unresolved]{.mark}**]{.underline}---[and eventually forced the
cancellation of all SDI's ambitious plans---are the **same
[obstacles]{.mark}** that [have **ruled** out]{.mark} an
**[effective]{.mark} ballistic [missile]{.mark}** [**defense**
for]{.mark} more than [**60 years**:]{.mark}]{.underline}

[the ability of the enemy to overwhelm a system with offensive
missiles;]{.underline}

[the]{.underline} [[questionable]{.underline}]{.mark}
**[[survivability]{.underline}]{.mark}** [of space-based
weapons;]{.underline}

the [[inability to discriminate]{.mark} among real warheads]{.underline}
[and]{.underline} hundreds or thousands of
**[[decoys]{.underline}]{.mark}**;

the problem of designing battle management, command, control, and
communications that could function in a nuclear war; and,

[the]{.underline} [**[low confidence]{.mark}** in the ability of the
system]{.underline} [to work]{.underline} perfectly **[[the
first]{.underline}]{.mark}**---and, perhaps,
only---**[[time]{.underline}]{.mark}** it is ever used.

[These [problems]{.mark} have been [detailed]{.mark} at length already
in the Bulletin's columns, **[congressional
reports]{.mark}**]{.underline}, [[and]{.mark} independent **expert
[studies]{.mark}**]{.underline}, including two that played a major role
in the Star Wars debates---the 1987 American Physical Society Directed
Energy Weapon study and the 1988 Office of Technology Assessment
Ballistic Missile Defense study.

These and other technical problems would have to be resolved before an
effective missile defense system can be deployed. In the long term, new
technologies, particularly directed energy weapons, hold some promise.
[In the short term, however, there is **[little reason]{.mark}**
[for]{.mark} **blind [technological optimis]{.mark}m**.]{.underline}

[Intentionally confusing the]{.underline} US **[public]{.underline}**
[and gullible **politicians**]{.underline} [by conflating the limited
success of **less-complicated defenses** against short-range rockets
with the infeasibility of destroying hundreds of **long-range
ballistic** **missiles** is part of the **sales effort.**]{.underline}

"Israel has an Iron Dome. They have a missile defense system," Trump
promised at the Republican Party convention last year. "Why should other
countries have this, and we don't?"

[Because [it is **technically impossible**]{.mark} [to **build** a
**system** that can protect the]{.mark} [U]{.mark}nited [S]{.mark}tates
from **ballistic missile attack**]{.underline}, Mr. President. No amount
of hucksterism will change that.

"[Iron Dome defends small areas from short-range nonnuclear missiles.
It's a vastly easier task than defending the **whole country** against
missiles that travel 100 times further and **seven times
faster**]{.underline}," missile defense expert Laura Grego of the Union
of Concerned Scientists explains.

"[[There is **zero possibility**]{.mark} [of a **comprehensive missile
defense**]{.mark} of the United States in the foreseeable
future]{.underline}," James N. Miller, who served as undersecretary of
defense in the Obama administration, told Max Boot. "[We are [not going
to escape]{.mark} [**mutual assured destruction** vis-à-vis **Russia**
or **China**]{.mark}."]{.underline}

As shown repeatedly over the past 60 years, the only way to eliminate
the threat of nuclear-armed missiles is to negotiate their elimination.
Pretending that there is a magic shield that can be willed into
existence will only make the problem of national missile defense worse.

A [**new** federal regulatory agency]{.underline} was created in
2011---the Bureau of Safety and Environmental Enforcement
([BSEE]{.underline}). The agency issued the Well Control Rule in
2016---a [[complex]{.mark} [collection]{.mark} [of]{.mark}
[regulations]{.mark} **[designed]{.mark}** [to]{.mark}
**[prevent]{.mark} future [blowouts]{.mark}**, [providing]{.mark} oil
[drillers]{.mark} detailed **[requirements]{.mark}** [to **safely
drill**]{.mark} an offshore well]{.underline}. The Trump administration
modified the rule in 2019 to be more attuned to the different
characteristics of the industry.

According to the agency's current director, compared to the past six
years, the [agency [increased]{.mark} the [number of
**inspections**]{.mark} by 26 percent]{.underline}, increased the number
of inspections per facility by 86 percent, and increased the numbers of
inspectors by 12 percent.

[[Offshore oil production]{.underline}]{.mark} in the U.S. Gulf of
Mexico [[has been **increasing**]{.underline}]{.mark} since 2013 when it
hit its lowest level of production after the Deep Water Horizon
accident. In 2019, offshore oil production totaled almost 2 million
barrels per day, increasing by 50 percent since 2013. In 2019, the
Federal offshore Gulf of Mexico produced 15 percent of total U.S. oil
production.

[[In]{.mark} [the past decade]{.mark}]{.underline}, [[there has not
been]{.mark} another **[major offshore]{.mark} [oil spill]{.mark}** in
the United States]{.underline} like the Deepwater Horizon event. In
fact, the two companies standing by to cap a well blowout have never
even deployed their billions of dollars' worth of equipment for anything
other than drills. That shows that [the **[safety]{.mark}
[measures]{.mark}** [undertaken]{.mark} [by the industry are]{.mark}
**[working]{.mark}** [to]{.mark} **[prevent another
blowout]{.mark}**.]{.underline} The offshore Gulf of Mexico is an
important source of U.S. oil, supplying 15 percent of the nation's
oil---an important part of our national energy security.

#### Icebreakers [can't protect]{.underline} Arctic trade routes.

The Consequences of an Icebreaker Gap

Thankfully for Washington, [[the consequences of this **icebreaker
gap**]{.mark} for U.S. defense [are]{.mark} often
**[misunderstood]{.mark}** or **overstated**]{.underline}. First, many
of the specific military challenges that China or Russia might pose in
the Arctic are independent of icebreakers and best dealt with in other
ways. These include denying the United States access to the region,
missile strikes against the homeland, the ability to move forces from
the homeland, and demonstrating U.S. strength against challenges.

[[It is not clear how Russia or China would **leverage icebreakers** to
exclude the U]{.mark}nited **[S]{.mark}tates [from the
region]{.mark}**]{.underline}[,]{.mark} [[or how the U]{.mark}nited
[S]{.mark}tates [would]{.mark} utilize icebreakers to [**overcome** such
**attempts**]{.mark}]{.underline}. [Take the concern of [Russia denying
access along the]{.mark}]{.underline} **[[Northern Sea
Route]{.underline}]{.mark}** (setting aside the limited trans-Arctic
shipping to date and modest future projections[). The Russian ability to
do this [stems]{.mark} primarily [from]{.mark} their [growing missile,
air, and]{.mark} surveillance **[capabilities]{.mark}** deployed
**[within their own territory]{.mark}**]{.underline}. As Mathieu
Boulègue observes, the Russian Northern Fleet will likely be able to
perform some sea denial missions "at a limited operational tempo." Yet
"the majority of its assets are not Arctic-specific, operating beyond
the region and in other strategic directions." [[Increasing]{.mark} the
numbers of **U.S. [icebreakers]{.mark}** [would not]{.mark}
**[overcome]{.mark}** the **[Russian]{.mark}** **[shore-based
area-denial challenge]{.mark}**]{.underline}. In the event of a crisis,
naval surface vessels operating behind slow-moving icebreakers would be,
Andreas Kuersten notes, "sitting ducks for aerial, undersea, and
shore-based enemy forces."

#### Trade doesn't solve war.

Stephen **Brooks 24**. Professor of Government, Dartmouth College; Guest
Professor, Stockholm University. "The Trade Truce?"
https://www.foreignaffairs.com/world/trade-truce-stephen-brooks

There is a good reason for such confusion: on close inspection, the
relationship between global economics and global stability turns out to
be extremely multifaceted. Although there have been notable [[individual
studies supporting]{.underline}]{.mark} the **[[optimistic
view]{.underline}]{.mark}** that [[commerce promotes
peace]{.underline}]{.mark}, they [[are just that]{.underline}]{.mark}
--- **[[individual studies]{.underline}]{.mark}**. A [[**systematic
examination** of **all**]{.mark} **the [empirical research]{.mark}** on
commerce and conflict [shows]{.mark}]{.underline} that the [[connection
is]{.mark} **far more [complex]{.mark}**]{.underline}.

Consider trade. In a forthcoming book, I have identified [[57]{.mark}
**empirical studies**]{.underline} published since 2000 [that
[examined]{.mark}]{.underline} the [influence of trade on war and
peace]{.underline}. [[Just 16]{.mark} of the studies [supported]{.mark}
the **optimistic [perspective]{.mark}** that [trade]{.mark}
**universally [promotes]{.mark}** [peace]{.mark}]{.underline}. One found
that it promotes conflict, and nine found no effect. The remaining 31
concluded that trade has a mixed effect on the likelihood of war ---
sometimes preventing it, sometimes promoting it.

These mixed-effect findings would be useful if they yielded consistent,
clear insights regarding the circumstances that lead to peace. But
instead, the [list]{.underline} that emerges from this scholarship [is
long]{.underline}, [unwieldy]{.underline}, [and **sometimes
contradictory**]{.underline}. Recent studies, for example, have found
that trade leads to peace only when it occurs among democracies, among
rich states, among states that are members of the World Trade
Organization, among states that mostly trade products from different
industries, among states that mostly trade products from the same
industries, among states that are members of common regional trade
pacts, among states that trade with one another at very high levels,
among states that trade with one another to a roughly equal extent, and
among states that have low levels of protectionism. Small wonder, then,
that policymakers have struggled to craft peace-enhancing trade agendas.
The [[relationship]{.mark} between trade and conflict [has **so many
asterisks**]{.mark}]{.underline} that [[it]{.mark} **simply
[cannot]{.mark}** [be **boiled down** into anything]{.mark}]{.underline}
pithy for officials, students, or anyone else to follow.

The [[effect of **international finance** is]{.underline}]{.mark} even
[[murki]{.mark}er]{.underline}. Many analysts have argued that
[**international capital** flows prevent war]{.underline}. The New York
Times columnist Thomas Friedman, for example, once maintained that
international investors will "not fund a country's regional war" and
will "actually punish a country for fighting a war with its neighbors by
withdrawing the only significant source of growth capital in the world
today." But the [[literature does not show]{.underline}]{.mark} that
[[investors]{.mark} **consistently [flee]{.mark}** [states]{.mark} that
are [at war]{.mark}]{.underline}. Moreover, [[of]{.underline}]{.mark}
the [[four studies]{.mark} that **looked directly** at how flows of
capital influence]{.underline} the likelihood of conflict, [[**only
one** found a **stabilizing effect**]{.underline}]{.mark}. Two concluded
there was no relationship, and one found that greater foreign ownership
of government debt increased the likelihood of conflict.
